  <u>PROLOGUE</u>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify">It's been a very stressful day at work. As the only new graduate of the Auror Academy to ever be granted senior status, all eyes were on him. Not only that, due to his defeat of Voldemort nearly four years ago, there was so much pressure on his shoulders. He was on top of his game in all of his missions as indicated by his astounding numbers of one hundred percent capture rates and zero casualties.</p>
<p align="justify">And then, this fiasco happened…</p>
<p align="justify">He led a team of five aurors on a wild goose chase to capture Antonin Dolohov, one of the last four Death Eaters still on the loose after Voldemort's death. When he received a lead regarding Dolohov's suspected whereabouts, with gritted teeth, he immediately informed the Head Auror and volunteered to lead the mission. Antonin <em>bloody </em>Dolohov ranks the highest on his shit list because of what the bastard did to Hermione during their fifth year. So, this mission is damn personal to him.</p>
<p align="justify">Long story short, the mission was a complete failure. Turns out, whoever gave them the tip must have been <em>imperiused </em>by Dolohov to lure them into a trap. When they arrived at the supposed hideout, he nearly lost a comrade because of the fire and explosion that greeted them as they searched the place. While he wasn't blamed for that incident, the anonymous smug letter that Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt received about the entrapment operation turned the tables against him.</p>
<p align="justify">The Head Auror, who had always been too strict and too stern with him, decided to punish him for his rash decision and poor judgment. So, he got called in this morning only to learn that he is suspended for one week. Of course, he's not the only auror to have ever gotten a suspension, but being the Man Who Conquered or whatever moniker the press is calling him now, he is certain that the papers will be making a headline out of his temporary dismissal from duty tomorrow morning.</p>
<p align="justify">He wanted to grump about the unfair treatment but he decided to just let it pass. Besides, at least he gets a week off work. He just feels frustrated that the Head Auror doesn't understand his predicament. This is Dolohov for Merlin's sake! Antonin <em>fucking </em>Dolohov who almost killed the most important woman in his life many years ago. He would never feel at ease when that bastard is still hiding somewhere…</p>
<p align="justify">Sigh.</p>
<p align="justify">When he is feeling down, there are only two things that could keep him calm. One, a heart-to-heart talk with Hermione Granger, the smartest witch he has ever known. Or two, a feast at his favorite Thai restaurant. Since he cannot disturb Hermione right now because she is surely focused on her many projects at the Department for the Care and Regulation of Magical Creatures, he's left with option number two.</p>
<p align="justify">So here he is... brisk-walking the familiar path towards the hidden Asian culinary gem he and Hermione have come across during one weekend they spent together two years after the war.</p>
<p align="justify">When he pushed the doorknob on the glass door, he smiled. There's just something about the <em>Xahar </em>that makes anyone who enters feel happy and at home. The ceiling lights illuminate the cozy Southeast Asian restaurant through the lanterns strategically scattered above, which reminded him of the <em>Loi Krathong </em>in Chiang Mai, that he and Hermione got to see during a side trip after successfully restoring her parents' memories.</p>
<p align="justify">"<em>Sawadee Ka!" </em>A waitress wearing a modernized skirt and blouse combo made of Thai silk greeted cheerfully.</p>
<p align="justify">"Hello. Table for one, please."</p>
<p align="justify">"<em>Nay </em>Potter, alone today? Where <em>Saw swy </em>My-nee?" Mr. Amudee, the owner of <em>Xahar</em>, greeted with a quick bow. Since they were regulars, they eventually befriended the owner and they even get special discounts. Mr. Amudee even calls Hermione <em>Saw swy </em>which means 'beautiful girl'.</p>
<p align="justify">"She's at work. So, I'm alone. I need Pad thai noodles and your Satay platter <em>Nay </em>Amudee," he grinned.</p>
<p align="justify">"Sit! Sit!" The owner escorted him to a table. Since it's still early, there are only five tables occupied.</p>
<p align="justify">"<em>Nay </em>Amudee, I need you to make me happy today, so, I'll be having my usual and make the Satay a double order. If I can't finish them, I'll bring the leftovers for Hermione," he winked.</p>
<p align="justify">"You seem sad, <em>Nay </em>Potter… How about I give free Thai Milk Tea? Make you happy, no?" The cheerful and stout man wiggled his eyebrows.</p>
<p align="justify">"Thank you, sir." He smiled which was returned by the owner before he rushed off to prepare his order. Mr. Amudee is the main chef of the restaurant and all the dishes were his signature recipes.</p>
<p align="justify">As he waited for his food, he glanced up at the ceiling lights once again. He loves this place very much. The food is bloody awesome, the owner and staff are super friendly, it's a muggle place so there's minimal chance of running into the wizarding press, and most importantly, this place reminds him of his first-ever vacation.</p>
<p align="justify">His mood is now significantly brighter ever since he entered the restaurant. The only thing that would make this early lunch even more special is if Hermione's here with him. <em>Oh well, I could always visit her flat later…</em></p>
<p align="justify">"Harry? Is that you?" His happy thoughts were interrupted when he heard a very familiar voice that he's never heard in many years.</p>
<p align="justify">"Du – Dudley?" He gasped. This man looks like his cousin Dudley except he's not the fat bully he remembered.</p>
<p align="justify">"Yes, it's me," Dudley said awkwardly.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh. Er, please sit… Sit," he gestured to the empty chair.</p>
<p align="justify">"You won't mind if Mum and I join you?"</p>
<p align="justify">"No! Of course, not! Please, sit," he reassured his cousin. Dudley took the seat across from him and his eyes looked around the restaurant.</p>
<p align="justify">"Mum should be around soon. She went straight to the loo as soon as we entered the restaurant," Dudley explained.</p>
<p align="justify">"You look good, Big D. I hardly recognized you," he tried to make small talk. Dudley chuckled.</p>
<p align="justify">"Yeah, thanks. Er, I was forced to lose weight when Dad died," his cousin sighed.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh, I am so sorry – "</p>
<p align="justify">"Dudley? Ha- Harry?" His condolences were interrupted when he looked up and saw his Aunt Petunia standing a few feet away from them. His Aunt wore her hair longer now and she seemed to have aged so much. Also, her clothes were not as ostentatious as the ones she used to prefer when he was living at Privet Drive.</p>
<p align="justify">"Mum! Look who I found!" Dudley turned to his mother and beckoned her to join them. With a gobsmacked look on her face, Petunia Dursley slowly walked towards their table. She took the seat beside her son and watched Harry with a look of disbelief.</p>
<p align="justify">"Harry? It's been many years…"</p>
<p align="justify">"Hello, Aunt Petunia," he greeted with a kind smile. Despite all the harsh treatment he received from the Dursleys, he cannot help but pity his aunt. She looks so altered now. Her husband's death took a toll on her.</p>
<p align="justify">"Wow! You look good!" She said with amazement and he chuckled.</p>
<p align="justify">"Er, thanks." He honestly doesn't know how to respond to that.</p>
<p align="justify">"<em>Nay </em>Potter, more guests I see," Mr. Amudee placed the complimentary appetizer on his table.</p>
<p align="justify">"Ah, yes. Can you please give my aunt and cousin a menu, <em>Nay </em>Amudee," he smiled at the kind man.</p>
<p align="justify">"Why don't we just follow whatever it is that Harry ordered?" Dudley suggested and her mother nodded.</p>
<p align="justify">"Good idea! <em>Nay</em> Potter knows what to order here ever since he and <em>Saw swy </em>My-nee entered <em>Xahar </em>while holding hands," Mr. Amudee teased with a knowing smirk. Harry only rolled his eyes. The restaurateur always jokes about his friendly relationship with Hermione. With a cheerful wave, he is off to the kitchens to make additional orders.</p>
<p align="justify">"My-nee?" Dudley asked.</p>
<p align="justify">"That's what Mr. Amudee calls Hermione," he explained.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh! Yes, I remember! Hermione! You're drop-dead gorgeous girlfriend. The one with a picture on your nightstand," Dudley's eyes dawned with understanding. Harry gave out an awkward chuckle. Even up to this day, Dudley still believes his white lie about the nature of his relationship with Hermione.</p>
<p align="justify">"Ooh! Speaking of girlfriends, Dudley is getting married in six months," Aunt Petunia said happily.</p>
<p align="justify">"Congratulations Big D! Who's the unlucky girl?" He teased.</p>
<p align="justify">"Shut it, Potter!" Dudley played along and they shared a laugh. Harry doesn't know if it's the happy and tranquil vibe of <em>Xahar </em>but oddly enough, he feels at ease and relaxed as he talks to his relatives.</p>
<p align="justify">"So, what have you been up to, Harry? The only thing we know is that thanks to you, the war amongst the <em>you know what </em>has finally ended," Aunt Petunia leaned in and spoke in a quiet voice.</p>
<p align="justify">"Er, yes. That's right," he ruffled his already messy hair.</p>
<p align="justify">"Who would have thought? My skinny bespectacled cousin saving the world, eh?" Dudley teased and he rolled his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">"Yeah, well, I was left with no choice actually," he sighed.</p>
<p align="justify">"I'm sorry, Harry – "</p>
<p align="justify">"No worries, Dud. It just feels so surreal sometimes. A lot of people died in that war," he explained. An awkward silence lingered on their table until Mr. Amudee returned with their orders.</p>
<p align="justify">"Enjoy!" Mr. Amudee grinned.</p>
<p align="justify">"<em>Khop Khun Kha!" </em>He thanked the man before he beckoned his relatives to dig in.</p>
<p align="justify">"You speak Thai?" Dudley was shocked.</p>
<p align="justify">"No. Not really. Just the basics. Hermione taught me. We went to Thailand after the war," he shrugged.</p>
<p align="justify">"Tell me about this, Hermione... She seems special," Aunt Petunia pried.</p>
<p align="justify">"Mum! Harry's girlfriend looks bloody gorgeous as a teenager. I can't imagine what she looks like now. Potter, you are one lucky bastard!" Dudley smirked.</p>
<p align="justify">"Er, right. Yes, Hermione's brilliant," he agreed.</p>
<p align="justify">"I have an idea. Why don't we all come together and meet for dinner next weekend? You bring along your Hermione, Harry. And Dudley and I will bring Gemma, his fiancée. How's that sound?" Aunt Petunia suggested cheerfully.</p>
<p align="justify">"That's brilliant, mum. Except, I don't think Gemma would want to come. You know how she easily gets insecure of her looks and all," Dudley shrugged.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh. Right. Well, it'll be just you and me then," Aunt Petunia sighed.</p>
<p align="justify">"You can come to our wedding, Harry. It's just, I think Gemma will get insecure once she sees Hermione. She used to suffer weight problems so she has confidence issues," Dudley explained.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh. I see," he mused. <em>Shit! Potter, how will you get out of this?</em></p>
<p align="justify">"I met her at the local gym. I was forced to do some part-time janitorial work to help Mum with the bills when Dad died. Long story, but anyway, I met her there. And we clicked," Dudley narrated.</p>
<p align="justify">"She sounds like a nice girl, Dud. I'm happy for you," he said sincerely. <em>At least Dudley has a real girlfriend, </em>he thought sarcastically.</p>
<p align="justify">"Alright. That's settled. Let's meet here again next weekend. Saturday at seven in the evening for dinner," Aunt Petunia said and Dudley nodded eagerly.</p>
<p align="justify">"Sure. I'll tell Hermione," he agreed but deep inside he was screaming. <em>Fuck! What do I tell Hermione?</em></p>
<p align="justify">Their early lunch went on splendidly. The food is excellent just like it always is and he felt connected with his relatives as they talked. Dudley matured after his father's death and he's no longer the big fat bully who tormented him. Aunt Petunia looks aged now but she seems friendlier. Maybe she only acted that way because of Uncle Vernon, he would never know. After all these years though, he finally felt comfortable around them.</p>
<p align="justify">The <em>Xahar </em>is indeed an amazing place since despite having lunch with people he is uncomfortable with, he still felt happy. Also, it feels good to reconnect with his relatives despite their past.</p>
<p align="justify">He left the restaurant with a smile as he exchanged numbers with Dudley. The only problem is, how will he tell Hermione that he needs her to pretend as his hot brilliant girlfriend?</p>
