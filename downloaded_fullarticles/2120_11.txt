    <strong>I get up and I go down to the living room and I see dad is talking with Albus. I go to Dad's legs and Albus says " Oh looks like young Leo has come out and has something to show us." I nod and say " Hi Mr. Dumbledore I spelled my whole name by myself." He nods and says " Thats great Leo I see you will be a bright student." I nod and I go to the couch and kick my legs and wonder if I will see Grandpa and Grandma but they are with the little baby harry. </strong>
