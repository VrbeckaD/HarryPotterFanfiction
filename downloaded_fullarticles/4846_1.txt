    <p>Severus Snape was a much-hated man among children. Even with most adults, he was gruff. He was mean but deep down inside, there was a part of him he never showed. A part he was afraid to show.</p><p>If they knew, they would take advantage. He would cease to be seen as the strong man he had wanted them to believe he was.</p><p>But today, he was here on the streets of Privet Drive walking towards a nice charming home. He had been sent here when an old woman, a squib, had contacted the order about the possibility that Harry was being mistreated by his family.</p><p>Dumbledore and the Ministry had ignored this, insisting that Harry was perfectly fine where he was, that this was necessary in order for him to become the perfect chosen one.</p><p>In a fit of well-hidden anger, he had decided to pay a visit to Privet Drive on his own.</p><p>He had to check on Lily's child.</p><p>His child.</p><p>He still couldn't quite wrap his mind around the idea that the young baby of Lily had survived, and was his.</p><p>He had received the letter from Lily only three weeks after her death. Apparently, the owl that carried it had been delayed.</p><p>Severus,</p><p>I'm so sorry, I wanted to tell you for so long. I wanted to marry you instead of James long ago, but I knew as long as Voldemort was around, you would never be free of him and my son would never be safe, but I was wrong. Hiding Harry's parentage was wrong as well, but Voldemort has come for me. I only had just enough time to send this out. By the time you receive this letter, I will be gone and possibly Harry too. Harry Potter is your son, our son from the one night we spent in that beautiful room when you came in drunk from Hogsmeade. I'm sorry Severus but know this. I've always loved you and if he survives, please look after our son.</p><p>Lily</p><p>Severus had fallen to his knees, in his lonely dark house and for the first time in years, wept the tears of a broken hearted man and for all that he had lost.</p><p>Later, when he found out Harry was alive, he had convinced himself that by now, Harry had gotten attached to his Aunt and Uncle and that he was better off where he was.</p><p>And now, he was here on Privet Drive to check on his son.</p><p>Knocking on the door, he waited and heard nothing.</p><p>But inside, he could hear the desperate sound of a child crying in pain and fear, with what sounded like a man yelling, the sound of flesh hitting flesh. Rage moved Snape forward, love for the woman that should have been his put strength into his body, as he kicked down the door.</p><p>And he looked on angrily as a man stood, fist mid swing, staring at him in horror and shock at the disruption.</p><p>Severus Snape stepped forward, swinging his fist and hitting this beefy assed man square in the face, sending him toppling to the ground.</p><p>"Get your filthy hands off my son." Severus Snape sneered.</p><p>Turning, he looked at the child on the floor and wanted to cry desperately.</p><p>But not wasting time, he gathered the three-year-old boy in his arms gently, so as not to hurt him. He walked away from Privet Drive with his son held close, determined that he would be hurt no more.</p><p>Severus decided to take the Knight Bus since he now had the child with him. But it was difficult sitting on the bus with him, as he was drawing a lot of attention from the other passengers.</p><p>The problem lay in the fact that the child was covered in bruises and was in bad shape, screaming and squirming, trying to get away from him, clearly not knowing who he was.</p><p>Snape cuddled him closer as the tiny hands punched him in the chest, biting him repeatedly. Snape tried comforting him but to no avail. The child clearly believed that he was the enemy.</p><p>Snape had to endure the horrible loathing looks that he was given by complete strangers who, not knowing circumstances, probably thought he was the one who hurt the boy and was fantasising about kicking his ass.</p><p>He wanted to tell them he didn't do it, but he was too preoccupied with trying to calm Harry. He was sure they'd never believe him anyway.</p><p>It wasn't long before The Knight Bus finally let him off at Spinner's end. Snape continued carrying the small boy until he got him inside, placing him gently on the only bed he had in the house, his own.</p><p>The child looked up at Snape with wary eyes, as he removed the boy's clothes to inspect the injuries so that a potion could be brewed for him.</p><p>The child whimpered each time his injuries were touched. Seeing this, he walked away to work on the potion.</p>
