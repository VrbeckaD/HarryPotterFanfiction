    <p>Newt winced as his brother downed his fifth pint. Theseus, Tina, Jacob and he had gone to a pub near his place after the events with Grindelwald. They’d taken a floo back to England and Newt thought they should all be under the same roof and none of them had the strength to disagree. The entire thing had been a shock to them all but Jacob and Theseus were having the worst time of it. He’d suggested a drink to help them unwind and his brother had taken that as an invitation to literally drown himself in ale.<span> </span></p><p>“I think I’m gonna take Jacob home.” Tina whispered to him. Her hand went to his and he slowly interlocked his fingers with hers. It was only then that he noticed she was shaking. Tina looked up at him, her eyes gleaming with unshed tears. He could not begin to imagine the pain she was in. Queenie’s betrayal cut deep, most especially to her sister. The duo had been together ever since the death of their parents and he knew Tina felt responsible for her sister’s disappearance.<span> </span></p><p>As he looked into her eyes, a part of him couldn’t help but laugh at the thought of him being engaged to Leta. True, he’d had feelings for her at a point but they paled in comparison for what he felt for Tina. “Wait up for me.” He murmured to her. He knew his words were quite forward but Merlin sake, this was the second time he’d almost been killed in 3 months and he was done waiting.<span> </span></p><p>“I won’t be long, Thes looks like he’s about to keel over any minute now.” He said, his eyes flitting over to his brother who was signaling for a sixth pint. “If it’s not too much trouble.” He added quickly. Tina glanced down at their intertwined fingers before looking back at him. She gave him a curt nod and stood up. Her hand slowly slipped away from his and Newt already couldn’t wait till their fingers met again.<span> </span></p><p>“Alright, buddy. Let’s go.” Tina said as she urged a drunk Jacob to his feet. Jacob stumbled into her arms and she helped steady him. <span> </span></p><p>“Stay safe. The both of you.” She said and Newt nodded.<span> </span></p><p>“The same goes to you as well.” He replied and there was a hint of a smile on Tina’s face before she disapparated with Jacob. Newt turned back to his brother who was getting into an argument with the bartender and sighed. <em>It’s going to be a long night.</em><span> </span></p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Newt sat down on a bench as his brother bit into a small hand pie. He’d finally convinced Theseus to leave the pub but his brother had insisted that he was hungry so here they were at some ungodly hour in the night (or day depending on when one wakes up) getting food. He’d given up on the hope that Tina was awake, as a matter of fact, he was hoping she wasn’t because now that he had time to think, he wasn’t exactly sure what he was going to say to her.<span> </span></p><p><em>How does one say ‘Leave your current boyfriend and be with me’ in a way that sounds appealing? </em>A small sob broke through his thoughts and Newt shot upright, his hand already going to his wand. He glanced at his brother only to realize that the sobbing was coming from him.<span> </span></p><p>Theseus was staring at the pastry forlornly while tears streamed down his face. Assuming this was a fit of emotion brought on by alcohol, Newt prepared himself for some sort of nonsense to spill from his brother’s lips but Theseus’s next words shocked him.<span> </span></p><p>“She liked to put peas in hers.” <span> </span></p><p>He didn’t have to ask who Thes was talking about, they both knew.<span> </span></p><p>“It was her way of sneaking greens into my diet.” Theseus continued. “Just because you’re an Auror doesn’t mean you can’t get scurvy.” He mimicked. He dissolved into tears again and before Newt knew what he was doing, he was grabbing Theseus into a hug.<span> </span></p><p>“I miss her so much.” Theseus said in between sobs and Newt felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes. He missed her as well but it would never come close to what Theseus was feeling. He rubbed his brother’s back in what he hoped were soothing circles and just let him cry it out. This was extremely out of character for the both of them but the situation called for it. <span> </span></p><p>He held his brother for what seemed like hours but was probably mere minutes until Theseus felt stable enough to pull away.<span> </span></p><p>“I’m s-sorry.” Theseus began and Newt gave him a look.<span> </span></p><p>“You just lost your fiancée, Thes. You’re allowed to be a bit hysterical.” He said gently. Theseus nodded shakily and the two descended into an awkward silence.<span> </span></p><p>“What were you doing in Paris anyway?” Theseus asked gruffly. “I thought you weren’t interested in hunting Credence.”<span> </span></p><p>Newt flushed. “I, um, I was actually there for Tina.” He stammered.<span> </span></p><p>Theseus raised a brow and Newt’s blush darkened. ‘She’s an impressive Auror.” He said. “And a beautiful woman. Do you love her?” Usually, whenever Theseus started talk like this, it was to tease him but something about his tone said this was different.<span> </span></p><p>“I...Yes.” Newt answered honestly. His thoughts had been consumed by the darker haired Goldstein sister since he’d left New York. He’d never desired a woman the way he did her.<span> </span></p><p>“Does she know that?” Theseus asked and Newt shrugged. <span> </span></p><p>“I told her that her eyes looked like a salamander’s and she seemed to agree.” Newt mumbled and Theseus couldn’t stop a snort escaping his lips.<span> </span></p><p>“Not everyone knows that’s Newt-speak for I love you.” He said in a teasing tone and Newt sighed. <span> </span></p><p>“She’s seeing someone new so I’m beginning to question what the point is.” He replied despondently.<span> </span></p><p>“You should tell her.” Theseus said. “Life is fleeting, Newt. Don’t let her leave without knowing how she makes you feel or you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.” Theseus’ voice cracked on his last word and Newt nodded solemnly. They sat in silence for a few more moments before Theseus looked at his brother.<span> </span></p><p>“Shall we?” He said gruffly. “You’ll have to apparate us because I can hardly find my arse with both hands right now.” <span> </span></p><p>Newt bit back a laugh and stood up, pulling Theseus along with him.<span> </span></p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Newt held his brother as he stumbled along. He was planning on letting Theseus stay in bed with him because he didn’t trust his brother to actually stay put. Jacob had already passed out on the couch, his snores echoing through the house. <span> </span></p><p>Tina had taken the guest room and he expected her to be asleep but to his surprise, the light was still on in her room. Newt hesitated. On one hand, he wanted to make sure Theseus actually lived to see another day but on the other hand, he never knew when next he would get a chance to be alone with her again.<span> </span></p><p>“It’s alright, go ahead.” Theseus said, noticing his brother’s hesitation. “I’ll be alright.”<span> </span></p><p>Newt raised a brow and Theseus glared at him at best as he could. “I did manage to survive all this while without you.” He pointed out and Newt rolled his eyes. <span> </span></p><p>“Come get me if you need me.” Newt said to his brother. “I’m serious, Thes. You don’t need to put up a strong front for me.” <span> </span></p><p>Theseus sobered up and nodded. “I promise.” He said and Newt gave him another look over before letting go of him. He nervously walked up to the guest room and prepared to knock on her door only for Theseus to speak up again.<span> </span></p><p>“Oh, don’t forget to cast a silencing spell, some of us need to sleep.” <span> </span></p><p>“Bugger off, Thes!”<span> </span></p>
