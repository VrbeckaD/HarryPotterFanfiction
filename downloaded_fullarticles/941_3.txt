</blockquote><p align="left">This story, like love, is messy. It's not a straight line between point A and point B. It might have been - if the two involved had been allowed to just <strong>be</strong>. But even in the mortal world, adults think they know what's best for the children they're trying to protect. Add magic, old blood feuds, love scorned, and a whole lot of puritanical blood purity bullshit...well. Let's just say that the two blessed souls that find each other are in for a ride.</p><p align="left">How do I know?</p><p align="left">I was one of them. My name is Draco Malfoy. This story <em>has</em> a happy ending, considering everything it takes to get to that point. But it certainly <strong>isn't</strong> a happy story.</p>
