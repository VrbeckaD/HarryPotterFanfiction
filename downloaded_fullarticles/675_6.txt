</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wide brown eyes stared dully out the small window that sat a few feet above her bed on the wall her bed was against. The window was clear, giving her full view of the snow falling down onto the ground, but it was too small to watch the snow fall for more than three seconds before it hit the ground. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Well, that’s what happens when you live under the house.” She told herself reassuringly, trying to cheer herself up. It doesn’t work. The statement itself is pitiful. She couldn’t even look outside her own window to properly watch the snowfall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Missus, your mother commands your presence in the library.” She heard Matra from behind her, causing her to frown even more than before. Whenever her mummy “commands” her presence, it means that she was angry or was going to tell her to do something she won’t like.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Coming, Matra.” She called out, quickly making sure the bow in her hair was straight and neat before hopping off the bed and walking over to the house elf, blinking her eyes to find them both now in the library, her stomach churning mildly from the teleportation. Standing before them, like her daughter before her, a middle age woman stared out one of the many windows of the library. The cream white hair that was a trademark of their family was coiffed neatly on top of her head, almost resembling a crown or one of the big headwraps from their ancestral lands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “My Lady, I have brought the Missus here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “....Good. See to it that dinner is done by 830 sharp.” The woman answered without even turning around, her voice cold and stern. Like the metal of a large ship.With a low bow, Matra was gone, leaving her and the woman alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Luella.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Yes, Mummy? She answered nervously, small hands fiddling with the sheer overskirt of her dress.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Your birthday is tomorrow, is it not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Yes, Mummy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Twelve years of age. Twelve years since the day you were born. Twelve years since a squib with a dangerous affinity for beasts was brought into our family. Our highly esteemed magical family.” She droned, making Luella more nervous. It was always around her birthday when her Mummy became more angry and snapped at her more. So she stayed silent, only watching her body language. It was tense, like a bowstring ready to fire an arrow at it’s target.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “I have decided that we will not be going to visit your grandfather this year. We did that last year. This year, as your birthday gift from your father and I, we have invited a very special person to the manor for the entire day. Someone who shares your...liking of magical beasts.” She explained, causing Luella’s eyes to widen. While she was sad to hear that she wasn’t going to see her grandfather, she was surprised to hear that her parents invited a stranger over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   ‘Someone who likes magical beasts like me? Who is it? I shouldn’t ask or Mummy will take it away.’ The little girl wondered, her excitement dying down at the last thought. She doesn’t know why but whenever she got too happy, her parents would get mean again and take something away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Does this please you, Luella?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Yes, Mummy.” She answered softly, being very careful to keep her expression straight and calm. Her mummy stared down at her quietly for a while, her own face blank and closed off before speaking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “You will be given a new dress to wear tomorrow along with some new jewelry and shoes. You can thank your aunt Arsinoe for them.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   ‘Letter writing. Great.’ She mentally grumbled, not letting the annoyance show on her face. If her Mummy says she had to do it, she had to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “I will, Mummy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Good. You will receive your other presents tomorrow at dinner. Dismissed.” She commanded, Luella curtsying quickly before hurrying out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   ‘There’s someone new coming tomorrow! Someone who likes beasts! Like me! Mummy doesn’t seem to like them, which means they’re probably really fun!’ She thought excitedly, letting a small grin peek through. She couldn’t wait for tomorrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaken awake, Luella opens sleep addled eyes to see Matra laying her outfit of the day on her vanity, the broken thing tilting from the light weight placed on it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Wake up now, Missus! You have a busy day ahead of you and your mother wants you to be done with breakfast by 9:25 on the dot! Up, up, up!” The house elf rushed the young girl, darting around the room. Luella grumbled about the early hour but obeyed, quickly showering and coming out more awake.  Still drying out her hair, Luella inspected her outfit of the day, mouth frowning at the light lilac color. Her Mummy seems to really like that color, but she didn’t. It didn’t look nice with her hair.Surprisingly enough, it was a simple dress; puffy sleeves, high waistline with a long skirt decorated with butterflies and dandelions. That was how she knew it wasn’t a dress her Mummy picked out. She never lets her wear anything with animals on it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Hurry, Missus!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Okaaaay, Matra.” She groaned, quickly setting to work. It felt nice, not stiff like some of her other dresses. It was very flowy, the see through overskirt fluttering every  time she twisted and turned. She was happy to find that her new mary janes were loose enough for her to wiggle her toes, something the shoes her mother usually gives her don’t have. The bow was easy to tie in her hair, the diamond, she thinks it is a diamond anyway, hanging from the middle managing not to get tangled in her hair. She was about to call for Matra when her foot hit something. Looking down, she saw something wrapped in tissue paper half hidden under her bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   ‘What is this? Is it from Auntie too?’ She thought, picking up the object. It wasn’t very heavy and was circular with a hinge. She could feel a pattern engraved into it and what felt like three tiny jewels through the thin paper. She was about to open it when she heard a noise behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Missus, why are you just standing about?! Come now, don’t dawdle!” Matra rushed about her room, attaching jewelry to her dress, running a brush through her hair and readjusting everything before finally deeming her ready. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Come along, now! We must hurry!” Matra rushed, Luella only having enough time to shove the wrapped object under her pillow before being pulled close to the elf and apparated into the huge dining hall. Taking her seat all the way at the end of the long stately dinner table, she only had to wait for a few seconds before her mummy and father walked in. She always thought that her parents looked pretty together, her mummy’s sharp ice like eyes paired with the always simmering heat of her father’s eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “A good match,” Her aunt Arsinoe remarked once, her lip curled. “For such a cold woman.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Good morning, Luella.”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>   “Good morning, Father. Good morning, Mummy.” She responded, bowing her head in respect. As her parents seated themselves in their respective seats, her mummy looked over her closely, hands trembling slightly when her eyes narrowed at the butterflies. Only to let out a silent sigh of relief when she nodded her head in approval. No lecture today. For now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Now, Luella, mind your manners. Just because he is bringing beasts does not mean you could forget yourself. You will act your position or suffer the consequences. Do you understand me?” Her Mummy warned as they ate their breakfast, giving her a sharp, narrow glare with her cold eyes. The food in her mouth suddenly tastes empty, the constant blanket of nervousness she always wore around her parents suddenly constricting around her throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Yes, Mummy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   "Oh, come now, Josephina, we’ve trained Luella well. She will be the perfect child today, won’t you, Luella?” Her father piped up, setting his dark gaze on her. She didn’t feel as nervous with her father as she was with her mummy but that didn’t mean she could relax with him, either. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Yes, Father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Good. See? Nothing to fear. I believe we should save our worries for Mr. Scamander.” Her father said, his voice turning sour. Luella couldn’t restrict the gasp that left her mouth, her eyes wide with surprise and delight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Mr. Scamander is coming?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Yes, well,” Her mummy began, shooting a glare at her father, “I had hoped to keep the guest in secrecy but since the cat is already out of the bag, yes, Mr. Scamander will be our guest for your birthday. He is well renowned for his….expertise in magizoology. Especially for his keeping of beasts. We had thought it best for you to interact with someone who matches with your interest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luella was elated, the joy evident in her wide eyes. Newt Scamander was one of the few people she held in high admiration, his work on making people understand beasts in more ways than just killing them. And he carried beasts around in a suitcase!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Judging by the look on your face, your mother chose the right course of action.” Her father pointed out, jolting her out of her imagination and reminding her to restrain herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Yes, Father. Thank you, Mummy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Remember Luella; if any, and I mean any, problems occur that you are the source of, I will make certain that this is the last time you ever see a beast again. I will not be humiliated in front of anyone in my own home. </span>
  <b>Am I clear?</b>
  <span>” She demanded, her eyes getting sharper and colder as they always do when she got angry. It was scary, sending shivers down her spine whenever she received that look. Which was very often.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before she could answer, they were interrupted by Matra apparating by the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “Matra, what is it?” Her Mummy asked, her hard gaze turning away from Luella long enough for her to relax her already aching muscles. They were always aching whenever she was around her parents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   “My apologies, My Lady but Mr. Scamander has arrived.”</span>
