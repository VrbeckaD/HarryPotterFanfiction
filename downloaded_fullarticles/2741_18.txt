    <p>Albus doesn’t want Newt to fight against Gellert at all; it’s part of Grindelwald’s vision actually, how Newt will end up with the two of them, the missing piece they were looking for years.</p>
<p>And even though he’s not a Seer, Albus can totally see it; sweet Newt tucked in the middle of their bed at night, next to Gellert and himself, safe and completely happy.</p>
<p>But he’s gonna need some convincing; Albus is going to court him while he assures Newt he’ll just be looking for Credence, but it’s all just so Gellert can see him again.</p>
<p>And he’ll look at him, he’ll start his subtle seduction, pretending he’s attacking him, but making sure their Newton doesn’t get hurt, making sure the magizoologist believes he’s following Albus’ plan in a way that he gets closer to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>He has to trust Albus completely so Gellert takes the next step, so Gellert can prepare Newt gradually to choose his side.</p>
<p>So the three of them can finally be together.</p>
