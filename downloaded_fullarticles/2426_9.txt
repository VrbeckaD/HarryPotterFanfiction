    <p>The first thing Sherlock saw when he entered his kitchen was the light-colored owl perched in his over-the-sink window.</p><p>The genius sleepily walked over to it, glaring at it as it hooted happily and leaned into him when he removed the newspaper from it's ankle. He tried to shoo it off when it continued to just stare at him, but eventually caved and fed it a piece of bread. It hooted happily once more and then flew off.</p><p>He heard his floo ringing, someone trying to contact him, but he ignored it; it was far too early in the morning to talk to anyone. Besides, it was probably just Molly Hooper or Lily Evans Potter, once again trying to get him to come to one party or another; frankly the two of them could be so friendly it was just plain exhausting. It only helped a little that he knew they were both incredibly fierce under their polite smiles.</p><p>Sherlock flicked open a few of his kitchen cabinets, hunting for food, and made a sound of annoyance when he found absolutely nothing. With a shrug he decided to forget the food, going about making coffee instead.</p><p>A pang of irritation hit him as he heard the floo start ringing again. It went on like that for a while, starting up and then finally stopping, until it started up again. Sherlock didn't get it; it was six in the bloody morning<strike>   </strike>why was someone trying so hard to get in contact with him? Surely Molly or Lily or whoever it was could wait until a more reasonable hour to <em>chat.</em></p><p>When the coffee was ready, Sherlock took a large gulp of it, ignoring the burn to his tongue and the gross, sludge-like quality. He shuffled into his living room and then left when the shrill ring of the floo was too much for so early in the morning. Instead, he sat at his kitchen table and unrolled the newspaper the owl had brought, shaking it out to get the cylinder-shape to go away. He took another sip of coffee and looked down at the front page-</p><p>
  <em>Bloody hell.</em>
</p><p>Sherlock froze, every nerve in his body going completely still, his brain short-circuiting for a brief moment. When it finally started back up again, his thoughts began to race.</p><p>James Moriarty had escaped from prison.</p><p>How was that even possible? Azkaban was the most secure prison in the world, no one had <em>ever </em>broken out before. So how had he done it? Sherlock's mind began to turn. Well, he'd probably need an outside man, maybe even someone working at the prison. From the look at the photos there had been an explosion, so someone had to have set the bombs<strike>   </strike>the outside man. Alright, now to find the man. It was obviously one of Moriarty's followers, one of the ones who had managed to avoid capture-</p><p>"SHERLOCK!" someone yelled, snapping the curly-haired man from his thoughts. Instantly, Sherlock was on his feet, wand in hand and pointed firmly at the door. His heart was thudding in his chest, his mind still going a mile a minute, and waited as the door flew in and men began storming his apartment.</p><p>It was just like that night, all those years ago-</p><p>"Sherlock, thank god you're alright!" Someone said as they pulled the man into a tight hug. Sherlock tensed at the contact, trying to figure out what the bloody hell was going on. It was then that he recognized the faces in his apartment, not as the Death Eaters Moriarty so fondly surrounded himself with, but as the people that liked to call him their friend. Instantly, he was confused.</p><p>"Evans, get your bloody hands off of me; this is not one of your parties where you can go around giving drunken hugs to everyone you see," he said, but there was no real heat behind his words.</p><p>Lily removed herself from him, but she was grinning in amusement and clear relief, knowing his words to be harmless after years of getting to know him. Sherlock could be quite rude when he wanted to be, but to the people who considered him a friend (and that he considered tolerable) his words were never meant to truly hurt, only to try and get them to stop being so near him, since he didn't think it was a good idea for anyone to be near him.</p><p>"Holmes, I'm glad to see you're alright," Auror James Potter said with a small smile.</p><p>Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Is there a reason that you're breaking into my apartment? Or are you really all the pompous ass Severus always said you were, that you feel it well within your right to just bust in people's doors?" A muscle in Potter's jaw twitched in annoyance at the sound of his childhood rival's name, but just smiled anyway, just like almost everyone else in the room was. Happy idiots.</p><p>"Well, you were pointing your wand at the door when we entered, so you heard the news," Auror Greg Lestrade said with a sigh, sheathing his own wand. "Dumbledore wants us to bring you in, put you into protection."</p><p>Sherlock rolled his eyes and then sat back down at his kitchen table, drinking from his coffee cup. "I'm not going into the Ministry's form of Witness Protection; I refuse to just uproot my life because some <em>man </em>who happens to have a reason to hate me managed to escape from prison. I absolutely won't do it, and you cannot make me."</p><p>"Oh, you bloody child," Lestrade snapped. "This is the<em> Dark Lord </em>we're talking about here! Not to mention he broke out with twenty of his followers, which just adds to the ranks of those already out and about. Will you just come with us? John is already with Dumbledore, and you know he'll kill you if you don't show up."</p><p>At the sound of John's name, Sherlock perked up a bit. John had become his friend when Sherlock was still suffering from serious PTSD about what Moriarty and his followers had done to him. John had been struggling with his own issues, and they had become fast friends. Sherlock was steadily ignoring the fact that he really wanted to be more than friends, because John was incredibly straight.</p><p>With a deliberate and put-upon sigh, Sherlock stood up, putting down his coffee cup and moving towards his bedroom. "Fine, fine, I'll come, but I'm negotiating this whole thing with Dumbledore," when they moved to follow him into his room, he glared at them. "Don't<strike>   </strike>wait out here, I'm just gathering a few things."</p><p>Sherlock shut the door behind him, taking a moment to just lean against it and catch his breath. In the beginning, he'd been so sure that Moriarty would escape from his trial unharmed. That somehow he'd find a way to be cleared, and then he'd go right back to terrorizing Sherlock and the world. So when Moriarty was convicted, and was sent to Azkaban, Sherlock had felt, for the first time in years, a small amount of hope. It had been ten whole years since then, he'd gotten used to the idea that he'd never have to see James Moriarty ever again...</p><p>Sherlock shook his head to try and clear it, stepping further into his room. He changed into his favorite black robes and went about gathering whatever he felt he couldn't live without into a bag; his Stradivarius, a few pairs of robes, his pet skull, and the photo album that John had given to him for Christmas, just a few days ago. It was bound in beautiful brown leather, and was filled with photos of Sherlock and various people, going back as far as his first years at Hogwarts. Most of the photos had John in them, which always made Sherlock fill with warmth; he could count on John.</p><p>"Done," Sherlock said as he opened his bedroom door with a flourish. He walked quickly towards the font door, the small crowd of people parting for him as he moved. "Well? I have wards up, you know, you can't apparate in or out of my apartment; you'll have to go out into the hall." The group nodded their understanding and followed him out of his apartment; he locked it behind them. "Hogwarts, I assume? Or are we actually going to the Ministry?"</p><p>Practically everyone present winced, and Sherlock had his answer. He sighed. "Ministry, then." Then he turned, quick and efficient, aparating with a <em>pop </em>and appearing in the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic. A bunch of <em>pops </em>around him alerted him to the fact that the group from his apartment had arrived as well.</p><p>"Come on," Sirius Black said with a grin, pushing past Sherlock and weaving his way through the crowd, "Dumbledore and John are in Minister Shacklebolt's office."</p><p>When they reached the end of the Atrium, they passed by the guard's station and handed over their wands for inspection before being able to pass to the elevator bank. Lestrade pushed a button and they lurched upwards, and then sideways, and then upwards again. When they finally reached where they were supposed to be, the lift door <em>clanged </em>open, and the group of wizards stepped out. There was a large, ornate door in front of them, which Lily knocked on. A voice Sherlock recognized as the Minister's called for them to enter.</p><p>Immediately after entering, Sherlock's arms were full of a slightly shorter body, strong arms wrapping around his shoulders. After a few hesitant seconds, Sherlock hugged John Watson back, relaxing into the familiar warmth of his best friend. What could've been seconds or hours later, John pulled away, smiling in a way that was clearly masking anger and fear.</p><p>"Bloody hell, Sherlock, why didn't you answer my calls earlier? I must've flooed a thousand times! I thought that they'd gotten you!" John said with a small laugh and a light punch to Sherlock's shoulder.</p><p>Sherlock fought against a smile. "It was six in the morning!" he said indignantly, "I thought it was Evans or Hooper calling to <em>chat. </em>I wasn't in the mood for useless yammering." Lily made an affronted sound behind him, but said nothing.</p><p>"Sherlock, my boy," Dumbledore said warmly after everyone was done saying their hellos. "How are you on this terrible day?"</p><p>The curly-haired wizard shrugged. "I'm <em>fine, </em>I always knew that he would escape, so this isn't any big shock; the letters he sent me over the years made it very clear that he would escape. You all knew this, why are you all surprised?"</p><p>John sighed, "because it's <em>Azkaban, </em>Sherlock. No one has ever broken out of there<strike>   </strike>it was considered unescapable until this morning! Now, don't say that you're bloody fine and just tell me how you are doing." John's tone held no room for argument.</p><p>Sherlock had never understood this part, the part where everyone<strike>   </strike>especially John, always especially John<strike>   </strike>actually seemed to care about what was going on in his head, about what he was feeling. It just didn’t make any sense to him, the fact that people seemed to actually care about him<strike>   </strike><em>him! </em> Why anyone would was absolutely ridiculous to Sherlock. He was rude and made other people look like idiots and was practically uncaring; how was that a person that a whole group of people cared about? How was that a person that someone as wonderful as <em> John </em>found worth caring about?</p><p>“I’m a little shaken up,” Sherlock admitted slowly, quietly so that no one but John<strike>   </strike>and Dumbledore; the old man was most definitely using magic to listen in<strike>   </strike>could hear him. John’s expression softened a little, and he nodded.</p><p>One thing that Sherlock had instantly liked about John Watson when they had met was that, even though John had known who Sherlock was and what he had gone through, there was no pity in his eyes when he had looked at Sherlock. No pity, no disgust for what he'd done, only a deep understanding. It was what had made Sherlock seek out the companionship between them originally, wanting to spend time with someone who not only didn’t judge him for having PTSD or still having nightmares from his time with Jim Moriarty, but also <em>understood </em>the fact that he had something in his past to freak out over.</p><p>It was this understanding that Sherlock saw now in John’s expression; no pity, no disgust, just pure, unhidden understanding. It was something that, even after Sherlock was a prisoner of Moriarty again<strike>   </strike>because he surely would be sometime soon<strike>   </strike>he’d never forget. He loved John Watson, and he couldn’t say that about many people.</p><p>"Right, well then, what's the plan?" John said, addressing the room at large. This began the long conversation as to what would happen next; where would Sherlock go, what would they do to fight back against Moriarty and his Death Eaters. The Order of the Phoenix was called into action, Dumbledore sending out a few letters to people and Kingsley flooing others to spread the word.</p><p>The first idea<strike>   </strike>and the one everyone liked most<strike>   </strike>about what to do with Sherlock was to place him in a random house out in the countryside and put it under the Fidelius Charm so that he couldn't be found. Sherlock, of course, immediately rallied against this idea, not wanting to run and hide like some silly little scared muggle. After a long, <em>long </em>discussion, it was finally decided that Sherlock would go and stay with John, and the Fidelius Charm would be placed on John's apartment so that they'd both be protected.</p><p>When everything was settled, Sherlock and John were escorted back down to the Atrium by a team of Aurors; the team would be accompanying them out of the ministry and to John's apartment to make sure that no one harmed them on the way there, and they would preform the Fidelius Charm. Dumbledore would act as Secret Keeper, so he would be following along shortly after.</p><p>In the elevator on the way down to the Atrium, Sherlock felt John’s hand wrap around his own. He looked down in surprise and saw John’s fingers intertwining with his own. John was staring resolutely ahead, and Sherlock thought he saw a pink tint to his friend’s cheeks, but he was holding his hand nonetheless and Sherlock was happy about it.</p><p>The elevator <em> dinged </em> and then the door opened. Sherlock moved forward and then paused. Something was wrong; everything was so <em> quiet. </em> It was close to eight in the morning and twenty-one dark wizards had just escaped from prison; the Atrium should be full of the sound of the swish of robes and the patter of feet and the murmur of voices, but there was...<em>nothing. </em></p><p>“Be cautious,” Sherlock said to the group of Aurors, “wands out; there is something wrong here.” Sherlock reluctantly let go of John’s hand with a small squeeze so that he could draw his own wand, and walked forward.</p><p>When they went around the corner of the elevator bank, they all stopped short. The Atrium was still full, the crowds of Ministry workers still filling the large space. But none of them were moving, all of them standing perfectly still. There was an opening, sort of like a walkway free of people, and standing at the end of the open pathway was a group of maybe forty people, all decked out in black robes and white masks that hid their faces.</p><p>Standing in front of them was James Moriarty, grinning like a madman.</p><p>“Sherlock!” Moriarty said in a sing-song voice and began striding quickly forward. All of the people parted like the red sea for him, and a group of five of the masked people<strike>   </strike>Death Eaters, Sherlock knew they were<strike>   </strike>followed after him, the rest staying where they were. “Sherlock, it is <em> so </em>good to see you again! How have you been? Honestly, I’m hurt that you never replied to any of my letters!”</p><p>The Auror team finally jumped into action, moving to surround Sherlock and began firing off curses and other spells, engaging the Death Eaters in battle. Sherlock recognized Sebastian Moran’s fighting style amongst them, along with Irene Adler’s, and tried his hardest to fight along with the Aurors<strike>   </strike>he was pretty skilled himself<strike>   </strike>but the red-covered wizards kept trying to push Sherlock back, and they were so outnumbered and they were <em> losing, </em> so Sherlock wanted to fight as well. And then, before he knew it, the Aurors were all down, either dead or unconscious or subdued, and John was pulling on his hand for them to run, begging him to run, but Sherlock couldn’t move because Moriarty’s eyes were on him with familiar intensity, was getting closer and closer and he couldn’t <em> think- </em></p><p>“Sherly,” Moriarty cooed when he was less than ten feet away, Moran and Adler and three others right behind him. “Oh, <em> Sherly, </em> I missed you! Did you miss me?” He grinned, a mad little thing, and Sherlock, for the first time in a <em> very </em>long time, didn’t know what to do. In his hesitation, Moriarty’s eyes drifted to John, who was still holding Sherlock’s hand and standing a bit in front of him. His grin turned harsher, little more than a baring of teeth. “And you must be John Hamish Watson<strike>   </strike>I’ve heard far too much about you. You seem to be in my way, quite literally,” his eyes flicked down to their intertwined hands again, and Sherlock heard John gulp, but the shorter man lifted his chin and looked Moriarty dead in the eyes.</p><p>Moriarty’s attention turned back to Sherlock, and the criminal mastermind licked his lips. “This doesn’t involve your <em> pet, </em>Sherlock, so how about we remove him, hmm?” Suddenly a bolt of red shot out from behind Moriarty and hit John square in the chest. John crumpled to the ground and Sherlock dropped down to his knees with him, to make sure that he was alright. Finding a pulse, Sherlock felt relieved that he was just unconscious, and stood back up to face Moriarty.</p><p>"Aren't ordinary people adorable?” Moriarty said with a smile, attention fully on Sherlock, just like always.</p><p>“Are you going to kill me?” Sherlock asked, no fear in his voice.</p><p>Moriarty rolled his eyes, scoffing, and took another few steps forward. He watched Sherlock the way a predator watched its prey, and Sherlock couldn’t help but be reminded of how that look used to thrill him, used to make him feel wanted-</p><p>“Kill you? Eh, no. Don’t be obvious, Sherlock, that's what the regular people would think; I’d never kill <em> you</em>,” the madman's grin widened, and he took another couple steps towards Sherlock, so that he was only a foot away from the curly-haired man. He rose his hand and placed it to the side of Sherlock’s face, cupping the taller man’s cheek. Sherlock fought against the two instincts in him; one telling him to flinch away, the other saying to lean towards the contact. Towards Jim.</p><p>“What, exactly, is the plan, Moriarty?” Sherlock asked in the most unaffected voice he could manage at the moment.</p><p>Moriarty sighed, stroking his thumb over Sherlock’s cheek and making the taller man shiver. “I miss the time when you called me Jim, Sherlock. Remember how we used to be? Partners in crime, the two of us against the rest of the world?”</p><p>Sherlock shook his head sadly. “That was before you went insane.”</p><p>Moriarty laughed. “I was always insane.”</p><p>Sherlock nodded, conceding that point. “True,” he said. “Then it was before you declared war in the Wizarding World and started letting your men torture me and innocent people. Before you stopped caring about what was right in front of you and just focused on the bigger picture. It was before you <em> became </em>Moriarty, and stopped being James.”</p><p>Moriarty sighed once more, and removed his hand from Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock felt the loss. “Alright, I guess I knew that you’d say that. Onto plan B,” he paused for a moment, just looking at Sherlock, and then gestured at all of the people around them. “All of these people are currently under the control of me and my followers. You will come with me, of your own volition, and do everything I ask of you. In return, I won’t kill your friends. We’ll be taking a few people<strike>   </strike>including your <em> John</em><em><strike>   </strike></em>with us, of course, as insurance. Do we have a deal?”</p><p>“No! Sherlock, don’t!” Lily called out from where she was being held captive. “Run, Sherlock! He’ll just use you and your powers again!”</p><p>Sherlock’s head snapped towards her, one of the only people he considered a friend, and snarled when the man holding her slapped her. James Potter yelled insults and death threats to the man, and Lily made assurances to him that she was fine, and then cursed the man out herself.</p><p>“If I go with you and do everything you ask,” Sherlock said slowly, wanting to make sure he had all of the terms straight, “then you won’t hurt anyone here. What will happen to the people you take with you?”</p><p>Moriarty shrugged. “They’ll be fine, as long as you behave. Properly fed and watered, like the good little pets that they are. I’ll only hurt them if you refuse to do as I say. Are we understood? Do we have a deal?”</p><p>Sherlock hesitated, ignoring Lily’s and Lestrade’s yelling for him to not do it. They knew how powerful he was; they knew that if he worked under Jim Moriarty again then the Ministry was practically doomed. The combined brain and magical power of James Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes was be an unstoppable force. But Sherlock had to do it; some of the only people he cared about were in this room, being threatened. <em>John </em>was being threatened. How could he say no?</p><p>“We have a deal.”</p>
