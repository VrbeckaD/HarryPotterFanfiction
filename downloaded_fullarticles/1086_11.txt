  <em>"You're worthless!" He yelled, throwing a bottle of wine at me. I ran to the opposite side, closer to the door, and used a spell to levitate my luggage to my hands. My cat, Genevieve, was already inside her box, looking up at me with terrified eyes. "You're just like that bitch mother of yours! She left me! She left both of us!" He yells, breaking anything that's in his way. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I shake my head. "You left her. She wants me, I'm her daughter. It was your choice to leave her, to lose her. Now it's my choice to leave you. Have fun at your wedding." I say and sigh, shoving my train ticket in my bra and opening the door. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I look at Gerard one last time. His dark blue eyes face me, his black hair is messy. I run a hand through my hair, the only thing I have that I got from him, and whisper three last words. "I love you." And shut the door behind me. <br/></em>
</p><p>
  <em>'I can't take this anymore.' I think, covering my bruises with the sweatshirt. 'It was a wise choice to leave.' </em>
</p><p><em>-</em>September 1st, Third Year, Zabini's Manor- </p><p>I wake up early with the sound of my brother trying to destroy my bedroom door. I sigh and get up, quickly slipping on my slippers and walking to the door. I rub my eyes, and Blaise's worried eyes meet mine. "What's wrong?" I ask, letting out a yawn. </p><p>"Today's our first day back at Hogwarts." He tells me and I nod. </p><p>"Yes, I'm aware of that." I chuckle and he enters my room. "Well, you're welcome to come in." </p><p>He rolls his eyes before facing me again. "You shouldn't have come. Not now. There's too much going on." He says and runs a hand through his perfectly combed light brown hair. I've always hated his hair, because it's really beautiful, like mother's hair. But mine... Oh, no. Mine is dark, like my father's. I shake my head before frowning.</p><p>"What do you mean?" I ask, sitting on my bed while he walks through my room. </p><p>"Is dangerous, Lay. Things are going on now, and... I don't want you getting hurt." He says, locking his eyes with mine. I'm glad my eyes and his are the same colour, hazel. That's from our mother, and I like it, even if, when I'm stressed, my eyes might change colour, because I have this weird genetic illness.</p><p>"I can take care of myself. I did it for thirteen years, I can do it now." I tell him, folding my arms. </p><p>"You... You don't understand." He sighs, heading to the door. "Just promise me you'll be careful this year, especially if you get sorted to Slytherin." He says and I nod, there we go again. </p><p>My mother was a Slytherin, now she's a famous model, fashion designer and singer. My father was a Slytherin, now he's a famous lawyer and alchemist. My brother is a Slytherin, and he's... Well, he's an idiot, but I'm sure he'll have a bright future. Not being in Slytherin means that I'm not an actual part of this family, which I don't care. I don't really know if I want to be a part of this family.</p><p>I used to love the stories my father told me about my mother, Mirella. She was always smiling, her voice was like an angel's, and she was the sun of his life. But, when I got here, I received a cold hug from Blaise, and a weak smile from my mother. Blaise says she's going through some hard times in her career, because someone wants her to stop being a model, and concentrate on the designs for her new collection. </p><p>I just want to see her happy. She's gorgeous. Her dark skin, her bright hazel eyes, her light brown hair... She's perfect. I always wished I was that perfect. But maybe Blaise is right, maybe this was a horrible idea. On the other hand, being here is much better than being in France, than being in Beauxbatons. I know that here, in England, people will know who I am because of my famous mother, not because of my drunk father. I don't need to hear any more comments about him, I just want to forget.</p><p>I finally look up at him. "I'll be careful, Blaise. I promise."</p><p>He nods, looking at me with his usual smirk before saying: "Get ready, breakfast's in five, we're leaving in 15." He winks and closes my door, leaving me dealing with my own thoughts. </p><p>**</p><p>The thing about having breakfast with my family is that no one seems to want to say anything. My mother, for example, always stares at her food before picking the right things, just like I used to do when I was, like, four. My brother always seems more involved in his thoughts, and he's usually reading letters from his friends, usually from a boy whose initials are D.M. </p><p>I don't know who this boy is, but Blaise always tells me they're really good friends, even though something tells me that this boy, whoever he is, has something to do with the problems Blaise keeps mentioning. </p><p>As about me, my mother already told me that reading on the breakfast table is really rude, so I just eat fruit, drink a little bit of juice, and rush to the bathroom, to brush my teeth.</p><p>I turn on the tap, so it actually sounds like I'm brushing my teeth. Then I make a messy bum with my curly hair and kneel in front of the toilet. I don't know for how long I've been doing this, but, now, it just feels like a habit. </p><p>I look into the mirror, touching my cheeks. Merlin, I look like a pig. I can't look like a pig, I'm a Junior Model for my mother's company, looking like a pig is not an option. </p><p>As I rush out of the bathroom, Cressida, our house elf, hands me a bag with money and another with my lunch, for the train. I smile and thank her, even though I know I won't spend so much money, and I'll probably just give my lunch to Blaise, since he loves to eat Cressida's food.</p><p>"Have fun, my kids. And Blaise, take care of your sister, it's the first time she'll be there." Mother says and I roll my eyes, smiling a little. </p><p>"Mom, he's not that much older." I remind her, and she hands me a warm smile. A genuine smile. I tried to smile back at her, but as she leaned down to face me, I saw the necklace. That necklace again. The same the blonde man gave her three days ago. He came alone, his whiteish blonde hair reaching his shoulders. I didn't know what it meant, and something tells me I don't want to. </p><p>"I know, my love. But I want to make sure my little girl is good and healthy. I'll write, okay?" She says and I smile. "Please, behave." She leans closer to kiss my forehead and Blaise's, and with that, we step on the fireplace. </p><p>I hate travelling by floo powder, I always feel like I'll throw up and end up passing out. Luckily, Blaise held my hand and I could support my weight on his. "You okay?" He asks as we arrive Neather Hall, a Magical shop in front of the Train Station. A lady dressed in blue smiles at us, she must be around 16, and Blaise winks at her before we take our carts. The girl bites her lips, I bet she wouldn't if she knew he's only 14. I roll my eyes as I place my stuff in the cart, and drive with Blaise to the Station.</p><p>"Could you not do that?" I ask. </p><p>"Do what?" He chuckles, showing his sparkling white teeth. </p><p>"Flirt with everything that has boobs." I roll my eyes. "It's disgusting."</p><p>"You say that because you haven't met my friend, Draco." He says with a smirk. "Now <em>he's </em>a flirt. No girl can resist him."</p><p>I sigh and roll my eyes once again. "First of all, if he's like you around girls, I don't really want to meet him, second of all, fuck off." </p><p>He laughs. "Said the girl that never dated, or kissed, and is an angry little virgin." </p><p>"Shut up." I say. "No one needs to hear this." </p><p>He smirks and we finally arrive at Platform 9 3/4, he checks for the traffic of neverending muggles and nods at me. I take it as a sign to go first and run in the direction of the wall, still not understanding why British wizards have to make everything so complicated.</p><p>In one second I'm on the other side, looking at the many families that came to leave their children. Younger kids seem scared, older kids seem happy, and my brother, who soon arrives after me, looks like he's just arrived home. "Where do we walk now?" I ask him and he points at a train, I nod and follow him. As we walk, his eyes scan the perimeter, looking for something that seems important, and, when he finally finds it, he smiles. Not a smirk, but a genuine sparkly smile, like I've never seen before.</p><p>"I'll be right back." He says before rushing to a tall black-haired girl, that is obviously from Slytherin and was gifted with a beautiful set of light green eyes, that are shadowed by the cold scary look in them, but soon seem to soften a little bit as she starts chatting with Blaise.</p><p>After about ten minutes of awkwardly watching them, in the hopes that my brother will remember my existence and help me not enter the train by myself, I give up and ride my cart to the queue, waiting patiently as everyone hands their luggage and walks in. As every single line formed by human beings, mindless talk is going on in front and behind me. </p><p>In front of me, two first years discuss about the importance of magical creatures, and one of them proudly holds a copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them; meanwhile, behind me, two girls who seem to be around my age, therefore, Third years, twirl their hair and chew gum, like a fucking muggle tv show parody.</p><p>"Oh, dear Lord. Have you seen him?" One of them, the blonde, says.</p><p>"Ugh, yes. He's so hot. I need a piece of him asap." The brunette says, making me realise she's American.</p><p>"Didn't you hook up with him, like, last year?" The blonde asks, chuckling. That's something else I don't understand about Britain, everyone seems to start their sexual lives WAY too early, compared to other places... Well, except for America. Everything is legal in America.</p><p>"Yes, but it doesn't hurt to do it again, does it?" The other girl replies, and I have to forcefully remind myself that everyone is free to do whatever the fuck they want, or, in this case, whoever, and even though those wouldn't be my choices, I shouldn't forbid anyone from having their own.</p><p>As the line moves, I take a few steps forward, not even realising I'm about to bump into something until I do... Or better, someone. I hear the girls behind me gasp, then the brunette pushes me aside, smirking lightly at the boy, her face is covered with makeup, and it looks kinda cakey but still makes her look beautiful, and her clothes are so short and tight that I kind of feel embarrassed about my own clothes. "Hey, Draco." Her high pitched voice say and I almost gasp. Draco? As in Draco, my brother's best friend? As in D.M? Merlin, he's actually kind of cute, but at the moment I see his smirk, I just want to punch him in the face.</p><p>"Hey, Cora." He greets the girl. "How was your summer?" He asks as he pushes his things to the luggage man. The man sighs and makes an effort to hold everything up. </p><p>"It was amazing, but I missed you... Maybe we could... Talk, later." She asks, playing with her hair. </p><p>He laughs and nods, his head turning to me for a second, and I can finally see his eyes. </p><p>They're cold and grey, like a snow day. I look to the ground, but I can still feel his eyes on my face. </p><p>As the girls hand their luggage to the man, Draco turns around to walk to me, after winking at the girls. "See you later, yes?" He says and they smile and nod, walking into the train. He walks on my way and I hand my luggage to the man. </p><p>"Thank you, sir." I say and he smiles at me, a genuine smile from a man who has been handling annoying teenagers all day and was probably never properly thanked.</p><p>"You don't actually need to thank him, love. It's his job." The boy with grey eyes, Draco, tells me, as he follows behind me. </p><p>I raise an eyebrow. "I was raised to be polite." </p><p>He smirks. "Are you saying I wasn't?" He asks, his eyes challenging me. </p><p>"Well, it certainly doesn't look like." I say, slowly turning around to start my search for a cabin without making an embarrassment of myself.</p><p>"Wait!" He says and grabs my arm. I push his hands away before looking up at him, my eyebrows raised. "I'm Draco. Draco Malfoy." He says and I nod. I recognize the name... Malfoy. My mother worked with his mother at the London Fashion Week, two months before I arrived. </p><p>"Okay, cool. Bye." </p><p>"No!" He grabs my arm again. </p><p>"Stop touching me!" I say, my anger flaming as I try my best to hide my arms again. "Do not fucking touch me, I did not give you permission to."</p><p>He smirks and nods. "That's not usually what I hear." </p><p>"Well, there's a first time for everything, isn't there." I say, my shy yet annoyed side kicking in as I take a safe step away from him.</p><p>"What's your name?" He asks curiously, folding his arms in an attempt to look defensive.</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek as I think about whether I should tell him or not. "Why don't you try to find out?" </p><p>"I like you already." He smirks.</p><p>"I'm not interested in sleeping with you." I state much too quickly.</p><p>He raises his eyebrows, looking dramatically offended. "Why do you think that's what I want?" I almost curse under my breath, how could I ever assume that a guy would want anything with me? I clench my jaw but refuse to let my guard down. </p><p>"I've heard of you, Malfoy. I know your type." I say determined to make him give up on annoying me so I can leave. How can my brother be friends with him? And worst, BEST friends.</p><p>"Lay!" Speaking of the devil. I turn around to find Blaise running to us, followed by the dark-haired girl, who looks at me from head to toe, her lips forming a thin annoyed line.</p><p>Well, there's something we already have in common.</p><p>Even though I understand how someone unknown can affect a group of friends, I'm already so angry at how cocky Malfoy is that I just snap. "Uhm, excuse me? Are you searching for something on my body or...?" I ask, Draco clearly enjoying the situation as he tries to hold in a laugh.</p><p>"Who do you think you're talking to?!" She asks, putting on a mean girl attitude that matches her posture.</p><p>"I don't know, miss Pug Face?" I say, my jaw clenched. Ironically, as peaceful as my mother is now, my bitch side is probably from her side of the family.</p><p>Ready to fire back at me, probably with her fist on my face, her expression seems to soften as her eyes fall on Draco. "Drakey!" She rushes to him, her arms pulling him into a tight hug. Again, the barf approaches my throat.</p><p>Draco's eyes meet mine as the girl holds his hand. I'm not even surprised as I realize her protectiveness is probably because her boyfriend is a jerk.</p><p>"Well, if we're done here..." I start, ready to leave before being, once again, interrupted.</p><p>"How do you know each other?" He asks alternating his gaze from Blaise to me and so on. "Are you dating?" I raise an eyebrow and look at Blaise, then, we burst into laughter.</p><p>"What's so funny?" He frowns. </p><p>"It hurts to know you didn't tell him about me, Bass." I say and he chuckles. </p><p>"Guess I just forgot." He shrugs. </p><p>"So you are?" He asks, both eyebrows raised like he's just found out about some huge secrets.</p><p>"She's my sister, idiot." Blaise says, like its the most obvious thing, and we watch as Draco's jaw falls open.</p><p>"Your... Sister? You have a sister? And she's cute?" Draco asks and I clench my jaw, I hate this word, especially directed at me.</p><p>"Watch your tongue, Malfoy." Blaise says, suddenly changing his posture to a defensive one.</p><p>"I'm his half-sister," I explain. "his mother slept with my father, second husband, and that's how I got here." I shrug.</p><p>"Oh... That's... Cool, I guess. Do you want to come sit with us?" He asks. I look at Blaise, who seems to be cool with it, but Pug Face stops me. </p><p>"There's no more room, sorry. My friends are sitting with us. You know, Cora and Micah." She says and I glance at Draco, trying to hide my smirk as he looks like he was just punched in the stomach.</p><p>"It's fine, I'll just find an empty compartment. Or make some friends." I say and look at Blaise. "I'll see you later." </p><p>He hugs me. "Good luck with the Sorting Hat." He winks. "Go Slytherin."</p><p>"Yeah, whatever." I say and turn around, holding Genevive's box near me as I search for a compartment.</p><p>After what seems like a decade, I find one that's not totally full. There are three people in it, a girl and two boys. I knock shyly before opening the door, their heads turn to face me. I blush. "I... Uh..." I start. "D-Do you mind if I sit here?"</p><p>"No." The dark-haired boy says, his hair a few shades darker than mine, like ink black, and he sports beautiful green eyes. Not cold green, like Pug Face's, but warm, charming and cosy ones. He gets up and takes my hand, pulling me to his side. He doesn't seem to notice what's he's doing, because once he let's go of me, noticing how uncomfortable I am, he blushes deeply. "I... I'm sorry." </p><p>"It's okay." I say, keeping my hands close to my body. "I'm not the biggest fan of human contact."</p><p>The girl in front of me smiles warmly, her amazingly curly hair falling on her shoulders, while her chocolate brown eyes seem to smile alongside her lips. "I'm Hermione Granger." She says, putting her book down. "This is Ron Weasley." She points at the shy looking redhead. "And that's Harry Potter." She says, pointing at the boy who grabbed my arm. </p><p>I tilt my head to the side, Harry Potter? Oh, sure! He goes to Hogwarts too. I smile at them. "I'm Layla Hilton." I say, not really wanting to mention my last name, but Hermione seems to get it.</p><p>"Wait, you're Mirella Zabini's daughter, right?" She asks and I nod. "Blaise's sister." She tells the boys, who seem confused. </p><p>"Blaise's sister? But you seem so nice." Ron says with a confusedly adorable look. </p><p>"Ronald!" Hermione hisses and I chuckle. </p><p>"No, is okay. He's pretty much a dick." I smile shyly at Ron, who smiles back. </p><p>"So, you're joining Hogwarts this year?" Harry asks and I nod. </p><p>"I was from Beauxbatons," I tell. "My father decided to get married again and... Well, I decided it was time to visit my mother." I say, not really wanting to talk about it. Harry seems to catch on, for he doesn't ask anything else about my family. </p><p>"Beauxbatons? How was the system there? The houses?" Hermione asks.</p><p>"We had four houses, just like Hogwarts. Bravoure, the house of the Brave; Réalisation, house of the Ambitious; Grâce, house of the pure and friendly; and Raison, house of the Smart. Every time someone was sorted, we entered the house and got a bracelet, that had one or two symbols on it. Like, you could be sorted to Grâce, but your bracelet could have a green heart, for Raison." I explain. </p><p>"What house were you from?" Hermione asks. </p><p>"I was from Raison, but my bracelet had the red dragon of Bravoure and the lightning of Réalisation," I explain. </p><p>"So you're smart, brave and ambitious." Harry says and I nod. </p><p>"In thesis, yes." I nod.</p><p>"Do you think you'll get Slytherin?" Ron asks. "Because of your family?" </p><p>I shake my head. "I don't really care." I shrug. "I know my mother wants me in Slytherin, as does my brother, but I don't care about the House, and, personally, I don't want to be on Slytherin and have to face Draco and Pug Face every day." I blurt.</p><p>"I already like you, Layla." Harry says and I smile shyly, looking down.</p><p>"Thank you... And call me Lay. Somehow, my mother managed to start my first and middle names with 'Lay', I guess she thought it added to the whole thing."</p><p>"My middle name is James." Harry comments. "Because of my Father."</p><p>"Mine is Bilius." Ron smiles. </p><p>"Jean." Hermione chuckles. "But I hate it. Yours?" </p><p>"Laycee. It means Lace; unbreakable thing. It's french." I roll my eyes.</p><p>"It's beautiful." Harry says and everyone looks at him, as I look to the ground, blushing. </p><p>Hermione looks at Ron, and they giggle, making me even more embarrassed.</p><p>"So..." I clean my throat, looking at Hermione's hands. "What book are you reading?" </p><p>"Pride and Prejudice." She smiles. "By..."</p><p>"Jane Austen! Are you kidding? She's my favourite muggle author!" I say, taking a copy of Netherfield Park from my backpack. </p><p>Hermione smiles and looks at the book, showing me hers. We giggle and start talking about it. "I think we're going to be good friends." Hermione says and I nod. </p><p>"I hope so." I smile, looking at the boys.</p><p>Harry smiles and looks at Ron, who raises a red eyebrow.</p>
