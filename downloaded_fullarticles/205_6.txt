    <p>"Gorlois and Uther will buy us as much time as possible." Tywin Lannister said as he entered the room where Harry Potter, Sanguini and a pale, ginger man stood.</p><p>Sanguini asked as he straightened up,"What should we do?"</p><p>"Magnus, is it possible for you to send us back in time?" Tywin mururmered </p><p>Magnus answered calmly,"Yes, in theory, I should be able to send our memories back to our past. When do you want them sent back?"</p><p>"The day Harry was placed on the doorstep of the Dursleys-" Tywin was cut off as the four heard footsteps running up the corridor outside the room. A second later, Gorlois Lefay burst into the room with blood dripping from his armour.</p><p>He cried,"They are coming!"</p><p>Tywin turned to the north wall and touched a brick that was sticking out, it swung open to reveal a dark tunnel. He stepped into it with the other following behind him, they ran down the great tunnel.</p><p>Harry turned his head back and saw men in black cloaks and soldiers made of ice chasing after them. Gorlois stopped and drew his sword before saying,"Go! I hold them off for as long as I can."</p><p>Harry was about to protest when Sanguini grabbed his arm and pulled him down the corridor. Magnus muttered something incomprehensible and some of the stones above them crashed to the floor and blocked their enemies from reaching them.</p><p>They reached the end of the tunnel and walked out of a wrought-iron door to see a ship waiting for them at the docks. Tywin led the way down the steps and to the ship, where Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth had their swords drawn.</p><p>Stannis asked,"Have they found us?"</p><p>"They have." Harry confirmed.</p><p>"Right, get on." The group climbed on board the ship where a small group of soldiers were waiting for them."Davos take the wheel and get us as far away from King's Landing as possible.</p><p>The ship pulled out of the dock quickly as the group watched the Red Keep smoulder in he distance. Magnus announced,"I will need five days to prepare for the ritual to send our memories back in time, Tywin."</p><p>"You shall have it then." Tywin replied as he looked over a map that was next to the door that led to the captain's cabin. </p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Harry looked out at the sea as the sun began to set, he thought about he mistakes that they had made. They had severely underestimated the combined forces of their enemies and the forces of the Ancient Vampires, Elves and Dwarves.</p><p>He was so preoccupied with his thoughts he didn't notice Sanguini approaching him until the Vampire wrapped his arms around the younger boy's waist, he muttered,"What's wrong?"</p><p>"I was thinking about how differently this could have went if we didn't anger the Ancient Beings."</p><p>"It wasn't your fault, we just didn't get a alliance with them in time. Same with the Goblins, Werewolves, Giants, Merfolk, Centaurs and Elementals. We are going to have a second chance though."</p><p>"I know but how long will I have to parted from you?" </p><p>Sanguini took Harry's right hand in his as he said,"Worry not, we not be parted for long but I think Magnus will allow you to take this with you." He removed a golden ring from his left middle finger and placed it in Harry's hand. "This will make sure you are safe for as long as we are parted."</p><p>Harry smiled before waving his hand to extinguish the candles in their cabin. The room was filled with darkness as Sanguini approached his lover.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Davos sighed as a soldier took the wheel of the ship, he turned to where Stannis was standing and approached him. Stannis smiled when he saw him and said,"How did you know they needed help?"</p><p>"It was a hunch. At least it was right otherwise this could have ended very differently today." Davos replied.</p><p>"Yes it could've. If only Renly was here now."</p><p>"Renly died the way he wanted to by dying defending his family's honour. At least he was able to be public about his relationship with Loras."</p><p>"That's true." The two men fell silent until Stannis said,"I have a idea about Tywin's plan for when we got back in time. I believe he will have Sanguini meet with Magnus and collect Harry from his relatives while us three deal with Robert."</p><p>"He would probably think of a plan like that. Now we had better retire to our cabin."</p><p>Stannis nodded and the two retired to the captain's quarters.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Tywin looked at the young Warlock fast asleep on their bed, he ran his fingers through the soft, ginger hair as he tried to get the sleep.</p><p>Magnus mururmered groggily,"What's up?"</p><p>"Nothing. Go back to sleep." Magnus closed his eyes again and fell into a dreamless slumber again.</p><p>The Lannister Lord blew out the candle on the bedside table and settled down to sleep. He kept thinking about how travelling to the past would work and what they would change.</p><p>These thoughts troubled him so much that he wasn't able to sleep that night or even to try to get some sleep. He got out of bed as soon as he saw that dawn ahd broken and the sun was rising.</p><p>Tywin walked towards the window and looked out of it to see the idyllic sea. He looked at his lover and sighed tiredly.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------‐----------------------------‐--------</p><p>Magnus ushered the others into a newly drawn rune circle before he began to chant in Gaelic,"Tha mi a ’gairm air an Dia Janus. Gus am bòcain aige a thoirt dhuinn agus leigeil leinn siubhal air ais ann an tìm."</p><p>A golden energy swirled around the room as a god with two faces appeared in the room. Janus boomed,"Who are you to summon me?!"</p><p>"I am the Warlock of Europe, the White Mage, the Wise Alchemist and the Grand Enchanter!" Magnus called.</p><p>"What do you wish, Son of Hecate?"</p><p>"We wish for you to grant us the boon to send us into the past and change the future."</p><p>"If I agree then you must pay a price later in your life."</p><p>"What price?"</p><p>"You must finish some of my business on Earth for me."</p><p>"I agree." Janus nodded and waved his hands. The energy grew stronger as the group vanished from this time and reappeared in 1981.</p>
