    <p>“Thought your sneaking about days were over,” a posh, stilted voice carried through the corridor, before immediately spitting out, “Potter”. </p><p>The boy in question whipped off his invisibility cloak at the far end of the hall. Ron was bewildered. He'd known Harry with his deathly hallows cloak and his incurable addiction to sneaking about for the past eight years, but he had never figured out a way to see through the charm. Ron, a bloody Prefect on patrol, couldn't catch his best friend wandering about the halls at night, but Malfoy could?</p><p>“What trouble are you getting into, Potter?” he drawled at Harry’s gape.</p><p>“I could ask the same thing, Malfoy,” recovering slightly from his shock, he scoffed. “You're not actually a Prefect anymore. What’s your excuse for tramping about after curfew?”</p><p>“Nothing of nefarious purposes, I assure you,” Malfoy sneered.</p><p>“Forgive me if your word means nothing.”</p><p>“You testified at my trial, didn't you?”</p><p>“Another thing you’ve yet to thank me for."</p><p>“Fuck you, Potter,” Malfoy screeched, “You don't deserve my thanks."</p><p>For now, Ron just waited in the shadows on edge, with one hand hesitantly wrapped around his wand. He could only watch as the once whispered insults raised in volume and became viciously aimed words. They grew closer together as they steamed.</p><p>“You always were an arrogant little brat when we were kids.” Harry’s temper was surfacing, “Don't see why it'd be any different now”.</p><p>“-and you always played the wimpy victim, don't see how it'd be different now”. He bit out the last part, clearly baiting him, “Pity the poor little orphan Potter”.</p><p>“Better than having parents like yours, Malfoy,” his eyes burned as he moved to walk away through the door that connected the north hallway to the east corridor. Then Malfoy was quickly striding forward, slicing away at the small separation that remained between the two of them, stepping around Harry to face him and simultaneously cut off his mode of escape. Though it was Malfoy backed against the wall (or, um, door), Harry and Ron tensed, readying themselves for a potential first blow.</p><p>Indeed, Malfoy’s hands were twitching as they stood mere inches apart. It wasn't until both their faces started turning a vivid shade of puce under the soft candles of the midnight hallway that Ron knew that violence was inevitable-- but instead of the typical duel, they looked ready to resort to muggle blows. Ron, ever the perfect best mate, didn’t want to take points from Harry or his own house. So instead of intervening right away, he chose to temporarily reserve his right to claim he hadn't seen them at all. Temporarily. If the little death-eating ferret made one false move, then he'd have no choice.</p><p>Harry’s nostrils flared unattractively and Malfoy's jaw jumped visibly under the palpable tension, his teeth grinding. There was a sudden, slight pause, the heavy silence only lifted occasionally by the harsh breathing of the two wizards who stood trembling with barely suppressed rage in the center of a (mostly) abandoned hall. </p><p>“Shut your mouth, Potter” If Malfoy's look could kill, you-know-who would be a very happy monster.</p><p>“What, are you gonna run to Daddy to whine about my bad attitude?” Harry uncharacteristically sneered, slowly drawing his wand.</p><p>“No,” Malfoy said an odd lilt to his voice, like he knew something that Harry didn't, “I'm going to make you shut up”.</p><p>Harry scowled and opened his mouth to rebut, but the words were interrupted when Malfoy attacked. </p><p>There was a flash of color, a whirl of movement, as Malfoy grabbed fistfuls of Harry’s robe, whipped the both of them around, and slammed Harry against the door he was just leaning against.</p><p>Ron quickly pointed his wand at the assailant, the full body bind curse on the tip of his tongue when, bewilderingly, it was he (and not Malfoy) who became totally petrified. </p><p>Where Ron expected violence, there was the exact opposite. Well, there seemed to be a bit of biting, from the looks of it, and Ron’s uselessly shellshocked mind counted that as violence.</p><p>Instead of rapidly firing hexes, Harry’s wand, clattered to the floor in favor of freeing his fingers to thread and tug through blond hair. Malfoy’s hands were grasping Harry’s hips tight against his, and suddenly they were both gasping into the kiss. </p><p>Harry pushed away from the wall, just to push Malfoy back into the one directly adjacent to the right. Ron, strangely and mortifyingly, cheered internally that Harry was winning, before his addled brain caught up and realized just what, exactly, he was winning at. It didn't last more than a moment, anyway, before Malfoy laid a hand on his chest and slipped from Harry’s hold (‘Like the slimy snake he is,’ Ron’s mind supplied unhelpfully), and pressed Harry into the wall once again. They were travelling, Ron sluggishly realized. Each exchange of dominance took them further away from the door where they started. It was like some twisted dance that Ron couldn't understand. It was a gory splinching accident that he couldn't look away from.</p><p>And then Malfoy had Harry’s arms pinned up against the cold rock, a knee in between his legs. If Harry didn't seem to be enjoying it then Ron would have been throwing hexes. That is, if he could cast, or move or even put a coherent thought together enough to leave or even blissfully blink. But he couldn't, so Ron was stuck in purgatory, staring at his best friend making self-destructive choices due to post-war trauma. ‘That has to be it, right?’ Ron thought, ‘there's no way Harry would ever-’</p><p>And then Harry was making soft keening sounds, his head tilted back and body arched as Malfoy moved his way down his throat. He was literally offering his neck to the enemy. Malfoy shifted, so that just one hand was holding Harry hostage. It was only a semblance of control, and doubtless, he could free his arms easily. Ron waited for him to break free and come to his senses, but it didn't happen. Harry, the savior, was giving in, letting himself be pinned and controlled and manhandled by his childhood rival in this bizarre night terror causing Ron's whole world to flip upside down. </p><p>Meanwhile, Malfoy’s other hand ran down the length of the other boy’s body, disappearing briefly from view as it trailed down his outer thigh. It stopped at the crook of Harry’s knee, where it and the appendage it was attached to was hoisted up and around the curve of Malfoy’s hip. Harry made another sound that Ron would later be trying to scrub from his memory. </p><p>Just as sudden as it happened, Harry removed his hands from Malfoy’s hold. ‘Finally’ Ron thought triumphantly and still vaguely horrified, 'He and I are going to have a long talk about this'. But once again, Ron’s expectations were shattered as Harry didn't push him away, but rather groped the stone wall next to him until he was grasping a door handle. The door flung outward, and Harry used his free hand and his body weight to pull the other boy inside before the door slammed shut behind the both of them. </p><p>Once they were out of sight, Ron could think straight again. He precariously stepped out from the relative safety of his corner and crept hesitantly to the door that had swallowed his friend, who was (no doubt) either in mortal peril or currently having a mental affliction. The door looked innocent enough, simply labelled “supply closet”, and if not for the knowledge of what was in it, Ron probably would have been able to pass it during the day without the urge to vomit. He didn't want to know, per se, but he needed to know that Harry wasn't being brutally murdered while he turned a blind eye. After all, Malfoy was still armed while Harry’s wand was foolishly in the abandoned hallway. He just needed to check-- just to be certain this elaborate seduction wasn't a trap. His mind made up, Ron held his breath and lightly pressed his ear to the door to listen for the unmistakable sounds of muffled screaming and murder.</p><p>His face promptly turned red, as he felt the inaudible thumping from the inside. Ron fled down the length of corridor faster than he'd ever ran whilst fleeing from Deatheaters. In a mere seven strides he'd covered the length of the hall and shot around the corner. He proclaimed himself officially off Prefect patrolling duty for the night and sprinted towards Gryffindor Tower. He and Harry would certainly be having a talk about this.</p>
