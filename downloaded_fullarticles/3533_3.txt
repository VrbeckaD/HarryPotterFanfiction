    <p>Once in my childhood, my grandmother told me a story; a story about how I was destined for one of the greatest gifts in the world. The gift of an Echo…</p>
<p>
  <em>“Once upon a time, there were five families. These five families had been given a gift: the ability to never die, so long as the other half of their soul was still alive. This gift was passed down every three generations to only the females.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Granny, why only the girls?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“No one knows. But some say that the great beasts saw into their souls and saw purity.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Does that mean that I’m purity, Granny?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I’m sure it does, sweetheart.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Okay! Back to the story!”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Of course. These special women were called Echos. They all took their gift very seriously, protecting their other halfs with all they had.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“When am I going to be able to protect my Echo, Granny?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“When you get older little one.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I hope I get older soon.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Of course, little one.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Keep going, Granny! I want to know what happens next.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“But one family took their gift for granted, corrupting the purity of the daughter that received the gift and used it to cause havoc all over the world. This family still lives, and they still enjoy creating chaos wherever they go, knowing that no one can stop them.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“But we’re not like them, are we? We won’t hurt people?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Of course not, little one. And as my mother told me, when you meet your Echo, everything in your life falls into place.” <em></em></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>She was right. Newton Artemis Fido Scamander was the best thing that ever happened to me.</em>
