    <p>               Instead of the boy who lived, it’s the boy with cat ears. It’s an alternate universe where instead of Voldemort trying to kill Harry Potter he just curses him to forever have cat ears and to occasionally just go ‘nya’ in-between regular sentences and he can’t control it.<br/>               So one day he gets a letter and he’s like 'Oooohhh Hogwarts’ and Hagrid bursts through the door, grabs Harry by the face, and screams, full tilt, 'YER A CAT BOY HARRY; A STRAIGHT-UP NEKO WAFER!’ Harry stares into Hagrid’s eyes, looks at him, and says, 'who are you, what are you doing in my house?’ and Hagrid looks deep into Harry’s eyes and screams 'YER COMIN’ WITH ME’ and Harry, stiff as a board, gets carried under Hagrid’s arm. He kicks down the wall and stands on his motorolla cell phone and just flies off to Hogwarts.<br/>               They crash straight through Dumbledore’s window where Hagrid dies on impact. Then Harry bounces lightly off of Hagrid’s corpse and lands face-first into Dumbledore’s butt and then Dumbledore turns around and says, 'what are you doing?’ and then he notices the cat ears and says 'oh, dear god, it’s the boy who nya’s. There’s only one way i could defeat you’ he says as he casts a spell on his jaw, which dislocates it, and subsequently turns 90% of his body into a mouth.<br/>               'what the fuck is going on’ says harry as he stares into the deep, red cavern that is dumbledore’s mouth. dumbledore leans over and just straight-up vores him and then his jaw goes back to normal and then voldemort kicks down the door, looks at dumbledore and, in a scottish accent, says 'jesus christ, ye actually did it. ye ate him whole. i was savin’ that fer later.’ and dumbledore stares him dead in the face and with an almighty 'reeeee’ he sprints and full-on bull rushes voldemort. his belly is jiggling violently.<br/>               voldemort looks on in sheer terror. with the effort of swallowing harry, all of dumbledore’s clothes fell apart. he is a naked dumbledore running at a thoroughly scared, scottish voldemort and before he has the chance to scream, he is slammed by the full force of this hundred-year-old man. voldemort is carried along for several feet before he is slammed into a concrete pillar and promptly turns into a bloody pulp. dumbledore then begins to belly-bump the pillar violently, turning voldemort into nothing but a red smear. and harry, at this point, is a broken lump of bones and flesh.<br/>               dumbledore looks on at the chaos he has created and sighs to himself. ron weasley walks in, gazes upon the carnage that has been wrought, reaches into his pocket, pulls out a pair of sunglasses and a glock, says 'time to die, old man’ and shoots dumbledore dead. he then takes of his glasses, puts his glock back in his pocket, looks directly at you, and says, 'welp, must be a monday!’ and everyone gets up and starts laughing and cheering.</p>
