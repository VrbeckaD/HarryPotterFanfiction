          <div class="userstuff"><p>Why is it so cold, Draco wondered briefly. He couldn't remember ever being so cold. His mind was foggy, blood loss and pain taking their toll on him, and the screams still rang in his ears, begging for mercy, for help, for death. The mud around him felt almost warm to the touch, wet and sticky, red with blood and clinging to every bit of skin exposed through rips in his clothes. Steps could be heard and he braced himself for another curse hitting his body; instead, a warm hand on his cheek made him open his eyes. He couldn't see. His vision was blurred, black, brown and grey mixed together, indistinguishable, unrecognizable-</p>
<p>A flash of green.</p>
<p>It was the green of kissing under the willow tree, wet lips tracing his jawline, fingers clasped on the back of his robe, the air around them unusually warm for the late days of October.</p>
<p>It was the green full of tears, bed sheets wet with sweat, soothing words and rushed confessions, the unspoken 'I love you' heavy with consequences.</p>
<p>It was the green full of anger. Just a few misplaced words, a heated discussion, old prejudice hiding jealousy, hurt, insecurity. It glowed intensely, making his eyes burn.</p>
<p>It was the green of soft-spoken words, hand holding a hand, thigh rubbing a thigh, hearts beating to the same rhythm. The first and last time.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was the green that only existed for him, in the middle of nothing, the green and the bright smile, like that day under the willow tree. A warm hand on his cheek, a heart beating along with his own, and fingers lightly touching his lips, begging him to steal a kiss, and warmth, warmth, warmth when all of the cold and pain was gone. And a whisper; full of awe and love and promise.</p>
<p>
  <i>You came.</i>
</p>
<p>And he knew that he would stay for eternity.</p></div>
