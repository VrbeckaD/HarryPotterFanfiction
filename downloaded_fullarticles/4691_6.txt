  <strong> <u>Never Piss Off a Witch-Goddess</u> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Note: The mermaid’s song is called “Mordred’s Lullaby” and it really is quite haunting, especially when you know the story of Arthur and Morgana from Arthurian legend.</em>

  <strong> <em>A Lokison Story</em> </strong>
</p><p align="center">By Sif Shadowheart</p><p><u>Disclaimer:</u>  Harry Potter and the Pirates of the Carribean franchises each belong to their respective owners.  This is just fan-fiction people, it’s not like I make any money off of this.</p><p><em>Author’s Note</em>:  This is very much a side-story and you really don’t have to read it if you don’t want to since almost nothing here will matter in the main series.  That said, Frey learns some interesting lessons in this, and has to struggle with one of his worst nightmares coming true – or so he thinks.  Also, if you haven’t ready <em>Lokison and Doors of Death</em> you’re going to be a bit lost since the set-up in this first chapter draws heavily on the events from those stories.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Part One – Trapped</strong>
</p><p>Master the Hallows, Thanatos had said.</p><p>Sure, right.  Frey thought to himself as he rolled his eyes and shadow-stepped directly from the ruins of Godric’s Hollow and into his warded-to-the hilt practice room in the Peverell Castle dungeons.</p><p>Only to jump out of his skin when he discovered he wasn’t nearly as alone as he’d thought.</p><p>“Your wards are even better here than back in the day at the Thanatos Cabin.”  Nico di Angelo commented as he leaned against the wall.  “Pretty impressive considering what we were up against back then.  What are you afraid of?”</p><p>“A woman scorned.”  Frey shot back with a smirk.  “What are you doing here, Nico?”</p><p>The son of Hades held up a scroll with a dark scowl.</p><p>“To warn you that that fear might be more on-point than you think…”  He said cryptically.  “Should I continue?”</p><p>Frey shrugged a shoulder and started walking towards the bathroom, in desperate need of a shower.</p><p>“Can you walk and talk?”</p><p>Current appearances aside, Nico actually got along better with Frey than most other half-bloods.</p><p>He didn’t judge for one, being the legacy of a death god himself.</p><p>And he didn’t hold grudges either…for the most part, over Nico’s attempts to remake his family the way some of the campers from Camp Half-Blood did.</p><p>An orphan himself Frey, and Nico might as well be considering how much time he got to spend with his dad, Nico figured the older demigod understood what had driven him to make deals with Minos and Hades alike once upon a time.</p><p>Nico waited for Frey to have stripped off and climbed into the shower stall – enjoying every minute of the view even if he did have a major crush on Will Solace, one of the sons of Apollo – then hit him with the bad (for Frey) news.</p><p>“Calypso has been freed.”  Nico heard a sound that was either Frey falling on his ass in surprise or him dropping the biggest bar of soap <em>ever.</em></p><p>“By who?”  Frey choked out a bit later.  “Not Zeus…”</p><p>Nico snorted.</p><p>Yeah, like King Asshat, only slightly less assholey than the Almighty Asshat Kronus himself, would do something like that.</p><p>Especially since it would have required a) forgiving Calypso for supporting the first Titanomachy and b) putting one of his favorite bedwarmers in danger.</p><p>Nico didn’t begrudge Frey for his open-relationship-fuck-buddies-thing he had with the King of the Gods.  On the contrary, he was rather impressed that the older half-blood had the confidence to take the ultimate man whores of the world (Zeus and his son Apollo) on, though for the sake of not wanting to bleach his brain he was hoping not at the same time.  Add in the fact that Frey had leveraged both his favor in Zeus’s eyes and his heroic endeavors into safety for his children – even from Zeus himself – and there was no doubting Frey’s ice-cold intelligence when it came to using even Zeus as a tool to his advantage.</p><p>But unless Frey moved quickly, none of that was going to help him now with a pissed-off goddess on his tail.</p><p>“No, not the Olympians at all.”  Nico leaned against the wall, one hand clenching in anger around the scroll that had born the tidings of Calypso’s freedom.  “Another half-blood, this one the son of Hephaestus named Leo Valdez.  He ended up on Ogygia during this last round of <em>apocalyptic fun</em> and swore to free her.  The putz fell in <em>love</em>,” Nico rolled his eyes.  “And didn’t stop to think.  Twitterpated idiot actually managed it too, which is even more mindboggling.”</p><p>“Well…”  Frey plotted it out objectively.  “Ogygia can be found through the Sea of Monsters, so it was always <em>possible</em>.  No one ever tried it before, is all.”</p><p>“Still,” Nico rapped his knuckled on the frosted glass serpating them.  “Figured you’d appreciate the warning after you helped pull our asses out of the fire at the Doors.  Consider it a debt paid.”</p><p>And with that, Nico faded back into the shadow, planning to come back another time and study Frey’s wards further.</p><p>Finding him hadn’t been hard after all the training the older half-blood had given him over the last several years in controlling his powers.</p><p>Getting through the wards was a different story altogether, and if it weren’t for him being genuinely afraid Frey was going to get unexpectedly bitch-slapped by Calypso’s power any day now, he wouldn’t have bothered.</p><p>At least with a warning, Frey might survive her wrath over her father’s slaying…twice and the last for a final time if the stories running around the two Camps were anything to go by.</p><p>Bob the Titan apparently had a big mouth that wasn’t just restricted to talking to Nico himself.</p><p>Pity.</p><p>Otherwise Frey might’ve gotten a pass for slaying Atlas from Calypso, but actually succeeding in <em>killing</em> him?</p><p>Guy better have his affairs in order, women – and goddesses in particular – having a special brand of crazy that Nico wanted nothing to do with.</p><p>…</p><p>That night he went to Malfoy Manor, and told a story to his children, and held them tight.</p><p>Lulled by the sweet-dirt scent of childhood, Frey fell asleep there in the nursery of Malfoy Manor, still in his armored jacket and boots.</p><p>And then he dreamed once more…</p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>“Hello, Calypso.”  His voice was calm in the face of her, though they had never met, who else could she be?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Though her figure was strange, one moment beautiful even for a goddess in pouring silks the changeable colors of the sea, the next appearing as one with dreadlocks and broken teeth.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Murderer.”  Her voice sang, the tone as strange as her looks, appearing to be more than one voice.  “Murderer.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“If you’re going to kill me, Calypso.”  Frey remained calm, refusing to show fear before her.  Refusing to give her whatever it was she was after with this game.  “I suggest you rethink your plan.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh no.”  The goddess’s smile was a blade hiding a scourge.  “I won’t kill you.  I am no fool despite what the Olympians think of me.  They are content – for the moment – to overlook the breaking of my prison.  I won’t repay my Leo by forcing them to take…drastic measures against me.  And even newly released, I know whose bed you warm when of a mind.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“If you’re going to torture me with bad dreams, then I’m afraid to say someone has already beaten you to it.”</em>
</p><p><em>“No, not that either.”  Sea-blue-green changing eyes flashed dark.  “I should not have held you here, but I did not want you to misunderstand to </em>whom<em> your punishment belongs.  You took from me that which even the gods refused to take.  And for that, I have designed a punishment equal to the torment my father suffered before you murdered him.”</em></p><p><em>“You are a fool.”  Frey snorted, rolling his eyes.  “He didn’t love you – he didn’t love anyone or anything except himself and power.  </em>That<em> is what killed him eons before I took his head.  You were used.”  His tone was unrelenting.  “Get over it.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“At least one rumor of you is right, Titan-Slayer.”  Calypso spat, flinging one hand out and sending him tumbling back and spinning through empty air, her voice echoing after him.  “Defiant until the very end.”</em>
</p><p>…</p><p>“Ow.”  Frey sat up after hitting the ground <em>hard</em>, knowing ever before he opened his eyes that that had been no dream he’d been trapped in.</p><p>Instead of the scent of his children, he was surrounded and overwhelmed by the smell of the sea…and somehow too much crab.</p><p>Rubbing his head, he opened his eyes and stood, a quick glance over himself showing that he was still dressed at least.</p><p>That was good.</p><p>With the threat of a goddess’s vengeance hanging over his head, his pockets had a few things for just-in-case.</p><p>Constant vigilance and all that.</p><p>“So.”  A richly accented voice called from behind him once Frey had taken a moment to get his bearings.  Which seemed to be a tropical island of some kind surrounded by the brightest blue water he’d ever seen.  “You ar’ da one me oth’a self wan’ned punished, hmm?”</p><p>The dichotomy from the dream was explained as he caught sight of what he could only describe as a sea witch…and if the accent was any clue, one from the days of clippers and yardarms and walking the plank.</p><p>“Well…”  Calypso drawled, eyeing him up and down with her sharp dark eyes.  “Ya ar’ a pretty one I’ll give ya dat.”</p><p>“Calypso, I presume?”  Frey asked giving a short bow.  “I suppose we’re not anywhere I know, are we?”</p><p>Calypso gave a great belly laugh at that.</p><p>“No lad tha’ we’re not.”  She answered him, waving a hand at the water and sand and trees.  “Dis be de End o’ the <em>World</em>, me pretty one.  I know no’ why me oth’a self wan’ned you punished, bu’ I gave me word, and me word mus’ be honored.  You ar’ trapped ‘ere, nevah to leave, nevah to age, nevah to die.”</p><p>With each never, Frey felt as if he’d taken a blow to the gut as full understanding of what Calypso had wrought upon him.</p><p>“Ya powa’s willna work ‘ere.”  Calypso continued.  “You canna leave, unless brough’ away.  An’ at the End o’ the World…”  She cackled a bit in glee.  “Da ships be far and few!”</p><p>As she burst into hundreds of crabs that scuttled into the ocean – which rather explained the smell – Frey let himself crumple to his knees.</p><p>Who he decided to call Leo’s Calypso had been right after all – he <em>was</em> defiant until the end.</p><p>But looking around him at the towering palm trees above him and the scant shrubs and desolate cliffs, he found himself wondering just <em>why</em> he’d held onto his pride so long when this was the cost of unrepentance.</p><p>Though given the choice…he couldn’t say he wouldn’t do things exactly the same way all over again.</p><p>…</p><p>Frey didn’t know how long he sat huddled on the hot sand, or how many tears he shed as the thought of his children and his mortal friends crossed his mind.</p><p>His father and the other gods didn’t matter so much – one year or a thousand and unless there was another god-killer running around they’d still be there – but his children…Calypso must have been watching him longer than he’d realized, possibly even invading his dreams when he didn’t sleep in his heavily warded Peverell Castle, to learn of the dream that had haunted him so.</p><p>Either that, or more of his Gaea-induced visions had had a grain of truth to them than he’d thought.</p><p>Grief could cripple him later he decided as the sun began to set and the temperature dropped.</p><p>First he had to find shelter, or someplace safe to put up his own.</p><p>Gods bless his paranoia, he decided as he found a cave that didn’t have any signs of damp or water marks, high above the shoreline in a cliff facing the setting sun.  Without his healthy desire to prepare for the worst, Calypso might have very well plucked him naked from his bed, instead of fully dressed with more than a few things to make his life on this island go a little smoother thanks to expanded pockets.  <em>This</em> Calypso rather than Leo’s Calypso, had also said that his powers wouldn’t work…but he’d never know until he tried.</p><p>If she took after her counterpart’s father, then this Calypso wouldn’t have been prepared for the full force of what he could do…but that would have to wait for another time.</p><p>For the moment, he settled for digging out his wizarding tent from his pocket – a modest one compared to most with a single massive room with the bathing facilities curtained off from the rest.</p><p>Still, like all wizarding tents, at least it <em>had</em> bathing facilities and a small kitchen that ran on a permanent enchantment – and judging by the sudden coolness he felt around him, whatever enchantments were on the island weren’t designed for inactive magics like the enchantments on his possessions including the tent.</p><p>Depending on how much she knew, they might just be designed to keep him there, as his ability to use magical travel was relatively well-known compared to some of his other powers.</p><p>They would see.</p><p>For now though…he needed to mourn, at least a little, and then he would see about doing all he could to get his ass off this fucking island and back to his home universe and his children before they were dead and gone.</p><p>…</p><p>Wiping his eyes with the resolution that if this turned into as long of a “punishment” as had been implied, he would turn himself into a Frey blanket burrito one day and cry until he literally had nothing left in him, like a hollowed out canoe that had been burned clean, Frey frowned over at the clock on the tent call that seemed to be frozen – or moving so slowly it might as well be – when time clearly passed on the island if the sunset as any sign.</p><p>Trying a tempus, he gave a smirk as numbers in the same marbled green and purple and black of his magic formed over his right hand.</p><p>Wandless was working – or the Elder Wand’s power that he’d bonded on Thanatos’s advice was anyway, it was hard to be sure.</p><p>But when he stepped into the shadows, all he accomplished was running into the tent wall.</p><p>Well…it had been worth a shot.</p><p>Floo, apparating, and even his limited teleportation skills (he and his Far were still working on them since it was very much a more divinity-based power than mortal or half-blood) were all useless.</p><p>“Okay,” he breathed out, choking back the fresh wave of grief that crashed over him when all attempts at leaving the island – even turning into his jaguar form and trying to swim for it – were useless.  “Calm.”  He breathed in and out to a mental ten-count, first in English, then Greek, then Norse, then Jotnar, then Aesir, then any other language he could think of until he finally ran dry and the gut-ripping pain had been beaten back again.  “Focus.  What do you know, Frey?”  He asked himself.</p><p>He was on an island.</p><p>Calypso had sent him there as a punishment.</p><p>She said his powers would be useless, but…he snapped out a Patronus, the massive dragon that had a tinge of green and his Far’s green eyes glowing in the silvery light clearly proving that wrong.</p><p>He couldn’t leave – that one was unfortunately true.</p><p>And if she was as vindictive and vengeful as current events would suggest, then he also wasn’t going to age as she’d said either…which was good and bad.</p><p>Good was self-explanatory – he wasn’t about to go home, and by Chaos he <em>would go home</em>, only to be decrepit when he managed it.</p><p>Bad was…well.</p><p>If he wasn’t aging, then he would be stuck at this phase of <em>becoming</em> until he was released – which meant neither his immorality or his Ascension would be providing him with a power-surge to break Calypso’s spellwork…which meant he’d have to do it the hard way.</p><p>He was sure it could be done, it would just take time…time that based on the glowing numbers of the tempus when he cast it again and read: 2150, 21 December 1500, he had in spades.</p><p>Though <em>time</em>, as ever, was against him when it came to his children.</p><p>Grief crushing him and grinding him down, Frey swept one hand through the glowing numbers though noting once more that they did not measure against the tent’s clock, he flung himself face-down onto the single bed.</p><p>Tomorrow he would search the island from tip to toe, and spend whatever it took in time to find the secret to his binding.</p><p>For now…he needed rest before he lost himself to the tides of grief and anger and rage.</p><p>…</p><p>The first day wasn’t the worst – not by a long shot.</p><p>Later, looking back on it, he would say that most of that first month was a large blur of shock, rage, and sheer bull-headedness.</p><p>A week in, he found the ward stone, only to realize that Leo’s Calypso had shared more than he’d thought with this Calypso.</p><p>It wasn’t as <em>simple</em> as Frey needed to be taken away from the island and carried beyond the outer reef, which he’d swam all around seeking any weakness in the shielding only to come up empty.</p><p><em>Calypso</em> was the only one who could free him, by means of destroying the simple silver piece-of-eight that she had tied the wards to and then left lying on the beach.</p><p>He was tied to <em>her</em> and her will more than to the island, though with enough time he was certain he could unravel at least a portion of her spellwork.</p><p>Searching the island for the wardstone had at least given Frey a good idea of what he was dealing with for however long he remained imprisoned there.  It wasn’t a large island by any means, perhaps a mile around with coconut trees swaying in the ever-present light breeze that carried the tang of salt along with it, bushes and shrubs – barely any grass, mostly sand with rocks and dunes.  Some seafaring birds nested in the cliffs, and a single breed of rodent made its home tunneling in the sand for insects.  But that was it besides the teaming <em>life</em> of the sea.</p><p>The outer barrier reef took him an hour to swim too on the short side of the island, with a series of rocks jetting away from the head of the island in a curving arm that met with the far reef on the other side.  There was only a few yards of shore and then reef on the back side of this arching arm, that grew larger into a calm lagoon in the curve of the island.  Fish and turtles and shellfish and coral all lived and grew in the calm lagoon, and gave Frey another form of sustenance other than sea-bird eggs and coconuts when his food supplies inevitably ran out.</p><p>Then one morning, on the fiftieth day after he arrived, Frey woke up and rather than get up to explore or work more on the wardstone or even practice his weapons or his magic on the empty beach, he let the grief take him.</p><p>…</p><p>Two months or two years, he wasn’t sure how long it lasted.</p><p>Pain unlike any other he’d faced and conquered before crashed over him as his mind focused with feverish obsession on the picture book filled from his children’s birth until their most recent birthday.</p><p>There was Frija’s flashing eyes, here was Asterion’s sweet smile, there was Antioch’s firm stare.</p><p>On and on it went, and who knows how long it would have lasted, him trapped in his own mind and reveling in his pain, indulging in nothing but his grief and the barest amount of food to keep him alive in the dull, soul-sapping monotony of his island prison, had things truly stayed the same.</p><p>But one night, with the moon shining high and full overhead, while Frey was listlessly gathering a few coconuts to sustain him in the tent, he heard something very much different than the chitter of the small sand mice or the cries of the sea-birds, the words, for they <em>were</em> words, carrying to him on the sea wind.</p><p>
  <em>“Hush child, the darkness will rise from the deep,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And carry you down into sleep,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Child, the darkness will rise from the deep,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And carry you down into sleep.”</em>
</p><p>Frey could sense the magic twined into the words of the women’s voices, but it was <em>something</em> to remined him that he was alive…and that all he could do was pray to any god that might listen that his children might be too when he returned.</p><p>Drawn from the tent, he listened with half an ear as he padded from the tent and cave on feet long worn rough and tough from years of training to fight in any condition, his boots left inside not long after his original…<em>break</em>, the effort of putting them on to go out and collect just enough food to survive seeming far too much for so little a thing.</p><p>
  <em>“Guileless son, I’ll shape your belief,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And you’ll always know that your father’s a thief.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And you won’t understand, the cause of your grief,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But you’ll always follow the voices beneath…”</em>
</p><p>His powers rose up in response to the silky threat beneath the words, keeping him from hearing the chanting refrain that came next, but he understood the idea anyway.</p><p>This was an old magic he was hearing, the sort that in his world hadn’t been used for centuries, not since…</p><p>Frey sucked in a breath, step faltering for a moment before springing into a run, arms pumping and legs stretching, feeling the effects of <em>days-weeks-months-years</em> without being properly used…a mistake he wouldn’t make again if he was right about who he <em>thought</em> might be singing.  His feet and instincts led him unerringly out onto the farthest rock that bisected the outer barrier reef, bringing him to a stop just <em>his</em> side of the ward barrier a little more than two-thirds of the way across the wide, flat stone.  He felt his breath fly from him as he saw his tempting singers, all swimming through the waters “At World’s End” as Calypso had called it, tails flashing in the light of the moon, hair wet and dark from sea water, and faces and forms as beautiful as the Veela…though these, he thought, for all they looked to be mermaids were likely closer to Sirens as one spotted him and they turned swimming closer with flashing eyes and sharp teeth <em>just</em> peeking from between lush lips.</p><p>He held in a relieved laugh as his powers continued to muffle their song <em>just</em> enough to keep them from enchanting him…likely into becoming their next meal.</p><p>“<em>Guileless son, your spirit will hate her,</em></p><p>
  <em>The flower who married my brother the traitor.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And you will expose his puppeteer behavior,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As you are the proof that he betrayed her…”</em>
</p><p>Sinking down into sitting with his legs tucked beside his hips, Frey watched, eyes rapt, as the one who led the others in song easily came up onto his rock, staring him down with temptation written in every line of her from hair to voice to the teasing flick of her tail sprinkling him with sea water.</p><p>They stared at each other, even as she extended a hand to him in wordless offer, her song all the offer most would ever need to come with her – to their deaths.</p><p>
  <em>“Sleep, child, the darkness will rise from the deep,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And carry you down into sleep,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Child, the darkness will rise from the deep,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And carry you down into sleep.”</em>
</p><p>The cross between a mermaid and a siren and a veela – as he knew them from his world – gave a soft hiss and jerked her hand back as it made contact with the barrier, letting the words of the song fade out into the night, leaving only the soft chatter of her fellows and the lapping of the waves against the rock to break the silence of the night.</p><p>“Sorry, dove.”  Frey smiled, irony tinging his voice as he held out a hand and placed it palm-side against the clear ward that held him in as totally as it kept her out.  “You’ll have to look elsewhere for a meal this night.”</p><p>“This is the sea-witch’s work.”  The mermaid – he decided, just to make things easier…and she did have a tail – noted, eyes calculating even in the dark with only to moon to light her face.  “Has she taken to trapping her lovers now?”</p><p>The other mermaids laughed, coming to rest on their folded arms ringing the third of the rock that they could touch without hitting the wards.</p><p>“He’s a pretty one.”  One commented.</p><p>“A bit dirty though.”  Another remarked with a wrinkle of her nose.</p><p>“The sea-witch might like them that way, strange creature.”  Said another.</p><p>“The dirt’s my fault I’m afraid.”  Frey interrupted a bit sheepishly, then closed his eyes and blew out a breath at the roughness of his voice from using it for naught but screams and tears for <em>weeks-months-years</em>, time unknown.  “Here…”  He clicked his fingers, the dirt and smell vanishing as if it had never been, hair shining and clean in the light and braided back once more rather than the unkempt mop it was before.  His clothes were a little worse from wear, but there was nothing he could do about that other than use a <em>repairo</em> on them once they wore out, fabrics not taking well to repeated magical repairing.  “This should be better.”</p><p>“The sea-witch caught herself a sorcerer.”  Interest flashed anew in dark, nearly <em>ravenous</em> eyes that dragged slowly over the too-thin body revealed by the clean clothes.  “How unusual.”</p><p>“I’m her prisoner, actually.”  He said before the mermaid got any <em>unsavory</em> – for him – ideas.  The barrier <em>should</em> protect him…but why tempt fate with the turn his life had taken?  “I killed someone and was given over to Calypso to hold as punishment.”</p><p>“Hmm.  Such a waste.”  The mermaid said huskily.  “Still, we have sung for you, sorcerer.  If you won’t…join us, perhaps you might return the favor?”</p><p>“Why not.”  Frey shrugged his shoulders and thought a moment then began, thinking it…<em>fitting</em> to send them off with a song that was half a warning and half a temptation – just like them.</p><p><em>“Come away little lass</em><br/>
Come away to the water<br/>
To the ones that are waiting only for you<br/>
Come away little lass<br/>
Come away to the water<br/>
Away from the life that you always knew<br/>
We are calling to you<br/>
Come away little light<br/>
Come away to the darkness<br/>
In the shade of the night we’ll come looking for you<br/>
Come away little light<br/>
Come away to the darkness<br/>
To the ones appointed to see it through<br/>
We are calling for you<br/>

<br/>
</p><p>With a flick of her tail, the mermaid nodded her head in farewell and dove back into the water, leading her sisters away to the sound of his voice crooning after them.</p><p><br/>
“Come away little lamb <br/>
Come away to the water<br/>

We are coming for you.”</p><p>“I’m coming for you, Calypso.”  Frey whispered into the light of the moon, letting the salted sea air scour away the tears on his cheeks and his grief – leaving only his rage and defiance behind.  “I <em>will</em> be free.  And I <em>will</em> go home.”</p><p>And if anything<em>, anything</em>, had happened to his children while he was going, then Calypso would <em>pray</em> that she had killed him – and risked all the wrath of the gods – instead.</p><p>…</p><p>There was a peace in quiet rage, Frey found.</p><p>In the sweet <em>thud</em> of his daggers finding the tree he used as a target, and the whistle of his sword and spear singing through the air, and the rich crackle and snap of his magic flying through the air and coursing through his blood.</p><p>But there was also <em>purpose</em> in it as well, never letting it consume him as he’d lost himself for an endless time in his mind and his grief, but letting it shove him ever forward into, <em>yes, I’ll re-read that tome from my trunk today</em> or running another lap around the island or swimming one more relay from shore to reef.</p><p>The skin and bones of the mermaids’ first visit was gone when they came again, about six months later according to his count, heralded by another song that drew Frey – under his own will this time – out to the rocks to speak with them again.</p><p>They had sought out Calypso, they told him, asking about the stranger they’d found in her waters, only to be sent away with a snarl by the ill-tempered sea-witch.</p><p>That hadn’t sat well with them – especially the leader who introduced herself as Mara – bringing them back to his lonely island for no other reason than to spite her.</p><p>Time passed and the mermaids kept coming back, his only company other than the birds and the mice and the pictures of a children and a home that despite the years and then decades and then a century that went by, never grew dim in a mind that had been <em>designed</em> for immortality.</p><p>The passing of time had also served to cool the first flush of his fury and the quiet of his rage into ice-cold conviction which refused to waver even as he read all the books in his bottomless trunk for the hundredth time and had coconut and clams for dinner for the thousandth.</p><p>His mermaid friends kept coming, brining tales of the outside world for the price of a song, and taught him new ones in turn, Mara and the rest as ageless and undying in the magic of this world as Frey was in his captivity.</p><p>And then, one day, they brought news of a <em>different</em> kind, the sort he’d been waiting to hear for a hundred years.</p><p>…</p><p>“She’s fallen in love.”  Mara said with laughing relish, lounging in “her” place on the sun-warmed rock.  In most places, mermaids would only leave the water under the full moon, when their powers were strongest.  But here, at the end of the world, she knew she had nothing to fear from Frey nor he from her…so long as the barrier remained.</p><p>Mara could no more help her nature than Calypso hers…and it was in Mara’s nature to mate and then devour men, the stronger and more beautiful the better.</p><p>Frey was both.</p><p>Better for both of them that the temptation of each other was just out of reach.</p><p>“<em>My heart has been pierced by Cupid,” </em>Frey sang a line from the most recent song the mermaids had taught him, Mara picking up the second with a laugh.</p><p>“<em>I disdain all glittering gold</em>.”</p><p>
  <em>“Nothing can console me,</em>
</p><p><em>But my jolly sailor bold.”</em>  They finished together, Frey then asking: “He would have to be a sailor, for none other loves the sea so much as them.  And to love her is to love the sea.  Am I right?”</p><p>“You are.”  Mara idly combed her hair with the – suitably enough – golden comb Frey had conjured for her and then pushed through the barrier with his magic.</p><p>Trial and error – and a hell of a lot of practice with nothing better to do – had sharpened his skills with magic considerably.  And with nothing better to do than sit down and figure it out, bonding the Hallows that had followed him into his paradise hell had eventually come to him.  Getting <em>things</em> in and out of the wards was easy enough now.</p><p>It was still <em>himself</em> or others that were the problem.</p><p>“A pirate captain.”  Mara picked the conversational thread back up sometime later, enjoying the feel of sun on her scales and the sound of Frey’s mellow basso humming “My Jolly Sailor Bold” under his breath.  “She loves him so she charged him with a duty in exchange for making him immortal: ferrying the souls of those lost at sea into the afterlife, safe and sound.  And for every ten years of service, he could have a single day on land with <em>she who loves him truly</em>.”  Mara scoffed.  “All it cost was cutting the very heart from his chest and hiding it away on land somewhere.”</p><p>Frey whistled, brows arched in surprise.</p><p>This Calypso was certainly a cruel one, though not as powerful it seemed as a goddess in his old world, over time he’d noted that the wards that held him had been fashioned by <em>both</em> versions of the sea-witch.</p><p>“And?”  He asked.  “Does he love her in return as his empty ribcage would suggest?”</p><p>“Who knows?”  Mara shrugged.  “The sea-witch will break him anyway – it’s her nature after all.”</p><p>“Yes, yes.”  A grin tugged at his mouth.  “Still…that seems a shame.”</p><p>“Mmm.”  Mara sighed, flicking her tail in boredom.  “At least when my sisters and I feast upon a man, we don’t leave him walking around hallow and bitter afterward.”</p><p>Frey laughed at that.</p><p>“Truer words my vicious one.”  Frey closed his hand and then flicked it open, showing what he’d conjured at a moment’s thought.  “I don’t suppose you’d be willing to track down this sailor of hers and give him a…<em>gift</em> from me when she proves to be just as cruel to those who love her as she is to everyone else, would you?”</p><p>Interest sparked in dark eyes.</p><p>Boredom, it was true, was the bane of most creatures who lived as long as she.</p><p>And Frey had always been good for entertainment if not a hearty meal.</p><p>“Do I want to know what it will do?”</p><p>“Oh nothing much.”  Frey flicked a smiled at her along with the shining silver piece-of-eight.  “Nothing that will push him one way or another, but might end up helping me get one over on my absentee-captor in the end.”</p><p>Mara pouted at being left out of what sounded like an interesting trick, but snapped the silver coin out of the air anyway before it could fall into the sea.</p><p>“Only if she betrays him.”  She agreed.  “Otherwise, I’ll bring it back and you can let me in on what wickedness you have planned for the sea-witch.”</p><p>That was the other problem of immortal, amoral creatures…they had forever to hold a grudge.</p><p>Still, this time it worked in Frey’s favor so he declined to scold her over it as he had in the past when Mara would get into a tiff with one of her sisters.</p><p>After bidding Mara a good day and returning to his tent, Frey’s eyes flicked over the calendar tacked to the wall as he always did out of habit, though it had only changed a few times since he arrived in his memory.</p><p>The charm must have broken jumping to a new universe.</p><p>It was times like this – when the weight of just <em>how long</em> he’d been trapped on this island that he cursed himself for not working harder to finished his new pocket watch after giving the last one – finally done – to his Far as a present, the portable version of a traditional wizarding “family” clock.</p><p>…</p><p>Time passes once more, the only spot of relief for the godling being the news from Mara – Calypso had proven as faithless as they’d thought, and Mara had snuck the piece of eight onto <em>The Flying Dutchman</em> when the pirate captain – one Davy Jones, who in Frey’s home universe was a half-blood as well, though there seemed to be a lack of demigods in this universe – made his port for his one day when next it came after Calypso’s betrayal.</p><p>After that, all Frey had to do was wait, something which he’d become more than accustomed to in this cursed place, giving him a patience for the long-game that otherwise wouldn’t have come to him until much later in his life and well after he’d attained immortality.</p><p>Jones’s rage at his betrayal must have been deep-set indeed, for it wasn’t more than a few months after Mara reported her handing-off – as it were – of the silver coin than ragged sails were spotted just beyond the barrier of his island, the ghost ship springing up from the depths like some great monster of myth and legend.</p><p>Though it was the captain and crew that were perhaps the monsters, Frey decided after showing off – a little anyway, what else did he have to do for fun anymore? – lifting himself up on a great pillar of ice to bring himself even with Jones as he stood on the prow of the salt-worn ship.</p><p>“Hmm.”  Frey cocked his head to the side, eyeing the tentacles that marred what must have been a handsome sea-faring face at one point.  “There is nothing quite like the wrath of a woman scorned, is there, Captain Jones?”</p><p>“How do you know me?”  Jones spat at the magical youth before him.  He’d had his fill of magical beings, and was still searching for a way to repay Calypso for her treachery when an enchanted coin had drawn him here, Jones having no rest until he’d turned his ship to the End of the World, one of the places he would have ever chosen to willingly go as it is one of <em>her</em> places of power.  “And why have you bespelled me?”</p><p>“Oh, you were bespelled long before my silver called you here.”  Frey smirked knowingly, eyeing the ship and crew for emphasis.  “Calypso doesn’t take kindly to those who break their word to her, hypocrite that she is, as you’ve learned the hard way from the stories the waves bring me.  And I’ve my own <em>punishment</em>,” he held out his arms to encompass the isolated isle behind him.  “To weather.  At least you’ve the freedom of the seas.”</p><p>“What do you want of me?”  Jones tried again.  There had to be something.  Why else would this creature call him hence?</p><p>“Ah.”  Frey sighed, rolling his head back to stare up at the sky, letting the cold of the ice seeping into the soles of his feet.  “The question, Captain Jones, should be: what do you want of <em>me</em>?”  Frey told him honestly.  “That’s why you’re here isn’t it?  You seek something, and the enchantment on that coin prompted you to come to the one place and person that could help you find it.”  Green eyes burned with power and banked rage as he lifted his head back to face the damned captain of <em>The Flying Dutchman</em>.  “Speak.  I will listen.”</p><p>“And the cost?”</p><p>Frey smiled wickedly.  “Nothing you won’t be willing to give.  After all…I may be trapped, but Calypso didn’t cause me to cut the very heart from my chest.”</p><p>Jones snarled at the reminder, while puzzled inside at just <em>how</em> well informed the creature was.</p><p>“There is a way to bind her,” though it took him reading through his whole library trunk, and more than a little Arithmancy to figure it out.  “Trap her in a single form and diminish much of her power, power that she has misused and corrupted.”</p><p>“Tell me.”  Jones breathed, bracing his hands and leaning forward.</p><p>“I was hoping you would say that.”  Frey’s eyes flashed with triumph.  “My only condition is thus.”  With a flourish of his hand – more for visual effect than any real need – he floated another piece of eight, the one that held the wards keeping him from using his powers to simply step into shadow and away, over to spin slowly before Jones’s eyes.  “The ritual you shall give to whoever you would rather bear the brunt of her fury than you – because make no mistake, should she ever be freed her fury will be terrible to behold – must use this piece of eight as part of the spell.  Agreed?”</p><p>A dirty hand snapped out and plucked the silver coin from the air before he could convince himself to change his mind.</p><p>“Aye.  It shall be done – just as you ask.”</p><p>“Excellent.”</p><p>…</p><p>Author’s Note 2: Frey’s song to the mermaids is “Come Away to the Water” from the Hunger Games.</p>
