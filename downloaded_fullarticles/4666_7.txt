    <p>CHAPTER 1: Marigold Cabin</p>
<p>The Dursley's experience driving in their car with Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle was quite an unpleasant experience, if you must know.</p>
<p>Vernon, a large, beefy man that uncannily resembled a walrus (complete with a bushy mustache) was currently driving the family car to a destination unknown to him, for a reason that he still did not completely understand. Each minute that passed seemed to turn his face an even deeper shade of purple. He was being uprooted from his home at 4 Privet Drive, and job at Grunnings, a company which made the highest quality drills in all of the UK, (well at least that is what he would boast about to everyone who asked.) He was even angrier that this insane venture was all because of his strange nephew, Harry Potter, and his lot of abnormal people.</p>
<p>In the passenger's seat sat Hestia, one of those abnormal people, who was giving him directions. Despite Vernon's scoffs and bitter remarks, the woman seemed perfectly capable of ignoring his viciously ill temper.</p>
<p>Petunia sat behind her husband, ignoring everything that was happening in the front seats. She seemed wholly unresponsive to the entire situation, as she was more focused on the passing countryside. The only indication that anything was amiss in her world was her pursed lips that gave the impression she had been forced to eat a very large lemon. Internally, she was in a deep vortex of bitter thoughts and resentment, mostly about her sister Lily, who if it were not for her and her magic, this situation would have never be happening to them. However, she knew this move was necessary to avoid the wrath of a magical madman: she needed to keep her family safe, especially her son, Dudley. She remained deep in thought, and merely sighed when that horrid woman told Vernon to turn, separating them further from their home.</p>
<p>On the other side of the back seat, Dudley Dursley's mind was swimming with questions. Who was that Moldywart man Harry had mentioned before leaving them, and why would he want to kill Harry? Why would they want to hurt him and his family? Would his cousin be on the run? Would they be safe? Would Harry be safe?</p>
<p>Dudley never thought he would have concerned feelings for the skinny runt he used to beat up as a kid, but after those Dementor things attacked them two summers ago, Dudley had began to see his cousin in a new light. He felt some remorse for being so awful to his cousin in the past, and had tried to buck up the courage to make amends - which had failed miserably, as his cousin though the cup of tea he had left at his door was part of some kind of prank. What if he never saw Harry again? What if Harry ended up being killed by the Moldyman? Dudley felt he might never be able to make amends.</p>
<p>He must have looked worried, because the short, little man named Mr. Diggle gave him a comforting pat on the hand. Dudley quickly glanced to see if his parents had witnessed this act. When he realized they hadn't, he gave the magical man a thankful smile. Hadn't the strange guy said they were going to become the best of friends? The guy was a complete nutter, but he seemed nice enough.</p>
<p>Hours passed, making Dudley begin to wonder how far away this hiding spot really was, they had to be on the other side of the UK by now! Finally, after nearly dying of boredom (and starvation). Hestia finally spoke words that were music to his ears.</p>
<p>"Pull the car over here."</p>
<p>Dudley looked up from his window to see the entrance to a scrap yard. The sign was faded beyond all recognition, though he could see the piles of scrap metal and various other junk littered around the lot.</p>
<p>"A scrap yard?!" His father yelled, "What the hell are you planning to do to my car?!"</p>
<p>His volume should have busted the woman's eardrums, but she hardly seemed affected. Hestia answered in a dangerously calm and collected tone.</p>
<p>"We are going to hide your car here, like we planned. A Muggleborn friend of mine owns this place. He's hiding from the Ministry himself, but he is willing to hide your car here while your family is at the safe house. He will not make your car look like...that." She said, nodding to the rusted out truck near the entrance.</p>
<p>His father grumbled the entire time he drove into the small garage in the back of the yard and as his family got out of their car and unloaded their things from the boot. Somehow Hestia managed to keep him calm with reassuring words of her friend's credibility and his car maintenance skills. Dudley gripped his two large duffel bags in confusion and fear. He had been told of what was to come. Mr. Diggle and Hestia would be A-peer-ating them to the safe house, the way they described it sounded like some type of teleportation. He couldn't help but think of Star Trek and having his atoms a taken apart and rearranged. It scared him, but it also sounded kind of cool.</p>
<p>"Ready to go?" Mr. Diggle asked him excitedly, like this teleportation thing was the most enticing thing in the world. Dudley looked wearily at his mother for reassurance. Petunia continued to stare blankly into space, though her body trembled.</p>
<p>"There's nothing to worry about," the small man said, holding out his hand to him. "I was the top of my Apparition class." Dudley edged slightly away from him, not wanting to be apart of this of any of this. He wanted to be back at home watching the telly and eating junk food. He did not want some strange man disappearing and reappearing with him. Before he could make more space between the two of them, Mr. Diggle grabbed his hand with a surprising tightness. Dudley did not have any time to react before blackness consumed him.</p>
<p>Apparition was a dark empty void that he was falling through. He couldn't shout or even breathe in the nothingness around him. And then his feet hit the ground.</p>
<p>A sudden rush of vertigo hit him as the world came back into focus. Dudley felt nauseous, if he had actually eaten anything in the past few hours he probably would have puked his guts out on the dirt path that he was now standing on.</p>
<p>Dazed, he looked up after hearing a loud popping noise. He saw his mother and father appear with a 'pop' out of nowhere with Hestia in between them. Dudley watched his father as he stumbled, looking green. His mother shivered in place, but seemed the most stable of the the three of them. Dudley nervously stood up, shaking the dirt off of his luggage.</p>
<p>He barely was able to pull himself together when his dad began roaring in anger. Dudley jumped in surprise. Not because his father was yelling (which was a pretty common occurrence) but because he was able to recover from the teleportation so quickly.</p>
<p>"A BLOODY SHACK !" he raged " YOU HAD US DRIVE ALL THAT DAMN WAY AND USE YOUR ABNORMALNESS TO BRING US TO STAY IN SOME GOD-FORSAKEN SHACK?" Everyone else jumped at the sheer volume of his voice. And Dudley thought he had been loud in the car.</p>
<p>However, he felt his father's anger was completely justified when he got a good look at what was making his father so angry. All that stood in the middle of an overgrown field was a tiny run down hut, not dissimilar to that old place they stayed at years ago when those...wizards kept sending Harry letters. Dudley made a face, but didn't say anything, he did not want to be turned into a toad or something. He looked over to his mother, she was also silent, but she twitched violently as she looked over the miserable place.</p>
<p>Hestia sighed in annoyance, it was the first time that she every indicated annoyance for being yelled at. She brought out her wand. (Which caused Dudley to flinch, he wasn't sure if he was ever going to get used to magic.) Dedalus followed suit. They whispered a few words under their breaths as the scene in front of them seemed to crumble.</p>
<p>Clear pieces of sky seemed to fall away like shards of glass. Revealing a much different scene hidden behind it. Petunia gasped, Vernon made a funny squeaking noise and Dudley found himself gasping in amazement.</p>
<p>In front of them stood a cottage, free of molding wood and a caving in roof. It was well constructed and looked well cared for, but is was still quite small. There was a cobblestone path leading to the door, wildflowers of every kind surrounded the path. The ones that stood out were large and bright orange, captivating to look at. It wasn't what he would call a home, but it couldn't be too bad, could it?</p>
<p>"Welcome to Marigold Cabin," Dedalus smiled. That act of magic seemed to have silenced Vernon for the moment, but Dudley could tell he was still seething with hatred for, well, everything.</p>
<p>Dudley stood there in silent awe, while his parents expressed many emotions ranging from surprise to utter dislike. While they stood there, unmoving, Mr. Diggle levitated their luggage with one swift moment of his wand. Dudley made sure to quietly thank him when neither of his parents spoke up.</p>
<p>"This way," Hestia said, guiding the group over towards the intricately carved front door. Flowers lined the border and the carved vines seemed to pop out at them, for a moment he thought one of the wooden flower buds bloom, but he supposed it could have just been a trick of the light. Hestia knocked on the door three times.</p>
<p>"Yes?" A muffled voice asked from inside the cabin.</p>
<p>"It's us, Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle. We're here with the Dursley family." The witch spoke in a manner Dudley found strangely formal. Instead of the door opening right away, there was a brief pause and the voice spoke up again.</p>
<p>"When I first asked to join the Order, who was the one who vouched for me?"</p>
<p>"Arthur Weasley," Hestia responded. The name seemed familiar to Dudley, but he couldn't seem to place it.</p>
<p>Finally, after that strange exchange of words, the heavy wooden door groaned in protest as it was swung open. A slim figure stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>"You!" Petunia shrieked, causing everyone to stare.</p>
