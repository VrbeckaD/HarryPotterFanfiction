    <p>I rested under the covers of my old bed, my eyes were trained onto my better half. It has been twelve years since I’ve been able to stay in the same room, let alone being as vulnerable as we used to be around eachother. It felt like an eternity not having him by my side, but what else could you do when you’re a prisoner of Azkaban and the Dementors eat away at your soul every time you go out of order. Without the memory of Remus, I don’t know what I would become, I would still be alive; I wouldn’t be me. </p><p>“The bed’s getting cold, Moony,” I say to him. He was staring outside the window of the bedroom looking at the constellations in the night sky, it was a new moon so I wasn’t worried about him turning. </p><p>“In due time, Padfoot,” Remus replied, his voice shallow, this worried me. I swing my legs off of the bed and stepped towards him, pulling the comforter off with me, wrapping it around my shoulders like a cape. </p><p>“Is something the matter?” I asked, wrapping the comforter around his torso with my hands meeting each other, encapsulating the heat between us; his hand rested on top of mine. </p><p>“Nothing is wrong,” he paused, “It’s just… this is my first month without Hogwarts’ facilities”.</p><p>“And why is that an issue?”.</p><p>“I do not have access to Wolfsbane potion, I’m not sure how I’ll be around you,” Remus sounded worried. I didn’t understand why he was nervous, he’s been a werewolf for the majority of his life; for him to be concerned with his condition is both confusing and alarming. </p><p>“What do you mean?” I continue to pry. </p><p>Remus let go of my hands and separated them, escaping my embrace. I watched him as he walked to the bed and sat down, he continued his gases outside the window with the occasional glance at me; he explained, “When a werewolf doesn't take Wolfsbane Potion, they feel the effect of the Moon - the severity depending on the current phase. Tonight is a new moon which is why I am normal - as normal as I can be,”. </p><p>“And that’s bad how? I’ve seen you go full wolf, I should be fine,” I say, confident in supporting Remus and his condition, I sit next to him.  </p><p>Remus gave me a crooked smile “Sirius, we were children, we’re adults now, things change,” his voice slumped into timidness, “Especially me,”.<br/>
“Hey, no need to beat yourself up about it! Whatever will happen, I’m sure we can work it out,” I grab onto his shoulders and pull him closer to myself to kiss his cheek. He blushed, put his hand to where I kissed and smiled; his smile now straightened out. </p><p>“Ok, I believe you,” he replied. </p><p>“That’s what I like to hear,” I smiled back at him. He picked his legs up off the floor and crawled to his side of the bed, he slid his body under the covers and rested his head on the pillow. I do the same and met him underneath, his body faced away from the window, which gave me the golden opportunity to spoon him; this was awkward to do considering our height difference, “Sweet dreams, Remus,”. </p><p>“To you too, Sirius,” He replied. </p><p>I wrapped my arm around his body, he held onto my hand when I found his. We stayed like this until we both agreed that is was becoming unbearably hot and separated; we then fell asleep shortly afterwards.</p>
