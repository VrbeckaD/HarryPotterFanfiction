</p>
</center><p><i>Konohagakure</i>
</p><p><i>3rd March 1994</i>
</p><p>It was a peaceful day.
</p><p>Not a single cloud in the blue sky and the sun was warm, shining down on the swaying limbs of the grove of trees. Birds hopped from branch to branch, singing so sweetly and the birth of spring had all but chased away the last vestiges of winter in the Village Hidden in the Leaves. Nohora Rin still felt a chill that ran into the marrow of her bones, and not even this beautiful, serene day could make it fade away. Her brown eyes stared at the monolith with a hollow gaze, tracing down the long list of names inscribed into the stone that had long since become a familiar litany inside of her head until her eyes landed on the name that brought her here every day like clockwork.
</p><p><i>Uchiha Obito.</i> 
</p><p>Her breath entered her lungs like shards of broken glass and her heart felt like it was lodged painfully in the middle of her throat. Two and half months weren’t enough to dull the pain of grief that swallowed up and eclipsed her entire world. Rin choked back a sob, burying her face into her hands and her body trembled like a leaf. Obito had been exuberant, filled with life and a determination that was unparalleled, and it had been snuffed out in a single mission gone horribly wrong. The memory stirred against her will—of Obito trapped underneath the boulder, crushed and dying. His last breaths raspy and rattled through him, a pained smile stretched upon his lips and his white teeth stained red. He joked while he was dying, joked about giving Kakashi his left eye as a gift for becoming a jonin three years too late. She recalled kneeling down beside him, his hand clasped so tightly in hers while she mentally prepared herself for the eye transplant. 
</p><p>On his last breath, Obito told he loved her. A dying confession sealed with a bloody kiss, and guilty that she couldn’t return his feelings in the way that he wanted her to, the feelings that she felt were platonic and familial, but no less potent. The kiss was…impulsive, a combination to give him something back for the unshakeable loyalty that he had given her, and perhaps to assuage her own guilt that she couldn’t save him. A small, chaste kiss and Obito died with a smile on his face, and Rin was left to pick up the pieces of her life that felt torn asunder. A blurry and numb state followed, Rin barely recalled the eye transplant or blowing up the Kannabi bridge and completely their mission. She vaguely recalls leaning on Kakashi shoulder as they wearily trekked back towards base camp, the shredded feeling of her heart that they had to leave Obito’s body behind.  
</p><p>An unfortunate hazard of the mission, is what it was called. The mission was completed, and that was all that matter in the cold logic of the shinobi world. Rin just couldn’t view it like that. It was such a taciturn and icy way to view a loss, and an “unfortunate hazard” didn’t even come close to describing the tragedy and grief that had shaken Team Minato. Jiraiya-sama and Orochimaru-sama had been dispatched to recover Obito’s body, once they had gotten back to the base camp and informed everyone of what had happened. The area had been demolished and all the bodies, even those of the enemies were nowhere in sight. It had been another devastating and unexpected blow, and Minato had fought for Kakashi and Rin to be recalled to Kohona. 
</p><p>Rin was originally relieved to get such a reprieve from the warfare. The missions had steadily been rising in danger, and it was more often than not that a mission turned into a battleground since the Third Shinobi War was in full swing. Instead, the village was not the welcoming and warm place that she had once knew. Instead, Rin viewed it with new eyes—eyes that had been clouded with cynicism and despair. The people and the places were stifling and bleak, pinned underneath the dark clouds of hostilities. All she had been hoping for was a bit of comfort in the familiar things to ease the near constant ache inside of her chest. 
</p><p>Instead of home comfort, she found herself under the inquiry of the Uchiha Clan and the Council. She had to relive through the trauma of that day while Uchiha Fugaku accused her of bloodline theft—originally she had been accused of conspiracy to murder, but a mind walk session with Yamanaka Inoichi proved that there had been no foul play or murder to support the claim. The Uchiha Clan Head seemed to want retribution for the supposed slight against his Clan, demanding her demotion and dishonorable discharge. Kakashi was protected from the brunt of Fugaku’s rage because of his Clan status, but Rin, who came from a Civilian Clan, had no such protection. She had to endure all the questions and scrutiny, days of it that wore on her mind and soul. It felt like any reprieve would cost her very soul, but then Minato-sensei stepped in with the Third Hokage’s backing to put an end to a pointless trial. 
</p><p>In the end, Rin was suspended from activity duty for a month—the war couldn’t afford to lose a medic for more than that—and she had to sign a contract swearing to never perform such surgery on an Uchiha unless it served the interests of said clan. As soon as the judgment was rendered, Rin fled from the tower with her eyes glistening with tears and rushed across the village to come to sit in front of the Stone Memorial. It had been erected only weeks after this war had started and already had too many names—and more names would be added until the war’s end. 
</p><p>Scalding hot tears rolled across her cheeks and she reached up touching her cheeks. She barely had the energy to put herself together let alone to use the specialized paint to put on her clan markings this morning. It was a struggle to pull herself out of bed and face the Council head on, feeling as if a stiff breeze would knock her over. When was the last time she ate? When was the last time she drank? Her mouth was parched, but her stomach turned at the thought of sustenance. Swallowing down a whimper, Rin dropped her hands into her lap and her fingers curled into her palms. Uneven nails from where she had chewed on them until bloody, but she didn’t even so much as flinch at the small prick of pain. 
</p><p>A familiar hum of chakra like the crackle of lightning in a distant storm, signaled the approach of her other teammate, Hatake Kakashi. His footsteps were soft yet purposefully loud enough as to not startle her. He came to a halt to her left, casting a shadow over her and blocking out the sun. No reprimand came from him about how shinobi weren’t supposed to cry. It was a testament to how shaken he had been by Obito’s death to no longer sprout the shinobi code like it were gospel, and how he had withdrawn to quietly reevaluate things in their line of work.
</p><p><i>Or maybe I’m just being too optimistic,</i> Rin thought, wearily. 
</p><p>There was a rigidness in the air of things that hadn’t been said, but Rin couldn’t find it in her to break the silence first. Her friendship with Kakashi was tentative, but very important. It had come about after her girlish infatuation had melted away after getting to know the aloof and stern boy a little bit better, and after three years being on a team with him, having watched each-others’ back through countless missions, she was comfortable in calling him a friend. In some ways, she felt like she had failed Kakashi as much as she failed Obito on that mission. It had been one of the reasons that she had been avoiding him these last few weeks.
</p><p>“Every day, you come here,” Kakashi spoke, his hand reaching up to touch his hitae which had been slanted over his left eye to conceal the red eye that laid beneath. Obito’s gift was a painful reminder, a burden that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.
</p><p>It was a burden she carried, too, albeit in a different way. She was the one who had cut the eye out of Obito’s skull and had placed into Kakashi’s. Her hands had been stained with both of their blood and that broke something vital in her soul that she didn’t think she would ever get it back. Rin scrubbed at her swollen and blurry eyes, her nose clogged and her breathing slightly labored. “I have to,” she whispered out, unable to give any other explanation for her compulsion. Every day she found herself in front of this stone with a sea of regrets and no way to heal them. “I <i>need</i> to.”  
</p><p>“…why?” Kakashi’s voice was soft, barely more than a whisper.
</p><p>A wind cut through the valley, stirring up the loose strands of her hair and they fluttered about wildly around her face. Her eyes were dull and distant, cheeks flushed from all her crying and her chapped lips were parted ever so slightly. “Because…” Rin said, her voice very faint to her own ears and she wipe the tearstains off her cheeks with the back of her hand. “As long as I hold his memory in my heart and keep him in my memories, so he’ll stay alive through me, and be with me no matter where I’ll go. I come here to remember and hold on tight to that, because that way he’ll never be forgotten.”
</p><p>Several seconds passed in silence, and then Kakashi knelt on his knees beside her, resting his palms in his lap. And that is how Minato found them hours later, underneath a red afternoon sky and paying vigil to the boy who life and death had fundamentally changed them. All of them were completely unaware of the changes and tragedies still left to come.
</p>
<hr/><p><i>Konohagakure</i>
</p><p><i>9th July 2009</i>
</p><p><i>15 Years Later</i>
</p><p>A silver haired man in the standardized ANBU uniform knelt in front of the cenotaph that had been sheltered and unmarked by time due to the seals engraved at the base of the stone. At his waist and clipped on his belt was an Inu mask that was splattered with blood and scraps along the cheek made by a wickedly sharp blade. The dawn had just broken along the horizon when the famed Copy Ninja, Hatake Kakashi reentered the village. There was a weariness that lined his bones and exhaustion that filled his soul each time he returned from a ‘suicide’ mission; at twenty-eight, Kakashi felt like an old man that had lived too long and had seen far too much. 
</p><p>So his ritualistic habits brought him here for a little bit of an escape before he had to march up to the Hokage’s tower and report in. His tardiness and seemingly laziness stemmed from deeper issues in his psyche that he hadn’t even come close to letting anyone touch or get a glimpse of because that would require him openly displaying his inner demons and Kakashi just couldn’t do that. So instead, he came here to get solace from the dead and cope the only way he had known how to. It had been Rin’s way of coping before—<i>lightning crackled around his hand, the sound like chirping birds, and he lunged forward, and then there was Rin, his hand through her chest and so much blood</i>—and he swallowed down the bile that rushed up his throat. 
</p><p>It hadn’t been an overly difficult mission, but one of the Ame missing-nin had been young, only twelve or thirteen. Dark hair and hazel eyes, much like Rin. His orders had been explicit in stating that none were to be left alive. It was a tumultuous time in the Elemental Nations, where missions were becoming much more difficult and it was one political misstep from tumbling headfirst into another war. His team, Team Seven, had been temporarily disbanded about two years ago after the village had mostly recovered from the invasion led by Yahiko, leader of the Akatsuki—a group of S-Ranked missing-nins—and shinobi from Amegakure. The leader of Amegakure, Hanzō of the Salamander, had official disavowed the actions taken by the rogue group and had offered his full support to Konoha without hesitation.
</p><p>It left a sour and bitter taste on his tongue. He was not well versed in the political machinations, having done his best to outrun his clan obligations and avoid dogmatic farces, but he had seen how pleased Shimura Danzō had been with the Godiame’s decision to accept the alliance. <i>“We can’t make enemies where there are none,”</i> was Tsunade’s reply when he casually voiced his concerns, but the Slug Princess turned Hokage was just as skeptical and wary of this so-called alliance as he was. However, she had to navigate the political waters of Konohagakure very carefully since the position of Hokage was coveted by a great many, and some of those people weren’t above a little backstabbing.  
</p><p>There was a chance that Akatsuki’s invasion wasn’t just an attack from outside forces. There were enemies deeply rooted into the village, and he feared could very well already be on their doorstep. Kakashi tilted his head, glancing out of the corner of his grey right eye at the approaching pink haired young woman. Haruno Sakura was all that remained of Team Seven, bearing the full scrutiny of the citizens and shinobi because of her connection to both the Uchiha Sasuke, the traitor and Uzumaki Naruto, the Nine Tails Container. It wasn’t an easy burden to bear, but she endured and Kakashi had become painfully aware of how he had underestimated the milquetoast girl who had seemed a paper ninja at best. With pressure from the Council to mentor Sasuke and to keep a close eye on Naruto, Sakura had been doomed to slip between the cracks the moment she was placed on Team Seven.
</p><p>After Sasuke’s defection to the side of the mysterious figure going by the name Uchiha Madara and Naruto being taken out of the village to be tutored by Jiraiya, Kakashi was able to take Sakura under his wing and when he was sent out on ANBU missions—having been reinstated since the loss of so many good shinobi in the invasion—Lady Tsunade trained Sakura as her apprentice, having taking a shine to the pink haired girl. Sakura was intelligent and learned new techniques with a prodigy-like finesse, with the only drawback of her small chakra reservoir, though over the last two years she had greatly improved that as well. 
</p><p>His only regret in her realizing her true potential was that she’d been on the front lines of the war. Her ability for close range fighting and her medical prowess would doom her to such fate. Weariness snaked through his veins, but he managed to crinkle his eyes in his signature smile. “Hello, Sakura,” he greeted his student, his cheerful tone sounded so genuine that only someone who knew him would know that it was completely forced. 
</p><p>“Hello, Kaka-sensei,” Sakura responded, her voice quiet. There were dark circles that hung underneath her jade green eyes, and a weariness that slanted along the edge of her mouth. “How badly are you injured?”
</p><p>“Just scrapes, Sakura,” Kakashi said, with a shake of his head. “Nothing to concern yourself with. So, what are you doing with the rise of the sun?” 
</p><p>“Couldn't sleep,” she said, with a shrug of her shoulder. “I can never go back to sleep. Once I am up, I am up for the day. I sought out Lee and we ran laps around the village.”
</p><p>Kakashi hummed, in the back of his throat. “Sounds nice.”
</p><p>“It was,” Sakura agreed, quietly. 
</p><p>The morning dew soaked into the fabric of his clothing, but he stayed settled on the grass. He was unsurprised when Sakura decided to join him, folding the skirt beneath her knees to shelter from the cold ground. Every so often, his little student would join him here. She understood enough to know that he has lost, and that he had lost greatly, but she never asked—never pried like Naruto or Sasuke would have, which he was grateful for. Out of the three, Sakura always did possess the greatest tact and diplomacy.
</p><p>“Something on your mind?” asked Kakashi, after he let the silence dwell long enough.
</p><p>“I got another letter from Naruto.”
</p><p>Kakashi scratched his chin through the fabric of his mask. “That’s good that he keeps in touch.”
</p><p>Sakura nodded, after a hesitant pause. “He…he once again promised to bring Sasuke home…”
</p><p>Kakashi arched his brow. “Oh?” 
</p><p>Sakura looked down at her hands that sat in her lap with shame etched onto her expression. “Sensei, I am not sure I <i>want</i> Sasuke to come home. I feel so angry, and then I feel guilty for being angry, and—” Her voice shattered, a few tears leaking down her cheeks. She swiped them away, quickly and irritably. “I just don’t understand. He left his brother, he left the village, and joined someone who had hurt everyone who cared for him. He turned his back on everything, and people still want him back. The Akatsuki killed so many people, and he <i>chose</i> them over us. He <i>abandoned</i> us, and I can’t forget that. I can’t forgive that.”
</p><p>Kakashi felt a relief pool through his chest. He had been worried that Sakura wasn’t expressing her true feelings about Sasuke’s betrayal. With friends like Naruto and Ino, he felt that Sakura let her own voice get lost in the shadow of theirs. She had stated in the first few months of the invasion aftermath that she wanted Sasuke home, but there had always been a shadow in her expression. One that he recognized on his own face from time to time, that mixture of grief and rage that burrowed soul deep.
</p><p>Sakura had lost her parents in the invasion, and while Team Seven had clashing personalities, they had grown close after a series of dangerous missions. A friendship—fragile in its infancy—had blossomed, and it could have been something great. Like he, Obito and Rin could have been great. Sakura’s parents had welcomed Sasuke and Naruto in their home, giving the two boys a taste of something that had been sorely missing in their lives. That had to drive the knife deeper, Kakashi reasoned, that Sasuke so easily tossed that aside. He would have been worried if Sakura hadn’t harbored any hatred or dislike of Sasuke, after all of that. 
</p><p>Kakashi rubbed he back of his neck, feeling a bit at a loss. He was not the best with emotional baggage, with the weight of his still heavy on his shoulders. Sakura was too smart to be placated with simple words, and he did not stand in her shoes, so he could not tell her how to deal with this. “I have a new teacher for you,” he commented, giving her a distraction from her grim thoughts. “You wanted to learn how to become a sensor, did you not?”
</p><p>Sakura perked up, looking at him expectantly. “You mean, you found someone willing to train me?”
</p><p>“I did.” Kakashi pushed him off the ground with a quiet grunt. He brushed off the stray bits of grass that clung to his britches and turned to Sakura with an eye smile. “I’ll introduce you to him now, if you want. I feel that I will be a poor mentor today.”
</p><p>A black mood lingered above his head, circling like a brewing storm. He wouldn’t be able to concentrate on teaching her anything new and having to juggle that with an incident report…it made him feel terribly old and exhausted. He placed his mask back on, and then sped across the glean with Sakura trailing behind. She was faster, he could tell with a bit of pride. He led her across the rooftops through the village; the streets slowly filled with people, and bit of idle chatter broke up the monotony.
</p><p>The civilians and shinobi lived in a symbiotic relationship. The farmers, merchants, shopkeepers, tended to be more civilian work, though there were some shinobi who retired into that kind of work for one reason or another. The shinobi were to protect the village, and to keep peace in their home country. The Kage and the Daimyo were two sides of the same coin, working in tandem for the better of the Nation. Though there were many times throughout history that balance of power turned into a power struggle, and it did not help that most civilians feared the shinobi and the violent nature of their work.
</p><p>There were moments of peril, when the civilian and shinobi worlds had collided that the civilians seemed grateful for the protection, but all too soon when stability returned did the civilians return to sticking their nose up at the shinobi. Kakashi envied the simplicity of their lives and hated their blissful ignorance, in equal measure.
</p><p>He dropped down into the garden of a home secluded on the outskirts of the Nara Forest, and pulled out his trusty Icha Icha Paradise, waiting until his little student fell in step with before he walked up towards the door. As soon as they stepped onto the porch, the door was pulled open with an ominous creak.
</p><p>Sakura went still, like she wanted to turn and run, but had forgotten how. He placed a hand on her shoulder and waved at the owner of the home with his book. “Sakura, you remember Sasuke’s older brother?” he asked, rhetorically. “Itachi, it’s been a while.”
</p><p>Uchiha Itachi stood in the doorway, wearing a green turtle-neck sweater and a pair simple black trousers. He was tall and of lanky build, that belied the strength and training that he had undergone throughout the years. His midnight colored hair was pulled out of his face, into a high ponytail and a pair of a glasses sat upon the bridge of his nose. The jet-black lens concealed his eyes. “Long time no see,” Itachi said, with a quirk of his lips.
</p><p>Sakura choked, while Kakashi let out a long awkward laugh. 
</p><p>There was not a soul in the village that did not know his name. His high intellect saw him placed on the front lines of the war, one of the youngest shinobi ever to put into combat. His life had been riddled with hardship, right out of the womb with the burden of brining glory to the Uchiha Clan on his shoulders. He had chosen the village over his Clan, a shocking scandal when all was revealed. His parents and the elders of the clan had been put to death for their plans to overthrow Lord Third. Most of his adolescent had been filled with much tragedy, and his shinobi career came to a screeching halt when he was betrayed and his eyes stolen by the Missing-Nin, Shisui of the Body Flicker. 
</p><p>The extensive rehab that he had to go through after losing his eyes had given the Council Elders enough leverage to pry primary custody of his younger brother from him, and he was raised by a council approved Uchiha couple. While Itachi got to be a part of his brother’s life, there had always been a filter and eyes on them the entire time that it damaged their sibling relationship beyond repair. Sasuke had started to come around, but then invasion happened, turning that all to dust.
</p><p>“You are late,” Itachi said, with a cluck of his tongue. “What is the point of making appointments early, if you never intend to be on time?”
</p><p>“A girl stopped me, so I danced,” Kakashi replied, with an eye smile. “Sakura played the music.”
</p><p>Sakura nearly facepalmed but managed to hold back the impulse.
</p><p>“Hmm, I believe you used that excuse two months ago. You must be running out of lines, or your memory is failing you in your old age,” Itachi commented, nonchalantly. His body shifted so that he faced Sakura, ignoring the way that Kakashi dramatically put a hand of his heart like he had been physically struck. “Sakura, it is nice to see you again.”
</p><p>“Uh, it is nice to see you as well,” Sakura replied, hesitantly.
</p><p>“You've come for sensory training, yes?” Itachi asked, head tilted.
</p><p>Sakura looked mighty tempted to tell him <i>no.</i> The pink haired chunin shot Kakashi, a long and dubious stare out of the corner of her eye. “I question your choices. <i>All</i> the time,” she told him, plaintively. Her green eyes flickered to Itachi, and she bowed at the waist. “Thank you for your time, Itachi-san. I promise that you will not regret extending me this--a”
</p><p>“Haruno-san?” Itachi interjected, genially. “There is no need to stand on ceremony. I am no longer hold a shinobi rank, and I am not to heir to any great clan. Please come in and make yourself at home. I need to have a word with Kakashi, before I join you.”
</p><p>“Uh, right. Thank you,” Sakura mumbled, red-faced. 
</p><p>Kakashi watched his student toss him one last glower and marched through the threshold with her head held high. It was no secret that Sakura had a crush on Itachi when she was younger, and that Sasuke had given the pink haired girl much grief over it. While her affections had eventually shifted to a beaming, blond loudmouth who loved orange a little too much, there was a chance that Sakura was probably still embarrassed and taken aback that Itachi was her new teacher. 
</p><p><i>I guess I should find someone else to care for Mr. Ukki,</i> he thought, with a mild sigh. <i>Sakura is liable to kill him, just to spite for this.</i>
</p><p>“Have you heard what the weather will be like this week? I fear it will be a downpour,” asked Itachi, quietly.
</p><p>“Fair weather as far as the eye can see.” Kakashi casually plucked a note from the pages of his book, passing it to the younger man faster than the eye could catch. A letter from Jiraya, written in a specialized code that Itachi could read, with all the rumors and news about Sasuke. “But carry an umbrella. You never know when a cloudy day could cause a bit of rain.”
</p><p>Kakashi dissolved into a pile of swirling leaves and dropped onto the rooftop of his apartment. He plopped down onto the tiles, with his arms draped across his knees and he just looked up at the baby blue sky where not a single cloud was in sight. He couldn't bring himself just yet to go into his quiet and simple apartment, where the only thing that would keep him company is Mr. Ukki. And Mr. Ukki wasn't a big chatterbox.
</p><p>It was those moment, where the absolute void of noise consumed him and dredged up all that he wished he could just forget. A starving and frothing at the mouth beast, his thoughts were. All sharp teeth and ready to tear through his carefully crafted mask, trying to steal the good memories that held the shattered pieces of a broken man together. 
</p><p>Rin and Obito—he tried to hold onto them, in small ways. If it weren't for Rin's voice in the back of his head, he wouldn't get up out of bed or remember to eat. She was like a guiding hand that always pulled him back from the brink, before he tumbled straight over into the abyss. He visited the memorial stone, for her because she no longer couldn’t and because he punished himself for not being able to save all those that he had lost. He spent hours in front of that stone, caught up in the haze of grief and when he was inevitably late...well, he took a page out of Obito's book. 
</p><p>These little excuses that sounded too absurd to be real. It was only after Obito had died that he learned that those excuses hadn’t been excuses, but often the very truth. He was the Uchiha with a heart of gold, that stopped to help anyone who asked, even little old ladies who need help grocery shopping; he had spent hours wondering which tardy excuses were genuine and which weren't more times than he could count.
</p><p>It was easy to take the memories of them, filling in spaces between all his shattered pieces. The memories were never steady, not binding and he had to hold everything so tightly, or he would fall apart all over again. There were days that he let himself fall apart, let the old wounds bleed and cleansed himself of the sorrow in his soul. It never said clean, though.
</p><p>There was just too much blood on his hands for that.
</p>
<hr/><p><i>Takigakure</i>
</p><p><i>12th August 2009</i>
</p><p>Dark bluish, gray clouds swelled up in the sky and sheets of rain crashed down against the treetops in a deafening deluge while Aster Potter nudged deeper into the small alcove in the foothills to shield herself from the storm. With her dark hair plastered to her face and a gimlet-eyed stare, she looked like angry wet cat and her teeth chattered together while a chill sank bone deep into her limbs. Her clothing was completely soaked, and it was tempting to use her magic, but given the adverse effects that she had been receiving when casting spells stayed her hand. 
</p><p>Chakra was more limited, having a heavy structure that imposed limits on just how far the abilities born from it could go. While certain abilities could be improved or invented, chakra was not boundless and infinite. Even the most powerful of chakra users had to work inside the confines of the laws and physics of how chakra could be manipulated and used. Magic, on the hand, was practically limitless, where the mind was the only limit imposed upon it. As long as the mind could conceive it, anything was possible and so the bonds of reality were able to stretch further and in much more unique ways than chakra. Where chakra had branches (such as lightning, fire, earth, etc.), magic could be used for a vast majority of things that it was mind boggling in comparison.
</p><p>Fuuinjutsu was creative enough in many ways, but still did not stretch to cover all the bases that magic could. But chakra had far deadlier application than magic did, even with the Dark Arts considered. Chakra was versatile to be used in attacks and battle, especially when it came to physical and hand to hand combat. Magic was more of long-distance fight, relying on agility and speed rather than strength. In a perfect world, Aster having two cores—one magical, one chakra—would seem completely ideal, making her more adaptable to harsh conditions of the world she now lived in. 
</p><p>But an individual was meant to house only one type of core. The two cores had grown like two saplings that sprouted out of the ground only a foot apart. In the beginning, both shared the space and sunlight in harmony, but now that the cores had matured into fully grown trees, space was scarce, and the light struggled to shine through. The trunks of her cores were too close, and the branches creaked and groaned, painfully entwining with one another. A spell or jutsu caused a violently backlash that would echo through one core into the other and left her feeling like she was tearing herself apart from the inside out.   
</p><p>Death had told her that a balance was possible, but that it would take time for her to find a way to master both of her cores, and thus her abilities. But Aster had never felt like time was on her side nor had it ever been any friend of hers. The seals imbedded into the flesh of her arms were a bleak reminder of the price she would pay in order to see those that she cared about once more, and after she was well enough to stand, Aster had solely focused on her goal with a vengeance. It was a danger task that could risk life and limb, but there was no other choice.
</p><p>And she finally caught up to the target that she had been tracking for the last week.
</p><p>She wasn’t ready. She knew this in her heart of hearts, but…she was desperate. Guilt set heavily in her lungs, thick and heavy like wet cement. Her chest rose and fell, on rapid breaths and her hazel eyes peered out through the wild thicket of foliage with a haunted look that she just couldn’t shake away. Her fingertips reached up to brush the broken hitae wrapped around her throat, the leaf symbol cleaved in half and scuffed up. Would it have been easier to have gone back? To search out for help, rather than face this all alone? Or would she have been treated with hostility and unkindness?
</p><p>The memories…they were broken, scattered across her mind and the pieces she did have were faded like old parchment paper. She couldn’t line the pieces up, couldn’t remember her story, and there was a fear embedded deep into her bones about going home. 
</p><p>Aster never had a home. At least, not one that she remembered. She had thought Hogwarts was a home once, but that had turned out to be quite the lie, now didn’t it? And while there were these patches—glimpses of warm smiles, the smell of cherry blossoms, and a love that she longed to hold onto—she wasn’t sure how much she could trust them. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to trust them, she just didn’t know <i>how</i> to. What if she went home, only to be rejected and shut out?
</p><p>It would break something fragile in her, something that had already been so battered and bruised that Aster could not risk it so easily. The shallow of her throat convulsed while she tried to swallow the lump of emotions wedged tight in the back of her mouth, and she pulled the cloak of invisibility around her tightly. It wasn’t a cloak anymore, so much as a tight fitted chest plate armor befitting of a ninja that she could activate on command.
</p><p><i>“Less likely to trip over it and get yourself killed,”</i> Death had explained. She was grateful for his foresight, and even more so for his help against Shinigami.
</p><p>A vision of Shinigami upon his bloody throne, built on the bones of the dead flared up in her mind. His golden iris glistened ominously, while she knelt in the darken chamber just on the outskirts of time. <i>“You need not be the arbiter of their demise, merely help</i> seal <i>their fates,</i>“ the Death God spoke, with a smirk that had his rotten and sharp teeth on full display. 
</p><p>“I need to stop making deals with death,” she muttered, underneath her breath. She started forward once more, using the barest amount of chakra to boost her speed that would not cost her too greatly. It felt like an ache, a pulled muscle. Nothing that would hamper her when it came time to fight, though she hoped that what fight would occur would be brief and she could make a hasty escape. 
</p><p>The forest began to clear away, the trees falling away to give a view of the clear sky and she came upon a dirt road. There were a series of footprints, fresh and distinct enough, that she could make out that a platoon of people had come through here recently. Ten or more individuals, by her count. She knew that there was supposed to be a Bounty Station somewhere in this vicinity. 
</p><p>Given the notoriety of her targets, someone would have noticed if they passed through. It was possible to get answers, before her trail ran too cold. She started off at a full sprint and 
</p><p><i>“Seal their fates. Seal their fates. Seal their fates!”</i> the Death God’s voice reverberated through her brain. It was a dark, ugly chant that spurred her forward with her heart jammed tight in the back of her throat. 
</p><p>She could see the Bounty Station jutting up from the earth just upon the horizon, when she sensed a spike in chakra signatures just ahead. Her breath fluttered anxiously in her chest, and she pressed her palm against her armor activating the invisibility. She slid up against the side of the building, cautiously peeking around the corner to see a sight that made her eyes grow to the size of saucers. 
</p><p>A silver haired man dressed in a black robe embossed with red clouds with a wicked looking scythe was surrounded by a group of six shinobi, impaled on various blades. There was no reason that he should be alive or standing, but the man just looked supremely annoyed. 
</p><p><i>Immortal and foul-mouthed,</i> Aster thought, eyes narrowed. <i>That must be Hidan.</i>
</p><p>“Ah, that fucking hurt!” Hidan complained, a little bit blood leaking out of the corner of his mouth.
</p><p>The six shinobi that had attacked the missing-nin were visible shaken, and even Aster was taken aback by the way the man shrugged off the attack like it had been a bee sting, not his vital organs being pierced. There was no time to breathe, or to absorb the gravity of what this meant, for the building that she had been standing beside exploded. 
</p><p>She was flung forward in the shower of debris, and if it had not been for her instinctual magic projecting a shield around her body, she would have been crushed like a bug underneath the wall that fell down towards her. She crawled on her hands and knees, out from underneath her and the magical shield broke. The strain on her cores rattled through her, and her knees nearly buckled out from underneath her. 
</p><p>Fear rang hollow inside her head, drowning out her thoughts and allowing adrenaline to guide her way. She rose on her feet unsteadily, the thump of her heartbeat hammer at her temples and her breath scraped up out of her lungs. Her mind raced to form a strategy to close to Hidan in all the chaos and somehow manage to make it out alive. 
</p><p>Hidan cracked a gruesome smile when the shinobi jumped away from him. A teenager was chased across the dusty road by another shinobi wearing the same red cloud robe as Hidan. <i>Fucking hell. This must be Kazuku,</i> Aster thought, her mouth went dry with panic. <i>A two for one special?</i>  
</p><p>“Kazaku, stay out of this!” Hidan retracted his scythe, and his violet eyes flared with irritation. He placed his feet into his own blood that pooled at his feet and started to draw a pattern that eerily looked like a rune. Eerily like the Deathly Hallows, just with a few small changes. “Like they could pull it off. If they could kill me, I'd let 'em.”
</p><p>Aster could feel the power building in that blood. It was a dark, tempestuous power, born out of pain and agony, fueled by a thousand screams. It chipped away at the warmth in the air, until she could feel ice down into her soul and it reminded her of the frightening power that the dementors wielded. The only difference was that dementor devoured a soul with a kiss. Jashin devoured his victims, feeding on their pain and blood spilt, through Hidan. That symbol was the conductor, and she knew that she had to stop him.
</p><p>She lunged forward only to have a palm wrapped around her throat. The ironclad grip choked the breath out of her, and out of the corner of her eye, she saw Kazuku standing about a yard away from her. His arm was detached from his body, held on by these unearthly stitches, and his glowing green eyes set against black bore into her.
</p><p>“I told you that we were being followed,” Kazuku groused.
</p><p>Her invisibility flickered, like a broken project playing a film. Her fingers clawed at the ice-cold hand that lifted her off the ground. The tips of her toes scraped across the ground, but she couldn’t find an ounce of leverage. Dark spots danced in front of her vision and fear surged up her spine until it buzzed white hot at the base of her skull. 
</p><p>“Nohora Rin.” Hidan licked the blood off his chin with relish, his purple eyes gleamed like wildfire. “Jashin <i>told</i> me all about you, little ghost.”
