    <p>It was the beginning of November. kind of a regular day. Ron and I had been sitting in the great hall and had been chatting about charms homework. Like old times. Except it wasn’t like old times at all, but it’s impossible to think about that all day. Talking with your best mates about how long your essay is compared to theirs, is much easier than having to see all the empty spots on the benches in the hall. Everytime I looked over to where previously the slytherin table had been, my heart was crushed. </p><p>The heads of the houses had decided to stop splitting everybody up. The sorting ceremony still remained, but it was more for tradition sake than for determining the life of an 11 year old. The table system had been changed, which was the only good solution. It would’ve been unbearable to see how empty the seats would be, and the loss everyone had suffered.</p><p>Especially the Slytherins. Not only did a lot of those students drop out after the battle, it was also undeniable that of all the houses, Slytherin had the least survivors. This had everything to do with the side they were fighting on. Some Slytherin students had joined Voldemort’s side, and had been met with a bad ending. Even worse (or, no, not worse. Every student death is equally worse), the Slytherins who had fought on the other side, had been labeled as “traitors” by the Death Eaters, sometimes even friends or family, and these students had been more victimized than any other. </p><p>Slytherin had suffered a great loss, and everyone knew and felt it. When they got rid of their table, and moved the other three in a triangle position, for more harmony, no one had complained. We all silently  understood the grief everyone was feeling. </p><p>It took some getting used to, to be completely honest. My personal relationship with the Slytherin house has had mostly bad parts, and to greet them as friend instead of foe, was new. I tried, obviously I tried, I couldn’t not have tried. But still. </p><p>The first weeks after the battle, everyone went home. We did not have our summer holidays, no, but we all needed some time. I guess it’s safe to say I needed more time than the others. </p><p>When I returned, which I could have done in June (they kept Hogwarts open for the people with no other place to go), almost everyone had returned. It was late october, and though there was so much tension and grief hanging in the air, things had found their way back to normal. Classes had been picked up, teachers had been reassigned, and unspoken rules about houses and the war had been made.<br/>
So then I returned, to the place I had called home for so long, but had also given me the nightmares I’d carry with me til my very end.</p><p>I thought my return would be the last one. I realized  I had taken more time off than the other students, but thought mine would be an ultimate. It sort of was. Only one person made their return to Hogwarts later than I had. People hadn’t even expected him to come back. I don’t really know what I had been expecting back then. Guess I just tried to ignore the clear absence of my arch enemy companion friend teammate traitor ferret person; we have a complicated relationship.<br/>
But sure enough, at the start of November, while having breakfast and chatting about Charms essays, Draco Malfoy walked through those doors, and shocked  us all.</p><p>As I said, I don't know what I'd been expecting. But Draco Malfoy with longish messy hair and casual robes without any sign of class or house, was like whiplash to me. So much had changed about him since I last saw him, which was at his and his mother's trial, when he looked completely different (understandably so, he was on trial for crimes against the wizarding world). But now he looked, sort of, okay. Not happy, but his cheeks were less hollow then I remembered them to be, his eyes were a little brighter and his face was still Malfoy pale, but not sickly. Draco had gotten better, at least a little, and it made me very happy I think. </p><p>Not everyone shared my opinion. I could've seen it coming (I didn't). Draco probably did. He knew what it was like to have everyone hate him for his father and some of his actions, and he had gotten used to it. To be fair, I don't think 5 ravenclaw students could hurt his feelings more than the people who tried to attack him when we were at the Ministry. Random people, who didn't know us personally at all, got up from their desks to "protect me from this despicable man". That was a bad day, but at least Draco was not sent to prison.</p><p>So although it wouldn't hurt Draco to the core, the falling silent of the hall and the nervous mumbling as students moved seats away from him, couldn't have been nice. I could almost feel the emotional tax that would have on a person; in my years here, I'd been avoided by almost all the students once in awhile. But not now, no. This was just like the ministry: people treated me as a hero, as a perfect guy, as a savior, while treating Draco like vermin, the lowest of the low in our society. And he couldn't do much about it. </p><p>"Blimey Harry, look who's here!", Ron said, but I'd been looking already. There was something magical about this newfound vulnerability Draco was portraying. Death Eater trial and conviction humble a person pretty well. I was uncertain about how to proceed. Yes, the two of us had been strangely open and close during the trials, but my assumption had been that it had been a temporary necessity. A short truce, so to say. Not that we would otherwise have been fighting like twelve year olds again, but the usual tension was there.<br/>
So that caused uncertainty of action, which led to staying in place but very clearly staring at the blond boy.<br/>
The boy in question had taken a seat at the very end of a table. I could see the ravenclaw girls moving away from him, and I felt it like it was my own shame.</p><p>"Mate, what's up with you?", Ron disturbed my thoughts. "Nothing? Why? I'm just a little surprised, that's it…", I defended myself. I was surprised, but maybe there was something more than surprise that I was feeling at that moment. But no way I could tell Ron about that; he'd take me to see madam Pomfrey before you could say Quidditch. So instead, I wondered about my feelings all by myself. Curious, but mostly frightened to what I'd find. My reaction hadn't been evil, but it didn't feel friendly. It was just, so intense. Like a wave crashing into my brain, but without causing any harm. Just, shock and confusion, but no hurt. It was weird. </p><p>----</p><p>That night in my bedroom, (I had requested a one person bedroom upon my arrival, seeing as my sleeping is restless, infrequent, and I tend to wake up screaming), I did something I hadn't done in a long time. Looking at the map. The Marauder's Map, an old friend that felt ancient now, like a treasure from the past. It felt so distant, and I was almost sure I'd lost my connection with it, but after the words had been spoken to open it, I fell right back into my stalking ways. Obviously, the map had changed as the castle had changed, with the great Hall looking different, and some areas being destroyed in the battle, but my main focus was there. The Slytherin dorms. </p><p>Although almost all of the separate house things had been removed, the common rooms stayed the same. Nobody minded having a room for their house, and there would be a loss of heritage if we had to clean out the rooms. So, the passwords were removed, as everyone was free to join each other in a common room, but the sleeping quarters stayed the same. Except for me, with my separate room.</p><p>And, as I discovered, also for Draco, who was in a separate room as well. I could see him walking around in a small cube on the map, that was his room, I guessed. It was right next to the other sleeping rooms, so my guess was an educated one.<br/>
I wondered why Draco had gotten a room of his own (and why I suddenly called him "Draco" instead of "Malfoy"...)<br/>
Was it for the same reasons as me? Was it cause he felt out of place with the other students? Was it just a leftover from his snobbish behavior that was hard to let go? I didn't know, and it wasn't like I could go ask him, so I stayed curious, staring at the map, at the moving dots and moving stairs, til everyone in the castle was lying in their beds, and then I went to sleep.</p><p>Sleeping had never been one of my favorite things. Before Hogwarts, sleep meant being unaware of where my aunt, uncle or nephew were, which meant I could be hurt or yelled at any time, without me being aware why. Then, at Hogwarts, it started out okay, but after the first year, sleep meant nightmares. At first nightmares of Fluffy, Quirrel and the Mirror, but as the years progressed, and the horrors continued, I collected a lot of nightmare material.<br/>
Cedric's death, Sirius' death and my own sort of death were most common, and always woke me up screaming. Ron loves me, and he's the best friend I could wish for, but even he didn't really appreciate my cries and yells at 3 am, which I understood.</p><p>Sleep had never brought me really nice things. Like, it showed me when Arthur got attacked, so it showed me good things, but never nice. That night, though, the night after Draco had returned, I woke up feeling that I'd dreamt nicely. I could not remember it, or why it was so nice, but I felt at ease, like something was going perfectly well, and I didn't have to be worried about it. It was like the very few mornings I'd had with Ginny, in the time we were together. </p><p>With Ginny things had felt at peace, like a wave of calmth finally washing over me. It wasn’t often that I got to experience comfort and quiet, in the arms of someone who cared about me. I had loved the time with Ginny, but we both realized that we weren’t going to be together after everything would be over. Too much history, and while the comfort of a relationship were great, we weren’t the right people for each other. We had been together cause we understood, cause we both needed someone that understood, but a relationship needs more than understanding, and it wasn’t there. </p><p>So yeah, while I was okay with not having her as my girlfriend, I missed the feeling of having a special someone. But I’d felt it that morning, and it weirded me out. </p><p>Nothing to be done about it, so I shook it off as a strange withdrawal symptom that had randomly showed up that night. And I continued my day. Honestly, if every time I had a strange thought, moment or memory, I would stop in my tracks til I figured it out, I would never get anything done.</p><p> So I went to get breakfast. And to my potions class. And to my charms class. And to all my other classes. Like I’d done every day since getting back, but the feeling wouldn’t leave, haunting me in the back of my mind all day. Do you know how weird it is to be possessed by a nice feeling? I mean, obviously I knew what it was like to walk around with a nasty feeling all day long, but a nice one? That was new, and I had no clue how to act. So, I did what I always did when in emotional trouble.</p><p>“Hermione, something’s off”.<br/>
This made her jump, and maybe I shouldn’t have been standing quietly behind her while she tried to stuff her mouth full of potatoes - she and Ron had been rubbing off of each other - but she moved over and I took a seat next to her.</p><p>“What’s up?”, she asked “Big trouble or regular trouble?”<br/>
“Regular trouble, but it’s, err, it’s about feelings. I think. And I don’t think Ron would be of any help…”<br/>
I had clearly piqued her interest with these words, as the potatoes lost their appeal and she was now completely focused on me. I told her about this morning, the missing, the comfort and the feelings I hadn’t been able to get rid off. While telling my story, Hermione got into her role of “friend who’s trying to be a psychologist”, and while normally Ron and I would make fun of her for it, right now I could use some girly insight.</p><p>“Well, Harry, I guess it’s a confusing situation”, she began. “I mean, for a long period of time you’ve had someone beside you, and a few months ago that stopped, suddenly”. </p><p>She was right, our breakup had been long coming, but when it came, over the summer holidays, it still felt sudden. “So, it’s not strange you have these feelings”, she continued. “The real question is, why did they start now? Has something happened lately? A change in your life, renewed contact? Wait, there haven’t been any extraordinary dreams again right?”<br/>
“No, no weird dreams, nothing unusual. And I don’t know about any changes. Thanks anyway, you’re great”</p><p>With that statement I ended our conversation, no tension relieved, but having eased her mind about the nightmares. The changes she suggested weren't something I wanted to think about, so I actively chose to ignore it all, as I was afraid of what it might reveal. Dinner went by really quickly after that, as I was in a state of mind where I didn't fully join the situation.</p><p>That night I stopped myself from looking at the map again. I really wanted to, to see all the students in the rooms, to see the professors heading to their own bedrooms, to see McGonagall staying up late in the headmaster's office, and to have the satisfied feelings looking at it gave me. But it felt wrong, and I didn't want a repeat of what had been a confusing day, so instead I left the map at the bottom of my trunk and went to sleep. Dream filled, but nothing new, and nothing that left me with weird feelings.</p><p>Morning was fine, a Saturday, so probably just some hanging around outside, maybe some flying or playing some games. I had a whole day kind of planned out, until I looked at the bulletin board in our common room. Not many things were on there, just some house rules, cleaning schedules (we had to clean our own rooms and bathrooms now), and one or two flyers for clubs, like chess or something…<br/>
But, thar morning - although it had to have been stuck on there that night - there was a new flyer.</p><p>
