          <div class="userstuff"><p>Where Harry is from the 12th district but no one really remembers him except for his eyes and he's picked to be in the Hunger Games after Katniss's and again no one really knows anything about him so the whole Capital doesn't know what to expect and Peeta and Katniss along with their former mentors are tasked to help Harry and whoever else is picked<br/>
Along the way he keeps on surprising people in many different ways until it's found out that he is trans ( female to male )</p><p>The Capital goes wild and he's almost drawn out of the Games until he makes a compelling speech that makes President Snow allow him to stay</p><p><br/>
During the Games themselves ( The games are similar to the ones in Catching Fire but instead of Katniss and everyone else participating inside the arena, they are mentors to the newly picked players. Of course the rebellion is still trying to happen but you know, in a different way ) , Harry teams up with another player that's from another District, abandoning his partner from 12th. The Capital and Harry’s mentors slowly see that Harry and the guy are falling in love with each other, until they are the only ones left along with Harry’s 12th district female who was able survive until then</p><p><br/>
Somehow they are able to kill her and then it's just them, the Capital along with many others think that they are going to pull off what Katniss and Peeta did but instead, when the guy pulls in Harry close to him and kisses him deeply, Harry sticks a knife into his heart, sending the guy and everyone else watching into shock<br/>
Before the shock wears off, Harry puts a hand on the back of the guy’s neck and draws him close enough to put his mouth to his ear, sending the knife in deeper, before whispering only loud enough for the camera to hear “ I'm pregnant sweetheart.” Before he pulls back and slices the guy’s throat with another knife and letting the body drop.</p><p><br/>
The Capital come out of their shock after the cannon sounds<br/>
After they pick him up from the arena, doctors confirm that Harry is in fact pregnant, which once again sends the people into overdrive after hearing the news</p><p><br/>
Near the end, all you see is Harry getting dressed up for the final feast before going back to district 12th’s Victor place, and looking into the mirror making sure everything is in place. He looks down and all you hear is a faint rustling noise before he looks back up into the mirror, meeting the eyes of a dark-skinned older man dressed in all black with the lightest pair of brown eyes you'll ever see.

 Harry doesn't say anything and the Man just looks down while adjusting a golden ring on his finger, somehow making it seem like it's glowing before offhandedly inquiring “ Are you really pregnant or was that just a little something to spice up your act?” His tone sharpens on the word pregnant, as though saying it sharp enough will make go away.<br/>
He looks up to see that Harry turned around and is now gazing at him with the corners of his lips turned up and a glint of amusement in beautiful green eyes, “ And what if I am?”, he tilts his head up a little and the glint of amusement seems to grow.</p><p><br/>
The Man straightens from his somewhat slumped stance and tightens the fingers that are still tracing the ring. He meets Harry’s eyes head on and then takes a breath “ I'll do whatever I can to make sure you have everything you'll need during the time.”</p><p><br/>
Fondness enters Harry’s eyes, making the Man lose his breath and think that no matter how many times he's seen this, he hopes that it will never loose its effect on him. Harry steps close enough to the Man to grab onto his jacket and pull him closer, “ You always want to make sure I'm the one that's satisfied in this relationship, never you.” The Man goes to correct him, he has to put Harry first, he's the more important one of the two, but gets cut off when Harry notices him about to open his mouth “ You're lucky I care about you too or this relationship is going to quickly become more of a Master and Servant type of thing, don't you think so Death?”</p><p>Death just rolls his eyes, thinking back on the many times Harry has said those words and how he never rolled his eyes before Harry, and maybe that should concern him? Death is broken out of his thoughts by Harry stepping closer into his space, making him unconsciously put his hands on his waist, pulling Harry in until he's pressed up against him.</p><p><br/>
“ And before you respond with you're usual, you should know that I am pregnant.” Death stiffens before he can help himself, “ but rest assure, it's yours.” Harry finishes with a little bounce, unable to help himself with how nervous he actually is. </p><p>Death hasn't been this dumbfounded since he and Harry were trying to figure out what kind of powers he gained after receiving the title, after all Harry is his first master and it's not like he actually knew what he was doing when he gave those brothers the three items and was it really his fault that two of them died the way- he breaks away from his thoughts after he feels Harry try to move away from him.</p><p>Death tightens his arms around Harry, stopping him from escaping, and pulls him back to him to rest his head on Harry's neck. Harry wraps arms around Death; one around his waist and the other over his shoulder to rest his palm on the back of his neck, causing Death to melt into Harry. “Thank you.” Is all that Harry hears from Death, barely loud enough to disturb the silence that filled the room.<br/>
They spend a few moments just standing in front of the mirror, wrapped around each other before the mood is broken by a knock on the door and Harry’s make up artist giggles from behind the door “If you don't come out in 3, Cinna’s gonna make you try on that dress we all love!” She giggles some more before she moves away.</p><p><br/>
Death starts chuckling when he feels Harry shudder against him. “Is it really that bad?”<br/>
“Absolutely horrendous” is what's said muffled across Death’s neck, “It glows in the dark too. I'm a walking glow stick when I'm in it.”<br/>
Death tries to stop the chuckles by hiding his smile into Harry’s hair. “How about I get us out of here, maybe try a different world, one with less death games you know, until the baby is born and all.”</p><p>Harry practically perks up, “What about that one world that has superheroes in it, with that group? What are they called again? The Averages or something.”</p><p>“ The Avengers you mean but close enough. I'll take you there as long as you promise not to get involved with them during the pregnancy.”<br/>
Harry looks at him as though he's forgotten to who he's speaking to, “ You have met me right? I'm the one who gets dragged into things even though I don't want to. And it's not like I willingly start things!”<br/>
Death snorts before reminding Harry who exactly was the hobbit who babysat Bilbo Baggins and told him all those adventures for bedtime, scarring him enough to never want to go on an adventure. Harry flushes to his ears before murmuring that it wasn't exactly his fault, it wasn't like he had anything else to read to the kid and he didn't know any other bedtime stories.</p><p>Death just shakes his head and turns to the mirror, holding up his left hand with the ring and putting it palm facing the glass before whispering in a language that only Harry knew. The moment he finished, the ring started to glow brighter before it's golden color leaves and flies to the mirror, causing the ring to become black. It sinks into the surface, causing it to become uneven before settling down into a golden mirror.</p><p>Death turns to Harry and finds that he has been going around the room collecting his things during the magic. “Ready to go?”<br/>
“ Give me a minute, I still haven't found my daggers.” Harry huffs after still not finding them. Death looks at him amused and states, “You mean they're not under your pillow like they always are.”<br/>
Harry glares at him with a little blush on his cheeks before going over to the bed and flipping over his pillow, finding the daggers exactly where Death said they would be. Harry feels Death’s eyes on his back but doesn't do anything but walk towards the mirror.<br/>
“Don't say anything.” “I wasn't” is all that's said in amusement.<br/>
The moment that Harry touches the mirror, it's surface starts to swirl into a huge spiral.<br/>
“Aren't you going to say goodbye to anyone.”<br/>
Harry tilts his head back and stares at the ceiling for a moment, thinking if there's anyone he wants to let know that he's leaving. “Nobody that's alive anyway.” Is the last thing he says before going into the spiral. Death just shakes his head before entering after him.<br/>
Afterwards, the golden spiral slowly starts to shrink until only the golden surface of the mirror is left and that too starts to fade.</p><p><br/>
Then the door is thrown open and in comes one of the designers holding up a dress with a victorious face while the makeup artist follows in after him giggling all the way. They stop short after they see that they entered an empty room. The victorious expression is slowly starting to be replaced with a terrified one and the designer turns to the artist, making her stop giggling once she sees the expression on his face. “You're sure this is his room? And that he was here!?” By the end of the sentence, he's full on shrieking into her face. All the artist can do is just fearfully shake her head making the designer run out of the room screaming for security while stopping to yell at the servants and asking if they have seen Harry.<br/>
It would not be until much later that they give up on finding him.</p></div>
