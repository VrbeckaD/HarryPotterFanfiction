    <b>Chapter One</b>

</p>
<p>Dean sinks lower on his stool, taking a sip of his beer and looking around the dim room. He's holed up in a bar near Bobby’s place, having snuck away from Bobby and Sam for the night. He's tired of hiding his nightmares from them. His time in Hell had made him twitchy, and he just wants to sit and drink and ignore all his responsibilities for a night. Sam was acting weird, and he and Bobby were watching Dean like a hawk. Add in Castiel showing up and claiming to be an angel of the lord, and Dean is more than ready for a break.</p>
<p>After a couple hours of brooding and drinking, the door to the bar opens and a man about his age steps in. He is a little shorter than Dean, and he looks like he could use some good meals. In spite of this, he holds himself with a kind of banked awareness that screams competence. He sweeps his gaze around the bar, relaxing a little at the empty state of the room, before his eyes catch on Dean. They lock gazes for a minute, before the man looks away and steps up to the bar.</p>
<p>Dean stares for a moment longer before looking back down to his own drink. There was something about the other man that intrigued. For all that he looked like trouble, there was a weariness in his stance that reminded Dean of himself lately. Sighing, he swallows the last of his whiskey and sets the glass down heavily. He jumps when a hand brushes his shoulder lightly, and he twists around to look up into the face of the other man, leaning toward him with a slight smile.</p>
<p>“You look like you could use another, and perhaps some company. Mind if I sit here?” he gestures to the stool next to Dean.</p>
<p>Dean scrutinizes him for a moment before nodding. He has shaggy black hair that hangs almost to his shoulders, and his eyes are a brilliant green. He wears a battered leather jacket much like Dean’s own, and carries himself with a coiled tension that speaks of violence in his past. He settles on the stool and signals the bartender to bring them drinks, then turns to Dean.</p>
<p>“I’m Harry,” he says, smiling and looking Dean up and down appreciatively.</p>
<p>“Dean” he says, offering up his own smile. He isn't usually interested in men, but damn. This Harry is hot, and looks strong enough give as good as he gets. Maybe this is just the thing to get rid of some of his loose energy.</p>
<p>Both men sip quietly at their whiskey for a moment, a comfortable silence surrounding them.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a room at the motel down the road if you’re interested,” Harry speaks quietly.</p>
<p>Dean glances over sharply, wondering for a moment if he can risk leaving with what amounted to a complete stranger, and one who, judging by his accent, isn’t from around here. With a mental shrug, he nods and moves to stand, throwing back his drink and tugging on his jacket. He walks toward the door, Harry trailing after him.</p>
<p>Once outside, Dean pulls out his flask, offering Harry his holy water while keeping his other hand cautiously hovering near where his gun is hidden. Harry gives him a puzzled frown, but takes the flask from him. He sniffs cautiously, raising an eyebrow questioningly at Dean.</p>
<p>Dean smiles tightly, snagging the flask and taking a swig himself before passing it back.</p>
<p>“Just take a sip, alright?”</p>
<p>Harry stares curiously for another moment before shrugging and taking a tentative sip before tightening the cap and passing it back to Dean.</p>
<p>At the lack of reaction, both to the silver of the flask and the holy water within, Dean grins, steering Harry toward the impala.</p>
<p>“Want a ride to this motel of yours?”</p>
<p>“Yeah that’d be great. Left my bike there.”</p>
<p>The motel is just a few blocks away, and Dean can feel the anticipation mounting between them. Harry reaches over, casually walking his fingers up and down Dean’s leg. Dean swings into the motel lot, and Harry leads him over to his room, unlocking the door and flicking on the bedside light, giving the room a soft glow.</p>
<p>Closing the door softly, Dean stalks forward until he is looming over Harry. Harry cocks an eyebrow in challenge, and Dean reaches out and threads a hand through Harry’s hair, tugging him into a harsh kiss. With his other hand, he pulls the shorter man flush against him, resting his palm against Harry’s lower back. Harry’s arms come up to wrap around Dean’s hips, pulling him closer while his mouth opens on a moan. Slowly walking Harry back toward a bed, Dean slips his tongue between Harry’s lips, mapping out his mouth and twining their tongues together.</p>
<p>Harry topples back onto his bed, pulling Dean with him so he is resting snug in the vee of his legs. Wrapping his legs around Dean’s, he undulates his hips, turning Dean’s breath ragged as he thrusts back involuntarily. God, but Harry is driving him wild.</p>
<p>Dean pulls back when he feels Harry scrabbling at his shirt, trying to pull it over his head. He yanks his shirt off and tosses it aside, then quickly divests Harry of his. At that he pauses, taking in the muscled chest under him, arms and chest dotted with scars that showed a life not lived quietly. Around the smaller man’s hips curl a sleeping dragon, head laid out along the seam of his jeans and torso wrapping around to Harry’s back. The tail curls snugly against the other hip. Harry jerks him out of his contemplation by reaching a hand up to brush against the handprint burned into his shoulder. The gentle way Harry traces the unusual burn sends an inexplicable shiver down Dean’s spine, and he reaches out and pets one of Harry’s nipples with a thumb, gratified at the way Harry’s attention snaps back to the moment at hand. Harry’s hands fall back to the bed to rest beside his head, almost as if in surrender. Taking this as a cue, Dean reaches out and grasps Harry’s wrists, pulling them above his head and leaning down to nuzzle at his neck, licking and nipping his way to Harry’s ear.</p>
<p>“Are you going to be good for me, Harry?”</p>
<p>At this, Harry’s breath hitches, and he melts back into the mattress. He turns his face, scraping his cheek along Dean's stubble. Harry rolls his hips against Dean's, and when Dean pulls back, Harry smirks up at him.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you want me to be good, Dean?” Harry purrs.</p>
<p>Cursing at the added friction, Dean grinds down once, hard, then clambers off the bed, tugging off his shoes, jeans and boxers while keeping an eye on Harry. Harry takes this as his cue to do the same, sitting up and pulling off his boots, then wiggling out of his own jeans in a sinuous move that has Dean's mouth going dry.</p>
<p>Dean crawls back on top of Harry, placing hands to either side of Harry’s head and placing biting kisses up his neck, inhaling the heady scent of leather and sweat that clings to the other man. He licks along Harry’s jaw until he reaches his mouth again, melding their lips together and dancing his tongue into the hot mouth below his. Reaching down to caress Harry’s side, he slides lower on the bed, licking and sucking his way down his chest until he reaches a nipple. Sucking the other man’s nipple into his mouth, he bites down sharply, soothing the sting with his tongue. He is gratified to hear Harry moan and pant beneath him at the rough treatment, and digs his hand into the muscled hip. For a moment Dean thinks he feels movement below him where the dragon’s tail is tattooed, but he quickly disregards the thought in favor of licking his way down the taut stomach. Nudging at Harry’s hip with his nose, he bites at the juncture between hip and groin, sucking up a vivid red mark. Harry’s hips buck in response, and Dean grasps the hips firmly, preventing further movement.</p>
<p>By this time, Harry is panting, and his hands have migrated into Dean's hair, tugging and running blunt nails along Dean's scalp. When Dean looks up he sees he is being watched, Harry’s eyes wide and desperate. Licking a stripe up the inside of Harry’s hipbone, he murmurs into his skin,</p>
<p>“You’re being so good for me Harry, so fuckin' hot all laid out for me.”</p>
<p>Before Harry can respond, Dean kisses the head of Harry’s cock before engulfing it in wet heat, swirling his tongue around the underside of the shaft and sucking hard. Harry cries out sharply and goes rigid, fighting his body in order to stay still. His hips jerk in Dean’s hands before Harry regains control.</p>
<p>Dean redoubles his efforts, licking and sucking with enthusiasm. It has been a while since he slept with another man, and he is surprised at how much he missed this. Dean pulls off of Harry's cock, giving the head a swirling lick and pumping the shaft in his hand.</p>
<p>“Oh gods, please I…please. I want. I can’t. I want you inside me. Please, I need…” Harry cries out, struggling not to come under the sudden onslaught.</p>
<p>Dean dips down and gives a final hard suck, accompanied by a squeeze at the base of his cock, drawing a keening moan from Harry before pulling off of Harry’s cock.</p>
<p>“Lube?” Dean rasps hoarsely.</p>
<p>Harry turns, scrabbling at a bag beside the bed, pulling out a bottle of lube and a box of condoms and tossing them to Dean. Catching both, Dean wastes little time slicking his fingers up, running one along Harry's cleft and nudging his hole gently.</p>
<p>Harry lets out a broken moan and Dean grins up at him before sliding one finger inside him, working it in and tugging teasingly at Harry's rim. He swiftly moves up to two, then three fingers, searching out the slighter man's prostate and rubbing persistently while Harry writhes and whimpers under him. Harry reaches down and grasps Dean’s shoulders, urging him up. Dean lets him, easing his fingers out and fumbling on a condom, slicking his cock with more lube and lining the head up with Harry’s hole.</p>
<p>He slowly eases into Harry, leaning down and engaging him in a passionate kiss, swallowing the moans making their way up Harry’s throat as his cock slips past the ring of muscle at Harry’s entrance and slides all the way in until Dean's cock is enveloped in the tight heat of Harry's body. Harry wraps his legs around Dean’s waist and bucks, seating him more firmly inside. Dean pants, holding still until he can regain some control. He eases back until he is barely inside Harry before slamming home again, setting up a punishing pace. Harry scrabbles at his back, tightening his legs around Dean and rocking into each thrust. Dean quickly loses himself in the rhythm, panting into Harry’s neck. He can already feel his climax building, and he wants to bring the other man with him. He changes the angle of his thrusts until he has Harry crying out at every hard shove into his body, then leans in and whispers hoarsely into Harry’s ear,</p>
<p>“Touch yourself. I want to see you come.”</p>
<p>Harry wastes no time, slipping a hand between them and jacking himself harshly. All it takes is a few pulls before Harry is shuddering and coming and slumping boneless into the mattress. The sight of the debauched man beneath him combined with the tightening muscles around Dean had him following Harry after a half dozen more hard thrusts, and Dean crumples, resting his full weight on Harry before regaining enough sense to roll to the side, panting and sated. He looked over at Harry to see his eyes closed and a satisfied smile painted on his lips.</p>
<p>Grunting, Dean staggers up and over to the bathroom, getting rid of the condom and wiping himself off with a warm washcloth before bringing another out to Harry. Smiling languorously, Harry wipes halfheartedly at his chest before crawling under the covers and holding them out for Dean. Slipping into bed, Dean pulls Harry’s body into his, curling around the smaller man before falling asleep almost instantly.</p>
