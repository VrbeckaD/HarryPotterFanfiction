    <p>"Kreacher, I order you to switch the locket and leave with it after I take care of the liquid. You must leave as soon as possible with the locket.And then you must destroy it! It's the only way Kreacher. Listen to me." The young man, who still appeared to be a boy took a shot of the disgusting liquid as his house elf watched, helplessly. </p>
<p>Instantly he was thrown onto the ground, visibly shaken. His mind rushed with thoughts, visions, memories, pain. So many emotions were flooding through him. </p>
<p>He remained silent as the memories attacked him, until they stopped temporarily which he then stood up and headed to the basin again. </p>
<p>"Master Regulus," the house elf said despairingly.</p>
<p>"Kreacher, I hate to ask this of you as I do not wish harm upon you, but will you please force the liquid down my throat so this goes faster? I do not think I will last long if I have to walk over there constantly," the man took another shot and sat down. </p>
<p>"Kreacher would be honored to serve Master Regulus at any time the young Master wishes it," the house elf croaked as he walked over to the basin, head bowed and scooped up a drink of the nasty liquid. </p>
<p>After Kreacher had walked over the silver eyed man, now boy again opened his mouth obligingly. The house elf poured the liquid into his mouth, shakily. </p>
<p>This process repeated itself several times, Regulus whimpering on the floor by the end. </p>
<p>Kreacher had switched the lockets and now stood, hunched of course, looking at his Master, his favorite Master. His voice was more croaky and choked than usual as he spoke, "Would Master like anything else before Kreacher is dismissed?" </p>
<p>The usual sharpness in the grey eyes were replaced with a foggy staring. The tears had stopped but now Regulus had started mouthing words. His voice eventually solidified as he reached out his arm towards the water, "...Siri.. I need him."</p>
<p>Kreacher nodded and then a cracking noise was heard in the air. </p>
<p>Regulus flinched at the noise and lay their helplessly. "Water..." He pushed himself towards the nearby water, ignoring the faces mindlessly staring at him. He reached out his hand and was surprised when someone grabbed onto it. "Sirius." </p>
<p>No one answered. </p>
<p>Regulus felt himself being pulled closer to the water. "Severus?" </p>
<p>Still no answer. </p>
<p>Frustrated, but still too dazed to process anything he continued his query. "Vanity? Talkalot? Mother? Father? Sirius?" </p>
<p>Still no answer. His left hand had been pulled into the water. Water. Waves. Liquid. He liked the water. It was a good idea to go swim. </p>
<p>"Snape? Vanity? Crouch? Mother? Father?Cissy! Siri..." His voice got more faint as he sunk further and further into the arms pulling him into the cold water. </p>
<p>"Siri." A whisper escaped him before the man fell silent. He couldn't talk anymore. He couldn't breathe. Everything hurt. Maybe he needed to just relax into the arms... The arms of his friends, his family, his brother. Sirius was holding him. Everything was fine. </p>
