  <strong>DRACO</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Anyone with the ability to count their five fingers would know that drinking alcohol a day before first day school is the biggest mistake they could make. However, they seemed to ignore it.</p><p>The deafening sound of music flooded his ears and the strong smell of Whiskey ran over his head. Of course Draco wouldn't drink alcohol. At least not when he realizes that he has to give a class first thing in the morning, and that's enough of a problem to add a fucking hangover.</p><p>"Hey, Draco." Neville stumbles toward the crowd of people dancing around him until he finally reaches her side. "Are you coming to dance"</p><p>He has a drink in his hand, and Draco mocks internally because of course Neville Longbottom was going to drink uncontrollably.</p><p>"Tomorrow we have classes. I don't know if you forgot."</p><p>Neville laughs with a shrug. He's clearly drunk. Not enough to take off his clothes and dance in front of Pomfrey, but enough to not be fully aware.</p><p>"Yes, well, the point is to celebrate for today, why don't you come?"</p><p>Draco snorts rolling his eyes. Neville doesn't flinch, and doesn't leave.</p><p>"I'll go to my room," he says, throwing his coat over his shoulder. Neville takes him by the arm and to keep his gaze over him.</p><p>"It's early," he says, coming closer. They're a couple of steps away, he uses it and leans down to whisper in his ear with a laugh. "Enjoy the Night?"</p><p>His breath reeked of alcohol, he probably drank more than fire whiskey.</p><p>"What an idiot you had to be", Longbottom, Draco thought.</p><p>"Precisely what I want is to sleep. That's my way to 'enjoy the night' "</p><p>Draco doesn't expect anything else to put Neville aside and leave the teachers' room where Principal McGonagall came up with to throw a party to celebrate the return to school or Merlin will know why.</p><p>He closes the door behind him, noticing at once that there was a silencing spell in the room. Of course, McGonagall wasn't an idiot.</p><p>He didn't see the reason for holding a second party when there was already a dinner in the great dining room. Would she had a boyfriend and that's why was she in such a good mood?</p><p>Draco barely let out a laugh, even to the echo of the hallway. Maybe her own bad mood was due to how bad all his past relationships had gone. Not counting all the boys and girls he kissed drunk in his teens, there were Blaise Zabini, who left him when he discovered that he was actually more in love with Pansy Parkinson than with him, Tracey Davis was his last attempt to prove himself as such. Maybe he wasn't gay and that's why he couldn't find anyone good enough, but it all resulted in the girl's tears because he really didn't seem to love her. And finally, his story with Terry Boot was no better. Just a couple of disastrous dates that ended in "we can't seem to keep up, we should just leave it here, Draco."</p><p>"Is the hallway so funny?"</p><p>Draco frowns and spins around with a speed he wasn't aware of possessing.</p><p>Of course he didn't expect to find Harry Potter there. Not at that time, not in that place, not talking to him.</p><p>"What the hell are you doing here?"</p><p>Harry goes two steps forward, he tries to back two more. His back hits the wall.</p><p>"Principal McGonagall called me," Harry explains.</p><p>"There are no Death Eaters here, I don't see why she could want you." Draco teases with a notorious <br/>
rudeness in his voice.</p><p>Harry then lowers his gaze slowly down his arm until it stays on his forearm. There's a strange grin on his face and Malfoy can't figure it out. Instinctively he reaches into that spot trying to hide his arm from Harry's gaze. Maybe there's a Death Eater to catch after all.*</p><p>"I'll be a professor," he says. Look up, again they have eye contact. "I have Defense Against the Dark Arts class."</p><p>Draco curses because of course he should have noticed. The party was not for nothing. Minerva would only do something like that for Harry Potter.</p><p>"You?" His voice comes out in an incredulous and very annoying shriek.</p><p>Harry nods. Then Draco notices the huge trunk floating behind him. No one carries a trunk that size for a visit. Especially he must have noticed by the absence of the Auror uniform that was replaced by muggle casual wear.</p><p>"Yes, well-"</p><p>"Harry, you came!"</p><p>Neville opens the door, the noise hits them abruptly. Harry's startled by the sudden appearance, but Draco doesn't even laugh when he sees him jump in place.</p><p>"Hello, Neville," Harry says, smiling. "Too much alcohol again?"</p><p>"You have to drink Flitwick's smoke liquor," he laughs. He notices Draco's presence and points it at him, he rolls his eyes. "Come in Harry, or are you also being a bitter fool?"</p><p>Draco clicks his tongue.</p><p>"Tomorrow don't you'll come to ask me for help with your hangover, Longbottom." He points his finger at it. He rotates in his place ready to go to sleep, perhaps to give himself some attention, or whatever the dream he was feeling in his eyelids gave him.</p><p>"I won't have a hangover," Neville says. Draco smirks.</p><p>"Sure, Longbottom."</p><p>He's leaving.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It's Draco's third year teaching at Hogwarts. He teaches potions because he always thought it was what he was best at. He owed a lot to his godfather.</p><p>In his first year, he had to share an office with Neville. At first as in everything, the matter bothered him excessively, but one thing led to the other and both turned out to be quite good, so being part of the younger teachers of the school was no longer a big problem. In their second year they were given different and separate offices. They were small and did not have the best view, but it was nothing a couple of spells couldn't fix. They were also given the title of heads of house. Of course Draco took Slytherin under his wing. Neville for his part was more interested in having Hufflepuff.<em> "What would Godric Gryffindor thinks of a tremendous felony like that?"</em> Draco had told him when Neville broke the news. <em>"He doesn't give a shit,"</em> Neville replied sipping his tea with a smile behind the cup.</p><p>He liked Neville, he was a good boy and he didn't hate him, which was the important thing at this point. He had a fondness for talking about exotic plants up to his elbows, true, but if you could divert his attention, he was someone interesting to carry on a conversation with. He had become "hot", as the girls defined it, and that led him to receive confessions from students at least once a month. And it would have been funny if it weren't because it was actually scary.</p><p>He admits that it's normal to have a crush with a teacher, he himself had it, but sometimes the students exceeded it. Like that time, at Christmas his first year as a professor where Mathilda Lambert gave him a box of chocolates with amortentia. That was a severe afternoon of talking with her parents and student tears. McGonagall prohibited her from doing it again unless she wanted to be expelled. Of course she didn't stop him in the hallways again, but she still feels their gazes as she passes by the large dining room.</p><p>He barely finishes his breakfast and heads to his classroom in the dungeons. He says goodbye to Neville with a mocking smile when he sees him appear with dark circles under his eyes and an obvious migraine that seems to be drilling his brain.</p><p>"Have a wonderful first day!" Draco yells near Neville.</p><p>"Fucking Merlin, Draco, shut your mouth." Draco responds with a laugh and Neville frowns in pain.</p><p>"I won't even tell you I told you," he says with a humorous look, "but yeah, I told you." Neville mutters something that sounds like go to hell, but ignores it. "Go to my living room after the second hour and I'll make you something."</p><p>"I can't," he laments, "I have a two-hour class with Gryffindor."</p><p>"Well, send someone, I don't know."</p><p>"Fine thanks, dude."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When he arrives at the classroom he finds it empty, however, the students begin to arrive little by little in groups and end up separating by houses. Hufflepuff is on one side while Ravenclaw takes the other end, they're a third year and do not look at each other.</p><p>The atmosphere is tense. Draco clears his throat, going from behind the desk to taking his place in front of it, leaning back. The glances quickly come to him expectantly. A final Ravenclaw student runs in and takes his place in the back. Draco casts a spell and the door closes. He recognizes a some of students, the others have been erased from his memory, or their names just don't seem to be on his mental list.</p><p>He takes a discreet breath, because he is not nervous.*</p><p>"I suppose everyone is here." He glances at the late-arriving Ravenclaw and notices his face turning red. "I thought that the presentations would not be necessary, but if I am honest I do not remember more than half of the students."</p><p>They all stir in their places.</p><p>"Don't worry, I won't ask you to tell me about your life reduced to what you like and what you don't because I certainly don't care if you think Macbeth's Witches is the best RMI band." There's a general laugh. Draco mentally pats himself on the shoulder. "However, I need you to mix with each other. One Ravenclaw and one Hufflepuff in each row."</p><p>The group looks at him in alarm, as if a screw had been removed and he's now whinnying with insanity. Draco narrows his eyes and raises his arms to move them.</p><p>"What's wrong? Did I say it in Danish?" He asks and picks up the list on his desk. <br/>
"Evan McGregor, are you here?"</p><p>A Hufflepuff in the background stumbles to his feet, the group chuckling.</p><p>"It's me?"</p><p>"I don't know, are you?" A new group laugh comes.</p><p>Evan shrugs with a smile.</p><p>"Uhm ... yes, I am, I suppose."</p><p>"Well, you will sit next to ... Roderick Kettleburn. Raise your hand, please."</p><p>Evan stands up carrying his briefcase in his hands. Draco looks at him curious, it's a briefcase decorated with figures that move all over the surface, he has photos glued to the back, Muggle photos that don't move and are quite blurred, he also has small dolls hanging from the strap, and it's probably the briefcase most colorful he had ever seen.</p><p>He advances to the front where Roderick Kettleburn points to the seat next to him.</p><p>"Great! See how easy it's? Now everyone get together with someone from the opposite house to which they belong and stay like this for the rest of the class because those will be their places the rest of the year."</p><p>The movement in the living room makes the place fill with noise. In general, he doesn't notice that there are fighting gestures as he expects to happen with Gryffindor and Slytherin, so he doesn't worry too much and smiles satisfied seeing the new couples he has created as a whole.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Draco was adding the latest ingredients to the calming potion for Neville. He rummages in his closet for the oleander leaves he needs to finish, but he can't find them anywhere. He curses internally because it was obviously a bad idea to start preparing without counting all the ingredients ready and at hand. He keeps looking in the closet until he sees them in a box on top. He takes his wand to bring them with him.</p><p>"Neville sent me for a potion." Harry Potter calls from the door frame. Draco curses as he jumps into his place in shock.</p><p>Of course that idiot was going to send Harry Potter.</p><p>"Damn it, Potter." Do you have to appear out of nowhere all the time?" He growls.</p><p>"Neville sent me for his potion."</p><p>"I heard you the first time, Potter. I'm on it."</p><p>Malfoy moves closer to the cauldron, tosses the oleander leaves one by one mixing at intervals until the potion turns pinkish on its own, he does an approving addition. He takes the volcanic rock next to him and puts it in the cauldron.</p><p>"I have to wait until this floats and it's ready," Draco explains, wiping his hands. Harry comes fully into the room with his hands in his pants pockets and advances the entire length until he's also in front of the desk.</p><p>"He's bad with alcohol," Harry says, looking at the cauldron. He doesn't make eye contact with Draco. "That's, it's generally more resistant. Professor Flitwick said he only had a glass of his smoke liquor."</p><p>Draco looks impatiently at the cauldron, then at the window and back at the cauldron. He doesn't want to be around Potter and he needs that rock to climb so he can give it to him and the guy to go.</p><p>"Come on up pretty, please," Draco thinks without taking his eyes off the potion. He's about to pray to Salazar to get Harry out of his living room and out of his life, if only the guy weren't some dumb idiot.</p><p>"How was your day today?" Draco hates him, wants him far, far away, and very quiet.</p><p>"I had my first class, Potter, the day hasn't even started."</p><p>Harry grimaces. Since when were his eyes so green? Not just green, but seriously, really green. Like two sparkling emeralds in his eyes he would be an idiot if him didn't stop to look.</p><p>"Yes, well, was it a good start?"</p><p>The rock doesn't rise, perhaps if he look at it very closely it will.</p><p>"Yes." He just says. Short words always lead to fewer questions, fewer questions end in silences, generally uncomfortable, but silences after all.</p><p>"I'll have my first class at eleven in the morning," he says. He wants to tell him that he doesn't mind knowing about his class and that he knows he doesn't care either, to stop being friendly or shit, but he doesn't. <br/>
"When I told Neville I was coming he said you would probably be upset."</p><p>Draco stops looking at the cauldron. He arches his eyebrows and crosses his arms. Probably annoying? The devil is wearing it. Neville could have told him that Harry Potter would come to teach at Hogwarts, they were in contact all the holidays, there is no excuse that is worth not having told him.</p><p>"I don't care."</p><p>"You don't look like you don't care tremendously."</p><p>Draco bites the inside of his cheek and sighs heavily. "Don't think I care so much about you, Potter."</p><p>Frowning, Harry nods at him, pointing to the cauldron. The volcanic rock has already gone up, the potion is ready and if he give it to him quicker he'll soon get it out of his sight. He takes a container and pour as much liquid as he can into it. He makes a note with clear instructions and hands him the knob. He takes it and looks at it for a couple of seconds without bothering to thank. He wants to tell him to leave, but it's not necessary because Potter is already leaving the classroom until he stops in the middle and without turning to look at him he says:</p><p>"I thought that we could coexist behaving like adults and not like immature children, I see that it is not like that."</p><p>Potter finally leaves his classroom and his new group of students begins to enter to take their places. Draco calms down trying to suppress the urge to get out and jump on Potter's scoundrel and grind him down. However, he takes a deep breath and does his best for a quiet smile.</p><p>"Good Morning Class."</p><p>He fears that he won't be able to go this year as calmly as he had planned. Although he has never really been able to get Harry Potter around.</p>
