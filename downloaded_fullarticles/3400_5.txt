  <u> <em> <strong>Prologue </strong> </em> </u>
</p><p>
  <strong>He couldn’t say he didn’t exactly expect this. Fate did not exactly favor one Hadrian James Potter in this life. Maybe life beyond this world would be better for him. Then again, maybe not.</strong>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry Potter lived his life as the Wizarding World expected and Albus Dumbledore manipulated him into. He killed the bad guy, lost all of his family, and married the girl he knew drugged him to love. Ginny Weasley-Potter killing him shortly after her oldest child (not his child, none of them were) was not something that surprised him.</p><p>He long ago unlocked the blocks <em>Albus Fucking Dumbledore</em> put on his magical core with the help of the goblins after paying back his part of damaging the bank. The fines they levied against Weasley and Granger were much worse (to his secret enjoyment and delight). Along with those blocks came the memory charms, love potions, loyalty spells, the theft of his vaults, and the highly illegal spells that blocked much of his abilities.</p><p>After finding out his entire life had been a lie and he was manipulated for much of it, he just went through the motions of the life the Wizarding World desired. He continued as an Auror, left Ginny believe he didn’t know that his kids weren’t his, and hung around the traitors that called themselves his friends.</p><p>That all came to a stop when James Sirius Potter (though he was legally under the name Weasley in the archives of the Ministry and Gringotts Bank without Ginny’s knowledge) went to Hogwarts. Albus Severus (and wasn’t that just a fitting name for the horrible little weasel) who was then nine and Lily Luna (a decidedly horrible name for the terrible little blighter) was then seven. Ginevra Molly Weasley poisoned him that night.</p><p>Of course, he knew about the poison (the loyalty of a house elf is a priceless thing to have) and had prepared for this. At least he didn’t have to see her lying face everyday now.</p>
