    <p>Albus Severus Potter was pacing up and down the Potter's sitting room, getting more worked up by the second. His sister Lily and best friend Scorpius were there too, but neither of them were as bothered as Albus was.<br/>
Lily was fiddling with her hair and eating sweets. Scorpius sat on the Potter's scarlet cushy armchair and smiled gently. He kept pushing his platinum blond hair out of his eyes, he was in need of a haircut. </p><p> </p><p> Albus' messy brown hair bounced up and down with each step he took, and he rolled his hazel eyes up to heaven for the upteempth time.</p><p> </p><p>"Ugh," Albus grumbled, "Why does Rose need to visit? She seemed to be getting on fine in France!"<br/>
"Albus, you know why! Mum told us about a week ago!" Lily said, innocently. She knew well that wasn't what he meant, but seeing her brother so stressed, she couldn't help but take advantage.<br/>
"Lily, I swear to god, you better shut -"<br/>
"Lulu..! Stop winding up your brother!" Harry intervened from the kitchen.<br/>
Albus wasn't too fond of the way his dad kept sticking up for him all the time, but he could see he didn't mean any harm, so he didn't get annoyed.<br/>
Lily started to bite into a chocolate frog, and sulked slightly.</p><p> </p><p>"Albus," Scorpius suddenly said, sitting up, "Do you think Rose will finally go out with me?"<br/>
"I don't know!" Albus snapped, suddenly very defensive. He didn't like when Scorpius talked about Rose like that, but he didn't quite know why. Maybe it was because his cousin was so mean to Scorpius..?<br/>
Yeah, that's it. That's gotta be it. Albus thought.</p><p> </p><p>"It's just," Scorpius continued, oblivious to Albus' icy tone, "She wasn't so bad to me at the end of last year, and that's some sort of an improvement."<br/>
Albus turned around, looked Scorpius in his greyish blue eyes, and said calmly to him, "She's turned you down in four languages, you know." </p><p>"Ah, yes, 'Nein', 'Non', 'Ne', and the ever popular, 'Ain't gonna happen!' " Scorpius said, smiling. "But that doesn't mean she won't change her mind!"<br/>
Albus sighed and slightly grimaced. His usually level-headed best friend fantasised quite a bit when it came to Rose.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                       ______________</p><p> </p><p>Albus didn't get on very well with Rose, and had quite a 'friendly' rivalry. Ever since they both started Hogwarts she didn't talk, nor show any notice of being related to Albus. She was, to be honest, very rude, but she didn't seem to notice, or maybe she just didn't care. She, Hugo, Hermione and Ron had been staying in France over the summer with Bill, Fleur, and their kids. </p><p>However, Rose decided she wanted to come home for a while, much to a Albus' annoyance. She was almost always extremely haughty and her snobby sense drove Albus up the wall. Rose wasn't a bully, far from it actually, but just didn't get along with Albus. They were both very headstrong, and went against each other's opinions. It wasn't a good mix.</p><p>Rose and Lily had a good relationship, and they often chatted for hours on end. Lily had always liked Rose, and although Rose could be bossy, she was fond of Lily and acted like a big sister. Not that Lily needed protection, oh no, Lily could very well take care of herself, thank you very much. She was extremely bright but didn't put much effort into her work, unlike her fellow Ravenclaws.</p><p>She had a fair few friends, but Lily's closest was an Irish muggleborn, called Ciara McMahon. She was from the west coast of Ireland, and Lily had taken a shine to her.<br/>
They had become friends in early second year, and although Lily'd never admit it, she envied Ciara's silky caramel hair, as opposed to her auburn curls. She also loved her friend's deep blue eyes, they were so captivating..</p><p>Lily was going into her fourth year now, and couldn't wait to see her best friend again.<br/>
She only hoped her friend would stay before the summer holidays end. 


</p><p>Suddenly, the oldest Potter child sauntered into the sitting room, interrupting everyone's thoughts.<br/>
James looked very like Albus, but he had inherited his mother's brown eyes, unlike the mixed hazel his siblings had. He also had very defined cheekbones, unlike anyone else in the family. The blue t-shirt he was wearing had a ketchup stain near the collar, but his jeans were pristine. </p><p>"What's the gathering for?" James asked, laughing.<br/>
"Rose's coming today," Lily explained, "So Albus is planning something."<br/>
"Ah," James said wisely.<br/>
He plonked himself down beside Scorpius on another armchair, the chair squeaking as he sat down. </p><p>"No seriously, do you think Rose'll --"<br/>
"Scorpius!" Albus screeched. That was very unlike him, and everyone stared confused at Albus as he felt his cheeks flushing.<br/>
<em>Why did I do that?</em> Albus mentally shouted at himself.</p>
