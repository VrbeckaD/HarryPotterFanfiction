    <hr/>
<p>It was already late afternoon, most witches and wizards had come home and called it a day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even a certain politician who infamous for his icy gaze and slight mysterious smile that destroyed and restored the wizard community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Light blond hair moved gently to the breezes then ‘Apparate’ away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reappeared at the front door. Relieving himself of his coat, briefcase, and other work relatives in his study. He also took the chance to change in to something more comfortable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He could feel two more presents in the house and moved toward them. In the sitting room, the scene that greeted him was one that he will not be getting bored anytime soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the sofa near the fireplace were two dark figures. One was reading a book while another was laying along the sofa with their head on the former’s lap. The latter appeared to be sleeping.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of them looked up and smiled at him. His emerald eyes were as mesmerizing as always.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Welcome home, how was your day?” a soft voice asked, kind and warm, affectioned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Better now that I’m home” he said, moving closer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He observed the sleeping form. A questioned look direct at the one he was speaking to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another smile answered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He pulled another all-nighter and only came back just a few hours ago”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ah, I assume the experiment was a success?” he asked. A hand reached out to move few strands hair out of the sleeping man face. Touch gentle, the man did not even stir.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>”Would he have rested if it did not?” a laugh was definitely in there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He drew his eyes back to him. Eyes full of mirth. Oh, how he adored them.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p>They are not fixed. They are not tamed. They are not controlled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He gave them a focus point, true. Draw all of their attention to him and away from other people. He protects them even now. Such ignorance little bugs they are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, such things are not of importance. Why?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Simple, because at long last they are together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where they are meant to be. As they will remain so forever more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And anyone who dare to contradict that fact will pay dearly, painfully. A reminder from before.</p>
