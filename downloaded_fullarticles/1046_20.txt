    <p>There you were. A witch from a muggle family transferred to Hogwarts at your fourth year to attend your first Potions Class.</p><p>You’ve heard a lot about your Potions Professor. They said he was a true embodiment of evil. Every living soul at Hogwarts feared him, but for some students this fear joined hatred while for others – respect. He was one of the greatest and most powerful wizards of all time and he was going to teach you.</p><p>You’ve been at Hogwarts for a week but you failed to find at least one friend. You were mocked for being mudblood and no one wanted to mess with you.</p><p>You felt excited and very nervous before your first class. You were sitting at your desk just in front of the Professor’s table because nobody wished to take the seat so close to him.</p><p>Finally a tall man dressed in black from head to toes entered the room. </p><p>The students froze.</p><p>He swiftly came up to his table crossed his arms on his chest and scanned all the students attending his class with a sullen look.</p><p>“I suggest to get to work at once.” He said with a low voice which caused shivers go down your spine.</p><p>“Who can name the basic principles of potions making?” His glance jumped from one student to another and stopped on you. “Well it must be you who’d been transferred from Desmanpath?” He asked rising an eyebrow. “Let’s see what you’ve learned there.” He gave you an arrogant look considering you would fail.</p><p>You answered his question, and another one, and another…</p><p>“Bravo, Miss…?” He wanted to know your name.</p><p>“Y/L/N, Y/N Y/L/N.” You replied humbly and felt blood pulsating at your temples from anxiety.</p><p>He asked you few more questions. You knew the answers for all of them.</p><p>“Enough!” He interrupted you abruptly. “Write down the topic.”</p><p>He started dictating what you’ve just told him. Snape was very surprised and impressed because Desmanpath was known as the weakest and the most useless school of magic.</p><p>During the lecture he sometimes asked you questions which you could hardly answer because the topic was new for you, even though you’ve heard about the subject superficially, and did your best not to screw up. The rest just blinked their eyes. Snape grew interested in you and decided to watch you.</p><p>After the lecture Professor named the pages of the textbook which should be studied for the next class.</p><p>“Besides you, Miss Y/L/N,” his words came out loud and ominous, “you will go to the library and take the book in a special section presenting this.” He handed you a sheet of paper with the title written on it and his signature below. “They won’t give it without professorial permission.” He said slowly and still strictly. “Study the material relating to today’s topic. Extra reading is not prohibited.” He shut his notebook, got up from the table and went into the room adjacent to the classroom.</p><p>“Like showing off you idiot?” Someone cried out in your back when everybody was leaving the class. “Brought yourself an extra task.”</p><p>“So what?” You snarled. “It will be useful to me, and you will not even retell what is written in your textbook next time!”</p><p>Snape heard this squabble and stealthily looked out from behind the door to see who he was going to interrogate with passion the next Potions Class.</p><p>The next class he began with a quiz. Snape gave you not a single glance. But to your surprise he started asking the boy who called you an idiot last time. You smirked gloatingly and rejoiced this fortunate coincidence which actually wasn’t one.</p><p>“Mr. Downer, you are a complete disappointment!” concluded Snape with disdain. “You should go back to elementary school, but even then you will continue dishonoring the name of the wizard.” He no longer honored him with attention.</p><p>During the lecture you carefully observed the sinister professor, but he didn’t pay attention to you either. You studied his long hump nose, his broad forehead with black hair hanging over it, the deep wrinkle between his frowning eyebrows, his black cold eyes, his mouth never having shown even a shadow of a smile. He had broad shoulders and big arms. In general, externally he was attractive, but this barrier of indifference and detachment did not allow to love him. He instilled fear and thrill.</p><p>He deliberately didn’t look at you, although he’s been waiting impatiently all the previous day to see you again. While you were bowing over your notebooks, he secretly watched you. Strict hairstyle, pale skin, these black lace cuffs and collar. He also had time to examine you. You reminded him of a young teacher, but not a student. You differed considerably from the rest of the students.</p><p>He denied that he liked you. He did not want to admit it to himself and drove these thoughts away and, in order to convince himself that he was indifferent to you, he spoke to you in a harsh and rude manner he did with the others. But every day you appeared in his thoughts more and more frequently.</p><p>You had Potions Classes every day as well as DADA so you met at least twice a day, except weekends. You got used to seeing him often and in the days free from studies you started missing his low deep voice.</p>
