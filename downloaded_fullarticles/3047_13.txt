    <p>1789-1797 George Washington (Independent)</p><p>Washington was the first American President and in the opinion of many, the best. Washington had previously served as commander of the American armies during the Revolutionary War, where he had slain hundreds of redcoats single handedly, riding on his giant bald eagle. Washington's rule was wise and noble, as he sought to ensure that the United States would always be a font of liberty in the world and never become too involved in the affairs of other nation. Washington was famously completely unable to lie, which helped him to earn the trust of the American people. Fearful of giving the president too much power, Washington opted to seek only two terms as president. Upon leaving the Presidency, he was carried off to heaven by the goddesses Columbia and Victoria.</p>
