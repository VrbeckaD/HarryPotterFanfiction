    <p>Peter Parker was not a normal 16 years old teenager. He was one upon a time, but not anymore. He led two lives: the ordinary and the superhero. In his ordinary life, he was known as the high school geeky student, Peter Parker. Yet, what most people didn't know was that he was Spider-Man. The web-slinging superhero and protector of New York. He had been a superhero for only a little over a few years and it had brought him great adventures and tragedies. </p><p>The teenager sighed as he ran his fingers through his hair in tiresome. He walked alone from school to his house. It was a chilly day for mid-November. It wasn't too bad, but it was uncomfortable. It felt like somebody continued to poke at him and he couldn't get them to stop.</p><p>Peter felt his head pound slightly at the thought of earlier that day. He and his team had to protect John-with-too-many-J's-in-his-name, or as he liked to call him, J.J., from the Beetle. Not only was he forced to listen to J.J.'s accusations of him being a criminal, but he also had to protect his female best friend, Mary Jane. She was in the Daily Bugle for an interview. The only good thing was that, in the end of the day, he didn't have to listen to J.J.'s accusations anymore. Even though he protected the man, somewhat, he was still a criminal in his mind. Seriously, Peter could not understand how the old man's mind worked. He guessed that it was better to not know.</p><p>The brown-haired young man walked up the street that leads to his house. He lived there with his Aunt May, his only living relative. Peter's mouth straightened in an unpleasant manner, as he remembered his uncle. His tired blue eyes landed on his house, but he stopped at the sight in front of him. There was a car in front of the house, one that he did not recognize. He straightened his back and ran to his house. Once he reached there, he threw the front door open then marched inside.</p><p>"Aunt May? What's with the car-?"</p><p>The brown headed adolescent stopped in his tracks when he saw an odd sight. His aunt sat in the living room with a middle-aged woman and a child, whom sat between the women. The mysterious woman wore a business suit and small high hills. Her blond hair was put up in a tight bun, not one strain of hair was out of its captivity. She had a stern look on her youthful tanned face. Her brown eyes were hard with a touch of sadness and worrisome. The child looked to be about three. He was small and unnaturally fragile. He wore clothes that were three times too big on him with round broken glasses that were too big for his small face. He looked more like a worn out lifeless doll than a human being. It frightened Peter. Who was this kid?</p><p>"Peter, I'm so glad that you're back home."</p><p>His Aunt May said in great relief. She was an old, average height woman with white hair and blue eyes. Her face had wrinkled a little from years full of smile and laughter. She was a kind elderly woman with a big heart and a young spirit, though at times she did have her moments.</p><p>"Aunt May, what's going on here?"</p><p>Her nephew interrogated her once again, as he tried to figure out what was going on. His aunt waved her hand at the mysterious woman as she answered.</p><p>"Peter, this is Mrs. Armstrong, a social worker."</p><p>Peter frowned in confusion. He sat down on the only armchair that wasn't occupied. This didn't make any sense, and <em>why is there a kid here</em>?</p><p>"Why is there a social worker here? You don't abuse me or anything."</p><p>"No, but I'm afraid that your cousin here was."</p><p>Mrs. Armstrong explained. The small child froze when he realized that the woman spoke about him. He brought his knees close to his chest, almost curling into a ball. It was as if he was afraid that something was going to happen to him. Peter's blue eyes widened at the news. He looked at the shaken child to take some mental notes about his appearance. The mysterious child looked <em>nothing</em> like him or his aunt. <em>He's your cousin you idiot!</em> A voice snarled inside Peter's mind. Then the word <em>cousin</em> finally sank in. The adolescent’s mouth opened a bit in an <em>o</em> shape.</p><p>"I don't understand, since when did I have a cousin? I have only one relative and that's Aunt May."</p><p>It didn't make any sense. His aunt would have told him if they had more family members out there... right?</p><p>His aunt shook her head. She looked at the child and ran her fingers through his black messy hair, getting a flinch in responds.</p><p>"I was surprised too, but it appears that we do have family, but a very distant one." His aunt explained softly, once more looking up at her older nephew. "They live in England."</p><p>Okay, that was pretty surprising. He has a family in <em>England</em>?<em> </em>Well, wasn't that something. Peter wished to ask what happened to them, but first he wanted to figure out the name of his newfound cousin.</p><p>"What's his name?"</p><p>The hardness on Mrs. Armstrong's face broke, being replaced with gentleness. She looked at the unnamed child and placed her hand on his back with care. He flinched at the touch.</p><p>"Sweetheart, why don't you introduce yourself?"</p><p>Peter looked at the child now, where one thing caught his attention. Once the two males looked at each other, he was in awe. The hue of the eyes that the child had were <em>emerald</em>. How that was possible the teenager didn't know. Deep down, he noticed that they held a look that no child should have. They were filled with fear, pain and awareness. It was as if he was a soldier that just came back from war and expected to be attacked any second now. The child looked down at his lap as he mumbled, with a hint of shakiness.</p><p>"U-Uncle Vernon and A-Aunt Petunia call m-me f-freak, b-but my name is H-Harry."</p><p>At the sound of his true name, the child, Harry, looked a bit cheerful. It was as if he just discovered his name. One that was not meant as an insult and harm. Peter's eyes narrowed. <em>Freak</em>? Why would his relatives call him a freak? That thought made his blood boil in anger. As if his mind was read, Mrs. Armstrong spoke once again with a hard tone.</p><p>"He just found out that his name is Harry Potter. We still do not know why, but his aunt and uncle have called him freak for the last 4 years of his life. Ever since he was left with them when he was only a year old."</p><p>"Wait a second, he's <em>5</em>?"</p><p>Peter stared at the lady in complete shock. His aunt looked disgusted, as if she just ate something foul.</p><p>"Those monsters barely fed him! Not only that, but they also physically and emotionally abused him and neglected him for their son."</p><p>Harry looked much shaken up now that all eyes were on him. He looked at each one of them in a quick manner, like a wounded, wild animal being pushed into a corner.</p><p>"I-I'm sorry!" He choked out. He looked ready to cry, but refused to. Once more he curled into a tight ball. "I-I wasn't a-a good boy. I-I deserved i-it-"</p><p>"Harry, those people had no right to do what they did to you. You're a wonderful boy, a strong one at that for going through what you did."</p><p>Mrs. Armstrong spoke to him softly. Harry didn't answer. The middle-aged woman sighed deeply. She looked at the relatives with an apologetic, tired, look. She explained to them.</p><p>"It's going to be hard for you to look after him, but there-"</p><p>"Wait a second! Look after him?" Peter cut her off. He got a stern look from his aunt at the harsh way he made his statement sound. He quickly said to explain his sudden behavior. "Mrs. Armstrong, we have a hard time supporting ourselves. How are we going to be able to support him too?"</p><p>"That shouldn't be much of a problem. Harry's parents left him some money to pay for his schooling and extra for anybody that looks after him." The way that she said it made Peter note with interest that something was off. It didn’t help that she continued to look at Harry's forehead. What was that about? "Just go to the main bank and say that you'll need to take out money from Harry Potter's account. They'll take you to a person that looks after his account. Make sure to show them this card."</p><p>The blond middle-aged woman then handed to his aunt a card with information printed on it. In the background there was a huge letter 'M' with a stick go through the middle.</p><p>"The way that you talk about his parents it sounds like they expected to die early."</p><p>Peter finally spoke after a long few moments. His blue eyes once more looked towards the small child. Harry looked like he wished for the couch to open up and swallow him. Mrs. Armstrong waved off his suspicion.</p><p>"His parents had a murderer track them down for a while before Harry was born. All you have to know is that they died. This led to Harry being sent to his closest relatives Mr. and Mrs. Dursley." She looked at the two other adults in the room with a blank expression, though her eyes held interest. "After Harry's abuse was discovered, we did a little digging and discovered that he had other relatives, you two."</p><p>Satisfied for now, Peter kept his mouth shut and thought about the situation. He half listened to the conversation between the two women. Mrs. Armstrong spoke about the help that was available for Harry to help him move on from his abuse. She gave tips on what to do when Harry was frightened or acted in a weird manner. Then there was the do’s and don'ts and so on. Something wasn't right. Peter didn't need his spider senses to come to that conclusion. That woman held back information, ones that were important. Why did the murderer kill Harry's parents? Was the murderer ever caught? What was so important about the Potters that they had a murderer after them? None of this seemed to add up.</p><p>Peter was snapped out of his mind when he saw that Mrs. Armstrong got up from the couch.</p><p>"I must be going, it's getting late. I'll have my assistant send you by mail documents about the Dursley's trial that'll happen soon. I'll come back at a more convenient time with a lawyer. If you have any questions just call me."</p><p>She handed over another card to his aunt. Aunt May nodded.</p><p>"Thank you, Mrs. Armstrong."</p><p>The elderly woman said as she got up. Mrs. Armstrong shook her head.</p><p>"It is not a problem. Just promise me that you'll look after him, especially if he doesn't turn out to be what you’d expect."</p><p>The aunt and nephew looked at her puzzled at the plea. What they didn't expect? What did she mean by that?</p><p>With a final farewell, Mrs. Armstrong left. Peter walked over to the windows and pushed away the pale curtains slightly. He looked out of the window towards the front lawn and watched as she got into the unfamiliar car then drove off into the night. Once she was out of sight, he let go of the curtains. The fabric lightly fell into its previous position as if it was never disturbed. His blue eyes looked at the frightened child on the couch, not having moved an inch. Aunt May sat down next to Harry.</p><p>"Harry, you'll be sleeping at the guest bedroom-"</p><p>She began to speak with gentleness, but was cut off by the frightened child.</p><p>"I-I can't! Freaks aren't a-allowed to sleep in beds."</p><p>Harry stuttered in pure horror. He looked around him, as if something, or <em>somebody</em>, was about to come and punish him. Peter frowned. He walked over to kneel in front of his cousin. Though, he had to move with care. He didn’t want to scare the child off.</p><p>"Where did you sleep before?"</p><p>The 5 years old looked down at his slightly too big worn out shoes, finding them interesting.</p><p>"Sweetheart, where did you sleep?"</p><p>Aunt May repeated her nephew's question, as she tried not to startle her newfound nephew. Harry mumbled. He still refused to meet their eyes.</p><p>"T-The cupboard u-under the s-stairs."</p><p>Peter's blood boiled once again. They threw a child into a cupboard and made him think that it was his room? Who did that? Well, apparently those monsters did. He was pretty sure that not even the villains he fought would treat an innocent child like this. The 16-year-old looked at his aunt. He saw how pale she looked, paler than usual.</p><p>"Harry, you will not be sleeping in a cupboard while you're living with us. <em>Ever</em>! That is not a place that anybody should sleep in. It's used only to put things in like cleaning supplies."</p><p>Peter said firmly. He would not even let the boy near a cupboard if he had to. If anything, to get him to snap out of the routine. Harry snapped his head to look up at his newfound relatives. His emerald eyes widened in shock. They began to water.</p><p>"I-I can't! I-I'm a freak!" He objected. Why did these people let him have a bed? Only Dudley was allowed to have a bed aside from his aunt and uncle, because he was a good boy. Didn't they understand that he was a bad boy? A freak at that? "I-I can sleep i-in the cupboard-"</p><p>"Nonsense, you're a growing boy. Growing boys should have a comfortable bed to sleep in." Aunt May interrupted the ranting. "Peter is right. You will <em>not</em> sleep in anything <em>but</em> a bed while you're living with us."</p><p>"B-But it's against the r-rules-"</p><p>Harry tried again, but neither of his relatives would have it. Though, they were suspicious when they heard him say 'rules'. Peter looked up at the time.</p><p>
  <em>8:34</em>
</p><p>"Aunt May, I know it's a bit early, but I think it's time to put him into bed."</p><p>The elderly woman looked at the time, a look of surprise coloured her face.</p><p>"Oh my! You're right." She looked at her younger nephew then her older one with a plea look. "I know you must be tired, but can you help Harry clean up while I go prepare the bed?"</p><p>"Of course, Aunt May."</p><p>Peter agreed with a bit of hesitation. She was right, he was tired, but not from what she must have thought. Yet, he hesitated because he wasn't sure what to do if the kid started to freak out. Even with advice, nothing could prepare him for what might happen. For all he knew, his cousin could become violent, which the woman warned them about. He wasn't worried about being hurt, but more so for the little boy hurting himself. Peter looked down at his cousin.</p><p>Harry looked quite startled at the fact that he was allowed to take a shower. There was a little bit of happiness that bubbled in his heart, something that felt so unfamiliar. He rarely was allowed to get cleaned up unless he got really dirty or he smelled pretty bad. Yet, he was afraid that he'd have to get cleaned with cold water. It hurt his body, especially with all the open wounds.</p><p>"Harry, the washroom is on the second floor the first on the right. Get undressed. I'll be right there."</p><p>Harry clenched his hands at his sides into tight fists. After a long moment of hesitation, he gave a stiff nod and slowly made his way upstairs in a clumsy manner due to his clothing. The child almost let out a strangled sob, but held the sound back. He didn't want them to hit him if he didn't do as they say. He felt eyes on his back, but he refused to look bac. It was due to pure fear of what they might do to him.</p><p>Once he was on the second floor, Peter and Aunt May looked back at each other.</p><p>"Does he have any clothes he can change into?"</p><p>The teenager asked. He did not bother to point out to the woman about the strange way Harry was acting. He would talk to her about that <em>after</em> they put Harry into bed. The old woman frowned.</p><p>"Mrs. Armstrong brought a small suitcase."</p><p>Aunt May walked over to the corner of the couch that hid from view from the position at the doorway. She took out a rather small, worn out suitcase. She put it onto the couch, snapped the clicks and opened the case. She gasped at the sight in front of her. Peter felt a dreadful feeling wash over his body as he walked over. He held back a snarl of disgust at the sight. He took out one piece of clothing at a time. All were three times too big. Some of the clothes were teenage medium size, but from the designs it was made for a child that was overweight. They were all were worn out, ripped with holes and smelled really bad. By the time that they went through the suitcase, there were only a handful of clothing. They were all hand-me-downs.</p><p>Never had Peter seen something like this done to a child before. He wasn't naive to child abuse, but he never truly seen one so up close. He threw the clothes back into the suitcase and slammed it shut.</p><p>"We'll need to get him new clothes right away."</p><p>Peter stated the obvious while he looked at his aunt. Aunt May nodded. </p><p>"I'll take him tomorrow. I'll go look if we still have some of your older clothes."</p><p>She told him. She could use that time to bond with the child and figure more things out about his past. The taller young man nodded, though he was somewhat hesitant. He wanted to ask whether she wanted him to join them, but then again he had other things to do.</p><p>"All right, I'll go get him cleaned up."</p><p>Once he got a nod from his aunt, he left.</p><p>It didn't take him long to reach the bathroom. He walked in when Harry began to take his shirt off. His blue eyes stared straight away at the back, which faced him at the moment. There were bruises that were in shapes of adult and child fists, burns and what appeared to be belt marks. Some of the wounds were fresh while the rest looked old. He cringed when he saw the spine, as it appeared clear as day. What else disturbed him were the words that were clearly <em>carved </em>into the flesh. <em>Freak, no good,</em> <em>die</em>. Those people made him sick! Why would they carve something like that into a child? Once Harry turned around, he once more cringed at how much the older man saw in detail the boy's ribs. His stomach barely existed and looked ready to meet the spine. He looked like a skeleton. Peter cannot believe he was related to such monsters. SHIELD itself better be able to hold him back if he ever met them.</p><p>Harry looked up at him startled. He took off the rest of his clothes with haste, so to not get punished for being slow. After he did that, he looked down at his bare feet. He waited for the cold water and pain to come. The little boy listened as the heavy, but somewhat light, footsteps walked past him. A second later the water was turned on. He flinched. He didn't look forward to taking a bath. A few minutes have gone by, the room was completely silent except for the sound of water running.</p><p>Finally, it stopped.</p><p>Harry was startled when he was picked up, <em>gently</em>, only to be put into the warm knee-deep water. The 5 years old looked up at his cousin, confused at the unfamiliar behaviour. The teenager could have ordered him to get into the bath. He could have used cold water. Harry didn't get sick, because apparently freaks rarely get sick. Harry nearly cried out in pain when he felt something gently rub against his back. Peter put an arm into the water in front of the child to keep him steady. Without a second thought his arm was wrapped by two small, thin arms.</p><p>"I know it hurts, but if we don't clean these fresh wounds they'll get infected."</p><p>Peter spoke with gentleness. A bit relaxed when he saw the child didn’t attack him. Yet, his heart clenched at the cries of pain.</p><p>"Y-You don't h-have to do t-that. I-I'll be fine."</p><p>Harry said in a choked sob voice. He froze in fear. He expected the older male to now smack him across the head for being a cry baby. He flinched when, instead, a hand rubbed his side gently. It was as if it was meant for comfort, something that was foreign for the child. He didn't understand why the teenager would comfort a freak like him. He was being a cry baby. He didn't deserve to be cared for, comforted or loved. He should be grateful that he even had a roof over his head.</p><p>"Harry, I will tell you this. Nobody in this house will punish you like those people did. And if somebody hurts you, tell us. You don't deserve this. Do you hear?"</p><p>Peter answered his cousin seriously. He meant every word he said.</p><p>Harry didn't reply.</p><p>Once more, silence filled the room. The only sounds this time were that of scrubbing, a bit of pained sobs and water splashing. It stayed like that for a little while, but was broken when Peter stopped to lean over to pull the plug. He then stood up and went to grab a towel. Harry watched the liquid escape into the hole; redness mixed in. It appears that his fresh wounds bled a bit by the amount of blood that went through. Harry was then picked up once more, only to be put onto the rug. He watched with wide emerald eyes as Peter turned around to the inner closet inside the bathroom. He dug in there for only a minute to take out a red big, fluffy towel. Harry was in awe at how soft it felt compare to the rough rags that his aunt and uncle let him use. He felt so relaxed that not even the pain from his back snapped him out of this heavenly experience.</p><p>Peter didn't stop the smile when he saw Harry lean into the towel, much like a little kitten. The brown headed teen walked over to the cupboard under the sink. He opened it only to take out a bottle that said Pero Vap in big letters. He returned to the child, whom stared at the bottle with wide eyes.</p><p>"Turn around"</p><p>Peter told him. Harry hesitated but did as he was told. Peter looked at the wounds and nodded when he saw that it was only minor wounds that opened. He sprayed the colourless liquid onto the wounds. Once he put a few bandages on, he wrapped the towel slightly tight around the child before picking him up. He headed towards the only guest room in the house.</p><p>The guest bedroom was a little decorated. The bedroom's walls were dark green, with a double sized bed in the middle that had the same colored covers. There was a closet that was build inside the room. Then there was one long deep brown drawer that got pushed up against one wall. Other than that, this room was... guestish. It wasn't a real word, but it pretty much summed up what the room looked like. It seems that they would need to buy a few things to make it more personal. Peter stopped at the foot of the bed when he saw some familiar clothes that rested on the covers. They were small, old fashioned and for younger children. They used to be his when he was as small as Harry. He'd need to thank his aunt for finding them later after he put Harry into bed.</p><p>Peter put Harry on top of the bed. The child wiggled a bit from the uneven surface, but didn't fall. The kid hugged the warm, soft towel closer to his small frame. He stared with wide eyes once again as his cousin began to dress him in clothes that <em>fit</em> him for once. He stared in awe at the warmness that they provided. He didn’t care at all that they were made for a younger person, not that he knew. They were better than his Dudley’s clothes any day.</p><p>After Peter finished getting him dressed up, he laid him in bed. The teenager watched with a frown at the reactions that he saw over small things. Though, it made sense since it was quite a big difference from the cupboard. Harry began to tear up once again.</p><p>"I-I can't sleep h-here. T-This is t-t-too good for me."</p><p>"Harry, you deserve to sleep in a bed with clothes that fit. Forget what your aunt and uncle told you." Peter told the little boy. He tugged the child in a bit more, to make sure that he didn't get cold during the night. He took off the large glasses to put them on the night stand to his right. "You're a little boy that should be looked after, treasured. They have no excuse for what they did to you."</p><p>Harry cried even more. Peter wasn't sure what to do when he saw that. He thought back to the younger days when he came back home crying. Unsure if it would work, he began to stroke the black messy hair. He hoped that this would work, because if it won't then he didn't know what to do. The last thing that he wanted was for him to freak out and have a frightened child in his hands. Peter paused for only a second as he took note that they would need to take the child to get a haircut soon. Not only that, but he could do with better glasses. Remembering his old glasses, Peter could tell up close that Harry's glasses were more of a toy. If they don't get him real glasses soon, they could damage his eyesight. If they didn’t already, which he hoped that it wasn’t the case.</p><p>For a long time, Peter sat at the corner of the bed. He continued to stroke the dark, messy hair until Harry fell asleep from emotional exhaustion.</p><p>The brown headed 16 years old got up. He strolled over to the doorway to switch the lights off. Then walked downstairs towards the kitchen, where he knew his aunt must be. Just as he thought, the second he walked into the kitchen he saw the elderly woman shook her head in disbelief. She must have thought of Harry from the puzzled look on her face.</p><p>"Aunt May?"</p><p>Peter asked. Aunt May snapped out of her thoughts. She looked up at her older nephew with an alarmed look.</p><p>"Did you see any wounds on Harry?"</p><p>She asked urgently, which received a slow nod in return. He was puzzled that she knew about them. Did that woman tell her or did she suspect from the mention of physical abuse?</p><p>"Yes"</p><p>"Mrs. Armstrong told me he has nasty wounds all over his body, but he refused to let me see them. Are they as bad as she makes it out to be?"</p><p>Peter's face darkened at the memory of what he saw in the bathroom. His jaw tightened, making his teeth squeak a bit at the sudden force.</p><p>"Aunt May, he's covered with wounds. Not only are there bruises, but there are also scars." The more he talked the paler the woman looked. "That's not the worst. Those people have carved words into his skin like <em>freak</em> and even <em>die</em>!"</p><p>"Those... those monsters!" His aunt cried out in disbelief. "He's just a little boy."</p><p>The two relatives decided to move to the dining room to sit down before the elderly woman collapsed from shock. Neither of the two said anything for a long time. Aunt May buried her face into her hands, hiding the look of disbelief and tears that she shed on the behalf of the child. Peter's hands that rested on the table clenched into tight fists. He felt sick from what he saw. He just could not fathom how people could do something like that. He heard many cases of child abuse, but seeing one was a whole different matter.</p><p>One thing for sure, Peter wasn't going to turn the child away after what he saw. Harry needed them, and that was what he would get: a family.</p>
