    <p>"Come on snatchers will be here in ten seconds!" Yelled a fellow Potter Watch host, "Right behind you!" George calls before looking back at Fred who nods and dashes to grab his brother's extended hand just as the sound of apparition reaches their ears.</p><p>"Catch them!" Comes a scream that sounds vaguely familiar.</p><p>Another voice shouts, "Don't let them escape!"</p><p>The rest of the sounds are more jumbled together as the next thing Fred knows is the uncomfortable tugging and squeezing sensation that comes with side-long apparition.</p><p>"That was a close one." Fred says to his twin as they arrive at one of their shared safe spots, "Maybe too close." George adds letting go of the other's hand to wipe the sweat off of his brow.</p><p>Fred plops down on the flower-filled ground, "How long should we wait here before we head back to the group meeting place?"</p><p>George shrugs, "I don't know, did we come up with a wait time?"</p><p>They both pause at that, "Someone did..." Fred mumbles in thought.</p><p>"Well, I don't remember it." The other twin admits.</p><p>"Me either..." The redhead grins sheepishly.</p><p>His brother drops down beside him and picks at a flower he just plucked as he did so and decides, "Give it a few minutes then go?"</p><p>"Sounds like a plan." The brown-eyed wizard nods.</p><p>The wind rustled the flowers petals it was like they were dancing; the smell was lovely. It was a clear night, not a cloud in the sky that was kind of rare to have such a clear view of the stars it wasn't too quiet the faint sounds of insects and the wind made it almost peaceful if you didn't know about the war going on all around them.</p><p>A few seconds of silence passed like this before Fred broke it, "They're getting faster at finding our broadcasting locations."</p><p>"Yeah..." George sighed as he let the now petal-less flower fall from his hand, "Guess we just have to make things trickier for them."</p><p>Fred smirks, "We can do that... well if Lee got away with the rest of the equipment that is." He motions to the equipment that he grabbed on the go it wasn't much the majority was usually near Lee near the end of the night.</p><p>The other twin gets up and walks forward looking out at the scenery, "I'm sure he did... hey Fred who chose this spot anyway?"</p><p>The other redhead glances around, "You. You were the one in charge of the apparition."</p><p>He looks back over his shoulder, "That's not what I meant."</p><p>Fred looks around the field of wildflowers, "Mom brought us here once when we were young I think."</p><p>"Yeah... I remember that now that you mention it." He looks down at the flowers and then out at the openness surrounding the field. "Still it's a bit too open for a safe spot don't you th- FRED!" He had turned just in time to see someone attack his twin from behind.</p><p>Fred doesn't move in time, he's grabbed tightly by the shoulders and starts screaming as a pain pierces his neck and the wizard forgetting about his wand in his panic tries to grip and yank the person behind him off but George who has his wand at the ready blasts him off. It doesn't send the person flying like it should, but it does shove him off a few feet, but he takes a nice size chunk of Fred's neck with him as he goes.</p><p>Blood sprays forth from Fred's neck and he grabs his badly bleeding neck and tries to move towards his brother, but George moves to his side faster with wand still at the ready, the person no feral looking man as the wizard can now see more clearly lunges but George is ready and blasts him again this time with a more lethal curse and it injures him, but he keeps coming. At this point, Fred is nearly unconscious form blood loss and George is firing curse after curse, but nothing is taking this thing down, in fact, the young man is barely drawing blood and thinks he sees the wounds knitting themselves back together somehow.</p><p>"What the hell is this thing!?" He grabs his barely conscious brother and tries to drag his dead weight while still shooting off whatever he can to keep the creature at bay but he's losing ground, just then he sends the strongest blasting curse he knows with as much power as he can in one shot when something also hits the creature from behind the result is bloody.</p><p>The explosion of blood, guts, and various other body parts and inners nearly makes the heavily breathing youth puke. Both he and Fred are now covered in blood and who knows what else, the smell is nearly overwhelming, but George does his best not to think about it as the man that helped save them walks up completely clean and speaks, "It looks like I was too late."</p><p>George's eyes widen in realization, he drops down beside his twin, "Fred!" He yells and grabs his brother's face, "Fred stay with me!" His breathing is ragged but it's there however his hand has slipped from his still bleeding neck not having the strength to hold on to it any longer. What George notices the most though is his eyes, they're almost completely shut, "Don't close your eyes, keep them open!"</p><p>Quickly he recalls the spell to stop bleeding wounds that he and his twin had learned together recently because of the war and his having lost an ear but when he tries it doesn't work.</p><p>"Your magic cannot save him." The mysterious man says with no emotion.</p><p>"Why not!" He all but yells as tears fall freely from his face, he tries again. Once more it has no effect, so he does the only other thing he can do and tries to stop the bleeding with his hands.</p><p>"Because magic will not heal a vampire bite." The words are said in the same unfeeling voice.</p><p>"Vampire bite..." His whisper is slightly horrified but also hopeful because a vampire bite doesn't mean permanent death, right?</p><p>"Yes, and by the looks of things he will die before he changes." His voice sounds closer but still emotionless.</p><p>"Changes?" He was right then, he won't die.</p><p>"Into a vampire." The man clarifies.</p><p>"So, he won't die, he'll become a vampire?" He had to say it, so he could really understand that somehow Fred would be okay, just a little different.</p><p>"The process is more complex than what your wizarding books would lead you to believe, one does not simply change from a bite though that is part of it." His voice was ever unchanging even as he told the unharmed young wizard this.</p><p>"What is the other part... no, I don't care; can you save him?" Finally taring his eyes away from his brother's limp form, he looks to the man no vampire before him. He is pale and dark and shows no ounce of anything on his face it's like he's made of stone.</p><p>"That depends on your definition of the word 'save' if I intervene now then he could possibly transform." His eyes are on the fallen wizard as he speaks but move to the other at his next words, "Please do whatever, just help him!" He begged, not caring that he was begging because he couldn't lose Fred no matter what that meant and even his twin would understand that had he not told him the same thing before after they spoke about how he felt when he thought he was dying from the dark spell that cost him an ear.</p><p>"Are you sure that is what he would want?" He looked serious despite still sounding blank.</p><p>"He's my brother... my twin I can't-" It was hard to describe to another what it was like right now, what he was feeling, how he knew he couldn't lose Fred, but he tried if only to convince this unfeeling creature to care enough to save him.</p><p>"Twins? Magical twins..." The mysterious man's eyes suddenly shine with the first emotion George has seen since he had appeared, and it looked like interest, "yes, I see now, with all the blood it was easy to miss."</p><p>"Why does it matter, will you help him or not!?" He asked in frustration but with a bit of hope and unease, all in all, it didn't make for the best feeling.</p><p>"I will... however, there is one condition." He holds up one finger as if to be dramatic, his voice and face suddenly slightly more animated than it had been before but George chooses not to dwell on that fact right now.</p><p>"Whatever it is fine just save him." He demands without thought but the vampire just closes his eyes and shakes his head, "You should never agree before you know what you are agreeing to."</p><p>"There's no time!" He explains desperately, not wanting to think about anything else even whatever this will cost him because whatever it is he will pay it so why does he have to know what it is right now?</p><p>Opening his eyes, he looks at the bleeding twin and points to his ear and states, "As long as I can hear his heart still beating there is time."</p><p>Knowing that he needed to just get it over with, so Fred could get help he agrees, "Fine tell me what you want."</p><p>"When your twin loses his human life, will you willingly give up your own?" He questions with a slight upward twitch of his lips an almost smile, this was nothing to smile about though as the wizard asks, "You mean die?"</p><p>"No." The dark creature shakes his head, but it doesn't make the young man asking feel any better as he continues, "You will leave behind your human life. The wizarding war that is happening, your friends, your family you will give it all up and live in a new world... one of darkness."</p><p>After a split-second, George answers, "Okay."</p><p>The vampire walks forward until he is right in front of him, "You need to be sure you cannot change your mind later no matter how much you might want too." There is a warning laced within his words.</p><p>"Fine! I agree now help him!" He exclaims.</p><p>"Very well." With that said he brings his wrist to his mouth and bites down drawing blood, before kneeling down beside them and bringing his wrist to Fred's mouth and pressing right up against it.</p><p>His eyes narrow as his eyes glance at the wound on the young wizard's neck but George doesn't notice until he speaks, "He is more resilient than I had first thought."</p><p>George looks at the vampire and then at the spot his eyes are looking at, "It's really healing..."</p><p>"Yes... yes, it is." His look turns thoughtful.</p><p>Fred's eyes flash black before returning to their lighter brown color as he becomes more aware his hands latch onto the arm in front of him and he starts to actively feed on the vampire's blood.</p><p>"You should back away now." He says calmly while petting the newly made fledgling's hair, it disturbs George, but he doesn't comment on it instead he just says, "What?"</p><p>"If you don't want your brother to kill you move out of his reach." The redhead looks at him with disbelief, "Fred wouldn't do that." He's extremely sure of this despite his lack of knowledge on all things vampire, after all, it's still his brother, still Fred.</p><p>Not taking his eyes or his petting hand away he simply states, "Right now, he would, you are his prey, not his family."</p><p>George doesn't want to believe that wants to argue about it in fact but he doesn't not right now anyway but he will later so slowly the wizard backs away, but this seems to draw his twin's attention and in less than a second his brother is snarling and trying to attack him, but the mysterious vampire is calmly holding him back with one arm around his waist and another petting his head like he's some kind of pet.</p><p>George can't believe what his eyes are seeing, it was like it wasn't his brother at all, he was scared of his twin for the first time in his life but more than that he was scared that when Fred was aware again that he'd hate him for letting him become this. He couldn't stand it if he hated him but even worse than all of that combined what if the books were right, what if he wasn't Fred anymore?</p><p>The vampire using his free hand that was still petting him to grip Fred's head and swiftly jerks it so hard George heard it snap, "You killed him!" he screamed as his brother's body fell limp in the vampire's grasp.</p><p>"No, it will take much more than that to as you say 'kill' him, I merely knocked him out." After saying that he carelessly tosses the body of his brother over his shoulder like a sake of potatoes, one that looked quite dead it was upsetting.</p><p>"By snapping his neck, isn't that a little much?" He argued.</p><p>"It takes a lot to render a vampire unconscious, would you rather he eat you?" Now that slight smile was back but this time George is pretty sure it's more of a smirk or a hybrid of a smile and a smirk if they had babies and just where the heck is his mind wandering to right now?</p><p>"...No, but still..." Not much of a comeback but his mind was a mess right now.</p><p>He starts to walk away from the splattered remains of what used to be a vampire in what was once a peaceful field of flowers now a bloodstained nightmare. George follows not really having much of a choice, after a few minutes he picks up their conversation like it had never been stalled.</p><p>"You do not like to see your brother harmed, worry not he was not aware enough to have felt it this time."</p><p>The way he ended that sentence irked him greatly, "This time, just how many times are you planning to 'knock him out'?"</p><p>"As many as it takes until he is no longer a threat to you." He states using one hand to swipe a stray strand of dark hair from his face.</p><p>"But... I thought I mean aren't you just going to turn me too?" He asks warily not really wanting it but figuring that was the case when he made him promise to leave behind his old 'human' life.</p><p>"Yes, but not yet there are protocols for turning someone." The vampire said it all so matter-of-factly that it took the wizard back.</p><p>"Protocols..." He parrots.</p><p>He nods and speaks eloquently, "If you are questioned say that the rogue vampire turned your brother, not I." In fact, now that the Weasley was paying attention his whole demeanor was like that of nobility or something like it.</p><p>"Why... because of these protocols?" He questions.</p><p>Slowing down and turning his head, he looks George directly in the eye he says seriously, "His very existence would be at stake if you said otherwise."</p><p>"What!? Why?" The twin asks in alarm.</p><p>The vampire looks vaguely put out at having to keep explaining things but the human thinks too bad because this is something that he needs to know, "One cannot just choose to turn a human on the spot, the consequences for such an action would be to have the newly changed destroyed as punishment."</p><p>The red head's eyes widen, "Why it's not his fault."</p><p>"Fault is not a factor here, I am merely stating the rules." He adjusts the unconscious twin and continues, "If the vampire who changed him is a rouge one and therefore in this case been punished then there is a chance that they will overlook this unauthorized turning."</p><p>"A chance? Unauthorized? You mean they could still kill him?" He was starting to feel less than calm about this whole thing, even after all this his brother could still die for no good reason!?</p><p>"They could but do not fret I will argue his case, it is very unlikely that they will choose extermination for him." It was stated calmly and confidently but George was not feeling his confidence, "But they still could..." He trails off not wanting to say the rest he had already almost lost him once already and his earlier fear was still present</p><p>"It does no good to worry about things that you cannot change."</p><p>"Yeah... that never stops mum..." He goes silent at that and tries to push back the thought of never seeing her or anyone else he cared for ever again... glancing at Fred's unmoving form he knows he'd do anything for him even this, but he really hopes that it's worth it in the end.</p><p>-</p><p>Author's Note: Most vampire characters will be OC since I don't have very much to work with in Harry Potter however having said that most won't have big parts but this one will so if anyone wants to recommend a good old name for this vampire OC of mine please do so, feel free to recommend more than one since there are plenty more vampires to show up in this story later. Don't worry lots of cannon HP characters will be in here too but it could take a few chapters before that happens. Thanks for reading, please review!</p>
