    <p>If you had asked Victor how he thought his day was going to go, he would never have thought it could have gone this badly. At first the day had been exiting. All the training he and his team had done was coming to fruition. A battle against Leon in front of the entire region, to decide who would be the champion.</p><p>The spectators in the stadium were more exited then he had ever seen them before. Even Leon seemed unnaturally focused. It was looking like a great day. And then Rose had to ruin everything. First was his announcement of The Darkest Day. Then the multiple pillars of light erupting from the earth. Getting dragged around the Slumbering Weald by Hop. Seeing Leon getting hurt by Eternatus, which then Dynamaxed into a monstrosity that split open the sky, before being saved by Zacian and Zamazenta.</p><p>Victor was starting to get a headache.</p><p>
  <em>I should have stayed in bed.<em></em></em>
</p><p>"Hey Vic, eyes up" Victor heard hop yell over the rushing wind swirling around them, causing Victor to look up at the battle unfolding before him. Hops Dubwool was running around, hitting the monstrous Pokémon when it had a chance. Zacian and Zamazenta were slamming into it with so much force, Victor could feel the shockwaves from the ground. Meanwhile, Victors Corviknight was darting around in the air, keeping the attention of Eternatus whilst the others tried their best to take it down.</p><p>It was at this point the enraged Pokémon let out an unearthly cry, different to anything it had done before.</p><p>
  <em>Its working, it's getting weaker.<em></em></em>
</p><p>Abruptly, its claw lashed out, somehow managing to smack Corviknight out off the air and into the ground in front of Victor with a massive crash.</p><p>"NO!" Victor yelled, rushing over to the downed bird. As he reached Corviknight, he was already lifting himself up, turning to look at his trainer.</p><p>
  <em>Ok, it's getting angry now, maybe we shou-<em></em></em>
</p><p>"VICTOR! LOOK OUT!"</p><p>Everything went a little brighter. Victors heart started pounding hard in his chest as, when he whipped around, the only think he could see was the giant claw, reaching out towards them at an incredible speed. Without thinking, he jumped to cover Corviknight, desperate to save his friend as the claw closed around them.</p><p>Suddenly the world started to spin. Victor clung to Corviknight as tightly as he could as he felt everything swirl around him. It felt like his body was contracting and expending at the same time, as waves of nausea swept over him. But as soon as these feelings had started, they abruptly stopped, instead being replaced by another, more terrifying feeling. They were falling.</p><p>"Corviknight? Buddy? I need you to start flying" Victor said to the bird he was still clinging onto. Within a second, the Pokémon had dipped below him and scooped him onto its back, spreading his wings in order to glide through the air. Only to continue dropping towards the earth at an alarming rate. Moments before they crashed, Corviknight quickly pulled up, violently scraping along the ground. The sudden impact threw Victor through the air and onto the ground, pain flaring along his arm. As he picked himself up, he looked at his arm, noticing a nasty road burn.</p><p>Dammit, this is going to be a pain.</p><p>"Excuse me? Are you all right?" A voice behind him enquired.</p><p>Spinning around, Victor noticed the person who had asked the question. A tall black man stood near him, a look of concern on his face. Behind him, a young white woman with vibrant purple hair looked at him with curiosity.</p><p>"I'm fine" Victor replied, before pausing and realising that he was no longer on the roof of the energy plant. They were standing at what appeared to be the coastline, a lighthouse standing a small distance away down a gravel road. Nearer to him was a dirty white building, set next to some rusting fuel tanks. As he turned to look behind them, he noticed a small building that appeared to be a souvenir shop and café.</p><p>
  <em>Maybe we got teleported. This isn't good. I need to get back to Hammerlocke.<em></em></em>
</p><p>"Really?" the woman said, pulling Victors attention back to her. "Because you just fell out of the sky on a giant bird".</p><p>"Trust me, he's taken worse hits then that" he said, eyes finally landing on where Corviknight had crash landed, before he rushed over to make sure he was ok.</p><p>"You ok?" he asked, eyes gazing over his friends' body. Corviknight looked up at him and let out a soft caw, rearranging himself to settle more comfortably on the ground. Whilst he seemed to be in mostly good shape, part of his right wing appeared to be at an unusual angle.</p><p>
  <em>Well that explains why we crashed. But where are we?<em></em></em>
</p><p>"Not to keep bothering you but what is that creature?" the man from before enquired, voice sounding closer than before. Looking back, Victor could see that the man, whilst appearing calm, had the look of a wound up Sandaconda, ready to strike at a moment's notice. The woman on the other hand…</p><p>"They're gorgeous!" she exclaimed, reaching out to stroke Corviknights feathers, the pokemon cooing at the attention.</p><p>"He is isn't he" Victor replied, pride in his voice. "Unfortunately, he's been hurt. So I'm going to have to put him away for a bit".</p><p>As he said this, he pulled a small ball from his belt, expanded it, and in a flash of red energy Corviknight had been returned to his ball. The woman, who had been petting the giant bird, fell forward, but was caught by her friend who had rushed over the moment she started stumbling.</p><p>After the ball had been returned to the belt, Victor pulled out his Rotom Phone and opened the map, desperate to find out how far away he was from Hammerlocke. Immediately, the phone gave him an error message.</p><p>'No Service Available'</p><p>
  <em>Huh?<em></em></em>
</p><p>This couldn't be right. The cellular system is run by Macro Cosmos Tech. There is no way it wouldn't work.</p><p>
  <em>Unless I'm in another region.<em></em></em>
</p><p>Victor looked at the couple who had talked to him. The man was approaching him slowly, but stopped when Victor asked "Excuse me? Where's the nearest Pokémon Centre?"</p><p>The man looked confused, before replying "What's a Pokémon Centre?"</p><p>Now it was Victor's turn to feel confused.</p><p>"Don't you know what a Pokémon is?" He asked, eyebrow raising in puzzlement.</p><p>This time the woman chimed in. "Is that what that bird was?"</p><p>
  <em>Are these people serious.<em></em></em>
</p><p>It was at this point Victor realised that he had no idea what to do. These people didn't know what Pokémon were, or where a Pokémon centre was. He wasn't able to contact anyone. Worst of all, he had no where he was. He jumped slightly when he felt something touch his shoulder. Looking up, he saw the man look at him with concern in his eyes.</p><p>"Why don't you tell us what happened from the beginning. Maybe we can help" the man said. Victor looked at the man, and then at the woman (who was also looking at him with a mixture of concern and confusion), before sighing.</p><p>"Ok, this is what happened…"</p>
