</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Today was just like any other day for Hermione Jean Granger. She had to pick up her children from their school. Rose was going to Hogwarts next year, Hugo had just started school this fall. She and Ron were still on friendly terms—as much as two people who had divorced last summer could be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Things would never be the same again. Not that she wanted them to be, that is. Hermione and Ron were far better friends than they had ever been as a married couple. Some people said opposites attract each other, but in her opinion, you had to have something in common beyond a past, for things to work long term. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was not willing to stay married simply because they had children together. It would do them, the children, no good long term. No matter what her former mother-in-law, Molly Weasley said. For once in a long time, Hermione’s life was calm, and she wanted to enjoy that. Ron was dating Pansy Parkinson, of all people, now. She, on the other hand, was happily single. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Teenage Hermione would have found adult Hermione’s idea of enjoying her evenings drinking wine and reading over her paperwork in silence when her kids were with her father, that is, utterly dull. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Auror Malfoy, Draco her former classmate, her former bully, now simply the thorn in her side, walked over to her desk and laid a file on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He said, ”Hello, unspeakable Granger, how is your day going?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said, ”Good, but have a feeling that's going to change with the file that you just sat on my desk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco said, ”Well the thing is Hermione the higher-ups think you're the only one for this case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione asked him harshly, ”Why me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sighed and said, ”Well most Aurors are bloody horrible at potions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said, ”You're not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco said, ”I was excluded due to other reasons.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione said, ”What other reasons?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He said, ”If you will let me get in a word edgewise I will tell you, Granger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She nodded and let him speak.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco sat on the corner of her desk, in the way that he always seemed to do. More than likely he only did it because he knew it drove her utterly nuts. He opened the file and handed her a page. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione read it silently to herself, the person that they were looking for was a potioneer and an expert at that. Very few people living or dead could make this potion. It wasn't exactly dark, but it wasn't exactly light either. Which ruled out some of those who could make it in theory, but were limited by blocks put on their magic by the ministry after the war.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So it wasn't Narcissa Malfoy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took a rather long time and careful care, so it wasn't someone as busy as Draco or herself, though she knew she wasn't making it, and the man in front of her was far too busy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a healing potion and they were nearly giving it away, only making a rather small profit. That ruled out tons of dark wizards. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It tested to be made by the same magic that made the far more shelf-stable Wolfsbane potion, her own department had been trying to figure out where it came from. And then it hit her like a ton of bricks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione thought to herself it could only be one person, but that man was dead. It would be the reason she was requested for the case if they thought it was him. Harry was far too close to Snape, having named one of his sons after the man. Hermione blamed most of that on the fact he had seen large amounts of the man’s memories, which in her opinion had turned Harry soft to the man. Soft to the man who had tried to make his life miserable for six years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione rarely ever voiced that opinion to her friend all it did was cause them to argue. In all honesty, she was far too old for such things now. She had spent far too many years arguing with her ex-husband, to argue with her closest friend, over things that matter very little when you looked back on it. Until now that is.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Neville was no longer an Auror and even if he was she would never force him, and she would do her best to make sure the department didn't force him to take the case. He unlike Harry, could not forget all that the man had done to them in school because of what he had done at what seemed at the time the end of his life. Ron was far too likely to blow his own top, though he now worked for George at the joke shop, anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The war wiped out a large amount of the Auror department, and it was still very much felt. People who were capable of being objective were now dead. Because they didn't side with Voldemort. Others could easily be ruled out because they tended to lean light or dark. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So, it left her and Draco. The Malfoy heir was ruled out because of his connection to Severus Snape. The man had saved his life. Done the task that should have killed him and his family for him. The man then protected him during their flight from Hogwarts, and after they went back to Malfoy Manor. He had been one at the mock trial for a dead man over a decade ago professing the dead headmaster’s innocence, right along with Harry of course.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When all the information was run through the wash, it left her. Hermione Jean Granger, mother of two, divorced, unspeakable, former war hero, who honest to Merlin hated fieldwork. It felt a little bit too much like that wretched camping trip Harry, her and her ex-husband went on during the war. And yet she knew she had to do this. She had never been to America before, but the little she had heard about New York City, sounded far bit more like London than a camping trip at least. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione would get to try some new food, and possibly see some interesting things, but most of all she would get to prove something she felt in the back of her mind for over a decade. She didn't know why or how, but she had always known in the back of her soul that Severus Snape had not died in the shrieking shack. No matter how much anyone tried to insist on the snake had eaten him. Bodies simply don't just disappear, large snake or not.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione tucked everything into the file and shut it. She said after she tucked her hair behind her ear, ”Yes I will take the case, I just need to get things squared away when it comes to my kids.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco said to her, ”Let me know if I can help with that, okay? Rose and Scorpius are about the same age, and I don't mind helping while you're out of town if you need it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wanted to take his offer, Hermione knew Draco was only doing so out of the very kindness of his heart. She knew that Astoria had done her best to try and remove the dark shadow of the war from the manor. Just as Draco had done when it came to the Malfoy family name, but the truth was, you could only put so much lipstick on a pig, and honestly it would always be a pig. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The manor, and what this relatively kind man’s aunt had done to her there would forever be a shadow over Hermione’s life. The place regularly filled her nightmares. She did not want her children there. If Ron could not do his job as a parent alone, for at most a few weeks then they had extended family they could stay with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She rarely talked about such things to anyone, but her mind healer and Harry. Ron decided to lock those memories up and pretend it never happened, that was part of the reason their marriage had ended so terribly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wanted to pretend that what had changed her from a young know it all school girl into a hardened unspeakable, never happened. Hermione was never such one for fairytales and jokes. Happily ever afters had never drawn her in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They even at a young age seemed so utterly fake to her. She was no James Potter and jokes seemed like childish escapism to her yet her Hogwarts days. The truth was Hermione was grounded to reality like stone, like a mountain even in their magical world, though sometimes she wished she wasn't.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron on the other hand, as soon as life got truly hard at Hogwarts? The idea of going back, and facing the reality of all that had changed? He was gone. Gone to the Auror department, which unlike Harry had never been his dream job in the first place. Then when that became too hard and stressful? He jumped ship barely putting in a two-week notice to go and work for George in his joke shop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He seemed to be happy there. Ron was a good salesman. A good employee. It made him happy to brighten people’s days with laughter and to be there to support George, who still seemed rather lost thirteen years later without Fred by his side. Those two fit the definition that twins were split down the middle as embryos right after conception. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was if someone had cut George’s left hand off, he was lost adrift in the sea without Fred, though Ron did seem to help some with that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione said, “Draco, thank you for the offer, but...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He cut her off and said, “Ronald Weasley needs to buck up and parent his own children?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said, “Exactly, and if not they have a rather long list of extended relatives who will help. If I need it though I will let you know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco smiled at her, but it did not reach his pale blue eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione said to him, ”Hey when I get back why don't you, Astoria and I set up a playdate or something? Rose wants to learn to fly her broom, and um how do I put this? Harry’s teaching method just isn't working for her, Ron’s always so busy, and I am a piss poor flier at best....” She realized that she was rambling on, but hoped that it would cheer the man up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He laughed and said, ”I would love to teach her, maybe a little competition will help Scor as well, he's not taking to it like I did for some weird reason. Maybe if she can fly better than him it will give him a reason to try harder.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco left, leaving the file on her desk and all Hermione could think to herself was men, stupid men. Life was far better without them most of the time. Little boys shouldn't need a girl being better than them to try harder, because there was nothing wrong with a girl being better than you. Whatever may be learning from Draco to fly her broom would stop Rose insisting that her mother needed to teach her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione had long ago accepted she was never going to win the Quidditch world cup,  and that she was a horrid flier anyway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>                 ************************ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione Apparated to WWW, George’s shop before picking up the kids from school. She needed to talk to Ron about the fact that she would be out of the country and he was going to have to manage for what could be up to a few weeks alone with the kids. Such a thing should be quite a simple task, but she also didn't want to start a fight. She happened to hate their fights, and she knew he felt the same. But, they always seemed to have them in the last few years, ever since he left the Auror department.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She opened the door slowly, hoping that there was no prank attached to it. Sometimes George did that to give his customers a teaser of what was to come. Most people found them funny but after a while coming to this shop to pick up or drop off the kids, they just ended up getting on her nerves. Fart noises were the last thing anyone wanted to hear after a long day of work, or worse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thankfully, this time there was nothing. She wiped her brown boots on the rug in front of the door and stepped inside quickly to shut out the cold. It was January, and there was snow on the ground. And then she heard it. The stupid bloody fart noise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The shop seemed rather empty so she shouted, ”Still not funny George!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His quiet laughter filled her ears as he walked down the stairs of the shop. She and Ron might no longer be married. But, between the kids, and how much she had grown to love the family during her childhood, as well as afterwards; they would always be family to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He said, ”If it surprised you, then it's still funny. That's kind of the point. So where are two of my favorite people?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione said, ”Still at school. Though, I need to talk to Ron actually. I am going to be out of town for a case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>George said, ”Hermione you hate fieldwork, how in Merlin’s name did they wrangle you into doing it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said, ”Well it’s in a place I have had an interest in going to, the case seems right up my alley and it drew me in as soon as I read the first few sentences of the file. Beyond that George, I need to try something new. I am stuck in this rut of sorts. This seems like it might be exactly what I need.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He said, ”Well whatever it is, Mione, I hope it works out and you're able to set work aside enough to enjoy wherever it is you will be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione said, ”Thanks George, but I think just having my questions on this case will bring me enough joy as it is. Do you happen to know where I would be able to find Ron? Like I said I need to talk this over with him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>George said, ”Right upstairs in the workroom last I saw him. And Hermione, do learn to have a little fun, all work, and no play make for a rather dull life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said, ”Thanks, but honestly George, I like to personally keep my work and play separate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He said, ”Well have fun anyway. And hope you solve the case.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>George gave her a sad smile as she walked up the stairs to find Ron. Hermione did not like to be judged about her life choices. She knew how to have fun, but as she had gotten older, her fun had become simple things. Watching her children play, the holidays, sinking into a hot bath at the end of the day and curling up with a good book. She had enough excitement to last a lifetime during the war, and if she really wanted it, like now, it could be found within her work. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In her free time, Hermione wanted to relax, forget the past and ignore the present. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>              ************************ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione found Ron quite easily, he was leaning over a work table with his back turned to her. He wore a faded flannel shirt she had bought him years ago in muggle London, though she doubted he remembered where it came from. She did though.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That shirt was from the time they that we're happily married. Rose was at most three, Hugo wasn’t even thought of yet. She hated to admit it because at one point in her life she judged people who did this. Hugo, their son, was their last desperate attempt to save their marriage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That didn't change the fact that both of them loved their son. He was a wonderful child, a perfect mix of both of them. His shocking red curly hair, his bright brown eyes, his sense of humor, though he had a sharp intelligence that came from her. Unlike Rose who seemed in a lot of ways as some said a mini Hermione, Hugo was clearly half of each of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their children, both their children, were the only good thing that came out of their marriage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione said, ”Hi Ron, I stopped by early before I went to pick up the kids because we need to talk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron set aside what he was working on and said, ”Well, what is it now?” He crossed his arms over his chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wondered for a second how they had come to this. How they had gone from the best of friends to lovers, to spouses, and then to whatever it was they were now. Time changes people, that's how they ended up like this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione sighed and said, ”Pansy and you are going to have to watch the kids full time, for at most a couple of weeks. I am headed out of town for work on a case, and I don't know how long it's exactly going to be. If it's too much I am sure Bill and Fleur would be willing to help, or Percy, or your parents, or even George and Angela.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He said to her, ”You know they are my kids as well right? Pansy is great with them. Kids are all she has ever wanted, right? It nearly killed her when she found out she couldn't have them. She doesn't want to take your place, but one day soon, Hermione, she's going to be their stepmother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said, ”I know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron said, ”I am just about done here, I can pick them up from school today myself. They tend to leave enough clothes at my house when they visit we should have enough, if not Pansy has been wanting to take them shopping anyway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Be safe, Hermione, wherever it is your going. I know enough about the ministry from my time working there you can't tell me about where you're going or why. But, please let Harry know at least, could you? Just so if something were to happen I can tell the kids what really happened to their mother, and not the stupid glossed over version.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione said, ”I will, and I will let you know when I am back in town.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He said, ”Take care of yourself, Hermione, the kids do need their mother and Harry needs his friend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said, ”Take care of yourself Ron” and then she left the shop. Hermione remembered long ago when she would do something like this when it was the rare occasion where the ministry could talk her into it. Back when they had a truly happy marriage, and he would say ”take care of yourself, Hermione, I love you and the kids and I need you.” Merlin better or worse sometimes like now she did truly miss those days.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>              ************************ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione pulled her head under the water of her clawfoot tub. She couldn't hear anything under the water, not even at times her own thoughts. Fridays were normally her days without the kids unless she wanted to do something with them over the weekend and then she would give up a few of her days during the week to Ron. Even though she was heading out to New York tomorrow, and desperately needed to pack. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She also wanted to do what she normally did, take a quiet hot bath, with a glass of wine and maybe a book. Without the chance of one of the kids barging in insisting the other was using the hall one and they had to pee. Hermione loved being a mom, but she also loved a break sometimes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pulled herself from under the water and brushed her rat’s nest of curls from her face. She rarely if ever used a warming spell on her bath’s, preferring to allow the cooling water to remind her when it might be time to get out. Maybe it was one of the few remaining parts of her muggle childhood, or maybe it was her fear that she loved the water rather too much to leave it if it never went cold. Though it could just be her mother's warnings when she was a child of people falling asleep in tubs and drowning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her mother was a baby boomer if there had ever been one. Anna Granger was born in 1955. She was stubborn as a mule and as determined as an ox. She protested, stood up for what she believed and had not a drop of fear about voicing her opinions. All which she passed onto her daughter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If her mother would have been a witch, Hermione had a feeling Slytherin's house may have had to make an exception to the no muggleborns rule. She had cunning that her daughter never possessed and her husband truly didn't understand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was the businesswoman of the family. Mark Granger was far better at the actual dental work, but Anna ran a tight ship. She was the one that made sure everything was in order.  Hermione missed her parents dearly. She knew they were out there, hopefully, living wonderful lives, doing wonderful things. But, the spell that should have been reversible turned out not to be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn't regret it if she hadn't done it her parents might not be alive now, but that didn't mean she didn't miss them. Hermione hadn't bothered to go looking for them, because it would be far more painful to know exactly how they were doing than it was to wonder. Because wishes and dreams would not play through your mind on repeat during your dreams like facts did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The truth was Hermione had far too many nightmares already she had no need or desire to add any more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She climbed out of the tub, the water had turned cold. She thought back to memories of her mother, happy ones, as she dressed in soft worn with age sleep clothes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione drained the tub, turned on her muggle radio and went to get packing, she had a city she had never been to visit tomorrow. She had a job to do and a ghost from the past. Unlike her parents, Severus Snape likely knew who and when he was. He just needed to be found whether he liked it or not she was going to find the dark wizard who haunted her dreams, likely in the city that never sleeps. </span>
