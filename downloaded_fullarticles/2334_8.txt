  <em>I wish someone had warned me when I was younger, now I stay up all night and weep, the ghosts of everything you have loved and lost come back to haunt you in your sleep – Haunted, Nikita Gill</em>

<p>Do you know what it is you do to me?</p>
<p>Not enough time has passed that I don’t still recall what you <em>did</em> to me; to me, to my friends and to the heart of a school. We don’t have enough time for that.</p>
<p>There’s just not enough <em>time.</em></p>
<p>Are you a product of yourself, or of your surroundings? That’s the real question, isn’t it? Not now, of course, but it begs thought—one day. Maybe <em>after. </em>I’ll revisit this when I have nothing <em>but</em> time to think of things that no longer matter in the immediate sense but will never cease to be important. I like to think you were a product of your surroundings, who became a product of himself. Yes. That’s it. It must be, because I would never have forgiven you otherwise.</p>
<p>But I did.</p>
<p>Forgive you I mean.</p>
<p>You know that don’t you? It was immediate—inexplicable and obvious all at once. With caution in your step and terror in the dart of your eyes, you came to us, and I felt my perception shift. Did you feel it to? That day so long ago on the doorstep of Headquarters? You must’ve, because from that first awkward, upturned evening, you spoke to me even as you skulked about as though afraid for your life (you should’ve been, you deserved to be).</p>
<p>You knew I would be kind, even though you were never kind to me.</p>
<p>I wish that made me the better person. I think maybe for a time, I was, but there comes a time as we age that selfishness starts to creep up in subtle ways; so subtle at times that it masquerades as selflessness and we don’t even know it’s there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Do you know what it is you do to me?</p>
<p>Ha. Of course you do. It’s probably a little something like what I’ve done to you, except maybe it’s more. There’s so many memories, you know? Sitting ‘round the fire and talking—shouting—about what <em>he</em> did (<em>it was never going to work—he didn’t </em>do<em> anything, that was always the problem)</em>, but in the end it’s you who’ll break my heart and I think I’ve always known it. You knew it too—before I did—and that’s why you backtracked, twisted, stuttered. Lied. Again—about more than me and less than you.</p>
<p>Does that make it nothing? Or everything?</p>
<p>It can’t be <em>everything</em>, because <em>you’re</em> everything (don’t you know that yet? Don’t you <em>see?</em>) and I think I’m careening toward an inky, silken nothingness without you.</p>
<p>So then I guess it must be nothing, but it isn’t.</p>
<p>It’s the little things—the way your laughter lifts a room and fashions glorious butterflies from the nerves squirming inside my stomach. The sound is really something—like a window into a life without fear. Yes, I do love that sound.</p>
<p>Then it changed again, and they stole you back. We were stupid, weren’t we? To think otherwise. They’d never let us keep you—not <em>whole</em> anyway—and we tried to dodge them, but they came. I’m sorry. <em>I’m so sorry. </em></p>
<p>It’s quiet now.</p>
<p>Too quiet.</p>
<p>It’s just me and the silence and the occasional flickering candle to keep me in the present. Such a shame. There’s a tantalizing pull to the past—to an us that existed too briefly <em>before</em>, but never will again—and I can’t yield to it. Life won’t let me. Unfortunately, it won’t let you, either.</p>
<p>You <em>knew,</em> and you tried to stop me, but that ship sailed away before I knew it’d docked. Don’t tell me you didn’t watch it go—you did. You breathed your laughter and pretty words into the air to fill its sails and <em>sent</em> it off, even though you tried not to. We don’t get to choose. How many times do I have to tell you, darling? <em>We don’t get to choose. </em></p>
<p>It wouldn’t change things if we <em>did</em>. I’d have still chosen you—risk and all. There’s always been that thing about you. I don’t know <em>what</em> exactly, but it’s that thing that keeps my logic, logic, <em>always logic</em>, at bay. It used to be a curse—how <em>dare</em> you? It’s not. It’s not a curse. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened and I’d trade the safety and the certainty of my logic for your heart every day of every week forever. I hate you for it, and for so many other things as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You know how much I love you, right? I hope so. If nothing else remains, I hope you’ll always know that one tiny, tethering <em>fact</em>. It’s time you knew, isn’t it? It’s only fair.</p>
<p>There are days when I want so much more from you. I want to see brand-new smile (you always did go on about how facing death and winning leaves you different)—so free and real and knowing.</p>
<p>It lights the whole damn sky on fire.</p>
<p>I’m content to watch it burn for decades if I can see it light your eyes just one more time—to see that flicker of absolute truth<em>, </em>and that cool, strong steel. Unbreakable.</p>
<p>
  <em>Broken. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s just a white-washed sea of grey now, isn’t it? They grey is beautiful, of course, but it’s not <em>alive</em>. Not like you. Not like the waves of life that positively <em>radiate</em> from you when you speak. Grey is just… grey now, and I suppose it’ll take some getting used to.</p>
<p>You can’t protect me anymore. It’s over. And I’m okay. What? Yes, I suppose I am lying, aren’t I? It’s just a tiny little white-lie though. You’d know a little something about telling those to protect the ones you love? I thought so. I understand now though—I really do. You were fucking right. It changed everything, and I didn’t even feel it happen. Now I’m upside down and inside out and I don’t know <em>what</em> is right or wrong, but you warned me. You <em>knew</em> and I didn’t listen.</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
<p>Fuck all of it.</p>
<p>The quiet, and the still. The fucking hum that <em>won’t shut up. </em></p>
<p>When I close my eyes I can feel you shake, you know? I can feel the earth shake. It’s all blood-red oozing on crisp white, and bones jutting from where they should be hidden. It’s broken skin and pale blue and that sickly-sweet smell that winds it tendrils around my neck as I dream.</p>
<p>I’d watch the sky burn for decades just to see you smile. Would I watch you burn for the same? I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I love you. I do.</p>
<p>When I open my eyes I’m cold, and the bed is cold. Cold and <em>empty. </em></p>
<p>
  <em>You’re gone.</em>
</p>
<p>It made you unbreakable. It gave you freedom in knowledge of absolute truths and a life without fear. Then it broke you.</p>
<p>What’s it going to do to me?</p>
