    <p>“There’s a fresh one,” Bader said. Bader was the biggest of the littles, almost fourteen, which made him think he was boss. Harry didn’t think so. Greyback was alpha, that he had to accept - Harry was too little to do anything about that (not yet) but he didn’t have to listen to Bader, who was maybe only five years bigger - maybe only four. Sure, Bader was taller, but he couldn’t beat Harry in a fair fight. Soon he wouldn’t beat him in an unfair one, if Harry kept practicing. And the other littles didn’t like Bader, didn’t do what he said without a punch or a threat - they’d do what Harry said, if he asked. He didn’t like to ask unless he needed to - he didn’t want Bader to know, and he definitely didn’t want Greyback. </p><p>Bader gave Harry a cuff around the ear that almost pushed him into the lake where they were washing. He made a big splash trying to stay upright and growled at Bader. “You listening? I said - "</p><p>“I knew already,” Harry growled. He hadn’t known for sure, but whenever Greyback made the littles come to the big bonfire, that meant either a fresh one or punishment or feasting, and it was the wrong time of the moon for a feast and Harry tried to forget about punishments as much as he could. Plus the grown ups had been acting weird - not that Harry saw them much, but they’d been muttering and going off to different parts of the woods in secret, to talk. They wouldn't have done that about feasting.</p><p>“He’s not fresh,” piped up Archie. He’d washed off and was now painting himself with mud like some of the grown ups did for bonfire, even though he was only one hand bigger than Harry. Harry didn’t see the point of washing off and then getting dirty again. “I heard Freki and Manny talking when they were fishing the other day - he was here once a long time ago. But then the wizards stole him back and raised him away. But now he’s come back. So he isn’t properly fresh.” Archie threw words like that a lot, properly or certainly or really. Greyback said it was lip and would cuff him one. Archie got words from books - he was eight when he was fresh and he’d been reading and everything, and he had a stack of waterlogged comics and magazines the cubs had found at campsites. Archie’d read them to the cubs some nights, sounding out the hard words. He’d offered to teach Harry, but Harry figured it was easier not to learn stuff that’d get him in trouble with Greyback. He was in trouble enough as it was. </p><p>Bader gave Archie a warning cuff. Archie wasn’t fast like Harry - he couldn’t catch himself and slipped all the way into the water. When he sputtered back to the surface, the muddy swirls on his chest were smudged and runny. </p><p>“Fresh enough. Greyback says he hasn’t been with us at moon time ever. So that’s fresh.”</p><p>“Freki and Manny said - ”</p><p>Bader thwapped Archie one across the face, then thwapped Harry one for good measure. Harry didn’t hit back - he dunked himself instead under the water, cool against the sting on his forehead. When he came back up, he smelled blood - Bader’d split his eyebrow. The others, bathing too far away to hear, looked at the blood trickling down Harry’s face, then looked away. </p><p>“You’re clean enough,” Bader proclaimed, shoving his way out into the shallows, Archie and the other littles scrambling on his heels. They’d all thrown their clothes up into the branches of the nearest tree, in case the girls came and stole them. They always did this, even though Harry’d never seen the girls near their side of the lake. The other boys scrambled out, shook themselves off as Bader climbed the tree and threw clothes down to everyone. He threw Harry’s trousers last, aimed for the lake, but Harry was too quick and caught them before they got wet. He pulled them on, searched the pockets for his necklace of bones. Littles mostly wore rabbit bones, even Bader. You didn’t get to wear better bones till you were big.</p><p>“There’s a fresh one,” Bader said again. Archie didn’t say anything, busied himself with his trousers. Bader licked his lips, bared his teeth - crooked and human. Greyback didn’t let you sharpen till you had your first kill. “Don’t want to be late.”</p><p>They trudged off, the split still trickling blood over Harry’s eye. Archie walked next to him, nudged him with one arm. Harry wiped the blood off his forehead with his fingers, rubbed his fingers clean on his chest - sure he’d washed, but blood was better than mud that way. They picked their way through the woods, down the path to the big camp.</p><p>“Your brother has come home,” Greyback said to them all. The littles were scattered in front of the fire, legs crossed. It got cold in summer, even near the fire, and Harry inched in a little more. Greyback said that every time, unless it was a girl. Then he’d say sister. But this wasn’t a girl, or even really a boy - it was a man. He was old and tired and weak looking. Harry looked with interest at the scars on the man’s face - they  weren’t big or anything, just little claws, but Harry liked them. Better than his, that weird claw on his forehead that came from Greyback holding his head while he bit Harry’s shoulder. Shoulder scars everyone had, Greyback liked them. But face scars were special. </p><p>“Your brother is back,” Greyback said. That was different. Maybe there was something to Freki and Manny’s talk. Plus, the man was too old to be really fresh. Greyback didn’t bite them that old. Didn’t like the taste.</p><p>“He’s been away from us too long,” Greyback said. “Stolen from his rightful home, stolen from his brothers and sisters. They taught him wizard ways, made him dress like a man, speak like a man. Made him transform alone, cut off from his own kind.” The pack around him hissed, and Harry hissed too. Transforming alone was one of the worst punishments, even worse than transforming with Greyback. Harry’d only had to do it twice and each time was terrible - he’d wake up scratched raw, his hands bitten bloody, his bones cracking and aching. Transforming alone was torture. Wizards were monsters. </p><p>“They taught him to hate himself. To hate his own kind. Taught him we wouldn’t have him, not with his fancy robes or his wizards wand. Well, they taught him wrong, didn’t they?” A howl of agreement, and Harry looked at the man with renewed interest. A wand? Harry knew Greyback had a wand somewhere - he’d threatened to use in on Harry when he was especially bad - but he’d never seen one up close. Had the man brought the wand with him? Maybe Harry could sneak into his hut and see it. It’d be worth the beating from Greyback to touch a real magic wand.</p><p>“We always accept back our brothers. Pack never turns on each other.” A howl, one Harry participated in to keep from rolling his eyes. Bader, next to him, howled full force.</p><p>“Our time is coming. And the pack knows. Even this brother, cut off from us, abandoned to wizards - he sensed it. And he returned!” A howl, greater and louder than before. Harry took to this one with gusto. Greyback talked about that a lot - their time coming. Harry couldn’t wait. His time coming, he was pretty sure, meant no more Bader, no more sleeping in the pup hut, no more hungry days midmoon, no more Greyback. His time would come, he was pretty sure, sooner or later. He hoped sooner. That made Greyback go into politics - Harry and the other cubs mostly tuned out then. Harry didn’t really understand politics, except that the wizards were bad and one day they’d have to be put in their place. Anything more complicated than that, he let slide. The grown ups followed it better, maybe, but maybe not. Most of them had been cubs here themselves once. Wizard politics couldn’t mean much to them either. </p><p>A little more howling, then the fire started to break down. The men and women were pairing off, which meant time for cubs to get scarce. The last unlucky cubs in the vicinity would end up paired with Greyback - something not even Bader pretended to enjoy, even though he said he didn’t like it because that was a cub’s place and he was almost a man. Harry was fixing to dart off into the brush when Greyback’s hand latched onto his shoulder, right over his bite scar. </p><p>“Not so fast there, runt.” Harry bristled at this - he wasn’t a runt, Archie was only a hand bigger and there were at least five boys who were much smaller - but tried not to show it. Bad enough to get caught by Greyback. Worse to get caught by Greyback and make him mad. Pairing up wasn’t technically a punishment, but it could turn into one real quick. “Where’s Bader?” </p><p>Harry felt a jolt of joy in his gut - Greyback didn’t want him after all! - that almost immediately turned into guilt. He didn’t like Bader, but he still didn’t wish Greyback on him. “Dunno, Greyback.”</p><p>Greyback growled a little and rocked Harry back and forth by his shoulder. </p><p>“He was next to me at the fire but he prob’ly went off,” Harry added quickly. Sure, maybe he didn’t like Bader, but he still wouldn’t turn him in, like a rat. Harry was a wolf. Wolves weren’t rats. </p><p>“You’ll do, then.” Harry’s stomach sunk, but Greyback just tweaked his shoulder again, so Harry was facing Greyback. He had the new man by his side, and Harry stared curiously. Up close, his face scars were even cooler, silvery pink and plentiful, and his wizard clothes were more complicated than any clothes Harry'd ever seen. Greyback said, “Meet your new brother Lupin.” </p><p>“Hello,” the man said politely. He held out a hand and Harry looked at it. What was he meant to do with that? It was all wrong for a cuff, too low and still. Harry just sniffed at it. </p><p>“Take him to the pup hut for tonight,” Greyback said. “You like kids, don’t you, Lupin?”</p><p>The man - the Lupin - his face twisted up a little, real quick, but Harry saw it. He tried to see everything. Greyback was too busy laughing at his own joke to notice. Greyback’s thumb ran over the scar tissue on Harry’s shoulder gently. </p><p>“Hrolf’s been here since he was a squirt,” Greyback said, almost fondly. “Almost as young as you. Mighta been younger. How old were you, Lupin, when I had you?”</p><p>“Four.”</p><p>“Hrolf was probably - eh - how old d’you think, Hrolf?”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Dunno, Greyback. Maybe four.”</p><p>“Get ‘em when they’re too young to know, that’s the ticket. You get Lupin a bunk and settle him in at the pup hut, all right? Figured he’d want a chance to see what he missed out on.”</p><p>Harry nodded. He didn’t see why anyone would feel they’d missed out on the pup hut - it was cramped and damp and cold at night - but nodding was the best answer with Greyback. Greyback gave a little squeeze to his shoulder again, then let him go. </p><p>“You see Bader, tell him I was looking for him, all right, runt?"</p><p>“All right, Greyback.” </p><p>“Good pup. All right, git. See you in the morning, Lupin.” Lupin nodded. Greyback clapped a hand on Lupin’s shoulder - gave it a squeeze like he’d given Harry’s. </p><p>“The morning. Yes. I - “ the Lupin swallowed. “Thank you.”</p><p>Greyback let out a howl of laughter. “And don’t it sound like poison!”</p><p>“No, I - I’m grateful. I am.”</p><p>“You will be. You’ll see, Lupin. This is how it should have been. All along.” Greyback gave him another squeeze. “Now, git. You need a torch?”</p><p>“Course we don't,” Harry said, almost insulted. He hadn’t needed a torch since he was a baby. Greyback gave a little howl, again, then turned and walked off to the fire. Harry thought he saw one of the girls darting away, but he turned away before he could tell who or if she’d been caught. </p><p>“This way,” he said, jerking his head. “S’not far.”</p><p>“Thank you,” the man said again, still that polite tone, like the radio man from Old Mix’s transistor. The trudged along for a minute with no sound by the rustle of leaves.</p><p>“So you’re the Lupin, then?”</p><p>“Just Lupin. Well, my first name is Remus. Remus Lupin.”</p><p>Harry snorted. “Greyback give that all to you?”</p><p>“No. My father.”</p><p>“He a wolf too?” The man got quiet. </p><p>“No. He wasn’t.”</p><p>“Just thought - I mean, s’good name. Greyback wants everyone to have wolf names. Or moon names. He keeps a whole book of ‘em he got from stories and stuff. But he won’t let anyone have Remus. He says that’s special.”</p><p>“Well, it’s always been my name. What about - um - Hrolf? Old family name, is it?”</p><p>Harry barked a laugh. “Greyback picked it. Flipped through his book. No one calls me that, though.”</p><p>“What do you like to be called?” Harry felt a moment of nervousness. </p><p>“I mean - just that like, I have a nickname. Like, short for Hrolf. I didn’t change my name. It’s not a human name.”</p><p>“It’d be all right if it was. You’re a human.”</p><p>Harry stopped, then turned around. The woods around them was dark and silent, but that didn’t mean anything. Anyone could be listening. </p><p>“Don’t say that here,” he said quietly. He looked at the Lupin in the almost not there light of the waxing crescent. “You’re not a pup but you’re sort of one so listen to me. Don’t say it. We’re not. All right? We’re not human. Don’t let him here you say that, you’ll get -“ Harry shrugged. “We’re not. That’s all.”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I won’t. Thank you.” They walked a little further. </p><p>“Harry,” Harry said suddenly. “But only in the pup hut, all right? Not - anywhere else. It’s just - short for Hrolf.” He hoped the Lupin wouldn’t notice Hrolf was shorter than Harry. </p><p>“Harry,” Lupin said. His voice was all tight. </p><p>"Just in the pup hut, yeah? Like a nickname."</p><p>“Of course. Well. A pleasure to meet you, Harry."</p><p>“Yeah. Er. Right.” They hit the curve in the path near the stone markers. “You was really a wizard?”</p><p>“I am. Was.”</p><p>“Had a wand and all?”</p><p>“I did. Yes.”</p><p>Harry tried to contain his disappointment. Did probably meant he didn’t anymore. </p><p>“Are you a wizard?”</p><p>Harry snorted. “Nah.”</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>Harry considered that for a moment. “Greyback’d know. If I was. He found me in a Muggle place, so. He said he can tell.”</p><p>“Are there any wizards? In the - pup hut?”</p><p>Harry gave him a warning look. It wasn't good to get too interested in the pup hut. “Dunno. Greyback’d know. You could ask him. He can taste it.”</p><p>Lupin didn’t say anything else. Harry gave him the bunk in the corner that had belonged to Charon before he joined the grown ups. It was under Harry’s bunk. Harry liked being up high so Bader couldn’t get him in his sleep, but Lupin probably wouldn’t have a problem with that. Bader wasn’t there when they got in, or Archie or the littlests. Probably taking the long way back in case Greyback couldn’t catch anyone and tried the pup hut. Harry sorted out a pillow and blanket - stealing the extras from Bader’s bed - and handed them to the Lupin. </p><p>“Thank you,” he said again. It was dark inside the hut, without even the moon to see by, but he thought he saw the glint of a small smile. “Harry.”</p><p>“Yeah. All right.” Harry climbed up to his own bunk, felt the bed settle as the Lupin laid out beneath him. Harry closed his eyes and listened, waited for the Lupin’s breathing to even out, waited for the others to come back. He heard noises from the bonfire - some howling, some keening. Part of himself wished it were closer to moon so he could be out there, running around free, not having to worry about Greyback or Bader or anybody, just him and the ground under his paws and the moon. But it was only waxing crescent. At least he'd made it back to the pup hut and the Lupin was there, on the bunk underneath him. Maybe that meant something good, or good enough. But even still, he stayed awake until he heard Lupin's breath go deep beneath him. Couldn't be too careful, not with grown ups. Not even fresh ones.</p>
