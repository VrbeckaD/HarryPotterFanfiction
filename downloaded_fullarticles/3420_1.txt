  <i>There is a sickness in Savernake Wood.  The sickness grows and festers.  It takes root and poisons the soil, then spreads its toxins through those roots into the stems and leaves of every plant, large and small, that grows under its dense canopy. Finally, the sickness takes the trees, moving up from the deep, ancient root systems through the trunks, spreading into the quietly beating hearts of the trees and then upwards, climbing and reaching, insinuating its poisonous tendrils around the healthy tissues until they sicken and begin to die away.  At last, the crowns of the trees are breached.  The leaves begin to shrivel and fall.  Branches splinter off and litter the ground below, but the wood is not fit for fires in the hearth of a winter’s night.  The smoke will kill a man in a day, a mouse in a matter of moments.</i>

</center><br/><br/><br/>Early August 2010<br/><br/><br/>The parchment lay on the desk, untouched, for several hours before its recipient chose to open it.  Breaking the seal, he unrolled it, his frown deepening as he scanned its message.<p><i>Mr. Malfoy,</i> it read. <i>It is most regrettable that your efforts, while commendable and most appreciated, have thus far failed to identify the cause or causes of the mysterious vegetation and wildlife die-offs in several of our most ancient forests, including Savernake Wood, which is relatively close to your family seat.  Unfortunately, time is increasingly of the essence, and we have now reached the deadline by which you had assured my office that you would have the problem solved. </i></p><p>
  <i>Mr. Malfoy, I cannot stress vigorously enough the urgency of this situation.  As you know, the trees in these forests are the repositories of the very oldest magic, and as such, they are particularly sensitive to the detrimental effects of outside forces.  Environmental pollutants are a possibility, but there is no firm evidence of a causal connection.  We must find a solution as soon as possible, before this becomes a calamity from which there is no longer any recovery.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Therefore, although I realise that you would prefer to continue working alone, I have directed Hermione Granger to join you in the research you are conducting.  Your greater expertise in ancient spell work will be complemented, I believe, by her very specific and extensive knowledge of herbs and potions and their uses in more arcane magicks.  It is my hope that between the two of you, you will be able to reach a consensus and find a way to reverse the situation.  I need not remind you that saving the ancient forests is ultimately essential to the health and wellbeing of the entire wizarding community in Britain. </i>
</p><p><i>Ms. Granger will be arriving in Wiltshire this evening.  Please make her welcome.  As before, I will expect to receive weekly progress reports.”</i> The letter closed with the ominous <i>“I am relying on the two of you.  Do not fail me.”</i></p><p>It was signed with the Minister of Magic’s customary flourish.  Muttering to himself, Draco Malfoy tossed the parchment to the desk and threw himself onto a nearby sofa facing the hearth, where a fire sparked and crackled cheerfully. Flickering shadows danced along the walls and ceiling of the dimly lit room, but he didn’t notice.  Instead, he stared morosely at nothing in particular, his thoughts trained entirely on a decidedly gloomy inner landscape.</p><p>He'd been quite content answering to no-one but himself, and of course, the Minister.  The last thing he wanted was a partner.  And bugger it all, why Granger, of all people?  Surely Shacklebolt could have found someone less contentious and bossy, someone who wouldn’t waltz into his house – <i>his</i> house! – as if she owned it, ready to tell him exactly what needed doing and precisely how to do it.  True, he hadn’t seen her in years, but in his experience, people didn’t change, not really.  She was bound to be the same as he remembered her, only older.  </p><p>He snorted softly.  Probably a frizzy-haired spinster by now, plain and colourless and all about work.  No doubt she’d be dragging along a giant book of potions dating back at least to the Middle Ages if not before, and another, an herbal compendium just as heavy and dusty and dry.   As dried up as its owner, no doubt.  </p><p>His wandering thoughts had already begun imagining the nondescript, brown frock she’d be wearing beneath a shapeless cardigan, when the clock on the mantel struck seven.  Startled, he sat up and shook his head.  </p><p>Just then, the heavy, brass knocker on the front door sounded.  Draco waited.  Tibby would answer, of course.  He strained to hear as the house-elf made his way to the entrance hall and pulled open the ponderous, old door with a creak.</p><p>There was some muffled conversation, and he could hear Granger’s voice, albeit faintly.  The footsteps came closer and then the library door opened.</p><p>Tibby cleared his throat with a deferential, little nod.  “Master Draco, you has a visitor.”</p><p>Draco had already risen from the sofa and now stood behind it, arms folded.  She was here and there was no pretending otherwise or wishing her away.</p><p>“Hello, Malfoy.”</p><p>The voice hadn’t changed terribly much.  He’d recognise it anywhere.  But Merlin’s beard, the rest of her …</p><p>Staring was rude and a sign of bad breeding, so Draco quickly dragged his gaze away from her face, which was probably a mistake.  It fell next on her chest, which was not at all the way he remembered it at school.  It didn’t help that she was not wearing the baggy, brown frock his imagination had conjured.  Instead, there was a crisp, white blouse, the top four buttons open at the throat, a lightweight, beige blazer, and faded, well-fitting jeans.  No sensible shoes either, but a pair of stylish, leather ballet flats. And every bit of exposed skin glowed with health and the summer sun.</p><p>“Cat got your tongue, then?” Hermione arched an eyebrow, faintly amused, and set down her suitcase and purse.  “Nice to see you too, after all these years.”</p><p>“Sorry.  I wasn’t expecting you just yet.”  The lie was meant to cover his surprise as he continued to steal surreptitious glances at his guest and soon-to-be research partner.  “What the hell happened to your hair?”</p><p>She laughed again and a slim hand darted up to pat at her hair, smooth and shining and pulled back into an attractive messy bun.  “Master of tact, aren’t you?  You haven’t changed, I see.”  </p><p>She paused, giving him a carefully appraising glance that took in as much as his had done.</p><p>“At least not your manners, anyway.  Look, Malfoy…” Her tone was strictly business now.  “Let’s just establish the fact, once and for all, that we are no longer kids at school. We’re thirty years old, for gods’ sake, not twelve.  And we’ve a job to do.  A very serious job.  I am well aware that you don’t want me here, and to be perfectly honest, I don’t particularly want to be here either.  But I <i>do</i> want to solve this mystery and get this contagion under control.  Better yet, eradicate it completely.  I think together, we can do that much anyway.  We don’t have to be friends.  In fact, it’s probably better if we’re not.”</p><p>Despite himself, Draco was intrigued.  Frankly, he was also a bit irritated that she’d voiced what he’d planned to say before he’d had a chance to get it out.  Typical Granger, nipping in ahead of him and stealing his thunder.</p><p>He cracked a stiff, little smile.  “Indeed.  My sentiments precisely.” </p><p>Glancing at the clock on the mantel, he beckoned to the little house-elf, who had waited at a respectful distance near the door.  “Tibby, please show Miss Granger to her room.”  Once again, he regarded Hermione with what he hoped was a dispassionate eye.  It wouldn’t do to show her that she’d affected him in any way.  “Dinner will be promptly at half seven.  You may do as you please until then.”</p><p>Turning away, he busied himself with a book he’d pulled from one of the vast, floor-to-ceiling shelves that filled the old library, hoping she’d take his rather obvious hint.  She did.  When he turned back again, she and her luggage were gone and the room had settled back again into deep, dusty silence.  Even the fire in the hearth had gone down to quietly glowing embers.  </p><p>Now what?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center><br/><br/><br/><br/>Dinner turned out, at least initially, to be something of an anti-climax.  Half past seven rolled around, and Draco found himself at the table alone, the other place setting remaining persistently unattended as the minutes ticked slowly by. Eventually, Tibby gave his master’s sleeve a tentative tug.<p>“Shall Tibby take away Miss Granger’s plate, Sir?”</p><p>Draco nodded and then shook his head, waving a hand impatiently.  “Yes.  Er… no.  Not yet.  Go and see if she still intends to come down.”  </p><p>Tibby reappeared several minutes later.  “Pardon me, Master Draco.  Miss Granger says she wishes to take her meal in her room.”</p><p>Oh, was that so?  Bad enough, being forced to endure her company as his houseguest, and she didn’t even have the decency to make an appearance at the dinner table?  What did she think this was, a hotel with room service?  Was everyone to be at her beck and call?</p><p>When Draco knocked on her door, it resounded sharply on the venerable old oak.</p><p>“I expect you to join me downstairs,” he said shortly, through the closed door. “We have things to discuss.”  Turning on his heel, he marched back down the stairs. </p><p>He’d been sitting for several minutes, toying with his soup, when she appeared in the doorway.  She’d had a bath, he realised, because she was now wearing a colourful dressing gown and slippers, and her hair was damp and curling.  The scent of vanilla filled his nostrils.</p><p>“My apologies, Malfoy,” she said matter-of-factly.  “I didn’t mean to offend.  I’d just got out of the bath, you see, and I thought… well, it was presumptuous of me.  This isn’t a hotel, after all. Please excuse my thoughtlessness.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, it’s only Tibby now, and he’s got rather a lot to attend to already,” Draco muttered gruffly. </p><p>“Where are your parents, then?”  She regarded him curiously as she spooned up a first taste of the soup. </p><p>The question came as a surprise, though it really should not have done, since he couldn’t have expected her to know anything about his parents’ movements.</p><p>“They’re travelling at present,” he told her.  “They’ll be gone for quite some time, probably until at least Samhain.”</p><p>“That’s nearly three months from now.  So … it’s just you and me, then, and Tibby?”</p><p>“Yes, and Dodie, who does the actual cooking.  Tibby’s utter crap in the kitchen.”  He laughed briefly despite himself and she joined him, until an awkward, self-conscious silence set in once again.</p><p>They ate in silence until the coffee and a plate of sweets were served.  At last, Draco set down his cup, lacing his fingers together on the table.</p><p>“Right.  Let me fill you in on the situation.”  He paused and glanced at Hermione, who sat forward now, alert and focused.</p><p>“Listening,” she murmured.  “Go on.”</p><p>“As no doubt you already know, the closest affected forest to us is Savernake Wood.  It’s about thirty-five miles from here.  So I’ve made it my test subject.  What is happening at Savernake is happening in forests all over the country.  The New Forest is very badly affected; it’s nearly as critical as Savernake.  In fact, I could easily name fifteen forests that are in a very bad way.”</p><p>“And…” Hermione leaned forward, resting her chin in her palm. “You’ve seen identical symptoms in all of them?  They mirror what you’ve observed at Savernake?”  </p><p>“Overwhelmingly, yes.”</p><p>“I assume you’ve taken samples from a variety of trees and other vegetation?”</p><p>He nodded.  “ I have.  The trees are primarily oaks and beeches of different varieties, many of them quite ancient.  “Over the centuries, they’ve been hosts to various lichens, fungi, and mosses, used…”</p><p>“… in some pretty powerful spells and potions. Yes.” Hermione nodded.  “I know.”</p><p> Ah. Draco glanced at her, with a grim smile. “Well, then. You’re probably familiar with many of them.  But now these lichens are diseased, and the fungi and mosses are declining almost as fast.  It won’t be long before the trees themselves begin to decay.  And it’s not just the trees.  Much of the ground cover is similarly affected.”</p><p>“Which means that all the wildlife on the forest floor are at risk as well.”  Hermione’s frown deepened, a faint worry line appearing between her eyes.  “So Shacklebolt thinks that I might be able to shed some light on all this?”</p><p>“Apparently.”  Eyes narrowed, Draco searched her face with a feeling akin to the beginnings of hope liberally dosed with doubt, scepticism, and a knot of lingering resentment.  “Well?  Can you?”</p><p>She sighed deeply, leaning back in her chair, eyes sombre.  “I’ll be honest.  I don’t know.  I need to think.  A lot.  And do some reading.  And obviously, we’ll need to talk a great deal more.  First, I’ll want to see the samples you’ve collected and find out more about the tests you’ve already performed on them.”  She stood then, and stretched.  Dinner and their subsequent conversation had stretched to nearly three hours and it was clear that Hermione was fading fast.</p><p>On the contrary, Draco found himself wide awake and curiously energised.  Nodding absently as she wished him a good night and disappeared up the wide staircase, he wandered out through the open French doors onto the small stone terrace and inhaled deeply. The night air was fresh and sweet. </p><p>Maybe Granger could make a difference after all.  He hadn’t wanted to believe that she could.  He hadn’t wanted to consider that on his own, he might not find the answers that the forests so desperately needed.  But she’d listened and had promised nothing more than an honest effort after learning all she possibly could.  Unexpectedly, the faint glimmerings of relief began to take root.  He would never tell Granger this, of course, but the weight that had felt like a boulder between his shoulders had just lifted ever so slightly, and for the first time in weeks, breathing suddenly felt a bit easier.  Perhaps sleep would come more easily as well, after months of fretful insomnia.  He decided to follow her example and try.</p>
