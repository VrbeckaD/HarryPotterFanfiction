    <p>Quirinus covered his face with his hands. The weight of his new companion caused him to get daily headaches. </p><p>He knew that the back of his head was the safest place for Voldemort to inhibit. It could be covered easily, and thankfully Quirinus slept on his side, so there was no chance of hurting the Dark Lord. </p><p>The only other downside to it, apart from the headaches, was the lack of privacy.<br/>
Quirinus could no longer get laid because of Voldemort. The last time he tried to sleep with a woman had gone horribly. </p><p>It was the first time having a lady over since having the Dark Lord on his head.<br/>
Quirinus had met the young woman at a bar and invited her back to his place. It was all going smoothly at first. They sat on the couch, drank a couple glasses of wine, had light conversation, and flirted while getting closer and closer to each other. </p><p>After a bit of flirtatious banter, Quirinus made his move. He placed his hand gently on his date’s chin and brought it up to his face, kissing her slowly yet passionately. </p><p>Quirinus moved his hands towards the woman’s waist, grabbing the end of her shirt and lifted it above her head to remove it.<br/>
He ran his fingers along her back, unhooking her bra and letting it slide off. </p><p>Things were heating up as his date grabbed Quirinus’ hands and placed them on her bare breasts, still not separating her lips from his. </p><p>Quirinus cupped and squeezed the firm breasts, running his fingers along the nipples and gently tugging at them.<br/>
The heated woman then started to run her soft hands along Quirinus’ clothed chest.<br/>
Frowning at the lack of bare skin, she grabbed the hem of his shirt and forcefully pulled it off, Quirinus’ turban falling along with the shirt. </p><p>They were both way into the moment to notice.<br/>
Quirinus unzipped his pants as his date ran her hands all over his back and chest.<br/>
The kissing never stopped, except during the second it took to remove their shirts. </p><p>Once Quirinus had lowered his pants, he went to reach for the woman's skirt, but a loud scream abruptly stopped him. </p><p>His date had been kissing him feverishly, caressing his face and moving her hands up to stroke his head when her fingers came upon an open, salivating mouth. </p><p>The surprising screech made Quirinus jump back as the face behind him started to cackle. </p><p>Upon hearing the invisible laugh, the woman immediately grabbed her clothes and disapparated, leaving Quirinus with half a hard-on and a very amused Voldemort. </p><p>He cursed at Voldemort for ruining his date, but then instantly apologized for insulting him. </p><p>……… </p><p>Now, it had been a month since his last encounter with a woman, and he was getting antsy.<br/>
Quirinus knew that any chance of having sex had dropped to zero. The Dark Lord made it very difficult with his heavy pants and uncontrollable slobbering. </p><p>Being able to feel Quirinus’ desperate desire, Voldemort promised that he would keep quiet the next time he brought a woman over.<br/>
Quirinus was still hesitant of trying again, but then the Dark Lord asked,<br/>
“Do you trust me, Quirinus?” </p><p>“Why, of course I do, my lord,” the wizard responded. </p><p>“Then go get yourself a lovely woman for the night. I promise to keep my mouth closed. Just make sure to secure the turban with an enchantment.” </p><p>Quirinus considered it for a second before apparating to the Hog’s Head, in search for a lady to bang.</p>
