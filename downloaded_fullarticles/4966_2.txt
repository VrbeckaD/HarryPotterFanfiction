    <p>During an even more irritating potions lesson where Weasley kept insulting his friends, Harry Potter discovered he had an older American cousin "<em>Sasha Banks</em>? Who's Sasha Banks?" Ron Weasley was gaping at him "none of your concern, Weasel" Draco sneered, shoving him away from the Golden Duo and their Slytherin friend "I've heard that name before, I just can't remember where" Harry said, looking at Professor Snape and his friends "I would suggest writing to Ms Banks. You are her cousin via Lily Potter's family" he said, then stalked away once again.</p><p>"Y'know what, I'm gonna listen to Snape this time" Hermione nodded as they packed up their cauldrons and left for dinner "<u><strong>Sasha Banks, I <em>know</em> that name somehow</strong></u>" he thought as he ate his meal "you alright, Harry? You're dead quiet" Neville said "I'm fine, Nev. Just thinking" he assured his friend "okay" Neville knew Harry just wanted to think what had happened over.</p><hr/><p>That evening, Draco was in Gryffindor Tower with Harry, Hermione and Neville as Harry finished writing his letter to send to Sasha in the morning "how's that look?" He asked Hermione again:</p><p>
  <em> <strong>Dear Ms Banks,</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>My name is Harry Potter. You may not know who I am, but as part of a assignment in class at my boarding school, I have discovered that you are my cousin through my late mother, Lily Marie Potter (née Evans).</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Through the local bank, I have discovered my parents will had dictated I was meant to be sent to you as my guardian. I have been living with my abusive relatives at 4 Privet Drive, Petunia and Vernon Dursley.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>I hope you are able to take me in, as I am only twelve and my family treat me as a slave. I am forced to do everything while my cousin, Dudley, is spoilt like a brat.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Yours faithfully,</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Harry James Potter</em> </b>
</p><hr/><p>"That's really good, Harry. I hope Ms Banks takes you in" Hermione said, Harry let out a yawn as Professor McGonagall came in "ah, Mr Malfoy. Professor Snape has requested you transfer to Gryffindor House now" Draco looked a little afraid "your parents know and are supportive as well" Draco then calmed down "thanks Professor" he said as the quartet went off to bed.</p>
