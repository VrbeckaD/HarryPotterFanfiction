    <p>Harry marveled at the view before him, his eyes wide and excited as the city lights began to flicker on. He leaned over the bridge and watched the changing colors for what seemed like ages. The sun was finally setting after a long day, and Harry looked to his friends with a wide smile placed upon his face.</p><p>“It’s so beautiful,” he said happily.</p><p>Ron nodded and both he and Hermoine leaned over the edge with him. “It really is, mate. I can’t believe you’ve never been here before, though.”</p><p>Harry snorted. “I’ve never been much of anywhere before.”</p><p>“You should go on holiday more often,” Hermoine suggested. “We know how hard you’ve been working lately, with all of the new cases you’ve been taking on. You really needed a break, Harry.”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Harry said in a low voice, sighing. “I was offered a promotion, you know.”</p><p>“Really?” Ron asked, suddenly excited. “When?”</p><p>“A few days ago,” Harry replied. “I haven’t decided if I wanted to take it or not. It has a lot of perks, and instead of being in the field I’ll be working with more paperwork than anything. Plus I’d get my own office.”</p><p>“Mate, you have to take it!” Ron said brightly.</p><p>“It sounds wonderful, Harry,” Hermione joined in with equal excitement. “Why haven’t you taken the offer yet?”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “I told Robards that I’d think about it over my holiday.”</p><p>“You’d be insane not to go for it,” Ron said, giving him a pointed look.</p><p>“Ron’s right,” Hermione nodded, then looked around at the evening sky. A sharp breeze blew past them and Harry burrowed deeper into his coat, Hermione’s long bushy hair blowing in his face in the process. “We should probably head back to the hotel now.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry mumbled. “You both can go. I’m going to stay for a little longer.”</p><p>“You sure?” Ron asked, standing straight before he linked his arm with Hermione’s. “Think you’ll remember the way back alone?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine, <em>mum</em>,” Harry chuckled. “You two go. I’ll only be a few minutes.”</p><p>Ron playfully elbowed him before turning and leaving the bridge with Hermione. Harry watched for a few moments as the two walked away, then looked back to the view. The sun began to set on the horizon of a lovely orange and pink sky, the grey clouds almost purple-looking overhead. The water beneath the bridge reflected the city lights, and Harry inwardly felt… small.</p><p>Small and unsure. For the past few years he had fully immersed himself in work, not caring if he died in the line of fire or not. It was easier not to think about life when you’re hunting criminals and getting shot at.</p><p>But here he was, standing on a bridge and watching the beautiful lights of Paris for the first time in his life. He had never stopped to think of anything other than work, and now that he was somewhere that truly made him happy, work was the last thing on his mind. He wasn’t the great Officer Potter at that moment. </p><p>He was just Harry.</p><p>“How many years have I wasted,” he asked himself, voice barely above a whisper, “when all this time I could have been here instead?”</p><p>Harry leaned on the edge of the bridge for a few more minutes, the cool autumn breeze rushing around him. The sky went from orange and pink to purple, and he could start to see the stars beginning to shine. He sighed to himself, wishing he had more daylight to spend out here, but he knew if he didn’t get back to the hotel by nightfall his friends would come looking for him. </p><p>With a grunt, he abruptly stood and turned, stepping away from the edge only to collide with another person. They yelped, promptly falling on their backside, and Harry couldn’t move fast enough to catch them.</p><p>“Shit!” Harry gasped, reaching out to help them up. “Are you-”</p><p>“Qu’est ton problème?“ the person asked, brushing the long white-blond hair out of their face to reveal a man around Harry’s age.</p><p>Harry froze, his arms outstretched in midair as if he were going to help him up. He could feel his heart thud in his chest at the sight of the man before him.</p><p>His hair was an almost white-blond color, long and flowing down his back while his eyes were a piercing grey that bored into Harry like a burning fire. He wore nice, casual clothes which were nearly overshadowed by his huge too-big grey jumper and white scarf. Despite his enraged expression, Harry thought he might just be the most beautiful person he had ever seen in his entire life.</p><p>The blond man sat there for a moment as if he were waiting on Harry to do or say something, then huffed and stood, shoving the frozen hands out of his way.</p><p>“T’es bizarre,” he said in a beautiful French accent that made Harry’s heart clench tight in his chest.</p><p>The man brushed past Harry and walked away, scowl still set in place. Harry could only watch him as he left the bridge, staring unabashedly while feeling the blood rush in his ears. He was too shocked to chase him or even call after him.</p><p>“Shit,” he said, a sudden realisation dawning upon him. “I’m gay.”</p>
