    <p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy strode confidently through Knockturn Alley, glaring at any miscreant who would dare sully his tailored black suit by getting too close.  A hag bowed low at his passing and the street urchins stopped their pocket picking as his pristine leather shoes clicked over the grimy, cobblestone street.  The weight of the Malfoy name and their well-known, but unconfirmed, ties to the Dark Lord caused all of the filth on the underbelly of the wizarding world to heed his passing and acknowledge the underprincling of the dark.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A dark shop at the far end of the alley was his destination.  The proprietor had failed to pay last month and Draco was tasked with collecting.  Normally, Father would have sent a goon to negotiate, but sometimes it was good for business to let the maggots know you were taking a personal interest in their… digression.  It rallied them into compliance.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he neared the store, a soft pop of apparition from down a nearby alleyway caught his attention.  While it wasn’t unusual for ne’er-do-wells to use the small spaces between buildings for a variety of illicit activities, what caught his attention was the soft whimper that accompanied the pop and, for some reason, made Draco’s purportedly nonexistent heart ache.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He eyed the damp, mossy walls of the alley, just barely wider than his shoulders, until deciding he could edge through without sullying his suit coat.  At the end of the alley, he came to thing he couldn’t quite explain. It was just under a meter in diameter, with an undulating green pattern on its surface, which appeared to be flesh or a membrane of some sort.  He heard the whimper again, slightly louder this time and definitely coming from the flesh ball. Of their own accord, Draco’s fingers stretched out to caress the thing. He withdrew his hand mere centimeters from the surface, his Slytherin self-preservation kicking in and reminding him that touching mysterious, seemingly compulsion-creating things in the dark alleys of Knockturn was generally une idée mal.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was swift wand work to erect the shields he’d seen his father use to handle volatile dark artefacts and apparate just inside the front gates of Malfoy Manor, his prior task left undone and forgotten in the space between shops.  Despite his burning curiosity, he walked at the same stately pace he’d used in Knockturn; it wouldn’t do for anyone to see him rushing, especially his mother. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Milly,” he demanded.  With a pop, his personal house elf appeared, scurrying to keep up with his longer-legged pace.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What can Milly do for Master Draco?” She asked, almost tripping over the hem of her pillowcase when she attempted to bow while jogging along.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is the large ritual room clear?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yessir, Master Draco, it be clear.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good, see that it remains that way.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>***</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two hours later, Lucius Malfoy knocked on the thick wooden door that lead to the ritual chamber. Upon hearing his son call, “Enter,” in a rather distracted fashion, he creaked open the door to find Draco staring intently at a fleshy oval. He twirled his wand while thinking, a sure sign that he was distracted enough to put away the cool Malfoy facade that had been bred into him. He circled around and Lucius noticed that he was muttering. With every mutter, the lump quivered and periodically Draco would stop and seemingly pull himself away forcefully.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> Lucius cleared his throat. Draco didn't start, belying that he was perfectly aware of Lucius’ presence. In fact, he held a single finger up to his father indicating he should wait. A whimper came from Draco's throat at which the lump started moving more frantically. Draco followed it with a cooing sound which immediately relaxed the lump. On taking a closer look, Lucius was able to see the shimmer of his dark artifact wards and was instantly proud of his son. While most of the world thought of Draco as a spoiled heir, just waiting to inherit his father's fortune, the truth was that his son was a sophisticated young man with a penetrating mind. He hid most of his deep thoughts behind the icy Malfoy mask and allowed them to think what they would. Such assumptions seemed to bother Draco’s persona, but not the true man beneath.  Like a true Slytherin, he seemed to consider it simply a fact to be used to one's advantage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Piercing grey eyes met his. “Father do you know what this is?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I have an inkling. Tell me. Can you hear it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, can't you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, I can't.  I could only hear the noises you were making.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How very strange. Can you feel it pulling?,” and then he mumbled to himself, “I can feel it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No. If what I suspect is true, then there's a reason that you can hear it and I cannot.  I’ll need to research it before I’m certain.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco hummed distractedly, staring back at the lump almost longingly.  “Let me know what you find.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco, I think you should come with me.”  Lucius was suddenly wary of leaving his son alone with the thing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What if it needs me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucius put a firm hand on Draco’s shoulder and started pushing him towards the door. “Then you’ll be better equipped to meet its needs if you’ve researched what we’re dealing with.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shook his head to clear it, then nodded to his father.  “Let’s begin, then.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>***</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>At two minutes to 6:00 PM, Narcissa Malfoy walked into the dining room and paused.  It was unusually empty. It was very unlike her husband and son to be late to a meal unless…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tippy!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A older house elf popped into existence.  “Yes, Mistress?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lucius wouldn’t happen to be in the library, would he?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, Mistress, both Masters Malfoy be in the library.  They’s be piling up many books. Tippy be afraid the books will fall.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you, Tippy.  Have dinner brought up to the library for them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tippy bowed low, then disappeared.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa settled herself into her place at the right hand of Lucius’ chair at the head of the table and took a sip of the red wine that filled her glass.  She smiled to herself. If Lucius hadn’t been under the thumb of Abraxas, bastard that he was, then he would’ve been a Ravenclaw. The man loved research. It was the only thing, other than herself, of course, that could distract him so fully that he forgot such trivial things like food and sleep.  It was also where he gained his extensive knowledge of the dark arts, that and family tradition, of course. That Draco had joined him in whatever research project they had delved into warmed her heart. Narcissa had noticed that Draco had become more withdrawn around his father, recently. Projects like this harkened back to Draco’s younger years when they would sit together for hours, researching and debating the size of a dragon’s magical core or which legends were embellishments and which were true.  While she was a bit curious what had snared their interest this time around, she knew they would resurface and extol on their project eventually. She ate her meal and enjoyed the silence.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>***</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span> Draco and Lucius were discussing their findings when Tippy appeared, agitated and hovering a full dinner behind him.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Masters be reading into dinner.  Mistress instructed Tippy to bring dinner here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, put it on the end of the table,” Lucius said, waving his wand to move the stack of books out of the way.  Lucius smiled inwardly at the thoughtfulness of his wife, always making sure he was well cared for even when he didn’t have the foresight to do it himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’ve narrowed it down, then?” Draco asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Lucius stated around the stacks of books that were hovering toward safer locations.  “I think what we’re dealing with is a Chiroptera, but there isn’t a lot of information about them, even here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The bat-creature from those old wives tales?  Weren’t those just made up to scare children?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A Chiroptera has a humanoid form and a batlike form and most of those old tales have a grain of truth in them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, if that’s a Chiroptera, then why does it look like a fleshy lump?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe it is a form of protection?  The surface looked a bit like the patagium described in the book, so maybe it wrapped itself in its wings.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That could be,” Draco suddenly went stiff.  “I need to go down to it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why?  What happened?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can feel it.  It’s in pain. It’s scared.  I’ve got to go to it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll come with you, but we must be careful.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, father.”  Draco jumped up, not even his Malfoy decorum being enough to stop him from running to the ritual room three floors below in the basement.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>***</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>On reaching the ritual room, Draco moved up to the edge of the ward surrounding the fleshy creature.  He cooed in response to the pained whimpering, an instinctive need to comfort the creature overwhelming him.  A flick of his wand and the ward was down. His fingers reached out to touch the mottled, swirling green skin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco, no!” Lucius called out, having just arrived at the door behind his wayward son.  It was too late, though.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco saw brilliant white as power rushed through his body.  The power felt urgent and exploratory, but not harmful so he relaxed into it and waited.  It may’ve been seconds or hours, but the power finally subsided, leaking away back through his fingers and into its master until only a hint of the connection remained.  He opened his eyes to his father’s worried face inches from his.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What were you thinking?  You know better than that.  What if it had…” Lucius stopped speaking as the fleshy lump began to uncurl from it’s winged prison.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When the wings were fully open, Draco could see what looked like a young man with a few distinct differences.  The absence of shoes revealed elongated toes with hooked, green-tinged talons on the ends. Fleshy green wings connected to the pale, white skin of his back, twitching as though uncomfortable after holding the former position for so long.  His jeans were baggy, torn, and bloodstained while only shreds of what must’ve been a shirt clung to to his torso. Scars and wounds littered that torso and Draco felt an explicable surge of anger relating to them. Pointed ears and dark green horns poked out of messy black hair, but it was the brilliant green eyes with no sclera and the lightning bolt scar that made him stop breathing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Potter?” He asked after a moment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy?  Oh, bollocks.”  Potter muttered before promptly fainting away.</span>
