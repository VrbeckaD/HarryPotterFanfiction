          <div class="userstuff"><p>From the moment I met you,</p>
<p>as little babes,</p>
<p>so small with wide eyes turned on the world</p>
<p>and wands not yet turned on each other;</p>
<p>but we knew,</p>
<p>both of us I’m sure,</p>
<p>that our worlds had collided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The differences tore at us,</p>
<p>sent us spiralling in opposite orbit.</p>
<p>We were two separate worlds,</p>
<p>drastically different,</p>
<p>dramatically,</p>
<p>yet we gravitated to each other,</p>
<p>over and over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tell me our fate</p>
<p>was not determined by other</p>
<p>four letter words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wide eyes captivated,</p>
<p>captured.</p>
<p>Were we really so naive to think</p>
<p>hate wasn’t spelt with an l?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There’s a care to the words,</p>
<p>a heart in the actions</p>
<p>that betray our intentions.</p>
<p>Fear creeps in,</p>
<p>the fear of true loss,</p>
<p>that isn’t strictly assigned to</p>
<p>the hate fuelled by enemies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When did it change?</p>
<p>This relationship of ours?</p>
<p>When did the h fall down, slump into an l?</p>
<p>When did the a curl into an o?</p>
<p>When did the  collapse completely?</p>
<p>When did we rebuild the v?</p>
<p>When did the meaning of us change its tune?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Did it ever?</p>
<p>Were we always singing the song -</p>
<p>the one we only now realise we are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the moment I met you</p>
<p>did you know</p>
<p>this was where we’d end up?<em></em></p>
