    <p>   “That cynical, hypocritical, backstabbing………ARGH!!!!!” Alex shouts as she slams the front door shut, after apparating away from her editor’s apartment. “Why, why do I bother!?!?!?” She grumbles to herself as she trudges up the stairs and to her room. Quickly she throws on her black swim trunks and racerback bikini top, with one of her twins old T’s that she had stolen over the top. Alex grabs her phone, wand, towel and thigh holster, as she heads out to the pool. Slipping outback Alex puts down her stuff and puts on some sports sunscreen and sits down to write for a little while. After waiting for 10 or so minutes, Alex tightens the holster onto her leg before sliding her wand into it. Standing up slowly, she closes her eyes and walks to the pool before flipping in. She swims a few laps before hearing a car pull up to the manor, accompanied by the familiar shouts of Cre and Newt. Alex spins underwater and pulls herself to the edge, before pushing herself up and out of the pool. With a flick of her wrist, she’s dried her body but leaves her hair damp, tossing it into a quick ponytail. She’s throwing the stolen shirt on as the boys' walkout.</p>
<p>   “Alex!” Credence shouts and throws himself into her for a hug. Newt stands back and chuckles at the scene. Grinning Alex rolls her eyes and pulls back to offer Newt a hug as well. After they all are done greeting one another the boys head inside but Alex stays outside to write a little more. But soon she joins them inside and sets about making herself a drink.</p>
<p> “Want some lemonade boys?” She asks as she flits through the kitchen, grabbing all she needs. She laughs when she looks up and they both are making faces at her.</p>
<p>   “NO…Thank you!” They say in almost perfect unison and Newt adds as an afterthought. “Your lemonade is rather acrid, Alex.” They all share a look when a familiar ‘<em>CRACK!!</em>’ comes from the entryway. The boys go racing to welcome their husband/ adoptive father home. Alex rolls her eyes fondly at them and follows to say hi to the patriarch of the family and her twin brother. Alex rounds the corner to see Percy with an arm full of Cre and Newt standing by with a soft smile on his face.</p>
<p>   “Hey Alex,” Percy says with a smile upon seeing his twin and arches an eyebrow up in question upon seeing the stolen article of clothing. “Really Alex, my shirt?” Alex simply grins and shrugs before stepping over and kisses his cheek. She turns tail and jogs back into the kitchen and rinses her glass out. Alex’s grin widens when she hears Percy whisper to Credence, “You see that? Don’t follow your aunt’s example and steal my clothes.” Alex walks back outside and tosses the shirt off before jogging and summer salting into the pool. Percy shakes his head as he watches Alex do laps and heads upstairs to get Cre down for his nap.</p>

</p>
<p>   Percy heads downstairs with a yawn, to check on Alex. After untangling himself from his soulmate/husband, who is like an octopus when he’s asleep. As he makes his way down the stairs someone rings the doorbell. Groaning he answers the door and is greeted by a………walking, talking bleached pineapple?  “Who are you and what do you want?” He asks tiredly, arching an eyebrow at the bleached pineapple.</p>
<p>   “I’m Gellert Grindelwald. I’m Alex’s editor. Is she home by any chance? She apparated away before we could finish working on a draft.” Gellert answers looking Percival in the eye. Percy nods in understanding and lets him into the mansion. He motions for Gellert to follow him and leads him through the house, out the back to the pool area. Where Gellert notices a tan form cutting through the water with the ease and precision of an athlete. Percy crouches down by the edge and taps on the water to get the person's attention. The slim figure flips smoothly under the surface, to swim to them. They quickly grab the ledge and push themselves up and out of the pool. Gellert is surprised to see Alex pop up out of the pool and stares in awe at her.</p>
<p>   “Hey, Percy. Gellert, what are you doing here?” Alex asks as she towels of quickly, with a little magical help and smirks to herself at his facial expression.</p>
<p>   “I…I……um you…a…,” he stutters, and Percy rolls his eyes as he walks away to go back to bed. Gellert closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before opening them again. “We never finished going over your draft earlier.” He says evenly and looks at her shoulder trying to focus. Alex hums softly and nods in acknowledgment.</p>
<p>   “Yeah, sorry about that.” She says slinging her towel onto her pool chair and tosses on her brother’s old T. “I’m just a little claustrophobic, and your apartment is a bit crowded. I guess because I’m used to the space I have here. Been raised here an all.” She states offhandedly, looking at the woods beyond the pool and dips her toes into the pool.</p>
<p>   “Alright, so Alex about your draft. Your characters have gotten flat, they aren’t dynamic any more……... Alex? Hey, you, all right?” Gellert asks watching her carefully and casts a wandless diagnostics charm to check her.</p>
<p>   “Hmm……Oh, yes I’m fine just thinking. Anyway, you aren’t wrong my characters are flat in that draft. I can go over it and fix it in a little while.” Alex says softly and begins spinning her wand over the top of her hand.</p>
<p>   “Alex, this isn’t about the book is it?” Gellert asks watching her carefully and taking note of the outcome of the charm.</p>
<p>   “Hugh…... Ya, know. You’re the first to ask me about that. Percy and Newt are always too busy with work and Cre to notice if I’m feeling a little out of it.” Alex laughs and wraps an arm around her stomach; transfiguring the old T into a shawl.</p>
<p>   “You know they don’t mean to,” Gellert says trying to comfort her while fighting the urge to hug her and hold her close. Alex nods and gives him a soft smile over her shoulder.</p>
<p>   “I know,” she murmurs softly. “I just worry about them sometimes and that woman is still out there. She hurt Credence so badly.” Alex looks back over the pool, tears glimmering in her eyes as she casts a feather-light charm on herself. She begins walking across the top of the water, as her feet skim the surface she shifts into a slow dance. She closes her eyes as she spins, and leaps losing herself in the rhythm of music only she can hear.</p>
<p>   Gellert watches her in awe as she sheds the melancholy like a jacket and the obvious euphoria of dancing takes over her features. A soft smile gracing her face, fluid movements without a single stutter. If he didn’t know better Gellert would have thought Alex to be a wonderous figment of his imagination or even a water fae. Alex lets her foot sink deeper into the water and begins to spin quickly, bringing her foot up as she spins. The water flies up, spinning around her like translucent ribbons. As she slows to a stop, so do the liquid ribbons and they fall around her still form in a spiral. Alex lets out a deep breath, opening her eyes to see Gellert watching her. His eyes held a softness she’d never seen before and they were directed right at her.</p>
<p>   “Hugh, um I….” Alex stutters and blushes lightly before closing her eyes and taking a deep breath. She opens them a moment later and gives him a wicked smirk. “Want to dance?” Alex asks mischievously, transfiguring her shawl into a sarong and ties it around her waist. Gellert shakes his head in exasperation as she begins to walk towards him.</p>
<p>   “Ah, no.” Gellert laughs with a soft smile of his own. “I don’t dance Alex.” She arches a fine eyebrow up at him and laughs. With a quick flick of her wrists, he’s in black swim trunks and a gray swim shirt. “Alex! That’s not funny!” Gellert shouts in surprise. Alex laughs, casting a quick feather-light charm on him before grabbing his hand.</p>
<p>   “Come on. Trust me?” She asks over her shoulder as she tugs him to the center of the pool. Alex turns to face him, putting one of his hands on her waist and hers on his shoulder.</p>
<p>   “Okay.” He whispers, causing Alex’s smile to widen a little and he follows her lead into a slow waltz. As they waltz around the pool neither notice the matching scars on their left legs or two, very smug, men watch from their second-floor window. Alex shifts her left foot and Gellert spins her out causing water to flare out dramatically between them. Alex laughs lightly as she spins back into his arms with her back to him. They sway for a while and then he spins her out again. Her skirt flares out looking like the spread wings of a bird in flight and water spins around her ankles. As Alex spins back to him, Gellert notices the edge of a scar on her leg. Alex slowly leads them to a stop and takes her hand off his shoulder. She steps back and mockingly bows to Gellert. Gellert laughs wholeheartedly and gives Alex a mocking bow right back.</p>
<p>  “Thought you didn’t dance Gel?” Alex teases him as she skates across the surface of the water, looking like a figure skater. Gellert rolls his eyes fondly, and a soft grin spreads across his face, as Alex literally skates circles around him.</p>
<p>   “I did say that didn’t I.” He laughs and begins to walk back to the side of the pool. Gellert gets lost in thought of how to go about asking her if she was his better half. He’s so caught up in his thoughts that he doesn’t notice how Alex has stopped dancing, stopped moving altogether. The silly lovestruck grin fades, as a feeling of rejection takes over and a stoic mask slips back into place. But Percy and Newt watch from their window as she droops like a dying flower, as Gellert gets farther and farther from her. Gellert transfigures his clothes back to normal and without turning around shouts a goodbye and apparates away.</p>
<p>  Percy watches as his younger twins’ world collapses around her and she soundlessly crumples onto the surface of the water; as if she was a marionette whose strings had been cut. The water ripples around her giving the illusion of her as a fallen angel. Percy apparates down to her and apparates back to her room in a snap, before her charm could wear off. Newt walks in as she opens her eyes, which have glassed over from an unseen fever that takes over. Both men know that she’ll be back to her normal physical health in a few hours. Otherwise, there’s nothing they can do. They leave her be in peace and walk out to see Cre standing in the hallway.</p>
<p>  “Is Auntie Alex okay?” He asks and tries to sneak in to see her. Percy sighs and shakes his head in the negative. Cre’s eyes widen and he nods. “what’s wrong with her?” He asks softly and hugs Newt when he notices his mums’ eyes misting over.</p>
<p>  “Your aunt just danced with her soulmate and neither of them knew. So, when he left to go home it was like he rejected her.” Percival explains and hugs them both close. Cre nods slowly and then gets a crazy idea and pulls back.</p>
<p>  “Can we change my birthday to a masquerade and invite her soulmate. You adults can show your marks.” Cre asks his parents, his plan already almost complete. Percy and Newt share a look before nodding, the three head to the library to finish planning the modified party.</p>
