  <em>“You want them back.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Who?” Harry whispered to the smoky black that surrounded him and filled his body with nothing but cold. He could not see any further than his own hands, and it was impossible to pinpoint where the voice was coming from. He should have been afraid. He would have been afraid—if he could be. It was an impossible emotion when the dark seemed to curl around him in such a comforting way. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“The people who died for this future,” it spoke again, far off and echoing. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The hissed voice was almost soothing, like it was trying to dislodge the guilt deep inside his chest with its words alone. The guilt that clutched to the ashen, expressionless faces piled up in the rubble of Hogwarts. Friends, family, teachers, children— “Yes,” Harry croaked. “More than anything.” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“At the cost of what you’ve already won, would you go back to save them?” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Yes,” he said with as much finality as he could muster.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> The cold beneath Harry’s skin warmed, and the smoky black around him was in the process of becoming impossibly dark. It closed in on him. He felt as if he was suffocating, but the warmth within him begged him to simply close his eyes and be taken. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Now was for rest. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Worry was for later.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s eyes flew open to the sound of the train horn being blasted, its wheels squeaking in protest as they began to move. He peeled himself from the window and rubbed his eyes with closed fists.</p>
<p>How strange, he thought, to fall asleep in such an unfamiliar and exciting place. Though whatever he had dreamt had left him with a lingering melancholy that dampered the thrill of the Hogwarts Express just a little. He couldn’t quite remember what the dream had been, but he wasn’t sure he exactly wanted to on the off chance that it ruined his first night at Hogwarts. Though he doubted even the most horrible of dreams could. A smile was already back on Harry’s face just at the thought of getting to see more magic.</p>
<p>Three even knocks on his compartment door broke Harry from his thoughts of Hagrid and owls and whatever other mysteries Hogwarts might hold. He leapt up and slid the door open.</p>
<p>He was met with a pair of eyes that were already locked onto his. It was a bit chilling, though he couldn’t quite place why. Maybe it was the absence of a smile, or the well groomed hair that didn’t seem to have a single strand out of place. Possibly it was the boy’s rigid, proper posture and the feeling of importance that seemed to come with his well put together person, that Harry knew he himself possessed none of.</p>
<p>“The other compartments are full, I was wondering if I might be able to sit here?” The boy asked politely, and the lack of menace or distaste in his voice broke some of Harry’s unease. Maybe he was simply an awkward child that didn’t know when to extend a friendly smile, and Merlin knew that Harry himself had much to learn when it came to being an awkward child.</p>
<p>“Of course!” Harry grinned, hoping his eagerness made up for his earlier moment of discomfort.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” the boy replied with a nod.</p>
<p>Harry watched as his rigidness didn’t seem to budge even when he sat on the bench across from him. He would’ve expected the boy to maybe try to make conversation or watch the scenery passing their window, but his eyes only seemed to study everything, from Harry’s too baggy clothes to the scar on his forehead. Though the scar seemed to be the last destination of his wandering eyes, which made Harry fidget.</p>
<p>“I’m Harry,” He said in an attempt to break the heavy focus that was on him. He was grateful when the boy’s eyes immediately snapped to meet his. “What’s your name?</p>
<p>“Tom,” A small polite smile finally met his face, and Harry gladly shook the hand he extended towards him.</p>
<p>Tom didn’t seem as bad as his overly focused eyes and rigid posture had made Harry believe. Maybe he already had his first friend at Hogwarts— strange and stiff, but still a possible friend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The dining hall was crowded and boisterous, and he’d been bumped into numerous times in the huddle of first years, but Tom couldn’t bring himself to mind. There was too much to take in as distraction. The long tables filled with endless uniformed students, candles floating around them, and the <em>sky</em>. Starlit and breathtaking, right above him.</p>
<p>This is where he belonged, he already knew. A place as magnificent and impressive as this was where Tom was supposed to be. The dull, hideous orphanage had been a fluke. Tom was always meant to be <em>here</em>, surrounded by magic and the means to harness it. He could feel the smallest of smiles tugging at his lips. This place was wonderful.</p>
<p>“Tom Riddle.”</p>
<p>He walked towards the stool with no hesitation. The sorting hat was ragged and worn, not nearly as impressive as the floating candles or the twinkling sky of a ceiling. As it was placed on his head, the hat made a small hum of contemplation.</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt, you belong in—“ The hat switched from his conversational tone to an announcer voice for the whole hall to hear, “Slytherin!”</p>
<p>Tom slid off the stool as soon as the hat was taken from him, and made his way to the only table that seemed to be cheering for him.</p>
<p>He didn’t need the other houses to cheer for Slytherin, as it was not yet <em>his</em>. Soon he would make it successful and respected, and that would win the rest of the houses’ favors. They all would cheer when they heard the name Slytherin, just as they seemed to do for the Gryffindors.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter.”</p>
<p>The boy from the train who had bought as much candy as his hands could grab was fidgeting on his way to the stool. He had split it with Tom, but whenever he had eaten a piece of it his stomach only soured more at the thought of a kid his age being able to afford such a gross amount of candy without batting an eye. He wanted to twist his fists into his robes out of frustration. How different his life could have been had he been raised in this place, had been as lucky as that Harry Potter was with his pockets full of money and his eyes bright and twinkling.</p>
<p>He would have what Harry had. He would get it through work, and through charm. Nobody was going to stop him from having all that should have been his from the beginning.</p>
<p>“Slytherin!”</p>
<p>Tom watched as Harry hopped off the stool and started towards the tables.</p>
<p>Maybe his pockets of money and his overly trusting eyes were meant to be Tom’s as well, just as Slytherin would be. Harry was meant to be a tool on his way to greatness.</p>
<p>“Tom!” Harry looked relieved to find a familiar face he could cling to while surrounded by a sea of unfamiliarity.</p>
<p>Charm and hard work would get him far, no doubt. But what one could accomplish on his own paled at what could be accomplished with a well off, blindly trusting ally.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Harry,” Tom said smoothly, making room on the bench beside him. Harry took the seat without hesitation, and Tom could say he almost felt a thrill at how easy things seemed to be going his way in this world of magic.</p>
<p>He rather liked it.</p>
