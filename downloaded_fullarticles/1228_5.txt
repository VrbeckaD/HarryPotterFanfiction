    <p>Bruce Wayne was on a business trip to Europe.</p>
<p>Usually, he could’ve avoided such trip by dumping it onto Lucius, but this time, Lucius and Alfred made an alliance… They forced Bruce to take a vacation outside of Gotham for just one day. As they claimed, “You haven’t been outside of Gotham in years!”</p>
<p>Bruce argued that he did travel quite a bit during the years. But it was rebutted by the fact that all of his travelling had something to do with some sort of world ending apocalypses.  </p>
<p>And of course, Jason had to come with him, otherwise… He probably would’ve needed to lock him in the Batcave to keep him from doing their nightly patrols without him, even then, he’d probably get out of that lock somehow.</p>
<p>Bruce smirked with pride.</p>
<p>Yes, his newest family member has a lot of potentials. A lot!</p>
<p>As the investment company’s voice became droning, he found the impatient Jason had been bored to death and when they made eye contact, he gave Bruce lots of eye rolling.</p>
<p>Bruce smiled, quickly wrapped everything up with his business partners, and walked to grab Jason before he actually fled the banquet.</p>
<p>“Jason, what do you say we get skip the after party and enjoy some quiet time in London.” Bruce offered with a loving rub on Jason’s head.</p>
<p>Jason couldn’t help but smile a little, excited and yet refused to admit it, “Fine, but I get to pick the route.”</p>
<p>Bruce held Jason’s hand, and left with grace.</p>
<p>They purposely ditched the suit and changed into casual attires, and Bruce redid his hair to shape his face a bit, so that no one can immediately recognize him. He made Jason wear cute sports shirt. Jason crossed his arms, but his shining eyes betrayed him.</p>
<p>They are just a pair of normal father and son in this big city.</p>
<p>Blending in.</p>
<p>Even pretended that they were from London, with the accent they learnt from Alfred.</p>
<p>Every time they talked to someone without breaking character, Jason had the smirk on his face, so did Bruce.</p>
<p>As they were strolling on the streets, enjoying the night at London, until someone bumped into them.</p>
<p>A kid to be precise.</p>
<p>The kid was hiding from someone.</p>
<p>From what Bruce instantly analyzed, this kid was abused. Watery green eyes made Bruce think of Jason when he first entered the manor. As much as Jason tried to conceal this side of him by acting rash and impulsive and just generally angry, Jason was just a hurt boy, like this little kid.</p>
<p>Then, they heard the horrible yelling noise coming from a fat guy with a thin tall women standing by his side, “You bloody twerp! Harry Potter! Don’t you dare just run off like that!”</p>
<p>The kid pleaded with his eyes, and as well, he grabbed Bruce’s regular looking but actually expensive pants with his dirty hands, “Please mister, don’t let them take me back…”</p>
<p>Honestly, Bruce didn’t know if he could be angrier.</p>
<p>Jason definitely saw the little kid as someone to protect. He acted as a big brother, fending those people off so they couldn’t get to the kid.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Sir. But I think there is simply a misunderstanding. You see, Harry here, that’s his name, is my nephew. I apologize for him ruining your clothes…” The man gave the kid a glare, then continued, “… as he always did.”</p>
<p>As he was moving his body around, trying to grab the kid. Jason shot up a nasty look, “don’t you touch him!”</p>
<p>For Jason, it was childhood all over again…</p>
<p>He is not going to let anyone hurt a child in front of his eyes! Especially not when Bruce was standing right beside him!</p>
<p>Bruce interrupted the man’s hideous motion of trying to catch the kid, “Sir, I’m sure it is a misunderstanding. Why don’t you let the kid say it himself?”</p>
<p>The man gave Bruce a glare, but knowing he can’t just get Harry back in his control, he used a threatening voice, “Harry, tell this nice gentleman that I’m your Uncle Vernon, that’s your Aunt Petunia, and you are coming home with us.”</p>
<p>The little kid known as Harry sheepishly shook his head, and literally attached himself with Bruce’s leg.</p>
<p>Sometimes, actions spoke for themselves.</p>
<p>Bruce knelt one of his knees so he was at eye level with the kid, “Harry, is it?”</p>
<p>The little kid nodded.</p>
<p>“Harry, do you want to go back to them?”</p>
<p>The little kid looked at Bruce, then looked at the Uncle.</p>
<p>The Uncle gave him a stern look, as if saying “if you don’t say yes, I’m going to teach you a lesson”.</p>
<p>It made Harry even more nervous. He was then picked up by Bruce.</p>
<p>Holding Harry against his chest, protecting Harry from the deadly stare of the uncle.</p>
<p>Harry’s voice broke again, “I don’t want to go back. Please don’t let them take me!”</p>
<p>Bruce patted Harry’s back lightly, and then stared at the uncle, almost in a bat-serious tone, “Then I’ll make SURE they don’t get you back.”</p>
<p>Harry looked at Bruce for a moment, sensed the seriousness of his words, he hugged Bruce as much as possible and started crying his hearts out. Harry felt for the first time in his life that he was in somewhere safe.</p>
<p>As Bruce was holding Harry in his right arm, he reached out to Jason with left hand.</p>
<p>They were about to walk away, when Vernon almost caught Harry’s arm, but with Bruce’s death stare, he backed away.</p>
<p>Then, Bruce, Jason and Harry literally waltzed away with Vernon in the background, “You can’t take Harry away! It’s illegal!”</p>
<p>Harry clung to Bruce even harder, and Bruce comforted him by gently adjusting Harry’s position a little bit more comfortable for the little guy, and then he turned around, “So sue me.”</p>
<p>With that, he went back to the hotel he was staying, and gave Harry a shirt that once belonged to Jason. Bruce helped the little guy shower, and found himself in a bit of an anger control problem.</p>
<p>Harry’s body nearly had no meat at all! There were bruises that shouldn’t be on such a young body. Even though, Bruce wasn’t sure if it’s a good thing or not that these bruises didn’t seemed to be coming from fists and such, it’s more like he bumped all over the places.</p>
<p>It was kind of horrific to think that such a child endured this…</p>
<p>Jason was certainly on his best behavior. Even going over the top by handing towels for Bruce.</p>
<p>After tucking both Harry and Jason in bed, Bruce was trying to make some calls.</p>
<p>However, before he could do anything, he saw the news that someone broke into Black Gate and got Deathstroke out… At the same time, Joker escaped Arkham again…</p>
<p>That means problem. Big problems.</p>
<p>He immediately abandoned the normal process of adopting a child, he pressured to have his jets ready in an hour, and then made some calls to “smuggle” the little Harry out of England and into Gotham. He asked Barbara to prepare a new identity for Harry as a temporary cover before he could sort out the legal things.</p>
<p>As he was moving the kids onto the jet, Jason rubbed his eyes and asked, “Something wrong, Bruce?”</p>
<p>Bruce patted Jason back to sleep, telling him, “It’s okay Jason. Go back to sleep, we just need to get back earlier than expected.”</p>
<p>“Will Harry come with us?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Jason, of course.”</p>
<p>Then Jason went back to sleep with the satisfaction that they won’t leave the abused child behind.</p>
<p>With that, they went back to Gotham that night.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Three days later:</p>
<p>"Harry Potter is missing?! How is that possible? Did... You-Know-Who's pawns got to him?" McGonagall was screaming at Dumbledore after he had told her that he couldn't find the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyes filled with regret, "I should have watched him closer. He has been taken by a man, I have no clue as to who he is... Though, I suspect that he is not with You-Know-Who. But... I have to admit, I have no idea whether that suspicion is true or not. When I casted a locator spell... Let’s just say that his location eludes me. So we do have to assume the worst."</p>
<p>McGonagall gasped, and then quickly repositioned herself, "But what are we going to tell the others? We can't keep this a secret when everyone expects him to show up in the school..."</p>
<p>Dumbledore sighed, he knew far too well about the danger of losing hope. Especially when the boy had already been praised by everyone for defeating their darkest nightmare. And yet there was still shadow looming around.</p>
<p>"Then, let's make everything worthwhile..." Dumbledore had decided, for the greater good of the wizarding world...</p>
<p>"We'll let everyone think he’s been taken. And rebuild their strength by giving them someone to hate."</p>
<p>McGonagall scowled the old man, and eventually, she sighed, too.</p>
<p>"I hope you know what you are doing, Albus."</p>
<p>The calming voice seemingly filled with wisdom, "I do. You know that HE is going to come back, we need to be ready, and we need to make everyone ready."</p>
