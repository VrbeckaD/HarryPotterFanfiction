  <span>Harry excitedly entered an unused classroom on the second floor. He closed the door and waited.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Ahh. Is it you, again?” asked the person who appeared behind him.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Who did you expect?” Harry laughed “Are you busy?”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“I’m always busy, young Potter.”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“I hope you can take a break for making a deal.”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Oh. I can always find some free time for a good deal,” he said.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Great, because no one would offer you a better one in this century.”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Harry sat up one of the desks and began to tell the details of his plan. After twenty minutes he looked up to the other with hopes.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>"Could you help me?”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Help? I thought we are making business here.”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“You know what I mean,” said Harry huffily</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Are you fully aware what you are asking and what you are offering in return?”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Of course I am, but no cheating!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Contrary to any horror stories, I do not cheat, young Potter.”</span>
