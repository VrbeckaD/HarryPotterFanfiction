  <span>June 28, 1980</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>The waves flowed smoothly against the cliff on the outer edge of Britain. The sun had barely peaked over the horizon line and all of the residents were nice and snug in their beds. Severus Snape stood near the edge watching the sea in his kayte form. The sea air always seemed to calm him down in moments of stress; this time was no different. He swished his tail back and forth as he listened to the waves and the bird calls. A sharp pain broke the feline out of his trance causing him to nudge the side of his belly where the kick originated. His kit was becoming more and more restless as he got closer to his approaching due date. Lately many of his days started and ended with him listening to the waves snuggled up to his mate. This morning though, his baby had been particularly restless, waking him late into the night. It seemed that the infant, no matter how much he tried, just would not sit still. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Severus nudged his belly again, this time licking the area gently while purring when he received a hard kick to his ribs. He decided to lie down with his head on his paws. This position seemed to calm his restless imp. By this time of day, his mate would just be waking up and most likely on his way here, that is if he decided not to hunt. How many times Severus watched his beloved sleep the night away with no cares in the world was beyond him. There were instances when he had to restrain himself from hexing the man in his irritable, sleep deprived state. No matter how much he loved his child, the little one simply refused to let him sleep. On that note since his mate had yet to arrive, Severus figured that he could get a couple more minutes of sleep. In doing so he curled protectively around his belly emitting a soft pur to lull the baby to sleep, at least for a little while. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>******</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A black shadow flew over the city lost in the clouds above. It was already almost noon and the kayte knew that his mate would not appreciate his tardiness. However, Tom knew that Severus could use the extra hours to sleep. The last couple of weeks had been filled with absolute chaos of the two awaited for their little prince or princess. Narcissa checked him over at the end of last month and said that the babe was due at any day now. Between preparing the manor for the arrival of a new baby and keeping his followers in check, Tom tried as hard as he could to make sure that his mate and kit were as comfortable as possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Speaking of, he looked down and spotted his mate as he got closer to the border. He looked to be sleeping, or at the most resting. He landed a few meters behind him, his wings and feet silent as he touched the ground. The only sound that could be heard was the crashing of waves and the seagulls above. As he got closer he could hear the subtle purring his mate was emitting. The kayte did not raise his head, but he knew that his presence was recognized when Severus began to swish his tail. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom sat down on his haunches waiting patiently for Severus to look up. It seemed that these last couple of days were beginning to take a toll on him and Tom wished that he could take away his discomfort. He leaned down and began grooming his mate. His sandpaper like tongue smoothed down the fur that was beginning to stand in different directions. His efforts were rewarded by loud purring before Severus stretched and rubbed his head on the underside of Tom’s chin. They both began to purr and when they moved back from each other Severus was looking up at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom moved back to allow Severus room to stand up, and when he did his mate moved behind him and nipped the end of his tail. He let out an undignified </span>
  <b>
    <em>yip </em>
  </b>
  <span>before scowling at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“What was that for?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>He asked. His whiskers twitched and Severus knew that if he were in his human form that his husband would be pouting at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You’re late”</span>
  </em>
  <span> was the only reply that Severus gave. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I am sorry, my beloved. I just wanted to let you get some rest because I know our little one has been giving you a hard time lately.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus shook his head but ultimately walked up to his sulking mate and once again rubbed his head under his chin. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“He has, but I believe it simply means he is as excited to meet us as we are him.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>He</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Tom inquired.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Yes</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Severus nodded. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>There is no doubt in my mind that this little imp is a boy</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom let out a laugh which to the human ear would just seem like growling.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“We shall see my love. The rest of the house has a bet going. Narcissa, Sirius, and Rabastan are absolutely certain that it will be a girl. While your brother, parents, and Bella swear it is a boy.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus snorted in amusement. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>And you, my love?</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>While I normally agree with you on most things, I happen to side with Narcissa this time. I feel that we shall have a little princess.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Tom stated, there was a slight pinch of arrogance and certainty in his voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“We shall see.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Indeed we shall. Now, let’s head back. You need to eat and you have another appointment with Narcissa today</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Tom stood and spread his wings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus stretched and yawned wide. He followed Tom’s lead and with one more look at the sea took flight, his mate following close behind. </span>
