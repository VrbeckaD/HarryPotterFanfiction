<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>“Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply. “We’ve forgotten
someone!”</p>
  <p>“Who?” asked Hermione.</p>
  <p>“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t
they?”</p>
  <p>“You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry.</p>
  <p>“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them to get
out. We don’t want any more Dobbies, do we? We can’t order
them to die for us —”</p>
  <p>There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of
Hermione’s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his
neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the
fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such
enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet.</p>
  <p>“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing
happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other
still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his
voice. “OI! There’s a war going on here!”</p>
  <p>Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each
other.</p>
  <p>“I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had
recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, “so
it’s now or never, isn’t it?”</p>
  <p>“Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” Harry shouted.
“D’you think you could just — just hold it in until we’ve got
the diadem?”</p>
  <p>“Yeah — right — sorry —” said Ron, and he and Hermione set
about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.</p>

</blockquote><p>Before they left, Hermione turned to Ron and in her low voice
told him:</p><p>“We will need to talk, when we have some free moment.”</p>
<hr class="docutils"/><p>She didn’t know, it won’t be before the next morning they will
have moment to stop. Meanwhile, however all remaining Horcruxes
were destroyed, Harry died and risen from death (or at least it
looked like it), and Tom Riddle was finally defeated and died.
And even then, it took them another day of mostly just sleeping
and eating, before they sit together.</p><p>Ron was the one who started.</p><p>“So, do you think we have something important to talk about?” He
smirked a bit hoping for the best.</p><p>“Yes, we do. I have to say how sorry I am.”</p><p>“Sorry? What you are sorry for?”</p><p>“For that kiss.”</p><p>“Sorry, for kissing me? You didn’t do anything bad.”</p><p>“No, I mean … let me explain. And, please, let me finish, it is
hard to get it out even in one piece”, she added hastily, when
she saw Ron coming effort to talk her out of it.</p><p>“I am sorry, because I sent you very confusing message and my
only excuse was that I was very much confused myself. I was
stressed out of my brain by all events of the past day. We were
very close to dying twice in one day, not mentioning my fear of
heights and jumping from flying dragon. Merlin, they will
probably kill us for blowing the International Statue of Secrecy
wide open! Any ideas how to <em>Obliviate</em> half of London or talk
them out of seeing a dragon flying over the centre of The City in
the middle of a day?</p><p>Focus, girl! This is not the point now! So, I was completely
stressed out and then you showed first concern for house-elves
after four years of my trying! I just lost it, and I was so happy
I just had to kiss you. Almost immediately I knew, it was wrong.
Our first kiss should happen only when I felt like kissing <em>you</em>
not because I just forgot myself. Then, however hormones kicked
in, and, please, forgive a girl enjoying being snogged by a boy
she dreamt for five years. It took me a bit of effort to collect
myself and then another moment before thinking how to stop
without hurting you.</p><p>Poor Harry, it had to be the most embarrassing moment of his
life!”</p><p>“But Hermione, I don’t understand! I really thought that we have
something going on, and that our only problem was my stupidity
and cowardice to admit it!”</p><p>“Yeah, I thought so too for a long time. Then well … It was
during the fights here in Hogwarts on Saturday. I was running
around like crazy and slowly I begun to feel I was just running
on autopilot. When I recognized the signs, I froze in horror,
because I know, that it is extremely dangerous for me not to
think, and I knew if I wouldn’t stop and quiet myself, I will
most likely die soon. Then without my effort I got separated both
from you and from all Death Eaters. I was alone in a classroom
and tried to collect myself. I hate to say it but obviously all
those Quidditch trainings did a lot of good for you two, and
I was really out of my breath. While waiting to settle down
a bit, I began to think to try to organize my mind again. And
surprisingly to me at the time, the first thing which came to my
mind was not where to run and how to fight, but what is the
situation between us two.”</p><p>“That’s sweet.”</p><p>“Well, yes, perhaps, but I came very quickly to the conclusion
that us two being together is just wrong. Or let me tell it more
completely. You are a great guy, probably the biggest friend
I have in the world, and I hope and pray that this discussion
won’t change anything on it. …”</p><p>“Wait! The biggest friend? What about Harry?”</p><p>“Yeah, I know. My relationship with Harry is too complicated, but
I can say certainly that for example you know about me more than
Harry. Don’t you think that during all those arguments we know
each other more than with Harry who doesn’t speak with us more
than two words, when he can get away with it?”</p><p>Ron looked completely shocked, and he couldn’t to say more.
Hermione continued:</p><p>“I stood there in that hallway and I have contemplated probably
first time in my life a possibility that I am going to die.
Before that, with troll in our first year, or with the snake in
the Godric’s Hollow, I have never had time to get shocked, but
this time I could stand up and think. And it was obvious to me
that there is a pretty high chance, I wouldn’t be living next
morning. That was a wee obvious, but then I was surprised by
completely unexpected thought: I was not persuaded that if I am
gonna die tonight, I would like you to be the only guy I have
ever kissed.</p><p>I suddenly saw that I have managed to develop quite a tunnel
vision in the last four years or so. I was so concentrated on
waiting for you to ask me out that I have not thought about much
anything else. There in the middle of night, considering the
possibility of my demise, I suddenly knew, that I really couldn’t
live with you for the rest of my life happily. I would spent it
wondering whether there wasn’t somebody else, and I felt that
agreeing to go out with you would lead to very quick
relationship, quick marriage, because we did most of our dating
already anyway, except for the physical part, and happily ever
after. It would be something very easy, something which suggests
itself, but I contemplated Dumbledore challenge to do what’s
right and not what’s easy, and I was not certain which it is.
I was truly afraid of spending the rest of my life wondering
whether there wasn’t somebody else and I just settled for
something obvious.”</p><p>“So, in the end you have decided for Harry, haven’t you? You
don’t have to go Hermionish complicated on me.”</p><p>“That’s exactly what I did not want to say! You see, that’s what
everybody expects from me, that I am going to end up with one of
you two, and my job is just to decide which one it is.</p><p>Honestly, I am telling you truth, whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, the reason why I am calling dating of us two off, is
because I don’t know, and I would like to cool down, take the
account of where I am right now in my life, and decide what to do
next. And, I really need to go to Australia to find my parents,
because after five years I would really like to talk with my mum.</p><p>Concerning Harry, that’s another can of worms, where I am lost.
Yes, although I said you are my best friend, Harry is closest to
me. He was always so moody and shut down, that surprisingly
I don’t really know that much who he really is. On the other
hand, there was nothing more natural for me, when we two were
drowning in the Won-Won disaster, then to turn to Harry and to
cry on his shoulder, and he obviously didn’t have problem to
admit to me that he is similarly unhappy with Ginny going out
with Dean. It was absolutely natural, like breathing out and
breathing in, but there was nothing romantic or sexual in it, it
was just like coming to my brother to complain how the world is
nasty to me.”</p><p>“That’s true, he also said that he considers you as his older
sister.”</p><p>“Now, the question is whether we were just fooling ourselves, and
there is something more underneath we are afraid to admit, or
whether it is just that … we have truly adopted one another, and
he is just my little brother now, and going out with him would
feel just wrong. And I really don’t know whether going to him
wouldn’t be just easy, like that following everybody’s
expectations that it will be just you or him. Not mentioning
I couldn’t do it to you, just after we would finish our three
years or so non-dating phase.”</p><p>“So, if not Harry, it is about my deserting you last year, isn’t
it?”</p><p>“Oh, that! I am so sorry, I was so stupid!”</p><p>“What? Hermione! I am the one who was stupid, who deserted you
both! I should be the one to apologize!”</p><p>“Yes, and you did it over and over and over again, and I was too
bloody proud and stupid to recognize what was going on?”</p><p>“What was going on? We were on the mission to save the wizarding
world, and I fell into stupid petty personal jealousy, and left
that mission for falsely accusing you of lying to me behind my
back. End of story! I am the one who is stupid!”</p><p>“No, you are not! Do you accuse Ginny of multiple counts of
attempted murder, … well, including of me?”</p><p>“Of course not! She was possessed by that stupid diary. How could
eleven year old resist the power of Riddle with all the dark
magic on top!”</p><p>“So? You had exactly the same thing on yourself for couple of
months. How is that any different? That you were seventeen? A big
difference! And I knew it, but because I made it all about me and
how you deserted me, or perhaps because I was under the influence
of that bloody locket as well, I let myself got hurt so much,
I was not willing to let of that hurt feeling and wallowing in my
hurt. Of course, I have forgiven you long time ago, and I really
need to ask you for forgiveness how stupid I was. However, you
should also forgive yourself. I don’t know why it affected you
more than me and Harry, or it just decided you were the easiest
to attack from us three, but we were its victims not
perpetrators, and we should all let it just go. I am really sorry
for not saying it earlier.”</p><p>Ron was silent for a longer moment, contemplating Hermione’s
words, but then he smiled again.</p><p>“Besides, if you would think anything about Harry, you would have
to fight about him with Ginny, won’t you?”</p><p>“I am not actually that certain about it. Haven’t you noticed how
Ginny looks at Harry lately? One of the things I was looking
forward under that tent was how they two will look at each other
when they will see each other again. And it was not what
I expected. Harry was certainly eager and excited, but Ginny when
she shown herself in that entry to the Room of Requirement looked
very uncertain, embarrassed, perhaps even ashamed. I would say
something more happened to her during the last year than terror
of Death Eaters in the castle, and some boy was involved in it.
I wouldn’t be surprised if somewhere in the castle Harry and
Ginny have right now a similar talk to ours, but with somebody
else mentioned.”</p><p>“Ginny? How could she? That’s horrible idea!”</p><p>“Well, that is the same what I am talking about here, isn’t it?
Harry let her go for whatever reasons, and if you let them go,
they may never return, right? Perhaps I will find out I have
missed the best opportunity of my life, but I really would like
to think where I am before doing anything else. And doing what’s
right implies living with a risk, doesn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes, but still … do you have any idea, whether there is another
bloke involved?”</p><p>“She didn’t say, we were staying on the superficial description
of what happened last year, and still we haven’t finished, and
I didn’t want to pry. However, it seemed to me her eyes are just
wee bit too shiny whenever she looks at Neville, don’t you
think?”</p><p>“Neville? Are we talking about Neville Longbottom? I don’t get
girls at all! Why would anyone give up on Harry because of the
bumbling Neville?”</p><p>“Well, I have to admit he looked pretty dashing when cutting that
snake’s head! And I am quite certain Ginny is not a crazy
brainiac as me, so she appreciated deeds like these much more.
And talking about bumbling, could you tell me who else stood up
to Voldemort with clear expectation of immediately dying? The
only other ones who stood to him were if I am not mistaken
Dumbledore and Harry, and they both had good reasons at that
moment to believe they will survive the encounter.</p><p>Besides I dimly remember, that shared near death experience is
rather good way how to start a life-long friendship. And if Ginny
and Neville were among two leaders of the Dumbledore’s Army last
year, I would say they had plenty of opportunity to live through
experiences like that.”</p><p>Ron was obviously preparing to say something, but then he
stopped, and he was just silent. When he didn’t say anything for
couple of minutes, Hermione thought she should say something, but
even she then decided she had said everything she wanted, and she
should leave Ron to his thinking. It took him another moment, but
then he looked at Hermione’s face first during the whole time
they were sitting there together.</p><p>“I should be probably horribly offended, angry, decimated, but
the honest truth is that I am actually relieved, and you are
completely right. We were both so focused on whether we should or
should not start dating each other, and curious how it would
work, that I have not been really thinking whether you are the
one for the last couple of years.</p><p>Don’t laugh at me, but when I was thinking about it right now,
I am suddenly not certain whether I don’t want to give another
try of dating Lavender, now when we know she survives that
Greyback’s attack. I mean, the thing in our sixth year, yes the
Won-Won disaster is a good label, was all wrong, and not much
more than a mutual tonsils examination, but I don’t think the
proper relationship between us two is completely hopeless now we
know more what we want and what we don’t.</p><p>I get what you are saying about being your best friend, and yes,
it makes a lot of sense, I feel the same. From all people in the
world, my family included, you know probably most about me by
far. However, when I stopped for a moment now, and actually
thought for a little longer horizon than our first kiss, and yes,
you are right, I haven’t focused much further down the line about
us two in the last three years, so when I thought what would our
life looked like, I have to say, it is not exactly what my dreams
are about.</p><p>I mean, you are great woman, and you will make some wizard, or
well even Muggle, if it comes to it, very happy, but I am not
sure it would be me. You will go after your great crusades,
liberate all house-elves, make Pureblood love Muggles or
something like that, and then you will finally be the Minister of
Magic. In between you will have to live your life very much in
public, participate in all stupid social functions, and I am not
sure I would like to be part of such life as glorious and awesome
as it is going to be.”</p><p>Hermione blushed intensely but she hasn’t said anything. Ron
continued.</p><p>“After all those years longing to be noticed and celebrated, and
when finally, I am at least one of three Saviours of the
Wizarding World, I don’t think I would like to live such life in
front of all people. Perhaps something what my parents have would
be better. To lead normal life, perhaps be regular Auror or
perhaps even just help George with his shop, to have normal wife,
doing normal things, caring for our kids … perhaps that’s much
better life for me.”</p><p>Hermione looked him with a bit of admiration, it seems he really
grown up a lot in the last year.</p><p>“If you don’t want glamour, then I am not certain Lavender is the
best woman for you, she is all about glamour, but I understand
what you mean. It makes a lot of sense. Also, I am not sure
whether she would be a good housewife like your mum is. When
I have visited her in the hospital wing in the morning, she was
all about plans for her life. Perhaps it was just trying to keep
her hopes up when she doesn’t really know whether she will be
walking again, but she looked like she cannot decide whether to
be an Auror or whether to open her own boutique with her line of
wizarding fashion.”</p><p>Ron’s face turned into one big question mark.</p><p>“Lavender as an Auror? That’s crazy, isn’t it?”</p><p>“I am not sure about it, but I don’t think it is such nonsense,
as I would think just couple of days ago. Ask Ginny who she was
like in the last year. We have apparently all missed that she is
a Gryffindor for a reason. She would be certainly very different
Auror than you or Harry will be, killing darkness with the pink
lace …,” she snorted, “… but she apparently was able to transform
all her gossiping network all over the school into the efficient
espionage operation which made her run in circles around Carrows,
so the Dumbledore’s Army knew everything in advance, and the
Death Eaters never found where the leaks were. I would never
expect Ginny to be so in awe over Lavender, or frankly that
anybody would be in awe over any of her achievements, but
apparently she was brilliant.”</p><p>“Wow! Auror Lavender Brown! Who would ever believe that?
Interesting.”</p><p>He didn’t want to say more, but his mind was evidently very busy
and it was somewhere else than in the presence of Hermione. He was so
lost in his thoughts that he slowly left without saying goodbye.</p></div>
