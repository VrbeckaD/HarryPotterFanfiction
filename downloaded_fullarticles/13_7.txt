    <p align="left">The sneering pain in the blond wizard’s left arm had dulled over the past hour. Sitting on his bed, he watched the cursive letters appear in his room shortly after he sent an owl to his best friend. Lana Black was the person behind being able to figure out a way to communicate when they weren’t at Hogwarts. The sixteen-year-old rolled his eyes at Lana’s magic. </p><p align="center">
  <em>Don’t ignore me, Minho. You promised.</em>
</p><p>Minho Paek’s attention was drawn to his bruised left arm – the Dark Mark looked rather interesting against his pale skin. The Slytherin gently ran his finger across the new part of himself, hissing at the burning sensation. “Fuck.” He growled as he snatched his wand in front of him. Flicking his wrist, Minho silenced the room. “I did no such promise, Lana.” He stated. </p><p align="center">
  <em>I clearly remember us talking about getting the marks together. Once you turned of age.</em>
</p><p>Minho rolled his eyes, “You know my bastard of a father, once the eldest of the family – me – turned sixteen, I get the mark. Whether I want it or not.” The Paek family was one of the Dark Lord’s favorites – or so it seemed to the upcoming sixth-year. Minho was his father’s successor if anything happened to him after this year. The Dark Lord was rising back into power, recruiting Death Eaters for his new reign. </p><p align="center">
  <em>Becoming a Death Eater is an honor, Minho. You know this.</em>
</p><p>The Slytherin shook his head at his best friend’s words. There was another whole reason why Minho was forced to bear the mark on his skin so early. The Dark Lord found out his plan with Lana and had a few choice words about the brunette’s attachment to the Death Eaters and himself. Lana Black was the only daughter of Regulus Black, and that alone made the Dark Lord mad. The rumors about Black’s betrayal were enough to make sure that his daughter never bared the mark herself. But Minho couldn’t tell her that.</p><p>“You have this fascination with the Dark Lord and Death Eaters – for an orphan, you seem rather informative,” Minho smirked. Lana never met her parents; her mother dropped her off at an orphanage at a day old, not even bothering to look for Regulus’ older brother. She was fostered by a Squib family when she started doing magic out of her control – not that they much helped to begin with. “How are the Squibs?”</p><p align="center">
  <em>Why bother asking?</em>
</p><p>“To distract you from this pathetic attempt to become a Death Eater – you and I both know that you’ll never become one.” Minho knew his best friend’s hesitation about the mark as well. The brunette was all talk but zero bite – she had these fantasies about what happened after the Dark Mark was onto the skin. All Lana <em>really </em>wanted to do was study the magic that went into <em>creating </em>the mark. That was probably why she had become Head Girl and got straight O’s on her OWLs two years ago. “You just want to study the magic and study the person so evil until you find out what makes him tick. I <em>really </em>hope that doesn’t involve attempting to shag him.” Minho commented. </p><p align="center">
  <em>Of course not! Merlin, you make me sound like a horrible witch.</em>
</p><p>“You are a horrible witch,” </p><p>Minho knew he pissed off the seventh-year Slytherin. </p><p align="center">
  <em>Hogwarts is going to be different this year.</em>
</p><p>Lana <em>clearly </em>ignored Minho’s statement, whatever. The blond wizard raised an eyebrow at the brunette’s comment. Of course, Hogwarts was going to be bloody different – a student was killed in June during the Triwizard Tournament. How the hell did Lana expect Hogwarts to go back to the way things were <em>before </em>that day? The idiotic headmaster could only do so much if the wizarding world didn’t believe that the Dark Lord was back.</p><p>Potter was starting to have a new title of being delusional that the Dark Lord was even alive. The Daily Prophet was writing stories <em>against </em>Potter and Dumbledore, trying to make sure that the wizarding world doesn’t believe them. The stories were untrue, obviously, but the Ministry didn’t want the truth to be exposed. How on earth would the wizarding world react if they found out that everything that Potter said was actually true? Not many people believed the fourteen-year-old then, and they definitely weren’t going to believe the fifteen-year-old <em>now </em>– not unless the Ministry saw for themselves. </p><p>“Are you expecting sunshine and rainbows coming out of Dumbledore’s arse or something?” Minho flopped back onto the comfortable on his four-poster bed. He turned his head to look at the black magical ink on his forearm. “You think it’s gonna be easy going back to Hogwarts this year? You are mental if you believe easy was even in Hogwarts’ vocabulary.” He added.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Well, aren’t you being Mr. Cynical this evening?</em>
</p><p>“You try having a burning mark on your forearm.”</p><p>Lana fell silent for a brief moment. </p><p align="center">
  <em>So it burns?</em>
</p><p>Minho groaned, placing his right arm over his eyes. <em>Of course</em>, his best friend would only care about the burning sensation on his arm rather than <em>his </em>wellbeing. The blond wizard heard the clicking of his mother’s heels echo toward his bedroom. Snatching his wand, he ended the conversation between him and Lana Black. Just as the words dissolved into a speck of fine dust, there was a knock on his door. “What, mother?” Minho sat up in the bed as the door opened. </p><p>His mother, Jia Paek stood in the doorway, looking over her son’s pale complexion. “Severus would like a word,” Minho rolled his eyes upon hearing his Head of House’s name. Severus Snape was the only one that could possibly fool the Dark Lord by working for the light side as well.</p><p>The blond pushed himself from the bed, hiding his flinch. Jia moved from the doorway, continued talking. “I do hope you watch your twin siblings this year, Minho.” Minho tried to make sure the mark didn’t scrap against the fabric of his dress pants. “You are in charge of them.” </p><p>“I hope you realize, mother, that I won’t be in the same classes as my siblings,” he stated under his breath. </p><p>Jia paused outside father’s study, “Just do as Severus instructs you – and no backtalk. You aren’t at Hogwarts, dear,” Jia ran her slender fingers through his bleached locks. “I do wish you kept your natural color.” Minho slapped his mother’s hand from his hair. </p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Jia took her son’s wrist, glancing to the mark that stained his skin. “Fair warning about this upcoming school year, dear, the Ministry <em>will be </em>getting involved.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>---</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Seventeen-year-old Lana Black’s mouth fell open as the connection between her and Minho died. “Oh, that bloody bastard,” she growled under her breath. The brunette looked over at the short wand on her nightstand – Lana could try again but the connection ended abruptly. </p><p>“Lana?” The upcoming seventh-year turned her attention to her foster sister peeking her head into her bedroom. Since turning of-age, her foster parents decided to give Lana her own space. While Lana was allowed to leave if she wanted, she decided to stick it out for another year or two. The witch smiled at the young ten-year-old – she was a brand new foster into the family.</p><p>Her mother was declared dead during the emergency C-section and her father only just passed away six months ago during a Raid. Riley entered, jumping on top of Lana. The little witch would be attending Hogwarts that year with Lana, after a touch-and-go situation Riley was in, her magic finally settled once Lana entered the picture. Their foster parents – and the Ministry – were worried she wouldn’t be able to have control of her powers and be classified as an uncontrollable Squib. </p><p>“What’s the matter, Riley?” Lana asked, pushing some of the hair from her eyes.</p><p>“Is Hogwarts safe?” </p><p><em>That </em>was a loaded question – Hogwarts <em>was </em>safe, but now, the Head Girl wasn’t even sure anymore. After Cedric Diggory’s death at the end of last year, Lana knew Hogwarts wouldn’t be the same. The golden dust shimmered down into Riley’s hair. “It is as safe as the castle can be, Riles. But you have to realize, Hogwarts is a no Apparition zone – no one can get in.” Lana was kidding herself – if her uncle could get himself to Hogwarts, and the shite that happened with the Hufflepuff and the Cup, anything was possible. </p><p>“Is everyone was Hogwarts as nice as you?” If Lana wanted to expose herself, she would have thrown her head back and <em>laughed</em>. Her and Minho Paek were the two Slytherins that <em>no one </em>wanted to cross – not even Draco Malfoy and his gang of morons. The sixth and seventh-year were given a reputation that wasn’t allowed to be messed with – in their early years at the castle, they got detention <em>a lot</em>. They never did anything that would get them expelled but enough for the professors to know they raise a little hell if they wanted to. </p><p>Lana gave her a half-hearted smile. “You’ll find your friends.” The brunette wrapped her arms around the ten-year-old, hugging her close to her chest. She leaned into her ear, “Just don’t end up in Gryffindor, all right? Or tell people you’re a foster child in a Squib household.” Riley pulled back, tilting her head in confusion. “It’s better if you don’t tell anyone that until you know you can trust them. Just…trust me, kay?” </p><p>“Okay.” Riley wasn’t sure what scared Lana, but something sure did. The upcoming first-year held onto her foster sister. “I can’t wait to get to Hogwarts!” Her sweet giggles made Lana wish that Hogwarts was just as exciting as she made it out to be. The brunette snuggled the little witch close. “Can we go get our supplies tomorrow?” </p><p>“I need to talk with Hana and Tyler first but… I don’t see why not.” Lana smiled down at the little girl. Riley squealed in delight, hugging Lana tightly. The Slytherin rest her chin lightly on the little witch’s head, taking a deep breath. </p><p>Hogwarts was going to be different. </p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the shimmer of the communication spell. </p><p align="center">
  <strong>Umbridge is coming to Hogwarts.</strong>
</p><p>Lana’s eyes widened as the words dissolved into the air around her. The brunette was making sure she knew everyone who worked at the Ministry of Magic; she wanted to make sure that she didn’t cross one. She may have been called down to the Ministry when her uncle broke out of Azkaban; they thought that <em>maybe </em>Sirius Black was in contact with her. Little did they know that the eldest Black didn’t even know Regulus had fathered a daughter. </p><p>But if Minho was right about <em>Umbridge </em>then the Ministry was messing with the natural order of things at Hogwarts. And as Head Girl, Lana wasn’t sure how the hell Dumbledore agreed to the Devil in Pink to be on the school grounds.</p>
