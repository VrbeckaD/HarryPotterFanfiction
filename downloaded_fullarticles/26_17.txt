</p><p>Chapter One: The New Transfiguration Professor</p><p>Draco flicked his wand, levitating cauldrons to the desks throughout the rooms. He had been preparing his classroom for the better part of an hour, making sure everything was in its proper place. The new school year started tomorrow and while he normally didn't care for others opinions, he demanded respect from his students. To him, respect started with an organized and well-prepared classroom, something his apprenticing under Slughorn had taught him.</p><p>His personal cauldron bubbled on his desk at the front of the room and he made his way over to it, expertly stirring the concoction. He had first-years as his very first class of the year, and he wanted to impress them. Not that Pompion potion was hard to brew but turning one's head into a pumpkin was a sure-fire way to get eleven-year-olds to like you. Draco had done this for every first-year class, giving 50 house points to the student brave enough to drink it.</p><p>When liquid turned red, he stirred counter-clockwise, then quickly sliced the foxglove and dropped it in. He switched his stirring to the opposite direction until it took on a shade of bright pumpkin orange and removed it from the heat. He was able to bottle three vials worth but only needed two since his classes were shared between Houses. Grinning to himself he thought of a devious idea of what to do with the extra bottle. He'd leave the potion un-labelled and offer it to his Advanced Potion's class, as a test of trust. Whoever dared to drink it wouldn't have to do the first assignment of the year.</p><p>Draco set the filled bottles on his desk and cast a cleaning charm on the dirty cauldron.</p><p>"What's got you so happy?"</p><p>The grin instantly dropped from his face as he turned to Neville Longbottom, Herbology Professor and Head of Gryffindor house, who was sauntering through his classroom. He held a large basket in his arms, full of various herbs and potion ingredients.</p><p>Draco scowled as Neville deposited the basket onto his desk, nearly knocking over his newly bottled potion. "Be careful, will you? I need those for tomorrow."</p><p>"Is that the pumpkin head potion you always make?" Neville eyed the orange liquid as he brushed the dirt off his robes. He always seemed to have soil clinging to him and Draco's scowl deepened as he watched the dirt fall onto his pristine floor.</p><p>"Pompion Potion, Longbottom." Draco rolled his eyes, he was used to the Gryffindor's cluelessness when it came to the art of potion-making. He flicked his wand at the basket, sending the plants to their rightful places in his cupboards. He then made it a point to flourish his wand as dramatically as possible when sending a broom and dust pail to get the soil from where Neville stood. He smirked in satisfaction as he watched the man's cheeks turn pink.</p><p>"Sorry, Draco."</p><p>Draco waved his hand dismissively. He'd never admit it to anyone but he had grown a soft spot for the snake-slayer. They had both been hired at the same time, he apprenticed under Sprout and Draco under Slughorn. Herbology and Potions required a mutual relationship, so they worked together constantly. Both mentors retired at the end of the '00 school year, just two years after the war, and left the two of them to their own devices. He'd deny it to anyone that asked but Neville had become a close friend.</p><p>"Thanks for bringing the plants. Are you heading to dinner?"</p><p>Neville's eyes instantly brightened, "Yes! Did you hear the new Transfiguration professor arrived today? McGonagall sure has been mysterious about who it is all summer but today we'll finally get to find out!"</p><p>Draco grimaced, he didn't much care for who it was, he only hoped it was someone he didn't know or, at least, could tolerate. "No, I didn't. I've been down here all day getting the classroom ready and finalizing my syllabus. You know very well that you and Bones are the only ones that come down here."</p><p>She was another person who had accepted him. Draco had only been teaching for a year when Susan Bones joined them as the new Muggle Studies professor and Head of Hufflepuff. When she first arrived she regarded him with indifference but, noticing how he and Neville were friends, she eventually came around. Three years later and he supposed he was stuck with a Gryffindor and a Hufflepuff for best friends - if only his school-boy self could see him now.</p><p>Draco and Neville made their way out of the chilly dungeons and towards the Great Hall, curiosity for the new professor quickening their pace. Flitwick and Hagrid, as well as many other professors, were already seated while Trelawney and Lupin stood at the table speaking animatedly.</p><p>That was another surprise.</p><p>Like many others, Remus Lupin had not come out of the War unscathed; but he did come out alive and decided to retake his post as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He had been offered the position of Head of Gryffindor as well, but it was hard enough to convince the parents of the students to accept a werewolf as a professor. So, Lupin declined and left Neville to become the Head when he started, allowing McGonagall to finally step down.</p><p>The man had already been a teacher for a year before Draco started his apprenticeship, the curse on the position having been broken with Voldemort's defeat. The pair regarded each other with respect but were not overly friendly. Draco supposed old grudges were hard to break, especially when coupled with the fact he had lost his wife and Draco's cousin, Nymphadora, in the final battle.</p><p>Draco's role in the War caused a permanent rift between him and many people but he was making an effort to change that. One of the ways he did this was by ensuring Lupin always had plenty of Wolfsbane available come every full moon. It was the least he could do, really.</p><p>"Sybill, I appreciate you looking out for me but I can assure you, I won't be taking a swim in the Lake anytime soon." Lupin looked like he just wanted to sit down, his clothes and demeanour always somewhere between unkempt and pure exhaustion.</p><p>"But Remus!" cried Trelawney in her overly ominous voice, "I have seen it! You will swim in the Lake and lose something precious to you. You must take the signs seriously!"</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes but nodded in greeting to the Professors as he passed. Lupin nodded back but Trelawney regarded him with her large spectacled eyes.</p><p>"Oh, Draco, dear!" she reached out and grabbed Draco's wrist, yanking him to her side. "My poor dear. Oh Draco, Draco, Draco."</p><p>Draco looked to Professor Lupin pleadingly but the werewolf had taken the opportunity to slip away and sit, leaving Draco to deal with the eccentric Seer alone. He darted his eyes over to Neville, who was snickering behind his hand.</p><p>"I have seen something of you this year, Draco. You know every year I look to the future for each of the professors?" Her hand held his wrist in a strong vice-grip that he would never have suspected someone as small and frail as she could possess.</p><p>Draco internally sighed. With no way out of the conversation, he supposed he'd have to actually speak to her. "Yes, Trelawney, I do."</p><p>"Well, after four long years, I have finally seen something for you!" She looked at him imploringly, waiting for him to ask her what it was.</p><p>Draco could honestly not give a rat's arse. He never regarded Divination as anything other than an easy elective to take - he had bullshitted his way through most of the course when he was in school.</p><p>"Erm... Okay?"</p><p>Trelawney narrowed her eyes at his reply but continued on, "You will suffer a good deal this year, my boy. Oh yes, I have seen it." She patted his arm as if to reassure him, "Thrice you will suffer but it won't be for nought! Yes my dear, in the end, I believe you will be happy."</p><p>Draco scrunched his nose and looked down at the Divination professor. At six-foot-three inches he towered over many people, but with Trelawney only being a mere five feet tall, he dwarfed her. "So... I'm going to suffer, but I'm going to be happy about it?"</p><p>Trelawney waved her hands wildly in front of her, "Do not ask me anything more!" she shrilly yelled, "For the fates have shown me that I cannot tell you how you will suffer, only that you will."</p><p>Draco huffed impatiently, he just wanted to take his seat next to Neville, eat and go back to his classroom. "Ah. Thank you, Trelawney."</p><p>Her grey frizzy hair bounced while she nodded her head as if she had just done him the biggest favour in the world, "Of course, of course. It is my duty to the faculty to ensure you all a safe year! Why, just earlier I was telling dear Hagrid his omens! It was quite interesting, you know. He-"</p><p>Hagrid cleared his throat noisily from the end of the table, his cheeks and nose reddening beneath his large bushy beard as all eyes turned to him. "What was it you were sayin' about te readin' Sybill gave you, Filius?"</p><p>The half-goblin turned to Hagrid with a confused face, "What? We weren't even speak-"</p><p>Hagrid cleared his throat loudly again and after a moment, a look of understanding passed over Flitwicks face. "Ah, yes. Right. Sybill, would you please explain what you told me earlier?"</p><p>With someone actually wanting to hear her prophecies, Trelawney forgot all about Draco and glided towards the end of the table. Dramatically, she began a long flourished speech on the Fates having seen something 'quite special' for Flitwick this year. Draco nodded to the half-giant in thanks and Hagrid waved his hand, shooing him to sit down quickly.</p><p>Draco didn't need any further encouragement. He all but ran to the other end of the table, taking his seat next to Neville, who was still laughing behind his hand, and Professor Vector. He was about to tell his friend off when Susan rushed into the hall, followed by Madame Hooch and Madame Pince.</p><p>Susan quickly took her seat on the opposite side of Neville, gulping for air, "You'll... never... guess... who-" The familiar sound of McGonagall's heeled boots clicking on the cobblestones instantly quieted the room - even Trelawney silenced her ramblings</p><p>The black pointed hat the Headmistress always wore came into view at the entrance of the Great Hall, her emerald green robes billowed behind her elegantly. Draco always noted how different she was to Dumbledore. Where he had received respect based on rumours of his immense power, McGonagall demanded it with her lionhearted demeanour.</p><p>A figure followed closely behind her and Draco's heart plummeted into his stomach when he realized who it was. He'd know that bushy head anywhere.</p><p>Hermione. Fucking. Granger.</p><p>Draco's eyes felt like they were going to pop from their sockets as they widened, and he half-turned in his seat to Neville and Susan. Neville looked just as surprised as him, but Susan was grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>"It's Hermione," She whispered to them excitedly, "She's the new Transfiguration professor!"</p><p>He bit back a 'Thank you, Captain Obvious' retort and turned his eyes back to the pair as they reached the table. McGonagall stood proudly beside Hermione, who looked a bit timid under the gaze of all the faculty.</p><p>"Everyone, as I'm sure all of you know, this is Hermione Granger. She will be taking Transfiguration over for me. I expect you all to help her as she settles in." She eyed Draco as she said this last part, looking down at him from over her squared spectacles. He scowled back at her, understanding her insinuation. He was sure the entire rest of the faculty remembered how much of a prick he was to her in their school days.</p><p>When was the last time he had seen Granger? It had to have been two years ago, at Harry and Blaise's wedding.</p><p>The two wizards had gotten together shortly after the War ended, once Harry broke it off with Ginny upon the discovery that he preferred the company of other men. Ginny didn't seem to be too upset with it, as she began dating Oliver Wood only a month or so later.</p><p>Draco swallowed heavily as he took in the young witch standing on the opposite side of the table. She looked much like she had the night of the wedding, except now she was fresh-faced and her curls were certainly not nearly as tamed. She wore a dark blue sweater and muggle jeans that hugged her legs so tightly Draco wondered if her ballet-flat clad feet were losing circulation.</p><p>"'Ermione! Can't believe we'll get te be co-workers! Minerva, how could yer keep this from us all summer?" Hagrid bellowed from his seat.</p><p>He noticed Lupin, Vector and Flitwick had perked up as well, obviously excited to have probably their favourite pupil and fellow Order member teaching alongside them.</p><p>McGonagall smiled at the large man, "I'm very sorry to have had to, Hagrid, but it wasn't finalised until last week. I didn't want to get anyone's hopes up." She placed a hand on Hermione's arm, "Now dear, there's an empty seat beside Septima." She gestured towards the seat close to where Draco sat. He felt the blood drain from his face as her dark eyes landed on him.</p><p>Her pinched expression spoke volumes as she walked towards them, but it instantly left her face as Neville and Susan stood to greet her.</p><p>Neville pulled her into a quick hug. "We were just together last week with the Potters. I can't believe you didn't say anything! I knew you were starting to hate the Ministry life but-"</p><p>She shrugged. "Yes well, I've always thought about teaching and Professor McGo—Minerva's been after me to take over for her for years. Figured it was time."</p><p>Susan pulled her in for a quick hug and waved a hand at Hermione's muck-up of McGonagall's name, "Oh don't worry about names. We all still call the older Professors by their surnames, even McGonagall. Seems too odd, after being their students for seven years, to suddenly start calling them Filius or Minerva. Hell, Neville and Draco have been here for four years and even they still call everyone by surnames."</p><p>At the mention of the Potions Master, Hermione's gaze flickered over to Draco. He narrowed his eyes at her cool regard for him before she continued around the table, passing behind him to take her place on the other side of Professor Vector.</p><p>McGonagall took her seat as well and swept her arm in the air, causing the table to quickly fill with platters of food. Draco immediately reached for the pitcher of wine that appeared in front of him and poured, filling his goblet to the brim. He normally didn't like to drink the night before term began, but he figured he'd need it.</p><p>He could feel Granger's presence radiating from the other side of Vector. She was one of the few people who he had yet to apologise to, for everything that happened in the war. He had tried, many <em>many </em>times, but every time he worked up the resolve to seek her out, he'd chicken out, afraid that she would laugh in his face. So, it was no surprise to him that she still harboured ill feelings. Even still, it was grating on his nerves that he could feel her glaring at him.</p><p>Draco shifted his body to turn more towards Neville and began piling food onto his plate, taking a deep gulp of his wine.</p><p>Neville eyed him curiously, "You alright, Draco? You rarely drink."</p><p>Draco glared at him over the top of his goblet before setting it down. "I'm fine, Longbottom." He began eating his dinner, looking around at the empty hall from his place at the head of the room.</p><p>He couldn't wait for the school to be filled with students again. Not that he was soft, Malfoy's weren't <em>soft</em>. It was just that he much preferred the school full of life than empty, as it was now. An empty Hogwarts was haunted, with both literal forms and figurative spirits of those who suffered inside the ancient castle.</p><p>Vector had struck up a conversation with Granger, speaking about what to expect for tomorrow. Draco glanced at her out of the corner of his eye. Her wild curls seemed to have a mind of their own, as they jostled about while she nodded enthusiastically at Vector's words. He tried to tune her out but at the sound of his name being spoken he perked up.</p><p>"-And Draco, always has a real treat for the first-years. They'll talk about it for <em>weeks</em>!" Vector turned to him with a genuine smile, "Tell her about your first lesson, Draco."</p><p>Draco swallowed the bit of chicken he had in his mouth, though it nearly got stuck on the way down. Granger's narrowed gaze caused any moisture in his mouth to disappear instantly. "I, um. I offer both first-year classes a Pompion Potion... Whoever drinks it gets 50 house points..." He shifted uncomfortably in his seat and grabbed his wine, gulping down a hearty mouth full.</p><p>Vector grinned beside him and turned back to Hermione, seemingly unaware of any tension between them. "It's such a sweet idea. You can hear the laughter all the way from Hogsmead! I daresay Potions has become something of a favourite class around here. Not like how it was before."</p><p>Draco turned back to his plate, though his appetite had disappeared completely sometime between Granger's first and last harsh glare. She hadn't even bothered to comment on his potion idea - which was something he was quite proud of - not even with something snarky and it... and it bothered the hell out of him.</p><p>He ate a few more bites of mashed potatoes before grabbing his wine goblet and topping it. He leant back in his chair and sipped his drink, scowling into the empty room. He saw Susan nudge Neville and gesture towards him with a questioning look.</p><p>He turned in his seat towards his friends, his scowl deepening at Neville's concerned face. Before they could ask him any idiotic questions, he quickly knocked back the contents of his goblet and placed it on the table. He desperately wanted to be free from the tension Granger brought with her. So, he stood and nodded to the Headmistress, who regarded him with a quirked eyebrow before rounding the table and striding from the Great Hall. He could feel the eyes of every professor staring at him as he left, boring a hole into his back.</p><p>Though his mood could be considered sullen most times, he always spoke with the other teachers and stayed until the end of every meal. At the very least, he was sure Neville understood his... situation with Granger. He only hoped he explained it to Susan enough that she wouldn't ask him about it, though he was sure she'd have a million questions tomorrow anyway.</p><p>Retreating down the cold Dungeon steps, Draco took a deep breath to steady himself. He had rushed down here in haste and his heart thundered in his chest. He walked to the end of the corridor where the Potions Classroom was and slipped inside. Striding to his desk, he unclipped his long black robes and draped them over the back of the chair, leaving him in his dark suit.</p><p>He sank into the chair with an audible thud that echoed into the empty class. His head still buzzed from the wine and he leant forward to place it in his hands, running his fingers through, and messing up his normally impeccably styled hair. Only one thought kept circulating in his mind.</p><p>Trelawney was right. This year was going to be hell.</p>
