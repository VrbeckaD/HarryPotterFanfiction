    <p>Chapter 1</p><p> </p><p>Fuel is scarce.  At this point I'd be less surprised to find another wizard around here first.  I guess it was only a matter of time.  Still, I grit my teeth as the fuel gauge is hanging below the big E and the smell of exhaust comes through the vent.</p><p> </p><p>We have all the windows open.  Even the door is rigged open to let air flow through.  But we're barely going thirty down the road and there's really no wind to be felt.</p><p> </p><p>The moving truck behind us has undergone a few more changes.  We tried cutting bigger holes to let more air through.  Not that it's much help with it being so hot.  So we also cut off the roof.  Or rather, Sirius did.  Thankfully Sammie and Nessa haven't asked too many questions.</p><p> </p><p>It also helps that were not overwhelmed with animals like we were before.  We have four goats, three adults and one kid, as well as five deer, one the male and one still a fawn.  There's only two pigs, one male and one female, although we think the female is pregnant.  And from our birds we still have two turkey, a male and female, and seven chicken with one rooster.</p><p> </p><p>We've been as careful as we can be.  Sirius and I have taken to shifting and scouting ahead to see where we should head to next.  Then we drive to the next spot and secure ourselves in.  It's been working so far but we've been running on fumes for the last few miles now.</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully we have a destination.  Sirius found it during his scouting two nights ago.  It's a fenced in area with a handful of survivors in what was once a plant nursery.  We're hoping to trade a few animals for some fuel or even some fresh grown food.</p><p> </p><p>Not that we don't still have the shrunken supplies in the secret hatch on the roof because we do, it's stuffed full.  It's just we haven't told Sammie or Nessa or even Carl yet.  I doubt that they'd be upset or prejudice.  It's just that Sirius says they're not yet pack so we should wait.</p><p> </p><p>We've done well on food, even animal feed.  But fuel is just too scarce.  We've checked every station and pileup that we've come upon and it's been like pulling water from rocks.  Sirius even taught me a spell to pull the small amount of fuel from the bottom of the tanks and that's the only reason we've managed to get as far as we have.</p><p> </p><p>The road rises up before dipping back down and curving to the left.  The temperature gage is closer to hot than to halfway which can't be good.  But again, we have little choice but to risk it.</p><p> </p><p>I asked Sirius if there was anything we could do, magic wise, to fix this.  Unfortunately it seems his time in Azkaban has taken a lot from him.  While he brags about building his bike from scraps he admits that he can't remember how it was done.  He also says my dad helped him build it.</p><p> </p><p>I wish that I could help but even fifth year spells are useless for this.  I never really studied anything I didn't have to, much to Hermione's annoyance,  so I'm not much help.  He's been trying, experimenting with runes on abandoned vehicles we've passed.  Unfortunately none of it is working yet.</p><p> </p><p>I glance over at Daryl driving.  His brow is drawn down in worry as his eyes keep switching between the road ahead of us and the temperature gauge behind the wheel.  It's been steadily rising, as has a smell like hot metal.  We won't make it much farther.</p><p> </p><p>The road curves again, opening to four lanes.  There's more stuff here.  Several neighborhoods, most look well established, fill the right side of the road.  A school sits on the left, probably the reason for the four lanes.  There's also plenty abandoned vehicles around.</p><p> </p><p>I send a questioning look to Daryl.  He visibly struggles a moment before shaking his head.  It's not much further to the place Sirius found and we can't risk stopping here if it turns out there's no fuel to be sourced.  It's also far to exposed to risk us breaking down.</p><p> </p><p>The left side past the school has a tall tower followed by a large open field.  A gas station pops up on the right as the four lanes drop back down to two.  I guess the four lanes really were just for the school.</p><p> </p><p>Another neighborhood begins after the gas station although a road seperated them, curling back behind the gas station.  A quick glance shows a large building, almost like a hotel, but with a sign for a living center.  I consider asking what in the world is a living center but with how tense and quiet the others are I doubt they would appreciate questions.</p><p> </p><p>A road appears on the left, flowing between a small building proudly labeled as a preschool and another school.  We take the turn, ignoring the houses and business that continue down the main road.  The side road has a small short building that's split between a dog groomers and an animal hospital.  Then the road rises up a hill before dropping sharply and going flat for a mile.</p><p> </p><p>We crest the hill, the smell of hot metal is stronger now which has us all tensing up.  But the fence is obvious now which brings a second of relief.  Unfortunately, the sight of the fence broken halts any relief we may have felt.</p><p> </p><p>Daryl curses, tightening his grip on the wheel and gritting his teeth.  Sammie lets out a choked sob, turning to press her face into Nessa's neck where they stand hovering just behind us.  Thorin crawls into my lap, Tiny struggling to follow.  </p><p> </p><p>I cling to them both.  My stomach clenches at the sight of what awaits us.  Because it was clearly a good stronghold.  The fence is made of eight foot tall four foot wide boards with what looks like an iron fence supporting it on the inside.  Except for, of course, the portion at the front that was clearly overrun.</p><p> </p><p>Daryl stops the RV, shutting off the engine that was growing steadily louder.  None of us move, each frozen in disappointment.  Sirius had said there were people here.  We thought...</p><p> </p><p>"Okay," Daryl glares out at the mess awaiting us, "here's what we're gonna do.  Us guys are gonna do a sweep inside.  Carl, you and Sammie get to watch the kids while Nessa takes watch up top.  Close the door and keep the kids inside."</p><p> </p><p>No one argues although Thorin tries to cling to me when I try to get up.  Sammie pulls Tiny away, hugging her close and moving back to the bed where the two little ones are napping.  I hug Thorin, whispering to him, "I won't go far and I promise, no matter what, I will always come back for you."</p><p> </p><p>Daryl slips out of the drivers side door, his crossbow in hand.  Merle and Sirius meet him, both frowning worriedly at the broken fence.  He speaks to them, too low for me to hear but no doubt he's just telling them the plan.  I pass Thorin over to Carl and slip out my door.  </p><p> </p><p>I take a moment to close the RV door.  My palms press against the side and I push my magic out, feeling it engulf the RV.  It's not a spell, or not really.  It's mostly intent and stubbornness but it does work.  A wish of protection, a lingering web of my power, to keep those inside safe.</p><p> </p><p>I relax now that my magic is protecting them.  Merle and Sirius are already at the broken part of the fence, weapons up and aimed but not yet firing.  I hurry to join them, stepping up beside Daryl.  </p><p> </p><p>Inside the fence is a small building, a simple white thing with signs still in the window showing various flowers.  The parking lot is small, only enough for five or six cars but no lines drawn on the grey pavement.  There's a makeshift stove beneath a torn canopy.  Really it's just a square of bricks with a metal grate on top and burnt wood ash in the bottom.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately there's also blood smears and puddles everywhere.  At least there aren't any walkers around so far.  We split as we usually do.  Sirius and Merle move off to the left so Daryl and I take the right.</p>
