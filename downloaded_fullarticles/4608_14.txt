    <p>When
Cho went to kiss Harry sniffling and grieving, her cheeks stained with
tears, it was if they both hit an invisible wall in the air. A
pressure that grew as they got closer and pushed them away from each
other. The closest Cho got to him was about three inches then she
pulled back with a shaky laugh.</p><p>“<span><span>Figures,”
she smiled weakly and reached out a hand to pat his shoulder and then
dropped it as she stepped back, “See you around.”</span></span></p><p>
Harry
immediately went and told Ron and Hermione.</p><p>
Ron
grimaced, “Oooh, tough luck there, mate.”</p><p>
Harry
frowned at him, “What do you <i>mean</i>?”</p><p>
Hermione
cocked her head thoughtfully as she set her quill down, “I’ve
read about this… Sometimes a witch or wizards magical
signature is so completely incompatible with another that they repel
one another like… magnets. You know how when they’re
opposite poles the magnets stick together but the same pole repel and
you can’t even push them together? It’s like that.”</p><p>“<span><span>But
then, I wouldn’t be able to touch her at all? I’ve
touched Cho… her arm, I’m pretty sure I’ve touched
her arm,” Harry said in confusion.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Well,
that’s the very interesting thing about it, you see, our magic
is quite sedate most of the time unless we’re using it to cast
or when we’re very agitated- that’s where spontaneous
uncontrolled magic comes from,” Hermione said, spreading her
hands as she became more engaged in the subject, “and when
you’re about to do something like… kiss someone you
really fancy-” </span></span></p><p>
Harry
flushed.</p><p>“<span><span>-your
heart rate picks up and you get nervous and you magic gets agitated.
Our bodies are really quite bad at telling the difference between
good, excited nervous and more life threatening bad nervous. It only
really affects you when you’re really close to someone as well,
so it’s not really that noticeable a majority of the time.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Oh…”
Harry said blankly.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Don’t
worry,” Ron reassured him, “It’s really rare to be
that repelled.”</span></span></p><p>
Hermione
nodded in agreement, “It’s like- in a sample size of- of
a <i>thousand</i>people, you’ll be slightly repelled from
four or five and strongly repelled by only one, at the most.”</p><p>
Ron
added, “And it’s not all bad. If you find someone you’re
a really good match with it’s like- like <i>amazing</i>,
the best thing ever. True love and all. My mum and dad are like
that.”</p><p>“<span><span>I
wouldn’t worry about it,” Hermione said.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
nodded, “Yeah, there’ll be others.”</p><p>
Harry
nodded too, trying not to dwell on what had happened.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p>
When
he tried to kiss Ginny in the common room, with everyone cheering and
celebrating, they got so close he could feel the warmth of her breath
ghost across his lips. It was brief and no one saw that they really
hadn’t kissed. Ginny tried to hide her confusion and
disappointment but Harry could see it all the same. It probably
looked quite like his own expression.</p><p>
They
tried again in private later but it was even worse, likely because
they were more nervous. Ginny gave him a sad smile and left to be
alone. He heard that she spent the next couple days in the Ravenclaw
tower with Luna. Ron was mad at him for breaking his sister’s
heart and Harry didn’t have it in him to explain what had
happened. </p><p>
He
felt like it was his fault and he was entirely certain he had the
worst luck in the world.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p>
After
the war was a time for new beginnings. Life could only get better and
Harry was certain his magical signature being incompatible with
people was because of Voldemort’s horcrux being inside him. Or
perhaps it was a case of not kissing enough people.</p><p>
When
he and all his friends went out drinking and having fun that summer
he made a point, once he had enough drunken courage, to try and
kiss <i>someone</i>. It didn’t even matter who. He just
wanted to find someone he didn’t bounce off of like he was
wearing a fish tank on his head. Each time he tried, it got a little
easier to try again. Until it got to the point where he’d try
to kiss everyone in the bar who’d let him.</p><p>
He
got close a few times, like he had with Ginny, but for most, he would
feel the push back before he was even six inches off. Luna kissed his
cheek once when she caught him off guard, it was a very sweet
friendly kiss. Harry couldn’t stop thinking about how the first
and maybe only time he’d ever felt lips on his skin was from a
friend.</p><p>
He
went back to Hogwarts with Hermione and Ron to finish his schooling,
for their “eighth year”. McGonagall was very big on
inter-house unity. All the teachers would lavishly praise and give
house points to anyone so much pausing to pick up a dropped parchment
for a classmate from another house. The effort resulted in much
embarrassment all around. There was no bullying, but most houses kept
to themselves. Perhaps, that was why McGonagall allowed all the
eighth and seventh years have a party.</p><p>
Like
the good teenagers they were, there was a great deal of illicit
alcohol involved and very little self-control.</p><p>
Harry
threw back the last of his fire whisky and thumped the glass down on
the table, yelling above the music from the wireless, “I’m
gonna kiss everyone in this room!”</p><p>
A
drunken cheer greeted his declaration. A girl sitting behind him
startled to her feet, her drink spilling over her fingers as she
stepped closer, “Me first,” she smiled shyly.</p><p>
She
had been flirting rather desperately with Harry all night and though
he wasn’t interested in the slightest he leaned down. She
twitched forward eagerly and was just as quickly pushed back quite a
distance from Harry. Apparently, she was a particularly bad match.</p><p>
He
didn’t laugh in her face but it was a near thing. He was just
drunk enough that awfulness of his situation was fucking hilarious.</p><p>“<span><span>Sorry,”
Harry grinned and turned to the person sitting beside her and then
the next person and the next. One miss after another as the music and
chatter grew louder and the night wore on. He teased Dean and Seamus
into a kiss, Dean almost managed it, close enough Harry could feel
his laughter before he pulled away to give Seamus a proper kiss. He
did not kiss Ron or Hermione, it would’ve been like kissing a
sibling and he wasn’t interested in having creepy nightmares
about it for the rest of his life. Everyone else he approached
humoured him and gave Harry a go at a quick kiss.</span></span></p><p>
He
was fast running out of people to try- and fail -to kiss when he
found himself at the back corner of the room, the large couch pushed
against the wall had been taken over by the only three Slytherin’s
who came back to finish up their schooling, Blaise, Pansy and, Draco
Malfoy. They were relaxed, somewhat sprawled over one another with a
bottle of fire whisky to pass between them. They weren’t nearly
as relaxed when they noticed Harry staring at them, the lot of them
stiffening like a group of alley cats arching their backs and
hissing.</p><p>“<i><span>What</span></i><span><span>?”
Pansy lifted her nose with a sniff, “We’ve a right to be
here, same as you.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>You
need something, Potter?” Blaise asked.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
blinked, “A kiss,” he said. Once upon a time, the
prospect of kissing a trio of Slytherins would have been far too
nerve-wracking but not anymore. The thing about trying to kiss about
a hundred odd people was that the whole procedure rather lost its
magic, so to speak.</p><p>
They all stared at him blankly.</p><p>“<span><span>I
did say I was going to kiss everyone in the room,” Harry made a
show of looking around, “You’re here.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>You’ve </span></span><i><span>got</span></i><span><span> to
be kidding,” Pansy said, raising an eyebrow in disbelief.</span></span></p><p>
Blaise
laughed,  pushing himself to his feet and out of the tangle of
his friend’s legs without somehow tripping himself up, “Me
first, Boy-wonder,” Blaise said with the smug challenging sort
of look that seemed to be calling out Harry’s bluff.</p><p>
Harry
returned the look, “Get on with it then.”</p><p>
A flicker of hesitation crossed Blaise’s face before he managed
to mask it, crossing the distance between them.</p><p>
Harry
tried to stay calm. The whole kissing thing seemed to work out better
if he could but it was pointless since Blaise hardly had a go at all.
As soon as the nudging pressure began to make itself known he backed
off with a smirk.</p><p>
Blaise
dropped back onto the couch with a thud, “Well, that was
anticlimactic.”</p><p>
Pansy
looked from Harry to Blaise curiously and then popped up, approaching
Harry with a tilt to her head that brought to Harry’s mind the
alley cat image again. She went up on tiptoes and Harry leaned down
as she tried to kiss the corner of his mouth. Harry was a little
surprised how close she got, about a half an inch away.</p><p>
Her
eyes widened as she pulled back. She exchanged a questioning look
with Blaise that turned into a knowing one.</p><p>
She
looked back at Harry with an appraising smile, “I see,”
she said to herself as she slowly backed away from him.</p><p>
When
the back of her legs hit the couch she stopped and looked over at
Draco who was sitting stiffly in the centre. His arms were wrapped
nervously around his waist, one hand clutching the neck of the whisky
bottle as he scowled up at Harry.</p><p>“<span><span>Your
turn, Draco,” Pansy said. When he didn’t move immediately
she gave his ankle a half-hearted kick, “Come on.”</span></span></p><p>
Blaise
leaned over, grabbing hold of his shoulder and pushing him forward,
“Give it a go, my friend. It’s a laugh.”</p><p>
Draco
looked over at Blaise furiously. A flush was rising in his cheeks as
he knocked Blaise’s hand away and stood unsteadily, pushing the
bottle into Pansy’s chest with a bit too much force. She huffed and turned up her nose, flopping back onto the couch next to Blaise who leaned over to whisper in her ear. </p><p>Draco wavered
on his feet, his eyes looking like he was
having trouble focusing. He was completely and utterly pissed.</p><p>
Harry
watched with growing apprehension. Draco was flushed, his hair gone a
little wild, even his clothes were slightly rumpled and there was a
grim determination in his eyes. He took a deep breath,
absent-mindedly pulling his shirt straight and smoothing his hair
back with one hand, though it didn’t stay.</p><p>
A
prickle started on the back of Harry’s neck, the hair on his
arms standing up. His heart rate began to pick up as the shivery
tension raced through Harry with every step Draco got closer. He had
felt this before when they fought, this thundering, shivery pulling
feeling. Harry had always thought it was the adrenaline from being
angry and from fighting but…</p><p>
Draco
stopped a foot away and then almost swayed forward until they were
almost touching. Harry saw close his eyes briefly as if gathering
himself, a shiver made his shoulder twitch. When he opened his eyes
again Harry felt transfixed by the flat grey colour. Harry’s
hand moving without his permission, pressing against the flat planes
of Draco’s chest,. Harry felt another shiver go through Draco,
stronger than the last, his mouth falling open in a silent gasp, his
pupils darkening.</p><p>
Harry
leaned forward, almost haltingly. He kept expecting the pressure to
start, to push him back, but instead, it almost felt like he was
being tugged closer, and there was almost a static hum in the air,
prickling along his skin. He reached up, brushing his fingers lightly
on Draco’s chin, too nervous to actually cup his cheek. Draco
tilted his head and Harry felt his breath ghost across his
lips, <i>felt</i>his lips, soft and careful and shivering just
like Harry was and-</p><p>“<span><span>ENOUGH!”
Headmistress McGonagall’s voice cut through the party like a
blade of ice. “This party is </span></span><i><span>over.</span></i><span><span>”</span></span></p><p>
Harry
and Draco startled away from each other. The music was shut off and
the room slowly took on the deathly calm of those who know they are
completely and utterly hosed.</p><p>
McGonagall’s
eyes narrowed as she looked over the room, “There will be no
more parties, for the rest of the year,” she said coldly,
“Hogsmeade weekends are canceled and everyone here, including
eighth years, are to remain on the castle grounds for the next three
months-” there was a chorus of groans that was abruptly cut off
with a single <i>look</i>, “-All of your curfews are now
at eight pm, <i>all of you</i>.” There were no attempts to
complain this time, simply an overwhelming and spreading air of
despair. “If you are going to act like children, you will
be <i>treated</i> like children. If any of you are found
with alcohol on school grounds again, you <i>will</i> be
suspended,” she pursed her lips in disappointment, “I do
hope you will learn from this. Now go to your dorms.”</p><p>
The
students swayed and shuffled out of the room with their heads low to
avoid eye contact.</p><p>
Harry
hadn’t moved. He wasn’t entirely aware of what was
happening until a hand firmly took him by the upper arm.</p><p>“<span><span>Mr
Potter.” McGonagall said, some of the sternness leaving her
voice, “Are you well? Do you need to go to the hospital wing?”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I-
What-?” Harry asked blankly, his mind entirely consumed by a
single kiss, so brief there was part of his mind that wasn’t
entity certain it had happened.</span></span></p><p>
McGonagall
frowned, her question changing to an order, “Go to the hospital
wing. Have Poppy look you over.”</p><p>“<span><span>The
hospital wing,” Harry repeated.</span></span></p><p>
The
room was entirely empty. Harry didn’t know when that had
happened.</p><p>“<span><span>You’re
trembling Harry,” McGonagall said, looking Harry over with
concern,  “I’ll walk you there myself.”</span></span></p><p><br/>
