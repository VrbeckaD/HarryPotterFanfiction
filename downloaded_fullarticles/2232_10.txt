    <p>Saturday:</p><p>Remus woke up from the best dream he had ever had. He hadn’t slept that well in weeks. Remus stretched out his arms and yawned. Well, he attempted to, only then he realized that he was wrapped around another man. Not only that but he was naked and achingly hard. 
</p><p>Last night was not a dream. Remus tried to pull pieces of last night from his mind, but all he got were pictures of Sirius writhing under him. Wait, Sirius? He studied the man under him. Black hair cascading to his shoulders. Creamy tan skin. Long eyelashes. A slight white scar on the side of his face. He knew that man. For that was Sirius Black, his best friend.

Remus could feel his heart beating faster as memories of the previous night came back to him. The nightclub with James and Lily. The man flirting with Sirius. His intense jealousy. Angry kisses. Clothes being removed. Beautiful tan skin. Jesus Christ, He had fucked Sirius Black.

 Remus had gone back to gawking at the man laid out beneath him. He looked so calm when he was asleep. Remus’s eyes trailed down from his face to his chest. Where he noticed a bite mark right under collarbone. A bite mark, that upon further inspection, looked to be a wolf. Remus had marked his best friend.</p><p>Remus had done lots of reading about marks. He knew that they only had 3 days to fully mate before his heat came. He knew he would become very clingy and possessive. He also knew that if Sirius rejected him, he could never love anyone again. Not even his family. This was not good. He had fucked up. Big time.</p><p>Remus jumped out of bed and put on some boxers. He was looking at the mark in disgust. It was no secret he loved Sirius, but trapping him like this was just wrong. Why would Sirius even want to be with a freak like him? Once a werewolf marked his mate they were expected to be together forever, and only leave each others side when necessary. Remus had wanted this to happen, but did Sirius? Remus didn’t even ask. Sirius probably just thought it was a bite.
</p><p>He couldn't just expect Sirius to drop everything and be with him 24/7. He didnt know how he was gonna phrase, "Hey I need you to drop everything and be with me every waking hour of the day because I marked you, ok." So he decided to keep the whole "Mates" thing under wraps. For now at least. Sirius had enough stress as it was.</p><p>Remus saw his mate, er uh, Sirius begin to stir. His eyes slowly opened and made his way to Remus. Sirius eyes widened when he realized Remus was almost naked, and they widened even more when he realized he was too.
</p><p>"Did we um..." Sirius stuttered motioning to his body.</p><p>Remus nodded, his skin turning light pink. Sirius fell back against the pillows with a long sigh.</p><p>"Remus, you must be huge, because my arse is really sore."</p><p>Remus blushed a dark red. And forced a laugh. It was true he was larger than normal being a werewolf and all. He stood at 6"5 and wore a size 15 in shoes. Though his size did come with disadvantages, such as having an eleven inch dick, which hurt most of his partners.</p><p>He had hurt his mate. He wanted to go to him and kiss him until he felt better. But he pushed down those feelings.</p><p>Remus replied with a weak "Sorry."</p><p>Sirius began getting up, hissing at the pain coming from his lower regions. Remus involuntarily (or at least he'd like to think so) rushed to Sirius's side.</p><p>"Do you need help. I'll carry you. Shit, I'm so sorry." Remus rambled scooping a naked Sirius into his arms.</p><p>Sirus chuckled and wrapped his arms around Remus's neck. " I was going to say no but I guess I'm too late. To the bathroom we go."</p><p>When Remus ran the bath water he noticed Sirius had a collection of light pink marks on his wrists. Remus's heart lurched at the thought of Sirius being hurt, but he decided not to mention it. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>"I'd better be going, wouldnt want to be late for work." Sirius joked going to get his coat. 
</p><p>Sirius had drained his parents bank account before he ran away years ago, he hadn't had to work a day in his life. But Remus didnt want him to go. Remus had literally bathed the poor boy and forced him to eat some eggs. He was turning into his mother. The mate bond was forcing Remus to do these things, and that was the story he was sticking with.</p><p>Sirus was halfway out the door before Remus stopped him.
</p><p>" Why dont you stay a while longer, we could watch those Muggle movies you like." Remus pleaded.</p><p>Sirius looked at him perplexed. "You hate my Muggle movies Moony, what is it you really want "</p><p>Remus froze. He couldn't tell him about the mark.</p><p>"I mean, I just..." Remus took a deep breath. "I want to talk about last night."</p><p>A small smile appeared on Sirius's face.</p><p>"Ok Moony." Remus pulled Sirius back inside. They sat on the couch.</p><p>"Well I dont think last night was a mistake. But for the sake of our friendship we should probably sweep this under the rug," Sirius started.</p><p>Remus felt like crying.</p><p>" But I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are."</p><p>Remus felt tears pool in his eyes. His mate wanted to forget him. He didnt want him. Who would want to stay with a freak like him</p><p>"Remus?" Sirius said pulling him away from his thoughts.</p><p> "Thats fine, we can just forget it." Remus had more sadness in his voice than he thought. He sounded broken. Remus thought he saw something flash through Sirius's eyes. It looked like sadness. He passed it off as pity.</p><p> "See you later Moony, I gotta get out of these clothes." Sirius gave him a hug which erupted sparks all over his body. And then he left. Remus let his mate walk out the door. Remus found himself stumbling to the bathroom. He hadn't felt this bad in a long time. With his wolfs despair mixing with his own, he only knew one way to cope.</p><p>Remus slid down to the bathroom floor. He was full on sobbing now. He ruined Sirius's life. Sirius could have been paired with anyone, but now he was stuck with Remus, and he didn't even know it. After all who would want to be stuck with him?
</p><p>This was all his fault. He did this. He deserved to be rejected. To never feel love again. He deserved it. After rifling through his drawers Remus found what he was looking for. He hadn't cut in a while. Barely noticable white lines were littered across his wrist. He needed more. He deserved more.</p><p>He pressed to cool metal blade to his wrist. He deserved this. This was all his fault. Why would Sirius want him? Why would anyone want him? He looked at his wrist. Remus never cut deeply. Remus was satisfied with the tiny shallow cuts he had made. Remus turned on the shower and He sighed. Why did he let Sirius go. He needed him.</p>
