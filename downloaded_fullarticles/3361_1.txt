          <div class="userstuff"><p>Suddenly, I was getting invited to more parties than ever. Money can really buy you anything.<br/>
I went to every last one of them. Just to spite them all. And although I always felt sick at the beginning, I persisted. With a little help. Wine, whiskey, champagne, didn’t matter. I sneered, looked down on everyone. I didn’t allow their whispers to bother me. As much. Some were brave enough to approach me. Usually about money of course.<br/>
Sometimes I would go with Pansy. She loved being the one everyone talked about, even if it was with malicious intent.<br/>
More often than not I’d come alone. Just to be seen and among people. Even if those people hated me.<br/>
I was always alone at home. Except from house-eleves. But no people. No person. Parents still in prison, it seemed for years to come if they’d survive. I visited sometimes. Mother more than father. She tried. Always held her head high for me, so I wouldn’t see how broken she already was. Always asking me how I am, if I’m eating and such. I lied to make her content.<br/>
I didn’t want to admit it but I was lonely. Even Pansy’s visits didn’t do it for me any more. When I got out of Azkaban she tried to take me out. I always refused. More than two years passed and I was asking her.<br/>
We went to clubs, bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas. Muggle world. It was all so new and exciting. No one spit on me or swore at me. No one knew me. I was completely anonymous and I loved it.<br/>
Since the Potter Incident from several months ago, I went to the balls and dinners to mainly piss <em>him</em> off, among others. It was satisfying to see him trying to decipher my evil intention in that stupid head of his. He never approached me any more. I would curse him if he would.<br/>
I didn’t enjoy those social affairs. But I absolutely adored going out in muggle London. Even when someone threw up on my shoes it didn’t bother me so much. I was just slightly annoyed. They didn’t do it because I was a Malfoy, but because they were hammered.<br/>
I enjoyed dancing. Pansy was great, I was decent too. There were colourful lights and loud music and drinks. No one cared. We were just dancing. Simple as that.<br/>
I didn’t recognise myself. I never thought I could be at ease around muggles, never mind join them doing something. It wasn’t so bad. It wasn’t bad at all.</p>
<p>I was getting drinks at the bar for me and Pansy. As I was about to turn, someone knocked into me. I spilled half the liquid on me.<br/>
‘Fuck,’ I swore.<br/>
‘Dude, I’m sorry! Are you okay?’<br/>
‘Sure,’ I put the glasses down and started patting my shirt with some paper napkin.<br/>
‘Someone pushed me and then a pushed you apparently,’ the man was speaking and I was just nodding my head. I had some drinks already so I wasn’t as mad as I’d be if I were sober. But I was still mildly annoyed.<br/>
‘Look, I pay for it. Right,’ he motioned for the bartender. I wasn’t stopping him. If he wanted to pay, let him.<br/>
He was looking at my stained shirt. It turned from white to pink. ‘I really am sorry.’<br/>
‘Yeah, it’s fine.’ I would spell it clean in the bathroom or something. It was sticking to my skin.<br/>
He was still looking at me. Although I didn’t hate being around muggles any more, I wasn’t keen on talking to strangers.<br/>
‘Thanks,’ I said when the drinks arrived.<br/>
‘The least I could do.’<br/>
I was glad to get away from him. He unsettled me.<br/>
Pansy was getting antsy due to lack of alcohol probably. I told her what happened and went to the toilets.<br/>
I quickly cast the cleaning spell. When I opened the stall door I froze a little.<br/>
The man from the bar was washing his hands and looking at me in the mirror.<br/>
I went to the other sink to wash my hands. I didn’t want the stranger to think I was a slob.<br/>
He turned his whole body to look at me and frowned. ‘Your shirt is clean.’<br/>
Fuck.<br/>
‘Er, yeah I washed it,’ I mumbled, cringing.<br/>
He touched the shirt. ‘It’s dry too.’ He narrowed his eyes. ‘Well, whatever. I’m glad the damage wasn’t long lasting.’<br/>
‘Yeah,’ I started feeling uncomfortable. He was still touching the fabric.<br/>
I must have looked freaked out, he suddenly dropped his hand. ‘Jesus! Sorry. I didn’t want to come on too strong.’<br/>
Oh.<br/>
I was staring at him. He was looking at me and smiled.<br/>
‘Did I?’ he asked stepping closer.<br/>
‘What?’<br/>
‘Came on strong?’<br/>
‘I wouldn’t know.’ I needed to shut up.<br/>
‘Really?’ He was suddenly right in front of me. His eyes dark brown just like his skin.<br/>
I didn’t know what was happening. Did I want it to happen? Was anything happening at all?<br/>
He put his hand on my shoulder and waited. I waited too. He was so tall.<br/>
His face was getting closer and closer. Closer. He kissed me. I kissed back. I could feel him, his tongue in my mouth, his muscles under my roaming hands. Him against me.<br/>
Someone walked in. I heard them piss. I was suddenly pushed into a stall.<br/>
‘Is this too much?’ he whispered into my ear.<br/>
‘No.’ No.<br/>
‘Do you do this often then?’ he kissed behind my ear.<br/>
‘Yes.’ No.<br/>
‘Sure,’ I felt him smile against my skin.<br/>
He put his hand in my trousers and touched me.<br/>
‘Do you like this?’ he asked against my lips.<br/>
‘Yes.’ Yes.<br/>
‘Is it too much now?’<br/>
‘No.’<br/>
He kissed me. My hands were in his short curls, scraping his skin. My tongue in his mouth.<br/>
He opened my trousers and pulled. My briefs followed. And then he was on his knees.<br/>
His lips travelling on my stomach down and down. His hands on my hips.<br/>
He looked up. ‘You’re so hot.’ And he was taking me in his mouth without any further ado.<br/>
It was so good. So relaxing. It was a long time since I felt something similar. Sixth year probably.<br/>
My mind went completely blank. The only thing I heard and felt was him. And I heard myself too.<br/>
I finished. He came up and kissed me. I tasted myself on his tongue and lips. It was strange. It was arousing.<br/>
He took my hand and put it on his hard dick.<br/>
I jerked him off. Our tongues moving together.<br/>
After we stopped panting he put something in my pocket.<br/>
‘I hope I didn’t come on very strong,’ he smiled.<br/>
I laughed. Everything about that was very strong. ‘Of course not.’<br/>
‘Good.’ He kissed me one last time and exited the stall.<br/>
When I heard the door closed I looked at the napkin. There was a number. And a name. Derek.</p>
<p>I should’ve given him mine. I knew I wouldn’t call. He might have.<br/>
I never met him again. I never called him.</p></div>
