    <p>Faint morning light filtered through the slit in the curtains as he blearily opened his eyes from his deep slumber. He felt really cozy as he pulled the warm body snuggled against him closer to himself under the blankets. Ginny was sleeping peacefully against him and everytime he looked at her beautiful face, he still felt like the luckiest bloke in the world to have Ginny as his girlfriend. He was quite comfortable, though his body had other urgent demands that needed taking care of despite how much he wanted to ignore it and sink back into a blissful doze.</p><p>It was a rare free day for both him and Ginny, what with them having such busy schedules of an Auror and a Quidditch player often clashing against the free times of the other. Just last month, Ginny was on a break from an injury. It was due to an amalgam of factors not limited to a distracted teenage intern responsible for padding her up, unexpected dust storm which brought sudden sneeze and a rogue bludger she missed noticing due to the said sneeze.</p><p>So he booked a nice cozy private house for a week near Rosemarkie Beach in Scotland. A nice private spot and perhaps some adventures in the nearby caves he read about sounded like a perfect break for them both. Unfortunately for his plans, just a day before he could present it to her, he was called away due to positive sightings of Jugson near Surrey. He hadn’t yet told her about the holiday, though he suspected she knew he was up to something.</p><p>With how little time they got to see each other, a rare overlapping free day was something to be cherished and Harry really wanted to spend as little time away from her as possible. Nonetheless, the pressure on his bladder became too much and he carefully extracted himself from Ginny, making sure not to disturb her. Her brows wrinkled in displeasure of losing her warm snuggly pillow as she rolled onto her back and fell back into a peaceful sleep.</p><p>He returned from the bathroom only to be greeted by the titillating view of Ginny lying on her back, the blanket only partially covering her, exposing one of her soft breasts and the light spattering of freckles he adored so much and one leg out of the blanket from midway of her shapely calf. Her silky hair was spread across the pillow like a flaming halo framing her making her look like Goddess of passion and lust.</p><p>Lust surged in him at her sinful allure and he was hard in an instant as he was reminded  of the night before. Her parted lips reminded him of how she went down on him for so long pleasuring and edging him with her succulent lips and nimble tongue as she stared into his eyes all throughout, not once wavering. It was the sensual and intense look in her eye when she went down all the way when he was nothing but a gibbering mess coming into her mouth in absolute rapture. </p><p>When she swallowed, still gazing intently into his eyes, and her tongue darted out to lick her upper lip, he was not really surprised to feel himself stirring. If not for the fact that his hands were tied to the headboard, he would have gone down her all night to show his appreciation as he always did. It was still a long time before they gave in to the blissful oblivion, very tired but abundantly satiated. </p><p>Well, they were indeed satisfied last night but this morning was a different matter altogether and he planned on making sure he made up for last night and then some.</p><p>He slowly pulled the blankets off the rest of the way revealing her other breast and almost lost his will to continue with his plan to tease her. He shook his head fortifying his will. <em>It would be worth the wait, pleasuring Ginny is more important</em>, he reminded himself as more of her smooth skin was revealed. Her abs, taut from her training, the small patch of sparse red hair that made him want to just bury his face in it amongst other parts of his body, long shapely legs starting from her muscled yet soft thighs and the curve of her calves. Every part of her was just too tempting. She was too perfect and he took a moment just to admire her beauty.</p><p>She was the most beautiful woman he knew and no other woman could ever compare to her in his mind. She was so passionate and fiery with a quick wit and a kind heart that also made him appreciate how amazing she is. When  asleep though her beauty was even more enhanced. The peaceful smile and the way she relaxed around him like she felt the safest and happiest in the world always brought a warm bubbly feeling of contentment.</p><p>The smattering of freckles covered across her whole body, concentrated particularly across her nose and that one distracting pair just below her lower lip. The freckles thinned as they went lower on her body but never really faded fully. Her arms were spread with one over her head and the other laying lightly across her stomach. Her soft small breasts looked luscious and just the perfect size for him to cup them in his palm and just play with them all day if he could get away with it. Her long fit legs were spread apart a little with one folded slightly. This completed a perfect image of Ginny Weasley he was very much in love and lust with without a doubt.</p><p>He decided that he had enough of simply admiring and climbed the bed to get started on his turn to pleasure her. He slowly lifted her hands over her head and raising her hands did interesting things to her breasts that distracted him for a moment. He wanted to start at her pussy straight away but he was no longer a fumbling teenager and knew better. Foreplay was as much a part of the game as the actual act itself was and buildup always made the climax better especially when she exploded oh so spectacularly when he teased her longer.</p><p>He lightly pecked on her lips tracing his lips along the cheeks to her eyelids, brushing his lips lightly on each. He slowly drifted across her jaw and gave a small nip to her earlobe. Ginny shifted slightly, mummering with a small smile in her sleep, no doubt think about interesting things he was doing to her in her dream. He spent a few more moments on her ear and then started on her neck and shoulder, lightly nipping, sucking and licking at her soft skin on the sweet spot the he knew was very sensitive. Sure enough, the soft husky moan she gave was like music to his ears.</p><p>He looked up to see her eyes fluttering open still heavy with sleep. It was time to enact his brilliant plan. He raised his head and looked into her eyes intently as she slowly awakened fully and the comprehension drew in them. The smouldering look she gave him told him that she realized he was going to be in control this time.</p><p>He very rarely lost control. Ginny once mentioned how he had been without control all his early life, be it due to Tom or his relatives, once the threat of Tom was over, the Auror life meant he had to be in very strict control all the time. Sometimes it spilled over to his personal life with her which was fine with Ginny. Every once in a while though after a particularly trying week like the case with Amycus Carrow last winter, he had too much pent up aggression and fear from the words he heard and the threats to his family.</p><p>
  <em>That was a glorious night for Ginny as she often mentions and today was going to be another.</em>
</p><p>She gave a quick nod to indicate her acceptance that he was in charge this morning. By silent agreement, they did not utter a single word save for the moans and groans of pleasure that may follow. There were times for words but not today.</p><p>His hands weren’t idle after. They slowly caressed from her tummy to her sides lightly tickling her as they drifted up to the swell of her breasts on the side. His lips passed her collarbone and reached the tips of her nipple and he lightly blew on her. He was gratified to see them harden as she moaned some more. He gave the other nipple a light blow and gave a soft lick on each nipple never once neglecting either breast. Another light blow as his fingers skimmed across the sensitive skin and then he took one into his lips and gave a gentle bite the way he knew show loved making her moan in a way that told him she was close to waking.</p><p>Her breasts were a thing of beauty, something he could worship all day. They were so soft and yet so firm, just the right size to make him drool. The light dusting of freckles simply made them so much more alluring in his eyes. The swell and the curves with the pink tip made for an erotic image that called to him on a primal level. The way they heaved and swayed with her deep breath was hypnotic to watch. He played with her nipples shifting from one to another never once ignoring one for the other for too long. A small nip on the left while gently squeezing on the right brought out a gasp from her and thrilled him further.</p><p>Soon he was too eager to get going further south and reach more exciting parts of her delicious body. Giving her breasts one last kiss and a gentle squeeze, he drifted further down until he reached the part he was anticipating the most. He laid a gentle trail of pecks on her stomach, dipping a tongue into her belly button to tease her as he passed down making her squirm a bit and a light husky giggle escaped her lips making him smile.</p><p>When they first started getting more intimate than snogging, Harry had really wanted to go down on her more than anything. To be able to make her moan and scream in pleasure all because of him was one of his biggest turn ons. It had been like an obsession for him. In his mind, she was doing him a favour by going out with him and he really wanted to show his appreciation. He was of course an eager and horny teenager and had no clue what he was doing.</p><p>With Ginny’s careful guidance on how to pleasure her the best and his instinctual learning, by the time he was done with her that first time, he left no doubt in Ginny’s mind that he loved it very much. He actually loved going down on her as much as she loved going down on him.</p><p>By now, going down on her was probably his favourite thing to do with Ginny besides being deep inside her of course. He knew he was going to enjoy this very much and he was not going to stop until she was fully lost in the haze of lust and pleasure. He lightly blew on the small patch of hair just above her slit and the way Ginny moved told him that she was trying very hard not to move her hands. He slowly drifted down kissing the soft skin along the way until he was facing her pussy, puffed and a hint of wetness from her arousal.</p><p>He took a deep breath taking in the scent that is all Ginny, feeling the heady rush of arousal and let out a low groan of pleasure. He lightly caressed her thighs as he kissed downed narrowly skipping where he knew she wanted him the most. A little nip on her thigh, a lick just below the slit and a caress on the slit made her shiver in pleasure.</p><p>‘<em>Harry</em>’, she moaned in a way that made thinking very hard for him with all the blood rushing down.</p><p>By now he could hear her panting and knew she was as aroused as he was, if not more, and he very close to exploding. Deciding that he had teased her enough, he went for her pussy. She was wet by now, positively soaking with arousal. He gave a broad lick across the folds and the resulting groan of ecstatic pleasure from Ginny nearly made him come on the spot.</p><p>She was shaking and both her fists clenching the sheets like she was very close to grabbing his head pushing him where she wants him. His finger quickly found the nub and started gently rubbing it as his tongue entered her pussy for the first time. She was close with all the teasing he had done so far, just needed a little push to tip over the edge.</p><p>He was licking and nipping gently as he rubbed her clit. It was time to up the pleasure and shifted the position. He started gently nibbling on her clit as he slowly inserted his finger to feel the tight walls fluttering around his finger in the sweet delicious pleasure. They both groaned in pleasure of him finally entering her. A little more suck and swirls of his finger and she screamed in ecstasy as she came hard around his finger.</p><p>He kept up the attack as he nipped, licked and sucked on her nub as his finger went in and out of her slit. He gave her no time to come down she was moaning and groaning in the overwhelming pleasure and in no time she was coming again with a delighted cry of euphoria. Her fingers found his hair as she held his head and pulled him closer. So delighted was he that he made the one mistake he wanted to avoid. The joy of making her come made him want to look at her as she came.</p><p>He always loved making her come. The way her eyes fluttered as she was getting close, her swollen lips parted slightly as she moaned in pleasure that he gave her, her cheeks flushed and hair just wildly spread all around them bringing him the flowery smell and some unique fragrance that was all Ginny, the hypnotic way where breasts swayed with each panting breath she took, the way she said his name in a silent intense whisper, it was all simply the most amazing and erotic thing he had ever seen and could never get enough of. Before he realized what a mistake that was, he looked up and stared into her eyes and that was it.</p><p>Hot, sweating, panting and oh so deliciously nude. Her beautiful hair was slick with sweat sticking to her skin and falling down her shoulders like a crimson waterfall with stray strands across her face oh so temptingly. Her breasts were heaving with every hard breath. And her eyes. The molten chocolate was burning with passionate lust piercing his very soul. If it was only the look, he could still have brought himself into some control though he doubted that very much. With dilated and half lidded pupils, when her pink lips slightly swollen parted in a silent but intense whisper, '<strong>Fuck. Me. Now.</strong>', that was all it took for him.</p><p>It was no longer his show. He was a slave to her every whim. At this point his lust and arousal were at the state where he no longer saw anything but naked sexy Ginny asking him to fuck her and, Merlin forbid, he was going to fuck her and no one was going to stop him. He had been holding himself back for too long but not anymore. She wanted him hard and fast, and he was going to give her exactly what she wanted.</p><p>He wriggled his way up kissing along the way but Ginny had enough of his teasing. She pulled him with her hands still in his hair, ‘I said right NOW’. He lined himself and in one long smooth stroke he was all the way in her with a groan as he heard her mewl of pleasure at his penetration. Her hands wrapped around his neck as her fingers sifted through his hair again before she fisted his locks pulling his head in closer for a heated kiss. He pulled back until only his tip was in and pushed back hard. He felt her velvet walls pulsating around his cock as her legs wrapped around him urging him to go faster.</p><p>“Merlin, Gin! You are so… God... tight… So nice...  I am soo close,” he moaned as he continued pushing in and out of her in long hard strokes.</p><p>“Me too, love. Almost there. Don’t stop.”</p><p>One of her hands drifted between them as she started rubbing her clit as much as she could while the other pulled him closer. The way she was pleasuring herself was too much for him. He gave a strangled groan into her neck as he held her tighter to his body. He bit on her neck as he came hard, the pleasure overwhelming his mind. He vaguely heard Ginny scream in rapture as she tightened her legs around him, her quivering walls adding to his pleasure.</p><p>After a long time as they caught their breaths, he felt Ginny lighted nudge him aside as he got heavier on her. He clumsily lifted himself off her and rolled onto his back besides her panting with exhaustion.</p><p>“That was a nice way to wake up.” Ginny whispered, a wide satisfied smile covering her face.</p><p>“You are too hot, Gin. I just couldn't help myself,'' Harry replied as he grinned at her.</p><p>“Not complaining, in fact you should do that more often,” Ginny responded with a smirk as she lifted herself up and climbed out of the bed.</p><p>Her hips swayed hypnotically as she walked towards the bathroom and his eyes drifted down to her lovely bottom.  He looked up when she stopped at the threshold to see her smirking at him over her shoulder and grinned back at her unabashedly. She shook her head in amusement as she walked into the bathroom. He looked up at the ceiling and was happy to realize that this was the life he had always dreamed of.</p><p>
  <em>Yes, I should do that more often, indeed.</em>
