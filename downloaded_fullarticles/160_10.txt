    <p>Harry Potter clutched his school bag, adorned with a plethora of gay pins he ordered off Amazon (featuring brilliant slogans such as ‘gay and angry’ and, his favorite, ‘teenage lesbian’) and stood at the platform of 9 ¾ King’s Cross Station, gazing upon the Hogwarts Express. This is it. No longer did he have to live closeted (literally) with the Catholic gremlins known as the Dursleys—who, Harry thought, for a family that preached the importance of household love and harmony, surprisingly loved their child abuse—and could finally live out and proud. After sacrificing his Tumblr blog in middle school in order to focus on his studies, Harry managed to get a scholarship to the prestigious Hogwarts boarding school, marking the beginning of a Dursley-free lifestyle. 15 years old and unapologetically gay, Harry Potter was ready to live out the queer high school life of his dreams.</p><p>---</p><p>Harry sat, of course, at the very front of the train. It was important to let his presence be known to everyone who walked in, establishing his place as the alpha lesbian. Hogwarts unfortunately had a dress code consisting of black trousers, a grey cardigan, and a tie, which meant that Harry had to save his gloriously flamboyant fashion for the weekends. However, Harry was sure that the adorable rainbow heart pin he stuck in his hair would be enough to impose his exuberant homosexuality on any and all passerby.</p><p>Harry arrived a bit early, wanting to secure his desired seat on the train, but soon students began filing into the train. He was pleasantly surprised when the first person to sit in his booth was an adorable blonde boy whose entire being screamed ‘posh twink.’ Harry, having made it a goal to become known as a homosexual sex god during high school, was excited at the chance to secure his first conquest via his superior seduction skills. However, just as Harry opened his mouth to woo the boy with his sexy pick-up lines, the blonde twink spoke.</p><p>“Nice pin, faggot,” the boy sneered.</p><p>Oh no! Harry was most certainly not expecting to deal with a homophobe right off the bat. He had certainly known he would come across bumps in his homosexual agenda, but it was a bit disheartening to see it happen so soon. Nonetheless, Harry would not be discouraged. He remembered the WikiHow articles he had bookmarked on what to do when encountering douches: stay calm and don’t antagonize them. Harry took a deep breath in and stayed rational.</p><p>“You know, for someone who copied Ellen DeGeneres’s hairstyle, you sure are surprisingly homophobic.”</p><p>Hell yeah, a witty comeback! Harry mentally high-fived himself inside his head. He glanced at the boy, who was clearly attempting to look intimidating by raising a sassy eyebrow, and noticed that he looked quite cute when blushing, even when out of anger. Before the boy could get out what was no doubt another ridiculously offensive remark, Harry put his hand up and shushed him.</p><p>“Stop! Don’t say anything. I’m moving booths.” Harry got up, slamming his palms on the table in front of him, and started looking for another seat. He would let the blonde prick stew in his embarrassment at having a dubiously lesbian looking haircut and wouldn’t grant him the satisfaction of thinking of a comeback. While most of the train was already moderately filled up, he spotted a girl sitting alone at the very back, immersed in a book. Harry quickly made his way over to her and plopped down across from her seat, placing his bag under the table.</p><p>“Hello! What are you reading?” Harry, having interacted with plenty of bookworms during his Tumblr days, knew that the way to this girl’s heart was through copious amounts of literary discussions.</p><p>“Oh, hello!” the girl, who seemed pleasantly shocked by Harry’s emergence, finally looked up from her book. “I’m reading a Russian novel, The Brothers Karamazov. It was Dostoyevsky’s final novel, you see.”</p><p>“Brilliant. Did you know I’m gay?” Shit, Harry thought, was that too blunt? Maybe he should have talked a bit more about books first. To be perfectly honest, he couldn’t care less about Dostoyevsky, but he could certainly try.</p><p>“Oh,” the girl’s eyebrows furrowed. “That’s good! I’m straight myself, but I was a proud member of the GSA club at my old school. I’m very much a believer of the gay rights movement.” The girl gave Harry a small, shy smile.</p><p>Harry beamed. Day one and he had already secured what he knew would be his best friend for the years to come.</p>
