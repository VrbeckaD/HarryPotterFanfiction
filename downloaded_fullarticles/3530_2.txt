    <p>Harry gazed into the flames of the crackling fireplace, eyes unfocused and unseeing. The sound of laughter, scuffling and loud conversation could be heard down the hall, echoing until it reached him. The sounds were music to his ears, the sound of life and the sound of his family. </p><p><em>'My family.' </em>Harry thought, looking down again at the moving photograph in his hands. Taken not even 15 minutes ago, the happiness he felt was still fresh. He was sure it would never fade away, and every time he looked at the photograph he could remind himself of what he has.</p><p>The photo was of his friends, a family now, the ones alive that is. Hermione, Ron, Neville, Sirius, Remus, Teddy, the rest of the Weasleys, Draco...</p><p>"Harry?" Draco called, dragging Harry from his musings. "Hermione asked me to come to get you, Teddy's ready for some cake."</p><p>Harry chuckled. "That kid and his sweets. Just like Tonks."</p><p>"What are you doing?" Draco asked, sitting in the armchair across from Harry despite saying he should get up.</p><p>"Just thinking, about all of this." Harry waved his hand to gesture around the room. "Despite all the losses, my family, and in the war, I still ended up with a new family. I never thought I could be this happy. My whole life I was sort of empty, the Dursley's helped. But now..." He trailed off.</p><p>Draco offered him a small smile. "I understand. You know, I never thought I could have a family like this either. At home life was always so dull? Mother tried and she truly cared but my father had an effect on both of us, I can understand her side. Father... he was cold and distant. Even if he truly cared for me, he didn't know how to be a father."</p><p>Harry didn't look grim as he would have in the past, he knew most of Draco's childhood. The past was the past, they couldn't change it and what mattered was that they had a family now, they had a great future. He could only beam at the blonde boy, that same happiness overwhelming him again. He was finally happy and content.</p><p>"I'm glad we became friends, Draco, I shudder to think of my life where we never friends." </p><p>Draco laughed slightly, shaking his head. "Probably more headaches, more dumb decisions, I could go on."</p><p>"Right you are." Harry cast one last glance at the photograph before slipping it back in his pocket with the rest. "I guess we should get back."</p><p>Draco stood up after him, wrapping an arm around his shoulders. "Hey, I need to ask you-" Harry didn't hear the rest of the question because Draco's voice was drowned out and a silence overtook the room.</p><p>The silence was deafening, he could hear his heartbeat echoing and an unnatural cold was seeping into his bones. Draco seemed frozen in time, mouth still opened in a drawl and gaze piercing. Harry felt himself shivering, the cold only getting worse, his breath was now visible. The cold was familiar yet distant so familiar he almost thought a dementor had somehow ventured in but he knew that wasn't it.</p><p>This cold was different, maybe not as hopeless. It felt like a natural cold but at the same time it didn't and it boggled Harry's mind. The room was so silent that his own breathing sounded blaring, clouds of cold air hitting Draco. Harry hadn't moved yet, still stuck under the weight of Draco's frozen arm and wondering what the hell was going on.</p><p>Harry was so distracted that he didn't notice the ever-growing mass in the corner of the room. Darkness spread and spread until it was the size of a large boulder, the sound is what finally drew the boy's attention. It made a sucking noise, breaking the silence, and Harry finally looked towards the mass. </p><p>There was a thunderous boom and Harry felt himself falling into darkness, the silence and cold overwhelming and overtaking his every sense. He hadn't realized how warm Draco's body was until he was gone from his side. Harry couldn't tell the difference between up and down or left and right, only dark empty space. </p><p>After what felt like years he was blinded by a bright light, which felt foreign to his eyes. Noises and colors flooded his senses and had him almost missing the darkness. He didn't know what the sounds were or where the colors and light came from, all he knew was that he felt himself getting very light headed.</p><p>And suddenly, along with the barrage of his sense coming back intact, he slammed into the ground hard. Pain flooded through his body and his back felt on fire. The voices echoing in his head didn't help at all and before he knew it he found himself slipping into unconsciousness. </p><p>-</p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em> <u>James</u> </em> </strong>
</p><p><u></u><u></u>"Harry," James said quietly and his son tensed, slowly turning to face his father. "What do you think you're doing?"</p><p>Harry had the nerve to look sheepish. "Just getting a glass of water, dad." He answered and rubbed the back of his neck.</p><p>"Oh really?" Harry nodded. "So you just sleep in your Quidditch uniform every night now?"</p><p>"Oh that. I can explain." His son chuckled nervously, eyes flickering to the doorway. </p><p>James raised an eyebrow. "Go on then." He leaned forward in expectation.</p><p>"I'll just go back to bed," Harry said finally, pointing towards the exit of the kitchen.</p><p>"Excellent idea son," James responded evenly and gave him a stern look.</p><p>Harry headed towards the door before stopping when James called him again. "Oh and Harry?"</p><p>"Yes, dad?"</p><p>"No Quidditch for a week." Harry winced but nodded and headed back upstairs, head hung in shame.</p><p>James sighed and dropped his head on the dining table, the thud echoing throughout the otherwise silent kitchen. He was sitting and waiting for Sirius and Remus, who had just gotten back from a mission and said they were on the way over now. </p><p>Out the corner of his eye, his saw a flash and heard a thud come from the living room. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion, had they decided to use the floo instead? They didn't usually do that without telling James beforehand, in case it was blocked off.</p><p>That thought went out of his mind as soon as he heard his wife scream his name and set into action immediately. When he went through the doorway he saw his wife standing in the middle of the living room, book forgotten in her chair and her wand out. She had it pointed at someone collapsed on the floor, body bent at an odd angle and face down so his face wasn't visible.</p><p>"What happened?" James questioned, bringing his wand out in case of danger.</p><p>"I-I don't know, I was reading when suddenly I couldn't see! This light blinded me and I heard a thud and saw him." Lily answered hysteria heard clearly in her voice.</p><p>James looked at the stranger again and quickly realized he could wake up at any moment and possibly attack them. "<em>Stupefy.</em>" The stunning spell hit the target straight in the back and caused both Lily and James to relax slightly.</p><p>"What do we do?" Lily asked.</p><p>James pressed his lips together. "Remus and Sirius are on their way, we'll have them help us." He paused. "We'll hold him in one of the guest rooms, put some protective spells up and call Dumbledore in the morning."</p><p>"Hold him?" Lily grimaced. "Like hold him hostage?"</p><p>"He could be a death eater for all we know." James whisper yelled, careful not to wake their son.</p><p>Lily huffed, faced slightly red and arms crossed. "I <em>know </em>that! But what if he's not? And we're just holding some random man hostage?"</p><p>"We'll deal with that when we cross that bridge," James said, ignoring Lily's glare and turning towards the kitchen when he heard a light knock. "Watch him."</p><p>Lily's glare followed him into the kitchen but he paid it no mind, instead opening the back door quickly and pointing his wand at Remus and Sirius. The two didn't seem surprised or offended about this and offered a large grin. "Security question?"</p><p>"What is my animagus form?" James asked quickly. "A stag." They both answered easily, looking around for listeners.</p><p>"What is mine?" Remus asked. "Trick question, you don't have one." Both Sirius and James said at the same time and Remus gave them an exasperated look. "Seriously, that's so creepy."</p><p>James shook his head. "Come on, I need your help." </p><p>His friends rushed inside, silently closing and warding the back door before making themselves into the living room again. Lily has sat in her armchair again, her wand in her hand and an almost bored look on her face. When they entered she quickly stood again and offered Sirius and Remus a small hug before turning back to the elephant in the room</p><p>"Uh, you realize you have a passed out man on your floor right?" Sirius finally said, pointing to said man.</p><p>Remus jabbed him in the ribs. "I think that's what James needs help with, idiot."</p><p>Sirius rubbed his side and muttered under his breath something about bullying and mean werewolves. Remus rolled his eyes and turned his attention to James again. "What happened?"</p><p>"He just showed up, with nothing but a bright light and a thud," Lily answered instead and Remus furrowed his brows in confusion.</p><p>"Do you know who he is?" Sirius asked and both Potter's shook their heads no. "Did you even turn him over to see what he looks like?"</p><p>James shook his head again. "He arrived quite literally right before you got here." </p><p>"Let's see." Remus squatted down and reached over, pushing the man on his back. Remus stared for a moment, shock making him freeze in his place. It was Harry. But it wasn't.</p><p>"What the fuck?" Sirius breathed out and Lily was so in shock that she didn't bother to reprimand him for his language.</p><p>James was the first one to break out of it and he didn't even comment on the man looking like an older version of his son. "What's that in his pocket?"</p><p>"Huh?" Remus looked at the man again and saw something sticking out of his breast pocket, so he pulled it out. It was a series of photographs, fairly recent by the looks of them. </p><p>"What is it?" Lily asked. Remus had forgotten she was even there.</p><p>Remus looked at the top photo and frowned. "Pictures. Looks like a birthday party." No one said anything as Remus looked at the next one in the stack.</p><p>"Who's in them?" Sirius piped up, curiosity getting the best of it.</p><p>"It's... it's me, you and him." He answered and offered the photo to his friend. Sirius stared at it in shock and flipped it over. "Sirius, Remus and I at Teddy's 3rd birthday party." He read.</p><p>James narrowed his eyes and gestured for the stack of photos, Remus gave them to him without a word. The room was silent as James looked through more of the photos, pausing on some longer than others before he froze in shock. He flipped the photo over to see it also has been written on the back.</p><p>"Me, Hermione, Ron, and Draco - April '01!" James read, his mind running a thousand miles a minute. </p><p>"Draco Malfoy?" Sirius finally asked and everyone turned to glare at him. "What other Draco's do you know with blonde hair?" James responded, annoyed.</p><p>Sirius huffed and crossed his arms, looking away from his best friend. "No need to be so rude about it."</p><p>"Let's just," Lily stepped in before James could snap a retort. "Get him to the spare bedroom and get some rest. We can all figure this out in the morning when he's awake."</p><p>"Lily's right, James. We all need some sleep."</p><p>James quickly but begrudgingly agreed and used his wand to levitate and guide the stranger to a spare bedroom right under the staircase. It was dangerously close to too many exits but he didn't feel comfortable with the thought of having him on the same level as his son. </p><p>He not so gently dropped him on the bed and Remus and Lily got to work with wards and alarms while James and Sirius tied him up. After ten minutes the party of four were satisfied with their work and made to leave. They needed all the rest they could get before they would have to deal with the rest of the situation the next morning.</p>
