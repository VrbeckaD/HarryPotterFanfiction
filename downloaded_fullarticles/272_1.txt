          <div class="userstuff"><p>Sirius was laying in the grass, head rested on Remus's stomach as they both looked up through the trees into the vast sky in James's back garden.</p><p>
  <em> <strong>Crack!</strong> </em>
</p><p>"<em>I've got it! I've bloody got it</em>!" James screeched as he landed gracelessly from apparition with Peter stumbling as his side along. He ran over to Sirius and Remus, Pete panting behind him, waving a newly acquired record in his hand like a trophy. The mission into the muggle village had been a successful one and he was so excited about his find. </p><p>"James. Calm the fuck down." Remus said with as little enthusiasm as possible. "It's just <em>ABBA.</em> You have heard these songs already..." he shrugged.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>More silence.</p><p>"Wow...." James stuttered.</p><p>"How can you... Just...<em>Who do you think you are sir</em>?!" Peter demanded.</p><p>"Moony. I <em>can't."</em> Sirius said as he sat up and looked at Remus, in shock. "I may need some time to evaluate the compatibility of this relationship. It's like I don't even know who you are..." he shook his head. </p><p>Remus continued to look up at the tree branches as he flipped them all off with both hands. James just chuckled a little as he held it out to show Sirius. </p><p>"I'll fetch the record player!" Peter said before jogging back toward James's house. </p><p>"When I first heard this song, I thought of Remus" Sirius said, pointing to a title in the track list. </p><p>This got Remus's attention. He sat up and looked to where Sirius was pointing at the track titled <em>"When</em> I <em>Kissed the Teacher".</em> </p><p>"Why?" He asked Sirius with Narrowed eyes and a confused expression. </p><p>"You are <em>obviously</em> the teacher friend Moony" James supplied in an amused tone "And Sirius wanted to kiss you. Pay attention, mate" he laughed with an exasperated sigh. </p><p>Remus just flipped him off again and returned to his laying position, but reached over to squeeze Sirius's hand gently anyway. The contact made Sirius feel the way it always had. Warm and tingly, loved and safe, excited and stimulated. </p><p>He remembers trying to describe it to James, saying it was like taking his freezing cold hands after Quiddich in winter and putting them near a roaring fire in a cozy room. Just a tiny bit of pain as the frost melts away, but feeling like the warmth would last through all the coming cold days. </p><p>James had taken a pen and written it down as he rolled his eyes with a dramatic sigh. "I'm keeping a record of all this shit you say so when Remus comes he can read it." He told Sirius with a smirk.</p><p>Sirius had <em>accio'ed</em> and destroyed the parchment immediately, but he still felt the description had merit. </p><p><br/>When peter returned with the record player and the first song, <em>When</em> I <em>Kissed The Teacher,</em> had finished, Remus pulled Sirius over to him and kissed him full on the mouth. Sirius blushed but stayed in the embrace as Remus began playing gently with his hair.</p><p>"GAAAYYY...." James muttered with a smirk as he glanced fondly at his two friends in love.</p><p>Both Remus and Sirius flipped him off without breaking eye contact with each other as <em>Dancing Queen</em> started to play. </p><p>"Mary loves this one" Peter said as he laid down on his back, hands behind his head. "I like it too. It reminds me of her." </p><p>"Yea" James said dreamily as he stared off into the forest in the distance. "Lily too" he added as he began to hum along, badly. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"This next year is going to be the best year." Sirius said after a long stretch. </p><p>"You say that literally every summer Pads" Pete chuckled. </p><p>"Every year he's right though" Remus cut in "each year has been better than the last." </p><p>"It really has..." James said as he laid his head on Sirius legs. Peter moved to lay down next to Remus, all 4 friends lost in their own great memories of the previous years, and their hopes for the coming one.</p><p> </p><p>"I love you guys" Sirius said. </p><p>"Of course you do" Peter said airily.</p><p>"We <em>are</em> incredible" Remus agreed.</p><p>"The best of the best" James declared with a nod.</p><p>"Fuck you all" Sirius laughed. </p><p>"Pass" James and Peter said in unison. </p><p>"Ill take that action" Remus said, setting off a chain reaction of laughter that would end 15 minutes later with sore cheeks and side stitches from the hilarity. </p><p>It was a good summer, Sirius thought. He just wished he could make it last forever. </p></div>
