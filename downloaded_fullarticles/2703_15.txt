    <p>"Moony" the jovial cry rang through the halls. "Did you see Snivellus face. It was hilarious!"</p>
<p>The cheers of joy were met with silence causing Sirius to pause. "Moony?" came the questioning voice, "You alright mate?" he inquired. Again he was met with silence causing a worm of worry to seep it's way into the pit of his stomach. 'maybe," he thought ' he's just in one of his moods.' "Hey, why don't I tell you what happened to Snivellus. That oughta cheer you up." He said trying to cheer his friend. By now Remus was shaking. Getting worried he attempted to ask again.</p>
<p>"Moon-" a fist came flying at him hitting him right in the face. A resounding crack was heard around the room as the noes caved to the force. "Remus what-"</p>
<p>This time he was cut off by Remus' voice. "I'm <em>done</em> Sirius." Remus hissed, "I'm done with how you and James and Peter treat Severus like he's not even a human being. I thought that after the shrieking shack you would have learned your lesson, but..." he faded out with a sigh. "I could have killed him that night. I could have killed him or worse I could have turned him. Did you ever think of how <em><strong>I</strong></em>  would have felt about that. Do you even care that if something worse had happened I don't think I could have lived with myself. I thought after that you would have stopped, that it would be enough and yet you still treat him like this." Sirius was staring at his friend now unable to talk, " I stuck with you because you accepted me. You all seemed to actually care about me, to like me. I let your treatment of others slide because I thought if I said something you would get rid of me. I thought maybe you would learn..." He glared at Sirius, "guess I was wrong. I would rather be alone than continue to stay with you."</p>
<p>With that the Remus turned on his heels and left. leaving a stunned Sirius in his wake. Not looking back.</p>
