    <p>To make a long story short, Ron and Harry have been mutually pining for years. After Ron saw Harry's dead, albeit still alive, body, he regretted never telling him before he lost his chance. Once he saw that Harry was still alive he decided that, if they both made it out alive, he would tell Harry about his feelings no matter what. And that is exactly what he did.</p><p>After Voldemort was killed and the injured were treated in the Great Hall, Ron pulled Harry into an empty bathroom and told him how he felt. This resulted in Harry pulling him into a fervent kiss that said many things to Ron without Harry having to utter a single word. And in that moment Harry decided two things for fact, 1) he was done fighting if it meant staying with Ron like this and 2) he would follow Ronald Weasley anywhere.</p><p>"So, are we?" Ron trailed off, not sure if he could actually say it until he knew Harry was ok with it. Harry only nodded afraid if he spoke some spell would be broken and Ron would reveal it was all some kind of joke.</p><p>"Cool," Ron's face broke into a thousand watt grin and he pulled Harry back into another kiss.</p><p>They stayed in that bathroom for what felt like hours, but was really only ten minutes, leaving with the unspoken agreement that they wouldn't tell anyone about what had transpired, at least not for a while.</p><p>When they returned to Hogwarts for their final year they still had not told anyone.</p>
