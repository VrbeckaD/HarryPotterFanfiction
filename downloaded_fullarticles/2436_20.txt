  <p align="center"><em>Suppose we have only </em>dreamed,<em> or made up, all those things - trees and grass and sun and moon and stars.</em></p>

Lily’s father asked uncertainly, but Mr. Ollivander was staring at Lily with a queer expression on her face.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Your mother, girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What’s her name?"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily blinked. "Mum?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her name’s Susan."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Ah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have your wand, my dear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come, both of you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come into the back."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Confused, father and daughter followed him into a small room that neither was sure had been there before.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">There were fewer wand boxes here, and some seemed to even be sealed up tight with chains.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Mr. Ollivander unlocked a cupboard and removed one in a birch wood box with a strange sort of reverence.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"10 1/4 inches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Willow wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quite swishy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should be excellent for charm work."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily perked up as she removed the lid of the box, but she froze upon doing so.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">She could feel the breeze of summer and smell flowers.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">She looked around quickly, but there was no Lion in sight.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Mr. Ollivander caught her movements with his careful eyes before speaking quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Years ago, a young woman came to my shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had two men with her, brothers, she said, but she forced them to wait outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was closing time, and I was a bit impatient with her, I’m afraid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She simply smiled at me and said she had something for my keeping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The strangest thing was she gave off magic like she breathed it—so did her brothers, when she finally allowed them in, but not nearly as strongly as she did—but she wasn’t a trained witch, despite being of an age where she should have attended Hogwarts and graduated both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t believe she ever had any training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not <em>here</em>, at any rate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And yet, she gave off magic like the sun gives light."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">He took a breath and looked down at the wand before continuing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I was immediately curious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve met many a witch and wizard, and few matched what I felt from her that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever this young woman had to say, whatever her business was with me, I knew I would listen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For that matter, I felt almost compelled to listen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not by a spell, mind you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Compelled by authority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As if I had sworn fealty to her without ever knowing it."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He smiled and looked at Lily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"She was beautiful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, if you had blonde hair, I’d say you were her daughter."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily was frozen for different reasons now as she (and her father) listened to the tale.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Ollivander took a deep breath and removed the wand from the box like it were something holy as well as magical.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"She gave me hair from a lion’s mane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Lion, actually—you could practically hear the capital L when she said it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She said her niece would be here someday, in need of a wand, and I was to make one with this inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I said I’d never heard of a wand like that, and she smiled at me—that smile, again, taking my breath away—and said simply, 'There’s a first time for anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have been charged with seeing this task fulfilled, and now I ask you if you accept this same charge, in the name of the Lion, the Emperor Over the Sea, and the Lion’s Breath that Binds Us All, in the name of the Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time—will you make my niece’s wand?'"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">He shrugged after a moment and smiled a little crookedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I’m an old man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I do believe I fell in love with her that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wouldn’t have refused her anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Making a wand, my specialty—of course I agreed to that."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">He offered Lily the wand then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I believe, my dear, that this belongs to you."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Hesitantly, a little stunned, Lily took it.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Flick.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Swish.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">All three of them startled at the sound of a roar and the wind that blew by with rose and—yes, it was—lily petals appearing from nowhere, whipped around them.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Yes, it seems she was right," Ollivander murmured, studying Lily with twinkling eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You have your wand, Niece of Lucy and Daughter of Susan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Child of the Lion and of Two Worlds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was only one of the tasks I was charged with before the woman and her brothers—the elder was a Muggle, but I believe the younger one could have been a wizard with training, though he wasn’t as strong as his sister—left that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The elder brother made me swear this: that I tell you to come to me every year before the term, and every year after you graduate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be it for tea or for five minutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The younger charged me with ensuring that your wand be kept in that box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had made it himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>'Don’t let her throw it away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s blessed,' he said, though he never quite said by whom—or What—or why it mattered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>'Have her lay her wand in it each night.'"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily nodded slowly, putting the wand back in the box.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Most children don’t want to put their wands back into the box so quickly," Ollivander said with an arched eyebrow.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily hesitated, the words coming to her in a whisper, a kind, woman’s voice speaking to her in her ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It’s…It’s a tool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not a toy."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Both eyebrow on Ollivander’s face went up at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Do you know, that’s exactly what that young woman said about it that night?"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Yes," Lily said after a moment, looking the old man in the eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I do know. Somehow."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"She was right, your aunt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are," and Ollivander reached out his hand to place it on Lily’s head in a gesture that felt like a blessing, "a most special girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just wish I didn’t believe her to be right in everything else she said that night."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"What did she say?" Mr. Evans asked sharply, but Ollivander shook his head.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Nothing I can speak of at all until another year has passed. Even then, I am charged with relaying certain information as fits the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am sorry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your sister-in-law was quite clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are, I assume, the husband of Susan Pevensie?"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Mr. Evans slowly nodded as he looked at his younger daughter before sighing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"She always says her sister was the one closest to Him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now that she’ll talk about it at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know how she’s going to react to knowing Lucy, Peter, and Edmund knew Lily was—good Lord, they knew about Lily before she was even born."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"It was about six months before their deaths."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the startled look that gained Ollivander, he smiled sadly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Lucy made her brothers stay out of the shop because she wished to speak to me in private.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>'He says a time is coming soon when we all are going to His Country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you understand?'<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, I didn’t, and when she explained I admit to being upset.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She only smiled though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>'If they knew, my brothers, they’d react the same way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suppose I could avoid it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m not needed, per se.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one would question it too terribly much if I didn’t go, just think it odd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But how could I let them go alone?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How could I turn my back on Narnia in its time of greatest need?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How could I not be there to stand against Tash and his foul forces?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is gaining strength, Mr. Ollivander, in that world and this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>War is coming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>War is coming in all worlds, though in some Tash goes by different names.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes the Enemy, sometimes the Adversary, sometimes the Crimson King.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His servants are many and all foul in their own ways, and they grow in number.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shall be there to stand against him in one world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My niece will stand tall here against one of his servants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And her son…her son will face so much, but I believe he will stand tall in the end, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both shall face the darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it will comprehend them not, for they carry in them the blood of kings and queens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Lion watches all of his, and they belong to Him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or they will, at any rate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’s spoken of them enough they’re already real and here to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I will be there for both of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if they can’t often see me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is also my charge,'" Ollivander finished quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I didn’t know the names she spoke, but when she spoke of Tash, or his other names, I felt cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she spoke of the Lion, I felt that coldness melt and a strength fill me, felt younger than I have for…oh, such a very long time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I agreed to all she asked, without question."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily stared, eyes wide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I think…I think I heard my aunt just now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s never happened before."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">All three heard a musical laugh, then, before a young woman appeared slowly, golden and gay and smelling like spring and summer and a holiday that never ends.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">She wore a crown in her hair like it was part of her, and Lily noticed that the silver circlet was fashioned of leaves and roses and lilies and, yes, thorns, though<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the latter were placed so as to not cause harm.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"There is, as I have often said, my dear, a first time for everything."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"My lady," Mr. Ollivander said immediately and bowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If he was surprised, he didn’t show it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If anything, there was a look on his face of tenderness instead of shock.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Garrick, I’ve told you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lucy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Simply Lucy," the lady scolded, but Mr. Ollivander smiled and simply shook his head, causing the blonde-haired woman to roll her eyes.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Mr. Evans merely gaped before managing, "Lu?"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Her smile was gentle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Hello, Jack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knew you’d be there for Su.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And not in the way I knew about your daughters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be brave for Lily and be kind for Petunia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know already you’ll always be there for Su.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I think we should keep me a bit of a secret from her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would only upset her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agreed?" and there was just a hint of steel in her voice on the last word.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Mr. Evans nodded immediately.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">So did Lily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I promise…Aunt Lucy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s who you are, isn’t it?"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lucy smiled and bowed her head once in a simple nod.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"The Lion told me about you and Mum and Uncle Peter and Uncle Edmund and cousin Eustace—"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"I’m sure He’s told you many things, my dear," Lucy laughed, and when Lily caught sight of Mr. Ollivander’s face she thought he might still be at least a bit in love with her aunt.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Who was dead.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">That fact seemed to deserve some attention.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Are you a ghost?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve heard there are ghosts at Hogwarts."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"There are some there, yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m not a ghost.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m…more like a guardian," Lucy hedged.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily’s eyes widened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Are you my guardian angel?"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lucy smiled gentle at her niece and gracefully bent over to be on the same level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Lily had not hit her growth spurt yet and was hoping she’d be as tall as her mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeing how tall her aunt always had been—was—she felt it likely.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Many would laugh at hearing me called an angel."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"You jest, my lady," Mr. Ollivander said immediately.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Charmer," Lucy said with a faint smile, and Lily blinked.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">She hoped her aunt wasn’t flirting with Mr. Ollivander.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That would just be…that seemed weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was dead, after all.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Then again, she had the feeling Mr. Ollivander was very, very old, so perhaps it didn’t matter.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Not at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had quite a reputation, especially for my temper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Calormenes called me the Little Hellcat of the North."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily giggled at that, causing Lucy to wink at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It’s a Pevensie trait, I’m afraid, tempers like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We all manage ours in different ways, but we all have a horrible one when we do lose it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That, protecting those in need of it, and standing up for what is right and true. And more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are all different people, of course, but some things are part of the core of all of us. Even if three of us aren’t part of this world any longer."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lucy turned her gaze back to Lily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"And you, my dear, are quite a Pevensie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve seen you inherited the temper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m certain you’ve inherited the rest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, you inherited your hair from your father," and Lucy winked at Jack, "you had to get some things at least as striking from your mum."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Mum’s temper is vicious," Lily confided in a whisper that all in the room heard.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Jack coughed to hide a laugh while Mr. Ollivander covered his mouth to hide a smile.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lucy grinned and whispered back, "I know, and it’s all the worse because you don’t <em>expect</em> it from her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was called The Gentle."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Will you tell me about what Mum was like?" Lily asked urgently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, the Lion had told her things, but this was different.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was family.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lucy’s smile became a bit more serious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I will tell you about her, and I will tell you about the rest of us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will tell you about anything but that which I am forbidden to mention yet."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Forbidden by Him?"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lucy nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Tash is growing strong, as I said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It affects all worlds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d see the Tower fall, but the Lion is strong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some worlds are moving on, as Narnia did," and hearing those worlds made Lily begin to weep for a world she’d never known.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lucy’s arms wrapped around her and held her tightly and Lily mourned the world her mother was only now starting to admit had indeed been real.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Oh, what would Mum say…</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Perhaps it best if Mum never found out about that, either.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"It’s alright to cry, child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It doesn’t make you any less strong or brave.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cry it out," Lucy whispered and Lily did while the two men observed for the first time that Lucy carried a faint golden glow about her.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">They noticed it now because it was growing stronger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily felt warmth and smelled roses and lilies as it did so, even though she hadn’t yet noticed the glow itself due to sobbing with her eyes shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A breath was puffed against her forehead by an unseen presence, soothing her enough her tears began to quiet.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Hush.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The True Narnia lives on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All that was good is there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, Daughter of Eve, dry your eyes," and the words were said gently, yet, nevertheless, they were a command.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily sniffed and wiped her face on the sleeve of her jumper before looking up at her aunt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only now was she noticing that being held by Lucy didn’t feel like being held by anyone else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knew Lucy was touching her, she could feel warmth and reassurance and comfort, but it wasn’t the same as being touched by someone who was alive and flesh and blood and bone.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"What are you, if you’re not a ghost or a guardian angel?" Lily finally asked softly, not letting her aunt go.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lucy held her niece’s eyes as she answered, and there was almost a chime to her voice, a rhythm like she was reciting a poem, as she spoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I’m a Daughter of Eve, Queen Lucy the Valiant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Queen of Narnia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Empress of the Lone Isles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sister to the High King, Peter the Magnificent, to King Edmund the Just, and to the Last of the Great Kings and Queens of Old, Queen Susan the Gentle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aunt of two Daughters of Eve and Princesses," and at those words Lucy cupped her niece’s cheek and warmth filled Lilly from her forehead to her toes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I’m not a ghost nor a guardian angel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I <em>am</em> a guardian, still.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am also an enemy of Tash and all who serve him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot fight the war coming in this world, child, but I will be there for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Think of me as a visitor, if it helps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ll soon see ghosts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They look quite different from me, poor souls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Lion will see them home, though, in the end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even they have roles to play.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be kind to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, Mr. Ollivander and I must talk before I return home. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You and your father have more shopping to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, however," Lucy bent and kissed Lily’s forehead, leaving a tingle behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I never went to Hogwarts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When my letter arrived, I burned it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had rather a poor impression on witches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Edmund had done the same the year before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I’ve spent more years than most could guess around magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I lived and breathed it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I even cast and broke some spells one my last trip to Narnia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I regretted, a bit, having burnt the letter when I came back, after that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps I’d have been able to hold onto a bit more of Narnia if I’d attended Hogwarts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps your mother would never have denied Narnia when faced with the reality of Magic…but if that had been, I’d not have been there <em>for</em> the last visit to Narnia, which I’d trade for nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And perhaps your mother would have been with us on the train—and I’d cut off my hand before wishing that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For Susan’s sake, and for the sake of you two girls."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"You were a witch," Lily breathed, eyes wide.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"An untrained one," Lucy said carefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"But as I said, I lived and breathed magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My kiss is my blessing to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some may notice my mark on you, but you’re not to tell them where you gained it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can’t protect you from anything that’s coming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I can help prepare you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if you’re in desperate need, I’ll be there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If for nothing else than to hold your hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Though I don’t promise anyone else will ever see me," and Lucy’s eyes were laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I’ll be at Hogwarts with you, but not in the castle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll be in the Forbidden Forest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come once a week."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"My lady," Ollivander interrupted with a frown, "the Forbidden Forest—"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"She’ll be safe, Garrick, I promise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She may need to do a bit of sneaking, but she’s being watched over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She won’t be caught, and if she is…well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll take care of it," and when Lucy smiled at Ollivander so gently his frown smoothed away, being replaced with a small, slightly reluctant smile instead.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily was quickly realizing that even if she had been a(n untrained) witch and did cast spells, Lucy had a magic all her own that was simply part of who she was.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily wanted to be like her.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Off, the both of you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Garrick, we must talk," and Lily reluctantly pulled away.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Her father suddenly darted in, though, and pulled Lucy into a tight hug, and Lily noticed for the first time that there were tear strains on his face.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"I missed you, Lucy Pevensie," he said roughly, and Lucy closer her eyes and held him close.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"And I you, Jack Evans."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"If I can get Su to come shopping next year…"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lucy was silent for several seconds before sighing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I already planned to be here that day each year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If Susan is here, I’ll be here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s up to her if she can see me."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Good enough," Jack Evans said roughly before clearing his throat and letting his sister-in-law go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I owe you a dance from the wedding."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Next year, I’ll have Garrick have music ready," Lucy smiled, and Jack managed to smile back before taking Lily’s hand.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">The two of them began to leave before Ollivander called out from where he was fiddling with a tea tray, "Young lady, one last thing."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Lily stopped walking and looked behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Yes?"</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"Your wand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has a name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Valiant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I expect I’ll see you live up to that name as well."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">"You will," Lily promised Ollivander, and her aunt, and the Lion.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Right before the door shut behind them, though, she heard Lucy say softly, "We will indeed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remember to be gentle as well, child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially with your sister and mother."</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">The door shut with a click, and Lily shivered, finding the room away from her aunt to feel almost cold after the warmth her presence brought.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Her father was wiping his face briefly, and Lily considered her aunt’s words as he did so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of them, but especially the last bit.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Being both valiant and gentle—she could do that.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">She would.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">That decided, Lily Evans and her father continued shopping for her first year at Hogwarts.</p>
