Lord Voldemort stand before Lily “Stand aside, silly girl … stand aside, now …”<br/>
“Not my babies, please no, take me, kill me instead -” she was shielding the cot in which she had placed Harry and Jasmin with her body.<br/>
“This is my last warning - “<br/>
“Not my babies! Please … have mercy … have mercy … Not my babies! Not my babies! Please – I’ll do anything – “<br/>
“Stand aside – stand aside, girl –“<br/>
Lily refused to leave her children, the green light struck her in the chest. Voldemort stepped over her body closer to the two children in the cot.<br/>
“Avada Kedavra.”<br/>
A golden sheen surrounded the twins, magic was swirling in the air. The spell rebounded to the caster, ripping him from his body. The golden barrier vanished and the magic in the air was settling down. Harry was crying, blood was dripping from a lightning bold shaped cut in his forehead. He was alone, the place where Jasmin sat seconds before was still warm, she was nowhere to be found.<br/>

The little girl was standing at a crossroad in the middle of London, it was a cold morning, rain and snow took turns, only dressed in a romper suit looking lost and abandoned. Suddenly a door opened behind her, an elderly couple walked out of the house.<br/>
“Well hello sweetheart, are you alone? Where are mommy and daddy?”<br/>

<em>Dear Potions Master Snape</em><br/>
<em>My wife and I are desperate, our daughter, Reena, is suffering since several months from an illness. The healers identified it as Mullbert’s disease, an autoimmune disease, her body is rejecting her own magic. As it is such a rare illness it is fortunate that a cure exists, unfortunately this potion seems to be exceptionally difficult to brew. We already contacted every notable potions master, all of them declined due to the severity of the potion. I recently came across an article proclaiming you as the youngest potions master in history. You are Reena’s last chance of recovery, she grows weaker from day to day, the healers only give her another month. We are currently resident in London and would of course provide you with accommodation and cover all of your expenses.  As our daughter is treated at St. Mungo’s, the laboratories are at your disposal. Should you accept, your work would be remunerated accordingly.</em><br/>
<em>I appeal to you, please think about it. Time is of the essence.</em><br/>
<em>Sincerely</em><br/>
<em>Norbert Michelson</em><br/>

Severus Snape studied the letter in his hand, frowning. While Albus spoke for him in front of the court, most people still saw him as a Death Eater. If they were willing to trust him with the live of their daughter they were indeed desperate. Determined he left his chambers and climbed the stairs to the Headmasters office.<br/>
</p><p>
“Come in Severus.” He hadn’t even knocked yet, it annoyed him to no end that he still hadn’t figured out how Albus did that.<br/>
“What can I do for you my boy? May I offer you tea or a Lemon Drop?” With twinkling eyes Albus gestured him to sit down.<br/>
“No thank you, headmaster. I received this letter today, with your permission I would like to try to help. I have read about the potion, it may be difficult but it takes only a week to brew. I could assign essays and research projects to the students.” He handed the letter to Dumbledore. The twinkling dimed while reading.<br/>
“Oh my, Severus of course you have my permission. Should it take longer than a week I will personally fill in for you. I am most confident in your abilities, but don’t rush it, take all the time you need.”<br/>
“Thank you, Albus. I will depart immediately.” With billowing robes Severus Snape left the office.</p>
