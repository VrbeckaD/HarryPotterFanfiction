"It's been a while since your last visit, Mina. What's wrong?"</p><p>Professor Grubbly-Plank smiled. "I can't believe you noticed, you really are as wise as they say."</p><p>Errol smirked. "Did you ever believe that I wasn't?"</p><p>Professor Grubbly-Plank reassured him, "No, my dear."</p><p>Errol asked, "So, what's wrong?"</p><p>Professor Grubbly-Plank explained, "All of the students and Professors think our relationship is disturbing."</p><p>Errol told her, "Ignore them, they're just jealous."</p><p>Professor Grubbly-Plank sighed. "Maybe, but I'm fed up of everybody thinking a human can't date an owl."</p><p>Errol grinned. "You can do whatever the hell you want, Mina."</p><p>Professor Grubbly-Plank beamed, "Yeah, you're right.
