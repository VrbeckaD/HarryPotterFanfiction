          <div class="userstuff"><p>As Harry gets up to get ready for his class, he is sluggish and achy all over. He hears a few snickers behind him. He turned to glare at his friends.</p><p>“Another long night with Malfoy,” Dean says with a knowing smirk and a wink.</p><p>“What is it, every day this week?” Seamus looks to Dean for the answer</p><p>“No, it every day this month, maybe last month too.” Dean smiles. “Remember when we started dating were sneaking around for how long before we got caught?”</p><p>“HOLY SHIT HARRY, ARE YOU DATING MALFOY???” Ron screamed while grabbing Harry by the shoulders. Dean and Seamus leave the room laughing at Ron’s distress.</p><p>“Of course I’m not ‘Dating’ him. We have sex once in awhile, that's all.” Was Harry’s response as he sat down with a small wince.</p><p>“You’ve been back to the dorms late every night for at least the last month,” Ron says as he paces the room.</p><p>“Fine, we have a lot of sex. That’s still not dating.” Ron stops to look at Harry as he answers.</p><p>“Okay so...Just sex?”</p><p>“I mean we talk too sometimes. He's surprisingly funny you know.” Harry looks at Ron with a goofy smile on his face. Ron sits down on the floor where he stood and just looks at Harry with disbelief. “We do study together and play a bit of Quidditch when he has time. Did I tell you he even invited me to stay with him over the holidays so we can play Quidditch together at the Manor!”</p><p>“And you aren’t”</p><p>“Dating? No, Ron, we aren’t we...” they stare at each other for a moment. Ron sees the look on Harry’s face he’s seen one too many times. The look of realizing something he should have already known.</p><p>“OH MY GOD I’M DATING MALFOY.” Before Ron could respond Harry was running out the door, in his pyjamas and no shoes.</p><p>“I don’t know why everyone thinks I'm the dim one,” Ron mutters to himself as he goes to find Hermione and try to forget.</p><p>-{}- -{}- -{}- -{}- -{}- -{}- -{}- -{}-<br/> Harry runs down to the dungeons and knocks on the door to the Slytherin dorms. A redheaded girl answers the door and before Harry can say a word she is yelling for Draco. When Draco sees him he is shaking his head.</p><p>“Could you have at least tried to look like a decent human being before banging on the door.”</p><p>“Yeah, sorry, I um...” he looked around to see if they were alone. “We’re dating?”</p><p>“Seriously? What do you think we’ve been doing the last couple of months?”</p><p>“I... um...Well, you see...”</p><p>“Great, my boyfriend doesn’t know he’s my boyfriend.” Draco turned to walk away.</p><p>“WAIT” Draco stopped and looked at him. He tried to hide the hurt but Harry saw it. “I’m sorry. I didn’t realize it. It happens sometimes, I don’t see things that are right there. I like that you and I are dating. I’ve wanted that for a while but was scared you didn’t want it.” He pulled Draco to him. A placed a small kiss on his lips then hugged him tightly.</p><p>“Love you” he mutters and Draco stiffens. “Please pretend I didn't say that.”</p><p>“Idiot” Draco said as he kissed his boyfriend.</p></div>
