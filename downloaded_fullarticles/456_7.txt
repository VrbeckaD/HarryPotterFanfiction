  <em> The last Black will be born to a Muggleborn witch and Orion's star on the Winter Solstice after the Dark Lord's defeat, and new age will begin.  </em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Narcissa Malfoy was unaccountably nervous. She studied her impeccable reflection once more in the mirror.</p><p>It wasn't easy, what she prepared to do. It might be the end of the Malfoys, although that was unlikely. It was something she had been preparing herself to do since she was a child. </p><p>Narcissa went down the stairs to the rooms. Bellatrix Black, first lieutenant of the Dark Lord in question, rated her own rooms in her sister's home. When the Mudblood was apprehended Bella had instantly snatched her up and kept her in those private rooms. She'd tortured her - the cries echoed down the hallways - and then lower cries had echoed, and Narcissa had known what they meant. </p><p>Bellatrix was gone on a mission now, as were most of the rest of the Death Eaters. Narcissa found the Mudblood bound in the bed, naked. She unbound her and clothed her with a wandless incantation, which she'd needed to learn as Lucius tended to fall asleep quickly. </p><p>She let the Mudblood take a seat across from her. The fireplace crackled merrily. The Mudblood cinched the front of its robe with one hand, wary, clearly attempting to collect its shreds of dignity. Its knees pressed together in some simulacrum of innocence. </p><p>"You might be wondering why I am setting you free," Narcissa murmured. She placed an unclaimed wand within reaching distance of the Mudblood, and saw it look hungrily at the thing. It was on the table between them, a forbidden gift.</p><p>How long had the Mudblood been here? Three, maybe four weeks? She had no concern for its sanity, not when her own sister had been held in Azkaban for fourteen years. Bellatrix, despite her unique charms, was no dementor.</p><p>"You are Hermione Granger," Naricssa said.</p><p>"I am," the Mudblood said, its chin forward. It did not know what had already happened to it. That made Narcissa's mission somehow sadder. </p><p>"You are unwillingly here. But, you see - you are of paramount importance to us. You are - you are the last hope for continuing the lineage of the Blacks."</p><p>The Mudblood looked to the side, staring at the wand. Naricssa had very little time to waste, but she had to extract a promise. "Come, girl," she hissed. "Surely you know what happened with Bella when she took you."</p><p>The Mudblood closed her eyes, looked down. </p><p>"She would keep you here forever. She has begun to enjoy you, and I imagine that you may have begun to enjoy her, too. But this is no environment for - for what you are destined to do. I won't allow it.</p><p>"There is a small wintering cabin in the mountains. It is ours, mine and Lucius'. I have visited several times to ensure that there are sufficient supplies. I will take you there, and you can wait out the nine months and then do what you will with the rest of your life. Or you may leave the cabin if you choose; I am not your mistress. You may leave the baby in the cabin for me, or take it with you.</p><p>"Just one thing I must hear, because there is nothing in the world that could stop you from -" A pause. "You must carry the baby to term. In exchange for the freedom I am offering you. Please."</p><p>Granger’s eyes had become successively wider, and her hand rested on her belly. She breathed deeply, and Narcissa was impatient. </p><p>"Please promise me that."</p><p>"Bellatrix," the Mudblood said instead. "She - when did she become how she is? Is there a cure?" Damned if it wasn't love, the shine in the Mudblood's eyes. Narcissa relaxed slightly. Her expression was not one of horror. If the Mudblood loved Bella, she should be far more receptive to what Narcissa was asking her to do.</p><p>"I was six years old when I found my sister badly beaten on the stairs. Andy and I brought her to her room and barricaded our father out. The prophecy had been spoken that day, and Bellatrix told it to us when she was well enough to speak. It would change everything - she was already engaged, but from that moment our father considered her a blood traitor and the engagement was broken. She joined the Dark Lord out of desperation. </p><p>"We know that he will fall. We are turning on him now. You shall find that we are invaluable allies, I think.</p><p>"But your question. Bellatrix has always been something greater than the rest of us. She had been brilliant but unstable. She is naturally intimidating, but has always had a short attention span and a very quick temper. The Dark Lord and Azkaban… were not beneficial in shaping her personality. </p><p>"You see, Miss Granger -" it took an effort, but it was needed, "- She was so desperate to revive him when he fell the last time because of you. Because she hadn't found her Mudblood, the Mudblood from the prophecy, and so it was too early for the Dark Lord to be slain. Her entire existence has revolved around this moment."</p><p>"She will not like that I've gone," Granger said, as if realizing it herself. </p><p>"It will incense her," Narcissa said. "But it is too important that you are safe. As long as the Dark Lord lives -"</p><p>Granger interrupted her. "You are turning on him. If you help Harry beat him, can we all - will it -" Her hand clenched upon her stomach, and Narcissa felt a stab of pity. She was so young. </p><p>"I do not know what will happen," she told her gently. </p><p>"I will rejoin Harry. We are so close."</p><p>"Be careful. Do not duel unless you must." Narcissa felt the bizarre urge to give the Mudblood a hug, but she resisted it. She let the girl take the wand, and then she brought her to the cabin and left her there. </p><p>She thought of all the things she could have told Granger, but didn’t. <em> She was as unwilling as you. </em> Although that might not have been entirely true in the moment. Bellatrix had railed against the damn prophecy for as long as Narcissa could remember. She had said many times that it was <em> her </em> choice, and none other’s; yet when the time came, she had not hesitated so long as to blink. <em> She is not as crazy as she initially appears, and not as evil as everyone else thinks. </em> Also not quite the truth, but perhaps something that Granger would have liked to hear coming from Narcissa. Narcissa knew she was blinded by her love for her sister, and her knowledge of the girl that was under the mask, but she <em> did </em> see humanity in Bellatrix. It was just buried under layers of trauma, years of powerlessness. For a woman so strong, it must have been maddening to have so little control over her own fate. </p><p>Bellatrix Crucio-ed Draco when she returned and found her plaything gone. "Why would I have ever helped the Mudblood escape?" Narcissa hissed at her, wishing for sanity and seeing only the haze of hatred in her sister's eye. There were Death Eaters observing them, but she was desperate to save her son. Her mind jumped through ways of getting through to her sister without being too explicit. "What possible importance could she have?"</p><p>Bellatrix howled and destroyed the entire entry hall, sending everyone scrambling away, Draco safely among them. Narcissa dared to approach her later that night, sitting solitary at the head of the long formal dining room. She had a plate of food laid before her, but had not touched it, and was gazing distantly off in space. </p><p>Narcissa protected their vicinity from eavesdroppers and sat down at Bellatrix’s right hand. “You know she was not safe here.”</p><p>Bellatrix hissed like a snake and turned her face away. </p><p>“Stop acting like a child, Bellatrix. You should have sent her away yourself. You are so blinded - and by what? What twisted story have you told yourself, all this time?”</p><p>Bellatrix turned to face her, finally, and Narcissa could see that her eyes were bloodshot red. She spoke quickly, words tumbling over each other in a cascade. “How do you know it worked? What if she wasn’t the one?” </p><p>“It worked the very first time, Bella,” she told her older sister gently. </p><p>“How are you so certain?” </p><p>“There is a simple charm.” Narcissa had cast it from the adjoining room when the noises had quieted completely, that first night. She’d been horrified to find that it was just a sloppily-done <em> Muffliato </em> when she stepped into the charm’s effect radius, and stepped quickly back away, shaking her head, feeling very sorry for Granger. </p><p>“The first time,” Bellatrix repeated, resting her elbow on the table and her forehead on her palm. “The <em> first </em> time.” Narcissa couldn’t read the tone, but when Bellatrix repeated the phrase for the third time she interrupted what was clearly a spiral.</p><p>“If you are so eager to have her back, you should know that it seems she’s quite… fond of you. She seemed almost unwilling to leave.”</p><p>Bellatrix flashed an awful grin at her. “Ickle muddy liked to play,” she told Narcissa with something like pride. </p><p>Narcissa’s stomach twisted in disgust, and something must have shown on her face, because Bellatrix flipped her dish of untouched food over and stormed away. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Ron Weasley was useless, as usual. He stood in the bloodstained kitchen and watched Hermione rock back and forth, casting webs of charms and healing over the most notorious Death Eater known to mankind. He watched Mrs. Malfoy bleed out as Harry cut long gashes in her robes to try to get to the splinching wounds, an unstoppered Essence of Dittany potion in his left hand. </p><p>Between spells, Hermione said, “There isn’t enough dittany. Give it to me, Harry.”</p><p>Bellatrix Black’s guts were mostly back in her body cavity. It didn’t seem possible to Ron that she was actually still alive. Her face was as white as a sheet, and she was unmoving. The entire kitchen floor was covered in her blood, and Hermione was no trained healer. </p><p>“This is the only one we have,” Harry said through his teeth. He’d uncovered Mrs. Malfoy’s thigh, and the sight of her bone through the flesh made Ron run to the kitchen sink and vomit into it. He looked out the window, seeing soothing white snow outside, a blanket of purity, seemingly untouched by the spring. When he’d recovered, Hermione had fastened Bellatrix’s skin together and had moved up to the woman’s face. </p><p>There was a hissing sound, and green smoke filled the air. Hermione actually yelled, spinning on one heel on the ground and diving toward Harry. </p><p>“You’ll spill it -” </p><p>“Give it to me -”</p><p>Harry was scrambling backward, the potion unsteady in his hand. </p><p>“I’ll seal her up when I’m finished with Black,” Hermione said, and by some force of absolute determination reached Harry and wrenched the dittany out of his hand.</p><p>“It’s a waste,” Harry called after her as she scrambled back over Mrs. Malfoy’s body to the Death Eater’s and, with trembling hands, carefully applied a narrow stream of the stuff along the broken lines of Black’s stomach. “She’ll never live.”</p><p>“Why are you wasting the last of our dittany on Bellatrix Black?” Ron said out loud to the air, and Harry peered over the center divide of the kitchen to meet his eyes in the dimness. “Or Narcissa Malfoy?” he added, directed at Harry. Although Hermione had said it was Mrs. Malfoy that had released her from her imprisonment, so maybe fixing her up wasn’t crazy. Ron was unsure. </p><p>Hermione was totally deaf to his questions. Black was splinched too, not as badly as Mrs. Malfoy, and she found each of the long lacerations and applied dittany to them, too. When she was finished, she put the potion on the kitchen floor and put each hand on either side of Black’s face. </p><p>“Why are Death Eaters in your parents’ winter cabin, Hermione?” Ron tried again, and then his voice failed him.</p><p>Hermione was kissing Bellatrix Black, whispering something that sounded like a prayer. </p><p>Ron looked at Harry, who was wincing and looking down. </p><p>“It’s CPR, Ron,” Harry told him brusquely, and snatched up the dittany, seeming to recover. </p><p>Ron turned on his heel and went around the corner to the tiny living room, where the couch was set up as his bed. He sat heavily on it. “Should I pack our stuff to run?” he asked dully, not expecting an answer. He collapsed backward, staring at the ceiling and listening to the muffled sound of Hermione’s Muggle prayers and scattered incantations.</p><p>It developed that they were not, in fact, running. It developed that Harry would be sleeping on the floor next to Ron’s couch, and Mrs. Malfoy would be recovering in Harry’s room. Black would be in Hermione’s bed. Neither was conscious yet. Harry thought he’d found all the splinches on Mrs. Malfoy, and now hesitated to so much as touch her, and Hermione was so wrapped up with Black that she barely noticed as Harry and Ron rearranged their lives around the two unexpected visitors.</p><p>Hermione closed her door, so Ron and Harry pulled up two chairs and kept the bedroom door open as they revived Mrs. Malfoy.</p><p>The woman sighed heavily and thrashed a little as she came to, but she recovered her senses quickly and looked with shock at the boys. </p><p>“What are <em> you </em> doing here?” she asked sharply. </p><p>“Hermione brought us here. Said it was her parents’.” </p><p>“Ah,” Mrs. Malfoy said, and she sat up slightly, seeming to take inventory of herself. “Lovely. I haven’t had such a bad Apparition accident in many years. I’m glad you were here. Thank you for your help.”</p><p>Harry nodded. “We couldn’t deny you healing, not when you were in such bad shape.”</p><p>“And my - my sister?” The unspoken question was clear: <em> Is Bellatrix alive? </em></p><p>“Hermione’s taking care of her,” Harry told Mrs. Malfoy grimly. “She was in worse shape than you.”</p><p>“I - I know,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “Most of that happened before I was able to get to her.”</p><p>“What - what happened, Mrs. Malfoy?” Harry asked her. </p><p>“My sister decided it was a good time to try the Killing Curse behind the Dark Lord’s back. It didn’t work. Clearly. And he decided that a quick death was not suitable, giving me enough time to come to her aid. I told Draco and Lucius to flee, but I do not know where they went.”</p><p>Ron looked around with alarm, hoping that two additional Malfoys hadn’t somehow found their way into the tiny cabin as well. </p><p>“Bellatrix Black tried to <em> assassinate </em>the Dark Lord?” Harry was focused on Mrs. Malfoy.</p><p>“Yes,” she said, sighing. “Even given the prophecy that said you were the only one who could do it. I tried to talk sense into her, but she has always been impatient to a fault.”</p><p>“You’re on our side?” Ron asked her, just to be sure he was hearing right.</p><p>“We have turned on the Dark Lord. Yes.”</p><p>Harry took a deep breath. “Well. You should present yourself to -”</p><p>Mrs. Malfoy interrupted him. “I need to find my husband and son, first of all. But before that - could you provide some water?”</p><p>Harry jumped to his feet, and Ron followed him to the kitchen, whispering. “Do you believe that bullcrap?” </p><p>Harry was filling up a glass of water from the magical spigot in the sink, holding his nose. “Ron, will you clean up your sick?” he said instead of answering, and then whisked away back to Mrs. Malfoy.</p><p>Ron, grumbling, did as Harry requested. </p><p>All sound from Hermione’s room had quieted by the time Harry and Ron were settling into their new sleeping arrangement. Harry continued to avoid his questions, so Ron went to sleep. </p><p>Around midnight, Ron went to the bathroom. He opened the door without knocking, and found himself face-to-face with a very ragged and frankly terrifying Bellatrix Black, dressed in a ridiculous frilly blue sleeping dress. </p><p>She snarled at him, and he stumbled back all the way down the hall and hid in the front room until the door to Hermione’s room was closed again. </p><p>The next day, Harry made eggs and bacon, and Hermione appeared for as long as it took to load up one large plate of the food and ask about Mrs. Malfoy. They gave her an abbreviated version of the tale, which Hermione seemed to take in with half an ear. She excused herself without a single comment, and Ron followed after her.</p><p>“Hermione, are you alright? This - this entire thing seems really -” he caught a glimpse of her wrist, exposed on the arm that held the plate. “Is that a <em> bruise? </em>You were her prisoner - why -”</p><p>“You wouldn’t understand,” Hermione whispered at him, scowling deeply.</p><p>“Take some <em> veritaserum </em>and tell us that you’re really OK,” Ron persisted. “This isn’t natural, Hermione. You should hate her like the rest of us do.”</p><p>“She is on our side,” Hermione said sharply, her voice a bit louder. “Bugger off, Ron.” </p><p>Harry was leaning against the counter looking alert when Ron reappeared. “There’s something wrong with her, mate,” Ron said, and served his own plate.</p><p>“Stockholm Syndrome,” Harry told him grimly. “Or something like it.”</p><p>Ron swallowed his food quickly and then choked when he tried to speak. When he recovered, he whispered, “Do ya think they’re - you know -” </p><p>“Shagging?” Harry looked like he was trying to decide whether to tell Ron something.</p><p>“That wasn’t any CRP, last night,” Ron persisted. “Did she tell you something she didn’t tell me?”</p><p>“It’s not my place,” Harry told him. </p><p><em> “That’s </em> what happened when she was prisoner,” Ron said, and Harry made a hushing sound. </p><p>“Ron, you know the walls are paper-thin. Have some decency.”</p><p>“But if she was in her right mind -”</p><p>Harry squirmed. “I will talk with her when I can, but neither of us can really tell her what to do, Ron.”</p><p>“I actually think it’s sort of our <em> job </em> to do that, Harry!” Ron’s voice came out in a squeak at the end, which did embarrass him enough that they spent the rest of the meal in silence.</p><p>That afternoon, Hermione emerged from the room. Bellatrix Black trailed her, dressed back up in her usual robes, the rends and holes in it mended by magic. She was pale, ethereally beautiful, and Ron couldn’t help himself but to stare a bit. It felt like that Veela magic that Fleur Delacour had, a little bit, except instead of adoring her the sensation of attraction just disgusted Ron more. </p><p>Mrs. Malfoy had already left, going to check a few locations to see if she could track down Mr. Malfoy without trying to owl, which would likely be a useless endeavor as he was hopefully already Unplottable. If he wasn’t, odds were that the Dark Lord would have caught him by this time anyway. </p><p>Hermione stood slightly ahead of Black, as if to shield her from Ron and Harry. “We are going to the Black vault to retrieve Helga Hufflepuff's Cup.”</p><p>Black cleared her throat. <em> “I </em> am going. <em> You </em>will not be coming with me.” </p><p>Hermione scowled and turned slightly to glare at Black. Seeing that Hermione’s foul mood seemed to extend to their houseguest relieved a little bit of Ron’s anxiety. A little bit. </p><p>“It’s too dangerous for you to go alone,” Hermione told Black.</p><p>“Ron and I will go with her,” Harry spoke up. “Right, Bellatrix?” he said, tipping his head and raising his eyebrows expectantly. </p><p>Black’s eyes dropped to meet his. “That would be - acceptable, as long as you properly conceal your identities.”</p><p>Harry gave her a thumbs-up. “We had a plan to use Polyjuice. Hermione’s a pro at making it.”</p><p>“She will not be making the potion,” Black said, nose pointed distinctly skyward, and Hermione made a muffled sound of dismay, but did not argue the point. Odder and odder. Oddest. Ron frowned. “I hope that the two of you boys can manage a passable version with her oversight. You may bring her photographs and small samples.”</p><p>“Right…” Ron said, looking at Harry disbelievingly. “Right, because that <em> totally </em> makes sense.” </p><p>Harry patted Ron’s knee without looking at him. “We’ll get right on it. It will be a few days.”</p><p><em> “Obviously,” </em>Black growled, and she turned around and went straight back into Hermione’s room.</p><p>“Mate,” Harry said to Hermione as she began to follow. “There’s - a thing, a stick, stuck outside in the - in the tap mechanism - would you come out with me to help fix it up?”</p><p>Hermione scoffed and rolled her eyes, putting a hand on her hip. She was deeply flushed, Ron noticed for the first time. “Yes, Harry,” she said, and followed him outside.</p><p>Ron lay back on the couch and counted the slats on the ceiling for the millionth time. Thirty-three. He was alone in a cabin with Bellatrix Black, murder extraordinaire. He gripped his wand tightly on his chest and waited it out.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Minerva McGonagall was no stranger to fear, but the feeling of deep shock laced with fear was an unusual one for her. She stared slack-jawed as Bellatrix Black marched into the Great Hall, looking directly at her. </p><p>A <em> volunteer? </em>Minerva took her wand out (she was no fool) and marched to the woman, careful not to come too close. Black could bite like a cobra if she was so inclined. </p><p>“Don’t look so shocked,” Black chuckled as Minerva opened her mouth. “I am sure that you have heard that I switched sides.”</p><p>“You are here to defend Hogwarts?” Minerva straightened her glasses and straightened her shoulders. </p><p>“Cross my heart and hope not to die,” Black said flippantly, but she did draw her wand and make a cross over her heart. Not an Unbreakable Vow, but a magical promise nonetheless. It was proof enough that her words were genuine, at least. </p><p>“Well. Hmm. Will you - meet Arthur at the West Wing to set up fortifications?”</p><p>“Yes.” Black looked searchingly around the Great Hall. “Where is Granger?”</p><p>“Hermione? Granger?”</p><p>“The one and only,” Black said. Her face seemed to contort briefly, and then settle back into blankness.</p><p>“Miss Granger has not yet presented herself,” Minerva informed Black. <em> And if she had, I am not sure if I would be inclined to disclose her location to you. </em> There was something hungry about Black’s look. Hungry, or desperate, or both.</p><p>“The Dark Lord has demanded Harry Potter. I thought he would be with - with her?” </p><p>“Not that I am aware,” Minerva said stiffly. Black’s face twisted into that grotesque mask again, and she spun and stalked away. Minerva watched her long enough to be assured that she seemed to be headed toward the West Wing, and then she turned back to continue fortifying. </p><p>Minerva did not see Black again until the one-hour reprive in the battle. Harry was completely missing, but Hermione and Ron were huddled together with a few of the other students orbiting around them. Black marched straight over to the two and drew Hermione away from Ron, and Minerva focused a hearing-enhancement charm in their direction and tried to keep her head down.</p><p>It was Black. <em> You gave me the slip. I woke up alone. </em></p><p>
  <em> It - I didn’t mean it like that, Bella. This isn’t about you, or us. We just need to win, which meant we had to leave you behind.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I am your best weapon. Anything that you needed - </em>
</p><p>
  <em> We needed to go to Hogwarts. You can’t mean that you’d be a great asset sneaking around the school, could you? </em>
</p><p><em> Should have left a note. </em> Black’s voice held a distinctive note of petulance. <em> And I can see that you’ve been fighting. Where have you been?  </em></p><p>
  <em> I - I didn’t think you’d actually show up here. I would have -  </em>
</p><p><em> Would have what? Gone to get me and stayed behind in safety? </em>Minerva feared for Hermione, with that dangerous tone coming from Black, and it seemed she wasn’t alone. </p><p>There was a magnified sound of shuffling, and then Weasley’s voice interjected. <em> Give her some space, Black. You don’t own her. </em></p><p>Black made a loud growling sound. It was Granger that spoke next. <em> Bella, put that thing </em> away. <em> Ron, I’m fine. </em></p><p><em> Wonniekins has a teensy crush. </em> Black cackled. <em> Now, be careful - if you puff your chest up any more, you’re liable to begin floating away. </em></p><p>
  <em> I - I don’t, you’re just - why won’t you leave her alone? And all this talk - the potionmaking - what - </em>
</p><p><em> He has no idea what I did to you. </em>Minerva shuddered at the tone of Black’s voice, and shot a glance over at the group.</p><p>Black was leaning over Granger possessively, and Ron was wide-eyed, his face screwed up into a confused and defensive look. The poor boy had such unattractive features. </p><p>Granger pushed away from Black, but they were facing away from Minerva so she could not read their expressions. She looked down quickly. There were so many bones to mend, and her attention had drifted completely from the task. She set upon it once again; an unconscious seventh-year, a Ravenclaw Quidditch player, muscular and young and very unfortunately broken. </p><p><em> You’re disgusting, </em> Granger whispered to Bella, and Minerva thought to herself that she would like to know what on earth Black had done to Granger, too. <em> Why would you say that? </em></p><p>
  <em> You’re mine. </em>
</p><p><em> Not if I don’t choose to be. </em> Minerva glanced up to see Granger storming away. Black jogged after her, exhibiting the boundless energy that Minerva remembered from her time at Hogwarts thirty years ago. </p><p>Lovers, Minerva thought to herself, shaking her head at the absurdity of it. Well, Granger seemed to have Black under control, judging from the bowed look of the woman as she scurried after the girl. Granger was of consenting age at seventeen; it was not any of Minerva’s business at all.</p><p>The student stirred under her hands, coming to with an unpleasant shriek. “Dawn,” Minerva remembered her name, finally. “Dawn, everything is under control. I have just mended your bones, so you should be in some pain, but as good as new when it fades. Water?”</p><p>Dawn groaned and turned over on the cot. “I think this is the fourth time I broke that specific rib. One of these days we should just leave it broken and see how that goes.”</p><p>“Yes, well,” Minerva said, and pushed a jug of water into the girl’s hand before moving on to the next. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Jill Tylor was bored. "Hermione Granger," she called out, looking down at the chart. This was her third appointment with National Health Service, and the prior two hadn't raised any red flags. She looked up to see Granger moving toward her, some gothic figure towering behind her. Jill was momentarily fazed, but covered it up by looking back down at the charts, looking for the girl's age. <em> Seventeen. </em> She repressed a sad sigh. </p><p>They went through the admission procedures. She took Granger into the room ahead of the goth, and asked her if she felt safe at home, and if there was anything she'd like to say between the two of them. A non-relative was listed as the girl's emergency contact - estranged from the parents, then. Jill saw too many cases like this one to be too surprised, but Granger was not sulky at all. She was sweet, with an innocent smile and a smattering of freckles. </p><p>Jill let the goth in, checking the emergency contact name. "Are you - Molly Weasley?"</p><p>The goth snorted, but Granger answered. "No. This is Bellatrix."</p><p>"Welcome, Bellatrix. So, today is your second ultrasound, and if we are lucky I'll be able to tell you the sex of your baby."</p><p>Granger smiled happily and looked over at Bellatrix, who was perched at the edge of the guest chair, looking with interest at the medical equipment. An aunt? Their hair was equally curly, but their features, while both beautiful in a magazine fold out way, were not otherwise similar. Probably a friend, then. A much older friend. What was it her son called it - Cosplay? The woman was certainly wearing some sort of costume, although the girl's style was more preppy than anything else. </p><p>Jill shook her head and directed her attention to the ultrasound machine. </p><p>After some probing, she found the baby. The heart beat sounded regular, which was good. "Do you see the feet?" she asked them, and the two shuffled. </p><p>"Yes, look!" Granger said, and then the baby moved away from the intrusion and Jill had to start all over again. </p><p>"She's moving," Granger told the goth, and the goth muttered something under her breath. </p><p>"There's her head," Jill said, snapping a screenshot quickly before the baby could move again.</p><p><em> "Her?" </em>The goth sounded almost upset, and Granger laughed a little. Jill hazarded a glance at them and they were close together, holding hands. The girl was crying and the goth was scowling fiercely. "It's supposed to be a boy."</p><p>"Oh, well," Jill fumbled, moving the wand up again. "It's not. See?" She was trying not to be rude, but it was difficult with the goth and the whole unfortunate situation. Lesbians. How utterly unconventional. </p><p>"Just looks like a bunch of lines to me," the goth muttered, and the girl giggled at her. </p><p>Jill took a few more shots and printed them out. When she was turned away, the pair of them had the gall to begin openly snogging. </p><p>"She's still moving," Granger told the goth, and the goth put her hand the girl's stomach. Jill shook her head and left the photos on the table, excusing herself. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Andrew Jamison was distracted. "Late again, Black," Andrew said, ticking her name off the list and noting the time. She sneered at him and placed the transparent bag with her personal belongings on the table. She'd already changed back into the prisoner garb. </p><p>"Keeping this," she said, flashing a piece of paper at him, and he shrugged at her and turned back to the radio. He'd missed a key play, it seemed, and the Holyhead Harpies had possession. He doodled and tried to work out what had gone so wrong, as thunderous echoes of cheering came through the tinny speakerphone. </p><p>
  <br/>

</p><p>December 19, 1997, the day that Narcissa Malfoy finally decided it was OK to hate her big sister. </p><p>They'd been given the keys to the Black Mansion, empty and abandoned since their father died twenty years ago. The house elves had long since perished, and the house was infested with Cornish pixies, bats, and common rats, which all co-existed in seeming obliviousness to the fact that not one of them belonged there. Oh, and spiders. Spiders, too.</p><p>Narcissa brought her own two house-elves with her to help, but there was far too much to do in forty-eight hours to be finished with it all in time. Bellatrix, predictably, had marched into the mansion, declared that it was suitable, and left Narcissa to it. </p><p>So Narcissa did something she had never imagined doing before. She Floo-ed Andromeda. </p><p>They'd met over tea twice since the Dark Lord's defeat, and touched only briefly on the subject of Bellatrix. Andromeda's cottage was small enough that when Narcissa stuck her head into the fire and shouted, she appeared around the corner of the living room promptly. </p><p>"Andromeda," Narcissa sniffed. "I am calling to ask for your help."</p><p>"My help," Andromeda said, sitting slowly down on the couch by the fire. "What is it that you need, sister?"</p><p>"Bellatrix plans to bring the - Granger and the child back to our childhood home in two days, and we just received the keys back after - as you know, months of <em> trials </em> and <em> hearings </em> and all that nonsense, and the house is a complete <em> nightmare, </em> absolutely unsuitable for a newborn, but Bellatrix has gone already and -" she was nearing tears. </p><p>Andy made a soothing gesture. "I will be there in an hour," she told Narcissa, and Narcissa nodded her thanks, incapable of expressing the depths of her gratitude. </p><p>"The solstice is the twenty-first, remember," Narcissa told her. "I don't know where Bella has <em> gone." </em></p><p>"Probably back to the Burrow," Andy guessed. </p><p>"She is utterly ridiculous."</p><p>"She has something else on her mind, I'm sure," Andy said soothingly. "I will be right there."</p>
