    <p>In the smallest bedroom of Number 4, Privet Drive, Harry Potter awoke with a jolt. For just a moment, he didn't know where he was. He was used to sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs, and indeed, had lived there until only a few weeks previously, when he had been moved to Dudley's second bedroom. The remnants of his cousin were still evident, and the room was filled with his old toys and books. The bedroom was an improvement, but Harry couldn't quite get used to how much space he had now.</p><p>He had been having another odd dream. Sometimes, they were of a bright green light, and a high pitched, spine chilling laugh. Once, he had dreamt of a flying motorcycle. But mostly, he dreamed about a boy named Tom Riddle.</p><p>Harry used to think that Tom was a figment of his imagination, a kind of imaginary friend that he made up to combat the loneliness. But he had dreamed of Tom talking to snakes, and then spoken to a snake himself. He had dreamed of Tom doing something like magic, and then he had been told that magic was real, that he was a wizard. So maybe Tom was real, too. Harry hoped he was. It was almost like having a friend.</p><p>The dream he'd had that night had been about Tom's own admittance to Hogwarts. Albus Dumbledore, the man he had heard so much about from Hagrid, and the Headmaster of Hogwarts, had come to see Tom, inviting him to Hogwarts. It wasn't the first clue Harry had had that Tom had lived many years before him, and Harry wondered if Tom was even still alive. He hoped so.</p><p>The dream had taken something of an alarming turn when Dumbledore had set the wardrobe on fire, however. Harry sort of understood where the professor was coming from, he supposed. He was familiar with Tom's habit of taking trophies from his bullies as a form of revenge, and continuing that at Hogwarts would likely be a foolish idea. But he also didn't like Professor Dumbledore's methods. The threat was implicit, and Tom had been understandably furious at it, no matter the face he had put on for Dumbledore.</p><p>He'd woken up after Dumbledore had left, feeling the echoes of Tom's combined anger and eagerness. The knowledge ringing in him that he was really different, really special.</p><p>Harry could relate.</p><p>He'd felt something similar when he'd gotten past his denial. All his life, the Dursley's had told him he was nothing, that he was a freak. They had treated him like something beneath them. And knowing that he wasn't, that he was<em> better</em>, that he was a wizard and they were just muggles was incredibly validating. He had dreamed of something like this for as long as he could remember. Of growing up and proving that he was worth something, that he was better than them. And now he had proof.</p><p>Of course, he hadn't voiced that to Hagrid. Harry had learned the hard way to keep his thoughts to himself, to make sure that no one knew what he was thinking. Between neglectful teachers and the Dursley's, he knew that if they knew the resentful and angry thoughts he'd had he would be punished. Or if he let the Dursley's know that he snuck food sometimes, they would punish him. No, it was better to keep things to himself, and as much as he liked Hagrid, he'd had no proof that he could trust the man.</p><p>He wondered what Albus Dumbledore was like now. If he would dream more of the man, and learn about him. Because he was sure now that Tom was real, that he had gone to Hogwarts too, and that somehow, he was connected to Harry. He didn't know how yet, but he was determined to figure it out.</p><p>Harry rolled over in the small bed, before sitting up and stretching. The sun was already peeking over the horizon, and there was no way he was going back to sleep. He was going to Hogwarts that day, after all.</p><p>He rose from the bed, shivering slightly at the cold air, and began to pack his things. He had devoured the books that he had bought over the last few weeks, both those on the school list and the others he had bought, eager to learn more about the magical world. Harry had even read about himself, and the dark lord, Voldemort, who he had apparently defeated when he was a baby. Harry was somewhat skeptical about this. He had no reason to believe an infant could kill a dark lord. Or even just stop hims somehow, if he was still alive like Hagrid had said. It just didn't make sense. But then again, Harry knew so little about magic. Maybe there was something to it, after all. Maybe he would learn at Hogwarts.</p><p>He packed his books and things in his new trunk, making sure to leave his robes on top so he could change in the train. He didn't want to wear his school robes in front of the Dursley's.</p><p>Leaving on of his books out, he read until it was time for him to go downstairs for breakfast, studiously not making eye contact with Dudley. He knew his cousin was going to the hospital to get the pig's tail Hagrid had given him removed, and he didn't want him to see the smirk that might cross his face. He still thought the whole thing was hilarious. Dudleys was really a pig, though that might be an insult to the animal.</p><p>A long, somewhat miserable car ride later, and Harry found himself at King's Cross. His uncle had laughed at the idea of a Platform 9 3/4, but Harry knew it was real. It just had to be. It was only a matter of finding it. He wasn't foolish enough to ask one of the station guards. They no doubt had never heard of Hogwarts. There must be some secret, like how Hagrid had tapped the bricks behind the Leaky Cauldron. Standing between platforms 9 and 10, he wished, not for the first time, that Tom was there. Tom always seemed so much smarter than Harry was. He would know what to do, or a least have been aware enough to ask Hagrid about getting onto the train beforehand. He glanced towards his owl. Maybe he could write a letter? That would be better than nothing, he supposed.</p><p>"-packed with muggles, of course," he heard suddenly, and he looked around, trying to find the voice. Muggles. It <em>must</em> be a wizarding family going to the platform!</p><p>Half hiding behind a pillar, he watched the family appear - redheads, all of them. He wondered if they were all magic, like the pale boy at Madame Malkin's had talked about. Harry was starting to understand that there was a difference between muggleborns, purebloods, and half-bloods like himself, though he wasn't sure what that difference was besides who your parents were.</p><p>He watched intently as the mother of the family sent the boys through the barrier between platforms 9 and 10, just running at it and disappearing. Harry bit his lip, wondering if he should ask them how to do it. But they didn't seem to be doing anything special, just walking through the brick. After the last red-head had disappeared, he walked slowly up to the barrier. Just when his trolley was about to hit the solid surface, it gave way, and he was suddenly at Platform 9 3/4.</p><p>Magic was truly brilliant. All those muggles, with no idea what was right beneath their noses.</p><p>He maneuvered his trolley through the crowds of people on the platform, taking in everything he could. Most people wore some kind of robes, though a few could be seen wearing muggle clothes. He supposed those must be muggleborns and their families, or maybe people who had traveled through the muggle world, like the red-headed family.</p><p>Maneuvering his trolley through the crowd, Harry made his way to the train. He wondered how he was going to get his trunk onto it - it was much too heavy for him to lift by himself, he knew. But still, he made the attempt, all the while wishing he had learned the hovering charm that he had read about. It would make things so much easier.</p><p>"Need a hand?" Harry turned, and saw a tall dark-haired boy smirking down at him. He flushed, embarrassed that he couldn't do so much as handle his trunk. But the truth was, he did need help, and he would be stupid to turn down assistance so freely offered.</p><p>"Yeah, if you don't mind," he said reluctantly.</p><p>"Not a problem. I'm Cassius Warrington."</p><p>"Harry Potter," he said, somewhat reluctantly introducing himself. He still remembered all the attention he had gotten in Diagon Alley, and didn't really want to repeat that experience with his future classmates.</p><p>But Cassius only raised his eyebrows.</p><p>"Are you really?" he said. "Well, we all knew Harry Potter would be coming to Hogwarts this year, I suppose. Nice to meet you, Potter. Let's get you settled."</p><p>He easily lifted Harry's trunk, and carried it onto the train. Harry scrambled to grab Hedwig's cage and followed, glad that Warrington's reaction had been subdued.</p><p>Warrington lead him into an empty compartment, storing Harry's trunk.</p><p>"Here you go, Potter. Hope to see you in Slytherin," he smirked, as if telling a great joke.</p><p>"Thanks," Harry replied, watching as Warrington loped off.</p><p>He had read a great deal about the houses in <em>Hogwarts, a History</em>, one of the extra books he had gotten in Diagon Alley. Slytherin seemed to be an option for him. He was ambitious, in his way, and cunning, and most of all, the other houses didn't seem to suit him at all. He wasn't particularly brave, like Gryffindor said. He wasn't hardworking, for Hufflepuff. Ravenclaw might be an option, but he really only wanted knowledge for power, not for knowledge's sake. So that left Slytherin.</p><p>But Hagrid had said such things about the House, Harry wasn't sure. Maybe Ravenclaw would be better. He didn't want to be in a house with a bunch of Dark Wizards. Then again, he didn't really understand what a dark wizard was, except that Hagrid said they were bad, and that Voldemort was one. But it didn't make sense for an entire house to be evil, did it? Or else they would just all be expelled or something like that.</p><p>Harry was so lost in thought, he didn't realize that someone had entered his compartment until he heard them clearing their throat.</p><p>"Oh, sorry," he said, jerking upright. "Can I help you?"</p><p>"Just looking for a place to sit," said the boy, standing in the doorway. "Most other compartments are full up."</p><p>"Oh, come on in," he said, attempting to be friendly.</p><p>The boy did, pulling his trunk behind him easily. Harry supposed it much be enchanted to be lighter.</p><p>"My name's Theodore Nott," the boy, said as he sat down opposite Harry.</p><p>"I'm Harry Potter," Harry said, mentally preparing for Nott's reaction. But Nott only sharpened his gaze, as if Harry had suddenly become much more interesting to him.</p><p>"Oh, really?" he said, though it was apparent he wasn't really asking. "Everyone's been talking about you, you know. I think the Daily Prophet ran a special article, even, speculating about you coming to Hogwarts."</p><p>Harry flushed, somewhat angrily. The newspaper had been talking about him? Wasn't that illegal? Well, maybe not in the wizarding world.</p><p>"I didn't know," he said, rather helplessly. "I didn't even know about - about any of this, before I got my Hogwarts letter."</p><p>Nott looked at him curiously.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"I mean - I thought I was a muggle! I didn't know about magic, or Voldemort, or any of it! Then Hagrid came -"</p><p>"The gamekeeper?" Nott asked incredulously. </p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>"Yeah. And he told me everything. And I've been trying to read, to learn, but I just don't understand."</p><p>Harry blushed again. He had just unloaded on this stranger all of his doubts, and it was kind of embarrassing. He usually was more reticent than that.</p><p>"First word of advice, Potter - don't say You-Know-Who's name. People don't like it, even from the Boy-Who-Lived," Nott said.</p><p>Harry nodded seriously. He didn't really understand why, but he was pretty sure Nott was telling the truth. After all, Hagrid hadn't liked saying it, either. He nodded.</p><p>"Everyone thought you were off with some mysterious wizarding family," Nott continued. "Maybe some friend of your parents or something. Are you telling me you live with <em>muggles</em>?"</p><p>Harry nodded again.</p><p>"My mother's sister and her family," he said. "And they didn't tell me anything they knew about magic."</p><p>Nott shook his head.</p><p>"That's awful," he commented absently. "Well, listen, Potter, you've got a lot to catch up to. People will be expecting you to know things, you understand."</p><p>"Yeah, I thought so," Harry said miserably. "I've been reading, but I don't know if it will be enough. There's so much I just don't understand. And all the books all assume you know things already."</p><p>Nott nodded.</p><p>"I'm surprised you didn't get the muggleborn introduction pamphlets," he said, after a moment's thought. "Then again, you are a half-blood. Maybe they thought you wouldn't need them?"</p><p>"There are muggleborn introduction pamphlets?" Harry asked, surprised.</p><p>"Of course. There are lots of differences from the muggle world, so a few years ago they started sending out introductory pamphlets to the muggleborns. My father talked about it - it was controversial."</p><p>"Why?" Harry asked. It made sense to him.</p><p>"Some people think that muggleborns don't need to change anything to fit in. That muggles are similar enough to wizards that there's no point. Others think that we should be more like muggles "</p><p>"Wow. That's stupid," Harry said. "I don't know. I don't have a problem with muggles in general. But I don't know that wizards should start to change for them."</p><p>Nott looked at him intently for a moment.</p><p>"You're going to surprise a lot of people, Potter," he said finally. "It's going to be interesting. Any idea what house you're going to be in?"</p><p>Harry shrugged.</p><p>"Well, no one knows until they get to Hogwarts, do they?" he asked. "But I think I'd like Slytherin."</p><p>Nott smirked.</p><p>"Me too. It would be good to be in the same house, though I think some people would expect you to be in Gryffindor."</p><p>Harry frowned.</p><p>"Why? They don't know me."</p><p>Nott shrugged.</p><p>"People have a lot of assumptions about the Boy-Who-Lived. But I have a feeling you're going to prove them wrong."</p>
