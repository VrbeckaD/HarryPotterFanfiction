    <p>The sky screamed a warning call, the thunder clouds pregnant with rain that gushed onto the Manor grounds. Draco Malfoy sat perched on the window seat in the family library, watching the water droplets stream down the pane. If he crossed his eyes enough, he could see his reflection. Dark circles under dead, lifeless eyes, a tired mouth lined with creases. Evidence of words bitten back over the years. His breath fogged the glass, obscuring his face.</p><p>Tonight wasn't his Marking. He had thought it would be since it was the last day before 7th Year, but at 3 am, nobody had come to whisk him away to serve his Lord. </p><p>His father's Lord. </p><p>Draco sighed, sliding down from the window seat. He would be Marked soon enough. Already there had been talk of proving his loyalty; a night alone in the woods on a full moon - Greyback had chuckled throatily at that one - or perhaps the <em>Cruciatus </em>of a Muggle family. Whatever it would be, it would exploit Draco's greatest weakness. If he didn't know them already, the Dark Lord would ensure he soon would.</p><p>Making his way across the vast expanse of the library, Draco wondered when the prospect of becoming a Death Eater had stopped looking so enticing. He remembered back in 5th Year when all he had wanted was to follow in his father's footsteps. He tried to imagine himself with a bone-white mask and robes as dark as the night itself. A shiver ran up along his spine, but it wasn't of disgust. </p><p>Draco knew the old tit Dumbledore thought he was just a poor child, dragged into slavery by his ritualistic parents. To an extent, he'd be right. Draco went then to the far right of the room, where tomes upon texts of Dark Magic and rituals and rites filled whole walls. But Draco wasn't that different from his father. Only, he wanted his power to come with less fear, less all-encompassing hatred. He wouldn't bow to somebody that didn't possess a nose. The idea of himself in the tacky Death Eater outfit did nothing but make him long for his own thrown, his own velvet cloak and loyal faction. </p><p>Draco Malfoy wanted to be his own Dark Lord. The Dragon King.</p><p>Deftly and with the quickness of someone who knew they should not be doing what they are, Draco slid books from the shelves and filled the spaces up again. He did it quietly and without delay, the titles of the wanted texts glowing quietly in his mind. His heart raced, pumping blood so hard it rushed through his ears, drowning out the crackle and pop of the wall torches. Perhaps... well, it was a stupid thought, to think he could overthrow the Dark Lord as a naive 17-year-old boy. But if he gathered his magic - purely hypothetically - and grew in the Dark Arts, then surely more would flock to his court than to Voldemort's side? </p><p>It was an intoxicating thought, one that kept him awake into the late hours of the night scrawling in his journal. Notes in his meticulous handwriting filled almost 6 of the leatherbound books by now, all on possible ideas on his Dark Lord name, how to ascend to power, and possible allies. If Draco were to be so crazy as to truly try and usurp the most powerful wizard of all time, he would surely do it prepared.</p><p>Somewhere in the Manor, a door slammed shut, jolting Draco from his thoughts. He cursed, grabbing the few books he'd managed to get and stuffing them under his robes. Flicking off the wall torches with a wave of his wand, he crossed the expanse of the library, careful to not step on any of the floorboards that would surely report to his father. The half-sentient Manor was loyal to a fault.</p><p>Draco slid down long hallways, blending into the shadows along the walls. Once, he passed by Rudolphus Lestrange and had to hold his breath to not gag at the stench emanating from the man. Curdled guts and fresh blood. The smell some of the Death Eaters wore as though it were expensive perfume. Draco had taken to sniffing surreptitiously at his own robes, making sure the stomach-curling smell hadn't seeped into them. He was already under enough suspicion at Hogwarts.</p><p>He stopped in front of his door, checking behind him to make sure nobody had followed him, and quietly slipped into his room. Shutting the door behind him, Draco leaned against the wall, breathing out. Fuck, if he'd been caught... Well, there was no point dwelling on what if's. He hurried across the room, sinking his feet into the plush black rug. He drew the green velvet curtains with a wave of his wand - pitiful, he couldn't even draw curtains without the help of a piece of wood - and put out the ever-permanent Lumos on the chandeliers. The room plunged into darkness, but Draco wasn't frightened. On some base level, deep beneath his conscious mind, he'd been prepared for this.</p><p>He was going to perform this ritual, no matter what it took. </p><p>Setting the acquired books on a settee in front of his bed, Draco shed his robes. They pooled around his pale feet, leaving his naked body exposed. He shivered, though it wasn't cold in his room. He already had his first ritual - the ritual of Dark descent - memorized off by heart. He'd found it while skimming through his father's books on old magic before the book had been seized by Bellatrix, never to be seen again. He couldn't even remember the name, which bugged him to no end.</p><p>The ritual began with the shedding of blood. Draco pressed his wand to his left forearm, a thrill of glee shooting through him. </p><p>"<em>Diffindo," </em>he whispered, biting his lip as a gash appeared on his skin. He would have to get used to pain if he wanted to increase his magic at all. Breathing through the sharp sting, Draco ran his fingers through the sticky blood, coating his palm with it. </p><p>"I am borne of the Dark, a child to its whims. I am prepared to walk the Dark path until the end." A shimmer of magic erupted from his bloody palm. Draco gasped as the surge of power, at the sudden warmth that flooded the cold the Dark Lord had brought into Manor months ago. "I am borne of the Dark, a soldier to its commands. <em>Accipio descensus tenebris."</em></p><p>He pressed his palm to his bedroom floor, dripping the blood in a broken circle around his legs. The outside world had faded away, and Draco was left with the gentle whisper of Dark magic surrounding him. It felt sentient, alive in a way he had never experienced before. Everything the Dark Lord touched always had an air of death and decay. Draco had grown so used to it, that when the breath of Dark seized him, his eyes watered. Wiping the tears away, Draco whispered the parting words to the magic, focusing his attention on his magical core. "<em>Accipio descensus tenebris." </em>He felt something in him click open, and a tendril of boiling Dark magic curled itself around his innards. </p><p>Draco welcomed it. The ritual was complete. Rather anticlimactic, but Draco knew some of the more advanced rituals were spectacular. If he were to complete them, that was.</p><p>He broke the circle, vanishing his blood and sealing the gash on his arm. He didn't heal it fully, leaving a silvery-white scar that reminded him of the criss-cross hatches on his chest. The thought unsettled him, so he let it go. He would bask in the glow of Dark magic, which hung in the air and over objects in his room like faint gossamer. </p><p>Drained, Draco clambered into bed and drew his curtains around him. Hogwarts would be interesting this year.</p><p> </p>
