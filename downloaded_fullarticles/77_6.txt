    <p align="justify">"Ugh." I groaned, glaring down at the latest version of my report. It was the third draft I’d written and it was about to be the third draft I discarded. I felt like a prisoner, stuck in my office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement for weeks on end.</p><p align="justify">It’s been six years since the end of the Second Wizarding War and five years since I’d finished my Hogwarts education and applied to auror training. Unlike Harry and Ron, I wanted to earn my place as a magical law enforcer. Though I was ingrained in the Wizarding community of Britain, I felt the need to prove myself, to prove that I was still a force to be reckoned with, lest one of the remaining dark wizards got any ideas.</p><p align="justify">That’s hard to do that from an office, though. Little did I know there was so much paperwork involved after every outing. Of course, the boys couldn't be bothered to do it – more so recently than usual - leaving me behind as they went to investigate and apprehend dark wizards.</p><p align="justify">In fact, now that I thought about it, I hadn't been on a mission in at least a month. The boys had been busy while I sit, trapped in my office writing reports, logging evidence, and filling out transfer requests. Paperwork was only a <em>part</em> of the job.</p><p align="justify">With frustration boiling inside, I pushed the unfinished report to the side and pulled forward my schedule for next month. The most exciting thing I had to look forward to were a couple of days on call. The rest of the time was set aside for paperwork, meetings, and testimonials. I’d bet my salary that Harry’s and Ron’s schedules were chalk full of reconnaissance missions and raids. I’d be damned if I’m going to roll over and let this continue.</p><p align="justify">I left my office, turning toward my superior's office. I knocked on the open door and popped my head in only to find the room empty. <em>Just my luck,</em> I scowled and headed for the next most likely place: the tactical advancement room. Really, it was just a glorified conference room but apparently 'conference room' wasn't an aggressive enough name.</p><p align="justify">I entered to find Chris, the Head Auror, having a serious chat with Harry and Ron in the corner. A few other aurors stood around the room talking, paying no mind to me as I marched over.</p><p align="justify">Harry saw me approach first recognizing the fire in my eyes. He cleared his throat and interrupted whatever Chris was saying, "Hey, Mione. What's up?"</p><p align="justify">I pointedly ignored Harry, “What's going on?"</p><p align="justify">Ron waved me off, "Nothing much."</p><p align="justify">I bristled; the three of us worked as a team – no matter what.</p><p align="justify">"<em>Nothing much?”</em> I paused, I couldn’t snap at them in front of Chris. “You guys wouldn't happen to be discussing the commotion surrounding evidence storage, would you? I noticed the halls were blocked off this morning."</p><p align="justify">Chris looked mildly confused, “I thought you guys were going to talk to her?” He directed at the boys. They muttered poor excuses before Chris addressed me, "There was a break-in last night, just after midnight. All the evidence and paperwork from the death eater trials were stolen - including all of the wands and all of the documents relating to their arrests and sentencings."</p><p align="justify">“Oh.” My stomach churned at the possible implications. All of the things I imagined one could use the death eater trial information for, none were good. Awful as it was, I was itching for field work and this was the perfect opportunity, "What can I do to help?"</p><p align="justify">Harry and Ron looked like they wanted to protest but Chris was already speaking, "We're not sure how intruders there were or how they gained access to the storage facilities but we're already checking in with all personnel that have clearance since there was no sign of forced entry - physical or magical. They did leave a mark - <em>their</em> mark I assume; it's an outline of a two-headed snake. It was carved into the ground in front of the empty shelves at both locations where we stored the documents and evidence. The only real clue we have is where the last person to arrive disapparated from. It seems to be a bar in Knockturn Alley called the Portentous Grotto. If you’re up for it, why don't you head over there in plainclothes and see what information you can quietly dredge up?"</p><p align="justify">I nodded, excited to escape my office for the first time in weeks, and promised to keep them updated on any developments. I left immediately for my flat before Harry or Ron could intervene or attempt to tag along. I didn’t really want to be around them at the moment.</p><p align="justify">Once back home, I hurriedly began digging through my clothes until I found a dark but comfortable outfit to change into. I threw on a black, oversized cloak, flipping up the hood and disapparating to Knockturn Alley.</p><p align="justify">I arrived at the Portentous Grotto moments later. It was a worn and dilapidated structure with a warped, wooden set of steps jutting out towards the street in a less-than-welcoming way. It looked more like the barbed tongue of a magical creature than the entrance to a place of business.</p><p align="justify">I stepped up to the front doors, steeling my nerves with a deep breathe before pushing through the door. The buzz of conversations greeted me along with the smell of musty ales. No one paid me mind as I sat down at the end of the bar.</p><p align="justify">I ordered a firewhiskey from the disgruntled looking man behind the bar. He was tall, balding, and had a stomach that made me suspect he frequently enjoyed the products he provided. I took a faint sip and grabbed his attention before he could move on.</p><p align="justify">"I was supposed to meet someone here last night. Do you remember anyone disapparating around midnight?"</p><p align="justify">The bartender looked weary but spoke, "I wasn't working that late. You can ask Ash over there," he nodded to the bartender on the other side of the bar, "She was here last night."</p><p align="justify">I muttered my thanks and waited for Ash to move closer. Once the blond was done chatting with someone a few seats down from me, I waved her over. "I heard you were working late last night. Do you remember anyone apparating out around midnight? I meant to meet them but ended up showing too late and now I’m trying to track them down."</p><p align="justify">Ash flipped her hair over her shoulder with an irritated scowl, "Like I was just saying to the other fella, it’s not exactly uncommon for people to come and go as they please from this place. So, no." She huffed, “Maybe you two are looking for each other.”</p><p align="justify">I sat up straighter, instantly alert. "What ‘other fella’?"</p><p align="justify">Ash nodded to my right where there was now an empty seat, "I was talking to him right before you called me over."</p><p align="justify">"What did he look like?" I asked in a rush. Maybe he was meant to be part of the expedition. Maybe he knew who planned the attack and what they hoped to gain from stealing wands and court documents. Maybe he was a potential buyer for the stolen items.</p><p align="justify">"Dark blond hair, long and shaggy. Deep blue eyes and dark brown cloak embroidered with black detailing – very expensive looking.”</p><p align="justify">"Thanks for your help," I pulled a few coins from my pocket, making sure I had enough to give her a sizable tip, then sprinted out the door.</p><p align="justify">I glanced around from the top of the stairs. Knockturn Alley was never very busy so it wasn’t hard to spot my target. My heart thrumming at a possible lead, I bounded down the steps and walked as fast as I dared to catch up before the mystery man could turn a corner and evade me. I cast a silencing charm on myself before following as closely as I dared, only a few paces back. I kept my body as small and as centered behind him as I could, not wanting him to see me from the corner of his eye while I followed him. I hoped he would lead me to something of use.</p><p align="justify">The suspect eventually stalked into a cramped alleyway. I peeked around the corner to see him still walking forward with no one else in sight. I rushed forward to catch up when I noticed the alley was a dead end. I latched my hand on the suspect’s arm to confront him and bring him back to the Ministry for questioning - right as he apparated.</p>
