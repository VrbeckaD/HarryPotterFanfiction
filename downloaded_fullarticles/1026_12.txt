    <p>Four years, it's been four years since it happened. The sun rose filling the sky with warmth and color. However, you can’t say this to a young father who woke with the sun. he did not feel the warmth when he opened his hazel eyes. “Four years ago,” he said to himself as he ran a hand through his messy black hair. it took a while for him to get out of bed, but he did not care for today was the day that his wife Lily died. James Potter sighed as he tried to get the tears from pouring out of his eyes. However, a knock on his door made him open his eyes after he had closed them to try to stop the tears from pouring out of his eyes.</p><p>“Prongs? Are you okay?” the voice of Sirius Orion Black called from the other side of the door. James smiled a little to himself at his best friend and got out of bed. Then he slowly walked over to it and opened it. In the doorway stood his best friend Sirius Black and a very tired looking Remus John Lupin. James wondered why Remus was awake. for the full moon was two nights ago and Remus is a werewolf.</p><p>“Good morning guys, um, where’s Harry?” James asked as he walked out of the room. Remus and Sirius looked at their friend worriedly.</p><p>“James um, Harry’s dead,” Remus looked at Sirius as he said this with tears in his eyes. When they looked at their friend he also had tears in his eyes. James’s world turned black.</p><p>“What!? No…………No, he was here yesterday. I tucked him in!” James yelled as he ran down the hall to Harry’s room. Sadly, the more he ran the more the world went dark. James then tripped on the rug and fell on his face.</p><p>              James woke with a scream. This scream was so loud that he did not hear the frantic pounding on his bedroom door. “Daddy! Daddy! Siri is eating all of the food. Hurry you won't be able to eat anything,” Harry James Potter, James’s son called with a little giggle. This made James calm down and smile. The wizard let out a breath and got off his bed and walked over to the door. When he opened it he saw his son’s bright green eyes, Lily’s eyes staring at him. “Pads is going to ear all of the food,” Harry said again with a smile, but James saw something in his son’s eyes, but he did not know what it was, however, he did not care at the moment. He was happy to see his son alive right in front of him. “Daddy, what is it?” the four-year-old asked when he saw tears in his father’s eyes. James though did not say anything as he pulled his son into his arms and let out a breath and laugh of relief. Confused Harry hugged his father back. though he did not know why he was doing this, but a hug is a hug. Once James pulled Harry out of his arms, Harry took his hand and pulled him out of the room. Still relieved that his son was alive, James followed him down the stairs and into the dining room. James smiled when he saw Sirius laughing at James who gave him a look.</p><p>“Harry pranked you. He got you good Prongs,” Sirius laughed making James roll his eyes and put his son into his chair and sat down next to him. “Moon is still sleeping. The full moon was a hard one. Even with us with him,” Sirius told him, but James did not say anything while he started to eat. Sirius looked at his Godson who could not turn his eyes from his father. Letting out a breath Sirius said: “James, did you have that nightmare again about that night?” James shook his head and looked to the window. Sirius sighed but he did not say anything else and started to eat again. Soon the dining room was silent, and James wished that it wasn’t.</p><p>              Remus opened his green-amber eyes and looked at his clock. The time was nine in the morning and something was not right. Nine in the morning in this house was filled with laughter and little giggles from Harry but today it was not this. Remus closed his eyes for a minute before he opened them and he knew why four years ago Lily died. With a pain-filled sigh, Remus got out of bed and walked out of the room and down the stairs and into the dining room. “Good morning Moony,” James said with a small-sad smile. Remus smiled back sat down after he ruffled Harry’s hair making the boy giggle. This lightens the mood in the house but it did not last long when James said: “Harry was dead in my dream. I don’t…………….” James cut off with tears in his eyes. Remus and Sirius watched as Harry got off his chair and wrapped his little arms around his father and held him tight. James let out a sharp breath before he hugged his son back and he was never going to let him go.</p><p>“I’m right here daddy. Mummy saved me and I’m happy that she did. Siri and Remy are still here. We are a family and Mummy is still here with us,” Harry said making James tear up more than he already is. Then in a rare moment, James started to cry, in front of his friends, no less. When this happened Sirius and Remus got off their chairs and walked over to their best friend and pulled him onto their arms as well.</p><p>“The cub is right Prongs,” Remus said once they all pulled James out of the hug. James smiled but he did not say anything. All he did was not and looked down at his son who was still holding onto his father. “Why don’t we go visit Lily?” Remus added with a smile. This made James, Sirius, and Harry nod with sad smiles. Harry looked up to his father and released his arms from him and ran out of the room. However, James stood up and pulled Harry into his arms making Harry giggle, but Remus could see something in his eyes just like James before him, However Remus did not say anything about it. Instead he said:</p><p>“Hold on cub. I think you need to eat something first and get out of your pj's,” Harry giggled again but this time it was a nervous giggle. Though no one said anything as worry formed in everyone about this.</p>
