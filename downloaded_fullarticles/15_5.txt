    <h3>March 30, 1988 - HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT &amp; WIZARDRY</h3><p>Once again, oblivious to the double-takes it caused, Barnaby Lee plunked his tray down at the table across from her.  She barely heard a characteristically snide remark from Merula, back at their own house table, before he had excitedly started to talk, hands loading up a plate as he went. The response <em> was </em> dying down, at least - though maybe that was as much a factor of the hall’s relative emptiness over Easter hols as anything else.</p><p>In fairness, it was hard <em> not </em>to do a double-take at the sight of Barnaby under the most routine of circumstances. </p><p>It had taken her close friend, Penny Haywood, five long pumps of a firm handshake and a nervous giggle to remember to introduce herself, voice an octave high, when they’d first met in Hogsmeade - and she was <em> never </em> socially awkward.</p><p>Andre had gotten all dark-eyed and full of <em> double entendres </em> when he’d been enlisted to help style Barnaby for the Celestial Ball, and she was <em> certain </em> he hadn’t had any justifiable reason to measure Barnaby a third time, or to do it by hand when his enchanted tape had simply zipped around her own body unassisted.</p><p><em> And, </em>in Herbology, she’d once seen her best friend, the typically laser-focused Rowan Khanna, drop a log covered with Leaping Toadstools on her foot when Barnaby had whipped his befouled shirt off after a nasty Bubotuber eruption.  It had taken an hour to round all the agitated Toadstools up again, and Rowan had repeatedly tripped over her own feet when the still-topless Barnaby had bounced up to her, hands full of those he retrieved himself, widely smiling and trying to help. </p><p>“...and I’m certain it’ll happen tonight!  The moon’s nearly full, but no werewolves about yet - beautiful weather but still brisk - the conditions are perfect!”</p><p>As Barnaby finished and looked at her, his grin expectant and infectious, she blinked, shaking off her reverie.  “Em, forgive me, Barns, I’m afraid I was building castles in Spain just then - could you repeat that?”</p><p>Barnaby’s jaw had dropped, eyes wide as saucers, when she looked up from loading her fork with shepherd’s pie.  She hastily put the fork down. “Barnaby? Are you alright?” She reached across the table to feel his temple, hoping he hadn’t caught some fever.</p><p>Out of some casual reflex, he caught her hand and held it to his cheek, still gazing at her in awe.  “You can sit here, eating lunch, <em> and </em> build castles in Spain <em> at the same time? </em> And drink pumpkin juice, too?”</p><p>She blinked rapidly, face momentarily blanking as she reassembled his thought process, and then she smiled, stroking his cheekbone with her thumb cheekily.  “What? No, silly, it’s a figure of speech - you know, a saying. Like,” she threw up her free hand in a searching gesture, “Like when you say you’re knackered, but you don’t mean a butcher’s actually disassembled you for the delicatessen, you’re just <em> tired </em>, you know?”</p><p>Barnaby looked at her a moment, brow furrowed, before a smile sheepishly rekindled. “Ah!  I thought it was a spell I hadn’t been clever enough to remember, or something like that.”</p><p>It was her turn to furrow her own brow.  “Barnaby, you know I <em> hate </em> to hear you talking about yourself like that.  You know as much about creatures as Hagrid and Kettleburn together, <em> and </em> you can go toe to toe with Charlie Weasley on Dragons, you just… you just have a lot of trouble focusing, sometimes,” she said, trailing off when she noticed his eyes darting off to an errant puffskein, who seemed to have lost track of its witch or wizard and was now luxuriating in a banoffee pie several yards down the table.  Shaking her head, she turned his swiveling face back to hers. “In the Muggle world, they’re developing treatments for the problem you have. I’ve read about it. In a couple years, I suspect you’ll be able to catch up on everything you may have missed.”</p><p>He blinked at her in wonder, stroking the back of her still captive hand absentmindedly.  “Do you… do you really think so? That <em> I </em>could do that?”</p><p>She nodded fervently.  “I know it. And I’ll study everything, <em> everything </em> with you again, I’ll make the Ministry let you retake exams if you need, and I’ll make sure <em> you </em> know you can do it, too. They’ve <em> finally </em>come up with a name for it that isn’t an insult to whoever’s got it, and there are medications - my Squib cousin’s on one - and maybe this summer, even, I could take you to his doctor, and -”</p><p>“Doctor?” he interjected, confused.</p><p>She shook her head, “Em, a sort of a Muggle Healer.  My cousin Dean and I are close, he told me all about how it works, he’s doing loads better in school now he’s on Ritalin.  I bet <em> anything </em> it could work for you, too.”</p><p>Barnaby looked puzzled and thoughtful for a moment, slowly nodding, before his gaze shot across the room, eyes filling with compassionate concern.  “Oh dear. Mrs. Norris is looking a little thin, isn’t she? I do hope Ismelda hasn’t <em> really </em> gone off and given her a kick, only she talks about it in the common room, and -”</p><p>Barnaby was cut off by a piercing wolf whistle as Facepaint Kid walked by and paused to thump him on the back with a sort of congratulatory air.</p><p>“Well, Lee, <em> you’re </em> nothing to write sports news about outside the dueling club, but I’d say the school’s star Chaser’s love life is <em> definitely </em> fair game for Quidditch gossip.”  He pointed between the two of them and winked.  “Good for you two crazy kids.”</p><p>She blinked in horror and snatched her hand back from where it had been cupping Barnaby’s cheek all this time, mortified.  Barnaby just looked confused. After a moment of appearing to consider his next sentence, he finally said, “Em… you have a love life?”</p><p>His voice, somehow, was smaller than usual.</p><p>She blinked and waved her hands frantically in front of her in abnegation.  “Nooooo no no no no. <em> No. </em> I do not.  Em.” She scratched her head.  “I think maybe Facepaint Kid just misinterpreted something completely innocent and 100% not related to anyone having a love life, like, whatsoever.”</p><p>Barnaby blinked back at her, clearly still confused.</p><p>She finally just smiled, shaking her head.  She knew it did get him in trouble, that it <em> did </em>give people the wrong idea about him, but she very much hoped that treating his ADHD wouldn’t take away his innocence - even if it was directly linked to what some might call his... gullibility.  </p><p>“Barnaby, remember you were trying to tell me something earlier?  Something to do with the moon?”</p><p>His face instantly lit up again.  “Yes! You’ll come with me, won’t you? After dinner, around dusk?”  Distantly, a bell tolled one o’clock, and Barnaby instantly shot out of his seat.  “Late for remedial potions, but see you then, yeah? I want you to see it!”</p><p>Before she could ask what on earth he was talking about, Barnaby had shouldered his bag, grabbed an apple, and run out the door.</p>
