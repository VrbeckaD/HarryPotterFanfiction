    <p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy has always lived a dark life. Yes, during and briefly after the war his life was dark for obvious reasons, but Draco’s life has </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span> been dark. He has never known what it’s like to feel silk caress his skin, or to count the colours that make up a sunset. All his life, he has seen nothing but shades of blacks and greys. He has felt nothing but blacks and greys. He has tasted nothing but blacks and greys. His entire life has been blacks and greys. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>As a child, his parents seeked famous mediwitches and healers alike in hopes to find a cure for his darkness. “There is always a spell or a potion” is what his father would growl every time they were given the same inconclusive answer. During the beginning they all had hope. His mother would constantly buy several different fabrics and scents, hoping that one would activate some kind of sense within him, but it never happened. His father would spends hours and hours and </span>
  <em>
    <span>hours</span>
  </em>
  <span> reading and yelling at books, determined to cure his son of whatever has caused such a sad life. This, over time, caused a divide between them. Even now, Draco isn’t sure how, but he knows when it happen. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was 1991.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Draco was living his life as he always had. Surrounded by muffled voices and blacks and greys. Blaise was talking about something absurd and Pansy was most likely painting her nails and complaining about her closet. None of them understood exactly what Draco lived like. They never really asked what it was like to only see in monochromatic. In all honesty, Draco is sure they didn’t really care. He was figure head to them, after all he is a Malfoy. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It first happened when he was looking at the door of their cart, and a flicker happened. Just a short flicker, but not any flicker. Not like if you were to turn off a light, or a candle in the dark. This was an amazing flicker. A kaleidoscope of colours hit him for barely second, but it colours and noises and smells. It was the most wonderous second of his life.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He remembers yelling, and smiling and look at his friends with widest and most goofy grin on his face because he seen and felt what they live everyday. He wasn’t in the dark for that one second, he was normal. He was not Draco or a Malfoy, he was normal boy who seen reds, and blues and greens. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Did you see that? All those… those colours? Did you--did you smell it?” He can still see the confused expressions on his friends faces. The way Pansy tilted her head and smiled so oddly, as if he had two heads. And Blaise, Blaise just laughed and shook his head. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And that was last time he flickered until </span>
  <em>
    <span>Madame Malkin's Robe shop</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>He was in the middle of bragging about he could get his father to buy him anything. Of course, no one exactly knew why Lucius Malfoy would buy his son anything. How could his father say no to his only child who can’t experience life in colour? His peers were hanging on to every word he said, and he was loving the attention because it wasn’t about his sight or his tastes or his sense of smell, it was just about him being fortunate to get anything he wanted. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And then he flickered. He lost his train of thought within the light show of colours and smells around him. He could see the different shade of eye colour that were staring at him. He could smell the old wood of floor, and fabrics around him. He could hear clearly, there was no longer with invisible wall that separated his ears from the voices of those around him.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That time lasted longer than it did on the train, but it still didn’t last long enough. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>After that, it happened over and over for many years, even during the darkest times with the Dark Lord and losing Snape, he still had these amazing and wonderful flickers. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>And then they were gone. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Until August, 14th at 16:54 2018 when Harry Potter walked into his shop. </span>
