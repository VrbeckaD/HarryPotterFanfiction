    <p align="center">"When gentlemen of a certain age fall in love, they get the disease very badly."</p><p align="center">Miss Marple, <em>The Moving Finger</em></p><p align="center">---</p><p>"She CURSED me, Cissy." Bellatrix Black collapsed against the Georgian chair that her brother in law, Lucius Malfoy, had liberated from a muggle second hand shop. Not that the muggle had known what he'd had with the carved walnut. Narcissa Malfoy, nee Black, felt her left eye twitch at the vociferous complaint of two hundred fifty year old wood beneath her sister's forcible landing.</p><p>"She landed a Cruciatus on you?" Narcissa stirred her tea, the soft click of her tea spoon against the Royal Doulton doing more to soothe her jangled nerves than a calming draught.</p><p>"What? No. She called me a heinous she bitch from hell."</p><p>Narcissa sighed heavily and set down her teacup. It wouldn't do to lose another of the set. The periwinkle set only had five left after one of her son's playmates had been over. Goyle? Crabbe? One of the louts.</p><p>"She held her wand up and looked me right in the eye and-" Bellatrix sighed deeply, her form melting against the chair's arm with a languid relaxation that left her looking nothing like the lady that their mother had tried so hard to mould her into. "It's her, Cissy."</p><p>Narcissa closed her eyes, inhaling and exhaling in a slow, measured breath. "Do you know her name, at least? And do try to sit properly, this isn't a sleepover in the dorms for Merlin's sake."</p><p>Waving a hand negligently, Bellatrix dismissed Narcissa's concern. "Doesn't feel right to sit elseways. No. She was with that Potter brat, I'm fairly certain she's that muddy we've heard tell about."</p><p>Narcissa pressed two fingers to her temple and quietly called. "Nimby." With a soft pop, her personal house elf appeared. "Do be a dear and fetch Draco here at his earliest convenience." A deep bow indicated the acceptance of her command, and within a breath more, Draco popped into view before them.</p><p>"Hello Mother. Aunt Bella." Dipping his head in deference to his aunt, Draco Malfoy turned to his mother with a bow nearly as deep as that of the house elf that had popped back out as soon as completing Narcissa's request. "What may I do for you today, mother?"</p><p>"Do come sit with us and cease your tomfoolery. I swear, you become more like your grandfather every day." Narcissa gestured to the other end of the brocade settee upon which she sat. With an impish grin, he took the proffered spot and accepted his mother's offering of tea. "It appears your aunt has been afflicted with that most serious of complaints." Narcissa took a sip of her tea, allowing her son to puzzle over her words for a moment. "It appears, my dragon, that your aunt has fallen in love."</p><p>Draco's eyebrows near flew to heights hitherfore unknown as his head snapped back and forth between the two of them. It was not unknown to him for his aunt to have dalliances, or even some gone so far as to be termed companions, but for a confirmed bachelor such as she to fall in love? His mind boggled and he took a bracing gulp of his tea as his mind whirled, attempting to puzzle who might have caught his aunt's eye. His mother watched him, her expression giving no hint to why his aunt reclined so forlornly in her chair.</p><p>"I...see." He set his cup down on the low table before them. He had a feeling this would not be something he could risk his mother's favorite Royal Doulton for - especially as the only time he could recall her going somewhere new recently was the incursion at the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>"Indeed." Narcissa leveled a stern glare upon her sister. "Do tell him who it is, Bella."</p><p>Bellatrix sighed deeply, her foot bouncing lightly in the air as she leaned her head back against the armrest of her chair. "Hermione."</p><p>Draco stared at his aunt for a long moment as his mind scrambled to find any other Hermione he'd ever heard of, desperately -</p><p>"You remember, dear, you complained about how she was everywhere during third year."</p><p>At his mother's words, Draco's mind screeched to a halt. "Hermione Granger."</p><p>Bellatrix sighed again, her head lolling to the side to meet Draco's stunned gaze directly. "Yes."</p><p>"The mudblood."</p><p>A negligent shrug met his flat tone. "Nobody's perfect."</p><p>It took a short while further before his brain kicked into gear again, during which he sat staring dumbstruck at his aunt. She was decidedly nonchalant about the entire thing, her foot kicking idly in the air. He looked over at his mother for succor, only to be met with a resignation he was not used to finding upon her visage. It was enough to jolt him from his stupor. "Mother?"</p><p>"I'm afraid, my boy, this is altogether not unheard of in our family. The Blacks have been known to...acquire...strong bloodlines from the most esoteric sources." She released a barely audible breath, resting her temple against two fingers. "I believe you have heard tell of some of the more esoteric tales from your study of the family history. Do you recall the story of Maia and her sisters?"</p><p>The answer emerged with barely a thought. The lessons had been extensive. "With her six sisters, they swept through all suitors until one Samhain when Maia was the first to fall, followed closely by each of her sisters in turn."</p><p>Bellatrix snorted a derisive laugh. "You're still on about that half truth, Cissy? The proper telling is far more entertaining."</p><p>Draco looked to his mother curiously. A muscle twitched in her cheek as she clenched her jaw. "I was about to tell him, Bella. Hush." Huffing indignantly, Bellatrix waved her hand for Narcissa to continue. Rolling her eyes at her sister's antics, Narcissa turned back to her son. "Maia and her sisters were felled quickly, but not in battle."</p><p>"Too right, they fell in love."</p><p>"Do shut up, Bella, I'm explaining why your paramour is acceptable." Narcissa continued glaring at her sister as she continued. "Maia and her sisters had long held themselves apart from others, having vowed on their parents honor to never accede to any they did not love, as it was in love that their strength lay." Narcissa smoothed back the hair at Draco's temple, flattening some of his wild locks. "That Samhain was the end of lengthy battles, ones which had taken many and threatened to eradicate the magical bloodlines entirely. A peace summit was declared, to be celebrated in a week long celebration. Each of the seven days brought with it a different clan, a different family, and on each of those days, one of the sisters found themselves utterly and completely felled by a sudden and overwhelming love. It was through these relationships that the first great wizarding families were founded, and-"</p><p>"What your mother is trying to talk around is that-"</p><p>"Bella, I swear by all that is holy in this world, I will-"</p><p>"But GRANGER?!" The rising squabble between the sisters was summarily halted by the risen voice of the young Malfoy heir as he kept staring back and forth between his mother and aunt. "Granger. Golden Trio Granger. Best friend of the Dark Lord's sworn nemesis Harry Potter, Granger." At his mother's helpless shrug and his aunt's negligent hand wave, his voice rose again, to near hysterical tones. "Self avowed proud as punch Muggleborn Gryffindor Princess, Granger?!"</p><p>"It's not like she'd be the first in the Black family, honestly now."</p><p>Draco collapsed back against the settee, his trembling hand rising to cover his eyes. "My aunt is a cradle robbing mudblood lover."</p><p>A dark cackle rose in the lounge, the vicious grin audible in the midnight tone. "That's your future aunt you're talking about."</p>
