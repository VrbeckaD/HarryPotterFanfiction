  </strong>
  <strong>:  This is a collection of drabbles in which Amelia Bones is alive and married to Minerva McGonagall.  It is AU.  The drabbles span the month before Hogwarts reopens, thus August after the Final Battle.  There are only staff and faculty at the school right now.  Minerva is the headmistress of Hogwarts, and Amelia is the professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts.  The drabbles will be chronological but otherwise will be able to stand alone.  They are being written purely to allow my favorite OTP to have some much deserved fun.  They will be fluffy and naughty, thus the rating.  Warnings will be included if necessary.  By the way, the book referenced in this drabble does not exist, either in canon or in real life.  </strong>

<p>            “Find anything interesting?”</p>
<p>            Minerva jumped, and her hand automatically reached for her wand until she realized that it was only Amelia standing there in Flourish and Blotts beside her.  Cursing the blush that spread across her face, she tried to hide the book in her hand from Amelia.  But Amelia had auror instincts on her side and snatched it before Minerva could conceal it. </p>
<p>            “<u>No Wizards Necessary:  The Magic of Witches Loving Witches</u>,” she read much louder than she should have. </p>
<p>            Minerva drew her wand to cast a hasty silencing charm, but Amelia caught her hand and shook her head, chuckling.</p>
<p>            “Really, Min, you’ve got to get over this!  The entire wizarding world knows we’re married.”</p>
<p>            Minerva only blushed more.  “Be that as it may, I’d rather not share our love life with everyone in the vicinity,” she hissed, trying to cover her discomfiture.</p>
<p>            “Then why are you here in this very public place buying this very naughty book?”  Amelia’s grin took the sting out of her words.</p>
<p>            Minerva stumbled over her answer, a rarity for the well-spoken witch.  “I just thought now would be a good time for me to…to make sure that I knew enough to keep you interested!”</p>
<p>            Amelia’s blue eyes softened.  “Oh Min, do you really think you don’t know enough?  You are always enough for me.”</p>
<p>            Minerva desperately tried to pull herself together.  “Well, it never hurts to learn a little more,” she said briskly.</p>
<p>            Amelia rested a hand low on Minerva’s hip, and the elder witch’s breath hitched.</p>
<p>            “So have you learned anything new so far?” Amelia whispered in her ear. </p>
<p>            Minerva swallowed hard.  She took a steadying breath.  “Shall I show you?”</p>
<p>            Amelia smirked.  “Those are daring words, Minerva.  I don’t think you have it in you.”</p>
<p>            Minerva wasn’t a brave Gryffindor for nothing.  As it happened, she did recall a page from the book in question that she had been reading when Amelia caught her.</p>
<p>            “Public displays of affection are not quite proper, but they can be enjoyable especially if the parties involved have never indulged in them before,” the book had said.</p>
<p>            That infuriating smirk on Amelia’s lips sealed the deal.</p>
<p>            Startling her wife, Minerva twisted around and took advantage of the extra height she had on Amelia to push the smaller woman back against the wall.  Minerva pinned the stunned witch’s wrists beneath her own even as she caught Amelia’s lips in a hungry kiss.  Teeth and tongues tangled together as she covered her wife’s body with her own, grinding against her in a way that she rarely did even in private and had never dreamed of doing in public.</p>
<p>            When she finally released Amelia, it was Minerva’s turn to smirk at the shock on her wife’s face.</p>
<p>            “I stand corrected,” Amelia said breathlessly.  “But perhaps we should take this somewhere else?”</p>
<p>            “Or perhaps not,” Minerva said and kissed her again.</p>
<p>            Unbeknownst to them, they gave the shopkeeper quite an eyeful.</p>
