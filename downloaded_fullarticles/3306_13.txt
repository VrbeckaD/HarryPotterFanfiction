  <em> WONDER SEEKER POTTER MAKES A MOVE TO GERMANY TO JOIN THE MUNICH MADDOGS: </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The shock that travelled through the Quidditch world following Harry Potter’s announced departure from the Wimbourne Wasps intensified as the young seeker declared his newest destination was Germany, rather than another team within the British league. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The British talent renowned for his broom control, high-speed flight and excellent technique released a statement through his agent, James Potter, who claimed the Seeker who carried the Wasps to their first league title in ten years wanted a change of scenery. Many people who thought Potter would remain as the team’s centre point for the next few years, particularly to maintain their title defence, were proven wrong as talks went down with Karl Schneider, the manager of the Maddogs to ensure a transfer. The transfer was finalised yesterday morning. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Potter’s move to Germany inspired much controversy as well as interest. Fans of the long-declining Wasps who were delighted by the sudden rejuvenation of the team claimed they would send Potter a curse by mail for his ‘betrayal’. Potter’s teammates, including Irish Chaser Seamus Finnigan, claimed that the team “were bloody surprised and disappointed by his decision”. A new question also rose from the transfer- what will happen to Viktor Krum? </em>

  <em> The famous Bulgarian Seeker, now thirty four, is known as the best Seeker of all time. However, what will Potter’s arrival in Munich do to his position on the team? No doubt there will be much competition for the starting spot in the team’s matches. Gwenog Jones, the former captain and Seeker of the Holyhead Harpies, stated that ‘Potter has a high chance of making it onto the first team, Krum isn’t as young as he was and Potter has just won a league title. He’s a prodigy and a popular one.” Draco Malfoy, the Seeker of the Quiberon Quafflepunchers, however, stated that “Potter has no chance of making it onto the first team in place of the best Seeker in the world. He was deluded to make the move.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No doubt there will be keen eyes on Harry Potter’s transition in Germany, and the inevitable rivalry between Krum and Potter. Fortunately, Potter will have a fellow English face to turn to should he have teething problems within the team- Ron Weasley, Keeper, stated that “he would gladly welcome Harry to the team and would do his best to make him comfortable.” </em>
