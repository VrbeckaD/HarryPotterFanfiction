  <b>~Malfoy Manor~ </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco stared up into the sky wondering what he had done to become one of Lady Luck’s playthings. Between him and Potter they had some of the best and worst luck he had ever seen. Really, it had taken a downward spiral since the Ministry incident in fifth year. The Dark Lord had been furious at his father for his failure there. Then, the Mad Dark One had murdered his mother for trying to keep him from having to take the Dark Mark. Draco was furious, which caused him to fail the tests needed for Snake Face to consider him for his ranks. The final straw to place him in his current condition was Severus “accidentally” ruining a patch of poisons His Royal Darkness needed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So Draco was outside. He had been spending more time on the grounds of his family's land. His wolf seemed to like it. After the latest “failure” from Severus, Voldemort had decided to make an example of him, Draco, and Lucius. All three had been given to Fenrir Greyback. However, instead of tearing them all to shreds, Fenrir had shifted and turned them all. Life had been interesting after that. Now that the Malfoy family was “disgraced”, Voldemort had moved on to a new Manor. This had allowed Lucius to invite the whole of Greyback’s pack to live on the Malfoy’s land of which they had plenty to spare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco had discovered a great deal in the short time since being turned. One, Fenrir was nothing like the vicious rumours about the man. The man truly cared about his pack and the welfare of all werewolves. Two, he had turned them because they were powerful and useful. All three had become Dominant wolves, but not Alphas. Fenrir promised to help them find mates. Three, Fenrir had originally joined the Dark Lord because he was promised equality for dark creatures once Voldemort was ruling Great Britain. Now Greyback wasn’t so sure the insane man would keep his word. Not that he was turning light, mind you. That side was still fully against their kind. Neither was he fully in line with Voldemort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>These things are what led them to where they are now. Lucius had the political power to start making sure werewolves and other dark creatures were treated better. He was also better motivated to do so by being one himself. Severus was now devoting much of his time into researching a cure, or at least a way to be less at war with the wolf side of their nature. He had dragged Draco, who was a potion prodigy, into helping him. Draco had only had one full moon since his turning. However, just that one night with all the other wolves had brought him closer to them than he had ever been with most of his schoolmates. It was a weird yet comforting feeling. He was only sad that he hadn’t found his mate. Ok, so his wolf was sad, but he felt strangely in tune with his wolf.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco” he heard calling from behind him, “I think I have found the answer”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>~Number 4~</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was in a world of pain. He had been forced back to the Dursleys yet again at the end of the school year. He was desolate at the loss of Sirius. Every night was plagued with nightmares and every day was more chores and abuse. This particular beating was courtesy of him having a nightmare hallucination while cleaning, causing him to break one of Petunia’s vases. Vernon had taken great pleasure in beating him senseless. He had woken up hours later with a concussion, several broken ribs, and he thought he might be bleeding internally. Moving very slowly and with so much effort he blacked out twice, Harry got his D.A. galleon from under the loose floorboard under his bed. He was able to send a quick SOS before succumbing once more to blackness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>~Grimmauld Place~</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione was pacing furiously in her room at Order Headquarters. Just moments ago she had felt her pocket warm up and discovered her D.A. galleon glowing fiercely. It was blood red, the color for immediate danger and the magical signature was Harry’s. Hermione was frantic trying to determine what to do. Which of the adults would even believe her. “Oh, this galleon is informing me Harry is in trouble” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Yeah right!</span>
  </em>
  <span> She stopped suddenly. Remus would believe her. That wolf would do anything to keep his cub safe. She needed someone else from the D.A. as well. Ron wasn’t a great choice, he was still dealing with the effects of the brain tentacle things in the DOM. There was also the fact things were still strained since the fourth year and the tournament. Honestly, her three best choices were Neville, Ginny, or Luna as all three were in the building and honestly cared for Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She grabbed her emergency stash, which was a beaded bag full of potions, money, clothes, food and even a tent. As she left the room, she wasn’t surprised to find Luna in the hallway her usual airy expression gone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He needs us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione had stopped questioning how Luna knew things she shouldn’t years ago. Their little group had learned to trust and follow her bouts of insight. Harry and Neville were probably the only two who truly understood her unusual way of speaking. Hermione grabbed Luna by the arm as they went in search of Remus. They found him in the library, and quickly explained the situation to him. The three slipped out of Grimmauld Place with attracting any attention and Remus apparated them all to Privet Drive a little ways away from Number 4.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>~Number 4~</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After popping in, Remus moved to where Mundungus was supposed to be keeping watch. He found the disgusting thief asleep. Waking him, Remus sent him on his way, saying it was his turn to take watch. Once Dung apparated away, Remus motioned the girls to follow him. Hermione cast a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Revelio</span>
  </em>
  <span> on the house, allowing them to discover there was only one occupant. An </span>
  <em>
    <span>Alohamora</span>
  </em>
  <span> moved them inside and they followed the spell up to the second floor. Remus struggled to hold back Moony as he saw the seven locks and cat flap on the door his cub was behind. Using his strength, he merely ripped the door from its frame. Both girls screamed at the sight before them. Harry was unconscious on the floor, laying in a pool of blood, vomit, and other bodily fluids. Remus cast several spells in rapid succession to clean Harry and the floor of the mess before levitating Harry up and stripping him so that Luna and Hermione could begin to work. All three had tears in their eyes as Luna began pouring potions into Harry and Hermione was using Dittany on his many wounds to seal them up. After they got the bleeding taken care of, they realized none of them was trained enough to cast diagnostic spells on Harry to see if there was more damage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We need to get him to Poppy” Remus was pacing still trying to contain his rage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She would only tell Dumbledore, who would send Harry right back here. Just like he has every summer”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus looked at Hermione aghast. “You mean he knew. How long has this been going on?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Luna looked over at Harry. “Since he was six. His relatives are hounded by nargles and blibbering humdingers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We need to get him somewhere and soon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about his cousin Andromeda? She is a healer at St. Mungo’s, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus’ eyes flashed amber. “That’s right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that they made plans to move Harry. However, as they stepped outside, all four were hit with stunners from all sides. The last thought Remus had was as he smelled a scent and his mind screamed </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Alpha!”</span>
