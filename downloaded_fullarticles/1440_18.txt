    <p>“YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!” Akkochan screamed on her wathere  down from the tower, broom in hand. Suddenly, she was sucked out of the sky by a magical spell, making her floart down gently. She looked at the ground incredulously, then at her savior.</p>
<p>	“Who are you?” she said, incredulously. “I’m Karl Marx,” said the young man, incredulously. “I’m from the wizarding school next door, Hogwarts. And you are?” Akko puffed her chest out proudly, but incredulously. “I’m Atsuko Kagari, but you can call me Akko!”</p>
<p>	“I see. Well, Akko, what were you even doing up there?” Akko was incredulous and embarassed. “I’m sorry to say, I can’t even fly my broom properly...”</p>
<p>	“Have you tried shoving it up your ass? It works better if you do that.” Akko was incredulous. “Holy shit, I never thought about!” she said before incredulously shoving her broom up her bunghole, the brush sticking out like a tail. Suddenly, she started floating in midair. “It worked! Thanks, Karl Marx!”</p>
<p>	“No problem!” said Karl. “By the way, I’m a cummunist.” Akko floated back down to the ground. “A cummunist? Wassat?”</p>
<p>	“You see, Akko, a cummunist believes the means of stimulation should belong to the workers. To each according to their need for cummies, from each according to their ability to produce cummies! Cummies are a basic human right, you know.”</p>
<p>	“Oh wow! That’s neato!” said Akko. “You think so?” replied Marx, incredulously. “I’m glad. You see, the actual reason I was here at Lunar Nova was to start a chapter of our Cummunist Party at your school! How would you like to be a founding member of the Luna Nova Cummunist Party?”</p>
<p>	“Boy would I!” Akko explasmed incredulously. “How do I get started?” Karl Marks threw a book at her. “OW! What the FUCK, bro?!”</p>
<p>	“It’s our Cummunist Manifesto, that’s what the fuck. It also has various works by our fellow cummunists, such as Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Read it front to back! I also have this crate full of pamphlets and posters to distribute." He incredulously shoved a box towarr Akko. "Use them well, cumrade!" Then he shoved his broomstick up his ass incredulously and flew off into the night. "Fare thee well, Akkochan!" he said incredulously, flying off into the afternoon sky.</p>
<p>	"Okay, then, let's get started!" said Akkochan, before running into the main building excitedly and incredulously.</p>
