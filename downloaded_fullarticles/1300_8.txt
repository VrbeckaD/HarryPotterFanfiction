  <b>Prologue:  </b>
</p><p> </p><p>It was a beautiful spring day. The first of many mild weathered days with the sun shining on the grounds and twinkling across the grass. But no children played outside. There was no laughter, no sunbathing on the fields of Hogwarts nor mischievous children throwing stones into the lake to agitate the Giant Squid. Sybill watched the quiet scene with sadness from her tower window. A school should never be this melancholy. Even the Forest was despondent as animals hid from the increasing darkness they could sense. </p><p>Such a tragedy such innocent freedom and happiness was torn from the students. They were all forced to mature too soon.</p><p>It was as Sybill was hoping the situation would change for the better that she felt a sensation of chills flowing down her spine as a heat wave flowed from her stomach to the tips of her fingers. She could feel her mind clouding over and only hoped she hadn’t drank too much today right before she lost consciousness.</p><p>No one was around to watch Sybill Trelawney’s back straightened to attention as her pupils dilated, or watch when spoke as if possessed by a spirit. No one heard but they could feel. Those on the frontlines, the children still in Hogwarts, magical and un-magical beings alike could feel the shift in the air like a cool wind sweeping across their backs. The world had changed. They just were not aware how much yet.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The false prophecies will soon be at an end </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The arrival of the Riddick marks the beginning of a new era. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Where worlds are torn asunder and order is restored </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The lights shall merge to become a beacon </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Bow to the Furyan King </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Bow to the one who walks with Death </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Bow to the one who walks with Darkness </em>
</p><p>
  <em> For they hold the true key to the salvation of all ‘verses. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Death to the parasites. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Death to the Elementals. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Death to the Malevolence </em>
</p><p>
  <em> For their crime against Fate and Death </em>
</p><p>
  <em> May they not rest in peace. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry shivered and unconsciously turned his head towards the direction of Hogwarts. He had a very bad feeling about the next few months.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
