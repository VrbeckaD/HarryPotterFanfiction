    <p>Chapter 1<br/>
Sarcasm </p><p>“Hurry the fuck up Bell! We’re going to be late!”</p><p>“I’m trying there’s to many people”!</p><p>My friend and I are running through Digon Alley because we needed to do some last minute shopping for Hogwarts. My name is Isabella but everyone calls me bell or bella. How do I even begin to explain myself? I’m a metamorphosis and I’m Harry Potter’s twin sister, though I look nothing like him. I have pointy ears and eyes that change color like my hair. I’m pale and I have two piercings in each of my ears. So yeah it’s pretty much impossible to miss me.</p><p>That’s when I ran into something hard. “Damn”! I say aloud as I fell.</p><p>“Watch were your going”! Some blonde boy sneered as he got up. </p><p>“Sorry I’d rather look at the ground than your face” I bluntly responded.   </p><p>“Who do you think your talking to you rude little mudblood”!</p><p>“I’m not rude, I just have the balls to say something when no one else does”. </p><p>He sighed ignoring my remark “Apologies, Malfoy. Draco Malfoy” he extended his hand to me. I couldn’t decide if it was sincere or not.</p><p>With very much exaggeration I shook his hand “Potter. Bella Potter” I mocked him.</p><p>He looked shocked “No you’re not you’re lying” he said.</p><p>“Whatever you say buddy”. I responded.</p><p>“Wait, if you’re really a Potter show me your scar”  he demanded.</p><p>I moved my long purple curly hair to the side and showed him the lighting scar on the side of my neck.</p><p>“Woah. You really are” he said.</p><p>“Obviously” I said.</p><p>“So-“ He was cut off “shit I have to catch up to my friend I’ll see you at school then” I say as I run away to find my friend Mila.</p><p> </p><p>***Time Skip***</p><p> </p><p>“Why the bloody hell are we always somewhere at the wrong time”! I exclaimed. Mila and I are in the train station early by a lot of time.</p><p>“Well I’d explain it to you but I’m out of puppets and crayons” Mila said. I snorted. We joke around like this often.</p><p>“Ya know, you make me wish I had more middle fingers” I said.</p><p>“It’s a bird, it’s a plane, no wait it’s the flying fuck I don’t give” she said.</p><p>“I think I’m emotionally constipated, because I haven’t given a shit in days”. I said.</p><p>“Bella”? Someone asked and I was tapped  on the shoulder. </p><p>I turned and saw Harry. “Harry”! I smiled and gave him a hug. We don’t live together so I don’t see him often.</p><p> </p><p>“I missed you” I say. “I missed you to”.</p><p>“Bella”? A familiar voice says.</p><p>“Draco”.</p><p>“Hi do you want to sit with my friends and I in our compartment on the train, they can come to” He gestures to Harry and Mila. Mila didn’t like Harry at all.</p><p>“No she doesn’t” Harry cuts in for me. </p><p>“Quick Harry check you’re face because I think I just found you’re nose in my business” I state. I can make my own decisions thanks.</p><p>Harry just glared at him. “Sure Draco I’ll sit with you” I look to Mila to ask her if she wants to go when she says “I’ll come to”.</p><p>The train whistle blew.  “Harry you can sit with us if you want but you don’t have to” I saw to him. </p><p>“If you want to be friends with them” he said pointing to Draco and Mila “than fine but don’t come crawling back to me when they make you upset” he said and stormed away. </p><p> </p><p>If only that would be the last fight I was in this year then things would be perfect, but I’m a bitch, and life’s an army of em.</p>
