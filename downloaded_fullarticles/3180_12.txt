          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus threads his fingers through the autumn leaves that litter the forest floor, searching. He can feel the vibrations emanating from the object, like a beacon. He’d overheard Potter speak of it once, of using it to see his loved ones briefly. One chance is all Severus needs.</p><p>His index finger snags on a sharp edge, sending a surge of energy up his arm. Quickly, he digs until the muddied gem lies in his palm. He cleans it off, twists it thrice, closes his eyes and waits.</p><p>Utter stillness descends on the patch of wooded area where Severus is kneeling. He hears the crackle of desiccated leaves crunch under someone’s feet. When Severus opens his eyes, the shadowy figure of Remus Lupin stands before him, looking much healthier than he did in life.</p><p>Severus whispers, “Take me with you.”</p><p>Remus drifts a ghostly hand over Severus’ cheek, sorrow in his gaze. “It’s not your time, yet.”</p><p>Anguish fills Severus. “Just because I let you go doesn’t mean that I wanted to!”</p><p>“Another example of your love for me,” Remus says fondly. “You must let me go again.”</p><p>“Leave then, you wretched wolf.”</p><p>“I’ll wait for you.”</p><p>“Not for long,” Severus promises.</p></div>
