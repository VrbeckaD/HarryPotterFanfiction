    <p>Disclaimer: I don't own anything that you recognise.</p><p>Hela, Goddess of Death looked at the woman in front of her with narrowed eyes. She was allowed to sent souls back to Midgard to haunt a place, but the souls had to file a request and this one was very peculiar. "Let me see if I have everything straight for a minute. You lost your child during life and now you want to haunt the village that you lived in and every time that someone sees you, you want to kill an innocent child?" She asked, her voice incredulous.</p><p>The other woman, Jennet Humfrye, simply nodded in answer. "Yes, your majesty. They did nothing when I lost my child and I want them to feel my pain." She said, anger and hate in her voice and on her pale, rotten face. Hela raised an eyebrow, looking at the parchment in her hands and reading the name of the place that Jennet wanted to haunt: Eel Marsh House. Looking up, she threw the parchment to the side. "Request denied." She said strongly, standing up from her throne.</p><p>Jennet looked up in shock, starting to protest. Hela simply held up a hand to stop her. "I may be the Goddess of Death, but hurting innocent children is something that even I won't do." She said, just as she noticed Odin stepping into the room. She motioned with her hand and guards led the other woman out, despite her protestations. She turned to Odin, wondering what he was for. </p><p>It turned out that Odin had an offer for her. A mortal wizard was going to cause a lot of pain and havoc in a few years and Odin wanted Hela to stop him. Is she succeeded, she would go to Valhalla. After thinking for a few minutes, the queen agreed to help. Odin sent a bolt of magic towards her and she disappeared. The king of Asgard sighed deeply. He had seen a lot of grief and pain in her future and he hoped that she was strong enough to keep her end of the deal. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Eight year old Helen Graves was sleeping peacefully in her bed, when she was woken up by a scream of pain that came from downstairs. She got out of bed and carefully walked downstairs. She saw an unfamiliar man forcing her adoptive father, Percival Graves to the ground. The man saw her and looked like a child on Christmas. "Well, what do we have here?" He purred. Percival tried to get up, but the man kicked him down again.</p><p>"Leave her alone, you bastard!" Percival growled, his parental instincts going haywire at seeing Grindelwald so close to his daughter. The dark wizard simply smirked, before pulling Helen closer with his magic and grabbing her arm tightly. "Daddy?" Helen whimpered, scared and confused, as Grindelwald pushed her towards her father. Percival held her and tried to comfort her, but his options were limited.</p><p>Grindelwald simply smirked at Percival. "This is how things are going to be: if you don't want you precious little girl to be hurt, you better tell me everything that you know." He threatened, pointing his wand towards Helen. Seeing no other option, Percival agreed. Grindelwald locked him up in his own basement, easily dodging Helen's attempt to kick him.</p><p>"Let my daddy go or I'll hurt you!" She demanded, trying to look intimidating, but Grindelwald simply laughed. "Listen here, dearie. The day that I wil be scared of you is the day that I lose my magic. Now, you either be a good girl or your dear daddy is going to suffer." He threatened. Helen quickly surrendered, not wanting her father to get hurt The next few weeks were absolutely terrible for father and daughter.</p><p>Grindelwald was impersonating Percival at MACUSA and nobody noticed a thing. Grindelwald put the Imperius curse on Helen when he had guests and the girl often lay awake at night, having to listen to her father's screams of pain as Grindelwald tortured him for information. Tears in her eyes, she tried to block the sound out, but was unable to. It was quite a relief, when Grindelwald was finally found out and aurors stormed into the apartment.</p><p>Helen quickly pointed them towards the basement and an unconscious Percival was quickly sent to the hospital to heal. When the man woke up, he instantly asked after his daughter. She was mostly fine, except for the trauma that the situation had caused. The healer commented about how she was a brave girl and Percival felt a surge of pride at that. He sighed in relief at hearing that she was alright </p><p>Once they were finally reunited, father and daughter hugged each other tightly for several minutes, relieved that the other was safe. "I was so scared, daddy." Helen whimpered. Percival gently shushed her. "It's alright, Helen. I'm here now and we're both safe." He said, softly stroking her hair. Helen buried her face in his chest and took a deep breath, closing her eyes at feeling her father's arms around her. Little did they know that they wouldn't be safe forever</p><p>It was in the hospital that Percival met Newt Scamander, the man responsible for Grindelwald's arrest. Percival invited him for a cup of coffee, once he was out of the hospital to thank him and Newt shyly agreed. One cup became several and he two men started dating. Helen liked him very quickly, seeing that he made her daddy very happy. She quickly started to call Newt "papa", much to his surprise.</p><p>Percival and Newt married a few years later, a year after Helen started Ilvermorny and was sorted into the Wampus house. Newt quickly saw Helen as his own daughter. Things were very good for the family, until just after Helen's sixteenth birthday. Grindelwald was back in America and he wanted revenge. He broke through the wards, while the family was spending time in the yard with Newt's brother Theseus.</p><p>Percival and Newt immediately jumped up and shared a look, before looking at Theseus. They had discussed what they would do if Grindelwald ever returned. Newt refused to leave Percival behind, so they had given Helen a portkey that would teleport her to where Theseus lived and away from her fathers, no matter how much it hurt the men to send her away. They would rather die than have their daughter in danger.</p><p>Theseus looked very reluctant, but eventually nodded, just as Percival and Newt managed to blast Grindelwald back for a few seconds. "Daddy? Papa?" Helen said, sounding so much like her eight year old self that Percival felt his heart shatter. "We love you, Helen. We love you so much and we are so proud of you. Don't ever forget that." He said, before giving Theseus a look. The man reluctantly grabbed his niece's arm</p><p>Taking one final look towards his little brother said the word to activate the portkey, both of them disappearing. Newt and Percival briefly squeezed each other's hand, before going to face Grindelwald and his group of followers. They fought bravely, but were eventually outnumbered and defeated by Grindelwald's men. After the duel, Grindelwald stepped forwards and looked at the bound men.</p><p>"Where is your daughter, Percy?" He growled, having seen her becoming very powerful in a vision and wanting to have that power. Percival simply glared at him. "I'll never tell you." He growled. He would not let the dark wizard get close to his daughter ever again. Grindelwald simply raised an eyebrow, before shrugging in reply. "Suit yourself." He muttered, before coldly killing both men. After that, he and his followers disappeared. </p><p>The second that Theseus and Helen landed outside of the former's home, the young witch instantly collapsed and fell to her knees. She felt her chest burn as she realised that she had just lost her parents forever and would never see them again. Theseus held his niece as the girl sobbed her heart out, tears rolling over his own cheeks. He had just lost his little brother, but he would not let his sacrifice be in vain. He would do his best to protect his niece</p><p>Theseus homeschooled Helen for her last year, getting her a new wand, since her old wand was still at Ilvermorny as students were not allowed to take them home until they graduated. Almost a year to that horrible day, Helen got her memories from her past life back and she hated herself. She was the Goddess of Death and she couldn't even save the people that she loved. She only told Theseus about it and the man sighed, but eventually accepted her. </p><p>Two years later, Theseus got information that Grindelwald was hiding in a land house that was close to a muggle town. He took the file home, where Helen was cleaning things up from the attic to keep herself busy. She was just getting a black dress from her great grandmother out of a box, when Theseus opened the door to the room. The door made a horrible, high pitched, screeching noise, which made uncle and niece wince. Theseus quickly flicked his wand to solve the problem.</p><p>"Grindelwald has been spotted in a small, muggle town near the coast in Ireland." He said, giving the file to her. Even though the information was actually confidential, he thought that she deserved to know what was going on. "What is Grindelwald doing so close to England?" Helen asked with a raised eyebrow. Theseus simply shrugged in answer, before going to the kitchen to start making lunch. </p><p>Helen kept reading the file, until something caught her attention.<em> 'Place of operations: Eel Marsh House'</em> the small bit of information read. Her mind going back to the soul of Jennet Humfrye, an idea slowly started to form in Helen's head. She remembered what Grindelwald had said to her, the day that he had kidnapped her father. <em>"The day that I'm scared of you is the day that I will lose my magic."</em> The dark wizard's voice echoed in her head. </p><p>Putting down the file, Helen picked up the black dress from before and held it in front of her, conjuring up a mirror in the process. The dress seemed to fit her and it came with matching gloves plus hat and veil. Helen moved her hand over her face and used her magic to make it look as deceased and rotten as the face of Jennet's soul had been. "I will get my revenge, Gellert Grindelwald. Even if it's the last thing that I do." She vowed darkly, vengeance in her eyes. </p>
