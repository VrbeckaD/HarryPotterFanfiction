<p>"Uh, no they're not." Strand of Hair argues. "You're just a big fat scardy toothbrush."</p>
<p>"Calm down bros." Broccoli and Cheese Soup buts in. </p>
<p>"I will NoT cAlM dOwN yOu UgLy piECe Of dEFoRmeD cAbbAgE!!!" Strand of Hair screeched.</p>
<p>Broccoli and Cheese Soup has had enough of Strand of Hair and Toenail arguing. They always push Broccoli and Cheese Soup around. This has to stop, and it's going to stop now! </p>
<p>As Broccoli and Cheese Soup goes and raises their wand at them, Toenail asks in fright, "Broccoli and Cheese Soup, what are you doing with your wand?"</p>
<p>But Broccoli and Cheese Soup isn't listening.</p>
<p>"Avada-" Broccoli and Cheese Soup started.</p>
<p>"Nooo, please no, you can't do this!!" Strand of Hair shouts in fright.</p>
<p>"Yess I can, and I will!"</p>
<p>"No please, we promise to never yell or push you around ever again." Toenail cries.</p>
<p>"It's too late for that, now where was I... Oh yes, Avada Mac N' Cheese!!!!!!!</p>
<p>"NOOOOOOOO" They both scream as they are forced to eat so many bowls of Mac N' Cheese.</p>
<p>"Finally," Broccoli and Cheese Soup cackles with glee, "They will become constipated!!!"</p>
