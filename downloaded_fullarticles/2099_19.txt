    <p>“<em> Professor?” He asked, bursting through, hitting his shoulder on the heavy wooden door. “Are you ready?” </em></p><p>“<em> Of course, of course, just a moment.” The Professor murmured, voice soft, body relaxed, dark hair falling over a slim shoulder. “Let me finish this letter.” </em></p><p>“<em> There’s no time, Professor. They’re through the gate.” </em></p><p>“<em> There is always time.” </em></p><p>
  <em> The hallways were strewn with bodies, the air was cold, and the Professor hurried along next to him at best, and stumbled at worst. It was all he could think of to support, to hold, and yet, it wasn’t enough, not when the green spells lit the air like bullets. When the tall man aimed, he aimed true, and then, the battle was lost. </em>
</p><p>Jiya awoke with a start; the vision had taken her by surprise. As she got up from the floor, clutching her bruised head, she breathed a full, deep breath, praying to Muggle gods that she didn’t believe in that she was wrong, that she’d only seen the potential outcomes, that it could change.</p><p>She went back, again, hours later – just as the doubts had started to fade, just as the headache had been healed – she went there. The same again, a little softer around the edges, a little bolder in the details, brighter in colour and sharper in pain. They weren’t usually that clear, not from someone else’s eyes, but she was certain.</p><p>Hogwarts was doomed.</p><p>---</p><p>Rufus really, really wanted a nap.</p><p>His day was going fine, he guessed – no new cases, a few old ones wrapped up, and he hadn’t been called to the meeting Karl, Emma, and Anthony had been stuck in for the last three hours. He’d avoided the latest Howler from his ex, and even his godforsaken cat hadn’t eaten today’s Daily Prophet yet. Opening letters was tedium, but necessary, and as bored as he was as he left for a lunch break, he returned in even worse condition. His ex had found his new address, and his ears hurt. Goddamn Howlers.</p><p>Time to move, he supposed. How in the name of Merlin’s boob job had she managed to find him again? Did she just have a beacon on him? Or he was bugged – <em> maybe the department toads are betraying me again </em>, he thought, giving them a filthy look as he walked back in. Odd train of thought aside, he was stopped mid-stride by a very odd sight – surely everyone else had seen the gorgeous snowy owl sat on his desk, right? The one currently taking a shit on the Daily Prophet he hadn’t yet read?</p><p>He approached, cautious and exasperated, but the owl just stuck out her leg and glared at him. He snorted, taking the parchment, and rootled around in his desk for a nut treat. (She decided to accept it with a gracious tilt of her head, and took off immediately. There’s no rest for the wicked.)</p><p>He took one look at the Hogwarts wax seal and frowned. What could they want from him, of all people? He took it out and started reading.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Mr Carlin, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> By appointment of Headmistress McGonagall, I am tasked with finding a suitable substitute teacher for our very own Mr Wesson, Professor of Muggle Studies. Due to his disappearance, amongst others, it falls to me to request your immediate Apparition to Hogwarts (via Hogsmeade, of course) upon receiving this letter. You will meet another of our new staff members - Mr Wyatt Logan, of the Auror’s Department at the Ministry of Magic. Your Head of Department at Mason Incorporated has been notified, and so have your family. A cursory interview will be conducted by Professors Flitwick and Wallace upon your arrival. Please bring your personal belongings with you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Yours, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Denise Christopher, Head of Gryffindor House and Professor of Transfiguration </em>
</p><p> </p><p>He sighed. Why now? Just when they were finally making a breakthrough on the Time-Turner project, just when they needed a new gyroscope fitting to the navigators? Of course, he couldn’t refuse Professor Christopher, but this was definitely odd. He looked down again – it was her usual looping script, her bizarre Gs, the hurried wax seal on the envelope – it was all correct, but why did he feel a sudden, looming sense of doom?</p><p>He sighed again, resigned to this definitely awful new path, and packed his things. Once that meeting’s ended-</p><p>“Hey, Rufus. Off somewhere?” Karl murmured, leaning against Rufus’ desk, attempting a genuine smile. If you asked him (and Nia, the new girl, had done), he thought Karl was definitely emotionally constipated, and probably a sociopath. Or perhaps both.</p><p>“Nowhere fun.” He waved the letter in Karl’s general direction, his head stuck in his desk. “That old Time-Turner, hang on… got it!”</p><p>“No-one wants that, dumbass.” Emma snorted, and then grinned, feral, as Karl pushed off from the desk and slapped the letter into Rufus’ case. She grabbed it, scanning the words quicker than he could get his head out of his desk, and placed it back into his trunk.</p><p>“Those poor kids, they don’t know what’s gonna hit them.” She teased, as Karl and Anthony helped Rufus round up his scattered belongings.</p><p>“Better me than you. You’d scare them to death.” Emma’s snort barely reached his ears, but it still made him grin, face buried in his desk. Irritating her was a vital part of his career, even if she was the best at Levitation Charms and could probably out-curse him. It’s all about the details, you know?</p><p>As he finally got finished, he stood and looked around. Most of his things were at home, sure, but his desk looked empty, and that was… bad. Bad memories. Very bad, not good memories. Karl seemed to pick this up, and grabbed a little picture from his top drawer.</p><p>“You can’t- Karl, no, I can’t- what?” He protested, trying to shove it back into Karl’s hands. “You love this, Karl, I can’t take it. No way, man.”</p><p>Karl just smiled, easy-going, and said nothing. He didn’t need to – to Rufus, it was a clear message.</p><p>“What the Hell does he need that for?” Emma groaned, throwing another letter straight in the bin. She looked like she was considering throwing it at them, but seemingly remembered that the last time she’d done that, Karl had Bat-Bogeyed her very thoroughly. It had been, in Rufus’ very professional opinion, incredible.</p><p>His smile wavered a little, though, when he looked back at the picture. He thanked Karl with a quick hug, waved at Anthony, and ignored Emma’s saccharine smile. He looked down at the picture as he left – a portrait of him, Jiya, and Karl in their second year. Youthful glow, Hufflepuff and Gryffindor, warm eyes, their arms around each other. It did make him smile, in a sad sort of way, but he really only saw what Karl meant by it.</p><p>
  <em> Don’t mess this one up. </em>
</p><p>---</p><p>“Mum? You home?” He called out, setting his trunk down by the front door.</p><p>“Kitchen!” She yelled back, and he grinned. He’d missed this.</p><p>Despite making it a habit to write every week, and visit at least once a month, he’d been slacking lately, and he could tell that she was worried. She’d never send him a Howler, she’d never complain like his brother did, but he could tell that she needed to see him before he left. He made his way past the living room, waved hello to the portrait of his grandfather (who just puffed his pipe and ignored him, as usual), and entered the dining room.</p><p>“Hi, mum.” They hugged, gentle but firm, and Rufus breathed in the scent of home. “You okay?”</p><p>“I’d be better if you wrote more, love, but I’m good. Are you? What’s this thing at Hogwarts?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I hope it’s short, we’ve been making some breakthroughs in the Time-Turner project.” He grinned. “I just came to see you before I left. Professor Christopher doesn’t like to be kept waiting.”</p><p>“Well, I’m sure she can wait a little longer. You look like you aren’t eating properly, Rufus, you know how I feel about that.” She steered him towards the table, grabbed a bowl of piping hot soup, and set it down in front of him. “Tell me all about it, honey.”</p><p>---</p><p>Okay, he only sort of wanted a nap, but the Apparition to Hogsmeade had been kind of shaky, and he was sure he’d Splinched off a few brain cells in the process. And even more worrying was the distinct lack of people around here. Add recent events? The Death-Eater rumours, the disappearances? He could understand how quiet it could be, especially without students running rampant around the place.</p><p>This, though – this was eerie. Like, ‘horror movie watched in pitch black while a demon destroys your life’ eerie.</p><p>He trudged his lonely way up to the castle gates, levitating his trunk and briefcase in front of him as he went (take that, Emma!), and waited. He felt, rather than heard, the other guy walk up, but it still took him by surprise – and he didn’t like what he saw.</p><p>Now, Rufus had always been raised to see past how someone looked, his mother had always taught him that, but this guy was a <em> trainwreck. </em></p><p>Hair flying everywhere, his trunk’s clasps straining against its contents, and his robes were tattered and muddy – it was an absolute disaster. But the pure relief on this guy’s face at seeing him was what made him pause (not that he would have cared normally, but this man was clearly distressed and in need of help. Like, professional help. From a therapist.)</p><p>“It’s, uh, Rufus, right?” He muttered as he hurried up, his words barely distinguishable beneath a strong Scottish accent and him slamming his wand messily into his robe pocket. He shoved his hand out towards Rufus, and attempted a grin that looked a little too manic. “I’m Wyatt Logan.”</p><p>“Uh, hi, yeah. Rufus Carlin.” Rufus shook his hand, somewhat reluctantly. It was rather muddy.</p><p>“Sorry about, uh.” Wyatt looked embarrassed.</p><p>“The …mud?”</p><p>“Yeah. That. I landed in the swamp.” He had the good grace to fish his wand out and clean up his robes, but didn’t offer Rufus anything. Not that Rufus was being petty, of course, but he was cold too, and he could see the steam rising on Wyatt’s freshly laundered clothes. But then the castle gates opened, and a cart pulled up – they looked at each other and Rufus shrugged, getting up into the surprisingly warm carriage. Wyatt staggered a little as he got in, as if the spell had taken something out of him, and Rufus frowned. Was he ill? </p><p>Wyatt noticed that he noticed, and after a few moments of moderately uncomfortable silence, huffed out a small laugh. “I didn’t know I was gonna be working tonight, so I’m a little...”</p><p>“Drunk. You’re drunk.” Rufus sighed. This day was just going absolutely great, and he wasn’t sure it could get worse, but he’d said it now. Sod’s law, and all that.</p><p>“Maybe. Just fulfilling the Glaswegian stereotype, of course, and as I said-” He paused, looking at him. Like really, really looking at him, his soft, low voice halted in its tracks. “Wait, you said you’re Rufus <em> Carlin </em>?”</p><p>“...Yeah?” This was weird.</p><p>“You’re Gryffindor, right?”</p><p>“What? Yeah...” Getting weirder.</p><p>“Aren’t you the one who punched that Slytherin guy… uh, Nick?” Wyatt pinched the bridge of his nose, racking his brains. “Nick Keynes, I think? In your third year?”</p><p>Rufus nodded, wary. If this idiot was going to start trouble, he wasn’t sure what would happen – they’re supposed to be future coworkers, right, but if this guy was a moron, Rufus wasn’t going to suffer fools. He opened his mouth ready to start ranting, but Wyatt’s eyes had suddenly lit up.</p><p>“Aw, man – I remember that, it was<em> badass </em>! Everybody in my common room was talking about it for weeks! He’d been a real arsehole to a load of us, you were like a hero.” He laughed a little, eyes bright and his smile wide, and Rufus couldn’t help but smile back. “Yeah, I was, uh, in my first or second year, I think.”</p><p>“You don’t remember?”</p><p>“Not really. Everything up to my O.W.Ls was a blur, to be honest.” His face dropped a little and he played with the hem of his sleeve. “Anyway. Enough of me – what about you?”</p><p>“What about me?” Rufus gave him an odd look and shrugged. “Uh, I was born and raised in Kent, and now I work at Mason Incorporated.”</p><p>“That must be cool,” Wyatt offered, a little grin growing on his face.</p><p>“Yeah, it is. But you’re an Auror, right? Do you know anything about what’s been happening?” Rufus frowned, leaning forward to look properly at Wyatt.</p><p>“No. The only reason I requested this assignment is because I want to know, too.”</p><p>“You… <em> requested </em>this assignment?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Wyatt swallowed, resting his head against the carriage walls. “Dave, he... Professor Baumgardner, sorry, he, we… we were friends. I just want to help them figure it out.”</p><p>---</p><p>They’d gotten up to the castle quite quickly, conversation flowing between them despite such a rocky start, reminiscing of the Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match in Rufus’ sixth year where two players had been hospitalised and one seeker had been in the Infirmary for a week, remembering when there had been a Mandrake accident in Wyatt’s third year, and they’d just started on the last Triwizard Tournament when they’d gotten up to the castle doors.</p><p>“Hi?” A bold, Welsh voice had said from behind them, just as they entered the courtyard.</p><p>Wyatt nearly shit himself.</p><p>Rufus almost didn’t snort, but he couldn’t quite help himself. Wyatt gave him what the Muggles would call ‘side eye’ and moved backwards, further towards the flight of stairs up to the main entrance. The woman – soft hazel eyes, pretty face, athletic body – moved with him, beckoning with a quick flick of her hair for Rufus to follow them, robes billowing.</p><p>“I’m Amy Wallace, and I’m one of the groundskeepers of Hogwarts. My sister, Lucy, the History teacher, will be conducting your induction. That’s later, though.” He followed the two of them up towards to castle, and gasped as he entered – even after the events of the Second Wizarding War, the castle had retained its splendour. The staircases above still moved just how he remembered them, the paintings were still just as lively (a few of them waved to Wyatt like old friends, which he supposed they must have been) and even the random cats and toads roaming the corridors were almost endearing. They started working their way upwards.</p><p>“So, Miss Wallace, you’re the groundskeeper? Do you know anything about these disappearances?” Wyatt started, and Rufus found himself squinting at the charming smirk on his face, the lilt in his voice. Was he… flirting? For information?</p><p>“I have a wife.” She growled, stopping stock still in the middle of the hallway, just where Rufus could almost trip over her. She glared at him, five foot six of pure righteous indignation, and Rufus almost grinned. “Jessica, my wife, she was the last groundskeeper. She went missing a few weeks ago. Went into the Forbidden Forest and never came out again, so the job’s fallen to me.”</p><p>(If he wasn’t suddenly and immeasurably afraid of her, and if she wasn’t talking about her missing wife, Rufus would be laughing. As it is, he had a little more tact than Wyatt did.)</p><p>“No, I wasn’t, that wasn’t-,” Wyatt stuttered, then took a deep breath. “I’m… sorry?”</p><p>Amy acquiesced, nodding at him before starting up a long staircase. She patted Wyatt’s shoulder as she passed him, ignoring all the gawking paintings and going further up, onto the first floor. Wyatt fell into stride beside Rufus as he spoke, smiling awkwardly. Rufus smiled back, lips pressed together, a habit, but his mind was still turning. This guy was really, really weird. Even for a Scot.</p><p>“Oh, and if you’re going to be asking questions? ” Amy stopped suddenly outside a classroom at the end of the winding corridor. “Don’t flirt your way to answers. Here you go. The History of Magic classroom.”</p><p>Wyatt and Rufus made eye contact, apprehensive, as Amy knocked on the heavy wooden door. A smooth Welsh voice - softer and far more neutral than Amy’s - invited them in, and they both gasped softly at the view.</p><p>When Rufus had been at Hogwarts, Professor Binns’ classes had been nicknamed “naptime” - a period just to watch him phase through the blackboard, make a few notes, try your best, and then sigh in mock despair when you failed the class every year. But this room, oh my <em> god </em> this room, was so drastically different it physically shocked him. Where before it had been cramped and dark, it was now so light and airy it practically blinded him. The desks had been pushed into the middle, a massive arc facing a small chalkboard and the teacher’s desk; the literal cobwebs had been replaced with the hand-drawn maps and different Muggle posters filling the walls; and the petite brunette stood on a chair reaching for the chandelier was definitely <em> not </em> the ghostly Professor Binns.</p><p>Wyatt was having the same train of thought, if his shell-shocked look was to be judged. She was quite beautiful, in a small, elvish sort of way, and he could see why Wyatt was struggling for words. She greeted them cheerfully, looking down at them before almost slipping off the stool. Wyatt rushed forwards to catch her, but she ended up righting herself almost immediately, and they stood there in abashed silence for a moment, a tableau of awkward.</p><p>“Sorry, oh, hang on...” She muttered, snapping out of it and burying her face in the chandelier again, wedging out a small screwdriver from the metal and then hopping back down from her perch. “You must be Wyatt Logan, right? And Rufus Carlin?”</p><p>“That’s us,” Rufus shook her hand gently – she was <em> miniscule </em> – and took another look around the room.</p><p>“I like what you’ve done with the place.” Wyatt got to it before he could, and then proceeded to blush like a fire hydrant. She was looking at him like she wanted to both smack and kiss him at the same time, and Rufus didn’t know what to do with that, so he decided to walk away and leave them to it, strolling across the room to look at a printed timeline of ‘British and American Wizarding History’. All the while he could hear Lucy asking questions, Wyatt stuttering barely intelligible answers, and Amy was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>It was entirely hilarious.</p><p>When they finally got around to talking about the school, Rufus found he was increasingly apprehensive of their schedules. Taking joint-house classes had seemed fun when you were an innocent student and were just looking for an Exceeds Expectations on your O.W.L.; when you’re teaching twenty students who were a mix of Slytherin and Gryffindor and most of them don’t know the difference between TV and movies, it’s a whole different goose. And boy did Rufus hate geese.</p><p>Professor Wallace remembered them in a vague sort of way, apparently; she was just a year older than Rufus, and three older than Wyatt. Somehow Rufus hadn’t expected someone so young, but she walked with this air of authority which, once you considered that she was a Ravenclaw and had probably gotten an Outstanding in every qualification she’d ever taken, was understandable. They started making their ways along the corridors while she spoke, giving them little bits of advice like “don’t let the kids eat in class,” and “many of them will hate you anyway, so just do your best and you’ll be fine.”</p><p>Rufus knew she was messing with them, but he couldn’t help the growing apprehension in his gut. He was also very hungry, which didn’t help. They’d managed to make their way up two floors to Wyatt’s classroom.</p><p>“Unfortunately, our offices aren’t anywhere near our classrooms, but we make do. We passed your office, Wyatt, one floor down, and Rufus, yours is right next to the Muggle Studies showroom on the fifth floor. Lots of stairs, I’m afraid.” Lucy grinned at them. “And Wyatt, this is your classroom here. It’s a little messy, due to the speed at which Professor Baumgardner….left.  But, I’m sure you can get it ready before term starts?”</p><p>Wyatt nodded, and took his cue to open the door - it was a mess. Broken glass, cobwebs, books strewn across the floor. If Rufus was shocked, he couldn’t imagine how Wyatt must be feeling. “What happened here? Do you know?”</p><p>“I’m afraid not, Wyatt. You’ll have to ask Professor Flynn, our resident potions master - they were quite close. He’s usually in the dungeons.”</p><p>Wyatt let out a dejected little sigh, and grabbed his trunk from the floor, apprehension visible on his face.</p><p>Rufus gave Wyatt a jaunty little wave as they left him to it.</p><p>---</p><p>Dinner was much appreciated.</p><p>It was a small do, just the staff that were there and their pets - Rufus wished he’d brought his little toad, but his brother said he’d look after her until Rufus could come and get her.</p><p>(Toads don’t do well with Apparition.)</p><p>He entered the Great Hall, marveling again at the ceiling. He remembered overhearing something someone had said when they were kids, something about how it’s enchanted to look like the sky at that moment, but Rufus just thought it was gorgeous. He tried not to trip over the ginger tomcat winding its way around his feet, and shoved himself down next to Wyatt, who looked a little worse for wear. While the carriage ride had sobered him a little, he still wasn’t completely there yet, and Rufus could tell. He was doing a good job of pretending, though.</p><p>Rufus ladled his plate full of stew and a healthy dollop of mashed potatoes. He felt obliged to take a few of the roasted vegetables, too, but Wyatt glared at them like they’d killed his family.</p><p>“Not a stew kind of guy?” Rufus grinned. It was delicious, warm and hearty, and perfect for the permanent drizzle that had seemed to rest around the castle since they got there. “It’s great, you know.”</p><p>“Just not hungry. Might drop by the kitchens later, though.” Wyatt did seem kind of green, now that Rufus looked closer.</p><p>“Careful.” Rufus warned, waving his fork in Wyatt’s general direction. “You do that too much, you might get in trouble.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.” Rufus was waved off as Wyatt poured himself another cup of pumpkin juice, and drank it slowly. “I don’t feel so good, so I’m going to go sleep. I’ll see you at breakfast, pal.”</p><p>It wasn’t quite concern that took over Rufus’ brain as Wyatt left, but it was something close. He just needed to watch out for him. Like a moronic puppy.</p><p>“You alright, mate?” A broad Yorkshire accent filtered through his thoughts, and he realised he’d been staring at the candles for about five minutes. “Oi, you okay?”</p><p>“Huh?” <em> Eloquent, Rufus, great job. </em>“Oh, yeah, uh, sorry. Zoned out a minute.”</p><p>“Eh, don’t worry. Happens to me, too.” She extended a surprisingly large hand over the table to him. “Um. I’m Natasha. Hufflepuff. I teach languages.”</p><p>“I’m Rufus, Muggle Studies.” Rufus met her slightly crooked grin with one of his own, and took a drink. “Languages, huh? Like, Muggle ones?”</p><p>“Yeah. I do some old timey wizarding dialects too, at N.E.W.T. level, but it’s mostly just for those who want to do it.” She ate for a moment, tucked her long auburn hair behind her ear, and then frowned. “Rufus… the, uh, the Gryffindor Rufus?”</p><p>“Yeah. Are you gonna ask me about the time I punched Nick Keynes?”</p><p>“...Maybe.”</p><p>Rufus stifled a laugh, letting out a highly amused huffing noise. He was sure he was gonna like working here.</p><p>Famous last words.</p><p> </p>
