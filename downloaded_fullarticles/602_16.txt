    <p>“You’re a proud man, Remus.”</p><p>The words did not sound like a compliment, coming from Kingsley the way they were; not when the two men were sitting in Kinglsey’s well-adorned office at the Ministry, with old paintings of former leaders staring at them curiously.</p><p>This felt nothing like talking to Shacklebolt in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place had during Order meetings, when Remus’ ears could not help but stray to listen for Sirius’ displeased grunts across the room, Kingsley’s voice tuned out.</p><p>And it also didn’t feel like how shouting words of warning had, just four months ago at the battle of Hogwarts. There were no explosions and no flying hexes; no smoke rising from burning tapestries and no loved ones collapsing around them. The artificial-feeling, Privacy Charm-induced silence of the Minister’s office was supposed to feel safer but, still, Remus felt like he was there to fight for something. <em> Justice</em>, one might put it.</p><p>Except the man in charge wasn’t buying into his argument at all.</p><p>“But she was your wife,” Kingsley continued. “You were legally wed and she was a Ministry employee.”</p><p>Remus could see the look on Tonks’ from face when she’d told him they should get married in ridiculous detail. The way her sweet, hazel eyes were fogged up with liquor, her vibrant-coloured hair dirty with sweat from their running, Remus pictured, earning himself a sharp tug to the heart. They’d both been drunk out of their minds after a particularly bad raid, and her jeans still had someone’s blood on them. He had laughed, though. He had laughed at the idea of signing their names on a paper and of having people call her Mrs. Remus Lupin simply because that wasn't who she was. That wasn’t who <em> they </em>were.</p><p><em> This is for you, Remus</em>, she had told him, her gaze turning dark.</p><p><em> I won’t have you be my widow, </em> he had retorted.</p><p><em> The bloody irony</em>, he thought, back at the Ministry, eyes back on the man before him.</p><p>At thirty-eight, Remus felt like he’d been widowed twice.</p><p>“This is simple procedure, Remus,” Kingsley amended.</p><p>The urge to complain about <em> procedure </em> and how unfair it could be died in Remus’ throat. He wasn’t about to bring up what the Ministry had been calling <em> procedure </em> for the last year or so; that would be unfair. Kingsley had not been in charge back then; the Death Eaters had. And Remus had not come by today to insult his friend’s leadership, or anything of the sort. All he wanted was peace.</p><p>“She wasn’t killed on duty as a Ministry employee, Kingsley. We both know that. When I got that letter from the Aurors office, I…”</p><p>Choking on his words was also not something Remus had been planning on. He had thought this would be easier – he would come by and politely return the gold he’d been given as Tonks’ life insurance beneficiary, as well as decline the pension the Ministry had begun depositing into his Gringott’s vault. It had seemed simple and logical in his head – besides, why wouldn’t they be thrilled to have to spend less money in a time of crisis? This could be going to someone who needed it more, Remus had argued in his own head during a recent sleepless night. But again, Kingsley was not having it. He did seem <em> touched </em>by Remus’ words, but not in the way Remus had wanted him to be.</p><p>“She was on maternity leave,” Remus said, simply, clearing his throat and cursing himself for the pitiful look that bloomed over the Minister’s face.</p><p>“Yes, Remus, but as I told you, all Ministry employees get insurance policies, even the ones who are not Aurors. And pensions, too. That’s just the way it is. No special treatment here.”</p><p>Remus floundered for a moment, at a loss for what to say.</p><p>“Just take it for Teddy, Remus.”</p><p>Remus’ eyes narrowed for a second, but there was nothing he could say to refute <em> that</em>. Babies needed things. Nappies, bottles, Infant Nourishing Potions. Even muggle baby formula was too expensive, as Remus had soon found out. Besides, having Andromeda support Teddy financially while still grieving both her husband and daughter didn’t feel right in the slightest; she didn't make any effort to hide how displeased she'd been to see Remus out and about while she'd still been in mourning, after all.</p><p><em> For Teddy, then</em>, he thought, his expression sour. Perhaps Remus <em> was </em>a proud man, indeed.</p><p>Luckily enough, though, a knock on the door interrupted them.</p><p>“Sir? Harry Potter is here.” The voice of the Ministry’s secretary was squeaky and full of awe as she announced Harry’s presence. Remus was pretty sure she wouldn’t have come knocking on Kingsley’s door personally if Harry hadn’t been the one out there.</p><p>“Come on in, son.”</p><p>Harry entered the room, looking shy. He had Teddy strapped to him, in a muggle baby carrier Remus had begun wearing when the two of them were out and he needed his hands free.</p><p>Remus smiled at the two of them and Harry seemed to relax.</p><p>“It’s good to see you here. Remus and I were just having a chat, but we’re done now,” Kingsley told Harry, closing the previous topic.</p><p>“Teds got a bit restless for a mo there, but everyone was happy to see him at the Aurors Department.”</p><p>Recognising the sound of his name, Teddy squealed happily in Harry’s arms, grabbing onto his jacket lapels and pulling on them.</p><p>“I bet they miss you, too,” Kingsley told a distracted Harry with a benign smile. Remus could see the exact moment when the words sunk in, though; a shadow crossing Harry’s eyes behind the round frames he wore.</p><p>“Uhm, yeah. Robards kept making jokes about me running off to be a babysitter instead of an Auror.”</p><p>“Dora used to say he was kind of a sexist prick, yeah.”</p><p>Both men turned to Remus at that. He could feel his ears flush hot, having blurted it out without thinking. He scratched at his beard, then; a fidgety habit Remus had picked up once his facial hair had grown out enough to sink the tips of his fingers into. Shaving had just not been a priority, lately.</p><p>“He’s a very competent Head Auror, but I’ll make sure to investigate,” Kingsley replied in what sounded like a conciliatory but final tone.</p><p>Taking the cue, Remus rose from his chair and offered the Minister his hand.</p><p>“We also have Mind Healers available to family members of deceased Ministry employees, but I won’t offer <em> that </em>to you,” Kingsley shook his hand. Remus didn’t know what to say, so he busied himself with relieving Harry of Teddy’s nappy bag. “I know, I know,” Kingsley continued. “Just remember you have people on your side, Remus. The war is over. We all want to see our own do well.”</p><p>Still quiet, Remus nodded and stepped back so Harry could shake Kingsley’s hand as well.</p><p>Once they were out in the corridor, Harry handed Teddy over and helped Remus strap the carrier around himself. With a kiss to a giggly Teddy’s fine and now black hair – <em> to match Harry’s </em>? he wondered as a rush of affection for both of them coursed through him – they began to make their way out of the building.</p><p>“Would you mind if we stopped by Mysteries? I told ‘Mione I’d say hi,” Harry asked, waving a stuffed dragon at Teddy as they walked. The baby giggled.</p><p>“Sure, no problem. I think this lad still has a good half an hour on him.”</p><p>They walked towards the lifts in silence, but it was comfortable. Remus and Teddy had spent some time at Grimmauld with Harry a couple of months ago, and the boy was a constant presence in the Lupins’ spare bedroom once Remus had managed to go back to living at his flat without Tonks. They were all used to quiet nights, interrupted only by the baby’s cries.</p><p>Harry didn’t seem to be able to sleep well since the war – he’d once confessed he couldn’t remember a time when he’d slept more than four hours at once – and Remus felt guilty for letting him get woken by Teddy’s night fits, but Harry didn’t seem bothered. He would spend time in Teddy’s room even when Remus didn’t ask him to and, having been unable to pay for a nanny without the pension he had so far refused to receive, Remus knew the help was priceless.</p><p>With time, Harry had begun opening up, too. He’d told Remus about his time at the Forest of Dean and the hunt for Horcruxes.  They’d discussed Remus’ <em> unfortunate </em>behaviour on the night he’d talked to him, Ron and Hermione, the year before. The guilt he’d felt about that time was still there – Remus felt like a coward for having even considered walking away from his son, despite having been forgiven by Harry, at least.</p><p>“So, I was thinking of cleaning up Grimmauld for real, you know? Kreacher likes me now and… I think I could make something out of the place.”</p><p>Remus nodded.</p><p>“I think Sirius would’ve liked it,” Harry continued.</p><p>“Level Nine, Department of Mysteries,” the voice in the lift announced before Remus could say anything. He didn’t really think Sirius would want anything to do with his old family house, but yet he had left it to Harry to do as he pleased with it.</p><p>Still, hearing Sirius’ name as they stepped closer and closer to the place where he’d died left a bitter taste in Remus’ mouth. Harry seemed to notice he’d said something wrong, and turned his attention to Teddy instead.</p><p>“Harry! Professor Lupin!”</p><p>Hermione’s excited tone saved them from the uncomfortable moment. She looked well in her Unspeakable robes, like she belonged in them. She was clutching multiple rolls of parchment and looked tired, but happy.</p><p>“Haven’t been a professor in a while, Hermione. Call me Remus,” he smiled. She put down the parchment rolls and waved her wand at them, making them fly off in different directions, in neatly stacked piles. Remus was impressed.</p><p>“D’you remember Marina Santos? She graduated when we were in third year? We’re… we found something… let me go fetch her!” The girl said, pushing a strand of thick curly hair off her forehead before leaning in to give Harry a quick half-hug and running off.</p><p>“She told me they’ve been working on something you might be interested in, but she wouldn’t get into detail,” Harry told Remus with something of a shrug as they both watched Hermione walk into a closed office, shutting the door behind her. “She’s really into the whole research thing… I thought she’d go back to school, but she flat-out refused it when Mrs. Weasley asked if she wanted her to get her books back in August when the lists came…”</p><p>Harry clearly hadn’t wanted to go back to school, either, and Remus sympathised. He hadn’t been thrilled at the perspective of getting back to Hogwarts himself when Minerva asked him to assume the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher; not when the images of the Battle were still so vivid in his dreams.</p><p>“Professor Lupin, hello!”</p><p>A bright voice brought Remus back to Earth.</p><p>“And Harry, I don’t think we’ve met before. I’m Marina; I graduated with your girlfriend’s brother, Percy!”</p><p>The young woman offered Harry her hand in greeting, which he took, despite seeming a tad uncomfortable.</p><p>“I just came back from Argentina. I was very lucky to get to study under Cardozo. I don’t think I’ve ever had the chance to thank you properly for the recommendation, professor!” She turned to Remus, still beaming. He did not remember having given her a recommendation letter, but he was sure he’d taught her at Hogwarts. It felt good to see one of his students succeed.</p><p>“It’s almost embarrassing, how little the British Unspeakables knew about what the wizarding historians and anthropologists in South America have been working on for <em> years </em> now!”</p><p>Santos chatted away about her apprenticeship in curse-breaking, and they all followed her back into the office her and Hermione had come from. Teddy made a sleepy sound around the large button of Remus’ blazer he’d been gnawing on, which Remus took as a warning. Teddy was either about to fall asleep or cry until he was taken home, and those were two extremes that were hard to predict.</p><p>“Have you told prof– Remus about it yet?” Hermione asked excitedly, having popped out from behind Santos with a new pile of parchment in hand. Remus frowned at their enthusiasm.</p><p>“I’m– she hasn’t, no. I’m afraid I’m gonna have to take Teddy home soon, though. I’m sorry, Hermione, Marina, but you sound busy…”</p><p>“But– !”</p><p><br/>“We may have found a cure, professor!”</p><p>Remus’ frown grew deeper. He’d had his eyes down on Teddy’s chubby hand that was now trying to rip the button off his jacket. It was hard to imagine why would they be trying to find a cure for his morphing magic, he thought. That was not supposed to be any trouble at all. Teddy <em> did </em>have a penchant for screaming, and the healers at Saint Mungo’s had a hard time coming up with explanations for his seemingly unprompted fits, but Remus would never… he’d never change his boy.</p><p>“For lycanthropy, sir! We found a cure!”</p><p>Remus’ heart hiccoughed. A shiver ran down his body, and it was hard to tell if the sensation was pleasant or not. Harry’s hand on his shoulder grounded him.</p><p>“H-harry, could you take Teddy home?”</p><p>The baby had just started fussing in his arms, but Remus needed to stay. <em> A cure</em>, he repeated in his head. Hermione was still smiling wide.</p><p>“I, uh. Of course.” Harry agreed, “Send me a Patronus if you need anything, yeah?”</p><p>Remus handed Teddy over to Harry and stepped inside Santos’ office with Hermione in tow.</p>
