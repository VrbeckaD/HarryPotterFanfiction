  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“You must help him, Severus.”</p><p>He sat motionless on the armchair, his dark eyes fixed on hers.  The glass of Firewhiskey stayed clutched in his hand, reflecting the light from the hearth that lit the cozy study.</p><p>“He’s just a boy,” she said.  “If I had the choice to leave this place and run away with him, I would take it.  But, I cannot leave Lucius, and Lucius will not leave the Dark Lord.  Still, I need to make sure Draco is safe.”</p><p>Severus continued to eye here, unblinking.  She could not read any stray emotion on his face; then again, she had long suspected that Severus only exhibited what he wanted the world to see and nothing more.</p><p>“I don’t know what you would have me do, Narcissa,” he said.  “I am unclear as to what you are requesting.”</p><p>She pushed away from the shadows among the bookshelves and stepped further into the light.  She gazed down on the only other occupant in the room.</p><p>“I need your help to keep Draco from being initiated into the Death Eaters,” she said.  “Bellatrix has told me the Dark Lord wants him to take the Mark in a fortnight.  You must help me make sure that doesn’t happen.”</p><p>He remained unmoving, aside from the angling of an eyebrow, in soundless challenge.  “You want me to keep a promising, young pledge from taking up our master’s cause?”</p><p>“You know, better than most, how dangerous it is to be a Death Eater,” she said.  “You must keep him from joining your ranks.  Help me protect him.  Do your duty as his godfather.”</p><p>“I am, first and foremost,” he said, in a tone that made the muscles of her shoulders tense in fear, “a loyal follower of our Dark Lord.”</p><p>Only a lifetime of high society breeding kept Narcissa from falling to her knees in supplication.  Instead, she bowed her head and brought her gaze down to the patch of worn carpet under his feet.</p><p>“Please, Severus,” she whispered.  “Bellatrix tells me the Dark Lord plans to use Draco as a tool to get to Dumbledore.  That he will be assigned to assassinate the Headmaster.”</p><p>She didn’t hear any response or reaction, so she continued.  “You know what’s likely to happen.  Dumbledore is a powerful wizard, and Draco has little hope to accomplish this task.  Either he will be sent to Azkaban for attempted murder – or the Dark Lord will kill him for his failure.”</p><p>Narcissa slowly raised her eyes to meet his cold gaze.</p><p>“Help him,” she pleaded.  “Help my son.  Your godson.  Keep him from falling into the Dark Lord’s grasp, or within a year, he’s guaranteed to be Kissed or killed.”</p><p>She felt hot tears slide down her cheeks, but her view of his calculating scrutiny remained clear.  The fingers that gripped the tumbler became stark white, noticeable even in the soft glow of the fire. </p><p>“The only way that you can hope to keep Draco from being initiated as a Death Eater,” he said, after a long pause, “is to hide him from the Dark Lord.  He will be safe once he is at Hogwarts.  In the meantime, he will need to be brought to a secure location, away from the Dark Lord’s influence.  Are you willing to part with your son, Narcissa?  No matter where he may be placed for his protection?  No matter how long it may be?”</p><p>She let hope surface on her expression.</p><p>“Yes,” she said.</p><p>“And how will you explain Draco’s disappearance to the Dark Lord?”</p><p>“Let me handle what to say to him,” she said, nudging her chin higher.  She will not let Severus try to talk them both off this path.</p><p>The corners of Severus’ mouth sloped lower.  “And if he takes his anger out on you, Narcissa?  Are you willing to risk his wrath?”</p><p>She said, “As long as my son is safe, I can handle whatever the Dark Lord does to me.”</p><p>A single, sharp nod was his only reply, as he brought the glass to his lips and drained the amber liquid in a single gulp.</p><p align="center">ooOOoo</p><p>She found Lord Voldemort standing with his back to the room, gazing out of the crystal pane that overlooked her rose garden.  Her footsteps were loud against the marble, and they echoed in the otherwise-empty ballroom, where the Dark Lord had taken to holding court.</p><p>Narcissa stopped at a respectful distance and remained silent, waiting to be acknowledged.  After a few frantic beats of her heart, her master addressed her with the customary chill in his voice.</p><p>“Is it done?” he asked, without turning around.</p><p>“Yes, my lord,” she said.</p><p>“And, has he agreed to help your son?”</p><p>“Yes, my lord,” she repeated.  “He has contacted Dumbledore, and I am to bring Draco to Spinner’s End by morning.  From there, they will take him to a safeguarded location.”</p><p>“He suspects nothing?”</p><p>“No, my lord,” she said.</p><p>A few more moments of silence were followed by Lord Voldemort’s dismissive flick of a wrist.  Narcissa backed away quickly, not turning until she reached the cold metal of the side door’s handle. </p><p>She yanked the door open and made a quick exit to the hall.</p><p>Scampering up the grand staircase, she made her way to the suite of rooms her son occupied.  She needed to get him ready.  </p><p>He was due at the Burrow at first light.</p>
