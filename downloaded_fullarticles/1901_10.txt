          <div class="userstuff"><p>Dobby arrived shaking at 12, Grimmauld Place. He still wasn’t able to get used to the adrenaline<br/>coursing throughout his body in spite of the fact that he has experienced every single time he fulfilled any<br/>mission for the movement he started. (At least, now I am able to overcome fear easier), he thought,<br/>although that thought didn’t calm him down.<br/>Many years had passed since the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix was inhabited, but the very<br/>few elves who joined the S.P.E.W. (Society for the Prevail upon the Elfish Warfare) made a flawless work<br/>cleaning the house, as any would expect from an house-elf. That annoyed Dobby even more than he<br/>was, he perfectly knew than a few months of freedom cannot get over generations of slavery and<br/>servitude. Al least for now.<br/>Nose, the elves who had joined him overwhelmed him whit their questions. Dobby, tired, settled the<br/>discussion saying that he had got the funding and the equipment they need for the next job. (Who<br/>cares about the guy I had to rob, the mission was a complete success, that was the only thing that<br/>matters) he thought while he was leading to the kitchen. He wasn’t surprised when he saw Winky in<br/>there, with a butterbeer. He went to bed without even saying anything to her, (She is too drunk to even<br/>realice I was here), he thought.<br/>The attempt on the life of the Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt changed the magical community.<br/>House-elves were unjustly accused and some of them were executed without trial. A few weeks later, Mr.<br/>Selwyn was designated Minister for Magic. Since then, the magical creatures lost many of their rights.<br/>The punishment which suffered the “inferior creatures” became more and more frequent. House-Elves<br/>weren’t allowed even to walk freely to do run an errand without the risk of being captured and tortured by<br/>the Magical Order Police, a new división created by Mr. Selwyn to persecute the “inferior magical<br/>creatures” and the wizards who were brave enough to defend then in public. (But this is going to<br/>change very soon), Dobby thought while he kept going over and over his plan.<br/>Next morning, the elves completed the preparation of the explosive mixture while Dobby get dressed,<br/>today was going to be an important day, so, he wore the shock that freed him. “A teleport, set the mixture<br/>and come back, simple” Dobby said to the group, or maybe to himself.<br/>He teleported to the sewage system, near the Ministry of Magic. It was around 11 am, he had plenty of<br/>time to place the explosives before the Minister of Magic arrives. (That moron doesn’t like to get up<br/>early), he though while he placed the explosives.<br/>The mission was a success, the body of that bastard reached the third floor before falling to the<br/>pavement, there was no way he could survive, but, even so, Dobby waited a few seconds to be sure. But<br/>the vision he had didn’t leave no room for doubt. The Minister for Magic was dead.<br/>Dobby conjured a mark which has not been seen since a few years ago. The mark of a man who had<br/>died a few years ago but still no-one dared to say his name. (This will be enough to mislead the<br/>authorities) he thought. Dobby threw the stolen wand into the sewage system and he left, walking<br/>through the crowd. People were too shocked to even notice his insignificant presence.<br/>While he was walking along the streets, Dobby experienced a feeling of happiness for the first time in<br/>many years. The plan was a complete success. (Nobody could blame me, everyone thinks I am dead.<br/>And no-one will believe that an elf could have conjured the Dark Mark. This time they won’t be able to<br/>blame any elf.)<br/>What Dobby didn’t know was that elfish magic leaves tracks.</p></div>
