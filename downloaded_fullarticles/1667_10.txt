    <p>Lucius sat on the back patio of Malfoy manor and watched his son playing in the pool. It was the summer after his final year at Hogwarts and the war was over. Malfoy thanked Merlin every day that neither he nor his son had ended up in Azkaban. But they hadn’t deserved it. Lucius knew he was a coward, he always had been. And if he was completely honest he didn’t have much of a conscience or a moral compass either. But he wasn’t evil. He didn’t go out of his way to hurt people, he just followed the strongest leader. He had an odd ability to spot the strongest leader and his eyes tracked the one swimming in his pool with his son.</p>
<p>Lucius sat on the back patio of Malfoy manor and watched his son playing in the pool. It was the summer after his final year at Hogwarts and the war was over. Malfoy thanked Merlin every day that neither he, nor his son had ended up in Azkaban. But they hadn’t deserved it. Lucius knew he was a coward; he always had been. And if he was completely honest, he didn’t have much of a conscience or a moral compass either. But he wasn’t evil. He didn’t go out of his way to hurt people; he just followed the strongest leader. He had an odd ability to spot the strongest leader and his eyes tracked the one swimming in the pool with his son.</p>
<p>He hadn’t believed he would ever see his son and Harry Potter being friends, the concept would have been laughable a few years ago. But here they were, Harry and Draco swimming away happily in the large pool in the sun. It was amazing how quickly they had settled their differences after the war. Harry could almost look Lucius in the face without disgust. That thought made his eyes sway over the hard, dark lines of Potter’s skin. Firm muscles and a gracious tan made Potter’s body into something particularly exquisite. He stood to get out of the pool, and it was like someone had slowed time.</p>
<p>He saw Potter reach to grab a towel and the bunching and flexing of the muscles in his arms and chest had a truly amazing impact on Lucius. Harry wiped his face off and then dried his hair, every little detail seemed slowed and intense, the flecks of water when Harry shook his head, to the way his eyes met Lucius’ when he looked up. Harry smiled and Lucius felt himself grow hard. He hated his reaction. He loved his wife, but their marriage had grown stale. He supposed it was just pent up hormones, but the way Harry looked at him... Lucius could almost convince himself the boy wanted him back.</p>
<p>Harry had a bad habit of licking his lips too much, as he did now, walking towards Lucius. Lucius kept his eyes at face level, fighting with all his being not to track those eyes down to Harry’s waist...and lower. Harry picked up a fruity drink from the table and sipped it. The cup emptied surprisingly fast, as had the other five he had consumed. Harry met his eyes and grinned.</p>
<p>“Having a good afternoon, Mr. Malfoy? I love your house. And these drinks...” Harry sipped at it again making an annoying sucking sound that oddly made Lucius harden.</p>
<p>“Lovely, Harry, call me Lucius, I suppose, since you’ve finally become friends with my son, I might as well extend the same regard. I’m not too old to be your friend, am I, Harry?” He said these words without thinking, biting his lip and realizing he sounded like an old pervert. But Harry was an adult now, he was perfectly legal. And the same age as my son, Lucius thought to himself. Which makes him approximately half my age. And completely off limits.</p>
<p>“Of course not, Lucius.” Harry said his name with a delightful twist of his lips and Lucius felt his cock expand some more, his eyes glued to those lips. Harry seemed to notice.</p>
<p>“Are you okay, Lucius? You look a bit...flushed.” Harry licked his lips at the last words delighting in the bob of the older man's Adam's apple. He had never really considered many men attractive but given the large quantity of alcohol in his system, and the hungry way Lucius was eyeing him, Harry had the strangest urge to go and sit on his lap. A House Elf brought him yet another drink and he found himself doing just that.</p>
<p>Harry had changed a lot in the past few months. Though he was still sad sometimes it was like an amazing weight had been lifted from his chest. He could finally be just Harry. And now that Draco had apologized to him for all the things he had done over the years, and thanked Harry for saving his life, they had become friends. It wasn’t a deep friendship, they were still vastly different people, but they got along alright. Right now, it wasn’t the younger Malfoy he was interested in. His eyes watched Lucius’ mouth as he stood, those lips going dry as Harry took a few steps closer to him. He watched Lucius as he stepped closer. Harry eyed the pale skin of the older man’s chest. It was hairless and perfectly smooth, well-muscled and made him want to run his hands over it. He had a feeling he would get a chance as he sat himself firmly on Lucius’ lap. He wiggled himself into a comfortable position, pretending to ignore the hard cock pressed against his arse, or the particular way Lucius groaned when he wiggled.</p>
<p>Dear lord this boy intends to kill me. Lucius thought as he felt Harry’s firm thighs and tight arse wiggle teasingly as he sat down on his lap. He had a drink in his hand and his legs draped over the side of the chaise, his back resting against Lucius’ shoulder. It was then that Lucius lost all hope for keeping himself sane.</p>
<p>“Harry, I highly doubt you are completely unaware of why you shouldn’t be sitting on my lap. But seeing as you are, should I explain exactly how hard you are making it for me?” He emphasized hard with a slight thrust of his hips, grinding his painfully hard prick against Harry’s arse and thighs. Harry turned around and grinned at him.</p>
<p>“Is it just me, or are you also wondering what Draco is thinking right about now?” Lucius sat up in a flash, knocking Harry to the ground without an apology and hurrying quickly into the house. Harry lay on the ground laughing and looked towards Draco who was looking over at him with an expression of complete confusion.</p>
<p>“Harry...correct me if I am wrong...I most definitely could be, but did I or did I not just see you sitting on my father’s lap?” Harry couldn’t stop his laughter at the complete bewilderment in that tone. He nodded as he lay on the ground laughing. He stayed on the ground for several reasons. The first was he was drunk, and it seemed like a great place to be laying. And the second was that he was laughing too hard to move. But the third reason, the most pressing one was the fact that he doubted Draco would appreciate the hard on tenting his swim trunks.</p>
<p>Lucius didn’t come down for dinner that night, preferring not to come face to face with his son, or Harry for that matter. Harry slept over that night and Lucius found himself lying on his bed as his wife dozed next to him. He found himself stroking his cock, dreaming of Harry’s mouth, his hands, his arse. He knew it was wrong, but he was so hard as he thought about it. He stroked himself along, picturing Harry’s eyes, those sparkling bottle green eyes that bored into him, and the sly look on his face as he licked his lips. He came with a cry causing Narcissa to shift in her sleep, he ignored her and rolled over to try to sleep.</p>
<p>Harry was having similar problems. He was deep asleep and the things going on in his head were not appropriate for all ages. He felt Lucius strain against him, felt that glorious cock against his arse. He felt those long thin fingers on his cock and those lips on his. He came with a cry waking himself up. Draco rolled over and stared off the edge of the bed at him. He ignored him and rolled over. Harry had never really fantasized about men; he found some attractive...but not in the same way he was attracted to women. He had fallen asleep convincing himself he had just been drunk and horny, that he wasn’t actually attracted to Lucius’ slick, smoke and honey voice, or his white blond hair...and then he had that dream.</p>
<p>He could still feel the way that smirk gave way under his lips. It was much too detailed for a dream and it kept him awake, feeling ashamed for the wet sticky spot in his pants. He finally gave up on sleeping and chose to wander the halls. He found himself in the library, attracted to the sound of crackling flames. He walked in, keeping an eye out for whoever had lit the fire and found himself sitting in a chair in front of the flames. He had lost himself momentarily in the flicker of those flames before he felt the figure standing behind his chair.</p>
<p>He didn’t even have to turn around before he knew who it was. Lucius had finally let himself get out of bed and pace the house, finding comfort in the library, he had gone to shut out a light in another room before he settled down and came back to find Harry dazed in his chair. Harry looked exhausted and a part of his mind wanted to know what he would look like spent. He wanted to see this gorgeous boy on his knees before him. But he fought the urge, for now.</p>
<p>“Harry, what are you doing up?” He asked, he had a feeling Harry was awake for the same reason he was, and when Harry’s eyes met his own the spark of attraction was unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Just couldn’t sleep, Lucius...dreams.” he met Lucius’s eyes and waited for the inevitable comment.</p>
<p>“Bad dreams?” Lucius asked, feeling his cock throb at the idea of Harry dreaming about him. Harry shook his head, yawning. That mouth looked so tempting, Lucius honestly didn’t know if he wanted to kiss it or fuck it...either or sounded nice right now.</p>
<p>“No not bad, good...very good.” His eyes met the older man’s and Lucius smirked. That was the last straw for Harry who leaned his head up and met those smirking lips with a firm kiss. Lucius gave in instantly, knocking Harry back against the chair, he pressed their lips together. Lucius’ tongue snaked out and begged entry as their lips mashed together teeth and tongue and lips all warring for dominance as he pulled Harry out of the chair and backed him into a wall. He rubbed himself against Harry. Harry moaned as his hard cock was rubbed against another hard cock. Harry bit Lucius’ lip as he moaned, and Lucius rubbed harder against him. Despite his earlier release Harry felt himself nearing the brink as he was pressed against the wall, those hips rocking against him, and that long erection stroking his, threw him over the edge and he came with a cry, embarrassingly quickly.</p>
<p>Lucius came barely a second later and Harry could feel the hot, wet, stickiness of their orgasms seeping into his pants. He didn’t move though. He was too exhausted to move as Lucius looked down and realized what they had done. He blanched even paler than usual and ran away.</p>
