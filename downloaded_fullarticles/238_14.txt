    <p>Chapter 1<br/>
</p>
<p>Just after the first potions lesson of his time at Hogwarts, Harry decided to be a friend. Ron was nice, and his first and best mate, but what happened to Neville wasn’t okay either. He told Ron he was going to go check on Neville, and that if Ron wanted to join that was okay and if he wanted to head to the common room or somewhere else, he’d meet up at dinner at the latest.<br/>
</p>
<p>Ron shrugged, “If you want to go mate, sure. I’m going to go back to the common room.”<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry nodded, then found an older student to give him directions to the hospital wing.<br/>
</p><p>On reaching the hospital wing, he met first the matron, Madam Pomfrey, who fussed over him (”You’re too skinny! Honestly”) before he managed to get word in that he wanted to see Neville. Immediately,she softened up, pointing to the bed he was in.<br/>
</p><p>Thanking her, Harry went to the bed indicated, and rather than move the curtains that were currently closed around it, let out a small clearing of his throat before saying softly, “Neville?”<br/>
</p><p>He hears a small voice inside, acknowledging his name. “It’s me, Harry. I wanted to check in on you. Did Seamus leave?”<br/>
</p><p>The curtain opens part way, the boy nodding. His face and skin looked better, but Harry could tell that it was sensitive.<br/>
</p><p>“W-why did you want to talk to m-m-me?” The chubby boy asked. “I thought y-you’d do everything with R-r-ron.”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, sure he’s my best mate, but that doesn’t mean I can’t have others. And besides, what Snape said to you earlier wasn’t right. I wanted to make sure you weren’t too hurt. Is it okay if I sit on the bed with you?”<br/>
</p><p>After receiving a nod, Harry does so, feeling as awkward as the other boy looked, but here to try it out anyways. He’d never had one friend before, and here he was - trying actively to make a second friend. From what he could see, the Gryffindor across from him was feeling much the same way.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Harry started, feeling a tad silly. “I saw you were having problems with potions.”<br/>
</p><p>Neville nodded. “P-p-professor Snape is really scary.”<br/>
</p><p>“I thought so too. He seemed to hate me, for no reason at all!”<br/>
</p><p>“I know! That seemed really weird. I’d heard stories about him from upper years, but what he was doing to you . . . A teacher shouldn’t do that.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll get that figured out. What we should do is figure out how to get both of us better grades. I feel he’s going to grade poorly based on principle - and it could be worse with his dislike of me and your discomfort around him. I had an idea if you liked?” Neville nodded again, allowing Harry to continue. “I’m really good at cooking, which is a lot of what potions is, right? And yesterday in Herbology, you were the only student besides the girl, Granger I think? To actively be answering anything the professor said.”<br/>
</p><p>Neville only looked at him, not quite understanding what the boy next to him is saying.<br/>
</p><p>“Neville, why don’t we pair up in potions? For group based ones, anyways. From what the textbook says, and from Snape’s - Professor Snape’s reaction to everything, one wrong cut could go horribly wrong. Or,” he gave a sly smile, “putting in porcupine quills while the fire is still lit.”<br/>
</p><p>Neville smiles in return. “This might work, Harry, but what about potions we do on our own? I’m doomed.”<br/>
</p><p>Harry shook his head. “No, I’m sure you won’t be. Outside of classes, I can help you learn cutting techniques, while in class, I can do them. And with your eye for plants, you can pick the freshest, or whatever form of ingredient we need, far better than I can.” He smiles sheepishly, pointing at his glasses. “I don’t wear these for fun, you know.”<br/>
</p><p>Neville finally giggles a little bit, looking surprised at first, then relaxing into what was being said.<br/>
</p><p>“I think you’re right, Harry. But. . . What about you and Ron? I don’t want to separate you two.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ron? Don’t worry so much about him. We have loads of other classes together, and it’s good for him to find some other friends to hang out with too.”<br/>
</p><p>The matron comes by, spotting the pair. “Still here, Mr Potter? Mr Longbottom, you will be allowed to leave for supper, no sooner. If you feel any fatigue from your friend here, he can go and wait for you in the Great Hall.”<br/>
</p><p>The boys nod eagerly at the matron. They had heard stories from older students that she was a stickler for forcing bedrest on students who needed it.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, Madam Pomfrey,” the two boys say together. Harry pulls out a slip of paper, handing it to Neville.<br/>
</p><p>“Here, Nev - if it’s okay to call you that?” Neville nodded. “This is the potion assignment Snape gave.”<br/>
</p><p>Neville suppresses a groan, but knows he needs to do it, and as Harry pointed out, his love of plants should help significantly in doing better. Harry grins.<br/>
</p><p>“Feel free to use me, but I may use you to find out how different plants react together more than you think.”<br/>
</p><p>Neville nodded. “You seem good at defence, or at least at practical things. If you don’t mind, I might use you to help.”<br/>
</p><p>Harry nodded enthusiastically. “Maybe we can both help Ron - he doesn’t seem to be adjusting to the workload well. I have ways of making the homework seem fun, but he likes to just skip it. I can’t afford to skip homework. Maybe you could help us do it more on time?” He was referring to the second Transfiguration lesson he had had that week, where he was doing the assignment the morning of. He knew McGonnagal would probably take points for that, noticing clearly when a student did something even the night before versus the day it was due, and it wasn’t something he wanted to get in the habit of.<br/>
</p><p>Neville smiled. “I can try, Harry. I can’t promise I’ll do much better, but with a few of us, that might be okay. Maybe we can get the other boys in the dorm in on it? Ron seems to be a social person, and we haven’t really done much together yet.”<br/>
</p><p>Harry thought for a second. “Tomorrow is Saturday, right? Why don’t we play the card game, exploding snap, was it? Or maybe gobstones seems like it would be a good option. We can play in our dorm, and try to get to know each other more.”<br/>
</p><p>Neville nodded. “I’ll tell the other boys if you tell Ron.” Then he gained his nervous look back, “Hey, Harry, do you mind if I ask you to leave? I’m a bit tired from what Madam Pomfrey had to do.”<br/>
</p><p>Harry nods quickly, getting off the bed. “Yeah, of course, Neville, I’ll see you at dinner, yeah? This was a good chance to meet you better. Thanks for letting me stay so long.” He grinned, then left, the other boy feeling happy that maybe, just maybe, he would belong somewhere.</p>
