    <p>Thank you to the wonderful beta - Sarah Artemisia</p>
<p>Chapter One - The Fall</p>
<p>Dear Hermione and Ron,</p>
<p>You are the two best of friends that anyone could ask for. I consider myself very lucky to have met the pair of you. You two have stuck with me through countless horrors and that is why I'm writing to you. I can't take it anymore and I certainly don't want to keep putting you two in danger. I don't want you to blame yourselves. Life has been too hard on me; the death of Sirius, the nightmares, Voldemort in my head...I can't take it any longer. By the time you wake up, I will be gone, and like I said I don't want you to blame yourselves, this is no one's fault.</p>
<p>The last thing I want is for you two to die because of me. Everyone has died because of me: my parents, Sirius, Cedric... I couldn't bear it if something happened to the two of you.</p>
<p>You may not believe it now, but life will be better if I wasn't in it. I'm sure you will see things my way once the shock has worn off.</p>
<p>I don't have many belongings as you two know, but I'm leaving what I have to you, Ron and Hermione. I'm entrusting the pair of you with the Marauder's Map, my invisibility cloak and the key to my vault at Gringotts. I do have one last favour to ask,</p>
<p>please look after Hedwig for me, she can hunt for her own food, she just likes some pets now and again.</p>
<p>I love you guys, and remember this is my choice,</p>
<p>- Harry</p>
<p>Harry rolled the parchment into a neat scroll, placed it in the middle of his bed along with his wand and left the dorms. He made his way quietly through the castle and out to the courtyard. It was storming outside. Harry vaguely remembered hearing about possible rain, and now it pounded on his skin like bullets. It was very unlikely any Professors or prefects would be walking in this area of castle because of the weather and Harry was glad of it.</p>
<p>He continued his walk, not taking notice of the flagstones, smoothed by the countless footsteps of students, or of the occasional flash of lightning. He knew where he was going and taking notice of the scenery would just delay the inevitable.</p>
<p>Harry let out a slight sigh as he reached the curved staircase he had been searching for and slowly made his way up to his final destination, the Astronomy Tower. He was soaking wet and shivering from the cold by the time he arrived at the top, but soon it wouldn't matter, soon it would be over.</p>
<p>He couldn't take it anymore; the pain, the hurt he caused people, it was all his fault. It was his fault that his parents were killed, his fault that Cedric was dead and it was his fault that Sirius was gone. Sirius was the last of his family and Harry had killed him. The only reason Sirius was at the department of mysteries to begin with was to save him. It scared Harry to think that it could have been even worse. He allowed himself to be lured into a trap... he could have been the reason why Mrs. Weasley had to bury two children. He could have been the reason why Mrs. Longbottom was alone. But as it now stood, he had a body count. He was at fault, and if he didn't end things soon, there would be more. Harry tightened his hands into fists, relishing the feeling of his short nails digging into the soft flesh of his palm. He knew what he had to do.</p>
<p>Harry slowly made his way to the edge of the tower and looked down, he couldn't help but think what it would be like. Flying came to mind, he just won't be coming back up. He thought about who would find him in the morning, what the papers might say.</p>
<p>"The Boy Who Lived, Dead" "The Chosen One No More" "The Boy Who Killed Himself"</p>
<p>All of these headlines came to mind, but he knew that this was the right thing to do. This way no one else would get hurt because of him.</p>
<p>He was about the jump but the voice of his most hated professor stopped him in his tracks. ...</p>
<p>Professor Snape was out collecting potion ingredients for his latest potion when he caught a glimpse of someone on top of the astronomy tower. There were typically one or two students a year who had attempted this type of stunt, so there was protocol.</p>
<p>Severus spring into action and quickly sent a silent Patronus to Albus and Poppy telling them to wait at the bottom in case if he couldn't talk the child down. Albus would be able to slow the fall down and Poppy would be able to administer any first aid.</p>
<p>Severus quickly made his way from the patch of earth he was collecting from, up to the tower just in time, those minutes the child spent thinking were the only reason he had gotten there in time. "Wait!" Severus shouted out of breath. He let out a relieved exhale as the child drew his foot back from the open sky. Severus had been in this position before and knew his normal brusque manner would only make things worse, so he adjusted his attitude. He, although quick to recognize and analyze, could do neither. He couldn't tell who the student was, due to the immense hoodie as well as the darkness that cloaked the student's features. In the past, he was able to see who the student was as well as make an educated guess as to why they were about to do the unthinkable. In the past, they were seventh year Slytherins, unwilling to obey the will of their families or the Dark Lord. To those students, he could be of assistance and offer a different path, but to this nameless child? Severus moved slowly and quietly a step towards the figure in an attempt to see better.</p>
<p>Harry slowly turned around, now no longer facing Severus.</p>
<p>"...Don't...don't come any closer, I'll jump." Harry said, his voice cracking making it unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Harry began to hyperventilate, the reality of what he was about to do set in, but that's not what worried him, what had him in an absolute panic, was the thought of being forced to live his treacherous life, his miserable life. He was about to see his parents again, it was about to be over and no greasy, hook-nosed bat would stop him.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to come any closer," Severus said gently, holding up his hands.</p>
<p>"Dr...Drop your wand...NOW" Harry yelled, stepping back towards the open window a little.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright" Severus said gently. He crouched slowly, placing his wand to the ground not wanting the child to take another step back. He rose again with the same smooth motion.</p>
<p>"...Kick it away," Harry added, letting out a small sniffle.</p>
<p>Severus gave a small nod, kicking his wand away a few feet away from him.</p>
<p>" There," Severus gently spoke, keeping his hands where the child could see them.</p>
<p>"How about we go back to my chambers? You can dry yourself off and we can talk over some tea" Severus spoke.</p>
<p>Harry quickly shook his head, bringing his arm up and to clear the tears away with his sleeve "...I don't want to go inside." Harry muttered realizing that his Professor didn't know who he was. He wanted to keep it that way.</p>
<p>"Alright...we don't have to go inside. Will you tell me your name?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head once again. "...I don't...I don't want to talk." Harry muttered.</p>
<p>"Come child, I know it may seem as if you are going through a hard time but this isn't the way" Severus spoke slowly taking a step forward.</p>
<p>"YOU KNOW NOTHING!" Harry screamed, "I SAID STAY BACK!"</p>
<p>Severus held up his hands once again "Then why don't you tell me?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head once again. " You can't stop me from doing this, I want to do this...I want it to end." Harry cried.</p>
<p>"You want what to end, child?"</p>
<p>"...The pain...I just want the pain to stop...It hurts too much and I want it to end." Harry cried "I'm sorry but I have to do this, there's no other way" Harry cried stepping off the edge.</p>
<p>"No!" Severus cried running to the edge just in time to see Albus slow the child's fall. Although magic was there to slow the impact was still a heavy "thud" that made each of the observers wince harshly. Often times magic worked against magic and in this case the child's magic worked against the headmaster's "arresto momentum " charm, allowing him to come to more harm than if the child had wanted to be saved.</p>
<p>Poppy quickly ran her wand over the child as Severus took the stairs two at a time to reach the bottom.</p>
<p>Poppy gently pushed the child's hood back, and with it, the fine hairs covering the forehead in order to begin her diagnostics.</p>
<p>"Is he alive?" Severus questioned as he made his way over to the unconscious child. However, he stopped short when he saw the famous, thin, silver, lightning bolt shaped scar.</p>
