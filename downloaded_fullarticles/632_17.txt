    <p>Disclaimer: I don't own anything that you recognise.</p><p>The aurors that broke into their director's home came across a heartbreaking sight: 20 year old Evelyn Graves clutching her father's dead body to her chest in the basement, tears rolling over her cheeks. She looked up at the aurors and simply asked one question: "where were you?" It turned out that Grindelwald had kept her under the Imperius Curse, which was lifted at his arrest, but it had been too late to save her father. The aurors all lowered their heads in guilt at the question. </p><p>The funeral was held several days later and almost everyone from MACUSA attended. A lot of people offered their condolences to Evelyn and she just nodded in answer. The witch didn't show any emotion during the funeral, even when she walked up to the casket for a final goodbye. She stroked the wood and showed the barest of smiles. "Goodbye, father." She whispered, kissing the casket, before resuming her place. The casket was slowly lowered into the ground. </p><p>Evelyn waved off any offerings to bring her home, saying that she would be fine. She apparated towards the Graves mansion and walked inside, closing the door behind her. The second that she heard the click of the door shutting, the witch broke down. She put her hand against her mouth and started to sob, collapsing on the ground. Tears fell in a never-ending steam as waves of grief threatened to overwhelm her. </p><p>It took at least an hour, before the young witch felt like she couldn't cry any more tears. Looking around the hallway, she knew that she couldn't stay here. It hurt too much at the moment to stay in her childhood home, where she and her father had been terrorised and tortured respectively. Grindelwald had threatened to torture her as well, if her father didn't co-operate. Her father had betrayed MACUSA and the magical society, just to keep her safe. </p><p>The next day, Evelyn went to Gringotts to see what her options were. The goblins let the will be read out and it turned out that her father had left her pretty much everything that he possessed. Hearing her father's voice saying that he loved her and was proud of her made Evelyn smile with tears rolling down her cheeks. The Graves family owned several estates around the world, despite being an American wizarding family, so Evelyn could pick her new home. </p><p>She decided for the one in Scotland, close to Hogwarts school of Wtchcraft and Wizardry. For several galleons, the goblins sent someone to update and strengthen the wards around the house and within a few days, it was ready to be lived in. Evelyn wrote a letter to the president, which would be delivered the day after she moved. The letter said that she needed some time to herself to grieve and mourn and that she would probably be back in a few years. </p><p>With that settled and the utterly necessary things, like clothes and a few childhood trinkets, packed in a magically expendable suitcase, Evelyn tapped a certain stone that was within the house and that would lock the wards down and keep the house in stasis, until either she or any of her descendants entered the house again.The charm would go in effect, as soon as Evelyn left the grounds.</p><p>The witch took her time walking through the house. She had already magically put her father's things in the attic for her to look at, once it didn't hurt so much anymore. She said a silent goodbye to all the memories that this house had, not knowing if she would ever return. Standing in the hallway to the living room, Evelyn took a deep breath, before apparating to the bank for the portkey, feeling the wards activate on her way out.</p><p>The goblins greeted her solemnly and gave her the portkey, saying that she was more than welcome in their branch in London. The Graves had been long-time allies with the goblins and the creatures were angry at Grindelwald for what he had done. They had special teams looking out for him to bring him to justice and they didn't care if that justice was human or goblin. Evelyn nodded at them, before grabbing the portkey and disappearing </p><p>Landing in the London establishment, Evelyn was greeted by the goblins once again, before being given another portkey to her new house. Arriving there, Evelyn looked around in distaste. It was clear that there hadn't been anyone living in this house for a while. The decoration was stuck in the mid-1800s. She jumped at hearing a pop nearby. "A new mistress! Mippy be so happy!" The small creature squeaked, before hugging the witch around the waist. Evelyn looked at her in shock. "Since when does my family have a house elf?" She asked out loud.</p><p>The small creature looked up at her. "Since a long time, mistress." She answered, before letting go and jumping up and down. "Be there any other masters or mistresses that Mippy can serve?" She asked and Evelyn's face fell. "I'm afraid that I'm the only one, Mippy. I'm sorry." She said. Mippy looked sad for a second, before looking into the witch's eyes and apparently seeing the pain in them, as she hugged Evelyn again.</p><p>"Mippy take care of you now." She said determinedly and Evelyn smiled sadly for a few seconds, before hugging the elf back. The first order that Evelyn gave Mippy was to update the interior of the house a bit and the house elf obeyed. Soon enough, the house looked a lot more liveable. In that time, Evelyn went to the magical school to see if they had a job for her.</p><p>She was in luck, as they needed a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, since the current teacher: Albus Dumbledore, was going to start teaching Transfiguration in the next year. Dumbledore, who was an old friend of Grindelwald and had heard of what happened in New York, approached Evelyn and offered his sincere apologies for what his former friend had done. Evelyn simply nodded at his words, but didn't say anything.</p><p>The next school year, professor Evelyn Graves was introduced and quickly caused a lot of whispering amongst the students. For the next three years, Evelyn, buried herself into her work, trying to forget about her grief. There was one thing stopping her from succeeding: Mippy, the motherly house elf. The creature refused to let her mistress lock her feelings away, threatening to summon a mind healer, if she didn't start mourning properly and did something with her time. </p><p>Evelyn wondered what she was supposed to do, until she read about an orphanage in the newspaper. Now 23 years old, Evelyn wondered if maybe adopting a child would do her good. She told Mippy and the house elf was instantly enthusiastic, which resulted in the witch standing in front of Wool's orphanage in London on a rainy day. The matron greeted her and led her around. The children all looked lovely and sweet. Evelyn wondered how she was supposed to only adopt one. </p><p>It wasn't until then, that she noticed a three year old boy standing in a corner. Children avoided him as if he was dangerous. Carefully approaching him, Evelyn kneeled down in front of him. "Hello there. My name is Evelyn. What is yours?" She asked. The boy replied that his name was Tom. Shaking his hand, Evelyn felt a shock going through her that told her that the boy in front of her was a wizard.</p><p>Looking into his eyes, she could see that something was wrong, but she didn't know what. Making up her mind, Evelyn walked to the matron and said that she wanted to adopt little Tom. The matron was shocked, but quickly agreed, providing the necessary paperwork for now. Signing it and getting the few personal belongings and a file with Tom's information, Evelyn carefully lifted the boy up and started to walk out.</p><p>She sighed at hearing the whispers about how they were glad that he was going. She felt Tom tightening his grip and hushed him. "It's okay, sweetie. You won't ever have to come back here. I promise." She said, while walking out of the door. The first order of business was visiting gringotts for a magical examination. Something was wrong with her son and she wanted to know what. She held the boy tightly and counted to three, before disappearing to Diagon Alley </p>
