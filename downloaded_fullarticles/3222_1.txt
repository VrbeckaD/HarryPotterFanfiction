    <p>“His lips traveled the smooth curve of her shoulder as his hand fidgeted with the clasp on her front-opening bra,” Hermione typed into the open Word document on her laptop screen. </p><p> </p><p>Since coming to America after the war, she had taken up a habit of writing erotica under the pen name of <em>TheLadyInRed</em>, when her nights in the MACUSA office were dull. It was one of the few things to keep her mind occupied. </p><p> </p><p>The brunette hadn't made many friends, even though she tried to appear approachable. Truth be told, coming here had been her attempt at a fresh start. A failed marriage that lasted less than a year, two miscarriages and lost friendships had pushed Hermione toward the opportunity of a lifetime to do in America what she had in England. The laws regarding magical creatures in America hadn’t been changed since the early 1950’s, when Newt Scamander himself had fought for magical creatures with near human intelligence. She intended to change and amend the still archaic laws that the world’s most renowned magizoologist had put in place. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hermione shook her head of all work related thoughts and focused back on her paragraph, the desire that had been building up inside her, gone. She pouted and let out a long sigh. A part of her missed romance, love and, well, toe-curling, lip-biting euphoria. However, she wasn’t sure that spark existed inside her anymore. Writing about off-the-wall, animalistic, adventurous sex was one thing; experiencing it was quite another.</p><p> </p><p>She and Ron had been through emotional hell, losing their first baby just months after the war, and the second shortly before she had accepted the job offer and walked out of the house Ron had bought to please her. Sex had fallen to the wayside before she had even left. As she remembered these moments, she reached for her full wine glass from her side table. Bringing it to her lips, she read the paragraph a third time, and got a notification of a new comment on one of her previous stories. She clicked on it.</p><p> </p><p>Each of her stories were in the ‘erotic coupling’ category and ended up quite popular. They all entailed clandestine romances between coworkers, strangers on an airplane, newly divorced friends, etc. She was used to rave reviews as such, because most people hid their desires for casual affairs and the thrill of it all. A part of her always loved reading people’s reactions, eager to know the thoughts and feelings that her words brought out in them while reading.</p><p> </p><p>When the comment finally popped up, Hermione felt a shudder start between her shoulders and creep down her spine. The screen name associated with the comment read <em>MACUSAMan</em>. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>What?! Someone from MACUSA was reading her erotica online?! Merlin sakes, she was writing for one of her co-workers! How positively mortifying!!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The comment had been left on her story titled <em>Reorganizing Her Desk</em>, where two co-workers made particular good use of a sturdy cherry desk in the woman's private office. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>This is brilliantly written, so salacious though, to do it on her desk while the boss waits outside. Tut tut, naughty girl. Still a great piece. Ever considered acting one of your stories out? You should.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione shuddered again. Someone she worked with was asking her about acting out fantasies she concocted while she was at work each day; and they were suggesting it on a workplace romance story. <em>Who is this person?! </em></p>
