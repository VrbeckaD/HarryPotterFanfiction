    <p>
  <span>It had happened so fast.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Dad was dead, he was found in the living room in a pool of blood, his own wand lodged deep into his chest. The sight of which would leave a mark on 10 year old Keith Kogane for years to come. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mom was gone too, she had vanished without a trace, moments after they had found dad’s body. The stove stopped, the lights turned off, and anything else controlled by magic dropped as easy as turning on a light switch, a safety measure, for when No-majs were near. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And just as soon as the house went dark, their neighbor, a friendly young No-maj(who often babysat Keith at times) came over. “Mr. and Mrs. Kogane? Keith?” She opened the. door. “I heard a scr-” She cut off with a cry of terror as her eyes caught onto the bloodied body on the sofa. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The No-maj police came moments after, and the Magical Congress(MC) wasn’t far behind. All Keith remembered afterwards was a woman in a crimson robe dragging him away from the scene, murmuring comforting words to the screaming child, who was still in his pajamas and gripping his stuffed hippo like it was the most important thing in the world. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Noo!! Daddy!” Keith wailed, kicking and struggling against the witch’s grip. “Ma-” Another sob. “Daddy! Please I want my dad back,” A soft murmur told him that his father was dead, killed by someone unknown, Keith cried for tens straight minutes befor- “Momma??” A new wave of tears hit as hard as the realization. “Mom!” Where’s momma?? I want my momma back!!!” Yet again, another kick to the shins from the boy, endured by the witch, who was still trying to calm him down. “Please! Where iS SHE MOMMA-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-o0o-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That was 6 months ago. (They gave him his mother’s wand, as if that was consolation.)</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was the first time death had landed on Keith’s life, and it wouldn’t stop there.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A wizard seemed to have had just about enough of the boy’s sniveling and asking for ‘momma’ and told him the following.</span>
</p>
<p> </p><ol>
<li><span> His father was dead.</span></li>
<li><span> It was nothing more than a single kill in a series of attacks by a gang nearby. </span></li>
<li><span> His mother was gone.</span></li>
<li><span> She left as soon as she saw the chance.</span></li>
<li><span> And abandoned him.</span></li>
<li><span> No one loved him anymore. </span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It did the job, he stopped crying for his family late at night, he stopped bombarding everyone around him with questions, he stopped caring, he just wanted to go home, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span> wasn’t it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was pretty long before they tracked down his godfather, a man named Takashi Shirogane. As it turns out, no one wants to deal with an orphan’s case, even a wizard’s. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But during that time, Keith jumped from one foster home to the next,  a total of 17 in the course of 5 months. He didn’t want to stay at the orphanage, and he didn’t want a new family, he wanted </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> family, why couldn’t theY SEE THAT?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>But his Godfather lived in London, </span><em><span>England.</span></em> <em><span>He was screwed</span></em><span>, Keith thought with a groan. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-o0o-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The plane trip was torture. Hours just sitting and waiting with nothing to do but stare at a wall, Keith was so uncomfortable with his chaperone that </span>
  <em>
    <span>said</span>
  </em>
  <span> chaperone was almost arrested with suspicion of abuse or kidnapping, the food on the plane itself was terrible. No one on the plane was magic, on one would listen to him, no one knew what he went through, no one </span>
  <b>cared.</b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Except for the nice man who sat next to him, and offered him a cookie after a nightmare had woken him up. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s your name?” Keith whispered up to the man.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Alfor”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Keith looked over to the seat next to him, Alfor’s curly haired daughter slept on.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After waving goodbye to Alfor and his daughter, Allura, Keith got off the plane-  a little wobbly- and carefully unfurled the instructions his chaperone(who got off the plane in Tokyo) left him. All it said was: </span>
</p>
<p> </p><ol>
<li><span> Find Takashi Shirogane.</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Keith refurled the instructions and tore them up in a small fit of rage, and after a moment-… awkwardly put them in the trash. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tying his jacket into his waist, he picked up his backpack full of clothes and thought, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m smart, I- I can figure this out, maybe Europe’ll be better than America… </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He knew better then to ask for help, so Keith searched the entire airport before finally arriving at the entrance, losing hop-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Pardon me, ma’am? I’m looking for my godson? He’s about… yeh big-” A rather young man was questioning a No-maj woman. He had black hair which looked like it was under a baseball cap for far too long, and was wearing a canary yellow and black, striped, scarf. He was describing </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span> in… okay detail. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Keith ran up to the man and almost yelled, with much relief in his voice, “Are you Takashi Shirogane??”</span>
