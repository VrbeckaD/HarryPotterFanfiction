    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>It was the most wonderful time of the year or at least that’s what everyone always said. However for a certain seventh year Slytherin it was never a time she enjoyed. She hoped this year would be different, she was staying at Hogwarts for Christmas, like she always had. This year was her last though, and she finally made a friend she knew she would be spending Christmas eve with. In past years she had stayed in her dorm alone, at least when it was not a full moon. The elves sending over food for her.</p>
<p>Everyone was getting ready to leave and her dorm was noisy with the sound of girls packing and chatting about their vacation plans. Nova Craven was sitting on her bed, looking at an advanced potions textbook. She tried drowning out the noise but found it useless. Sighing she got up grabbing her wand and book she made her way out. Not sure where she was heading she followed her feet. As she was staring at her feet she didn’t notice a person walking down the hall in front of her. That is until she was on her butt. She looked up preparing to yell and ended up smiling.</p>
<p> “Oh Professor Lupin I’m sorry. I didn’t see you,” she said taking his hand.</p>
<p> “That’s alright Miss Craven, I know we’re both out of sorts this time of month,” he replied in a hushed voice. Nova nodded with a grimace before pulling herself upright. </p>
<p>“I was just heading somewhere quiet. Trying to study up on potions. I hope to continue my studies after graduation so I will be able to brew the wolfsbane potion. Selling it at a decent price for all people with our affliction,” she said the last part quietly as she looked around the hall. They were alone but she was always overly cautious. She was already picked on enough- not only by her housemates but from other houses as well- there was no way she was letting the fact she was a werewolf get out to the school.  </p>
<p>“That’s very nice and ambitious of you Miss Craven. The wolfsbane potion can be difficult to concoct,” he said turning to start walking the direction Nova had been heading. </p>
<p>“Have you been taking your potions?” he asked gesturing for her to walk alongside him. She nodded, standing by him her head was about level with his chest, she like him had scars all over her body and a few light ones on her face, deeper ones along her neck. She grew her dark brown hair out long to hide them as best she could. She clutched her book close to her chest walking in silence with her professor. They had grown close over the school year so far, since they were both afflicted with lycanthropy They understood each other on a deeper level than anyone else they had known, ever did. </p>
<p>On occasion they would have moments like these where they walked together talking. Nova had only ever known cruelty, and isolation. Remus Lupin changed all that, when he first arrived at Hogwarts. The Headmaster had designed it so they picked up their first dose of wolfsbane potion for the year from Professor Snape at the same time. Subsequently learning that the other was a werewolf. At first Nova was uneasy and nervous the only werewolf she had ever met was Greyback when she was nine. </p>
<p>She had been in the woods near her house heading home from collecting food from the nearby market. Her mom often sent her out, though usually earlier in the day. Today however her mother Dottie had forgotten and sent her out last minute. As she made her way home she was lost in thought, the full moon high in the sky lighting her way. She was caught off guard as something bit into her shoulder. She let out a loud blood curdling scream, tears pouring down her face. The thing disappeared as fast as it had come upon her. Running home she held tightly to her wound and groceries, knowing her mom would be livid if she lost them, no matter what had just transpired. </p>
<p>The next full moon she was locked in her basement under her mother's suspicion. She turned into a werewolf, it was the most painful thing she had experienced. The next morning was awful, her parents not saying anything to her at all. She went outside to play in the woods wanting to forget the horrible pain of the night before. That was when she first ran into the man form of Greyback. He tried to get her to join his pack but somehow she managed to escape back to her house. </p>
<p>Professor Lupin however saw her unease when they met and asked if he could have a moment alone with her. Snape left with a nod. After her experiences with Greyback she was put on edge being alone with the new werewolf. </p>
<p>“Ssh, I won’t hurt you,” he said approaching her cautiously. Something in his voice made her relax, she was caught off guard as he started asking questions. Showing an interest in her was something no one did. </p>
<p>“Did you hear me?” Professor Lupin asked touching her shoulder lightly causing Nova to jump out of her thoughts.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I was thinking about… well about when I was attacked. It’s still so fresh in my mind even though it has been eight years. So much happened after that. After the first full moon my muggle father left the next night, saying magic was one thing but he had not signed up for having a monster for a daughter. I think the only reason my mother stuck around was: one she knew, or at least hoped I’d be accepted to Hogwarts so she only had to deal with my furry issue three times a year once I was accepted. Two she felt obligated to raise me, if you can call it that. </p>
<p>Plus Greyback showing up every year on the anniversary to get me to join him really sucks. It was hard to deny him at first but somehow I managed. It’s a lot easier now and this year if I see him I’ll be able to look him in the eye and tell him to go fuck himself. For once in my life I’ve known true kindness and I will not be swayed to his side,” she said finishing her speech with a fiery look in her hazel eyes. </p>
<p>Blushing she looked around and ducked her head as she realized what she had just told her professor. To her surprise she heard him let out a laugh. </p>
<p>“I like your spirit Miss Craven, as you know Greyback turned me as well. Growing up I did my best to hide away from him, but I fear -from what I’ve heard of your life- I’ve had a slightly easier life, at least at your age. I had amazing friends who showed me love and were always there even after finding out about my furry problem and my parents still loved me. You’ve been through so much, I wish I wasn’t the only one who has shown you kindness,” he said looking down at Nova sadly as they continued to walk.</p>
<p>“I mean the professors are never mean to me, even Professor Snape is nice to me teaching me about potions a bit more in depth, letting me borrow his books. Professor McGonagall helped me get to the shack each full moon, before you came here anyways. Than there is the headmaster who lets me go to this school. You are the first though out of everyone at Hogwarts who has talked to me more than just to hurl insults at me. I thank you very much for that Professor and I hope we can stay in touch once the school year ends?” She asked looking at him with a small smile on her face.</p>
<p>“I agree we should. I expect great things from you in the future Miss Craven. Even though you are my student, with the time we’ve spent together I’d like to call you my friend. Would you agree?” he asked Nova looking over at her with a tentative smile. She beamed up at him never having a friend before she felt delighted to call Professor Lupin hers. She nodded at him, </p>
<p>“I would be honored to consider you my friend and be considered yours,” she said her tone happier than it had ever been before. </p>
<p>“Well it is late and this is my office, you should head back to your bed. I will see you tomorrow night,” he said looking around before embracing Nova in what had to be her first hug in a very long time. At first she was unsure but soon was clinging to him, the hug ending to fast for either of them. </p>
<p>“Tomorrow,” Nova said a little flushed as she turned to head back to her common room. Once she was back, she laid in her bed. The dorm now quiet she lay in bed recalling the hug as she fell into a peaceful sleep.<br/>
Waking the next morning she was happy to find everyone in her dorm gone. Even happier when she realized she was the only Slytherin to stay behind this Holiday. She sat in the common room by the fire, spending all day looking at her books. Switching between defence against the dark arts and potions. She had classical music playing in the background she felt a bit wired since it was the full moon that night. Deciding she’d had enough she got dressed in warm clothes and boots before making her way outside to jog around the black lake. </p>
<p>“Great day for a jog I suppose,” she heard a male voice say next to her as she made her way around the lake at a steady jog. </p>
<p>“Oh Professor you startled me a bit,” she said with a laugh as he jogged alongside her. </p>
<p>“I saw you from my window thought I’d join you, I was feeling a bit caged in my room,” he told her picking up the pace slightly. Nova nodded beside him, increasing her pace as well. They stayed silent as they jogged along the lake, before they knew it the sun was setting and they quickly jogged over to the whomping willow. </p>
<p>“After you,” Remus said after immobilizing the large tree gesturing to the hidden tunnel. Nova went inside closely followed by the professor. Before they knew it they had arrived in the shrieking shack. </p>
<p>“Happy Christmas eve Professor Lupin,” Nova said preparing for the turn. It was always so painful.</p>
<p> “Please when we’re alone you can call me Remus, and I shall call you Nova if that’s alright with you?” he asked as he began taking off his clothes. This was something that surprisingly never bothered either of them. It was most likely the werewolves in them that didn’t care about modesty. </p>
<p>“I will do that Remus,” Nova said as she began to undress as well. They both felt the instant the sun went down fully. The change came on sudden and painful. Bones stretching, growing under skin. Soon two werewolves stood on four legs in the room. Both Remus and Nova still conscious of themselves thanks to the potion. Remus was the werewolf with short grey hair that stood in the broken room next to a she wolf with short brown hair. They sniffed at each other a bit before they started to wrestle around like they had done each month before. It helped get out their pent up energy and soon they were curled up around each other on the floor. Nova’s last thought before she fell asleep was wishing all her full moons would all be like the ones she had with Remus. </p>
<p>The next morning they woke up sore and tired like every morning after they had had before. They got dressed in silence. </p>
<p>“You could come spend the day with me. You need rest as well,” Remus said looking over at Nova once she was dressed. </p>
<p>“I have to make an appearance at the feast and then I shall join you if that is alright?” she asked dusting off her pants. </p>
<p>“Yes of course, if I don’t answer you may enter my chambers regardless, the password is mischief,” he said to her with a ghost of a smile before leading them from the shack. </p>
<p>They parted ways once they reached the castle. Remus heading to bed, Nova heading to her dorm to put on some makeup and straighten up before lunch. Once she reached her dorm she took a long hot shower relaxing her sore muscles. In just a towel she made her way to her bed pulling out her makeup she fixed her complexion so no one could see how  pale she looked from last night. Once she was satisfied she put on a green dress that stopped by her knees and hugged her curves not that she had a lot to hug. She grabbed a package out of her trunk and shrank it; putting it in a silver clutch she had taken from her mother, before heading to the great hall.</p>
<p>It was decorated the same as it had always been twelve Christmas trees, glittering with golden stars. The ceiling snowing lightly to a certain level and then the snow melting. In the center of the room instead of the house tables there was now just one table. The others had been pushed against the walls. At the table already sat Headmaster Dumbledore, Professors McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick along with the caretaker Mr. Filch. There were two other students there besides herself and three other seats.<br/>
As she sat down, Harry Potter and his two friends Ron and Hermione came in. Nova had never really talked with them but everyone knew of them. As they dug into the food the divination teacher, Professor Trelawney entered the great hall. Nova had never put much stock in divination preferring ancient runes instead. </p>
<p>She listened as Professor Trelawney started spouting off about thirteen dining together meant the first to rise would die. She didn’t pay much attention to any of the conversations until Remus’ name was mentioned. She tensed a little as they talked about the potion, Nova felt the Headmaster had gone to far mentioning the potion and Remus in the same sentence it was practically<br/>
obvious the connection. </p>
<p>It felt weird even in her head to call him Remus but it was so pleasant she did not want to stop. Nova mainly picked at her food, not having much of an appetite. As usual not one person talked to her, not any of the Professors, not any of the students. Including Hermione who kept staring at her, Nova felt that Hermione had put two and two together about what she and Remus were. She decided not to bring it up however not wanting to encourage the girl.</p>
<p>Eventually Harry and Ron rose from the table causing Professor Trelawney to gasp and ask which of them got up first. Neither of them was sure and left the Great Hall after seeing if Hermione was going to join them, much to Nova’s dissatisfaction she stayed behind saying she had to speak with Professor McGonagall. She was still staring at Nova however.</p>
<p>Nova glared at the girl, leaving the Great Hall before the girl could say anything. She tried to relax and forget about Hermione as she made her way to Remus’ chambers. She went to his office finding it empty she made her way to the door of his chambers looking around his office as she did so. ‘Maybe someday I will be a potions professor,’ Nova thought to herself wistfully. </p>
<p>She knocked a few times with no answer at all. “Mischief,” she said to the door before opening the door. Inside was like a small apartment there was a small cozy living room with a brown couch next to a roaring fireplace. There was a comfortable looking chair next to it, and a large bookcase on the wall left of the fireplace. The room next to it was a tiny kitchen with a sink and ice box, a small gas stove next to the sink. Nova didn’t see him anywhere so she ventured into the short hall that led into his room. She was uneasy about going into his room but she wanted to wake him. </p>
<p>She changed her mind however when she saw him sound asleep. It was the most relaxed she had ever seen him. Leaving as quietly as she entered she went back to his bookshelf and scanned it before grabbing a book that looked interesting and sat on the couch. Soon she was lost in the book. After a while she was startled as a hand touched her shoulder. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry didn’t mean to scare you,” Remus said as he looked down at Nova. </p>
<p>“It’s okay,” she said patting the spot on the couch next to her, before closing the book. He walked around the couch and sat down beside her. He was under dressed compared to how she usually saw him, only wearing a short sleeved shirt and some pajama pants. He smiled at her sheepishly after looking her over.</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m not as dressed up as you are,” he said rubbing the back of his head. </p>
<p>“Oh this was mainly for lunch, wanted to look good for all the people staring but not saying anything,” she finished glaring at the fire she was both used to and tired of people not saying anything to her. It was not this hard before she met Remus, but she would not trade his friendship for anything. Smiling up at him she pulled out the shrunken package and made it normal once more before handing it to him.</p>
<p> “I got this for you, it’s not much but hopefully you like it,” she said watching as Remus started to open it.</p>
<p>“Nova it’s beautiful you didn’t have to get me anything. I love it though thank you,” he said as he held up a new travel cloak. It was black and lined with fur for added warmth. </p>
<p>“I wanted to, plus friends exchange gifts for christmas. It’s the first time I’ve ever been able to do this,” she said smiling brightly at the fact he liked it. She had been working every summer since she started going to school at Hogwarts, at first just doing odd jobs for neighbors and then this last year she got a steady job. The more time away from her mother the better she thought. Since she had no friends she had been able to save all her money. Now having a decent amount she didn’t mind buying something for Remus. Actually picking it out was quite enjoyable.<br/>
She was surprised as Remus raised his wand and summoned a package of his own.</p>
<p> “Well great minds think alike, I got this for you,” he said handing her the package wrapped in blue. It had been a long time since she had received a gift. Her mom had stopped giving her presents when her dad left. She tentatively opened it, under the wrapping was a black jewelry box. She looked up at Remus questioningly, he gestured for her to keep going saying nothing. Inside was simple green jeweled necklace with a wolf pendant in the center. The wolf was howling, as she touched it she was speechless. </p>
<p>“I hope it’s alright. I transfigured it myself,” he said as he worried about her silence. He jumped a bit as he realized that Nova was crying. </p>
<p>“I’m so sorry don’t cry. I’ll take it back if you want,” he said frantically. As he reached for the gift Nova pressed it close to her chest. </p>
<p>“Don’t you dare, I will not give this up to you or anyone for anything,” she said tears streaming down her face as she clutched the box tight to her chest.</p>
<p>“Darling I won’t take it, calm down. You can keep it,” Remus said softly. He slid closer to her, taking her in his arms he held her close while she cried on his chest. Nova had never received something so nice. No one had ever put so much thought into her. </p>
<p>The tears wouldn’t stop as the pain of close to nine years of rejection and isolation hit her all at once. She felt that as well as no one until now had ever understood her, no one had ever understood Remus the way she did. She knew deep down that he was in great pain as well though she didn’t know fully why, yet her crying grew harder as she thought of the pain she sensed in him. This kind man deserved the world and she desperately wished she could ease his pain. All she could do was cling to him and cry as she let herself feel everything.<br/>
Remus let her, rubbing her back and humming quietly until her tears ran out and she just laid against him. </p>
<p>“Are you okay Nova?” he asked, his voice heavy with concern. Nova could not find the words yet so she just nodded. She felt bad but she did not want to leave Remus’ arms, he had not pushed her away so she laid there her head turned to the fire.</p>
<p> “Does it ever get better?” She finally asked him, her voice hoarse from crying.</p>
<p> “Honestly no,” he said with a sigh. “If you can do what you want though and become a potions master providing us with the little ounce of peace, well than the transformations are better. The people they never get better, there are some few who look past who we are. I’m sorry you have known none. I will make sure to help you as best I can. From what I hear of your mother you will be out on the streets once you graduate I assume?” he asked a bit of anger in his tone. </p>
<p>“Yes, I have some money saved but I’m not sure it’s enough,” she said sullenly. She tried often not to think about it. </p>
<p>“I know it’s not really precedent but I would like you to come stay with me once you graduate. It’s not much of a place but it’s secure for transformations. Without the potion we will be left mindless. It will be safer if we’re together instead of you out their unsecured. Especially with Greyback wanting you. If you’re out there transformed on your own he could easily will you to submit and join his pack. I don’t want that for you. I know it has only been a few months we’ve known each other, but I care for you Nova. You are my friend and you deserve a good life, I want to help you please let me,” he finished looking at her. During his speech she had sat up looking at him as he spoke. </p>
<p>She almost started crying again but held strong. Part of her wanted to decline but she knew he was right, Greyback would get her or worse she would kill someone. She was shunned enough, she could not kill someone. She studied his face, making sure he was sincere. After a moment she nodded and hugged him once more, she was overwhelmed with relief now that she had somewhere to go after school was over. </p>
<p>“Thank you Remus I will make sure to pull my weight and if I’m able to brew the wolfsbane potion you will get free doses for life,” she said with a laugh.<br/>
He smiled at her relieved that things went the way he wanted. He knew people would talk since she was so much younger than him but at that moment he did not care. He wanted to help his friend. Remus wanted to help her not only by giving her shelter but hopefully showing her kindness, and kindness in the world, if he could find it. </p>
<p>They spent the rest of Christmas, both chatting lightly, both now hopeful for the future. Nova proudly wore her new necklace. It was now her most prized possession. </p>
<p>“This has been a wonderful Christmas Remus, thank you,” Nova said as she stared into the fire. </p>
<p>“It has been the best one I’ve had in a long time,” Remus said. Nova looked at him and could tell he was thinking of something that caused him both joy and pain. </p>
<p>Much to Nova’s surprise she found herself saying, “I hope someday I can ease your pain Remus,” she turned quickly back to the fire. </p>
<p>Unnoticed to her, Remus smiled warmly at her, touched by the fact she was thinking of him. Indeed this was a wonderful Christmas. They finished out the night in content silence before Nova headed back to her dorm. Looking forward to finishing out her last year of school, and moving on with her life.</p>
