    <p>For all he was worth, Harry Potter prided himself on being strong. After his parents' untimely deaths, he had spent most of his teenage years cared for by his aunt and uncle, eventually making it out in one piece when he had been old enough to move out. There had been no choice but to learn to care for himself, isolated despite his friends' best efforts, fine to the degree that he could possibly be.</p><p>Thus, he had never felt as much of a fraud as when he woke up panting from yet another nightmare. A scream was lodged in his throat, and to his horror, he found his pyjamas soaking wet, and not only from sweat. His body burned in spite of the open window, his head throbbing, eyes unfocused as he frantically, blindly reached over to the other side of the bed as if Ginny would still be there.</p><p>When everything came back to him and he had finally managed to put his glasses on, he thought that yeah, it was probably for the best that she was not there anymore. Being with somebody like him took its toll, he thought, and scoffed as his sticky pyjama bottoms clung to his legs when he sat up. Still, disregarding his best efforts, his heart stung at the thought of Ginny.</p><p>After his pyjamas were safely stored in a plastic bag in the washing bin, there was no distraction from the painful thud thud thud of his heart. It kept him on his toes, and there was no way he would ever be able to go back to sleep in such a condition. He therefore took to pacing, biting at the cuticles of his thumb until all that was left was an unattractive mess. </p><p>"Fuck," he said as he dialed his go-to, somebody who always knew just how to calm him down.</p><p>"Harry? It's six in the morning," came Hermione's reply, groggy with sleep. When Harry was unable to reply, she tentatively asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p>"Sorry about calling," Harry said. "I didn't realise how early it was… I just… I had a nightmare, I think," he said, still pacing, still biting his thumb until he jammed it in his pocket.</p><p>"Wh - About what?" Hermione said, sounding slightly more awake than before.</p><p>"I don't know, I was just wondering, sort of, if maybe we could meet up today?"</p><p>"Oh, Harry," she said, and Harry winced at the pity in her voice. "I'd really like to, but we've got the ultrasound today, remember?"</p><p>"Oh yeah, of course," Harry said, cursing himself for even picking up the phone in the first place. Having been awake for a good fifteen minutes already, it seemed quite stupid to keep talking, keep holding her up.</p><p>"You should come over for dinner tonight, though," Hermione said. Before Harry could say anything, Hermione continued, "Ginny won't be there. Just you, me, and Ron. Would that be good?"</p><p>Harry could not help the feeling that Hermione was only inviting him over out of pity.</p><p>"Yeah," Harry agreed after a few seconds of silence. "What time?"</p><p> </p><p>In all honesty, Harry was exhausted. He was so bloody exhausted of always being so strong, all the time, everywhere he went. The pitying glances and thoughtful hands on his shoulder had been comforting for the first while, when he was still young and naive, when the hole his parents had left was still bruised and gaping, absolutely begging to be filled by empty assurances. Now, they stood out as the falsities they were.</p><p>Thus, he had to be strong. If even one more person asked him <i>but how are you, really?</i> he might just go insane.</p><p>To make matter worse, the way he was treated at the police academy was borderline appalling. He had passed his physicals just fine, above average, in fact, but that was no reason the instructors should treat him as if he was royalty. </p><p>
  <i>"Your parents' sacrifice, mister Potter! We owe them a whole lot!"</i>
</p><p>Fucking bullshit.</p><p><i>Sacrifice,</i> Harry snorted. All his parents had done was to be cops, in service, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and get murdered by a couple of gang members in a public enough way to spark national outrage. That was it. Yet the entire precinct welcomed Harry with open arms and adoration he did not deserve.</p><p>When the day ended, Harry could not get out fast enough, hastily changing into his civilian clothes and rushing off to catch the tube, as to be on time for dinner with Hermione and Ron.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm just saying, Harry, I think maybe you should consider talking to somebody," Hermione said, voice getting higher with desperation. As if trying to calm herself, she had resorted to stroking the bulge of her stomach growing bigger with each passing month. The thought of the life growing inside of her was enough to momentarily distract Harry from what she had just said, but when he snapped back to reality and her kind brown eyes, he scoffed </p><p>"I can take care of it myself. They're just nightmares, Hermione, I've had them since I was fourteen."</p><p>Hermione looked over to Ron, eyes wide and pleading for him to interject. "Mate, don't take this the wrong way, but please accept our help."</p><p>Pleased with his response, Hermione nodded. "Besides, didn't you say the nightmares have gotten worse since you started at the academy?"</p><p>The abandoned, empty plates lay spread across the table, and Harry busied himself, avoided eye contact by toying with the fork on his plate. </p><p>"Harry," Hermione said, pulling him away from his momentary distraction. "I can't stand to see you break like this."</p><p>Her fingers danced over his forearm, and it took everything in him not to flinch. Then, when her eyes grew wider and to Harry's surprise, even Ron nodded, Harry sighed. "Fine. I'll contact them."</p><p>When he said goodbye to them, when he saw their smiles, wished them a good night, the forefront of his mind could only focus on the pleased smile that had adorned both their faces when he had agreed to 'get help', whatever that meant. Of course, with a baby on the way, having Harry out of the way had to be a relief.</p>
