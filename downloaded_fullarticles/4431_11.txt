          <div class="userstuff"><p>Over and over I hit my head against the wall. It was especially hard when it was your birthday last June but now it is exactly one year since you took your life. And I realized it has been a full year of me existing without you. The world keeps spinning but I want it to stay still.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stop, just stop!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't even know to whom I'm yelling. Running my hand over my nest of a hair, I grab and pull. It feels like my nose is barely out of water and my lungs are filled, dragging me down, down into a spiral that dragged you down. The fireplace blares brightly all of a sudden but it closes off just as quickly. I know they are trying to reach me but I think I'm allowed this silence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The rain pelts hard against the windows of Number 12, compensating for my tears that had ran dry months ago. For a full year I am living in a world where there is no you in it. I kept going while you are stuck in time. I aged when you stay the same. What good is this world that has broken and bruised you beyond repair? What good is this world I saved, Draco?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I saved you, but not from yourself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The fireplace blares against and the wards are tingling, heavy against the back of my mind. I'm so exhausted, love. The one that I want to share this sorrow and pain with is the one causing it. You broke me and yet I want you to put me back together again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where is the logic in that, Potter?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I imagines that is what you would drawl at me, lips tilted just so, displaying that smirk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Logic doesn't matter now though when I was the one who buried you. I put you in the ground and turned around with the hope of your arms around me. Logic? Logic ceased working when I call your name and you don't answer. There is no logic when I touched your cold fingers and they didn't grasp back. What good am I without you here?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It has been a year and it is not getting easier. Now it is too much for me to bear. Please wait for me, Draco, for I am coming to you because what good is this world for me without you in it?</p></div>
