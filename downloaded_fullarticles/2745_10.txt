    <p>Two Bridges, New York City, 1915</p><p>The toebox of Samuel’s left shoe begins to pinch as he climbs back down the slanted tenement steps at 95 Henry Street. He checks his watch - quarter past noon - and whistles a sigh of relief through chipped front teeth.</p><p>On paper the residents of 3B make for a sorry story: the 37 year-old Italian father, plasterer, illiterate, out of gainful employment, not naturalized. His 34 year-old wife illiterate, no English, flower-maker at forty cents a thousand with a nine dollar rent for two rooms with a bucked ceiling and oily wallpaper, and the five girls: 14, 12, 10, 6, 2 and one half. Also flower makers, the whole bunch, down to the little one unsticking paper petals from the bundle sent in by the factory. On a school day. No natural light. Bugs on the walls. Oldest girl with a cough. No license for home finishing work.</p><p>Frowning, Samuel sighs again and scribbles, “truancy officer”, “dept labor”, and “dept sanit” before closing his pad and stepping out into the street. The domino-stack row of tenements, shops, and synagogues along the intersection of Pike and Henry make his last half a block before lunch. With any luck, he thinks, this last place will be empty.</p><p>He had waited to enter the odd little church until the residents of the tenements and two flophouses had been neatly recorded. Something about its dark windows, its smallness and stillness amidst the bustle of the rest of the block unnerves him.</p><p>Even its name is alarming - The New Salem Philanthropic Society. Most of the families in 95 had listed themselves as beneficiaries of its soup kitchen, including the illegal sweatshop in 3B.</p><p>It’s almost ostentatious in its modesty, Samuel thinks, with its sheet metal cladding.<br/>
Hopefully nobody home. He peers inside.<br/>
The windows are dark and lifeless as glass eyes.<br/>
Sighing a third time, he knocks on the door.</p><p>The child that greets him looks like something out of an old schoolbook illustration of Puritan settlers, a pale face framed by an uneven square cropped haircut in an even smaller child’s cord suit. He thinks briefly of the rag doll he had given his sister’s eldest for her birthday with its scrapcloth jacket and shorts.</p><p>“Census,” Samuel says. The little Puritan’s eyes flicker across the pad and pen, and then he steps aside wordlessly, his chest caving inward as though to remove itself as an obstacle from Samuel’s path.</p><p>“Your father or mother home, kid? Or whoever’s responsible for you?”</p><p>This kid’s entire body is lines - long, thin limbs like spider’s legs and dark eyes - serious like the village kids back home. Refugees now, what’s left of them. If the newspapers are anything to go by.</p><p>He checks his watch again as the kid gestures them down the plain entrance hall, past a bench of folded clothing and a line of scuffed boots.</p><p>“Yes, sir, Mister -”</p><p>“Kouramjian.”</p><p>“This way, Mr. Kouram-jee-an.”</p><p>The church looks older than it possibly could be. Its scratched wooden walls and floors creak and shift underfoot like ship’s boarding, and the air smells heavy like after-rain. Three small girls sit with unnatural stillness around a massive table, shifting leaflets into piles. As pale as the first kid, their hair in neat braids. They look up with wide fixed eyes, return to their work.</p><p>Truancy officer, Sam writes.</p><p>The kid leads him past the table to a little cooking alcove where a woman in an old-fashioned black dress stirs soup in a pot the size of a small chair.</p><p>“Who is it, Credence?” she asks without turning.</p><p>“Census man, Ma,” says the kid quietly, curves inward again as she straightens to face them. “Mr. Kouramjian.”</p><p>“Mind the soup.” Wiping her hands on a dishcloth, her voice losing its edge, she glances him over. Sweeps a strand of brown hair back into the bun piled loosely on her head. Nods. “I’ll just be right with you, Mr. Kouramjian. One moment.”</p><p>Over the course of the week’s sampling, Samuel has been inside the filthiest tenement flats. He’s stepped over roaches and rats, watched babies play on the greasy floors where parents and lodgers drank or worked or both. The Lower East Side is crowded with barefoot hollow-eyed kids on dirty floors, overworked and underfed and badly needing sunlight and sleep and a square meal. This is different, off. Uncomfortable in a way that needles under Samuel’s skin despite the cleanliness and the girls in their linen dresses and stockings and boots.</p><p>Everything is shabby but proud, an aesthetic Samuel assigns automatically to Puritanism. Only the boy - Credence - is wearing clothes that don’t fit. He scuttles like a pigeon over to the stove and the pot while his Ma disappears into an adjoining room that Samuel hadn’t noticed.</p><p>“Say, ma’am -“ His eyes linger on Credence at the stove. The boy has his back turned, stooped like an old man’s. He jumps at the sudden noise and drops the ladle with a clatter, scrambles after it. “Say, ma’am, don’t you know all these kids should be in school today? We got truancy laws -”</p><p>“These documents,” says the woman as she emerges, “should give you all the information you need to complete your survey, Mr. Kouramjian.”</p><p>She presses the documents, organized in a folio, into Samuel’s hands and adds in a voice like a rap to the knuckles, “The soup, Credence.”</p><p>Something about this place is wrong, Samuel thinks. There is no department he can report it to. Nothing illegal about kids sorting leaflets, as long as she gets them to school, but it’s not the leaflets or even the truancy he feels like a douse of cold water down the back of his neck.</p><p>He sidesteps back into the center of the room, where Credence’s eyes follow, wide and spooked like the bread cart horse without his blinkers, holding the soup ladle at a funny angle, pressed gingerly between thumb and forefinger. He ducks under his mother’s look. Samuel blinks.</p><p>“Thanks, ma’am. I’ll just look them over at the table here, if you don’t mind.”</p><p>“I don’t mind at all, Mr. Kouramjian.”</p><p>None of the girls stir as Samuel joins them at the corner of the large table. Their leaflets rustle, but there is no giggling or humming like he’d heard in 3B, or in any of the other tenements where families worked finishing shirts or coats or gloves or flowers, licensed or not.</p><p>He opens the folio to rifle through the stack of papers and frowns.</p><p>“There ain’t nothing in here about the kids, ma’am - Missus, uh, Mrs. Barebone.”</p><p>“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>“The kids,” Samuel insists, gesturing the spider-leg boy at the stove and the pot with its thin vegetable broth. “These kids. These girls working here on a school day. And that kid shouldn’t be stirring no soup pot at noon on a Tuesday afternoon, Mrs. Barebone. All due respect. Kids oughta be in school learning ciphers and letters and all that. We got laws here, Mrs. Barebone. This ain’t the Wild West.”</p><p>She freezes with the dishcloth and a wet bowl in hand, but it’s Credence he finds himself looking to again, standing stiffly and folded in on himself with the seams of the cord jacket taut around his shoulders; Credence’s eyes are still wild, flickering between his mother’s placid dish drying, the girls, and Samuel at the table.</p><p>“What would you like to know about my children, Mr. Kouramjian?” Mrs. Barebone asks finally. Her eyes, Samuel thinks, are uncomfortably blue. Midwestern cornflower. Mayflower. His fingers jolt reflexively around the pen, but there is no department for this.</p><p>Credence, at the pot, murmurs something quietly to his mother and drops his gaze.</p><p>What he wants to know - Samuel frowns again, rubs his mouth around the chipped front teeth. His questions are fleeing, water through an open drain, as soon as he can think of them. Do the kids go to school, he thinks. And why do these kids look like mourners at a wake, and then it occurs to him that the issue is not important. These are not his kids, nor his sister’s kids. He shuffles the papers around in the folio, tapping his teeth, but his mind will not settle on any one question in particular.<br/>
Credence’s eyes are on him again, spooked horse.<br/>
He wonders how long the kid has been looking and checks his watch. It’s incredibly late. He had wanted to get lunch before heading uptown.</p><p>“You know, ma’am,” Samuel hears himself announce. “I think I have everything I need right here.” He shuffles the papers again under Credence’s dark stare. The watchful refugee. Reports of fire and forced marches. No more cousins in Arapkir, survivors fled to Damascus and Constantinople. He feels dizzy.</p><p>“I’ll get the door, Ma,” says Credence softly. Samuel feels his body unfolding itself from over the table. The littlest girl (he thinks of 3B and 14, 12, 10, 6, 2 and half) returns the papers to the folio for him.</p><p>“God go with you, Mr. Kouramjian,” says Mrs. Barebone.</p><p>Samuel tips his hat, thinks: Puritans. His shoe pinches.</p><p>“Wait,” he says, tongue tingling like it fell asleep. Like it isn’t quite his anymore. He reaches into his pocket for a small fold of bills and extracts one. “Here’s five bucks.” His hand certainly feels solid enough, slapping it flat onto the table. A small relief, although he can’t remember why he should feel relieved.  “Buy the kid a new suit, will you?”</p><p>He turns on his heel and strides back down the entrance corridor before the boy or his mother has a chance to follow. Lunch, thinks Samuel, and he feels lighter as each stride puts another foot of pavement between him and the little church.</p><p> </p>
