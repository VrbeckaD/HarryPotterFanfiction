    <p>Somehow, with the overthrow of a dictator, some legislations always stick. Not because someone had forgotten about them, but because they were considered good ideas with the wrong intention. You could watch this phenomenon happen with every revolution worldwide.</p><p>The compulsory schooling was the one that stuck after Voldemort’s demise. Everyone was now obliged to attend Hogwarts, at least till their O.W.L.s, except those attending Hogwarts 6th and 7th grade in 1998. Since that year was coined by Voldemort’s pureblood-supremacy ideology, everyone that went to school that year had to come back for an additional year. It was in hope to counteract every lingering effect the poisoned education had to the beliefs of the students. At least, that was the official reason. The idea suggested itself, that someone preferred having them all in a controlled environment while the so-called adults tried to kick what was left from the pre-war society.</p><p>Draco thought it idiotic that the society was really afraid that a bunch of school kids could overpower the latest government and install a new leader in alignment with their beliefs – whatever those might be. Still –  that that was exactly what happened to the Voldemort legislation. Their fear was probably not as idiotic as Draco had first thought – BUT, and there was always a but nowadays, there were few things more off-putting from a New-Voldemort-reign than nine months of hell in Hogwarts under the Carrols, in his opinion. </p><p>Well, since no one bothered for his opinion anymore, no one would listen to his newfound wisdom. Their loss, not his – definitely. Next to another year in Hogwarts, the newborn fear of school kids had gained him a new mandatory subject. Every pureblood was now obliged to sit in Muggle studies twice a week and with every pureblood they meant EVERY pureblood. Hence, he was spending his Monday mornings with Weasley, She-Weasley (he tried to turn back the insults – it was a slow process, no one seemed to appreciate his efforts) and Mr Snake-Slayer himself. </p><p>The Weasley’s had great enthusiasm going for them, but not much more. Draco always thought their father was some kind of expert for muggle stuff but, if he was, he hadn’t taught his children much of it. They were more or less useless when it came to using all the muggle things their new teacher brought to class. Draco had purposely chosen a desk right behind the She-Weasley in hopes of a better mark if he could gather what she was doing, but that wasn’t working out. </p><p>The Snake-Slayer, on the other hand, was great in what he was doing. Draco had no idea where he had learned all about the use of muggle technology, but he was top of the class by far. Too bad he couldn’t sit close to him, ever since that awful trial he couldn’t come close to the man. That was just too much. Potter in his trial, ok, he was kind of used to having his arse saved by Mr Perfect, but Longbottom? That was just too much. Had anyone looked at the guy in the last few months? TOO MUCH!</p><p>His thoughts were rudely interrupted by Professor Nott and hell, wasn’t he a whole different can of worms? After he had witnessed Professor Burbage’s early demise on the dinner table of his childhood home, Draco had known they’d get a new teacher. Surprisingly, Professor Carrow hadn’t met the new standards and had booked herself a life long stay on the island of Azkaban, right in the middle of the Northern Sea. He wished her a hell of a lot of thunderstorms, that witch had it coming, she was a class-A bitch.</p><p>Back to more pleasant thoughts – of sorts. Even though Draco had expected a new Muggles Study teacher, he hadn’t expected HIM. Lockhart was nothing compared to the man Headmistress McGonagall had introduced at the welcome feast. Professor Nott was about 75”, had a full beard that was trimmed at the sides, and dark curls long enough on top that they fell into his matching dark eyes with the body of a dragon wrangler. Draco still couldn’t say if he had eaten anything at the feast, and he was for sure not the only one. Suddenly, even the announced field trips into the muggle world had kind of appealed to him. </p><p>The shock about the name of his new teacher came later – he was sorry but he needed a bit till his brain would work properly again. More precisely, the connection hit him when Theodore Nott had a total meltdown in the Slytherin common room that night. Sure, they weren’t the closest of friends, but they couldn’t leave one of their own to lay in the fetal position on the ground. So, the 8th year Slytherin boys had carried him into their sleeping quarters and tried talking to him. It worked as Theo started to relax a bit but he fell asleep as soon as he did so, without explaining anything. </p><p>When they got up the next morning, he seemed to be back to normal and no one felt comfortable enough to ask him about the reasons for his breakdown. They all had to fight their personal ghosts after the war and the insight that you fought on the wrong side didn’t help at all. At least, that was Draco’s firm belief. Still, the rumour mill was working overtime and soon enough, all of Hogwarts had heard about the episode. But neither Theo nor Professor Nott commented on any of the resulting tales. </p><p>The only things everyone appeared to know after the first week, were that for one, Professor Nott was a Squib and had lived in the muggle world most of his life and two,  Theo and he were somehow related. Draco was shocked how much news that was to some. Let’s face it, ALL the purebloods were related, whether they wanted to acknowledge it or not – even the Malfoys, Weasleys and Longbottoms. And they didn’t even share a last name. </p><p>So, what was the issue really? The discussion of HOW they were related was of much more interest to Draco, but no one really knew anything about it. No wonder – if one was realistic. Considering how pureblood families tended to treat their Squib relatives, it was more of a surprise that Professor Nott had managed to live to teach them than that nobody seemed to know about him.</p><p>Theo and Professor Nott didn’t let on that anything could be amiss. Draco had tried to ask Theo if he was related to the professor – stupid word choice, he knew! Not really surprising that it had gotten him an ‘Aren’t we all?’ as answer. So, he wasn’t any the wiser, but even more curious. Still, his curiosity had to wait for the shocking reveal of the two new assistants Professor Nott had hired. He had claimed to need a bit of help for the field trips and asked some students with muggle experience to assist.</p><p>Why did he need to ask THEM? Draco was reasoning with fate here – or whoever else was listening. Not that it ever helped, but he couldn’t tell his father anymore, could he? He was right there in the island retreat with Professor Carrow and Draco most definitely didn’t want to tell him anything anymore, anyway. Hell wasn’t that a lot of any’s? </p><p>But honestly, hadn’t he been chastised enough by this point? No! It appeared he had to endure Miss I’ll-beat-you-on-every-test and Mr Perfect, not only as his fellow classmates, but as his teacher’s from now on. Sure, they were only assistants to Professor Nott but they were still his superiors and he’d probably even need their help on their first trip to this cinnamon thing. He was still not really sure what that even was. Something about projunctioning images, or was it projecting? Well, he’d find out for sure and besides, how bad could something called American Pie really be? At least he loved pie!</p>
