    <p>Mark had just finished recording and uploaded the video when he felt pain which caused him to fall to his knees as the pain continued through his body and his felt a hand on him. Looking up he saw it was Wade but he tried pushing his boyfriend away though he heart broke as he did that. He couldn't stand the pain much longer and fell down into the darkness.</p><p>He woke up on some dirt but he didn't know which seemed familiar but he couldn't figure out where but then he heard some groans and looked behind him. There was two men with bright red hair holding some sticks, a man with familiar blond hair, a man with familiar brown hair and a man with black hair. "Felix! Wade! Jack!", he called as he tried to wake them up shaking them and feeling relieved when they woke up. "Bloody hell. where are we?", said a voice making Mark turn to them but before he could speak to them Felix stepped in front of him. "who the fuck are you?", he asked in a snappish tone. "Fred and George Weasley. Now who are you?", they spoke in sync leaving Mark feeling amused so he stepped around Felix to explain. Felix, Jack these are my sons in law Fred and George. Fred and George these are Felix and Jack while you already know Wade", he introduced everyone even pointing to his friends as he named them. <strong>"Aw how nice. you are all getting along and a bit possessive Felix?"</strong>, came a voice cold and dark. Wade looked at Mark who shook his head silently saying no it is not Darkiplier. "What do you want?", demanded Jack quickly noticing Wade stepping in front of Mark who rolled his eyes but didn't say anything about it. "<strong>Oh my dear Jack I want to put Mark through some tests but unfortunately you and the others joined on accident"</strong>, said the voice in a mocking tone. Mark noticed the words so he spoke, "so we go through these tests and if we succeed then we can leave? can we still shift? can the twins still do whatever they can do?". There was silence before the voice answered, <strong>"yes you can and yes they can. If you go through all these tests of horror games as well as movies and escape then will you be free to leave but if you don't then you die"</strong>. The voice disappeared and Mark sighed before he started walking in a direction.</p>
