          <div class="userstuff"><p>The argument had started over dinner, just a few days into the Christmas holidays, just over a month since he turned sixteen. Sirius had had enough from the moment he’d walked in the door, wishing bitterly that he could have stayed at Hogwarts, but he would have been the only one in Gryffindor Tower and at least this way he’d be invited to the Christmas Eve party at James’s. </p><p>So he’d tried to stick mostly to his room, avoiding the rest of them, and when he did come across them he couldn’t help but deliberately antagonise them. </p><p>‘Take those revolting posters down,’ his father had said, pointing at the poster of a pouting, dark-haired woman lounging seductively on a beach, in tiny white bikini. ‘They’re abhorrent.’ </p><p>‘That’s no way to talk about my future wife,’ Sirius had said tauntingly. He had hoped this would make his father leave, but instead he was treated to a long, furiously spitting, rambling and barely coherent monologue on the disgusting degradation of society and the repulsiveness of mating with muggles. </p><p>‘I’m obviously not going to get to shag Gia Carangi!’ Sirius roared back at him. </p><p>He had even tried to take his meals upstairs, hoping to hide away in his room for the entire Christmas break if he could, but Kreacher was appalled and his mother was screeching up their stairs that it wasn’t dignified. </p><p>‘I have to study for my O.W.Ls,’ he lied. But as much as his mother hated him and didn’t understand him, she knew him well enough to know that he would not be bothering to study. </p><p>So instead he found himself sitting at the table, surrounded by the fine, intricately carved silver plates and goblets, being lectured that he hadn’t dressed for dinner. </p><p>‘What the bloody hell are you on about, I’m not sitting here naked, am I?’ he growled. </p><p>‘You’re in revolting get up,’ snarled his mother. ‘Filthy - there’s no respect for wizarding traditions now-’</p><p>He knew perfectly well what she meant. His parents and brother had changed into evening dress robes (Regulus’s actually had a stupid ruff type thing), as though dinner on a Wednesday evening with only your family was a formal occasion, and he was there in jeans and a t-shirt, and if he had thought to pick up his leather jacket on his way down he would have been wearing that too. It was all the disgusting, appalling, shocking muggle clothes he, James, Remus and Peter had bought over the years, spending summers and Easters and Christmases meeting up in Diagon Alley, giving whoever was meant to be keeping an eye on them the slip, and then heading into muggle London. </p><p>They would head to Camden market, or Leather Lane, or Brick Lane, and spend their time searching for clothes and posters to annoy Sirius’s parents with, or records that James could try and talk to Lily about, or try and chat up muggle girls, because they all agreed that would infuriate Sirius’s parents the most. Then in the evenings they would get chips, or go to a pub, or a few times even concerts at the Roundhouse in Camden. Every time Sirius came stumbling off the night bus or out of a taxi, he would ensure he came home with something else that would send them into a rage, because fuck them, muggle clothes were just better. </p><p>There was nothing particularly different about that dinner. The arguments and squabbling were much the same, the same prejudices and sneering remarks he had heard for so many years, Regulus’s smug little face still smirking out at him, chipping in ridiculous little comments like, ‘they’ve done studies, Sirius, muggles and muggleborns just aren’t as intelligent. You can’t argue with facts. They’ve done studies.’ </p><p>He wasn’t even sure what the turning point was. All he knew was that he couldn’t keep his temper, and neither could his mother, screeching and shrieking and howling at him, he swearing at them and saying he would rather be a muggle than like them, they saying that he should just go and live in some muggle hovel if that was the case, and all of a sudden, without really thinking about what he was doing, he was rising and saying, ‘fine. Fuck you then. Fine. I’m going. I’ve had enough.’ </p><p>Then he was taking long, angry strides out of the room and up the stairs, and his mother was running after him, her hands clawing out at him like the talons of a harpy, her throat raw with rage as she cursed him and told him what an ungrateful, foolish, pathetic brat he was. ‘You bring constant shame on this family!’ she spat at him. ‘Ever since you defied us-’</p><p>‘What, by getting into Gryffindor?’ he yelled back, seizing his rucksack. ‘I hate the whole bloody lot of you, pureblood maniacs-’</p><p>‘Blood traitor!’ she screamed at him. ‘Scum! You dare turn your back on hundreds of years of-’</p><p>‘Maybe some traditions should fucking die out!’ he shouted, and he could barely stand to be in there, he didn’t even bother with his trunk, or anything else, he just wanted to leave, he was pushing past her and heading back down the stairs, desperate to get away. </p><p>‘Generations of pure blood and you throw your lot in with half-breeds and mutants and blood traitors!’ </p><p>‘I hope this whole family fucking dies out with inbreeding!’ he fired back as she chased him. ‘You’re the disgusting ones, trying to set me up with Bellatrix -’</p><p>‘PURITY!’ she screeched - she was quite demented, trying to batter him, but at just sixteen he was too tall for her now, and he shrugged her off with ease. He stopped just as he got to the front door, her viciously hammering her fists on his back, and he looked back towards the dining room. Neither his brother nor his father had come out. </p><p>He set his jaw, and left. </p><p>‘Leave then!’ she howled after him. ‘Leave! Never dare return here again - I will never forgive you, you are an abomination!’ </p><p>He set off into the dusk, and he realised dully that it was snowing, though the slurry of wet snowflakes were not settling on the dirty and litter strewn road of Grimmauld Place. He walked away until his mother’s shouts became even more incomprehensible, and he heard the door slam, and vowed to himself that he would never step foot in there again. </p><p>His heart was hammering hard, his breath cold and shallow and rapid, and he realised as he reached the opposite corner of the square that he was shaking. He collapsed onto the bench of the bus stop there, his head in his hands, looking down at the cold, grey pavement. In the summer, weeds grew through the cracks, stubborn dandelions forcing themselves through concrete and tarmac, but here in the depths of winter the cracks were merely scars and blemishes. </p><p>He pulled his hands across his face, so that they were in a prayer like pose, breathing slowly into them as he closed his eyes and tried to calm himself. He would not go back there. He would rather live out here on the street, die of exposure. He would not even go back for his Hogwarts things, or clothes - nothing - all of that could be replaced, but he would never get back the satisfaction of knowing he never had to see them or the inside of that house again. </p><p>Even so, even though he was satisfied and this was what he wanted, a terror had taken hold of him. He had had the rug pulled out from under his feet, the very basics of security gone, suddenly alone in the world. </p><p>Except of course he was not. He knew exactly where he wanted to be.</p><p>Thankful that he had at least taken the time to pick up his rucksack, he opened it to find his wallet, still with a scant amount of muggle money from his most recent trip to Roman Road with James and Peter. He swore quietly as he realised there was no coat or even jumper in there - he had slung it over the end of his bed. Now that he was calming down, his skin was starting to prickle with the biting cold. </p><p>He still felt terrified, still felt sick, his head swimming with the momentous thing that he had done, knowing that he could never go back from it now, but he got up from the bench and checked the grubby and faded timetable on the bus stop pole. He could call the Knight Bus, he knew that. Throw out an arm and he would be there in twenty minutes at the most. But he was determined, despite the terrible cold and the feeling that he might throw up, to twist that knife in his mother’s cold, black, spiteful heart and do it the muggle way, the entire journey. In fact, he thought, taking his wand from his pocket and burying it deep in his rucksack, he would almost be tempted to leave the whole magical world behind entirely, just to really get at them, if it weren’t for the fact that he loved his friends and the red and gold of Gryffindor Tower and the excitement of a full moon so very much. </p><p>With numb, freezing fingers, he traced down the timetable and found the bus he needed, then sat back down and waited, staring dully at the untidy clumps of frosted, dead grass on the square. In the dying light, he could still just about see the shape of number 12, and he wondered if any of them were watching him out of the windows, peering out from behind the heavy velvet curtains, muttering and snarling and saying they were glad he was gone. </p><p>The snow swirled around him, and he folded his arms as he shivered violently, still too stubborn to go back even to get a coat or a jumper. He swore under his breath. He really liked that leather jacket. </p><p>Finally there was a gentle screeching, whining sort of noise, and he looked over, his skin cold like marble by now, to see the number 77 rolling towards him, the headlights catching the swirling snow. Sirius rose and shuffled towards it with his rucksack over one shoulder, his teeth chatter. </p><p>The bus driver looked at him with surprise. ‘You not got a coat, son?’ he asked. ‘It’s blummin’ freezing.’ </p><p>‘P-paddington station,’ Sirius shivered. ‘Single. Please.’</p><p>The bus driver looked highly concerned, so much so that Sirius was sure he heard him twisting in his seat to look as Sirius took his ticket and walked away. Some of the little old ladies clutching their net shopping bags looked at him too. He took the stairs to the upper deck to avoid their gaze.</p><p>The bus lurched as he reached a seat, and he fell clumsily into it, huddling against the window, though that was cold too, and it rattled unpleasantly against his head. In the sleet-ish snow, the lights of the traffic and houses and street lamps were softened, and his mixed feelings swirled in him like the wind outside. He knew he had somewhere at least for a few nights, and then perhaps he would have to return to Hogwarts, and if they let students stay over Christmas and Easter perhaps there was something in place for over the summer too. The groundskeeper, Hagrid, lived there full time, it wasn’t like the place would be entirely empty. </p><p>Besides, though he was only doing his O.W.Ls, some people left school after that year anyway, not bothering with N.E.W.Ts, and as he was one of the older students in the year, he would be of age in just one year anyway. Maybe Uncle Alphard could help him out - he couldn’t live with him, of course, he was in the old people’s home in Upper Flagley, and Sirius reckoned he wasn’t long for the world anyway, but he might be able to set him up a bit; get him sorted. </p><p>In the meantime, he thought, as the bus shuddered and jolted and splashed through the dark, cold streets, James would help him. He closed his eyes. He should have at least sent an owl ahead or something. But it didn’t matter - James would do it without question, even if he had to argue with his parents about it. </p><p>Eventually, after what felt like a very long time, when he was starting to feel travel sick and still bitterly cold, he hit the little button on the pole in front of him, and the bus stopped at Paddington station. </p><p>He muttered his thank you to the driver as he disembarked, and hurried into the station. It was early evening, so it was still throbbing with people on their way home from work or heading into London, perhaps for drinks or to see a show, and he nipped easily through the crowds. Most of them were bundled up in thick coats and scarves - he felt quite ridiculous in jeans and a t-shirt. </p><p>He looked up at the departures board, the long line of destinations and times and platform numbers, a huge crowd of people staring up at them. Every now and then, part of the board would flick to reveal a platform number, and dozens of people would scurry off at once, lacing through the rest of the crowd that continued to stand like statues. </p><p>There was no train station in Godric’s Hollow, but Bristol was vaguely in the right direction, so he stood there for at least twenty minutes, his feet aching and stiff with cold, staring up until finally the little number flicked over to say ‘PLT 7’. </p><p>He hurried towards it with the others, and was almost in sight when he realised with a lurch that despite all his standing around he had stupidly forgotten to buy a ticket. He pelted to the ticket office, glancing uneasily between the departures board and his watch, and panicked that he didn’t have enough muggle money, because last time they’d been out int he muggle world he had stupidly bought Remus a record he could tell he wanted, not to mention a couple of packs of cigarettes with James. </p><p>But thankfully, he just about had enough (though he was left with nothing more than an oddly shaped fifty pence coin and a handful of coppers), and he raced back clutching the ticket in his clammy hand, his rucksack bouncing uncomfortably on his back as he practically shoved people out of the way - he could hear the whistles going, he was going to miss it, they were starting to swing the doors shut-</p><p>He leapt onto the train, and pulled the door closed behind him, panting heavily. He could see that it was packed in the carriages, but he was not sure he would have acted any differently even if there had been seats. He simply slid down the wall onto the rumbling floor of the vestibule as the train shook and pulled out of the station, stretching his legs inconveniently across the floor. He was very tired. His eyelids drooped and he entered a confused, half-awake state, aware of the dings of the intercoms and the voice of the conductor announcing the next stops, feeling the unsteady sway and rattle of the train, but also thinking painfully of his mother, and how she had once loved him, and cared for him, even if it was obvious that she liked Regulus more. They were half dreams, half memories, of her holding him, reading to him, telling him that he was important, and special, and better than others, before the memory-face of her contorted into spitting and snarling, serpent like, insisting that he would be in Slytherin and demanding to know why he couldn’t just fit in. </p><p>The word Bristol jolted him out of it, though he still felt heavy with sleep, and for a moment he panicked and thought he had missed his stop before realising the train guard was announcing that the train terminated here. It was very late now. </p><p>At Bristol station he changed, got the last train out heading towards Wells, that stopped at all the odd little villages. He was almost the only one on it - just a few drunken old men cackling loudly down at the other end. He didn’t have enough for another ticket, so he pretended to be asleep when he heard the guard shout ‘tickets please!’, and perhaps he looked so pathetic there, without a coat in early December, at night, in the snow, that the train guard walked past him without attempting to wake him. </p><p>He got off at a little town he thought he’d heard James mention once, hoping desperately it was somewhere near Godric’s Hollow. It was pitch black - there were street lights here but for some reason they weren’t on, and it was so cold that it was painful. He huddled against the snow, and thought, finally to call the Knight Bus, but as he delved into his bag he realised that the only wizarding money he had was a few knuts. James would probably cover the fare for him at the other end, but it felt humiliating, and Sirius was a stubborn, pig-headed teenage boy, so he miserably resigned himself to continuing his achingly slow journey. </p><p>He didn’t know anything about this town, or where he was, and he was embarrassed at the childish terror that swept over him, his strange urge to howl for his mother, or any adult really, to tell him what to do. He checked the bus stop outside the station, and Godric’s Hollow was on there, and to his relief it looked like it would take ten minutes at the most, but the next bust wasn’t until half past six in the morning. The thought of sleeping in the bus stop or in the station went as quickly as it came - the snow was falling more thickly here, there was no heaving city of London to warm the air with car exhausts and tall buildings to block the bitter wind, no thrum of people giving away warmth. The town was eerily quiet, because it was the sort of place where all the pubs were closed already and there was no need for anyone to be out here. </p><p>So he wandered around, squinting at road signs and mile markers, and eventually he was making his way in what he was sure, or perhaps just desperately hoped, was Godric’s Hollow. The darkness and snow surrounded him, to the point that he could no longer feel it, sure, now, that in his foolish rashness and desperation to run to James he would probably end up losing himself in the darkness and succumbing to the cold entirely, and the most embarrassing part was that he knew that everyone would just say, ‘why didn’t he get the Knight Bus?’ and really, he thought, the only one who would understand why he wouldn’t would be James, and he would probably be infuriated with him for it. </p><p>But finally he was staring down at a little white stone that seemed to glow in the darkness, frosted with snow but the dark arrows still visible over it. Godric’s Hollow, 2 ½ miles. It pointed down a deserted lane. </p><p>Nearly there. One step in front of the other. Within reach now. They wouldn’t turn him away. Surely. James wouldn’t let them. </p><p>It became familiar now; he could hear the babbling rush of the stream that flowed through the village, that last summer he and James had sailed an inflatable child’s paddling pool down, and he was passing buildings with that chocolate-box old world charm, though they seemed almost spooky in just the moonlight. He wondered how Remus was doing - he usually started to feel ill around this sort of time. </p><p>Finally he was in the village square - he knew the route from here, quite easily, and it was entirely surreal that he had made it. He almost wanted to break into a run, all the way down Forge Lane, but he was so cold and so exhausted and so hungry that he thought it was a bloody miracle he was standing at all. At times the snow was so thick that he was wading through it; it soaked through his jeans. </p><p>When he reached James’s house, he practically fell through the gate, bracing himself against the low dry stone wall so that he didn’t simply collapse onto the cracked flagstone path. The lights in the house were all off, all was still and quiet which was not like the Potter house he knew at all, but it was no wonder - it was the early hours of the morning now, snow was falling thick and fast, everyone would be sleeping soundly. </p><p>He braced himself against the house, and, with what little strength he had left, thumped his fist repeatedly on the door. He closed his eyes, screwing up his face, pleading and hoping and praying that they would hear, that they would open it, that they would let him in even just for a little bit. He thumped again. ‘Hello?’ he called, his voice cracked and hoarse. ‘Please.’ </p><p>A light turned on, Sirius saw it even through his eyelids, and he straightened up, took a hesitant step back, looking longingly at the red door, willing it to open. </p><p>It did not open, but he heard Mr Potter’s voice - harsher and deeper and more serious than he had ever heard it before. ‘Who’s there? What do you want? Identify yourself.’ </p><p>‘It’s me, Mr Potter,’ said Sirius, and to his humiliation he realised his voice was wobbling pathetically. ‘It’s Sirius Black. I… please, Sir. I need help.’ </p><p>‘Sirius?’ he called, noticeably confused. Sirius heard the latch on the door being pulled, but it did not open. ‘How do I know it’s you?’ </p><p>‘I… I don’t know, Mr Potter, but, please, it is…’ He was so cold. ‘Please, Sir…’</p><p>The door opened, and light fell onto Sirius, trembling and shivering and shin-deep in the snow.</p><p>‘Good God, boy,’ said Mr Potter hurriedly, his face in utter shock. He lunged forward and seized Sirius, pulling him inside roughly. The sudden heat of the house hit Sirius painfully. </p><p>‘Monty?’ came a fearful voice. Sirius looked up, and there was Mrs Potter, at the top of the stairs, her wand raised, blinking down at him. ‘Sirius?’ </p><p>Sirius was shivering too much to answer. Mr Potter was ushering him into the living room, pointing his wand at the grate. A fire burst there, and crackled merrily as Sirius was forced down into an armchair, and he found himself being wrapped in a blanket. Now that he was here, now that he was warming up, it was almost as though he wasn’t really aware of his surroundings. He sat in a slight daze, trembling violently, his head spinning. Mrs Potter was suddenly in his vision, clutching his face and peering into his eyes, speaking to someone else and frowning slightly, but he had no idea what she was saying. </p><p>Another blanket was being thrown around him, he felt it’s heavy weight on his shoulders, and now someone was pressing a warm mug into his hands too. ‘I’m sorry,’ he spluttered. ‘I… I didn’t know where else to…’ </p><p>‘It’s all right,’ Mrs Potter was saying soothingly, rubbing his back. ‘It’s all right, sweetheart.’ </p><p>‘Sirius?’ A new voice - a gentle, hesitant one, but the one he’d wanted to hear all evening. He looked up - James was approaching, dropping down to kneel beside his mother in front of Sirius’s armchair. ‘What happened?’ </p><p>Sirius swallowed, still trembling. ‘I had to leave,’ he said at last. ‘I couldn’t stay.’ He looked back at Mrs Potter. ‘Please can I stay here?’ he asked, his hoarse voice barely more than a whisper. ‘Please?’ </p><p>‘It’s not even a question!’ she exclaimed. ‘Of course you must - Monty, get the camp bed, we’ll set it up in the study-’</p><p>‘He can stay in with me,’ said James. ‘Put it in my room.’ He looked around. ‘Where’s all your stuff?’ </p><p>‘Left it,’ said Sirius gruffly. He felt stupid now, foolish - he could have at least waited to the next day, not just run off without a though, without any consideration. ‘I haven’t got anything.’ </p><p>‘Good grief, you poor boy, you’re going to have to borrow some of James’s clothes,’ said Mr Potter. ‘We’ll sort you out, don’t you worry. I’ll go and find that bed - is there any room on your floor to put it up, James? I couldn’t see the carpet earlier.’ </p><p>‘Oh, all those clothes are dirty, just kick ‘em aside-’</p><p>‘Or put them in the laundry basket,’ said Mrs Potter reproachfully. But as she did so, she was perching on the arm of the chair, one arm still around Sirius’s shoulders and the other brushing through his wet hair soothingly, pulling his head close to her. He closed his eyes. His shivering was starting to slow - the blood was starting to warm in his body with a painful prickle.</p><p>‘How did you get here?’ James asked. Sirius told him. ‘You idiot,’ said James. ‘You could have got the Knight Bus. Did you put yourself through all that just to annoy your mum?’ </p><p>Sirius nodded. ‘Stupid,’ he muttered. </p><p>‘Yeah, it bloody well was!’ exclaimed James. ‘Merlin’s beard, we could have just posted her some dragon dung or something if you wanted to piss her off!’ </p><p>‘Oh, James,’ said Mrs Potter heavily. ‘Shush! Of course you’re going to stay here, Sirius. Drink your tea, we need to get you warmed up.’ </p><p>And so it was that Sirius found himself, fifteen minutes later changing into some of James’s pyjamas, looking down at the camp bed Mr Potter had set up with him, with a squashy looking sleeping bag and ready with a hot water bottle. </p><p>‘It’s your lucky day,’ said James. ‘I actually have an unused toothbrush from a multi pack, so we don’t have to exchange mouth germs.’ </p><p>‘Best news I’ve heard all week,’ muttered Sirius, taking the toothbrush James was offering him. He went quietly into the hall, just in time to see Mr Potter slipping back into his bedroom, unaware that James was on the landing.</p><p>‘You always wanted another one,’ he heard Mr Potter say teasingly to Mrs Potter. She shushed him scoldingly. </p><p>‘Poor boy. I’ll write to Dumbledore in the morning, let him know he’s safe. We should let someone know at least, he seems like the right person.’ </p><p>‘What if he makes him go back? Or Mrs Black shows up looking for him?’ </p><p>‘I’ll tell that old bat exactly what I think of her if she turns up on my doorstep,’ said Mrs Potter sharply, and he heard Mr Potter laugh.</p><p>‘I mean it though - what are we going to do if his family come looking for him?’ </p><p>‘Get him to hide in the attic and say we haven’t seen him,’ said Mrs Potter flippantly. ‘He must be what, fifteen, sixteen? Hardly counts as kidnap anymore.’ </p><p>‘That’ll stand up in court,’ said Mr Potter, with the sort of strained voice that made Sirius think he was stretching. ‘Poor lad. You’re right though - we’ll make sure he-’ he seemed to interrupt himself with a yawn, ‘-make sure he stays here. No one can send him back, not if he doesn’t want to.’</p><p>Sirius went quietly into the bathroom, brushed his teeth, and looked at his pale face in the mirror. People had sometimes asked he and James if they were brothers, undoubtedly because they both had dark hair but he also thought, sometimes, he’d picked up something of James’s accent, started to subconsciously mimic his expressions and intonations. He wished he had been a Potter, rather than a Black, that he and James might really have been brothers. Perhaps he still would have been the least favourite of two boys, but somehow he thought Mrs Potter would be better at hiding it, and he might have had years of warmth rather than the cold, spitefulness he had been dragged up in. It sounded like they might let him stay, even if others tried to tell them that he couldn’t. He felt happy about this, but for some reason it made his dark eyes shine. </p><p>He wiped at them impatiently, took a breath to compose himself, and went silently back to James’s room. </p><p>James was still awake, apparently waiting for him, his glasses off which Sirius usually teased him about because he looked so squinty without them. Sirius got into bed, and looked over at him. James couldn’t have possibly seen his expression, but grinned broadly. ‘Well, this is fun,’ he whispered. </p><p>‘I’ve stayed here before,’ Sirius whispered. </p><p>‘Yeah, but that’s it, now, you live here. Dad’ll probably go out and buy you a proper bed if you want.’ He considered. ‘I reckon you should still stay in here with me, though.’ </p><p>‘Why?’</p><p>James shrugged. ‘What we’re used to, isn’t it?’ </p><p>‘I suppose it is,’ said Sirius, thinking of the cosiness of their dormitory, and the red and gold hangings.</p><p>‘What happened?’ James asked. </p><p>‘The usual. I just couldn’t take it anymore.’ He thought very hard. ‘I can’t even remember what was said, to be honest. We were just screaming at each other. Just… you know,’ he took a great, sighing breath. ‘Just telling me what a disgrace I am, how disappointing, how worthless, how I’m not as good as golden boy Reg…’ </p><p>James winced and shook his head. ‘I don’t understand how she could do that to her own son. I’m sorry, mate.’ </p><p>Sirius closed his eyes and shook his head too. ‘Doesn’t matter. I’m never going back. Never. Not even,’ he added, with utter misery, ‘to get my poster of Gia Carangi.’</p><p>‘You didn’t think to pick that up?’ James hissed. ‘Fuck, Padfoot.’ </p><p>Sirius laughed silently, his eyes still closed. ‘Biggest fucking tragedy of the evening.’ </p><p>They both sniggered in the darkness together, and eventually, in an unusually serious voice, James spoke again. ‘I’m glad you came here. It’ll be better now.’ </p><p>Sirius nodded, though of course in the pitch black James wouldn’t be able to see. James was quite right - he knew it as surely as he knew he would never return to Grimmauld Place.</p></div>
