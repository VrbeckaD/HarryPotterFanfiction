    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p align="left">I roll my eyes at the head of shocking black hair across the platform. Its messiness and atrocious styling can only be one thing. Or rather, one person. Potter. Potter with his stupid little friends. My stomach suddenly clenches, painfully, but I ignore it and focus on the distasteful boy again. He’s laughing his head off at some obnoxious, inside joke that only his friends would understand. <em> Potter looks quite pleased with himself, like he actually </em> did <em> something during the war. </em>He may have killed Voldemort, but he didn’t do any of his “quest” without help. He just took the credit for everything everyone else has done. Yet here he is, seemingly oblivious to the strangers around him, living his life like nothing’s changed. I sigh inwardly, cringing that his life is still perfect, utterly unaffected by the war.</p>
<p>Potter still lives with that awful group of lowly Weasley’s, he has brand new robes and equipment just like every year, and his life is still splattered across all the magazines and papers. Whereas for me, not a thing has stayed the same. My father is in Azkaban for his crimes, and my mother is destined to spend the rest of her sad life locked up in St Mungos, battling a whole range of weird things. I am the only one living at Malfoy Manor, not that I spend much time there as it is. I can’t stand the deafening silence of the rooms, how it drowns you in your own loneliness. The ever present cold that drifts in from the walls chills me to the bones, giving me a gnawing feeling of abandonment.</p>
<p>Someone shouts my name and pulls me out of my embarrassingly deep trance. It’s Pansy, calling me onto the train. It must’ve pulled in to the station while I was inside my own head, occupying my own thoughts. I sigh and board the train, walking down the long aisle to the carriage of her choosing. She, of course, chose the one at the very end of the corridor so no one could hear our conversation. As I open the heavy sliding door and step inside, I sweep my eyes over the carriages near ours. Content with I see, I sit down and face Pansy. I can feel her staring at me, but I don’t pay it much attention. Instead, I force her out of it.</p>
<p>“So Pansy, how are you?” The basic inquiry rolls off my tongue, and I’m pleased that I still sound put together. <em> At least I appear normal. </em></p>
<p>“Oh come on Draco,” she tisks at me. “You know that I’m absolutely fine. The real question is, how are you faring?”</p>
<p>I roll my eyes before answering her question. “I’m quite bored, honestly.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant…”</p>
<p>“Oh, shough off Pansy. I don’t want to talk about that,” I state, before leaping into a conversation about Quidditch. She gets the message, and happily takes up the small talk. Eventually, I zone out, and her light conversation fades to background noise.</p>
<p>I stare blankly into the corridor, tuning everything out until I’m draped in silence, like a cape. I’m slowly drowning, burying myself deep into the heavy folds of all my hidden insecurities and doubts. My mind reels under the water-like pressure, and I feel my lungs wanting to burst. My body willing my mind to give out. But my brain doesn’t succumb. I rip myself out of the illusion. Just enough to break the spiral down, and start floating to the surface again. No one else understands what I’m thinking or feeling, I hide my emotions too well. Too easily. Pansy was the one person I might’ve trusted after last year, yet I can’t help but to push her away. Can’t help but to seclude myself, and be wary of everyone, and everything, around me. Pansy hasn’t done anything wrong to me, but that doesn’t stop me feeling a strong sting of betrayal. I feel myself starting to go under again, and forcefully pull myself to the surface. The room around me feels like it’s going to explode with my pent up emotion and tension. I glance at Pansy sitting opposite me, at her peaceful face with her head resting softly against the window. <em> She must’ve fallen asleep. </em></p>
<p>I gather my surroundings again, noticing that all the carriages around me are totally full, and listening as laughter flutters to my ears. I look out the window, and see that we are far from the station. The platform must be kilometres behind us, out of view across the rolling hills. The train speeds along the lush grass, the constant sound of the tracks beneath somewhat comforting. I watch as we go over a rickety bridge, and stare at the river we are crossing above. I gaze at the ripples gliding over the surface, the supposedly bottomless dark blue, and the watery reflection of the Hogwarts Express. And then we are back to green hills and flowers of many colours littering the ground.</p>
<p>I jerk around from the enrapturing window as I hear a faint knock on the carriage door. The trolley-lady stands at the door, her old face cocked to one side and splitting into a polite smile. Suddenly gripped with childish excitement, I get up and ask for two of the chocolate frogs, hand over the money, and sit back down. I open one of the frogs immediately, and grab ahold of it so it doesn’t jump out of reach. The last thing I’d want is for it to jump out the window, like I know Potter’s did in first year. Quickly clearing my mind of the abomination of humanity and wizard-kind, I bite the head of my squirming frog off. I impatiently pull the card out of the wrapper and roll my eyes at the now-familiar figure of Andros the Invincible. Since I have been collecting these cards since I was eleven, I have about fifty of Andros. I shove the second, unopened chocolate into my pocket, remembering that I’ll need to change into my robes pretty soon if I want to avoid the long lines. I look across at Pansy once again and mutter an apology to her sleeping form as I retrieve my robes from my bag, and stalk out of the carriage and into the bathroom which is next to our carriage.</p>
<p>When I duck back in, I gently shake Pansy awake and tell her to get dressed. She thanks me and walks to the bathroom. I sit back down in my seat and, instead of looking out the window, I glance out into the corridor again. I take note of who’s sitting close to me, and if it’s worth trying to eavesdrop into any conversations. That’s when I see him. I scratch the back of my head and sharpen my ears. Potter’s saying something about changes that the eighth grade will have to deal with this year. <em> Obviously he’s not saying anything interesting. </em>I scold myself. As I turn back into my carriage to stare out the window again, I see him turn in my direction. He raises one eyebrow on his tan face and laughs. We are sitting facing each other and two carriages down on opposites sides of the aisle. I have no way to get out of his field of view, and I decide to sneer at Potter instead. His face goes sharp and then Granger pokes her head out of their carriage to see what he’s looking at. When she sees me she shakes her head and darts back inside. I go back to gazing out the window, not letting anything expose my cold exterior.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><em> Hogwarts is in worse shape than I thought it would be. </em>The castle is practically in ruins.The Astronomy Tower is in crumbled heaps, the Quidditch Pitch, while no longer burnt to a crisp, hasn’t been repaired beyond the cleanup. Spirals of cracks run up and down stone walls, making the centuries old building look dangerously close to collapsing. I know better, of course. I can feel the magic that’s been used to make sure the castle stays upright. That doesn’t stop me from pointing out the chances of it toppling over to Pansy and all the younger students. I smirk and then go silent as Professor McGonagall glowers at me. Although I foolishly imagined that the castle would be the same as before the war, I keep that thought silent. I don’t want to give away my surprise to anyone. Because that would mean I’m no longer in the loop, which I’m not. Since my father is locked up, I know as little as everyone else does.</p>
<p>I’m startled when the younger grades are instructed to walk into the Great Hall and sit at their designated tables, leaving the remaining of the eighth graders clustered outside. The year group is drastically smaller than it was last year. A lot of the students have been withdrawn due to the Battle, parents not willing to send their children back. Others have been pulled out due to Death Eater parents, wisely thinking that their kids won’t be safe inside the castle. Slytherin is rather small because of this, and I don’t know how my house is going to win anything with our small numbers.</p>
<p>I tune into what McGonagall is saying, and listen attentively. Because I overheard Potter on the train, it’s clear that there will be some dramatic changes for us. <em> There isn’t supposed to be an eighth grade at all, so that puts my cohort in a word position. </em>I contemplate the possible changes, before giving up and listening to McGonagall’s speech.</p>
<p>“As you can clearly see, the number of pupils in Eighth Grade are rather diminished. This is mainly caused by the war, and parents fearing for their children’s safety. I assure you that there are charms threaded throughout the entire castle, ensuring that you are safer than ever before,” the Headmistress drones on. I’m not interested in the slightest about this, and stop listening for a second. I scan over the heads of my peers and note who’s here and who isn’t. Most of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor are the same, with about a third of Hufflepuff missing. <em> Too scared to come back. </em>And then there’s Slytherin.</p>
<p>“Now that that’s out of the way, I would like to address the things that will be different for you this year.” My head whips up at this, and suddenly I’m paying attention again.</p>
<p>“The committee of teachers and myself have decided that we don’t want you to interfere with the runnings of the rest of the school, meaning that things may be a little strange. As you know, in seventh grade there are the Prefects, Head Girl, and Head Boy, as well as the Quidditch team Captains. The students receiving these roles are obviously younger than you, putting you in a rather odd position. Due to this, the committee has decided that we will give four of you a chance of leadership called House Representatives. There will be one per house, and they will have leadership over eighth year, along with the leaders of seventh grade. The rest of you must listen to all authority, but only House Representatives can take house points. We have had this same conversation with the leadership of seventh year,” McGonagall finishes.</p>
<p><em> Well this is interesting. </em> I muse to myself. <em> More leadership positions… </em> My brain goes whirling with the candidates for Slytherin Representative. First, Pansy. She’s responsible, yet she isn’t particularly great at anything. She is fairly average when it comes to grades. Secondly I think of Theodore Nott. He is exceptional at quidditch, and fairly good with classes. However, given his history of detentions, he seems unlikely. My mind continues much the same throughout the whole house. I have no idea who the professors might’ve chosen. I exhale silently and focus in on what is being said again.</p>
<p>
  <em>~~~~~~~~</em>
</p>
<p>Once we eat and leave for our dormitories, I remember that our <em> entire grade </em> shares a common room now. I am absolutely bewildered by this ridiculous decision. Do they really believe that <em> Hufflepuffs </em> will survive sharing a common room and dormitories with <em> Slytherins? </em> Taking note of the passageways and shortcuts to get to the common room faster, I realise where the dorms are situated.</p>
<p>“I can live with this,” I remark in my head. The common room sits right around the corner to the secret passage into HoneyDukes, and then into Hogsmeade. My face cracks into a cunning smile as I think of the easy access to the town, and all the opportunities to sneak out of the castle. I hum to myself again, and step through the entrance, which is a newly-made stone archway. I turn to look for the portrait to enter the password, but instead of a painting I see a suit of armour. It’s visor is up, and a lever is located inside, currently pulled down due to the constant stream of people entering and leaving.</p>
<p>“Sneaky,” I mutter under my breath.</p>
<p>Once inside the common room, I’m rather underwhelmed. I don’t know what I expected, but it definitely wasn’t this.</p>
<p>Since, obviously, there is more than just one House in this room, the colours are shockingly neutral. Walls are covered in canvas white paint, and is decorated with light wooden tables, floor boards, and cabinets. Paintings are on every wall, all of them showing rolling fields or beaches at various stages of the day. Pale purple and blue sofas are spread throughout the diamond-shaped room. Fireplaces are already roaring, with people reading in the armchairs across from them.</p>
<p>“It’s actually rather clever of the committee, decorating the room with neutral colours save for the blue. No one would fight the Ravenclaws over a sofa, unlike any of the other houses.” I mutter to myself underneath my breath. I hate the feeling I get when <em> someone else </em> has done a good job at something.</p>
<p>I finish gazing around and walk up the left staircase to where the boys’ dorms are. I twist the door knob and tentatively push the door open. My mouth falls open before I even realise that it’s happened. The room’s stunning. Dark wooden floors, black leather couches, bookshelves that are bursting, and shades of green everywhere. It’s just what I imagined and was hoping for. I hastily close my mouth, making sure no one sees my surprise. Thankfully, there is no one else in here yet. There are only a handful of beds, all of which are made with green covers and drapings, and more importantly, all unoccupied. I prance over to the bed beneath the window and throw myself onto the mattress. I hurriedly sit up again, nervous that someone could’ve walked in and seen me like that. I gaze through the window and see that it looks over the lake. I smile to myself, glad that at least <em> something </em>is similar to the Slytherin Commons.</p>
<p>I jolt as someone pushes the door open and paces inside. He is facing back into the stairwell, softly conversing with someone else. When he turns back around I’m shocked to see that it’s Potter standing in the archway.</p>
<p>“What are <em> you </em>doing here,” I spit towards him.</p>
<p>“Going to my dormitory,” he calmly replies, not rising to my bait.</p>
<p>“Well, as you can <em> clearly </em>see, this is Slytherin’s dorms,” I try, dripping my voice with sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Well, as it has <em> clearly </em>escaped your notice,” Potter mimics me, “there is a door opposite this one leading to the other houses’ dorms.” He laughs at me and crosses the room, opening a second door. He looks back at me with a glint in his eyes, and then he’s gone. Through the door into another dormitory. I sigh to myself as someone else steps into Slytherin dorms. It’s Weasley. Of course it is. I roll my eyes at his hopeless face and incline my head to the other door. Weasley smiles at me, thanking me. And then he realises that it’s me, and his face scrunches up. He races through the second door and towards Potter, getting as far away from me as possible.</p>
<p>“Well, that was weird,” my brain supplies. I ignore the sharp pain in my stomach and search for my bags. Desperately trying not to think about the fact that Potter didn’t try to argue, and that Weasley remained absolutely silent. I return to the task at hand. I find my bags stacked in a corner of the room a few minutes later, and carry them over to the bed I’ve claimed. I unpack the contents, carefully folding and hanging my robes and clothes. I then unload the textbooks and other equipment I’ve brought and stack them under my bed and into my trunk. I then take out my few personal items. I put my toiletry bag on the bedside table, along with a couple of my favourite books. As I finish unpacking, the dorm door creaks open again. A couple of the other Slytherin boys step into the room and go about claiming beds and talking. Instead of joining them, I get up and leave.</p>
<p>I’m no longer the Slytherin Prince, not since my father foolishly chose me over the Dark Lord. I don’t know what came over him, we all could have been slaughtered. <em> But we weren’t… </em>The thoughts consume me as I glide down the stairs and out of the Common Room.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>It’s been four days since we arrived at the castle, and we are about to head off to our first classes for the semester. At least, that’s what we were supposed to be doing. Instead, McGonagall calls all of the school into the Dining Hall. We walk in and settle at our respective tables. She stands up at the front, and starts speaking.</p>
<p>“As you are all well aware by now, this year is quite unusual for us at Hogwarts. We have an Eighth Year for the first time. This means that we have to slightly adjust things to make this year work smoothly. In order to do this, the School Administration has decided to create a new leadership role within Eighth Year. These roles will be called ‘House Representatives’ and there will be one for each House. Now, I know I’ve already been over this, but <em> some of you </em>weren’t paying attention. Don’t worry, I’m not going to bore you all with this speech again. Instead, I’m now going to reveal who these four people will be.”</p>
<p>Whispers shoot around the hall, everyone conspiring and holding their breath. All of us are wondering who will be selected.</p>
<p>“The House Representative for Ravenclaw is… Anthony Goldstein!” A round of applause echoes throughout the hall. He stands up from his table and quickly makes his way to the head table. McGonagall clears her throat, commanding silence.</p>
<p>“For House Gryffindor, the Representative is… Harry Potter!” No one is surprised, and you can tell through the unenthusiastic clapping. He too, stands up and walks to the front of the room. My eyes linger on him, taking in how happy he is, regardless of the lack of surprise. <em> Stupid, oblivious Gryffindors. </em></p>
<p>“Hufflepuff’s Representative is… Susan Bones!” This, however, takes a lot of people by surprise. Including me. I would’ve thought the title belonged to Hannah Abott, who is much more well-rounded. Before I can think this over, the headmistress is speaking again.</p>
<p>“The final House Representative, for Slytherin, is… Draco Malfoy!”</p>
<p>My head spins in the dead silence of the Dining Hall. People are staring at me, and I don’t know how to react. I was the last person I expected to get this title. I shakily stand up, and walk confidently to the head table. I can hear the crowd muttering to each other, wondering how in hell this came to be. I don’t blame them. And then I’m standing there, in front of everyone, feeling hundreds of glares resting on me.</p>
<p>“If I could invite the Heads of House to pin the badges onto these Representatives, I would love that.” The teachers stand up and walk over to us, each holding a shiny, black brooch. Professor Slughorn happily approaches me, pinning the badge onto my robes. He nods at me and then stands at my back. I feel eyes on me, and I turn to my right. Potter is staring at me, confusion etched onto his face. I sneer at him, and he hurriedly turns back to the audience. McGonagall finishes her speech about our roles in the school, and the rules we have to follow and enforce on the others. She then closes the assembly, and sends us off to our classes.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>My first class for the year happens to be Defence Against the Dark Arts, and I make my way quickly down the Serpentine Corridor. When I arrive at Classroom 3C, I push the door open and step inside. Talking halts, and heads twist to look at the newcomer. They take me in, and then turn back to whoever they were talking to. The room fills with chatter again, and I find a desk near the back. I pull the chair out and place my parchment and books onto the table. Sitting down, I think about what just unfolded. K slipped silently into a room, people noticed, went silent, and went back to normal. No glaring, insults, or, anything else. <em> That’s rather strange… </em>A hiss startles me out of my mind and I glance around to my left. Potter has his shockingly green eyes on me, and smirks.</p>
<p>“You’re definitely going to fail this class if you keep doing that.” I can hear the amusement in his voice, waiting for me to reply.</p>
<p>“You don’t know the half of it!” I snap, and fix him with a glare.</p>
<p>“Yeah right.”</p>
<p>“Oh, fuck you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t do charity work.” His eyes glisten as he says that, alive with mischief. I scowl at him and turn to face the front. <em> Charity work… </em></p>
<p>I push Potter to the back of my conscious just as the new Professor walks in. It’s a woman with red hair braided over her shoulder and pale skin. Her face is young, but her hands give her away as being in her late fifties at least.</p>
<p>“Good morning class. My name is Professor Falco, and I will be taking you for Defence Against the Dark Arts this year.” She looks at us down her crooked nose, observing our reactions to her. Seemingly pleased, she cracks a smile and starts the lesson.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Towards the end of class, Professor Falco announces that we will have an assignment due at the end of the term. The class predictably groans, and she stands at the front of the room with a gleam in her eye. Like she knows something we don’t. <em> Oh no. </em></p>
<p>“Now, this assignment requires you to work in pairs. You are to complete this research activity, and then create a short play demonstrating whatever defence you’ve studied.” She pauses, glancing around the room in anticipation.</p>
<p>“And no. You can not choose your partner.” The class once again complains, and the professor stands there, unshaken. Falco goes on to tell us about the assignment, and how to complete it in the best way possible. While she speaks, she hands out pieces of parchment that say everything she is explaining. Then, she starts reading off the pairs she’s made.</p>
<p>“Susan Bones and Eloise Midgen. Dean Thomas and Wayne Hopkins.” The pairs are extremely random, and each one takes the class by surprise. The pairs stand up and move next to each other at the back of the room. I swallow hard, wondering who I’m going to be paired with.</p>
<p>“Kevin Wentwhistle and Tracey Davis. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.” The room fills with a mix between laughter and shock. <em> Of course… </em>I turn my bitter gaze towards the idiot, and see him gently shaking his head. We both go to stand at the same time, and the room becomes silent. We walk towards the wall closest to us, and stand awkwardly. Professor Falco draws the attention back to her, and continues reading out pairs.</p>
<p>“Seamus Finnigan and Ernie McMillan…”</p>
<p>A nudge on my upper arm drags my attention to Potter. My stomach twists sharply and I pull a face.</p>
<p>“If you really hate me that much, go ask to be changed,” Potter drawls at me, annoyance dripping off his voice.</p>
<p>“No. It’s not that,” I say, clarifying. “Mind you, a new partner might be nice.” I can’t help but tack on a sarcastic note.</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>“Enough boys. If you two can’t get along then I’ll just make you do more things together until you can!” Falco’s voice cuts through our quick fight, leaving me staring exasperatedly at her and Potter.</p>
<p>
  <em> Oh boy. This is going to be a long term. </em>
</p>
