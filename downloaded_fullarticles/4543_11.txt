<p>In this magical world, you'll see many possibilities without any limitations. Nothing is impossible when magic is involved. Well, looking at it on the bright side, it is indeed exceeding expectations. You will go beyond the comprehension of those people who does not have the talent. You might even think that you can do everything and only few will be able to acquire it. You may even think that you are unstoppable, invincible. There will be other ways for you to accomplish something but with it, task will be done in no time while challenges are pieces of cake. You will surely have no problem with regards with every other thing because almost all are solved by magic. It is a beautiful thing. It is a talent. It can also be a gift to some. Yes, indeed, magic is a beautiful thing. Yeah, everybody thinks so, well, except a certain someone.</p>
<p>He is a boy, on the age of 10. A little boy - some might say - and a lonely boy. He is quiet and silent, not most of the time but all the time. He breathes - tried to talk - nobody listens - sits down - forgotten – always alone - and left behind. He is an orphan ever since he was born. He is the last in line from their clan. The only relatives he had have finally abandoned him. He tried to smile, yet only managed the wince to surface his face. Pitied? Is he? Nope, no one did care. His name is Tetsuya Kuroko. He struggles and manages to breakthrough his studies. Did he succeed? Oh yes, he did. He is only five years of age at that time. Remarkable for a kid at that age to be able to do so, don't you think so? Sadly, nobody took notice of it. He is unnoticeable at school too, you see. He is - more often than not – forgotten by the students, even the teachers do. Only one took notice though. It turns out to be his cousin, from his mother's side and he and his cousin's mother and father are the only relatives, other than his uncle and aunt from his father's side, he have left. His cousin is the next in line to his mother's, like his father's, almost, wiped out clan.</p>
<p>His cousin's name is Seijuro Akashi. His relatives' clan – Akashi - are rich, and highly respected in the whole country and they don't want the little boy to be discovered by anyone even if they are kind enough to take the boy in. Every day, the boy will be locked in a huge, secret room, connected to the basement. His aunt and uncle are kind to give him meals three times a day but he is not allowed to get out the room. He has his own bed, five bookshelves filled with books, a chess board, a lampshade and digital clock, both on top of the bedside table, on the right side of his bed. His room is composed of the bed, a door - on the left side of his bed – which leads to the bathroom, dark blue carpet on the floor, ceiling white, and wall a light blue. The room doesn't seem to have a door or a way out. This has been his sleeping quarters since living with the Akashi's. He is often visited by his cousin, Seijuro. They had been the best of friends. But one evening of tragedy put their friendship on hold and the start of his almost, never ending agony with the Akashi's.</p>
<p>His eyes shot open. He turns his head to the right to see that it is 6 o' clock and a small January 30 at the bottom. He made his way to the bathroom to freshen himself. He can now go out the room now, all right, but of course, the actions he can do are eat and clean like the other maids the Akashi's have in the manor. Most of the time, he will be the one responsible for the cooking of the meals. He is contended with this. He and Seijuro are still friends. Seijuro Akashi is a red haired male. Both he and Seijuro are ten years of age. He is a few inches shorter than the red haired. As he made his way out the bathroom and outside to the kitchen, he and Seijuro's paths crossed.</p>
<p>"Good Morning, Tetsuya. How are you feeling?" Seijuro asked with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Tetusya smiled back, "I feel great this morning, Akashi-kun. Good Morning."</p>
<p>Seijuro dropped his smile and frowned, "Tetsuya, how many times do I have to tell you? Call me Seijuro."</p>
<p>"I can't do that, Akashi-kun. Aunt and Uncle might hear…"</p>
<p>"They wouldn't. Call me Seijuro when there are only two of us, didn't I tell you that?"</p>
<p>"Okay, Seijuro-kun. You should wait by the table, I will cook your breakfast."</p>
<p>Seijuro nodded with a satisfied smile and sat on a chair nearest to the head chair. The light blue haired male is cooking when stomps from upstairs and shouts became more and more understandable as the Akashi couple began making their way down the stairs. Their quarrelling in the morning brought a frown on Seijuro's face. This is not the frown he gives his cousin but a frown that says he hates something.</p>
<p>"Mira, how many times do I have to tell you that I am doing nothing there but business trip!" shouted a booming voice, followed by fast footsteps that are going to the direction of the kitchen.</p>
<p>"I can't believe it, Seitaku! How dare you make up that meeting without me; and with the Buenaventura's?! Are you out of your mind?! They are Filipinos which aren't even half-blood. Tell me then, what's the whole point?! You just want to probably see Samantha, right?" a female voice, this time, shouted.</p>
<p>Both the couple reached the kitchen to see Seijuro, frowning at both of them. Seeing their son, both Seitaku and Mira Akashi shot each other a glare before sitting on the chair; Seitaku beside Seijuro and Mira, across Seijuro. Tetsuya and some of the servants entered the dining room to serve the meals, Tetsuya himself, made. The breakfast is fairly quiet. The couple glaring throughout the breakfast while Seijuro is frowning while shaking his head from side to side as he eat. When the couple finished, they stood up and walked in silence before shouting at each other again by the living room. Seijuro sighs and gave Tetsuya and apologetic look before smiling softly at him.</p>
<p>"Tetsuya, come eat with me."</p>
<p>"I will, Seijuro-kun. I shall sit beside you." At this a smile like-no-other appeared on both the teens' face.</p>
<p>After the breakfast, Seijuro prepared himself for school while Tetsuya stayed back to his room, quietly reading. Seijuro shouted his good bye to Tetsuya before riding one of the Akashi's limousine. He never learned how to read and write outside the very room he is in. With what he hears, though, outside, along with his desire to learn; he help himself to read. To write, he used his fingers and tried to imitate the letters he sees in all the books. He learned a lot since learning how to read and write. For him, reading is never boring. The day passed by with Tetsuya re-reading the book he got from the first shelf. He is about to fell asleep when incoherent yells coming from the other side of the door. He sharpened his hearing at the noises he began hearing for a while longer, before backing away in fear. He hadn't expect this to happening now, no, especially not now. He made a run going to the bathroom, locking it behind him as he entered. In almost the same, exact moment, the door burst open.</p>
<p>"Oh no, you don't!"</p>
<p>The boy, with his ears against the door, began slipping onto the door until he felt himself sitting on the wet floor. Persistent knocking - or banging - never reach his ears. His eyes glazed and he is shaking uncontrollably. His mind flashed with images and visions of what happened in the past. With his arms around his legs, hugging himself tightly; his eyes finally closed, being welcomed by the darkness and the noises, muffled.</p>
<p>HPxKNB</p>
<p>Light blue eyes opened, his vision blurry. He helped himself on his feet. His whole body hurt from sleeping on the, not only cold, but wet, floor of the bathroom. He listened for voices at the other side of the door. Hearing none, he made his way out slowly. It was dark, unblemished and quiet, almost as if he had left it a long time ago, yet being well-taken care of. He lay down on his bed. His eyes, looking at the room once again to see something unusual, found himself staring to something near the door. He sat down at the bed, trying his best to decipher what it is. He stood up and walked closely. With the little light from outside the room, made him see a, what it seemed like three cylinder of different sizes layered together. He picked it up and walked back to open his lampshade. Looking at the clock for some reason, he found out that there is only 5 seconds left for midnight. When he count down from 5 and the clock chimed midnight, he saw a message written on top of the thing he saw. He found a fork beside it with the message of:</p>
<p>'Happy birthday, Tetsuya. Hope you have more birthdays to come!' –From Seijuro</p>
<p>A note beneath the fork didn't slip the notice of the light-blue haired male. He uncovered it and another message in Seijuro's neat handwriting. It says that the cylinder is not a thing, but rather, a food. It also says that nobody will be in the house the whole day on Tetsuya's birthday – Seijuro was sorry for that he writes – and warns him about trying to go out the house on his own is not allowed. Tetsuya smiled at his cousin's effort but frowned at the last part of the note. So nobody is at the manor now, not even his Aunt Mira, who always stays at home. According to his common sense, only the maids, butlers and the security are the only ones left with him. He sighs and got the fork to try the new learned food in front of him. The sugary thing on top melts on his mouth that delighted his taste buds. He smiled and continued eating. He decided to follow his cousin's advice to stay inside the manor. He can't risk anything after all, he is grateful about the not-so-fair, but still kindness, of the Akashi couple.</p>
<p>He finished his cake then, he drinks water. Afterwards he finally greeted himself a happy birthday. He got shocked though when something break his door down. A huge man appeared before him that made his eyes go wide. The man didn't look so happy and on his right hand is what appears like red umbrella.</p>
<p>"Can't believe we are also accepting foreigners. Ello, you are – err – Te-tatsu-"</p>
<p>"Tetsuya Kuroko and who might you be?"</p>
<p>The man clapped his hands and smiled at him, "Rubeus Hagrid. Now, come along. We have to get out of here. It's going to be a long ride!"</p>
<p>Tetsuya shook his head, "No! I mean – where are we going? I can't leave."</p>
<p>"You haven't received your letter? I see… why do students this days have their letters always blocked? No matter. You can read that on our way. Come now, if we leave now, we can catch up to your first class. "</p>
<p>"But Hagrid-kun - err – sir. What do you mean by first class? I have never been to a school before."</p>
<p>"Seriously? Lots of work to do then. Let's get out of here. I can help you with the basics. Geez, you are just like Harry when I first saw him. So thin, looking almost fragile," Hagrid said.</p>
<p>He began carrying the smaller boy who is struggling from his hold. Tetsuya shouts for help but for some reason, nobody can hear his voice, no matter how loud. Hagrid is grinning the whole time. Tetsuya finally stopped struggling when he knew it's of no use. His eyes twinkled at the sight of outside. It has been years since he'd seen the outside of the so called room he was in. He was never allowed out his room for almost 5 years and has only just recently gained some of his freedom when he was allowed out the room but only in the manor. They stopped by a motorcycle. They hopped on. Hagrid put a helmet on Tetsuya's head and after putting his over his head, he starts the engine and they traveled up. Tetsuya hold onto Hagrid for dear life but couldn't help to look down to see the city lights. He is appreciating the view when suddenly, the view became a blur as they are gaining speed. Fast, they gained and quick, they stopped as well. Being dizzy, he didn't realize that they stopped and they are indeed, in front of the school. When he regained his clear eyesight, a view of a castle stared back at him. He was at awed for a moment he did not notice Hagrid standing beside him.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Pretty neat eh? Yeah this is your school. Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."</p>
