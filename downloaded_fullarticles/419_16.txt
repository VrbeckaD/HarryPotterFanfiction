</p><p dir="ltr">James finally picked up his phone as it chimed for the third time that morning. <b>Don't forget to bring the lactose-free milk and sugar,</b> he rolled his eyes, slipping the phone back into his pocket. It chimed again, <b>'oh and a pack of licorice, gummy bears and two packs of spicy ramen noodle soup.</b><br/> <u>Fine</u>, James quickly typed back, <u>'now leave me alone. The more you ask for things, the longer I'll be gone. </u><br/> Another chime, <b>'oh and I would like a box of glazed donuts, please'</b><br/> <u>I'm serious....stop</u><br/> <b>Can I ask for one more thing though?</b><br/> Rolling his eyes again, James typed a reluctant <u>yes</u><br/> A few seconds later his husband's final request chimed into his phone. <b>I would like pretzels and cream cheese, pickles, and a carton of cookies and cream ice cream and rocky road ice cream. </b><br/> <u>Fine.</u> He typed back hitting send. <u>I'll be home in an hour.</u><br/> <b>K love you. And thanks.</b><br/> <u>I love you too baby.</u><br/> James tucked his phone into his back pocket as he entered the large grocery store. He made a mental note to stop at Gigi's and pick up the glazed donuts Severus had asked for.<br/> He wheeled the cart down the candy isle stopping once his eyes landed on the licorice snack. He threw three packs of the candy in the cart and a bar of milk chocolate, and three packs of gummy bears before rounding the corner. He shifts the cart to the left placing it out of the way before he headed down the international isle and grabbed six ramen noodle boxes. He knew his husband, two of anything never satisfied him. James returned to his cart throwing the box of soups in. His phone chimed, exhailing deeply, he reached in his back pocket taking his phone out, it was from Lily <em>'He must be asleep, where is the spare key?'</em> It wasn't even noon yet and he was already sick of the people he would be going home too. Grocery shopping was his time to get his head straight and process what he would do for the rest of the day, but with all the people texting him and asking for requests, James could feel the tension return to his shoulders and back.<br/> <u>It's taped to the bottom of the purple flower pot. Please don't wake him, if he is alseep.</u><br/> <em>I won't. Where r u?</em><br/> <u>Out buying food 4 the week. Need anything?</u><br/> <em>No.</em><br/> <u>Be back in a bit.</u><br/> James went back to his shopping, turning down the frozen food isle. He grabbed the requested ice cream rolling his eyes as he made his way back towards the pickles.<br/> "Excuse me sir,"<br/> "Yes, are you finding everything OK sir,"<br/> James chuckles, shaking his head, "I'm looking for the cream cheese,"<br/> "Oh yes of course, it's down in Isle four." James thanked the man and made his way towards the direction of the cream cheese.<br/> Once everything was done and paid for, James excited the store and made his way to his car. Five minutes later the engine started and he pulled out of the parking lot making his way towards home. He made a left turning into the parking lot of Donut World before turning off the car and heading inside.<br/> "Good morning, how can I help you sir?"<br/> James looked up from his phone, "yeah sorry, one minute please." He sent a quick group text excluding his boyfriend/husbands name from the list. A few seconds later the request for donuts came through. "Hi, so sorry about that. I would like a box of twelve glazed donuts with the donut creme on the side." The server girl shakes her head nodding as James continued his order. "And I would like two triple fudge coca donuts without the nuts. A double red velvet glazed donut, make that three."<br/> "The donut cream doesn't come on the side for the red velvet."<br/> "Um yeah that's fine," James says checking his phone again. "I would like two nutty bar, a cream cheese donut, an apple fritter and four plain chocolate ones."<br/> "Is that all sir?" She asked again hoping this time he was actually finished. She touched the keypad to the cash register ringing up his order, "$46.84,"<br/> James hands her his credit card thanking his lucky starts that he had decided on bringing his wallet instead of just cash. Now a days when he went anywhere, he always tried to bring a credit card or two because he found out on their tenth date that his current boyfriend had expensive taste and for a medium build guy, he ate like a hotdog eating champion. And he somehow never moved up or down on the scale. "Here you are sir, have a nice day."<br/> "Thank you and you too!" He puts a $10 tip in the jar walking out to his car and carefully placing the order in the back seat.<br/> <br/> <br/> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">By the time he arrived home, it was ten o'clock and Remus, Siri and Lily were already at the house, their cars blocking his entrance into the garage. He parked across the street getting the groceries first because he had totally forgotten about the ice cream and the coffee creamer.<br/> "Need help?"<br/> James shrugs, "if you'd like, there are two more bags in the trunk. Is he still sleeping?"<br/> "No, the shower turned on about five minutes ago." Said Lily pushing her feet into her shoes and walking out of the house.<br/> James walked into their bedroom gently shutting the door behind him. He turns the lock knowing that Remus and Sirius weren't really the knocking type and seeing as his husband had been feeling self-conscious about himself lately, it was a bad idea.<br/> "Hey,"<br/> "Hi," said the older man, "shut the door please, I don't want the cold air entering the bathroom."<br/> James shuts the door and sits down on the closed toilet lid watching as his boyfriend/husband washes his hair. "Your licorice is on the bed" James finally speaks startling the older man a little bit. His husband turns to face him body glistening with soap and James has to force himself to stay seated on the toilet lid<br/> "Did you get the ice cream too?" the silky voice asked and James nods.<br/> "Yes I did, I put it in the freezer out in the garage until you are ready to have some. I also got you the glazed donuts and instead of regular milk, I got rice milk."<br/> "Jay?" James sighs, his husband is typically not a whiney person, but if he doesnt get what he wants, he'll find any means and tell you.<br/> The younger man(James) was really not moved by the whining, but he also knew that his older partner is his weak spot and so he promises to go back to the store and get regular milk later.<br/> "I know, but I also know that you have a sensitive tummy and now that you are passed the whole morning sickness stage,and you are going on five months, I know how bad you get heartburn." and even though he's said he'd go back, he knows that Severus is going to feel bad and cave and he does.<br/> "Fine," he said again, "thank you."<br/> "You almost done or can I join you?"<br/> "I'm almost done just have to wash my face. Can you make me a sandwich please?"<br/> James nods, "What kind of sandwich?"<br/> Severus does his best concentrating face before he speaks, "Peanut butter and ham. With pickles and salt chips."<br/> "You got it baby," said James getting up and kissing him on the lips. "I'll get some ice cream too."<br/> "Oh and tell Lily that I know she was the one that deleted the movie I recorded and that I know she downloaded porn as a joke."<br/> James laughed, he knew that they wouldn't be able to pull the wool over his husband's eyes, but he wasnt surprised that Severus found out. He was smart after all and things like that didnt escape his mind that easily. "Actually she and Remus were both in on it." James added.<br/> "Great," said Snape, "and tell them they aren't allowed to watch shit on our TV anymore if they're just going to download porn on it. They can take their twisted corrupted minds elsewhere."<br/> James smiles, shutting the glass door before walking out.</p><p> </p><p></p><div align="center">

</div><p dir="ltr"><br/> "So how's he doing?" it was Lily who spoke.<br/> "He's good, but I'm going to make him a sandwich and he's probably going to watch TV and take another nap. I'm going to try and see if he'll play a game or two with us."<br/> "Arthur is stopping by to hang out and chat." She said again. Lily has been his best friend since before they could walk or even talk. Lily was the type of person who just saw the good in everyone, but dont piss her off. She's sweet right down to the bone, but James learned the hard way that if you fuck with her, she'll show you a side of her no one has ever seen. except maybe the devil, but she always meant well.<br/> Even though James had moved away the summer of fifth grade they somehow never lost touch and when eight grade rolled around, James parents had moved right back into their old house claiming they needed to be closer to family. Which wasnt entirely wrong, that was the year James granddad died and his grandmama came to live with them.</p><p dir="ltr">"...and Remus and Sirius?" Asked Lily</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know, Sirius is still mad at me that Severus and I refuse to name our child after him, but I think it has more to do with Remus seeing one of the teachers at Hogwarts." They all graduated from the University of Hogwarts back in two thousand and fourteen, James with a Masters in Fine arts, a Masters in Criminal Justice and Law enforcement and a Minor in Art History. Lily had gone into law and was currently practicing as a Criminal defense attorney because everyone deserves someone who'll fight for them. Her words. Remus has a degree in Historical sciences and a minor in Art Therapy and a Associates in Mathematical science. And as for Sirius, he dropped out of college four weeks into it and decided he'd rather start his own business. And he did. He's the best auto engineer in the country. He's so good that other people travels from out of town just to come see him. And he's his own boss so that makes everything ten times better. And Severus, well he's done it all. All before the age of twenty. He was a child prodigy and has an IQ that is higher than most. He's got so many degrees it's hard for any of us to keep track. He did graduated Magna Cum Laude for his Major in Statistical Mathematics and sciences as his first major and then went on to do Biology and Chemistry with a minor in Social Sience. And after he had done all that he went back to school and graduated Summa Cum Laude in English and Art History with a minor in Communications.</p><p dir="ltr">"Why doesn't he just tell Remus that he fancies him?" Asked Lily, James looked up from where he was standing in the kitchen, he had zoned out again. He tried to listen intently, but once Lily got started, there was no stopping her. "It would sure save him the heart ache and maybe even make him a nicer person."She added.</p><p dir="ltr">James laughed, "Sirius Black a nice person? Where?" Said James jokingly, "Sev wanted me to tell you, that he knows it was you who recorded the porn on the tv and that you deleted the movie he downloaded to watch."<br/> "Was he mad?"<br/> "No, and I told him Remus was in on it too."<br/> "Jay?" She had moved to the island and was now watching him make Snape's sandwich.<br/> "What? You know how he gets."<br/> She shook her head because she did know. Snape wasn't uptight or anything, but he did hate people being in his personal space. "Doesn't mean you have to encourage him." She finally said, she grabbed a chocolate donut and stuffed it in her mouth.<br/> "True, but I like to. Keeps me on my toes."<br/> "Sadist," said Lily, "what is that god awful smell?"<br/> James doesn't say anything, he contines making the sandwich ignoring the conversation the girl was having with him.<br/> As he made Snapes sandwich his mind went back to the first time he had actually noticed Snape. Even though Snape had been a guest teacher at the Uni since he was sixteen, being the youngest person in over two decades to be given the opportunity to start his teaching career early. James was sixteen and Snape was twenty-five, he'd never taken an interest in the brilliantly smart man until Severus taught his class for the fourth time that year. To say he was impressed that they let someone so young teach a bunch of horny teenagers was definitely an understatement.<br/> And Snape didn't really talk to anyone. And James learned later on that his now husband wasn't that great at reading socialques. James smiles remembering the first time he had gotten the courage to walk over to the young man to talk and say hi. He had been so proud of himself, even though Snape didn't care to know his name or make friends.<br/> Some how his feet had found their way over to the quite man's table. He plops himself down looking at the older man, but his attention didn't come up from his book. He didn't really consider himself as an out going person, but ever since their professor let Snape teach a class, he couldn't stop thinking about the older man. "Hi <em>I'm</em><em> James, but </em><em>I'm</em><em> sure you already know that, </em><em>it's</em><em> really nice to meet you...</em><em>I</em><em> mean </em><em>we've</em><em> met before...not like really met, but you taught a class at the Uni last year--any ways </em><em>I</em> <em>just</em><em> wanted to say hi and </em><em>I</em><em> think </em><em>you're</em><em> a great teacher."</em><br/> <em>"</em><em>Shouldn't</em> <em>you be on your way to class Mr. Potter?"</em> That was all that Snape said before getting up from the table and walking away. James had smiled feeling the happiest he had in a while. His teacher knew his name.<br/> He draws himself from his thoughts as a firm chest presses up against his back and he can feel the slightly over grown baby belly along his spine.<br/> "Hey baby,"<br/> "Hi Jamie" said Snape, James smiles he loved it when Severus called him that. "My sandwich ready?"<br/> "Yup just about." James says turning around and planting a kiss on his boyfriends/husbands lips. Their heads shot up as Remus and Siri exit from the guest bedroom<br/> "If you had sex in our house please tell me it was no where on the bed or the dresser. That's the baby's room."<br/> Sirius gave his usual deadpan look and went to sit down by Lily. "We didn't do anything James."<br/> "So what were the two of you doing in the same room then?" Lily asked her attention going to Sirius, "if it wasn't sex what was it?"<br/> "I dont care to know," said James, handing the plate over to Severus. "here you go baby, your sandwich.<br/> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">By two-thirty Arthur, Lucius and Peter arrived along with their friend Jamal. Severus hated Jamal and couldn't stand being around him because to Snape the young man was too arrogant. James could see what he meant, but he had said nothing.<br/> Jamal was Scandinavia and built like a brick house and if you asked James that was one of the reasons why Snape wasn't comfortable around him. And he had a reason to be intimidated, Jamal was huge and could probably snap a neck in half without giving it a second thought.<br/> James welcomed them in and shut the door, "make yourself at home. Can I get you beer or anything to drink?"<br/> "I'll have a pint," Jamal's deep voice rang through. Severus had woken up and James could tell he was a bit disoriented. "Severus come help me in the kitchen." And his husband didn't hesitate, he was up and in the kitchen in a matter of seconds."Relax,"James said quietly.<br/> "There's a lot of people here," the older man whispered back.<br/> "I know and I'm sorry. You can sit in the bedroom for a while if it'd make you feel better." He kissed Snape's forehead. Severus didn't like big group outings, he was always socially awkward and never knew how to act. He was getting better in situations like these but it took time and most days he never came out of his room. "You don't have to though. And I'm not pressuring you to do that if that's something you don't want to do."<br/> He feels Snape shrug against him and that's all the answer he needs. His husband wasn't going to stay and that was fine.<br/> "Where are the keys?" Snape finally asked.<br/> "In the hall, but I'll get them. You can take my car, its across the street." Said James, "Tell your mom and dad I said hello."<br/> "I will," James kissed him and walked away only returning a moment later. "I love you."<br/> James gives him chaste kiss and whispers I love you too. Snape leaves the house and he watches from the doorway as his husband drives off.</p>
