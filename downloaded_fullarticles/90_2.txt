    <p>Molly flitted round the house with urgency as her eldest boys stood in the kitchen, arms crossed over their chests as they watched their mum move about the house, her wand waving as she cleaned and organized the Burrow.</p><p>“Why the fuss, mum?” Ron's voice filtered from the living area where he had set a tray of sweets down, grumbling with complaint.</p><p>“Would it kill either of you to cut your hair?” Molly fussed over Bill's small pony that was secured at the back of his neck, before tsking over his earring.</p><p>“Mum, what is going on?” Charlie shared a look with his elder brother, green eyes meeting green eyes.</p><p>“I told you,” Molly wiped her thumb across Charlie's cheek, “we have special company.”</p><p>She would never really tell her sons that she was meddling in their lives. She wouldn't tell her sons that their father had run into an old classmate.</p><p>She wouldn't tell Bill and Charlie that one of their old schoolmates, the pretty ravenclaw who stole their hearts, was back after a year in France.</p><p>“Bill, would you be so kind as to bring in wood from the shed?” Molly tapped his cheek before turning to Charlie.</p><p>“Go wash up dear, you have dirt on your face.” With her eldest sons gone in separate directions, she continued on her path toward the front of the burrow.</p><p>As she stood in front of the window in the living room, she placed her hands on her hips as she watched the golden grass sway in the gentle breeze.</p><p>Molly would never call herself a meddler when it came to her children's lives, but when it came to this, when it came to Bill and Charlie, molly couldn't help it.</p><p>She couldn't let the witch who had stolen both of her eldest sons’ hearts walk away again. She wouldn't let this chance slip by them.</p><p>“This is for your own good.”</p>
