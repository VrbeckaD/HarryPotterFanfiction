    <p>It had originally started as a tradition between the three of them. It was November 4th in first year and Hermione was explaining the concept if Bonfire Night to Ron.</p><p>"Harry, you were Muggle raised, help me explain please?"</p><p>Harry glanced up from his book at Hermione.</p><p>"I've never actually seen fireworks, my uncle never let me outside."</p><p>Hermione looked horrified,</p><p>"That settles it. Tomorrow, we'll go and find somewhere to have our own little celebration."</p><p>Hermione nodded her head with a sense of finality, leaving no room for either boy to argue.</p><p>The next evening, Hermione led Harry and Ron to a secluded spot she had found,</p><p>"Right, since we don't have any actual fireworks, we'll have to use the coloured sparks spell. I spoke to a Ravenclaw prefect and to get different colours all you have to do is think of the colour you want while you cast the spell."</p><p>Hermione looked at the other two expectantly.</p><p>"What about a fire? I thought there was a fire involved?"</p><p>Ron looked at Hermione, his arms wrapped around himself as he shivered slightly.</p><p>"Oh yes! Thank you, Ronald."</p><p>Hermione conjured a blue flame in her hand and passed it to Harry, before doing the same for Ron and herself. It would keep them warm without burning them. Giving Harry an excited smile, Hermione pointed her wand into the sky, muttering a spell. Harry and Ron watched in awe as a bright red ball of light shot into the air before splintering into sparks.</p><p>"That's a firework?"</p><p>Harry looked expectantly at Hermione</p><p>"Not exactly. Fireworks are a lot louder. Come on, I'll teach you the spell and you can make them any colour you like."</p><p>Harry nodded excitedly, he couldn't wait. Even Ron looked excited. The three shot sparks into the air, experimenting with different colours until a Hufflepuff came wandering over, a fourth year if Harry had to guess,</p><p>"What are you all doing?"</p><p>Harry stopped what he was doing to look at the rather tall boy,</p><p>"It's bonfire night, so we're celebrating."</p><p>Harry assumed that the boy was a Muggleborn, or a halfblood, as he seemed to know what bonfire night was,</p><p>"Do you mind if I bring a few friends next year? We can get some real fireworks as well."</p><p>Harry looked at Ron and Hermione, who nodded encouragingly,</p><p>"That would be fun. You can tell other people as well, but maybe not any Slytherins, unless they can be trusted."</p><p>The Hufflepuff boy nodded,</p><p>"Okay, I'm Cedric, by the way, Cedric Diggory."</p><p>"I'm Harry, nice to meet you."</p><p>As Cedric walked away, Harry turned back to his friends and after informing them it was nearly curfew, he led the way back to the common room, still clutching his little handful of flames.</p>
