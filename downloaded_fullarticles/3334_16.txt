    <p>Ron had never felt so cold. Sure, he’d felt physical cold, but never had he been the recipient of such icy glares and cool regard by someone he cared about.</p>
<p>Currently, he was the unlucky recipient of such an expression from his boyfriend, his sister and the woman he considered his best friend and pseudo-sister. Slowly, his heart was breaking under their harsh words and glacial sneers.</p>
<p>“…I guess you never cared for me, then,” Ron said quietly, allowing his head to drop and his gaze to move to his feet. He no longer tried to keep the tears from falling, instead letting the saltwater slide down his cheeks.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Harry snorted. “You’re a pathetic little coward.”</p>
<p>Before now, before this moment, Ron would have raged and attacked anyone who dared call him that. Now, he just let the tears roll faster.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe we’re related,” Ginny scoffed, and Ron flinched slightly. Hermione’s sharp eyes didn’t miss it, and Ron could hear the glee in her voice as she used her intelligence to break him down further.</p>
<p>“Should have been drowned at birth, or just forgotten completely. You’re nothing, you’re worthless, and I can’t believe we let you think we were your friends for this long.”</p>
<p>“Enough,” Harry ordered, and Ron’s hopes lifted slightly. “Time to get rid of him for good.” Ron’s hope fled entirely, replaced with a rage as dangerous and cowing as his mother’s. He straightened his shoulders, lifted his head, and glared with damp electric-blue eyes at the people he would have died for.</p>
<p>“No need,” he snarled, his mother’s warrior fey blood showing true for the first time. “I’ll take myself away.” He pushed himself up onto his feet, disregarding the many gashes on his leanly muscled body which bled freely at the movement, and felt a sense of bitter satisfaction as the trio before him took a step back. He turned his back on them, and strode through the Veil as confidently as possible.</p>
<p>He blacked out upon hitting the silvery, ghostly material, and never looked back at the ones who had betrayed him and broken his heart so thoroughly.</p>
