  <strong>Story begins now</strong>
</p>
<p>I ignored the side glances as I entered the Leaky Cauldron and walked straight up to the bar tender. "How do I get to Diagon Alley?"</p>
<p>"I'll show you." A strict, feminine voice volunteered. I turned to my left to see a tall older witch with a few wrinkles, clothed in green robes, and wearing a matching green hat with a long-spotted feather. She led the way, cutting through the crowd and exiting though the back door. When we reached an old faded brick wall, she tapped a few of the old individual bricks and the crumbly bricks as old as the wheel reassembled to form a passage to a crowded, rambunctious, colorful, oddly shaped place.</p>
<p>"Wow." I breathed in amazement.</p>
<p>"Go on. It won't remain open forever." The tall witch ushered me. In an instant my composure was back in place and I was weaving though the crowded street. I hesitated at the window to the owlery, but I had no need for an owl so I continued on. I stopped at Ollivanders: makers of fine wands since 382 B.C.(E.) but there was a line all the way out the door so I continued on to the book store to collect my textbooks and then the other required materials before returning to Ollivanders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I entered just an excited black haired girl and another woman, most likely her mother, exited.</p>
<p>"Hmm," the white haired man thought for a moment before it seemed whatever it was he was pondering clicked. "Miss Travers, here for your wand?" Though it didn't seem like he required an answer I nodded slightly.</p>
<p>He quickly grabbed a few wand boxes and placed them on the counter between us. "Take one and give it a wave."</p>
<p>One-nothing. Two-fire. Three-rain. Four-lightning. Five-feathers. Six-broken vase. Seven-darkness. Eight-blizzard. Etc.</p>
<p>"Well aren't you a difficult one to place? How many have we tried?" He more mumbled the latter part.<br/> "One hundred thirty-two." He looked surprised when I answered, but then he quickly exited the room before returning with a pitch-black case. Inside, laid on a purple cushion, was a white wand with a few lines in it that appeared to be cracks at first glance, but at closer inspection, reflected different colors of the rainbow. It was <em>beautiful</em>. </p>
<p>"Go on. Pick it up." Ollivander prompted when I did nothing with it.</p>
<p>I lifted the wand and give my one hundred and thirty third wave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Warmth enveloped me. My bare feet on wet rock. Wind howled. Waves crashed. Fire consumed. Fierce, protective, dangerous.</p>
<p>"I would like this one please."</p>
<p>"Aspen wood with dragon heartstrings core, eleven inches."</p>
