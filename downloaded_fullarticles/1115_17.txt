    <p>Harry’s palms are sweaty. Everything he needs is in front of him, and he stands there, tense and anxious and waiting for the signal. He’s ready. He might be taking this entire thing far too seriously, but looking around, he doesn’t think he is the only one. Most of his fellow contestants seem poised to give their absolute best.</p>
<p>“Ready!” Ron bellows.</p>
<p>“Set!” shrieks Pansy Parkinson.</p>
<p>“Bake!” they chorus, and everyone under the white canopy springs into action – that is, everyone but Luna, who calmly floats over to Padma, just to touch her shoulder and wish her good luck. Harry makes a wild grab for his ingredients and gets started separating eggs, knowing he needs to get his ginger spice sponge into the oven as fast as possible, so he can focus on perfecting his maple cream filling. He likes to think his flavor combination is a good compromise between simple and complex, and the ideal way to start the competition when he doesn’t yet know what the judges are looking for.</p>
<p>“Macmillan,” he hears Parkinson’s voice somewhere toward the front of the tent, magically amplified for the benefit of the many spectators, including those listening on the wireless. “Tell us about the sort of swiss roll you’re making today!”</p>
<p>“Oh, this is going to be my take on a Bramble cocktail, you see” Ernie says. From the corner of his eye, Harry can see him waving his arms around in illustration. “I’m doing a lemon sponge, and the filling will be blackberry with a healthy dose of gin.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you worried that the alcohol will overtake the other flavors?” Parkinson has clearly done her homework, because Harry knows that three weeks ago, she had never even <em>seen</em> anyone bake a cake before, and now she sounds as though she knows what she’s talking about.</p>
<p>“Not at all, not at all,” Ernie says cheerily. “In my opinion, a healthy amount of gin will put anyone in a much more benevolent mood.”</p>
<p>“Interesting,” Parkinson says, sounding skeptical.</p>
<p>While he’s whipping his egg whites and sugar into shape with energetic wand movements, Harry thinks that he’s lucky he has learned to tune out Hermione’s constant nervous muttering before tests over the years, because she is working at the station behind his, and she’s doing it now. Instead of History of Magic facts, she’s reciting the steps to creating her tiramisu swiss roll at lightning speed. She’s clearly nervous. The entire thing is her brainchild, after all.</p>
<p>She’d been approached by Blaise Zabini, of all people. He’d been looking for a spectacular idea for a Muggle Studies project, something that would help reintegrate Slytherin with the rest of them, and that could show the world they weren’t bad people at their core. Harry didn’t know the details of what they had planned at first, but the entire thing had evolved into a spectacle of epic proportions. If Harry had to guess, it was because after the traumatic war they’d been through, the entire wizarding world was dying for some light, harmless entertainment. He isn’t about to complain. The contest marks the first time in a long time he’s been able to make himself care about something.</p>
<p>“So, um. Goyle.” It’s Ron’s turn to interview a contestant. “What are you making?”</p>
<p>“Roll,” Goyle grunts, who seems to have forgotten he has a wand available, because he is busy whisking his egg whites into submission by hand. It’s quite the intimidating sight.</p>
<p>“Right, but what kind of roll?”</p>
<p>“Swiss.”</p>
<p>“Flavors, Greg, we want to know the flavors!” Parkinson butts in.</p>
<p>“Pumpkin cheesecake coconut and sprinkles.”</p>
<p>Harry stops, considers that flavor combination, and briefly wonders whether Goyle just decided to pack all his favorite flavors into his creation at once.</p>
<p>“Sprinkles,” Ron says, sounding mystified.</p>
<p>“Crunchy sugar things Muggles put in their cakes,” Goyle says, and holds out the plastic container someone must have procured for him. “I think they’re pretty.”</p>
<p>Someone taps Harry’s shoulder, jerking his attention away. “Can I borrow your wand?” Luna asks, serene smile on her face.</p>
<p>Harry looks at her, baffled. “Did you forget your own?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, not at all. But I am worried that the unicorn hair core is going to react badly with the flavorings. The basil, especially. Unicorns aren’t very fond of it, after all, and if my spellwork is off, I won’t get the balance just right.”</p>
<p>Harry hands over his wand without question, realizing only after she holds it in her hands that she’s the one of very few people for whom he’d do this without hesitating even a moment.  </p>
<p>“Lovegood and Potter seem to have decided on a cooperative strategy,” Parkinson comments just as Harry starts folding the rest of his batter in with the egg whites. This part is best done by hand anyway, his wandwork just isn’t delicate enough to avoid knocking out the air he’s whipped into the eggs.</p>
<p>Time seems to fly. Harry works as though possessed, slams his sponge into the oven and gets started on his filling. He is hasty, fumbles a bowl, and it falls to the ground as he curses.</p>
<p>“No cause for alarm, dear audience,” says Ron. “It’s just our favorite Dark Lord vanquisher throwing pots and pans at everyone.”</p>
<p>“Alright there Harry?” asks someone.</p>
<p>Harry looks up and into the face of Draco Malfoy, who’s looking back at him from his own station with a mixture of concern and bemusement.</p>
<p>“Brilliant,” Harry says. “I meant to do that. Ran out of space up here.”</p>
<p>That startles a laugh out of Draco, before he goes back to focusing on his own bake.</p>
<p>Harry turns back to his sponge and is relieved to see it’s turned out acceptable. He applies cooling charms after dry-rolling it so that he can fill it immediately. Soon, curses and groans of despair aplenty are heard beneath the canopy as everyone gets started on rolling up their sponges.</p>
<p>It’s fiddly work, and there isn’t a good spell to keep the delicate cake layer from breaking, at least not one that Harry’s found. Behind him, Hermione’s muttering grows increasingly desperate. Padma is crying into her crumbling peppermint mocha creation, and Neville switches frantically between comforting her and finishing his own work. At the station next to Harry’s, Draco keeps blotting his face with a monogramed handkerchief, and Ernie, who insists on calling his roll a <em>roulade</em>, has taken to chugging the gin he used for flavoring. It’s all an emotional mess, dotted with Pansy’s occasional pointed questions and Ron’s repeated inquiries of “Er, mate, are you sure that the napkin there is supposed to be inside the roll?” to an unconcerned Greg Goyle.</p>
<p>Harry, feeling the pressure, wonders how he ever thought this would be light entertainment.</p>
<p>Ron and Parkinson count down from ten with the crowd, and they’ve reached three when Harry realizes he’s forgotten the final flourish on his decoration, and he flings himself across the counter with a sieve and a spoonful of icing sugar, barely managing to get it on before the countdown ends and a stasis charm wraps around his creation.</p>
<p>Harry sags, bangs his forehead on the counter, and thanks Merlin it’s over.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” a completely frazzled Hermione asks him.</p>
<p>“Fine,” he says, and falls into step with her as they follow the others to the space behind the work stations, where they line up. “Just a bit intense, yeah?” He files into the space next to Draco, gives Hermione a reassuring smile and then takes a deep, calming breath.</p>
<p>Draco blots at a red stain on his otherwise white shirtsleeve with his handkerchief. “Blast. That’ll never come out.”</p>
<p>“Should have worn short sleeves,” Harry says without thinking, and then winces when Draco freezes, realizing he’s an idiot. “Shit, sorry. I didn’t mean-”</p>
<p>Draco sighs. “I know you didn’t, Harry. Calm down.”</p>
<p>Harry desperately casts for a change of topic, and eventually settles on the obvious. “Happy with your roll?”</p>
<p>Draco grimaces. “I think the raspberry filling ended up too wet,” he says, apparently seriously concerned. “How about yours? Looked good, from what I could see.”</p>
<p>Harry opens his mouth to reply, but it’s then that the judges enter the tent. He is excited to discover that the first one of them is Molly Weasley. Now that he thinks about it, it makes sense – she certainly knows her baking. The second one, shocking him, is Kingsley Shacklebolt. Harry wonders just how the new Minister for Magic got himself roped into this, and who managed to do the roping. It was probably Hermione, or maybe McGonagall. Possibly both.</p>
<p>“Oh my,” Molly says, taking in the mess the contestants have made at and around their stations. Dirty baking sheets, whisks, and icing sugar have been flung anywhere and everywhere. Along with Kingsley, she starts perusing the rolls lined up on the table in front of them. The judging is anonymous, as to avoid accusations of favoritism, since the contestants have been picked from all four houses and all over the popularity spectrum. Harry sees his creation sitting there, all the way to the judges’ left, and hates how long he’s going to have to wait until he knows whether they like it.</p>
<p>“This looks lovely,” Molly says fondly of the first roll. “A bit clumsy, maybe, but certainly made with love.”</p>
<p>Kingsley hums as he eats. “Caramel apple,” he squeezes out. “One of my favorites!”</p>
<p>“And some vanilla as well, unless I’m mistaken.” Molly smiles. “What a wonderful start to the competition.”</p>
<p>They try roll after roll. Goyle’s chosen flavors confound them, and Harry could swear Molly giggles a little after trying Ernie’s boozy creation. Hermione’s tiramisu roll is apparently awful. They both fawn over Luna’s unusual flavor combination of blackberry, basil and lavender, which she has somehow managed to finish despite her whimsically slow approach. Draco’s pink champagne and raspberry roll gets high marks as well, though Molly does comment on the wetness of his filling, like he had feared. Then, finally, they try the ginger spice and maple cream roll Harry has worked so hard on. He holds his breath.</p>
<p>“A little heavy on the ginger,” Kingsley says.</p>
<p>“Quite. It does have a nice, tight roll, and the maple cream is lovely,” says Molly. “But I do wish it had some more sweetness to it.” She studies the lineup of bakers closely for the first time. “Well done, all of you.”</p>
<p>Harry’s shoulders sag, because that did not go as well as he had hoped.</p>
<p>He ends up fifth out of eight – which is made official when the glowing number five Kingsley had scribbled into the air above his swiss roll zooms across the tent and affixes itself to his shirt. As everyone files out and the house-elves descend upon the mess, he vows to make it up in the next round.</p>
