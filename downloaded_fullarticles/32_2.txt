    <p>Hermione Granger was a self-sufficient, independent woman. She never asked for help, because she didn't need any help. And she most definitely did not require any help whilst baking. She had fought death eaters, for Merlin's sake! So, why was she finding it so difficult to bake a bloody cake? She mixed the batter furiously, but the chipped spoon she was using seemed to be resisting her stirring. With a frustrated growl, she let the bowl clatter noisily onto the kitchen countertop. Flour, sugar and chocolate powder-covered nearly every surface of her small kitchenette, appearing to have drifted into even the smallest cracks. She rummaged around, searching for something that would make her baking adventure a little more bearable. There was a bottle of Daisyroot Draught at the back of her storage cupboard. She opened the bottle and sniffed carefully. It smelled good enough and if she was going to spend her entire night baking a cake for Remus' Birthday, she sure as hell wasn't going to do it sober. She poured herself half a glass, but just as she was about to take a sip, her doorbell chimed. Hermione set her glass back down and glanced at the clock. It was quite late for a visitor, and she hadn't invited anyone. Furthermore, she had yet to meet her neighbours, and surely they hadn't suddenly decided to throw her a housewarming party.</p>
<p>She had moved into the flat a few weeks before, with the help of two of her dearest friends, Remus and Sirius. She had decided to rent the small living quarters in the slightly rundown building because they had been the most agreeable of all the cheap units she had visited. The rent was surprisingly low for such a sought after location, so she had immediately applied as a tenant. Diagon Alley was a rather lively place to live as a young adult, so she didn't really mind that the rooms were a little rough around the edges. Yes, it could have been a little more refined, but she painted over the bleak walls with vibrant tones and placed colourful rugs over the scratched wooden floor. She owned little furniture, and she often found herself counting her last coins at the kitchen table. But what she lacked in money, she made up for in books. Random towers of prose and poetry could be found in every corner of her living area, and she prided herself on the fact that she had read every single one of them.<br/>
Her affinity for books was the main reason why she had accepted her job at 'Lupin's Literature'.<br/>
Well that, and the fact that she was working alongside a man she respected immensely. Remus Lupin, her friend and mentor. She had been working in the bookshop for a few months by then, and she found herself enjoying it immensely. So, after a while, she had finally had enough money to upgrade her living situation and moved into her new flat. Her previous living space had, in fact, been a room at the leaky cauldron which she had rented continually. She had, after all, left Hogwarts with no money in her pocket, and no idea what she wanted to do with her life. The thought of working in a bookshop in Diagon Alley had never before crossed her mind but once Remus suggested it she knew that that was exactly what she wanted. <br/>
There was just one thing that tainted her otherwise perfect life and it pained her to admit it. She had tried and tried to ignore the hollow feeling in her chest, as well as the gnawing sense that something was wrong. But, she couldn't deny it anymore. She was lonely. She yearned for someone to come home to every day after work. Someone to eat dinner with. Someone she could touch. Yes, she had had relationships before, but they usually came to an end after a few months. Like her relationship with Ron. They had stayed friends after the break-up, exchanging the odd letter and meeting up every few weeks for a beer at the leaky cauldron, but it was obvious that their relationship would never be anything more than neighbourly. Other nights she would have dinner with Sirius, Remus and Tonks at Grimmauld Place, or she would go to the cinema with Harry and Ginny. She had even indulged in a few late nights with Fred and George Weasley, but those 'rendezvous' were rare, seeing as they usually ended with a dreadful hangover the next morning. Anyway, her loneliness didn't stem from a lack of social interactions. It was rooted deep inside of her and she had first noticed it after the war when she had finally had time to realise how much had been lost. How much had been taken from her and her friends and how many innocent lives had been wasted.  </p>
<p>She strode towards her front door and unlocked the latch, Sirius had kindly attached for her. With her wand in hand, she cautiously opened the door. After the Horcrux search with Harry and Ron, she had never quite been able to shake the feeling that she was being hunted. By whom or what she didn't know.<br/>
"Yes?" she asked curtly, looking up to the stranger at her threshold.<br/>
"Hi, I live next door. I just moved in and I wanted to ask-" the man faltered, his eyes widening as he recognised whom he was talking to.<br/>
"Yes?" she repeated irritably.<br/>
"Granger?" he asked incredulously and only then did Hermione look at him properly.<br/>
He had tousled white-blonde hair and piercing grey eyes. His face was sharp and defined, giving him an aristocratic demeanour. He wore a simple white shirt with a forest green jersey, and his legs were clad in navy blue jeans. His feet, however, were bare, a stark contrast to his otherwise tidy appearance. She didn't believe that she had ever seen this man before, but something about his features was strangely familiar. Hermione's eyes narrowed and a sense of recognition washed over her.<br/>
"Malfoy?"<br/>
"I knew it! What on earth are you doing here?" he inquired his eyebrows raised questioningly, the corners of his mouth twitching slightly as if he was holding back a smile.<br/>
"I live here," she replied drily, not yet sure if she was glad to see him.<br/>
"No. I live here." he shot back.<br/>
She glared up at him, her scowl making it abundantly clear that she was in no mood for his foolishness. Furthermore, she was seemingly having a pretty foul reaction to seeing him and wanted their exchange to be as concise as possible. He rubbed his neck sheepishly, colour creeping into his cheeks as he realised that she didn't want to engage in any 'banter'.<br/>
"I actually just came to ask if you have a spare key..." he began.<br/>
She exhaled audibly, her frown becoming more pronounced. He averted his gaze and gestured vaguely towards the door to his flat. It looked identical to her's and something about that bothered her immensely. Or maybe it was just Malfoy's presence which was irking her. She crossed her arms and, glanced over her shoulder, catching a glimpse of the slightly rusty key her landlord had given her. He was a man of little words and hadn't bothered explaining what it was for. <br/>
"You locked yourself out of your flat?" she asked not bothering to keep the accusing tone out of her voice.<br/>
"I guess," he replied hotly.<br/>
She shrugged and turned her back to him, her hand still firmly placed on the wand in her pocket. She snatched the key from the small hook above her dresser and faced him once more.<br/>
"I don't know if this is the right key, but I guess it's worth a try."<br/>
He nodded stiffly, shoving his hands into his pocket, and let her walk past him towards his flat door. She shoved the key roughly into the lock and twisted. It didn't budge. She tried again with a little more vigour, but the door refused to open.<br/>
"Here, let me," he said quietly.<br/>
She whirled around and glared at him with such venom, that he backed down immediately, gesturing for her to continue. After several more aggressive twists, she stepped away, throwing her hands up in surrender.<br/>
"It's not working."<br/>
"I can see that," Malfoy replied, a smile playing on his lips again.<br/>
She moved to the side and let him take a shot at opening the stubborn entry. He gave the key a swift turn and the door opened with a soft click. She didn't move and her face was stony and cold as she scowled at him. She didn't understand why she was being so hostile. He hadn't done anything wrong, in fact, he had been nothing other than friendly, but something about seeing him again after such a long time rubbed her the wrong way.<br/>
"Well, thanks for the key," he said, grinning now, and handed her the key with an exaggerated flourish.<br/>
She snatched it from him and shoved it into her front pocket.<br/>
"My pleasure," she snarked.<br/>
He eyed her curiously, seemingly immune to her unfriendliness.<br/>
Then he hesitated somewhat at the door, gave her a short nod and finally entered his flat, closing the door behind him. She exhaled slowly, unwinding slightly. Then, she walked back towards her apartment, but just as she was about to slam the door behind her, Malfoy spoke. His door was open a crack and he was smirking at her, leaning casually against the wooden frame.<br/>
"Nice seeing you again, Granger."<br/>
She didn't reply. Instead, she slammed the door in his face. What was she supposed to say? She didn't know what she felt about being Malfoy's new neighbour. </p>
<p>"Rough night?" Remus asked as she entered the shop the next morning.<br/>
The small bell they had attached to the frame, tinkled softly as she yanked the door open. Her hair was a mess and her face was tired and drained. She had stayed up way too late baking that god awful cake and then when she had finally gone to bed, she had been plagued by nightmares. She shut the door behind her, throwing her coat onto the rack beside her.<br/>
"A little," she replied incoherently, her teeth clamped around her wand whilst she tied her hair into a ponytail.<br/>
She was wearing her favourite blue dungarees with a tight red top underneath. Even though she had been fatigued when she woke up, she had decided to make an effort for the party at Sirius' house later on.<br/>
"Want to talk about it?" he asked, eyeing the dark rings under her eyes.<br/>
She sighed and joined him behind the heavy wooden desk.<br/>
"Not really," she replied, then smiled at him, forcing herself to push her bad mood aside.<br/>
She placed the carrier bag she had been lugging around with her all morning onto a chair, careful to let the material of the rucksack cover the cake. She had placed it into a paper box, one she had saved from a visit to her favourite bakery. <br/>
"Ok. I'll be here when you do."<br/>
She was touched by his kindness and gave him a quick hug.<br/>
"Happy Birthday, Remus," she said softly.<br/>
He grinned down at her and squeezed her shoulders gently, his laugh lines crinkling softly. It was a gesture she had often seen on her father, and once again she was hit with a wave of affection for the older man. He treated her like the daughter he had never had. She didn't mind. Not one bit. After all, her real father didn't even know who she was and she had been the one who had bought about his memory loss.<br/>
"Do I like much older?" he asked jokingly, turning back to the pile of books he had been sorting through before she came.<br/>
"No, of course not!" she exclaimed loudly, an amused smirk stretching across her face.<br/>
His deep rumble of a laugh echoed through the small shop and she was finally able to push her restless night aside and get to work.<br/>
"Well, maybe you have a few more grey hairs, but other than that-" she muttered jokingly, dodging as he playfully swatted her arm.<br/>
They stood in amicable silence, each of them finding something to do before the first customers could start rolling in.<br/>
"You're coming tonight, aren't you? Tonks really wants to see you again," Remus said after a while, pushing his oval glasses up his nose as he examined the cover of one of the books.<br/>
His glasses were a new accessory and he had only allowed Tonks to take him to an optician after he had mistaken Teddy for an actual teddy.<br/>
"Of course, I am," she responded immediately, feeling a tingle of joy as she thought about the upcoming night. <br/>
She would finally see everyone again and after her odd encounter with Malfoy the night before, she felt a growing need to see some familiar faces. For something about her new neighbour's presence made her feel uneasy. It was an unexplored territory which she wasn't quite sure she was ready to discover.</p>
