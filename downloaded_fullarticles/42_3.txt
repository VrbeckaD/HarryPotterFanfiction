  <em>
    <span>You need a north star,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Dr. Mercer had said. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Someone with a good heart.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Dex listened to her voice over and over again. North star. Good job. Structure. He had to hold it together, had to cope, had to -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Running. He could go running. Burn off some energy. Not the same running route as Julie, no, but -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He ran. He ran and he ran and he ran, trying to outrun the voices in his head, the agony of rejection, the fear, the -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There, on the side of the running path. Another man in running gear. He’d stopped by a cluster of cardboard boxes. Homeless people. He was smiling and talking to the old man tucked into the box. He was handing out food.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Someone with a good heart.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Dex didn’t think. He veered toward the man. “Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man turned, smiled. He had blue eyes, dimples. “Hey yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re feeding homeless people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Veterans, these guys,” the man said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dex looked the man up and down. He was older by a few years. Broad across the shoulders. Strong. No match for Dex, but no weak man either. Probably didn’t scare easy. “You served?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Air Force. You?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Army.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man’s smile brightened. He offered a hand. “Evan Lorne.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Benjamin Poindexter. People call me Dex.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“People call me Lorne, even though I’ve been out a while. You run this route on the regular? I haven’t seen you around before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Trying something new.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I come out here pretty much every day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You always bring food?” Dex asked. Someone with a good heart would bring food often, wouldn’t he?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As much as I can carry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dex said, “I’ll help you carry some.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lorne’s smile brightened. “You’re a good man, Dex.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, but I’m trying to be.”</span>
