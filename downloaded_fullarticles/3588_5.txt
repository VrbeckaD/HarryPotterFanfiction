    <p>The light filtered in through the dorm windows. The room was empty, as empty as how Seamus felt. He had pushed the door open to see only his and Neville's trunks at the end of their beds. 3 of the beds were vacant, and the silence in the room was unbearable. </p>
<p>Seamus sighed and begun unpacking his trunk. The feast tonight was a somber one, with the threat of destruction looming over the students. Seamus felt a pang of pain in his heart every time he thought of the Sorting Ceremony. The 1st years were afraid to go up to the Sorting Hat, scared they would be ripped out of line for being a Muggleborn. So many had already vanished, they had a right to be scared. The new Death Eaters installed among the professors certainly didn't help ease the fear at Hogwarts. </p>
<p>It didn't help that today was Seamus's 17th birthday. Just a week ago, his dad had left him and his mum to go into hiding. It had been to help them blend in with the Wizarding world. Now three of his best mates was missing or gone. Harry had vanished, Seamus hoped, in the attempts to stop He-Who-Sha...Voldemort. Ron was sick with spattergroit, Ginny said, but it was obvious that he and Hermione were with Harry.</p>
<p>And Dean...Seamus's eyes filled with tears as he remembered the scrawled note he received from Dean after getting home at the end of 6th year. </p>
<p>
  <em>Can't talk, won't be able to until this mess get's sorted out. Ministry thinks I'm a Muggle-born, they're on the hunt for me. Might try to torture me for Harry. Hid my mum in America with my aunt. Be safe. <strong>Love, Dean</strong></em>
</p>
<p>His 17th birthday had never been more stressful, Seamus thought as he chucked his books onto his bed. Voldemort in power, Death Eaters at Hogwarts, his best mate and crush on the run, and this stupid soulmate thing. His clock had appeared on his wrist. The time counting down until he met his soulmate. Seamus wasn't that interested in finding his soulmate, especially on the brink of war. The nasty thought of not having Dean for a soulmate popped back into his head, but he pushed it away as he put up his socks. There had to be a chance, he thought as he watched the clock slowly count down. 7 months, 30 days, 18 hours, 5 minutes, and 4 seconds to go.</p>
<p>******************************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p><em>"Crucio!"</em> a sinister voice screamed from the shadows. Seamus felt searing pain rush through his body, the worst thing he's ever felt. it was so unbearable, his mouth opened to scream, yet nothing came out of it. His body convulsed against the bonds, the chair he was tied to shook with the tremors he felt. </p>
<p>As the pain subsided, Seamus felt the urge to break. He could just end this now, give them the locations of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The pain could end, he could be let free, rewarded even. The thought was tempting, so tempting that he opened his mouth to recant. But the thought of Dean being tortured and killed gave him the resolve, and Seamus locked his jaw in place. He'd never betray Dean. The moldy and damp chamber would kill him first.</p>
<p>"Oh, is the little wittle puff not gonna betray his puff boyfriend? Don't worry you little pooter, we'll get it out of you yet." screeched the high pitched voice of Amycus Carrow.  He emerged from the shadows, wand pointed at Seamus's flushed face. "You know, if you're wondering if McGonagall is going to save you, you can believe she isn't. She's mighty busy, I hear my sister had a bunch of first years terrified.." Amycus hissed, spittle flying onto the Gryffindor's face. "I'm actually quite surprised you've managed this long, that dumb-ass Neville passed out long before this." </p>
<p>Seamus strained against the bonds holding him to the chair. The homophobic insults were one thing, but making fun of Neville was another. The boy was the leader of the rebels at Hogwarts. To call him a dumb-ass was worse than calling Seamus a puff. Sweat began forming on Seamus's brow as he continued to struggle. </p>
<p>"You know, I could just hold you in here forever. I could just torture you until you break. Or die. Wonder what your dear soulmate would think if there clock stopped working." Amycus menacingly sneered at the boy and began slithering around the chair. "I mean, who would look for a Gryffindor in the Chamber of Secrets? Especially whenever the one boy to open it is nowhere to be found. I could just let you rot..." Amycus trailed off. "Or you could be rewarded, my boy. The Dark Lord will find a convented place amongst his ranks for the one who turns over Harry Potter. Think of the power." Amycus said as he neared Seamus's face. "You could even save your dear queer boyfriend.."</p>
<p>Seamus was enraged at the idea that Amycus thought he would want to join the Death Eaters, just to save Dean. The thought had occurred to him during the wee hours of the night when Neville had fallen asleep amidst his sobs. But he always pushed it down with the memories of him and Dean. </p>
<p>Seamus leaned in, pretending to be listening to Amycus's offers, and spit in the man's face. "You're a right ole bastard if ya think I'd go over to Voldemort's side. Your head must be stuck right up your arse, ya bloody cunt." Seamus yelled defiantly.</p>
<p>Amycus calmly wiped the spit off his face and straightened up. He slowly pointed the wand towards Seamus's face, and whispered "You should not have done that."</p>
<p>Seamus's screams bounced off the high marble walls of the Chamber of Secrets. </p>
<p>*****************************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Seamus dashed through the halls, his heart pounding and his breath being torn from his lungs. He heard the yells of the Carrows behind him, the screams of the students as they scampered out of their way, the crash of armor as the curses whizzed narrowly past his ear.<br/>
He had managed to escape the Chamber of Secrets, after days of torture and abuse. It was a long a painful process, and Seamus was black and blue whenever he emerged from the sink. Sneaking down to the kitchen was easy than he thought. He had run into the obnoxious Peeves, and he was sure he was dead. However, Peeves set him onto a route to the kitchen where he would not run into Snape or the Carrows. weird sure, but Peeves hated the Carrows, he hated seeing Hogwarts be torn apart. </p>
<p>Seamus was determined to escpae this prison of a school. After grabbing food from the house-elves, he sneaked his way into the Gryffindor tower.He was gathering all of his things into his knapsack when Neville had entered the dorm. </p>
<p>"Seamus? Seamus, you're alive?" Neville said as he stood in the doorway. After wincing at the look of the brusies and cuts on Seamus's face, Neville ran over and engulfed him into a hug. "Well, you've looked better. Everyone was so worried, especially your mum. She came up here a couple nights ago, almost killed the Carrows."</p>
<p>Seamus was glad for Neville, glad that he still had a friend at Hogwarts. But he had to escape soon, he thought, as he shrugged Neville off of him. "Look, Neville, I'm fixin to disappear for a while. I need ya to get a message out to me mum, she'll go into hiding. Need her to be safe, they can't torture her like they did me." Seamus said rapidly, noticing Neville's eyes widen at the mention of torture. "Not that big a deal. Just make sure me mum and everyone in Gryffindor tower is safe." Seamus grabbed his knapscak, slung it over his shoulders, and turned his back on Neville.</p>
<p>Neville gripped Seamus's shoulders, stopping him from walking out. "Look, before you go, there's something I need to tell you. There's a safe room in Hogwarts, called the Room of Requirement. Hermione told me about it last year, guess she figured she wouldn't be coming back. It's on the seventh floor, across form the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. It may look like a blank wall, but you just gotta think real hard on what you need. The house-elves will bring you up food and drink. Head there if you run into the Carrows."</p>
<p>It was these words that resonated within Seamus's head as he ducked all the hexes. Climbing up the stairs three at a time, Seamus pulled his wand out from his sleeve. when he reached the top of the stairs, Seamus screamed <em>"Reducto!"</em> The stairs gave way to a pile of rubble, and the Carrows were forced to stop chasing Seamus. His victory was short-lived, however, as the siblings started screaming curses up towards him. </p>
<p>Seamus turned and began running towards the tapestry. The screams faded as he arrived at the tapestry. Turning towards the blank wall, Seamus begun frantically thinking of everything he needed. <em>"I need a room to hide in. I need to hide from the Carrows. I need to be safe. I need..."</em> A door appeared in the midst of Seamus's musing. Throwing it open, Seamus was confronted with a small room, equipped with a hammock, desk and a bathroom. A fire was blazing in the fireplace, washing the room with a warm, amber glow. He dropped his knapsack on the ground and walked over to the bed. Seamus fell onto it with a groan, his eyes catching a glance of his wrist as it fell past his head. 4 months, 23 hours, 30 minutes, 2 seconds and counting until he met his soulmate. Seamus chuffed at the thought, and turned to stare into the memorizing fire. </p>
<p>*****************************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Harry was alive, Harry was alive. Seamus was so glad. He couldn't go and hug him, as he had recently been roughed up after going to get food for the team. But Harry was alive, there was a chance they could win. Seamus's eyes took in the sight of his friends, a bit banged up but still brimming with fight. He drank in their confidence, their appearance themselves was enough to make his bones feel less weary. Seamus's eyes dropped down to his wrists as Harry and Neville began arguing over something. He only had 10 seconds.</p>
<p>10...<br/>
"Why can't you tell us? It's something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?"<br/>
"Well, yeah-"<br/>
9...<br/>
"Then we'll help you."<br/>
"You don't understand..."<br/>
8...<br/>
"We're his army. Dumbledore's army. We're all in this together..."<br/>
7...<br/>
"It hasn't exactly been a picnic, mate." Ron muttered.<br/>
6...<br/>
"I never said it was, but I don't see why you can't trust us..."<br/>
5...<br/>
The tunnel door had just opened again.<br/>
4...<br/>
"We got your message, Neville!..."<br/>
3...<br/>
Luna crawled out of the hole, it wasn't her. Seamus still had 3 seconds left.<br/>
2...<br/>
Seamus started suddenly. Wait, we?<br/>
1..<br/>
0...<br/>
As the clock reached zero, Seamus stared into the dark passageway. A hand emerged, grasping onto the doorway. The hand was then followed by Dean Thomas, his best mate.<br/>
<em>Dean is my soulmate? Dean is my soulmate!</em> Seamus thought, relief flooding over him. He jumped up from his seat on the floor, and ran to engulf Dean in a hug. </p>
<p>"Hey, Seamus! You look like shit." Dean said as he returned the hug.<br/>
"Oi, shut up for a second." Seamus muttered as he grabbed Dean's wrist. He was so nervous, his fingers were shaking as he flipped it over. 0hr, 0min, 0sec. "Was it Luna?" Seamus whispered, his voice wavering. The thought of Dean not being his soulmate hurt.</p>
<p>"No." Dean whispered. "It was you." Seamus looked into Dean's eyes, and saw the truth reflected in them. </p>
<p>"Hey, Seamus, Dean. Let's get going, we got a castle to protect!" Lavender shouted, as she ran out the door. The two men looked at each other, grabbed each others hands and headed towards the battle.</p>
<p>*****************************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Seamus was covered in soot and burns as he ran toward the castle. He had set off many explosions, effectively isolating the castle from anymore Death Eaters. Voldemort had given them an hour, a hour to recover and mourn their dead. Seamus could only see blurs as he ran through the doors, and then everything went in slow motion. </p>
<p>Fred was dead. George and Percy were crying over his body. Ron was holding Hermione as his tears fell. Seamus turned, there was Lavender in a crumpled heap. Her girlfriend Parvati crying, screaming for Voldemort's head, and cursing in Hindi. Colin Creevey, the annoying brat in 6th year, had died as well. His brother was silent, a disconcerting scene in the room of mourning. Harry was looking at Professor Lupin and a woman's body, their wrist turned upwards as they held hands in death. The 0hr, 0min,0sec was burned into their wrists, a sign that each other's soulmate had died.</p>
<p>Seamus quickly looked down at his wrist. If the numbers had burned into his wrist while he was setting fires, he would not have felt it. A sigh of relief was realesed as the black zeroes stared back at him. Thank heaven. </p>
<p>"Seamus" called a voice from behind him, a voice of love and comfort. Seamus turned to see Dean running towards him, a smile on his face. "I thought you were dead!" Dean yelled as he came closer.</p>
<p>"Gonna take a lot more than a bunch'o bug..." Seamus stopped talking abruptly, he was too wrapped up in the fact that Dean Thomas was kissing him. The blur of motion had stopped before he started talking, grabbed him by the arms and lifted him up. Too elated for words, Dean just shoved his lips onto the Irish man's, silencing his babble. Seamus couldn't think clearly, he couldn't feel anything, he couldn't mourn. Dean was here, Dean was kissing him, it was the only thing important. He wanted to scream out "Let us have more than an hour, let us have a day, a month, a year!" Seamus broke the kiss to the sounds of cheers and finally's and tears. They were all so happy to have a sliver of hope in such a depressing time. </p>
<p>"I love you, have fer all of the time I met ya." Seamus whispered, resting his head on Dean's chest.<br/>
"I love you too, let's go somewhere more quiet." Dean whispered back, grabbing Seamus's hand and pulling him away from the war.</p>
<p>The only thing that Seamus could think was <em>If we survive this bloody war, I'm gonna marry this bloody wanker.</em></p>
