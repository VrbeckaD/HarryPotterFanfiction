    <p> </p>
<p align="justify">- I’ve always wanted to marry…<br/>
- That’s a very direct statement, don’t you think?<br/>
- You are very fast at catching them huh?<br/>
- It is my specialty, princess… I love you…<br/>
- I love you too.</p>
<p align="justify">I woke up in my bed, in my soft grey stone room. There were they, my old mahogany furniture and my bright blue curtains. The fire of the chimney was gone, and I felt that tears were rolling down my cheeks. I didn’t know where to go or whom to speak with. I was alone, as always.</p>
<p align="justify"><br/>
…</p>
<p><br/>
- Already morning, another happy morning! -- I started to say, trying to believe my own words (without any success) -- Where are my damn glasses? -- I said while searching the room, until a beam touched my eyelids.</p>
<p>- It’s beautiful… I always forget how stupid I am. -- The stone window showed a magnificent view of the lake at sunrise: reds, oranges, yellows and pinks all mixed up creating a beautiful painting. At the distance, the tall trees from the Forbidden Forest were changing colours, and some leaves started to fall, making the painting created in the lake even more incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Suddenly there was a knock on the door and I quickly grabbed my black dressing gown, always soft, my favourite one, it reminded me of him...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Good morning Amelia.-- A tall, thin man, with greasy, long black hair stood before me. He had tired eyes, but I could see a hint of curiosity in them.<br/>
- Good morning Severus, lack of sleep?<br/>
- Yes, I do not sleep much lately.<br/>
- Why is that? -- I put on my round glasses, making my green eyes sparkle.<br/>
- With all this new “help” around the castle, it is difficult to be at ease. Furthermore, my past is troublesome and I dread any mistake that could put me in danger. -- Said Snape, looking down, no in fear, but in regret.<br/>
- You should not worry about them, you are a good person. Dumbledore trusts you, I trust you. -- Such horrible creatures, the Dementors. They can eat your happiness and leave you dry. No more happy thoughts, just despair. <strong>Better to stay away from them.</strong><br/>
- Thank you Amelia. Time for breakfast. Do not be late or Hagrid will eat all the pancakes. -- He seemed more distant, even if that's possible.<br/>
- Please, put some of them on the side for me. -- I begged with puppy eyes.<br/>
- I promise nothing… but I will try.<br/>
- Thank you, you are the best! I will be down in five. -- I started to take off my clothes, but the door was still open and Severus was still there, cheecks flushed. He closed the door very quietly and left, thinking that I forgot that he was there. I didn’t. I liked to tease him.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">I looked for something to wear, a long dress perhaps. I decided to wear a green one with my black cape. It matched perfectly with my black heels and some tights. I left my auburn hair on the loose, just the way I liked it: long, natural and put to the side. I started to look for my books for the day and for my wand when a sudden noise made me jump.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Oh dear Merlin! It was just the morning owls with the paper… Now that I think about it, it has been long since I’ve found one to read while eating breakfast…-- It was true, it felt like the world didn’t want to give me a newspaper. It felt like it wanted me to be isolated from the outside world.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Going down the tower in which my bedroom was located, I started to hear the sounds of students rushing to eat breakfast, to which I smiled. At the Great Hall I saw Hagrid carrying all the newspapers. He was a big guy, but all those papers were obviously a lot, even for him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Hagrid! Wait! Can I have one please? -- I shouted from the other side of the room, but I found no answer, only doubt and sweat from Hagrid’s face. He started to run and I chased him. -- No way! <strong><em>Accio newspaper!</em></strong> -- A paper from the pile came to me in a rush while I grinned in triumph.<br/>
- No! Amelia, wait! -- I heard Severus, he was looking at me, pale. I also saw Dumbledore, standing up from the table, slowly, looking at me, with only sadness in his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">There was something inside of me telling me that once I looked at the paper, there was no turning back. Acting by pure instinct, I looked anyways. Suddenly, I felt dizzy and confused, sad and angry, tired and afraid, all at once. I was speechless. There were only a few words and a picture in the paper, but they were the only things necessary to break my heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify">- <em><strong>“Have you seen this wizard?”</strong></em>-- The photograph in front of me showed a dirty, angry and malnourished face. It not only made me remember the worst day of my entire life, but also the better days when I wasn’t alone, when I was with the man of the photo. When I shared my life with Sirius Black.</p>
