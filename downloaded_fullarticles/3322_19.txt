    <p>Hermione scanned the parchment one last time in disgust before tossing it into the flames with a sick twist of amusement. </p>
<p>Another bloody Victory Ball, and based on the wording Minerva had included, it was more than just <i>strongly encouraged</i> that she attend. Why, according to the Headmistress, it was of ‘paramount importance’ that the new Muggle Studies Professor attend. </p>
<p>Bah! As if she didn’t have more important things to do than attend yet another ball celebrating the fall of the Dark Lord and the triumph of the light.</p>
<p>Her eyes darted towards her drab, empty little closet and all of the drab, doughty little dresses she knew resided within. She could wear the buttoned-up black number again, the one she wore to the ball only last week, surely? </p>
<p>Or perhaps the purple one, with the long sleeves and dropped waist, from a few weeks before that?</p>
<p>She sighed heavily and padded in the direction of her kitchen. </p>
<p>Dear old <i>Ronald</i> said the purple made her look like something out of those prairie books his father read sometimes. </p>
<p>She sighed once more at the thought of Ronald.</p>
<p>There was a romance that had turned sour long, <i>long</i> before she finally had the courage to open her bloody eyeballs and acknowledge the truth before her. Not that things were all that sparkling to begin with, but surely, she should have seen the truth much sooner than several weeks prior at the purple-dress ball.</p>
<p>She did not, even a little bit, have any romantic affection for Ronald.</p>
<p>Not one iota.</p>
<p>Not one ounce.</p>
<p>Not <i>one</i>.</p>
<p>It made her grimace when he touched her; it made her sigh in annoyance when he begged for a kiss; it made her plain old sad when he found his release and she had to find a good vibrator and ten minutes of alone time in order to find hers. </p>
<p>She had watched him, standing on the perimeter in her purple sack of a dress, and realized as he danced with none other than Luna bloody Lovegood that he looked happier than she’d seen him in such a long time.</p>
<p>Maybe even <i>ever</i>.</p>
<p>“I don’t love him. I don’t even really <i>like</i> him all that much.” She couldn’t help mumbling. </p>
<p>The truths had just popped out unbidden as she had watched his face flush and Luna actually blush in response.</p>
<p>“I know,” Ginny had said quietly, sliding an arm around Hermione’s shoulders. “He doesn’t love you, either,” she’d said. “How about setting him free, yeah?”</p>
<p>She hadn’t hesitated a moment, and simply marched in the direction of the dance floor, intend on freeing Ronald from the loveless relationship she’d confined him to.</p>
<p>It would have gone swimmingly, and they both could have parted happy as clams, if he hadn’t let his stupid, childish, bloody fucking <i>pride</i> get in the way. </p>
<p>He’d looked sheepishly around the dance floor, took in the sight of the reporters avidly hanging on every last word, and then <i>loudly and without qualms</i> announced to the entire Wizarding World that he couldn’t wait to be rid of a cold, dry fish like her.</p>
<p>He actually compared her to cod.</p>
<p>“Fucking <i>Weasley</i>,” she grumbled savagely as she dug into her takeout container and eyed her bedroom door once more.</p>
<p>Well, she’d show him. She’d show them all.</p>
<p>Hermione Jean Granger might be many things- a know it all, a nuisance, a naïve little <i>mudblood</i>.</p>
<p>But she was not a <i>cod</i>.</p>
<p>~*~</p>
<p>Hermione swallowed thickly as her eyes swept up and down the mirror one last time while she twisted and turned. “You don’t think it is too much?”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes as Harry mumbled, “quite the opposite” while Ginny elbowed him roughly in the ribs.</p>
<p>Hermione felt a savage delight when she heard him cough in response. </p>
<p>“It is <i>perfect</i> and don’t you doubt it for one tiny second, Hermione.” She met Ginny’s reflection in the mirror and pulled her shoulders back tight and her chin up high.</p>
<p>Right then. </p>
<p>
  <i>Right.</i>
</p>
<p>She could do this. </p>
<p>She followed the future Potters-to-be over to the floo, pausing to give Crooks a scratch behind the ear as she slipped on the delicate yellow silk heels she’d purchased and charmed to perfectly match her gown. </p>
<p>Well, gown was a rather generous description. </p>
<p>It was a- well, a slinky little yellow silk number with a swooping back and a plunging neckline and a slit clear up to her thigh. It was about the furthest one could get from a bloody sack.</p>
<p>It was about the furthest one could get from <i>doughty</i>, too.</p>
<p>In an effort to firmly keep herself on the right side of the slutty versus sexy line she’d opted for a classic French twist in her hair, with her curls charmed to artfully tumble over one shoulder. </p>
<p>Her makeup was simple, her hair was behaving, and for the first time since the ball with Viktor Krum she was filled with a heady anticipation that finally, <i>finally</i>, she was going to garner the <i>right</i> kind of attention at one of these functions.</p>
<p>She stepped out of the floo behind the future Potters and directly into the gaping, stunned face of Ronald <i>bloody</i> Weasley.</p>
<p>Luna, bless her, just gave Hermione a dreamy smile as she twined her fingers through Ronald’s hair, “even the wifflegraff’s think you are lovely this evening, Hermione,” she said wistfully to somewhere over Hermione’s left shoulder.</p>
<p>“Um, thank you, Luna,” she coughed back a laugh.</p>
<p>“You look like a <i>girl</i>.” </p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed as she swept past his stunned expression. </p>
<p>That was <i>not</i> the kind of attention she’d exactly had in mind.</p>
<p>~*~</p>
<p>Lucius preened as he straightened his robes and combed his hair one last time. He had spent the better part of the afternoon practicing the sneer he would grace Narcissa with if she strode in with one of her new paramours, all haughty contempt and cold beauty.</p>
<p>Her paramours could keep her. Their divorce was final, and he was happy to be rid of her. The fall of their marriage coinciding with the fall of their ‘Lord’ mattered naught to him. </p>
<p>He was a Malfoy. He would always rise above, with dignity, grace, and disdain.</p>
<p>He practiced his sneer once last time, allowing it to effortlessly fall back into an unemotional smirk. He wordlessly flicked his wrist and summoned his cane as he strolled in the direction of his floo. </p>
<p>He was as ready as he would ever be.</p>
<p>~*~</p>
<p>The gown might have been a tad bit too much for the Wizarding World to handle. Or rather, its <i>wizards</i>.</p>
<p>She couldn’t escape the wandering hands of Blaise Zabini or the blushing stammers of dear Neville fast enough as she bolted towards the open bar. </p>
<p>Thank the heavens the bars were always open at this type of thing. </p>
<p>She ordered a tumbler of scotch on the rocks, two fingers, and as she brought it to her parched lips she slunk off to mope in the corner of the ballroom. Perhaps she could hide behind a potted fern or two, toss back a few tumblers, and pass enough time where it would be appropriate for her to leave?</p>
<p>That had been the plan, anyway. She was successful with tumbler one, and had only had to make passing conversation with another wallflower before she’d been forced from her hiding place to refill her glass. </p>
<p>Hermione tapped on the bar top as she anxiously waited for the return of her courage until she had the unsettling sensation of being watched. A quick glance over her shoulder, and she found herself slamming into the curious glance of none other than one Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, where he rested his arm and cane casually on a cabaret table.</p>
<p>The air left her lungs in a literal rush, and she had the dizzying thought that she’d never, <i>ever</i> seen him look quite so handsome.</p>
<p>Wait…</p>
<p>When had she <i>ever</i> thought him handsome in the first place?!</p>
<p>She vaguely registered over the sound of her own blood roaring in her ears the sound of a “madame! Your drink!”, and with not even a backward glance she swiped up the glassware and cradled it to her chest.</p>
<p>She stood there, frozen, not even daring to breathe, as she basked in the gaze of Lucius Malfoy.</p>
<p>It was intoxicating. </p>
<p>It was mystifying. </p>
<p>It was <i>terrifying</i> and she was nearly paralyzed with fear until he slowly, ever so slowly, allowed a full smirk to tug those luscious lips, as he raised his glass high in front, tipped it slightly in her direction, and nodded with a flick of his head. </p>
<p>Dear, sweet mother of Merlin. He was saluting her.</p>
<p>His eyes didn’t break with hers for even a moment as he took a long sip of his drink. <i>Whiskey, several fingers, on the rocks</i>, she noted dimly.</p>
<p>She was trapped, unable to move, unable to <i>breathe</i> until a commotion at the front of the ballroom seemed to draw his attention. </p>
<p>His attention, and his ire, she realized, as she watched his back straighten, his fingers clench white, and his mask of scorn fall firmly into place, that patented Malfoy sneer curling his lips once more.</p>
<p>She felt her heart actually <i>clench</i> at the sight. </p>
<p>At the loss.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but look to see what had caused the transformation, and the sight literally had her pausing mid-sip.</p>
<p>Narcissa Malfoy, sparkling like a diamond, was escorted on the arm of none other than one Charles Weasley.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>She didn’t even pause to think. She just sucked in a deep breath, lifted her chin, and marched with determination in his direction, until she found herself laying a hand on his tight forearm where it rested next to his cane on the table. </p>
<p>Goodness, tight was an understatement. The man was rock solid.</p>
<p>He was <i>steel</i>.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth as her eyes swept up to meet his stunned face.</p>
<p>Oh, dear. His eyes were steel, too.</p>
<p>Well, nothing for it now. She was already committed.</p>
<p>Committed to what?</p>
<p>Good heavens, she was casually touching Lucius bloody Malfoy in the middle of a bloody ball.</p>
<p>What in Hades was she thinking? What was she doing?</p>
<p>What was she going to <i>say</i>?</p>
<p>She started to panic as her eyes swept over his cursedly handsome face, and she watched in alarm as his mask fell firmly back into place and his forearm impossibly tightened further. Surely, he would say something? Rescue her from this <i>hell</i> she found herself in?</p>
<p>One cool eyebrow lifted pointedly, and she actually felt ill.</p>
<p>Since when was Lucius Malfoy known for rescuing damsels in distress? </p>
<p>Since when did she think of herself as a damsel?</p>
<p>Since when did she have nothing to <i>say</i>?</p>
<p>She mustered up all her courage and her best smile and opened her mouth, praying that her words and her wit wouldn’t fail her. “I wouldn’t worry, Mister Malfoy. I’m sure if you just snap your fingers, in less than a week she’ll come running back. I have it on good authority the Weasley’s aren’t really all that.. well-endowed, if you know what I mean.”</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh <i>no</i>.</p>
<p>
  <i>Oh no!!</i>
</p>
<p>Nothing to say and <i>that</i> was what she came up with? She shut her eyes tight in shame, before the most delightful sound she’d ever heard swept up to her ears, into her body and straight down to curl her very toes.</p>
<p>She’d made him <i>laugh</i>. An honest, true, unguarded, bellowing <i>laugh</i>.</p>
<p>Not a chuckle. Not a cough. Not even a feigned polite ha-ha of amusement.</p>
<p>A delicious, rumbling, full of joy <i>laugh</i>.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes to behold the sight, and found herself smiling like a fool and joining right on in with a giggle at the <i>warmth</i> on his face and the lightness in his eyes, not a sneer or scowl in sight.</p>
<p>The sight of the fine lines crinkling around his eyes stole what was left of her breath, as she kept her hand on his arm and laughed and laughed, for once not caring one whit for the thoughts of the wizards and witches around her.</p>
<p>They laughed, and as she wiped a tear from her eye she found herself snared in his welcoming, still unguarded gaze. “I must say, Miss Granger, you are a vision this evening.”</p>
<p>She flushed, literally <i>flushed</i>, with pleasure as her shy gaze dropped to his chest. “Thank you, Mister Malfoy.” </p>
<p>Who on earth was that breathy creature replying to him with a literal <i>gush</i>?</p>
<p>“Please, call me Lucius.” </p>
<p>It was unfair, really. How sensual a name could be. How it could prompt any number of erotic images. “Lucius,” she breathed, lifting her eyes back to his.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>His face was now less open, but no less warm, and the look he was giving her made her head spin and her mind race and her heart nearly beat out of her chest. “A muggle creation, I presume?”</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>She followed his eyes as they trailed from the curls on her shoulder, down over her- oh my goodness, her <i>protruding nipples</i>, all the way to the painted toes of her feet.</p>
<p>She didn’t miss the pause on her nipples the second time, and felt herself blush hotly in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Embarrassment, and arousal, too. </p>
<p>What in Hades was going on with her nipples? And why wasn’t she covering them? Why was she just standing there, hand on his arm, other greedily clutching her glass, staring now at his chest, too?</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes and met his heated stare and thought she could spend all night wrapped up in that gaze until yet another eyebrow lift made her halt in alarm. </p>
<p>He’d said something, and she’d just been her gaping like a bloody fish, a bloody <i>cod</i>, in response. “Yes, I’m a muggle.”</p>
<p>Oh sweet fucking Merlin.</p>
<p>Fuckity fuck fuck <i>fuck</i>. </p>
<p>His lips unfurled in a smirk, though it was more the smile of a shark than a snake, and she had the distinct feeling that after she burst into flames of embarrassment he might eat what was left. “I meant the <i>dress</i>, my <i>dear</i> Miss Granger.” </p>
<p>What in the name of Merlin was wrong with her? “That’s muggle, too, yes. Indeed. Muggle dress. Muggle shoes. Muggle-born witch. Not very comfortable, if I’m being honest. The dress, I mean. Shoes, too, now that I think about it. Do you know, I much prefer comfy pants and a good book for my wild Saturday nights. Not much beats a good flannel or cotton yoga pant. Or a good book. Do you have a favorite? I’m sure you do. I’d heard from Draco you enjoy a good—”</p>
<p>“Miss Granger. Are you asking me if I have a favorite pant? Or are you asking my favorite read? Or is there something else, <i>good</i>, you think I enjoy?”</p>
<p>The bolt of lust that shot down her legs made her nearly fall into him, and she felt hot and cold and anxious and excited and what on earth was she doing? She was leaning into him, her lips her pursing of their own volition, her eyes were starting to dim, and she took in his startled look not one moment too soon when she realized she was <i>leaning into kiss Lucius Malfoy in the middle of a bloody ball!</i></p>
<p>“I need the loo!” She nearly screamed, scrambling back in alarm. “Loo, now, thank you, uh, goodnight!”</p>
<p>She felt hot tears sting her heated cheeks as she raced in the direction of the floo, sparing not a glance back in his direction. </p>
<p>She would never, ever, <i>ever</i> attend a bloody fucking Victory Ball ever again.</p>
