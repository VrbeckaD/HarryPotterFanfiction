    <p>Seeing as AO3 is a bit quirky when it comes to author’s notes, I find stories outside of one-shots are easier to post if I have a preface. So, there’s a bit of background for this project.</p>
<p>First off, I wrote it under the penname <strong>Andrus Tolero</strong> on FFN back during January-April of 2017. I deleted it at some point because I was writing what I thought would end up being a far superior version of the story, only for that version to, well, implode. I ended up having to make use of some Czech/Russian site to recover this story (and seeing as the site is not secure I would not advise going there).</p>
<p>Second, this project is a response to a challenge in DZ2’s Forums on FFN. If you are not familiar with DZ2 and their challenges, then be aware there are often common tropes from Dark/Independent/Evil/etc. Harry Potter projects in almost all of their challenges. So, please be aware that these tropes exist in the story and, at the time in question, I was a bit new to writing challenges and hadn’t quite developed by habit of bending and twisting tropes as far as I could.</p>
<p>Third, since this is a huge thing in fan fiction: if there was a main pairing for the story, it would be tagged. There are only two moments that could even be considered signs of a ‘relationship’ for Harry and considering where the story goes only one of them is viable and, should I do a sequel, will probably be more fully explored there. You will understand why there is no major pairing for Harry throughout the story by the end, I promise you that. Now, this project <em>is</em> complete, so please don’t ask for specific pairings. I will say right here and now Harry will not be paired with any adolescent characters. Period.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve got the pain points out of the way, here is the challenge that this story is a response to. From here, you can decide whether or not you wish to continue forward.</p>
<p>
  <strong>DZ2's 'Queen's Syndrome' Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Plot: </strong>My name is Harry Potter: after years of hell being lied to, abused and broken, I have returned to the magical world. However, if I am to take back my life, I can't be the hero they want me to be. Instead, I must become someone else...I must become <em>something</em> else!</p>
<p><strong>Rules: </strong>Dark or Evil Powerful Harry</p>
<p>It's up to the writer when the story starts, but it MUST have references to Harry's life before he goes through his 'transformation'</p>
<p>As a result of the change he undergoes, Harry becomes harder, more-aggressive and DEFINITELY more-independent</p>
<p>Ron AND Hermione MUST try and oppose Harry's regeneration into a real wizard</p>
<p>If the story starts before Hogwarts, Harry CANNOT befriend Ron OR Hermione</p>
<p>If the story starts before Hogwarts, Harry can go to ANY House</p>
<p>Sirius MUST become free and Harry's ally</p>
<p>NO HARMONY</p>
<p>All other pairings are welcome EXCEPT Harems</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines: </strong>Crossovers</p>
<p>Dark-Lord Harry</p>
<p>Superpowerful/OP-Harry</p>
<p>Post-Hogwarts start (maybe during his kids' time)</p>
<p>Time Travel</p>
<p>As part of his change, Harry finds a way to unlock more power</p>
<p>If the story starts in/after 1st year, Harry gets a resort</p>
<p>Slash</p>
<p>In his desire to become his own man, Harry joins Tom</p>
<p>Harry leaves Hogwarts</p>
<p><strong>Forbidden: </strong>Light Harry</p>
<p>Weak, Naive Harry</p>
<p>If pre-Hogwarts: Ron and Hermione as Harry's friends</p>
<p>Sirius as Harry's enemy</p>
<p>Harmony</p>
<p>Harems</p>
<p>Dumbledore or anyone else getting Harry back to being the BWL</p>
<p>
  <strong>Other than that, it's up to you...</strong>
