    <p>Remus Lupin was a quiet boy. He was introverted to a fault, and not one for the company of the boisterous boys in his village. He preferred solitude and silence (or at least, he thought he did). His slight frame and overlong nose gave him a bookish aura that made the other children his age pointedly ignore him, casting him odd sidelong glances before hurrying off to the bus stop. </p><p>If possible, adults were even worse. The children, well, they at the very least had the common decency to ignore him. But the adults. They took one look at his young face, with his big, sad hazel eyes, and his long, jagged scare, and their faces would fill with pity. </p><p>"Shame," they would whisper to one another. "Poor lad, so young, so sick. It's a shame."</p><p>"And his poor parents," others would mutter back. "Pity, that. What’s it the poor boy has again? I heard it ain’t catching so long as you don’t touch him."</p><p>Remus could tolerate being ignored by his peers. But pity. He could never forgive the poor souls that pitied him.</p><p>Lyall could tolerate being pitied. But he would never forgive his mentor, his favorite professor, revoking Remus’ place at Hogwarts when he was just a toddler.</p><p>
  <em>Mr. Remus Lupin is hereby rejected from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on the grounds of his dangerous contamination and potential for irreversible harm to others. </em>
</p><p>Hope admired Remus and Lyall for their compassion and understanding, for their ability to forgive the ignorance of others. But she refused to tolerate a single bit of it. She may be a muggle, and she may not understand Hogwarts or magic or lycanthropy. But what she did know was that no magic in the world was stronger than a parent's love for their child. And she was going to fight for Remus, until the very end.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Remus first showed signs of magic at age two, when he uncontrollably hiccoughed bright pink bubbles that wouldn’t pop for days. Due to circumstances beyond anyones control, he spent the majority of his childhood inside, hidden away from muggles and wizards alike. He did not go to primary school, neither muggle nor wizarding. And while his father worked long hours at the Ministry and even longer hours at the local green grocer, struggling to make ends meet, his mother dedicated herself to his education. Hope Lupin was an educated woman, and no son of hers was going off to Hogwarts without having a firm grasp of maths and phonics first.</p><p>Hope Lupin knew what the other mothers said, how they whispered behind teacups at garden parties about her unfortunate lot in life. "Imagine," they would say. "Imagine having to spend all day at home. <em>With the children.</em>"</p><p>Hope's eyes would sparkle menacingly at these comments, but she held her tongue. And if all of Susan Farrow's sugar bowls were mysteriously filled with salt at the next garden party, well. That was just a happy coincidence. </p><p>Despite being a muggle, Hope Lupin had an uncommon knack for magical botany. She was more than capable of seeing, not only to Remus' muggle education, but his magical one as well. She would often look up from her row of Mongolian Mandrakes or Bubbling Begonias to watch her son trail a stick wistfully through the air, mimicking the wand movements he saw Lyall use. Hope would smile to herself, happy that despite all his magical misfortunes in life, Remus could still see the light side of magic.</p><p>But as Remus grew older, his magical curiosity waned. Hope and Lyall’s concern for their son grew and grew, filling them both with guilt and frustration. They worried for his lost childhood, for having to watch him grow up too quickly and too seriously. Lyall, plagued with guilt and shame, gave Remus an endless supply of books. He felt, if Remus could not live an extraordinary life, let alone a normal one, at least he could read about them. Hope, though she loved her husband, thought that this was complete and utter shite and set out to fix things herself.</p><p>One day, about a month before Remus' tenth birthday, Hope realized that she had not seen Remus secretly practice his wandwork in months. She sat back on her boot heels, wiping her brow with a muddy gardening glove. "Remus, love," she said.</p><p>Remus dogeared a page in his novel and closed his book. "Yes mum?" he replied quietly.</p><p>"I haven't seen you use magic in a while," she said, scanning her sons face. But, Remus' face remained impassive, blank, as it always did when he was asked uncomfortable personal questions.</p><p>"Mmm," Remus hummed. He stared back at his mother with wide, hazel eyes. She knew he was hiding behind those big, sad eyes, and she saw straight through his façade.</p><p>"Why is that?" she asked.</p><p>Remus sighed, defeated. Hope looked at him calmly, waiting. The Mandrake she was fertilizing gave its pot a violent shake, and she gripped the leaves firmly. Remus came over to help her. He was quiet for a long moment, before replying softly, "I don't see the point."</p><p>"You don't see the point," Hope repeated.</p><p>Remus shrugged a shoulder, eyes downcast. "Yeah, well, I mean it's not like I'm going to go to Hogwarts. Professor Dippet's already told dad no about a thousand times. And what's the point in using magic if it’s just. If I can’t..."</p><p>"If you don't get to use the good parts too," she finished for him.</p><p>Remus looked up at his mother with tears in his eyes, and she immediately enveloped him into a fierce hug. She felt Remus shake with silent sobs, and she felt her own eyes fill up with tears.</p><p>“I’m sorry mum,” Remus gasped into her shoulder. “I’m sorry, please don’t be mad.”</p><p>“Shhhh baby, shhhh” Hope murmured. “You have nothing to be sorry for, it’s not your fault.”</p><p>As Hope held her son, absent-mindedly stroking chunks of soil through his hair with her dirty gloves, she came up with a plan. She was going to go to Scotland and she was going to punch Professor Dippet in his stupid, prejudice face.</p><p>***</p><p>Later that evening, when Remus was pretending to be asleep but secretly reading under his bedsheets, and Lyall was actually asleep with a copy of <em>The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy </em>open on his chest, Hope snuck into the library. She fumbled at her husbands desk, cursing him silently for magically sealing the drawers.</p><p>“I swear, it’s like you don’t want me to steal things out of your desk,” she muttered to herself.</p><p>In a fit of frustration, she slapped the word wood angrily, and it gave a tired <em>cough</em> before popping open. </p><p>After rummaging through the blueprints to a forgotten Tardis treehouse, she finally found what she was looking for. Cartography was one of Lyall's odd hobbies, and, true to his Ravenclaw roots, something he had quickly become an expert on. One night a long, long time ago, Remus had asked his father to show him what Hogwarts looked like, and Lyall had made him a beautiful, intricate map.</p><p>Hope stroked the parchment, nostalgic for the days when Remus still believed in the light parts of magic. She ran a finger over a particularly large room, labeled "The Great Hall" in tiny, perfect cursive.</p><p>"Ever the swot," she muttered to herself, smiling. </p><p>And so, Hope stole (though really, she had every intention of giving it back, so it was really more like borrowing) the map. She wrote a hasty note to Lyall (<em>Gone to Scotland, be back in a jiffy). </em></p><p>She took the bus to Glasgow, and anxiously waited for the 7:43 train. When it finally arrived, she was the only passenger to get on the ancient beast of a train. A peculiar old man in a funny purple uniform inspected her ticket.</p><p>"Yer sure?" he asked her, and she nodded. The old man grunted, waving her on board. She smiled at him politely, and took a seat by the window. </p><p>The train was long, and the spring air bit through her threadbare coat. She privately through the compartment could do with a nice heating charm, but she figured the conductor was refraining from using magic in front of her because he suspected she was a muggle. </p><p><em>But honestly</em>, she thought to herself, <em>what unsuspecting muggle would willingly get on a train that looked like it was older than Queen Victoria? Let alone one that only made one stop in "Hogsmeade" and was operated by a man wearing a plum purple uniform</em>. The conductor must realize she knows about magic, or else believe her to be certifiably bonkers. Although, based on the look he gave her as she got on, it was probably the latter.</p><p>The train began to slow, and with an almighty <em>BANG! </em>finally came to a shuddering halt. Hope stood, calling a thank you towards the front of the car. The conductor turned around, eyeing her warily. </p><p>"Yer better be careful there," the conductor told her ominously. "Them ruins er su'pose to be haunted."</p><p>Hope grinned cheekily at him. "I'm hoping you're right."</p><p>The old man shook his head and muttered something nondescript about "muggles" and "Mumbledoors."</p><p>Stepping carefully off the train, she found herself on a dilapidated platform. There were no signs or attendants, and with nothing to go off of but intuition and a hand drawn map, she strode off the platform towards what looked like a dilapidated castle. </p><p>When she arrived at the entrance to the ruins, there was a chipped sign that read “Do not enter". Rolling her eyes, she pushed open the heavy wooden doors and walked into a dusty entrance hall. The hall may have once been grand, but as it was now, filled with torn paintings and incomplete suits of armor, it seemed rather uninhabitable and probably not a great place for a school.</p><p>Hope pulled the map out of her bag and attempted to orient herself. She realized there definitely had to be magic in the air. Not because she could actually <em>tell, </em>but because unless Hogwarts had mysteriously relocated after nearly a millennia, there had to be some spell or charm hiding the real castle.</p><p>And if there was magic to hide a building, then the map was probably useless. At least, until she could figure out how to break a magical spell she couldn’t detect. She swore loudly, cursing her stupidity and impulsivity.</p><p>She glanced around her feet for a moment before stooping over to snatch a rusty sword from a suit of armor. <em>Well</em>, she thought ruefully, <em>I might not be able to see or hear them, but the sure as hell are going to hear me. </em>With a bellowing cry, she lifted the sword high in the air and started banging it on every available stone surface. </p><p>She stumbled around the peculiar ruins, banging the sword and yelling like a maniac, for the better part of an hour. After tripping over a large piece of rubble for what felt like the millionth time, she felt her temper boil over. She threw the sword to the ground, where it clattered impressively for a few moments.</p><p>She was running out of patience, and more importantly, confidence. She spun madly about in the circle, but stopped dead as a beam of sunlight caught her eye. She thought something seemed off about it—it seemed to shimmer too brightly and, if she was not mistaken, gave off an air of distinct amusement. She glared at it for another moment, daring it to be something other than a beam of peculiar sunlight. When it did nothing, she let out a huff of disappointment and stalked off in the opposite direction.</p><p>"Oi!" she shouted childishly. "Oi! I know you're there! Professor? Er, Professor...oh for the love of Merlin's saggy bollocks what the fuck is his name. Professor...er..."</p><p>"Dumbledore," an amused voice came from behind her.</p><p>Hope spun around wildly, and as she did, the dilapidated ruins sparkled, melting away into a grandiose entrance hall. She looked around dumbly for a moment, captivated by the magically repaired moving portraits and pristine suits of armor.</p><p>"Er..." she mumbled.</p><p>"But," Dumbledore said politely, "you may of course call me Albus. I must say, your stamina is envious. I kept trying to get your attention, but you were rather immersed in your own...er...rather loud means of announcing your arrival."</p><p>"Right," Hope said, feeling what little confidence she had left wane. "Right, so I'm here because--"</p><p>Dumbledore held up a hand gently, his blue eyes twinkling behind his half-moon spectacles. "Forgive me for interrupting," he said. "But your voice must be very sore from all the shouting, and you should save it for your questions."</p><p>Hope felt herself pink slightly, but held Dumbledore's gaze. “My...my questions?"</p><p>"Yes," Dumbledore replied. "I believe you will appreciate the accommodations we have prepared for Remus, but I am sure you have your own thoughts and questions on how they may be improved."</p><p>"Are you...are you? Who are you? How have you made accommodations? Who? What?" Hope continued to open her mouth soundlessly, feeling foolish. </p><p>Dumbledore smiled at her kindly. "Ah, forgive me. The official announcement won't be in the <em>Daily Prophet </em>until end of term. I believe your husband may have mentioned the Headmaster of his own Hogwarts tenure. Professor Dippet?"</p><p>Hope nodded. "Yes," she replied. "Yes, he's the one who revoked Remus’ acceptance, the old, simpering ars-. Er. I mean, he's the one I want to speak with, if I may."</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. "You may of course have an audience with Professor Dippet, but I believe I am actually the person who may best help you. Professor Dippet, though an admirable magical educator even in his later years, has made the decision to retire. This is his last term as Headmaster."<br/> <br/> "Oh." Hope said, no less confused. "So that means...?"</p><p>"That starting next year, I will take over as Headmaster," Dumbledore said, humbly. </p><p>Hope shook her head. "I still don't fully understand," she said. “Even if you are the new Headmaster, how have you already made accommodations? Remus, if his acceptance is reinstated, wouldn’t even be attending until two years from now.</p><p>“You are absolutely correct,” Dumbledore smiled warmly at her. “But I felt that it was important for plans to be drawn earlier rather than later.”</p><p>Hope nodded, returning Dumbledore’s smile with a small one of her own. “Thank you. I appreciate that very much,” she said. “But may I ask why?”</p><p>Dumbledore hummed a few bars of what sounded like a Bob Dylan song. "Times are changing, Mrs. Lupin, and not all for the better. I assume that Lyall keeps you abreast of current wizarding politics."</p><p>Hope's face darkened and she nodded. "Yes," she murmured.</p><p>She thought of the slowly building tension in the Ministry, of the stories Lyall told her about a man who hide his face and propagated hate to the Pureblood community. Hope studied Dumbledore for a moment, deciding if he really was sincere about helping Remus. He met her gaze politely, and Hope was surprised to find his eyes were not filled with pity or sadness, but kindness.</p><p>"That's why I felt...so strongly,” she said slowly. “About Remus getting a magical education. It would be hard enough for him as it is, being half and half. But now…he needs to know there's something <em>good</em> to be found in magic. Something that isn't pain or loneliness or hate," Hope paused, bringing her hands to her face. </p><p>"Lyall agrees, but he struggles so much. Magic used to be so black and white to him, but now. It's more complicated. He's seen what dark magic, what magic inspired by hate can do to innocent people."</p><p>Dumbledore approached her and placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. "Many wizards believe that magic is might. Magic is power. Magic is what makes wizards more than muggles, just as man once thought the opposable thumb was what made man more than beast."</p><p>Dumbledore drew his wand, pinching it delicately between his thumb and forefinger. "But what many wizards fail to see is that magic without humanity is not magic at all. It is all-consuming energy that cannot be controlled. And if left unchecked, it will destroy everyone, regardless of blood or status."</p><p>Hope let her hands drop from her face, eyes watery. Dumbledore offered her a handkerchief with the initials APWBD embroidered smartly in one corner. She accepted it gratefully.</p><p>“However,” Dumbledore continued, “as acting Headmaster I will be able to ensure that Remus has the accommodations he needs to attend Hogwarts in two years time."</p><p>Hope smiled, heart filling with tentative hope for this first time in years.</p><p>***</p><p>Hope returned home very late that night. She flung aside a rusty soup can, grateful to have been saved the long train journey home, but feeling slightly nauseous nonetheless. She entered the house as quietly as she could, and was startled when the kitchen light flicked on to reveal Lyall.</p><p>“Oh,” she said, a little breathless. “Hello love.”</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow and walked around the kitchen table towards her. “Hello Howell,” he said gently, wrapping warm hands around her waist.</p><p>Hope leaned into her husbands embrace, running a hand through his greying hair. Lyall smiled down at her, but his eyes were filled with confusion and concern. “Tell me," Lyall continued. "If I were to mysteriously disappear for a day, leaving behind naught but a note saying ‘Gone to Scotland, back in a jiffy’ what exactly would you think?” </p><p>“Honestly, I’d probably have thought you were slightly off in the head.”</p><p>“Mmm” Lyall hummed, bending down to kiss her cheek. “And why would that be, dear?”</p><p>“Well,” Hope replied lightly. “For starters, we live in Scotland.”</p><p>“Aye, we do,” Lyall said. “And so that begs the question, how can you have gone to a place if you were already there?”</p><p>Hope chuckled, rubbing her cheek against Lyall’s chest. “It was very late,” she said, realizing how tired she was. “Or early, I suppose. And I thought I was being terribly clever. But I suppose I’m no Ravenclaw perfect, eh?”</p><p>Hope felt Lyall chuckle. "Nah, you're such a Gryffindor. Brave and bold and stubborn."</p><p>Hope snapped her head up, glaring playfully at her husband. "Don't forget sneaky," she added.</p><p>“You have better not gone and lost my map now, Hope Howell,” Lyall said, voice low, but his eyes were dancing with amusement. "Though what you did with it for a whole day is still beyond me."</p><p>“I went to Hogwarts,” she confessed.</p><p>Lyall pulled back, concerned eyes searching her face. “How the bloody hell did you manage that?” he asked, impressed.</p><p>“Oh, you know. Just a bus, a train and an hour of me banging around an abandoned castle. Eventually the Headmaster found me,” she replied.</p><p>Lyall was staring at her, flabbergasted. Hope felt her cheeks pink and she found herself rambling through snippets of the day.</p><p>“Yes Headmaster Dumbledore has fixed it all rather nicely. Remus’ acceptance has been reinstated, Albus said he’d drop by next year and explain to Remus in person. Special circumstances given the situation, so please don’t ruin the surprise. Close your mouth, love, you’ll catch flies.”</p><p>Lyall continued to gape at her. “Albus?” he said weakly.</p><p>Hope shrugged, and patted his cheek affectionately. “Yes love, Albus. Lovely man, I promised him I’d make my special honey cake for him. He’s got quite the sweet tooth, you know. Now come to bed, I’m absolutely knackered.”</p><p>Hope made her way towards the stairs, and turned around when she didn’t feel Lyall following her. “Lyall? Love?”</p><p>He was leaning against the countertop, looking at her in absolute awe. “Yes, coming. Just processing the fact you managed to make your way to an unplottable school in the Highlands of Scotland, with no wand, no invitation and an amateur map.”</p><p>“Well,” she said reasonably, “it’s a very good map. We should give it to Remus, it’ll give him a bit of an edge over the other first years. That castle is a monstrosity, honestly who thought moving staircases was a smart choice?”</p>
