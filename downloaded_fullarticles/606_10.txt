He had been tossing and turning for hours now.</p><p>He had gone to check on Kali and Pan twice. He had made tea, burnt his tongue on the first sip and poured the rest of it down the drain. His skin felt uncomfortably tight, stretching tautly over muscle and bone. His heart beat erratically, the rush of blood deafening in his ears. The restlessness had come out of nowhere, uncompelled and unexpected but impossible to ignore.</p><p>Remus glanced out of the window at the usual suspect, but not even the moon could be blamed for this sudden urge to run away and not look back. It hung above the New York City skyline, a waxing crescent visible even though the stars were not.</p><p>But if the moon was not the cause, what was?</p><p>Remus shook off the shiver that ran up his spine as some deep-seated instinct warned him that something was oh so very wrong.</p><p>He had called Kali’s step-grandfather in Hawaii, but everyone was fine there. He had checked in with her maternal grandfather in Israel, her great-grandmother in Norway, her great-aunt in Argentina. He had even rung his father in Wales. But other than some complaints about the early wake-up, there was nothing amiss to report.</p><p>All was well.</p><p>So why did Remus feel like he was about to jump out of his skin?</p><p>His mind drifted for a moment towards Kali’s father—a man with whom Remus had been closer than any other. Remus hadn’t seen him in nearly twelve years, but that didn’t change the fact that there had been a time when he’d known that man better than he’d known himself. Or so he’d thought. That connection had withered and died a long time ago, and now an entire ocean lay between them.</p><p>It wasn’t possible.</p><p>Remus shook off the dread that formed in the pit of his stomach when a small voice asked a question he would have preferred to ignore: what if it was possible? He buried the thought, beating it down as best as he could—because if Kali’s father was the cause of this unease, it would mean that something terrible was coming, something that would sweep into Remus’s and Kali’s lives and send everything into shambles.</p><p>Remus let out a deep exhale and rubbed at the knot between his shoulders. He took a step towards Kali’s room to check on her once more but stopped himself. The last thing he wanted was to wake her and infect her with his worrying. He headed to his bedroom instead and got back into bed, hoping his mind would slow down long enough for him to get some sleep.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>He woke up to the sound of loud banging.</p><p>His sleep-deprived mind struggled to free itself from the pleasant fog of unconsciousness, but a loud crash and Kali shouting his name had him vaulting out of bed. He grabbed his wand from the nightstand and sprinted into the living room before his brain had the chance to process what was going on.</p><p>Eight men stood in the large, open living room, their wands pointed at Remus, Kali, and Pan. The Daemon—currently a big, black dog—stood between Kali and the men, his back legs tensed, ready to lunge. Kali, for her part, didn’t move a muscle—standing wandless, wearing flowery pyjamas, and at least half a head shorter than the shortest man in the room. The remains of the front door sat in a pile of splinters at her feet. Blood trickled down her cheek where one of the pieces had hit her.</p><p>Remus’s grip tightened on his wand, and his jaw clenched, but he did not cast the first spell because something caught his eye before he could. The glowing city lights seeped into the room through the floor-to-ceiling windows, reflecting off of the gold blazons of the Ministry of Magic and revealing that the intruders wore the scarlet robes of British Aurors.</p><p>The biggest of the men took a step forward. He towered over his companions and made for a frightening sight, his thick black beard doing little to conceal the scars that covered his face. In a voice that could move mountains, he barked, “Where is Sirius Black?”</p><p>Remus flinched upon hearing <em> his </em> name.</p><p>He struggled to lower his wand, recognising the advantage of appearing non-threatening even as every instinct screamed at him to remain on guard. With a jerk, he finally managed to point his wand away from the intruders, but his grip did not lessen as he answered, “In a prison cell in Azkaban.”</p><p>“He escaped earlier today,” said a smaller man whose glasses were slightly askew. “We suspect you may be harbouring him.”</p><p>The world seemed to freeze as Remus’s mind whirred, his reality slowly slipping away from him as the words sank in. <em> It c an ’t be . </em></p><p>“Search the place,” the big man bellowed, and his subordinates jumped to it, marching through the flat like soldiers in a captured enemy camp, ripping books from shelves, tearing apart couch cushions, and tipping out the contents of drawers and cupboards.</p><p>“That isn’t possible,” Remus said quietly, watching in a haze as an Auror checked the content of an old music box, one too small for a mouse to hide in, let alone a grown man. Upon figuring that out for himself, the Auror unceremoniously threw the trinket over his shoulder. As the box crashed against the floor, Remus turned back to the man in charge. “No one can escape from Azkaban, not even him.”</p><p>“Well, he managed it somehow,” the man who’d thrown the music box snapped. Kali slipped her cold hand into Remus’s as Pan growled too softly for the Aurors to hear. “Now, where is he?”</p><p>“Not here,” said Remus, struggling to keep the growl out of his own voice as he squeezed Kali’s hand.</p><p>The man with the glasses took a step forward, inadvertently kicking the music box beneath the couch as another set of Aurors tipped the piece of furniture over. He didn’t notice, though, as he held eye contact with Remus and said in a voice of forced calm and pacification, “By lying to us you’re perverting the course of justice and committing a serious offence for which the penalty is heavy. We know you’re hiding him, so you need to cooperate.”</p><p>“You don’t know that, though,” said Remus, ignoring the crashing and banging, the ripping and stomping, and focusing instead on that little man, who played at being non-threatening despite his firm grip on his wand. “You only suspect it; you have no proof.”</p><p>“She’s all the proof we need,” said the music box man, jabbing his wand in Kali’s direction. Pan’s growl was now plainly audible, but the men ignored it. “She’s the closest family he has left. If he’s going anywhere, he’s coming here.”</p><p>“To the first place he knew you would look?” asked Remus. “Sirius Black is many things, but he is not without intelligence. He won’t come here. And even if he did, I can’t imagine Azkaban left him in the best of shape. Yet you think that he somehow managed to make the trip from there to here, not only beating you here but doing it without being spotted? If so, your investigative work needs improving.”</p><p>“He escaped, didn’t he?” the rude man sneered. “Who knows what he’s capable of?”</p><p>“He. Is. Not. Here.” Remus slowly forced the words out past the pit of anger in his stomach, and he hid a flinch as a loud crash sounded behind him.</p><p>This was an intimidation tactic, nothing more.</p><p>Aurors were an elite, highly-trained team. They had an arsenal of spells to help them track down clues and suspects; they didn’t need to tear this place apart, which meant that they were only doing it to prove that they could, to leave their mark and scare Remus into cooperating. They had nothing on him and no idea where to find Sirius.</p><p>The bespectacled man took another step forward. “Sirius Black is a dangerous criminal. He has murdered thirteen people, and he’ll stop at nothing to achieve his goals, going so far as to sacrifice anything and anyone.” At that, his gaze dropped pointedly to Kali before flicking back to Remus. Remus tugged Kali closer to him, and the little man smiled. “He’ll hurt her, Mr Lupin, without thinking twice. I know you don’t want that. Just tell us where he is, and we can keep her safe.”</p><p>Remus dared to spare a glance at Kali in her pink pyjamas with her sleep-tousled curls, and he tried to convince himself that Sirius wouldn’t hurt her—tried and failed. What happened twelve years had made it abundantly clear that Sirius Black was nothing more than a stranger and a madman; he was capable of anything at all.</p><p>But the same—or at least part of it—could be said of the Aurors, too.</p><p>Remus eyed the men ransacking his home. These people had wounded his goddaughter, pointed their wands at her, and threatened him with charges of obstruction of justice, all without a shred of proof that Sirius was here. They had no grounds on which to arrest Remus—not that that fact had been enough to stop them in the past. But the war was long over now, and the ruthless and extreme methods that had been employed to fight back Voldemort’s followers were no longer in use.</p><p>Remus could smell the Aurors’ fear, though, clinging to them like cheap perfume. Their eyes were wide, and sweat dripped down their faces. They were scared—scared that Sirius’s escape augured a new war—and when people were afraid, they seldom thought clearly or acted rationally.</p><p>The wands pointed at Remus’s heart shook, and Kali’s grip on his hand tightened.</p><p>“I would like for you to leave,” said Remus, keeping his voice as calm and even as he could manage but stating his claim loud enough that every Auror stopped what they were doing.</p><p>The small Auror sighed and dropped his head, giving it a slow, disappointed shake. “I’m afraid that can’t happen, Mr Lupin. Catching Sirius Black is the Ministry's number one priority. If you don’t cooperate, we’ll be forced to take you in.”</p><p>The Aurors all shifted forwards, forming a menacing circle around Remus, Kali, and Pan. The Daemon’s fur stood on end, adding a few of centimetres to his size, and his hackles rose, showing off pearly-white fangs. The men closest to him lowered their wands away from Remus, pointing them at the dog instead, and Kali jerked in that direction, but Remus held her firm.</p><p>He straightened, pushing his shoulders back and raising his chin as he levelled the Aurors with a steady stare he’d perfected during his years as a prefect and said, “You’re a long way from home and have no jurisdiction here. Any action you wish to see through must first be approved by the Magical Congress of the United States of America—unless you’re willing to cause an international incident. Until you get the proper approval, you may leave and not come back.”</p><p>The Aurors’ advance faltered at his tone—that of a parent scolding an unruly child—and at his words—those of a man who had spent too long living with a defence attorney and who was keenly aware of his rights.</p><p>When the bespectacled Auror opened his mouth to speak, Remus added, “You may also expect that we will be putting in a complaint with the British Auror Division for damages, injuries, and plain rudeness. Now if you would please clear out, I would like to go back to bed.”</p><p>The younger Aurors, the ones who had so enthusiastically combed through the flat, fidgeted, lowering their wands and fiddling with their uniforms, while the more experienced of the lot cast nervous glances towards their superiors, awaiting orders.</p><p>The big, bearded man and the little, bespectacled one shared a look, and the latter gave a small shake of his head, which caused the former to press his lips together in a firm line as his knuckles turned white from his grip on his wand, but there was nothing he could do. With a deep sigh, the man’s posture drooped like a deflating balloon. His colleagues followed suit as he lowered his wand, but many still wore angry scowls that barely hid the panic in their eyes.</p><p>“We will contact you again,” said the big man, his tone clipped and gruff. “Have a good night.”</p><p>He spun on his heels, his robes swirling around him, and strode towards the entrance, stomping his boots hard enough to leave scuff marks on the marble floor. His team followed him out, shuffling awkwardly around the broken door. Remus stared after them, his mind a blur of white noise.</p><p>Feeling as though his bones had turned to lead, he raised his wand and, with a flick of his wrist, fixed the door and set it back on its hinges. The living room was still in shambles, though, with books and memorabilia littering the floor, drawers removed from the cabinets, and furniture overturned. The Aurors had made a right mess of the place without so much as probable cause or even an apology.</p><p>The fiery pit in Remus’s belly burned bright once more.</p><p>Kali shifted beside him and tried to extricate her hand from his, one centimetre at a time, as delicately and discreetly as she could manage. In his daze, Remus’s grip had tightened around her fingers, squeezing them far too tightly. He released her hand with a soft apology, his gaze catching once again on the cut on her cheek. It wasn’t deep—barely more than a scratch—but it was too close to her eye for comfort. He cast a healing charm and cleared away the trail of blood, barely finishing the job before his hand started shaking.</p><p>“I’m alright,” he said at the sight of Kali’s widening eyes. He squeezed his hand into a fist until the tremor subsided and pulled his goddaughter into a hug so that she wouldn’t notice his own wide eyes and paling skin.</p><p>The restlessness that had been plaguing him since nightfall had been caused by Sirius after all. Sirius had found a way out. He’d escaped from an inescapable prison, and in doing so, he had put Kali at risk.</p><p>Remus’s jaw clenched, and his hold on Kali tightened. After what Sirius Black had done to them, how dare he barge into their lives again? Remus hoped the murderous bastard got himself caught before he could do any more damage; before he could ruin Kali’s life like he had destroyed his own.</p><p>The flash of bright yellow eyes reflecting the city lights caught Remus’s attention. He looked up to find Pandoran staring at him in that unnerving way of his. The Daemon didn’t move a muscle—didn’t even blink—as he scrutinised Remus.</p><p>So long as no one looked too closely, Pan could pass for a regular dog—or whatever other animal he chose to take the shape of—but one look at those eyes was enough to tell anyone with any sense that he was no ordinary beast. His reptilian gaze was the only aspect of his appearance that he could not change at will, and those eyes shone with an intelligence that rivalled any human’s.</p><p>The shape-shifter had settled himself into Remus and Kali’s lives years ago, but Remus had yet to get used to him and often forgot to take him into account. Like now, for instance. Kali and Pan shared a telepathic bond, what one saw, so did the other, which meant that Remus’s attempt to hide the emotional turmoil written all over his face from his goddaughter was futile.</p><p>With one final squeeze, Remus stepped away from Kali. He gave her a tight smile but could not look her in the eye as he went to make tea, knowing full well that none of them would be going back to bed tonight. Kali followed him into the kitchen and sat at the counter, but neither of them spoke until the tea was poured.</p><p>Kali tried to catch Remus’s eye as he handed her a steaming mug, but he deftly avoided it as he busied himself with the milk and sugar. “What do you think we should do?”</p><p>“About what, sweetheart?” he asked, nonchalant even as his stomach twisted and his heart pounded.</p><p>“About Dad.”</p><p>His hands paused over his teacup. Ever since Sirius had gotten himself locked up when Kali was only a year old, Remus had tried to convince her to stop calling that madman ‘Dad.’ Sirius was undeserving of the title, and Kali did not need the weight of being related to such a man on her shoulders. But she was stubborn and still blindly loyal to a man she could barely remember.</p><p>“Nothing,” said Remus, flattening his palms on the surface of the countertop and staring into his teacup.</p><p>“We can’t just leave him.”</p><p>Remus shook his head, but he couldn’t look at her. “There’s nothing we can do for him.”</p><p>“Not if we don’t try, there isn’t.”</p><p>A sharp response bit into Remus’s tongue, but he held it back. Touchy subject or not, he would not snap at her. There were few things that he and Kali argued about, but Sirius Black was one of them. The mere thought of him was too painful for Remus to bear; it gripped at his insides, yanking and crushing until he felt too ill to move. Yet, on the rare occasions when the madman did come up in conversation, Kali always insisted on defending him. It had caused more than one shouting match to ensue between the pair.</p><p>“He killed people, Kali,” Remus said softly, as though that alone might diffuse the oncoming argument.</p><p>“You don’t know that,” she answered, and he sighed.</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“Were you there?”</p><p>“There were witnesses.”</p><p>“Muggle witnesses,” she said. “Eyewitness accounts aren’t reliable at the best of times. What someone sees and what they remember are not the same thing. Memory accuracy is influenced by various factors, including stress, panic, and world view. When Muggles witness magic, their minds distort what they see because they don’t understand it. You cannot condemn a man based solely on what other people thought they saw.”</p><p>Remus held his breath before letting it out in a long exhale. It was a capricious and spiteful force of nature that had allowed for the articulacy and intelligence of both Asherah Morrigan and Sirius Black to exist together in a single human being.</p><p>“He was Lily and James’s Secret Keeper. He was the only one who could have sold them out.”</p><p>“Gran always says that the Fidelius Charm isn’t perfect; that’s why she never uses it to protect her clients before their trials.”</p><p>Freyja Morrigan was one of the best defence attorneys in the wizarding community; there was no denying that. But her job had put her into contact with more unseemly witches and wizards than anyone should be comfortable knowing. Remus didn’t question that if there were a way past the Fidelius Charm—no doubt involving dark magic—Freyja would know it.</p><p>“Fortunately for us, Voldemort didn’t know half of the things your grandmother does.”</p><p>“Which doesn’t mean he didn’t know how to get past the Fidelius Charm without the help of the Secret Keeper.”</p><p>Remus rubbed the bridge of his nose. His tea sat in front of him, forgotten. “If Sirius wasn’t in league with Voldemort, why did he kill Peter and all of those Muggles?”</p><p>Her gaze slowly dropped to her hands, and she tugged on her colourful string bracelets. “It could have been an accident.”</p><p>“He laughed afterwards.” Remus had arrived at the scene in time to see two Aurors gripping Sirius as they had Apparated him away. The sound of Sirius’s laughter had echoed down the ruined street where the bodies of his victims had yet to be recovered. “He killed all of those people, and he laughed. He was still laughing when the Aurors took him away.”</p><p>“Laughing can be an adverse reaction to stress.”</p><p>“Sweetheart, all you’ve got are hypotheticals.” He finally dared to glance up at her and the stubborn pout that she wore. “I don’t understand how you can trust him. You don’t even know him.”</p><p>Her gaze left her bracelets and rose to meet his. “I don’t need to trust him. I trust you, and I trust that even back when you were at school, you were smart enough to love the right people.”</p><p>He shook his head quickly. He did not want to get into his feelings, past or present, for Sirius Black. “I’ve made mistakes. Trusting him was one of them.”</p><p>“Mum trusted him too.”</p><p>Remus looked away and drank down a mouthful of tepid tea to avoid saying anything that he would later regret.</p><p>He owed a lot to Asherah Morrigan. She had been there for him when his entire world had fallen apart. She had kicked his arse back to health and happiness with all the bedside manner of an angry bear. She had welcomed him with open arms into her family, and she had given him a reason to get up in the morning. Now that reason sat on the other side of the kitchen island, glaring at him with grey eyes that were so like her father’s—filled with the same temper and bullheadedness that had always gotten Sirius into so much trouble.</p><p>“What would you have me do?” he asked weakly. He’d never been able to talk Sirius out of any of his mad schemes either.</p><p>Finally, a hint of uncertainty broke through Kali’s brashness. “We could go to the U.K. with Gran. She could get in touch with some of her contacts there.”</p><p>“And then what?” He might not be able to talk her out of this, but he could make her realise how futile it was to try to save a man who could not be saved. “Everyone knows he’s guilty. Not even your gran can convince them to help him.”</p><p>She looked down at her full cup of tea, lips pressed together in a pout heartbreaking enough that he wanted to take it all back.</p><p>“He at least deserves a trial,” she said, so softly he barely heard. “You might hate him, but you can’t deny that.”</p><p>He couldn’t argue with her—not if he didn’t want to see that hurt, reproachful look in her eyes that was worse than all of her shouting and snapping ever could be.</p><p>“Go get dressed. I’ll call Freyja.”</p><p>She didn't say anything more, didn't nod or smile at him for giving in, but she did do as she was told. Pan trailed after her, and Remus poured himself something stronger than tea.</p><p><em> Sirius Black ha s escaped from Azkaban </em> <em>.</em> The words played in his head like a cruel, taunting litany.</p><p>No one had ever escaped from Azkaban before, and for good reason: it was an impossible feat. The prison sat atop a small, rocky island in the middle of the North Sea. It was warded with more charms and curses than any other place in Europe, and guarded by the most dreaded creatures on the planet. It was a fortress. Yet, that man had somehow gotten out.</p><p>Remus dreaded to think what he might do with his newfound freedom.</p><p>With a weary sigh and a shake of his head, Remus headed to the study. The Aurors had gotten into here too, and books blanketed the floor, their spines cracked and their pages rumpled. It would only take a flick of his wand to set them all right, but even that small act felt like too much at the moment. Besides, a perverted sense of warmth washed over him from the fact that, for once, his surroundings looked as broken and dilapidated as he did.</p><p>Werewolves did not belong in high-end, luxury apartments in the middle of Manhattan. Remus, with his scars and threadbare clothes, was often given a wide berth by the building’s other tenants, and he found a stubborn sense of justification in that, so much so that he refused to let Freyja buy him any new clothes—or at least refused to wear what she bough him because she never listened. He didn’t deserve to belong here, and he would not lie and pretend that he did, no matter how much Freyja insisted that he was acting like a child.</p><p>He picked up the office phone and dialled Freyja’s number.</p><p>It rang through three times before she picked up, sounding snappish and ill-tempered. “You had better have a damn fine reason for calling me at this hour.”</p><p>“Sirius has escaped from Azkaban,” he said without preamble. Freyja did not appreciate small-talk at the best of times. “Aurors came by the flat a few minutes ago. They thought we might be hiding him.”</p><p>“Remus?” she said uncertainly, but who else would it be? “Is Kali alright?”</p><p>“She’s a little shaken.”</p><p>A short pause followed, after which she asked, “And yourself?”</p><p>“I’ll live,” he said shortly. “She wants to help him.”</p><p>“He is her father.”</p><p>“Barely.” He couldn’t stop the growl that crept into his voice. “After what he did to us, he doesn’t deserve our help.”</p><p>Freyja sighed through the receiver. “Give me ten minutes, and I’ll Floo over. We can discuss it then.”</p><p>She hung up without waiting for his agreement, and Remus downed the rest of his whiskey.</p><p>Kali was rummaging around in the fridge when he left the study. She must still have been upset with him because she didn’t acknowledge his presence as he walked through the living area to his bedroom. He almost stopped, but he didn’t know what to say. Her temper was such a delicate thing; he stood a better chance of making things worse than he did of making them better. So he ducked his head and said nothing as he shuffled away.</p><p>It was a cruel twist of fate that, out of all of the parental figures that Kali had had, it was Remus she was stuck with. Remus who was oh so underqualified for the role, who was little more than a monster in human skin. He had never imagined himself as a single parent—with his condition, he hadn’t planned on being a parent, full stop. But circumstances and untimely deaths had made him into her sole guardian, whether she liked it or not.</p><p>For his part, no matter his shortcomings, Remus wouldn’t give her up for the world, even if she did insist on loving a murderer.</p><p>Remus had barely finished getting dressed when he heard the roar of flames, followed by the sharp slap of stiletto heels on the stone floor. The flat’s Floo connection could only be used by a handful of people as neither Freyja nor Remus appreciated unexpected visitors. But even if that had not been the case, he would have recognised that purposeful march anywhere.</p><p>Remus left his room to find Freyja standing next to the fireplace, talking lowly with Kali.</p><p>She was a formidable-looking woman—statuesque and handsome, exuding poise and dignity in droves. She was sixty-eight but ageless, able to pass for someone twenty years younger due to a combination of magical longevity, excellent genes, and healthy living. Her dark eyes were insistent, perceptive, and capable of piercing your very soul. She was intimidating, to say the least.</p><p>Freyja did not smile at Remus as he approached. She did not move to hug him nor even shake his hand. A curt nod was all he got from her, and he expected nothing more. Freyja’s love had always been cold and distant, but it was still far more pleasant than her indifference which was glacial and unforgiving.</p><p>“I’ll schedule a trip to London in a few days,” she said without a word of greeting. “We’ll be able to do more for Siriusthere than we can here.”</p><p>“Kali, could you go to your room for a bit, please?” Remus asked, earning himself a glare.</p><p>Only very rarely had Kali been asked to leave the room to let the adults talk. Asherah’s philosophy had been that a child could not be expected to act like an adult if they were not treated like one. So Kali had been included in every conversation, in every debate and every argument. But this was one exchange that Remus felt Kali was better off not being a part of.</p><p>She didn’t argue, which was a surprise, but if she already had Freyja in her corner, then her presence wasn’t necessary, and she knew it. Remus made sure that Pan left with her, before focusing back on Freyja.</p><p>“We can’t go to London.”</p><p>“Why is that?” she asked. Her gaze travelled over her living room, taking in the disarray with a curl of her lip. She drew her wand and, in one fell swoop, set everything back in its place.</p><p>With a satisfied nod at her work, she sat on the leather couch and waved him towards the armchair across from her into which he dropped inelegantly as he said, “Because it will get her hopes up.”</p><p>“If we do nothing, she’ll never forgive us. She’s a bright girl. We will explain beforehand that the chances of a favourable result are slim, but even so, we will do everything within our power to ensure that Sirius at least gets a fair trial.”</p><p>Remus scoffed. There was that talk of a trial again.</p><p>The reason Sirius hadn’t gotten one in the first place was that the evidence against him was so plenty and so irrefutable that it would have been a waste of everyone's time. Even Albus Dumbledore, who was well-known for giving people second chances, had believed that Sirius was guilty beyond any and all reasonable doubt. The British Ministry of Magic wasn’t about to hold a trial now, nearly twelve years after the crime had been committed, and certainly not following the accused convict’s Houdini act out of Azkaban.</p><p>“Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing, Remus, even the guilty.”</p><p>Remus nodded stiffly. “Do you think he is—guilty, I mean?”</p><p>“Guilt is a matter of perspective.”</p><p>“Spoken like a true defence lawyer.” Remus almost smiled. “But that doesn’t answer the question.”</p><p>Freyja looked at him curiously, as a scientist might observe a bug, and didn’t answer straight away. Her gaze went to the city skyline as she mulled over the query. “I must say, I never quite believed that Sirius had it in him to betray James. Or you for that matter. He struck me as far too loyal.”</p><p>“But he did betray us. He sold James out to Voldemort, and he left me…” His voice caught, and he had to swallow hard to keep it steady. “He killed Peter and all of those Muggles. He deserves to be in Azkaban.”</p><p>Freyja regarded him, and only years of practice allowed him to not squirm under her appraisal. “Have you truly never considered the possibility that Sirius might be innocent?”</p><p>“He isn’t.”</p><p>“Such certainty from a man who dithered over what shape he wanted his bedroom pillows to be.”</p><p>Remus ignored the jab. “I suppose you also think that Voldemort used dark magic to break past the Fidelius Charm.”</p><p>“Of course not. That kind of magic takes months to set up; the Potters were only under the charm’s protection for a few days. No, I do agree with the general theory that it was the Secret Keeper who sold Lily and James out to Voldemort. My disagreement merely stems from the identity of said Secret Keeper.”</p><p>Remus watched Freyja warily, but she didn’t explain herself. “What do you mean?”</p><p>She leaned back into her seat and said dispassionately, “I feel that Peter Pettigrew makes for a far more probable suspect than Sirius does.”</p><p>Remus breathed in sharply and simply said, “No.”</p><p>“Is it really so unthinkable that Peter was the spy?”</p><p>“Peter’s dead,” he snapped. She raised one thin eyebrow at him but didn’t jinx him or curse him, which was an indication of how much she liked him.</p><p>“Never count someone as dead unless you have the body right in front of you,” she said evenly.</p><p>“This isn’t a T.V. show. People don’t die and come back for dramatic effect.” He fought to keep his voice calm. “No one could have survived that explosion.”</p><p>“Don’t you find it convenient that just enough of Peter was left behind to identify him?” she mused. “Odd, really, how the explosion was so violent that it tore every cell in his body apart but left that one finger completely intact.”</p><p>“Why do you want Peter to be guilty so badly?”</p><p>“Why would you rather it be Sirius?” she asked back.</p><p>Remus forced his jaw shut and looked away.</p><p>Sirius was guilty. He had to be. No matter what Freyja and Kali thought; no matter what Asherah and Leilani had felt. Their convictions could not change the facts. Remus had loved a killer. Sirius had fooled them all, but he'd fooled Remus the most. Remus had fallen for every single one of his lies and his manipulations; he’d turned a blind eye to all of the signs that Sirius was not the man he had pretended to be. That made him just as much to blame for the deaths of Lily, James, and Peter as Sirius was.</p><p>“Besides,” Freyja added, “the dead make for very convenient scapegoats.” She stood and smoothed out the creases in her pencil skirt. “I will get my affairs in order, and Kali and I will leave for London in four days. You are welcome to join us if you wish.”</p><p>He sighed and let his shoulders sag, rubbing his face as he asked, “How long will you be gone?”</p><p>Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad. If he got the flat to himself for a couple of weeks, he could finish his paper on how Lethifolds interact with Dementors and what the best countermeasures were against both creatures.</p><p>Freyja had other plans, though. “However long it takes.”</p><p>Remus’s head snapped up to look at her. “Kali has to be back at school in September.” He wouldn’t put it past Freyja to forget about something as trivial as her granddaughter’s education.</p><p>“I’m sure Hogwarts’ curriculum can keep her occupied for a year,” she said, heading towards her bedroom.</p><p>Remus leapt to his feet and vaulted over the couch into her path. “You’re taking her away from me?”</p><p>She looked at him impassively, not the least bit bothered by his sudden show of athleticism. “As I said: you’re welcome to join us. I believe Hogwarts is looking for a new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor—if you’re interested.”</p><p>She sidestepped around him, leaving him rooted to the spot.</p><p>Freyja might not be deliberately cruel to those whose company she enjoyed, but it had never stopped her from getting her way. Every. Single. Time. Just once, Remus would like to outmanoeuvre her, just to see how she would react. But he couldn’t risk it this time, not with Kali so involved.</p><p>He sighed and went to break the news to Kali, knowing he was in for one hell of a year.</p>
