    <p>Their train compartment is silent as it pulls onto platform 9 ¾. Ginny, Neville, and Luna had tried their best to keep up a conversation the whole ride from Hogwarts, but any time they’d tried to draw in Harry, Ron, or Hermione the three’s answers would be too forced or melancholy for comfort. Even Crookshanks was completely silent and still, curled up in Hermione’s lap and watching the rest of the compartment with a suspicious eye.</p><p>Hermione wished that she could do better but she couldn’t get her mind off of what had happened. Off of Draco and all the secrets she was keeping, off of the promises she had made and everything that had changed.</p><p>And then there was also everything that was going to happen now. What she was going to have to do, and how hard everything was going to be.</p><p>She had to help Harry with his search for the horcruxes, and she had to think everything through because there were logistics the boys would never even think of. Like where were they going to get food, and where were they going to hide out? How were they going to maintain a low profile, and manage to do everything they needed to without being found by Voldemort and his ilk?</p><p>She had to protect Draco, hiding everything she knew about him and nearly every memory of him from the past year. She had to <em>lie</em>, and keep on lying to everyone because this was something she couldn’t mess up. It was life or death, and she was determined to make sure it ended with life.</p><p>And her parents…</p><p>The train jerked to a stop, and their compartment sat still as they listened to the bustle of everyone else getting up and dragging their trunks out, the thud of doors opening and closing repeatedly, the call of voices outside as children were reunited with their families.</p><p>Luna was the first to move, standing and taking a quick step forward to lean over and wrap Ron in a hug. The boy seemed surprised for a moment, blinking over at Hermione, but then he caught on and awkwardly patted the girl on her back.</p><p>“Er… Thanks.” He squeaked out, a slight flush on his face blooming when she pulled back to smile sweetly at him. Then she stepped to the side and did the same to Hermione, careful not to squish the cat on her lap, and Hermione didn’t hesitate before wrapping her arms around the girl and burying her face in the younger girl’s hair, suddenly overwhelmed with the need to cry but trying her best not to.</p><p>Luna smelled like lemongrass, and her hair was silky soft to the touch. Her hug was surprisingly firm and comforting, and Hermione didn’t even mind that her bumble bee earrings were buzzing next to her ear.</p><p>Luna pulled back with a tender kiss to Hermione’s cheek that left the girl blinking away the pool of tears in her eyes, and they smiled at each other for a moment.</p><p>Harry came next, and the boy held on tightly through the duration of it, face pressed into her shoulder but Hermione could still see the tightness of his forehead, and could tell he was close to tears himself. Their hug lasted the longest, and when Luna pulled back she pressed a kiss to his cheek as well, just a bit longer than Hermione’s.</p><p>“Goodbye. I will see you at Fleur and Bills wedding.” She told them with a touch of confidence that they all needed in that moment. They murmured back the sentiment and off she went, dragging her trunk behind her. Neville stood next, rocking forward with his hands lifting as if going in for a hug as well, but he stopped himself in a clumsy jerk. He settled for just waving at them awkwardly and mumbling a quick goodbye before leaving as quickly as he could.</p><p>“Well,” Ginny huffed as she stood, looking out the window instead of at any of them, her shoulders just a bit too stiff and her casualness just a bit too forced, “Let’s get going then. It’s not like sitting here is going to actually put anything off.”</p><p>And so they all pulled down their trunks and made their way out, going over to where Mrs. Weasley was waiting for them. They all made sure to put on a happy face for the woman, pretending like everything in the world was fine.</p><p>“Hello dears, how did your tests go?” She asked, a farce of her usual brightness. “Good? That’s good. Oh, Harry,” She sighed when she focused on the boy, stepping forward to envelope him in a tight, comforting hug. “I’m so sorry about Dumbledore. I know I didn’t get to say so at the time, but I am. I know what he meant to you.” She says, and Harry soaks up the comfort like a dry sponge, eyes growing a bit damp.</p><p>“Hermione, where are your parents, dear?” The woman asked once she and Harry were done with their moment, and Hermione smiled reassuringly at her.</p><p>“At the muggle station, waiting with the car.” She said, and the woman nodded.</p><p>“Oh, that’s alright then. I suppose we should make our way out, then, and Ginny! Ginny, when we get home you <em>must </em>help me talk sense into Fleur about the cake.” She started, hurrying off toward the exit with Ginny on the expectation that the rest would follow.</p><p>They hesitated, though, sharing a solemn look.</p><p>“We’ll see each other at the end of July.” Hermione whispered, reaching out to grab each of their hands for a quick squeeze. The boys both nod, and off they go.</p><p>
  <em>It’ll be fine.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>“And you’ll never guess <em>who </em>got put in the papers the other day,” Her mother continued as they entered the house, her father puffing a bit behind them as he carried her trunk in, leaving them to go up the stairs to set in her room.</p><p>“Who?” Hermione asked as she released Crookshanks to reacquaint himself with the house.</p><p>“Benji Carmichael! You remember, the one who-“</p><p>“Who got chased into that shed fifth year by that dog, yeah. And they couldn’t find him-“</p><p>“For two days! Right! Well, he got in the papers because he started this thing to try and help people get over their fear of dogs, and he’s involved the local shelters and everything. He runs a group out of the church on fifth.” She exclaimed as they walked back to the kitchen, the older woman getting out the makings of tea.</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione blinked, trying her best to remember the boy. He’d been in the class down the hall from hers up until the dog incident, and then his parent’s had pulled him out because of how badly the attack had shaken him. She was pretty sure he had had a lisp. “Well, that’s good.”</p><p>“Yes, his parents are quite proud. Maggie says that she thinks it’s all just attention grabbing and that it’s a stupid idea. <em>I </em>told her that, of course, it was an incredibly meaningful thing for him to do with his trauma.” Her mother sniffed, getting out the package of Hermione’s favorite biscuits they always got when she was coming home. “And oh, speaking of Maggie, you’ll never guess what her girl’s got up to <em>now</em>. I swear, it makes a mother thankful to have a sweet child like you.” She huffed, and Hermione hid her guilt amazingly well.</p><p>After all their catching up was done for the day Hermione went up to her room, a smile on her face because she had missed her parents.</p><p>
  <em>She was going to miss her parents.</em>
</p><p>It was on this somber thought that she opened her bedroom door to find her room looking almost exactly like she left it. The same lace curtains hanging over her window, the same soft quilt laid over her crisp blue sheets. Ceiling high bookshelves stuffed full with books, with stragglers stacked carefully against the far war. Her desk covered with papers and with a mixture of pens and old quills in a cup on top, all of her pictures tacked to the wall. So much hadn’t changed.</p><p>What had changed was only two things: one was that there were new books from her parents laid out on her bed, and the other was that there was a squat, fat owl sitting at her window with a package.</p><p>“Hello.” Hermione greeted cautiously since she’d never seen the owl before, and the owl screeched harshly at her in answer, like it had gotten tired of waiting for her. She comes forward and accepts the package from the owl, promising to give it a treat in moment, doing the smart thing first and  checking everything over with a quick inspection spell before touching any of it.</p><p>The letter was opened first.</p><p>
  <em>Granger,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I know I’m not supposed to contact you, but I felt like I had to send you this. I found this in our searches of the books in the room. I hid it from you because after living around them my entire life I know a dark object when I see one, so I had to get the curses around it taken care of first. Everything is fine with it now.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Oh, and since this was risky enough, the owl won’t be coming back. Do as you like with him.</em>
</p><p>That was it, and Hermione didn’t need a signature to know who the letter was from. She’d have to be thick not to know from the prattish tone alone.</p><p>With a quick look to her new owl Hermione busied herself with opening the package it had brought her, finding a plain blue dragonhide bound, title-less book nestled in the paper. Wondering why he’d felt like risking so much just to send her the book, Hermione opens it curiously, only to drop it to the floor a moment later.</p><p>The owl ruffles its feathers a bit, distressed that it’s package was being so thoroughly mishandled, and Hermione ignores it as she quickly stoops down to pick it up, hands shaking as she reads the inside of the cover again.</p><p>
  <em>My Dearest Theodosia,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I will not publish this, because I did not do this for the world. I studied and tested and searched for you, my darling girl. I know how terrible it’s been for you, living with the trauma. And I refuse to use obliviate on you because I have seen how wrong it can go. How it can make you lose yourself as well as the terrible memories.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Use these spells, my beautiful girl. Make a new life and forget me. Forget everything that has pained you. I love you enough to give you a whole new life, should you choose it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I adore you, no matter your choice,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Papa</em>
</p><p>A part of her hissed that it might not be what she thought, but as she stumbled back to sit heavily on her bed she flipped through and came upon page after page of trials and tests of memory spells and potions. And finally, at the very end, a singular perfected memory wiping spell with a reversal spell attached.</p><p>Hermione stared at that spell for ages, even as the sun went down and her new owl began to impatiently hoot at her, her shaking fingers tracing over the long ago dried ink.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>“Mum, Dad?” Hermione interrupted as they sat on the couch watching a trivia show they were preparing to bicker over. The couple stopped and instantly turned to where their daughter stood nervously in the doorway, her tone of voice instantly concerning them.</p><p>“What is it, dear?” Her father asked worriedly, and Hermione averted her gaze and blinked rapidly to try and compose herself.</p><p>“I have to tell you something.” She whispered, moving to set between them when they patted the middle cushion of the couch in invitation. And then, taking a deep breath, she told them everything. She told them about the muggleborn prejudice in the wizarding world, about how there was a mad man on the loose set on killing every single one of them, leading an army who believed his word as law. A man who tortured and killed muggles and wizards alike if they opposed him or his views.</p><p>She told them about Harry, everything she could about Harry and how Voldemort wanted him dead because Harry was the only one who could defeat him. About the danger that put her in because she was his muggleborn best friend.</p><p>“Lord… Hermione!” Her mother breathed, on the verge of tears by the time she was done, “Why didn’t you tell us?”</p><p>“I didn’t want you to worry.” The girl whispered, falling into her mother’s embrace and holding on tight. “And… I was scared.”</p><p>“We’re scared too, love.” Her father whispered shakily, his hand petting her hair carefully. “We…”</p><p>“We need to leave.” Hermione said into the comfort of her mother’s chest. “We need to leave Britain before the war gets started for real, and before Voldemort can manage to gain any more power. It’s… It’s not safe here.” Her parents were silent for a long, heavy moment, communicating with one another over Hermione’s head with their eyes.</p><p>“Well,” Her mother sighed after a moment. “We’ve always talked about going to Australia.”</p><p>As her parents talked about the logistics Hermione kept her head down, hiding her resigned, dry eyes from her parents.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Apparently, luckily, there had been someone interested in buying the practice for a while, so that part of their lives was easy enough to handle. They had enough savings to abandon the house all together since it was fully paid off, that way they didn’t have to endanger the next people who would move into the house.</p><p>Then it was only a matter of packing what they needed and buying the plane tickets when they got to the airport.</p><p>The next two weeks passed in a hectic and frantic hurry to get everything done in time, and without sleep for the young witch, who spent all her nights sitting up in her room and practicing her new spell on her new owl. She felt bad for doing such a thing to the innocent creature, but she had to have it perfected as soon as possible and <em>know </em>that it would work.</p><p>Her parents had accepted the animal’s sudden appearance with no small amount of exasperation, but they didn’t have the heart to deny her anything at the moment. Her father had even named it Pippin, with a wistful look in Hermione’s direction as he remembered the simpler times.</p><p>She let him. It would make everything… Easier.</p><p>“Hermione, hurry up!” Her mother called up the stairs, the girl standing in her room for what she knew may very well be for the last time. Her books had been thoroughly ransacked, and her closet was now almost completely empty. But other than that everything was as it had always been, and it hurt so much more than Hermione had ever expected.</p><p>“Coming Mum!” She called down, gripping her wand tightly and lowering her head as she trudged down the stairs. Her parents sat facing away from her on the couch, their bags all packed in the entry way. They were worriedly watching the news with new eyes, knowing that Voldemort was behind the vicious attacks the news caster was talking about. Hermione stared at the backs of their heads and wished that she could say something to them, wished that she could tell them she loved them just one more time but…</p><p>She couldn’t see their faces when it happened.</p><p>“<em>Memoriae perditus.</em>” She cast, forcing her words to be crisp and clear as she pointed her wand at the back of their heads. They went limp a moment later, bodies sinking back into the couch and onto one another, and Hermione took a breath before doing the spell that would build up entirely new lives for them. Lives in which they had never had or had thought of having a daughter.</p><p>Once done, she straightened her back and moved over to Pippin, who sat watching her in his new cage.</p><p>“If anything happens to them, come find me.” She told the animal, who hooted at her in agreement. Hermione turned to leave, going to grab her suitcases and coming to a halt when she took in the sight of Crookshanks sitting imperiously on top of them.</p><p>She picked him up and cradled him close, walking away from the people who were no longer her parents. Not really.</p>
