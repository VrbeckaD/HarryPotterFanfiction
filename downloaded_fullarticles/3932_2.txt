"Some Muggle invention, is it?"</p><p>"My dear, you really must get out more." Hermione took it back and unwrapped it. "You write a note, like so." She demonstrated on the top page. "Then peel it off â€¦ and stick it wherever you want to leave an important message." </p><p>She stepped close and adhered her note to his robes, pausing there as she breathed in his scent. His arm circled her waist and he laid his cheek atop her head for a moment. Then, with a sobriety she found irresistible, he carefully peeled off the tiny note and read what she had written. His eyes began to sparkle. "Is this a warning, Mrs. Snape?" </p><p>She smirked. "A promise, Mr. Snape." </p><p>Without another word, he kissed her, scooped her in his arms and carried her up the stairs to bed. The note fluttered to the floor, temporarily forgotten. </p><p>In due course, they used up the rest of the sticky notes on mundanities like market lists, baby names, and potion ingredients. But this first note they kept between them, passing it back and forth for many years.</p><p>-o0o-</p></div>
