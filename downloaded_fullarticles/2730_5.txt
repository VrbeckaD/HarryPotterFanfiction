  <em>“This tale is not one of servants, nor is it a tale of the masters who command them, and it is not a telling of saints either…”</em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>England, 1997</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Lily sat out on the steps of the Riddle manor in the July heat, staring forward with a sigh and contemplating the short-term and long-term future as she saw fit. Her seventeenth birthday was just on the horizon and with it her latest and greatest year of Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>Well, strike that, her last year of Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>Her seventh year, it amazed her that she hadn’t managed to drop out or be expelled yet but here she was with her books already purchased, her summer homework done, and ready to be thrown back into the pit that was Wizard Lenin’s dystopic Hogwarts of the new regime.</p><p> </p><p>Well, dystopic was a harsh word, that was what Neville had called it before he’d disappeared off into the wilderness with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to presumably track down and hunt Wizard Lenin’s horcruxes. Well, at least, that’s what Wizard Lenin assumed they were doing, the trouble was that he, being a paranoid bastard, had laid numerous lethal traps along the way for anyone looking in that direction.</p><p> </p><p>Regulus Black had stumbled into one over a decade ago, Dumbledore himself only a year ago, and he fully expected the golden trio to do the same. Those who went hunting for Tom Riddle’s secrets were not long for this world.</p><p> </p><p>More, in the end, they would have to track down Wizard Trotsky as well as the missing in action Hindenburg, both of which were easier said than done.</p><p> </p><p>Which left Wizard Lenin free and able to do incorrigible things like get rid of the Hogwarts houses, Muggle Studies, and for whatever inexplicable reason that even Lily couldn’t quite understand make Severus Snape the headmaster.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t sure if that last was meant to punish Snape, the children, or both.</p><p> </p><p>However, as it was, Wizard Lenin was mostly distracted from ruling by the fact that, in his heart of hearts, Lily didn’t think he really wanted to be king. Oh, he liked the idea of it, he liked the hunt for power, but actually sitting up there on the throne and being forced to make decisions? Now that, was an entirely different story.</p><p> </p><p>Lily had yet to tell him this (as he certainly wouldn’t appreciate hearing it from her) but she expected this whole “ruling Britain” thing to last maybe a few years at most, with or without Neville’s interference.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, he’d given himself the timeline of five years with the resurrected Alexander the Great, who as they spoke was waging war and winning against MACUSA after having somehow managed to defeat and conquer magical Russia in winter. If MACUSA didn’t manage a miracle then it was all too likely that Iskander King of Conquerers would be knocking on Britain’s door with Wizard Lenin having only a few aurors to drive back his army of heroic servants.</p><p> </p><p>Now, Lily wasn’t going to say to Wizard Lenin’s face that she expected, if push came to shove, that Alexander the Great would conquer the Britains but…</p><p> </p><p>Out of the corner of her eye Lily spotted Ilya Einzburn and Rin Tosaka out in the walled, overgrown, garden of the Riddle estate. As usual, both were seated back to back and scanning their eyes about, searching for the traps of mages, dark vengeful wizards, or anything else that might come and tear their world apart.</p><p> </p><p>Neither was eleven yet, or close to being shipped off to either London’s Clock Tower run by the Mage’s Association or else Hogwarts, but after both had been relocated with only the blunt unsympathetic news that their parents were dead to England, they still seemed to believe it was safest to trust in each other.</p><p> </p><p>If they came close to trusting anyone else then, oddly enough, it was Wizard Lenin, Lily, and Gilgamesh just for having picked them up in the first place and not having done anything to them personally since. Wizard Lenin’s sycophants, rightly, were avoided at any and every cost.</p><p> </p><p>Except, and the thing was, Lily just had this nagging feeling that they were caught in the eye of a hurricane. It was peaceful now, for them, for Lily, even for Wizard Lenin but the politics of Britain, Alexander’s imminent invasion, and even the holy grail itself could be seen just on the edge of the horizon coming ever closer.</p><p> </p><p>And according to Wizard Lenin it would be a decade at least until the grail would make its reappearance in Fuyuki but…</p><p> </p><p>Lily’s head left as she saw glittering light form next to her and transform into the solid, golden, form of Gilgamesh. He was looking as beautiful yet fashion impaired as usual, the difference being that he almost seemed to fit into Wizarding Britain with his decked out golden robes and garishly red tunic beneath all of this. Wizards being what they were, Gilgamesh looked far more in place and stylish than Wizard Lenin with his more conservative and almost muggle garb that he wore on a day to day basis.</p><p> </p><p>However, as always, Gilgamesh had little time for Wizard Lenin’s insolent mongrel rubbish and made a show of either tolerating them or making an example of them for when their insolence crossed too many lines towards his magnificence. Both of the unfortunate LeStrange brothers had fallen victim to the latter after daring to question Gilgamesh’s relation to their lord and master.</p><p> </p><p>Lily sometimes thought that Gilgamesh had changed from when she first met him, he sometimes mentioned that himself, and then other times Lily would think he hadn’t changed in the slightest.</p><p> </p><p>However, there was no talk of that as he sat down beside her, eyeing her in some amusement as he asked, “And what is it, Lily, that has so fervently caught your interest?”</p><p> </p><p>He looked at her in a way Lily didn’t think he quite looked at anyone else, with a peculiarly soft sort of fondness. To tell the truth, Lily wasn’t entirely sure what she was to Gilgamesh or what Gilgamesh was to her. It wasn’t quite like Wizard Lenin, he hadn’t been there from the beginning and Lily wasn’t sure he’d be there at the end. Yet, all the same, he’d inserted himself into her life and didn’t seem inclined to leave it. He would suggest traveling to Babylon every now and then but not with any real strength and never without Lily heading there with him.</p><p> </p><p>As far as he seemed to be concerned, he and Lily really were man and wife with Wizard Lenin as his dubious and disapproving pest of a brother-in-law, which…</p><p> </p><p>Well, Lily even a year later still wasn’t quite sure what to make of that. Even if he still did, even a year later and in oddly mortal form or whatever, have fantastic abs.</p><p> </p><p>So, Lily just shrugged and blithely responded, “Hogwarts, Britain, the grail, the usual.”</p><p> </p><p>A golden eyebrow raised ever so slightly as he asked, “Now, why you should find the first two even worthy of your notice is entirely beyond me.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily just shrugged, not wanting to note that Gilgamesh probably had a point there, but not willing to argue fervently against it either, “Well, these are just the sort of things I have to think about. Hogwarts especially, you know, since September is almost upon us.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I remember,” Gilgamesh said, now with a rather dark and irate expression. Gilgamesh had not been a fan, last summer, when he’d realized that Lily would be abandoning him to Wizard Lenin’s company for six months while she went to hang around slavering teenage mortal mongrels (Gilgamesh’s words, not hers).</p><p> </p><p>She had honestly been mildly surprised that Gilgamesh had had the patience to last even six weeks before crashing Hogwarts in October much to the student population’s awe and terror of the king of hero’s magnificence.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I’m the one who has to go,” Lily pointed out, “And it’s not like I enjoy it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then why do it?” Gilgamesh asked in rather familiar annoyance and exasperation, the usual thing he asked whenever Hogwarts made any kind of appearance in a conversation, “You could be king of this hopeless nation, Lily, there is no reason for you to concern yourself with the expectations and amusements of mongrels.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily could, and probably should point out, that by Gilgamesh’s own confounded logic then he was the only king there could any be of any nation ever so Lily could hardly be a king herself but that was a tangent they didn’t need to go down. Besides, it didn’t really get to the crux of the argument which was Lily was certainly powerful enough to not have to go to Hogwarts. She could, theoretically, hang out with Wizard Lenin and the gang or else maybe even embark on some mystical quest with Gilgamesh.</p><p> </p><p>Gilgamesh was all for mystical quests, apparently having gone on quite a number of them back in the glory days of Babylon with Enkidu. Then, of course, his own infamous quest for immortality taken after Enkidu’s death.</p><p> </p><p>Still, like always, she couldn’t help but point out with a bit of a glum sigh, “I don’t know, it’s not like I really have anything better to do.”</p><p> </p><p>Tourism in the remnants of Babylon and modern war-torn Iraq did not count. She supposed there’d been that nagging undone thing in her mind, to search for Avalon and Arthur Pendragon’s grave, to see her again and the sword Excalibur where by legend they waited to be called upon again but…</p><p> </p><p>It had seemed invasive somehow, more, Lily sincerely doubted that Arthur Pendragon would ever want to see Lily again after what happened. Perhaps it was best to let Avalon and Arthur be, to await the day when Britain truly needed them again.</p><p> </p><p>He frowned as usual at that, “One should not partake of an action, Lily, solely because an acceptable alternative has yet to present itself.”</p><p> </p><p>Still, she wondered if that was how he had wound up with the past time of casually stealing the wives of his general and noblemen. Because until Enkidu had shown up he couldn’t think of anything better to do.</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, despite never having seen Gilgamesh in his nasty prime, she had the feeling that it was.</p><p> </p><p>“My acceptable alternative is sitting on a couch for a year and watching reruns of Star Trek,” Lily said, before with a shrug announcing, “I’ll give the holy grail war that much, it was very suitable alternative to attending Hogwarts.”</p><p> </p><p>Horrific, violent, and ultimately nearly ending the world, but it had still been leagues better than Potions with Snape.</p><p> </p><p>Gilgamesh barked out a laugh, a sharp rather amused thing and noted, “I suppose it certainly was that, farce that it was.”</p><p> </p><p>He then gazed out into the distance with her, frowning slightly, “Still, it was something of an opportunity lost.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t look at he as he said it, just stared forward with a curiously somber and solemn expression on his face, “Heroes across the ages, and yet even with seven pulled from five-thousand years of human history, two of them pretender kings, not a single one was Enkidu. I would have liked for you to have met Enkidu.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily wasn’t quite sure what to say to that, then again, she never knew what to make of Gilgamesh’s strange bouts of nostalgia where he would look back five thousand years to the day when Enkidu left the world. Sometimes, when he got like this, she would wonder just how deep and terrible his grief had been in Babylon when it had happened.</p><p> </p><p>That it had pushed him to the very ends of the earth…</p><p> </p><p>And Lily, even now, was not sure if that meant she would have wanted to meet Enkidu or not. Only knowing that, if he had been there, it would have somehow been a far different grail war.</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose there’s always next time,” Lily said, sounding distant even to herself, ignoring Gilgamesh’s amused laugh at being pulled in for a second round of the holy grail war. The one that there really was no use avoiding.</p><p> </p><p>Ten years, Wizard Lenin had predicted, ten years based on the calculation of the mages of the Mage’s Association, and then at twenty-six Lily would be in Fuyuki again facing only god knew what.</p><p> </p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by Gilgamesh leaning forward, brushing lips against hers with a surprising tenderness. As always, they tasted strangely of that divine golden light within him, the two-thirds of his soul that was anything but human…</p><p> </p><p>Lily blinked owlishly, watching as he leaned back with a self-satisfied smile, “But today, Lily, is next time.”</p><p> </p><p>And she smiled back, took his pale hand as he stood and offered it to her, and allowed him to pull her back into the Riddle manor and towards the guest room he had converted into his golden bed chamber with thoughts of anything but the holy grail.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, Lily probably should have realized, that the world was a multilayered place formed of more than one dimension. Uncle Death was from one, Lily was from another, and in some other world where in the third war the uncorrupted holy grail had been stolen and spirited away to Romania, a fourth holy grail war was about to take place between the Mage’s Association and the Romanian Yggdmillennia clan.</p><p> </p><p>Which, of course, as always, meant that some idiot had the gall to go and accidentally summon Lily as a servant.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>An incantation going back centuries, formed by the original three masters of the first holy grail war, Matou, Einzburn, and Tosaka in Fuyuki Japan. An incantation which their descendants had all but written in their blood, and yet, not a single descendent stood as a master in this room or any other.</p><p> </p><p>This was no longer their holy grail war.</p><p> </p><p>“Elements of silver and iron, foundation of stone and the archduke of pacts, the color bestowed is black.”</p><p> </p><p>Blood in a circle and pentagram upon the ground, silver light poured forth, the mana of both the mage and the holy grail itself, summoning forth from ages past and dimensions unknown with only the memories of a relic to aid the call.</p><p> </p><p>“A wall for descending winds, close the gates on the four sides, come forth from the crown, and follow the forked road leading to the kingdom.”</p><p> </p><p>A great wind rose in a still room as the four remaining Yggdmillennia masters summoned the last servants in the war that has now all but begun. The gate to time, space, and reality had been opened and the holy grail’s call unleashed out into the world as that final beacon of hope and destiny to all the warriors of the world.</p><p> </p><p>“Behold, my will creates your body, and your sword my destiny. If you heed the grail’s call and obey my will and reason, then answer me!”</p><p> </p><p>On each hand, the command seals engraved themselves in blood and light, the binding pact between master and servant.</p><p> </p><p>“I hereby swear that I shall be all the good in the world and that I shall defeat all evil in the world.”</p><p> </p><p>A flash of corresponding light, acceptance of their words and their pact, from each of the circles inscribed on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“Thou seventh heaven, clad in the great words of power, spring forth now, guardian of the scales!”</p><p> </p><p>And just like that they were there, each out of time and place yet still kneeling before their lords and masters, looking up with hooded eyes as they spoke in one voice, “In accordance with your summons, we have arrived. We are the servants of black. We declare our destinies to be one with Yggdmillennia, and thus, our swords are yours to wield as well.”</p><p> </p><p>Caules could almost feel his face twisting into one of joy, awe, and relief at the sight of his work, his success, in magecraft. For here was proof, recognition by the holy grail itself, that he was as much a mage as his sister and fit to participate in the war that Darnic has been planning for sixty years.</p><p> </p><p>Darnic Yggdmillenia, patriarch of the family since before Caules was even born, motioned to Vladimir Tepish, his own servant, seated upon the throne as the dark-eyed Romanian king, “My king, before you are the servants our masters of black have summoned. In other words, they are your subordinates.”</p><p> </p><p>The man seemed pleased, then stood, regal power in royal purple robes and addressed his fellow servants, “Those of you who have acknowledged the summons in search of the holy grail, your first task is claiming victory in the name of black faction.”</p><p> </p><p>Caules sweated, itched at his white stiff collar and avoided the temptation the adjust his glasses. Out of the corner of his eye, even as he stared at Darnic, he could see his sister in her wheelchair flushing, pleased with herself and her summoned servant. His uncle, Gordes, still grinned, now with a saber class servant to his name, strongest of all servant classes. And Celenike, as always, shifted and looked upon her own heroic servant with lust and greed in equal measure.</p><p> </p><p>“By summoning these servants, we Yggdmillennia have set foot upon a path to a battle from which we may never return,” Darnic reminded them all, as Caules had been reminded since before he could even remember, as one of the more talented mages of the Yggdmillennia clan.</p><p> </p><p>“However, when this great war is over,” he motioned towards them, every gesture as powerful as Caules had always remembered it, “Those who have persevered as masters will be rewarded with infinite glory! There is nothing to fear, we already have the almighty granter of wishes, we are in possession of the greater grail!”</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, within only a few moments, it got much less dramatic. The electric lights were turned back on, the room was a wash of white, blue, and gold with the marble, the servants stood and gathered in a half circle of sorts, and Caules was allowed to breathe a sigh of relief that this, at least, was done and over with.</p><p> </p><p>He adjusted his glasses finally, ignoring the way they slid up his nose from the sweat, and found himself looking over towards the servants. They must have noticed the change in atmosphere as well because that formal servant disposition was gone and what must be their true personalities were taking hold.</p><p> </p><p>Rider, an odd thin tiny thing with pink hair was practically dancing in place, and even though Caules could have sworn he was supposed to be a man, that, Celenike had planned to summon one of Charlemagne’s famed knights if not Charlemagne himself, Caules couldn’t help but see a tiny overjoyed little girl in armor and a cape.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, over the ages there had been countless women who had been rewritten as men or else were treated as men and saw themselves as men no matter their biological gender, but still…</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,” Rider cried out in excitement, “May I have your attention please.”<br/>
</p><p>Except, Caules couldn’t help but think it wasn’t so much a question as it was a demand. That Rider clearly was going to tell them whatever he or she wanted anyway. Rider didn’t seem to even notice the rather nonplussed reactions of both servants and masters.</p><p> </p><p>“Everyone who was just summoned should introduce themselves. I mean, we are a team for now,” Rider explained as he or she wriggled in place, “Oh, wait, I have a better idea. Why don’t we say our true names? It’ll be way more efficient!”</p><p> </p><p>If it was possible the other servants looked even more nonplussed than they had before.</p><p> </p><p>There was his sister’s summons, Archer, summoned by a preserved bow from ancient Greece and appeared as a tall olive-skinned man with long hair of a non-descript brown shade wearing ancient armor and tunic that you’d expect from, well, Greece. The only oddity that he could note was, that stick out from just where his tailbone was, was a long horse’s tail the same shade as his hair.</p><p> </p><p>Then there was the even taller, silver-haired Saber dressed in silver and black armor save for a rip down his chest showing an old glowing scar from some long-ago battle. Summoned by an ancient Scandinavian blade.</p><p> </p><p>Then there was his own servant, Berserker, summoned by an electric rod reputed to have been used by Doctor Frankenstein in his creation of his infamous and tragic monster, the mechanical homunculi. Yet… It was a red-headed girl, around his own age if not a year or so older than him, thin and lean and in the ordinary uniform you might expect of a girl enrolled in a magical academy. She was pale, paler than the rest by far, and her eyes a strange ominous green but otherwise…</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing about her, he thought, that would make him believe she was a patchwork monster.</p><p> </p><p>“Kay, then I’ll start!” pink-haired rider appeared to have taken their stupefied silence for agreement as he declared, with such enthusiasm that his pink braid bounced behind him, “You guys can call me Astolfo, I’m one of the twelve heroes of Charlemagne, and I’m a rider, nice to meet you!”</p><p> </p><p>Astolfo then dashed over to his sister’s summons with glee and a giggle, standing on his toes to peer up into his face even as the man took a step backward in alarm, “And you are?”</p><p> </p><p>The man glanced down toward his sister, meeting her eyes and watching as she gave a confident and solemn nod, and then looked back down towards Astolfo with a calmer and more amused smile, “Servant class, Archer, I am Chiron.”</p><p> </p><p>Chiron, yes, centaur and teacher to Achilles before the Trojan war. Caules supposed that explained the horse’s tail.</p><p> </p><p>He bowed slightly then frowned as Astolfo took the opportunity to take his hands and squeeze them in delight, “Hello Chiron!”</p><p> </p><p>Rider then spun in place, twirled more like it, and finally landed on Berserker who looked at the tiny man with a rather unimpressed and dubious expression. Crossing her arms and cocking her head as if that would get her to parse Astolfo better.</p><p>“Okay, your turn!”</p><p> </p><p>Berserker said nothing, for a moment, and then simply asked, “Do you have any idea just where you are and what you’ve agreed to?”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice it was… It was not what he’d expected, not only was it far too human, far too pleasant, there was something almost otherworldly inside of it. Raw power that he’d never expected another mage, even of Doctor Frankenstein’s level, to be able to capture.</p><p> </p><p>He looked at his hand, at the command seals as if they could tell him the answer, because he knew his own limits. He was not as powerful as his sister or his uncles, he… He hadn’t been able to summon a truly powerful servant, even with the aid of the homunculi used as batteries, because of that.</p><p> </p><p>“Um, well, yeah…” Astolfo said, expression falling even as with chagrin he rubbed at the back of his head, however Berserker apparently was not mollified and instead simply more incredulous.</p><p> </p><p>“This is a holy grail war,” Berserker said, sneering slightly on the name as if she was rather unimpressed, “In other, simpler, terms we are about to embark on a blood bath where all but one of us is going to die in the worst way imaginable for something that is basically the nuclear bomb of magic.”</p><p> </p><p>That was… not really how Caules would describe the grail. He swallowed, felt himself pale as he watched them, mouth opening to say something or anything to contradict his own servant.</p><p> </p><p>“But… We’re on the same team,” Astolfo pointed out but this just seemed to irritate Berserker further. She moved forward, flinging her hands dramatically in the air as she ranted.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve clearly never been in a grail war before,” she said, then motioned towards herself in a rather grandiose gesture, “As a veteran I can tell you, no matter what they say, or you think, there’s no such thing as same team in a grail war. Even between servant and master there’s not really such a thing as a same team. Give them half a chance, and I’m sure one of them will stab you in the back at the first opportunity. Or, in your case…”</p><p> </p><p>She trailed off, glancing towards Celenike, whose deviant expectations of her servant were all but written on her face. Even though they were on the same team, even though she was his relative, Caules couldn’t help but shudder at what Berserker was implying.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, her attention turned to Caules, her master. It was… He hadn’t expected her, him, the servant to look at him like that. He didn’t know what he had expected but it wasn’t eyes like hers, too sharp and too knowing and too something, “And to think I’ve downgraded from that sadistic dog Kirei Kotomine to something like you.”</p><p> </p><p>Something like you, he felt himself flush, stammer, and point out, “You didn’t have to answer the summons!”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s the holy grail war. Even in another dimension, even in this new and improved team edition versus the typical battle royale, when the greater grail’s involved, for the good of mankind, I didn’t have much of a choice,” she seemed rather bitter about that, as if she really had wished she could just say no, then with a sigh, turned her attention back to the stunned Astolfo, “Sorry about that, I just got out of round one of the war only a year ago, I wasn’t exactly excited about the prospect of round two. You can call me Lily.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lily?” Astolfo asked, considering, eyes looking down Lily’s school girl uniform for some hint of her origin and powers.</p><p> </p><p>Caules must have been feeling insulted or angry or something as he blurted, “Her name is Frankenstein.”</p><p> </p><p>He felt his servant’s attention whip back to him, that unimpressed look back again, and said rather dully, as if she was afraid he might be too slow to keep up, “Her name is Lily and she does not particularly enjoy being talked about as if she is not standing right here. Apparently, I’m Berserker this time around and get to do what I do best.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you do best?” Astolfo asked, rocking back on his heels and crossing his arms behind his head, apparently more at ease now that a name and class at least had been given.</p><p> </p><p>“Eat treacle tart and blow shit up,” Frankenstein’s monster, no, Lily said in a strange casual manner, “And I’m all out of treacle tart.”</p><p> </p><p>They all just stared at her, blinking, while all Caules could think was that whatever he had summoned it was… He had no idea, just that he was beginning to think she really wasn’t Frankenstein’s creation.</p><p> </p><p>Except… It had been Frankenstein’s relic.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” Astolfo said, blinking slightly, and then finally turning her attention to Uncle Gordes’ servant, Saber.</p><p> </p><p>“So, what’s your name?”</p><p> </p><p>The man’s expression was haggard, Caules couldn’t help but think, already worn down before the war had even really started. Of course, maybe he shouldn’t have been surprised, heroes weren’t remembered for having easy lives after all but something in him seemed more tired than Archer, Rider, or even Berserker…</p><p> </p><p>“I am—” he started but was immediately cut off by Uncle Gordes.</p><p> </p><p>“Hold it!” Uncle Gordes walked in front of the man, no, almost strutted until he stood directly in front of him, “Saber, don’t you dare say another word!”</p><p> </p><p>There was a sudden, bitter, feeling of distrust and tension in the room. Caules unwillingly felt his eye fall on his own servant, Lily, who was looking at him with bitter and rather knowing amusement. Suddenly Caules found himself remembering all the details of the first three holy grail wars, the carnage and the bloodshed and betrayal upon betrayal even among family.</p><p> </p><p>Except…</p><p> </p><p>Except this time, it was not the same. This time there were fourteen servants, a red team supplied by the Mage’s Association and the Clock Tower and a black team provided by Yggdmillennia in Romania. This time they had the greater grail, they had the goal of defeating the mage’s association and legitimizing their own Yggdmillennia association, and afterwards they could all battle it out for the holy grail when the Clock Tower forces were defeated.</p><p> </p><p>More, these weren’t distant unknown relatives pitted against one another, but a family of mages with his older sister, uncle, cousins, and Uncle Darnic himself leading them into battle as he had been planning to for decades.</p><p> </p><p>And they already had the greater grail.</p><p> </p><p>As Darnic had said, even though some of them could die, they had nothing to fear. They had all but already won this war.</p><p> </p><p>Celenike’s cold, cruel, voice cut in, “We agreed to disclose true names in advance, didn’t we?”</p><p> </p><p>Gordes seemed unaffected as he turned to stare at her, “I’m rescinding that, the less people who know your true names, the better.”</p><p> </p><p>Caules looked towards his sister, who was staring over at Uncle Gordes and likely knowing and fearing the worst. Finally, her eyes moved to Uncle Darnic and she asked, quietly and pleadingly, “Uncle Darnic?”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment the tension was palpable but then Darnic said, “That’s fine, Gordes, as long as you hold responsibility for it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” Gordes said, unshakingly, as if Darnic’s cryptic words did not bother him the least. That he would have to hold responsibility for that.</p><p> </p><p>“This is the beginning,” Vlad stood once again from the throne, looking down on them all, “With our combined power, we will easily be able to annihilate the red faction and their servants. My proud and fearless heroes, I look forward to your brave achievements.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, with a rather intimidating look, he introduced himself, “I am Vlad Tepish of Romania, to defend my country and to grant my own wish, I swear I will emerge victorious!”</p><p> </p><p>All the servants bowed before him, all, except that is, Berserker. Instead she got an oddly curious look on her face, darted forward in a manner almost similar to the overeager Astolfo, and asked with stars practically dancing in her deep green eyes, “You mean you’re Vlad the Impaler? As in Dracula?”</p><p> </p><p>Everything seemed to freeze, the shadows grew colder, it was as if the very earth beneath their feet trembled. Berserker, however, seemed entirely oblivious as she grinned and darted forward to the throne and its king with all the bullheadedness you could expect from Berserker, “Oh I know several vampires who, well, I don’t know if I’d call them fans, but they certainly know of your work. Although, I’ll admit that Frank considers you quite the useless womanizer who could have gotten a lot more done if he’d just laid off the whole English wife-stealing bit. Still, what does he know, you’re famous and he’s a dweeby secretary!”</p><p> </p><p>She did not explain who this Frank was, instead darted up the steps and raised her hand out towards his as if to shake it, “You meet the oddest assortment of characters during a grail war.”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment Vlad Tepish said nothing, merely glared down upon her, and finally he said, “For your insolence I would see you impaled on a spike and banished from my kingdom. For your naïve disregard of my work and my legend I would see you tortured into the afterlife and beyond, as immortal as that reputation forced upon me by my craven enemies…”</p><p> </p><p>His lips twisted into a grimace and then a cruel smile, “But there is a war to be won and work to be done. I look forward to the end of the red faction and the beginning of your end, Lily, Berserker of Black.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily just smiled, withdrew her hand, and noted with almost wry amusement, “I have faced gods as well as kings and survived, your majesty, death holds no dominion over me.”</p><p> </p><p>She skipped down the steps, two at a time until she landed back on the marble floor with the other servants and masters. Finally, with one look back up and putting her hands into her pockets, ignoring the glare of the man as well as the other masters, “Besides, I’m the only one here who seems to remember that, at the end of the day, there can only be one lord of the rings.”</p><p> </p><p>With that, she offered them each a shallow bow, and then walked out of the room, black modern shoes tapping against the marble floor until she was out in the hallway without even a glance behind her. Without even a glance towards Caules, the master who had summoned her into the grail war in the first place.</p>
