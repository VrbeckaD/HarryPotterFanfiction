    <p>“ ‘S not fair.”</p><p>Remus shifted slightly so that Sirius wasn’t mumbling into his neck, though the darker haired boy was still wrapped so tightly around him that, had he not secretly enjoyed the position a great deal, he would have complained about the sticky sweat pooling in between them in the intense summer heat. The other boys in the dorm had long ago drifted off asleep, so they were able to open the stifling curtains and allow for some air to flow through. The breeze blowing in through the window, however, was warm and damp.</p><p>Remus didn’t like to complain though. After all, he had waited so long to have Sirius in his bed and now here he was, sweaty and complaining and perfect.</p><p>“What’s not fair?” Remus asked patiently, knowing that the perceived injustice Sirius considered would likely be something rather trivial.</p><p>“It’s not fair that I finally know what all this—” he gestured lazily between them, “—feels like, and now its going to be ripped away from me for an entire summer.”</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes, but a smile tugged at his lips betrayingly. Sirius had a special talent for being dramatic. “Nothing is being ‘ripped away’ from you. You know you can come to visit whenever you want.”</p><p>Remus needn’t bother suggesting he visit Sirius. It was bad enough that Sirius had befriended a half-blood, half-breed, Gryffindor poof—Walburga and Orion definitely did <em>not</em> need to know that he was now dating him.</p><p>“But we won’t be able to see each other every day. I won’t be able to <em>kiss</em> you every day.” Sirius was pouting but staring resolutely out the window, apparently embarrassed at showing such feelings so vulnerably.</p><p>Remus felt himself blush slightly at Sirius’s words. He would also miss having such easy access to Sirius— and his lips. Besides, they had only <em>just</em> figured their shit out and gotten together, meaning they hadn’t had a lot of time to explore each other and, well, other <em>stuff</em>.</p><p>“Only for three months.” Remus pointed out, though he sounded rather unconvinced himself at the prospect.</p><p>“A <em>lifetime</em>.” Sirius corrected him, as always, dramatically.</p><p>“No, <em>not</em> a lifetime.” Remus argued, tangling his fingers more deeply into Sirius’s unruly hair.</p><p>Sirius was quiet for a moment, then very softly said: “I don’t want to go back there.”</p><p>Remus’s heart ached at the pain laced through Sirius’s statement. “I know.” He whispered sadly, tightening his hold on Sirius.</p><p>He hated thinking of his boyfriend at his parents’ house as well. He couldn’t think of the abuse Sirius went through without his stomach clenching angrily and feeling an intense need to give the entire Black family a piece of his mind. It was, of course, important that Remus controlled such emotions—he couldn’t risk giving himself over to the monster inside him—but he found it increasingly hard to dampen his emotions when he was around Sirius.</p><p>“We’ll get you out of there whenever we can. As often as possible.” Remus promised, sitting up and pulling Sirius with him so he could properly look at him.</p><p>Sirius nodded mutely and then leaned forward to touch his lips to Remus’s, very softly. It was a tentative kiss, as if he wanted to ask Remus if he really meant what he said. Remus answered by leaning into Sirius’s touch, untangling his hand from Sirius’s hair and settling it on his lower back. The pressure was not enough, and Sirius quickly deepened the kiss. Remus felt his cock twitch uninvitedly when Sirius let out a soft moan. Sirius rolled slightly so that he was straddling Remus in the moonlight, revealing his own hardening erection as it rubbed against Remus’s stomach. Sirius ran a hand up Remus’s thigh and, unwillingly, Remus let out a small groan from the back of his throat.</p><p>The sound of James mumbling and shifting in his sleep caused them both to freeze. They stayed there, silent and still, until James stopped moving and the sound of his steady snoring resumed. Both boys were now blushing and avoiding eye contact with each other, aware that they had each been ready to press things further than they’d ever before been.</p><p>Sirius let out a great sigh and reluctantly peeled himself off of Remus at the reminder of their friends’ presences in the room. He flopped back down on the bed unceremoniously and threw an arm over his forehead, the very picture of a damsel in distress.</p><p>“Three months.” He groaned, “A <em>lifetime</em>.”</p>
