    <p>Fenrir Greyback barred his teeth in anticipation for the things to come. His friends - who all shared his curse - were with him. Today was that day.</p><p>"Soon, our pack will grow." he said, with wild joy in his eyes "Nothing and no one will get in our way."</p><p>"Are you sure, boss?" one of the others said "I mean, this is....."</p><p>"It would be thrilling, trust me, Andrews." Greyback responded with glee "Children are most impressionable. We will have what we want. I will have what I want."</p><p>"But Hogwarts is....." Andrews tried again</p><p>"Are you standing between me and my prey, Andrews?" Greyback growled "Want 'im for yourself, do you?"</p><p>Andrews took a step back. A bead of sweat rolled down his forehead.</p><p>"Don't worry, Andrews." Greyback laughed "You have the instincts of a true werewolf, and I can't begrudge you for that. Once we take him, he'll be ours, forever."</p><p>"That is, if we succeed." another person - this one a woman - stepped forward.</p><p>"That is where you come in, Martha."

And once we get him to join our ranks, you'll be his mother and I'll be his father. We'll raise him together to hate 'em."</p><p>"What about me?" Andrews protested</p><p>"The rest of you can be his honorary uncles." Martha suggested</p>
