"Try those."</p><p>Rodolphus muttered, "The Dark Lord said---"</p><p>Walden told him, "Forget what he told you, he knows nothing about executing or my routine for that matter." He insisted, "Now try those on."</p><p>He turned around while Rodolphus changed.</p><p>Rodolphus stated, "You can turn around."</p><p>Walden did so and smiled slightly. "Not too bad, that actually fits you better than it does me."</p><p>Rodolphus asked, "So where do I start?"</p><p>Walden replied, "I have an execution at twelve, till then get to know my routine. First, breakfast at nine. I only eat meat for breakfast, get to work Lestrange."</p><p>Rodolphus gasped. "Th-That's ten minutes away."</p><p>Walden smirked. "That's why I said get to work. You turned up late, so that's your problem not mine."</p><p>Rodolphus turned towards the kitchen and mumbled, "This is going to be a long day."</p></div>
