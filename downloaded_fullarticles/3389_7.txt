    <p>The little mage listened to the black and white music box with a light smile on her slightly bruised face as she turned the crank. She couldn't understand why anyone would throw it out as the little box clearly worked. She did think that the name was a bit weird, 'Laughing Jack in the box', but it was still nice to hear it play. She hummed the song softly underneath her breath. As the song ended, the box popped open making her gasp softly only to find that the toy was empty. Instead of being disappointed, she closed the lid with a soft smile and hugged the box to her chest. A finger tapped her shoulder making the little girl spin around and see a rather interesting sight. A rather tall man stood behind her with long black hair, white eyes, and a cone shaped nose. The man had long arms with feathers on his shoulders, baggy pants, and striped socks. He was ghostly white with black circles around his eyes and sharp teeth that could be seen as he smiled at her. All in all, she thought he looked like one of those clowns Dudley used to be obsessed with though he wasn't fat like the ones she had seen nor very colorful. In fact, the clown was monochrome. Clutching the box to her chest, she asked the man, "Who are you?"</p><p>"I am Laughing Jack," He informed her with a soft laugh, "And who are you?"</p><p>The little mage blinked at him before replying, "I dunno. My relatives call me Freak."</p><p>The man jolted and his smile slipped slightly as he asked, "Why do they call you that?"</p><p>She shrugged lightly, "I don't really know."</p><p>"Well that's not a proper name," Laughing Jack informed her before asking, "What about those bruises?"</p><p>She stared at him in surprise. No one had ever asked her about the bruises before. The four year old shifted slightly before saying softly, "My relatives. If I do something wrong, I get beaten."</p><p>"That isn't right," Laughing Jack bent down and pulled a red lollipop from his pants, "Want this?"</p><p>She stared at the sweet in surprise. She'd never had one before. She hesitantly reached for it and took it from Laughing Jack making him smile once more. She looked at him before asking, "How do you open it?"</p><p>He showed her how to get the wrapper off and she tasted the treat. Immediately, she found that she rather liked it. Laughing Jack smiled at her before suggesting, "Since you don't know your actual name, how about we come up with one for you?"</p><p>She perked up at the suggestion and nodded. While Petunia had always told Dudley to be wary of strangers, the little mage didn't think this one was bad. If anything, she felt that Laughing Jack wouldn't hurt her. For thirty minutes or so, the two puzzled out various names before finally Laughing Jack suggested, "How about Keira?"</p><p>"Keira?" She asked him softly.</p><p>"It means little dark one," He gestured to her dark red and black hair, "Your hair is dark and your little, so why not?"</p><p>She tested the name in her mind before nodding with a soft smile as she finished her lollipop, "I like it."</p><p>"Good," He patted her head softly.</p><p>The newly named Keira flinched slightly, but Laughing Jack didn't seem to notice. Instead, he suggested, "How about we play some games?"</p><p>Keira shifted slightly before saying, "I don't know any games."</p><p>"Well I'll teach you!" Laughing Jack exclaimed and grabbed her hand.</p><hr/><p>It was hours before Keira and Laughing Jack stopped playing. Keira was sweaty and covered in dirt, but happy. They walked towards her relatives house and Laughing Jack asked, "How can you live in such a boring Neighborhood?"</p><p>"My relatives are weird," She told the monochrome clown as they reached her house and she handed him the box, "Petunia would burn that if I kept it,"</p><p>Laughing Jack frowned as he took his box from her. While Laughing Jack normally killed kids, it was the ones that were very rude or spoiled. He found that he didn't wish to kill this little one. Over the course of the afternoon since she had gotten his box, Laughing Jack found himself getting angry about what was going on with her home life. He peered down at the lightly tanned red and black haired child for a few moments before saying, "I'll find a way for you to keep it."</p><p>"Why?" She looked at him with those bright emerald green eyes that were both too old, yet too young to belong to the child before him.</p><p>"It'll be the mark of our friendship other than your name!" Laughing Jack grinned cheerfully at her earning a wide eyed look from her.</p><p>"Friends?" Keira whispered softly making something rise up in Jack's chest.</p><p>It took him a few moments before he realized that it was rage. It had been a very long time since he'd felt that emotion. He believed that the last time was when Issac had left him to rot in that damn box of his for thirteen years. Sure some kids were just bad at making friends, but Laughing Jack knew that her relatives probably forced her to be isolated. The looks on the other adults faces when they saw little Keira proved his theory. Humans were idiots for the most part. Laughing Jack forced himself to nod and smile softly at her as he laid his clawed hand on her head earning a soft flinch that he ignored, "Of course! Don't you want to be friends?"</p><p>Keira hesitated before nodding, "Yes."</p><p>"Then I'll make sure you keep that box," Laughing Jack told her firmly before glancing at the house where the door was opening to reveal a rather thin horse-faced woman that disgusted him, "Am I to assume that horse is your aunt?"</p><p>"Petunia," Keira murmured with a slightly dejected look on her face, "Goodbye, Laughing Jack,"</p><p>"Goodbyes are forever," Laughing Jack grinned down at her, "Let's just say some see you later's,"</p><p>Keira offered him a quick nod before running towards her relatives house. Laughing Jack watched her go while glaring at her aunt. Some humans really disgusted him.</p><hr/><p>2 years later</p><hr/><p>"Jack!" An excited Keira ran into the secluded grove where they usually met up, "It happened just like you said it would! They're being taken away!"</p><p>Laughing Jack grinned down at the child and pulled her into a hug, "That's wonderful, Gumdrop!"</p><p>"Mhmm," Keira hugged him back with a grin on her face, "I'm so happy!"</p><p>"Good. They deserve what happens to them," Laughing Jack would have to thank BEN for his help in this.</p><p>They both heard some calling out, "Willow!"</p><p>Keira let go of Laughing Jack and turned to look towards the source of the voice making him frown a little while asking, "Who's that?"</p><p>"Miss Sandy," Keira's nose scrunched up, "Apparently my real names Willow, but I like Keira a lot more,"</p><p>"Good," Laughing Jack patted her on the head which didn't cause Keira to flinch anymore, "Why is she calling you?"</p><p>Keira immediatly lost her grin and frowned, "Miss Sandy is taking me to a new home today."</p><p>"A new home?" Laughing Jack realized what she meant, "Your moving away,"</p><p>Keira nodded sadly and looked at Laughing Jack with a miserable look on her face, "I don't wanna go if it means leaving you behind."</p><p>Laughing Jack had known this would probably happen. Part of him was happy because it would mean Keira was both going to be in a much healthier environment and that he wouldn't have to kill her. The rest was sad because he'd grown very fond of the little red and black haired girl. She was like Issac had been only much better and he knew she'd never forget him. Bending down, Laughing Jack told her, "Keira, I don't want you to go, but you need to. It's about time I leave as well."</p><p>"But why?" Keira had tears gathering in her eyes and that made Laughing Jack's black heart ache, "I don't want to lose you,"</p><p>"You won't, Gumdrop," He assured her while wiped away the glistening drops of salt water off of her face, "Do you have my box?"</p><p>"It's in my backpack," She patted the small black bag, "Why?"</p><p>"So long as you have it, I'll always come back to you," Laughing Jack promised her, "If you ever truly need me, you need only to use the box and sing the song I taught you,"</p><p>"O-okay," Keira agreed making Laughing Jack smile sadly, "But I'll miss you,"</p><p>"And I'll miss you too," Laughing Jack hugged her close as he spoke, "But it's bad for me to stay in one place for too long,"</p><p>"Because you need to kill people right?" She asked earning a nod from Laughing Jack, "Will you come see me whenever you can?"</p><p>"I'll try," Laughing Jack promised her.</p><p>"Then I'll be a good girl and go with them," Keira kissed Laughing Jack on the cheek before leaving his arms, "See you later, Laughing Jack,"</p><p>"See you later, Keira," Laughing Jack watched his second real best friend walk away.</p><p>Laughing Jack didn't want her to go, but he knew it was for the best until she was older. He didn't know why he felt that way and would talk to Slenderman at some point, but for now he would state the urge to kill. He'd lasted the last three months without killing anyone, but now it was time to get scratch that itch of his. Laughing Jack looked around the little secluded grove before disappearing in a burst of black smoke.</p>
