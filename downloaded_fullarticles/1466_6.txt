    <p>A large, tangled mess of red hair was strewn across the large kitchen table. Morning light was streaming through the windows in waves, making its way over the treetops and into the home. The owner of the hair had only just fallen asleep at daybreak.</p><p>“ROSE?-WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?” A voice came with two sets of pounding footsteps down the stairwell and the girl behind the mess of red locks jolted awake.</p><p>“Have I missed the letters?” She questioned frantically, “Mum said they would come any day now, oh I know I should have never let her leave so close to them being sent, and taking Hugo no less! I swear I could just-”</p><p>“Shove off Rose,” another boy came down the stairs in a much less boisterous manner, “what exactly are you on about? And why are you here,” the boy began questioning his cousin only to be interrupted (as usual).</p><p>“Well as you two know, however thick you are, our fathers are still in Iceland for the Ministry. And Mum has just barely took a portkey last night with Hugo to <em> another </em>Magical Creature Rights convention in London for the week. Apparently with no time to apparate back and forth either. At any rate, your mum should have told you I’d be staying the night-”</p><p>This time it was the green-eyed boy’s turn to interject, “She did tell us,  but we’d assume you’d be in a guest bed, yeah? Not drooling where we eat!”</p><p>“Alright Al, that’s enough.” A warm voice called from the behind a cupboard. Age had done Ginny Weasley (Potter) well, her body still tone enough after several years of professional Quidditch and three kids. Her face had mellowed out some, however. The sharp and striking features had melted around her warm brown eyes to fit them perfectly. “Rose wanted a jumpstart on waiting for the mail, don’t act as though you boys didn’t do the same thing for weeks straight when you were younger.”</p><p>“That’s a bloody laugh-”</p><p>“<em> LANGUAGE </em>JAMES-”</p><p>“I can’t recall a time that I ever-”</p><p>“When you were a first year! And second year for that matter too, feared just the same as all of us they wouldn’t let you back-”</p><p>“Right, when I was <em> eleven </em>I waited for mail. Rose, you’re nearly fifteen, what is quite the deal?”</p><p>The young redhead was in between a yawn, which she quickly stifled to answer. “How thick can you get, James? Fifth year is the year prefects are chosen and only once in the entire history of Hogwarts has a Head Girl been chosen that <em>wasn’t </em>a prefect and how on Earth can I expect to be the youngest Head Healer at Mungo’s if I can’t even show leadership in school-<em>OH MY GOD THERE IT IS THERE’S THE OWL THERE’S THE POST</em>” Rose then sprinted out of the kitchen door towards the incoming bird. It slowed and dropped the letter into her hands, more accurately it reluctantly released the letter into her prying fingers.</p><p>Rose rushed back into the home almost as quickly as her face fell.</p><p>“For you, Al” She said softly, reaching out a trembling hand with the letter.</p><p>Albus Severus Potter noticed for the first time in a long time that receiving a letter no longer gave him butterflies or made his stomach flip. More often than not, depending on the sender, he felt a flood of relief in furthered correspondence. However, his heart did sink as his usual pen-pal was not the suspected author of this letter. After all, Rose had said they would expect their Hogwarts letters soon. But when he thanked Rose and flipped it over to pick at the usual red wax seal, he was surprised to see a smooth back. Turning it back over to the side with the address line, he noticed his letter was also lacking Hogwarts’ usual magic of knowing exactly where the recipient would be when the letter would be opened. The front was simply adorned with “A.S.P.” and a small drawing of the snake that bore the same name as Al’s initials. Only one person addressed letters to him with this configuration, but they also usually had a family crest sunk into a pool of deep emerald wax to seal any envelope that left from their home.</p><p>“It’s not any news from school Rose, at least nothing about prefects or book lists or anything. Probably one of my roommates, maybe Aslan got his letter and he’s sent word, he lives much closer to the castle…” Al trailed off with a distant look in his eyes, itching to tear into the letter and slowly inching back toward the stairs he had come from not too long ago.</p><p>Albus’ opportunity to break away came when Rose’s screams took up again, this time four owls flocking toward the house together. By the time the letters addressed “Rose Jane Weasley: Potter Residence Back Garden, James Sirius Potter: Potter Residence Kitchen, Albus Severus Potter: Potter Residence Stairwell, and Lily Luna Potter: Potter Residence Bedroom” were all handed out respectively (save Lily’s, as no amount of screaming could wake her this early any day), Al was more than halfway back into his room.</p><p>The click of his door could never block the continued screams of Rose as she called out to anyone who was listening in the surrounding twenty miles that she had been made the female Gryffindor prefect for their year. He could hear his mum congratulating both her and James, who had been reinstated for the third year as Quidditch captain for the same house. Albus, however, took nearly no notice to the letter bearing the wax seal.</p><p>More slowly than he would have preferred, in order to not tear any parchment, Al opened the nondescript with his replica Firebolt III letter opener. His heart sunk deeper into his chest as the Slytherin crest adorned the top of the page. Maybe it really was from Aslan then, Albus thought to himself sadly. Nevertheless, Albus scanned the page for the bottom of the blocks of writing for a signature. It was a bad habit he had gotten himself into due to an incident in the summer before his first year. James had sent him several fake letters, made to look like they were coming from Hogwarts, telling him he was a Squib and was rejected from his place at the school. The only giveaway that it wasn’t authentic was the signature at the bottom-every time-”You’re a thick idiot, why would you be the only one getting a letter when two people in this house go to this school.” It had happened not once, but twelve times before the real letter had arrived. But by then Albus checked the name at the bottom of the letter before reading a single word of it. His mother had been livid at the both of them, saying it was rude of him because he’d have an opinion on the letter before giving it a chance depending on the author. At least James had been grounded from playing Quidditch out back with Teddy for a whole month.</p><p>Al’s heart suddenly soared back up through his chest and felt as though it would pump its way right out of his mouth as the signature at the bottom of the page was exactly who he always wanted to hear from.</p><p>
  <em> Al- </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I apologize for the parchment. Visiting Grandmother and Grandfather leaves very limited options and not one of them was about to take me into muggle OR wizarding Paris of all places to track down parchment paper. Do they (the muggles) even use it anymore? Regardless, they would never have my usual sort and if anything I would never send you a letter with Beauxbatons brandings. You already know I’m a poof. Jokes aside, I do have quite a few things to show you when we meet next. I even visited a few muggle shops with Grandmother, and I’ve picked you up a few bits here and there. I expect we’ll be back at the Manor in a week or so, and in London at Diagon Alley possibly the week after that. I would like to see you there, although I understand the struggle with your family. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> In other news, I suppose school letters to be coming soon, yeah? This year is prefect year, as I am sure your cousin has been ever anxiously awaiting. I also expect your brother has been made captain again? I’m sure both your parents are very proud. Well, your father may not know depending on whether or not he’s back yet. I would hope he is, this might not reach you for a while, the English Channel seems to be difficult for Grandfather’s owl for some reason. At any rate, speaking of captains, that arse Ventac seems to think he’s guaranteed the position this year. Talked about it non-stop once the season was over last year. Says he doesn’t care much about prefect for that reason, but I think he’s right thick. Firstly-the sixth year Maria Greysen will surely be captain over him, she’s a better player than him regardless of what he says and she’s more levelheaded. I reckon he’s just a misogynist who can’t handle being a female’s second hand, and Merlin, it’s the twenty-first century! And we’re supposed to be the smart ones, let alone progressive. Anyway, secondly everyone in our house gets stiff (clean up your mind, Albus) whenever the idea of prefect is brought up anytime after O.W.L.s come up. Once the stress of exams are over it’s like a bloodbath or something I suppose. Father was a prefect, mother as well, but I’m not sure how the legacy will uphold. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I expect you and your cousin are granted though, don’t fret your brothers’ reputation, it can’t affect you where you are. You really don’t have much competition at all. I am truly more worried about my O.W.L.s, my exam results from this past year barely scraping O’s. I am trying my best to keep all my subjects still, and no you cannot talk me out of it. Well, you can talk me out of the ones I don’t pass in. If I even decide to return to Hogwarts after that shame. I feel bad for the bloke who gets it though, everyone else will make a targeted attempt to cause more chaos to distract him from his studies with his prefect responsibilities. At any rate, enough about school, I’m sure you’ve already fallen asleep reading this. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I miss you, Al. I do every holiday. I’ve started talking my parents into letting me stay for winter hols, Mother is keen on more studying time but I know Father suspects something is going on. He doesn’t mind what I do nearly as much as his father did he, but he nevertheless is nosy as as all Hades. I expect he will give in eventually in an effort to NOT be like his father. Your family is likely still fine with it, right? I also assume Rose will try and get to Hogwarts before the first this year, and won’t even leave the library for Hogsmeade weekends. James might stay too, right? It’s his last year after all and he’s only stayed for Christmas the once, I think once one experiences it it’s hard to go back, no matter how homesick. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Well, I’ve written more about you and yours again, my apologies. It’s getting late and the scratch of quill might wake someone, I don’t need a house elf attempting to quiet me again. See you soon, hopefully. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The letter wasn’t signed with a name, rather another drawing. Unlike the snake on the front, it was a collection of stars. The constellation had been Albus’ favorite since the first Astronomy lesson with the Ravenclaws in his first year. He quickly grabbed out his own parchment and quill, ignoring the continued squeals of Rose, now joined by Lily who had finally awoken and was already begging Ginny to sign her Hogsmeade permission form. Shoving aside and paying no attention to the Hogwarts letter and the seemingly badge shaped bump in it-Albus began his letter. No real introduction, simply diving into his rant about how Scorpius Malfoy of all people needn’t worry about O.W.L. scores.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>“Scorpius! Wake up love, you’ve mail!” The boy stirred at the calm voice of his mother calling through the door. He slipped out of his four poster, not unsimilar to the one in which he spent his nights back at school. His blonde hair cascaded past his ears in a way that made his entire family cringe, but they had long since given up on making every extension of the Malfoy name represent what it once did. In fact, they tended to do the exact opposite. When Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy had been sorted into Ravenclaw rather than Slytherin like every last one of his ancestors, his remaining, un-imprisoned relatives were relieved. He strolled over to the door, noticing his mother had slipped his letters under the door along with a note of her own that read ‘<em> The Hogwarts one looks a bit thicker than usual’ </em>, which was Astoria Malfoy’s subtle way of implying Scorpius had been made prefect.</p><p>Though neither of them would admit it, both of his parents had been hoping for the past fifteen years that Scorpius would be held to a high standard, one that he earned for himself. But Scorpius had never been athletically gifted, and couldn’t follow his father’s footsteps in Quidditch (although Draco Malfoy had used his family money and status to gain his spot, he probably could have earned it regardless a year or so down the line. Draco wasn’t half bad when it came to hasty grabs at shiny objects. He’s since come to know that all that glitters isn’t gold). Astoria also worried that Scorpius would lack in school as he was rarely attentive in her homeschooling lessons in his youth. But after first term reports had come in his first year at Hogwarts, the Malfoys realized that their son was a-for lack of a better word-genius. He thrived in the atmosphere partly because it was more difficult, but also because it was more competitive. Scorpius had his chance to forge a new name for himself and his family by being the top of his class. Which he had been easily for his entire schooling career.</p><p>His lack of attentivity in childhood had crept back in his second year, for the same reason as when he was young: he was bored. The material was simply too easy. Because of this, Scorpius had been given special permission by Headmistress McGonagall to enroll in the elective classes that usually began in a student’s third year. He was initially shocked that he was being given special treatment, but McGonagall had been quick to tell him that it was not the first time she had entrusted a form of special treatment with a student, and that she trusted he would use his opportunity just as well as students in the past had. His parents had nearly burst with pride. In fact, the Malfoys completely disregarded Scorpius’ disregard for the broomstick and even stopped worrying about his capability for prefect, at least for a while.</p><p>Because of this, though, Scorpius could expect to hear back about his four O.W.L. results from the year previous. He had wanted to take all of the offered courses, but McGonagall forbade him, questioning how he would manage to be in multiple places at once. She did however promise that once he reached his fifth year he would be allowed to add on two more classes, as the formal O.W.L year had less class periods for core classes, supposedly leaving more time for studying. He had had a hard time narrowing the list down both times he was given the opportunity to select them. His parents were not an extreme help, as only five course were offered when they attended. With eleven courses, the usual student would miss SEVEN subjects if they took the maximum allowed amount! Nevertheless, he had chosen Arithmancy and Ancient Runes first, after hearing they were the most difficult choices. Next he wanted more advanced and possibly more dangerous classes, but McGonagall drew the line (it was then that she offered them to him as a fifth year start). Scorpius reluctantly settled for Study of Magical Objects, as they truly intrigued him and the class was rumored to have a section highlighting some dark objects that had been used in the war. For his final selection of the four, as a shock to seemingly everyone in the wizarding world, he picked Muggle Studies. As far as he knew at the time, his parents were not against muggles. They just didn’t know anything about them. After learning his family’s history of hatred, it was Scorpius’ turn to be shocked when his father would drill him about what he had learned over every break.</p><p>Scorpius first opened the letter marked with CONFIDENTIAL: STUDENT O.W.L. RESULTS in large red letters. He gazed through his marks, setting back down the four straight O’s while slipping into a daydream about the advanced electives he would be taking the coming year. Occlumency had apparently been a very controversial addition, but was pushed heavily by several war heroes. It was saved for a post-O.W.L. option due to it’s level of mental maturity, as opposed to his second selection. He was possibly more excited about Alchemy, as it was a fusal of his two favorite subjects: Potions and Transfiguration. Alchemy was not taught until a (usual) student’s sixth year, as the proper knowledge of both subjects was required. McGonagall said she would pull him right from the two N.E.W.T. lessons if his grades showed even signs of slipping from their lofty level in ANY of his core subjects. The both of them knew that his grades would only go up if they had the room, and neither were bothered.</p><p>The daydream was thrust from his mind as Scorpius came out of his reverie, focusing back in on the rest of the papers on his desk. He had the oddly bulging Hogwarts letter, likely holding his book list and maybe another something, but two other envelopes lay unopened. Wanting to investigate everything, he started at the top of the pile. A sense of excitement but worry washed over Scorpius as the bronze Ravenclaw prefect pin landed on the tabletop with a slight clunk. He knew his parents would be proud, his fellow Ravenclaws jealous, other friends excited for him, but he immediately thought about a few things. One of the first of those things being the fact that not all of his friends would be able to share the excitement with him. He pushed these thoughts from his mind as he focused in on a problem that he promised himself would be more important: schoolwork. He would be taking a total of twelve courses this year (the seven core classes, the two new advanced electives, and only three of his four original electives. Study of Magical Objects ended at O.W.L level). Prefect duties on top of that might be too difficult.</p><p>Once again forcing himself to push thoughts away, the fifteen year old turned to the remaining letters. Scorpius’ stomach lurched in the most pleasant way as he immediately recognized the emerald green ink that read “<em> Your granddad’s stupid owl took ages to bring your letter, judging by your timestamp and the day I received it. I’m sending Almond with this and I’ve told him to stay with you until you’ve written a response so I can receive word more quickly.” </em>Scorpius felt his stomach lurch again when he realized someone other than him had read the message on the front, silently cursing Albus for never addressing a letter normally. Although, he calmed because as his mother brought him the letters, she most likely intercepted all of them before another member of his family had the chance. He wouldn’t be surprised if he would find Al’s owl up on the perch of the attic with his Grandfather’s “stupid owl.”</p><p>Scorpius knew he would be in a very good mood after Albus’ response to his own most recent correspondence, and decided to give his attention to the final letter. It turned out to be word that the old Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn had died. Peacefully and in his sleep, but nevertheless Scorpius saw it as a great loss. Professor Slughorn had, in his own words, “overstayed his welcome” when he had returned to the school for the third time once it had been fully restored after the war, complete with newly refurbished potion labs and stocks. When he had first met the man, Scorpius felt as though he disliked him. But his mother had gotten along with the man perfectly well when she was in school and Potions had been his father’s best subject. But it had been Scorpius’ own talent and charm that made him a Slughorn favorite by the time he retired at the end of the boy’s second year. The two wrote back and forth infrequently as the man grew more elderly and ill in conjunction. Scorpius didn’t realize he had shed a tear until it had nearly smudged out the date of the funeral he had been invited to. Slughorn had also left him some items in his will that would be given to him at the event. Scorpius wasn’t extremely close to the man, but it had been him who sparked the love of Potions in Scorpius’ young mind. He gingerly set the letter aside and refocused his attention to something that would surely cheer him up. He delayed his reading for a moment as he realized that it had been written the same day as it arrived. Maybe Grandfather’s owl truly was stupid.</p><p>
  <em> My Most Dearly Beloved Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You always write more about my family than yours, because you never want to talk about them. I’d hope you’ve gotten your O.W.L. results back by now, you officially owe me two galleons because you officially got 4 O’s before anyone else in our year has even taken the exams yet. Also, congratulations on becoming a prefect, which I am sure you’ve also been honored with. You’ll be pleased to know that one certain Rose Weasley will be joining the force with you this year, as well as, well, yours truly! I know, I was just as shocked as you are right now. Just another ploy to get me in the Slug Club I bet, but Dad’s reckoned that ol’Horance might not be around to see anyone in a role of power this year. Bit grim, that is. Dad was gone for a while though. They’d just sent out the third string of Aurors as well. But no matter, everyone seems to be back. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Well. Speaking of Dad, he’s just come back from his Ministry job and if I am overhearing him correctly with Mum Slughorn DID just bite it. You know me, I’m too lazy to cross any of that out or rewrite it. I hope this isn’t the first you’re hearing of his death though. I know you liked him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Anyway, I fully expect you to be here for winter hols, Scor. James has already told Mum and Dad he’ll be staying for both breaks this year, something no one in our family but Dad has ever done. At this and my own absence they’re planning on taking Lily to America to hear some muggle band that her and her dormmates are obsessed with. I only expect that there’s a muggleborn in with them who’s started the uproar. Even my Mum has a crush on the lead singer, even though he’s like twenty, and I assume that’s why they’re all going. Rose pretended to not know if she’d be staying but now claims that it is her ‘civic duty as a prefect’ to remain year-round. And hey, that’s another card you can play to your family. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I fully expect you to be in London soon, I miss you like wild. I’m starting to think I’ll need to skin Uncle George for some of his trick love potion to get you to pay me any attention anymore. I don’t have much time for talk now, but the Diagon dates are in the calendar already. I can’t wait. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> -Al </em>
</p><p>
  <em> PS: I’m not sure if you’ve fully read the prefects intro letter yet-I surely haven’t, but Rose hasn’t stopped babbling about our responsibilities I don’t think I’ll need to. At any rate, the Head girl and boy are from my house and yours, respectively. Just cool, I thought. Maybe they’ll be a bit bias to us. See you soon. </em>
</p><p>Scorpius could barely peel the smile off his face at the thoughts racing through his head after reading Albus’ messy but legible (barely, quite honestly) handwriting. He wanted to read the prefects’ requirements for himself and he was so focused on the fact that Albus would never need to use a love potion on Scorpius to get its namesake effect that he didn’t make the connection between the date of Slughorn’s funeral and the day the two had planned to meet in Diagon Alley.</p>
