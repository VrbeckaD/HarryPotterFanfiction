    <p class="p1">James flung his arms over the top of his head and yawned.</p><p class="p1"><em>Fuck McGonnagal’s fifteen-foot essay. I’ve done enough for tonight, or for a bloody lifetime, </em>he thought to himself. He rubbed at his eyes, getting up for bed.</p><p class="p1">Then he heard the knock, knock.</p><p class="p1">It was a tiny knock, knock. He couldn’t have caught it if he was still focused on his essay. He froze on the spot, standing beside the couch, a frown clouding its way over his face. His head slowly turned towards the door, but he couldn’t hear anything anymore. <em>Right. Now McGonnagal’s really gotten to me.</em></p><p class="p1">Just when he was about to shake his head and move for the stairs, he heard it again.</p><p class="p1">
  <em>Knock, knock.</em>
</p><p class="p1">This time, James was positively alarmed. It was close to two in the morning. According to his memory, no one, magic or muggle, had ever visited the Potters’ estate in the dead of night, uninvited and unexpected.</p><p class="p1">Rubbing at his eyes for the final time, he made a move towards the door. He pulled out his wand just in case, before jerking the door open.</p><p class="p2">There stood Padfoot.</p><p class="p1">“Prongsy,” he said, his eyes all but crossing over.</p><p class="p1">James stood shellshocked at the door. He stared at Sirius’s face, then slowly cast his eyes down to examine the idiot’s state: dribbling wet, shivering, on the brink of collapsing.</p><p class="p1">“What in the name of <em>bloody Merlin</em> happened to you, Sirius Black?”</p><p class="p1">“Don’t call me that.” Sirius said, suddenly sharp.</p><p class="p1">“Sorry,” James said. Sirius never exactly liked his family name. James silently cursed himself for forgetting.</p><p class="p1">Deciding that his best friend wasn’t feeling like answering any questions right now, not here where he was evidently freezing over, James motioned for him to come in.</p><p class="p2">Once inside, water trickled down from Sirius’s entire form onto the floor. James shut the door behind him and immediately set to work.</p><p class="p1">Lightly waving his wand around Sirius’s shuddering body, he siphoned off the cold rainwater and sparked up little heating charms all over him. Judging from how Sirius’s chattering teeth had become less audible, he wasn’t doing so bad.</p><p class="p1">“You good?” he said.</p><p class="p1">“Mmm.” Sirius said faintly.</p><p class="p1">“You want to take a hot bath, eat something, get some rest, or…”</p><p class="p1">“No, I’m good.”</p><p class="p1">Nonplussed, James peered at Sirius closely. Sirius’s eyes shocked him. They were squinting, as though he wasn’t sure he liked what he was looking at—which, painfully, was James’s face—and the exhaustion in them was so obvious that they looked utterly lifeless. Sirius was not himself at all. For all James knew, he could be under the Imperius. He was not usually this way— always quick to be witty, playfully snide, and, maybe at this moment, getting a kick out of seeing James being such a mom… and he was not doing any of this. What was James supposed to do? Just stand there like an idiot while Sirius figured out what he needed? Or should he just make a hot sandwich and force-feed it to him?</p><p class="p1">“Si…“ James started awkwardly, and, seeing Sirius’s expression, stopped abruptly.</p><p class="p1">Sirius squeezed his eyes shut, like it was painful just getting the next words out.</p><p class="p1">“Look, can I just… come in?”</p><p class="p1">James shook his head in disbelief.</p><p class="p1">“Since when did you start asking like that, all polite…”</p><p class="p1">He took his arm and dragged him into the living room.</p><p class="p2"> Once there, Sirius flopped himself onto the couch— the very spot where James had been sitting doing homework only moments ago. Sirius sunk his head into his arms, so low that his face was buried into the nooks of his elbows, all but hiding it from the world.</p><p class="p1">James trotted over and flopped down right beside him. He looked at Sirius and waited. One second of dead silence, two seconds, three, four…</p><p class="p1">But it didn’t matter. He would literally wait forever. Although he doubted he was the most helpful best friend ever, he could at least stay by Sirius’s side, not pushing him to say something, but not leaving him alone to deal with his turmoil, either. If staying in Sirius’s reach was going to help him even a little, then stay he would. Regardless of how much McGonnagal’s assignment had drained him.</p><p class="p2"> Suddenly, Sirius blurted out in a hoarse voice.</p><p class="p1">“I just ran away from my house, Prongs, no big deal.”</p><p class="p1">Now, if <em>that </em>wasn't what James was prepared for.</p><p class="p1">“What.” James said, dumbly. He held his breath until Sirius could begin to elaborate.</p><p class="p1">Sirius opened his mouth and-- sneezed. <em>Loud</em>. </p><p class="p2"> </p>
