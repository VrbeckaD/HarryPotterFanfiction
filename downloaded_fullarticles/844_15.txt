    <p>Don’t get involved, keep your head down and don’t get involved. She repeated the words like a mantra to herself as she pasted a pleasant smile on her face and served the customers at the bar she’d been working at for almost three months now.</p><p>	It had been nearly five years since she’d landed in this strange world of Oceans, Pirates and Marines, nearly five years since she’d gone from being Iris Jesse Potter Girl-Who-Lived and Woman-who- Conquered to just plain Iris the way she’d always wanted.</p><p>	She liked to think she was finally settling in nicely. Sure this world had its quirks, like snails for telephones, fishmen and mermaids and all sorts of interesting humanoids, and people with personalities so big and strange that sometimes she was left completely wrong footed but she had always been adaptable.</p><p>	The funny thing was that the hardest part of coming to this new world wasn’t its’ strangeness or its dangers, but trying to remain just Iris and not accidentally doing something that would catapult her into the spotlight once more. It was a combination of her Gryffindor nature that Hermione had always called her ‘saving people thing’, her inability to keep her mouth closed when she saw injustice being done to someone and her magical abilities of which there were none in this world.</p><p>	She’d discovered a month into her stay here that there was no magic in this world at all, but something entirely different that the people who knew about it called Haki, and strange fruits that gave even stranger powers. </p><p>	She’d been lucky that she’d landed in a part of this dimension that everyone in it called “The New World” where things like her magic were passed off as Haki or Devil fruit powers otherwise she probably would’ve been discovered and hauled before the government for questioning that or been hunted down by pirates wanting to use her powers themselves within the first week of her stay here.</p><p>	So far it had only really been a combination of the gratuitous use of Legilimency and Confundus charms that had allowed her to remain undetected and under the radar. Well, that and traveling from island to island when things started looking iffy with the local population.</p><p>	She’d quickly learned that Devil Fruits only gave the user one real power, and while that power could be versatile, doing things like apparating and wielding lightning at the same time were unheard of in a single Devil Fruit user and likely to put her under heavy suspicion and shifting into her Animagus form was completely out of the question. Through trial and error she’d finally resigned herself to not using magic at all outside the privacy of her home wherever she was living and only if it was under heavy wards to keep nosy neighbors out. The only exception was the occasional Legilimency scan on the people around her to help her better fit in.</p><p>	Learning that hadn’t been fun, and she’d left a lot of Confunded people in her wake those first couple of months. What had been fun was the travel, getting to see new people and places all the time and having all sorts of adventures in this strange world where islands sometimes rained lightning or defied gravity or contained man eating plants or strange fantastic creatures.</p><p>	This new world had made her feel like that first trip to Diagon Alley all those years ago had, filling her with wonder, joy, and a sense of adventure. Unlike Diagon Alley though she wasn’t nearly as naïve or trusting, and she was more cautious than she had ever been back in her home world.</p><p>	Still she’d had a lot of fun. She was a lot more experienced nowadays and a damn good fighter if she did say so herself. Moody had been damn proud of her training, that he’d taken over during her fifth year, calling her a prodigy and the best he’d ever taught. It helped that she had literally been born Voldemort’s magical equal, her core containing just as much if not more magic than his naturally while he’d gone through several dark and disturbing rituals to obtain his. It was no surprise then that she’d picked up wandless magic easily once someone finally started teaching her, and that her godfather had managed to sneak lessons into becoming an Animagus in, which had increased her senses and her physical toughness hadn’t hurt either. </p><p>With Moony supplying lessons on various physical i.e. muggle, fighting techniques he’d picked up from third year onwards it was really no surprise she’d become a veritable powerhouse. And that was before she’d accidentally absorbed the Hallows right after her final confrontation with Voldemort after obtaining the Death Stick from him.</p><p>She wasn’t sure about the Hallows being from Death’s own hands, but what she did know was that owning them all at the same time had caused them to disintegrate the first time she’d brought them all together and the magic had somehow been sucked into her body, leaving behind no trace of their presence except their symbol on her left palm, which she covered with a glove.</p><p>They had boosted her core even further pushing her far past the limits of normal witches and wizards, so far past in fact that it had been nearly impossible for her to control, and certainly not with a wand. In fact the first time she’d tried her old reliable Phoenix and Holly wand it had been blown to bits.</p><p>She’d been practically hysterical for a while until sensible Hermione had pulled her out of it, and insisted she train up her abilities so she wouldn’t hurt herself or others. Thus her fame had increased even more until she’d been practically deified, held up with the likes of Merlin, Circe, Morgana and the Founders Four.</p><p>She’d been appalled, horrified and afraid, especially since she knew how likely it was they’d turn on her the second something went wrong, and so she’d fled, taking all her worldly possessions and wealth, which turned out to be quite a bit, and escaped to a world where no one knew her name.</p><p>	With that kind of power at her disposal though the Grand Line wasn’t all too dangerous for her. Oh sure it was still pretty dangerous, she’d certainly still die if she was careless, reckless or stupid, and she certainly had no plans to take on any of the Navy Admirals, New World Yonkos or Schichibukai, but dangers that sent weaker pirates running she was usually able to just brush off.</p><p>As exciting and sometimes hair raising as exploring the Grand Line was after a while it started to get pretty lonely. Sure she met and interacted with people, but it was nothing like the close friendship and companionship she’d shared with some of her fellow students at Hogwarts, before they’d either died, drifted away from her, or turned their backs on her entirely.</p><p>	It wasn’t her fault the war hadn’t ended sooner, she’d done the best she could with what little she was given. Unfortunately it had taken her a long time to realize that, and during that time those still close had begun to drift away, building their lives with family or their soul mates, of which she had neither. Another of her many reasons for leaving as she had.</p><p>	At the thought her hand absently brushed against the words that were covered at the moment by her long sleeves. They started at the top of her right arm and spiraled around it in a mess of squiggles to the crook of her elbow. It had taken some contortions to see the first time, but she’d been reading them for as long as she could remember, and had them memorized by now. She played the words she’d learnt over and over in her mind waiting to meet them and doing her best to live up to them. After all her soul mate thought she was “a brave little spitfire” and who was she to prove him wrong?</p><p>	Still though it had been so long, most of her classmates had found their soul mates in school and if not then, then fairly soon afterwards. She’d been considered more than a bit odd at age twenty when she left that world using a ritual from the Black family library to escape the loneliness and restrictions being placed on a pedestal had brought her. Now at twenty-five she’d practically be an old maid in their eyes.</p><p>	Surprisingly in this new dimension it was one of the few things that had stayed the same. She’d half wondered if they might not have soul mates at all here, but they did, and they found them in the same way, through the first words exchanged between them, though in this world at least, her not finding her soul mate wasn’t considered all that odd. Now if she ever reached forty here, then people might start looking at her oddly, but for now those that had inquired and heard she hadn’t met them yet simply patted her on the arm and told her to be patient.</p><p>	She didn’t bother telling them that she’d given up the idea of finding her soul mate when she traveled to this dimension, figuring she’d left them behind. She tried not to let that bother her though because really she was done living her life to the expectations of others including her soul mate, which was why she was keeping her metaphorical head down, even though the action was making her teeth grind in frustration and anger.</p><p>	The island she’d settled on, once she’d decided to stop island hopping and maybe settle for a while and perhaps find some friends to ease her aching loneliness, was a small one, with only three villages. She currently resided in the largest one, their port town, which was famous for its scotch.</p><p>	For the first few weeks it had been fine, peaceful and friendly, but then the pirates had come. From her solo exploration of the Grand Line she’d learned a lot about pirates and marines despite staying well out of their way as best she could. She knew there were some good and some bad. Unfortunately these were definitely the bad kind.</p><p>	New World pirates, unlike the pirates in the first half of the Grand Line, were as a whole extremely strong compared to others, admittedly the residents of the New World were pretty hardy themselves but not enough to stand up to these pirates. And the Navy didn’t have a very strong presence here in the New World so they couldn’t call for help. The usual course of action would generally be to call one of the Yonko as most of the islands they considered part of their “territory” and they would defend them, especially from other pirates if needed. Unfortunately this particular island was on the border between Big Mom and Shanks’ territories making it neutral ground.</p><p>	While this made it a rather peaceful place and more prosperous than most since they didn’t have to pay tribute to either Yonko, it also meant that the island didn’t have any means of contacting either of the emperors for help leaving them to attempt to deal with the pirate menace on their own.</p><p>	Luckily it seemed for the most part they only wanted tribute from the villagers and while it did make purses a little bit tighter nobody had been badly injured yet. Unfortunately she did believe it was a yet, as a server at a bar she’d gotten to see a good majority of the pirates for herself, and worse been subject of their attentions.</p><p>	She knew her body was extremely curvy, mostly because her early childhood malnutrition had stunted her growth, and then when she’d gotten healthy again, it had been too late to grow leaving her natural curves on a much more petite frame, but for the most part the eerie color of her eyes and the lightning scar across her face that had made her famous in her old world was more than enough to put men off.</p><p>	Not these men though. These men saw her petite curvy stature and her forcedly polite smile and thought it was an invitation, despite how many times she said she wasn’t interested.</p><p>	The pirates were rude, crude and had begun to smack people around, pushing them out of the way intimidating and threatening the locals with violence to get things at cheaper prices. They were thugs and scum, and she knew someday very soon they were going to push too far and someone was going to get badly hurt.</p><p>	Luckily today was almost over and she would be able to go home soon, take a nice relaxing bath, maybe drink some wine and not have to deal with them until morning, safe behind the impenetrable layers of wards that shielded her home against those with negative intentions.</p><p>	She was wiping down her last table, pointedly ignoring the pirates at a table in the corner who were leering at her when the door burst open with a bang that shook the small bar. Immediately all attention was on the newcomer, a merchant from the town named Zeel who sold odds and ends in his little second hand shop. He ignored the other patrons his frantic eyes finding that of her fellow server, who was just about to take over for her, a kind, friendly young woman named Tana who Iris had somewhat befriended, who’d shown her the ropes of the town and welcomed her with open arms.</p><p>	“Tana, the pirates have Ko, they say they’re going to kill him,” Zeel practically shouted to the room, his eyes wild with fear and desperation.</p><p>	Tana froze and turned white under her summer tan, “K-Kill him? But why? We haven’t done anything wrong! We paid all their tribute already this month.”</p><p>	“The kids were playing down by the docks as usual, when the pirates came through knocking them out of the way, one of the littler ones got trodden on, hand broken badly, and little Wren took issue with it, hitting the one responsible with the sticks they were playing with and shouting at him. He hit her back, knocked her hard, and Ko stepped in of course and things escalated and now they say they’re going to execute him to make an example!” Zeel babbled out hysterically.</p><p>	Tana swayed on her feet for a moment, pure horror on her face before bolting for the door. Iris couldn’t blame her, Wren was her daughter, just turned eight, adorable, quick-witted and fiercely loyal it didn’t surprise her at all that the little girl had stood up when one of her friends was hurt. Ko was her husband of ten years and her soul mate, the two had met when they were fourteen and had been love at first sight. They’d gotten married the day Tana turned eighteen and had Wren a year later. They loved each other fiercely with the kind of relationship that Iris had always wanted for herself. She’d been a bit envious of her new friend for that, knowing she would likely never have it.</p><p>	She couldn’t imagine losing that, she couldn’t imagine Tana without Ko, and she certainly couldn’t bear the thought of anyone hurting innocent little Wren who was sweet and charming and had taken to following her around sometimes as she did her shopping, pestering her for tales of adventures after she’d told her one of her own one day in the bar on a slow day to keep the child entertained while her mother worked.</p><p>	It seemed the day she’d been dreading had already come, and her feet were moving before she even thought it through and she found herself running hard towards the commotion. It was pretty easy to find, it seemed the pirates had decided to make spectacle of Ko and were using the town square to do it.</p><p>	She elbowed her way through the horrified crowd and winced in horror as she caught sight of him. Sure she’d seen worse during the war and after, but it had been a while and Ko was something of a friend as well. A regular at the bar where Tana worked, coming every day after he got off the fishing boats, often nursing a glass, or munching something from the kitchen, talking to everyone or telling stories to Wren, chatting away and sending fond looks at his wife and child.</p><p>	He was a good man, and he certainly didn’t deserve this, a face so swollen, beaten black and blue that he was barely recognizable, only on his feet thanks to the post he was tied to, legs at awkward angles and blood dripping everywhere. It was brutal, far more brutal than anything any of these townspeople had likely seen, and certainly more than poor Wren had ever seen, as she clutched her mother’s skirt terrified and sobbing as Tana herself begged the pirates and the Captain to stop, promising more money, her body, everything she owned, but please…</p><p>	It was enough to break anyone’s heart and certainly more than enough to shove her firmly over the line she’d been teetering on since the pirates arrived in the small town.</p><p>	Shoving her way into the open space that separated the pirates from the watching crowd, striding forward confidently and catching everyone’s attention, “Enough.”</p><p>	It wasn’t said loudly, but with a weight in it she’d learned after countless skirmishes with death eaters while leading her team of aurors, a tone meant to make them obey no matter how much they thought they knew better than their youngest member.</p><p>	It was enough to silence everything, the jeering pirates, the whispering crowd, and the begging Tana, all of whom turned to look at her with a mixture, of shock, horror, confusion, and disgust.</p><p>	“What was that little girl?” the Captain asked flatly his black eyes boring into hers brow twitching in annoyance. She’d only seen him a couple of times, but what she saw forcibly reminded her of Lucius Malfoy, pompous arrogant, and cold with a look in his eyes that let everyone who could interpret and recognize it know he’d killed and tortured without remorse.</p><p>	“I said that’s enough,” she repeated calmly, one hand resting at her side and the other propped on her hip, her stance relaxed but ready, “I think it’s time you took your crew and left little man.”</p><p>	She jabbed back at him, okay so she was a little sensitive about her height so sue her, and she wasn’t at all surprised when the scumbag threw his head back and laughed at her. After all these years she was pretty used to that reaction, garnered by everything from her age to her stature to her gender.</p><p>	“Little girl you’re either very brave or very stupid,” the Captain informed her a cold smirk on his face, “Don’t you know who I am?”</p><p>	“How could I not?” she asked rolling her eyes at him her tone intentionally provoking, “What with you and your men shouting it from the rooftops like it’s something to be proud of. Understandable though I suppose, since no one would’ve recognized a small time loser like you if they hadn’t.”</p><p>	“How impertinent, little girl I think you need to be taught some manners,” he informed her silkily taking a threatening step towards her.</p><p>	She was going to reply with something to the effect of ‘bring it on’ when rough hands grabbed her from behind hard enough to bruise. She immediately called herself a thousand kinds of idiot as Moody’s angry yell of “Constant Vigilance” echoed through her mind. She’d assumed everyone including the pirates had either gone into hiding or were in the town square when she arrived considering the commotion. A quick glance behind her showed her it was the pirates who’d been in the bar who’d probably been behind her the whole time who’d sneaked up and grabbed her. It was what she got for being so overconfident; forgetting those years of racing through dangerous wild islands was nothing like facing off against conniving humans.</p><p>	“Shall we take care of this one Cap? Been wanting to teach her a lesson myself, stubborn little cock tease that she is,” the one who grabbed her asked his breath near her face reeking of alcohol and sweat, apparently he wasn’t much bothered by personal hygiene.</p><p>	The Captain smiled coldly at them mocking eyes on her, making her temper, which was already close to the surface begin to boil, “Do as you like with her, make an example of her as well, I believe I have another offer to indulge.”</p><p>	He turned back towards Tana whose wide frightened eyes still held a well of determination even as she pushed Wren back behind her, away from the pirate, and Iris opened her mouth again using a tone she’d borrowed from the great Ferret himself, one that always got her steaming mad, “So you can’t even deal with me yourself? Guess I’d put up too much of a fight for a small time pirate like you, or is it that you’re small time all over?”</p><p>	The captain whirled back towards her, ice in his eyes even as a sharp pain made her realize her captor had released an arm and grabbed a knife jabbing it into her side, not enough to impale but enough to draw blood, “Now you really shouldn’t be speakin to the Cap that way darlin’ that’s no way to speak to a man.”</p><p>	“What man?” she asked giving the captain a pointed once over even as he stalked forward fury etched across his face, “I don’t see any man.”</p><p>	The slap wasn’t unexpected, even if it was hard enough to make her ears ring. It had accomplished what she wanted though, he was now away from Tana and close enough to attack without showing off her magic. She shook her head to clear it and make her ears stop ringing only to hear silence. She’d kind of expected him to be ranting at her, but when she looked up she saw he was looking elsewhere across the square.</p><p>	Standing there was a group of men she’d never seen before. Their leader had the brightest red hair she’d ever seen, the crimson more like blood than like the Weasley’s red-orange manes. He was wearing a dark cloak over his shoulders and a white long sleeved button down shirt that was left mostly open showing a nicely sculpted chest, and loose brown pants. He wore some kind of sword at his hip thrust through a bright red sash. His dark eyes were fixed on the captain holding her hostage and at his back several intimidating looking men with all kinds of weaponry stood eyeing the pirates that had invaded the town casually.</p><p>	“What did you say to me?” the Captain asked his attention entirely focused on the newcomer.</p><p>	“I said that’s really no way to treat a lady,” the redheaded man replied with a deceptively cheerful smile on his face, “You should really get your hearing checked you know, oh and never stand too close to cannons, causes hearing loss.”</p><p>	“The way I treat women is really none of your business Akagami no Shanks, and the bitch has it coming, but it’s surprising to see you here,” the Captain said leadingly.</p><p>	Iris glanced at the newcomer again in surprise, so this was Shanks? One of the four Yonko? She’d heard rumors about him, but never really bothered to look him up. Knowing she was going to be avoiding pirates meant she’d never really given him much thought. She wasn’t sure what she thought, but she knew a person wasn’t given the title of Yonko lightly.</p><p>	“Ah you see our ship was running low on booze and we were in the area. This place sells Benn’s favorite Scotch so we figured we’d swing by and get some,” the man, Shanks, explained with a casual shrug and a beaming smile.</p><p>	“All the better for me,” the Captain replied a wide slightly psychotic smile on his face, “You know I thought we’d have to hunt you down after we bled this little Podunk town dry, instead you came straight to us.”</p><p>	“Ah looking to challenge a Yonko huh? Well I haven’t had a good fight for a while I suppose I could indulge you,” the man replied casually shrugging out of his black cloak and tossing it at the taller black haired man standing to his right, “Here Benn hold this for a moment would you? Don’t want to get blood on the brand new cape.”</p><p>	The dark haired man, who had a cigarette dangling from his lips gave his Captain a flat look but accepted the garment, “Whatever just don’t take too long, you know the crew gets antsy when the booze gets low and I’ve been looking forward to a glass of that scotch myself.”</p><p>	“Sure, sure,” Shanks assured him casually turning back around to face his opponent.</p><p>	The man stared at the famed Yonko before a sneer overtook his face, “Really? And I thought this was going to be hard, didn’t know I’d be fighting a crip…gah.”</p><p>	His rant was cut short as his attention came back to Iris, who’d taken advantage of the pirate’s preoccupation with the Yonko and his crew to spring into action, stomping hard on the instep of her captor making him loosen his grip, and using a special twist Mooney had taught her to take the knife from him and break his wrist simultaneously, then buried the knife in the distracted Captain’s gut shoving it in and yanking upwards, slicing through vital organs before shoving him off the knife with her foot, using the momentum to swing herself around and slice at the man behind her who’d held her captive digging a deep gash across his chest. Ignoring the spray of blood as it spattered everywhere from using a knife in such close quarters.</p><p>	The man yelled out in surprise and pain before lunging at her. She ducked under his lunge lashing out with the knife again and catching him in the side as he went past, and suddenly she was surrounded by pirates, with weapons all looking to kill her. She dropped into what Moody had called battle mode.</p><p>	Using her enhanced senses, tasting vibrations in the air as the men moved around her, listening for the sound of their feet, the whoosh of their blades and their sharp breaths as she danced in and around them the knife in her hand quickly joined by a small, dirk that she wielded with practiced ease.</p><p>	And suddenly she wasn’t alone in her fight but joined by men she recognized who’d been standing behind the Yonko Shanks. They kept out of her way, and at the same time guarded her back, much to her surprise. In a few short minutes the pirates who’d invaded lay dead, and she slowly stood up from her crouch eyeing the pirates around her.</p><p>	The other townsfolk had apparently fled, all but Tana and Wren, who were huddled close to the post Ko was tied to, Tana pushing Wren’s face into her apron attempting to shield her from the mass carnage her eyes wide and terrified.</p><p>	“That was either the bravest of the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen,” a man with blonde dreadlocks held back by a band that read Yassop and two pistols in his hands told her a grin on his face.</p><p>	She raised an eyebrow at him then shrugged, “I’ve done worse.”</p><p>	He gaped at her for a moment the grinned wider, whatever he was about to say next though was interrupted by the tall dark haired man with the cigarette in his mouth, who hadn’t moved from where he stood, it appeared he and several others, including the Yonko himself hadn’t actually joined in the fight.</p><p>	“You know it’s rude to take out the man the Captain’s called dibs on,” he drawled, his voice nonthreatening, just pointing out facts, his eyes assessing her face.</p><p>	“Tch,” she scoffed bending over to wipe her blades clean on the shirt of one of the dead pirates, casually giving him her back as she inspected them and decided to keep the one she’d stolen from the man who’d held her captive, it was good quality, and discarding the other as trash, before turning back to him, “Considering it was me he slapped I’m pretty sure I’m the one who had dibs.”</p><p>	“Dahaha! You’re a brave little spitfire aren’t you little lady?” the redheaded Yonko asked, and her entire world froze as she slowly turned to look at him again.</p><p>	He’d moved a couple steps closer, and she could see his features better now, besides the blood red hair the most prominent one was his dancing cinnamon colored eyes, despite the three scars that raked directly over them. His face was strong, with a wide forehead and pointed nose, bright white teeth that flashed in a cheerful smile and a bit of scruff over his lip and on his cheeks and chin. His skin was tanned and a bit weather beaten, combined with the clothes and the cloak she dazedly thought he really did look like a stereotypical scruffy pirate captain, all he was missing was a hat and a parrot.</p><p>	She felt a little light headed and confused, because she’d really truly never expected to hear those words, she’d given up on them. Had maybe even given up on them before she even came to this world because she’d been raised to be Dumbledore’s martyr, and yet here she was, and here he was and all she could think to say was, “Sirius always did say you’d probably be a redhead, don’t think he was expecting a pirate though.”</p>
<p></p><div align="Center">
  <p>…~*O*~…</p>
</div>The day had started off well enough for Shanks, true they were much lower on booze than he liked to be at any given time, but the navigator had assured them they were close to an island. An island that apparently sold Benn’s favorite Scotch, the only kind of alcohol his first mate indulged in and then only rarely, downer that he was.<p>	He was kind of hoping the booze would get Benn off his back for a bit. Not that Benn wasn’t awesome, he was, he was his best friend, but he’d also turned into a bit of a mother hen after the Sea king ate his arm while he was out saving Luffy. Not that he regretted that, not a bit, he’d do it again if he had to, would lose both arms if it meant saving Luffy. Still ever since his first mate, actually his whole crew, had been extremely overprotective.</p><p>	He couldn’t blame them of course, losing a limb was a big deal and he was touched by their concern, but what’s done is done. He was just grateful it had been his left arm that was lost and not the right. Most would assume that was because he was right handed, but you know what they say about assuming and asses.</p><p>	Shanks was in fact ambidextrous, or at least he had been. It had been something of an ace in the hole for him all these years as the only one he’d met who’d lived after finding that information out was Hawkeye and it wasn’t like he was about to tell anyone, antisocial loner that he was.</p><p>	No the reason he’d been grateful to lose the left was because his right carried the words of the person he’d been waiting to meet for the last twenty or so years of his life. They started at the shoulder and spiraled down around his arm ending at his elbow and read “Sirius always did say you’d be a redhead, don’t think he was expecting a pirate though,” in a barely legible scrawl.</p><p>	He’d spent a lot of time pondering what kind of woman would say his words to him, and he was sure it was a woman though for the life of him he couldn’t tell you how. He wondered who the hell Sirius was and if maybe he should be jealous, and how he’d known what color his hair was. He’d also wondered how she figured out he was a pirate, as he liked to think he didn’t behave like a stereotypical one, but then his fame had risen exponentially in the last few years and he now had a good idea.</p><p>	He wondered what she looked like, short, tall, skinny, curvy, redheaded, blonde, brunette or even something more exotic? He’d had a lot of daydreams, but never really anything concrete. The only thing he was sure of was that she’d have to be fiery, because a stubborn fiery personality was what it would take to keep him interested and in line as it were.</p><p>	The arrival at their destination shook him out of his thoughts and he happily jumped over the side of the ship and on to the dock, landing lightly on the balls of his feet. A soft thump behind him alerted him to another presence and he grinned over at Benn who was giving him a disapproving look, “You could wait for us you know.”</p><p>	But Shanks was completely ignoring him, glancing around the dock he noticed an eerie stillness. Docks were usually pretty bustling places especially this time of day when fisherman were returning and the sun was setting. The empty docks coupled with lack of people sent an intense shock of déjà vu through him, it was exactly like Fuusha when Luffy was being held captive by bandits.</p><p>	Instinct had him striding forward towards the center of town with nary a word to his crew. He could hear Benn asking questions then shouting orders behind him, and knew they’d follow very quickly. Using his observation haki it wasn’t hard to find the source of the empty docks.</p><p>	A gathering was happening in what looked like the town square. He arrived through a small back alley and took in the scene. Tied to a decorative post near the center of the square was a man who looked so beat he was nearly dead, and with a woman and child standing close by staring at something in the center of the crowd, looks of terror and awe on their faces.</p><p>	Luckily people tended to move out of the way once they noticed he wanted through, either recognizing him from his bounty posters or responding to the menacing aura he knew he was giving off thanks to the familiar feel of the scene. He could hear a female voice bantering with a low male one, and he grinned in spite of himself, she apparently really knew how to upset the guy.</p><p>	He finally made it to the front of the crowd just as a loud smack echoed throughout the square. Taking in the scene he noticed a group of dirty men, who looked the stereotypical ragtag pirate scum, at the center. One of which, the biggest and ugliest was holding a small woman.</p><p>	She was the one who’d been hit, judging by the way her head was turned to the side and the bright angry mark on her face. Fury raced through him as the image of an even smaller boy was superimposed over the woman and he couldn’t help himself, he intervened.</p><p>	He handed off his coat to Benn acknowledging his presence and prepared to slaughter the scumbags. He wasn’t at all surprised the captain thought it would be easy. It was a reaction he knew he’d have to deal with for a while until he proved to the world he could still be a Yonko one armed. That didn’t mean it didn’t sting a little.</p><p>	What did surprise him was the tiny little woman gutting the man like a fish. He watched in shock as the woman he’d thought of as helpless like Luffy tore through New World pirates with practiced ease. His own men, not wanting to stand around and do nothing, quickly joined in, but he couldn’t bring himself to take his eyes off the small woman reaping bloody carnage.</p><p>	“That’s certainly impressive,” Benn told him quietly, as the last of the pirate thugs were finished off and the woman stood not even breathing heavily with nary a scratch on her. Shanks nodded intrigued, not at all surprised that Benn had stayed at his side, watching his back.</p><p>	He was even more impressed with the way she bantered back and forth with Benn and Yassop completely unafraid of them despite knowing how dangerous they must be. She didn’t feel threatened at all, not even when Benn’s words could’ve been construed as threatening. She was such a fiery little thing, he couldn’t help himself, he laughed, “You’re a brave little spitfire aren’t you?”</p><p>	He was surprised to see the woman stiffen, the first sign of unease she’d shown before turning to look at him head on. She looked dazed, her features shocked as she gave him an obvious once over, and he wondered quietly if she too was off put by the lack of his arm like the pirate captain had been until she opened her mouth and said the words he’d been waiting to hear, “Sirius always did say you’d be a redhead, don’t think he was expecting a pirate though.”</p><p>	Oh, oh, no wonder she was gaping like a fish. His mind went blank as he took several hesitant steps toward her and catalogued her features. He’d noted she was short, she’d likely fit just under his chin, but her curves were extraordinarily generous, the perfect hourglass. She had a dark head of riotous waves and curls that hung to her waist framing a small delicate looking face covered in porcelain skin.</p><p>	Her eyes were the most riveting shade of green he’d ever seen, so much so that it took him a minute to see past them and to the scar that covered the entirety of her face, from sloped forehead to pouty coral lips. It was like a bolt of lightning had come down and left an impression of itself across her face, with tiny wispy strikes giving her skin an interesting texture.</p><p>	Maybe for some it might’ve been off-putting, but Shanks found it beautiful. He’d always loved the wild freedom of storms, and her scar reminded him of war paint. She was a vicious little green eyed lightning goddess.</p><p>	His shaky steps brought him with reach of her and a hand extended towards her for a second before coming back to his side as he realized he only had one arm to reach for her with, and he wasn’t sure if she’d like that.</p><p>	Iris saw his belated attempt to reach her, and picked up the spasm of uncertainty that had crossed his face. She wasn’t the type of person who could reach out to others easily despite being affection starved, both aftereffects of the Dursley’s upbringing. This was different though, this was her soulmate the one person in the world that was meant only for her, the one person she thought she’d never meet, the one person whose existence meant that throughout her years in her world despite everything she never felt truly alone.</p><p>	She took the last step forward and wrapped her arms around him. He stiffened for a moment, and she wondered if she’d read him wrong only to feel him relax a second later and wrap his arm around her in return, holding her nearly too tightly.</p><p>	Not quite her normal, logical self she tilted her head up and pressed her face into the crook of his neck. He smelled good, like sandalwood, sea, cigarette smoke and something entirely masculine and entirely him. With the way he was holding them so tightly together she could feel every dip of chiseled muscle beneath his shirt.</p><p>	She felt strange in his grasp, and it took her a good long while to identify the feeling. She felt safe with him, how strange. She’d never felt safe before, at least not completely, not like this. A part of her wanted to rebel, having a soul mate shouldn’t make her like this, shouldn’t change her into someone who trusted so easily, her self-preservation instincts were practically screaming at her calling her ten kinds of fool. </p><p>	However she had always been a risk taker, it was the reason she was a Gryffindor instead of a Slytherin despite having the traits of both, and that part followed her gut, which told her if she wasn’t safe with her soul mate then there was no place in the world she could be safe.</p><p>	Shanks was surprised that she’d reached for him back, that she’d taken that last step of her own freewill and was willing to hold him like this. He’d been right in his assessment earlier, she was just tall enough to tuck under his chin when he held her, the perfect height.</p><p>	Despite seeing her fight earlier, knowing she was extremely dangerous and capable she still felt fragile and small in his grasp and his hold unconsciously tightened. He’d been waiting for this, for so long he’d been waiting, and now he had her he wasn’t about to let her go.</p><p>	A clearing throat had both of them pulling back to see all the crew watching them with either curious or amused looks on their faces, “Dahaha sorry guess we got caught up crew! Meet soul mate, uh, er, um, what’s your name miss?”</p><p>	“Iris, Potter J. Iris,” she told him feeling uncharacteristically shy	.</p><p>	“Iris!” he repeated joyfully, saying the name slowly in his mind, savoring it before turning to his crew, “Crew this is Iris, Iris this is crew!”</p><p>	“Shanks you have to give the girl more than that,” Benn told his captain exasperated even as he studied the shell shocked woman, apparently a Yonko and his crew didn’t even phase her, but finding her soulmate certainly had. Not that he could blame her, it certainly wasn’t something one experienced often, especially not with someone like Shanks.</p><p>	Luckily she proved before she’d spoken to the captain that she had plenty of spunk otherwise Benn would’ve been concerned Shanks would steamroller right over her. He may have been his captain and best friend but Benn knew better than anyone that Shanks could be a bit much. He just hoped she didn’t let him get away with too much.</p><p>	The fact that she was welcome wasn’t even a question. She was the captain’s soul mate, and he knew Shanks was more anxious than most to meet his. Of course he too had seen the captain’s atypical moment of self-doubt, and was gratified she’d rectified it, comforting Shanks seemingly without even thinking about it, for that alone even if she’d been a spineless fool he would’ve welcomed her.</p><p>	“I’m Benn, Beckman the first mate, the guy with the blonde dreads is Yassop, the one with the meat in hand is Lucky Roo, the redhead to my left is Rockstar, the man with the Monkey is Meaka, the blonde is out Doctor whose name is pretty much unpronounceable so we call him Doc, and the man with the dragon tattoo is Cookie,”<br/>
he told her pointing to each in turn, “The others are on the ship, we can introduce them later.”</p><p>	Gathering herself Iris bowed politely to them, “It’s a pleasure to meet you, please take care of me.”</p><p>	A soft groan and a gasp from behind had the pirates and Iris redirecting their attention to the civilians still in the square. It seemed Ko had awoken and caught Tana’s attention, and she turned to worriedly fuss over him, looking frantic, and who could blame her, the man looked terrible.</p><p>	Iris quickly strode forward distracted from her soul mate and taking charge, “Tana, Ko needs a doctor, we’ll need to find him one, I know you want to take him down from there, but shifting might cause any floating ribs to puncture something.”</p><p>	Tana glanced at her and nodded, hurriedly gathering herself only to be interrupted, “Doc can take a look if you ladies don’t mind.”</p><p>	It seemed her soul mate had stepped in to save the day once more. Iris glanced at Tana, “It’s your choice Tana, but my advice is to let him. I really doubt the doctor in town has experience with these kinds of injuries and it wouldn’t surprise me if a pirate doctor saw them daily.”</p><p>	The tough civilian woman bit her lip, but steeled herself and turned to the pirates, she’d begged before for Ko’s life from the evil pirates, asking these new ones to save it wasn’t so different, and so she bowed low, “Please help us.”</p><p>	“No need for that ma’am,” the one called Doc told her, his voice was gruff but his tone was gentle, “Let me see what I can do. Might want to get the little one away though, just in case.”</p><p>	“I’m not going anywhere!” Wren shouted, apparently finding her courage in the face of these fierce looking strangers, “This is all my fault. If I hadn’t provoked them, if he hadn’t hit me, daddy would still, would still…”</p><p>	She trailed off looking ready to burst into tears. Tana looked torn obviously wanting to stay with her husband, but not wanting her daughter to see and know the extent of his injuries. </p><p>	“I’ve got it Tana,” Iris muttered quietly to her friend who nodded grateful.</p><p>	So saying she scooped up the eight-year-old and slung her over her shoulder. The girl was shocked, but then began to try to protest, tears spilling over as she kicked and flailed in Iris’ firm grasp.</p><p>	“Enough Wren-wren, we’re not going far, just over there into the alley so you can still be close by, you and I need to chat little birdie,” Iris told her firmly. The girl stilled at the firm tone and went limp sobbing into Iris’ back.</p><p>	“Can I borrow a couple of you for a moment? She’s eight, she really doesn’t need to see or hear anything more today,” Iris asked the pirates.</p><p>	The one called Yassop and Shanks immediately agreed and blocked the end of the alley so Wren couldn’t see the doctor operating on her father.</p><p>	“Thank you,” she told them gently depositing her burden on the ground so her back was to the men and the scene of the bloody massacre, receiving two solemn nods in return.</p><p>	She set a firm hand on the girl’s small shoulders and using the other to tilt her chin up so she was forced to look her in the eye, “You need to listen to me Wren, are you listening?”</p><p>	The child nodded, tears and snot dribbling down her face in rivers but her eyes firmly locked on Iris’ face, “None of what happened today was your fault.”</p><p>	“But I did it! I hit the pirate and then daddy was fighting and he got hurt,” Wren told her miserably.</p><p>	“You did hit the pirate, but that was because he hurt one of your friends first, or at least that’s what I heard…?” Iris trailed off expectantly.</p><p>	“We were playing,” Wren explained wretchedly, “Me and Meeko and Shin, and Beena and some others, waiting for daddy and his friends to come back with fish and the Captain pushed us over he, stepped on us, and he broke Meeko’s hand! Meeko’s three!”</p><p>	“So I hit him, I hit him with my stick to get him off Meeko because Meeko was crying and he wasn’t moving off his hand! He moved then but then he hit me! Right here,” she told the older woman rubbing her belly and wincing at the tenderness, “He hit it really hard and I flew back and hit a house and then he was coming towards me to hit me some more but then Daddy was there, he was hitting the Captain, shouting at him to pick on someone his own size.”</p><p>	“The Captain shouted for his crew and they started hitting and kicking my daddy! I couldn’t stop them. I tried really hard, but then they were taking him away and then Momma was there and she was crying, and then you came and he hit you too and it’s all my fault!” the little girl wailed pitifully.</p><p>	“Wren, you only hit that man because he was hurting Meeko right?” Iris confirmed gently, getting the girl to nod miserably.</p><p>	“Then you did nothing wrong. There is absolutely nothing wrong with trying to protect your friends. It sounds to me like you were very brave,” Iris assured her gently running a soothing hand through Wren’s hair.</p><p>	“But if I hadn’t, then everyone would’ve been okay!” Wren protested sadly.</p><p>	“That’s not true,” Iris rebuked immediately, “Meeko certainly still wouldn’t be okay, he might’ve even been hurt worse if you hadn’t intervened.”</p><p>	Wren tried to protest again but Iris continued on firmly, “Listen to me Wren, there are people in this world who are awful, terrible human beings. People who like to hurt others, who think that it’s fun, or funny, who enjoy it. That man was one of them. He and the entirety of his scumbag crew were the kind of people who didn’t care for others at all. One way or another, from the moment he and the rest came here someone was going to get hurt, for one reason or another. Even if no one had done anything wrong, they would’ve found a reason to hurt someone.”</p><p>	“If it wasn’t you and your daddy and Meeko today, it would’ve been some other child, some other daddy or mommy tomorrow. Do you understand?” Iris asked gently. </p><p>	“I know it’s hard to see it this way sweetie, but what happened today was probably for the best,” Iris continued as Wren hesitated, “Your daddy is probably really glad he was there today, he got to protect you, that’s a daddy’s job after all, to protect their children. If that man had hurt you, had killed you, both your mommy and daddy would’ve been devastated.”</p><p>	“I bet if we asked him, despite how much he’s hurting your daddy would tell you he would do it again if he had to, see your daddy is one of the good ones, the ones that love their friends and family, both your parents would happily die for you, because that’s what good parents do,” Iris assured her.</p><p>	“And if it hadn’t been your daddy who was hurt, no one would’ve come to get your mommy, and if no one had come to get your mommy I wouldn’t have known to come, and if I hadn’t come that man might’ve hurt you or your mommy,” Iris persisted.</p><p>	“But then he hurt you instead!” Wren whimpered unhappily.</p><p>	“And that’s okay, because unlike you, or your mommy and daddy I can take it. Weren’t you listening when I told you my stories? I’m a brave adventurer remember? Something like a little slap wasn’t going to slow me down, and frankly I was more than a match for those pirates little birdie I just needed the right motivation to take them down,” Iris told her gently.</p><p>	“Did you fight them too Iris?” Wren asked.</p><p>	“I did,” Iris confirmed with a gentle smile for the child, “I don’t like to fight if I don’t have to, but if someone hurts my friends of course I fight back to protect them. Hurting people for the sake of hurting people is never okay little birdie, but sometimes you have to hurt others to protect the people you love.”</p><p>	“What you did today was protect the people you love, and that’s okay. I’m proud of you for it, and I’m sure your mommy and daddy are too even if they wish you would be more careful so you don’t get yourself hurt.”</p><p>	Iris caught the little girl as she launched herself forward and wrapped her small body tightly around her, squeezing tightly sobbing into her shoulder. Iris rocked her, humming soothingly and running gentle hands through her hair until she sobbed herself out laying limply against her but clinging tightly nonetheless.</p><p>	“How’s it going over there?” Iris asked glancing up at the two men who’d turned away to give her and the child the illusion of privacy.</p><p>	“Not bad I don’t think,” Shanks told her solemnly turning back to look at her and offering a hesitant smile, “The Doc isn’t cursing as bad now, and it looks like things are stabilizing over there. I think your friend is going to be fine.”</p><p>	“That’s good news,” she told them, climbing to her feet with Wren still wrapped securely in her arms.</p><p>	“You were real good with the little ‘un,” Yassop told her with an admiring smile, “You ever thought about having some tykes of your own?”</p><p>	Iris looked at him startled, but seeing the interested look on Shanks’ face decided frank honesty in this case was probably the best policy, “To be one hundred percent honest, I hadn’t ever really thought about it. I never thought I’d live long enough to meet my soul mate let alone have children.”</p><p>	Seeing the striken looks on both their faces she hastily explained, “I’m not sick or anything, but I grew up in a really dangerous environment, there was a war and well, no one goes into war expecting to come out the other side unscathed.”</p><p>	Both men nodded solemnly, though they looked incredibly concerned, which if she was honest with herself was more than a bit heartwarming. She couldn’t remember the last time someone had looked at her with concern for her wellbeing.</p><p>	Luckily they didn’t have time to ask any questions that she wasn’t sure how to answer, as the Doc proclaimed surgery was over, and Ko was going to live. She moved out from behind the two men, still carrying Wren, to see they’d fashioned a stretcher for him, and Tana was going to direct them to her house.</p><p>	She came along with them, listening as the doctor briefed Tana about the things she’d need to do to make sure Ko made a full recovery, asking the pertinent questions when it seemed Tana was either too intimidated or overwrought to do so.</p><p>	The journey to their home was a quick one, and she followed the procession inside, taking the familiar route to Wren’s room, and depositing her bundle, who’d passed out from emotional exhaustion the minute she’d learned her dad was going to be okay, into the bed, gently removing her shoes and tucking her under the covers, pressing a light kiss to her forehead before heading out the door again.</p><p>	She was stopped before she could leave by Tana who nearly bowled her over, hugging her tightly and thanking her over and over as she cried into her shoulder. Patiently Iris rocked the woman just like she had Wren and soothed her until she was calm again. She’d had a lot of practice during the war doing this for men, women and children alike and she liked to think she was damned good at it by now.</p><p>	“So what are you going to do now?” Tana asked after blowing her nose into the spare handkerchief Iris had given her.</p><p>	“What do you mean?” Iris asked evasively.</p><p>	“You know what I mean,” Tana scolded her firmly, “Just because I was caught up in Ko and Wren doesn’t mean I didn’t see you find your soul mate. Do you think you’ll be leaving us then?”</p><p>	“I don’t know,” Iris told her with a shrug, “I’d never put to much thought into what would happen if I found my soul mate, now that I have I’m at a bit of a loss. I mean I don’t know what I was expecting with the whole soul mate thing, but it certainly wasn’t a Yonko level pirate captain.”</p><p>	“I suppose you’ll just have to sit him down and have a conversation with him,” Tana told her shrewdly, “That’s the best way, figure out what you both want out of the relationship and see if you can figure out a compromise you can both live with. That’s the key really, to a good relationship, or at least that’s what my mother told me, and it seemed to have worked well enough for Ko and I.”</p><p>	“Sound advice I think,” Iris smiled at her, “Thank you for your help Tana, and your kindness.”</p><p>	“Please, you saved our lives today, don’t think I don’t know it, this is the least of what I can do for you, besides I’m not actually too worried about you and your pirate captain, from what I could see before the two of you were getting on just fine, and if nothing else at least he’s easy on the eyes,” the cheerful woman told her with a lewd wink.</p><p>	“Tana!” Iris protested with a laugh.</p><p>	“What?” the woman teased lightly, “I have eyes, and I’m married not dead! Either way, I won’t keep you any longer, go get that pirate captain of yours, and Iris?”</p><p>	“Yes?” she asked confused at Tana’s sudden serious expression.</p><p>	“If you do decide to leave make sure you come say goodbye first and I want you to know you always have a place to come back to if things don’t go the way you want them to,” the other woman told her solemnly, “We may not have known each other very long, but I still think of you as a dear friend and want you to be happy no matter what form that happiness takes.”</p><p>	“Thank you,” Iris told her impulsively leaning forward to hug her fellow waitress and receiving a tight squeeze in return, touched by Tana’s words and her sincerity, “It means a lot to me. I promise I’ll come see you again if I decide to go with him.”</p><p>	“Good! Wren would be heartbroken if she didn’t get to say goodbye,” Tana told her firmly, “Now go out there and get your man!”</p><p>	Iris laughed and allowed herself to be shooed out the door, to where Shanks, Yassop, Benn Beckman, and the one who’d been introduced as Lucky Roo stood waiting. The others having apparently gone off somewhere once they saw that Ko, Tana and Wren were settled.</p><p>	“Do you have somewhere we could go to talk?” Shanks asked her, his eyes betraying the nerves they were both feeling about this upcoming conversation about their future, “If not we can go to the Red Force, I just thought maybe you’d like somewhere you’re more familiar with?”</p><p>	“We can go to my home,” she told him her voice calm despite her sweaty palms, “If that’s alright with you?”</p><p>	“Whatever makes you most comfortable,” he assured her a genuine smile on his face.</p><p>	She couldn’t help smiling back at him, “Alright, home it is, follow me please.”</p><p>	She turned and was more than a bit surprise to feel a large calloused hand intertwine itself with hers, jumping slightly at the contact. Out of the corner of her eye she could see the slightly hesitant expression on Shanks face melt away as she laced her fingers tightly with his.</p><p>	Whatever the outcome of this conversation was, she was sure she could handle it. After all she was Iris Jesse Potter! And besides, the only thing she had been afraid of with her soul mate was that they might reject her. </p><p>Shanks seemed to want her, and with any luck he wouldn’t mind her baggage or her powers. Considering he was a Yonko with an apparently newly missing arm, she was sure he came with some of his own, so she figured the odds were pretty good.</p><p>The sheer trust he offered her already, by allowing her to latch on to his only hand, and first means of defense meant that for the first time in a long time she was feeling pretty damn optimistic. For once it seemed like maybe fate might be in her favor.</p>
