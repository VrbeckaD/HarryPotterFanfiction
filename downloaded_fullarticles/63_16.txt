    <p>"Sneak a lust potion into her butterbeer at the Slug Club meeting." Sirius winked at his friends. "Then she'll be yours all night, James." </p><p>James and Sirius laughed, but Peter just raised an eyebrow. "You actually want to give her a potion so you can fuck her?" </p><p>"It would work." Sirius nudged Peter. "Thinking of trying it out on someone, Wormtail?" </p><p>Peter shook his head. "No." </p><p>James got up to leave for the bathroom. </p><p>"Should try it on James and Lily. He's dying to get her into bed." Sirius teased. "If it works, then you can test it out next." Though Sirius nudged him and laughed, Peter did not.</p><center>

</center><p>Peter Pettigrew took a potion from a cabinet. "That looks nice. It's perfect. Knew it would be." He eagerly searched for another potion and held it and smirked. “Yes, perfect. Black's idea will work out well.” </p><p>Peter took out two butterbeers and poured in one of the potions as he laughed to himself. He then poured a second potion in them. As he scurried to the Slug Club room, he chuckled to himself. Once he was in the room, he tiptoed over to the group of butterbeers that were awaiting the Slug Club members when they had their meeting in the morning. He removed the bottle with Lily's name and her name tag and placed it on the laced butterbeer and then he did the same with James’s bottle and tag. As Peter put James's name on his bottle, he heard footsteps outside. He snickered to himself and scuttled away from the room. </p><p>The following morning, Slughorn came in the room and as he sat down, he knocked a few bottles over, and their name tags off them. He picked them up and randomly put names back, assuming it did not matter anyway. He only put names on them to make sure everyone got one. As he put a name on the last bottle that had fallen over, his club members entered.<br/>
Peter waited outside of the doorway for Slughorn to hand out the beers for his club. James kept looking over at Lily. Peter hoped James and Lily would soon be infatuated with one another and they would end up in bed. James wanted her. He deserved her. They deserved each other. They were stag and doe. They were perfect for each other and he just wanted to help them get together finally. </p><p>"Okay, Ms. Evans, why don't you help hand out my drinks?"</p><p>Lily heard her name and got up to help her professor hand out the drinks.</p><p>"One more person." Slughorn looked around the room. "How about um, Mr. Snape? Help out with the drinks."</p><p>Severus looked up. Great. He thought. He set his book down. "Fine." He got up and went to the front of the room. Lily and Severus ignored each other and took a handful of drinks and began to hand them out.</p><p>Lily put the one with James's name in front of him. He smiled at her. She gave him a small smile back and handed a Ravenclaw next to him his drink. Lily moved to the other side and handed some of the Slytherins their bottles.</p><p>"I don't want this, the mudblood touched it."</p><p>Lily saw Severus look up when the word was mentioned, but he turned away and handed someone a bottle. She ignored the word as well and handed the boys their bottles. She set Severus's bottle on his desk and moved on without glancing at him. Severus handed a Hufflepuff her bottle and as he turned around, James took his foot and nearly tripped Severus.</p><p>"Quite clumsy, aren't you, Snivellus." James snapped quietly. "Watch your step. Wouldn't want anyone to slip on the grease you'd leave when you hit the ground."</p><p>Severus gave James a murderous glare. "You watch it, Potter. You'll pay one day." He hissed quietly.</p><p>Severus turned and set a bottle at Lily's place as a couple people sniggered at his near fall. Lily sat back down, and Severus did not see her smile. He guessed Lily must have missed the incident or he was certain she would be laughing too. Severus moved back to his seat beside a girl from Hufflepuff who was talking to another girl in Ravenclaw.</p><p>"Bottoms up." Slughorn said and sat back down. Everyone moved around the room to get refreshments.</p><p>Lily started to drink her bottle and noticed something odd. It tasted fine, but it smelled different. It smelled like peppermint and morning dew on the grass and the riverbank back home. It made her a little homesick. She smelled a boiling cauldron and some scent she could not put her finger on. Oddly enough, she could smell the Hogwarts Library with its slight potpourri and ink aroma. It smelled like someone familiar, but she could not place a finger on that either.</p><p>Severus took his bottle and took a sip and noticed it was odd smelling. It smelled like cinnamon, the dew that came from the morning grass, the riverbank back home and it had a flowery smell to it. There was a strange smell in it he could not explain, but sensing it made him crazy. He could sense the smell of the school's library as well. The potpourri and ink that comforted him. He sighed. It smelled like Lily. He really was losing it. They were not friends anymore. Any day now she would agree to date James and they would be together. He hoped secretly that when he became a Death Eater, she would see how good it was and how he would protect her and she would see how powerful and strong he could be. He was not just some poor, greasy-haired git who was constantly bullied and studied all the time. He could be strong and manly. He could be better than James. It was all a dream though. He had a snowballs chance in hell of being with her. She would not want him when she had someone has perfect and wonderful as James Potter fancying her? Why would she pick him over someone as rich, handsome, smart, athletic and popular as Potter?</p><p>He took another few sips and an odd sensation burning through his body. Part of him began to panic. It tasted fine, but maybe it was poisoned? No, that couldn't be it. He would not feel so well if he had and he the sensation was oddly wonderful. His heart began to pound and his body pulsated strangely.</p><p>"Everyone off to the carriages if you are leaving! Have a good holiday!" Slughorn called out.</p><p>An old sensation raced and burned through her body. Was her drink poisoned? No, that could not be it when she the sensation was so oddly wonderful. Her heart began pounding in her chest. Her body pulsated bizarrely. What was wrong with her? She looked around the room, desperate to find someone, some person. Her eye caught Severus and her body throbbed with infatuation. She needed him. It was him she loved; she knew it.</p><p>A powerful throbbing sensation raced through his body. He caught Lily's glaring eyes and though she always made his heart skip a beat, it was ready to burst out of his chest. He tried to calm himself, control himself, but something was off. He had to have her. He had to talk to her. He loved her so deeply. They exited the room and Severus desired to catch her. To his surprise, she was waiting for him in the hallway.</p><p>0o0o0o</p><p>Lily grabbed Severus by his robes, which startled him, and pulled him into an empty hallway. "I think I'm love with you." Her heart raced so fast she thought it would explode.</p><p>"I always loved you, but I am madly so right now. I want to hold you and never let you go, ever."</p><p>"Then don't."</p><p>She pulled him into a closet and kissed his lips. Hot damn! Severus thought. He had never kissed anyone before and they both giggled in nervousness as they practiced. He just wanted to grab her and never let her go. She felt the same. They had no idea what was going on at all. All they knew was they were in love somehow. After ten minutes, they forced themselves to stop touching and kissing each other.</p><p>"I am going to be late." Lily said.</p><p>"For what? Are you leaving? Please don't love, I mean, leave, leave me here alone. I need you."</p><p>"No. I'm head girl, I must stay here at school. I must leave soon though. I have to go do my round." She kissed him again. "But I dont want to leave. I love you too much."</p><p>They gave each other one last, long kiss before prying themselves apart unhappily.</p><p>Lily could only think of Severus the rest of the day. She could hardly eat lunch. She doodled on her parchment and wrote out her obsessed love for him.</p><p>Severus only thought of Lily and could not concentrate on his book. He though be was going to go crazy without her. He needed her and he had no idea why.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Avery asked Severus at the same time Remus asked Lily in their common rooms.</p><p>"Wonderful." They both replied in their obsessed thoughts of the other.</p><p>Lily sighed to herself.</p><p>"Are you in love?" Remus asked.</p><p>"Yes. I am in love with him. I need him."</p><p>"You need him?"</p><p>"Yes. I can't stand it."</p><p>"Have you lost your mind?"</p><p>"Maybe. Love makes you crazy, I guess." She sighed and her heart fluttered. "I can't do any work. I need to find him. Yes, I must see him." She got up and left the tower, desperate for Severus.</p><p>Severus looked at Avery, who was looking at him as if he had lost his marbles. "What's the matter, Snape? You act like you are in love?"</p><p>"I think I love her. Yes, I do love her. I need her."</p><p>"Please. You don't love her. It's just your hormones. Just go shag her. You'll feel better afterwards. If you can't, just take care of it yourself. I'll lend you my Witch's House magazine if you want."</p><p>Severus looked at Avery confused and bit back the lashing words that he currently thought. He did not care about Avery. He did love Lily. He loved her to bits. He had to have her, had to love her all he could. He would burst if he did not get to love her more. He left the bowels of the castle to search for Lily.</p><p>Finally, that evening before dinner, Severus snagged Lily in the hallway and into an empty classroom, kissing her with fervour. She gave equal fervour back. Severus grabbed her buttocks hard, pulled her close to him and he never wanted to remove his hands from her again. He never knew he could have such bravado. She did not do anything and he in turn found his buttocks being grabbed. Lily wondered if she was going mad. Why did she love him so much? She had no idea, but she did and that was all she knew.</p><p>Severus and Lily ended up making out until dinner. After dinner, they meet privately in the courtyard and it seemed all hell broke loss between them after one simple kiss on the lips. They lost control, completely infatuated with the other. Severus grabbed her robes at the shoulder blades, and she moaned as they kissed. Lily gripped his robes at the back and moved as close to him as she could. She wanted him so bad and she had no clue what suddenly brought that on. She groped him and he moaned and clutched her breasts. Lily moaned and pulled him to her until she was pressed against him. His hands grabbed her by her haunches through her robes. They were losing all self-control and were happy about it.</p><p>"Let's go to the tower. The others are all home. We'd be alone."</p><p>"Yes, please."</p><p>"Race you." Lily said, not losing her playful self even with the haze of the fanatic love that clouded her thoughts. They entered the common room. It was empty. She took him up to the dorm and shut the door.</p><p>"I thought you couldn't have boys in your dorm?"</p><p>"If I invite them in personally, then yes they can. Boys can't enter the room on their own. Old-fashioned, yes, but honestly, probably safer. I invited you, brought you here so you can be in my dorm."</p><p>He pulled her to the wall, and they made out. She started to lift his robes. His body throbbed with desire for her. They pulled off each other’s robes and got into her bed. They were both uneasy as they laid there in their undergarments, but the haze of the infatuation seemed to help them loosen up quickly. They wanted each other too much to let nerves stop them.</p>
