    <p>The library was filled with people, but Madeline Green knew exactly where to look in order to find him. She had been watching the boy for some time now, and she had decided that the time to confront him had come. So she chose an afternoon in which the Marauders where all engaged in some activities, and headed to the first floor. She looked extremely good that day; the truth was: she always looked good. She was beautiful. Every single male glance told her so. Even Professor Rathbone’s stare told her so.<br/>
She smiled inwardly, glad that her good looks could help her with her mission.<br/>
Everybody turned to look at the gorgeous Gryffindor when she entered the library and smiled at Madame Pince. Then, the girl crossed the room and went to a deserted part of it, where only a boy was reading some potions book. His dark black hair hid his pale, long face. Madeline sighed deeply, and put on her most fascinating smile.<br/>
“Hey Snape”<br/>
The Slytherin looked at her, shocked, and then raised an eyebrow “Hey?” he said, tentatively.<br/>
Madeline sat in front of him, while smiling confidently.<br/>
“How are you?”<br/>
He was taken aback, for he stared at her for a long time before answering. “Fine… I guess. Why?”<br/>
She shrugged “I was only trying to make conversation.”<br/>
“Well, now that you have, tell me what you want” he told her, icily.<br/>
Madeline kind of enjoyed that. Usually, boys used to treat her with extreme kindness. She didn’t mind his roughness.<br/>
Sne knitted her brows “How do you know I want something?”<br/>
Snape looked disgusted. “Well, let’s see. We’ve been in the same class for six years, yet you never talked to me. Plus, you’re best friends with Potter and his lackeys. I’m not stupid, y’know.”<br/>
“I know” she said, smirking “And don’t act innocent. You’ve never talked to me either.”<br/>
He blushed at that, and pointed his black eyes to his book. “Well, why would I?” he asked, as if implying she wasn’t someone easy to talk to.<br/>
“Oh, you think I’m a bitch, don’t you?” she said, laughing.<br/>
She expected him to deny that, yet he stood there, looking at his book, not answering.<br/>
“Hey!” she said then, “You don’t even know me! How could you think that?”<br/>
Snape shrugged “You act just like your friends. Arrogant, confident. Like the whole world’s there for you.” He looked at her “It’s not. I loathe Gryffindors. That’s it. Why do you think I ever thought about talking to the most popular one?” he spat out.<br/>
“Wow… You certainly know how to wound someone, don’t you?” she said, then, “Look, Snape. I want something, that’s true. But I’ll give you something back. And you’ll enjoy this, hopefully.”<br/>
They stared at each other for some time, and eventually “So?” he asked, curiosity taking the better of him.<br/>
“I want you to be my boyfriend.”<br/>
“WHAT?” he said, shocked “What sort of prank is this?”<br/>
“Hey chill… No prank. The thing is: I want James and Sirius to suffer for what they did to me. And nothing, NOTHING, would make them suffer as much as me hooking up with their worst enemy.”<br/>
Snape blushed at that.<br/>
“I… I don’t believe you. What did they do to you?”<br/>
“I can’t tell you”<br/>
“Then I won’t help you”<br/>
“Hey, Snape, look. You’ll take your revenge on them, too. You know how much they’ll hate the situation? You! Hooking up! With me!”<br/>
He seemed to think of that, gasping. “But… You’re not my type.”<br/>
“Oh, really?” she said, inching closer and barely touching him “So, you mean, it would be difficult for you to kiss me?”<br/>
He blushed even harder.<br/>
“I know you still like Evans, everyone knows. Look, she’s a good girl, but she’s not as perfect as you may think. And plus, she dumped you, Snape. Get on with it.”<br/>
“Don’t you dare talk about her.” He growled.<br/>
“Alright, alright. Well, what about my proposal?”<br/>
“I’ll think about it.”<br/>
“Good.”<br/>
She raised from her seat, while he looked at her. He had to admit, the Gryffindor was indeed breath-taking. And she also smelled amazing. His Slytherin mates would die of jealousy if he hooked up with her…<br/>
“Anyway, maybe I’m not your type, but I, on the other hand, have always wondered what’s underneath that Slytherin tie” she suddenly said, “Who knows, maybe I’ll find out.” She smirked, and walked out of the library, leaving the boy stunned, and full of thoughts.</p>
