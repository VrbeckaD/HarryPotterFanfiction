    <p>Hermione tapped her fingers pensively against her oak desk, wishing not for the first time that things like ballpoint pens had filtered in to the magical world. Quills, while beautiful to look at, were not terribly as rewarding to chew on. And sugar quills, while having the benefit of no feathers to leave stuck in between teeth, were actually quite the disappointment as they melted almost as fast as they were nibbled upon. No, nothing in the magical world could quite match up to the distracting satisfaction of mutilating the end of a bic pen while trying to complete reports.</p><p> </p><p>She strummed her fingers again, an annoying habit that had her office mate shooting daggers at her from across the room. Or, that's what she believed he or she was doing behind their mask as they kept tipping their head in her direction. She shot a remorseful look back, but knew that it, too was hidden by her own disguise. As an Unspeakable, it was hard to say what the other person was doing or thinking as they were covered from head to toe in black robes, blotting out features that might identify them, and even going so far as to obscure their voices. Hermione had no idea if the person across from her was male, or female, or if she even knew them outside of the ministry. What she was fairly certain of , however, was that they would happily remove her fingers from her hand if it would stop the infernal tapping she kept up.</p><p> </p><p>It was an unfortunate quirk she'd developed as a teenager. A way to settle her mind even as it tried to jump ahead at warp speed. It centered her back in the here and now, and helped her form ideas into sentences that she could pass on to others through her reports. Like the one before her. How, exactly, did one explain how an inanimate clock not only took on the likeness of a person, but then tried to turn others into clocks as well? And that it only took a single touch to do so? Oh, and the only way to tell that the clock was a clock was to get close enough to look into their eyes and see the numbers around their cornea? Ah, but then the real questions – who created such an item, and how did one destroy it? Such were the queries Hermione was attempting to answer when a new, lonely missive drifted onto her desk in the middle of her scroll.</p><p> </p><p>She paused, and stared at it. It wasn't unusual to get a new assignment. It was unusual, however, when she hadn't closed up the last one yet. She frowned briefly, then picked it up and turned it over. The stamp for the ministry of law enforcement was pressed onto the back, and she internally sighed.</p><p> </p><p>Having chosen to go into research after the war, Hermione's experience with magical items and familiarity with it's grounds had quickly landed her a position in the Department of Mysteries. However, she'd been recruited for a specialty position that involved close work with the wizarding law enforcement department to help handle particularly odd cases. She was fairly certain at least 2 other Unspeakables shared the same designation, but couldn't be sure of the exact count. She acted as a detective of sorts, attempting to find lost artifacts, contain small skirmishes of death eaters, and generally investigate any strange sounding circumstances. It did help break up the banal research that sometimes threatened to overwhelm her time in the ministry.</p><p> </p><p>She flipped open the missive, and raised an eyebrow at the short letter, “New case. Come at once” signed by Carius Trufeather, captain of the force. Well, this should prove interesting. She dropped her quill, and quickly swept out of the room, fairly certain she heard a sigh of relief from her office mate as she exited the door.</p><p> </p><p>After a brief stop to change into regular clothes, she apparated to the headquarters for law enforcement and went directly to Carius's office. Stepping across the threshold, she caught her boss's eye before noting the blonde head seated across from him. A groan left her lips before she could contain it.</p><p> </p><p>Platinum hair fairly well swished, as the older man turned his head and regarded her solemnly, “I assure you, Ms. Granger, the feeling is mutual”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione grimaced in apology, “Sorry, Mister Malfoy. It's not you”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course not. Hermione is always delighted to work with you,” came Carius's smooth voice from across the table. He was a tall man, lean, with dark blue eyes, close cropped brown hair and hawkish features. He gestured her in, and pointed to the open chair next to Lucius's. Hermione tried to control her expression, failing miserably, as she plopped unceremoniously into the high backed seat.</p><p> </p><p>“I can see your manners are as on point as always,” muttered Lucius. Hermione gave him a sidelong glance.</p><p> </p><p>“They're at least as keen as your wit” she murmured back. Carius coughed, covering his mouth with his hand, and she could swear she could see him trying to cover up a smirk.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione, thank you for coming on such short notice” he addressed her. She waved a hand in the air,</p><p> </p><p>“The missive said “come at once”, so I came. Had I have known it would involve another Malfoy mystery toy I might not have been so eager” she replied. Lucius turned his grey eyes on her, narrowing them in her direction.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't own toys, Miss Granger” he sneered. Hermione sat up straight, yanking up the sleeve to her right arm, showing a tree shaped scar burnt along the back of her forearm.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. I'm quite aware of exactly what you own, Malfoy” she snapped back. The older man stiffened, and made as if to gather his things to leave. She sighed, a small spear of guilt piercing her mutinous heart, and she waved at him, “Sit. I'm not going anywhere. We've done this before”</p><p> </p><p>He eyed her warily for a moment, and then let out an annoyed huff before sitting back down. Carius passed his eyes between the two of them, as if trying to measure out their sincerity at working together.</p><p> </p><p>“Very well,” he began, “Hermione, Mr. Malfoy here has reported some artifacts missing from his home. They are quite dangerous, and very dark. We would like you to help him track them down and return them to either his house, or the Department of Mysteries as necessary”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione tipped her head to the side, turning to face Lucius fully for the first time, “Missing?” she asked. She had assisted the patriarch in the past with a few items that he'd requested removed from his house, and even helped eliminate a few curses left behind as presents from Voldemort in the Manor. However, she knew that he actually had very tight security on those items that were most dangerous to handle, and was surprised to hear that something may have gone awry.</p><p> </p><p>His gaze was cool and level as he looked back at her, nodding succinctly, “I believe you remember the stuffed bear that sat on the pedestal in the dungeons?” She shivered – the damned thing watched you as you walked through the room, even going to far as to turn it's head to follow you.</p><p> </p><p>“Unfortunately, yes”</p><p> </p><p>“It has gone missing. As have a mirror, a watch, and two hair combs” Hermione furrowed her brow.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't remember any hair combs”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, apparently Narcissa didn't think it prudent to lock them up. They were out in her jewelery box, which was pilfered. I suspect they were incidental, though will make for a very...unfortunate gift” he replied. Hermione grimaced.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have any idea whom might have taken them?” she asked. Lucius shook his head, a disconcerted look on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“I do not entertain much anymore,” he replied, “Though I did have a small personal party late last week. Perhaps someone snuck in while the wards were down. At any rate, I did not discover the missing artifacts until just this morning”</p><p> </p><p>“Bugger” she muttered. A full four or five days since they'd gone missing meant they could very well be anywhere, “Well, let's start at the scene. I'd like a list of the persons who were at your Manor over the last week as well, please”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius nodded again and rose from his seat, Hermione joining him at the door. She glanced over her shoulder at Carius, whom warned “Keep me appraised of everything”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course. And if you don't hear from me in 24 hours, assume Malfoy has had enough and start searching the Manor for my body” she called back cheerfully. She couldn't be sure, but she was fairly certain that she heard the blonde man chuckle as he took her elbow and apparated them away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
