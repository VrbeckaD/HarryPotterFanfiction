    <p>"Aunt Petunia! Dudley punched David in school today." Ten year old Harry ran up to his aunt, who was sitting at the dining table with a letter. She turned to her older son questioningly. "Dudders?"</p><p>"They were mean to Harry, mom!"</p><p>Harry smiled a bit at that, but still continued, "But you shouldn't have gotten into trouble for that."</p><p>"They called you freak!"</p><p> Aunt Petunia immediately stood up. "I am calling the school."Harry hugged her legs. "Nooooooo! Auntie, its okay! I don't care about what they say anyways!"</p><p> </p><p>Dudley picked up the envelope his mother had dropped. "What's this, mum?" Petunia smiled sadly. </p><p>"Vernon was put behind bars yesterday for getting into a drunk fight. He won't be coming out anytime soon, not with his track record."</p><p>Dudley joined Harry in hugging her. "We don't need him. He was gone from our lives a long time ago."</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Petunia woke up in the morning after Halloween. She had slept in quite late, but had expected her 'husband' to do the same. She went downstairs to make some coffee to find Vernon already at the kitchen table, which was quite suspicious. He also looked very happy, only making her suspicion grow. "Vernon, dear, what's got you in such a cheery moody?" She asked sweetly, almost choking on her own voice. Why she married this pig, she would never know.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Your freak sister's son was left on the porch this morning. I just came back after dropping him at an orphanage", he exclaimed cheerily.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Petunia stopped in her tracks. "What?" she whispered. Vernon frowned. "Come on , Pet, we won't have to deal with a freak in the house."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Petunia stared at him, before hurrying upstairs. She grabbed her emergency bag from under the bed, the car keys, all the money she could find and Dudley, who was still asleep, before running out of the house. Quickly strapping her sleeping son in, she got it into the driver's seat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Pet, where are you going?" The big man lumbered out of the house.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Away." With the curt response, she drove away.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She spent the next six hours going form orphanage to orphanage, before finally finding her little nephew at a dilapidated orphanage building an hour's drive away from Privet Drive. Holding the little boy in her arms, she broke down in the matrons arms, telling her how Vernon had changed three months after their marriage, and how she just wanted to get away.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Three days later, the courts officiated her divorce and she was once again Petunia Evans.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Petunia smiled down at the two boys. "I know, darlings."</p><p>Dudley was quite tall for his age, and could probably pass for twelve or thirteen.  He had a rugged look around him, but he was a gentle giant. Well, until someone decided to insult his mom or little brother. Then he was just a giant. But no one could deny that with his warm brown eyes and shaggy brown hair, he would grow into a handsome young man.</p><p>Little Harry, on the other hand, was small. Not abnormally so, but he was the kind of child you just wanted to pick up and cuddle forever. Petunia would force down as much food as possible, but Harry remained little. What he lacked in size,though , he made up in beauty. Impossibly large emerald green eyes which sparkled just so, little pink lips, an upturned nose, pale, smooth skin and tresses as dark as the night.</p><p>Petunia was brought out of her thoughts by a sweet voice.</p><p>"Aunt Petunia? May we go to Diagon Alley today?"</p><p>Petunia smiled. "Of course, sweetheart. But don't forget your shades. And let me get my foundation, I really don't like that scar of yours sometimes"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>An hour later, Petunia was waiting at Fortescue's for Harry and Dudley to return from the bookshop, no doubt Harry had dragged his cousin there the first chance he got. She looked up again and smiled when she spotted her boys, but a second later, her smile turned into a frown, when she saw the solemn look on Harry's face. He was carrying a book in his hands, having paid for it with the money from her vault that Lily had opened for her.</p><p>"Aunt Petunia? Can we go to Gringotts?", he whispered when he and Dudley got to the table she was seated at.</p><p>"Of course. But what's the matter?" Harry did not look ready to give her any answers so she turned to Dudley, who shrugged.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hello, Master Goblin. May your gold flow", Harry greeted a teller at one of the tables.</p><p>"And may your enemies tremble at your name, Heir Potter", the goblin said with a toothy smile, making sure to keep his voice low so as to not be overheard.</p><p>"May we borrow a private sitting room?"</p><p>The goblin glanced up at his companions before nodding. He got up, lead them to a hallway away from prying eyes and showed them to an empty sitting room. He smiled at the thanks he received from all three humans before closing the door after them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Petunia turned to her nephew after sitting down. "Auntie, who is Lord Voldemort?"</p><p>The air in the room immediately became frosty. "He was the man who killed your parents, Harry. Dumbledore then rescued you from the house in Godric's Hollow and brought you to me."</p><p>Dudley, who was sitting beside Harry, clasped his hand in silent support. "Are you sure Aunt Petunia?" Harry asked, looking up at her.</p><p>Petunia blinked. Then sighed. "No, Harry. It's just what everyone says. But they also say that your godfather Sirius Black betrayed your parents and got them killed, but I knew Sirius and I know he would have killed himself first. Lily never told me much about the war going on in the Wizarding World, wanting to keep me safe or some such shenanigans. I asked around her weeks after her death and was told that she was Dumbledore's supporter, so I took his word for it."</p><p>Harry looked up at her. "You know how good my memory is Aunt Petunia." At her nod, he continued, "I remember the night they died."</p><p>Petunia gasped. She leaned forward in silent support, before hesitantly asking, "Is that what your nightmares are about?"</p><p>Harry let out a breath. "Sometimes, but that is not the point. I believe that what the Wizarding World knows is a lie. Lord Voldemort did not kill my parents."</p>
