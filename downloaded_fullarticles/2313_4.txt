    <p>The family that lived in Number 4 Privet Drive was as normal as could be. Every day, the husband woke up, ate breakfast with his family, and went to work. Every day, the wife would do housework and gossip with the neighbours. Every day, the son would go to school and play with his friends. Nothing was out of the ordinary, and the only thing out of place was the lovely roses that bloomed no matter the season ("Family secret", the wife would say to the neighbours, earning a jealous laugh in reply. The only secret was that they bought roses at the supermarket to make their garden look lively during winter). </p><p>No one would say that anything was amiss. No one except, perhaps, the family, but even that was a gamble. The family loved normality, and they would sooner eat their own shoes than admit that anything was wrong with their home. But something was very wrong.</p><p>In that house was the family of three, yes. They loved each other, for sure. But in the house, hidden under the stairs, was another boy. Small, smaller than any ten year old had any right to be, with messy black hair and eyes that were as frightened as they were green. That is to say, very.</p><p>That boy was Harry Potter. Every day, Harry would wake up to the loud rapping of knuckles against his bedroom door and a sharp voice demanding he wake up. He would exit his room, stretch, and walk into the kitchen to make breakfast. He would stand on his tip toes to see the stove as he cooked bacon, earning numerous small burns across his face. Small enough to look like freckles. He would dish out breakfast for the family, and if there were no burnt bits or unpleasant bites, he would be given a plain piece of toast. </p><p>After the husband went to work and the son went to school, the boy would begin his chores. He would dust everything he could reach, clean the counters with chemicals that made his hands tingle and his eyes water, and sweep and mop the floor. He would go to the wife and wait for orders, and depending on the season, he would shovel the drive of snow, do lawnwork, or repaint the shutters and windowboxes around the house.</p><p>If he was finished before lunch time, the wife would toss him a piece of lettuce from her salad, or if he was lucky, a slice of tomato. Once, he was even given a piece of chicken from a new salad recipe she had tried. He would thank the wife and continue his chores, staying inside so that the neighbours didn't see him. He wasn't mean to be seen. He would start cooking dinner an hour before the husband came home, and while the family was eating, he would go in his room. He would clean up the dishes afterwards, and unless he had behaved badly that day, he would be given a small plate of scraps.</p><p>Harry Potter never went to school. If he did, bad things would happen. If the wife wasn't feeling well and stayed in her room, or the family went out for a special occasion, he would sneak into the son's room and sit on the floor, reading all the school books that had scarcely been opened before. He would remember the questions, the techniques, the information. It helped pass the time when he was in his room, waiting to fall asleep. Sometimes, if he was feeling particularly brave, he would go into the husband and wife's room and look through their personal bookshelves, but he mostly stayed in the living room and read the books that the family never even touched. He didn't know why someone would keep books in a public place and not read them, but he didn't let it bother him.</p><p>There was another reason that the family did not like Harry Potter. He could do things. He didn't know why, nor did he think very long on it, but sometimes if he was very angry or scared, things would happen. He once made a spider in his room look at him and do a dance, but the spider got bored of him and left. He once even asked the spider to write something in its web when it returned to his room, like he had read in one of the son's books. The spider did. The boy had quickly asked for the spider to get rid of it, since he didn't think the family would like seeing his name written in webs, but he had thanked the spider.</p><p>He had once even made the little toy soldier he kept hidden in the small cubby of the last stair, wave at him! He felt tired afterwards, but if he focused hard enough, he could make the toy soldier do funny things, like stand on one leg or shake its arms above its head. As the years had gone by, he had gotten much better at making the toy do things.</p><p>The boy knew that what he did was bad. He had once made the son's balloon shake and twirl around when he had gone back after a birthday party, but he was punished severely when the family saw what he did. The balloon was popped and thrown away. Several events such as that happened when he was smaller, and he soon learned that what he did was never to be shown to people.</p><p>He didn't want the family to angry with him, after all. Anger meant pain, and he got more than enough of that on a weekly basis. The husband had friends, and the friends sometimes needed help. At least, that was how the husband had explained it. It didn't make much sense to him, but eager to stay out of trouble, The boy never argued when the husband and his friends needed help. He never had to do very much, he was allowed to simply lie down and stay quiet. It left him in pain for days afterwards—and it hurt to high heaven while it happened, but the husband didn't get angry with him for at least two days, so it was a fair deal.</p><p>The boy was satisfied with his life, he had accepted that was how things were. Things made sense to him, and as long as he didn't argue back, it would stay that way.</p><p>"Boy, get the mail." Mr. Dursley snapped, yanking him from his thoughts as he wiped down the dining table. It was difficult, and sometimes he had to heave himself up to rest on his stomach to reach all of it, but it wasn't too complicated.</p><p>"Yessir." The boy said, hopping down off the table and making his way to the front door. He leaned down and picked up the small stack of mail. This wasn't unusual, him fetching it for the family, but his curiousity was grabbed as a small, oddly shaped bump pushed against his fingers. He pulled the envelope that was at the bottom of the pile out, inspecting the odd bump. It was a red sticker of sorts with a design in the middle, holding the letter closed. He flipped it over.</p><p> </p><p>    "Mr. H. Potter</p><p>       The Cupboard under the Stairs</p><p>          4 Privet Drive,</p><p>              Little Whinging</p><p>                     Surrey"</p><p>   He halted, reading the writing again. For him?</p><p>"Hurry up, boy!"</p><p>He jolted, stepping towards the living room. As he passed his cupboard, he slipped the letter— <em>his </em>letter— through the slot in the door. "Yessir." He said, continuing into the living room. He handed the husband the stack of letters, minus the one addressed to him. In a different world, he might have been holding it when he came in the room. In a different world, he might have told the family what he had received. But this was not a different world, and he did not do any of those things.</p><p>He carried on with his day, beginning his chores once the son and husband left for school and work, respectively. He dusted everything he could reach, cleaned the counters, swept and mopped the floor. It was a Tuesday, so he rummaged under the kitchen sink to find chemicals, and then began the trek upstairs to clean the loo. The wife wasn't very attentive today, so he was able to drink from the sink without getting caught. Last time he had been seen drinking from the sink, he had been beaten so bad he had thrown up all the water he had drank, plus a surprising amount of bile that burnt his throat.</p><p>He scrubbed at the sink, at the counter, and crawled into the tub to rub at the mildew around the faucet. It took an hour before he was done to a satisfactory level. He walked downstairs and stored the cleaning supplies away, and then walked up to the wife, who was eating her lunch. Today, it seemed to be a salad with a strong smelling dressing and bits of bacon.</p><p>"We have guests tonight. Go to your room until dinner needs to be made."</p><p>"Yes Ma'am." He said, adding a quick "Thank you, Ma'am." as she tossed a big piece of lettuce at him. As he munched it on his way to his room, he couldn't deny that the dressing was delicious. He sat down on his bed, which was a mat that the family graciously gave him, and picked up the envelope from where it had fallen through the slot. He tore it open and unfolded the letter, his eyes scanning through the contents. A school? His brow furrowed.</p><p>He opened the door to his room, slipping into the kitchen and grabbing a napkin from the counter. He hurried back to his room. Grabbing a nearly empty pen he was given for his last birthday, he sucked on the end of it, and began to write a reply on the napkin. It only took a moment, but his handwriting wasn't very good, admittedly. He listened for a moment, then sat quietly until he heard the squeak above his head that meant that the wife was going to her room. He carefully opened the door to his room, then walked to the front door. He opened it quietly, making sure it didn't creak, and glanced outside.</p><p>An owl sat on the decorative rose bush in the yard. He stared at it. It stared back.</p><p>"D'jou bring this?" He asked, his words blending together. The owl dipped its head, as much of a yes as he could expect. He stepped forward, casting a quick glance over his shoulder, into the house. "H're." He reached out, offering the napkin. The owl stared for a moment longer, a moment in which he considered the fact that he was very much crazy, but then it swooped forward and snatched the napkin from his hand.</p><p>The boy didn't wait to see if it left, he entered the house again and quickly closed the door.</p><p>"Who was there?"</p><p>He let out an odd screech, a mixture of a yelp and a strangled choke. He spun to see the wife standing on the staircase. She didn't like waiting, so rather than take a moment to catch his breath, he blurted out, "Sal'sman."</p><p>"Sent him away, did you?"</p><p>"Yes Ma'am."</p><p>"Back in your room."</p><p>"Yes Ma'am."</p><p>He scurried to his bedroom, closing the door behind him as he sat down on his bed. His heart was racing, his head was foggy, but deep down, he knew he made the right decision.</p>
