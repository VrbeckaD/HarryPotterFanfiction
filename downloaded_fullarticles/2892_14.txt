    <p>Disclaimer:<br/>I do not own Game of Thrones, A Song of Fire and Ice or Harry Potter, I get no money out of this.</p><p>Hulda</p><p>It was cold.<br/>The sound of sloshing as if someone was trekking through puddles of water, rough noises some sounding in different pitches,  some vibrations and even the breathing was different.</p><p>Green eyes slowly opened only to close again when a small drop of cold met their eye making a pair of hands raise up to rub away the odd feeling.</p><p>Sitting up the person was a little girl, wearing thin old rags long now drenched and matted with mud, the same case was said for her long black hair.<br/>Her skin was fair, her features not too soft and not too sharp.</p><p>A kind mix one might say, she stood up, feet sinking into the soft earth and bleary eyes cracked back open to take in her surroundings.</p><p>The girl stood in an alley, so narrow she probably could press her feet fully against the stone wall opposite of the other, that is if she laid down horizontal. She looked around, one end lead to a busy street where wagons, and various people walked past trudging through the pouring rain and mud, shouting in booming voices to capture anybody to look at their goods.</p><p>The other end lead deeper and with her mind made up she began to walk down the alley, away from the busy street.</p><p>Once farther in the sound fading off to leaving only pitter patter of rain and her own feet making squishy noises when they took a step into puddles and more deeper mud.</p><p>The girl’s ankles were covered with it, the rags that would have resembled shorts on a regular older child looked more like pants, the ends were heavy with mud and water.</p><p>The little one stopped and bent down to roll the fabric up so they didn’t get more heavy and start slipping from her waist. Once she felt secure she shivered and continued on her simple journey with a goal to find somewhere dry.</p><p>She stopped once the narrow alley ended, revealing a small wooden shelter very much crude and nearly about to fall away, the only entrance was covered by an old ugly material that used to be a curtain, pushing it aside she walked inside.</p><p>There was an old dirty and frayed rug over the earth, the girl crawled under it and laid down feeling relief to be out of the cold rain, like the creepy of vines the little one fell asleep even though she had woken up not that long ago.</p><p>Gavin</p><p>Gavin had been out today, hiding in the shadows of stalls watching the weary sellers as they tried to shout out and get anybody’s attention.</p><p>Nowadays with the never ending rain many of the farmers were worried about their crop drowning and leaving them with no choice but to harvest early.<br/>Everyday less food was shown, most of it not ripe yet and each passing day everyone was miserable due to this sudden offering of rain.<br/>Gavin shifted from one foot to the other, his eyes settled on Old Rick’s food stand. Old Rick was one of the men who was weary of Gavin, every time the boy tried to steal something Old Rick would be there in a minute. His hand clutching an old stick that always bruised and stung any skin it came in contact with.<br/>But Gavin saw something different in Old Rick today, the old man was stressed and desperate, his eyes were focused on the passersby trying to get anyone to look interested in his food.</p><p>Without breathing Gavin moved forward as Old Rick shifted to where his back was seen and as silent as he could he slowly reached and snatched two apples from the stand.</p><p>Heart thundering with adrenaline the thief slipped away, he could have taken more but anybody would be a fool if you tried.</p><p>Something could have tumbled and made a noise, if you were caught carrying an armful you’d most likely lose all of it trying to flee and if you took too many from one side the owner would notice and keep a tighter eye on the blind spot.</p><p>The homeless boy was ten summers old, he was a tall gangly thing but with the talent to press down and make himself not noticeable and silent if he needed. As the boy flipped through the alleys’ similar to a snake slipping into tight spaces he came back to his home, it wasn’t bad but it wasn’t good either.</p><p>But it held against the elements and it gave him a sense of peace, the area was mostly abandoned. Having to have been the spot for brothels the owners have left to another place once the customers became scarce, lifting the flap Gavin noticed something sleeping in the back of his home his weary black eyes staring at the muddy and shivering child that seemed asleep.</p><p>He walked over and watched as the girl shifted and curled more into herself. Gavin rarely took in strays, he learnt that grace lesson, when too many children are in one place it causes unwanted attention.<br/>From the rapers, drunks to even slavers and the Men of the Night's watch, and Gavin sighed as he moved forward and nudged the sleeping child with his foot.<br/>“Get out, your in my home.”he spoke as the child opened their eyes and blinked the sleep out of their eyes.</p><p>He reached up to wipe away some water from his brow and moved towards one corner of the little shack where it was more dry, placing the two fruits down beside him.He had built a little fire pit as he took rationed sticks and timber and gathered them on spot, you never know when you’d need a fire especially in the winter.</p><p>The boy noticed the other kid move over curious and probably simple minded.<br/>“No matter, even the simple minded get the idea whenever I hurt them.”</p><p>His hands shook with the cold as he moved to start the fire, they felt fat and numb which made things more dangerous and harder. After a few minutes he was able to get a couple sparks on the tinder, leaning down he began to softly blow and soon enough a small fire started.</p><p>After warming his hands to feel the feeling back into them he turned to where the apples were, his black eyes caught the child staring at them and he sighed and stood.</p><p>“Get out, are you simple minded?”he asked his voice was filled with irritation as emerald green met his own eyes.</p><p>Not a word was spoken from their parted lips, usually Gavin could tell if a child was a boy or a girl. But this kid had loose clothing on, matted hair that had dried a bit with mud in it.</p><p>“Probably a mute.” a thought spoke in his mind as he watched them move closer their eyes on the apple.<br/>With a loud sigh he picked up a stick and suddenly jabbed the kid in the arm with the end, it was a hard nub but not sharp enough to cause a cut. Just pain and bruising, his eyes narrowed as the kid jumped and rubbed the spot vigorously, causing crusted dried earth to crumble and small still wet clumps to smear more.<br/>He jabbed them again this time it caused them to back away and with pace he had the child standing out in the rain, feeling the message was clear he walked back inside allowing the flap of an old abandoned curtain to fall back into place where the door was.</p><p>He moved back towards where the fire was and sat down to enjoy the warmth and the slow dryness of his skin.</p><p>He stood and began to take off his clothing, spreading it out and near the fire he sat there naked as his name day as he watched the flames.</p><p>He heard a faint cough and a shift, he stood and walked back to the door lifting the flap he stared at the wide green eyes of the child.</p><p>It had walked back to the entrance as if it was a lost puppy, raising an eyebrow Gavin huffed.</p><p>“Get going, I don’t take in strays you either find your own place or sit in the rain and get sick.”he said watching as green eyes blinked sluggishly.</p><p>A fleeting feeling of familiarity filled his chest briefly and left an echoed pain behind, he shifted with unease and glared at the kid.</p><p>“It’s one kid, they look around five.” With a groan he shifted and lifted the flap higher.</p><p>“Get in before I change my mind.” he spat out and the little one hurried inside, sitting as close to the fire as it could.</p><p>“What are you doing? Take your clothes off so they can dry or you’ll get sick.”he said moving to help the child, the sex of the kid was revealed and the boy helped Her now place the clothes beside his own.</p><p>“I want you gone by tomorrow, nothing good happens when there are kids huddled in one place.”he spoke.<br/>He picked up an apple and took a big bite out of it, he winced when some pain blossomed in his mouth. He took another bite and noticed the girl’s eyes watching the other apple, he twitched and picked it up tossing it over he chewed on the bite in his mouth as he watched the fire.</p><p>In a few minutes the core was left and Gavin tossed it to the side.</p><p>The shack may have not been big, majority of the space was for the fire pit, which was in the right hand corner in the back far away from the rug, on the opposite side was a couple old blankets and sheets that was meant to be a bed. He snuffed out the fire and crawled over to it, through the cracks of the shelter he noticed the sun was gone and the rain was still continuing, he laid on the sheets and used the blanket to cover himself as the warmth slowly faded.<br/>He felt something climb beside him and growled, he lifted the blanket and allowed the tiny girl to press against his side to keep warm.</p><p>The next morning wind woke Gavin with a start, he sat up and scrubbed the sleep from his eyes.<br/>He felt more warm than ever as he stared at the door blearily, the shift at his side made him remember what happened yesterday.</p><p>He looked down at the sleeping child and shook their shoulder, as they sat up he stood and climbed over them to his now dried clothes. Putting them on he helped the kid with her own and stared at her.<br/>Many thoughts raced through his head, questions towards why he had taken her in.</p><p>Why had he helped her, why he took care of her.<br/>Maybe it was because of the loneliness rising in his chest, the memories of his mother before she was gone. The feeling of someone with you, the comfort it gave, to have company to fight away growing pain from the harshness of life.</p><p>With a deep sigh Gavin stood as the pain of hunger filled him, he probably guessed the kid was hungry too. He took her wrist and lead her out of the shack and into the light drizzle of rain, maybe he could leave her on the road, grab a few things to eat and leave her there.</p><p>“It’s better to stay alone, less attention and an avoidance of pain if you grow close.”<br/>A plan was formulating in his head as he walked down the alley, he felt those green eyes on him as they paused at the entrance into the trading road that was already filled with life.</p>
