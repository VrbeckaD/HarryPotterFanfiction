  <p>I'm writing to you as per the terms of my probation. My PO insists that I write to everyone I've ever wronged and apologize - and Pansy suggested this muggle technology of email, which I don't believe for a second will actually reach you. So anyway, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have run my mouth and insulted you just about every time I saw you. Although you *did* punch me after our Quidditch match in Fifth Year, so I feel justified in that instance. Also, I probably shouldn't have stomped on your nose, although I still feel you deserved that one. Did it bleed a lot?</p>

  <p>Aside from that, I'm told to th-th-th - bah! Merlin's raunchy hole! It's hard to even write! Grr...</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Thank you. For saving my life from an out of control Fiendfyre. And also for defeating that insane megalomaniac. Argh! Now I have to go wash the acrid taste out of my mouth.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Oi Potter, kindly swallow your arrogance and write back so I can prove to my PO that I did as she insisted.</p>

</p><p>Malfoy,</p><p>
  <span>Merlin! Where do I even start? Good thing you learned about email, I don’t think there are enough quills or owls if you had to apologize for all of your prat behavior the Wizarding way. Imagine the carnage, exhausted birds just dropping out of the sky. And Parkinson knows about email too?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You feel justified for the fifth year quidditch debacle? Are you mad? You got me a lifetime ban from Umbitch! And breaking my nose and leaving me on the train? Those are probably the only two I’m actually still angry about. All of the others? I gave as good as I got, and when I didn’t I got to see Hermione smack your pretty face! <br/></span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’ll take the apology, as forced and insincere as it was, but you don’t need to thank me for the fiendfyre. I wouldn’t have been there to save you if you hadn’t saved me at the manor. You’re a right pain in the arse, but you made the right call when it mattered. <br/></span>
</p><p>
  <span>Arrogantly yours,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-H</span>
