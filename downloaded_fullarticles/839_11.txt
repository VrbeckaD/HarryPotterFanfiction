</p><p>After the TARDIS rematerialized, they all knew it was time to part.  River gave the Doctor such a passionate kiss that the ancient alien was actually blushing by the time she released him in order to turn towards Hermione.  “Stay with him, please,” the woman whispered the request in her friend's ear as she gave the witch a warm farewell hug.  “He needs someone to travel with.  He doesn’t do well alone.”</p><p>Hermione nodded in acknowledgement.  “Of course, I will,” she replied before adding, in a voice purposely loud enough for the Doctor to hear, “Somebody obviously needs to keep him out of trouble!” </p><p>“Good luck with that!” her curly-haired friend answered with a huge grin on her face while the Doctor just smiled a bit sheepishly at the truth of that statement.  River blew him a kiss.  Then, with just a quick “Goodbye, Sweetie!  Goodbye, Hermione!” she was out of the TARDIS and on her way to break back into her cell at Stormcage - where she would stay until it was time for her next escape. However, now that Hermione knew River as well as she did, the witch had a suspicion that the current stretch of incarceration would not last long at all!  </p><p>The Doctor just shook his head affectionately at the whirlwind that was his wife, though, before he clapped his hands and turned back to his companion with his usual manic grin.  “Alright then, Granger.   Where should we go next?”  He headed to the console and started to flip switches.  “It’s your choice…anywhere but the Draconian system, though.  I have had enough of dragons to last me a few regenerations!”  He gave a little shudder at the thought.</p><p>Hermione just laughed – especially since that was how they had met.  While on a field assignment in the Hungarian wilderness for the Department of Magical Creatures and Beings, she had rescued the Doctor from an extremely ornery wild Horntail that stood between him and the TARDIS.  He had been impressed with her quick thinking, wand work, and utter lack of shock when she found out that he was an alien who traveled through time and space in a sentient ship.  Consequently...since he liked to surround himself with interesting people...he invited her along to travel with him. </p><p>For her part, Hermione had been eager to get away after her most recent failed relationship (she had been told many times that she was just too strong-willed and independent for most men).  Plus, she was more than ready to have some adventures herself.  Therefore, she agreed immediately – especially when the Doctor assured her that he could bring her back any<em>time </em>she wanted.  After that, they proceeded to travel together for several linear months, while they got in and out of a lot of trouble together, saved each other many times, and became the best of friends along the way. Then, one day, out of nowhere, a deep space distress beacon message that translated out to H-E-L-L-O-S-W-E-E-T-I-E led them straight to River. </p><p>“Don’t ask!” was all the woman said at first as she climbed into the TARDIS from the wreckage of her ship.  She removed her spacesuit helmet and, in the process, revealed a head of wildly curly hair that was even more unruly than Hermione’s.  The newcomer then immediately launched herself at the Doctor.  Hermione just stood nearby and watched with quite a bit of amusement as her lanky alien friend was thoroughly snogged before he eventually had to come up for air.  That was despite his respiratory bypass system which – along with her bubble head charm - had come in so handy a few weeks earlier when they had been marooned on an ocean planet after the TARDIS had been temporarily swallowed by a gigantic whale.</p><p>At any rate, the Doctor then introduced Hermione to his wife with his usual high-energy enthusiasm.  Despite Hermione’s surprise that the Doctor was actually <em>married,</em> the two lively-haired kick-ass women hit it off immediately.  There was no awkwardness between them - especially since Hermione had no desire for any kind of romantic entanglement at that time and had never had anything but platonic feelings when it came to her goofy, bowtie-wearing, and two-hearted alien friend. </p><p>Consequently, they were all content to travel through time and space together for several more linear months while they had one adventure after another.  The day eventually came, however, when River reluctantly admitted that she ought to return to Stormcage in order to serve a bit more of her sentence – which had ironically been given to her for killing the Doctor in the first place.  It was a long convoluted story that Hermione eventually heard - even if she never quite fully understood all of it.  She did not feel too bad about that, though, since it was clear that nobody else <em>really</em> understood the entire situation, either.  Nevertheless, that knowledge did not stop her from being sad when it was time for her friend to go.  However, she soon realized that the unusual situation was actually completely normal and routine for both River and the Doctor…and so she just followed their lead.</p><p align="center"> ~~~~~</p><p>Afterwards, when the Doctor asked Hermione for a new destination idea, she thought about her new friends and how they had told her the story of their unconventional and non-linear relationship while they were all under the influence of some very potent Firewhiskey and Hypervodka cocktails on the colony of Patronum Three sometime early in the 32<sup>nd</sup> century where Magicals and Muggles coexisted peacefully.  Besides the story, though, Hermione did not remember much else about that night except for the fact that she and the Doctor (superior physiology, her arse!) had to be practically poured back into the TARDIS by River and Jack. </p><p>The extremely charming and attractive muggle Captain in the long vintage coat had greeted the Doctor as an old friend when he joined them at their table in the corner of the old-fashioned pub that they had found soon after they had landed on the planet. Apparently, the two men crossed paths often…and had even occasionally traveled together in the TARDIS.   Jack made it clear that he and River had met before, as well, when he goodnaturedly grumbled about the time he was tricked, tied-up, and had his vortex manipulator stolen – even though it was obvious that he was also quite impressed by the feat at the same time.  After River simply shrugged in neither affirmation nor denial of the claim, and the Doctor laughed at them both, they introduced the handsome newcomer to Hermione. </p><p>To Hermione’s amusement, the man flirted shamelessly with them all...and not even the Doctor's stern "Stop it!" seemed to have any effect on his behavior, whatsoever.  However, since both the Doctor and River implied that this type of interaction was completely normal for the Captain, Hermione did not read anything serious into it at first.  Nevertheless, as the evening wore on, she started to realize that he actually focused the majority of his attention on her…and she was quite flattered.  After all, Jack was funny and articulate – and he understood the strange lifestyle of a time and space traveler very well. Hermione found that she enjoyed his company immensely - especially since she had been single and celibate for quite a long while by that point...and, needless to say, he was very easy on the eyes! </p><p>Unfortunately, however, she was not much of a drinker at the best of times…and the strong drinks had flowed freely throughout the night.  Therefore, to her extreme regret, she had been in no shape to take her acquaintance with the man and his sexy bright blue eyes any further.  However, she did vaguely remember his promise to look her up the next time he was back on Earth in the 21<sup>st</sup> century…and his regret seemed genuine when he gave her a sweet farewell kiss as he escorted her into the TARDIS.  At any rate, she found that she happily looked forward to whenever that future meeting - or <em>past</em> one as the case may be (Being a time traveler could be very confusing – especially when one was drunk!) would take place. </p><p align="center">~~~~~</p><p>Hermione had to push the memory of the attractive and intriguing man out of her mind for the time being, however, so she could redirect her mind to focus back on the Doctor’s question, instead.  For her answer, she immediately thought of the other two people that had featured so prominently in the story that she had learned that night about the Doctor and River’s relationship.</p><p>“I would love to meet Amy and Rory,” she declared.</p><p>“Ah…the Ponds.  What a good idea!  Why haven’t I taken you there before now?” the Doctor asked as he plotted the course.</p><p>“Probably because you were too busy getting me thrown in prison or dropped into the middle of revolutions!” Hermione retorted in reply.  The Doctor certainly could not dispute that, so he just grinned cheerfully at her as he threw the lever to take them into the Vortex, instead.</p>
