    <p>In the end Harry raised Teddy himself, as Andromeda passed away after Teddy turned one. By that point harry had also broken his friendship with most of the Weasleys when he caught Ginny trying to drug him. Blaming him for not choosing Ginny, it was his life and his choice who went out or married.</p><p>He moved to America at that point, and it was then that he found out the side effect of surviving the killing curse.</p><p>He was no longer human but an incubus.. which was also a succubus as gender was a thought. Sex was there food, and unlike stories they were neither demons nor did they kill there partners. They would always look like your perfect partner, and the better the sex the better one was fed.</p><p>Harry’s partner at the moment was an ancient vampire, well versed in Harry's species but preferred Harry as a female. His form right now was a small female that looked around sixteen, a waist that looked like hourglasses took ques from, a bust that made porn stars weep in envy and a backside that yes could bounce money off. </p><p>His form looked Japanese with large violet eyes, ebony hair fell sinfully around his/her form.</p><p>Every time Harry met this vampire, the form he took was different as the Vampire had many perfect forms in mind.</p><p>He was also teaching Harry so many new things.</p><p>At the moment Harry could only orgasm as the vampire Thrust deep inside him, meeting her sweet spot, cum decorated her body, as the vampires seed continued to be pumped inside her.</p><p>Finally they relaxed, the vampire still balls deep inside of her while hugging her to his chest.</p><p>“Your son comes back tomorrow does he not,” her bed mate said.</p><p>“Yes, he just finished his final year of school,” Harry said licking salty lips. “I’m going to miss Teddy when he moved out Dracula.” and this was the famed Vampire, one so old he could walk in day now.</p><p>“At least it won’t be an empty nest,” Dracula smirked, a pale hand trailing across her belly in the last stages of pregnancies.</p><p>“I’m just curious of this one is yours,” Harry said, after all this was there third pregnancy and each one had a different being as a parent. Hiding a pregnancy while in his male human form was not easy but magic helped. The thing is, Harry could only get pregnant while in his human male form. </p><p>And hadn’t discovering that male pregnancy was real been a shocker, and it was a wizard thing.</p><p>“Next time, I have some wonderful male forms for you to try,” Harry smirked.</p>
