    <p>A voice rang out across the Great Hall, sickly sweet.</p><p>”Today’s classes have been cancelled. Please remain in the Hall, for we will be playing everyone’s soul songs, which will play alongside their memories to show everyone if any <em>lies</em> have been spread.” She aimed a glare at one Harry Potter, who glared defiantly back.</p><p>All across the Hall, a cacophony of noise was exploding.</p><p>”She can’t do this!”</p><p>”I refuse to do this!”</p><p>”... my father will hear about this!”</p><p>”SILENCE!” Umbridge screamed. “I <em>WILL </em>HAVE ORDER!”</p><p>Everyone quieted in the face of her anger.</p><p>”Now,” she continued, voice back to sweet. “We will start with the seventh years, and make our way down to first year.”</p><p>And so it begun. Harry, Ron and Hermione sat in silence, each worried about what their memories would be.</p><p>It seemed an age, but finally they were onto the fifth years.</p><p>”Hermione Granger!”</p><p>Hermione stood and allowed the spell to wash over her. A male voice began to sing.</p><p>
  <em>(When this began)</em><br/>
<em> I had nothing to say</em><br/>
<em> And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me</em>
</p><p>Hermione was being pushed down in a primary school playground by other children. They ripped up her books and started calling her names. </p><p>“Nerd!”</p><p>“Geek!”</p><p>“Know-it-all!”</p><p>Hermione did not make a sound until the bullies had run off, and while she stood up, a single tear ran down her cheek. She wiped it away and walked off with her chin in the air.</p><p><br/>
<em>(I was confused)</em><br/>
<em> And I let it all out to find</em><br/>
<em> That I'm not the only person with these things in mind</em><br/>
<em> (Inside of me)</em><br/>
<em> But all the vacancy the words revealed</em><br/>
<em> Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel</em></p><p>Hermione sat, sobbing, in the public library. The librarian walked past, looking at her, but not offering her help or a shoulder to cry on. This made her cry harder. After a while, she wiped her tears by herself and walked out of the building. She knew that no one would ever help her during her daily torment.</p><p><br/>
<em>(Nothing to lose)</em><br/>
<em> Just stuck, hollow and alone</em><br/>
<em> And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own</em><br/>
<br/>
<em> I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real</em><br/>
<em> I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long</em><br/>
<em> (Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)</em></p><p>Hermione ran a blade across her wrist. She looked about 10 or 11. She sat in a bathroom and watched the crimson blood flow from the newest cuts that sat on her forearm. She closed her eyes and heard a door open and close.</p><p>”Hermione? Come down, darling!”</p><p>She wrapped her arm in a bandage from the bathroom cupboard, and went downstairs.</p><p><br/>
<em>I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real</em><br/>
<em> I wanna find something I've wanted all along</em><br/>
<em> Somewhere I belong</em></p><p>Hermione gazed up at Hogwarts in awe. It was mirrored in Harry, Ron, and Neville’s faces. She listened to McGonagall’s speech and the Sorting Hat’s song. Finally, somewhere where people could understand her.</p><p><br/>
<em>And I've got nothing to say</em><br/>
<em> I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face</em><br/>
<em> (I was confused)</em><br/>
<em> Looking everywhere only to find</em><br/>
<em> That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind</em></p><p>Hermione was being ridiculed when she, Harry and Neville had lost all those points from Gryffindor. Why did she think it would be any different from primary school? Everywhere she went, she was bullied.</p><p><br/>
<em>(So what am I?)</em><br/>
<em> What do I have but negativity</em><br/>
<em> 'Cause I can't justify the way, everyone is looking at me</em><br/>
<em> (Nothing to lose)</em><br/>
<em> Nothing to gain, hollow and alone</em><br/>
<em> And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own</em><br/>
<br/>
Hermione was crying in the dorms when Harry and Ron wouldn’t talk to her in third year. She didn’t have her knife, but she scratched and dug her nails in her arm. Instantly, she felt relief, and sighed when she felt the sharp pain of her nails.</p><p><br/>
<em>I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real</em><br/>
<em> I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long</em><br/>
<em> (Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)</em><br/>
<em> I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real</em><br/>
<em> I wanna find something I've wanted all along</em><br/>
<em> Somewhere I belong</em></p><p>Harry and Hermione were walking along the lake on the day after Halloween in fourth year. Harry suddenly turned and hugged her.</p><p>”Thanks, Hermione. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”<br/>
<br/>
<em>I will never know myself until I do this on my own</em><br/>
<em> And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed</em><br/>
<em> I will never be anything 'til I break away from me</em><br/>
<em> I will break away, I'll find myself today</em></p><p>Hermione was showing her mother the newest cuts, shame in her eyes. Her mother hugged her. </p><p>“Don’t worry, we’ll get you some help.”<br/>
<br/>
<em>I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real</em><br/>
<em> I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long</em><br/>
<em> (Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)</em><br/>
<em> I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real</em><br/>
<em> I wanna find something I've wanted all along</em><br/>
<em> Somewhere I belong</em></p><p>Hermione had her arms around Harry and Ron as they made their way back from Hogsmeade in the snow.<br/>
<br/>
<em>I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong</em><br/>
<em> I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong</em><br/>
<em> Somewhere I belong</em></p><p>Hermione hugged Harry and Ron in turn after the Chamber of Secrets incident.</p><p>**</p><p>Hermione stood proudly as the song faded out. Harry and Ron hugged her as she returned to her seat.</p><p>”Miss Granger, I would like a word with you when the songs are finished,” McGonagall called out.</p><p>Hermione just nodded and sat down between her boys. They waited in a tight embrace until the next member of their trio was called.</p>
