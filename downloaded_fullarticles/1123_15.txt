    <p>Strange called to stark from the wreckage.</p><p>"Tony, there was no other way."</p><p>With that, he, like the others, vanished into thin air, crumbling into dust.</p><p>"Mr. Stark?" - Peter's voice was weak and frightened. - "I'm not feeling well."</p><p>No, - in head flashed Tony. - Please, no.</p><p>Peter stumbled and fell on Tony, his arms reaching out for him. Tony picked him up.</p><p>"You're all right," - Tony assured him, just as he had done before.</p><p>"I don't know what's going on. I don't know," - Peter fell into the hands of Tony, and he closed them, hugging the boy. Peter held on to Tony and began to cry. He was just a kid. Tony held him and stifled his own sobs. - "I don't want to die." I don't want to die. Please. Please. I don't want to die." - Peter fell to the ground, pulling Tony with him.</p><p>Tony leaned toward him.</p><p>Look at me, child. Quietly. You'll be fine - he thought. - I'm really here. I'm here. Just look at me. </p><p>Tony gripped Peter's shoulder, his gaze focused on him, and with a gentle whisper, Peter disintegrated into dust.</p><p>"Sorry."</p><p>NO!</p><p>"Mr. Parker!" - a strange voice shouted in his ear.</p><p>By reflex, the spider jumped and caught on the ceiling. Lowering his head, he saw a stern woman and a crowd of black robes with crimson and gold highlights. Quickly jumping down on its place, in his eyes dreamt the kind woman.</p><p>"Minus five points from Gryffindor."  - there was a murmur of disapproval from the class. - "No more jokes, Mr. Parker.</p><p>"Nicely." - he said uncertainly.</p><p>The room was painfully familiar. Large Windows overlooking the forest and the lake, a black slate on which chalk creaked. Of the Desk stood three rows and very close. Next to him sat a black-haired boy, who wrote down the topic of the lesson, the redhead did the same.</p><p>Really?..</p><p>No, he can't be wrong. Peter fell in the world Harry Potter.</p><p>"Just find out what course I'm on," - he whispered.</p><p>The bell rang and the students closed their worn textbooks and left the office. Parker walked over to the red-haired boy.</p><p>"Listen, Ron, what's the lesson?"</p><p>"Professor Snape's defense against the dark arts, isn't he? And Yes, how do you know me?"</p><p>"Uh, well, how would the third year. Professor Lupin, Sirius black, who was able to escape with the help of Harry and Hermione…"</p><p>Parker was pinned against the wall.</p><p>"Where. You. You know. What. Blek. Run away. With Help. Harry." - Ron said, pressing down on the poor guy's throat.</p><p>"What difference does it make?" - Pete asked, and quickly removed Weasley's hand from his throat. - "Black died in the Mystery Department.</p><p>"How do you know all this?" - the redhead freaked out.</p><p>Because I know all your stories in advance and your destinies. - Peter wanted to say, but he couldn't say it.</p><p>"Because it's obvious."</p><p>"Well, look at me." - Ron whispered and walked out of the classroom.</p><p>It's too complicated. Sure, Pete thought he was dead when the click happened, but he was actually in a world he'd always wanted to be in. The world of Harry Potter. </p><p>"Hey, Peter." - the black-haired girl kissed his cheek and sank gracefully beside him.</p><p>Parker was shocked to be kissed by a stranger.</p><p>"Pete, it's me, Lina." -  she said, pointing at herself.</p><p>"Lina..." - whispered he after all spider not expected, that in world Harry Potter have him there is girl simply he in his world could not make friends with Elizabeth.</p><p>"Oh, Pete, your forgetfulness is breaking all records. I forgot my own girl. I'm Lina Allen, remember?"</p><p>A thousand needles pierced his heart. The name Allen reminded him of Liz. Her heart leapt, and her anxiety would not go away. Pete picked up his bag and left the Gryffindor table, heading for the living room. Pretty quickly overcame a long distance and stared blankly at the Stout Lady. He doesn't know the password.</p><p>The spider's Instinct told him to take a step back, and Pete obediently did so, because the doorway to the living room opened.</p><p>"This is our time for independent study, Ron! what's the matter?" - said a small girl with a crow's nest on her head.</p><p>But red was looking at Peter, who was staring at them with big eyes, and then he started.</p><p>"What's the password? I just forgot, " Parker said fearfully</p><p>"Fuck you." - rude reported Ron and wanted to go on his way, but Pete blocked the path of the hand.</p><p>Weasley tried to pull his hand away, but he didn't move it an inch.</p><p>"Parker!"</p><p>"If you say the password, I'll skip it." - Peter said warily. "I may be weak in magic, but I can do many Things." </p><p>"Dragon Gatherings."— whispered the girl and Pete took my hand, and Ron flew headlong down.</p><p>Quite not on time ladder starters its movement, and Ron having found himself have the brink fell down. Peter immediately leaped after him and shot the cobwebs straight into the boy's chest.</p><p>"You hang in there." - said the Spider.</p><p>There were voices from the great hall-dinner was over. Parker quickly lifted Ron to his side before his classmates saw the picture.</p><p>"Thank you," - said Ron weakly. - "Where did you learn that?"</p><p>"I can't say that."</p><p>"I want to, too."</p><p>"You want a lot." - Pete turned to the Stout Lady. - "Dragon Gatherings."</p><p>The portrait creaked open and Parker stepped into the living room. He sat down on a hassock next to the fireplace and took Transfiguration, Spells, and Protection from the Dark Arts out of his bag. He was on a bad course, since he had so much homework to do, so he had to prepare them for the TOAD, but knowing what was going to happen, he only smiled bitterly.</p><p>Very soon he was joined by the girl who had kissed him. Lina sat down on the empty Ottoman next to Pete and took the same items from her school bag.</p><p>He decided to examine it carefully.</p><p>She had thick black hair, cut in a messy Bob-there was almost no hair at the back, but in front two strands reached her shoulders. Beautiful green eyes, similar on emerald, a small and graceful nose, subtler traits faces. She was a little shorter than Parker, and he was a good 6.13 feet tall, so Lina was about 6.03 feet. Black heart earrings dangled from her ears.</p><p>"Pete, help me, please." - she asked for help. - "I don't understand nonverbal spells at all."</p>
