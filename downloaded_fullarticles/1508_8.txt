          <div class="userstuff"><p>Tortured tempest of a mind<br/>
Left to stew, left behind<br/>
Like forgotten wind chime songs<br/>
Carried on a summer fog<br/>
But summer’s short and school time’s blue<br/>
Carrying all your meager love to you<br/>
Behind closed doors, closed curtains and eyes<br/>
You sob for a family, for fortune, for comforting lies<br/>
But it’s back to the steeple, back to the pyre<br/>
To burn for others and martyr in fire<br/>
You shattered, shallow soul<br/>
So pure and yet, unwhole<br/>
Clinging desperately to any small sense of normality<br/>
You’re left writhing in the harsh cold of reality<br/>
Numbing, breaking, cracking, shaking<br/>
You limp your broken bones off, aching<br/>
Your bruised and bloody skin is quaking<br/>
Have you forgotten how to sing a song?<br/>
A melody of right and wrong?<br/>
For wrong is choking out your air<br/>
A lyrical of life’s despair<br/>
Suffocating under a heavy glare<br/>
Piercing out from twinkling eyes<br/>
Your life is riddled with their lies<br/>
Safe, loved –  their happy little dove<br/>
All caged in wire pulled too tight<br/>
The barb-lined cable stings and bites<br/>
What is the truth behind your face?<br/>
What is fabricated in your place?<br/>
Just a little boy who fell from grace</p></div>
