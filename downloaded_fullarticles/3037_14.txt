    <p>Most people, well, almost all people, were small compared to Theseus Scamander. He was always the tallest person in the room, a head above everyone else, with massive shoulders to match his height. It did not bother him. Being remarkably tall had certain advantages. He could reach top shelves easily, he always had a clear view in a crowd and he rarely lost physical fights. But the best advantage to being so tall was being so much larger than a certain overseas colleague named Percival Graves.</p><p>Percival claimed that his height was standard, that his shoulders were wide and his musculature strong. But Theseus never really looked to see how other people compared to Percival. The important thing was how Theseus compared to Percival. Theseus was taller, he was broader and his muscles were noticeably thicker than Percival’s. Compared to him Percival was small and cute and Theseus adored every little inch of him. </p><p>Percival fit perfectly in his arms, in his lap, in his bed. He knew others saw a determined, intelligent, fearsome wizard. And they were right to label Percival as such. But Theseus was allowed to see from an angle that very few others saw. Behind that stoic expression and meticulously crafted exterior Percival could be affectionate, snuggly, adorable. This man was designed for Theseus to cuddle. </p><p>During his first encounter with Percival Graves he had not seen the man, had only felt the strength and elegance of his body through the thick layers of his uniform. Percival had quite literally landed in his lap on a dark night in a trench in France. Theseus’ first impressions were that the man was uptight and a bit bossy, but when he curled tiredly against Theseus’ chest Theseus was immediately smitten. Percival’s smaller body slotted effortlessly into the spaces made by Theseus’ legs and arms. No lover had ever fit against him as perfectly as this stranger did.</p><p>He woke the next morning and tried to get a look at his still slumbering companion. All the could make out was dark hair, long eyelashes and a rounded nose. The bars on the wizard’s uniform showed him to be an American lieutenant, but he wore no insignia to label him as part of the separate wizarding forces. Undercover, then? Intriguing.</p><p>He was interrupted from his musings by a beefy man in an American captain’s uniform who was marching through the trench with a sort of furious purpose. He stopped where Theseus’ legs protruded from the foxhole in the side of the trench and looked down with a grimace. Theseus met the officer’s eyes and braced himself.</p><p>“Graves!” the captain barked. “Graves, get your ass out of that foxhole!”</p><p>Theseus could not hold back a grin as his companion shot awake and hastily scrambled to his feet to salute his superior. The lieutenant kept his eyes down, but now Theseus could see his handsome face which was all the more attractive for the flustered blush that spread across his cheeks. The soldier hurried away at the orders of his captain and was followed by snickers from the rest of the company in the trench. Theseus felt a bit bad for the poor fellow.</p><p>“Captain,” the American officer addressed Theseus. “I must apologize for my lieutenant.”</p><p>“Not to worry. We’ve all been getting mixed up in the confusion.” Theseus replied. He shot a glance at the retreating soldier. “A bit of a handful, is he?”</p><p>The captain sighed ruefully. “He came highly recommended, but it turns out that he constantly splits away from the unit as if he has his own agenda.”</p><p>“Name of Graves, you say?”</p><p>“Lieutenant Percival Graves. If you wish to file a report against him-“</p><p>“No, no,” Theseus waved the suggestion away. “No harm done. At least he kept me warm all night.”</p><p>Theseus had heard of the Graves family. Percival Graves was descended from one of the original twelve families that set up the American wizarding government. Quite a name to have, though so far the heir seemed to have kept a low profile. Even in the society pages he barely warranted a mention as he constantly arrived at the high society functions alone and was never seen in public with any sort of companion. He seemed determined to keep himself out of gossip and out of the spotlight. Working undercover meant that his work in the war would also most likely be classified. </p><p>Theseus wondered how to go about making the acquaintance of such an obsessively private individual. It was fortunate that two years later there was a Percival Graves on the guest list for the London War Memorial Dedication Ceremony. Despite the undesired fuss his war hero status would warrant at such a gathering, Theseus decided to attend. Graves turned out to be a bit elusive. He was the type of deliberately anti-social guest who disappeared into corners until he was called out to charm some high ranking official. Fortunately Theseus found someone who could make an introduction. Unfortunately Graves was not as cuddly when he was not cold and tired. He was also easily offended. However, he was not immune to Theseus’ charm and Theseus managed to snag both a dance partner and a new pen pal. </p><p>Percival Graves was devoted to his work which made pursuing him a bit of a challenge. Living on different continents also made things difficult. When they found themselves in the same country they met up for dinners and drinks if a reputable pub or magical speakeasy could be agreed upon. In a few years they were good friends and they could both see themselves becoming more intimate in the future. Theseus allowed Percival to lead the pace of the relationship. This might have been a mistake. A romance between two glaciers moved faster than a romance with Percival Graves. </p><p>They saw each other so infrequently that it took a long time before Percival finally kissed him. And then another long while before they fell naked into Percival’s soft bed. Meticulously, deliberately, and discreetly was the way Percival approached things. Every action was considered and controlled. And faced with Percival’s quiet ways Theseus couldn’t help feeling the need to be slow and gentle, though his smaller lover proved to be far from fragile and not as inexperienced as his blushes suggested. </p><p>Now, as he held Percival close, Theseus was glad that they had taken the time to develop a strong bond of friendship prior to being lovers. A friend was what Percival needed. It was just over a week since he had been rescued from captivity and merely hours since he had collapsed into Theseus’ reassuring embrace. He had not yet broken down completely and maybe he would not at all. Theseus had never seen his friend cry, but over the course of the night he had witnessed a slow unraveling. Percival’s tears came in little fits, sometimes silently, sometimes with barely audible gasps and sniffles. Each small show of vulnerability was over in a few minutes; then his notorious iron control slid once more over his face. </p><p>Theseus stayed nearby and quiet. He hunkered down a bit, pulled his shoulders in, reduced his size. For once he did not want Percival to feel small in comparison. He wanted Percival to remember being powerful and capable and someone who would not let Grindelwald break him. </p><p>So Theseus stayed near and when Percival finally exhausted himself and leaned into his side he wiped away the tears without comment. He told Percival how big he was, how strong and fierce. He could only hope the man believed him.</p>
