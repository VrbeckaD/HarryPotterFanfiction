  <b>Chapter One. A Massive Flashback/Summary</b>
</h1><p>
  <span>Due to everyone's confusion during chapter seven, I have made chapter eight a massive Flashback/Summary chapter. Additionally, Chapter nine will be more detailed than previously planned and include the entirety of chapter seven for clarification. I aim to fix any confusion over this Time Travel, Slash, Crossover and Bashing fanfiction. As always, please comment if you have questions, likes, or just want to chat.</span>

  <span>After winning the war for the side of the Light, Harry Potter had expected things to return to normal in the wizarding world. Whatever normal was in the wizarding world he was sure he wouldn't mind. He only needed 24 hours for his mindset to change. It had all started with a visit to Gringotts. Well, technically it began when a regal-looking owl had swooped into the Hogwarts Infirmary to give him a letter. </span>

  <em>
    <span>Dear Mr. Potter,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It is Gringotts hope that one of our letters has finally made it your way. If you are reading this, we ask that you would be kind enough to respond </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>immediately</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span>. It has come to our attention that your magical guardian has withdrawn large sums of money in your name. This has been an ongoing matter since the night of October-31-1980. Your magical guardian has long since hit a limit that draws a real concern. Over seven billion galleons have only chipped at your large fortune. It still concerns us to see that you have never authorized a single one of these vast withdraws. Please come as soon as possible. This letter will act as a port-key to your account manager’s office. Simply insert the word “Okay.” into any sentence to be transported to London’s Gringotts Wizarding Bank.</span>

  <b>Please See Chapter Three of  'Grandson of the Goblin King' For The Inheritance Test.</b>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>After rereading the Blood Inheritance Test, Harry let his head fall into his hands where they rest on the still-unnamed ancient goblin’s desk. His hands shake violently and his tears began to freely flow. ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Everything I knew, everything I have felt, it has been a lie for years now. They may as well change my ridiculous title to the-boy-who-lived-to-be-a-pawn.</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ he thinks to himself wondering if even those thoughts are his own.  “A puppet. I am nothing more than a living puppet to them.” Harry chokes out through his tears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay, Mr. Potter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Harry growls out still glaring daggers at the parchment in front of him. “No, I’m the furthest thing from okay. I would like to cancel my wedding with Ginerva Margaret Weasley if I still can. Immediately if at all possible.” Harry says lifting his head back up and trying to make himself presentable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is indeed still possible, your majesty. Especially with the evidence, we have gathered against the perpetrators thus far. Before we go any further, however, you will need to undergo a full ritual purge and a full magical cleansing. I apologize, I have yet to introduce myself. I am Director Ragnarök, of Gringotts London Branch, my Prince." said the ancient goblin finally introducing himself then bowing before re-seating himself behind his desk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Embarrassed, Harry stood up and began pacing to relieve some of his stress, "Please Director, call me Harry. I have no idea how to go about fixing any of this.” Harry declares while turning sharply and gesturing to the parchment in front of him. “If you could please explain it to me, I will be very grateful."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We have suspected as much for quite some time, your majesty. Be that as it may, you are the Heir Prince of Svartalfheim and the Heir Prince to the Fae kingdoms. You may think of yourself as Harry but you are Prince Haraldr. Your position as the son of the late Princess Lillian Potter, nee Evans and Lord James Potter holds more weight than we believe the wizards of Midgard to suspect." Director Ragnarök states “Therefore it is for the best that you are healed post haste.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I agree, however, I know nothing in this world comes without a price.” Harry says warily collapsing back into his chair, “What's your price and will it benefit both of us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Director Ragnarök smiled toothily at his Prince, glad that he pulled himself together so quickly. “I do not require monetary compensation for aiding you, my Prince. A magical binding verbal agreement will suffice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry narrowed his eyes in suspicion. “I will ask again what do you want from me and what do we both gain from it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will agree to learn everything you must know as a Prince of your station.” Director Ragnarök states folding his hands in front of him as a Cheshire grin spreads across his weathered face. “Even if it takes you until your official coronation as King you will learn everything required of a Prince of your station.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And should I fail? What then?” Harry demands with a frown. “The usual cost of a binding magical oath is losing one's magic and thus their life force. I refuse to accept that price.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Worry not my Prince, should you fail you will not lose your magic, your life, or your stations.” Director Ragnarök states folding his small hands and lengthy claws in front of him. “Instead, you will be obligated to pay the goblin nation one hundred gallons. Our full body flush costs a total of 100 galleons. That includes removing potions and spells, as well as the blocking of your magical core and natural abilities. As your account manager, I assure you, you have more than enough to cover the cost and continue to live lavishly for eons to come even without counting annual revenue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Deal.” Harry agreed with a nod, the price of losing was steep but fair and apparently he could afford it.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>“We have discovered Prince Loki is under the influence of both mind control and the imperius curse and has been for years now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even when he attempted to conquer Midgard last year?” Harry asks surprised having heard the story of the battle of New York from the Dursleys.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. It concerns us that no one noticed this sooner.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, this certainly changes things doesn't it.” King Jerath states tapping his chin thoughtfully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you mean?” Harry asks his grandfather, King Jerath, confused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should Prince Loki have been under another's control he would not be responsible for his crimes as they aren't his own.” King Jareth patiently explains.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My Queen and I believe the same however convincing the Allfather of this will be difficult.” Eir sighs. “Oh, where are my manners? I am Healer Eir of Asgard and I will be aiding your healers, Prince Haraldr. Due to my inability to notice Prince Loki’s predicament sooner, I will be taking a backseat while still aiding your healers wherever I can.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>“Hail Prince Harry, I am Healer Elen Briarson of Alfheim’s Light Kingdom. Beside me is Healer Longclaw of Midgard’s New York. We will be your Head Healers today, okay?" A high elf greets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Um, okay."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please lay back on the stone table and try to relax now. This process is painful but you must not fight it.” Head Healer Longclaw instructs and Harry quickly moves to obey absentmindedly wondering how those words are meant to relax.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We will be removing the remains of the deceased Horcrux inside the scar on your forehead before flushing your system of potions. Next, we will begin healing the damage done to your body. Then we will move on to removing the charms and compulsions affecting your magic and brain. Do you understand?" Head Healer Longclaw pauses to ask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Um, I think so," Harry answers furrowing his brows in thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Given your predicament that is all we can ask for, your majesty." Head Healer Elen says with a sad nod of his head. "The first portion of this procedure will not hurt too much but you will feel some discomfort. Then the blood glamour will be removed." Head Healer Elen of Alfheim says pausing to wince as he reads the parchment in his hands. Harry begins to wonder if all this will be worth it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How much of you has been changed or held back will determine the level of pain you will experience." Head Healer Longclaw continues sympathetically. "Finally, your magical blocks will be removed. This will hurt immensely as your magic is an intrinsic part of you. As you have such a large proportion of your magic blocked this will take a few hours at the minimum. You will hopefully pass out during the removal of the blood glamor. I would not wish what has been done to you on my worst enemies.” Harry absentmindedly glances at the guards guarding the doors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With one final overview of the gathered ingredients, the Head Healers nod their heads seemingly satisfied. “We are ready to begin your healing, your majesty. You should lie back.” Hesitantly lying down on the stone slab Harry is unsurprised when he finds himself bound by magic and unable to move. He suspected something like this may happen. “To ensure everyone's safety you will be bound by magic to that slab. If you interrupt this ritual, you will die and take all of us with you.” That is all that is said before musical chanting fills the air.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>“Master.” someone with a deep gravelly voice mourns as they card their pleasantly warm fingers through his long raven hair. “Do not worry, you will get your revenge, Master. Not even their deaths will end their suffering. I will not allow it.” The last part is more of a growled out whisper, one that Harry instinctively knows most wouldn't be able to hear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I not dead?” Harry asks aloud ignoring the stranger's voice in his surprise. Looking around, he can find only see an endless void and darkness surrounding him and the stranger but he knows magic is capable of making such illusions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your soul is one soul I cannot, and will not, take Master.” the dark-haired man responds. He's dressed in a white and gold robe similar to the one Harry is wearing now. The robe he died in. All at once the knowledge of what has been done to him comes back along with the memory of the ritual procedure he was undergoing to fix the issues.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I'm not dead then who are you?” Harry asks back to raising his guard once it settles in that he is in a strange place with someone he does not know and the stranger has yet to identify himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I go by many and all names. Most commonly I am called Death. Personally I prefer the names, Thanatos and Mors. You, however, may call me whatever you wish, Master.” Death responds still carding his fingers through Harry's hair like one would to pet a familiar or a small child.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why am I here? Where is here?” Harry asks before realizing they are speaking telepathically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are my master. The Master of Death.” Death announces happily but sounding completely serious. “We are in the realm of the in-between. You have obtained immortality, command over death itself or myself as such is the case and any power you herforth desire. You have been gifted every mortal’s dream.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do I have to do as The Master of Death?” Harry asks as he realizes the futility of his situation. ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Even dead I can't escape responsibilities.</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ Harry muses to himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I desire company and entertainment first and foremost. As for your duties, you haven't any really. You may keep me company and be a source of amusement for me if you wish, but other than that, you're free to do anything you want. Except die, that is. In any case, the title of Master of Death is non-returnable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean by ‘I can do anything’?” he asks already planning on getting his revenge on the light now that he knows he's free of any more expectations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can go to other worlds, planets, galaxies, universes, dimensions, timelines, wherever you desire. You can be reborn, have unlimited powers, riches beyond any mortals dreams. You can have anything, be anyone. You can relieve any life of your choice. Of course, right now you only have the one… Each option allows changes to occur in a new timeline or dimension.” Death says finishing off upon seeing his masters' hopeful expression. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could you…could you send me back to my body and then... Take me and my family to my childhood?” he asks hopefully</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes," Death agrees seemingly waiting on something. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blinking slowly, Harry makes the decision. He will go back to his current body once again and this time the Light </span>
  <em>
    <span>will </span>
  </em>
  <span>fail. "I’ve made my decision," Harry stated. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course, Master."</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>“So... to reiterate while you were in your healing coma you met Lord Death himself. From what we have gathered you have been allowed to remember only part of your conversation with the primordial being. Still, you remember you managed to convince him to allow you to live so long as Death exists. Not only that but you also managed to convince Lord Death to hand over mastery of his domain and self to you.” King Jareth states staring his grandson Prince Haraldr down while taping his nails on his throne. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In addition to this frankly amazing feat, you persuaded Lord Death to bestow our family a second chance. A second chance that will rewrite time for those living who you currently consider family to an unknown beginning point in your childhood. According to your agreement, this second chance will be given to us freely so long as we deliver our vengeance on the self-titled light wizards and witches of Great Britain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I mean, I realize this probably sounds completely crazy and you obviously have a lot going for you being a King and all.” Prince Haraldr rambles to his grandfather fidgeting in his place in front of the throne.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>King Jareth breaks out into manic laughter before seemingly calming down only to leap from his throne and place his hand on his grandson’s shoulders. “I do believe there is hope for you yet, Prince Haraldr. Even unconscious and delirious with pain you have managed to give our people a second chance. Tell me, have you traveled back in time before?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course.” Prince Haraldr states somehow instinctively affronted by the thought of not doing so. “I used a time-turner in my third year trying to save my late Godfather, Sirius Black.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, a wizard made time turner.” King Jerath states taping his chin in thought. “Those are much different from true time turners let alone true Time Magic. Wizard made time turners send your body back in time and only for a few hours” King Jerath explains while beginning to leave the throne room and walk through the castle. “This journey will no doubt be much different.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, what will this do then?” Prince Haraldr asks alarmed and confused hurrying to follow his grandfather through the castle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This will send us back to our old bodies at an undisclosed point of time during your childhood.” King Jerath states making a sharp turn and rounding another corridor. “All our current knowledge, magic, possessions, land, gold, properties, familiars, soulbonds- everything will come with us.” King Jerath explains </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your grandmother, Queen Sarah, is already talking to Director Bloodaxe of Midgard’s New York and Director Ragnarök of Midgard’s London. They both plan to speak to the rest of the Gringotts Directors across the realms. We plan to move all your Midgardian vaults, possessions, land, gold and properties to a separate location here in Svartalfheim.” King Jerath states before spinning around to face him from a doorway. “Those Midgardian wizards will regret </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever </span>
  </em>
  <span>daring to hurt you.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>Loki’s mind and magic have been under another’s influence for 10 years now. He has watched the proceedings as a passenger within his own body horrified to discover few noticed the changes in him. It all came to a head a year and a half ago when he attempted to take over Midgard against his will. Thankfully he was stopped by a team of powerful midgardians. Unfortunately, he was locked in Asgard’s prison without a trial immediately after. Loki has spent the past year and 3 months thinking over his predicament. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It has only been during the past three months that he has managed to convince anyone that he isn't in control of his own actions. Of those aware, it is only Heir Prince Thor, Queen Frigga, Asgard’s Gatekeeper Heimdall, and Asgard’s Head Healer Eir seem to care. As it is they were the ones to notice his change in behavior he can't help but be grateful. Still, he’s keeping secrets. He knows they're aware. Ever since he was healed from the mind control he’s begun having memories returned to him. Memories of meeting with his soulmate in his dreams the year before he fell from the Bifrost.</span>
