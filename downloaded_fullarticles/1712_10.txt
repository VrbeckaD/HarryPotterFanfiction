    <p>Just another day....waking up,eating,trying to survive this dull hell,staying alone,reading,strolling through the forest,going to sleep.Nothing more than the same old routine...<br/> Oh,By the way,I forgot to introduce myself,how rude of me!<br/> Name's Raven.Raven Helena Black.I am 11 years old and...There's nothing much about me.I'm just plain old me.<br/> Everything was being as ordinary as usual and nothing was interesting.....until....</p><p><b>Principal:Miss Black?<br/> </b> <b>me:*looks at her shyly*Y-yes....?<br/> </b> <b>Principal:Someone is here for you.Come with me.</b></p><p>Everyone started muttering,a soft murmur taking over the whole canteen,while I was hyperventilating a little,from too much attention brought upon myself,and for being scared of the unknown.Someone is looking for me?!Who could it be?Relatives?But that's impossible...I was told I had no family anymore...</p><p>Entering shyly in the principal's office,I notice a young man,in his late 20s or early 30s,perhaps,dressed entirely in black,with medium dark hair and dark eyes...well...he has a big nose too but *cough*.Is he an overgrown bat?O-or....a vampire?Nah...Those are only in Romania,and they have red eyes...right?RIGHT?!<br/> Standing there in a corner shyly,trying not to be stared upon,biting my lip and looking down,I await further orders.I had no clue how I should behave,since I've never been visited before.</p><p><b>Bat:What happened to this girl?Why is she trembling like a lost,frightened pup?<br/> </b> <b>Principal:*shrugs*She's always been this way.Different,lonely and eccentric,quite the attention seeker,yet she goes all shy and embarrassed.I never understood her.<br/> </b> <b>me:*looks away**mutters*I-I-'m s-sorry...<br/> </b> <b>Bat:Would you mind leaving us alone?<br/> </b> <b>Principal:*nods**leaves*Behave yourself.<br/> </b> <b>me:*nods*Mhm...<br/> </b> <b>Bat:Take a seat.</b></p><p>I sit down quietly,trying to act calm,which....of course failed.He is a rather intimidating looking individual,towering over me with great height,but his style suits him perfectly,might I say...</p><p><b>Bat:You are miss Black,I presume?<br/> </b> <b>me:Y-Yes,sir.<br/> </b> <b>Snape:*hands me an envelope*Read this.</b></p><p> </p><p>

  <b>Snape:This is Diagon Alley.First,we shall get you your wand.</b>
</p><p>We arrived in front of a shop called Ollivander's Wand Shop where an old man with fluffy white hair like cotton candy was staying behind a counter,fidgeting and polishing a wand.</p><p><b>Ollivander:Good day to you,Proffesor Snape.I suppose this is Miss Black?<br/> </b> <b>Snape:Indeed.<br/> </b> <b>Ollivander:Come closely,deary.Now...What wand would suit you....<br/> </b> <b>me:E-eh...?<br/> </b> <b>Ollivander:Oh,you didn't know?The wizard never chooses his wand,Miss Black!The wand chooses him.*goes to look for a wand*<br/> </b> <b>me:I'm....not even surprised anymore...<br/> </b> <b>Ollivander:Perhaps...</b> <b>10¾",vine wood,dragon heartstring core?</b></p><p>I took the want in my hand gingerly,then stared at it unsurely.<em>Wh-what should I do?!</em><br/>I stare at the eldery man confused,and seeing so,he gave me a sign to do something.<br/><br/></p><p>
  <b>Ollivander:Well what are you waiting for?Give it a go!</b>
</p><p>I blinked 3 times in confuson,shook the wand in the direction of the shelves,out of instinct.Consequently,and contrary to all my wishes, all the books on the shelves fell on the ground,while I got panicky and started apologizing,putting the wand back on the counter.</p><p><b>Ollivander:No,don't worry.Hmmm....14",willow,unicorn hair core?<br/><br/> </b> Trying the new wand proved to be yet another failure,as the lightbulb snapped and the windows broke.Am I really that destructive?!<br/><b><br/> </b> <b>me:S-SORRY!*squeaking*<br/> </b> <b>Ollivander:*shaking his head*Don't worry.....but....could it be...Thestral tail-hair,with Phoenix feather...ash wood...15"</b></p><p>I noticed Snape looking rather curious about this type of wand.Taking it,I waved it around skeptically,and all of a sudden,a warm dark shadow started blowing softly around me,glowing blue petals floating along it,and a black rose,with blood red petal ends appeared in my hair.I was shocked beyond belief,might I say,so much that I was stunned in place,with the rose in my hand.Did I really do this?How was I capable of doing such magic,without even realizing what was happening?!</p><p>
  <b>Ollivander:*clapping*I never thought I would give this particularly powerful wand to such a beautiful young lady.Truly,this wand suits you,both in power,and aspect.A rare,dark and mysterious beauty.Take care of it,and learn how to use it to its full potential*winks*</b>
</p><p>Still awestruck,I could only stare at the smiling man and nod fast,clearly excited.<br/> <b><br/> </b><b>Snape:How much?<br/> </b><b>Ollivander:*shakes head*Nothing!Consider it a gift!It's not always,when I meet a child with such potential!Have a great year at Hogwarts!<br/> </b><b>me:Th-thank you!Th-thank you so much,Mr.Ollivander!</b></p><p>After this,we went to have my robes done,the books bought and everything else.</p><p>
  <b>Snape:Go and get yourself some ice-cream.I will be there in a minute.</b>
</p><p>Nodding,still giddy after the wand-picking,I went to the ice-cream vendor,Fortescue, and got a scoop of chocolate and one of strawberry.Waiting there,I saw many kids with their families,buying their school stuff merrily,a particular red haired family standing out and catching my eye.They look like such a loving family....My heart aches for that...</p><p>
  <b>-?-:Um...excuse me,miss...</b>
</p><p>I turn around surprised and see boy with dark,messy hair and emerald green eyes,standing a bit shorter than me,looking lost.</p><p><b>me:Y-yes...?<br/> </b> <b>-?-:I'm Harry.Harry Potter.And I'm a bit lost.<br/> </b> <b>me:I'm Raven.Raven Black.Who were you here with?<br/> </b> <b>Harry:There was this rather tall person....like...VERY tall.His name is Hagrid.He has a huge brown beard and has a calm face.<br/> </b> <b>me:Like...this guy over there,coming in our direction?<br/> </b> <b>Harry:Oh,yes!Thank you!<br/> </b> <b>Hagrid:'Ey 'Arry,been lookin' for yea.And yea've made a friend!What's yer name?<br/> </b> <b>me:I'm Raven.Raven Black,sir.<br/><br/> </b> Hagrid's face had a fast flash,then he shook my hand and smiled.<br/><b><br/> </b> <b>Hagrid:Friend o' 'Arry's a friend o' mine!Who're yea ''ere with?<br/> </b> <b>me:umm....I believe his is a teacher at Hogwarts...Professor Snape...?He's tall and dressed in all black.*whispers*Quite like an overgrown bat*giggles*</b></p><p>Harry and Hagrid laughed with me for a while,then they had to go.After a short time,I see Snape coming my way nonchalantly.</p><p>
  <b>Snape:You better take care of your new pets,understood,miss Black?</b>
</p><p>Then,he showed me a gorgeous black kitten with icy blue eyes,just like mine,and a pitch black owl with red eyes.<br/> <b><br/> </b><b>me:Th-they are gorgeous....Th-thank you so much,professor!*tears welling up*Th-thank you so much...<br/> </b><b>Snape:Don't go all emotional on me,miss Black,and let's go.You will be spending the remaining time until school with me,and it is still I who will guide you to the train to Hogwarts.<br/> </b><b>me:B-but...!I-it's too much to ask!Y-you could just drop me off at the orphanage and be rid of me...!Y-you've done way too much for me in just a few hours...!</b></p><p>He looked at me with a<b> <em>"Just shut up and move"</em> </b>face and walked off,having to follow him.<br/>Apparating again,we get in front of a rather fancy looking house.Walking slowly inside,I kept looking around,mesmerized by how sophisticated and classy this place looked.<br/>He used a spell to make my things go in a room that will serve as my new guest room</p><p>
  <strong>Snape:Dinner at 8.Don't be late.</strong>
</p><p>Then he left,allowing me to get cozy.It feels so nice...the bed is soft and comfy,like I've never seen nor felt before...it was warm in the room,with the fire cracking in the fireplace,soothing my every senses and making the atmosphere so heartwarming  family-like,that my tears started overflowing from all the emotions flooding my heart.</p><p>I grab the blanket and put it around me,standing in front of the fireplace,contemplating about everything that has been happening so far...And apparently,all of it caused me to fall asleep prematurely on the warm carpet,with the blanket over me,and hugging a fluffy pillow,completely oblivious to the fact that I forgot of the dinner appointed.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <b>*Severus' PoV*</b> </em>
</p><p>Where is that idiotic girl?The food is getting cold.She is 10 minutes late!</p><p>Making my way to the guest room,I see a bundle on the floor,which without much deducing,I realised it was her,wrapped around the blanket,sleeping peacefully.Dried tears were left on her cheeks,yet the ghost of a smile was still visible.What an annoying little pest.<br/>I put her on the bed,using a simple spell and left the room without a word.<br/>This Black girl...could she be like that bloody bastard,or like...<em><strong>her</strong>...?</em></p><p>That is left to be seen at school.</p>
