  <i>“It’s all right. I’ve got you.” Harry just holds him and repeats those words, over and over.</i>
</p>
<hr width="75%"/><p><br/>
</p><p>The door is open, which <i>never</i> happens, and Draco has the vague impression that someone is standing there… someone who hands Harry a set of clean robes. Not the flimsy sort of robes that Draco wears between clients, but proper wizarding robes.</p><p>“We’re all set.” The voice is hard and sounds familiar, but Draco can’t be bothered to place it.</p><p>Harry helps Draco into the robes. “We’re leaving,” he says. “You owe that woman nothing.”</p><p>The light outside is too yellow, too bright, too <i>real</i>. There is too much noise. </p><p>The squeeze of Apparition hurts.</p><p>The house they come to is quiet and dark. </p><p>“I’ll make some tea,” the voice says and disappears down a hallway.</p><p>Harry leads him to the bathroom and starts the shower. He helps Draco take off the robes and step into the streaming water. Harry is barefoot and shirtless, but he is still wearing those Muggle jeans he likes so much. He doesn’t seem to mind that they are getting soaked as he helps Draco wash every inch of himself. </p><p>With fingers slick with foamy soap, Harry washes off the touch of <i>so many</i> people, healing hurts, seen and unseen, with whispered words. Gentle fingers wash his hair, pulling free the tangles as they do. There is nothing sexual about Harry’s touch… and it is the most intimate thing that has happened to Draco in years.</p><p>Tears—<i>his</i> tears!—begin to flow and mix with the water that is running down his face.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>It feels like a dream. The world is soft and foggy around the edges and Draco is finding it hard to focus on anything.<p>Except Harry.</p><p>Harry as he dries him carefully. Harry as he helps into soft flannel pajama bottoms and one of those stupid Muggle why-shirts, or whatever it is Harry calls them. This one is ratty and smells like Harry. </p><p>
  <i>Harry. Harry. Harry.</i>
</p><p>Harry’s hands. Harry’s touch. Harry’s shirt.</p><p>Harry’s bed.</p><p>
  <i>No!</i>
</p><p>Draco <i>cannot</i> go there, and he pulls against Harry for the first time. </p><p>There is a window. The draperies are dark and heavy but they are pulled back and sunlight streams in… onto a chair. And Draco sits in it because his legs won’t hold him up anymore.</p><p>He can see into a tiny overrun garden, and into a slightly better tended one behind a tall stone wall. He can see the backs of another row of houses and, beyond that what might be a park, lightly brushed with the first touches of spring.</p><p>
  <i>Breathe in… breathe out.</i>
</p><p>“Harry, go dry off. You’re making a mess,” the voice says. </p><p>
  <i>Breathe in… breathe out.</i>
</p><p>“Have some tea,” the voice says, somewhere between an order and a question.</p><p>Draco wants tea—<i>he does!</i> But he turns, automatically, almost unwillingly, toward the voice… the tea… and reaches for the cup.</p><p>The mug. It’s a rainbow mug and the hands holding it out for him are rough and flecked with ginger hair. </p><p>Draco looks up into the face of Ronald Weasley. The voice. The softness fades a little; Draco isn’t ready to deal with edges.</p><p>“Easy, Malfoy,” he says, his voice steady, calming. “There’s a bruise healing potion in that. I can give you some Skele-Gro, too, if you need it. But you’ll have to take <i>that</i> straight. And not on an empty stomach.”</p><p>Draco sips the tea… and finds that he can’t answer. </p><p>Questions flood his brain, but he can give none of them voice.</p><p>“You’re all right, Malfoy,” Weasley says. “You’re at Harry’s house—Grimmauld Place… used to belong to the Blacks. You may have been here before, actually.”</p><p>He has. Not since he was very little, though. He wants to say so… to say <i>something</i>… but he can’t. He <i>should</i> be able to talk. He can cry. A touch of panic laces through him.</p><p>“Easy, Malfoy. You’re okay. That silencing curse was a nasty one. It might take a day or so to wear off completely.” </p><p>Draco nods slowly. <i>Breathe in… breathe out.</i></p><p>“I brought soup, too. Do you want some?”</p><p>Draco nods again.</p><p>Weasley hands it to him and then takes a few steps back, giving him the space he so desperately needs. The fact that he cannot stand to have Weasley within arms’ reach when he had a complete stranger <i>inside</i> of him just a few hours before seems beyond ridiculous…. </p><p>Draco is appalled when his hands begin to shake, rattling the spoon against the sides of the bowl.</p><p>“You’re all right, Malfoy,” Weasley says again.</p><p>By the time Harry returns, Draco has made a credible attempt at eating his soup. It’s thick and golden, and with Weasley lounging against the doorframe, Draco can bring the spoon to his mouth without spilling any.</p><p>“Maybe you should sleep?” Harry suggests, nodding towards the bed. </p><p>
  <i>No!</i>
</p><p>“Transfigure the chair to make it sort of a recliner, Harry,” Weasley suggests, his voice low. “And leave the curtains open.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Trust me, Harry.” </p><p>Weasley pulls a blanket out of the chest at the foot of the bed, inspects it closely, gives his wand the gentle wave of a cleaning spell, and then another, more vigorous and it becomes a violent shade of orange which clashes horribly with… well everything. The Chudley Cannons. </p><p>Draco feels the corners of his mouth turn up a little. </p><p>With a roll of his eyes, Harry takes the blanket and covers him with it. </p><p>“Harry.” He forces the word past unused vocal cords, past the familiar choking feeling. It sounds harsh, painful. It <i>is</i> painful. “Stay.”</p><p>“Always.” </p><p>Harry climbs into the chair, under the horrible blanket, and Draco thinks Weasley enlarges the chair a bit more. As soon as Draco feels Harry’s arms around him, he falls asleep.</p><p>Safety.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>If Draco tries hard enough, he can keep the fog pulled comfortably around him. He stares out into the garden. He can see daffodils peeking through the tangles of last year’s weeds and dried leaves.<p>He thinks he might go out and tend them a bit. Someday. Not today.</p><p>Weasley and Granger seem to live in the house with Harry, but he doesn’t see much of them. Weasley, he gathers, is an Auror; Granger works in the Department of Magical Legal Affairs. </p><p>Harry is <i>not</i> an Auror, which surprises Draco, and while he is in and out of the house quite a bit, Draco cannot seem to figure out what he actually <i>does</i>. What he doesn’t do is hover, and for that Draco is grateful. Conversation is hard, and even though Draco cannot sleep without Harry’s arms... the day is coming, he knows, when Harry will want <i>more.</i></p><p>Solitude is better. Solitude is safety.</p><p>Weasley pops in once or twice a day, staying at the edge of the fog, asking if there is anything that Draco needs.</p><p>Granger tends to shatter the fog, dragging the world, and Draco’s place in it, into crisp focus. Draco thinks it’s probably a good thing, but he rather wishes she wouldn’t.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Draco, I can’t have her arrested,” Granger says. She’s brought tea, and seems to intend to stay while Draco drinks it. “She hasn’t broken <i>any</i> laws. I think she may have entirely shredded the concept of human decency… but she didn’t break the law.”</p><p>Granger looks crushed. </p><p>“I know,” Draco says, the words still not coming easily to him. “I did read the contract before I signed it.”</p><p>“Did you?”</p><p>“I knew what I was getting myself into… I just…” Draco feels his voice fall away, remembering the cold and the hunger and the dirty feeling of knowing that he would have gone with <i>anyone</i> and done <i>whatever</i> they asked of him… just so he could make his reparations payment, just so he wouldn’t have to spend the rest of his life in Azkaban. With a sick twist in his stomach, he knew he would have signed Elladora’s contract whatever it said…but he did read it first.</p><p>“I thought it would be better than Azkaban,” he whispers.  </p><p>He is grateful when Granger doesn’t ask if it actually was. He still isn’t sure.</p><p>“The others?” Draco asks. He never saw anyone else… but there must have been other people who worked there. </p><p>“I interviewed them,” Granger says, fingering her Department of Magical Legal Affairs badge. “Three girls and a boy. All Squibs. They all seem to be there voluntarily.”</p><p>
  <i>I was there voluntarily.</i>
</p><p>Not all of Draco’s intended words actually make it <i>into</i> words… and by the patient blink of Granger’s eyes, he thinks maybe they haven’t this time. “I was there voluntarily,” he repeats, certain that it is out loud this time.</p><p><i>I volunteered.</i> He isn’t sure if that makes it better or worse. </p><p>“True,” Granger agrees. “But they don’t owe her a ridiculous sum of money. They have set hours, access to healing potions, even the ability to refuse clients. And they can talk. Not to their clients, apparently, but to each other. And me.”</p><p>“Can they cry?” he asks. </p><p>He didn’t mean to say <i>that</i> out loud. For almost three years his only conversant was himself… he hadn’t bothered to censor his thoughts, they were one of the few things he actually owned after all; and, of course, he hadn’t had the ability to put them into audible words.  </p><p>“I don’t know, Draco,” Granger says softly.</p><p>The light in the white, windowless room was bright, but it was a suffocating, unnatural bright… white and raw, not golden like sunlight or candlelight. Draco blinks and he is back in the room… waiting. </p><p>Waiting for the Polyjuice to force him into someone else’s body, waiting for the next client to come through the door… will they be gentle or will they hurt him? What will they want from him? What will they <i>take</i> from him?</p><p>Waiting. Draco was always waiting. Waiting, waiting, waiting. </p><p>Waiting for it to be over.</p><p>
  <i>Breathe in, breathe out.</i>
</p><p>“You’re all right, Draco,” Granger says. “Do you want me to open the window?”</p><p>He nods, concentrating on breathing. </p><p>It was Weasley who first thought to open the window. Despite the obvious signs of spring, the air is chill, but it is bitingly fresh and Draco finds it is easier to breathe when the air stings his lungs. </p><p>At first Harry objected, concerned that Draco would catch a cold, or actually freeze. The look on Weasley’s face was priceless. “You’re a Wizard, Harry. Cast a bloody warming charm!” he said. </p><p>Draco had smiled. A real one. His first in since before the war. </p><p>“Better?” Granger asks. “Oh, that reminds me.” She places his wand down on the arm of the chair. </p><p><i>His</i> wand.</p><p>Almost hesitantly, as if he isn’t sure it’s real, isn’t sure he can really touch it, he picks it up. Magic thrums through him.</p><p>“I got it cleared this morning,” she says. “You paid your reparations. It’s yours again.”</p><p>Draco looks at her, his eyes threatening to overflow. <i>He has his wand.</i> He is no longer helpless… unarmed… subject to the whims of others. </p><p>He wants to say, thank you. But he can’t. A squeeze like the crush of Elladora’s silencing curse grips his throat. </p><p>Granger nods. She understands.  “Cast your own warming charm, Draco,” she says.</p><p>He swallows, and swallows again, and does.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>After three uncomfortable nights on the transfigured chair, Draco moves to the bed.<p>
  <i>He can do this. He just has to remember to breathe.</i>
</p><p>
 Harry’s eyes really are beautiful, but they are closed now as he leans into Draco’s kisses. Draco tries to find his rhythm as he moves his lips against Harry’s, as their tongues dance… but he can’t quite. The movements aren’t natural, they feel <i>forced</i>, and Draco can’t remember how to unforce them… he can’t remember how to kiss and mean it.</p><p>
  Draco pulls on the drawstring of Harry’s pajama bottoms and slips his hand inside. And Harry’s eyes pop open, startled. 
  
</p><p>
  “Draco? What are you…? I mean you aren’t even properly healed yet. Are you?”
 
</p><p>
 He isn’t. The healing and nourishing potions have been working miracles… but Draco is far, far from healed. 

</p><p>
 “Don’t you… want me… like this?” Draco askes, his voice trembling.
  
</p><p>
  Harry pulls Draco’s hand up and to his mouth. He kisses the inside of his palm. “I will <i>always</i> want you,” Harry says, interlacing their fingers. “But not like this. Not when you’re not ready.”

</p><p>
  Draco feels hot tears spilling out of his eyes. “I want to make you happy,” he whispers, not looking at Harry.  
 
</p><p>
 “I <i>am</i> happy. You’re here, I’m <i>beyond</i> happy. But if you’re doing something that hurts you or scares you or even that you just don’t want to do…. Draco, that will <i>never</i> make me happy.” Harry runs his thumb along his cheekbone, smearing the tears. “Look at me. Please.”

  </p><p>
 It takes him a moment, but Draco finally raises his eyes to meet Harry’s.
  
</p><p>
  “I love you. Okay? I’m not going to stop.” 
 
</p><p>
  “I’m scared.”
 
</p><p>
 “I know.”
 
</p><p>
 “I don’t know how to do this….” He sort of collapses on the bed, turning away from Harry, his eyes firmly downcast again. “Harry, I fuck people. I think that’s all I remember… People I never wanted, people who never wanted <i>me</i>… they didn’t even see my face… they used me, but they didn’t see me….” He pulls his knees to his chest and lets the tears fall. “I don’t remember… I <i>can’t</i> remember…”
  
</p><p>
 “Shhhh…,” Harry wraps his arms around him and presses his lips to his shoulder. “It’s okay.” 
 
</p><p>
“Harry, I don’t remember who I am….”
 
</p><p>
  Harry’s arms tighten. “I remember. You’re Draco Malfoy. You can be a bit of a git at times, but I think I love you all the more because of it.  You have this perfect Pureblood smile, and you use it like a mask, or sometimes a weapon, but the moment that smile becomes <i>real</i>, Draco, it can light up a whole room. When you direct that precious smile at me, I almost can’t breathe and all I can think about is kissing you."
 
</p><p>
  Harry is kissing him.  His mouth presses against his shoulder again and again before moving along his back… to his other shoulder… soft and gentle, with an occasional touch of tongue.
  
</p><p>
  “You’re excellent at Potions, and your hands move so perfectly, like a dance when you’re brewing… but you like Transfiguration more, and you like Charms even more, but you would never tell anyone because making a teacup waltz with a spoon is just too damn whimsical.... You turn up your nose at “pub food” and you won’t eat meat unless you absolutely have to and you love sweets. You know that treacle tart is my favorite, even though I never told you, and you used to bring it for us to share and then let me eat your piece too, which is how I knew, for the first time, that you loved me.”
  
</p><p>
   A gentle pull on his hip, an invitation to turn back towards Harry. Draco complies. Because he <i>wants</i> to. Because he wants <i>Harry.</i> He will always want Harry. It’s the only thing he’s sure of.
 
</p><p>
  “You are strong and clever and cunning, and you can be downright vicious when someone hurts someone that you care about. You would do anything—literally <i>anything</i>—for your mother. She calls you her little dragon, and you say you hate it, but it’s a lie; you love it. And you are brave. So much braver than you give yourself credit for. You practically threw your fucking <i>wand</i> at me, which is the <i>only</i> reason that I’m alive today.”
 
</p><p>
 “Harry…”

</p><p>
 Harry is crying now, too. Their foreheads are pressed together, and Draco can feel Harry’s tears, mixing with his own, and running together down his cheeks and over his chest.  “And you’re stubborn. Too stubborn to die, too stubborn to spend the rest of your life in Azkaban, too stubborn to let them beat you. You did what you had to do and you <i>survived.</i> You’re alive and you’re here. And I love you.” 
 
</p><p>
 “How? <i>Why?</i> I sold myself… to that woman… to that place. I sold my whole <i>self</i>, Harry.” Draco’s voice breaks. “I know you know. You were <i>there</i>. You know what I did… what I <i>let</i> them do to me.” 
 
</p><p>
“Shhh… Draco… You didn’t have a choice. I <i>know</i> that. And I am <i>so</i> sorry. It was terrible and horrible… I can’t even imagine… and you should <i>never</i> have had to.” Harry’s voice is in tatters. “And I am so, <i>so</i> sorry for my part in it. For not knowing how much you needed from me… for not seeing you. How could I <i>not</i> have known it was you?”
 
</p><p>
  Draco can’t answer and just lets Harry cry, shaking against him, holding him tightly. 
 
</p><p>
  “You survived it, Draco,” Harry says at last. “You walked out of there.”
  
</p><p>
  For a moment, Draco <i>knows</i> who he is. Not a body, used and broken, but the real Draco Malfoy. “Potter, if you hadn’t found me when you did, I would have <i>crawled</i> out of there with the ends of my ribs sticking into my lungs.”
  
</p><p>
  Harry’s snort is not mirthful, and he palms the tears off his face. “I know you would have. Stopping only to make crude gestures at everyone you saw on your way out.”
 
</p><p>
  “Do you really think so?” The moment is over and Draco is lost again, his voice is trembling.
 
</p><p>
 “I know so.”
  
</p><p>
  Draco cups Harry’s cheek, steadying them both. Then slowly, <i>so</i> slowly, Draco moves his mouth toward Harry’s. Harry is still. He doesn’t move and he doesn’t blink, and when their lips meet, the kiss is sweet and chaste. 
  
</p><p>
  And very, <i>very</i> real.
 
</p><p>
  When Draco pulls back, he is crying again and shaking and not sure if he wants to keep kissing Harry… or to run away and hide forever.
 
</p><p>
  Harry’s hand reaches out, so slowly, and brushes away his tears.  “We’re going to get through this, Draco. Together. I promise.”
