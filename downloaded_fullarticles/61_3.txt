    <p>Scorpius stepped into the lounge, stopping in the doorway to watch his boyfriend for a moment. His dark hair was still his messy bed head, he hadn't gotten it cut since before graduation so it was hanging all around his face haphazardly - Scorpius was tempted to try putting it in a bun but Albus would probably protest. His bare chest was paler than it usually was during the summer months and his toned muscles didn't stand out as much any more, especially in this moment as he was hunched over a gaming controller, eyes fixed intently on the television screen in front of him.</p><p>Pushing off the door frame, Scorpius sighed to announce his presence, "Hey babe? I'm going down to the cafe to do some studying, I'll be back in a few hours. Would you like me to bring you anything?" He walked towards Albus and gently ruffled his hair.</p><p>Albus barely glanced up at Scorpius for a moment before turning right back to his game, "Uh, no thanks. Have fun."</p><p>Scorpius frowned and huffed, his hand still resting on his head, "Did you even hear what I said?"</p><p>"Yeah, you said you were going to study," Albus practically snapped.</p><p>An annoyed huff escaped Scorpius' lips as he turned and left the room. He gathered up his history text books and shoved them into his bag hastily. He shuffled out of their flat and slammed the door behind him even though Albus probably didn't even notice.</p><p>Two hours later, around five o'clock, Scorpius returned. He dropped his bag in the kitchen and made it back to he lounge where Albus was in the same position, still grunting at the TV and jamming his fingers into the controller.</p><p>"Hi honey," Scorpius greeted, sitting down on the couch next to him this time.</p><p>"Hey," Albus replied distractedly, not even glancing his way.</p><p>"I got a lot of studying done and I figured we could go out and get some dinner soon, what do you think?‚Äù Scorpius asked.</p><p>"Er, yeah. That's good."</p><p>Scorpius gave him a questioning look, even though he didn't bother even stopping his game to look at him and talk, "I mean, like, leaving in twenty minutes or so to go eat. Can you do that?"</p><p>"Yeah sure," Albus proceeded to violently punch the buttons of the controller, "Fuck- fuck -  I almost had him!" He swore at the game and Scorpius couldn't help but roll his eyes. James and Jonah had introduced him to this game and now he couldn't seem to put it down.</p><p>"You'll be dressed, teeth brushed, and hair combed - ready by then?" Scorpius wondered.</p><p>"Yeah, whatever," Albus replied shortly.</p><p>Scorpius felt his heart tighten sadly at his boyfriend's quipped response. Without saying anything else, Scorpius got up to go get ready. If he was lucky, Albus would be rushing around five minutes before Scorpius wanted to leave trying to get ready.</p><p>And that he did.</p><p>"Albus!" Scorpius called from the hallway, "Are you ready to go? It's nearly been twenty minutes like I said!"</p><p>"Fuck," he heard Albus mutter, then explain into his mic to his gaming buddies that he had to go. It took a few minutes for him to jog out of the lounge. Scorpius merely rolled his eyes, his arms crossed over his chest and his foot tapping impatiently.</p><p>Scorpius flicked through his phone, a bored look on his face. He hadn't uploaded more than two YouTube videos since before graduating from Hogwarts three months ago, yet his fans and followers remained as loyal as ever yet slightly more demanding and, dare he say, annoying. Most of the tweets at him nowadays were asking when he was going to upload another video. Scorpius felt bad of course, he knew he was letting them down but he really didn't have any time to be making videos anymore, not with all the preparing he was required to do in order to take Professor Binn's spot in two weeks. He had nearly four years of school work to cram into one summer, he'd never felt so spread thin.</p><p>Albus shuffled into the foyer wearing khaki shorts that were cuffed just above his knees and a plain white t-shirt with small hole torn in the shoulder. Scorpius could tell he had merely run his fingers through his hair with a bit of water rather than actually combing it because it was still a bit more wild than normal.</p><p>As he struggled to put on his shoes, Scorpius scoffed, pinching the fabric of his shirt where the rip was, "Really, Al? You couldn't have chosen a not ripped shirt?"</p><p>Albus stood back up and frowned, "What I like this shirt? Plus aren't ripped clothes, like, in now?"</p><p>Scorpius rolled his eyes and dropped his hand, "Not ripped like that. It looks like you can't afford a new shirt."</p><p>"Fine!" Albus threw his hands up, "I'll go change!"</p><p>"Good," Scorpius replied, his eyebrows furrowed in frustration. Albus turned around with a slight glare on his face and disappeared down the hall back into their room. He returned a minute later wearing a navy blue graphic tee with white Japanese writing on it that he definitely didn't know what it said. </p><p>Scorpius sighed, it was a little better so he wasn't going to complain.</p><p>"Can we go now?" Albus asked impatiently, walking past Scorpius to the door.</p><p>"Yep," he replied simply, following Albus and locking the door behind them.</p><p>"So where did you want to go eat?" Albus asked as they walked down the stairs.</p><p>"Nothing fancy, just something quick since I knew neither of us wanted to cook," Scorpius shrugged.</p><p>They stepped out onto the street into Muggle Manchester. They lived in an older apartment complex that was owned and ran by wizards, but allowed both Muggles and Wizards to rent, however they had yet to meet a Muggle who agreed to rent from the wacko that was their landlord.</p><p>As they walked, Scorpius glanced down at their hands that were swaying slightly between them. A few months ago he wouldn't have hesitated, hell, he wouldn't have even looked down, he just would have grabbed Albus' hand. Then he would have squeezed it and looked over at Albus who would've smiled and squeezed back. Now, however, as he glanced down at Albus' hand, he had to talk himself up to do it. But just as he was moving to entangle their fingers, Albus shoved his hands in his pockets as if he'd been reading Scorpius' mind and didn't want to hold hands.</p><p>Scorpius' heart sank slightly and he proceeded to shove his hands in his own pockets as if that was his plan all along.</p><p>The couple walked quietly for a few more streets, getting further into town where there were more options. It was a hot summer evening and the sun was still out. People were still bustling around, most adults leaving work, or mum's out with their kids getting food.</p><p>"How about McDonald's?" Scorpius asked and glanced over at his boyfriend.</p><p>Albus scrunched his face up in disgust, "I've already had it twice this week. What about Five Guys?"</p><p>"You know I don't like Five Guys..." Scorpius replied. "Nando's?"</p><p>"Yeah, I could do that," Albus nodded.</p><p>"Great," he said stiffly. They made their way through town, mostly walking in silence. Scorpius hated it.</p><p>"How was your studying?" Albus asked randomly as if only to break the tension around them.</p><p>"Fine," Scorpius shrugged, "I think at this point I just know what I know. This first year is probably going to be hell - no one will take me seriously - but I think I'll be able to figure everything out as I go. McGonagall gave me the curriculum and guidelines to follow, but it's still a lot. Plus on top of that I'll need to be still working towards my actual teaching certification."</p><p>"Yikes," Albus replied, giving Scorpius a sympathetic look, but didn't ask anymore questions.</p><p>"Yeah..." Scorpius trailed off, knowing at this point he didn't care much. "What about you? Have you done any more job searching?"</p><p>"What are you? My mum?" Albus scoffed, kicking a rock into the street angrily.</p><p>"No... I just care about you and don't want you stuck alone in the flat all day while I'm at school in two weeks."</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes, "Okay, fine. No I haven't. But I will. I swear."</p><p>"You can't just expect your parents to pay for everything forever," he gave Albus a pointed look.</p><p>Albus snapped, "I know, okay? I already said I'll get a job. Get off my back, you're not helping anything with your constant nagging!"</p><p>Scorpius felt his heart ache, "Merlin, sorry," he held his hands up in defense, "I'm not trying to nag, I just care about you. Don't you understand?"</p><p>"Whatever," Albus shook his head and sped up a few paces.</p><p>Dinner was tense. Scorpius payed but Albus barely muttered a thank you. They both sat in silence while they ate, not even making eye contact with one another.</p><p>Scorpius' attention was caught, as he sipped at his soda, by a couple younger than them a few tables over. They were giggling and laughing together as the girl fed her boyfriend a small piece of chicken. Their ankles were locked under the table and their foreheads were nearly touching. He felt a rush of sadness as he watched them, remembering when he and Albus used to be like that.</p><p>He glanced over at the other boy who was now slouched down, his phone in one hand and his drink in the other. He was scrolling through Instagram, liking random posts and Scorpius let himself stare. He was his boyfriend after all. He noticed Albus hadn't shaved in a few days and that there were slight bags under his eyes. He was also squinting at his phone as if it was hard to see it.</p><p>Scorpius felt another tug of sadness and longing at his heart. He really hoped him and Albus weren't coming to an end. With all this standoffish vibes and passive aggressiveness, Scorpius couldn't help but worry. He wanted to reach out and touch Albus - not in a sensual way - but just to feel him, know that he's still there underneath this new lazy, bored, and snappy shield he'd built up.</p><p>He reached out his hand across the table and gently brushed his knuckles over Albus' cheek before cupping in gently and running his thumb over his cheekbone.</p><p>Albus didn't even move, he just glanced up at him from though his eyelashes and set his cup down, "What?" He asked, "Is there something on my face?"</p><p>"No," Scorpius replied quietly, "I just miss you."</p><p>Albus glanced around momentarily, "I'm right here though," he chuckled.</p><p>Scorpius frowned and dropped his hand back to the table, "I know."</p><p>The walk back home was less quiet, and Scorpius felt daring enough to hold his hand. He didn't get a squeeze back though, just a small side smile. That was good enough for now.</p><p>When they got back to their flat, Scorpius pushed the door open and let Albus in. They were greeted by Jesper and Brewster, their two cats. Brewster purred happily and twisted through their legs as if trying to trip them. Jesper, however, was slumped against the wall, grooming himself and his greeting was just to pause for a moment and then go back to licking his paw as if he couldn't care less.</p><p>Albus bent over to scratch Brewster and Scorpius was about to crouch down too, but suddenly heard a beeping noise come from the kitchen and he cocked his head curiously until it went off again and he realized what it was.</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath as if to calm himself, "Albus?" He spoke, his voice a little too high pitched as he tried to conceal the sudden anger bubbling up inside him.</p><p>Albus quickly stood back up, scooping up Brewster along the way, "What?" He gave him a curious look.</p><p>"Did you take out the laundry from the washing machine like I asked?"</p><p>Albus froze, pressing his lips into a firm line as he slowly moved his eyes back up to Scorpius', "I... I may have forgotten..."</p><p>Scorpius let out a frustrated groan and shoved past him through the entry way and stomped into the kitchen, "I ask you to do one simple thing, Albus! You can't even hang the washing up! Now our clothes are probably ruined because it's been four hours!" He pulled the washer open and pulled out a stiff, soggy lump of clothes and forced out another frustrated groan.</p><p>"What?" Albus spluttered, letting Brewster jump out of his arms as he stormed after Scorpius, "It's not a big fucking deal! You're so anal about the dumbest shit! We're bloody wizards! I can fix them with a swish of this bloody wand, or do you not remember that?" He shouted back, whipping out his wand and waving at Scorpius who was angrily knelt next to the washing machine. With a quick muttering of a fixing and drying spell from Albus, the clothes were back to good.</p><p>"That's not the point, Albus!" Scorpius shouted back. Brewster had scurried out of the room at the sound of shouting. "It's the fact that I ask you to do simple household chores but you can't seem to get off your bloody arse for long enough to complete them! I'm constantly jumping around, working on my studies and running errands, cleaning and cooking for you while you do shit! You sit on that couch all day and night, cursing at your stupid friends over a stupid video game because you don't think you're good enough to do anything in the real world!"</p><p>Scorpius had struck a cord. Both of their faces were red with anger and Albus' lip was quivering and he couldn't seem to come up with a retaliation. Albus spun on his heel and stomped out of the kitchen. Scorpius heard a door slam and then a muffled shout of, 'Fuck!' Then the sound of Albus kicking something.</p><p>Scorpius let out a jagged breath and pushed his hands through his blond hair stressfully as he dropped back to his bum and leant against the cupboard. He choked and felt the tears spring to his eyes and then fall down his cheeks. Oh God, he was a terrible boyfriend...</p><p>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</p><p>Albus was pacing in the foyer. It was nearly two in the morning and Scorpius had left the flat around ten. He'd left his phone and his keys and Albus was filled with worry and anxiety. He hated fighting - especially with Scorpius - but that's all they seemed to be doing these days and it was wearing him down.</p><p>Scorpius' words kept replying in his head about how lazy he was and about how he wasn't good enough to do anything in the real world.</p><p>That was his biggest fear, not being able to find something he was good at that he could do for the rest of his life. This caused him to procrastinate on job searching, he feared rejection and it was eating him up. It didn't help that he enjoyed gaming and that his YouTube channel had suddenly blown up after he started releasing gaming videos and doing live streams of him gaming. He now had more followers and subscribers than Scorpius which had never been a thing before - Scorpius was the Internet famous one...</p><p>There was suddenly rustling behind the front door and Albus stopped his pacing and Scorpius pushed the door open.</p><p>Albus let out a massive sigh of relief and quickly stepped towards him. He was about to pull Scorpius into a bone crushing hug but hesitated as he got a look at the worn look on Scorpius' face. They both definitely needed a hug but both boys were too scared to in case the other snapped or didn't reciprocate.</p><p>"Where... where have you been? I was so worried about you," Albus breathed out.</p><p>Scorpius furrowed his brows at him, "I just went for a walk and stopped at a bar. No need to worry about me."</p><p>"You left your phone, I just... I didn't know."</p><p>Scorpius was about to reply bitterly but saw the concern that was etched into Albus' eyes and he felt himself soften, "Albus, I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for snapping a you earlier, it was selfish of me."</p><p>"I'm sorry too," Albus stepped closer to him, "I'm sorry for not listening to you, and helping you around the flat - that's selfish of me."</p><p>Scorpius pulled his bottom lip between his teeth trying to stop the tears he felt coming on again. He nodded in agreement to the selfish statement.</p><p>Albus reached out and gently held Scorpius' biceps, guiding them closer together for a moment before connecting their lips strongly. Scorpius' let the tears fall as he kissed Albus back just as feverishly. His hands went to Albus' unruly hair, and Albus' dropped to his hips, gripping him tight and pulling him closer.</p><p>The kiss didn't fix everything - it didn't explain why everything had been so tense between them - but it sure did make them feel better in the moment.</p><p>The boys stumbled through the hall towards their room, tripping over their own feet and the clothes they managed to shed along the way. Albus pushed Scorpius back onto the bed and climbed on top of him, quickly moving to kiss him again, as if he couldn't bear to have their lips separated for more than a few seconds.</p><p>"Are we really about to have make-up sex?" Scorpius breathed an airy laugh as Albus pulled away to move down and take off his pants.</p><p>"Oh, hell yeah," Albus said, moving back to kiss him again, gladly letting Scorpius slip his tongue into the mix.</p><p>Scorpius wrapped his now bare legs around Albus' waist as he began to move his harsh kisses down Scorpius' jaw to his neck. Scorpius gasped and squirmed excitedly underneath Albus as he bit and licked at the sensitive skin there, definitely trying to leave marks. They lived on their own now and didn't have to go to school or work, so why not cover each other in love bites?</p>
