    <p>
  <span>I sighed. This class had been going on for far too long. When was it ever going to end? It was so boring. But at least it wasn’t as bad as previous years. Mr. Slughorn made the class much better than Mr. Snape had, as much as I hated to admit that. After all, Snape was my godfather.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I leaned my head against my fist trying not to let my eyes cross. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Just one more day after today and then I’m free,</span>
  </em>
  <span> I reminded myself. But unfortunately, Christmas break also meant that I would have to spend a lot more time with my parents.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I rubbed my eyes. I was pretty sure that Slughorn was saying something about homework, but I couldn’t be sure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I glanced up ahead of me. There he was. Perfect. Beautiful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Goddammit. I’m a Malfoy! Start acting like it! Malfoy’s aren’t gay.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I grimaced. I was pretty sure that my father would kill me if he knew about my not being straight. Or my infatuation with Potter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Potter.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I was totally in love with him. I had been ever since we first met. That was why I was so mean to him, I guess. Because I didn’t want anyone to know. Because I was so terrified of what would happen if my father found out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...and lastly, Draco and Harry,” Slughorn finished. My head jerked up from the table where it had been resting just seconds prior.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Er… what?” I asked, my chair rocking dangerously back and forth. The whole class giggled at my sudden confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then Potter, </span>
  <em>
    <span>stupid Potter,</span>
  </em>
  <span> turned and looked at me. “We’re working together, Malfoy. Didn’t you hear?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I heard perfectly clearly, Potter,” I snapped back. It was a bit of a lie, but I definitely hadn’t missed the part about working with him. Even if I had missed everything else. It didn’t matter though; I could always ask Theodor after school what the assignment was. Working with Potter though… that did matter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Anyway,” Slughorn began to continue. I knew that I should try and focus, but I just didn’t have it in me. I was just too tired. Tired of that class, tired of those people, but most of all, tired of life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I rested my head on the desk again, daydreaming commencing once more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What would it be like to kiss Potter? Perfect. Sweet. Gentle. He’d put his hand under my chin and… Stop it, Draco! You have a boyfriend!</span>
  </em>
  <span> I mentally slapped myself. </span>
  <em>
    <span>But he lives like five hundred miles away… That doesn’t matter!</span>
  </em>
  <span> I grimaced slightly. I hated having this sort of dilemma. I couldn’t even ask anyone for advice on what to do. Break up with Alex just because I had a crush on someone else? Or stay with him because it was someone I could never have? Or… never mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bell rang suddenly, and I jumped out of my seat as fast could. Finally. I got to go home.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I forcefully yanked my black and green backpack from the back of my chair and marched out of the room, exiting before anyone else was even out of their desks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I continued to walk down each hallway, angling myself towards the door. I could see light. I was going to be free after seven long hours in hell!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But of course, that couldn’t be the end, could it? I couldn’t have just a few minutes of peace in between home and school, could I?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy! Hey, Malfoy! Wait up!” I could hear Potter working his way through the crowd towards me. Edging ever closer, shoving his way through the crowd like he owned the place. And really, he practically did. The Golden Boy. The one that virtually all of the teachers loved, the pet of the principle, beloved by all. I took a deep breath, realizing that I couldn’t ignore him forever as he continued to force himself through the hallway toward me.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I halted in my path, turned around, and stuck a finger in his face. It almost went up his nose. I chose not to comment on that. “Leave me alone. I don’t want to talk to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He frowned slightly, taking a step back and shoving my hand out of his face. “Um, since when do you ever </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>want to throw snide comments my way and make me feel like shit about myself?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Always. I never wanted to hurt you. I just didn’t know how to handle my feelings and now it’s too late to stop.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Go away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. I don’t like you and you don’t like me, but you’re gonna have to deal just like me if you want to get a good mark on this assignment. It’s worth half of our grade in chemistry this trimester!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well shit. “Go away. I don’t have time after school today, so I’m not going to waste any more of the precious minutes of my life basking in the stench that is your arrogance and stupidity. Now listen closely: </span>
  <em>
    <span>scram.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” I didn’t want to have to work with him until I knew what the project was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter gave an indignant huff. “There’s the snark. But fine, I’ll leave you alone this afternoon. But not tomorrow. Got it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I rolled my eyes at him. “Sure. Now if you don’t mind me, I actually have places to be. I’m sure you probably don’t, but there are things I’ve gotta do.” It was sort of a lie. All I needed to do was go home. </span>
  <em>
    <span>And get away from those green eyes.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I made a point of turning on my heel, my black sweatshirt swirling around my waist like a skirt on a prom dress as I did so.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When I got out of the doors, I put my book bag on the ground under the roof of the building and untied my hoodie from around my middle, pulling it over my head. I thrust my hand into my bag and remove a thick grey scarf, wrapping it around my neck, draping one end over my left shoulder and allowing the other to flow down my front.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And I wonder why I get called gay,</span>
  </em>
  <span> I thought as I brushed my hair from my eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then I began my long walk home. I hated that my mother was never willing to come pick me up on days like this. But I supposed that I had it easier than some kids.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>My Doc Martins left an interesting imprint on the snowy sidewalk as I move west along the roadway. Those marks got quickly covered up as the snow began to fall faster though.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I shivered. It was so cold out there. Why didn’t I bring a warmer jacket? I shoved my fingers under my arms as I tried to keep warm. My breath was clear in the air around me, but practically nothing else was. How did the fog get so thick so fast?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regardless, I made it home before it was too late, and made myself a cup of coffee. My mother probably would have scolded me if she’d seen but, well, she didn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As I warmed up, I texted Theo, who graciously explained the assignment to me, though I was pretty sure I could hear his annoyance through the messages he sent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From what he said, it sounded like quite a lot of work. I would probably have to spend a copious amount of time over winter break working on it. Because Potter probably wouldn’t help at all.</span>
