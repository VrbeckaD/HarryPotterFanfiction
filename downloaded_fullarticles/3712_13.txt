    <p>•	 <br/>Chapter 1</p><p> </p><p>"Hogwarts, dear?" The woman, Madame Malkin said. "Got the lot here - a young man being fitted up just now, in fact." She sent Clara and Martha to the back of the shop.</p><p> </p><p>A boy stood on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robe. Clara stood quietly as she examined the first wizard child she had met. He was a tall and stunning boy. He had dark winged brows and short, jet-black hair, on the messy side. His skin was tanned, and his limbs long and thin. His eyes were a beautiful crystalline blue surrounded by thick black lashes Clara could have seen from six pews away. He had a slim nose, plush pink lips that had a hidden sensuality in it and looked as if he bit them while he thought something through. His jaw was soft and rounded.</p><p> </p><p>Madam Malkin stood Clara on the spot next to the boy. She tossed black Hogwarts robes over her head and began to pin it to the right length. </p><p> </p><p>"Hello." Clara gave the boy a nod and nervous attempt at a smile, her sweet voice rolled off her tongue smoothly and deliberately, like honey.</p><p> </p><p>No answer, the boy looked lost in his thought. "Hello." Clara tried again, a bit louder this time.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello." Bruce replied absentmindedly, his mind going over everything he had studied.</p><p> </p><p>A moment of silence went between them. "I'm Clara Kent."</p><p> </p><p>Bruce was annoyed to be interrupted but looking at the nervous yet hopeful girl, he didn't have the heart to brush her away.</p><p> </p><p>Clara was very pretty, straight and thin nose, pouty pink lips, thick dark eyebrows, lightly tanned skin and long, beautiful hair that tumbled in sin-black curls to kiss the ridge of her shoulders. Her eyes were shimmering sapphire, and very emotive. Her big eyes were framed by long dark eyelashes gave her an innocent look. She had a cute baby face, all dimpled and innocent looking. Her lightly tanned skin was unblemished and looked so soft that Bruce wanted to run his hand along her cheek. Surprise by that thought, Bruce quickly banished it.</p><p> </p><p>Clara could feel Bruce accessing her with his blue eyes. His eyes were not just blue. They were like oceans, deep and penetrating and terrifyingly beautiful. And right now they were focused completely on Clara. It was almost too much to handle like that cerulean gaze was carving her out raw. But she forced herself to hold Bruce’s stare, blushing prettily pink all the while.</p><p> </p><p>"Bruce...” his voice smooth, elegance “Wayne." The boy... Bruce seemed reluctant to give Clara his last name. Bruce bit his lip, with a look on his face like he waited for Clara to respond to it somehow.</p><p> </p><p>Clara just looked blank before uttering with a warm smile and eyes that did not ask for anything other than friendship. "Nice to meet you, Bruce."</p><p> </p><p>"Likewise." The wariness went out of Bruce's face and was replaced by a glint of humor and a kind of curiosity. No, what was he thinking? He would not befriend this kid. He had a much better use for his time.</p><p> </p><p>"Hogwarts too? First year?” Clara glanced down at the boy's robes.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes." The boy replied short and brief. There was something gloomy about him. His eyes... He couldn't be any older than Clara but his eyes held so much age, belonging to a person who had already seen too much.</p><p> </p><p>'What do I say now?' The boy might be gloomy but being in this brand new wizard world Clara was desperate for a friend his age.</p><p> </p><p>"You excited? I'm quite nervous." Clara laughed weakly.</p><p> </p><p>"No.” Another short and brief sentence. For someone who was the same age as Clara, Bruce carried himself with an air of self-confidence and assurance. “I know what to expect."</p><p> </p><p>"So, you know about Hogwarts."</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, love, I think you're done." The witch told Bruce.</p><p> </p><p> Bruce pulled the pinned robes over his head. He thanked Madam Malkin and paid her. Bruce hopped down the stool before turning back to Clara. "You're not the only one. Plenty of witches and wizards nowadays come from muggle families." That seemed to draw a sigh of relief from Clara, the girl relaxing a touch.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait, how do you know I come from a muggle family?" Clara asked, curious.</p><p> </p><p>Bruce decided not to grace that with an answer. "There's nothing to be nervous about. The first day they're just going to sort you into one of the four houses."</p><p> </p><p>"Houses... as in places the students live on campus?"</p><p> </p><p>Bruce's lips curved upward slightly, Clara almost missed it. "More like a group." he said. "I need to go now." He turned away and wandered to the front of the shop.</p><p> </p><p>"I think you're done as well, dear." Madame Malkin said. Clara smiled as she quickly trailed after Bruce.</p><p> </p><p>"Bruce, w-wait up!"</p><p> </p><p> Bruce's hesitated for a few steps before his feet stopped.</p><p> </p><p>"Where are you going now?" Clara asked him eagerly.</p><p> </p><p>"To meet Alfred at Ollivander's. I'm going to get my wand." Bruce paused, it was clear what Clara’s intention was and he wasn't interested in befriending the kid. He wanted to dedicate his years at Hogwarts to be a great Auror and wipe the street clean of dark wizards like the one that killed his parent. He had no time to spare for this girl... who was looking at him with pleading puppy eyes. Her unbelievably blue eyes glimmered, it was like looking straight into a supernova. No. He would not give in. Oh, damn it. "Oh, all right, you can come with me."</p><p> </p><p>Clara grinned mischievously. She knew Bruce was nice.</p><p> </p><p>"Clara!" Martha called. "Where do you think you're going?" she hurried after her.</p><p> </p><p>"Bruce, this is my ma," Clara stated proudly.</p><p> </p><p>Martha Kent is a beautiful late 30 woman with orange hair. She gazed at him warmly and smiled, showing her dimples.</p><p> </p><p>"Ma, this is Bruce."</p><p> </p><p>"Nice to meet you, I'm Martha Kent," Martha said with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>The name Martha reminded Bruce of his mom. "Nice to meet you, Mrs. Kent." Bruce said politely. "I need to go...."</p><p> </p><p>Clara held onto Bruce's sleeve “Can we go to the wand shop? That’s where Bruce is heading and he said I could go with him.”</p><p> </p><p>"Lovely." Bruce said, annoyed he had missed his escape. He wished the kid would find another friend soon and not cling to him. Though, he guessed Alfred would be delighted to meet his new 'friend.'</p>
