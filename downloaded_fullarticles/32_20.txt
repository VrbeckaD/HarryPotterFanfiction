The bodies belonged to people just a little while ago, and those people's hearts had belonged to many.<br/> <br/>One didn't have to sharpen and focus their hearing to hear the wails of mourning, of pain.<br/> <br/>Living bodies, not whole, but living- lay stood sat kneeled- on top of beside around the now-cold bodies of the dead.<br/> <br/>The living weren't whole.<br/> <br/>Not everyone had lost someone in the battle.<br/> <br/>Everyone had lost someone in the war.<br/> <br/>Every single living breathing walking talking crying screaming person in those halls had lost someone.<br/> <br/>Dennis Creevey lost a brother.<br/> <br/>Parvati Patil lost a best friend.<br/> <br/>Molly Weasley lost a son.<br/> <br/>Draco Malfoy lost a companion.<br/> <br/>In these very walls, in this very hall, Tom Riddle lost himself.<br/> <br/>But then again, that would mean that Tom ever had a clue of who he was- and he didn't.<br/> <br/>Tom never learnt to love.<br/> <br/>-anyone but himself<br/> <br/>Tom never learnt to lose.<br/> <br/>-anyone but himself<br/> <br/>Those fifty bodies grew colder, further away from the world they had once walked.<br/> <br/>Soon, they would rest under cold hard firm dirt.<br/> <br/>But, for now, they rested on the floor of the Great Hall, under the ceiling of constellations, in the arms of those they loved when they were alive, the arms of those who loved them back.<br/> <br/>They'd forever rest in the hearts of those who knew them.<br/> <br/>They'd rest in the memories of those who remembered.<br/> <br/>They'd rest in the pictures, the footprints, the messy notes, the diary entries.<br/> <br/>They would rest.<br/> <br/>(In peace? Maybe.)<br/> <br/>The people they left behind wouldn't be as lucky.<br/> <br/>Ginny Weasley woke up at 5 am, on the dot, every morning.<br/> <br/>Seamus Finnegan grew his hair long to hide the closed-over slashes running through his jaw.<br/> <br/>Cho Chang never took off her watch from her right wrist.</p><p>Hannah Abbott always wore her worn silver locket.<br/> <br/>Tiny little habits, the smallest fragments of what made them the people they were.<br/> <br/>They would relax, yes.<br/> <br/>But they would never rest.<br/> <br/>Never completely.<br/> <br/>As long as they lived, as long as they loved, as long as they remembered-<br/> <br/>They would never rest.</p></div>
