    <p> </p>
<p>A tiny brunette with curls bigger than her person sat on the bench outside the drafty cold office. Hands over her ears, she muffled out the sounds of yelling. After reciting the alphabet in English and French, she sighed and threw herself back on the bench. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exhausted and hungry, she got up in search of the nearest vending machine. The girl went only to realize she didn't have her money. It was in her bedroom beside her bed in the piggy bank she promised to preserve. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> 'I wonder if Mrs. Robin is here today. Maybe she has snacks!' </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tiny feet ran towards the suite next door and stopped as they ran smack into someone. A hand gripped her upper arm before she slammed backward onto the floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'm sorry!" The little girl immediately tried to back away. "I didn't mean to run into you." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A smile spread on the blood-red lips. "It's alright, accidents happen." Cold fingers ran through black ringlets and stopped themselves before they combed through the brunettes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I didn't see you." A lower lip quivered as the child tried to stop from crying. "I promise."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A laugh escaped from the older woman. Eyes sparkled with humor. "I believe you, little one."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hermione!" Footsteps padded down the long corridor, and her father came into sight. "I asked you to wait in our office."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Daddy! This is my new friend." A small fist grasped the air instead of the coat that was there moments ago. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yes, it's nice to meet your new friend. Don't tell your mother, and please listen to me next time." His voice was equally stern and dismissive as he grasped the smaller wrist leading them towards the vehicle parked in the lot.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was the first time the tiny brunette had met her friend, Bellatrix. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The two quickly became best friends, and Hermione had never been happier. She had never hated School, but it was difficult because of the constant ridicule she faced. Her parents were always busy working, and they had their problems. She had no one to confide her problems. Rather, she didn't before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>'She always cheats. I swear I checked my closet already.'</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Bella!" Small footsteps sounded closer, and the closet was ripped open.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Aha! I got you. Now it's my turn to hide." A hand gripped the back of the purple jumper and picked up the child as if she weighed nothing. A delighted squeal left the mouth of the tiny brunette. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hermione, keep it down!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Sorry, Mom!" Hermione shook with Bellatrix's laughter. A frown marred her face. The hand maneuvered her to face Bella's bright smile. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"C'mon, don't be a sore loser." Black hair was gripped in a tiny fist. Dark grey eyes narrowed. "You wouldn't dare."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Brown eyes crinkled in determination. The small fist began the motion, and storm grey eyes widened.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Okay, truce!" </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You win."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Try again."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, little one."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A satisfied smile graced the smaller girl, and she released the hair held hostage. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The girl opened her arms. The older woman obliged. "Thank you." The steps creaked as someone climbed up towards the room. Knowingly, the smaller girl asked to be put down. "You'll be here to read with me?" A small nod was the only confirmation she needed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The door was ripped open, and an upset looking older woman came into the room. "I want this mess cleaned up. I already have to clean up after your father, not you too." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I have to go to bed soon. Bella and I are going to read a story!" </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Enough, you're eight years old. It was cute when you were six, but now it isn't." The small girl flinched as if she were smacked. The older woman sighed and sat on the bed beside her. The smaller girl fidgeted because of the discomfort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I need you to try and make more friends at school." She pinched the bridge of her nose. "I can take you to see someone. A doctor for your feelings. Do you want that?" The silence was deafening as they sat beside one another. The smaller girl wanting to avoid conflict gave in to her mother.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione hung her head. "I'll try harder, I promise." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That night a small figure burrowed beneath blankets cried clutching her pillow, trying to muffle the sound.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Outside the window, a figure wept quietly. Their mind made up and their heart-clenching along with each sob that came from the blankets. </p>
