    <p align="justify">Arthur Weasley was a good man. He knew and those around him knew it. Oh, he was possessed of the same very human flaws as everybody else; a little pride, a little temper, a little selfishness, a little despair; but as a whole, he was kind, thoughtful and completely devoted to his wife and, so far, five sons. A conscientious worker, he enjoyed his job immensely and found it very interesting but that didn't stop a smile slipping across his face at five o'clock, when he shoved his things into a worn briefcase and made his away home. </p>
<p align="justify">Home, of course, was the Burrow. A wonky, mismatched structure which grew with each new addition to his large family. Slanted, crooked and a little dishevelled, it was none the less beautiful, for it was his own. Love he never knew he'd deserved sat within its walls and he knew that he wouldn't give it up for a palace. Its overstuffed rooms and creaky floorboards brought a warmth to his heart and a spring to his step as he made his way down the garden path one fine summers evening. The sun was falling behind the hill, the birds chirped around him and from the open windows came the excited clattering of family life - the bubbling voices of the children, the patient voice of his wife, the clinking of dinner plates. For a moment, Arthur could pretend that nothing was amiss, that his world was in peril, that everyday news of another death came. Not since Grindelwald had there been such a threat to his world, a terror which paralysed the entire community. This was his favourite time of day, to waltz along the path and feel as if he were an average family man, who didn't have to worry about his children being killed or fret about his grieving wife.</p>
<p align="justify">For death had touched the Weasley's. Death had come only weeks before and they, well the adults at least, were still reeling from it.</p>
<p align="justify">Inside the long, narrow kitchen, Molly was wiping the grinning faces of the twins. As Arthur entered, the three elder boys clambered about him, smiling and chattering away. He kissed the top of their red heads and leaned over them to peck his wife on the cheek. Molly sternly dispersed the children and they hurried to their seats, leaving Arthur able to place his suitcase at the bottom of the stairs. He glanced into the sitting room, habit causing him to expect to see Minerva seated in the small armchair, and shook his head at its emptiness. Minerva had left the Burrow weeks before and Arthur missed her. He knew that Molly did too. </p>
<p align="justify">Molly was quiet at dinner and barely ate a thing. She pushed her food around her plate absently, her round face pale and pursed. She smiled when one of her sons spoke to her, as she always did, but it was a sad smile, one that didn't reach her bright blue eyes. She looked tired, drained and despondent and Arthur furrowed his red brow with worry. He knew that Molly had a lot on her mind, she was grieving and fretting all at once, but she hardly said a thing to Arthur about it, no doubt because she didn't want to burden him. But he wanted to be burdened. He wanted to share the weight of her troubles. She was such a small thing, though very capable, and he was worried that she might snap. </p>
<p align="justify">When dinner was finished, Arthur bathed and put the boys to bed whilst Molly tidied up after them. Although happy enough, he knew that his sons could tell that their mother was not her usual self. Bill and Charlie knew that it was because of Eleanor and William but they were young enough to think that Molly's sadness should have gone by now. To them, a week seemed like a lifetime and it had been at least three since Molly had dressed in black and gone to the funeral. They couldn't understand that grief was often life-lasting, that it could take months, or even years, for it to settle down into something more manageable. </p>
<p align="justify">Downstairs, Arthur found Molly seated in Minerva's seat, her eyes closed. Her little hands gripped the arms and she sighed. </p>
<p align="justify">"I'm missing her too," Arthur admitted softly. "She still terrifies me, but I've grown used to her being a part of this house. There is a charm about her and she brought it with her." </p>
<p align="justify">"Yes," Molly nodded. She looked at the floor, rubbed her forehead and burst into tears. "I wish she'd stayed. I think about her, all alone, and I just hate it. She said she didn't want to frighten the boys but, she wouldn't have, Arthur! I could have helped her." </p>
<p align="justify">Perching on the arm next to her, Arthur put his arm around her. "I know, I know. We both tried to convince her to stay but you know her. Once she's made up her mind..." </p>
<p align="justify">"But she doesn't know her own mind! How can she, when Eleanor has only been dead three weeks?" </p>
<p align="justify">"What do you need me to do?" He asked, his blue eyes wide and expectant. He wanted Molly to tell him to do something, to say something that would help her. It was bad enough that Molly had lost two, beloved cousins so soon after her elder brothers, but it was made worse by the fact that she couldn't mourn her losses. Instead, she fretted about Minerva, she was always on Molly's mind and Arthur wasn't sure how much longer Molly would be able to cope with it all. Everybody had a breaking point, even his brilliant wife, and Arthur didn't want Molly to suffer the pain of reaching it. </p>
<p align="justify">She reached up for his hand and kissed it. "Nothing," she smiled gratefully. "There is nothing you can do. Minerva is a grown woman who can do as she pleases. But that doesn't mean that I can't worry about her." </p>
<p align="justify">Tears dried, Molly said nothing more about it for the rest of the evening. That night, as Arthur lay wide awake in the darkness, he couldn't stop thinking about Minerva, or Molly. His mind hadn't been so overwrought since he'd asked Molly to marry him. His stomach fluttered and his heart pounded as his mind filled with Molly. Poor Molly. He felt so helpless, so useless. Molly managed to run a home, look after five restless sons and tend after her husband and all the while, she was filled with every feeling of doubt, loss, confusion and anger that any person had ever felt. Arthur wouldn't have been able to do it. Why, he could hardly function now and he was only worrying about two people! How marvellous Molly was - he was reminded of that everyday, though he made sure to never forget it. </p>
<p align="justify">There must be a way to help her, he was sure. It wasn't hopeless. There was something that Arthur could do which would help both Molly and Minerva, if only he could think of it! If only he were a natural problem solver, much like Minerva was! She always seemed to have the answer. She didn't need time to think things through, she didn't need time to come up with a plan. Why, she would simply bark her orders and face the problem head on...</p>
<p align="justify">That was it! Arthur bolted up and swung his legs out of bed onto the cold floor. He was going to face his problem head on. Even as he made up his mind he felt a tingle of nerves in his stomach but as he frantically pulled on his socks and trousers he shook his nerves away. Molly was more important that fear. It was late he knew, but Minerva had always been late to bed and early to rise. Mind made up, Arthur dressed quickly and crept silently from the room. Thankfully Molly didn't stir and he was able to leave the house without causing any alarm.</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="justify">Minerva's cottage was most certainly not a cottage. The word conjured images of quaint thatched roofs, small gardens filed with colourful wildflowers; Minerva's home was nothing of the sort. The only resemblance it had was that it sat in the middle of a meadow, surrounded by nothing but hills and open sky. It was a great ugly building; two storey with pointed attic windows glaring down ominously. High, grey stone walls circled the house like two crooked arms ready to ensnare the next victim. It was a dark house, forlorn and threatening and Arthur had only been here once, to carry Minerva's things for her when she left the Burrow. He had been shocked by it; Molly had mentioned a forgotten cottage hidden in the hills but he hadn't been expecting such a monstrosity. It didn't suit Minerva at all, with her graceful lines and steely manner; she could be cold, she could be mean but she wasn't foreboding as her house was. Glancing up at it, the front flanked by huge silver moon, Arthur wondered once again why Minerva had this house. It wasn't a home - Hogwarts was her home - but she was too stubborn to admit it. </p>
<p align="justify">It was a panic stricken woman who pulled open the front door. Minerva's small mouth was wrangled with fright and her green eyes bulged from their sockets. Her skin was grey, her eyes surrounded by black circles and her dark hair, though piled neatly on top of her head, was greyer at the edges than it had been the last time Arthur saw her. She wore a long black robe around her thin frame, her collar bone sticking out alarmingly through the rounded collar. Her hollow cheeks made her look as if she was dancing with death and behind her, Arthur saw no lights flickering in any of the rooms. This ghostly figure sat in the cold and the dark, as away from life as she could get. </p>
<p align="justify">"Arthur! What is it? What's happened?" Minerva choked. "Don't dither, just tell me!"</p>
<p align="justify">He smiled warmly. "Nothing has happened," he said. "I came to check up on you." </p>
<p align="justify">She raised a dark brow, her face stern. "What?" She quipped. "Why should you do that in the middle of the night?"</p>
<p align="justify">"For Molly," Arthur said simply. </p>
<p align="justify">"Really, that is ridiculous," Minerva grumbled, moving to the side to let Arthur pass. "I spoke to her yesterday morning. I do not need a minder, Arthur." </p>
<p align="justify">"I know, I know. Look, I came to put Molly's mind at ease. Surely that's okay with you?" </p>
<p align="justify">Minerva shrugged elegantly and scoffed. "Very well. Now, as you can see, I am fine and was just readying for bed when you rang the bell. Good night-"</p>
<p align="justify">"If you were readying for bed then why can I see the distant glow of a fire down the hallway?"</p>
<p align="justify">"Perhaps I shouldn't have invited you in," Minerva shook her head. "You can't see the light from the front door." </p>
<p align="justify">"No, you cannot," Arthur said cheerily, making his way along the dark corridor. </p>
<p align="justify">"I didn't say to make yourself at home!" She called after him. </p>
<p align="justify">He ignored her, with more confidence than he felt. Minerva could still send shivers of fear through him; sometimes it was all too easy to forget that he was no longer and student and she, no longer his professor. In fact, she was family now, in a very odd and complicated way, but still, her bark and pursed expression was enough to make Arthur quake in her boots. He loved her because Molly did but still, he feared her. </p>
<p align="justify">Blindly, he made his way through the darkness and after passing underneath a couple of archways found the large, narrow sitting room that Minerva had been hiding in. It was old and musty, the dark purple curtains were drawn across three, large windows and the matching wallpaper was peeling in places. The wood floor was scraped and tarnished with a thick, frayed rug covering the centre of it. Old-fashioned mahogany furniture filled the room; several armchairs and a low loveseat, which was pushed in front of the fire, all matched. Portraits hung on the walls, each one covered with a thick black cloth. The small coffee table before the loveseat was littered with papers, photographs and, Arthur noticed, a half-empty bottle of muggle whiskey and a large tumbler. </p>
<p align="justify">It was a sad room. Bereft and without love. It might have been grand years ago but Arthur still thought that his own pokey, overstuffed living room was better than this. </p>
<p align="justify">"Take a seat, if you insist on staying," Minerva barked. "I'm sorry for the mess, I wasn't expecting visitors. Nor did I want any." </p>
<p align="justify">He did as instructed, biting his lip and tapping his fingers together nervously. </p>
<p align="justify">"Molly has been so worried about you," he said. "So preoccupied and-"</p>
<p align="justify">"She should be preoccupied with her boys," Minerva hissed. "I'm not worth her time. Nobody should worry about anything but their children. That is what being a mother is-" She choked on her words and her green eyes glassed over. She stared into the fire, her thin mouth trembling. </p>
<p align="justify">"Nobody expects you to hide yourself away," Arthur whispered. "You should be around those who want to help you-"</p>
<p align="justify">"No!" She cried. "This is what I have to do. This, what you see now, is a good image of me. You look at me as if I might break, as if you are shocked by how deathly ill I look but let me tell you, this is good. When I really do fall apart, which I do, it's frightening. Truly terrifying. You are a father, Arthur, you know what it is to want to protect your children. I am protecting your wife and sons from myself." </p>
<p align="justify">"Molly doesn't see it like that." </p>
<p align="justify">"She would if I sent one of her boys into a fit of wailing terror. It isn't safe to be around me-"</p>
<p align="justify">"What do you mean?" </p>
<p align="justify">"Nothing," she shock her head. "Nothing." </p>
<p align="justify">"Would you consider coming back to the Burrow with me?"</p>
<p align="justify">"No."</p>
<p align="justify">"Minerva, be reasonable. You can't like it here? It's so dark and miserable. It cannot be helping you-"</p>
<p align="justify">"Eleanor was born here," Minerva whispered. She sank into the seat next to him. </p>
<p align="justify">"Oh," Arthur said softly. "I didn't know that. I assumed that she was born in-"</p>
<p align="justify">"Hogwarts? No. She might have been, if not for Albus and I. She was born here, in the guest bedroom upstairs. I don't like it here anymore than you do - it was my mother's and her mother's before that. I inherited it when she died. I hardly came here but when Albus and I separated the first time, I had nowhere to go but here. That's why Eleanor was born here. And that is why I'm here. My life was born in this house. She breathed her first beneath this roof."</p>
<p align="justify">"Isn't it torturing yourself?" He asked tentatively. "To bury yourself up here with nothing but your memories?" </p>
<p align="justify">"You think that I should forget her?" Minerva snapped. "You think that because she is buried now I should move on? Go back to my normal self and forget that I ever had a daughter? Forget that I didn't protect her?" </p>
<p align="justify">"No, of course not, that isn't what I meant-"</p>
<p align="justify">"Why can't you all just leave me alone?"</p>
<p align="justify">"Because we care-"</p>
<p align="justify">"No! I don't want to hear it," Minerva shrieked. "Tell Molly I am fine. Tell her to worry about her children instead, for who knows what time they have left-"</p>
<p align="justify">"Now, see here," Arthur stood, his face creased in rage. "My sons are safe. There is no need to insinuate that they might die, I don't want hear-"</p>
<p align="justify">She jumped to her feet. Her eyes were blazing and her face only inches from his as she said: "If you don't want to hear the truth then get out! I didn't ask you here! If you and Molly cannot face up to the truth that everybody dies, that our children will all die before this over-"</p>
<p align="justify">"Minerva! Stop!" </p>
<p align="justify">"You're a fool, Arthur Weasley. I couldn't protect Eleanor, hell, Albus couldn't and he's the greatest one of us all! What chance do you and Molly have? Riddle will come for them, he'll torture those little boys until they cry for death! You can't do anything about it. The world is run by bastards and all we can do is sit here and let them. You'll bury your children, just as I have buried mine-"</p>
<p align="justify">He didn't know if it was fear that drove him to shove her to the ground but he grabbed a hold of her thin shoulders and shoved her harshly. She bounced against the wall and tumbled to the ground. He gave her one scornful glance before he stepped over her and stormed from the house. </p>
<p align="justify">Arthur Weasley was a good man. </p>
<p align="justify">Usually. </p>
