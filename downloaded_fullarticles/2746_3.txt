    <p>Time spent as Percival Graves proved to be very interesting to Gellert Grindelwald. It gave him a chance to see into the minds of some of the most powerful witches and wizards in America, it gave him a chance to know just how to interact with these politicians, and how to play into their every whim. It also gave him a chance to meet Newton Scamander. This was perhaps the most important moment of all of Grindelwald's time in the American Ministry.</p><p>“You're an interesting man, Mister Scamander.”</p><p>These were Grindelwald's first words uttered when the lanky, freckled young man was pushed into the chair on the other side of Grave’s large desk. With one wave of Grindelwald's hand, the security officers closed the door, leaving Newt and Grindelwald alone.</p><p>“It seems,” Grindelwald went on, looking up from the file and making a point to meet Newt’s eyes. “That this isn't the first time you've almost exposed our world with your beasts… Look at me Mister Scamander, I don't trust a man with a shifting gaze.”</p><p>When Newt’s eyes continued to roam nervously, Grindelwald flicked his fingers, effectively immobilizing Newt’s chin so that their eyes could meet. Newt’s eyes remained dangerously seeking and searching as they always had, the seriousness of the situation not touching him since he knew he was innocent.</p><p>“Tell me, what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you?” Grindelwald leaned his elbows on the table, making sure he didn’t miss any look or shift in Newt's eyes. Newt simply gazed down since his face couldn’t move.</p><p>He swallowed hard, “I really couldn’t say. What’s he to you, anyways? This has nothing to do with him, if that’s what you’re insinuating,” Newt looked “Graves” dead in the eye, unafraid to defend his close friend and teacher if need be.</p><p>This man before him was nothing like the man Theseus had told stories of or described in any way, perhaps Newt even thought it sad they had to meet this way. Percival was the man he had heard of at Christmas dinners. Percivsl had been described as caring and charming in work places and had always had his brother’s back, but perhaps Graves is a different person. In office and in uniform, maybe Percival goes away and leaves behind only the fierce Auror his brother admired so much. Newt knew his brother though, and had a hard time believing that Theseus could idolize someone who acted so coldly to someone not yet proved guilty.</p><p>“This could have everything to do with him, Mister Scamander,” Grindelwald murmured, his voice satiny, smooth, and yet cold as ice. “You don't seem particularly sorry about your creatures terrorizing the nomaj community, muggles as you call them. You didn't seem particularly sorry in the past either. And yet Albus Dumbledore argued on your behalf, on your creatures’ behalf. One could almost assume he agreed with your choices. I suppose we shouldn't be all that surprised though, hm, knowing his background, knowing his involvement with the infamous Gellert Grindelwald. Perhaps there's more to these… Rampages of your beasts in the muggle world than meets the eye?”</p><p>“None of my creatures pose threats to anyone. They listen to me, th-they aren’t dangerous! Anyone hurt in the past has been during a capture, or if the creature itself was being threatened. Please, Mr. Graves, you have to believe me. They wouldn’t hurt anyone, they can’t.” Newt tried to defend them desperately, looking down at the case near Grindelwald's ankle.</p><p>"As for Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald, their history is their business. Dumbledore is many things, but he is first and foremost kind; he’d never put a soul in danger if he didn’t deem it absolutely necessary.” The man across from Newt was testy. He was bitter and unpleasant, nothing desirable except for those eyes. So cruel and piercing, but ever so interested in everything Newt would do or say; not unlike many of his beasts.</p><p>Yes, that was it. Percival looked at him like a predator surrounding prey, the type that likes to play with it’s food first, or perhaps save it for later. The fact that they were alone in this room made Newt’s skin almost crawl. It was an off putting thing to be strapped down, held in place, and have no one else there to cut the intensity of the room. There was no reason, to Newt anyways, for a questioning under these circumstances to be this intense.</p><p>“Is that so?” Grindelwald murmured, tilting his head just slightly to the side, studying Newt closely once again. “You seem very eager to defend this professor in return. You two must have been very close. Unusual, for a student and a teacher. You also seem very eager to avoid my questions. Now, tell me, Mister Scamander, why haven’t you fixed your suitcase if you want to stop your beasts from escaping. I noticed that broken clasp. You aren’t the first one I’ve had in here that has believed in, oh what do they say, a few casualties to foster the greater good…”</p><p>“It isn’t exactly easy to fix a magical item, especially one built for concealment. I’ve just been travelling so much I suppose I put it on the backburner, that’s all. And don’t you go feeding those words into my mouth, I am not one of Grindelwald's fanatics. And nor is Dumbledore. Mr. Graves if you will go with me, I can take you into my case myself to prove to you I don’t harbour any creatures in there that are out for blood.” Newt could play his game too, deciding to keep his eyes locked on the slightly manic one’s of Graves.</p><p>His eyes didn’t match the rest of him; they had a fire. Everything else about the auror, or at least what Newt believed to be the auror, was nearly robotic. His straight back, perfectly combed hair, like someone trying too hard to be perfect, “I know you’re a fair, reasonable man. I trust my brother’s judge in character. Please you have to believe me about Dumbledore. And the Obscurial. You know as well as I do that none coming from outside of a host can do any sort of damage, especially to a muggle.”</p><p>“I have been inside your case, Mister Scamander, I took that liberty and found more than one creature that is illegal to possess in New York City. However, as you said, I am a very fair man. I do not punish people who are straightforward, nor do I harm those who have committed no crime. Unfortunately, despite your best efforts, you have committed several crimes. I know what your justice system is like in England. I won’t send you to Azkaban, Mister Scamander. Our system is far cleaner, far more efficient. I could simply have you killed. But I’m not going to do that. Instead, I’m going to ask you again. Why was Albus Dumbledore so eager to defend you? And why are you so eager in return? What does this man mean to you?”</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, a wisp of smoke appeared, Dumbledore’s face appearing in the middle. Grindelwald watched closely for Newt’s reaction, picking up each and every movement the man made.</p><p>Newt gaped for a fish out of water for a moment then simply closed his mouth. This wasn’t democracy, and this certainly wasn’t justice. This was blackmail, and if Newt truly wanted to prove his innocence and integrity, he wouldn’t fall through the fingers of some dirty Auror. Dumbledore’s face in this man’s image was lighter than it had any right to be, it made his former teacher out as something to be admired artificially, not for the brilliant mind and kind heart he possessed. Before Newt had the opportunity to change his mind about speaking, Grindelwald had whipped the image away as quickly as he summoned it, obviously quickly losing patience with the magizoologist.</p><p>As far as Grindelwald was concerned, it was clear from the look on Scamander’s face that for some bizarre reason the two men had been close to each other. It seemed Newt might even admire Albus. The thought of any sort of adoration being returned for this lanky boy made Grindelwald grind his teeth, and he pressed a button on his desk, summoning the two guards who hurried back into the room.</p><p>“Bring him to back to his cell with his comrades,” Grindelwald told the guards. “I won't be needing him again today, but do keep him safe. Our time isn't over yet.”</p><p>Killing Newt Scamander would be a waste of a wizard’s life, Grindelwald told himself, and besides, this handsome young man was of much more use alive than dead. Grindelwald stood by his earlier statement. Newt Scamander was a very interesting man. Of particular interest was his clearly close relationship with Albus Dumbledore. Yes, Newton Scamander could prove to be most useful indeed, whether that was now, or sometime in the future to come.</p>
