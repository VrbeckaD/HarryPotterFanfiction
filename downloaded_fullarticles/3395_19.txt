She shook her head. "No, not yet." She let out a deep breath. "Do you miss him?" Her gaze was drawn to Ted Tonks' name on the monument.</p><p>Andromeda tightened her grip on Hermione's shoulder, trying to offer her some comfort. She stepped closer, pressing a kiss to Hermione's temple.

All the names listed at the bottom made her heartache in an unexplainable way.</p><p>"Hermione?"</p><p>She turned and saw Andromeda looking over her shoulder at her.</p><p>"Coming, Andy," Hermione murmured. They were all healing, and someday, they would all be okay.</p></div>
