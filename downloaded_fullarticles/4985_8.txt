    <p>Hiroko Konishi was your run-of-the-mill muggle born witch; she graduated Mahoutokoro with respectable orange robes and moved on to work. But then she met Toshiya Katsuki. He was a squib but, more importantly, he was kind and sweet and Hiroko fell in love. Together they left the magical world behind and settled in the quiet town of Hasetsu. Years later they had a daughter and named her Mari- the next year they gave Mari a brother named Yuuri. They were content and never thought to look back to the magic or the world they left behind.</p><p>For a while anyhow.</p><p> </p><p>First was Mari who, at age four, transformed her leotard a bright red because pink was boring and the Hiroko dug up her wand from a long-forgotten storage box and prepared to be brought back to magic once more. And then there was Yuuri, when Yuuri was five years old, he transformed the family onsen into an ice rink because the ice castle was closed that day. It took the bureau of accidental magic nearly a whole day to melt the ice and several guests had to be obliviated by means of damage control. The next year, came an invitation for Mari to go to Mahoutokoro and Yuuri followed a year later, the pair flying back and forth between worlds on storm petrels with pink robes and bright smiles.  Just like that, the Katsukis found their way back to the world of magic, partially at least.</p><p> </p><p>Things continued like that for a while until three years later Hiroko and Toshiya Katsuki made the decision to move to England before business took them into debt and they resettled in a small suburb in the north and their children withdrew from Mahoutokoro to attend regular muggle school once more. Mari took to the new surroundings like a fish to water, for her, everything was exciting and new; a breath of fresh air away from stuffy old Hasetsu. Yuuri, on the other hand hated it. He missed the smell of the sea breeze, the comforting chill of the ice castle. More importantly, he missed magic; he missed learning to do the impossible, missed the feeling freedom as he flew on the backs of storm petrels. So he found himself feeling jealous when Mari received her letter from Hogwarts, and counted down the days until he could go, too. When the day finally came and an owl flew into their family home with a letter from Hogwarts Yuuri was delighted, and all but dragged his parents to diagon alley to buy supplies. When he finally got to put on his Hogwarts robes and make his way to platform 9¾ with his family by his side, he felt himself again; his robes might look strange and dull in comparison to his old uniform, but it was magic and that was enough.</p><p> </p><p>The train ride to Hogwarts went by in a blur of excitement and unknown faces and soon Yuuri found himself sitting in front of all the students with the sorting hat on his head. When Mari’s first letter had come back from Hogwarts, Yuuri found it strange that the only colours that separated the students were those of houses rather than magical competency. There was no brilliant gold to aim for, no end goal and he was vaguely disappointed to be honest.</p><p>
  <em>Hmmm… What an interesting way of thinking</em>
</p><p>Yuuri jumped at the voice invading his head- he wasn’t expecting it to read his thoughts! <em>Well I don’t see how you could be so proud of something you didn’t earn… </em>he reasoned softly, his thoughts trailing off as he lost his confidence. Yuuri swore he could hear a chuckle as the hat mumbled.</p><p><em>Well, definitely not Hufflepuff… with a heart like that you must be </em>“SLYTHERIN!”  <em> </em></p><p>A smattering of reserved applause rang around the hall as Yuuri’s uniform took on the distinctive green and silver of his new house. He made his way timidly towards the Slytherin table tripping over the step as he walked down. He was nervous and anxious and wanted to get there and be done with everything as soon as possible when he heard them: a low hum of disapproving whispers came from certain members of the house. <em>How could someone like </em>him<em> be a Slytherin? He’s Mari’s brother, isn’t he? The one who’s practically a mudblood? </em> Yuuri shrank deeper and deeper into himself, doubts filling his head until: <em>I bet he’ll break his wand in a month- weak magic does that </em>Yuuri stopped. You see, there are few things Yuuri was proud of but his wand, which was highly praised in Mahoutokoro, was what let introduced him to magic and he wasn’t willing to let that insult slide. Straightening his back with all the poise of a ballet dancer, he fixed his eyes on the boy with an ice-cold stare and smirked.</p><p>“Are you speaking from experience? You seem to know an awful lot about it.” he said, voice stronger than he felt, and strode to the end of the table with the other first years not once looking back. No more comments came after that and the table sat in silent reverence of the tiny first year with the hand-me-down robes too big for his small frame.</p><p> </p><p> Yuuri kept up his mask through the entire meal and all the way through to the Slytherin common room. He kept it up until everyone was gone to unpack and he was sure he was alone. Then he collapsed into one of the soft velvet sofas that decorated the common room, fat tears rolling down his face as his body shook.  He regretted doing that, regretted coming here and thinking things would get better. How was he going to make friends now? If his housemates didn’t hate him before, they surely did now that he made a fool of himself in front of everyone. But he couldn’t give up now; he wanted to return to the world of magic and he was back. If he wasn’t wanted here he’d carve out a place of his own and he couldn’t do that by crying. He viciously wiped off the tears from his eyes and muttered a familiar spell under his breath. Fixing his eyes on the doorway to his room, he walked; he wanted this and he was prepared to face a little bit of loneliness in exchange.</p><p> </p><p>What he wasn’t prepared for was for a Thai boy to jump at him the moment he opened the door, grasping his hands with a smile on his face.</p><p>“So, it <em>is you</em> who’ll be my roommate!” said the boy. Yuuri felt his heart sinking preparing for disappointment until “Oh right! My name’s Phichit and we’re gonna be roommates from now on. You know, you were so cool at the great hall today that I was really hoping we’d be friends. Now we’re roommates too!”</p><p>“A-ah. My name is Yuuri… Nice to meet you” Yuuri said awkwardly. He stood at the doorway unsure what to do next.</p><p>“Oh right! You probably want to come in, don’t you? Your trunk in on that bed over there, do you want some help unpacking?”</p><p>Yuuri came inside, taking in the warmth of the room and the cool green draperies. He looked at his trunk thinking of the multiple expansion charms his mother had put on it and looked at Phichit. “I-if you don’t mind I’d love to have some help” he murmured. With a smile and a flurry of movement Phichit was by his side already opening up the trunk and taking things out and Yuuri did the same. After a while, he glanced over to Phichit to find him holding his ice skates with a gleam in his eyes and thus began a long enthusiastic conversation about skating which evolved into other subjects. Soon Yuuri found himself relaxing in the company of the other boy. <em>Maybe,</em> he thought, <em>this won’t be so bad after all.</em></p><p> </p><p>A little way away a group of Slytherins were gathered in the common room preparing a five-step plan. You see, Yuuri had been so absorbed in his thoughts before that he hadn’t noticed the trickle of older Slytherins sneaking in to the common room. Hadn’t noticed as they watched him stop shaking all of a sudden, remove the red on his face with a wave of a wand and walk away with a straight back and determined eyes. He didn’t realise that that was the moment they all collectively decided to protect this small Japanese boy with a glass heart and steel skin. With a game face so strong they knew that Yuuri Katsuki will grow to become the pride of Slytherin (as long as he kept his nerves in check)</p><p> </p><p>And so, Yuuri’s first year went a little like this: while Mari had taken her years ahead in magical training as an excuse to slack off, Yuuri used his as a means of learning what he could. He jumped head first into the lessons that weren’t available at Mahoutokoro and ended up taking advanced classes in charms and transfiguration to better match his ability. He was very honestly intimidated by the older students in those classes- the Gryffindors seemed to look at him as yet another Slytherin and gave him no sympathy for his age. Surprisingly though, his Slytherin classmates took to hiding him in their cloaks and glaring down anyone who tried to look his way. They became like secondary Maris to him, taking them into their wings and hugging him when it gets too much. With their support, Yuuri kept himself above the harsh workload of the older students and found himself enjoying the tougher spellwork. </p><p> </p><p>One day, Phichit all but dragged Yuuri to a random corridor he had never noticed before right into a full-sized skating rink.</p><p>“How did you find this place” Yuuri asked in awe.</p><p>“I don’t have a clue!” Phichit replied with a grin “I was just really wanting to skate and then- boom! I walked right into this place. Isn’t it cool?”</p><p>“It’s awesome, Phichit. But we don’t have any-” and just like that a pair of skates appeared in his hands.</p><p>“Woah! How did you do that?”</p><p>“I… didn’t do anything? I just thought that we’d need skates to skate…”</p><p>“Oh, so does that mean…?” at that moment, a pair of skates and a hamster plush appeared in Phichit’s hands. His face lit up “It does! Hey, Yuuri, I think this room conjures up whatever you want at the moment- how awesome is that?”</p><p>Yuuri replied with a smile of his own- it was pretty cool but he was much more excited to skate to care all too much. Lacing up his skates, he ran into the centre of the rink and shouted behind him “I bet I can spin more times than you!”</p><p> “No way!”</p><p> </p><p>Yuuri did actually end up spinning more times than Phichit, but Phichit ended up beating him in the height of his jump. And, with any free time they got, they skated to their hearts content at the newly dubbed skating room. When winter came around, Phichit convinced Yuuri to come skate on the newly frozen lake with him as a change of scenery; Yuuri agreed, but not before casting three different freezing charms on the lake for good measure. It was nice, getting to skate in the open air and, as the holidays had already come around, there were very few people around to see them when they.  They’d just finished a few laps of the lake when an idea struck Yuuri. He came to a stop at the centre of the lake and took out his wand waving at Phichit to stop.</p><p>“I’ve got an idea” he said with a grin “could you stand back a little?”</p><p>When Phichit was at a safe enough distance away Yuuri started to skate, making shapes with his wand while mumbling spells under his breath. Waves of snow floated from his wand as he spun, surrounding him in a mini flurry. He then sped up with the help of an acceleration charm and bent down into a sit spin. He muttered another spell under his breath and the snow burst outwards, briefly forming a flower-like shape as the impromptu routine climbed to its climax… and then dropped suddenly as Yuuri tripped out of the spin landing flat on his arse.</p><p>“Ow…” He stayed there for a moment, waiting for the dizziness to stop.</p><p>“That was sooo cool!” came the excited voice of Phichit, skating quickly to Yuuri’s side “How did you keep the spin going so long?” Phichit stuck a hand out “Is your bum okay?”</p><p>Taking the offered hand, Yuuri got up shakily on his feet, shaking the snow off his coat “I used an acceleration charm but I think I overdid it.”</p><p>“It was still really cool though. It was like watching those ribbon dancers but better!”</p><p>Yuuri blushed “t-thanks… I think I could do better though- maybe if I used light instead of snow…”</p><p>“Well let’s try again” said Phichit skating further outwards into the lake, taking out his own wand. He started building up momentum for a jump before shouting “Ascendio!” and jumped so high he had room to strike a pose before landing soundly on the ice. He turned towards Yuuri “Did you see that?  I bet you could do so much cool stuff if you add magic to figure skating!”</p><p>Ad they did just that- with the help of Yuuri’s knowledge of charms (and an excessive number of nights at the library) they started to create tricks to do on the ice. Even with the restricted number of spells in their arsenal, with a lot of creativity, their ‘routines’ became more and more solid until they were able to minimise falling on their arses to 40%. One day, they had been trying to conjure fires in their spins without melting the ice when Professor Minako, headmistress of Hogwarts, appeared out of nowhere to watch them.</p><p>“So this is what you’ve been doing on the lake all this time.” the two first years jolted to a stop “Don’t worry, you aren’t in trouble. I always encourage experimentation outside of classes. Would you mind explaining what exactly you’ve been doing?”</p><p>“Oh!” Phichit piped up “Well we were trying to combine figure skating and magic”</p><p>“Could you show me what you’ve been working on?”</p><p>“Yuuri’ll do it! He’s amazing!” Yuuri made to protest when Phichit nudged him, pushing him forward “Show her that ice spin thing- it’s your coolest move”</p><p>Professor Minako raised an eyebrow at the name and Yuuri blushed “Errm… It’s not much but…”</p><p>He trailed off but skated back to the centre of the lake nevertheless and started skating large slow circles on the ice. He stuck his arms out conjuring a ribbon of ice from his wand and began building up a small icy dome around himself before prepping for a spin. This time he had the foresight to cast a charm to prevent dizziness before bursting into a faster more controlled spin. He’d been practicing this move many time since his first attempt so, this time, the resulting flower was far more defined and grew increasingly intricate as he kept spinning. Then everything shattered into glittering shards of ice that floated slowly to the ground as Yuuri slowed to a stop. He still felt dizzy though and almost tripped over himself as he made his way towards where Professor Minako was standing.</p><p> </p><p>Phichit skated to him shortly after with words of praise ready on his lips. Instead he turned to Professor Minako looking like a child ready to show off a new toy “See? I told you he’s amazing!”</p><p>Professor Minako looked at the two first years with an assessing gaze before smiling “It was very artistic indeed but that footwork was sloppy! You looked like you were trying to dig yourself into the ice rather than sliding above it.” Yuuri found himself sinking deeper into himself “It’d be a waste of such potential to let you keep doing this by yourself. You could both be such amazing figure skaters with the right training.” Professor Minako paused for a moment narrowing her eyes “I guess I’ll just have to train you both myself.”</p><p>Yuuri blinked in confusion “I’m sorry? I thought figure skating was a muggle sport?”</p><p>“You didn’t think this kind of thing didn’t exist in the wizarding world, did you?”</p><p>“N-no?</p><p> </p><p>So, they came to learn that there was the magical equivalent of figure skating with exactly the same name. Apparently, figure skating had taken the magical world by storm when a muggle studies expert had taken an avid interest in the sport. Little by little it had become a display of magical prowess in addition to physical skill. Apparently, Professor Minako had been a figure skating champion before retiring to teach at, and later become headmistress of, Hogwarts. And, it seems, she was determined to make the two of them into figure skaters in their own rights and make Hogwarts students care about more than just Quidditch and grades. (She’d also mumbled something about knocking Beauxbatons from their high horse but Yuuri wasn’t sure he understood what she meant.) And so Yuuri and Phichit began training under Minako during their free time. Training with Minako was tough, and both Phichit and Yuuri often walked to their room with piles of books on charms to learn by the next session, but the challenge was exhilarating and they both found themselves looking forward to the next practice again and again. They also snuck into the ‘skating room’ (which Minako had informed them was called the ‘Room of Requirement’) to practice well into the night and always ended the day exhausted but with huge grins on their faces. And in the blink of an eye first year ended and Yuuri returned home with a request for new skates and a burning desire to go back.</p><p> </p><p>Second year, Phichit greeted him on the Hogwarts express with a hamster on his head, and so many stories to tell.  They threw themselves into practice with Minako as per usual and Phichit was moved up to Yuuri’s charms class since Minako’s training had long since pushed his level far above that of a second year. One day, Yuuri, in a stroke of inspiration, permanently transfigured his family owl into an owl sized poodle that could miraculously function as well as any ordinary owl except, he could play fetch now, too. And, with much effort had convinced both his parents and the Minako to allow him to keep it as a pet/owl for the duration of his time at Hogwarts. At some point Phichit acquired *asked Yuuri to transfigure* two more hamsters and their room became something closer to a pet shop than a place of rest and study.</p><p> </p><p>Third year was the year that Yuuri discovered Victor Nikiforov, Beauxbatons’ champion and the junior figure skating champion. Minako had taken them to watch junior figure skating exhibition for inspiration and seeing Victor on the ice did much more than that. Yuuri was so drawn in by the seekers fluid movements <strike>and pretty face</strike> that he forgot to even watch the other performers. He was so entranced, in fact, that he got all the merch available for the Russian seeker and watched every available recording of his routines. Phichit was more than willing to help transform their shared room into something akin to a shrine dedicated to Victor Nikiforov. It was Yuuri’s idea to convince Minako to allow them to try out for junior competitions in the hope of being able to skate on the same ice as Victor. They spent much of that year sneaking out to practice with Phichit instead of studying for their early O.W.L.s. </p><p> </p><p>Summer that year, Yuuri received two letters from Hogwarts. He ignored the one informing him of his outstanding O.W.L.s in favour for the one inviting him to participate in his first junior competition. And so, he spent the entire summer with training with Minako and choreographing his first full routine. He practiced long and hard in preparation for his first qualifier and scratched his way into the semi-finals where he would finally be able to skate on the same ice as Victor. He was filled with equal amounts of nerves and excitement and he loved every moment of the competition, of the knowledge that he’d made it on the same level as Victor that he didn’t even mind that he placed fourth. But the time the medal ceremony was over, Yuuri had already replaced his costume with a comfy robe and replaced the glasses on his face and Minako pushed him over to congratulate his fellow competitors. By the time he moved on to congratulating the flirty silver medallist, a small crowd had already gathered around the competitors. Yuuri spotted a flash of silver hair and instinctively moved to that direction. <em>This was it,</em> he thought,<em> he was finally going to meet the Victor Nikiforov as a fellow competitor no less</em>. He was filled with determination as he moved through the crowd, waving in his direction with congratulations on his tongue. “Victor!”</p><p>The Russian turned around with a smile. “Ah, you wanted an autograph, right?” Victor said, taking out a quill “Sure thing!”</p><p>Yuuri’s face fell immediately, hand falling and retreated silently back into the castle, ignoring the looks his schoolmates gave him as he walked through the crowds until he was in his room. Only then did he crumble to the ground and let the tears fall. Victor hadn’t noticed him, hadn’t even realised he’d been skating on the same ice as him. Had thought he was just another fan even after he’d worked so hard to even be on the same playing field as the Russian.</p><p> </p><p>Yuuri had already curled himself up into an anxious ball under the covers by the time Phichit found him and wrapped an arm around his friend.</p><p>“Yuuri! What’s wrong? I know know you didn’t medal but it was your first time and you managed to get to the semi-finals and skate on the same ice as Victor-” At the mention of Victors name Yuuri sniffled loudly. Phichit’s eyes hardened “Did Victor do something? ‘Cause if he did, I swear. I don’t care if he’s a national treasure, I’ll hex him so hard he won’t even remember his mums face!”</p><p>Yuuri sniffled louder. “He didn’t even know I was a fellow skater. He thought I was just another fan…”</p><p>“He clearly can’t see talent even if it hit him round the face with a bludger!”</p><p>“But-”</p><p>“No but’s, Yuuri, you’re amazing and everybody knows it!”</p><p>“But we still lost”</p><p>“It was your first time skating on such a level. Of course, it was going to be hard- but you still managed to get to the semis. We’ll just have to get better. We’re only in our fourth year, we’ve got plenty of time to beat him” Phichit replied with a reassuring smile.</p><p>Yuuri pondered the thought for a moment before mumbling quietly “I’m going to do it.”</p><p>Phichit’s smile turned into a grin “Tell me, Yuuri, what are you going to do?”</p><p>You see, there’s a reason Yuuri was sorted into Slytherin and Phichit knew it. There was a certain viciousness in him, buried under all that anxiety; all it took was for his best friend to dig it back out of him. If Victor couldn’t recognise him as an equal the he’d simply become better. In fact, he’d beat Victor at everything. <em>So what if Victor could already do wandless magic?</em> thought Yuuri as he rubs the tears from his face<em> So what if he could transfigure a baby dragon?</em> Yuuri would do better.</p><p>“I’m going to train my ass off and I’m going to knock Victor Nikiforov off his pedestal.”</p><p> </p><p>And so, Yuuri spent his fifth year completely absorbed in achieving that goal, he spent many days and nights at the library studying and rose from simply being good to being excellent. When he wasn’t studying, he was skating with Phichit and, together, they broke through their own personal bests at the qualifying competitions. Funnily enough, a Yuuri powered by spite was a lot more productive than before and he ended the year with a full set of outstanding O.W.L.s (history of magic didn’t count), two outstanding N.E.W.T.s and a second at the juniors (he’d do better later). He also became something of a Hogwarts legend and his name was known throughout the entire school. Yuuri never understood the latter and suspected that he had Phichit to thank for his new-found fame but his friend just shrugged it off with a grin. With this new-found fame, many students came to ask to join in learning to skate including a small first year by the name of Minami. Minami practically worshipped the ground that Yuuri stood on but he was a good skater and surprisingly talented at spell work in spite of being muggle born. Overall, things were looking up for Yuuri, he hadn’t beaten Victor yet but he’d made progress and that was enough. And Yuuri went onto his Sixth year with the intent of finally winning the Juniors.</p><p> </p><p>Except it didn’t quite work out like that. You see, one day, Minako stood up in front of the great hall with the announcement that Quidditch was cancelled for the year. Normally this wouldn’t have meant too much to Yuuri but then Minako spoke up once more. “Quidditch shall instead be replaced by another special occasion, we shall be playing host to the Triwizard tournament. One champion from each school, Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang shall be selected to represent the school in a series of tasks.” A rumble of interest came across the hall “Now without much further ado, let us welcome the incoming students. First is Professor Yakov and the students of Durmstrang!”</p><p>The students of Durmstrang marched in like trained soldiers all following the steady pace of their headmaster. Not a single student fell from formation as they made their way to the centre of the hall and Yuuri was in awe on the instinctive discipline they held. They looked attentively towards Professor Yakov as they came to a stop standing still as statues.</p><p>“Next is Madame Baranovskaya and the students from Beauxbatons!”</p><p>Yuuri’s interest piqued at the mention of Beauxbatons and looked up, straightening his back to see. A troop of students stepped gracefully into the hall in a flurry of golden birds and silk. Even amongst all the fanfare, Victor stood out against it all. Standing directly beside Madame Baranovskaya, he looked more like the leader than a fellow student.</p><p>“Yuuri!” Yuuri’s attention snapped at the sound of Phichit at his side “You’re gaping”</p><p>With a blush Yuuri snapped his mouth closed and returned his attention back to Professor Minako adamantly ignoring the giggling to his side.</p><p>“Now I’ll explain the specifics of how the Champions are chosen. All students from sixth year and above can enter to be chosen as a champion- they will have to place their names into the goblet of fire who will choose a champion from each school. Remember, you can only enter your <em>own</em> name and the goblet will reject any false names and those who are not of age.” Minako explained sternly, then, with a smile she raised her wand “Now, enough of that serious stuff, the incoming students may choose to sit on whichever table they wish and rooms will be allocated later. Let the feast begin”</p><p> </p><p>And with that the foreign students made their way to whichever table they fancied, as the tables began to fill up with food. Yuuri decided to ignore the incoming students, instead, opting to fill his plate with food. He leaning over slightly to reach a slice of pie when he felt a hand slap his bum.</p><p>“I knew I recognised that butt from somewhere”</p><p>“C-Chris!” Yuuri jumped at the familiar voice “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“I’m here with the rest of the Beauxbatons students” he said as though it were obvious “But you! Yuuri, dear, you never mentioned that you went to Hogwarts, I’d have joined the quidditch troop to come visit you if I’d known”</p><p>“Chris!” Phichit interrupted “I didn’t know you went to Beauxbatons! Are you gonna be staying with us here?”</p><p>Chris nodded “There’s no one else I’d rather spend my time here with. It’s a shame Victor jumped right into that red house, though, we could’ve been the skating table”</p><p>“We don’t need Victor to make a skating table- there’s plenty of talent right here!”</p><p>Chris chuckled, taking a seat on the other side of Yuuri “You might have a point there-at least one of us is going to beat him one day”</p><p>Phichit shared a look with Yuuri with a grin “You betcha”</p><p>“You’re going to have to wait another year for that though. Victor’s planning on participating in the tournament instead this year”</p><p>Yuuri stopped eating “He’s what?!”</p><p>“He said he’s taking a break from skating for the tournament.” Chris repeated “saying something about not being inspired or something.”  He grinned “At least the ranking would be more interesting this year. But enough of that talk- I’m starving and this food looks divine!”</p><p>And with that Chris started piling food up onto his own plate to eat. Yuuri picked up he fork once more and started eating again but he was working his mind around this newfound information. Victor was taking a break… from skating? How was he supposed to beat him if he was taking a break from it all? A for what? The Triwizard Tournament?  Yuuri sighed resigning to his next course of action and steeling himself.</p><p>Phichit noticed “Yuuri, you’ve got that look on your face that says you’re going to do something extreme.”</p><p>Yuuri nodded, taking a deep breath “I’m going to put my name in the goblet.”</p>
