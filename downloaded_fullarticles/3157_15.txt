    <p>Magic</p><p><br/> Perhaps it was magic Harry thought, a magic he hadn’t known of, despite the many trials he had faced. Magic, that made his eyes widen and his mouth fall open. Magic that felt like receiving a static shock; surprising and unexpected. Unexpected definitely described Malfoy approaching him after his trial, head bowed as he said thank you without a trace of mockery or arrogance.</p><p><br/> It felt like magic Harry thought, magic that burned like fire, coursing though his veins and pounded in his ears, as he pushed aside the younger Gryffindors, glaring at them before reaching his hand out to Malfoy. Malfoy; who was prone on the ground, looking small, scared and bruised. Harry pulled him to his feet before throwing an arm protectively over the blondes shoulder and leading him down the corridor.</p><p><br/> It must be magic Harry decided, a warm magic that filled him whenever Draco was near, magic that made him smile and laugh and forget their dark past. Draco must feel the magic too because he was smiling, a small smile at first, a tiny curl upwards at the corners of his mouth that slowly became a Cheshire grin, spanning from ear to ear and reaching his eyes. Draco laughed as well, a deep chuckle this time, not like the one time Harry had been trying to cheer him up and tickled him, which resulted in high pitched giggles as he squirmed and tried to push Harry’s hands away.</p><p><br/> Harry knew it had to be magic, the magic of alcohol, which lowered inhibitions and caused rash behaviour that told you anything was possible. Magic was why, stood in the 8th year common room Draco pressed a kiss to Harrys cheek and whispered I love you Harry, before with a smile he turned and staggered off to his dorm room. It was a different magic, a stronger magic, that when Draco came up to him the next morning, red faced and stuttering about it being a mistake, Harry grabbed the front of Dracos robes, kissed him firmly on the lips and said I love you too.</p><p><br/> Harry was thankful for magic, magic that made him feel safe as he wrapped his arms tighter around Draco as they prepared to sleep, the magic Draco had, that chased away Harry’s nightmares, as if the blonde was a talisman capable of warding off all the evil in the world. He was thankful again when he woke up with Draco's warm body curled against him, a feeling of peace and happiness filling him each time the sun rose and Draco was still there, it must be magic.</p><p><br/> Harry was amazed by magic, as he slipped a gold band on Draco’s finger, followed a few minutes later by him leaning forward to kiss his husband, lips barely touching because they were both smiling too much. It had to be magic, after all harry thought, love really is magical.</p>
