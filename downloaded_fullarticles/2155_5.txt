          <div class="userstuff"><p>She embodied everything Pansy had ever hated.</p><p>First, she was WEIRD and it was unquestionably a bad start.</p><p>She believed in things that didn't exist. Worse : she saw them !</p><p>She was mad. As mad as a hatter. Only a mad person would use radishes as earrings.</p><p>Also, she was blond, and that was a capital crime. Pansy didn't like blond girls. They always stole your boyfriends. Astoria had done so without remorse.</p><p>Plus she was a blood traitor.</p><p> Moreover, she had shitty tastes. You couldn't wear a mustard yellow sweater with a peacock blue skirt ! - According to Pansy, you just didn't wear mustar yellow. Or peacock blue either, except under torture- </p><p>In spite of everything, the girl had a certain something.</p><p>Her protruding eyes had such a lovely blue color. </p><p>She was tender. She was kind and comforting. </p><p>She looked so candid.</p><p>Her fair hair, her pale skin, her ethereal air...</p><p>It was attractive. So attractive...</p><p>Those thoughts were dangerous. Pansy had never thought about a girl in this way before.</p><p>Must be teenagehood. Hormons, all that stuff...</p><p>She couldn't think that way. It wasn't allowed. It was unnatural.</p><p>She had to marry Theodore the day she'd turn twenty-one. It was set in stone. Their fathers had signed a contract. </p><p>Even if they hadn't, a girl had to marry a boy. Her mother had taught her so. Even if she hadn't taught her much else.</p><p>Then why did her name roll so sweetly on her tongue ? </p><p>Why did her skin feel so soft under Pansy's touch ? </p><p>Why were her lips so tempting ? </p><p>Why did she shiver when seductive words were whispered in her ear ? </p><p>Why was it so natural ? </p><p>Luna was weird. She was mad. She was a bloodtraitor. She was even blond, by Merlin ! She didn't have a fashion sense. Even worse - she was a girl.</p><p>She was everything Pansy had ever hated. </p><p>And maybe for all these reasons, Pansy loved her more than she thought herself to be able to.</p></div>
