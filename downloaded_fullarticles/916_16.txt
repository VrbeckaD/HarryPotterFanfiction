  <u> <strong> <em> LV's POV </em> </strong> </u>
</p><p align="justify">Voldemort walked out the cauldron and let Wormtail dress him up and give him back his own wand. Voldemort tasted the feeling of his old wand in his hand and then he caught sight of Harry Potter out of the corner of his eyes. Voldemort frowned and turned fully towards the lad. Really taking his features into account. <em>It could not be…</em></p><p align="justify">Ignoring the snivelling Wizard by his side, Voldemort approached the Young Wizard tied up against the headstone. Slowly, he raised his hand to the lad's face who shrieked in pain. Voldemort looked at his own hand and then towards Harry.</p><p align="justify">"You are raised by…?"</p><p align="justify">"Muggles." Came the gasping breath.</p><p align="justify">Voldemort nodded and stood up. He glanced at Harry's broken leg and wounded arm – he would have Wormtail at wand point for that one later – before he pointed his wand at the leg and slowly started healing the teenager. The lad gasped in pain but no scream left his mouth.<em> He really was raised to support pain.</em> Voldemort glanced at the lad's forehead when he was done with the leg and did a quick check-up spell as Harry tentatively tested his leg, confused, on his tied-up position. <em>Horcrux. So, that is what is causing the pain torment.</em> Leaning down and on his own heels, Voldemort faced Harry and gave him a look to stay still before he started chanting.</p><p align="justify">Miraculously, Harry did stay still through the whole incantation. Only daring to speak once Voldemort stood and went to check on the quivering Wizard that he had stopped to hear whimpering. Still alive, barely but still breathing.</p><p align="justify">"Not that I'm not thankful for my broken leg and the stop of forehead pain, but: <em>what the hell</em> are you doing? You've been trying to off me since before I was a bloody toddler!"</p><p align="justify">"Remember that I told you that I could give you back your parents?" Voldemort asked instead as he gave Wormtail a metal hand and forced a blood potion down his throat.</p><p align="justify">The Wizard had passed out at lack of blood after all.</p><p align="justify">"Yeah?" Voldemort glared at the lad, who immediately amended: "Yes, I remember. Still, you were just saying whatever to make me help you out."</p><p align="justify">"I can not revive them without the philosopher stone." Voldemort agreed. "Yet, I can give you something else." Harry frowned puzzled. The Dark Lord smiled at it. <em>Some things never change.</em> "It was not until I regained my body and really looked at you that I recognised you. From the '70s."</p><p align="justify">Harry's eyes grew, hopefully.</p><p align="justify">"You mean travel back in time? Meet my parents in school?"</p><p align="justify">"You will not be able to change their future." Voldemort argued at the too hopeful look.</p><p align="justify">"But I can meet them." Harry argued with a frown.</p><p align="justify">"Yes. You cannot go as Harry James Potter. Just as some obvious Potter features that you have need to be tuned down. Not to mention that we need to wait for Spring Solstice so Magic allows me to do it and for me to have all the paperwork ready to send you."</p><p align="justify">Harry's frown deepened as he thought about it.</p><p align="justify">"It'll hurt like a bitch, won't it?"</p><p align="justify">"Both the body change and the time-travel." Voldemort agreed while glaring at the lad for the wording.</p><p align="justify">"Spring? That's almost a year away."</p><p align="justify">Voldemort smiled amused and did a quick <em>Tempus</em> – which ironically he had once learned thanks to past Harry.</p><p align="justify">"8 months, 29 days and… 33 minutes, I would say."</p><p align="justify">Harry just succumbed back unto the tombstone wide-eyed as it really clicked that Voldemort wasn't jesting him.</p><p align="justify">"How long am I meant to spend back in time?"</p><p align="justify">"I do not know, to tell you the truth." Harry's eyes grew. "When I went after the Potters you were still in the past." Voldemort explained.</p><p align="justify">"Can you release me?" Harry asked uncertain.</p><p align="justify">"First: I want you to agree to this."</p><p align="justify">Harry glared up at Voldemort.</p><p align="justify">"Only if I'm allowed to return to Hogwarts. I want to say my goodbyes. In case you haven't noticed, I won't see friends-like-family for decades."</p><p align="justify">Voldemort nodded and Harry then gave his verbal agreement. The Dark Lord wondered if he should have warned the lad about his parents' personalities…</p><p align="justify">Voldemort released Harry who tentatively tested his leg, before he stood.</p><p align="justify">"So… I see you in winter?"</p><p align="justify">Voldemort hummed as he thought about it. It would give him enough time for Harry's features changes before the time-travel.</p><p align="justify">"Agreed. And Harry?" Harry stopped to look back from where he was retrieving his own wand from Wormtail's slack human hand. "I want the Muggles' full address."</p><p align="justify">"Why?"</p><p align="justify">"Do you think I am doing this out of the goodness of my own heart?"</p><p align="justify">The lad blushed.</p><p align="justify">"That's your payment? My relatives' exact location?"</p><p align="justify">"Indeed."</p><p align="justify">Harry hummed at that.</p><p align="justify">"Then I'll tell you exactly one minute before the Spring Solstice."</p><p align="justify">Voldemort smiled amused as the lad approached the dead body of his fellow Champion. Harry summoned the cup and Voldemort reactivated the Portkey to send him back to Hogwarts. Only once Harry was out of earshot did Voldemort allow his laugh.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>So, this was what his young lover looked like before he entered Hogwarts in the past?</em>
