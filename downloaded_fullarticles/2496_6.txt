    <p>To put it simply, Harry had had a horrible week. He got detention from Snape for breathing or something equally mundane, he wasn’t really paying attention. Come to think of it, maybe that was why… But he wouldn’t have been spacing out if he hadn’t been rejected by Cho Chang! Apparently she was already going with Cedric, not that he minded that, he had nothing against him. He was really attractive and good looking and nice. No, he really couldn’t blame her for going with him, hell he’d go with Cedric if he asked. Wait what? No that didn’t seem right… Harry was supposed to like girls, wasn’t he? That's what uncle Vernon always said... But that didn’t feel right either.</p>
<p>Either way, his point remained. This week was utter bollocks and nothing would fix it. He stormed out of the dungeons after the usual snide comments and glares from the so-called potions professor, planning on heading straight back to the Gryffindor tower where he would spend the rest of the night complaining. In his defence, he never claimed to be creative in his plans for leisure. The cold night air kissed his skin as he started making his way to where he assumed the closest staircase was. You think after spending a bit over 3 years here, he’d have figured out where everything was, but that wouldn’t be the case.</p>
<p>"Life is just peachy, isn't it?" He started muttering to himself. At the very least, it'd add sound to the overly quiet hallway. "Wait no, it's not. If only I could have had the guts to ask her out just a few days earlier! Then I'd have a date and wouldn't need to worry about asking somebody else. But she's going with Cedric... at least I know she'll have fun though, which is more than I can say about me right now." He shivered as the cold seeped through the walls, was talking to himself a good sign or bad? He supposed it didn't really matter, as long as the company was good. And he was good company, he made fantastic jokes! It wasn't his fault that nobody else laughed at them or found them funny, everybody else just had bad tastes. </p>
<p>The hallways were empty and far too quiet for his liking, which set him on edge. It was at this moment he could practically hear Mad-Eye Moody’s catchphrase ‘constant vigilance’ shouting through his head. How Slytherins could stand living in this part of the castle, Harry would never know. After a minute or so looking for a staircase to get out of there, he was getting pretty sick of it, he was about to give up when he heard footsteps behind him. A million thoughts started running through his head, what should he do? Was he in danger? What type of question was that, when wasn’t he in danger?</p>
<p>“Oi! Potter!” Visibly relaxing, he turned around with a sneer before coming face to face with the one and only Malfoy. As he waited for the blonde git to catch up to him, he couldn’t help but think something was off. Malfoy never confronted him without some sort of backup, what was he even doing out of bed at this hour? It was really late, he took a quick glimpse at his watch to see the hour hand resting on nine and oh Merlin he was old.</p>
<p>“What do you want Malfoy? If you couldn’t tell I’m a bit busy.” Draco looked him deep in the eyes, raising an eyebrow as if questioning his sanity. Honestly, he couldn’t blame him, he’d been in quite a weird situation when Malfoy starting chasing him at his usual elegant slow walking pace.</p>
<p>“Busy with what? Getting lost?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have you know, getting lost is a talent. A talent that I happen to be very good at, you think you can just get this good at getting lost? You need practice.” What the hell was he saying? Why did he say that of all things? He waited for the insult, however, it never came and it was now Harry’s turn to raise an eyebrow as he waited for the blond to speak. Now that he looked, and he meant really looked, he noticed that Malfoy seemed nervous and kept switching his weight from leg to leg. Was he that nervous about confronting him alone? Why did he even decide to do this if that was the case?</p>
<p>“Look,” He started, realising he wasn’t saying anything, “you need help getting to the Gryffindor tower right? And don’t even bother denying it, you are clearly lost. So I’ll take you there after all nobody is better at navigating the dungeons as I am.” Despite himself, Harry knew he needed Malfoy’s help. So, if somewhat hesitantly, he began to follow Malfoy’s lead away from the dungeons.</p>
<p>Neither of them spoke, and Harry was fine with that, despite Malfoy clearly going over something that could only be described as painful. So time went on slowly, with the silence from the castle offering little help. Even after a while, he struggled to find something, anything, to say. Was it always this difficult to have a conversation with Malfoy? Now that he thought about it, he never really had a conversation with the Malfoy heir before. No wait, he did talk to him in Madam Malkin’s, and again on the train in their first year. But after that, their interactions have all been arguments of some sort.</p>
<p>“Here. Gryffindor tower told you I could get you here.” Harry never doubted him, though he didn’t say it out loud. He muttered a small thanks before getting ready to walk through the portrait, but before he could Malfoy quickly grabbed his arm. “Wait! I wanted to, I mean… That’s not the only reason I wanted to speak to you.”</p>
<p>Malfoy stood there, waiting to see if he’d say anything in reply. Not that he had anything to say, so he just waited for the grey-eyed Slytherin to continue on whatever he was talking about. It took a few minutes, in which he tried to wait as patiently as he could. He knew what it was like to try and find the right words, only to have insults thrown your way, so he waited.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t help but overhear you and the Weasel - I mean Weasley - today, and heard that you didn’t have a date to the Yule Ball.” Malfoy paused while he himself silently applauded Malfoy for not insulting his friend, though it heightened his earlier suspicions. What was he planning? “Well, it just so happens that I don’t have a date either, and I was thinking maybe we could possibly go together?” What?</p>
<p>“What?” seconds felt like hours as Harry took in what had just happened. Malfoy, his school enemy, asked him to the Yule Ball. His school enemy asked him on a date. The fuck? “Oh. Oh, I get it. You think this is funny, right? Look at ‘Saint Potter’ popular enough to be Dumbledore’s golden boy, but not enough to get a date! Let’s all laugh at Potter, shall we? Wait even better! Let’s see how low he’s willing to go? My money’s on Malfoy!”</p>
<p>He exploded at him, yelling enough that he wouldn’t be surprised if everybody woke up with his screaming, even though it wasn’t that late but that was a minor issue. His face turned into an angry snarl as the boy in front on him took a small step back, his face showing panic. Yeah, clearly he didn’t expect him to figure out his little ruse.</p>
<p>“Jokes on you Malfoy, that poker face you're so proud of gave you away. So congratulations, you officially became a statue! Your father must be so proud.” He turned away and started to walk through the painting, his anger already morphing into shame. “Just go back to the dungeons, the damp air matches your cold heart.”</p>
<p>“Harry, wait!” But he didn’t. He was sick of waiting, he was sick of waiting for Ron and Hermione to sort out whatever was happening between them, he was sick of being the odd one out, and he was sick of Malfoy trying to make fun of him for things he didn’t ask for, or couldn’t change. So he ignored the looks others gave him when he entered the Gryffindor common room and ignored how scared and hopeless Malfoy had looked when he caught on. He ignored everything.</p>
