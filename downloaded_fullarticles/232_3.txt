    <p>,, And the champion of Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour!" </p>
<p>It was headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Albus Dumbledore. I knew that from that moment everything would change. But now I was not so sure. I did not had high hopes about the tournament. But at least I learned a thing or two, gained new friendships and I can stay here for the rest of the year, which is dangerously close. And the last trial also...</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p>There are two days before the last trial, two weeks before the end of the school year. There are not many people on the court, even though it's almost summer. And then I will go back to France. I will miss Hogwarts, but Beauxbatons is home... </p>
<p>While writing Herbology essay, I saw two people with suitcases rushing to the entrance. A woman, in maybe my mothers age and a boy in mine. Both were red headed. I assume that they were the Weasleys, both similar to Ron. The door opened and Professor McGonagall came out. She greeted them immediately. I caught a glimpse of their conversation.</p>
<p>,, Minerva! I couldn't wait to come here. You remember Bill."<br/>
,, Good day Professor McGonagall<br/>
It's ben while since I've been here..."<br/>
,, Welcome! You're right, it's been a while.. I think that Harry and Ron are in common room, but you'll be staying in northern tower close to teacher bedrooms. Come with me..." </p>
<p>And they went into the castle. Bill turned around and saw me leaning back against the wall. We quickly locked eyes, before he disappeared from my view. I finished my homework, packed my things and went back to castle.</p>
<p>On my way to common room I waved to a few friends, including Roger Davis, with whom I went to the Yule Ball. He was a good guy, but we remained friends. When I was waving I hit someone. For god's sake he or she caught me, and I did not end on the floor. When I looked up to see who it was, I saw really pretty blue eyes...</p>
<p>,, I'm so sorry, I wasn't looking where I was going..." I said nervously.<br/>
,, It's fine I was looking everywhere else, just not in front of me... I'm Bill. Bill Weasley."<br/>
,, Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons."<br/>
,, I thought so... I would remember such pretty girl..."</p>
<p>I started to blush. I'm used to people compliment me, I'm from quarter Veela, but now I was more flattered than ever.</p>
<p>,, Thank you... Ehmmm... I'm glad that I met you, but I have to go back to tower..."<br/>
,, A princess going back to her tower? Should I save you?"<br/>
,, Non thank you, but maybe later..."<br/>
,, Okay see you..."<br/>
,, Bye..."</p>
<p>And we both left in opposite directions. He to the Gryffindor tower and me to the Ravenclaw tower. I rushed back, so no one could see me blush. I answered the question and went to room where were other girls.</p>
<p>,, Fleur where were you? For second I turn away and you're not there.."<br/>
,, Excuse moi what?.. I was doing my Herbology essay.."<br/>
,, Oh, of course honey and that's why you're blushing so hard..."</p>
<p>Anastasia always knew what was with me. Always. Sometimes it was a bit scary...</p>
<p>,, Spill it out. Who is it?"<br/>
,, Who is who?"<br/>
,, The guy you like. Otherwise you wouldn't be blushing and smiling wide. Is he from here? Or Durmstrang? Which house?"<br/>
,, Okay, okay, I'll tell you, just calm down.. When I was at the court I saw him going into the castle. And then I bumped into him in hallway. Well we bumped into each other. He's Bill Weasley. He's sweet.. And pretty..."<br/>
,, Wait Weasley? Like brother of Ron Weasley from Gryffindor?"<br/>
,, Qui that one..."<br/>
,, You'll show me on dinner. I need to know who messed with our Fleurs head..."<br/>
,, That's not funny. He's the first guy to look at me not like a Veela, or some kind of a picture, but me as a person."<br/>
,, Now that's interesting..."</p>
<p>I took of my jumper and threw on a hoodie with my initials. Anastasia put on also a hoodie and we went on dinner. While walking to Great Hall we saw Harry and Ron, leaving. We waved at them, they waved back, well at least Harry did, Ron just nodded. I guess he's still embarrassed about the Yule Ball thing.</p>
<p>We sat at Ravenclaw table, where were few girls from my school. My friends Mia and Tia were looking at me. It was a bit weird...</p>
<p>,, Girls? Do I have something on my face?"<br/>
,, You mean the smile that won't go away since you sat down? So who is it?" I did not expect Tia to figure it out that quick...<br/>
,, Why it has to be someone necessarily?"<br/>
,, Oh please from the moment you sat at the table you were keeping an eye on the entrance. Come on! From which house is he?"</p>
<p>I glimpsed at the entrance where was Bill, Mrs Weasley and and a red headed girl. I assumed it was Bills sister, Ginny. I saw Bill looking around the Hall, when his eyes stopped on our table. We looked into each others eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>,, That's him! Well Fleur!"<br/>
,, What?!" </p>
<p>We all started to laugh...</p>
