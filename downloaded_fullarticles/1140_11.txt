  <em>Alouette, gentille alouette/Je te plumerai</em>
</p><p>She was no stranger to these types of things. Honestly, did these men never learn from their mistakes?</p><p>
  <em>Alouette, gentille alouette/Je te plumerai</em>
</p><p>She calmly wiped the blood from her dagger. Doing things the muggle way was far easier; her wand would reveal nothing in the event of questioning, she didn’t have to account for the fact that bright green light would alert witnesses; all in all, she preferred the old-fashioned way.</p><p>
  <em>Je te plumerai la tete/Je te plumerai la tete</em>
</p><p>Minimizing the blood was a simple task, if you knew your anatomy. And if there’s one thing that Hermione Granger still prides herself on, it’s knowing things.</p><p>
  <em>Et la tete/Et la tete</em>
</p><p>This one had had it coming. He was one of the last few Aurors that was responsible for…everything. He denied any involvement in the case. He covered his tracks. But he wasn’t thorough enough.</p><p>
  <em>Alouett’/Alouett’</em>
</p><p>It was in an alleyway that she finally managed to corner him. Her only regret was that he’d managed to Patronus for help, meaning that she didn’t get to spend as much time as she’d like. At least this one didn’t identify her as the attacker. She had been careless, and what had that gotten her? A mess that took months to clean up.</p><p>
  <em>Alouette, gentille alouette/Je te plumerai</em>
</p><p>She noticed something rather ironic as she apparated away. A poster, clearly magical, asking for information on the “Orchid Killer.” That, she supposed, was the title that the press had given her.</p><p>
  <em>Je te plumerai le bec/Je te plumerai le bec</em>
</p><p>Speaking of the press, she had another letter to send to the Prophet. That may have been her favourite part of this whole “serial killer” business, though her hands would be clean of it soon.</p><p>
  <em>Et le bec/Et le bec</em>
</p><p>The letters, of course, were compromised of cuttings from Witch Weekly. They taunted the Prophet, the Ministry, and anyone with some semblance of authority. They were all signed, “With Love; Orchid~”</p><p>
  <em>Et la tete/Et la tete</em>
</p><p>In these letters, she had made it plainly obvious that the sender was, in fact, the mass murderer that these agencies were searching for. She chose the pseudonym “Orchid,” because it was a flower that represented death. Almost like a lily.</p><p>
  <em>Alouett’/Alouett’</em>
</p><p>Sometimes, there would be a little voice of doubt in the back of her mind, asking if she was truly doing the right thing. There was no arguing, however, that she was absolutely in the right. She had to be.</p><p>
  <em>Alouette, gentille alouette/Alouette, je te plumerai</em>
</p><p>Back in the beginning of all of this, many had suspected Ginny. No, she shouldn’t be expected to do this task. She was close to him, yes, but she hadn’t really known him for as long as she had. Some things can only be gained by being friends since first year.</p><p>
  <em>Je te plumerai le nez/Je te plumerai le nez</em>
</p><p>Ron would’ve been her ally in this; he should’ve been. She imagined that he wanted to be, too, if things hadn’t happened the way they had.</p><p>
  <em>Et le nez (x2)/Et le bec (x2)</em>
</p><p>There were others that could’ve helped. There were others that would aid her in a heartbeat; but it wasn’t their duty. They weren’t nearly as tied up in this as she was.</p><p>
  <em>Et la tete (x2)/Alouett’ (x2)</em>
</p><p>But possible allies and old friends were in the past; it was time to let those particular bygones be bygones. Some things, however, had to be remedied.</p><p>
  <em>Alouette, gentille alouette/Alouette, je te plumerai</em>
</p><p>It had been precisely 10 years since the Battle of Hogwarts. That’s when everything happened, on that anniversary event. That’s when she lost her best friend. And it was all their fault.</p><p>
  <em>Je te plumerai le cou/Je te plumerai le cou</em>
</p><p>And, of course, a week later, they took her husband. Rose was all she had left, until they took her too.</p><p>
  <em>Et le cou (x2)/Et le nez (x2)</em>
</p><p>For a while, she was entirely convinced that she’d be taken, too. She nearly was, but Fate is a bitch. Fate made her survive. Now, she belatedly realized, she knew what Harry felt like when people spoke of his parents.</p><p>
  <em>Et le bec (x2)/Et la tete (x2)</em>
</p><p>A bit later, she realized that she was spared for a reason. She had a mission. She had to make them all pay their penance, or at least die trying.</p><p>
  <em>Alouette/Alouette</em>
</p><p>Maybe the voice in the back of her mind was right. But it was far too late to be right. For everyone’s sakes, it had to be wrong.</p><p>
  <em>Alouette, gentille alouette/Alouette, je te plumerai</em>
</p><p>So now, she took the name of the death flower and delivered justice. She had to.</p><p>
  <em>Je te plumerai le dos (x2)</em>
</p><p>For Harry, her brother in all but blood.</p><p>
  <em>Et le dos (x2)/Et le cou (x2)</em>
</p><p>For James Sirius.</p><p>
  <em>Et le nez (x2)/ Et le bec (x2)</em>
</p><p>For Albus Severus.</p><p>
  <em>Et la tete (x2)/Alouett’ (x2)</em>
</p><p>For Lily Luna.</p><p>
