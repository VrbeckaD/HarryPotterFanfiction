    <p>[Draco]<br/>
He's just a lonely orphan, son of a witch and a warlock,<br/>
Sleeping in the middle of the floor, lock<br/>
On his cupboard door from the outside.  Now who'd have thought this kid'll<br/>
Grow up to vanquish Tom Marvolo Riddle?<br/>
<br/>
[Ron]<br/>
Around Potter<br/>
Things seemed to get odder<br/>
The glass disappeared<br/>
Let out a huge boa<br/>
He got a lot of letters<br/>
But they had no senders<br/>
Out on the sea<br/>
He's visited by the groundskeeper</p>
<p>[Hermione]<br/>
And every day wizards weren't bothered, not warded against the maniac that raved, that huddled and power restored up,<br/>
Meanwhile, scar was throbbing lightening upon Harry’s forehead<br/>
The brother was ready to bet the dark lord was not dead.<br/>
<br/>
[Neville]<br/>
Then along September came, and Potter got away<br/>
Our boy saw no platform with the number he did crave<br/>
Heard a mother with her children, she helped him with his aim<br/>
Through a wall he got no pain, there was magic once again.<br/>
<br/>
[Draco]<br/>
Well the word got around, they said "Potter's on the train, man".<br/>
A kid knocked on his door saying "everywhere is taken"<br/>
His name was Ronald Weasley, he saw Potter in the station,<br/>
And of course he knew the boy's name. What's your name, man?<br/>
<br/>
[Harry]<br/>
Harry Potter, Chosen One.<br/>
They call me Harry Potter, Chosen One.<br/>
And there’s a lotta things I haven’t done,<br/>
But just you wait, just you wait.<br/>
<br/>
[Ginny]<br/>
When he was one his father died as he tried hard to hide him<br/>
From Tom Riddle, prophesied to find those thrice defied him.<br/>
Inside, he told Lily “Stand back, it’s not you”—<br/>
So Harry was protected when his mother died too.<br/>
<br/>
[Dumbledore]<br/>
Moved in with a cousin and uncle and aunt Petunia.<br/>
Started to do a lot of things most peculiar.<br/>
Petunia cut his hair, it grew back, and that’s the truth.<br/>
And how exactly should he know why he was standing on the roof?<br/>
<br/>
[Draco]<br/>
Where’s it he could've been heading to?<br/>
His dream seemed absolute,<br/>
He‘s giving the Dursley’s the boot<br/>
Without a whiff of hesitation,<br/>
Train slowing, flowing with all them nervous kids aboard,<br/>
All waiting, anticipating to join the older student hoards<br/>
Crammin’ through every nook, he’s off, the train’s gone,<br/>
Scanning for a giant, there’s a lake that he can sail on,<br/>
The bow of a boat, Castle in the distance,<br/>
In Hogwarts you can be a wizard.</p>
<p>[Chorus]<br/>
In Hogwarts you can be a wizard<br/>
<br/>
[Harry]<br/>
Just you wait<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
In Hogwarts you can be a wizard<br/>
<br/>
[Harry]<br/>
Just you wait<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
In Hogwarts you can be a wizard<br/>
In Hogwarts you can be a wizard<br/>
In Hogwarts<br/>
<br/>
[Harry]<br/>
Just you wait<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Harry Potter, chosen one<br/>
We are waiting in the wings for you<br/>
You could never calm down,<br/>
You never seemed to have enough time<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Harry Potter, Chosen One<br/>
When the Magic World sings for you<br/>
Will they know what you overcame?<br/>
Will they know that you lost the game<br/>
Your world will never be the same, oh<br/>
<br/>
[Draco]<br/>
The train is the station now<br/>
See if you can spot him<br/>
A lonely orphan boy coming up from the bottom<br/>
His friendships will make him whole, his tragedies will build him<br/>
<br/>
[Ron/Hermione]<br/>
We fought with him.<br/>
<br/>
[Sirius/James/Snape]<br/>
Me, I died for him<br/>
<br/>
[Dumbledore]<br/>
Me, I trusted him<br/>
<br/>
[Lily/Ginny/Molly]<br/>
Me, I loved him<br/>
<br/>
[Voldemort]<br/>
And me. I'm the Dark Lord that killed him.<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
There's so many things I haven't done<br/>
But just you wait<br/>
<br/>
[Draco]<br/>
What's your name man?<br/>
<br/>
[All]<br/>
Harry Potter, Chosen One</p>
