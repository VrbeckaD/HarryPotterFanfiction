</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Harry Potter was a singular young man whose name evoked extraordinary reactions from various individuals, ranging from effusive praise to barely concealed disdain and disgust to total befuddlement. The only thing that everyone who heard rumor of him or had knowledge would likely agree to if they could be consulted was that Harry Potter was an unusual boy in a number of ways. And they would be correct. He <em>was</em> an unusual boy for a host of reasons, ranging from the fact that he was an orphan who lived with relatives that appeared to loathe the very specter of his presence to the fact that for a boy who was allegedly such a pernicious troublemaker in the streets of Little Whinging, he was oddly absent from the neighborhood for months on end and would only make brief appearances during the summer hols. These long stretches in which he disappeared from public view had been explained by his relatives as him attending a reformatory school for delinquents, but it was actually due to this little known and extraordinary fact:</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter was a wizard.</p><p> </p><p>And he not just any ordinary wizard, but a national icon among the wizards hiding in plain sight within Great Britain. For he was known to them as the Boy-Who-Lived.  For the past couple of years, he had been spending several months at a time at the country's most famous school for training young witches and wizards, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Now it wasn't always sunshine and roses at Hogwarts, and Harry as well as his friends often found themselves mixed up in harrowing events that pitted them in dangerous encounters with the darker elements of their world. In spite of that however, in his mind Hogwarts was the place that he felt most accepted and at peace. When the year would inevitably end, he would find himself back among the Dursleys, his relatives who were more than happy to never see him darken their doorsteps again. Nevertheless he returned summer after summer, which always led to him having an unfortunate and irritating conundrum that he was forced to deal with before his long hoped for return to the world of wizards. </p><p> </p><p>His homework for the summer hols. </p><p> </p><p>With minutes to go until the clock struck midnight, Harry was locked in his room with a blanket over his thin form, flashlight in the one hand and a thick leather bound book in the other as he peered through its pages in pursuit of his homework for the History of Magic. His textbook, the History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot was ostensibly the official text utilized for this class (although in practice, it was barely referred to by his Professor, a ghost named Cultberth Binns, who died in the midst of his preparations for History of Magic many long decades ago. This was clearly evidenced by his unnatural emphasis on Goblin rebellions.), and his summer essay assignment was to explain why the witch burnings of the 14th century were largely pointless in attempts to root out the magical community.</p><p> </p><p>As Harry pored through the section detailing the magical community's perspective on the witch hunts and burnings, he came across a passage that seemed to unveil a trove of information that could answer the demands of the essay. Reaching under his pillow, Harry pulled out his ink bottle and his eagle feather tipped quill, and after dipping the quill in the ink, began to copy down a interesting passage that he felt could shed light on the topic to which he was assigned:</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">
  <em>Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no affect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in various disguises. </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>  </p><p>Harry shook his head in disbelief as he copied down the relevant information down upon his sheet of parchment. Forty-seven times! It simply boggled the mind. Wendelin certainly earned her title, that much was certain. No amount of flame freezing charms could convince <em>him</em> to allow himself to be set on fire! Smothering a yawn threatening to overpower him, Harry faithfully completed the inclusion of this example for his History essay and after several minutes of scrawling across the parchment with his thoughts on the passage and how it related to the assignment, Harry replaced the cover on his ink bottle with a tired sigh and tucked the still unfinished essay into the book he gleaned the information from. It was getting pretty late. It might be better to try and finish it up the next day. Setting his school things away where he was fairly confident his loathsome relatives wouldn't find them, Harry swung bleary eyes towards the alarm clock that he had salvaged and set up on his bedside table only to freeze when he saw the time.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>11:59 A.M. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry's heart pounded in a mixture of trepidation and reluctant excitement. He was only a minute away from crossing the threshold from waning childhood to young adulthood. When the clock struck twelve, it would be July 31st and he would officially be thirteen years old. His stomach flopped as he considered what it actually would mean for him. He had never really looked forward to his birthdays for most of his life, what with the Dursleys taking every possible opportunity to display just how much they hated and despised him for simply existing. It hadn't been until that fateful day two years ago, when pitifully wishing himself a happy birthday that the miraculous arrival of Hagrid, one of his first friends from the wizarding world caused him to start looking forward to the day of his birth. Even considering how horrible the last days of his stay with the Dursleys were last summer, the highlight of that birthday was when he had been rescued by his best friend Ron Weasley and his older twin brothers, Fred and George. While he still wasn't overly fond of birthdays the way that Dudley or even the other youth in the neighborhood often were, he couldn't repress the small shiver of excitement as he contemplated how the world he now considered firmly his own would weave itself into his birthday this year.</p><p> </p><p>He stilled as the clock sitting over the mantel of the Dursleys' living room began in toll the midnight hour. Once, twice, three times it chimed and Harry couldn't help the intake of breath as each successive toll announced to the household- the world really, that he had managed to survive another year and was now a teenager. On and on it continued until twelve solemn chimes concluded the heralding of the 31st day of July, the day he had been born. It was his birthday. </p><p> </p><p> Slipping out of his somewhat uncomfortable bed, Harry drew near the window of his bedroom and looked out towards the starry skies. He smirked mirthlessly to himself, though no one could see it. He had crossed such an incredible threshold, but yet he was alone. The Dursleys certainly wouldn't even bother to wish him a happy birthday; in fact, he could almost guarantee that they would do their endeavored best as they did for the previous eleven birthdays that he 'enjoyed' under their disapproving eyes to make this day particularly unpleasant and irksome. But that was a problem for the daylight hours. </p><p> </p><p>Harry cast a longing eye towards the large and empty cage that served as the home for his faithful owl, Hedwig. The snow white owl had winged away two nights before and had not returned since.  Harry wasn't really worried about her safety though. Hedwig had taken several similar flights over the last couple of years that they had spent together. No, he simply missed having a companion in the house who didn't flinch at the sight of him or blow up at the slightest hint of magic. </p><p> </p><p>With a sigh, Harry continued idly staring out of his window unto the expansive sky. He wondered if Hedwig might return at any moment, dropping the carcass of a mouse or some other critter that she had caught proudly at his feet with the expectation of praise. He chuckled a bit at the sight that would be and began daydreaming about various comedic entrances when his eyes spotted something moving in the dark sky, moving towards Number Four. </p><p> </p><p>The reflected light of the moon shone on the object as it came closer and closer into view and to Harry's amazement, he realized that it was some type of creature. It was lopsided in appearance and more worrying, it was definitely head in his direction. Harry hesitated as his hand drew automatically to the latch of the windowsill. He was tempted to shut the window immediately and ward off whatever that thing was, but suppose it didn't slow down and simply plowed through the window, glass and all? He could only imagine the spectacle that would arise from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia if the resultant racket spoiled their rest. He winced, almost feeling the blows that would rain on him by an enraged Vernon. </p><p> </p><p>The matter changed however as the creature flew over one of the street lamps on Privet Drive and aimed straight for his window. Harry, realizing what it was, leapt to the side. </p><p> </p><p>Through the window flew in two owls, incredibly holding up a third which appeared to be unconscious. They crashed into Harry's bed with a muffled thump, the aforementioned third owl keeling over immediately as the other owls relinquished their unexpected burden. Harry winced in sympathy as he realized the identity of the third owl, who had a large package tied to its legs. It was Errol, the aged and frankly overpressed family owl of the Weasleys.  Rushing the bed, Harry hastened to remove the cords tying the package to the feeble owl. Once he had successfully untied it, he picked up the owl and brought it over to Hedwig's cage. Poor Errol managed to cast a bleary eye upon him and hoot feebly before proceeding to drink from the water dish. </p><p> </p><p>That crisis abated, Harry turned to the remaining two owls who were still perched on his bed. One of them was his own Hedwig, looking very pleased with herself and carrying a parcel. She nipped Harry affectionately as he busied himself with untying her burden and immediately winged her way to the cage next to Errol. He then turned his attention to the third member of that strange trio that had flown into his room and paused. The owl was unfamiliar to him, but was a handsome tawny owl. His eyes fell upon the burden it was carrying and lit up in recognition. It must be a Hogwarts owl, for tied to its legs was a package and a familiar envelope bearing the Hogwarts crest. He carefully removed both items from the owl and as soon as it was free, it ruffled its feathers a bit pompously and flew off into the night. </p><p> </p><p>Trembling with anticipation, for Harry hadn't received packages from anyone, ever in his entire life aside from the hundreds of Hogwarts letters that had been sent to him by the school when he had failed to answer his initial letter, Harry reached for the package that was from the Weasleys. Ripping open the rather bland brown paper, his eyes widened as he withdrew a small box wrapped in gold colored wrapping paper and a card...his very first birthday card...</p><p> </p><p>Shaken, but in a good way, Harry carefully opened the envelope. Withdrawing the card and opening it he noticed two objects falling out of the card, a letter and a newspaper clipping.  Picking up the newspaper clipping Harry quickly noted it as from a wizarding paper, as the black and white photograph was moving. Curious now, Harry smoothed out the folded clipping and read:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><hr/>

  <strong>Ministry of Magic Employee Scoops Grand Prize!</strong>

Held each year near the middle of July, the Grand Prize Galleon Draw is held at the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic in an event open to the general public, as has been tradition for the past forty-five years. The runners up for the Grand Prize include the winner of Second Place, Ms. Verna Blighley who drew the prize of 2,500 Galleons; Third Place winner Mr. Octavious Merkle, who drew the prize of 850 Galleons; and The Honorable Mention winner Mrs. Elphebe Mordaunt, who has won a free year's subscription to the </em>Daily Prophet. </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"><em>Mr. Arthur Weasley, as the Grand Prize Winner drew the prize of 5,000 Galleons and a free year's subscription to the </em>Daily Prophet<em>. In an interview with the winners a delighted Mr. Weasley told the </em>Daily Prophet<em>, "We'll be saving the bulk of it of course and using it as necessary to help our children with their schooling. We will however, be spending a bit of the gold on a summer holiday to Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill works as a curse-breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank."</em></p><p align="center">

<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p> Harry grinned at the photograph that had been taken of the Weasleys. There was Mr. Weasley, Mrs. Weasley who had spent so much effort trying to fatten him up the previous holiday and who had knitted him sweaters every Christmas since he started at Hogwarts, six boys, among whom was his best friend Ron, and Ginny. They were all standing in front of a pyramid and waving furiously at him from the photo. Ron in particular looked to have grown at least another three inches from the last time he had seen him, with Scabbers his old and mostly useless rat hanging on his shoulder and his arm over his sister's shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>In Harry's humble opinion, there wasn't anyone who deserved a nice pile of gold more than the Weasleys who were gregarious and generous, but also often strapped for coin. Turning his attention to the letter that had been included in the birthday card, Harry opened it to see Ron's familiar scrawl:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I hope that your holiday hasn't been as awful as it was last year with those bloody Muggles. If we weren't on a holiday to Egypt right now, I would have nagged Mum and Dad to let you stay over with us at the Burrow for a couple of weeks. We still have a few weeks of holiday left, but you just let us know if those Muggles are treating you poorly. We'll figure something out!</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I can't believe that Dad won the Grand Galleon Draw! This is the first time that we've gotten a chance to visit Bill in Egypt. It's incredible! He took us all around the old tombs and you wouldn't believe the curses that those old Egyptian wizards placed on them. Mum wouldn't let Ginny enter the last one we saw (which brassed her off rather nicely, let me tell you), on account of all the mutant Muggle skeletons that were there, thieves I reckon who broke in there and grew extra heads and stuff. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>We won't be back home until the end of August, maybe a week or a few days before we take the train. Dad already promised me that he'd buy me a new wand when we go down to London to get our things for school. Any chance that you'll be able to meet us there? </em>

  <strong>Ron</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">Harry laughed at the post script to the letter where a clearly disgruntled Ron informed him that Percy had been chosen to serve as Head Boy this year. He could see why. In the photograph taken of the Weasleys, Harry could easily make out the profile of the third eldest Weasley, thrusting out his chest to display the Head Boy badge on his shirt proudly. He bet that Ron and Ginny and the Twins must be getting an earful from him concerning proper decorum and appropriate behavior while at school. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He also appreciated the gift that Ron had bought for him in Egypt, a pocket sized Sneakoscope which was enchanted to alert you when someone nearby was preparing to do something nefarious. He snorted at the anecdote that Ron added in his note explaining the gift, of Bill casting aspersion on the quality of the device when it went off during the dinner, all the while ignorant of his younger brothers putting beetles in his soup!</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Placing the Sneakoscope on his bedside table, he turned his attention to the parcel delivered by Hedwig. Opening it up, he discovered a wrapped present, card and letter from his other best friend, Hermione. Grinning broadly, Harry opened the letter to read Hermione's no doubt voluminous letter:</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em>Dear Harry,</em> </strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>How has your summer been so far? I hope that everything is alright with your relatives. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I'm on holiday in France with my parents and I wasn't even sure if I'd be able to send you the present I got for your birthday, but then all of a sudden Hedwig showed up! I don't know if I've ever said it, but Hedwig is truly a treasure, Harry. I'm certain that she came all of the way here to France because she wanted to make sure that you got something nice for your birthday for a change. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>I brought your present by owl order, thanks to the subscription that my parents got me for the Daily Prophet (something that you should consider as well Harry. Being kept up to date on all of the latest matters taking place in Magical Britain is an important objective.). I really hope that you'll enjoy it. Did you read about Ron and his family winning that prize and taking a trip to Egypt last week? I'm so happy for them. And jealous. I mean, it's Egypt! I bet Ron is learning loads...the Egyptian forms of witchcraft and wizardry are terribly fascinating!</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>All the same, there's so much to learn about here in France as well. I've been learning so much since we've arrived here, France has such a rich and illuminating history involving witchcraft. Have you started on your History of Magic essay? Since I came here, I've had to add so much more to my essay. I hope that Professor Binn will be pleased with it. I ended up writing two more rolls than was required. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Did you know that magical France is under a form of monarchy still? It turns out that the fall of the royal family in Muggle France had absolutely no effect on the status of the royals on the magical side of the country. The royal family still holds political power today, though they tend to work through the auspices of the French Ministry. Utterly fascinating! I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the implications of it. I won't wax on about it here, but I'll definitely be updating you about it once we're back in school. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Ron told me that they'll be in London a week before the train leaves for Hogwarts. I managed to get my parents to agree to let me stay with the Weasleys once they return to Britain. We'll most likely be back in Britain sometime next week. Can you meet us in London this year? Will your relatives' let you? Hopefully they will, but if not, then I'll see you the train on September 1st!</em>

Magical Royalty? That was not something that he'd ever really thought about, although now that he was thinking about it, it actually did make some sort of sense. With as long lived as a vast majority of the wizarding world was compared to the Muggles, it made sense that they approached matters like that of monarchies differently than Muggles did today. He wondered how that little tidbit connected with the information she had discovered that she considered too important to convey in her letter? </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He was pleasantly surprised by the gift that Hermione sent. Knowing her proclivity to amass books of all types, shapes, sizes and topics, he had assumed that she would have naturally bought him a book. But to his immense surprise, she had ordered a Broomstick Servicing Kit for his Nimbus 2000. He definitely owed her a giant hug when he caught up with her on their way to school. It was perfect, including everything that he needed to keep his Nimbus in tiptop shape. Harry cast his thoughts longingly towards his Nimbus, locked with most of his other supplies in the cupboard under the stairs. He couldn't wait to use this on his broom once he got back to Hogwarts! </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Turning his attention to his Hogwarts letter, Harry picked it up with curiosity as he noted absently that it appeared to be thicker and heavier than normal. Slitting the envelope open, Harry pulled out the first page of parchment inside, reading:</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><hr/><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">

How on earth was he going to get any of the Dursleys to sign this form? Hogsmeade sounded incredible. He was aware that it was the only entirely wizarding village in all of Great Britain. He loved the idea of visiting it on the weekends. Dursleys however had a proven track record of taking great pleasure in denying Harry anything that would make him even remotely happy. Who's to say that they wouldn't spit on the form just to spite him even more?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Picking up the final parcel, Harry looked at it carefully. He grinned as he recognized the untidy scrawl of the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Rubeus Hagrid. He had a special place in his heart for Hagrid, seeing as he was the one to finally tell him the truth about his heritage as a wizard after all the years of the Dursleys trying to beat it out of him. He tore off the rough brown paper, just enough to see that it was something that was greyish-brown and leathery. Before he could unwrap it fully, the parcel gave as strange quiver, then whatever it was in there snapped furiously—as if it had jaws.</p><p> </p><p>Harry froze. What on earth could Hagrid have possibly wanted to give him that was able to snap like that? He was sure that whatever it was, Hagrid didn’t consider it dangerous to send to him. The problem was, Hagrid's idea of dangerous was quite a bit different from what other people considered dangerous. Harry decided to errors on the side of caution and wrapped the rough paper around the partially unwrapped- thing. He placed it underneath the loose floorboard and jumped as it rattled around some, before settling down. Clearly this was something better opened away from the Dursleys.</p><p> </p><p>Harry went back to his bed and reached for the card sent by Hagrid.</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

  <strong>Hagrid</strong>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry was a bit worried about what could possibly be useful about a moving and snapping package, but decided to worry about it later. He put Hagrid’s card next to the first two and stared at them all, grinning. His first real birthday presents!</p><p> </p><p>With a happy sigh he looked over at the alarm clock. It was two o’clock in the morning. </p><p> </p><p>Harry took off his glasses and set them aside and laid down on his bed. He would worry about the form later. Maybe during breakfast later in the next few hours. He closed his eyes and began to drift off, counting the days until he would be able to go back to Hogwarts. At the very least, this was an excellent start to his birthday. Not even the Dursleys could spoil it for him…</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>*******</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, as Harry learned later at breakfast that morning, even the best days could be completely ruined by the Dursleys. Harry went downstairs and found the three Dursleys sitting around the kitchen table watching the morning news on their brand new  television which they had purchased for Dudley as a welcome home present following his return from Smeltings, a private school that he attended.</p><p> </p><p>Sitting down at the edge of the table, Harry received his plate from his Aunt Petunia. Looking down at the pitiful food he saw that he had been given a single slice of toast, one thin piece of bacon and a lump of hard cheese. Harry turned his head and spared a look at the plates of his uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley. Both were practically overflowing with a huge mound of bacon, scrambled eggs, and fluffy pancakes. Harry was almost certain, that those plates held their second or even third helpings rather than their first. With a sigh, Harry began to munch on his hard toast.</p><p> </p><p>It was always the same with the Dursleys. None of them greeted him or wished him a happy birthday. He’d never receive so much as a card from any of them. The most he could expect was birthday punches from his horribly obese cousin. They ignored his existence as much as humanly possible.</p><p> </p><p>Harry turned his attention to the news which reported on an escaped convict of some sort who was considered to be a danger to the public safety:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“…The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A special hot line has been set up, and any sighting  of Black should be reported immediately.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Well of course that murderer is no good,” snapped Uncle Vernon as he stared over the top of his newspaper to look at the screen. Look at the state of him, the filthy rotter! Look at his hair!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t miss the glare Uncle Vernon threw at him, or rather, his messy hair which was always a source of aggravation to the man. Ignoring him, Harry took a look at the picture of the escaped criminal.</p><p> </p><p>He was pale and gaunt, with enormous black circles under his eyes and sunken cheeks. His eyes were a dark blue and were filled with anxiety and what to most would be madness, but what seemed to Harry as despair. Looking at those eyes for some reason pulled at Harry’s mind. Those eyes looked so familiar somehow. It was almost like he’d seen them before. Harry shook his head. Murderer he might be, but he somehow felt - sorry for the chap. Still, as he compared his untidy mop to the matted, elbow – length tangle on that man’s head, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.</p><p> </p><p>He blocked out the noise around him as Uncle Vernon cursed at the screen as the news switched over to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and Aunt Petunia, a notable gossip and altogether busybody peered out of the window into the neighbor’s yard—as if a murderer would be hiding out in any house on Privet Drive!</p><p> </p><p>Fantasies of flying on his <em>Nimbus 2000</em> filling his head, Harry vaguely noticed as Uncle Vernon drained his cup of the last swallow of tea, set down his teacup, and glanced over at his watch. “Ah, I’d better get going now Petunia, darling. Marge’s train gets in precisely at ten.”</p><p> </p><p>All thoughts of Quidditch flew out of Harry’s head and dropped back on to earth as his brain caught up to the worst words that could possibly have come out of Uncle Vernon’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Aunt Marge?” blurted out Harry, incredulously. “Surely she’s not coming here is she?”</p><p> </p><p>If there was any one person that Harry despised with all of his heart, it was Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge. She wasn’t related to Harry in any way thankfully, but he’d been forced to endure her cruelty for his entire life. She was the older sister of Uncle Vernon and lived out in the country. She was well to do, making a living of breeding bulldogs. The foul woman was practically a bulldog herself. Harry could never forget the ways Aunt Marge would humiliate him and put him down. Once, during Christmas she gave her precious nephew Dudley a brand new computerized robot. As for Harry? She gave him dog biscuits. Even as late as the year before he received his Hogwarts letter, she had her favorite dog, a rather rotten bulldog named Ripper chase Harry out into the garden and all the way up a tree. All becauseh accidentally stepped on Ripper’s tail. She refused to call off that bloody menace until midnight, much to the entertainment of her nephew, brother and sister-in-law.</p><p> </p><p>Uncle Vernon scowled furiously at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“Marge is coming to spend a week here with us,” he snarled while jabbing a fat finger in Harry’s direction threateningly . “And while we’re on the subject Boy, we need to get some things straight before I go to pick her up.”</p><p> </p><p>The loud volume of his voice was enough to capture the attention of the other two Dursleys  who stopped what they were doing to watch the spectacle. Dudley smirked nastily as he watched his father verbally tear into Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“First,” snapped Uncle Vernon, “you’ll mind your tongue when you’re talking to Marge. And as she’s not aware of your freakishness, you’ll see to it that no—no funny business occurs while she’s here. You’ll watch yourself, understand?”</p><p> </p><p>“I will if she does,” muttered Harry bitterly as he listened to his uncle’s demands. Uncle Vernon of course simply ignored Harry’s response and continued to list his expectations.</p><p> </p><p>“Lastly,” Uncle Vernon continued. “We told Marge that we sent you to St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys-“</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Harry yelled, furiously.</p><p> </p><p>“-And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be trouble,” Uncle Vernon spat out as he glared venomously at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Unable to believe it, Harry sat there staring at Uncle Vernon. Aunt Marge, coming here! This was possibly the worst present of any kind that the Dursleys could have given, even worse than that old pair of Uncle Vernon’s socks.</p><p> </p><p>As if stuck in some kind of a trance, Harry barely noticed Uncle Vernon speaking to Aunt Petunia or Dudley as he sat there contemplating the hell that the upcoming week was going to be like. He sat there like a statue until an idea enter his mind. Quickly he roused himself and rushed after Uncle Vernon who had kissed Petunia goodbye and was at the front door, pulling on his long coat. As Harry approached, Uncle Vernon’s face grew red.</p><p> </p><p>” I’m not taking you anywhere,” he snarled at Harry as he buttoned up his coat.</p><p> </p><p>Harry snorted derisively. “Like I’d want to come,” he said coldly. “I want to ask you something.”</p><p> </p><p>Uncle Vernon paused, eyeing him suspiciously. “Go on,” he grunted.</p><p> </p><p>“At my school, third year students are allowed to go to the local village,” said Harry. “I’d appreciate it if you could sign my permission form.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why in the heavens would I do that?” sneered his uncle.</p><p> </p><p>Harry allowed a smirk to form on his face. “Well,” he said choosing his words carefully, “it’ll probably be hard to pretend to Aunt Marge that I go to that St. Bleecker’s whatsit-“</p><p> </p><p>“St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!” Uncle Vernon bellowed, a look of panic forming on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that one,” Harry said as looked into his uncle’s purpling face. “It seems like rather a lot of work if I have to make it convincing to her. I’d hate to see what would happen if I…accidentally let something slip.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll be beaten within an inch of your life if you don’t you bloody ingrate!” Uncle Vernon growled, as he moved towards Harry with a fist raised high in the air. But Harry, despite the instinctive fear which sprang up at the sight, refused to cower and decided to stay firm. Straight as a board he stood and stared straight at his uncle’s reddened visage.</p><p> </p><p>“Beat me if you dare,” Harry said in as biting a tone as he could, causing Uncle Vernon to stumble to a stop before his anger could escape his control. “But that won’t make Aunt Marge forget what I’d let slip. Accidentally of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Uncle Vernon was completely still now, hand still raised in the air.</p><p> </p><p>“But if you agree to sign this form,” Harry continued quickly, unwilling to lose his advantage, “I’ll see to it that no hint of my – my freakishness will reveal itself in front of her.”</p><p> </p><p>Uncle Vernon bared his teeth in rage as he contemplated Harry’s proposal. Harry knew that while he wasn’t really afraid of Harry, he was deathly afraid the potential chaos that could form if certain parties were to somehow interfere with his sister’s visit.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” he said at last. “I’ll be watching you throughout the week. If you stick to what you were told and keep yourself scarce – I’ll sign your bleeding form.”</p><p> </p><p>Without another word, he pulled open the front door and slammed it firmly as he stomped out to the car.</p><p> </p><p>Breathing hard, hardly believing what had just occurred, Harry didn’t bother to go back to the kitchen to endure his cousin and his aunt. Instead he trudged upstairs and flopped on his bed, drained of all of his energy by that encounter. Slowly he let his gaze rest on the spartan features of his bedroom. It was probably rather fortunate that all of his ‘special’ things were already hidden in a dirty pillowcase underneath the loose floorboard of his bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly a rush of fierce anger flooded Harry and he quickly grabbed his pillow to muffle the sound of him screaming into the thin fabric. Harry screamed out his rage at the news of Marge Dursley’s coming, the shame of having to lie and hide the truth of who he was, simply soaking up the vile invectives that would be hurled against him – why, oh why did he have to come back to this hell, and repeat this every single year?</p><p> </p><p>After what seemed like an eternity to Harry – but in reality only a couple of minutes had passed since he had come in to his room – his anger emptied itself. He felt drained, and terribly heavy. Slowly, he pushed himself up off the bed and trudged over to Hedwig’s cage. Errol, the old family owl of the Weasleys appeared to be in much better health than before; he and Hedwig were both asleep in the cage, heads curled into their wings. With a heavy sigh, Harry poked them both awake. Hedwig screeched as she was awaken, turning her baleful stare upon her master. “Hedwig,” Harry said gloomily, “looks like you’ll have to clear out for a week. Go with Errol. Ron will look after you. I’ll write him a note, and explain. Don’t look at me lie that” – Hedwig’s amber eyes were even more reproachful – “it’s not my fault. It’s the bloody Dursleys. You know how they are. It’s the only way I’ll be able to go to Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.”</p><p> </p><p>Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a hastily scribbled note from Harry explaining the situation bound to her  leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling terribly miserable, stared out after the two dwindling owls as they flew off. A great longing to fly away with them lodged itself in his throat. Knowing that nothing would change, Harry took the empty cage and stored it inside the wardrobe.</p><p> </p><p>Much quicker than Harry would have liked, he heard the high, thin tones of his Aunt Petunia shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come downstairs and get ready to welcome their guest.</p><p> </p><p>“Hurry up you silly boy!” commanded Aunt Petunia shrilly as he trudged unwillingly down the stairs. “And for goodness sake, do something about that wretched hair!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t even bother to respond to her. Grudgingly he made a few, half-hearted swipes against his hair in an effort to get it to lay flat. It didn’t make a difference anyway, he thought resentful as he stared at the door. Marge (he refused to call her ‘Aunt’ in his mind) loved to criticize him at every opportunity. The untidier he looked, the happier she would be.</p><p> </p><p>Far too soon for Harry’s liking, there was the dreaded crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon’s car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, HARRY! Get the door!” Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Reluctantly, a feeling of trepidation settled in his stomach, Harry pulled open the door.</p><p> </p><p>On the threshold stood dear Aunt Marge. She was very similar in appeared to Vernon and Dudley actually: large, beefy, and purple-faced. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked under the other was an old and evil – tempered little beast of a bulldog, her precious Ripper.</p><p> </p><p>“Where’s my lovely Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge. “Where’s my neffy-poo?”</p><p> </p><p>Out waddled Dudley from the kitchen, his blond hair plastered flat on his fat head, a bow tie barely visible under the wobbly chins. With a grunt, Marge shoved the suitcase into Harry, knocking him a few steps back, and marched over to her only nephew, seizing him in a tight one-armed hug, planting a large kiss on his cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Harry scoffed silently at the stomach–turning scene. He knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with those nauseating displays because he would be well compensated for his efforts. Sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley was clutching a crisp twenty-pound note in his meaty fist.</p><p> </p><p>“Petunia!” cried Aunt Marge, sweeping past Harry with nary a glance. “You look lovely as always!” Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia exchanged kisses, or rather, Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia’s bony cheekbone.</p><p> </p><p>Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door. “Tea, Marge?” he said. “And what will Ripper take?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,” said Aunt Marge as the Dursleys proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry the burden of lugging Aunt Marge’s large suitcase all the way upstairs to the guest bedroom. But Harry didn’t mind at all. Any reason to avoid having any contact with that repulsive woman for a moment was welcomed by Harry. Slowly, Harry began the arduous task of heaving the heavy case upstairs into the guest room.</p><p> </p><p>By the time he made his way down to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been well-supplied with tea and fruitcake. Ripper was lapping away noisily in the corner. Harry noted Aunt Petunia’s winces as specks of tea and dog drool made its way unto her clean floors. Aunt Petunia hated animals.</p><p> </p><p>“Who’s looking after the other dogs while you’re here, Marge?” Uncle Vernon asked as he sipped at his tea.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I got old Colonel Fubster managing them,” said Aunt Marge. “He’s retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn’t leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he’s away from me.”</p><p> </p><p>The aforementioned dog began to growl as Harry sat down at the table. At the sound, Aunt Marge looked up, eyes narrowing as she cast her gaze at Harry, focusing on his bed of untidy hair.</p><p> </p><p>“So!” she barked. “Still here, are you?”</p><p> </p><p>At the sound of her caustic, derisive tone, Harry glared openly at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Harry muttered behind clenched teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” growled Aunt Marge. “It’s damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn’t have done it myself. You’d have gone straight to an orphanage if you’d been left on my doorstep.”</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t news to Harry. In fact, he knew very well that if steps hadn’t been taken by his headmaster Albus Dumbledore to ensure that he could stay, the first thing Aunt Petunia would have done was dump him in some distant orphanage. He wanted nothing more than to say that he’d rather live in an orphanage than with the Dursleys, but then he remembered his deal with Uncle Vernon, and he restrained himself. He forced his face into a painful smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge. "I can see that you’re just as wretched as the last time I laid eyes on you. I hoped school would knock some decency and manners into you.” She paused to take in a great swallow of tea, before turning towards her brother. “Where is it you’ve sent him to, again Vernon?”</p><p> </p><p>“St. Brutus’s.” Uncle Vernon replied promptly. “It’s a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.”</p><p> </p><p>“I see,” said Aunt Marge. “Do they give out beatings at St. Brutus’s, boy?” she barked across the table.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry hesitated, but saw the frown and curt nod that Uncle Vernon gave him behind his sister’s back. He figured it’d be safest to just go with her assumption.</p><p> </p><p>“Er, yes,” said Harry. “All the time.”</p><p> </p><p>Aunt Marge gave a grunt of satisfaction. “Excellent,” she said. “I won’t put up with this namby-pamby, wishy-washy sentiment that’s spreading around these days about not beating the people who deserve it. A good thrashing is what’s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have you been beaten often?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, ” said Harry, as sincerely as he could. “Loads of times.”</p><p> </p><p>His response only served to cause Aunt Marge to narrow her eyes suspiciously .</p><p> </p><p>“I still don’t like your tone, boy,” she said darkly. “If you can speak of your beatings so flippantly, then it’s clear that their being too lenient on you. Petunia dear,” she turned towards her sister-in-law, “I’d write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force.”</p><p> </p><p>Abruptly, Vernon decided to change the topic. “Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner, eh?”</p><p> </p><p>And that was the start of the week of hell, as Harry considered it. Aunt Marge went out of her way to make Harry as miserable as it possible to be. She would insist that Harry stay near her at all times, so she could boom out suggestions for his ‘improvement’. She made a point of comparing Harry with Dudley and belittling him. She delighted in buying Dudley expensive presents and daring Harry to complain about receiving nothing in return. Often, it took real effort for Harry to avoid flying into a rage whenever she would insult him. Only the thought of being able to join Ron and Hermione kept him civil.</p><p> </p><p>However by the third day of her visit, Harry found himself beginning to crack.</p><p> </p><p>It was lunch time, and while the Dursleys were eating, Aunt Marge was constantly throwing out dark innuendos about what made Harry such an unsatisfactory person.</p><p> </p><p>“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out, Vernon, ” she was saying halfway through their meal. “If there’s something rotten on the inside, there’s nothing anyone can do about it.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt anger flare in him as he tried to focus his  attention on the meager portion on his plate. He tried to hold his fork, but had to set it down as his hands began to shake. <em>Keep yourself calm</em>, he told himself. <em>Remember the form, think about Hogsmeade. Don’t say anything. Don’t give that woman the satisfaction –</em></p><p> </p><p>“It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said while grasping her glass of wine. “You see it all the time with dogs. If there’s something wrong with the bitch, there’s something wrong with the pup -"</p><p> </p><p>At that caustic jab, the rage in Harry spiked, and at that moment, the wine glass Aunt Marge was holding shattered in her hand. Shards of glass flew every which way. Uncle Vernon blanched, and Aunt Petunia shrieked. Dudley just focused on stuffing his face while watching the television. Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.</p><p> </p><p>“Marge!” squealed Aunt Petunia. “Marge, are you all right?”</p><p> </p><p>“No need to fuss Petunia,” Aunt Marge said while mopping her face with a handkerchief. “I have a very firm grip. Why just the other day I did the same thing while having tea with Colonel Fubster. I must have squeezed it too hard…”.</p><p> </p><p>Harry used the fracas as a distraction to skip out on dessert. Escaping from the table under Uncle Vernon’s pointed glare, he went quickly to his room and shut the door. He paced back and forth, replaying the scene that just took place downstairs. As those poisonous words rang through his head, his anger got the best of him again and he furiously kicked the foot of his bed, before throwing himself on it with a yell.</p><p> </p><p><em>How dare she</em>, he thought furiously.<em> How dare that – that monster say anything like that about Mum. Bitch? She’s the bloody bitch!</em></p><p> </p><p>As he lay on the bed, all his anger and hatred drained away and was replaced by a wave of fear that spread through him as he thought about what he’d just done. It had been a long time since he’d lost control like that. He couldn’t afford to make a mistake like that again. It wasn’t just the Hogsmeade form that was at stake – if he carried on like that, he’d be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic.</p><p> </p><p>He was still underage, and it was against the law of the Ministry to do magic outside of school. He’d already had a close call last summer when he’d gotten an official warning that stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive, Harry would face expulsion from Hogwarts. That was the last thing he wanted. Hogwarts was the closest thing that Harry had to a real home. If he he was expelled, what would happen to him then?</p><p> </p><p>On that uncomfortable note, Harry shoved all thoughts of expulsions and Ministry warnings from his mind and tried to focus on nothing as the birds chirped in the tree outside his window. He wished -oh how he wished- that somehow, he could escape from this wretched place!  If he could only leave, he’d be the happiest person alive. But, it didn’t seem like a wish that would come true for several more weeks.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>*******</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Little did Harry know however that at that very moment, his sudden burst of magic had been noticed. Not by the Ministry of Magic, no. Nor by any of the staff of Hogwarts—for the Headmaster was currently in Switzerland at that moment, tackling a series of startling pieces of legislation that promised nothing good for his agenda. No, it was noticed by a man writing in an expensive leather-bound book many kilometers away in a small, but well furnished room in a rather dingy looking pub located in mundane and magical London.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <strong>August 2, 2003</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>For Milton Ashcroft, returning to Magical Britain, or Albion as those who were more cognizant of the old days tended to refer to the Isles as, was a mixture of nostalgic pleasure and bitter memories.</p><p> </p><p>He had been born here, naturally, and grown up in the environs of Scotland. He had enjoyed a happy childhood, studying at Hogwarts like so many of his ancestors had in the decades past and made many close friendships that endured to this day. </p><p> </p><p>This was also the place that held both his greatest joy, and his greatest sorrow, for here he had met his closest and most intimate friend and distant kinsman for the first time. </p><p> </p><p>Setting the quill to the side, he sighed as he considered the bittersweet memories of the times they had spent in each other's company, having all sorts of adventures and exploring all sorts of fascinating things. </p><p> </p><p><em>Oh Charlus</em>, he thought wistfully as he recalled the past, <em>if only you and Dorea could be here now...</em></p><p> </p><p>Charlus Potter had been his confidante, his shield-brother, his everything. They had explored together, played together, loved together and fought together when the Great War broke out, just as World War II began in earnest. He had been the best man at his wedding to his betrothed, Dorea Black and had celebrated when the couple after decades of marriage had celebrated the birth of their first-born son, James Ignotus Potter. He had followed the growth of their family closely whenever he could spare attention from his responsibilities as Headmaster of Ilvermony, and in 1977, the year of their tragic murders at the hands of unknown assailants, he had been entrusted with a sacred responsibility—their greatest secret...</p><p> </p><p>That secret, he had kept safe and secure from all, even their eldest boy himself. Admittedly, he had withdrawn somewhat from James, as tensions grew throughout the Isles and even across the Atlantic as the terrorist and self-proclaimed Lord Voldemort began amassing his network of spies, assassins and supporters and began making incursions in America. He had been compelled to take on the mantle of Minister of the Eastern Territories while simultaneously serving as Headmaster of Ilvermony, and caring for the secret he still kept hidden from the British magical world. </p><p> </p><p>And then, thirteen years later, he lost any opportunity to repair the strained ties with James as he and his good wife, Lily became the last victims of the murderous reign of Lord Voldemort, only for the madman himself to die at the hands of their infant son—Charlus' grandson—Harry Potter. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes he wondered what became of that child, who was credited with the miraculous defeat of the one who would have successfully overthrown the magical government of the British Isles. He naturally attempted to gain access to the babe, but he was whisked away mysteriously and taken into hiding—where, no one knew. Since then, all that was known of him was what Albus shared during reports on the major matters of state concerning Britain. </p><p> </p><p>At times, he wondered if the babe—well, the young man had anything of his grandfather, his beloved friend Charlus in him...</p><p> </p><p>Shaking off the maudlin thoughts, he focused on the detailed notes that he had been scribbling in his records book. As nostalgic as it was to visit his old stomping grounds, he was here on business of a most serious nature. </p><p> </p><p>The past spring had brought about a series of startling changes to the status of the educational facilities that fell under the auspices of the International Confederation of Wizards' Education Secretariat. As one of the leading Mugwumps with the Secretariat, Milton had nevertheless decided to take a hands off approach to the critical piece of legislation that concerned the Secretariat; the International Curricular Acceptance Protocol (ICAP), a series of reforms designed to affect all major institutions that were connected to ICW-member nations, due to the inconsistent standards in the respective countries and the graduates of those institutions (particularly First-Generation magicians) having to take years of remedial instruction in order to qualify for advanced studies or for apprenticeships internationally. It was expected that under the ICAP legislation, schools would adopt a common standard in instruction quality and in the standardized testing that would be required of all students in order to move on to more advanced studies. With a common base for evaluation, they would then be able to apply for apprenticeships or advanced studies or other forms of employment and have a fairly equal shot at gaining said opportunity, regardless of where their schooling took place. </p><p> </p><p>To be sure, Milton supported the legislation and had endorsed it before the Council. Nevertheless, he left those battles to others; for he was focused on perfecting the curriculum that he would use for his own educational project: The Picquery Institute for Young Scholars. It was a project that he had long had plans for, ever since his marriage to the former President of the Magical Congress of the United States, Seraphina Picquery. In the early years of their marriage after the Great War had settled, the two of them would often discuss the events in the 20s that precipitated the crisis that ultimately culminated in the War against the forces of Grindlewald. His dear Seraphina often expressed regret over the consequences of her decisive, but ill-advised decision to order her Aurors to attack and destroy the Obscurial that had nearly exposed magic to the No-Maj community, which prompted the pair to devise an institution that would cater specifically to special cases like Obscurials, or other types of indviduals who were somehow afflicted with a magical inheritance due to contact with a magical creature or being, an inheritance that would more likely stir the alarm of the magical community and their law enforcers who might judge the poor souls a threat and seek to imprison or elliminate them. </p><p> </p><p>After his retirement from his post as President of MACUSA, and Minister for Magic over the Eastern Colonies of Albion, it became his focus to make the dream that he and his dearly departed wife had conceived decades ago a living reality. </p><p> </p><p>It had been a long road to get the approval of MACUSA and more importantly, the ICW; but in the end, he and his small but growing staff had accomplished their purpose and now stood on the cusp of opening their doors to their inaugural class. They were hoping for no more than fifty, but were prepared to house twice that amount if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>Just around that time, the Educational Secretariat—despite stiff opposition by the faction of supporters stirred up by the current Supreme Mugwump of the ICW—announced the successful passage of the ICAP Act, and sent a delegation to the site of the Picquery Institute to speak to him personally and lobby for his assistance concerning a series of sensitive political maneuvers that would have to take place in order to get the legislation ratified by Magical Britain. </p><p> </p><p>The trouble that now threatened the success of the ICAP Act was the personal influence of the Supreme Mugwump; for not only did he lead the Mugwump Council, but he was also the Chief Warlock of Albion Proper's Wizengamot, and the Headmaster of the institution that above all would determine the future of the legislation in the Isles, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. </p><p> </p><p>With his control over the school, the proponents of the Act were very much aware that it would be next to impossible for the Act to be implemented with any degree of success—unless, someone with a similar political pedigree, enough pull over the Wizengamot and ability to dismantle whatever resistance Dumbledore would be able to cobble together in the Ministry of Magic and enough experience as an educator and administrator to ensure that the Act was fully implemented and proved successful within the halls of the oldest magical institution in Western Europe, would volunteer. </p><p> </p><p>With such a necessary portfolio, it left him as the only viable candidate to push the Act through. </p><p> </p><p>He resisted the request from the Secretariat initially, of course. There were too many important details to focus on with regards to the Picquery Institute; but as the calls for his involvement grew more strident, Milton found himself relenting to the pressure of his colleagues. He knew full well that there was no one else that had the political capital to potentially tangle with an uncooperative and possibly hostile Chief Warlock and Headmaster as well as the Minister for Magic himself.</p><p> </p><p>Delegating the rest of the details left to be finalized for the school in the hands of his two children, both of whom were in the States, he acceded to the demands of the Secretariat and subsequently received the commission as the special envoy of the ICW, authorized to oversee the observations of the educational facilities in Albion Proper, represent the official voice of the ICW during the ratification process, and implement the necessary changes in each of the institutions.</p><p> </p><p>The hope was that with the clear sanction of the ICW behind him, coupled with his own political influence as the senior-most (if long absent) Lord of the Wizengamot and his reputation as the former President of MACUSA and Minister for the Eastern Territories of Albion and experience as the Headmaster-Emeritus of Ilvermony that he would be able to ensure the ratification of the ICAP Act, despite whatever measures Dumbledore and his allies might take to torpedo it in the Wizengamot or blunt its impact on the way Hogwarts was currently run. </p><p> </p><p>As such, three days before, he returned to the shores of his native land for the first time in over twelve years—for the last time he had visited the Isles had been to escort his son to Wales to pay their respects to the late Lord and Lady Potter...</p><p> </p><p>In that time, he focused on settling housekeeping issues with regards to his estate holdings in Scotland that his son had been unable to care for during his last business trip to Britain, and re-acquainting himself with some of the old stomping grounds that he had been fond of in his youth. </p><p> </p><p>Now, he focused on preparing a viable strategy to force the cooperation of the Hogwarts Board of Governors as several interviews and extensive correspondence painted a picture of gross neglect and counter intuitive policies that appeared to find their source in Lucius Malfoy, the Marquess of Leinnsfeld, and the leader of the faction of blood purists that bedeviled the broader Traditionalist bloc within the Wizengamot. </p><p> </p><p>He had already paid a visit to the Chief Governor to inform him that he would be reclaiming his ancestral seat on the Board of Governors and informing him of the wisdom of cooperating with the ICW with regards to the ICAP. Based on his last letter, the head of the Board had seen the wisdom of partnering with the ICW, preparing the authorization that would establish him as the Board's Observer of the current status of Hogwarts' program and staff. He was pleased to hear that the governor was also fully prepared to make a few changes to the staffing of the school, changes that Milton and made adamantly clear must be made regardless of whether the ratification of the ICAP Act passed or not. He was looking forward to their upcoming meeting with Headmaster Dumbledore in the next couple of weeks, when these changes would be announced. While Lucius and a few others would kick up their heels and potentially mount disputes over the additional staff and changes to the curriculum, Milton was confident that, with his assumption of the Ashcroft seat upon the Board of Governors, and with the support of Governors that he intended to replace the Ministry yes-men who had capitulated so shamefully to Lord Malfoy's insidious machinations during the previous school term, many changes would be made that would make the greater changes that the ICAP Act would force upon the school more palatable to both staff and student body. </p><p> </p><p>Setting his quill down, Milton leaned back in his chair and sighed as he contemplated the dances that would be taking place over the next several days, when he stiffened, as a flare of powerful wild magic abruptly manifested. Shocked, Milton sat still as the waves of magic washed over him. Closing his eyes, Milton took a deep breath and, concentrating on a wavelength that few, even among magicians could consciously access, allowed his ethereal form to leave his body and speed towards the source of the magical manifestation. As the bright magic drew his spectral form in, he found himself traveling rapidly in the southwestern direction. As mile after mile separating his physical body from the locus of the manifestation began to close, the energy he was tracing began to fade. Urging his astral form on, Milton raced towards the southwest of London, doing his best to keep a hold of the rapidly fading energy. He was disappointed however, as just as he closed in on the area of Surrey, the trail went cold—but not before the accomplished Adept, flinging tendrils of his own magic into the fading magic, caught a glimpse of a young face and brilliant green eyes. With a shake of his head, Milton let go and allowed his astral self to be drawn back to his physical body, grunting as the disorienting sensation of sinking back into flesh rocked his senses. After a few moments, he opened his eyes and brought one black gloved finger to his forehead, as he centered himself. After he felt relatively stable, Milton opened his eyes again. Releasing a deep breath, he looked out of the enchanted window to the sights of London, but he didn't register anything outside of the window. </p><p> </p><p>The flare up of magic was concentrated thirty miles or so southwest of London. Most likely somewhere in the Surrey area, though a specific locality remained elusive to him. Most intriguing however, was the fact that the source of that manifestation was a young man with green eyes apparently, who was in distress and not fully in control of his burgeoning powers. Was he a student of one of the magical schools that existed in Albion Proper? Or had he somehow been missed by those institutions, powers remaining latent until some distressing event triggered them? Could he possibly be a potential candidate for the Picquery Institute? </p><p> </p><p>“You are quite powerful young one,” said Milton quietly to himself, a pair of ice blue eyes staring out to a sight only he could see. “The time will soon come when you and I must have a little chat.”</p><p> </p><p>With a twitch of his fingers, the thick, wooden door separating his room from the hallway opened. He began to whistle, a soft melody that rang with ancient memory. No sooner had he ceased the tune, when a great black raven with dark crimson tipped wings flew in, settling on the man’s left shoulder. Reaching a wrinkled hand to caress the bird, the man spoke softly, but urgently. Utilizing the long cultivated bond that tied him to his trusted familiar, he shared the memory of his spirit flight with the raven, emphasizing in their communication the need of finding the young man behind that burst of magic. </p><p> </p><p>“A young one has been found, my dear Bran. It appears that situation might be direr than I thought. There was a strange flux of energy in the area. Something is not right.” He turned his head to face that of the raven. They stared at each other, and Bran began to caw, tilting his head. Milton nodded solemnly at the bird, for he knew what it was communicating. The bird squawked loudly and began to flap its wings. It left its perch and flapped its wings some more as it flew in a circle around Milton's head. Then with one last musical croak, the raven flew out of the door. The man sat there quietly, as he listened to sounds that no other ear could hear.</p><p> </p><p> “Soon.” he whispered to the air. An unexpected mystery, but one that he had every intention of pursuing to the end. </p>
