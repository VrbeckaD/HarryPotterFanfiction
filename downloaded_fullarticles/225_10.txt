    <p>Remus Lupin felt much older than his 15 years as he made his way along the Hogwarts express. It had been an intense full moon a few nights before and he was really looking forward to finishing up his prefect rounds. Only a few more compartments to check. As he reached the final compartment, the door opened and Marlene McKinnon stepped out. Before she noticed Remus, she slumped against the door, pulling a muggle cigarette out of her pocket and lighting up. Remus sighed and once again wondered why he had been made a Prefect when he absolutely hated confrontation. McKinnon looked up noticing Remus for the first time.</p><p>“Oh don’t start Lupin” she said leaning further back into the wall. “You let Black get away with a lot worse.”</p><p>“Why does everyone think I have any control over what Sirius does?”</p><p>She shrugged “well you have more control than most.” She took a drag of her cigarette as Remus came to stand opposite her. </p><p>“I just needed a bit of a break from my friends – you know?” Marlene offered unprompted. Remus hummed in response. He understood. After last year, Remus understood all too well. </p><p> </p><p>He hadn’t actually seen his fellow Marauders since stepping on the train. Well he had technically seen Sirius, along with everyone else on the platform. Sirius Black had arrived at the station dressed in full wizarding robes. Yet the second he took a step onto the train itself he turned pulling out his wand, looked his parents straight in the eye, and transformed his clothes into a tight pair of black jeans and black muggle t-shirt. Most parents would be impressed that their child was that accomplished at transfiguration. Orion Black was not most parents, and looked decidedly unimpressed at his eldest son’s actions. Remus dreaded to think what was in store for Sirius when he returned home for Christmas break. It was a nice piece of magic in Remus’s opinion. Completely pointless of course as Sirius would need to change into his school robes not long after, but Remus did understand Sirius’s desire to use magic as soon as he possibly could. Undoubtedly, the restrictions placed on underage wizards doing magic outside of school had been brought in by one of Sirius’s ancestors, after a long school holidays being stuck at home with a children like Sirius Black and James Potter.  </p><p> </p><p>“All good down my end.” Remus turned to smile at his fellow prefect Lily Evans as she approached. She quirked an eyebrow at Marlene “is Dorcas talking about Roly again?” Marlene grimaced and nodded. </p><p>“I really can’t sodding take it any more Lils. She just goes around and round driving herself mad about this guy. And if I say anything negative about him she just says that I don’t get him. I mean hell Lily I don’t want to fight with her the first day back. Not while she also has that prick to deal with.” Lily gave her a sympathetic look, then raised her eyebrow at Remus. </p><p>“You know Marls, Remus here is a really good listener.” Marlene looked up at that and smirked. Stubbing out her cigarette under her boot, she slung an arm around Remus’s shoulder. </p><p>“Mmm Lily good idea.” Remus looked at the two girls sceptically. They held his gaze expectantly. Remus really wasn’t very good at saying no to people. He sighed. </p><p>“You want me to sit and listen to Dorcas then?”</p><p>“It would be darling if you could Remus?”</p><p>“And what? Give her dating advice?” They did realise that Remus only had limited dating experience right? He had been on a couple of dates over the past year and they had not ended well.</p><p>“Yep and preferably tell her to give Roly the shove.” Before Remus could protest Marlene opened the door to the compartment, grabbed his wrist and pulled him in behind her. Alice and Dorcas were sitting inside, Dorcas talking intensely. Alice was nodding along but her eyes were glazed over.</p><p>“Guess who finished their prefect rounds!” Marlene chirped while Remus waved awkwardly, taking a seat next to Dorcas.</p><p>“Hey Alice, want to come find the trolley?” Lily, subtle as ever, jumped in “I could really do with a sugar fix after having to face Potter already today.”</p><p>“Sure” Alice jumped up quickly to follow Lily and Marlene out of the carriage. Remus really wanted to know what James Potter had done to already have Lily offside, but the three girls had already shut the door and were hurrying down the corridor, leaving Remus and Dorcus alone. Remus had always liked Dorcas. In fact, he had a crush of her for most of first and second year. So had most of the other Gryffindor boys their age it turned out, after a very revealing game of truth or dare one night in third year.</p><p>“So how was your break?” Remus tried. Dorcas sighed.</p><p>“I’m guessing you know about it since the girls dragged you in here and then bolted.” Remus turned to her, catching her dark blue eyes. </p><p>“They only told me a little” he said softly. Dorcas sighed again.</p><p>“I know they are sick of hearing about my drama, but it’s not like I can talk to my mum or dad about it. I’m not even meant to date until I turn sixteen so I have to keep Roly and I a secret.” Remus knew how hard it was to keep a secret from parents. He had spent the past summer trying his hardest to pretend that he was fine. Pretending that he still trusted Sirius, after the disastrous last few months of their fifth year. </p><p>“Although” Dorcas continued “not going to lie, there is something sexy about sneaking out to meet him, and sneaking him in when mums out.” </p><p>Remus snorted. “I bet.” In reality, he thought he would find it incredibly stressful to have to sneak in someone past his parents. The summer of fourth year James had shown up unexpectedly at the Lupin’s small cottage when Remus was grounded. Remus still had stress dreams of his father coming home unexpectedly and finding James hidden under his bed. Still, he needed Dorcas to keep talking so tried to sound like it was something he would find exciting and not an added stress to his already anxiety-filled life as a young werewolf. “But – there has to be more to it than that, I mean for you to stay with him?”</p><p>“Well it’s not like we are always together.” Dorcas mused. “Like we break up a lot… five times over the last year. He called it off the last time, but I’ve dumped him a couple of times as well. I think he is winning though because he has called it off three times and I’ve only broken up with him twice.” She looked thoughtfully up at the ceiling of the carriage. “Plus he definitely broke up with me the last time…so yeah….he is winning. But then he owled me a week ago and said how sorry he was and invited me out for a picnic. We kissed, and now I guess we are back together.” </p><p>“Dorc....” Remus understood immediately why the girls wanted to shake Dorcas. Still, they had trusted him to give her some good advice so he couldn’t let all his frustration show. Why? He still wasn’t sure. “I don’t want to immediately say you should break up with him, but you should break up with him. You are so smart, funny and amazing. You deserve to be with someone who, oh I don’t know, hasn’t dumped you three times and thinks its ok to just brush past it with a kiss and a picnic.” Dorcas sighed in frustrated and put her head in her hands. </p><p>“It’s not like that” she whined. Remus was used to whining, having shared a dorm room with Sirius Black for the last few years, and knew exactly how to deal with it. </p><p>“Okay” he said patiently. “How about you tell me about each break up?”</p><p>“Well the first time we had been together for three months. We had snogged a bit, but hadn’t done anything really, and then he decided we didn’t talk enough or have enough in common or some bollocks like that and called it off via owl.”</p><p>“Gutless bastard.”</p><p>“Oh he always does it via owl. I don’t really mind, probably less painful all round that way. Anyway, then we got back together a little while later. He’d said sorry and we were together for a little longer. Then….” Dorcas trailed off, looking lost in thought. She giggled to herself. “You know I genuinely don’t know why he dumped me that time. It was definitely him calling it off, but I really can’t remember why. The third time was certainly me. We had just gotten back together and then my Grandma died really suddenly and I just couldn’t deal with him and that you know?” </p><p>Remus did know. His own Grandma had died just before he had begun at Hogwarts and the loss of someone who had cared for him, no matter his condition, had rocked his world. Never being particularly good with physical contact he awkwardly patted Dorcas on the knee, urging her to continue. </p><p>“So then came make up and break up four, which was me again. Oh right, that was the one that happened over Easter break. Roly had invited me to go camping with him and his cousins. He wanted to show off to them that he had a girlfriend. But while we were there we got to talking and he mentioned that he didn’t think what we had was…you know….real.” She was starting to get upset now, gulping back tears before continuing. “He thought we were just making out, and not really together, and I’m not like that. So I just left the campsite. Ran off and stayed in a muggle hotel for a night. Um then the last time it was because he thought he wanted to try going out with someone else. One of his Ravenclaw friends. But that didn’t work and he said sorry and now here we are.” </p><p>“Wow Dorc.” Remus started, trying to compose his thoughts, and not just scream – dump him, dump him now. “I mean do you really want to be with someone who keeps dumping you for stupid insensitive reasons? Like both times you ended it were for really good reasons, and it is so gutsy to just walk out and go to a muggle hotel for a night. And he just really keeps thinking all he has to do is apologise after being an arse and he gets to go back to being with someone as amazing as you?” </p><p>Dorcas was beginning to really cry now. “You don’t get it.” She choked in between sobs. “He is my first love, if you don’t marry your first love you are a failure.” Remus was stunned. </p><p>“Dorc, who told you that?” She shook her head, unable to speak. “Because you know it’s utter shite right?”</p><p>“I know” she said softly. “But I just wanted my own fairy tale.” </p><p>“I get it, I do.” How often had wished for a fairy tale ending for his own lycanthropy. Meeting someone who would just magically cure him. “But does this feel like a fairy tale? It seems like a lot of drama, and not a lot of happily ever after. You should be kind to yourself, and let go of the idea of him as your first love. Focus instead of the arsehole he truly is.”</p><p>Dorcas snorted, and Remus smiled. “Thanks.” She said softly. “I think I’m ready to let him go.”</p><p>“Fuck, yes!” Marlene burst through the door, that she, Lily and Alice had clearly been listening through. “You should dump him spectacularly. Make up for all the shit he put you through.” </p><p>“No.” Remus jumped in. “You should just send one line telling him it’s over, with no explanation. It will drive him mad trying to work out why.” </p><p>Lily gasped. “That’s perfect Remus!” She turned to Marlene. “Didn’t I tell you he would be amazing?” The three girls settled back into the carriage, sharing treats gathered from the trolley. </p><p>“Yes, not bad Lupin. I’m impressed.” Marlene replied, sucking on a gummy worm. Remus snorted. </p><p>“So glad you approve, McKinnon.” </p><p>“We saw your boys by the way. Looks like they are pretty bored without you. Black was asleep.” Remus wasn’t surprised. Sirius didn’t often sleep over the summer and needed to catch-up on the train ride back to Hogwarts. This led to a fun first week back every year when the other three Marauders had to drag Sirius out of bed to make sure he made it to class. </p><p>“I’m sure they’ll live.” Remus watched as Alice settled Dorcas, and missed the glance Marlene shot Lily. </p><p>“So…” Lily began “Remus…”</p><p>“Since you did such a fucking great job in helping out Dorcas” Marlene cut in. </p><p>“Thanks, by the way” Dorcas chimed in from where she was still snuggled against Alice’s shoulder. </p><p>“No problem” Remus replied, shooting her a smile. </p><p>“Mmhmm” Lily shot them all her best prefect look. She really was born to be in charge. “As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, Remus we have a proposition for you.”</p><p>“First time I’ve ever been propositioned” Remus counted. Marlene snorted. </p><p>“You must have seen the drivel the Daily Prophet printed over the summer” Lily continued, pretending she hadn’t been interrupted. “It is just printing ignorant fluff, while serious stories go unreported. That doesn’t just impact muggleborns but ignorance infects all of the wizarding community.” Remus was impressed with Lily’s passion. He agreed of course but he normally chanelled his frustration at the Prophet’s awful reporting into snippy, sarcastic comments.  “So, we are going to start our own student paper, that tells the real stories Hogwarts students should know about.” They were all grinning excitedly at him now. </p><p>“We’ve thought about it all summer” Alice said “and we have come up with a half decent plan.” </p><p>“But as much as we hate to admit it, you Marauders have some skills we just don’t have” Marlene smirked. “And that’s why we would like you on board.”</p><p>“Behind the scenes” Lily quickly jumped in “you wouldn’t be as publicly involved as the rest of us.” Remus was grateful. Lily, being as smart as she was, had worked out his ‘furry little secret’ in Third Year. She knew that Remus had to be careful and couldn’t get into too much trouble. She also knew that he was the brains behind most of the Marauder’s most successful pranks. So was happy to flirt with trouble, as long as he stayed in the background. </p><p>“And that’s why we thought you would be our perfect Agony Aunt!” Marlene grinned. “Well that, and your advice is pretty solid.” </p><p>“We thought we should have an Agony Aunt” Alice chimed in “because it will get us some extra readers. Especially amongst the younger students.” </p><p>“So, you in?” Marlene asked. They were all looking at him expectantly now. Was he in? He thought it was a good idea, of course. The Prophet was a pile of garbage, and the girls would do a great job at reporting things that mattered. The Slytherins would hate it and there would be backlash, but he wasn’t afraid of that. He did sort of like the idea that he could offer good advice. He had given advice to Peter, but that hadn’t always turned out well. James normally ignored his advice, especially when it was about Lily, saying he preferred to ‘trust his gut’. And Sirius. Well Sirius had proven last year that he was incapable of taking any advice. What Remus liked best though was that he would have a secret from the other Marauders. Something that was just his. A secret within a secret. He had shared everything with them, something he never thought he would do. And then Sirius Black had taken that, and stomped all over it with his black Doc Martins. Remus had said he had forgiven him, and he had a little. But not fully, and he didn’t think he ever really could. He felt himself withdrawing and wanting to hide things from Sirius. Having something special that was his and not the rest of the Marauders felt like some sort of revenge. Sirius would be hurt when he eventually found out, but Remus wanted him to hurt. Not seriously hurt, but this petty hurt felt like it would be satisfying. It was this thought that made him want to be part of their paper. Not that he was going to admit that to Lily or the others.  </p><p>Remus nodded. </p><p>“Fabulous!” Lily clapped in excitement “now we just have to come up with the perfect name.”</p>
