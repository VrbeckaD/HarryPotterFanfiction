He had been home over the last five years but he hadn’t been in the bookshop since just before his first tour with The Avenue. He never wanted the Lupin’s shop overrun with mad fans of the band, though it would have been great for business. They did just fine without him though but he’d be willing to boost their sales if needed. There was also a lot of history in those stacks that he was a bit nervous to dust off.</p><p>Oh, you don’t know The Avenue? That’s weird but let’s catch you up because it’s sort of necessary to this story. They were the hottest boyband in the history of boy bands. Sirius was the hot one with the best hair. He was also the most talented one but he never agreed with people or thought that out loud because he wasn’t arrogant. The Avenue made millions, sold out stadium after stadium, had an unbelievable amount of streams on all the services, sold out CDs, sold out merchandise, and made young people scream the brains out for them. Their fan following was gigantic and intense. They were the tops. Then Gilderoy got even more of an ego than he already had and left the band to strike it out on his own. From what Sirius could gather striking it out on his own meant partying and dating a model.</p><p>After Gilderoy left Sirius, Kingsley, Frank, and Benjy all agreed to finish the last album and do one last tour for their fans. It was also in their contract, so there weren’t many ways round it. While they were doing that, Kingsley was already working on a solo album, and Frank had got a reality star pregnant. Benjy was also thinking about what his next venture would be, in the end, he turned to acting. Sirius, on the other hand, didn’t worry about the future the whole final go. Nor did he think about it for a solid month after the tour finished. It wasn’t until about two weeks ago that he was itching to get back in the studio. He had nearly his whole team ready to go on a writing retreat for two months on some beautiful Caribbean island but he was missing one thing.</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t the pop star. Finally coming back to your roots, eh?” Lyall was behind the counter.</p><p>“Hilarious, Lyall. Is Remus round?” Remus, who used to be his partner in musical crime until Sirius tried out for X Factor. Sirius sometimes wondered if Remus was angry that Sirius went off and got famous without him. Remus never showed any sort of signs of jealousy but they had made plans when they were younger. Things got all mixed up but now there was some opportunity.</p><p>“Oh, John! Paul’s here!” Lyall shouted the old joke to his son who was somewhere in the bookstore.</p><p>“Never gets old, Lyall.” Sirius laughed as he heard something drop then Remus swear. “I’ll go find him.”</p><p>“Better off, he’s mad at you anyway. Keep your arguing in the back of the store. Bad for business.”</p><p>“Mad at me? Whatever for?” Sirius pouted. There was probably a laundry list of reasons for Remus to be mad at him but Sirius always managed to have the other man forgive him.</p><p>Lyall just rolled his eyes before going back to his computer. He was probably taking care of inventory or orders.</p><p>“Marco!” Sirius yelled.</p><p>“Polo, you bastard,” Remus said. “I’m in science fiction.” He said loud enough for Sirius to hear him.</p><p>The singer made his way through the stacks, passing only two older people who didn’t seem to notice him. He found Remus in the corner picking up a few books from the floor. He was wearing skinny olive jeans with the bottoms turned up and a plain yellow y-neck. His curls were a bit everywhere but Sirius thought it fitted for Remus. “Drop something?” Sirius gave a little smile.</p><p>“No, my dad was saying that you were here so I threw the books to the ground to come run and sweep you up in the hug then I decided that I shouldn’t leave the books here for Gladys and Nina to trip over.”</p><p>“You always were concerned about the customer.” Sirius leaned back against the shelves behind him admiring the dimples that were visible when he smiled (even if that smile was sarcastic as it was in the moment) and his beautiful hazel eyes. Yes, Sirius fancied Remus. He had since they were about twelve and that hadn’t changed in far too many years. But Remus always seemed to be off limits. He was his best mate, who was also best mates with James and Peter. The four of them were a unit but he and Remus always connected on some other level. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Writing my magnum opus, you twat, what does it look like? Do you forget what work is? Sure dad would love you to lend a hand today if you need a lesson on how its all done in the real world. We got a big order to send out. It appears as if this person is starting their own library of literary classics.”</p><p>“They’re probably trying to impress someone.”</p><p>“Like when you read Wuthering Heights to get what’s-her-face’s attention.” Remus snickered as he put the last book in the box.</p><p>“That worked so well.” He said with a scoff. Sirius didn’t read whatever Brontë that was for some girl at school, he read it because he had seen Remus read it before and just wanted to see what the big deal was. And maybe he wanted to impress Remus a bit. But he had to keep up appearances, especially back then. Now, his sexuality was reasonably ambiguous even if he dated a few celeb women to keep up the facade but it was just something he was too used to for his old management. There was even a large group of fans of The Avenue that were rooting for Sirius to come out. That didn’t change his management’s mind. He wasn’t ready to anyway. He had his friends and family to do that with first.</p><p>“She didn’t even notice you read it.” Remus picked the box up and headed towards to back room. Sirius followed him. “I’m sure she’d notice you now. I think she still lives down the road.”</p><p>“Not interested.”</p><p>“Right, you’re dating that Florence girl, aren’t you? That model?”</p><p>“No.” Sirius shook his head. “I’m very very single right now. It’s essential for my songwriting process.”</p><p>“Huh, so you’re going back the studio? Alone?” Remus set the box on the counter.</p><p>“Yes, but you’re coming with me, so I’m not totally alone.” Sirius grinned and did sort of a jazz hands thing like it was a big gift for Remus.</p><p>“What now?”</p><p>“Remus, you’re the best songwriter I know. You were writing good songs when we were teenagers. Usually, teenagers write shite prose but yours was good. And you play guitar better than most people that I’ve come across.”</p><p>“You’re being serious — do not make a name joke.” Remus held up a hand.</p><p>Sirius bit his lip.</p><p>“I’m not a musician, Sirius.”</p><p>“No, you’re an unemployed 23-year-old who works for his parents. I know you wanted to be a journalist, but Remus, you could write differently. Come on, Remus, you’re amazing.”</p><p>“You don’t have to insult me in between the compliments.”</p><p>“Well, the compliments weren’t working! You always were more motivated when you were angry. Speaking of, Lyall said you were mad at me.”</p><p>“I wasn’t before you walked in here making fun of my employment status.” Remus grabbed the invoice that was on the table next to the box. “You know, it’s not a bad gig and I always thought I’d take over the business when my dad retires.”</p><p>“I know, Remus, but I’m just saying that you could also be a songwriter and guitarist in your oldest mate’s band.”</p><p>“James and I are older mates,” Remus said as he checked the books in the box to make sure that he had them all correct.</p><p>“You know what I’m saying.”</p><p>“Okay, say that I do agree to be a songwriter for you, what’s it entail then?”</p><p>“The team and I are going on a writing retreat to for two months. This includes Jamie and Lily visiting at some point. Peter’s agreed to come in to play drums for me. I also have a few rad girls in my band and my manager, producer, and techs are great. Reg might even come along. If anything you’d be getting away to a Caribbean island for two months.”</p><p>“All right, so I go do this and we write some songs. Then what happens.”</p><p>“We go on tour and you make some money off of the songs you write.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Then men and women will be throwing themselves at you,” Sirius said with a grin. Remus was out as a bisexual. He also felt like he should at least do the courtesy of coming out to Remus because Sirius was the first person he came out to when they were fourteen. But it always made him too nervous to say.</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>“So you’ll do it?”</p><p>“No.” Remus shook his head. “I’m fine here.”</p><p>“You know, John, you don’t even got a Yoko to break this up.”</p><p>“You know Yoko didn’t break up the Beatles. Plus, if anything was a Yoko, it was the bloody X Factor.” Remus said spitefully. Sirius never heard Remus say anything that wasn’t sarcastic about him going on. This was some real resentment.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Remus. But we can do it now.”</p><p>“You should get home because I’m not in the mood for you being a dick right now. Where is home?”</p><p>“I’m staying at the Potter’s estate. As usual.” The Potters had practically adopted Sirius at 16 after he was able to leave his parents legally. That was a whole thing that Sirius didn’t want to think about right now and Sirius didn’t want to get into that part of his past, so he stayed focused. “Come to dinner tonight or tomorrow.”</p><p>“I’m supposed to be coming tomorrow. Didn’t know you’d be there.”</p><p>“So, that changes things do you?” Sirius frowned.</p><p>“No, no, I’ll still be there. It’s not even you, Sirius or anything… I don’t know. Just, I’ll think about coming with you.”</p><p>“Yes!” Sirius jumped up in the air before going to plant a kiss on Remus’ cheek. “Thank you.”</p><p>“I’m just thinking about it, nothing else,” Remus warned him. “When would you need an answer?”</p><p>“Just anytime before I leave. So you have until two weeks from today.”</p><p>“Okay, but you don’t get to bug me about it.”</p><p>“I won’t, I swear,” Sirius said, trying to contain his excitement.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>The next day, Sirius was sitting in a wooden chair in the sitting room with a hairdresser he called up from London. He needed to get rid of his hair, because that’s usually what one does when they go into their next life event, wasn’t it? Sirius was sitting there with his hair in a low ponytail chatting to Regulus and Effie, James’ mum and the woman who started his career basically. “I didn’t realize you’d be doing this so close to dinner. James, Lily, Peter, and Remus should be here any moment.”</p><p>“Effie, you know how he is, last minute for everything,” Regulus said as Jean, his hairdresser took the clippers to his ponytail.</p><p>“Say goodbye to it, Sirius,” Jean spoke with a heavy French accent.</p><p>“Bye hair, you were nice.” Sirius gritted his teeth as the scissors cut through the ponytail.</p><p>“That’s it.” Jean handed him the ponytail. “Not quite enough to donate but that’s still a lot.”</p><p>“Wow,” Sirius looked down at his hair for a moment before tossing it on the ground.</p><p>“Now, I think we could sell that and make a good profit,” Remus said, Sirius didn’t realize the man had come into the room.</p><p>“Go to hell.” Sirius threw the two-fingered salute him. “You could frame it and put in the bookstore.”</p><p>“No thank you.” Remus snorted a laughed. “Dad would murder me if we put up the bratty boy from the nice part of town’s hair up.” He said as Jean started to cut Sirius’ hair into something more attractive than whatever it was going on after the ponytail was gone.</p><p>“Does he really still think of me like that?”</p><p>“Of course he does,” Effie said. “I’m going to check on dinner. Thanks for coming Remus.” She must have kissed him on the cheek from the sounds of it before leaving the room.</p><p>“It’s nice to see you two are still flirting,” Regulus commented as Remus took a seat that was in view of Sirius.</p><p>“Fuck off, Reg.” They both said in unison.</p><p>“I will. I’ll let you two continue to flirt and pretend you’re not. Just as you have been for like ten years now or some shit.” Regulus left as well.</p><p>“Remus, this is Jean, Jean this is my old mate Remus.” Sirius decidedly ignored what his brother was saying and went on to introduce his hairdresser to Remus.</p><p>“‘Ello Remus.” He said as he focused on Sirius’ hair.</p><p>“So, no more hair?”</p><p>“No, a fresh start.”</p><p>“That’s cliche, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes, but I love cliches.”</p><p>“You could write a song with them.”</p><p>Sirius laughed then sung, “Like a bed of roses or a crown of thorns/I’m used and worn/Gonna cut all my hair off/Its time for a fresh start.”</p><p>“I don’t think crown of thorns is a cliche, is it?” Remus pondered.</p><p>“I don’t know. It sounded like a horrible but good lyric. Something sad teens would write everywhere.”</p><p>“Well, at this rate you’ll have a full album before you go off to your writing retreat,” Remus suggested. “I didn’t realize that your sound was emo though. I always thought of you as like an early Stones or 60’s Beatles or even Queen. Well, without the boyband poppiness of it all.”</p><p>“Yes, but if I put it to a good sound, it won’t sound emo.”</p><p>“Sure, keeping thinking that mate.”</p><p>“So, ah, have you decided if you’re going to be coming with us?” Sirius asked, trying not to sound pushy or eager about it.</p><p>“I talked to my parents about it yesterday. I think they’re packing my bags for me as we speak.” Remus said, checking his phone. “They were very keen on the idea of me getting out of the house for a bit.”</p><p>“So… you’re coming.” Sirius was glad that he couldn’t move because of his haircut because he was sure he’d jump up and probably kiss Remus on the lips this time.</p><p>“I guess so.” Remus shrugged. “Don’t get up or Jean will have to shave your head. I don’t reckon you’d look fit bald.”</p><p>“My fans will love me no matter what.”</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes. “Right, but your friends will give you shite for the rest of your life.”</p><p>“I’m not going to jump out of my chair until Jean says I can. But I’m so excited that you’re coming, Remus. It’s going to be great. We haven’t written together in so long.” Sirius beamed at his mate. This was the start of something very good, he could feel it.</p><p>Later that night Sirius was watching telly in his room when Regulus popped his head in, “Can we talk?”</p><p>“I guess.” Sirius sat up as his younger brother came in and shut the door behind him. “What’s going on? Is it the hair? Does it look horrible?”</p><p>“God, you’re vain. It’s not your bloody hair.” Regulus sat next to him on his bed. “When are you just going to tell Remus you fancy him?”</p><p>“Reg, don’t start on this.”</p><p>“Come on, you can finally come out now. You don’t have to worry about mum and dad like you did until you were 17 then you started worrying about what your managers/producers/whatthefuckevers.” Regulus was the only one he had told that he was gay. That was mainly because Reg had caught him snogging a bloke once there wasn’t much else to say after that. Plus, it was good to have someone he could confide in.</p><p>“Even if I came out, what’s that have to do with Remus?”</p><p>“You two can’t be in the same room for ten minutes without flirting Or you bicker like you’re an old married couple at times. Just come out, date Remus, get married, and adopt some babies. Just admit it, Sirius, you’re in love with the bloke. I think everyone around you has suspected it at some point.”</p><p>“It’s not like that, Regulus. Remus and I are just close. I don’t know what to tell you.” Sirius looked down at his fingernails.</p><p>“You’re a shite liar. I don’t know how it’s gone on this long.” Regulus hit him on the shoulder.</p><p>“Okay, fine, I fancy Remus John Lupin and I have for years now.” Sirius groaned then threw himself back against his pillows. “I’d fuck up our friendship if I told him, so I don’t.”</p><p>“I’m just glad you admit it.”</p><p>“Can you stop saying that we’re flirting when we’re together?”</p><p>“I will now.” Regulus shrugged. “I don’t think you’d ruin anything. Forgive me for sounding twelve but I think he fancies you back.”</p><p>Sirius just rolled his eyes. “Doubtful, want to know why it’s doubtful?”</p><p>“Okay, lay it on me.”</p><p>“We made out once, before I went on tour. We were drunk but whatever it happened and I thought maybe that would be it. Then the next day he acted as nothing happened.”</p><p>“You made out with him! Sirius, you’re a bloody idiot. He probably thinks you’re either deep in the closet or not interested. You never talked to him about it?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“You’re just as much to blame then. If you talked to him, I’d bet something would come of it.”</p><p>“No thanks, I don’t want my heart broken. If he did like me, I think he would have said it by now. He’s more upfront about things than I am.”</p><p>“Maybe him putting himself out there was making out with you, I don’t know, that’d be my guess.” Regulus held his hands up and shrugged.</p><p>“It wasn’t because I kissed him first.”</p><p>“Well, he kissed you back, I’m assuming — hoping because if not this is a different conversation.”</p><p>“No, he kissed me too. But, Reg, nothing came from it. It’s over. I’m just going to pine over him forever. I’m sure I’ll meet someone I like eventually that will make me forget about Remus.”</p><p>“You’re going to be stuck in a house with him for two months. Maybe you won’t have to get over him.” Regulus raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Doubtful.”</p>
