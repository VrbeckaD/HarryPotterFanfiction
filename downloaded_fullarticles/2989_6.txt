          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Professor, I think it’s growing,” Belby said, alarm clear in his voice.</p>
<p>Harry turned halfway up the dungeon stairs to face the third year student following closely behind him. His hand, while certainly still puffed up and glaring red, was thankfully no larger than it had been a few minutes ago when he had approached Harry’s desk at the beginning of class. Harry had hastily set his students to copying down the potion recipe, and instructed they wait until his return before continuing where they left off on actually collecting the ingredients. </p>
<p>“I think you’ll be fine, Mr. Belby,” he said, trying for reassuring as they approached the doors to the hospital wing.</p>
<p>He led the way into the ward, where Draco Malfoy was in the process of making up a few of the beds. Bright sunlight streaming through the windows glinted off his hair as he spelled some linens into place, and Harry found himself smiling at the peaceful scene it made.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Malfoy said, noticing them. “What trouble have you managed to get up to now, Potter?” He made his way over.</p>
<p>“It seems Mr. Belby had some kind of... <i>reaction</i> to the billywig stings he was collecting for the Antidote to-”</p>
<p>“Uncommon Poisons, yes,” Malfoy finished, already reaching for Belby’s wrist in order to examine his hand up close.</p>
<p>“I guess you would know,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck as he watched Malfoy tilt Belby’s hand this way and that, observing the swelling with an attractive amount of focus...</p>
<p>“Surely you would have some Deflating Draught on hand?”</p>
<p>Harry was instantly snapped from his thoughts. “No, I, er, gave the last of my stores to you, remember?”</p>
<p>Malfoy rolled his eyes, finally releasing Belby’s hand. “Because allergies to potions ingredients are oh <i>so</i> rare, are they?” he asked pointedly. Belby was now looking between the two of them with an expression of faint bemusement.</p>
<p>Malfoy was right and Harry didn’t need to tell him that, so instead he grinned broadly, feeling warm with fondness for the git. Malfoy just looked at him, unnerved. He went and retrieved the draught, then made sure Belby downed a small flask of it before ushering them out the door. Harry lingered a moment, watching Malfoy turn back to the beds.</p>
<p>“See you tonight?” he asked quietly after making sure Belby was out of earshot. Harry didn’t think he was imagining the reddish tint to Malfoy’s face as he jerked his head in a nod, still facing away.</p></div>
