</center><hr/><p>Remus never pursued secrets. He happened on them. He had a face that said, <i>Confess anything! I won’t tell a soul!</i> He was everyone’s favorite confidante.</p><p>When he was nine, his mum had pressed her face to the steering wheel of their Muggle car and said: “Your father doesn’t love me anymore.” He’d asked her why, because he thought he could handle the burden of any secret. </p><p>Severus Snape wasn’t a nice person. He was mean, ill-tempered, bigoted. He attacked younger students in the corridors; he made sure everyone knew that he excelled at all his studies. Once he’d even stormed out of Potions when the class asked Slughorn to repeat instructions. “I could make this in my sleep!” he’d proclaimed loudly. “Only imbeciles don’t know this rubbish!”</p><p>He wasn’t the type to garner sympathy. He also wasn’t the type to confide in people, and yet Remus stumbled on his biggest secret.</p><p>Remus was in the back of the library. The book stacks were dusty, their spines either stiff from lack of use or falling apart from neglect. He’d been on his hands and knees, searching for a text from the nineteenth century. Binns had recommended it when Remus asked for further information on the wizarding community’s involvement in the 1848 Muggle revolutions. “You need to read a primary source to really understand,” Binns’d said. Now kneeling on the floor, Remus wanted to throttle him. Crawling back to his feet was going to hurt. The full moon wasn’t too long ago and—</p><p>“For the <i>last time</i>, I don’t want to ever speak to you again!” a girl whispered.</p><p>“Please—let me explain.” This was a boy.</p><p>Remus stilled. He thought he recognized the voices.</p><p>The girl laughed. “Do you think I’m an idiot?”</p><p>“No! Of course not!” The boy sounded like he was hyperventilating. “I would never think something like that about you!”</p><p>“But you would call me a Mudblood in front of the whole school?” The girl laughed again. “You’re ridiculous. I don’t understand what you expect from me.”</p><p>“I’m so sorry. Please—I didn’t mean to call you that.”</p><p>“But somehow it just slipped out! Why should I be friends with somebody who uses slurs so casually they just <i>slip out</i>?”</p><p>“Lily—<i>please</i>.”</p><p>Remus’ eyes widened.</p><p>“No. I’m through. I don’t want to be friends with someone like you.”</p><p>“There has to be something I can do! I’ll do anything!”</p><p>“You can stop being friends with terrible people. You think I don’t hear the rumors? You think I don’t know what your little group is up to? The moment I’m out of sight, you probably join them in taunting me about my blood. You lot want to <i>kill</i> people like me!”</p><p>“No! Never! I’d never want that—”</p><p>“Then prove it. Stop hanging around them.”</p><p>“I can’t do that,” the boy said quietly.</p><p>“Then we can’t be friends.” </p><p>“No! Wait—” There was some rustling.</p><p>“Let go of me—” </p><p>“I love you!” the boy whispered harshly.</p><p>“I know.” Lily sounded on the verge of tears. “But it’s not enough.” </p><p>She rushed away. There was a horrible crash, like someone tore all the books from a shelf.</p><p>The boy rounded the corner and nearly stepped on Remus.</p><p>“Sorry,” Remus said, struggling to his feet. </p><p>Snape shoved him against the wall. “What did you hear?”</p><p>He wanted to deny hearing anything, but he refused to cower. He glared at Snape. “I was minding my own business. It’s not my fault you decided to have a personal conversation where anyone could overhear.”</p><p>Snape punched him in the face. Remus fell to the ground, stunned.</p><p>“Next time I won’t be so nice!” Snape stormed away.</p><p>Remus lay where he fell for a while, too weary to get up. His jaw ached, but his knees hurt even more. He wished he didn’t have to feel like he’d been trampled by a hippogriff after the full moon.</p><p>He supposed he should be livid at Snape, but there was no sense in being angry at lunatics. When he finally made it back to his feet, he was trembling. He wondered if his mates were looking for him.</p><p>In the Gryffindor common room, he found the other Marauders crowded around a table near the window. They had their books out like they were studying, but Remus knew better.</p><p>Sirius’ eyes widened. “What happened to your face?”</p><p>“What’s wrong with it?” Remus touched his cheek. </p><p>“It’s all red—like you’ve been thrashed.”</p><p>“Oh.” Remus didn’t meet his gaze. </p><p>Sirius moved closer. “What happened? Did someone <i>hit you</i>?”</p><p>He hesitated. Sirius would want to know why Snape had punched him, and he felt strangely protective of what he’d just overheard. He doubted Lily would want others to know. </p><p>“Some arsehole Slytherin cornered you, didn’t he?” Sirius’ face darkened. “Was it Avery? Was it Snivellus?” Remus didn’t say anything, which made Sirius smile. “Let’s go find them.” </p><p>A thrill shot through Remus. Yeah, why not?</p><p>“Brilliant,” James said, closing his book. “I was looking for a distraction.”</p><p>“The last time I saw Avery he was coming out of Charms,” Peter said.</p><p>They stomped from the common room. They were off to war. It took a bit of help from the map, but they found Avery, Mulciber, and Snivellus in the dungeons. God. They were seriously the ugliest blokes Remus had ever seen. </p><p>“Oh look, it’s the Gryffindorks,” Avery said.</p><p>James shook his head sadly. “Come on, you can do better than that.”</p><p>Avery smirked. “At least my mum isn’t so old she shits dust.”</p><p>Shrugging, James said, “Fair point, but it does help us save on toilet paper.”</p><p>“Didn’t your father just die, Potter?” Snape said. “No more need to save when there’s one less old arse to wipe.”</p><p>“That’s funny,” Sirius said, faking a laugh. “Everyone here knows your family can’t even afford a toilet.”</p><p>Snape rolled his eyes. “Say what you will about my family, but at least my mum <i>loves</i> me. Didn’t yours just throw you out?”</p><p>“Do they, though?” Sirius cocked his head and squinted. “Because I’m not so sure judging by the face they gave you.”</p><p>Snape threw the first curse; it struck the wall next to Sirius’ head. “<i>Locomotor Wibbly</i>!” Sirius yelled. Snape collapsed. </p><p>“<i>Calvorio</i>!” James was aiming at Mulciber; the curse ricocheted off hanging armor and hit Avery, but it malfunctioned: Avery’s hair grew large and curly instead of disappearing.</p><p>James laughed and laughed. “Look, everyone, Avery’s got a minge on his head!”</p><p>Snape hit James in the stomach with <i>something</i>; James fell to the ground, clutching his midsection. Knowing the severity of Snape’s curses, Remus was immediately alarmed. He sent a stunner at Snape’s face and dropped to his aching knees to help James. </p><p>“It’s all right,” James said, shaking a little. “I’m not bleeding or anything.”</p><p>“Are you in pain?” Remus asked.</p><p>Sirius was still battling with Mulciber and Avery; Snape lay on the floor, probably unconscious. “Get him to the hospital wing!” Sirius yelled. </p><p>“What is going on here?” McGonagall stood at the end of the corridor, wand drawn and an intense frown on her face.</p><p>They all stilled; no one made sound except for Snape, who grunted and attempted to sit up.</p><p>McGonagall came closer. “I ask again: What is going on?”</p><p>Peter tried to hide behind Sirius, which prompted him to gather the courage to speak first. He put his wand away and hung his head. “We were being foolish,” Sirius said.</p><p>“Yes, that is quite obvious.” She crouched over Snape. “Do you need medical attention?”</p><p>“No, Professor.” Snape pulled himself to his feet, his expression murderous. His eyes flashed from Remus to Sirius, then he grinned when he saw James. “But it looks like Potter needs some help.”</p><p>“I’m fine.” James tried to stand up but gasped and sat back down. </p><p>“Fifty points from Slytherin,” McGonagall said. “I will not tolerant violence in the corridors!”</p><p>“What about them?” Avery and Snape yelled. </p><p>“They will be punished, rest assured.” She jabbed the air with her wand. “Now off you go. I will be speaking to Professor Slughorn about your stupidity!”</p><p>Glaring and flourishing wands, the three Slytherins disappeared down the corridor. Remus let out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding. </p><p>McGonagall looked even angrier. “<i>Sixty points</i> from Gryffindor!” She motioned Remus away and examined James closely with her wand. “No internal damage, Thank Merlin. You boys need to stop acting like such fools!”</p><p>They hung their heads; even James looked a bit guilty. “Sorry, Professor,” he muttered, still clutching his stomach.</p><p>“Get yourself to the hospital wing for an ice charm,” she said. “And for the rest of you, get back to the common room. You have disgraced yourselves enough today!”</p><p>They helped James shuffle to the hospital wing and briefly considered staying with him until McGonagall poked her head inside and barked at them to leave.</p><p>“Can you handle it here without us?” Sirius asked.</p><p>“I’ll try not to cry myself to sleep,” James said, already dozing from a sleeping potion.</p><p>“Tomorrow I’ll bring you a bun from breakfast,” Peter said. “One with currants.”</p><p>“Thanks, mate.” James’ eyelids flickered. They left.</p><p>Back in the common room, Peter yawned loudly. “I’m knackered,” he said, and drifted up to bed.</p><p>Sirius and Remus looked at each other. The room was busy tonight, so they were by no means alone, but it was weird to suddenly not have James or Peter with them. </p><p>“So who hit you?” Sirius asked.</p><p>“Nobody,” Remus said, laughing a little. “I just wanted to cause trouble.”</p><p>“That’s quite naughty of you,” Sirius said, laughing too, his eyes brighter than usual. Remus’ hand twitched; he saw himself leaning in and kissing Sirius; the firelight made his lips look pink and full, and Remus wanted to taste them just once. </p><p>Remus turned away. He brushed a hand over his face. He didn’t know how Sirius was reading him, but he couldn’t help if he was being awkward. It was so easy to self-destruct around Sirius.</p><p>“I guess I’m tired too,” Remus said, not meeting Sirius’ gaze.</p><p>“You guess?”</p><p>“Yeah, I dunno.” Melancholy draped over him like a cloak; it comforted him to let in a little self-pity.</p><p>“The night’s young . . . there’s still time to play some chess or finish some homework . . .”</p><p>“No, that’s all right.” Remus forced a laugh. “I’ll follow Wormtail up to bed.”</p><p>Sirius grabbed his shoulder as Remus made for the staircase. The touch was awkward, weak, and his fingertips just skimmed over his robes. Remus didn’t have the nerve to look back at him. He went up the staircase, his heart pounding. </p><p></p><center>

</center><p>He shook as he got ready for bed. He hated it when Sirius touched him; what did it <i>mean</i>? It meant nothing! He was ridiculous if he thought otherwise. Sirius was <i>too attractive</i> to want him. He could have any girl in the school, probably any woman in Britain, why would he even think about Remus in that way? </p><p>He pulled his hangings closed and buried himself under his covers. He wanted to be invisible. He wanted to just be alone for once, but that was damn near impossible at Hogwarts.   </p><p>Remus didn’t know anyone like himself. He was a werewolf who liked boys. He shouldered both secrets equally, or at least he did until the other Marauders discovered his furry little problem. His mates knew about his lycanthropy but they could never know about his sexuality. No one around him was homosexual. It was a myth, an unspoken terror. He would’ve been perfectly happy to carry this truth deep inside if Sirius hadn’t mucked it all up.  </p><p>Sometimes it hurt to look at Sirius. Sometimes, when they sat close while studying or watching James play Quidditch, Remus thought he might go mad from not touching him. He never knew what Sirius was thinking, but there were times when he leaned too closely to Remus, when his hands lingered for too long on his shoulder or back. Remus was determined not to read too much into it. Sirius was an affectionate bloke. He was always crowding James on the sofa or in bed; he was always reaching for James, like he needed an anchor. Remus wasn’t jealous. He wasn’t. </p><p>Sirius was <i>pretty</i>. He was breathtaking. Remus understood why all the girls gawked at him, why they showered him with Valentines on February 14. Remus wrote Sirius Valentines as well. He just sent them anonymously. </p><p>He wasn’t <i>in love</i> with Sirius. No, he was too practical for that. He was obsessed with Sirius. He worshipped him. He would <i>die</i> for him. </p><p>Remus touched his cheek. He sympathized with Snape. Really, he did. He couldn’t imagine Snape overhearing his declaration of love to Sirius. He cringed and pressed his face into his pillow. God, he’d be mortified. He wouldn’t have <i>punched</i> Snape, but he could see why Snape had punched him. It was what bastards did when cornered.</p><p><i>Serves him right</i>, Remus thought, remembering Snape taking his stunner to the face.</p><p>Sirius. Oh, Sirius. Remus didn’t understand him. They were good mates; they were nearly inseparable. Remus trusted him with his life, but Sirius was unknowable. He was strong and talented; he was moody and traumatized; he clung to a close few and pushed the rest of the world out. He was tall and elegant and had a mouth like a woman’s. He evaded darkness; he shone so bright that sometimes Remus couldn’t even look. Still, his mind was something blank to Remus, his motivations a deep mystery. Remus wanted to know. </p><p>An hour or so later Sirius came up to the dormitory. He undressed in the dark, his robes and shirt rustling loudly; then his belt banged against his thigh, and Remus knew he was down to just his pants. He was close and damn near starkers, and Remus could do nothing about it. He groaned a little, muffled by the bedding; he couldn’t breathe; he wanted too much.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Remus had long ago accepted that he was an unlucky person, but being paired with Snape for the biggest Potions exam of the year was one of the worst things that’d ever happened to him. Perhaps he was being just <i>a little</i> melodramatic, but the world was changing. He beat against the encroaching years. Adulthood waited for the capture.<p>It also didn’t help that Snape was being <i>weird</i>, and Remus had no idea what to make of it. The first day of their project Snape shrugged and handed him a knife. “It could’ve been worse. At least you know what you’re doing.”</p><p>“I do?” Remus asked. </p><p>“We’ll see.”</p><p>Remus snorted and looked across the room for his mates. Peter had been paired with Mulciber (bless him) and Sirius had been paired with Lily. Thank God James wasn’t in this class. Sirius caught his eye and winked. Remus smirked back, but his stomach squirmed pleasantly. He loved it when Sirius winked at him. </p><p>Snape poked him hard in the shoulder. “These roots aren’t going to chop themselves.”</p><p>“Right,” Remus said, and began to slice the roots quickly. He blew out his cheeks. No, he needed to slow down. The success of his whole year depended on getting good marks on this project. No matter how much he rushed through the prep, he’d still be stuck with Snape for <i>weeks</i>.</p><p>Slughorn wandered around the classroom, his mustache twitching, his nose red from the bubbling cauldrons. He liked challenging them; he liked pairing Gryffindors and Slytherins together, but only when he was certain the Slytherin was better.</p><p>Frowning, Remus read over the instructions for <i>Flore Pectora</i>; Slughorn never expected them to deviate from the textbook but it looked like Snape had other plans.</p><p>“How can you even read the instructions with all those scribbles?” Remus leaned over to get a better look at Snape’s book.</p><p>Snape smirked. “The textbook is rubbish. It’s a shame you haven’t realized it before.”</p><p>“I never said I was an expert at Potions.”</p><p>“No, of course not; your head is too far up your own arse for that.”</p><p>“You just said I was good at this,” Remus said, a little amused.</p><p>“I said you know what you’re doing, not that you’re <i>good</i>.” </p><p>“Do you think anyone is good at Potions? Besides yourself, of course.”</p><p>Snape flinched. “A few.” </p><p>Remus glanced at Lily and Sirius; he had a feeling he knew what’d made Snape flinch.  </p><p>He shifted and tried not to show his discomfort. He was wary of Snape’s wand. He kept his eye on it as he finished up his chopping, then turned to crushing some beetle heads. Standing this close, Snape could do a lot of damage to him. He could put a curse on Remus that only revealed itself hours later. He could stick one of those joke parchments that read <i>Kick me here</i> on Remus’ backside; those were always annoying. The joke was that everyone could see the parchment except for the person wearing it.</p><p>It was only a few weeks ago when Remus’s stunner had struck Snape in the face. Why was Snape being so . . . calm? Remus squinted; he was probably plotting something.</p><p>“What?” Snape said, not looking away from his own slicing.</p><p>Remus continued to squint. “Old Slughorn isn’t going to pass us if we can’t work together.”</p><p>“It seems like we’re getting on just fine,” Snape said.</p><p>“Do I have to worry about you cursing me?”</p><p>“Around the potion? Absolutely not.”</p><p>“And not around the potion?”</p><p>Snape hesitated. “No . . . not unless you give me reason.”</p><p>“We hate each other. Anything could give you reason.”</p><p>“I don’t hate you.”</p><p>Remus laughed. “Of course you do.”</p><p>Snape finally looked at him. “How can I hate you when I never think of you?”</p><p>He blinked. “You think of James and Sirius.”</p><p>Snorting, Snape said, “Just barely.”</p><p><i>Liar</i>, he thought. “Shall we shake on it, then? A wizard’s agreement?”</p><p>“Must we? I think I can stop myself from beating your arse for six weeks.”</p><p>“Beating my arse? The last time I checked I’d knocked you <i>unconscious</i>.”</p><p>“Ha! You wish!” Snape took up a towel to wipe his hands. “I was merely catching my breath.”</p><p>“I still insist on the handshake,” Remus said, definitely not trusting this friendlier version of Snape. </p><p>“This is ridiculous,” Snape said, but he put down the towel. He yanked Remus’ arm into a handshake, his fingers cold and biting. “Is this enough or do I need to drop to my knees, too?”</p><p>“It’s enough.” He stepped away and glanced passed Snape; Sirius was glowering at them, which made Remus raise his eyebrows. Sirius turned back to his work.</p><p>“We need to meet tonight,” Snape said.</p><p>“Why?” Remus had a lot of homework to finish up before tomorrow.</p><p>Snape made a frustrated noise. “Our project has to be the best. This means research. This means experimentation.”</p><p>“Nobody else is going to do that much work!”</p><p>“A few will, and I refuse to be second best.” Snape straightened his back. “You don’t have to be there, but you are fooling yourself if you think I’m going to do all the work and stay quiet about it.”</p><p>“I’m not—Christ, Snape!” Remus ran his hands over his face. “<i>Fine.</i> I’ll be there.”</p><p>“Good. Meet me in the library after dinner.”</p><p>Remus groaned.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>That night Remus met Snape in the library. It was crowded like usual, all the candles lit up on the walls.<p>The potion they had to make was deadly. Stopping the heart was its main purpose. A bloom in the chest; the strangling of veins. Remus thought it was a bit morbid, but he supposed it was a helpful concoction to know. It could be used in murder or in magical surgery; the extraction of the pulmonary vein mid-message would be impossible without it. Remus was surprised that Snape wasn’t already salivating.</p><p>“The selection in this place is pathetic,” Snape said. He slammed down yet another book on the table.</p><p>“Isn’t it renowned?” Remus asked.</p><p>“Only by idiots.” Snape flipped through the book, then glanced in the direction of the restricted section. “They lock up everything of value.”</p><p>Remus knew what kind of texts were in the restricted section. He shook his head. “You’re only interested in magic that maims.”</p><p>“No,” Snape muttered. “I’m interested in magic that gives me <i>power</i>.”</p><p>“Christ.” As if he needed any more proof that Snape was an arsehole. “You’re barmy.”</p><p>Snape found something useful in the book and hastily copied down the section, his nose almost touching the parchment. Remus studied the differences between the textbook and Snape’s own notes. He knew enough to know that Snape’s alterations bordered on brilliant. </p><p>“I’m impressed,” he said reluctantly. “Who knew you could achieve so much when you don’t have any friends?”</p><p>“I have friends.” Snape glanced in his direction. “What in particular impresses you?”</p><p>“I never would’ve thought to use both the stem and the petal of the sanguine flower.”</p><p>“Yes, I made that discovery by accident, but we’ll have to try loads of different things for this project.”</p><p>Remus thought for a moment. “The textbook does say the potion relies heavily on the heads of ginger ants . . . we could try incorporating the entire body of the ant and see what happens.”</p><p>“I’m glad we’re on the same page.” Snape tapped his wand against the table, contemplating. “Frankly, I think Slughorn supplies subpar insects; the beetles he has us using are practically fossilized. We should look for fresh in the Forbidden Forest.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Snape frowned. “Why not? You’re obviously familiar with the place.”</p><p>“I just don’t want to.” Remus stared down at his hands. The forest belonged to the Marauders; Snape had no business being there. </p><p>“Fine, I’ll go by myself.” Snape yanked another book open. </p><p>“Just . . . don’t go when there’s a full moon,” Remus whispered.</p><p>“When’s the next one?”</p><p>“Two Saturdays from now, on the fifth of March.”</p><p>Snape jotted this down in the corner of his book. “I’ll have to go before then anyway.”</p><p>“Good.” Remus bounced his leg; it was weird to talk to someone new about his lycanthropy. </p><p>“Here,” Snape said, and handed him a list. “Go find these books for me.”</p><p>“I’m not your errand boy,” Remus said as he stood. It took a good hour to track down every book except for one. When he asked the librarian about its location, he discovered that Lily had already checked it out. </p><p>He dropped off the books and made to pack up his belongings. Snape glared at him. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I’ve already been here for too long. My mates are going to think you murdered me or something.”</p><p>“I’m going to murder you if you don’t sit back down!” Snape handed him the top book. “Look in there for any theories on hearts or blood or death.”</p><p>Remus read the title out loud: “<i>The Mystery of the Heart: Potions and Curses in the New Era of Blood Magic</i>. Snape, that’s the entire book!”</p><p>Snape smiled wickedly. “I guess you’re going to be here all night.”</p><p>“You are such a git.” Remus flipped to the index and began strategizing on how best to tackle the book.</p><p>An hour or so later, Remus closed the book and stood to stretch his arms. “I’m done for tonight. It feels like I’ve been here for <i>years</i>.”</p><p>“You sound pathetic.” Snape handed him the remaining books. “Read these before we meet next.”</p><p>“I don’t have time for this! The world isn’t going to end if we don’t search through every damn book in here!” </p><p>Snape shook his head. “Merlin, Lupin. If I had a Galleon for every intelligent thing you say, I’d be poor.”</p><p>“Judging by your underpants, you’re already poor.” Remus grabbed the books and left.</p><p>The corridors were empty, the candles burning low in the walls. Sodding Snape. He’d kept Remus in the library for the whole evening; when was he going to find the time to do the rest of his homework?</p><p>The Gryffindor common room was nearly as empty as the corridors. James and Peter had already gone off to bed; Sirius sat by the fire, staring moodily into the flames.</p><p>“All right there?” Remus flopped into the chair next to Sirius.</p><p>Sirius barely looked at him. “You were gone a long time.”</p><p>“Snivellus insisted on it.” Remus sighed and rubbed at his face. “Fuck.”</p><p>“I’m surprised you haven’t asked Slughorn for a switch.”</p><p>“I didn’t even think about it.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know.” Sirius stood. “More Muggles were found dead this morning.”</p><p>“Oh?” Remus frowned up at him.</p><p>Sirius nodded. “The next time you’re alone with Snivellus, you should ask him what he thinks about <i>that</i>.” He climbed the stairs to their dormitory, his back a stiff line.</p><p>Remus gaped at him. He sat for a good while before collecting his bag and following Sirius upstairs. The dormitory was quiet; Peter was snoring softly and James’ arm dangled off the side of his bed. Sirius’ hangings were closed. Remus pulled them open to find Sirius glaring at him.</p><p>“It doesn’t mean we’re mates,” Remus said.</p><p>“It’s still <i>wrong</i>,” Sirius said, and tried to pull his hangings close. The top button on his pyjamas was undone, revealing some of his collarbone. God. Remus just wanted to crawl into bed with him. </p><p>“Are you doing this with Peter too? Giving him the cold shoulder?”</p><p>“We both know Peter’s too stupid to even notice.” Sirius clawed at his fingers; Remus felt the warm sleepiness of him. Remus grabbed his wrist and twisted a little. His mouth was dry. They were going to wrestle.</p><p>“You little shite, let go of me!”</p><p>“No, not until you stop being ridiculous.” He swallowed down a bubble of laughter. </p><p>“This isn’t funny!” Sirius tried punching him in the stomach. “This is life or death!”</p><p>“It’s going to be life or death if you don’t let me sleep!” James yelled. </p><p>“Sod off, Prongs,” Sirius said. “This doesn’t concern you.”</p><p>“Then fucking mime your row or something,” James said, twisting around angrily. He called them twats and shoved a pillow over his head.</p><p>Remus rammed his whole body into Sirius; they toppled onto his bed, tussling, breathing hard. Sirius was all sharp elbows. Remus was angry now. Sirius was so <i>stupid</i>; he was so blind. Remus had wanted for so long, and Sirius had the nerve to be the one upset.</p><p>Remus caught a fist in his side, then in his chest. He kneed Sirius in the groin, which made Sirius yelp.</p><p>“Uncalled for!” Sirius grunted.</p><p>“Your face is uncalled for.” Remus tried to hit some more, but Sirius caught both of his wrists. “Let go of me!”</p><p>“Be quiet.” Sirius pulled him closer. He wrapped his arms around Remus and pressed his face to his neck. </p><p>

</p><p>Remus didn’t understand. He gasped for breath, adrenaline still making lead of his limbs. He became aware of how he crouched above Sirius, how Sirius’ wet mouth touched his skin. No, it couldn’t be. He was reading this all wrong. Sirius was just trying to immobilize him.</p><p>“Sirius,” he said, and he hated what he sounded like.</p><p>“Don’t say anything,” Sirius whispered. </p><p>Remus gulped. His heart pounded so hard it hurt. He relaxed a little and let his nose brush Sirius’ hair. Sirius smelled amazing. He shifted underneath Remus; their chests and thighs brushed. If Remus relaxed a little more, perhaps he could brush against Sirius’ prick . . .</p><p>Remus yanked away. His legs were wrapped up in the duvet and he ended up on his arse on the floor. He needed the loo. He was hard; he was hard and Sirius had probably felt it.</p><p>“What’s happening?” Peter asked groggily. </p><p>“Nothing!” Remus said too loudly. “Just go back to sleep.”</p><p>“Doesn’t sound like nothing to me.” Peter prodded his pillow.</p><p>This was when Sirius should’ve said something snarky, but he remained silent. Christ. Remus hurried from the room. Sirius knew. He fucking <i>knew</i>. Remus couldn’t breathe. Sirius would tell James, and they would do what? Pity him? Laugh at him? Fuck. Fuck. </p><p>In the loo, he pressed his forehead against the cold wall. He dropped his trousers to get a fist around his cock. No, he wouldn’t wank. It wasn’t right. He’d just traumatized one of his best mates. But fuck Sirius had felt good beneath him. Sirius was a little taller than him, and his legs had been long and graceful and <i>warm</i>. </p><p>Remus jerked in his hand. Christ. Okay. It was fine if nobody knew. He vowed to never wrestle with Sirius again. Yes, that made it better. His fist moved on his cock. Yes, yes. Sirius. <i>Sirius.</i> Maybe one day he could get Sirius to touch him. Just as a joke. Sirius would roll his eyes and brush his knuckles against Remus’ clothed erection.</p><p>“Looks like you got a bit of a problem,” Sirius would say.</p><p>“And not a minge in sight.” Remus would sound mournful, a bit doubtful, even as he moved closer.</p><p>He remembered how soft Sirius’ lips had felt against his neck, and he was coming hard and silently, a white flash filling his head. He slumped against the wall, wrecked, strangely emotional. It was a long time before he went back up to bed.</p>

  <p>*</p>
</center>The next time Remus met up with Snape in the library, he was irritated, wound up, frustrated about many things with little outlet. He wanted to throw a book in Sirius’ face; he wanted to tell everyone around him to just <i>fuck off</i>; he couldn’t wait to run with the Marauders under the full moon. Snape sneered.<p>“What?” Remus snapped.</p><p>“You didn’t read the books.”</p><p>“I read some of them!”</p><p>“You imbecile. Flipping through the pages is not the same as reading the full text.”</p><p>Remus gritted his teeth. “Do not call me names. I’m in no mood for it.”</p><p>Snape didn’t flinch; he tilted his head, curious. “Is this because of your condition? Your bad mood?”</p><p>“Most likely,” Remus muttered.</p><p>Snape jotted a note in the margin of his parchment.</p><p>“Don’t write that down!”</p><p>“Oops,” Snape said, looking bored.</p><p>Sighing loudly, Remus opened the books he’d admittedly only flipped through quickly. He worked for a good stretch of time, adding to the notes he’d generated on his own, but then his mind wandered. He wondered what Sirius was doing. He was probably doing homework back in the common room; he could never find his textbooks and usually just leaned close to James to read his. They were probably crowded together, arms brushing, as they hastily finished their Charms essays. He wondered if Sirius missed him.   </p><p>“Will you stop playing with yourself, and actually <i>do something</i>?” Snape said.</p><p>Remus spluttered. “I’m not playing with myself!”</p><p>Snape stole his notes and flipped through them with a sneer on his face. “And of course you came here with nothing more than a few obvious conclusions.”</p><p>“There’s some good stuff there! I admit that most of it was done last minute, but not all of it is rubbish.”</p><p>Snape snorted. “Masturbation is like procrastination—it’s all good fun until you realize you’re just fucking yourself.”</p><p>Remus pressed his face to the table. He was not going to laugh at something Snape said. He refused. When he recovered, he sat back up and took back his notes. “Christ, you’re a lunatic.”</p><p>“You have no idea,” Snape muttered, his enormous nose stuffed inside a book.</p><p>Remus glanced at the bookshelves in the back. He had some idea. He tried reading his notes to highlight the valuable parts, but his mind kept straying to Snape and Lily. It was a bad idea to bring it up with Snape, but his years as a Marauder had made him comfortable with risk.</p><p>“How do you know Lily?” Remus asked.</p><p>“Drop it.” Snape didn’t look at him, but his voice was dangerously low.</p><p>“You don’t have to admit to anything; I’m just curious how you know each other.”</p><p>“We don’t.” Snape glared at his book. </p><p>“You don’t know her but you think you lov—”</p><p>“Shut up!” Snape roared. </p><p>“No yelling!” the librarian yelled from somewhere in the stacks. </p><p>“There’s no need to get so prickly.” Remus was enjoying himself.</p><p>Snape heaved a breath. He bared his teeth. “You want to <i>survive</i> this project, werewolf?” he whispered. “Then don’t fucking talk about her.”</p><p>Remus lounged in his chair. “I don’t understand why it’s such a big secret.”</p><p>“It’s not; it’s just none of your fucking business.”</p><p>“What if I want to make it my business?” Remus linked his hands behind his head and widened his legs; casual and cool. </p><p>Snape stood. He collected his things and laughed down at Remus. “You’re never going to be like them, you know. People like us don’t get happy endings.”</p><p>“What?” Remus dropped his hands. </p><p>He walked away.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>The next day Remus expected to be summoned to Slughorn’s office. No way would Snape want to continue partnering with him for the project. Instead he woke up to a note fluttering by his head. He blinked and reached for it, but it evaded his hand. Cursing, he sat up and grabbed it so violently he crushed its wings.<p>He recognized the writing inside: <i>She was my best friend</i>.</p><p>He blinked, not understanding. Did the potion have something to do with friendship? No, Snape was talking about Lily. But why would he tell Remus? </p><p>His mates were still asleep. Remus tiptoed from bed to pull out some parchment from his bag. He hesitated with quill in hand. <i>She’s better off without you</i>, he wanted to write. Instead he jotted down: <i>There’ll be other girls</i>. He opened the window and let out the note like a fly. </p><p>Remus was having breakfast when the next note appeared. <i>No there won’t</i>. He rolled his eyes. Talk about being dramatic. </p><p>“What’s that?” Sirius asked.</p><p>“It’s a note from Snivellus.”</p><p>“Blimey,” James said. “I’m surprised it’s not dripping in grease.” Peter laughed around his bite of sausage. </p><p>“Why is he sending you notes?” Sirius sneered a little.</p><p>“I honestly don’t know.” Remus frowned at him. “It doesn’t mean anything.”</p><p>“Sure.” Sirius rose from the table. “I’ve got to go. See you lot later.”</p><p>“What has gotten into him?” Remus said to James.</p><p>James shrugged. “Best to just ask him.”</p><p>“I could ask him for you,” Peter said.</p><p>“Don’t do that.” Remus forked an egg onto his toast and shoved the whole thing into his mouth. The full moon approached.</p><p>He was in History of Magic when he received the third note from Snape. It told Remus to meet him in the dungeons that night. Remus was suspicious. </p><p>After dinner, he crept to the dungeons with his wand drawn. He was wary. It could be an ambush. He found Snape in a tiny room filled with Potions equipment. Perhaps this was where Slughorn experimented.</p><p>“You’re late,” Snape said. He stood in front of three empty cauldrons. He tapped his wand against one and listened closely.</p><p>Remus dropped his bag and came closer. He didn’t pocket his wand. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m testing the cauldron’s material. Most of what this school provides us is rubbish.”</p><p>“I bet it’s better than anything you could afford.” Remus pulled out three lists of possible alterations to the ingredients. Unable to hide a bit of a smirk, he handed them over to Snape. “See, I <i>am</i> capable.”</p><p>Snape took out his own lists. He compared them. He nodded. “Good. We’ve come to many of the same conclusions.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes.” He pointed to something on both the parchments. “I’m impressed you identified Ashwinder Eggs on your own. Not many people know they pair well with the sanguine flower.”</p><p>Remus shrugged. “It was in one of the books. I’m surprised it’s not included in the textbook instructions.”</p><p>“I told you the textbook was useless.” Snape shook his head. “It’s like they mislead us on purpose. They don’t want us to think for ourselves!”</p><p>Remus examined the cauldrons. “I assume the plan is to make three separate potions to determine which combination of ingredients is the best?”</p><p>“Correct.” Snape examined their lists again. He underlined a few ingredients. “I have a feeling using the entire ginger ant body will not interact with Ashwinder Egg properly. For Potion A, we should leave it out entirely. Then for Potion B, we should use the ant body but leave out the egg. Potion C should include all three: the egg, the sanguine flower, and the ginger ant body. What do you think?”</p><p>Remus blinked. What did he think? “Honestly, I don’t know enough to determine if any of this is going to make a difference.”</p><p>“That’s why we’re <i>experimenting</i>.”</p><p>“Yes, Professor.”</p><p>Snape grimaced. He pulled out three leather pouches from his bag. “I visited the Forbidden Forest last night.”</p><p>“Oh? Did you see any dangerous creatures?”</p><p>“No, you weren’t there.”</p><p>Remus laughed reluctantly; Snape was just trying to rile him up but his comeback had been funny. Remus had to give credit where it was due. Snape looked pleased. </p><p>“You want to make sure not to touch the sanguine flower with your bare hands,” Snape said. He cast a protection spell on his hands and held up a red and white petal. “This potion is very temperamental. Even the grease from your skin could change the way the compounds interact.”</p><p>“Isn’t the sanguine flower also poisonous to the touch? I wouldn’t want to pick it up anyway.”</p><p>Snape gaped at his raised hands. “Oh, no,” he said in a staged whisper.</p><p>“Shut up,” Remus said, smiling. “You’d be dead if you picked those flowers without gloves.”</p><p>“Only on the inside,” Snape muttered. </p><p>“Let’s get to work, you weirdo,” he said, shaking his head.</p><p>It took them the next two nights to prepare all the ingredients. Snape said it was best to add live ants directly into the potion, and it was a damn experience trying to drop in the right amount without them crawling out the jar and up his arm. The Ashwinder Eggs were another ordeal. They kept bursting into flames before Remus was able to add them; one even burst into flame in Remus’ palm. He yelped and flung it away. Snape laughed so hard he teared up.</p><p>By the end of the week, they had the three potions bubbling in their cauldrons. Remus peered into each one, relieved, more than a little proud. He was sweaty, agitated. He couldn’t wait for the weekend. He couldn’t wait for the release of the full moon. He caught Snape staring.</p><p>“What?” he said.</p><p>Snape dragged his eyes away. He played with some loose string on his robes. “The full moon is tomorrow,” he said quietly.</p><p>“Yes,” Remus said, trying not to bounce on his feet. </p><p>“What does it feel like?”</p><p>Remus wasn’t expecting this question. “What do you think it feels like?”</p><p>“I read that it hurts. I read it was the most pain a human could feel.” Snape was looking at him with a great deal of interest. </p><p>“It is very painful initially, but then something happens and suddenly it’s not. Suddenly it feels good. It feels incredible . . . almost like sex.”</p><p>“No way.” Snape jerked his head. “No way it feels like that.”</p><p>“How would you know!”</p><p>“I’ve got a brain. I’m not stupid. No way does turning into a bloody werewolf feel like <i>sex</i>.”</p><p>“Are you supposed to be some expert or something? A virgin like you?”</p><p>Snape flushed. “I’m not a virgin!”</p><p>“<i>Sure</i>.” Remus laughed. “No minge would even want to get close.”</p><p>“You haven’t shagged anyone either!”</p><p>“Yes, I have. Of course I have.” Remus avoided his eyes. </p><p>Snape smirked. “It’s funny you of all people are talking about shagging minges.”</p><p>Remus went cold. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Shrugging, Snape packed up his stuff. He checked the flames under the potions, then cast alarm spells around their work area. He headed for the door. “You know exactly what I mean.” He left.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>The next night, the Marauders helped Remus to the Shrieking Shack. This close to the moon he could barely walk on his own; he had the biggest urge to <i>crawl</i> down the tunnel to the Shack’s hidden entrance.<p>Sirius helped him take off his robes and shoes. Then came his jumper and vest top. He took Remus into his arms and they eased down to some blankets on the floor. Sirius always did this for him right before the transformation, and Remus was always too lost to appreciate it.</p><p>“We’re going to head to the forest now.” James squeezed Remus’ shoulder. “Hang in there. We’ll be waiting for you.” Remus trembled too much to answer.</p><p>When James and Peter had slipped back into the tunnel, Sirius pulled Remus even closer. He pressed his lips to his temple. He murmured: “Everything’s going to be okay. You’re so brave, Moony.”</p><p><i>I hate this, I hate this, I hate this,</i> Remus wanted to say. Instead he whined softly and pressed his nose to Sirius’ neck. God, Sirius smelled like home. He smelled like happiness. Remus wanted to hold him down and fuck him. He wanted to lick every part of him. He wanted to cling to him and never let go. </p><p>The wait was the worst part. It was like waiting for his own execution. He’d read in one of Binns’ books that the Ministry used to line up murderous wizards to AK them one by one. He knew how those wizards felt. The panting fear. The dread. God, let it just be over!</p><p>When Remus started yelling, Sirius turned into Padfoot and backed away. Remus convulsed on the floor. His eyes rolled. His bones snapped and realigned. He howled. The pain overcame him, and on the other side: euphoria.</p><p>The werewolf and the dog left the Shack. They emerged from the tunnel, barking, howling. Their noses took them to the stag and rat. The four animals made strange company, but the werewolf didn’t care. He was elated; he was playful. Sometimes he tried to eat the rat.</p><p>The animals ran. They hunted. The werewolf was flying; he was invincible. He was pack leader. Even the dog knew not to challenge his authority.</p><p>The night was endless; it was as long as a heartbeat. The werewolf could survive anything with his friends at his side.     </p><p>

</p><p>When Remus woke up in the morning, his head was cradled in Sirius’ lap. He was surrounded by thick blankets, so he couldn’t really feel anything, but the proximity still made him gasp softly.</p><p>“Is the pain that bad?” Sirius asked. </p><p>Remus couldn’t answer. Sirius caressed his head; he pushed back his fringe gently; his fingers were so warm. Remus stared. He was too knackered to force himself to look away. Sirius stared back. His eyes were mesmerizing. </p><p>“Last night was a lot of fun.” Sirius smiled. “I think you ate a rabbit.”</p><p>“Good,” Remus whispered. </p><p>Sirius Conjured some water. He cleaned away dirt from Remus’ face with a corner of a blanket. Remus sighed. </p><p>“Where do you hurt most?” Sirius asked.</p><p>“My arms.”</p><p>Starting at his shoulder, Sirius massaged down Remus’ right arm. Remus winced and gasped; he moaned softly. Sirius lingered on his biceps; he pressed his thumbs into Remus’ palm; he caressed over his wrist. Remus quickly turned into goo. Sirius did the same for his left arm.</p><p>Remus touched the drying blood on his face. “I still hurt myself.”</p><p>“The wolf gets excited. He doesn’t know his own limits.” Sirius pulled down the blanket to check for gashes on Remus’ chest. Remus held his breath. He was too sleepy to control himself.</p><p>“Relax. I’m not trying to see your bits.” Sirius sounded amused.</p><p>“Too bad,” Remus murmured. He fell asleep.</p><p>The next thing he knew, he was in the hospital wing. Sometimes his mates levitated him from the Shack to the castle and this always made emotion well up in his chest: They really did care. Everything was dark and quiet, and Remus blinked against the gloom. There was rustling; somewhere in the shadows Sirius was asleep under the Invisibility Cloak. He liked to watch over Remus after bad transformations. He did the same after James suffered bad Quidditch injuries.</p><p>Remus remembered how Sirius had cradled his head, how he cleaned his face and whispered to him. Remus shivered. Oh, God.</p><p>He forced himself to sit up. Someone had thought to bring his school things. He Summoned his Transfiguration textbook and cast a <i>Lumos</i>. He couldn’t fall behind on his homework. He’d learned quickly that he needed to carry on after his transformations. His workload didn’t decrease just because he had an ailment of the howling kind.</p><p>He read until his eyes refused to focus. He fell asleep with the book open on his chest and his glowing wand hovering in the air.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Remus left the hospital wing early Monday. Sometimes he was able to leave the morning after a transformation, other times he was bedridden for an entire week. He could never predict the werewolf’s demand on his body.<p>He struggled through his classes. He wasn’t able to keep food down. His knees and shoulders ached; the gashes on his face fought off scabs. He just wanted his bed.</p><p>That night, he met Snape to track their potions. He knew he looked wrecked. There was no use in trying to hide his face. Snape stared. </p><p>“You’re not going to bleed on the potions, are you?”</p><p>Christ. He should’ve just stayed in the hospital wing. “No, I’m not, but if I have to bleed on anything, I’ll make sure it’s you.” </p><p>Snape snorted and stirred Potion A twice. He watched for any change, then scribbled some notes directly into his textbook. “Potion A is responding well to the Ashwinder Egg.”</p><p>“That’s great.” Remus could barely focus his eyes.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re all right?”</p><p>Blinking, Remus said, “No, not really.” He just wanted to rest his head on the table. Snape moved about him, but he didn’t take any notice. He attempted to examine the potions and write down some notes. Why did the room have to be so bright?</p><p>“Here,” Snape said, standing close. He had some fresh paste in his mortar. He dipped his fingers into the mixture and reached for Remus’ face, but then dropped his hand. He shoved the mortar to Remus. “Put this on your cuts. It’ll heal them in a couple of hours.”</p><p>Remus frowned at the paste. He smelled it. “You’re not trying to disfigure me, are you?”</p><p>“No,” Snape said, not looking at him. Remus, feeling a bit stupid, smeared some of the paste on his cuts. His skin tingled, the sting eased, and scabs began to form. He was amazed. He stared at Snape. </p><p>“Thank you,” he said, disturbed.</p><p>“Don’t mention it.” Snape fiddled with the potions, his head turned away.</p><p>Remus stood shakily and shouldered his heavy bag. “I’m going to leave early, if you don’t mind.”  </p><p>Snape turned back to him. He rolled his eyes. “You are such a moron.” He swished his wand and Remus’ bag slipped from his shoulder to levitate next to him. “I know your mum is a Muggle, but have some brains every once in a while.”</p><p>Remus didn’t know how to respond. He left. His walk back to the common room was slow, tedious, and his mind wandered to many things. What in the world was going on with Snape?</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Over the next two weeks, Remus didn’t see Snape outside class. Throughout the day, he checked the potions and made sure no one was tampering with them. Every time he ventured down to the dungeons Snape wasn’t there. He thought this distance would calm Sirius, but it didn’t. He just glared and said, “Let this whole mess be over.”<p>Remus tended to agree, though he did like tracking the potions’ progression. It looked like Potion A was the clear winner; it was amazing that adding a snake egg could create such a vibrant red. The other potions almost looked purple in comparison. Remus checked the textbook and his notes from all those damn library books: <i>Flore Pectora</i> was meant to be red, not purple. He sighed in relief.</p><p>One night, he didn’t leave immediately after visiting the potions. He cleared himself a workspace. He had a tricky DADA essay to finish, and it was very quiet in this part of the dungeons.</p><p>It also gave him time to think about Sirius. He fiddled with his quill, his eyes unfocused. It was like Sirius was two different people. He’d been so caring, so affectionate during the full moon that Remus had been convinced he was done holding this project against him. But he’d gone back to his sneering and hostile silence once Remus had recovered. That was how it’d always been with Sirius. There were times when he’d smile at Remus, touch his shoulder, stare into his eyes, and Remus would think: <i>Christ. Can it be true?</i> These moments never lasted. It was like Sirius was terrified to need anyone but himself. Remus shook his head. Sirius was blind to the power he had over people.</p><p>There was the sound of footsteps in the corridor. Remus turned in time to catch Snape come through the door. Snape startled but then quickly smoothed his expression.</p><p>“Oh, it’s you.”</p><p>Remus squinted. “You act like I have no business here.”</p><p>“Do you? Because from where I’m standing, I did most of the work.”</p><p>“No you didn’t!” Remus stood. He’d be ready if they were actually going to fight. “I’ve been checking on the potions daily! I even looked up what color they’re supposed to be!”</p><p>“You looked up the <i>color</i>? Wow. What sacrifice.” Snape closed the space between them.</p><p>Remus took a step back. “What crawled up your arse and died?”</p><p>“Your mum!” Snape yelled.</p><p>Remus pretended to faint. “Wow, ouch. You really got me.” He grabbed his bag. “I’m leaving. You can work through this tantrum alone.” He left the room, but Snape followed him into the corridor.</p><p>“Running away to see your <i>boyfriend</i>?”</p><p>Remus forced himself to laugh. “Who’s my boyfriend?”</p><p>“You know who I’m talking about.”</p><p>“No, I really don’t.”</p><p>Again, Snape tried to come closer. Remus moved away. “It seems like you two are in a lovers’ spat.”</p><p>Remus went cold. He knew it showed on his face. “You could be talking about anyone.”</p><p>“Black is giving you the old cold shoulder.”</p><p>“Christ, Snape. Do you watch me or something?” There was no possible way he could know.</p><p>“Do you think I have something to do with it? Do you think he could be <i>jealous</i>?” Snape smirked.    </p><p>“I don’t know why he’s acting like that,” Remus said. “We aren’t friends.”</p><p>Snape glared a little. “I suppose I’m not good enough to be your friend.”</p><p>“I’d never be friends with someone like you.”</p><p>Snape took out his wand. “Please, go on.”</p><p>“You know what the fuck I’m talking about.” Remus held his wand too.</p><p>“One day you will finally be fed up with being second best.”</p><p>Remus shook his head. “And maybe one day you will stop seeing yourself as such a victim.”</p><p>“Of course we are victims! This world is against us!” Snape pressed forward; he was breathing hard and his cheeks were flushed. He whispered: “<i>He</i> believes werewolves should have rights. He knows he can’t win without them.”</p><p>“How nice of him,” Remus said, utterly disgusted. He couldn’t believe Snape was talking to him about this.</p><p>“I’m not joking.” Snape was twitching; he was excited, and awkward, and seemed barely able to control himself. “Soon things are going to be different, and people like us will be united in glory!”</p><p>“You sound deranged,” Remus said, trying to back away. He collided with the wall; Snape came closer still. </p><p>“We both have secrets, don’t we?” Snape said quietly. </p><p>“I have loads of secrets. You’ll need to be more specific.”</p><p>Snape gulped thickly. “Secrets about what we want.”</p><p>“I want a lot of things.”</p><p>“Stop being so fucking coy. You know what I mean.”</p><p>“Do I?” He stared into Snape’s ugly face. Snape wanted something from him, and it felt nice not to give in, like he had something worthy to give.</p><p>Snape reached out, his hand hesitating. He touched a scar on Remus’ cheek; his fingers were cold but gentle. Remus didn’t know what to think.</p><p>There was a noise, a grunt or a gasp, and suddenly Snape was on his back, unconscious. There’d been a flash, a blink of light. Remus looked around wildly.</p><p>Sirius, chest beating hard, stood a few steps away, his wand pointed at Snape. Remus gaped, unable to speak. Sirius surged forward. He was sputtering. </p><p>“He—he was touching you!”</p><p>Remus gulped, then gulped again. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“I can’t believe—! You let him touch you!”</p><p>“Did you use the map to find me?”</p><p>“Don’t.” He clutched Remus’ shoulder and covered his face with his other hand. He was hiding from Remus.</p><p>Remus jerked away. “What the fuck, Sirius? Nothing was going on!” He was livid; he felt betrayed. He was tired of Sirius acting like an utter loon. </p><p>“You’re blind!” Sirius said. “You’re so fucking blind!”</p><p>Remus wanted to hit him. He had no idea, no bloody idea. Snape groaned and shifted on the floor.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here before he wakes up.” Sirius tugged him down the corridor; he refused to look at Remus. This made Remus even angrier. He shoved Sirius and stalked away. “Wait!”</p><p>“You are so stupid!” Remus yelled over his shoulder. Sirius grabbed him; Remus tried to punch him but missed.</p><p>“Remus,” Sirius said, and he didn’t sound like himself. He buried his hands in the front of Remus’ robes and pulled him closer. He kissed Remus, hard; his aim was off and his lips mostly landed on the corner of his mouth. </p><p>Remus froze, his mind slow to understand what was happening. Sirius pulled back, his eyes large. </p><p>“Sirius?” he said, unable to breathe.</p><p>“I’m sorry—I don’t—” Sirius ran away.</p><p>For a few minutes, Remus stood alone in the corridor, staring at nothing. Surely Sirius hadn’t meant to kiss him? He probably pulled Remus closer to shake some sense into him, then a mistake happened and their faces connected . . . .</p><p>No, that was ridiculous. Sirius had kissed him. He’d meant to kiss him. A <i>boy</i> had pressed his lips to his. Remus wandered to another part of the castle, too wrapped up in his thoughts to know where he was going. </p><p>Sirius had kissed him . . . but then he took off. He obviously regretted it. He was mortified. He probably did it for a laugh, but then saw Remus’ reaction and realized it was a terrible mistake. Realized that Remus was too bent to laugh with him.</p><p>He found an empty alcove and rested his head against the wall. He didn’t know what to think. His heart pounded. God, why had Sirius dashed away? Remus deserved answers; he deserved to know Sirius’ motives. It was the first kiss that’d meant something to him.</p><p>When he left the alcove, his hands were fisted at his sides. Sirius was probably hiding in his bed. He was probably with James, laughing, pretending nothing was wrong. Well, no matter. Remus headed to their dormitory to pay him a visit.</p><p>The other Marauders weren’t in the common room. Remus barreled through, uninterested in conversation. Lily raised her eyebrows at him.</p><p>He raced up the stairs and burst into their dormitory. His mates were crowded around a card game on James’ bed. Sirius jumped to his feet.</p><p>“James, Peter—out!” Remus said. </p><p>James and Peter looked at each other, then shuffled to the door. “Give him hell,” James said to Remus before disappearing with Peter.</p><p>Remus slammed the door shut and locked it. He closed in on Sirius. “You are such an arse!”</p><p>“I can explain!” Sirius held his hands up; his eyes were frantic.</p><p>“You bastard!” Remus poked him in the chest; he had so much to say to Sirius. “You’ve been a prat ever since I got paired with Snape, which I had no fucking control over. Then you—you follow me!”</p><p>“I was worried about you! Snape knows about your problem. He’s wanted to ruin you since the prank!”</p><p>“I can take care of myself! I don’t need you breathing down my neck every time I have to work with slimy Slytherins.”</p><p>Sirius’ eyes flashed. “He was touching you! I can’t believe you let him do that!”</p><p>“Why do you care!” Remus yelled.</p><p>“Because you’re my friend! You’re my <i>best</i> friend!”</p><p>Remus laughed. “I’m not your best friend. You fucking <i>worship</i> James.”</p><p>“No, I don’t!”</p><p>“Oh, come on! I’m not an idiot. It’s always been about you and James; Peter and I are just the extra.”</p><p>“That’s not true! That’s not fucking true!” Sirius looked scared; he looked on the verge of tears. He gulped and tried to catch his breath. “Remus—you must know by now.”</p><p>Remus stepped back. “Know what?”</p><p>Sirius closed the space between them. “What I did earlier—it wasn’t new.”</p><p>“It was pretty new to me.”</p><p>“Please don’t hate me.”</p><p>“God.” Remus shook his head. “You are such an idiot.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, okay? I just saw you with Snivellus and I—I didn’t think.”</p><p>Remus took a deep breath. “Why did you do it?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Sirius laughed shakily; he wouldn’t look at Remus. </p><p>“But you just said it wasn’t new.”</p><p>“I’m mad, okay? You should ignore me. We don’t have to ever talk about it.”</p><p>“I don’t want to ignore you.” Remus’ heart was beating so fast. </p><p>Sirius looked at him. “What do you mean?”</p><p><i>Just say it.</i> “I mean . . . I didn’t hate what you did.”</p><p>“You didn’t hate it?” Sirius had become very still. </p><p>Remus was blushing. He felt lightheaded. “I liked it.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I liked when you kissed me.”</p><p>“But—why?”</p><p>“Fuck off! I’m not saying it!”</p><p>Sirius grabbed his shoulders. He was trembling. “Tell me.”</p><p>Remus was trapped; he was suffocating. He wanted to wrap himself around Sirius and never let go. When he spoke, his voice was barely above a whisper. “I fancy you. I always have.”</p><p>“Merlin,” Sirius said, and he kissed Remus. Sirius was shaking so hard their teeth knocked together. He pulled away. “Sometimes I thought you felt the same but then you’d turn cold or run away. I thought maybe I was just freaking you out.”</p><p>“No, never,” Remus whispered. His hands roamed over Sirius’ shoulders, his arms, his chest. Could he really touch Sirius now?</p><p>He kissed Sirius, really kissed him, and Sirius made a noise in his throat. Encouraged, Remus rested his hand on the back of Sirius’ neck; it gave him leverage to control the kiss. He angled his head and brushed his tongue against Sirius’ lips. Sirius clutched at his shoulders but didn’t open his mouth. Remus kissed him and kissed him; he couldn’t wait any longer. He reached down and ran his hand over Sirius’ cock. He gasped. <i>Sirius was hard.</i></p><p>Sirius convulsed. He broke the kiss to tip his head back. Remus opened his palm to his cock, rubbing.</p><p>“God, Remus,” Sirius whispered. </p><p>“Does that feel good?” Remus asked.</p><p>
  <i>“Yes.”</i>
</p><p>Remus tried to undo his trousers. Sirius grabbed his hand.</p><p>“No, please. Not yet.”</p><p>“Okay, but can I—I just—” Remus wanted to feel his bare skin. Somehow he got his hand under Sirius’ shirt; his stomach was warm, trembling. He licked and sucked Sirius’ neck; Sirius pulled away. </p><p>“So much sensation,” Sirius gasped.</p><p>“Yeah.” Remus was burning up. This might be the only chance he had to touch Sirius. He tried to put his hands on Sirius again, but Sirius held him off.</p><p>“Let’s slow down.”</p><p>“I’ve made a fool of myself,” Remus said, trying to laugh. </p><p>Of course Sirius was stopping him. He was just playing; he didn’t really want Remus.</p><p>Sirius covered his face. “I’m the one mucking it up. I think I’m panicking.”</p><p>“I won’t touch you again.”</p><p>“No!” Sirius grabbed his shoulders; his expression was pleading. “Please just understand. Don’t make me say it.”</p><p>“I do understand! Nothing has to change because of this.”</p><p>“Stop talking.” Sirius pulled him into a hug and buried his face in Remus’ shoulder. He whispered: “You terrify me.”</p><p>Remus pressed his nose to Sirius’ hair. God, he smelled amazing. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I want you,” Sirius said.</p><p>Remus shivered. “Are you sure?”</p><p>Sirius kissed his check. “Be patient with me.”</p><p>“I’ve done something wrong. You can be honest with me.”</p><p>“I am being honest. There’s a problem with me, not you.”</p><p>Remus framed his face. He caressed his cheeks with his thumbs. He knew he was being a bit girly, but it was what he fucking wanted. “I think you’re perfect.”</p><p>“You have no idea.” Sirius shook his head. “Remus—God.”</p><p>“What do we do now?”</p><p>“We go downstairs and join our mates.”</p><p>Remus gulped. “Do we not say anything?”</p><p>“James already knows.”</p><p>“He knows?” Remus gaped.</p><p>“But the shock might kill poor Wormtail.”</p><p>“So we don’t say anything.”</p><p>“Not yet.” Sirius searched his face. “Is that all right?”</p><p>“Yeah . . . I think I prefer that. For now.”</p><p>Sirius tucked his shirt back into his trousers. They made it to the staircase before Remus whispered, “Wait. Just one more kiss.”</p><p>“Okay.” Sirius grinned.</p><p>Remus brushed his lips against Sirius’, then stepped back. “See. I can be patient.”</p><p>Down in the common room, James looked up from the game of chess he was playing with Peter. “How’s the new couple?” he announced loudly.</p><p>“James—<i>what the fuck?</i>” Sirius hissed.</p><p>“Did you just snog?” Peter asked them.</p><p>“Umm . . . yeah,” Sirius said, glancing at Remus. Peter looked impressed.</p><p>“Lucky,” James sighed. “Evans still won’t give me the time of day.”</p><p>“We know,” Remus said.</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. “Yeah, maybe it’s because you’re an outing prat.”</p><p>“Calm down! Nobody else heard.” James sat back down to his game. Remus and Sirius lowered to the floor to watch. Every now and then, Sirius rubbed his little finger along a hidden part of Remus’ thigh. Remus shivered. He couldn’t believe this was reality.</p>

</center>The final week of the Potions project was frustrating. Remus rarely saw Snape, but he knew he had a target on his back. The first incident happened when Remus was on his way to Charms; someone came up behind him and shoved him so hard he toppled forward. He looked around, bewildered. No one was near him. The following morning, Remus opened his daily copy of the <i>Prophet</i> and burning green sludge spilled all over his hands. He had to visit the hospital wing for the cure. He was afraid. Snape had promised Dumbledore that he’d keep Remus’ condition a secret, but obviously Remus had crossed some sort of line. Snape could ruin his life if he wanted.<p>Remus looked for Snape. He waited by their potions but Snape never showed. He wandered the dungeons; he checked every aisle in the library. He took out their handy map and tried spotting his dot. Snape was nowhere to be found. Avery, Mulciber, and a few other Slytherins were missing too. He put away the map, refusing to think about where they’d gone. </p><p>He went up to his bed and found Sirius under the duvet. “Waiting for me?” Remus asked. It was easy to push Snape from his mind when Sirius was <i>in his bed</i>.</p><p>“Yeah,” Sirius whispered. “I told Prongs and Wormtail to get lost.”</p><p>“How thoughtful of you.” Remus pulled off his robes and kicked away his shoes. He slipped in next to Sirius. “God, you’ve made my sheets all warm.”</p><p>“Remus,” Sirius said, and kissed him. Their lips moved together slowly; Remus twisted his hands in Sirius’ shirt, letting him set the pace. “I’ve wanted to do that all day.”</p><p>“It kills me to sit next to you in class and not be able to touch you.”</p><p>Sirius smirked. “Good.” He kissed down to Remus’ neck and sucked. Remus gasped and arched up. Sirius laughed and sucked harder. “I want to ask you something.”</p><p>Remus pulled back to look at him. He still couldn’t believe he was in bed with <i>Sirius Black</i>. He knew about ten girls who’d die from jealousy. He touched Sirius’ wet lips, his high cheekbones. “You can ask me anything.”</p><p>“It’s selfish of me.” Sirius hesitated; he was blushing. “I want to . . . see you. I want to touch you . . . but I don’t want you to see or touch me.”</p><p>Remus frowned. It took him a moment to understand. “Are you saying you want me to take off my clothes?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Sirius wouldn’t meet his eyes. “You don’t have to if you’re uncomfortable. I just wanted to ask.”</p><p>Gulping, he whispered, “I’ve got scars.”</p><p>“I know. I’ve seen them.”</p><p>Remus shook his head. “I don’t want to scare you.”</p><p>“They won’t scare me.” Sirius kissed his neck again. “You’re beautiful.”</p><p>“You’re the beautiful one.” Remus paused, his heart racing. “Okay, I’ll do it.” He began unbuttoning his shirt but Sirius stopped him.</p><p>“Let me.” Sirius kissed his knuckles. “Your poor hands. I hope Pomfrey was able to help you.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine now.” Remus tried to quiet his breath. Sod his hands. He could be bleeding out and still not want to end this moment.</p><p>Sirius got his shirt unbuttoned, then slipped it from his shoulders. Remus was wearing a vest top, and it took some time for them to get it over his head. When his chest was bare, he laid back and tried not to cross his arms. Sirius’ eyes were dark. He dragged his hand along Remus’ stomach, then moved up to his nipples. He didn’t touch them, just stared. Remus was restless; he quickly unbuttoned his trousers and pulled them down to his knees. If they were going to do this, then they needed to just <i>do it</i>. He couldn’t handle the wait.</p><p>Sirius stared. Remus was hard. Of course he was hard; but his heart was thumping so fast he could barely feel it. With a single finger, Sirius traced the bulge in Remus’ pants. Okay, now he could feel it. He arched up, needing more. He wanted to say something but he knew he’d stutter. </p><p>“Can I take off your pants?” Sirius whispered. Remus nodded. Gently, Sirius eased his pants down, revealing his erection. Remus couldn’t look. He squeezed his eyes shut and turned his face away. <i>Breathe</i>, he told himself.</p><p>Sirius didn’t say anything, but Remus heard his panting. He touched Remus’ thigh and Remus jerked. Sirius snatched his hand away. “Sorry.”</p><p>“No—don’t stop,” Remus said.</p><p>Sirius trailed his fingers along his cock; Remus gasped and thrust up. “I can’t believe this is happening,” Sirius said.</p><p>“Put your hand around me; stroke me,” Remus said, desperate.</p><p>There was brief hesitation. Then Sirius wrapped his hand around his cock; he stroked Remus slowly. Remus bit down hard on his lip.</p><p>“Is this all right?”</p><p>“It’s a bit dry,” Remus said.</p><p>“Oh.” Sirius took his hand away. He reached for his wand. “I know a spell.”</p><p>Remus huffed a laugh. “We all know that spell.”</p><p>Sirius laughed too. He pointed his wand at his cupped hand and muttered the incantation. His hand filled with lube. “Look at me,” he whispered. </p><p>Taking a deep breath, Remus looked at him. Sirius leaned over him, his expression both worried and excited. He let some of the lube drip from his palm to Remus’ cock; he stroked Remus, slowly, then picking up speed. Remus’ mouth fell open; he couldn’t look away from Sirius’ glistening fist and the reddened head of his own cock. He was going to explode; he was going to <i>die</i>.</p><p>“Kiss me,” Remus said, throwing an arm over Sirius’ shoulders. Sirius kissed him, their lips struggling to synch up. Sirius twisted his wrist; he dragged his thumb over the tip. Remus panted into his mouth.</p><p>“You’re so bloody hard in my hand,” Sirius whispered, and that did it: Remus came without warning; he jerked back, crying out, splattering the space between them. </p><p>“Fuck!” He was mortified and still riding out his orgasm. He was sure Sirius would <i>laugh</i> at him.</p><p>Sirius kissed his cheek, then the center of his chest. He raised his hand and stared at the come webbing his fingers. </p><p>“Here—I’ll clean you up,” Remus said, his face burning. </p><p>Sirius sucked a finger into his mouth, his eyes falling shut. He moaned softly. </p><p>“Christ—I can’t believe—” Remus kissed him desperately, tasting himself.</p><p>“That was brilliant,” Sirius said. “I promise next time I’ll let you see me.”</p><p>“You don’t have to promise me anything,” Remus said, but he was already thinking about <i>next time</i>. “We should clean up and let our mates back in.”</p><p>“Sod them,” Sirius said, stretching, his hair ruffled. Remus laughed.</p><p>Later that night, he sent Snape a note. <i>Stop avoiding me. I need to talk to you. Meet me TOMORROW before breakfast. I’ll be with the potions.</i> He sent the note off, not really expecting Snape to show up. It was worth a try.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Remus woke up late the next morning. He aimed some cleaning spells at himself, carded his fingers through his hair, and threw on his school robes. He dashed to the dungeons. He arrived at their temporary lab and found Snape waiting for him.<p>“What’s the emergency?” Snape asked, his expression vicious.</p><p>It took a moment for Remus to catch his breath. He hadn’t expected to see Snape, but now he had to make the most of the opportunity. </p><p>“Please don’t tell anyone about my . . . condition.”</p><p>Snape’s face darkened further. “Why would I do that?”</p><p>“Because you have a grudge! I know it was you who shoved me and put that sludge in my newspaper.”</p><p>“I don’t know anything about that.”</p><p>Remus raised his eyebrows. “You’re lying.”</p><p>Snape threw his head back and laughed. “Oh, Lupin. What a child you are. I don’t have <i>time</i> to plan such immature pranks.”</p><p>“I know it was you!”</p><p>Snape moved closer. He stared at Remus’ neck. “That’s quite the love bite. You’ll want to cover that up or people might want to know which <i>girl</i> gave it to you.”</p><p>“I don’t have anything to hide,” Remus said, trying to sound casual.</p><p>“Who’s the liar now?” Snape shook his head, a little sarcastic smile curving his lips. “Honestly, I don’t care enough to share your secrets. The world is quickly changing, and I’m set to be one of the conquerors.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“I don’t need to explain. You already know.” Snape touched Remus’ hand with his wand. Remus yanked back, which made Snape laugh. “I feel sorry for you. You think everything’s going to turn out fine if you stand with Potter and Black, but they will desert you once they see the darkness inside you.”</p><p>Remus frowned. “They already know about my lycanthropy.”</p><p>“There’ll come a time when we are winning, when Dumbledore’s lot is desperate and in need of a scapegoat, and they will turn on you. It’s inevitable.”</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense.”</p><p>Snape licked his lips. He reached out like he wanted to touch Remus, but then dropped his hand. “We have a lot in common.”</p><p>“Impossible. I wash my hair.”</p><p>“Laugh all you want now. One day you’ll know I’m right. I just hope it’s not too late.”</p><p>“We have nothing in common. I’m not a bigot. I don’t want people murdered.”</p><p>Snape cocked his head. “What about Fenrir Greyback?”</p><p>Remus flinched at the name. “I want him in Azkaban.”</p><p>“Ha! You Gryffindors. Always confusing weakness with morality. You’re a <i>coward</i>, Lupin.”</p><p>“I rather be a coward than a murderer.” He was tired of Snape’s vague references. “You’ve been gone for a few days. Did you murder Muggles? Did you sneak up on unsuspecting Ministry officials and promise to kill their families if they didn’t join your side?”</p><p>“Perhaps.” Snape smirked.</p><p>“You disgust me. I rather be dead than have that on my conscience.”</p><p>“I read somewhere that over seventy-five percent of werewolves will accidently kill someone on a full moon. Who do you think will be your first kill?”</p><p>Remus punched him. Snape stumbled back, holding his face; his gaze darted to the potions.</p><p>“Lily is a thousand times better off without you in her life.”</p><p>Snape attacked him with his bare hands. He clawed at Remus’ face; he tried to knee him in the groin. Remus punched him in the stomach; he got his hands around Snape’s neck and <i>squeezed</i>. Snape tried to kick at him. They toppled to the hard floor.</p><p>“Strangle me, you coward! I dare you!” Snape choked.</p><p>Remus shook him. “After tomorrow, I don’t want to ever speak to you again. I don’t want you to even look at me!”</p><p>“Like I’d ever want to be associated with a poof!”</p><p>Remus released him and stood. He thought he knew how that sentence was going to end, but he was wrong. He couldn’t stand that Snape sensed his sexuality. It was laughable that Snape thought he had insight into Remus, but calling him an offensive term took it to a whole new level. </p><p>“Tomorrow, we’ll turn in our potion and receive top marks,” Remus said. “After that, if you even look at me, I’ll Hex your bollocks off.”</p><p>Snape laughed hoarsely. He was still on the floor; his neck was all red from Remus’ squeezing. “When the war is over and all your friends are dead, you will be on your hands and knees for me.”</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes and left.</p>
<p></p><center>

</center>Slughorn loved a show. The next morning, he spent the entire lesson moving from potion to potion, testing the consistency and color, but also looking for some mysterious extra component. Remus’ feet hurt. He was tired of standing next to their potion, waiting for Slughorn to get over himself. Snape was motionless next to him.<p>“I must say this is a hard decision,” Slughorn said. He glanced from Snape to Lily; he turned to Lily. “Congratulations, my girl. Your potion is the best out of the bunch. Please tell the class how you did it!”</p><p>“We used Ashwinder Eggs, Professor,” she said, beaming. Sirius winked at Remus. </p><p>Snape stormed off. Avery and Mulciber followed him. Only a few students looked surprised. Slughorn watched them leave and didn’t say anything.</p><p>When class was dismissed, Remus approached Sirius and Lily in the corridor. “I can’t believe you beat me,” he said. “We used those eggs too!”</p><p>Lily flipped her hair. “Silly boys. Perhaps one day you’ll accept I’m the best.” Remus laughed fondly.</p><p>“James already thinks you’re the best,” Sirius said.</p><p>“I told you not to talk to me about him.”</p><p>Sirius shrugged. “You said not to bring him up while we were brewing. We’re not brewing anymore.”</p><p>“I’m walking away now,” she said over her shoulder. </p><p>Sirius turned to Remus. He lowered his voice. “What’s my prize for winning?”</p><p>“What do you want?” Remus’ stomach fluttered. </p><p>“You starkers in my bed tonight.”</p><p>“We’ll need to bribe our friends.”</p><p>Sighing, Sirius said, “Do you think chocolate will do it?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>They reunited with Peter to walk to lunch. </p><p>“What will it take for you to avoid the dormitory tonight?” Sirius asked.</p><p>Peter groaned. “Why can’t you wank each other in a cupboard or something?”</p><p>“Christ, Peter,” Remus said, choking back laughter.</p><p>“I’ll do your Potions homework,” Sirius said. “Slughorn just said my potion was the best, so . . .”</p><p>“Deal.” Peter thought for a moment. “I also want some of your Cockroach Clusters.”</p><p>“Fine,” Sirius said. He touched Remus’ side and whispered, “Can’t wait for tonight.” Remus shivered.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>The day moved at a snail’s pace. Remus could barely sit still in his remaining classes. He was going to finally see Sirius without his clothes. Oh, God.<p>Rumors about Snape, Avery, and Mulciber storming from Potions made its rounds. People wondered if they would leave school entirely. Remus couldn’t bring himself to care. He didn’t care about anything outside his date in the dormitory.</p><p>At dinner, Remus and Sirius didn’t look at each other. James smirked. Peter covered his mouth to muffle a laugh. When they stood to leave, James made quiet kissing noises. He wiggled his fingers at them. “Have fun!”</p><p>With most students still eating, the common room was quiet and nearly empty. Their dormitory was even quieter.</p><p>They sat on Remus’ bed. He kissed Sirius softly and let him control the pace of everything. He’d learned from last time.</p><p>“Help me undress,” Sirius said.</p><p>They got Sirius’ clothes off. He was beautiful, utterly perfect. He was long and pale, with not a scar in sight. Remus was almost speechless.</p><p>“I want you to put your fingers in me,” Sirius whispered.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I can’t stop thinking about it.”</p><p><i>“What?”</i> Remus blinked at him. “Are you sure? I don’t want to hurt you.”</p><p>“I’m sure.” Sirius smiled a little.</p><p>“I don’t—I’ve never—” Remus took a trembling breath.</p><p>Sirius turned his face away. “I’ve already cast some spells in preparation.”</p><p>“What spells? How do you know about these spells?”</p><p>“I was curious. Last summer, James helped me find some books.”</p><p>“James! I can’t believe you told him before me. No, scratch that, it makes sense that you did, but it’s still stupid.”</p><p>“It was safe to tell him. It wasn’t safe to tell you.”</p><p>Remus played with his nipples. Sirius closed his eyes and leaned into the touch. “Why wasn’t it safe to tell me?”</p><p>“Because I fancy you,” Sirius gasped. “You prat.”</p><p>Remus kissed his shoulder, smiling against his skin. “I just wanted to hear you say it again.”</p><p>Sirius kissed him. He whispered, “I fancy you.” He guided Remus’ hand between his thighs to his hole. “I fancy you so much that I want your fingers in me.”</p><p>Remus had to close his eyes. He was touching Sirius’ <i>arsehole</i>. It was warm, a little <i>wet</i>; it twitched against his finger.</p><p>“Push it inside me,” Sirius said, squirming. “I promise I can take it.”</p><p>He caressed Sirius some more, trying to gather the courage; then he pressed forward and the flesh actually gave way. “Christ,” Remus said. “You already got lube inside you.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Sirius twisted on his finger. “I can take more.”</p><p>Remus moved his finger in and out; he could barely focus. Sirius was so fucking warm and tight. “Do you finger yourself a lot?”</p><p>“Define a lot,” Sirius said, which made Remus moan. He couldn’t handle it: Sirius stuck his fingers in his own arse. Remus added a second finger, maybe a little too quickly, because Sirius flinched.</p><p>“All right?” he whispered.</p><p>Sirius nodded. “Use more lube.”</p><p>Remus gently withdrew and whispered the spell. When he thrust back in, Sirius was incredibly slick. Remus fucked him quickly, gaining confidence; Sirius shuddered and clutched at his shoulders.</p><p>“More,” Sirius said.</p><p>Nodding, Remus added a third finger. He couldn’t look away. Sirius was taking his fingers; he couldn’t believe his little hole was able to stretch that much.</p><p>God, oh God. He wanted to fuck Sirius. He wanted to squeeze his cock into his little hole; he wanted to feel Sirius’ body clutch him, pull him deeper, as he took his pleasure.</p><p>“I want—” Remus gulped.</p><p>“Do it.” Sirius was panting, his face pink. “I want to feel you inside me.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Remus asked, dreading the answer. He’d never wanted anything more in his life.</p><p>“Moony,” Sirius whispered, and spread his thighs wider. “Shag me.”</p><p>Remus pulled his fingers out. He undressed, trembling. He conjured up more lube and smeared his cock. His erection had flagged a bit as he fingered Sirius, but now he was fully, achingly hard. Sirius was almost flaccid. Remus tried to stroke him but Sirius pulled his hand away.</p><p>“No, too much sensation.”</p><p>“Okay,” Remus breathed. He pushed Sirius’ thighs even further apart. He got into position. “Ready?”</p><p>Sirius’ chest beat up and down. “I think so.”</p><p>Remus thrust inside; it was both harder and easier than what he’d imagined. Sirius was alarmingly tight; this wasn’t safe; he had to be hurting Sirius. Remus tried to ease in more but there was too much lube; he thrust and popped through Sirius’ ring of muscle.</p><p>“Fuck!” Sirius arched up, his hands clawing at Remus’ arms.</p><p>Remus panted against Sirius’ neck.</p><p>“Fuck, this hurts,” Sirius said, trembling. “Fuck, fuck.”</p><p>Remus tried pulling out, but Sirius cried out. Remus was going to come. Sirius shifted beneath him, his arse twitching and bearing down. He was going to come and hurt Sirius even more.</p><p>“Sirius,” he whined.</p><p>“Give me a minute,” Sirius said, and kissed him. They panted into each other’s mouths.</p><p>Without thinking about it, Remus moved his hips. Sirius pressed his face to the bedding, his expression tense. He pulled back and thrust back in; his thighs trembled from the effort. He couldn’t believe he was <i>inside</i> Sirius Black; he was fucking one of his closest friends, the boy he’d fantasized about <i>for years</i>. He was fucking the arse of the fittest boy in school.</p><p>“Okay, I’m ready,” Sirius said. He raised his legs and urged Remus deeper.</p><p>Remus thrust in earnest, their flesh smacking together. Sirius’ arse opened up to him, allowing him to move harder, faster. Christ. Sirius was perfect; he was pure blooded and rich; he was tall and elegant and had no blemishes. And he’d let Remus fuck him. He’d let a werewolf inside his body. He gasped and moaned as a poor, half-blood <i>monster</i> defiled him. Remus came hard, suddenly, his whole body arching into it. He thought: <i>Who’s the conqueror now?</i></p><p>When Remus calmed down, he pulled out gently and laid beside Sirius. “Are you in pain?” he asked.</p><p>Sirius tried to hide a wince. “Yeah, but I think it’s going to be okay.” His cock was only a little harder from when they began. Remus gathered some lube from his thighs and stroked him. Sirius hissed and tried to jerk away. He covered Remus’ fist with his own.</p><p>“Am I not doing it right?” Remus asked.</p><p>“I just want to control it.” He moved their fists up and down his cock; his mouth fell open. When he saw Remus gazing at him, he pulled a pillow over his face. “I don’t think I can come with you looking at me.”</p><p>“Okay,” Remus said. He watched Sirius’ cock move through their fingers, red, glistening, so very desperate. With his other hand, he reached down to feel Sirius’ used hole. Sirius moaned loudly. Emboldened, Remus pressed a finger inside, stroking, caressing.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck—” Sirius cried into the pillow covering his face; he was coming, his cock twitching and spilling over their hands.</p><p>Remus eased his finger out and cleaned his hands. He took the pillow away from Sirius’ face. Sirius stared at him, dazed, breathing heavily.</p><p>“Was it good?” Remus asked, smiling widely.</p><p>It took a moment for Sirius to answer. “Yeah,” he panted. He pulled Remus into a hug; Remus rested his head on his shoulder and sighed deeply. They didn’t talk for a while.</p><p>“We wasted so much time,” Sirius said.</p><p>“You should have just told me.” Remus drew shapes on his chest. “I was the first person James told about fancying Lily. Not that it was a big secret or anything. Even Peter has confided in me. But you . . . you rarely trust me with secrets.”</p><p>“You don’t understand how I was raised. It’s hard for me to let people in.”</p><p>“You’ve let James in.”</p><p>“James is like a brother to me.”</p><p>Remus raised his head to look at Sirius. “Aren’t I like a brother to you, too?”</p><p>“Merlin, I hope not!”</p><p>“You know what I mean. I want you to trust me like you trust James.”</p><p>“I do.” Sirius looked away.</p><p>Sighing, Remus laid back down. “I can’t believe we go to school with Death Eaters.”</p><p>“Wow, this is great bedroom talk.”</p><p>“I know you’ve been thinking about it!”</p><p>“I don’t want to think about it. Not here. Not with you.”</p><p>Remus ran his hand over Sirius’ smooth, unscarred chest. “I want you to know that, whatever happens, I will always have your back.”</p><p>“Stop talking like that.”</p><p>There was banging on the door. “Open up!” James yelled. “Evans challenged me to a game of chess and I need my lucky underpants!”</p><p>“No luck will save you!” Sirius yelled back. “Face your fate like a man!”</p><p>James made an angry noise and stormed off. Laughing, Remus said, “We could’ve let him in.”</p><p>“No way. I’ve already sacrificed too much for him.” Sirius kissed Remus.</p>
