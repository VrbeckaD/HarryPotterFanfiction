    <p> </p><p> </p><p>Three years ago the brutal murder that ended the life of the entire Marks family took place. Throughout the morning family members, friends, neighbors and different people have been coming to Downing Street to leave candles and memories in their memory. The number 110 of Downing Street has become, once again, an altar to let them know that they are still present in us.</p><p align="right">

</p><p> <em>The service in remembrance for the Marks family has been in the quiet and the old parish of St. Dunstan, one of the first parishes in London that today has been closed to the public and cancelled all visits.</em></p><p>
  <em>Journalists and television cameras have been forced to stay at least ten meters away because the family has asked for privacy and respect. Behind the fences, next to us, many people from different parts of London have gathered to bring them, although from afar, warmth and support to the Marks family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>At the exit, before getting into the car, they stopped a few minutes to thank all the support they still receive.</em>

</p><p> <em>The Marks family was found dead three years ago in their own home. It had been days since anyone knew absolutely anything about any of them when the neighbors began to worry and decided to call the police. They did not go to work, the children were missing classes, they did not answer the phone, they did not answer the messages, the dog had stopped going for a walk, the blinds were not raised or lowered, they were always in the same position, the light wasn’t switch on at night or off when they went to sleep, there was no noise from inside. It was as if they had disappeared suddenly. The big surprise came when the door was thrown to the ground.</em></p><p>
  <em>Of all the theories that were on the table, this was the least desired of all. They had been brutally murdered.</em>

</p><p>  <em>T</em><em>he murderer of the Marks family, all Muggles, has been behind bars for three years. Finally, and after many conversations between the Muggle Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of the Magic World, the murderer has passed to the aurors; until now he was in a high security muggle prison.</em></p><p>
  <em>In the Muggle world, the investigation was finalized a year ago and a few months ago there was a final sentence declaring him guilty and with a penalty of life imprisonment, the lawyer managed to save him, with his clever plea, from the death penalty. This has made it easier for him to be transferred to Azkaban.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Until now the investigation by the aurors and the scientific teams of the Ministry had been rendered impotent by the impossibility of not being able to do anything. The investigation was at rest. Now, with the murderer locked up and under his surveillance, they can resume the investigation.</em>

</p><p> <em>Why did he do it? How he do it? These are the main questions that come to mind when we think about the murder of the Marks family. Another question that comes to mind is if he is a monster or if he is crazy, we do not conceive that a person in his right mind can kill children in cold-blooded, babies. We also wonder if he repents, if he can sleep at night, if the ghosts chase him. We wonder what has happened so that person we knew so well, everyone, has done this atrocity. And many of us hope that he was under the influence of the Imperius curse.</em></p><p>
  <em>For now, we have to wait. There is no answer to any of these questions. The Muggle authorities and the Muggle police have transferred all the information they have about the case to the aurors. We hope little by little to begin to have information and, above all, answers.</em>

</p><p> <em>Finally the transfer has taken place; James Sirius Potter, the murderer of the Marks family, is in Azkaban. The transfer occurred very early this morning, before the sun had awakened.</em></p><p>
  <em>For a few days there has been a question that has haunted my mind, how could he been in Muggle prison so long and not escaped? Muggle prisons are not trained to retain wizards with the ability to appear.</em>
