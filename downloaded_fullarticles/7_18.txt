    <p>James Moriarty silently walked through the boring little town that was Little Whinging. Honestly, people said he was insane, but anyone that would willingly live in a place like this was crazy on a level even he couldn’t comprehend.</p><p>He had joined a bridge club in the area a few weeks ago in the hopes of distracting him. Lately he had been so bored he was considering doing something even he hadn’t thought himself capable of in his games with Sherlock. He had thought of using a child in their games to up the anti. James may be a psychotic murderer, but even he had limits. He hadn’t killed a kid since he had been one, and even then the boy had been older than him.</p><p>The reason he was walking was because his new driver had been late. Now he was going to need to get another new driver as this one was going to be dead shortly. He had already called Sebastian to retrieve his driver as well as come and pick him up.</p><p>Just as he was thinking of all the fun and creative ways he could kill his driver he caught sight of something that was odd, even to him.</p><p>An extremely small child had just looked both ways before crossing the street towards the park. It was only March, it was still cold at night and the boy was only wearing a baggy shirt and shorts, he didn’t even have any shoes on.</p><p>Being who he was he could never leave questions unanswered so he followed the small boy. He could tell the boy had noticed his presence as he slowed down and headed towards a bench where he jumped up and took a seat.</p><p>“Hello kitten.” Moriarty said as he sat down on the bench next to him. He didn’t have much, or any, experience with young children so he wasn't even sure if the boy was old enough to talk.</p><p>“Why are you following me?”</p><p>Moriarty gave the boy an interested look. He appeared to only be a toddler but he spoke with perfect diction in full sentences, Moriarty might not know about kids, but he knew enough to know that wasn't normal.</p><p>“I was wondering about why you were out so late, but I think I can guess.” Up close the evidence was clear. There was clear bruising on the boys arms and throat. The way he sat it was obvious his back was injured in some way, Moriarty assumed whip marks from a belt. His eyes were also slightly out of focus and he seemed to have a headache indicating a concussion. “What’s your name kitten?</p><p>“Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia call me freak or boy. Ms. Figg calls me Harry.” The boy now identified as Harry told him.</p><p>Looking closer at those unfocused eyes Moriarty saw it. He had only met one person with eyes so green. In another life, when he was only 8 years old, the child Moriarty had once been had gone to visit his elder cousin, Severus Snape.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Lily Evans had been the first person other then Severus he had met who’s intelligence had even come close to rivalling his own, and Severus hadn’t counted to his mind since he was family. She hadn’t quite been on his level, but she had been close. At the end of the weekend he had gone home with a healthy respect for the girl, and a broken nose.</p><p>Reaching out, hesitating for a moment when he saw the way the boy flinched back, he moved the childs hair off his forehead. As he had expected a lightning bolt shaped scar was hidden by the dark locks, it still looked like it hadn’t fully healed even though he knew it had been over 2 years.</p><p>“You know something.” Harry stated bluntly. “You know me, but I don’t know you.”</p><p>“How can you tell?” Moriarty asked.</p><p>“It’s obvious. You were already sure I would have a scar even as you reached to check. You also seemed to recognize something familiar in my eyes when you look at me.” Harry told the man.</p><p>Moriarty smiled, it would seem the young boy had inherited his mums intelligence. “Yes, I know who you are. I met your mother once when we were children, she was one of the few people I have ever had any form of respect for. You have her eyes.”</p><p>“And the scar?” Harry cocked his head. “Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon say I got it from the car accident that killed them, but I know they are lying. Something is wrong with how they treat me. As much as they hate me… They fear me more for some reason. I think it has something to do with the odd things that happen around me.”</p><p>“Noticed that have you.” Moriarty gave a devious smile.</p><p>“Last week Aunt Petunia gave me a haircut. I was almost bald by the end, except for my bangs to cover the scar. But my hair had grown back by morning.” Harry told him.</p><p>Moriarty went on to explain to the young child about magic. During his explanation his second in command Sebastian Moran arrived with his car. Rather than going home Moriarty got them a room at a local motel and had ordered them some food.</p><p>When the tale was done and Harry was picking at his first ever piece of pizza he still wasn't satisfied. “But that still doesn’t explain your recognition of my scar.”</p><p>And that resulted in even more explaining. By the end of that Harry was laying in an actual bed. It had taken Moriarty a bit of work to convince him it was ok for him to be on the furniture but once he understood he wouldn’t be punished for it Harry had relaxed.</p><p>“Kitten, what are your plans for tomorrow?”</p><p>“I have to be at the back door by dawn to be let back inside. I have to make breakfast for everyone and pack a lunch for Uncle Vernon. It’s a Thursday so Aunt Petunia will be taking Dudley to a local play group and won’t be back until 3 so I don’t have to make them lunch. I will be locked in my cupboard until it’s time for me to make dinner.” Harry told him matter of factly.</p><p>“I will be at your place for lunch and we can make some plans for what is to come.” Moriarty said thoughtfully. “You will not be staying with those people for much longer, but it will take time for me to get you away.”</p><p>Moriarty was sure that there would be all kinds of magic to keep the boy stuck in the area or would alert someone if he was away for an extended period of time. He was going to have to work around it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>As he lay down to sleep Moriarty was pleased with the turn of events, he wasn't bored anymore.</p><p> </p>
