    <p>Sirius Black wasn't sure how he felt about Hogwarts. On one hand, it presented him with the freedom from his parents that he had always desired, on the other hand, he knew that he was going to end up in Slytherin, as everyone in his family did, and he wasn't overtly ecstatic for that. And he was still on the train.</p>
<p>He had just gotten on the train, in fact. His parents had hardly bothered to even drop him off. Rather they left him outside the train station and told him that if he couldn't figure out how the platform worked he'd best just not come home. Thankfully, he had figured it out after observing a few other students and had gotten onto the train with plenty of time to spare.</p>
<p>The only people that Sirius knew were those who's parents were friends with his and whom he knew to be unpleasant, so he avoided them, choosing instead to find an empty compartment and settling in alone. He should've figured that eventually other students would join him, but he hadn't really thought of it, nor had he thought of the possibility of actually making some friends. And of course it didn't happen very simply. The first of his new friends that he met was a certain Remus Lupin.</p>
<p>Remus Lupin walked hurriedly through the hallways of the train, looking for an empty compartment and trying to avoid eye contact. He could just feel the stares of the other students. Some pitying, as he was probably in the most tattered robes to ever exist outside of a garbage disposal and also painfully thin, especially for his height, which was great considering that he was only eleven, some curious, as he was walking quite quickly and seemed to be trying to shrink into himself, which was amusing to watch considering his height, and some targeting, because, although, as previously stated, Remus Lupin was tall for his age, he was thin and nervous and a prime target for a certain group of third year Slytherin boys. Those very third year Slytherin boys decided that it would be great fun to gang up on Remus Lupin and decidedly did so. And it would have gone well for them, as Remus made no attempt to defend himself or escape (perhaps he thought that that would make them get bored and leave, but it only encouraged them), however they had chosen an unideal location to beat him up at. Directly outside of the compartment that Sirius was sitting in.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the sound of Remus being slammed up against the glass door of his compartment, Sirius looked up from the window that he had been glancing out of. Once he had assessed what was happening, he sprang up and yanked open the compartment door. The Slytherin boys looked up, startled, but after a moment one of them finally seemed to recognize him</p>
<p>"Hold on a second. Is that Black? Sirius Black? Finally at Hogwarts are you, huh? Well join in mate!" He encouraged.</p>
<p>Sirius shook with anger at that. The idea of being grouped with people like that infuriated him. He pulled out his wand and, as the other boys mistook it for him joining them and let down their guard, Sirius Black petrified all three of them. The three Slytherin boys stood frozen and wide-eyed, as did Remus Lupin, in fact, Lupin was so frozen and wide-eyed that Sirius was concerned for a second that he had hit him with a petrifying curse as well, but, when he held out his hand to help him up, Remus took it. </p>
<p>"Are you alright?" Sirius asked him.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm fine. Thank you." Remus replied quietly, ready to collect his things and find an empty compartment.</p>
<p>However, as he turned to find his bag, he found Sirius helping him collect it. Sirius grinned and handed Remus his suitcase and then did something else that Remus had not been expecting. He asked him to join him.</p>
<p>"Do you want to sit in this compartment with me?" He offered.</p>
<p>Remus looked at Sirius, surprised, but he nodded and hesitantly followed Sirius in. He took a seat on a bench opposite of Sirius and carefully accepted his bag back.</p>
<p>Sirius noticed how uncomfortable that this guy seemed, and then he noticed that he didn't know this guy's name.</p>
<p>"So, um, what's your name?" He asked. </p>
<p>Remus looked up at the boy, Sirius, in front of him. He found himself having even more difficulty speaking than usual as he stared into his piercing grey eyes. "Remus." He finally forced out. "Remus Lupin." He added.</p>
<p>Sirius nodded, "I'm Sirius. Sirius Black." He replied, offering his hand out for a shake. As much as he disliked his parents, their manners had rubbed off on him a little.</p>
<p>Remus carefully took Sirius' hand and shook it. He had a firm grip, Sirius. Remus took note of that. His father had taught him many things about what different types of handshakes meant and, just by his handshake, Sirius was making a good impression on Remus. Of course, having saved him from those third years had helped too. Suddenly Remus didn't feel so hopeless when it came to the prospect of making friends.</p>
<p>Sirius was just getting Remus to start opening up a bit, talking about things he liked and how excited he was about going to Hogwarts, when two boys burst into their compartment. One of these two boys quickly turned around and locked the compartment door and then pulled the curtains down, hiding them from anyone in the hallway. This boy then turned around and noticed Sirius and Remus, turned to the other boy, and then burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Peter, you said this compartment was empty!" He complained while laughing.</p>
<p>"Well, I thought that it was!" Assumably Peter protested, "Or maybe it was the compartment across from this one..." He mused.</p>
<p>"Well, it obviously wasn't this one." The first boy told him.</p>
<p>"Sorry, James." Assumably Peter apologized.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Peter." Assumably James replied, "This'll be fine."</p>
<p>Then the two froze as shouting was heard from somewhere in the hall. Assumably James needlessly shushed everybody in the compartment and pressed his ear to the door. Sirius and Remus shot each other questioning looks, but remained silent, curious to see how this would work out.</p>
<p>The four boys sat quietly until Assumably James relaxed and turned to Assumably Peter and said "Whew, that was a close one."</p>
<p>He then turned to Sirius and Remus and said "Hello, sorry about that. Long story, quite unimportant. I'm James Potter and this is Peter Pettigrew." He gestured to Peter.</p>
<p>Sirius smiled, "I'm Sirius Black, and this is Remus Lupin." He introduced. </p>
<p>James smiled back and plopped down next to Sirius. "Do you mind if we share this compartment with you?"</p>
<p>"Not at all." Sirius replied, although he felt like James would have stayed either way.</p>
<p>Peter sat down next to Remus and carefully shoved his bag under his seat. Within a few minutes the four boys were talking and joking as if they'd known each other for ages. In fact, they got so caught up in their conversation, that they barely noticed when they finally arrived at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Flash forward a couple of weeks and all four boys had been sorted into Gryffindor, much to their delight and, even more fortunately, they also shared a dorm room. They had quickly become so close that they were nearly inseparable.</p>
<p>James and Sirius seemed to be the most alike one another. They were both quite smart but rarely applied themselves and had a knack for troublemaking. Unfortunately for Remus and Peter, tagging along with them pinned their troublemaker reputation onto them as well. Peter was a fairly quiet and clumsy boy who was accustomed to following the flow. He greatly admired the other three. Remus was contemplative and quiet most of the time, but when he spoke he never wasted a word and his insults could be scathing. He was extremely intelligent, so intelligent that he often ended up writing papers for James and Sirius, but with them around him, he didn't have to worry about bullied, so he was happy to help his friends. All together the four boys caused trouble and were quite brilliant while they did it.</p>
<p>The four boys also found themselves instantly disliking a certain Slytherin by the name of Severus Snape. And, although Severus was indeed a quite unpleasant person, it was questionable if he really deserves the level of torture that the four put him through. However as they were well liked no one questioned them.</p>
<p>No one except Lily Evans.</p>
<p>Lily Evans was a first year Gryffindor who was so smart that she made everybody question why she wasn't in Ravenclaw. She also followed the rules and although she could be mean at times she was very compassionate and fiercely protective of her friends. And Severus Snape was her friend. Therefore, she strongly disliked the four boys. Mostly James, whom she correctly pegged as the ring leader of the pranking of Snape.</p>
<p>This was unfortunate for James as he had a crush on Lily Evans the second she sassed him for setting off some dungbombs in History of Magic, which, to be fair, was a terribly boring class. Even Remus had to agree, and he was usually very enthusiastic about his classes, but Professor Binns was just dreadfully dull.</p>
<p>And they kept planning their genius pranks together under Remus' disapproving supervision, except for those times when Remus was gone.</p>
<p>"Has Remus really got to go to another funeral?" James questioned because, although Remus did not in any way approve of their pranks, he did have some great ideas that he gave them just to help them get away with the pranks.</p>
<p>"I thought his mum was sick" Peter said in confusion.</p>
<p>"Maybe his mum is sick and he's at a funeral?" Sirius suggested.</p>
<p>"Yeah, that makes sense." James agreed and they got back to planning their next prank.</p>
<p>What they didn't know, and wouldn't figure out for another year, was that Remus Lupin had a secret that he was decisively keeping from even his closest friends.</p>
<p>He was a werewolf.</p>
<p>Remus Lupin had been bit by a werewolf when he was quite young and had been infected ever since. As it had been several years, he was used to making up excuses for why he would have to disappear for a day or two. He was quite good at it. He was not quite as good, however, at hiding the after affects of his transformations. He was saved from that by the fact that his friends tended to be preoccupied with school work and pranking and the fact that they all enjoyed Quidditch, so it wasn't uncommon for them to look a bit worse for wear. </p>
<p>Remus was very careful around the others, making sure that he never changed in front of them so they couldn't see his scars and always acting more upbeat than he felt in order to hide his tiredness. He was good at hiding his secret.</p>
<p>And Sirius Black was good at hiding his secret. </p>
<p>Something that he hasn't ever wanted to tell his friends was how horrid his parents were. The Black's were a part of a very old wizard tree and terribly pompous about it. They were prejudiced against those who weren't pure bloods and traced their lineage all the way back to Salazar Slytherin himself. All members of the glorious house of Black were Slytherins. Except Sirius.</p>
<p>This of course meant that Sirius was immediately disowned as soon as his parents found out that he had been sorted into Gryffindor. He had received a rather strongly worded letter the next day detailing how he had disgraced the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black. Obviously, he was not looking forward to going back home. </p>
<p>See, even before Sirius had been Sorted as a Gryffindor, his parents never favored him. And they had no problem showing him. The Blacks were a cruel family who dealt out the cruciatus curse to Sirius almost as often as they cursed the name of all Mudbloods. Which was a lot</p>
<p>But that was also a secret that wouldn't be found out by the others, at least not for a few years.</p>
