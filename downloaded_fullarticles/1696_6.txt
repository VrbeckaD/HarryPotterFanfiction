    <p>Harry P.O.V<br/>"Come Draco, come!," Belletrix urged Malfoy over. "Take a good look at him. Is it really Potter?" She said once he reached us. I can see the panic in his eyes. He took one look at me and turned to her.<br/>"It's not him."<br/>"Are you sure? Take ano-"<br/>"I don't mean to be disrespectful Aunt Bella but don't you think I would know if my enemy was in front of me? I would turn him over to Our Lord without hesitation," he stated. "If I may leave for a second?"<br/>"Of course," Malfoy left "Now le-" she saw the sword. "Were did you get that?" She demanded.<br/>"Found it with them. Guess it's ours now," he smirked. She attacked him and told the rest of his group to leave. They ran in fear<br/>"You! Mudblood," She pointed at Hermione. "Were did you get this?" She yelled.<br/>"I don't know," Hermione whispered.<br/>"You don't know huh? Well I think you do. Wormtail! Take these two to the celler. I think we need to have a talk. Girl to girl," Malfoy and his mother chose to walk in at that moment. I turned to look at Ron in panick. He was looking at Hermione with worry.<br/>"It's ok," I told him, "Hermione is strong. She'll be okay." Ron nodded and Wormtail took us away.</p><p>Draco P.O.V.<br/>"Of course," Aunt Bella said. I walked out and immediately went to mother's room. She sat there waiting.<br/>"Is it him?" She asked hopefully. I nodded and she sighed in relief.<br/>"Pipy, Lucy, Pyla," I called three house-elves appeared. "Can you please pack as many of my Mothers cloths and mine. Also pack all my potions stuff. And all the belongings of the people in the celler Send them to this place," I handed them a piece of paper.<br/>"Yes Master Draco," They all responded and left.<br/>"Is 2,000 gallons enough Mother?"<br/>"It's more than enough dragon," She stood up and pulled me into a hug. "You're so brave. They will be so proud of you," she promised. She stepped back and we walked back to the ballroom.</p>
