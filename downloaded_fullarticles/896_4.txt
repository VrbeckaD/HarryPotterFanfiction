    <p>There were many things Harry hadn’t expected of the life he now had. The first one being past 17 years old. At some point he had hoped to become an Auror, now he was a teacher. He had never thought much of romantic love because, honestly, who had the time? Nevertheless, he had managed to get married almost two years before. Also, there had been countless times when he couldn't wait to be of age and able to not do anything the muggle way ever again. Now he baked with his hands.</p><p><br/>
Molly had offered to teach him one of those early mornings a little after the Battle, back when he still had trouble sleeping for long and without holding his wand. They had started with something simple —cookies— and it wasn’t long before Harry was trying recipes of his own. Being able to experiment and fail without risking his life held his attention long enough for him to feel at peace.<br/>
Measure, mix, chill, scoop, warm and repeat.</p><p>It was easy, it was tranquil, it kept him focused, it was great.</p><p>He made batch after batch: plain, with chocolate chips, with jam, with peanut butter. Molly was ecstatic at his talent and interest since none of her other kids cared much for the kitchen, but it wasn't long until she taught him how to magic the calories away. Otherwise, there were only so many cookies that one could eat without feeling guilty.</p><p><br/>
When he finally felt he could whip up a batch with his eyes closed, Hermione gave him a new challenge without meaning to. She had hummed appreciatively after taking a bite of his new pumpkin chocolate chip cookies while she read a book on the history of the witches-muggles relationship and wondered out loud if magic could affect flavour or if having a nack for something could be a type of magic on its own. Only one way to find out, Harry thought.</p><p><br/>
The next day he started trying the muggle way and found it cleared his mind the way he had always longed for. It was challenging enough to keep everything else at bay. Little by little he started trying new things, first with magic, then the muggle way until he was able to use magic only when he was in a hurry.</p><p><br/>
Once they were back in school and back to being fed by the school-elves, he was convinced he could taste the magic in the food. He tried to take his mind off of it, telling himself he was imagining things until Ron sighed one morning.</p><p>"It's just not the same, is it?", he said taking a bite of his piece of toast. "I swear it has a bit too much of something, I don't know what. I miss your bread, mate."</p><p><br/>
So he had started baking again. It was easy enough to go down to the kitchens, and he had so much free time thanks to the dreams that tended to cut his nights short and the lack of an extra-curricular mission to work on. It got better eventually, but he really appreciated having had something to keep him busy back then.</p><p> </p><p>Years later, he still had the habit of getting up early on his off-days to bake a small loaf of bread for breakfast. His day felt infinitely better when he could have a fresh slice with jam. And this way he was able to spend some time with Hedwig, who couldn't fly for long nowadays but still kept to her schedule and tried to beg for some bread crumbs even though she knew she didn't like them. That was one of the few things that had met younger Harry's expectations. It was a good one.</p><p><br/>
While his bread baked, he liked to make himself a cuppa and do a quick cleaning of the kitchen. It hadn't taken them long to decide the dark decor of Grimmauld Place had to go if they were going to make it their home. Draco had a better relationship with Kreacher, so he was mostly in charge of that front. The kitchen ended up being an almost-white silver with green countertops and dark green accents since it was where Harry spent most of his time at home. The living room, where Draco preferred to work, on the other hand, was warmer, with red tones all around. Harry enjoyed looking around the kitchen once it was back to spotless, he never got tired of the space they had created together.</p><p><br/>
The warm smell that reached him from the oven took him out of his reverie to tell him it was almost time. He took a sip of his tea before swishing his wand to open the door. It hadn’t taken much to decide taking out the trays without magic was not worth it. This way meant fewer burns and he had enough marks on his skin to last him a lifetime or two. His eleven-year-old self would probably be disappointed knowing his two most used spells were so common, though —even if they were non-verbal.</p><p><br/>
He had just placed the loaf on the table to cool off when a white howler came floating his way like a cat looking for attention without wanting to seem needy and stayed in front of him, waiting as he took another sip of his tea. For a long time, he had wondered if it wasn’t easier to send him a Patronus, but they lacked the drama and tradition, he supposed. He was very thankful that this kind would wait until the recipient was ready and not be a ticking bomb. Harry loved making them wait, they tended to do a tiny kind of affronted dance that always made him smile. By the time he decided to open them, they were normally harrumphing. He liked poking them then so they knew he was ready to listen. He started prepping a tray with the cooling bread, butter, jam, honey, fruit and another cup of tea while it spoke, the haughtiness of its voice making his smile grow.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/>
<em>“To whom it may concern because, rest assured, that person is not me”, it started that day. He snorted. “I find myself APPALED at the carelessness with which I have been abandoned to the harshness of the elements this morning. This, of course, would not present a problem had it not been previously agreed that a civil greeting would happen first thing. Manners, where have they gone? It is on these grounds that I demand a prompt meeting in no longer than ten minutes. Expect a second missive in the event of tardiness... </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em><u>Don’t</u> even think about it, Potter!”</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p dir="ltr" align="left"><br/>
Once it was done, the letter proceeded to float to the bin before breaking itself offendedly into tiny neat pieces over it. So proper.</p><p><br/>
It was always so tempting to make him send a red howler, but it took too long to get him in a good mood afterward. So, Harry poured himself a second cuppa, levitated the tray, and went back to their room. After all, he had to make amends for being so rude.</p><p><br/>
No, he definitely hadn’t imagined his life this way, nor being so happy with it.</p><p> </p>
