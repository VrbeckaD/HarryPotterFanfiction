    <p>Everyone who knows Hermione Granger knew that it was a rare moment when she willingly flew anywhere. Flying is unfortunately her biggest failing. Yet only one person knows that under the right circumstances she will fly without fear.</p>
<p>Since she was 15 years old Hermione had an odd fascination with Sirius Black’s motor bike. Her first attempt at flying when she was 11 failed, brooms never did work well for her. She supposed that since a person’s magic is tied to their emotions then it was perfectly natural that fear would disrupt the magic of a broom. However, flying on Sirius’ motorbike had never bothered her. Perhaps that was because it was Sirius himself that introduced her to the experience. Oh, that was certainly one experience she would never forget.</p>
<p>The summer before 5th year Hermione came to Grimmauld Place early. Every one knew Hermione was a stickler for details and being late was something she would never tolerate. One night, long before Ron or Harry would come to Grimmauld Place, Sirius was bored, plain and simple. Since he was unable to venture out in the daylight, conceivably it would be slightly safer and less conspicuous to take a short jaunt at night. He kept his bike parked in the back, up next to the house so that it would be concealed as well by the fidelius charm. No one had to know that he was going out; in fact, it would be better if no one knew he was going out. He figured that Hermione was stuffed away in the library, Remus he was out on a scouting mission for the order, and the Weasley’s would not arrive for a few more days.</p>
<p>Hermione was tired of reading, it seemed that research, reading, and preparing is all she had been doing for weeks. A break was definitely in order, the night was clear and the fresh air would do her good after being cooped up all day. Hermione went out and climbed into the low branches of the apple tree. The moon was only a quarter full so there was very little light, yet there was just enough for her to see around her but also too little for anyone else to see her either. No matter really, she wasn’t afraid of the dark, never had been actually. A gleam of light flashing across metal caught her eyes; against the back of the house sat Sirius’ motor bike.</p>
<p>You know what they say; curiosity killed the cat; for Hermione that curiosity would be the beginning of the end.</p>
<p>She jumped down out of the tree and strode over to the bike. She had always wanted to ride, but like flying a broom, Hermione was scared. Of all the fears she could have, why did it have to be of flying? Oh, she’d never admit it to anyone, fear is a weakness and Gryffindors are nothing if not brave. She skimmed her hand across the smooth metal; the temptation to just sit astride the bike was increasing. She was certain no one would know. There were only one or two others in the house aside from her and Sirius and none of them would be up this late, let alone outside.</p>
<p>Sirius quietly walked out the backdoor; it would ruin his plans if someone saw him, let alone heard him just now. As he shut the door he noticed Hermione toss her leg over his bike, her hands caressing the smooth metal. A sly smile graced his lips as an idea struck him; he wasn’t a Marauder for nothing. Stealthy as a fox he glided up behind Hermione, who was too engrossed in her own fantasy to notice.</p>
<p>Right behind her now Sirius put his lips to her ear, “How ‘bout I take you for a spin?”</p>
<p>Hermione instantly froze, no one was supposed to see her, no one was supposed to know.</p>
<p>Sirius watched as everything played out on her face. Her thoughts ran a mile a minute trying to determine the best way out.</p>
<p>“Give it up, Hermione,” Sirius slid on behind her, his body pressed flush against hers, “I could see the desire on your face.” He rested his hands on her jean clad thighs. “One quick ride around the city and I’ll bring you back nice and safe. I’ll never tell, Marauder’s honor.” His hands were moving ever so slightly, caressing her legs, moving up to her waist. His thumbs ducked under her shirt drawing slow circles on her sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Hermione gasped, the slightest touch had aroused her. Oh the things she would do to this man were she of age. As it were she was only a few short months from being 16. The feel of his hands on her skin was amazing, the feel made her forget where they were and who they were. Coming out of her fantasy and back to reality, Hermione decided that it was now or never. She could pass up this opportunity or she could say yes and get the thrill of her life.</p>
<p>“Alright, Sirius,” Hermione placed her hands atop his and brought them to the handle bars, “Take me flying.”</p>
<p>Now, three years later she stood in the light of a half moon caressing the smooth metal of the same bike. Except this time there was no Sirius to ride behind her, no Sirius to show her the excitement of flying above the city. When Sirius was lost to the veil Hermione kept his bike, despite vigorous protest from Remus. She made a point of learning the mechanics of it and kept it in perfect working order. No one in the Order knew that on nights like this she went flying on the motorbike. No one knew that the rumble of the bike aroused her. But she knew…she knew what it felt like to have Sirius ride behind her, to feel him flush with her body and to know that that was the beginning of the end for Hermione Granger. On that night three years ago, she gained the most exhilarating experience of her life, but she also lost her heart to a Marauder.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&amp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&amp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Sirius slid along the floor on his left side, wand still gripped in his hand ready to battle the first foe he came across, he’d not be caught unaware again. Noticing it was eerily silent around him Sirius cautiously sat up, slowly getting to his feet, he glanced around the room; there was no one present, surely if the battle still raged Harry and the others would be nearby, they wouldn’t have forgotten him. Warily, he ventured along the corridor to his right, careful not to make a sound; Bella was sneaky but Lucius was worse, running into either of them again and he’d be done for, for sure. The corridor was clear, the crystal spheres holding the prophesies were undisturbed; surely he wasn’t in the same place he’d been moments before fighting death eaters. Something was seriously wrong and he needed to find out what.</p>
<p>Sirius raised his wand and swished it just above his head, nothing happened, he tried again, this time focusing more clearly on Grimmauld Place. A quick swish and swivel and he still remained standing in the corridor. Since when did the ministry have anti-apparation wards on getting out? Of course you couldn’t apparate in, but it was still possible to apparate out from certain locations. Fine, he’d try another way, the atrium wasn’t far he would simply floo home.</p>
<p>Moving more quickly now and with purpose in his every step Sirius no longer feared running into stray Death Eaters. If he hadn’t found any by now, the probability that he would any farther into the Ministry was slim to none. That still didn’t explain where everyone had gone and why he was left in the Ministry. The order knew he had a price on his head; they still hadn’t caught back up with Wormtail and forced him to face the Wizengamet. For that alone the order kept an eye on his every move; they couldn’t have him accidentally spilling his guts to the Ministry about the order. That Umbridge bitch would have a field day with what he knew, and it wouldn’t be good for anyone that knew him. No, that wasn’t going to happen; he’d get to the atrium and get the hell out.</p>
<p>Coming to the end of the corridor, Sirius silently crept along the wall; watchful of his surroundings he made note there was no one in site. Seriously, this was just plain weird. There was always someone in the ministry. Surely there would be people around with a battle just having taken place; Aurors would be out, taking statements and writing up reports. Taking one last look around, Sirius conceded that there was indeed no one around the Atrium or wandering around the corridors; it was now or never. Sirius made his way to the closest fireplace grabbed a handful of floo powder and quickly but clearly shouted Grimmauld Place.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&amp;&amp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Silently Hermione landed the motor bike in the backyard of Grimmauld Place; her short trip around town had been uneventful, as per usual, and she felt remarkably light and carefree. Hermione pulled the small blue tarp over the bike to protect it from the weather, as she was covering the back tire the memory of when she rode with Sirius popped into the forefront of her mind. Instantly tears started to pool in her eyes, the freedom she felt just moments ago were replaced with those of loss and longing. She shook her head and blinked back the tears, it would do no good to dwell on the past, it was three years ago; there is no way to change what is done, timeturners don’t go back years only hours. And even then, who’s to say that she could have changed what happened? She tucked the last of the tarp around the bike and headed for the back door.</p>
<p>Soothing tea would be good, Hermione thought; she strode through the parlor, down the hall to her left, all the while ignoring the protests of Mrs. Black’s portrait, and into the kitchen. She grabbed the kettle that was on the stove, filled it with water, and set it on the stove to boil. Glancing through the cabinet to see which tea she felt like having she heard the fireplace in the kitchen roar to life. Probably just a random Order member, they tended to pop in unannounced; Hermione had just laid her hands on the cinnamon tea bags when the alarms in the house roared to life. Instantly Hermione dropped the tea bag to the floor, pulled her wand from her wrist holster, and whirled around to face the intruder.</p>
<p>The wards on the property would only admit current order members and authorized guests (mainly potential new members); anyone not authorized by the wards would set off an alarm.</p>
<p>Hermione watched the movements of the intruder, she could tell by the outward appearance she was dealing with someone male. His body was lithe, he moved with ease and grace, as though he’d been falling through floos all his life; his hair was a deep charcoal black that fell in waves around his face, he was of average build, not stocky nor very scraggily, but seeming just perfect. Without taking her eyes off of him, she watched through her peripheral vision that Remus now stood in the doorway, his wand aimed at the intruder as well.</p>
<p>The intruder kept his back to them as he brushed off his robes.</p>
<p>“Would someone please cut the alarm? Damn!” The intruder casually pivoted on the balls of his feet to face both Remus and Hermione.</p>
<p>Immediately shock washed over Hermione, it was not possible, it simply could not be. “NO. Absolutely not! You are dead, I know you are dead; I went to your damn funeral.” Hermione moved into a fighter’s stance, her wand trained on the chest of the intruder. “Since I know you aren’t Sirius Black you might as well drop the glamour and tell me who the fuck you really are.” Hermione was furious, if someone thought they could come into Order head quarters and try and impersonate a dead man they were sadly mistaken. She’d watched him fall through the veil, been there to comfort Harry as they buried and empty casket, no, this was not Sirius Black of that she was quite certain.</p>
<p>Remus was gob smacked, could it really be? Was it possible? Surely, he would have turned up sooner than three years if he was alive.</p>
<p>“Damn it, woman, kill the alarm!”</p>
<p>“I will not until you tell me who the fuck you are, and what you’re doing here.”</p>
