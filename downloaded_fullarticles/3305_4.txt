    <p>
  <span>Sirius remembered how James declared that he wanted to be a paladin tank when they first started playing, when they were just kids, thirteen or fourteen. Something about being the fancy hero of the group, leading them to their holy victory.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus was bullied into becoming their healer. Peter picked a mage, a damage dealer class, because he had read that it was an easy class. Sirius himself chose a rogue, another damage dealer class, because it sounded cool and so him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Their first foray to leveling the characters to the maximum level had been a joy, an exercise in noobness. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius had enjoyed trolling the others on afk pauses, by sneaking behind mobs and stabbing them and vanishing to the safety of the shadows, to snicker when others would scream when they realized that their characters were being destroyed. His class was the ultimate troll pick, and he fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>loved </span>
  </em>
  <span>it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James enjoyed pulling stupid stunts as well, like taking pieces of his armor off in the middle of a fight, piece by piece until Remus noticed why his job as a healer was getting suspiciously harder and harder. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Peter took pride in performing well as a mage, although Sirius made sure to remind him often that that was not a thing to take pride in, not when you had only a few spells to spam and you got to be in safe ranged distance far from the enemies all the time.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus swore repeatedly how he hated his role, how it made him sweat and stress and how he hated healing James, who was all yolo about his role as a tank. Remus switched to shadow priest sometimes (a damage dealing specialization that priests could also perform), but it made their dungeon queues longer. They always ended up bribing/blackmailing/threatening him back to grudgingly healing their sorry asses.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They had been new to the game, and they had been bad, but none of that had mattered when they were bickering and shit talking and figuring their way through the game together.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was so odd to remember those times, only a few years later, Sirius thought, as he stood behind the group, the adrenaline starting to pump in his veins, the relentless disco album hyping him up for the dungeon.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>In hindsight, he could only scoff at how he had thought something like damage dealing could hold his attention for long. It was a boring role, all about perfecting your spell/ability rotation, with no variance between plays, with no true challenges.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Pads, you ready?” asked Remus, his voice coming smooth and warm through Sirius’s headsets. Remus’s ridiculous character, a big cow-man, a warrior Tauren named ‘MooMoony’, stood next to the gate, ready to soon open the entrance and start the timer.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Always,” Sirius answered. “Ready to get spanked?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus snorted. “As long as you’re there to heal the bruises.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Let’s cut the flirting and do this shit,” said James, making Peter snicker. “I picked up a new helmet with the PVP points, and it has some sick stats. I’m ready to fucking blow the damage meters. I’m going to fucking melt these mobs, so be ready to set a fast pace, Moons. Or I’m gonna run ahead of you and pick more mobs.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who's flirting now, trying to make Worms swoon with your antics,” grunted Sirius.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus chuckled, a warm trickle of sound that made Sirius’s neck shiver. “Prongs, don’t get too excite. This Mythic+ is hard shit, and we gotta concentrate. Did you check the strategy video links I posted on Discord yesterday?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah, of course. Hit the baddies, run, beat the timer, profit.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus groaned.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James laughed. “Don’t sweat it, Moons. I did check the main points.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are we gonna do this or not?” asked Sirius. “My buff potions and flasks are gonna run out, and they are fucking pricey shit.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Pads, you lazy fucker, you didn’t even pay for that shit yourself-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus interrupted him, “He is right. I’m starting it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Let’s do this shit.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius could hear the excited smile in his voice.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>3…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>2…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>1…</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And they rushed through the opening gate.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was dancing.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius didn’t think, didn’t have time to think when they were playing on this level, with their gear dozens of levels below of what it should be for running through this high level dungeon comfortably. His play was pure skill and intuition at this point, after long, long time of perfecting it. He was in a state of flow, and he felt </span>
  <em>
    <span>alive.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was balancing his spell cooldowns, his mana. It was playing with fire, keeping everyone alive. It was about staying aware of where everyone in the group was standing, what they were doing. It was being on the constant lookout for the misstep in their choreography.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>If someone made a mistake, it was down to Sirius to react to it and find a good fix in a split of a second. He had a plan for each encounter, but he had to stay focused, had to be ready to change that plan and improvise, had to be ready to think on his feet and come up with creative solutions.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus had hated it, the stressful unpredictability of it. And for a long time Sirius had scoffed at it, assuming that it must be the most boring stuff ever.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Now he couldn’t imagine doing anything else. Healing came to him like second nature.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Most of all, it was a dance with Remus. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Yes, they were all a part of a delicate group choreography, but when it came down to it, it was a duet between him and Remus. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The damage dealers were in a competition against each others, finding their motivation from outdoing each other’s damage, fighting against each others to come out of a dungeon as the top dog.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus and Sirius were outsiders to that competition; they were in their own world. They were performers, they were partners; both of them handling their own responsibilities and counting on the other.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>On the surface, Remus was leading, setting the pace; in reality, Sirius knew and trusted him to set the pace according to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sirius</span>
  </em>
  <span> and Sirius’s capabilities, according to Remus’s fine tuned intuition on how far he could push Sirius’s healing output.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Just like Sirius kept his eye on Remus all through the dance, listening to his pulse, watching out for him, knowing when to step in with big saves or when to concentrate on others and let Remus handle himself; just like that, he knew that Remus was keeping an eye on him, always aware on where Sirius was and how he was doing and ready to slow down.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was intimate. It was a silent bond forged through hundreds of hours of playing together, of learning each other’s ways.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fuck,” said Peter, a second after Sirius had spotted an upcoming disaster.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A group of mobs that was not supposed to be triggered into the fight was charging towards them, just because Peter had taken a few steps into the wrong direction.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They were already in the middle of hard battle. Everyone was in half health; there were severe “damage over time curses” on everyone, relentlessly cutting at their health bars each second that Sirius had to keep fighting against; there were random spikes of damages and stunning spells that he had to react fast to heal; there were sorcerer enemies in fight that they had to keep interrupting from blowing up them all.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius topped off his own health; he threw a refreshed shield on Remus; he swapped his own full health bar with James’s that was at ten percent; and then Sirius promptly died to the mass of the beasts.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Knowing to expect it, Sirius instantly accepted Remus’s battle resurrection (a spell that could only be used once every ten minutes by the group), and he was back in fight. Peter had died as well, but compared to James and the third damage dealer, he was the one that was most sacrificable.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Half a minute later they were back on track, running forward, dozens of enemies laying dead behind them. Sirius had resurrected Peter once the fight had been over, with a regular resurrection.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you guys see that amaze damage I did there?” James yelled. “Fucking hell yess! I screenshotted it and I’m gonna post it on guild forums! Evans </span>
  <em>
    <span>has</span>
  </em>
  <span> to recruit me to the main raiding team when she sees that. Good job Wormy on pulling them!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fucking hell, Wormtail,” said Sirius, although his grin was wide, and he felt alive and his heart was pumping and his excitement was up the roof. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>loved</span>
  </em>
  <span> it when shit went wrong, and he loved it especially when they managed to salvage the situation anyway. “Don’t do that shit again, we nearly died. And now we’re out of battle rezzes.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You saved it well, though!” said Peter.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“He did,” Remus said, and fuck, Sirius was a goner for his praise, delivered in that smooth, warm approval. “Let’s focus, guys. We have two minutes left, if we want to beat the timer and get the best loots.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They didn’t do it before the timer had ticked down, not this time, because of the mishap with the mobs. They did finish though, and got good loot, even though it was not the top tier they had aimed for.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Good play, still,” said Remus.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re gonna do it next week,” said James cheerfully. “Now, excuse me, I’m gonna log off and go brag about my </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking amaze</span>
  </em>
  <span> damage.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius groaned, though he was fighting off a fond smile. “You fucking damage dealers. It’s all numbers to you, isn’t it.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Says an elf in a dress,” said James.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t have time to transmogrify it to something else!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Or maybe you just like wearing pretty dresses, hmm?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Why are you so focused on my dress, Potter? Worried that you won’t see me in it again?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Right!” Remus said, clearly holding a laugh back. “I’m logging off too, I still need to finish the homework for tomorrow.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You finished it last week, you derp,” said Sirius.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I noticed that I have to edit some bits in it before returning. Good game, guys.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius rolled his eyes, and logged off the game himself too and disconnected from the Discord.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He didn’t have any homework to pointlessly work into perfection, but he did need to go have a good wank.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Healing came like a second nature to him, but also, it left him feeling horny as hell.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
