    <p>“Hermione, this is the one- this is perfect for you.”  Ginny held up an elegant dress before Hermione, looking in the mirror with her at it.  “You need to try this on.”  The dress was lovely- a sage green halter neck that would show off her tan and her curves- no one would be able to tear their eyes away from her.  Well…hopefully one person for certain.</p>
<p>“I like it,” said Hermione.  “I just don’t think this is wise.  Maybe I shouldn’t go.”  It was the fifth anniversary of the vanquishing of Lord Voldemort, and Kingsley had persuaded the Golden Trio to appear this year, much to Hermione’s reluctance.  “I hate these things- everyone staring at me all the time, blokes asking me to dance just so they can cop a feel, being dateless AGAIN.  The thought of this is already wearing me out.”</p>
<p>“Well, you don’t have to be dateless,” said Ginny.  “That’s why you’re going.  To finally tell him how you feel.”  Color flooded Hermione’s face, and she started stammering about what a terrible idea this was.  “Hermione, this has gone on long enough.  You've been in love with Fred since what- fifth year?  Isn't it time to do something about it?"</p>
<p>"He's always dating someone," said Hermione.  "Tart of the week- that's his story."</p>
<p>"Well, to be fair, it's not like you've done something about it," said Ginny.  "I asked him about it- why he's such a serial dater.  He says that he's young, and he's dating around since he can.  All these girls throw themselves at him since he's a "Weasley," and he's a successful business owner and war hero."</p>
<p>"Girls throw themselves at Harry and Ron too- but you don't see them taking up any offers," grumbled Hermione.  "And George too."</p>
<p>"Well, all three of them have someone," said Ginny.  "I'll hex any tramp that puts her hands on Harry- and I dare say Angelina would do the same with George.  Ron went through his phase for a while, but he and Susan are pretty serious now.  Fred- well, he's different.  He hasn't been the same since the war- he takes risks where he can- dating, I guess.  He would never do anything to jeopardize the business."</p>
<p>"I know all that," said Hermione.  "And I know that I'm not getting anywhere by not speaking up- I don't think he'd ever be interested in me that way.  I don't know why I just can't move on.  I've tried but..."</p>
<p>"I get it, Hermione," soothed Ginny.  "If anyone understands, it's me."  Hermione understood what Ginny was saying- Ginny had pined after Harry for years, but gave up for a while, dating others until Harry woke up to what had been in front of him the whole time.  Hermione had tried to do the same, but she wasn't as outgoing as Ginny and was much more hesitant now that the war was over.  Men wanted to date THE Hermione Granger, Golden Girl of Gryffindor...not Hermione.  So, she spent her days with her work at the Ministry, which was going nowhere, and then home to her books and her cat.  She spent her weekends helping at Fred and George's shop- helping them make stock and improve their inventions, which probably didn't help her feelings for Fred.  Maybe she should stay away from there for a while- learn to move on.</p>
<p>Both girls directed their attention to the dress Ginny was holding up, and Hermione sighed, taking it to go and try on.  It fit her very nicely and accentuated her curves and tan, just like Ginny said it would.  She walked out to show Ginny the dress.  "Perfect!  Hermione- that looks so good on you!" </p>
<p>"It's just...too much," said Hermione, pulling at the fabric.  "I can't pull this off."</p>
<p>"Yes, you can," said Ginny.  "You've been hiding under frumpy mum dresses for years now- you need to show yourself off.  You look hot!"  Hermione studied herself in the mirror again.  Ginny was right- the dress was very becoming on her- maybe she was right about finally saying something to Fred after all this time too.  The worst he could say was no, right? It was time she finally found out whether or not she stood a chance. </p>
<p>She took a deep breath.  "All right, Ginny.  I'll try it your way."</p>
<p>…......</p>
<p>"No date tonight?"  Fred looked away from the mirror where he had been adjusting his tie to see George walking into the room.  "That's a first for the great Fred Weasley."</p>
<p>"Well, I ended things with Emily last weekend," said Fred.  "And I've been at work since- haven't had time to scare up a new date."</p>
<p>"So, what was wrong with this one?" Asked George as he adjusted his cuffs.  "Too bossy? Too skinny?  Uneven eyebrows?"</p>
<p>"Too clingy," said Fred.  "Started talking about kids and marriage after two weeks.  Besides, I'll figure there'll be plenty of birds at this party for me to choose from.  Why limit my chances?"</p>
<p>"Whatever floats your boat, bro," said George.  "Lucky for you, Mum is happy that Bill, Ginny, Percy and I are all married- so she's content to wait for you for a while.  She's getting itchy to plan another wedding though- and there aren't many more children to choose from."</p>
<p>Fred groaned.  "She'll have to keep waiting.  I'm nowhere near ready to settle down."  He knew his mum would cut him some slack- he had been in St. Mungo's for months after the war-so she was still just grateful he was alive.  So was he.  If Hermione hadn't saved him when that wall collapsed, it would have been over.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should take Hermione," said George.  "She doesn't have a date either."</p>
<p>"Again?" Scoffed Fred.  "Does she ever have a date?"  He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Well, she's had a few I guess," said George.  "It's hard when you're famous.  She didn't ask for it."  George had just come from Molly's before arriving at the flat he used to share with Fred, and he had done his duty and asked Fred to escort Hermione to the event- even though he knew it wouldn't do much good.  Molly would be disappointed- she had come to love Hermione like her own and wanted her to be happy.</p>
<p>"She's fine," said Fred.  "She's never said anything when she helps out at the shop.  She's too busy lecturing me about proper ingredient storage."</p>
<p>"Well, if she can't find anything, how is she supposed to make anything?" Asked George.  "She does have a point you know."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know," conceded Fred.  "I suppose I could make more of an effort.  I'll clean everything up this week." Hermione had been good enough to help them out- they would never have perfected their line of joke brooms without her help. </p>
<p>"Mum says be nice to her tonight yeah?  Her werewolf legislation was passed over again yesterday," said George.  "She's been working overtime for months on it- she's pretty down."  Fred frowned.  He was always nice to her- why the reminder?  "I'll see you over there- just wanted to pass on the message from Mum.  Have to go tell Angelina how pretty she is."  George winked and apparated from the room.  Fred looked in the mirror again- he looked pretty good.  He hoped there would be someone at the party that would notice.</p>
