          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Are you that desperate for money, Potter?” a voice drawled from behind Harry. “You’re combing the streets for loose change?”<br/>
<br/>
Harry sighed, turning around. “Hello to you too, Malfoy.”<br/>
<br/>
Draco looked at the coin in Harry’s hand and frowned. “What kind of galleon is that?”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s a penny. That’s why I was picking it up. You know, find a penny, pick it up, all day long you’ll have good luck?”<br/>
<br/>
“What is a penny?”<br/>
<br/>
“A Muggle coin. You really don’t know anything about Muggles, do you?”<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t.” Draco hesitated then said,“Maybe you could teach me.”</p></div>
