    <p>Begin Transmission</p><p>Lacy here kids with the prologue for Heidi Lily Potter: Book Four. Sweet! Let's recap as normal, shall we?</p><p>Heidi Lily Potter is Harry Potter's younger sister by a year. As easily guessed by that one sentence, her life is anything but easy. She and her brother are being raised and cared for by Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks Lupin. Harry's first year we watched as Heidi dealt with her brother going through his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p>Heidi's year was by no means a cake walk since she was living at the school along with their guardians as Sirius was one of the teachers. And it seemed every time Heidi helped her brother do something that was against the rules, she got in trouble.</p><p>Book two was Heidi's first year. We watched her get sorted into Ravenclaw, Sirius's reaction was humorous, we also saw Lockhart be, well, Lockhart. Sirius was right, the wall paper would have done better. We saw her deal with the school being attacked by an unseen force and her brother being blamed. Yeah, that worked her temper.</p><p>Last year we saw more problems for the kids. Pettigrew and Bellatrix had broken out of Azkaban and were after the kids, dementors, which had a great negative effect on the Potter kids, were stationed around the school and Sirius was in full freak out, over protective mode. The only upside to their year was Remus being their Defense teacher.</p><p>This year, well we've got the Quidditch World Cup, the Triwizard Tournament, Mad-Eye Moody as a Defense teacher, dragons, the Black Lake and a maze beyond any nightmare you can imagine. As for personal stuff, Harry gets his first girlfriend while Heidi gives Seamus the answer he's been waiting for all summer and while Harry has nightmares about Voldemort, Heidi is still fighting off her own nightmares about her torture at the hands of Bellatrix from the year before.</p><p>There is no such thing as an easy year in the lives of Harry and Heidi Potter. So sit back, hit the next button and hold on to your wands.</p><p>-LacytheRomanWerewolf-</p><p>End Transmission</p>
