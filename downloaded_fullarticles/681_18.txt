    <p>- Tell me exactly what happened.</p><p align="left">- Why should I? What's in it for me?</p><p align="left">- I just want to help you. I want to understand what you just went through. I may be able to do something about it.</p><p align="left">- I don't think so. Let me go, please.</p><p align="left">- Very well, then. But know that I will be here in case you change your mind. I believe you know the exit.</p><p align="left">- You bet I do.</p><p align="left"> </p>
<hr/><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Two hours later, Harry realized there was no other choice for him. No way out. He had to go back and tell everything, otherwise he would never be able to sleep with a clean conscience again. Hardly anybody else would understand his predicament, and he wasn't in the mood to try to figure out who would. Not even his closest friends could help him now, as they were out of reach at the moment. He was alone, he would stay alone for who knows how much longer, and his burden was just too heavy to bear completely by himself. "If only there was" - he thought - "a magic word to make it all disappear."</p><p align="left">But he felt he was not ready - not yet. He stared at a mirror for forty minutes straight and the words would simply not come out of his mouth. He tried to sleep, but closing his eyes only made he see that image again, that dreadful image, in all of its gut-wrenching details. His mind could not think of anything else; he wasn't able to remember any other moment of his entire life, nor could he come up with a different topic to fill his thoughts while staring at an unfamiliar ceiling. He looked at a wall clock near by; it was 3:59 pm. "There's no way I'm looking at that thing again for the next hour," was the only thought that crossed his minds while his eyes slowly moved back to the ceiling. Fortunetaly, he didn't had to look at anything anymore, as his exhausted body gave up on the tension and fell asleep on a deep and dreamless slumber for the next eighteen hours.</p><p align="left"> </p>
<hr/><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">- So, you're back.</p><p align="left">- Of course, you knew I would.</p><p align="left">- Please, sit down. Do you want to start right away?</p><p align="left">- I don't... I don't think so.</p><p align="left">- Of course. We'll start when you're ready.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Harry sat on a comfortable chair close to the chimney. He picked up a cup of tea and started to drink. He soon realized it was his favorite kind of tea - very sweet, extremely hot and filled with ice blocks. The first sip is hot, the second is cold, then the opposing temperatures collide inside his mouth like a war raging on, all the while the sugar makes it all taste like candy. That flavour was all he needed to finally relax and feel courage once again.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The courage he needs to tell his story. To explain what happened in that fateful night, two days ago.</p>
