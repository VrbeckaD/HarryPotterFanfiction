    <p>Hermione turned the corner that would lead her to her favorite room at Number 12 Grimmauld Place but found her path blocked by a large, black, bear-like dog. Hermione paused.  Padfoot had rarely paid any attention to her (much to her dismay, as she’d harbored a fairly sizable crush for his human form for a few months). Why was he preventing her from walking into the library? A sudden realization overtook Hermione: Harry and Ginny must be having a moment in there, the gods know it has happened in every other room of the house.</p>
<p>Hermione sighed exasperatedly but couldn’t find it in herself to actually be annoyed with them. Following the fall of Voldemort, it was only natural that they wanted to spend as much time together as possible. </p>
<p>Somehow or another, a whole pack of them had ended back up under the same roof again, Harry and Ginny, Remus and Tonks, Hermione, and of course, Sirius, but this was his house after all. Hermione supposed she was really the odd one out, after trying and failing to reverse the memory charms on her parents, she just couldn’t find it in herself to return to her childhood home. When he heard that she was out of a place to stay, Sirius had insisted that she take up residency at Grimmauld, at least for the holidays, before going back to complete her N.E.W.T.s and to help Minerva at Hogwarts. </p>
<p>Minerva had eagerly asked Hermione if she’d be willing to take the younger levels of Transfiguration for a year until she was able to find a new professor. Hermione had consequently locked herself away in the library in order to study for her N.E.W.T.s which she would be taking in October, and also to work on lesson plans with the help of Minerva’s old ones.</p>
<p>It was odd. She couldn’t see or hear Harry and Ginny. She inched closer and Padfoot bowed and poised on his hind legs as if threatening to pounce on her. She giggled and took a step backward, but in her momentary closeness to the door, she didn’t get any indication that Harry and Ginny, or anyone for that matter, was actually in the library. She looked him in the eye and he started wagging his tail.</p>
<p>“Sirius, is there anyone in there?” she asked. The dog shook his head. “Are you hiding something in there?” Another no from Padfoot. “Did you bury a bone in there?” This time she spoke teasingly and Sirius crouched as if to pounce again.<br/>
“Okay, Okay, what is it then?” Padfoot came up to her right hand, nuzzled it, cocked his head slightly, then walked past her briskly. She shook her head bemusedly and made to walk into the library but Padfoot let out a very loud bark and bounded in front of the door, growling. </p>
<p>At her brief look of fear, he wagged his tail, whimpered at her, and rolled onto his back. She furrowed her brow confusedly then knelt down and began to rub his belly, watching in amusement as his right hind leg began to shake uncontrollably. After a few moments, he stood up once more and licked her hand. Very gently, so as to not bite her, he grabbed her watch band between his teeth and tugged. Sirius’ animagus was very large so Hermione didn’t have to bend over at all as he led her down the hall, down the stairs, and to the back door in the kitchen. </p>
<p>“Honestly Padfoot, if you needed to go to the bathroom, you could always just transform back and walk down the hall.” Hermione laughed. This time, Sirius did lunge, knocking her back onto the bench in the kitchen. Hermione was too busy laughing to care though. He sat in her lap for a minute looking like an extremely large dog that didn’t understand that he wasn’t the size of a chihuahua, before taking hold of her watch band once more, leading her to the door, but this time turning the knob with one of his own paws. Out in the yard, he released her arm to grab a large stick and bounded back to her, dropping it at her feet.</p>
<p>“Really, Sirius?” He barked his assent and she threw the stick as far as she could, which ended up spanning the length of the yard. He ran after it, leaped into the air with far more grace than your typical Newfoundland and caught it between his teeth. Hermione laughed again and sat down on the stairs to the back door still shaking her head. Padfoot dropped the stick and trotted over to her.</p>
<p>“You know, Sirius, most dogs are smart enough to understand that in order to fetch again, they have to bring the stick back.” Hermione shot snarkily as Sirius broke into a run coming directly toward her. He did not pounce on her, however. He lay down with his head and front paws on her lap and haunches on the stair next to her, and transformed back into a man, squishing her into the side of the railing in the process. She giggled at his ridiculousness once more as he righted himself from being sprawled out all over the step.</p>
<p>“It’s about time you get out of that library for a bit and have yourself a smile,” said Sirius jovially. “There’s only so much to review, you know.” He paused for a moment and leaned back. as though in a reclining armchair. “How many N.E.W.T.s are you up for anyway?” he asked with interest.</p>
<p>“Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, Care of Magical Creatures, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Arithmancy, Astronomy, History of Magic, Herbology, and Ancient Runes, with specificities in Human Transfiguration, Numerology, Healing Potions and Charms, Hexes and Jinxes, Cross-Species Languages, Gaelic Runes, and Alchemy,” she recited in habitual monotone, as she seemed to be answering this question very frequently.</p>
<p>“Good grief, girl, take a breath.” He smiled, mirth dancing in his slate grey eyes. “Besides, even if you only get N.E.W.T.s in half of those things, you’d be one of the most accomplished witches of the century.” He paused for a moment and then looked to her in surprise. “Human Transfiguration? Are you an animagus?” </p>
<p>“No, I haven’t gotten around to that one yet. Someday…” she trailed off smiling.</p>
<p>“Well I would be...<em>paws</em>-itively delighted to help you reach your <em>pet</em>-ential if you ever want some help...the gods know I’m a bit desperate to be of help with anything these days.” She grinned at his joke but noticed the definite note of bitterness in his tone. “It’s high time that I leave this place. Too many bad memories.” Hermione was surprised at his sudden change in subject and tone and was unsure of how to respond. At his Accio, a pitcher of iced pumpkin juice and two silver goblets opened the door and landed softly a few stairs above them. He poured them each a drink and spoke again. “The house is technically Harry’s, I left it to him before the incident with that damned curtain, and since I’ve been back, it hasn’t reinstated even though my vault at Gringotts remains mine. I think the bloody hovel just senses that I don’t want it anymore.” Sirius laughed harshly and took a sip from his goblet.</p>
<p>“Have you started looking elsewhere?” Hermione inquired tentatively. He shot her a look but shook his head in answer.</p>
<p>“I can’t exactly traipse into an open house. People still don’t exactly trust me: you see, I think it may have something to do with the fact that my deranged face has been plastered over every square inch of spare space in the entirety of Britain for several years, but that’s just a hypothesis.” He gave a cheeky sort of smile.<br/>
“ I think I’d like Hogsmeade or another small wizarding village. I like the idea of space to run around and freedom to occasionally go for a fly on the bike without fear or getting caught by the Muggle authorities.” His mischievous twinkle returned to his eyes at this thought.</p>
<p> “I don’t want to be lonely here when everyone leaves again. Remus and Tonks are moving out in two weeks, they just told me this morning, and you’re leaving at the end of the summer. I know Harry and Ginny have no plans to vacate, but they’re much too wrapped up in one another to be providing company for a senile, decrepit, old man.”</p>
<p>“So you want to go be lonely in Hogsmeade? And honestly Sirius, you’re not even forty!” she laughed.</p>
<p>“Ah, taking the bait perfectly, my dear.” Sirius winked.<br/>
This was all very strange for Hermione. She and Sirius were never on tense terms (aside from the moments in her fifth year when she thought him reckless), but they never really gravitated towards one another. It was odd of him to seek her out. <em>I guess he really is lonely.</em> She didn’t get too long to think about it before he spoke again.</p>
<p>“Are you hungry? I could ask Kreacher to fix something if you like.” </p>
<p>They sat in each other’s company for a bit longer, eating the tea sandwiches that Kreacher brought out for them and sipping on pumpkin juice. They spoke about everything and nothing. He talked about his adolescent stupidity, his gratefulness for James Potter’s parents, animagi transformations, loneliness during wartime. She spoke of her aspirations of learning about wandmaking or going into the Unspeakables, the time she set Snape’s robes on fire, and the small annoyances of camping for months with two teenage boys.</p>
<p>“...I swear you’d think that they weren’t wizards. Every time we’d move locations, the sink would be covered in beard clippings. It was disgusting.”<br/>
Sirius chuckled and continued to question her, and they shared laughs outside on the porch for the rest of the afternoon.<br/>
Until…</p>
<p>“Shite, I forgot that it's my night to make dinner!” Sirius looked at her in alarm. “What do we have in there? Do you know?” Her eye-roll was so pronounced she was surprised it wasn’t audible.</p>
<p>“Not much unless you intend to prepare us all some gourmet cereal and peanut buttered toast.” She smiled at him. Sirius’ meals were always notoriously late at night due to the fact that he nearly always forgot about them, but he was actually a pretty decent cook. </p>
<p>“Fancy a ride on the bike?” Sirius asked. “You know, just to help a senile old man get his groceries?”</p>
<p>Not to be baited again, she replied with, “As long as we stay on the ground. I’ve never liked flying much.”</p>
<p>“Deal! Wait, really? Those rides on Buckbeak must’ve been hell for you then. Let me go grab the keys.”</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>She noticed that he was being incredibly cautious on his motorcycle. He never accelerated very quickly, he made sure that he’d given her a helmet and fastened it properly, and he routinely checked in with her about every few miles. She’d half expected him to pop a wheelie and go racing down the streets, and once they’d reached the nearby grocer’s she told him so.</p>
<p>He smiled, “Precious cargo. And I find that a nice cruise does far more for me in the way of feeling free now after several years of running and being chased.”<br/>
After gathering everything they needed, they paid. Once outside, they shrunk their bags down to fit in their pockets and re-mounted the bike. The cruise back was just as comfortable and Sirius went meandering for a bit down side streets. It was so clear that he loved this bike. He had this air of boyish glee about him and it made him look even more handsome than he already was.</p>
<p>Upon arrival back at Grimmauld, they came to find two notes sitting on the counter.<br/>
Both Harry and Remus and their respective partners had a ministry function to attend to that night. Sirius exhaled loudly and petulantly at his lack of mouths to feed the food he’d just bought, then began to stow it all away. He smiled to himself mischievously and fixed two bowls of cereal and some peanut buttered toast. He took them up to the library to Hermione only to find her fast asleep on top of one of her books. He took the book out from under her and carefully positioned her to have her head on the armrest of the couch, put her ‘dinner’ on the coffee table in front of her and scribbled a note that he left beside it.</p>
<p>Enjoy this gourmet meal that I slaved over for hours.<br/>
