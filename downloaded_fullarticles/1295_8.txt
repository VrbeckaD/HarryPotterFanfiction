    <p align="center">1995</p><p>“Severus, are you sure about this?” Professor Minerva McGonagall questioned, her eyes folded downward with concern. The Headmaster’s office was dimly lit, only aglow with a few candles. Professor Albus Dumbledore stepped forward, extending his right hand. Professor Severus Snape did the same, interlocking hands with the headmaster.</p><p>Minerva’s wand extended, the pair twisted their hands, thus locking them in the spell.</p><p>“Will you, Severus Tobias Snape, watch over Hermione Jean Granger until the day you die?”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>A lighted cord, glowing red, wound around the two men’s arms.</p><p>“Will you obey the Marriage Law Act and enter into a legally binding relationship to shield her from a far more violent destiny?”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>Another strand wove around, a red hot wire trapping in the spell.</p><p>“And, to the best of your ability, protect her from any and all harm?”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>A third and final string curled and then lit their hands up in a bright fiery display. Severus and Albus stepped away from each other, the younger man’s head hung low.</p><p>“I know this was not how you wished your life to be, but the girl must be protected at all costs.”</p><p>“It’s what needs to be done.”</p><p>“Severus-”</p><p>“No one must know.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">1999</p><p> </p><p>Among the scattered trees stood the silhouette of a young woman, golden sunlight sparkling around her. Soon, the sun would set, and there would be nothing to separate her from the woods around her. Hermione Granger supported herself with her palm against the rough bark, her chest heaving. The breath escaping from her lips curled as it vaporized, October cold saturating the air. She regained her strength, stumbling out to the edge of the trees, her feet dragging in the sand of the beach. Plummeting to the ground, Hermione crawled towards the sea, waves lapping up onto the shore. Finally, she reached the water, and the girl collapsed.</p><p>“I said first one to the water wins! They don’t collapse!” Ginny Weasley exclaimed breathlessly, bent over with her hands on the shelves of her knees.</p><p>“I’m so out of shape it’s not even funny,” Hermione moaned as she came to her feet, her whole body nearly limp. “How do you do it? You make it look so easy.”</p><p>“I think about how badly I want that bit of cake back at the house.”</p><p>Hermione smoothed the silky chestnut hair from her face. “You mean to tell me you think of food when you’re exercising?”</p><p>Ginny shrugged her shoulders, her lips twisted into a sheepish grin. She gestured for Hermione to head back, and the girls began their trek back to the house. The Australian country held a wide array of beauty for the girls to explore: a spread of trees and forestry behind the house in which Hermione’s parents had lived. Just beyond the woods was the beach, private and secluded, in which the girls had spent several afternoons during their trip.</p><p>“How much more have we got to sort through?” Ginny asked as they entered the house, stepping into the kitchen for cold water. Hermione drank hers down, setting the glass in the sink as she wiped her mouth. Her upper lip was damp with beads of sweat, as was the rest of her.</p><p>“I think just the office and we’ll be ready for the movers tomorrow.” She responded, gathering the hair at her neck and holding it up so she could fan herself. “Before I forget, thank you for coming with me to help with the arrangements.”</p><p>“You’re more than welcome,” Ginny replied, reaching out to place a comforting hand on her friends sweaty forearm. “I’m proud of you for being able to do this. It would have taken me much longer if it were my parents.”</p><p>Hermione and Ginny dispersed, both heading to shower before meeting back together in the office to sort through the last of her parents’ things. Ginny sat on the floor, searching through the file cabinet to divide out important papers versus garbage. Hermione was positioned with her legs crossed in the desk chair, rummaging through the desk. As she finished all the other drawers, she began to reach into the top left drawer, but found it locked. Befuddled, she pulled on the wooden knob once again.</p><p>“This one’s locked.”</p><p>“It’s probably important files or something,” Ginny hummed absentmindedly, turning her attention back to the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet. Hermione withdrew her wand, muttering the unlocking spell and watching the drawer pop open. Inside, she found a few important documents of her parents, including copies of their passports and birth certificates. Just as Hermione picked up the last of the files, she noticed something. In the bottom of the drawer, one of the corners had a piece of paper peeking out from beneath it. Reaching down and withdrawing the thin parchment carefully, Hermione’s mouth fell open.</p><p>Her ears pulsed, ringing loudly with the flow of her blood. Nausea swept through her, a cool icy sensation that gave her goose flesh.</p><p>“What is it?” Ginny questioned, climbing to her feet to stand behind Hermione.</p><p>“I’m adopted.”</p>
