    <p>Finally. it had finally been Harry Potter's eighth year at Hogwarts starting tomorrow. It took all summer, with some help from Ginny, he had managed to learn the basics of the seventh year classes as promised to Headmistress McGonagall.</p><p>To Harry it felt weird having to call McGonagall "Headmistress McGonagall", it just didn't feel right.</p><p>After the trials for the Malfoys Harry decided he'd want to go back to Hogwarts rather than spending all his time in Grimmauld Place, learning seemed 10 times better than mopping around with upsetting memories and survivors guilt. </p><p>Hermione and Ron decided to attend eighth year too, so they were in the same boat. well, except for Hermione. she had already finished Headmistress McGonagall's goal for her to attend eighth year.<br/>
 <br/>
Hermione stayed at the burrow to help Ron with his assigned goal, so the only time the three of them saw each other was when Ginny decided that Harry needed out of Grimmauld Place for some fresh air and Hermione agreed the same for Ron. They would all meet outside the burrow for some brunch. </p><p>Harry clicked the locks on his last suitcase full of his belongings, then crawled into bed and sat his glasses on the nightstand. </p><p>He blinked at the ceiling as the eerie silence filled the room.</p><p>Harry became submerged into his thoughts about attending Hogwarts tomorrow, He hoped that Hogwarts would have a different atmosphere to it, and that he could finally enjoy it without waking up everyday to something disastrous. Shaking off the thought and settling on wanting to think positively about Hogwarts he began to wonder who else of his friends would attend, he heard from Ginny that Draco Malfoy was attending which soured his mood but Ginny had reassured him that after all that's happened that he's changed. She didn't tell him how but, even with an explanation he still wouldn't believe it unless he saw it. </p><p>Deciding that was enough pondering over how tomorrow might be, Harry turned his lamp off for a good night's rest.<br/>
-<br/>
"All set Harry?" Ron looked back grinning.</p><p>"yep!" Harry returned the grin and hopped on his broom.</p><p>"Alright boys please be careful, and I cannot stress enough that you don't run into the-"</p><p>"yeah! yeah, mum we know!  you've warned us of the whomping willow throughout the whole morning!" Ron shouted.</p><p>"Don't take that tone with me Ronald, or I'll send you a holler just for the fun of it!" Mrs. Weasley grabbed her son and held him in a tight embrace, then turned to Harry and he received just the same.</p><p>"Oh it only seems like yesterday you were a clueless boy to the wizarding world, Harry." She pulled away wiping a smiling, "you've grown so much I'm so very proud of you!" Mrs. Wealsey embraced Harry again, with a wipe of a tear she placed a kiss on his head and Ron's, with a hug,  and with a wave the two boys were on their way to Hogwarts.<br/>
-<br/>
It was February the 13th and Harry Potter sat in potions's class bored as ever, alongside his best mates. Ron had a thinking face on staring into space, not listening to the lesson, and Hermione did the complete opposite, by raising her hand when a question was asked almost automatically. </p><p>Harry's eyelid's became heavy until he felt a sharp pain in his side, "ouch!" He turned to his left, "Ron!" harry whispered angrily,<br/>
"sorry! I just need your opinion on something.." Ron frowned, obviously nervous about something.</p><p>Harry let out a sigh rubbing his side, "on what?"</p><p>"love,"</p><p>Harry frowned, "shouldn't you be asking H-"</p><p>"No!" Ron interrupted, Harry ran his hand through his hair in frustration,</p><p>"what is it?" </p><p>"Well,.. You see.., I want to buy love enhancement chocolates for Hermione for valentine's day.." Ron let out quickly then paused and began picking at the feather of his quill "Because I feel that we're growing apart.." </p><p> "and why would you think that?" Harry replied confused, after all they were holding hands under the dining table and reading The Daily Prophet together during breakfast this morning. Harry saw nothing departing from it. the only departing part in Hermione's eyes was when Ron decided to fling beans at Dean Thomas and Dean the same, causing a very angry McGonagall to give Ron and Dean detention over the weekend. </p><p>"..I feel like her studies are .. More important to her, I'm afraid of losing her to books." Ron's frown deepened.</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes "Ron, Hermione wont replace you with books you have a lot more to offer than some crummy book of advanced potion studies. although you should know how much of a bookworm she is." </p><p>Ron let out a groan, "B-" "silence! 10 points from Gryffindor!" shouted portrait professor Snape, causing a burst of Slytherin laughs.</p><p>"Ron! quiet!" whispered Hermione, </p><p>Ron sat up straight and didn't say another word to Harry until Professor Snape dismissed class. <br/>
-<br/>
"what were you two talking about?" Hermione asked leaning over Ron to look at Harry,</p><p>Ron looked pleadingly at Harry, "how Snape's hair could be used to cook eggs if he sat in the sun long enough.." replied Harry grinning.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow, "When you should've been paying attention to the man!"</p><p>Ron and Harry both let out sighs. </p><p>After dinner Ron continued to bother Harry non-stop about the chocolates, Harry decided he had enough and would be heading to bed early. </p><p>Harry climbed into bed with thoughts of how valentine's day would go if he and Ginny were still together. they had broke up not even two months into the first semester. As Ginny phrased it "you just don't have the potential you used to have." Harry was confused by that statement, but nonetheless he was feeling gloomier than ever afterwards, though he got over it within a month just for the sake of making this year positive as it could be.</p><p>Finally tired of thinking, Harry drifted off to sleep.<br/>
-<br/>
Ron bought the chocolates the next day hiding them in his robes, he decided on giving them to Hermione during dinner. </p><p>Ron ran next to Harry after class "Harry I bought them!" </p><p>"how nice of you.." he shook his head, why Ron thought Hermione was avoiding him was beyond him.</p><p>They both sat at their usual spots at the Gryffindor table, "Harry, I'll be back," Ron took the chocolates out after looking to see if Hermione was around yet, "hold onto these will you? She'll think you bought them for Ginny." Ron pleaded</p><p>"..fine, sure.." Harry took them and sat them on the table in front of him.</p><p>The scene not going unnoticed by a particular Slytherin. </p><p>Soon after Ron left for the bathroom Hermione came and sat next to Harry,</p><p>"evening Harry, happy valentines day!" she smiled at him</p><p>"mm," he replied stuffing his face with ham.</p><p>"you know, just because you and G-" </p><p>"no!" he shouted earning a few glances, </p><p>"okay, sorry.. It's just bothersome to see you moping on a day like this. though I suppose you have your reasons.." said Hermione patting him on the shoulder.</p><p>"exactly.." said Harry not taking his concentration off his food,</p><p>"who are the chocolates for then?" asked Hermione smiling.</p><p>Harry stopped chewing and gulped down his ham, "Luna." he replied quickly, </p><p>"..Oh, yes that's very thoughtful of you Harry. I'm sure she'll love them." She smiled and placed a slice of ham on her plate.</p><p>Harry's peace was disrupted shortly after.<br/>
-<br/>
Draco leaned on his hand finished with his food, he decided to read a book over advanced potions.</p><p>A familiar laugh caught his attention, looking over at Harry smiling set his blood racing.</p><p>Draco turns his attention back to his book only to be disturbed again,</p><p>he grits his teeth, "something the matter darling?" asks Pansy gently touching his shoulder.</p><p>"it's Potter, his laugh is obnoxious.." Draco clenches his fingers tighter on his book, not taking his narrowed eyes off Harry. </p><p>"ignore-"</p><p> But before Pansy finishes her sentence Draco gets up and walks over to Harry smirking "aww Ron bought Potter chocolates," said Draco stopping in front of Harry. Harry's head shot up, "sod off Malfoy." he growled.</p><p>Draco grabbed the chocolates, "I wonder what he'd think when he sees me with these?" he waves them in Harry's face in a teasing manner. Harry stands, "those are for Hermione, from Ron!" he said through gritted teeth ignoring Hermione's pull at his sleeve, "but by all means go on Malfoy, I'd love to see Ron knock your teeth out!" Harry glared at Draco watching him open the box, </p><p>the Slytherin table watched with giggles, most noticeably from Pansy.</p><p>Draco plucked a chocolate from the box and waved in front of Harry's face, "hm, love to see him try.." he popped a chocolate into his mouth and swallowed.<br/>
silence filled the hall.</p><p>Draco clutched his throat "ha! Couldn't handle a little chocolate Malfoy? allergic to love are you?" the whole dining hall was filled with gasps and Draco's choking, Harry realized he wasn't faking. </p><p>only before McGonagall got up had Draco stopped clawing at his throat and began panting with his hands over his face, after a minute of nothing but Draco's pants echoing through the hall, Draco began to drag his feet getting closer to the table. </p><p>Harry's eyebrows frowned in confusion, Draco placed his hands on the table, every eye was on him, Hermione's eyebrows shot up, Harry stepped back frowning, "Malf-" Draco grabbed Harry's robes looking up at him, leaning over he quickly smashed his lips onto Harry's.</p><p>Draco pulled Harry into his embrace and slid his tongue past Harry's fighting lips. </p><p>everything seemed to happen in slow motion.</p><p>Ron came back into the dining hall confused by the silence then struck by shock of the scene unfolding in front of him, matching everyone else's expressions of surprise but Draco's, of course. Being too busy entangling his hands into Harry's hair while fighting to remain kissing him deeply, Harry struggled at pushing him off. </p><p>Ron noticed the box of chocolates scattered on the floor and wondered how the bloody hell he got one when they were right in front of Harry. </p><p>Headmistress McGonagall pointed her wand at Draco in a flash, and shouted "Alarte Ascendare!" causing him to fly off the table into mid air.</p><p>"what is the meaning of this display?!" she shouted to Harry, "I..", Harry didn't even know what to say, Draco Malfoy just kissed him, were the chocolate's strong enough to make your second worst enemy kiss you? Harry wondered. Draco didn't just give him a peck on the lips, he thought to himself. he shook his head "I don't know.." he said avoiding her hawk-like stare.</p><p>Professor Mcgonagall looked down at the scattered chocolates on the ground and sorted the chocolates back into the box believing them being the cause and decided she should test their ingredients.</p><p>"my office, this instant!" she kept Draco in mid-air with him trailing above her.</p><p>Harry followed.</p><p>Ron ran over to Hermione, "what- what just happened?" he said shocked. </p><p>"you bought me love enhancement chocolates is what happened!" Hermione shook with anger and shot up dashing out of the dining hall.<br/>
-<br/>
"explain," McGonagall frowned deeply at Harry. </p><p>Harry glanced at Draco next to him being held back in a chair by a spell. </p><p>"Ron bought Hermione love enhancement chocolates, he needed to go to the restroom so I held them for him. And that's when Malfoy came and took one." he said avoiding her intense stare.</p><p>"I see.." her anger melted away into a thoughtful expression.</p><p>"Come on, we're going to the infirmary to get this sorted out." she rose from her desk and took Malfoy into mid-air again, Harry got up making his way to Madam Pomfrey with a stern looking Headmistress and a floating Malfoy struggling to reach Harry.</p><p>"There's good news and bad news." Madam Pomfrey said walking back over to them,</p><p>"Bad first, please." said Professor McGonagall, Madam Pomfrey looked to her while she made sure Draco was put under a sleep spell before proceeding.<br/>
Harry stared at Draco out of the corner of his eye, he watched his mouth inhale and exhale remembering that not even 10 minutes ago those soft pink lips were on his. not just any lips, but Malfoy's lips. Harry shivered and shook his head focusing on the problem at hand and how it could be hopefully solved.</p><p>but they weren't. </p><p>"The chocolates were made with very strong ingredients," said Madam Pomfrey,</p><p>"like what? a dragon's tooth?" asked Harry.</p><p>"not precisely, Harry. it's just how they were made and by who." </p><p>"what are you saying?" asked McGonagall</p><p>"what I'm trying to say is, the eggs, for instance, could have come from a rare type of dragon, or the person who found the ingredients could have put a strong love spell on the fresh ingredients entirely. meaning, these aren't ordinary love enhancement chocolates, they're chocolates that whoever currently holds them in their possession is who the taker falls head over heels for." she paused, "Harry, after Ron went to the bathroom they were in your possession, correct?" Madam Pomfrey asked with a sorry expression.</p><p>at that question shock struck Harry hard.</p><p>his face paled, "yes,.." </p><p>Professor McGonagall paled as well at his response.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey let out a sigh, "then I'm afraid Harry, that young Malfoy here is in love with you,.. until separated by death. his death that is.. If you were to die first he'd be lifted of the, dare I say, curse."</p><p>Harry felt sick, he felt as if his very soul had left him, leaving him standing in a shell of himself.</p><p>Professor McGonagall steadied herself by grabbing onto the edge of a dresser, "there are no remedies?! for pete's sake it's only chocolate! I've never heard anything like this with love enchantments!" she shouted,</p><p>"I'm afraid death is the only answer to end Draco's love. now, as for the good news..his love Can be reduced." she turned to Harry, "there is a potion but it doesn't quite push down all the romantic feelings for the other person, I'd say, .. 70% will still be there but that's only an assum-"</p><p>"yes! the potion please! when will it be done?" asked Harry,</p><p>"as soon as I ask Professor Snape to help brew it up. it should be done by tomorrow. but there are some rather negative side effects towards the person that takes the potion, and the person of reason for the the potion." Harry gulped and Professor McGonagall put her hand on her chest bracing for the worst.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey continued, "meaning if I were to give Draco this potion, he will still have strong thoughts of you while away from you Harry, and he may be a bit possessive around you. which may lead to actions influenced by jealousy which wont end well. when not around Harry his thoughts of him will increase." she paused. "as for possessive behavior,.. if someone were to say, mention of Harry, I'm afraid I've no clue as to what his actions will be. it would be safe to make sure that Harry is not mentioned in class, at all unless that student has a death wish." she turned to Professor McGonagall.</p><p>"I suggest Draco have private classes with his Professors and if Harry has him in a class then he should come to that private class as well. to keep Draco stable, in a way."</p><p>"in fact, he might have to be isolated from students-"</p><p>"that's ridiculous!" interrupted Professor McGonagall, "isolating a student from everyone?! I see why, but, can't his friends at least visit him? I'm sure he'd be-"</p><p>"of course they can, as long as they absolutely not mention a word of Harry, just for extra precaution.. Harry,.." she glanced at Harry, "I'm afraid you'll have to share a room with Mr. Malfoy."</p><p>"what?! isn't seeing him during private classes enough?! that'd be tor-" </p><p>"I understand," Interrupted Madam Pomfrey, "but at the moment you're his source of stability under this potion.. He will need you to keep himself, and the students of Hogwarts safe."  <br/>
McGonagall glanced at Draco with her hand over her mouth, </p><p>Harry's head began to spin. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, might not have a pinch of himself left, apart from when he's around Harry. meaning the only way for him to regain bits of himself is to stay close to Harry. Harry grabbed a chair and fell into it resting his head in his hands. </p><p>"I.. I don't know what to say.. this is all so confusing!" he shook his head not believing a word of it actually happening.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey rested a hand on his shoulder, "Mr. Potter I would say that you should stay away from him, but it could, as we already know, result in him becoming unstable. The potion only lasts a week, so he'll have to come here on Sundays for a renewed dosage."</p><p>Professor  McGonagall turned to Harry, almost regaining her posture. </p><p>"Harry, after dinner you will take him back here, to the infirmary. He is your responsibility regarding that you didn't stop him in the first place." </p><p>he lifted his head up, "but-"</p><p> "-and teased him like a child instead of handling the situation like an adult."</p><p>"and no buts!" Professor McGonagall shouted.</p><p>"off to bed Harry, and don't forget, tomorrow you will take him straight here after dinner, understood?" </p><p>"yes." he replied getting up, how did this day go from bad to worse in such a short time? he asked himself as he head for the door.</p><p>"H-Harry.."</p><p>Harry turned and saw an unlikely sight, Draco's hand reaching for Harry with tears streaking down his cheeks with an expression as if he were in deep pain.</p><p>"I love you Ha-" </p><p>Harry pulled the door open with all his force slamming it shut before Draco could finish and broke into a run, while Draco's aggressively loud cries of Harry's name echoed through the halls and began to die the further he got he prayed for peace tomorrow, but peace, he surely would not receive. </p>
