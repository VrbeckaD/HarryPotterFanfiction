          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Hello, you’ve reached Harry—“</p><p>“—and Draco,” a voice interrupted. “Don’t forget about the most important person in this flat.”</p><p>“Of course not, darling. How could I ever forget?”</p><p>“You shouldn’t. As Head Healer, I’m immensely popular. Everyone always visits <i>me</i> at St Mungo’s.”</p><p>“Keep telling yourself that,” Harry muttered.</p><p>“What was that, Scarhead?” Draco said, his voice dangerously low.</p><p>“Nothing!”</p><p>“That didn’t sound like <i>nothing</i>.”</p><p>“You’re hearing things, then. Now be quiet.”</p><p>“No one tells me to shut up.”</p><p>“Draco, shhh!”</p><p>“You’re going to regret saying that.”</p><p>“Are you threatening the Head Auror?”</p><p>“Perhaps.”</p><p>There’s a long pause.</p><p>“I’m sorry we’ve missed your call, but we’re incredibly busy at the moment—“</p><p>“—shagging!”</p><p>“Draco! No, we are <i>not</i>!”</p><p>“Shame, that.”</p><p>A long suffering sigh is heard. “Draco, you know I love you, but for Merlin’s sake, let me finish recording this message.”</p><p>“Fine, but I still don’t understand why we need a fellytone. We’re <i>wizards</i>!”</p><p>“It’s called a <i>tellyphone</i>, Draco. Besides, you never know when we might need it. Wizarding communications are not always the most reliable.”</p><p>“Is that so? I’ll be sure to tell each and every owl that delivers the post to our flat what you just said.”</p><p>“Oh, for Merlin’s sake! Please leave your message after the beep. Thank you!”</p></div>
