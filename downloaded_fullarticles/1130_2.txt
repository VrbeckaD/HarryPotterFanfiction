    <p>He was so done.</p>
<p>All the mixed emotions that caused his war with himself had finally leveled out. He knew how he felt now. There were too many times that he looked at Potter’s emerald eyes and thought about how they would be complimented by a Slytherin green romper.</p>
<p>There were too many times that he winced after insulting Hufflepuffs who did nothing to him, or that he cringed at watching Greg and Vince cause a first year to cry from being held in a headlock.</p>
<p>He was going to die one way or another, so he might as well go out with a bang.</p>
<p>That was why Draco sat in the toilets of the Slytherin dorms, carefully reading his transfiguration notes. He just had to do this right, or he might end up with something crazier than he was going for.</p>
<p>After a few failures and a self pep talk, Draco was finally admiring his new bright blue hair. He thought it would definitely piss some people off, but it still needed something. And that’s when he had an even better idea.</p>
<p>Draco’d been outside wizard London a few times with his father, but never by himself. He took the floo closest to where he needed to go, had a perplexed experience with a map, and eventually ended up looking at the sign of a muggle barber shop.</p>
<p>He was told to sit in some sort of odd chair, made of metal? And leather? It was an overall confusing experience, but he tried to act as though it was nothing out of the ordinary for him, as not to draw attention to himself.</p>
<p>Draco tried not to feel suffocated when a muggle man in an apron put some sort of fabric around him that fastened at the back of his neck. The man’s hair was shaved, with a mess of hair on the top, and Draco decided he wanted to do something similar.</p>
<p>“Hey, how are you? I’m Josh, I’ll be cutting your hair today. We get mainly regulars around here, so it’s nice to see someone new. And what you’ve got going on here is super cool. It’s so vibrant, but you don’t seem to have any dye marks on your scalp. Did you do this yourself?”</p>
<p>Draco snapped out of his stupor at how much this man talked. “Uh, yes. I did this.” The barber- Josh? What an odd name. “It’s really cool, man. You can’t be very old. Your folks know about this?” Draco puffed out his chest a bit in pride of his rebellion. “Not yet. And I’m sixteen, by the way.”</p>
<p>Josh whistled. “Hopefully I can take some of it off for you and they won’t be as upset when they find out.” He laughed easily, and Draco blushed a bit. He only had eyes for Potter, stupid attractive git, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t admire the good looks of twenty-something year old men.</p>
<p>“Hopefully it’ll make them more mad. That’s kinda what I’m going for.” Josh laughed again. “So, what are you looking for here? Standard cut is twenty, but I have a feeling you’ll need a little more time, so it’ll probably be around thirty.”</p>
<p>Draco froze. Muggle money. He’d forgotten all about it! He’d heard some of the Slytherin muggleborns- rare, but they did exist, talking about how expensive their Christmas gifts would be. He believed that their currency was called pends? He continued to try to act normal.</p>
<p>“Yes, thirty would be fine. Excellent. Thirty gal- pends. Thirty pends is what I will be spending.” Josh eyed him suspiciously. “Thirty pounds. No cents.” Shit. He was wrong. “Yes, of course, is that not what I said?” He was sweating. Oh no.</p>
<p>Josh chuckled and shook his head. “Were you planning on spending galleons? Or sickles?” Draco was speechless. Was this not a muggle barber shop? He tried to laugh it off nervously. “I don’t, uh” Josh smiled again. “Skipping class at Hogwarts, are you? It’s not every day I see a young wizard at work.”</p>
<p>Draco was terrified. Was this man working for his father? He would be slaughtered if his father knew he was in a muggle establishment </p>
<p>“Don’t be scared, kid. No one can hear us. Im a squib. I live the muggle life. My wife is a muggle. She’s expecting our first, due pretty soon, actually.”</p>
<p>Draco was still trying to comprehend all the information he had just taken in. “So, you’re not going to turn me in for sneaking out of school to make my parents mad?” Josh laughed. “Of course not. And this is on the house. Not that you’d really have any methods of payment.”</p>
<p>Draco tried to hide the sheepish look on his face. “Now, let’s get to your hair. I have an idea that’ll look good with your face shape and might piss your parents off, if you’ll trust me.”</p>
<p>Normally, Draco wouldn’t have wanted someone else choosing what would happen to his hair, but in the spirit of rebellion, he nodded. Josh pulled out some sort of metallic object that Draco was desperately trying to hide his fascination with, and put it to the back of Draco’s head.</p>
<p>—————————————————————</p>
<p>Draco smirked at his appearance one more time. Vince and Greg’s jaws had dropped so far to the floor when they’d seen him, Draco decided to make a snarky comment that would hopefully be one of his last to the sadistic duo.</p>
<p>“Close your mouths, cronies. The flys’ll get in.”</p>
<p>He strolled into the great hall, perfectly at ease. The giant room went almost silent when he walked in sight. He had decided to be fashionably late to lunch, hoping he’d be one of the last to walk in so he could make a grand entrance. </p>
<p>In the past few months, he hadn’t had a particular liking to attention, far from his cries to be the center of everything in first year. He’d taken to sitting with Pansy and Blaise at mealtime anyways recently, so he nonchalantly walked up to the Slytherin table and sandwiched himself between them.</p>
<p>“Pudding, please, Blaise.” He spoke, casual as ever. Blaise did not pass the pudding. He only stared at Draco’s vibrantly blue hair, completed with a shaved side that faded into the longer top. </p>
<p>Draco only smiled and looked around the room to gage the various reactions. The professors’ table was definitely a favorite, with Professor Flitwick’s eyes bulging out of his head. McGonagall’s reaction actually surprised him. He was sure she’d look at him with silent distain, and she did, but something about that twinkle in her eye made him believe she actually approved of the change.</p>
<p>He finally brought himself to turn his head to the Gryffindor table, where some quiet chatter had resumed, undoubtedly about his hair. Weasley’s mouth was open, eyes wide with a hint of disgust as well as silent respect, both competing for their fair share.</p>
<p>Granger looked eerily like McGonagall, their noses upturned in the exact same way, and her eyes held the same twinkle of joy that told him she was happy for his rebellion. He cracked a half smile in her direction, which turned into a full laugh when he watched her gently close Weasley’s mouth.</p>
<p>But Potter, he was the shining gem of all the shocked faces. His eyebrows seemed to be permanently raised, with his mouth opened in a tiny O. He was flushed, face red at the sight of Draco. Draco decided that was a good thing. He sent a tiny wave in their direction, and turned back to his table with a flourish.</p>
