    <p>Like most complicated things in life, this story starts with a boy, a secret and a smile.</p><p>Even in retrospect, they seem like they’ve been scribbled on a scrap piece of paper and blindly plucked from a nice, big bowl of <em>what-else-can-the-universe-thrust-at-me </em>for the sake of twisted arbitrary, but not everything is as it seems, and everything seems ridiculous and inconvenient. At the same time, maybe you should have seen this coming. Maybe you should have predicted the shit storm that was going to spin your life into vertigo, like the earth has been tipped off its axis, latitude and longitude slipping and colliding while the corners of the map fade to ash.</p><p>It happens, as you would later realize with an impending sense of doom, like this:</p><p>In the summer of 1994, you and your friends stumble through the forest, looking for an old boot.</p><p>The forest breathes a cool sigh of air against your cheeks as you wander past the trees, eyes glued to the ground for the boot. Every time your mind drifts to the Quidditch World Cup, the excitement begins to bubble up inside your stomach and you can’t fight back the smile that spreads across your face whenever you reflect on the past few days. Staying at the Burrow was always like an improved version of home, but this time, it’s different somehow.</p><p>Perhaps it’s the freedom of staying somewhere that isn’t your home. Not that your place isn’t comfortable; you don’t think anyone could deem a Victorian mansion with sprawling, manicured lawns ‘uncomfortable’. But it’s starting to feel more like a sad skeleton with marble walls for skin instead of a home, especially with your father always working and your brother, Luke, staying with his Slytherin friends for the summer.</p><p>There’s something about the company, too, that makes this moment so special. Being reunited with the Weasley family and being welcomed into their home is always like visiting relatives. The good kind, who always send you postcards and Christmas sweaters. And there’s always something to catch up on with Hermione. Then there’s Harry…</p><p>You glance at Harry, who is sifting through the leaves beside you. He’s talking about…something…one hand jammed into the pocket of his jeans, the other swinging by his side, and it’s somewhat refreshing to see Harry so <em>relaxed</em>, so undeniably Harry. Warmth thrums through your veins like honey and you can’t help but smile as you regard him fondly in the late morning sun.</p><p>It’s been a while since you’ve shared a moment alone with your best friend. Usually, you’re joined by Ron and Hermione, but they’re currently preoccupied with a debate over…whatever they debate over. You can actually hear them bickering; Hermione’s voice tight and shrill and Ron’s sarcastic remarks muffled by the distance between you and them.</p><p>With the sound of their bickering in the background, and the warmth of Harry’s presence forming a bubble around you, the urge to chisel <em>‘I love my friends’ </em>onto every single rib in your ribcage floods you like a wave of sunlight. It’s essentially how you feel when you’re not saving Hogwarts from corrupt teachers and giant basilisk or helping innocent fugitives escape the kiss of a Dementor. And moments like these remind you just how fortunate you are to have found your friends.</p><p>Harry’s gentle chuckle brings your wandering thoughts back into the moment as it fades into a gleeful smile.</p><p>“You should have seen the look on his face…” Harry smirks, though the context of the conversation is lost to you.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah. Now Dudley second guesses himself whenever he tries to bully me. He’s constantly looking over his shoulder because he’s expecting Sirius to jump out and turn him into – I don’t know¬– a dung beetle,” he pauses and then barks a laugh like he’s just remembered something, “Or a pig! Did I tell you about the time Hagrid gave Dudley a pigs tail?”  </p><p>“He <em>didn’t</em>…” you gasp, and Harry gives you an exaggerated, shit-eating grin, “<em>Merlin</em>, he actually did!”</p><p>“When he first told me that I was a wizard and delivered my letter to me…he used his umbrella and…” Harry mimics pointing an umbrella at a stone and pretends to cast the spell. You playfully punch his shoulder and Harry recoils with a yelp.</p><p>“<em>That</em> was for not telling me,” you scold, fighting back the smile that’s tickling the corners of your lips, “I thought we agreed to tell each other stupid stuff that happens to our relatives.”</p><p>Harry pouts an apology, “Can I make it up to you?”</p><p>“You can,” you smirk, “but are you prepared to pay the price?”</p><p>“Whatever it is, I’m sure I can handle it,” Harry grins.</p><p>There is a fleeting moment where the two of you stare at each other in silence, but the moment is broken with a laugh as you both dissolve into hysterical laughter. A good five minutes pass before you cradle your stomach and heave out a sigh, attempting to regain your composure. Once the remainders of your chortles and giggles fade, you notice a strange look crossing Harry’s face as he stares at you.</p><p>“What is it?” you ask, breathlessly, wiping away tears.</p><p>“(Y/N) I–”</p><p>“(Y/N)?” a curious voice asks from somewhere behind you. You swivel around at the sound of your name, lips curling into a smile when you see Cedric Diggory standing behind you.</p><p>Your mouth goes a little bit dry.</p><p>“Hi Cedric,” you smile as Cedric approaches, and you suddenly feel self-conscious and bashful.</p><p>Your eyes travel over him as he draws closer. He’s tall and broad and athletic, bronzed skin and eyes so blue you could <em>drown</em>. His expression is one of pure delight, like stumbling upon you had been the best thing that’s happened since Christmas, and it’s so genuine it almost convinces you that it’s true. And his smile; gracious and gentle and golden–</p><p>That smile of his could cure every disease known to man.</p><p>“It’s good to see you,” He grins, boyishly, sounding genuinely pleased.</p><p>“You too,” you reply, your voice sounding distant like you’ve stepped outside of your own body and your mouth is moving on its own accord.</p><p>Cedric gazes at you with a gentle warmth, eyes as blue as a clear, summer sky, drawing you in. And there’s something inviting about his smile like his lips want to reach down and embrace yours in a tender kiss–</p><p>Harry clears his throat and it jolts through you like electricity, almost startling you “Oh, Cedric, this is Harry. Harry, this is Cedric–”</p><p>“It’s great to finally meet you now that we’re off the Quidditch field, Harry,” Cedric beams, extending his hand.</p><p>Harry takes it, “Yeah, you too…”</p><p>Cedric turns back to you, the blue in his eyes washing over you like a wave, “How was your summer?”</p><p>You put a little too much effort into a smile you hope looks graceful “Oh, um, it was…pleasant.”</p><p>“Pleasant?”</p><p>“Yeah. Harry and I have been staying with the Weasleys. How’s yours?”</p><p>“Pleasant,” He echoes, grinning, and you feel heat tickle apples of your cheeks, “I met this girl at the end of last year and she…she’s really something y’know? I can’t seem to get her off my mind…”</p><p>Cedric trails off into a sigh, gazing into your eyes. You’re reminded of a wilted fire lily pressed between the pages of a dozen letters, all of them signed off with a curling ‘<em>C</em>’; long strands of amber butterbeer melting over your tongue; a spring breeze fragranced with wildflowers and the promise of romance; and a smile, soft and reassuring and setting your entire world alight in a fiery blaze of heat and passion.</p><p>Harry clears his throat again and it whips both of you back into the present.</p><p>“Looking forward to the game?” Cedric asks.</p><p>“Definitely,” you grin, excitedly, “This is Harry’s first Quidditch World Cup,”.  </p><p>“It is?” Cedric peers around you and smiles at Harry, “You’re going to love it. Especially this game; two teams at the top of their game, competing for the trophy…”</p><p>“It’ll be interesting to see who wins,” You remark, pensively, “Penelope will probably want me to write an article about the game for The Howler, no doubt.”</p><p>“I’ll look forward to seeing it,” Cedric remarks, “I admire your articles anyway.”</p><p>Your heart staggers clumsily around in your chest like someone’s reached down and yanked it up into your throat. Your face is definitely changing colours now; you can feel the heat of a bright red blush burning your cheeks like sunburn.</p><p>“Y-You do?”</p><p>“Yeah! I genuinely look forward to reading everything you write. They’re interesting and well written. I especially liked the one about the Toad Choir…”  </p><p>Your mouth flaps open as you search for words, stumbling over letters and syllables like a bashful child, “Well–uh–I–”</p><p>“–Over here, Arthur! Over here, son! I’ve found the Portkey!”</p><p>Amos Diggory’s voice split through the still air, the echo rippling through the trees and startling some sparrows.</p><p>Relieved by the distraction, you spin on your heel and follow the sound of Mr Diggory’s guffaw’s and Mr Weasley’s voice. Cedric walks on your right side, Harry on your left. It is suddenly unbearably hot like the sun is boring its fiery gaze into your soul. An itch forms on the inside of your wrist as though there was an insect wiggling beneath the thin skin. You claw at it hastily, fingers fumbling with your bracelet in an effort to distract yourself. </p><p>Hermione and Ron join you a few minutes later while Mr Weasley introduces his family to Mr Diggory. As they talk, you can feel Hermione’s eyes moving over you as though she were micro-managing every movement that you make, like you’re pinned beneath a microscope. You turn to her, unsurprised by her expression. She raises her brows expectantly, her eyes darting between you and Cedric.</p><p>“Oh,” you bleat, turning to Cedric, “Guys, this is Cedric. Cedric, this is Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.”</p><p>Cedric’s lips quirk into a genuine smile, “Pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>“You too,” Hermione smiles gracefully.</p><p>“Yeah,” Ron agrees. <em>Well, at least they can agree on something.</em></p><p>Mr Diggory makes his way over, clapping a hand on Cedric’s shoulder and regarding you curiously. Cedric introduces you to Mr Diggory and his lips curve into a knowing smirk.</p><p>“So you’re the writer my son can’t stop talking about,” Mr Diggory’s remark is followed by a firm handshake, “It’s good to finally meet you in the flesh, (Y/N).”</p><p>Cedric’s face flushes an intriguing shade of pink, “Dad…”</p><p>Mr Diggory barks a warm, boisterous laugh that rattles your chest, “Don’t worry, son, I don’t think she’s going anywhere soon.”</p><p>He turns to face you, his benevolent, round face beaming at you, “Cedric showed me an article you wrote about last year’s Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff. Beautifully written. You’re a real talent, y’know. Though I shouldn’t expect any less, given that your old man is the editor-and-chief of the Daily Prophet.”</p><p>Warmth glows beneath your cheeks as you smile bashfully at Mr Diggory, “Well, thank you, sir.”</p><p>“<em>Sir</em>,” Mr Diggory echoes, followed by a single laugh that punches the air. He turns to Cedric, whose boyish features ripple between embarrassment and pride, and jabs him in the ribs, “She’s a keeper, Ced.”</p><p>Cedric winces, an adorable, pink flush blossoming across his cheeks as he fumbles to change the subject, “Er, Dad, we should probably get moving.”  </p><p>“Right you are,” Mr Diggory nods, his gaze searching for Mr Weasley amongst the throng of redheads.</p><p>As the conversation moves toward Mr Weasley and – predictably– steers toward Harry, you meet Cedric’s eyes and he offers you a bashful, apologetic smile.</p><p>You pray to God, Jesus and Merlin that he can’t hear the <em>tha-thump </em>of your racing heart.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Portkeys are, perhaps, the second worst way to travel. The first is through the Floo Network because it’s dusty and dirty but Portkeys are…sudden, and the uncomfortable tug in your stomach only makes you feel dizzy and slightly nauseous.  </p><p>Fortunately, you’re not the only one who fell face-first on the ground and consequently got a mouthful of dirt. When your vision finally stops spinning, you notice most of the Weasley family collapsed on the ground. Ron groans beside you as Hermione and Harry scramble to their feet. Mr Weasley, Mr Diggory and Cedric are the only ones standing, the latter of whom looks a little windswept. He bends down and offers you a hand.</p><p>“You alright?” he asks, concern pinching his perfectly chiselled face. You nod and bite your lip as he helps your sorry self to your feet.</p><p>You dust the dirt from your grass-stained knees and iron out your denim skirt with the palms of your hands, using it as an excuse to tame your pounding heart. Pushing your hair back, you flash Cedric a shy smile, “Thanks.”</p><p>“Happy to be of help,” Cedric grins.</p><p>“<em>Of course</em> you are…” George snickers from behind Cedric and Fred snorts.</p><p>Cedric swivels around and flashes a polite smile, “Pardon?”</p><p>The sun’s heat feels concentrated, baking you with the kind of heat that could shrivel a Sunday roast. The itch returns to the inside of your wrist and you nervously scratch at it with newfound intensity. </p><p>“Oh, nothing, your <em>Highness</em>,” Fred mimes an exaggerated bow, “Er, I mean, Cedric.”</p><p>“Good ol’ Ced,” George winks, glancing between you and Cedric. </p><p>Fred claps a hand on Cedric’s shoulder, “Ric…can I call you Ric?”</p><p>“Well–”</p><p>“Anyway,” you interject before this conversation can get any more embarrassing, “We should probably get moving.”</p><p>Without even thinking, you take Cedric’s hand and lead him away from the twins, hoping to create as much distance between you and them as possible. You finally come to a stop behind Ginny and Hermione.</p><p>“That was….”</p><p>“Awkward?” you suggest.</p><p>“I was going to say ‘Interesting’, but ‘awkward’ works, too.” Cedric offers you a lazy, boyish smile. </p><p>You realize your fingers are still interlaced with his and you jerk away from him hastily, as though he’s infected with a contagious virus, and anyone else would be offended by it but not Cedric. Instead, he eyes you with an expression that resembles amusement or intrigue or both, but he doesn’t say anything. You kind of want to leap into a barren, boundless void and hibernate in there for a few thousand years.</p><p>“So, my dad is going to hang out with his Ministry friends tonight,” Cedric begins, glancing away shyly, “He…erm…says it’s his ‘Quidditch tradition.’”</p><p>“So you’re essentially being ditched by your own dad,” you snort, “Nice.”</p><p>“Well, here’s the thing…if I say I have company then he won’t feel so bad.”</p><p>You blink at him, “What are you saying?”</p><p>Cedric smiles boyishly, “Well…I’m saying…asking, really….if you’d like to come over and we can sit around a fire and eat s’mores and just chat. I like talking to you instead of having to send an owl all the time.”</p><p>You bite your lip and nod, “Okay. So it’ll just be…us?”</p><p>“What will ‘just be us?’” Ron sidles up to the two of you, Harry following. Harry’s eyes move between you and Cedric. There is something unreadable in his gaze. </p><p>“Oh, I was just….” Cedric flushes, as though he were internally battling something, before conceding with a somewhat forced smile “Would you guys like to meet up later tonight?”</p><p>“Sure,” Ron shrugs, “Anything to get away from them two.” He jabs a thumb at Fred and George.</p><p>“Oh we’re coming too!” George chimes, “We don’t know what it is but if it’s going to be fun, we’re there.”</p><p>“Otherwise we’ll make it fun.” Fred adds.</p><p>You turn to Cedric, who is graciously trying to stave a grimace, “Of course. You guys can come too.”</p><p>“Come along then, son.” Mr Diggory waves Cedric over, smiling at the two of you, “We’d better settle in before the game begins.”</p><p>The game isn’t for a few hours but Cedric doesn’t argue the point. Instead, he gives you a lingering look and grazes his hand against yours, “I’ll see you later on tonight.”</p><p>“See you tonight,” you call after him, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p><em>Later on tonight</em>, you think with a smile. Your mind pulls apart the words and stitches them back together, your heart singing like a dove in your ribcage.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Out of the hundreds of wizards and witches gathered on the camping grounds, you just <em>have</em> to run into a familiar, blonde-haired <em>prat</em>, like he’s a rather annoying shadow.</p><p>Whether you like it or not, Draco Malfoy is always there, just waiting to claw his hands into whatever is left of your optimism for the day and tear it to shreds. You can’t even go on a walk with your friends without him popping out of a bush or crawling out of some den like a predator. Even if you’re soaring on a high from Cedric’s earlier invitation, Malfoy almost insists on wiggling his way under your skin. He’s an irritation you haven’t learned how to scratch yet.</p><p>You nudge Harry in the ribs when you spot the boy, nodding in Malfoy’s direction. Thankfully, it’s just the four of you, and you remember with a sense of relief that Mr Weasley isn’t here. You don’t want a repetition of what happened the last time he encountered a Malfoy, even if he <em>is</em> a miniature one.</p><p>But before either of you can react, Malfoy has already spotted you and he’s swaggering over to the four of you with a malicious glint dancing in his cold, blue eyes before you can formulate a plan of escape. </p><p>“I knew I could smell something foul,” Malfoy scorns, crinkling his nose, “You can smell a Weasley from a mile away from the stench that reeks off them. I suppose you <em>all</em> can’t afford to take showers every day since there’s so many of you. Got to save water now, don’t we?”</p><p>Draco snickers gleefully as Ron’s fists curl at his sides. His face is flushed crimson with anger as Hermione grips his wrist warningly.</p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry spits, his tone cold and venomous, “The only putrid smell around here is <em>you</em>.”</p><p>“Please, Potter, don’t play pretend,” Draco sneers, “Just because no one knocked any sense into you doesn’t mean we have to put up with the peasant and the mudblood.”</p><p>“You watch your mouth, Malfoy!” Ron snarls, “Before I break it in with my fist.”</p><p>“I’d like to see you try,” Draco smirks, challengingly.</p><p>“We all know you’re a coward,” Harry snaps, “Your dad isn’t here so you don’t have to prove your worth anything.”</p><p>Draco’s expression darkens, “What would <em>you</em> know about fathers, <em>your</em> father is dead.”</p><p>Harry moves to lunge at Draco but Hermione pulls him back. You can almost feel the loathing rolling off Harry as his mouth twists into a frown and his eyes light up like emerald flames. You turn to Draco, imploring him with a pleading look.  </p><p>“Look, you’re wasting all of our time. We’ve got better things to do…”</p><p>Draco sniffs, fixing a glare on you, “You’re lucky you’ve got your pretty, little girlfriend here to protect you, Potter. Next time, I’ll make sure you’re not so fortunate.”</p><p>Draco whirls around and leaves before any of you can say another word.</p><p>“Good riddance,” Ron spits, his temper simmering, “He always has to ruin everything…”</p><p>Hermione rolls her eyes, “Don’t let stuck-up snobs like Malfoy put you down. It’s the World Cup. Forget about it.”</p><p>Hermione drags Ron away, charging through the crowd. You’re about to follow her, too, but notice that Harry is rooted to the ground where he stands. You put a hand on his shoulder and rub soothing circles, hoping to release some tension.</p><p>“Forget about Malfoy, Harry,” you smile, “Let’s enjoy the moment and look forward to the game…” <em>and spending the night with Cedri</em>c your mind whispers as your heart leaps excitedly.</p><p>Harry offers you a weary half-smile as you take his hand, tracing comforting circles across the top of his thumb. He’s always been good at deflecting Malfoy’s attacks. But there’s something ominous in the way he stares at you that has you thinking that maybe this isn’t over. </p><p>You don’t bother to bring it up, though, hoping Harry will release it with all his other worries.</p>
