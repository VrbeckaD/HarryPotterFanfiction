    <p>Hermione tread through the tunnel, knowing she was getting dirt on Harry’s invisibility cloak and being too nervous to care. She wiped the potion bottle she was holding on her robes, made sticky by her sweaty palms. The end of the tunnel drew nearer with every shaky step; she would put on her disguise once she got to the shack.</p><p>For the nth time, Hermione questioned her sanity in agreeing to do this. Sneaking out? Endangering herself? Breaking tons of school rules? It was very out of character for her. If she got caught—well, that didn’t even bear thinking about.</p><p>Hermione felt she should be doing this under the cloak of night, the darkness hiding her crimes. That it was the middle of the day, with light streaming through the windows and birds chirping, felt inappropriate. She took off the cloak as she entered the Shrieking Shack and unstoppered the potion, wrinkling her nose at the smell. She considered the bottle for a long time and the bright, almost neon yellow color of its contents. Then, without warning, she tipped her head up and downed it all.</p><p>Hermione felt a prickle spread outwards from her torso to the ends of her arms and legs. Her skin felt stretched and itchy in its wake, which wasn’t helped by her clothes pressing into her. They were slightly too small for her now, although she knew they still fit.</p><p>Hermione wandered around for a mirror, wanting to double-check that the aging potion had worked.</p><p>She was quite proud of herself for thinking of using a potion for a disguise. Although underage magic was not allowed outside of school, the law did not forbid consuming a potion. By using a potion in the Shrieking Shack instead of spelling something on in school, she could avoid the risk of someone seeing her in disguise at Hogwarts. Plus, if someone checked her wand for identity-concealing spells, they wouldn’t find anything incriminating. It was genius!</p><p>Hermione smiled smugly to herself. She had found the potion while browsing <em>The Book of Unusual Brews.</em>  The brew was an aging potion that doubled your current age. It made for a good cover-up, but most importantly, most of its ingredients were things in her beginners’s potions kit. It was perfect.</p><p>Her smile lessened when she viewed herself in the mirror, however. There was a reason this potion was not commonly used. It was not strong enough to overcome most age restriction charms, which warded off the minors trying to sneak into an event. You also couldn’t choose what age you wanted; it was always twice your current.</p><p>But worst of all (at least to Hermione right now) was that it had the side effect of turning your hair into the most disgusting shade of blond. It was an unappealing color between soggy sponge and old teeth. Combined with her rat’s nest of a hairstyle, there truly was never a more horrendous sight.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. It didn’t matter. In fact, it helped her disguise. She never cared about her appearance before, and there was no reason to start now. The rest of her looked fine anyway.</p><p>She was an inch or two taller now, and a bit more filled out. Her teenage fashion looked a bit strange on a thirty-year old, but it was not totally out of place Hermione decided.</p><p>However, the biggest change was in her face. She looked more mature, worldlier. Hermione liked the difference; it almost made up for the hair. She gave a sly smile to her reflection. Although she would swear otherwise to anyone who asked, an undeniable part of her liked the thrill of breaking the rules.</p>
<hr/><p>Hermione ambled onto the main street of Hogsmeade as casually as she could. She resisted the sudden urge to cover her face and kept her hands resolutely in her pockets. It would not do to act suspicious and draw attention now.</p><p>She dreaded the thought of getting caught. Was her walking a little too stiff? Eyes a little too shifty? No, breathing, don’t speed up now!</p><p>Honestly, the things she did for Harry! Hermione knew that her anger was unfair, though. She had agreed to this, hadn’t she?</p>
<hr/><p>“Harry, Ron!” whispered Hermione excitedly as she entered the common room. “I’ve found something!” She dropped a thick book on the table in front of them.</p><p>“Hey, our game!” Harry griped. Hermione then noticed the chess pieces scattered around by her book.</p><p>“Oh, sorry,” Hermione said, not really that sorry. What she had found was simply too important.</p><p>“A book. Fascinating,” Ron drawled, annoyance in his eyes as well.</p><p>“Oh hush,” she huffed, exasperated. “It’s to help Harry in the second task.”</p><p>“Really? How?” he asked, bad mood forgotten. Ron had been really keen on helping Harry ever since abandoning him during the first task.</p><p>Hermione flicked to the right page and pointed triumphantly at it. “There! Gillyweed! ‘Consuming allows the subject to breathe underwater...’”</p><p>“Hermione, this is brilliant!” Harry gushed as he scanned the rest of the page.</p><p>“Well, we always knew she was.” Hermione blushed at this, and spied a matching red tinge on Ron’s cheeks as he realized what he had said.</p><p>“How do you suppose we’ll get some?” questioned Harry, oblivious to the tension between his friends.</p><p>“We could always just nab some from Snape—“</p><p>“No.” The word was said forcefully, startling Hermione and Ron to look at Harry. “I’m not about to go ahead and do what he’s accusing me of and prove him right.”</p><p>Hermione allowed herself to fume a little at Professor Snape. If he weren’t so hateful of Harry, they could probably just ask the man for some.</p><p>“Well, Harry, I don’t see another way of getting it short of buying it ourselves.” Hermione knew this was the wrong thing to say as soon as she said it.</p><p>“Hermione...” Harry pleaded.</p><p>“No—”</p><p>“Could you sneak into Hogsmeade? Buy some gillyweed?”</p><p>“Harry—“</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>Hermione sighed. She couldn’t deny Harry really needed this gillyweed. There wasn’t enough time to find a different way to breathe underwater. But still...”What about Ron?”</p><p>Ron’s countenance darkened. “Can’t. Detention this Saturday with the bat.”</p><p>For once she didn’t correct him. Bloody bat indeed.</p><p>Harry’s face then collapsed, looking sorry. “It’s fine, I’ll do it, Hermione. I don’t want to force you,” he murmured.</p><p>Hermione knew what her decision was, then. Harry was under so much stress, and she could help in this little way.</p><p>“No, no, you get into enough trouble already. I’ll do it.”</p>
<hr/><p>So here she was, sneaking through Hogsmeade as a thirty-year-old woman with ghastly yellow hair.</p><p>Hermione scanned the storefronts for Dogweed and Deathcap, Hogsmeade’s herbology shop. However, the name of a different shop soon caught her eye.</p><p>“Tomes and Scrolls,” Hermione whispered to herself, reading the name of the bookstore aloud. Immediately, she felt a pull towards it. She wanted to go in, knowing what was inside: books bursting with knowledge.</p><p>No! She mentally shook her head. She would not get distracted. She was here to buy gillyweed and get the hell out. A bookstore would not help Harry.</p><p>But...maybe it could. Who knew what information on gillyweed she could find in there? It wouldn’t hurt to learn a little more. And besides, she deserves this! If she’s the one sneaking out, she should be allowed to go where she wanted to. It would only be for a little while.</p><p>Mind made, Hermione marched into the store, grinning as she inhaled the scent of old books. Oh boy, where to?</p><p>“Hello, welcome to Tomes and Scrolls!” cheerily greeted a store person.</p><p>Hermione’s resulting gasp was highly audible as she nearly jumped out of her Mary Jane’s.</p><p>“Oh, I’ve scared you! Sorry about that! Was there anything you needed?”</p><p>She resisted the urge to snap at the woman to go away. Remember, stay unassuming and unmemorable.</p><p>“I’m fine, thank you.” Now screw off.</p><p>“Okay, don’t be afraid to ask if you have an questions!” She flashed me a beaming smile.</p><p>Hermione immediately felt guilty for thinking so uncharitably about the woman, even if it was only in her head. She blamed the nerves for making her snappy, and set off in search for a book to relax with.</p><p>At the front of the store were books on transfiguration. Hermione strode through the aisle, not really in the mood but checking anyway. Next was charms, potions, arithmancy...</p><p>Hermione eventually found herself at the back of the stone in the miscellaneous section. Here, a glimmer in the corner of her eye caught her attention. It was a book title written in gold: <em>The Morality of Magic</em>.</p><p>Hermione reached for it, unknowingly compelled. She turned the book over in her hand, observing its royal purple hue, before flipping to a random page and reading from the top.</p><p>“<em>...aspects of pureblood supremacy are well-intentioned.</em>” What? What kind of bigoted book had she just picked up? Despite that fact, Hermione read on. “<em>Some people see the ideals as protective, not just for wizards but for muggles also. For example, some oppose wizards dating muggles for the same reason we do not allow teachers to date their students: the difference in power. Or, at least, a perceived difference in power. There is—“</em></p><p>“Interesting book?” interrupted a smooth voice behind her ear, and for the second time that day, Hermione almost had a heart attack.</p><p>She startled backwards into the body behind her, flinched away when she bumped into him, and quickly whirled around to stare directly into the face of Professor Snape.</p><p>“Oh, don’t be alarmed. I only meant to inquire as to what you were reading.” When Hermione didn’t say anything, he continued, looking down at the book now held limply in her hands. “Dahlia Niom. A controversial author, especially due to the book you’re holding right now.”</p><p>“Huh,” she said faintly. Snape had caught her. She was doomed. There would be no foreseeable end to her detentions.</p><p>“I don’t recall ever seeing you before. Did you go to Hogwarts?” he then asked, and Hermione suddenly felt a spark of hope. He didn’t recognize her; he didn’t recognize her! Thank God for second-rate aging potions!</p><p>“Oh, yeah, I was homeschooled,” she replied, desperately trying to brainstorm a way to get out of this situation without raising the Professor’s suspicion. “We’ve never seen each other before, probably.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at this. “Then let me introduce myself. I am Severus Snape, professor of potions at Hogwarts. It’s a pleasure to meet you...?”</p><p>“Sarah. Uh, Sarah Smith.” Hermione stuck out a hand.</p><p>Instead of shaking it, he looked at her coyly before—oh merlin—before grasping her hand and raising it to his lips. Hermione then experienced the surreal feeling of her professor’s lips on her hand. It made her shiver. She quickly drew her arm away.</p><p>“If I may be so bold,” he asked, still giving her that arresting look, “how old are you?”</p><p>“Uh, just turned thirty.” Technically not a lie—she had literally used the aging potion not much more than an hour ago. “What about you?” she returned shakily.</p><p>“I just turned thirty-five myself.” Snape was only in his thirties? “It appears we are the same age.”</p><p>“Er, yeah.”</p><p>“You know, I find that quite fortunate,” he said silkily.</p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p>Unexpectedly, Snape slid closer, placing his hand above her on the bookshelf. When he spoke, she could feel his breath on her ear: “It means it would not be inappropriate if I asked you on a date.”</p><p>Alarms went off in her head. He was too close, too close! And why did that make her feel warm and tingly inside?</p><p>She slid out sideways along the bookcase, slowly stepping backwards away from him. “Oh, wow, um, I’m flattered, but, I-I’m really not looking to date right now.”</p><p>“Pity.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, nice talking to you, I have to go now, uh, bye!” She knew she sounded horribly flustered, but she was too concerned with escaping to care.</p><p>Realizing she was still holding the book, she thrust it at him, said an awkward bye again, and bolted out the store.</p><p>Hermione was very tempted to just bolt all the way back to Hogwarts, helping Harry be damned! Instead, she headed for the herbology store while attempting to ignore the glaring fact Professor Snape had just flirted with her. And no, she was not aroused by it! It was the adrenaline. Yeah, it was just the adrenaline. Oh boy.</p><p>What Hermione didn’t see was the black-clad man chuckle to himself as she rushed out the store, satisfaction present on his face at bewildering one of the Golden Trio. Imagine a Potions Master not noticing when someone was using a very obvious aging potion! He looked down at the book in this hands, looked back up, and decided to take it to the counter. There remained a satisfied smirk on his face even as he finished his shopping and walked back to Hogwarts.</p>
