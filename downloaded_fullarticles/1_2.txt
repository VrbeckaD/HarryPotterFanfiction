  <em> <u> "22 years ago, Anna was known as Anneil, and Hannah was known as Hanna. Both angels, one remembered everything the other need time to. I gave them that," She replied before humming," I wasn't lying Nixi when I told you what I was, who I was Before. I've witnessed the worst of humanity and of other beings. Watch my own world destroy its self to stop mass genocide... There where so many times I wanted to tell you and I would've done sooner. But I..." </u> </em>
</p><p><em> <u> She was cut off by soft lips on her own. Her eyes widen as Nixi kissed the Archangel of Love. </u> </em> </p><p>As she returned the kiss, twenty years worth of dread, worry, and fear melted off her shoulders. There was a sound of fabric tearing as Tenebris's wings unravelled from where ever she hid them and wrapped around the two. </p><p>Nixi pulled from the kiss needing air and hummed," We should move..."</p><p>Tenebris frowned and said," why... oh. Uh... yeah. Yeah, deffently should move." </p><hr/><p>
  <strong> LA; 1.5 days later </strong>
</p><p>Dean was tired. He and Sam had drove in turns from Ohio to LA. They were now staying at a super 8 near Lux (It was coindience on their part). He sighed and looked at the beds before saying," I need 3 hours before we talk to anyone." </p><p>Sam yawned," Yeah, yeah... agreed." </p><p>Abel shook his head," You two do that, I am going go to that club nearby. See what up you know?"</p><p>"Be careful," Dean said. Abel chuckled," I'll be fine Dean."</p><p>He waved them off and head out. </p><p>It didn't take him long to reach the club and once he was inside he hummed to himself before walking over to the bar. At the bar, a gorgeous woman stood pouring drinks. She looked at him and frowned a little before asking," What can i get 'cha?" </p><p>"Side-car?" He asked. She nodded before asking," not from around here are ya?"</p><p>"Not really, no. You?" He asked. She hummed," From the south."</p><p>"Abel?" </p><p>He turned around to see Crowley, Cata, and two others. It was Cata who had spoke. Abel smiled and said," Cata... you look better."</p><p>"She better be. I don't know what she was thinking putting herself in a situation like that," The other female growled. Cata looked at her and said," Laura..."</p><p>She sighed before inducing the three," Abel Milligan, this is Laura and Derek Hale. My pack members. Maze a round of whiskey?" </p><p>"You got it Lupines," Maze saluted before handing Abel his side-car. The four of them sat down at one of the round tables and Crowley asked," So, Abel what brought you here?"</p><p>"To Lux or LA?" </p><p>Derek frowned as Crowley looked at him and said," Both, I suppose."</p><p>"You know Ruby?" </p><p>The demon nodded and Abel counited," She dropped us a hit about a girl who could hear angels that had escaped from a psych ward. Nixi was involved so Sam did some digging and saw Sphinx..." </p><p>"Ah... Anna then. Right, you three might want to call Sphinx then," Cata interrupted. Abel frowned," We did. No answer."</p><p>Crowley frowned before sighing," I wonder..." </p><p>He looked at them before saying," I am going to go check in on Sphinx. I'll call." </p><p>He got up and head, not towards the elevator that Abel had taken up but another one. </p><hr/><p>Crowley walked into the penthouse where Jörmungandr, Fenrir, and two others. He froze as he noticed that one of them were Uriel. The other was Castiel he knew that. He glanced at Fenrir who nodded slowly at him. With a thought, Crowley sunk down to the floor as he transformed into a snake. He slithered over to Jörmungandr and hissed," <em> Whatsss hisss hesss doingss hereissss?" </em></p><p><em> "Their lookingsss forsss Aunt Anna, Shesss withs Aunty Sphisssx and Nixssi."  </em>Jörmungandr hissed back in reply. Crowley slithered out to the open patio door and around the rails then over to a flat side before shifting back and unfurling his wings. He smiled before lunching off the building and letting the wind currents catch his fall as he flew for the first time in ages( he would have teleported but the fact that he didn't want Uriel to catch him at the moment. He didn't think they would be too thrilled with him at the momment{ nor was he sure if either heaven or hell had figured out the Swap yet} and he didn't want to risk it anymore then he had to). He swooped down and spiralled as he flew off towards Grace Street. </p><hr/><p>Landing in his sister's bedroom balcony on her third floor( fourth for Americans) gave him a sight he wished he could forget. </p><p>"Bloody heaven, Tenebris!" </p><p>Said older sister frowned as she wrapped a bathrobe around her and looked at him," What happened to calling beforehand?" </p><p>"Considering the Winchester's have been calling you for nearly a day now?" He asked. She frowned as the blond on her bed stirred but stilled. She sighed, waved her hand and the balcony door opened as she told him," They have? Now, that can't be right... ground floor Crowley."</p><p>He followed her as the two folded their wings( not putting them away but just folding them) and walked down the spiral stairs that lead to her kitchen. </p><p>"Might be half a day, they're in town now," He replied. She hummed and said," Where is our brother then?" </p><p>"Which one? because Luci right now is in Las Vagas, I don't..." </p><p>"I am here, Tenes," They heard Gabriel say as they walked into the kitchen. He stood there sucking on a lolly. Tenebris frowned before humming," Hannah and Anna are upstairs, I think Anna is sleeping off having a bit of her grace being returned." </p><p>"Speaking off those two, Cassie and Uriel's showed up at Lux. Fen says their looking for them," Gabriel said. Crowley nodded," That's why I am here, The Winchesters are looking for her as well. Abel was in Lux and told me, Cata, and the Hale's that some demons are looking for her. Fergus was able to conform to that." </p><p>"How is he, Fergus I mean?" Tenebris asked as she poured out a glass of whiskey. Crowley frowned and asked," Isn't it a little early for alcohol?"</p><p>"Says the demon who nearly drunk himself to discorporation when he delivered Adam to the Nuns," She replied before stating," Besides it's nearly ten, and it's for Nixi, not myself."</p><p>"I forget you only drink fire whiskey and rum," Gabriel said. She hummed," And wine on occasion. As well as vodka." </p><p>Crowley frowned before asking," Right then. Fergus is well. Finally started a relationship with Bobby."</p><p>"Oh, what a coincidence. Now, Crowley if you could get in to contact with the Winchesters. Gabriel, Anna and Hannah are upstairs. Hannah should be awake now, I suggest telling her of Uriel and Castiel," Tenebris suggested as she walked back up to the third floor with the whiskey. Crowley frowned but looked to Gabriel who sighed," She may be younger than me, but sometimes I wonder if she really is you know?"</p><p>" I think being a goddess has made her more confident," Crowley added. Gabriel shook his head," I don't know. I think it's a recent change, myself."</p><p>Crowley nodded and said," Well I am going to pop down to Standford and take the floo over to Hogwarts for a few days after I call up the Winchesters. Azira said something about Newt and Credence wanting to have tea." </p><p>"Hurry off then, Tell Moine I said hello for me?" </p><p>"She misses you, Gabriel... I suspect you should pop over some time as well," Crowley suggested. He nodded," I think I will, you know before things get too much." </p><p>He nodded and headed out then took off to the skies.</p><hr/><p>
  <strong> A Few Hours later; Bunker Hill Tower </strong>
</p><p>Abel had followed the Hale pack to Bunker Hill Tower as he was pretty buzzed and also had a few questions( he surprising got along with Laura and Derek). So that was where he was when his phone when off an hour after he left. He fumbled with it before he was able to answer it. </p><p>"Hollo?" he drawled. On the other end, he heard Sam's voice," Are you drunk?"</p><p>"Correct term is buzzed, and you should see the other guy," He chuckled then explained," N' ver knew that werewolves were immune to alcohol."</p><p>"We aren't we just have a high tolerance for it as well as high metabolize. Takes a good amount to put us under," Cata explained before taking the phone from the drunk Pre-med. She smiled and greeted Sam," Heya Sammy?"</p><p>"Cata... you're doing better then?" Sam asked. She hummed," Yeah, I suspected so. Guess having my pack around douse that... that and Crowley is a better nurse than even Laura is most of the time." </p><p>Laura huffed at that but Derek had laughed. Cata smiled before asking," So why the call?" </p><p>"Crowley stopped by. Told us to head to a 50735 Grace Street. You know where that is?"</p><p>Cata hummed," What hotel you three staying at?" </p><p>"The Super eight downtown," He replied. She hummed again thoughtfully before saying," I'll drive you three there in the morning. I don't spect Sphinx will be up now anyways since that's her place. Speaking of her, you heard from Jo and Jess any?"</p><p>"Yeah, last I heard they had just moved into an apartment somewhere near the new church here in LA," Sam replied. Cata hummed," Yeah. sounds about right. Call ya in the morning, I'll bring you, little bro." </p><p>Sam thanked her and ended the call. Cata tossed the cell to Abel and said," Get some sleep kid. Laura, Derek, I'm going to be busy tomorrow, So?"</p><p>"I am going to go and look around for more information on the fire, the proof you know?" Laura said before yawning then she turned to Derek," I need you to stay here." </p><p>"Why?" </p><p>"Because the argents are still hunting us, Der. Victoria and Chris, they are in Seattle. Only reason they haven't came down here is because of Bobby and the Winchester," Cata answered as she paced back and forth in front of her balcony. She frowned before looking at the pack bonds then whispered," Peter..." </p><p>"What?" Laura asked. Cata shook her head," Nothing... lest not yet." </p><p>She nodded as she headed towards the guest room.</p><hr/><p>
  <strong> That Morring </strong>
</p><p>Abel woke up with a pounding headache, a hangover, and the smell of bacon and coffee. He groaned as he turned over only to fall face-first on a carpeted floor. He hears a deep chuckle and glanced up to see Cata in her kitchen and Derek sitting at the dining bar. He frowned as he went to sit up and groaned again when he got a dizzy spell. Cata smiled at him and said," You alright Abel?"</p><p>"ugh, how much did I drink?" He asked. Derek looked at him then said," I think you drank Jörmungandr under the table, which is a feat that isn't recommended if you're fully human."</p><p>"Is that why I feel like shit?" He asked as he fumbled to the bar. Cata hummed as she put down a plate of bacon and breakfast sausages then slid a glass of some that looked eerily like motor oil and smelled like metal. </p><p>He frowned as she explained," Homebrewed hangover solution. One glass of that then drink some coffee."</p><p>"What's in it?" Abel asked. She hummed," leftover bacon and sausage grease, egg, children's ibuprofen, and a little bit of a hangover elixir I got from a professor in England. Tastes like shite, but works wonders." </p><p>Abel nodded and downed the glass before digging into the bacon and sausage plate. </p><hr/><p>By the time he had finshed it was nearing noon and he still hadn't seen Laura. He watched as Cata grabed her purse and keys befor asking," Were's Laura?" </p><p>"She left at 8, headed towards Beacon Hills. Come on I told Sam I'd take you three to Sphinx's," she then turned to Derek and asked," Derek you coming?" </p><p>He looked at her then nodded," might as well." </p><p>She nodded back and the three of them head down to the parking lot and to her 1967 Toyota 2000GT.</p><p>The drove over to the super eight that he and his brothers were staying at and picked up Sam and Dean. Dean looked at Derek and asked," Who are you?"</p><p>"Dean, play nice. Sam, Dean, this a member of my pack, Derek Hale," Cata replied as she started up the car and drove north. She flicked on the radio and slipped in a CD from the armrest and smiled as She Wolf by Shakira started to play. Derek chuckled a little as did Sam but Cata just smiled as she continued to drive. </p><hr/><p>
  <strong>  50735 Grace Street; Sometime Yesterday </strong>
</p><p>Tenebris hummed as she, Nixi, Anna, Hannah and Gabriel sat in her living room. Gabriel was explaining everything to Anna and Hannah while she and Nixi were splayed across the loveseat watching a movie. She hummed again as Nixi thread her hand through her hair when her cell rang. Frowning she pulled it from her trouser's pocket and answered it.</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>"Sphinx..." Cata replied. Tenebris hummed," Cata... Are you calling about the Winchesters then?"</p><p>"Yep, I am going to drive them over. You don't mind if Derek comes with?" She asked. Tenebris sat up and head over to the kitchen( being followed by Nixi) and answered," Not at all, will Laura be with you?" </p><p>"No... She's heading back to the Hills, searching for more information and evidence, for the fire you know?" the she-wolf replied. Tenebris nodded before asking," What time?"</p><p>"Possibly near 1:30 or 2 in the afternoon. Abel had a little too much to drink last night, might take a while for him to be functional you know?" She replied. </p><p>"Oh? I bet. I'll see you all tomorrow then." </p><hr/><p>
  <strong> Present </strong>
</p><p>Sphinx frowned as she watched Cata's 2000GT pull into the driveway next to her spider. She looked to her brother as the Winchester's and two of the Hale pack got out of the GT. He nodded to her as he sucked on lollypop again. Hannah and Anna had been told of their aliases and were sitting at the circular table in the kitchen eating lunch( in Anna's case) and talking about what they were going to do next( in Hannah's case) and Nixi had( begrudely) left to help Jo, Jess and Zach with the Church. </p><p>The doorbell rang and she nodded to Loki as she opened the door. Cata, Derek Hale, Abel, Sam and Dean Winchester stood outside. She welcomed them inside and smiled softly at them as she greeted them," Sam, Dean, Abel, meet Hannah Johnson and Anna Milton." </p><p>Anna looked at them and asked," Sam? Not Sam Winchester?"</p><p>Sam looked between the two pagans than to her as he nodded. She turned to Dean and asked him," And you're Dean. The Dean?" </p><p>"Well, yeah. The Dean, I guess," Dean stuttered out. Abel chuckled as she continued," It's really you. Oh, my. The angels talk about you. You were in Hell, but Castiel pulled you out, and some of them think you can help save us," She turned to Sam," and some of them don't like you at all." </p><p>Sam shrugged," Doesn't surprise me honestly." </p><p>She nodded and Hannah shrugged as Dean asked," So, you talk to angels?"</p><p>Hannah shook her head," Not quite. Just sorta overhear them. Probably one of the reasons they're looking for us." </p><p>She took a cigarette from her pocket and flicked it alight and took a drag from it. Sam looked at them and asked," Overhear them?"</p><p>"Yeah, they talk, and sometimes I just... hear them in my head," She replied before elaborating," Not all the time, but a lot. And I can't shut them out, there are so many of them."</p><p>Dean looked at her as Derek spook then and asked," So, they lock you up with a case of the crazies when really you were just... tuning in to angel radio?"</p><p>She hummed around a bit of pancake as Hannah, between another drag of her cigarette, answered," Something like that." </p><p>Loki hummed," It all started the day you got out of hell, Dean-O."</p><p>Sam looked at him questioningly as Dean asked," And you would know how?"</p><p>Sphinx eyed her brother then looked towards the door before cursing in that language older than any other. Hannah, Anna, and Loki all looked at her with questioning gazes as she did so. </p><p>She looked at Dean then Loki and Hannah then said," Ruby, Alastair... must have followed you three. Dame it all to below." </p><p>Loki looked at her before she said," Didn't ward the place against demons of his rank yet, got the higher members. Alright, huddle up boys. Cata, Derek, Hold the fort, lead them off. Keys are on the table. Hannah, still got that cabin and farmhouse?"</p><p>"Yeah... right then..." She put out the cigarette and cranked her neck as two large, white, gouse-like, wings unfolded from her back, as two sets of sandy Black-winged kite wings sprouted from her back. She smiled wryly at the Winchesters and said," Right, Loki tell Nixi and the other's what happened."</p><p>Then before Dean or Sam could blink they were gone.</p><hr/><p>They showed up sometime later in a old farm house in Ohio and when they landed Sphinx ruffled her feathers and frowned," By Ra.. it's been awhile since I travled like that with passangers. Everyone here and put together?"</p><p>Abel groaned as he sat up from the floor and looked to his brother's who had landed on top of each other then laughed before asking," You two alright there?"</p><p>Dean struggled to get out from under his taller little brother as Sam jumped off him before whirling around to the goddess," Wings?"</p><p>"Sphinx... we got incoming," Hannah interrupted the goddess before she could reply. She frowned then tossed the woman a silver dagger of sorts and said," Don't kill them," Before with a ruffle of the wings she was gone. </p><p>Hannah took Anna to the back room just as the door burst open to reveal Castiel and Uriel. Dean frowned and looked at him(Castiel, he was looking at his blue eyes pleadingly{ not that he would ever admit to that}. He completely was trying to ignore Uriel)," Please tell me you're here to help. We've been having demon issues all day." </p><p>"Well, I can see that," Uriel said before sniffing and asking," ou want to explain why you have that stain in the room?"</p><p>"Who? Hannah?" Sam asked looking at the angel. Castiel looked at Dean, and he could see he was struggling with what he was about to say. He glanced at Uriel who glared and he spoke," We're here for Anna."</p><p>"Here for her?" Dean asked then clarified," Like... here for her?"</p><p>"Stop talking. Give her to us," Uriel commanded. Sam glared at him and said," Why, are you going to help her?"</p><p>Castiel didn't look at them as he replied, almost robotically," No, she has to die."</p><p>"Not 'going to happen, Tuesday," Hannah spoke from the doorway her hand bleeding out. Both angels froze but it was Castiel who looked more fearfull then Uriel did. The elder glared at her and said," Out of the way."</p><p>"Give her back her grace and I might," Hannah said smirking. Uriel glared," I'll kill you as well Hanna." </p><p>"You can fucking try, but I am not going to forget her. Not again, not ever," She stated as she slammed her hand on to the wall behind her blasting the two other angels back to heaven. </p><p>Sam looked at her and asked," What was that all about?"</p><p>"Anna. Come on and take a seat, boys. It's a long story to tell," She replied waving into existence a medical wrap and started to wrap up her hand. The three boys followed her into a kitchen about the size of most of their hotel rooms and the hotel bathroom combined where they saw that silver blade dripping in red and Anna was glaring at some sort of ruins drawn in blood on the wall. Sam took one look at them and gasped out," That's enochian." </p><p>Hannah nodded and hummed," Most humans couldn't tell that just from looking at them. I am sure Loki has something to do with that bit." </p><p>She kissed Anna's forehead before whispering something in her ear Anna nodded and asked," Will they be back? And Sphinx?" </p><p>"She'll try... I am sure... as for Castiel and Uriel, Most likely," She replied before turning to the boys and asked," What do you want to know?"</p><p>"What's going on?" Dean asked. Anna responded," What do you mean?"</p><p>"Okay, I know your wiretapping the angel or whatever, but it's no reason to gank her. And that was what they were here to do right," Abel asked. Anna and Hannah nodded before Sam asked," He called you Hanna..."</p><p>"That was my name, Before," Hannah replied. Sam could practically hear the capital letter B in the word. The same way he heard it when Crowley or Aziraphale talked about that word. It wasn't just before something, it was a time period itself and that was intriguing within its self. Dean, however, didn't catch on to it as he asked," Before what?"</p><p>Both women hummed as Anna replied," just Before... well, everything I guess. It's been a while before I have even thought about it... 19 years in fact. I am far from innocent in the eyes of heaven and the angels." </p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Dean asked. She hummed," I am an angel, so is Hannah." </p><p>Sam choked as he asked," wha... I d... I don't understand..."</p><p>"You okay there Sammy," Dean asked. He nodded as he caught his breath then asked," Why do you feel more like Loki and Sphinx then?" </p><p>Hannah hummed," Think deeper Samual. Who else feels like us?" </p><p>Sam thought back to his meetings of other supernatural and came up with only two others and paled even more," Crowley and Aziraphale." </p><p>"Give the boy a prize. I haven't been in heaven in 22 years, and Anna. Well, she's missing more than half her grace."</p><p>"Just enough to gain back my memory without repercussions but not enough to regenerate the rest of the fun stuff," Anna said wistfully as she looked out to the barn. Dean looked at her and asked," What exactly happened?"</p><p>"I disobeyed... which, for us, is about the worst thing you can do. I fell to earth, became human," She replied still staring out the window. Abel frowned and asked," Wait a minute. I don't understand. So, angels can just become human?" </p><p>Hannah shook her head," Not quite, it kind of hurts. Try cutting your kidney out with a butter knife. That kind of hurt. She had to rip out her own grace. We were lucky we had outside help to make sure that she didn't kill herself and to make sure I would be there for her." </p><p>Dean looked at her," Come again?"</p><p>"Grace it's energy. Hacked it out and fell," Anna replied before glancing at a photo on the wall that had her human parents, Hannah's human family, and her self. A sad smile played across her face as she explained," My mother, Amy, couldn't get pregnant. Always called me her little miracle. She had no idea how right she was."</p><p>Abel looked at the picture and nodded as Dean asked," So, you just forgot that you were God's little Power Ranger?"</p><p>Hannah had to laugh at the phase but Anna hummed in response," The older I got, the longer I was human, yeah."</p><p>Sam looked at them as Hannah said," I don't think you all appreciate how completely screwed we are." </p><p>"Hannah's right, Heaven wants both of us dead, by now," Anna agreed. Sam hummed," and acording to Crowley and Fergus, Hell just wants her. A flesh-and-blood angel that you can question, torture, that bleeds."</p><p>Hannah hissed," And sooner or later, Heaven or Hell, they're gonna find us. This isn't a very good hiding spot," She took off the wrap and her hand was healed. Then she turned to the Winchester and said," And that's why we have to get it back from Uriel." </p><p>"Why douse he have it?" Abel asked. She hissed," He stole it from the tree." </p><p>"What tree?" Dean asked before truning to Anna and asking," Another question. Why would you fall? Why would you want to be one of us?" </p><p>Anna looked at him and asked," You don't mean that. Really."</p><p>Dean raised an eyebrow and asked," I don't? A bunch of miserable bastards... Eating, crapping, confused, afraid."</p><p>"I don't know. There's loyalty... forgiveness... love," Anna said. Hannah hummed, as she handed both Abel, Sam, Anna and Dean coffee," Chocolate cake."</p><p>"Pain and Guilt," Dean added. Anna countered him," Sex."</p><p>Sam and Abel sputtedered as Hannah laughed," Best part I think." </p><p>"Yeah, you got me there," Dean laughed a little as he took a sip of his coffee. Anna looked at him then stood up," I mean it. Every emotion, Dean, even the bad ones. More like the before that way. Before Lucifer was cast out, before the Fall. It's why I fell. It's why... why I'd give anything not to have to go back. Anything." </p><p>Hannah nodded," They brainwash angels up there. Think the only one that hasn't been brainwashed in the same way we have, was Aziraphale." </p><p>She looked out the window as Dean mumbled," Feelings are overrated if you ask me."</p><p>"Sure, yeah and being brainwashed into forgetting the very being that you were meant to find and love," A British voice spoke from behind. Dean whirled around to find Aziraphale and Crowley. Sam looked at them before Hannah asked," Aziraphale... Zal... Crowley?"</p><p>"Oh Hannah dear, I wish you had told us sooner that you were here. To think that Castiel is chasing you two for this," Aziraphale stated as he fretted about the two. Crowley hissed( quite literally) and asked," Uriel'sss been here?" </p><p>"About half an hour ago, it is good to see you again, Crowley," Anna hummed. Dean looked at the demon and asked," What do you know about it?"</p><p>"I use to be an angel, Dean. The last to 'Fall' really," He said this as he swaggered over to Aziraphale and Dean noticed that each had a golden ring around their fingers. He blinked before he noticed something else. </p><p>"You're married?" He asked. Sam rolled his eyes," Of course they are, Dean." </p><p>"Angle," Crowley hissed softly. The blond looked at him and said," Patient, Crowley dearest... and the correct term is bond actually." </p><p>Hannah dropped her mug and looked at him," H...Ho...How?"</p><p>"Well, the second oldest... oh, best not say anything more just yet. Now, where is the rest of your grace, Anna?" Aziraphale asked. Hannah whisked her hand to repair the mug and said," Uriel stole it from oak in Union, Kentucky."</p><p>Abel looked at them and stated," In In '85, there was an empty field outside of town. Six months later, there was a full-grown oak. They say it looked a century old at least." </p><p>"That would be it...." Anna started before she went pale. Crowley looked at her then bent down next to her chair on his knees and asked," Anna, can you tell me what you hear? It's alright if you can't, but if you do we'll be able to help, yeah?"</p><p>She nodded slowly as Hannah rubbed her hand and she slowly spoke up," t's weird... Like a recording... a loop."</p><p>"What's the loop saying, dear?" Aziraphale asked as he knelt down. Abel looked to his brothers and started to usher them out of the room when she replied," Dean Winchester gives us Anna by midnight, or..."</p><p>She glanced around the whispered so low that the humans in the room barely heard," ...or we hurl him back to damnation." </p><p> </p>
