    <p>“How did I decide to do this?” Rumplestiltskin asked.</p><p>“You made a promise, sir,” Dove said, brushing dust off the Dark One’s leather jacket.</p><p>“That’s not a good enough reason.”</p><p>“If you say so, sir.” Dove managed to get the white rose in Rumplestiltskin’s buttonhole, an accomplishment given how many spikes this jacket had.  Rumplestiltskin might have to keep his scales hidden away for this ceremony, but that didn’t mean he had to bury his fashion sense. “You can always call it off.” Dove’s voice was completely bland. “All you have to do is tell Miss Belle.” He brushed away some more dust. “Let her know you’re jilting her.” He tidied Rumplestiltskin’s cravat. “On her wedding day.”</p><p>“Have you ever thought about being a snail?” Rumplestiltskin said.</p><p>“No, sir, not often.  Now, do you remember what they said about the ceremony?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, the cleric—”</p><p>“Priest, sir. I believe the correct form of address is ‘Reverend,’ by the way.”</p><p>“Whatever. He tells us the vows. I say ‘I do’ when he stops talking. Then, he looks at Belle, and she says “I do’ when he’s done saying whatever it is he has to say.  I give Belle a ring—You have the ring, don’t you?”</p><p>“Right here, sir.” He pulled out the diamond studded ring Rumplestiltskin had given him.</p><p>Rumplestiltskin frowned.  “I don’t know.  Those stones are rather small, don’t you think?”</p><p>“The main stone is half and inch, sir.”</p><p>“Yes, small.  You know, I heard they have some decent size ones in that place, what’s it called? The one all the tourists were going to.”</p><p>“You mean the Tower of London, sir?”</p><p>“Yes, that was it.  I heard there were some fair sized ones there.”</p><p>“Those would be the crown jewels, sir.”</p><p>“There was one, nothing too pretentious, it was about the size of a small plum.  No one would miss it.”</p><p>“I believe you mean the Cullinan diamond, sir.  They keep it in the royal scepter.  I don’t imagine they would just let it go.”</p><p>“I could make a deal for it.”</p><p>“Not in the next five minutes, sir.  And Miss Belle has delicate hands, don’t you think?  A diamond that big might be a little awkward on her ring finger.”</p><p>“Hmph, I suppose.  I can get something bigger later.”</p><p>Just then the cleric—or priest or reverend or whatever he was—came in, looking cheerful.</p><p>“All ready?  There are just a few things to go over—Oh!  Nice coat!  Are you a science fiction fan?  I think I saw something like that on <em>Doctor Who</em>.  Or was it <em>Blake’s 7</em>?  Not one of those American shows.  They put everyone in polyester.  A sad lack of leather, that’s what I say.”</p><p>“Can we just get this over with?” Rumplestiltskin said.</p><p>“Oh, yes, of course.  Now, about the wedding vows.  You said you just wanted whatever was traditional?  I have the old form here, if you want to go over it.”</p><p>“I thought it was just ‘I do,’” Rumplestiltskin said, taking the paper from the whatever-he-was and scanning it quickly. </p><p>“’I do’ is the simple version of the new form.  Of course, most people prefer the new form or making up their own vows.  I’m never sure how I feel about that. Most of them aren’t as good at it as they think they are. . . .”</p><p>Rumplestiltskin snorted.  “Amateurs always mess up verbal contracts.  Especially when they’re trying to be romantic—Ack!  What does this thing<em> say</em>?”</p><p>“To love and to cherish?”</p><p>“After that! It says—it says—” He choked, unable to get it out.</p><p>Mr. Dove looked over his shoulder.  “Oh,” he said.  “Yes.  You mean the part after ‘With this Ring I thee wed,’ where you’re supposed to say, ‘with my Body I thee worship,’ sir?”</p><p>“Ack!  How can you—how do I—What kind of wedding do you think this is, anyway?”</p><p>“Er,” the priest looked a bit uncomfortable.  “If no one’s explained—you see, married couples do—it is quite acceptable—uhm, you see, there are birds and bees and—”</p><p>“I KNOW ABOUT THE BIRDS AND THE BEES!” Rumple said.  “There will be small children present at this ceremony!  You expect me to say—to say—” He waved the paper around. “—<em>that </em>in front of a <em>baby</em>.”</p><p>Mr. Dove was studying a far corner of the ceiling, possibly trying to determine if it was going to stay up with all the hysterics going on under it.  “I don’t think he speaks yet, sir.”</p><p>“He’ll be scarred for life!  <em>I’ll </em>be scarred for life!”</p><p>“Well, it is the <em>traditional </em>form,” the cleric-priest-reverend said.  He sighed.  “It’s fallen out of favor, but it really does have a poetic element the modern ones seem to lack.”</p><p>“No poetry!” Rumplestiltskin said.  “Plain text!  You ask if I take Belle for my wife, I say I do.  You ask her if she wants, er, well, accepts me for her husband, she says I do.  Leave bodies out of it!  Bodies are none of your business!”</p><p> “Fine, fine,” the man said.  “The boring form.”  As he led them off to the small chapel, Rumple could have sworn he heard the priest snicker. Under his breath, the man murmured, “Man, I love this job. . . .”</p>
