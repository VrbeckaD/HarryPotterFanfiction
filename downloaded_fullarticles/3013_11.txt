Aren’t you still angry with me?”</p><p>She sighed, hands folded in front of her. “I was never angry, Harry. I was just confused.”</p><p>“Could have fooled me.” He recalled their heated argument before Christmas break. <em> If you’re going to hang around that slimy git, I’m not sure I want to talk to you! </em></p><p>“It was hard for me to understand.”</p><p>Harry was tired of explaining. “He’s changed, Gin. The war affected all of us, and… I don’t know. He gets it. I’m not saying you don’t,” he added hurriedly, “it’s just… it’s different with Draco.”</p><p>There was a knowing gleam in her eyes. “You like him as more than a friend, don’t you?”</p><p>Harry sputtered. “It that what this is? You’re jealous?”</p><p>“You didn’t deny it.” Ginny couldn’t resist a smug grin. “No, I’m not jealous. And I don’t want to lose your friendship.”</p><p>Harry reached out for her hand. “Never.”</p><p>Ginny smiled, then stuck out her tongue. “Does this mean I have to be nice to him when we get back to school?”</p></div>
