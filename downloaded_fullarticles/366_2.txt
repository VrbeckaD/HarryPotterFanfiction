    <p>"Wait, quest?"</p>
<p>The centaur nodded to the boy. "More like investigation. There are far too many attacks to ignore." Nico gulped. Though on the outside, he looked calm and indifferent, on the inside he was having an intense mental battle. The son of Hades had been enjoying the time off with his wonderful boyfriend, Will Solace. However, Nico was bound by a sense of duty to help the camp. <i>Plus.</i> He reasoned with himself. <i>Increased monster attacks are interesting. That means an increase of magic in an area.</i> He gave in with a sigh.</p>
<p>"When do I go," Nico said. Chiron handed him a stick. Nico did sense some kind of magic from it, though a different breed from his own.</p>
<p>"You are going undercover at a school where the attacks seem to be surrounding. Something you need to understand is... it's a school of magic folk." The camp counsellor said with complete seriousness. Nico laughed. <i>Magic?</i> Godly magic, but not mortal magic (he gathered by context clues that it was a mortal school).</p>
<p>"You're joking. Hecate hasn't been making pet worlds lately, or within the past 100 years." Nico deadpanned. Chiron shook his head.</p>
<p>"This one was made roughly 2500 years ago. It's evolved, but it's still a magic world. We don't usually do contact them, well, except for now." Nico was about to interrupt when Chiron plowed on. "The school term starts in September, so you have about a month to get prepared. You are an exchange student from Chiron's Academy of Magic Peoples, Camp for short. You are the son of- please don't scream or curse- Bianca di Angelo, named after your uncle, Nico. It's the only plausible excuse we could come up with for your... unique last name." Chiron finished.</p>
<p>Nico inhaled, and did <i>not</i> curse. <i>Or</i> scream. He held back unshed tears and took a deep breath. <i>Don't think, don't think of her. It's okay... it's okay...</i> "Okay."</p>
<p>Chiron visibly relaxed. "I also have some news you may appreciate." Nico tensed. 'News' wasn't always the best thing, especially if it came out of the centaur's mouth.</p>
<p>"Mr. Solace will be coming along with you."</p>
