    <hr/><p> </p><p>Fire.</p><p> </p><p>Fire, everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>No matter where he looked, fire burned and flickered in a magnificent glow of red, orange and yellow. The heat from the roaring flames was intense, but he didn’t feel it, for some reason. But he didn’t feel safe here. The fires, the smoke, and the screams, it was like a vision into a hellish underworld where sinners were damned for their crimes. Although, to be frank, he never did feel safe here.</p><p> </p><p>Harry James Potter, left on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive as a baby, never had a day where he felt safe. Even at the tender age of five, little Harry knew that he wasn’t in a safe, loving environment where a young child like him ought to have.</p><p> </p><p>He knew his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley didn’t love him. They never did. In their eyes, he was a freak, an abomination, a monster that they had correct out of him. Ever since he could walk, Harry had been forced into what essentially was slavery. Cooking, cleaning, and getting whatever the Dursleys wanted. Any mistake, slip-up, or questions were harshly dealt with. Harry had gone through countless beatings, hits, and long periods thrown into the cupboard under the stairs with just bread and water to survive.</p><p> </p><p>Harry, although understanding this wasn’t how family treated their own (from Dudley’s old children’s books he sneaked from the attic), never once spoke out, for speaking out only resulted in more lashes with a belt and a week in the cupboard. But this time, something happened that put an end to Harry’s suffering.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had spoiled dinner that evening, after Dudley had spooked him, causing him to drop the frying pan and the three steaks that he was cooking for the Dursleys went flying out and landing on the floor, except for one of the steaks, which landed on Dudley’s fat, pudgy arm, the still-sizzling fat burning into his pasty skin.</p><p> </p><p>The obese little monster screamed in pain, rolling to the floor and clutching his arm in pain. A rush of footsteps, Petunia and Vernon bursting into the kitchen in a flurry. Petunia’s eyes widened, seeing her “handsome Dudders” injured and howling in pain, and rushed for him, mothering him with questions and reassurances.</p><p> </p><p>Vernon on the other hand, rounded on Harry, his fat, round face turning purple with rage. Harry knew he was in trouble again, but this time, a surge of energy flashed through his nerves. For the first time, he didn’t feel scared. Heck, he wasn’t even afraid of the pain and the punishment that was coming. Harry knew he wasn’t at fault. It had just been an accident. Dudley got what he deserved, for scaring Harry when he was handling dangerous cooking equipment. Dudley should be blamed, not him.</p><p> </p><p>And he was going to make it clear to Vernon.</p><p> </p><p>“What did you do, boy?!”</p><p> </p><p>“It was Dudley.” Harry began unwaveringly. Normally, he replied in meek tones whenever Vernon or Petunia spoke to him, but not this time. “He scared me, and I jumped. The meat flew out and one of the pieces landed on him.”</p><p> </p><p>“You! You think it’s funny to blame our little tyke for your actions!” Vernon shouted, bringing a large hand down to hit Harry. But the boy dodged.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think it’s funny, because it wasn’t my fault!” Harry shouted back, “It was Dudley who did it!”</p><p> </p><p>“Why you insolent little freak!”</p><p> </p><p>Vernon grabbed Harry’s thin arm harshly. Harry knew his “uncle” was going to throw him into the cupboard again. But not this time.</p><p> </p><p>“IT IS NOT. MY. FAULT!!!” Harry screamed.</p><p> </p><p>Then, things spiralled out of control. There was a loud bang, and a whooshing sound. Vernon pulled away as, to Harry’s astonishment, a large column of fire seemed to burst from the stove and engulfed him with a roar.</p><p> </p><p>Vernon screamed, falling to the floor, flailing and rolling to extinguish the flames dancing across his body. Petunia screeched, grabbed a wet towel from the sink and whacking at the flames that inundated her husband. No matter what she did though, the flames did not go out. Instead, they seem to only get bigger, increasing with Vernon’s screams of agony as his moustache and clothes were burnt away.</p><p> </p><p>Harry watched the scene with astonishment. He was confused. What happened? Did the stove explode? The stove was on fire, Harry noticed, but how did Vernon, who was not even near the stove, catch fire too?</p><p> </p><p>His attention turned to Petunia, who was still trying to save her burning husband. His gaze locked onto her, the skinny, long-necked whore who also abused him alongside her husband. Another bang, another whooshing sound, and another scream, this time more high-pitched, but equally wretched. Harry watched, eyes wide, as Petunia was hit by another column of fire, her hideous flower-print dress and blonde hair igniting amidst her wailing.</p><p> </p><p>She collapsed to the floor, just like her husband, flailing about in a doomed attempt to extinguish the flames eating away at her. Harry turned to Dudley, who was cowering in the corner where he had scuttled back against. He watched his cousin stare at his burning parents, frozen with fear and horror.</p><p> </p><p>Dudley’s fear and horror became just fear, when the flaming stove exploded for real this time, the resulting fireball destroying the fixtures, windows, the dining set, the kitchen electronics, and Dudley himself.</p><p> </p><p>The force of the explosion threw him sideways. His head hit against a drawer handle, leaving him disoriented. The fireball came less than a second later, and he was thrown into the same fate as his parents, his hair and clothes igniting first. Even dazed, his pained screams joined the chaos of noise that the kitchen became.</p><p> </p><p>With everything seemingly ablaze, including his blood relatives, Harry snapped out of his stupor. He couldn’t stay here. He needed to get away, to escape, lest he suffered the same fate as the three burning monsters.</p><p> </p><p>Scrambling to his feet, Harry dashed from the flaming kitchen. His uncle, aunt and cousin stayed on the floor, burning and screaming. Harry reached the doorway, and looked back. He could only see Vernon amidst the flames, Petunia and Dudley blocked from view by the rising smoke that filled the kitchen. Their eyes met, blank emerald-green ones connecting with flaming, blue ones. Harry could see the sheer anger and hatred in those blue eyes, like from the past three years, even as their owner thrashed in pain and panic from being on fire.</p><p> </p><p>But even Vernon was eventually blocked from Harry’s sight, when the ceiling, weakened by the flames, came crashing in. Debris rained down, a large piece of flaming wood landing in front of Vernon’s face, his screams reaching a higher crescendo.</p><p> </p><p>Harry tore away from the door frame as it began to burn. Smoke billowed out from the kitchen and into the hallway. Harry dropped to the floor, coughing and spluttering. Breathing was becoming difficult, as Harry stayed low as possible from the smoke.</p><p> </p><p>With the flames now encroaching into the hallway, Harry crawled with what little strength he had from the meagre piece of toast he managed to secretly eat at breakfast that morning. It seemed like an impossible task, with the smoke and fire cutting off most of the oxygen and weak physical state. Harry could feel the heat of the fire around him, and he pushed himself harder. He didn’t want to die here.</p><p> </p><p>Amidst the thick smoke, Harry finally reached the door after what must seemed like hours of crawling. He could no longer hear the screams from his blood relatives, but he could sounds coming from outside beyond the door. Loud wailing sounds like the sirens of a fire truck, and loud voices muffled by the door.</p><p> </p><p>Hope rose in Harry’s heart. With the flames and smoke getting stronger, he willed up whatever strength he had left, and started slamming his small fist against the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Help! Help me! Get me out!” Harry screamed as loud as he could.</p><p> </p><p>The voices outside reacted in a flurry of incoherent babble. Not long after, Harry heard a woman’s voice come through the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Hang on kiddo! We’re coming! We’re going to bust the door in!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry realized what she said, and scurried back a few paces. Barely a second later, the door came crashing through in a cloud of wood and splinters. Harry shut his eyes and curled inwards to avoid the wooden projectiles, as the voices reached his ears, much clearer. He didn’t register what the voices said, but he heard heavy footsteps rush in.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, he felt a pair of hands grab him, and hoist him off the floor. Harry barely registered being pulled close to a chest, before his rescuer rushed through the remains of the front door.</p><p> </p><p>Immediately, the blazing heat of the fires was replaced by the coolness of the spring night. Harry let out a shaky breath. At last, he could breathe.</p><p> </p><p>He barely registered his surroundings. Everything was out of focus from the tears in his eyes. He saw the colored flashes of the sirens, the blurry forms of neighbors milling outside the garden walls, arms raised, pointing.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shuddered, the adrenaline seeping out of his nerves. He felt heavy, exhausted. He just wanted to close his eyes…</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, kiddo. You’re safe now. You’re going to be alright…”</p><p> </p><p>That was the last thing Harry heard as he slipped into unconsciousness in the fire-fighter’s arms.</p>
