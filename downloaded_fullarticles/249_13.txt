    <p>He laughed hollowly. His worst fears had come to life. Father would be proud. “Are you happy now?” He projected his unspoken question around him, hearing it echo and fade into silence. They weren’t so different he supposed, despite his best efforts to escape his fate, the prophecy. He’d been a fool. No one escapes destiny. However hard one protests or fights them, prophecies happened. There was no fighting them off.</p><p>
  <em>{<u>Dragon:</u> “Demon’s child cold and alone, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Can never escape his blood or bone, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Cursed to watch the ages fly, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He the one who can never die.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Hope is futile, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Magic brutal, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Destiny to meet, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Can be foiled by no feat.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Toil and turn, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Grow and burn, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love and hate, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>His saving grace ever too late.”}</em>
</p><p> </p><p>His voice failed him on the last line, he’d been too late, and the forest had burned.</p><p>The sky was dark purple, thundering and pulsing with energy, filled with black clouds that looked ready to burst and deposit their contents over the stony, desolate mountainsides beneath them; they were barren of all life, as if a hurricane had rampaged through the area earlier. Which wasn’t that far from the truth he supposed, laughing bitterly, after all this storm was real, so no reason the hurricane he had created earlier wasn’t a hurricane either.The lone figure in this devastated landscape stood out against the raging horizon, seemingly unharmed despite how lightning had hit remarkably close to the spot he’d been occupying the last few hours, he knew he wouldn’t have to wait long now though, even human hunters weren’t that incompetent; no one would be able to miss it if they had any senses. His magic wasn’t exactly subtle after all. Soon they’d come for him, he certainly deserved whatever fate he’d be assigned; he may as well get this over with sooner rather than later.</p><p><br/>
In front of him a dark, swirling vortex appeared, unsteadily he silently walked through it, why wait for them to come to him?</p>
