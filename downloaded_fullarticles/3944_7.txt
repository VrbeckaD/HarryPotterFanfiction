Hermione boarded the Hogwarts Express with Ginny to make up her 7th year and complete her NEWTS on Monday, August 31, 1998. The girls waved goodbye to Harry and Ron through the window in their compartment. Hermione was going to miss them dearly, but she was looking forward to being able to fully dedicate herself to her studies. This was her opportunity to just be a student. She wanted to absorb as much as she possibly could.</p><p align="left">“What are you planning to do after Hogwarts, Hermione?” Ginny asked as she flipped through a quidditch magazine. The two girls had become good friends over the last few years. They didn’t spend much time together over the summer, however. Ginny had spent almost her entire summer with her tongue down Harry’s throat. Hermione, on the other hand, had swiftly skirted Ron’s advances week after week.</p><p align="left">Hermione sighed and pulled a book out of her bag. “I haven’t decided yet. I’m hoping to have figured it out before school ends though. What about you?” Hermione asked. she had spent the last year debating whether she wanted to work for the Control of Magical Creatures department in the ministry. It would have been the obvious choice had she not had so much reason to loath the Ministry of Magic. She had a world of possibilities in her hands, and the options were overwhelming.</p><p align="left">Ginny closed the magazine she was holding and gazed out the window once more before responding, “Promise you won’t laugh?”</p><p align="left">“Why would I laugh?” Hermione asked confused.</p><p align="left">“Well, I obviously want to play quidditch professionally, but…I’ve always wanted to be a writer. It’s silly really. Just something I enjoy,” she answered looking slightly embarrassed.</p><p align="left">“Gin, that’s wonderful. Why would you think I would make fun of you for that?” Hermione questioned. “Without writers, what would I do with all of my time?”</p><p align="left">Ginny laughed at her, “Well, it isn’t exactly the aspiration of many witches. Wizards either now that I think of it. I don’t mean being a historian, Hermione. I want to write fiction. My dad has loads of muggle books. Even without magic, I find them captivating.” Ginny blushed and looked away from her.</p><p align="left">Hermione hadn’t thought about it before. She couldn’t recall any Wizarding fiction that wasn’t children’s literature, unless she counted Lockhart’s books, of course. “Ginny, I think it’s wonderful. Just what this world needs. Have you already written anything? Can I read it?” she asked eagerly.</p><p align="left">She looked at Hermione with apprehension. “Well, I didn’t bring anything with me that I’ve written. Maybe I could write something for you. Then you could tell me what you think…if you think I’m wasting my time,” Ginny said sounding a little less embarrassed.</p><p align="left">“I’d love that, Gin,” Hermione smiled brightly at the redhead next to her.</p><p align="left">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxx</p><p align="left">Hermione and Ginny sat down in the Great Hall among the other Gryffindors. The hall was buzzing with chatter and excitement, which was a pleasant surprise considering the end of the last school year. Hermione scanned the staff table and found Headmistress McGonagall speaking with Professor Sprout. Hagrid sat next to Madam Hooch, who was buttering a dinner roll. Professor Snape was scowling at his food as if it had offended him. Meanwhile, Professors Vector and Sinistra seemed in deep conversation beside him.</p><p align="left">It was a miracle Professor Snape survived the war. He would not have deserved that death. The headmistress announced that Professor Snape would resume as Potions Master while the new teacher, a short squat wizard would be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. Hermione rolled over the information in her mind. <em>Headmistress McGonagall would not have refused had Professor Snape asked for the job. Perhaps the rumors of him coveting the position were just that.</em></p><p align="left">“Has it finally happened to <em>the</em> Hermione Granger?” Ginny said elbowing her.</p><p align="left">“What?” Hermione turned to Ginny and picked up her goblet to take a sip of pumpkin juice.</p><p align="left">“You were staring at Snape. No point in denying it,” she replied with a mischievous grin.</p><p align="left">“I was just thinking- wait. What? Denying it? What has finally happened?” she asked the Ginny completely confused.</p><p align="left">“You fancy him,” she flashed Hermione a toothy smile and wiggled her eyebrows.</p><p align="left">Hermione’s eyes went wide and she said, “WHAT?” Noticing she was drawing unwanted attention, she lowered her voice. “Why would you say such a thing? I was only thinking it was lucky he survived. What are you on about?”</p><p align="left">Ginny laughed at her, “Don’t worry. It’s happened to us all at some point. Oh don’t look so scandalized. It’s not a big deal. It’s only natural. He’s the only male teachers under a hundred….and still alive. Honestly, Hermione, if you would put down a book once in a while, you’d know what I’m talking about,” She looked a Hermione who seemed somewhat offended. She continued, “Oh come on, he’s every school girl’s guilty pleasure…and now that his heartbreaking, undying love story has been plastered all over the Prophet, he’s every grown witches too.” Hermione looked completely bewildered, so Ginny went on, “He’s tall, dark, mysterious, and now a bloody war hero. Can you honestly tell me, Hermione, that you haven’t noticed his hands when he is brewing or his scent?”</p><p align="left">“His scent?” Hermione echoed incredulously.</p><p align="left">“Contrary to Ron’s opinion that he never showers, he smells intoxicating. And if you can look past the horrible things that come out of that mouth of his, the way he twists his lips, imagine what else he can do with them,” Ginny said noting Hermione was now blushing. Feeling more like embarrassing Hermione now that enlightening her, Ginny whispered, “just for one minute, imagine what it would be like to get a detention from him. How would you feel bent over his knee while he spanked you? I dare you, Hermione Granger. You are a Gryffindor…are you not?”</p><p align="left"><br/>
Hermione was shocked, appalled, and offended that her Gryffindorness was now in question. “Yes, Gin, I am,” she said through gritted teeth.</p><p align="left">“Prove it!” Ginny goaded her. “Look at him.” Hermione looked up at the surly Potions Master.<em> “Imagine your heart racing as you approach his desk. You say, ‘Professor, I’m here for my detention.</em>’ Don’t look away. <em>He motions with his hand for you to come around his desk, which you do. You’re nervous. What is he going to do? He grabs you by the wrist and pulls you down across his lap.</em> Keep looking at him, Gryffindor!<em> You struggle to get up, but he lifts his leg over the backs of your knees trapping you. He places his hand on your back, so you can’t move. You are terrified and exhilarated,</em>” Ginny noticed Snape look in their direction. They were both looking at him intently. “Don’t you dare look away, Hermione. What kind of Gryffindor would you be? Where was I? Oh yes! <em>Your heart is pounding</em>,” Ginny slapped her hand down hard on the table causing Hermione and a few others around her to jump. Ginny continued whispering in her ear, “<em>The first slap on your bum startles you.</em>” Ginny slapped the table again, <em>“another slap on your ass. It hurts, but you want more. By the third one you can feel him hard against your abdomen, and you’re wet.</em>” Ginny smiled devilishly at the Professor who was still glaring at them. “You do realize he could be looking into your mind right now, don’t you?”</p><p align="left">Hermione shot up from the table knocking over her glass of pumpkin juice. She was red with embarrassment and somewhat breathless. She quickly turned and walked out of the Great Hall without a word to Ginny.</p><p align="left">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p align="left">Ginny invited Hermione to help her get settled in the head girl dorm. To Hermione’s relief, they were able to finish sprucing up the place without Ginny mentioning Professor Snape, spankings, or erections. Hermione was disappointed that she wasn’t off the hook as far as that subject was concerned.</p><p align="left">Ginny said, “You just need a little sexual awakening, Hermione. Not that I blame you of course. My brother doesn’t exactly seem the type to inspire lust.”</p><p align="left">Hermione giggled and slapped at her playfully. Perhaps Ginny was right. Maybe she really did need some sort of awakening, not that she would ever admit it. After her heat-of-the-moment kiss in the Chamber of Secrets with Ron, Hermione couldn’t help but remember him abandoning her and Harry in the woods. Horcrux or not, he left her. She deserved better than someone who would be so careless with her feelings regardless of their own insecurities. “Gin,” she took a brief pause to pluck up her courage, “I’m not a virgin.”</p><p align="left">Ginny eyes went wide, “When? Why didn’t you tell me? Oh gods, it wasn’t my brother, was it?”</p><p align="left">“NO!” Hermione said waving off the other girl’s disgust. “Ron and I kissed, but afterwards, all I could think of was how he had left us. And Ronald being who he is, pretended like it never happened. I was feeling hurt and really confused.” Ginny was hanging on every word as if it were some kind of fairy tale. Hermione tried to ignore her and continued, “The day I left to go find my parents, I stopped to see Victor.”</p><p align="left">“KRUM?” Ginny squealed. “Oh my god! How was it? I mean, he is so sexy!” The redhead made an exaggerated show of fanning herself.</p><p align="left">“It wasn’t quite what I had expected to be honest. I think that’s why I went to him. He seemed to be everything Ron wasn’t. But it was…clumsy and sweaty,” Hermione explained much to Ginny’s disappointment. “I don’t think I was even…aroused. It was more like a task I was completing.”</p><p align="left">“So…you didn’t enjoy it?” Ginny seemed completely baffled. </p><p align="left">Hermione shook her head, “But at least it was over pretty quickly.”</p><p align="left">“Wow,” said Ginny. “I would have thought a guy like Victor would have stamina.” She giggled.</p><p align="left">“How big was it?” Ginny said clutching her side.</p><p align="left">“Not as big as I thought it would be,” Hermione frowned. “Do Quidditch players use steroids?”</p><p align="left">Ginny looked perplexed. “What are those?”</p><p align="left">Hermione burst out in uncontrollable laughter. </p>
