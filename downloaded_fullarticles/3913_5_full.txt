    <p>There were too many sounds. That was the problem: too many sounds, too much happening. Breaths rattled in and out of lungs that felt too small to contain air that was too hot in a place that was too—</p>
<p><em>Now, now, Mr. Director, none of that,</em> Grindelwald said from close by. Too close; Graves felt him exhale as he spoke, a cloud of moist air that settled over his face like a smothering mask. The rasp of his own breathing grew louder in his ears as the air grew staler; how much was left? How much could be left?</p>
<p>"Graves?"</p>
<p>A counterpoint to his trapped-rat worrying: that sound. That rasping. It was too loud to be coming from him alone. Bouncing around him in the dark, it was too regular to be human. A long low note that finished keen and high.</p>
<p>"Graves."</p>
<p>Where was it coming from? Even if he'd been able to move, to turn his head or roll his eyes, it would've made no difference: there was nothing to see. Nothing he <em>could</em> see. No runes to decipher, weaknesses in his surroundings to examine or exploit. Just the dark, total and unchanging, and his limbs stiff with magic, and his heart racing like a whipped horse on its last legs.</p>
<p>"Director Graves."</p>
<p>Fresh sweat beaded all over his body at the sound, chilling his bare skin despite the crowded heat. Like Grindelwald, the sound had drawn closer; there was a sense of movement over his legs, an unnatural disturbance in the air, and the urge to move, to fold himself up like a pillbug, was overwhelming. And impossible.</p>
<p>The rasping stopped.</p>
<p><em>No,</em> I <em>never start at the bottom,</em> Grindelwald said, smile audible. A smile meant for society functions, for correcting mistaken assumptions with a cool politeness. Graves had practiced that smile in the mirror for hours before his first MACUSA party, when people were still misled by his chubby-cheeked youthfulness, but Grindelwald—</p>
<p>His hands curled into fists.</p>
<p>
  <em>Turn him over.</em>
</p>
<p>Grindelwald made it look—</p>
<p>
  <em>Firm grip—</em>
</p>
<p>"Percival!"</p>
<p>He inhaled sharply, deeply, and held it as the dream—memory?—popped like a soap bubble, leaving behind little more than a sticky film of discomfort across his mind. The rasp ceased; he'd been unconsciously scratching at the lacquered surface of the table. Everyone was staring at him, but that was nothing new.</p>
<p><em>Nothing unusual, nothing to be concerned about,</em> he reminded himself. They'd been staring constantly, more or less obviously, since his first day back to work. Two weeks later, he should've been used to it, but he wasn't. And now he'd given them reason to stare. Again.</p>
<p>Rather than focus on that, he ducked his head and fought to get a grip, control his breathing, focus on how it had been a Wednesday. He'd discharged himself from the hospital on a Monday, and been back at work by Wednesday. He remembered that.</p>
<p>They were still staring at him, and he was staring at the great MACUSA seal on the table as his breathing slowed, and since nobody was saying anything at all he knew he was the one who was supposed to speak. The papers were before him—that was his signature; those were his notes, but they were all so... unfamiliar. Was that really his handwriting? It looked like something Grindelwald could've scribbled in his place. Had he brought the wrong notes?</p>
<p>"Graves?" Picquery prompted, which was more generous than he would've expected of her, but instead of responding the way he ought to—nonchalantly assertive, as if he hadn't been somewhere else completely—he licked his lip instead, scars pulling with the small movement.</p>
<p>He showed weakness where none would be tolerated.</p>
<p>
  <em>What's my line?</em>
</p>
<p>A mistake.</p>
<p>She raised a hand, eyes locked on his. "Give us the room, please."</p>
<p>The sound of two dozen chairs scraping noisily across the floor made a muscle near his eye jump but he remained otherwise unmoved as the rest of the president's cabinet took their time clearing out. Doubtless wondering how much longer Picquery would put up with him.</p>
<p>
  <em>This is the third time today.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He hasn't been the same since... Well, you know.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Look at him, you can tell—</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Should've just let him go.</em>
</p>
<p>"You look like hell," she said when the double doors to the conference room closed at last, shutting out the whispers and the sly glances. There was a shimmer in his peripheral vision, a tingle of static across his skin as she cast an anti-eavesdropping charm. "When's the last time you got any sleep?"</p>
<p>"Last night." It wasn't a lie. They'd had an agreement, before, about what sort of lies he would tell her and what sort he wouldn't. Plausible deniability was important in the upper ranks of government. He'd had a clearer view of the limits of that agreement before December, but he was fairly certain the agreement had excluded his personal difficulties.</p>
<p>Not any more, apparently.</p>
<p>She leaned forward, hands clasped loosely atop the brief they'd been reviewing. The one he'd been supposed to make recommendations about—he remembered now. That was his handwriting after all. What he didn't remember was it being such an untidy scrawl. His mother would be appalled.</p>
<p>"When's the last time you got any <em>rest</em>?" she asked with a tilt of her head.</p>
<p>It would give him away to do it, but he couldn't stand looking at her any longer. That practiced concern. He dropped his gaze first, briefly rubbing a hand over his mouth before he spoke. "If you want a list of candidates to replace me—"</p>
<p>"I don't need one, and that's not what I asked." It would've been better if she'd snapped it instead of sounding so suddenly exhausted as she continued, "Really, if I wanted names from you it would be because I'm firing you, and we both know those names wouldn't belong to potential replacements. Besides, if I did that now it wouldn't play well in the papers." Her smile was a shared secret, wry and just as planned as her concern had been, but it used to work on him.</p>
<p>"More time off." The words were flat in his mouth, tasteless as clean parchment even as his heart began to pick up speed at the thought. His apartment was more spacious but far emptier than MACUSA headquarters, stuffed to the gills as it was with honeycomb offices and worker bees and all their manufactured distractions.</p>
<p>"You didn't take any in the first place," she said, smile briefly twisting into something disapproving. "What did they say at Saint Dymphna's?"</p>
<p>"The same as before." He barely kept the sigh out of his voice as he hunched in his chair and fought the urge to fidget. The healers—three aged witches who'd all taken a turn at poking and prodding and generally irritating him—had squabbled like chickens over a corn niblet. This potion, that spell, <em>No, Fauna, that's for the Addle-Pate curse, silly woman...</em> Endless. Beyond annoying.</p>
<p>
  <em>The mind is a tricky thing. Nothing for it but to hope it fixes itself.</em>
</p>
<p>Utterly unhelpful.</p>
<p>"A pensieve is still out of the question?" And now it seemed it was Picquery's turn to suggest things, as if he hadn't considered something so obvious already.</p>
<p>"A pensieve uses intact memories," he reminded her, straightening the already neat pile of papers before him. "In order to draw anything out I'd need to be able to remember it in the first place or the spell fails. It would be like—"</p>
<p>"Trying to draw a map of a real place you've never been?"</p>
<p>He paused. "Something like that," and in his voice were weeks of wasted effort. Countless hours spent pouring over internal files and field reports, lurid tabloid articles and dull department memos, all in hopes of jogging something loose in his mind about what exactly Grindelwald had done to him. When he'd captured him; how it had been accomplished; if there had been accomplices. A host of unknowns stalked Graves during his waking hours, peeking out at him from behind every suspicious leer or pitying wince he received at work. And then at night...</p>
<p>He hadn't been lying. He slept regularly, but he wasn't getting any rest. He wasn't getting any <em>answers</em>.</p>
<p>"And they've ruled out a memory charm? Never mind." Picquery waved her hand at his sour expression. "I'm just repeating things you've already thought of."</p>
<p>Nodding with his head in his hand was awkward, but he did it anyway, and with little enthusiasm before he closed his eyes. It had crossed his mind more than once that Grindelwald might've cursed him into forgetfulness. To conceal his plot, or the details of how he'd transformed himself so thoroughly. But they—aurors he'd handpicked for the job, the witches at Saint Dymphna's who specialized in the mental arts—had checked him over repeatedly and found no residual sign of Grindelwald's magic on him. The wizard himself was an ocean away, back in Europe and thoroughly beyond his reach.</p>
<p>"He's in Bulgaria somewhere, isn't he? Grindelwald."</p>
<p>"Yes. How long he'll remain there is anyone's guess." Her eye-roll spoke volumes about the low opinion she—and the rest of MACUSA—held for the European insistence on extradition over a far more local execution. "And before you ask, no, I can't get you in to see him. Anyway, he's a prick, you know he wouldn't give you anything useful."</p>
<p>They'd both listened to the interview records—chockablock with Grindelwald's cryptic turns of phrase, smugness dripping from every riddle he lobbed over the table at every interrogator they put in a chair across from him.</p>
<p>Until at last, after three days' worth of airy conversation, he abruptly gave them Graves's location: the westernmost corner of Prospect Park.</p>
<p><em>Grindelwald does nothing spontaneously</em>, he thought, rubbing his scarred upper lip.  The aurors had found him lying on a bench in Bartel-Pritchard Square, unconscious, physically wasted to the point of being nigh unrecognizable, and there had to be a reason for that too. A reason for his being alive, for everything. A feint, a trade—But to whom? For what? Why dump him in Brooklyn? Where had they held him prior? Too many questions. And backtracking Grindelwald's movements using typical magical methods was a fool's errand. In a city as active as New York, any trail he'd left had long since gone cold, especially after three days in government custody. If he'd left a trail to begin with.</p>
<p>"It really is a shame he's such an excellent occlumens," Picquery said, more thoughtful than bitter, and apparently oblivious to Graves's brooding disquiet. "If he weren't, someone skilled enough could probably scoop the answers right out of his head."</p>
<p>His hand dropped away to lie heavily against the parchment, atop the strange shuddering loops of his signature at the bottom of some brief. "Veritaserum wouldn't work on someone like him." Nor on Graves himself. He'd looked into it.</p>
<p>"No, I should think it wouldn't. Not on a mind like his," she said with a respect that wasn't grudging enough by Graves's measure. "Insane, of course, but brilliant. Willful. Besides, they do things differently over there. Durmstrang... You've heard the rumors. Dark arts taught in the classroom, hexes from the cradle. Maybe it's no surprise he turned out the way he did."</p>
<p>"They learn the mental arts as well. Not just occlumency." He'd gone over the reports a hundred times, listened to the records just as many. But something in what she said was like the flare of a latent ember in the cold hearth of his memory. "Scamander mentioned something about it in his interview."</p>
<p>"The redheaded Brit with the suitcase full of property damage?"</p>
<p>He nodded. "He recognized Grindelwald somehow. Said it was the way he zeroed in on his connection to Albus Dumbledore, but..." He shook his head. What had he said? How Grindelwald had looked at him as if he were trying to read his mind.</p>
<p>He'd had a very particular way of looking at a person just before he began to peel their thoughts back. As if he were looking for the ripest orange to take the skin off-</p>
<p>A tremor ripped through Graves, pushed him to his feet in one ungraceful motion, chair barking as it skidded back behind him. "With your permission then, Madam President, I'll take a week off. Just to... sort out some loose ends." The words were like ashes in his mouth, no matter that his mind was humming with something other than anxiety or suspicion. There was something there, he was positive. Something in Scamander's interview, something to do with Grindelwald and the mental arts. He was sure of it.</p>
<p>"Take January to get <em>yourself</em> sorted out." Gone was the concern from earlier, the nearly chummy idle talk of Grindelwald's background. How long had he been standing there thinking?</p>
<p>He bowed his head; a wave of his hand sent his papers slipping neatly into folders and pockets in his black briefcase, joined promptly by the note-taking quill that went to every meeting with him. The only hesitation came from Graves himself, feeling as though there was a touch of finality to the moment, that he ought to say something. But what? Despite his meager efforts, there was no point in pretending he was doing anything other than looking into a very personal issue. Was he supposed to thank her for letting him or apologize for the necessity?</p>
<p>Thankfully she took the matter out of his hands entirely. "Don't worry, Graves," she said, eyes hard. "I'll have Goodspeed fill in for you in the meantime. I'm sure no one will take it amiss if it should slip out that you're further investigating the Grindelwald case. It'll leak to the papers eventually, of course, but so much the better for both of us if it happens on <em>our </em>terms. Starting the new year with a boost in public opinion couldn't go wrong for either of us."</p>
<p>Silence Goodspeed. Not one of the Original Twelve, but her family had made a name for itself nonetheless through sheer blind patriotism. Picquery <em>had</em> said she didn't need a list of replacements from him.</p>
<p>"As you say, ma'am." He managed to keep the bitterness out of his voice.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If Newt Scamander was capable of answering a question point-blank the first time around then Graves had dozed off long enough to miss an example of it.</p>
<p>Stool parked in the center of the doorway so that he had an unobstructed view down the long hallway of the records department, Graves rolled the glass ball between his palms for the third time that afternoon. It contained an audio recording of Scamander's interview as conducted by Cornelia Allegan, an old hand in the Major Investigations Department. Picquery had wanted thoroughness; the goose egg he was holding proved she'd gotten it.</p>
<p>Listening to Scamander detail the precise effects of overseas travel on the storage capabilities of a niffler's pouch led Graves to believe Allegan deserved a raise for her endurance. A commendation at the very least.</p>
<p>He rolled the ball faster, the glass warm against his skin as he sped through what he knew to be a lengthy digression, and wished he'd let his secretary order him one last lunch before she stopped being <em>his</em> secretary. At last he reached Scamander's second arrest and appearance before Congress—his second interaction with Grindelwald. But, save for Grindelwald confiscating his suitcase, they hadn't interacted; Picquery had had more one-on-one contact with him at that point.</p>
<p>What followed was a very meandering account of Scamander's interrogation by Grindelwald, the contents of which Graves had long since fed to his very hungry memory. It might have been his equally hungry stomach that distracted him, or his frustration over Scamander not knowing the meaning of the word "brevity," or plain fatigue. Whatever was to blame, Graves tuned out the majority of Scamander's words until, all of a sudden, his voice seemed to take on a new volume and Graves sat up from his weary slouch, one foot braced against the doorjamb.</p>
<p>"It's very exciting being a wanted criminal, but not the sort of life I ever imagined leading, you know," Scamander said, a burble of laughter in his voice as he continued with affected drollness, "even briefly. So many things to consider! Much like looking after an occamy—you know it's going to be difficult, but you never know exactly <em>how</em> difficult until you're up to your eyeballs in eggs, which is usually about when you start to wish you had some help—"</p>
<p>"And did you? Have some help? Not with the occamy."</p>
<p>"Yes, thank Merlin. Tina's sister, Queenie, lovely witch, was able to give us a hand or else we never would've managed, the place was swarming like—"</p>
<p>"Managed to escape MACUSA headquarters, you mean." Now that she had him back on track, Allegan would not be distracted.</p>
<p>"Yes, precisely that. We all got back into the suitcase—it's rather spacious, you know, which took some doing—and I presume she carried us out the front door."</p>
<p>Graves frowned, ignored his grumbling stomach, and slowly rolled the ball counterclockwise. Not too much, just enough to back up a bit and confirm what he already knew: Grindelwald had taken the suitcase to parts unknown. He let it play, endured the rest of Scamander's rambling interview with a great deal of eye-rolling, until again he reached the point of escape after the confrontation with the aurors, when the suitcase appeared anew. Produced seemingly out of thin air by Tina's sister.</p>
<p>He listened closely to the rest of the interview with fresh ears, hoping for further details about where or how the suitcase re-entered the action, but there was nothing. Taken, and then returned.</p>
<p>Record held loosely in one hand, it ceased to play, though Scamander's words yet echoed in his head. The inconsistency was glaring now that he bothered to take note of anything that wasn't Grindelwald himself. Or Grindelwald <em>as</em> himself.</p>
<p>Figuring out where the suitcase had disappeared to was easy. If Grindelwald had been half as committed to pretending to be him as the <em>Ghost</em>'s scandalized front page alleged, then he'd secured it in Graves's old office. Scamander's suitcase by that point was infamous—no one would've bat an eyelash at the Director of Magical Security taking possession of it.</p>
<p>But that meant Queenie Goldstein had removed it from that same office which Graves himself had taken great pains to ward. And she was not, nor had ever been, an auror. How had she gotten in? Furthermore, how had she known to try for it in the first place? She hadn't been present when Tina and Scamander were arrested.</p>
<p>The straight-forward mystery of it was enough to pique his interest. He stretched, rolled back shoulders that ached from hunching; a flick of his fingers ended the muffling spell he'd cast so that the record's sound wouldn't carry past the booth. The built-in sound-proofing, both natural and magical, wasn't much good if the door was open. He needn't have bothered—he'd been there for a solid hour and hadn't seen another soul besides the taciturn old Records Keeper, Travers, manning the desk and doing the jumbles in that morning's edition of the <em>Ghost</em>.</p>
<p>He'd moved on to the crossword by the time Graves reached him; his pencil kept scribbling as he reached out an eager hand for the dormant record rolling over the desk towards him, the log book sliding forward of its own accord for Graves's signature. "Another one, sir?"</p>
<p>"Same case number. Name of Goldstein, Q."</p>
<p>"<em>Queenie</em> Goldstein?"</p>
<p>Graves's eyebrows rose at the change in tone as he painstakingly signed his name. From practiced disinterest to sharp attentiveness thanks to a single initial. Despite all the records he'd reviewed over the last few weeks, that was the first time Travers had shown any real emotion. He hadn't thought the wizard capable of anything besides general disgruntlement. "Do you know her?"</p>
<p>"I don't—Not <em>personally</em>, no," Travers said, shifting in his seat and flushing. "She brings me coffee sometimes. Does it for most everyone, I suspect, but she always remembers how I like it, and she stays for a chat when that boss of hers doesn't have her running all over the place willy-nilly." Before Graves could seize the opportunity to press the suddenly chatty wizard further, Travers blurted out, "I can't imagine her being involved in any sort of dark magic. She's no sorceress."</p>
<p>"I never said she was."</p>
<p>Another flush warmed bristly cheeks typically the color of old milk, but it was a defensive heat this time, not a boyish fondness. "I know my numbers, Mr. Graves, and I know she had nothin' to do with whatever it is you're digging into."</p>
<p>"She must make an excellent cup of coffee," he said neutrally, which only seemed to further irritate the wizard.</p>
<p>"You knew her, you'd understand."</p>
<p>It was tempting to remind Travers that a moment ago he'd admitted <em>he</em> didn't know her. Graves chose to remind him of his job instead. "The record?"</p>
<p>Travers gave him a miffed look, but his chattiness had clearly worn off; he rose creakily from his chair without another word.</p>
<p>While he waited for Travers to produce the second record, Graves reviewed what he knew about the reportedly friendly Miss Queenie Goldstein. He'd never forgotten that Tina had a sister, but what he knew about her could be counted on one hand with most of the fingers chopped off: younger, also worked for MACUSA. The end. Tina herself had joined the aurors shortly before he'd become head of the east coast; if he were ever going to learn anything about her home life it would've been then, in that brief period of time when he still had the luxury of caring about individual aurors.</p>
<p>He would've needed the willingness as well. Probably why he hadn't learned anything intimate about anyone despite frequent status updates. If it wasn't related to the job, he hadn't wanted to know about it.</p>
<p>With this in mind, he returned to the booth, carrying the second record a good deal more carefully than he had the previous one. Travers had rubbed off on him—he treated them all with as much care as he didn't show visitors to his department, cupping each record in his hand the way one might a friendly sparrow.</p>
<p>Or maybe it was something else that prompted Graves to be more mindful. For the first time in ages he was interested in getting to the heart of a mystery that wasn't—strictly speaking—his own.</p>
<p>Whatever he'd expected of Queenie Goldstein's interview, it wasn't bemusement. Allegan—she'd conducted all the interviews of the major figures involved in uncovering Grindelwald's plot—had reminded Miss Goldstein of the agreement she had with MACUSA: full immunity from prosecution, including one extremely serious Rappaport violation, in exchange for her complete honesty. The same deal had been struck with Scamander, who otherwise would've faced a record-setting number of charges related to the illegal possession and transport of certain prohibited magical creatures.</p>
<p>"Uh huh, I remember," Miss Goldstein chirped. "So what'd you wanna know?"</p>
<p>What followed was... brief.</p>
<p>When asked about her position in the Wand Permit Office, where she'd been stuck for many years, she said, "Um, well, it's a job." He could imagine an indifferent shrug. "I'm not the ladder-climber type like Tina, I just like to get paid and help out when I can. Is that awful of me?"</p>
<p>Instead of using that as a jumping-off point for further probing, Allegan assured Goldstein that that was a perfectly reasonable outlook. Not unusual to find a way to bond with the interview subject, but it still surprised him that she'd let slide such an obvious opportunity for more questions.</p>
<p>The little else there was of the interview proceeded in much the same fashion. On why she helped Scamander, Goldstein would only say, "Tina wanted to, and I wasn't gonna let her go off by herself with an oddball and a No-Maj. How could I? She's the only family I got."</p>
<p>Asked how she got the No-Maj away from a trained obliviator, she simply laughed. "Gosh, I hear a lot of gossip, you know? Just 'cause of my job, I guess, I'm all over the place," she said with a hint of polite embarrassment. "I reminded Sam of one or two delicate items he wouldn't want goin' any further, and he let me take Jacob—I mean the No-Maj, Mr. Kowalski. It was kinda mean of me but it's not like I had a choice, right? And I never would've gone through with it. Spreading it around, I mean. I'm not that sorta witch, ask anyone."</p>
<p>Allegan readily agreed.</p>
<p>The record had barely warmed from his skin by the time Graves had listened to the interview twice in its entirety. Unlike Scamander, Miss Goldstein was not prone to tangents. Besides revealing that she'd learned of the suitcase's location and secured it via the No-Maj—not even Grindelwald had thought to guard against something as simple and nonmagical as brute force—she said very little of substance. In fact, the majority of her answers consisted solely of second- or third-hand information—she overheard a conversation, she was told something in confidence, she noticed someone with someone else.</p>
<p>Rocking back on the stool, head resting against the doorframe, Graves puzzled over what he'd heard, wishing—not for the first time—that there were images to accompany the sound. As it was, he could only conclude a very few things.</p>
<p>First: her pronounced Brooklyn accent—something Tina had clearly taken great pains to lose—masked a keen set of observational skills. There were a number of aurors who could stand to take a lesson from her when it came to gathering ground-level information.</p>
<p>Second: Miss Goldstein, despite appearing frank and unrehearsed, had to be concealing <em>something</em>. Certainly her initial nervousness in the early part of the interview was justified for a witch of little talent swept up in a front-page investigation. It had duly faded as she warmed to Allegan, and Graves wasn't left wondering how Travers came to be so defensive of her.</p>
<p>But the degree to which she was charming did not explain how exactly she knew everything she did, nor why Cornelia Allegan, an auror with decades of experience in interrogation, had failed to follow up on any of the threads her downright facile answers left dangling.</p>
<p>Not least of all: "Who told you Tina was going to be executed?"</p>
<p>"I dunno, I must've just heard someone mention it to someone else," she'd said, voice quavering faintly. "People gab around me all the time 'cause they think I'm just some nobody. Course I <em>am</em> just a coffee witch."</p>
<p>That Allegan had blithely accepted such a preposterously simple explanation was unthinkable, and yet, without pressing for any details at all, she had done exactly that. News traveled fast in MACUSA, but it wasn't instant. Not to mention that Goldstein had been fifty floors away or more when Grindelwald made the snap decision to execute her sister and Scamander mere minutes after interrogating them.</p>
<p>A third listen to the interview only reinforced his belief that she wasn't being completely honest while simultaneously bolstering his respect for her ability to guide a conversation. She was endlessly self-deprecating, but only in a way that reinforced her general unimportance: references to her low station, her lack of skill compared to her sister, her poor memory. For someone who knew a great deal about what was going on, she could never recall who had told her.</p>
<p>Granted, everything she said about herself could be true, but the possibility that her memory might be so terrible as to rival his own wasn't worth entertaining.</p>
<p>And it still didn't explain why Allegan hadn't asked any of the follow-up questions a rookie would've thought obvious. Had there been interference? The record itself ran like silk all the way through, free of any of the flaws that came from tampering; Allegan herself, with decades of practice under her belt, had never once hesitated. There'd been no other recorded voice; no one but them in the room, so far as he could tell.</p>
<p>"Anything else, sir?" Travers said, eyebrows twitching in surprise when Graves held the record out for him to take instead of simply rolling it across the desk as he had the others.</p>
<p>"No. That'll be all."</p>
<p>Enough listening; it was time Graves conducted his own interview. There was no denying that, superficially speaking, the puzzle Queenie Goldstein presented had nothing to do with his problems, but that did nothing to weaken the thrum in his veins that told him there was something about her involvement that was worth looking into.</p>
<p>Maybe he was just desperate, flailing, grabbing on to the first thing that came to hand. Maybe Goldstein really did have a tendency to be in the right place at the right time to hear the right information.</p>
<p>Too many years in law enforcement had left Graves with a hearty distrust of coincidence. Anyway, it was simple enough to figure out: he'd start by asking her how she'd come to learn so many things she had no business knowing. Surely it wouldn't take long to figure out, and then he could return to <em>his</em> business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What do you mean she's not here?"</p>
<p>The wizard presently in charge of the Wand Permit Office, Joseph Abernathy, was having a difficult time not staring at his scars. While his nervous blinking was familiar to Graves, it did not improve his mood. He still hadn't had lunch.</p>
<p>"The thing is, sir, Queenie—Miss Goldstein—she doesn't work here anymore."</p>
<p>For the second time, Graves found himself being forced to zig where he expected to zag when it came to Goldstein. "What department has she been reassigned to? I need to speak with her."</p>
<p>"That's just it." Abernathy licked his lips nervously, eyes flicking down at Graves's empty hands.</p>
<p>No one had ever expected him to pull out his wand and start cursing people left and right at the drop of a hat before Grindelwald's performance in the subway. His irritation only grew when he huffed and Abernathy took a step back.</p>
<p>"She doesn't work at MACUSA at all. Period. She's gone."</p>
<p>"Did she resign or was she let go?"</p>
<p>"Let go? You mean fired?" Abernathy's eyes, if possible, grew wider. "Are you kidding? I'd never fire Queenie! No one would, she's a total bomb—Er."</p>
<p>Judging purely by her voice, he'd been picturing a bubbly young gossip with a matronly slant. Charming, certainly, and harmless enough, but perhaps unremarkable in the looks department. Likewise her talents, if her position were any indication, were middling. Certainly nothing special compared to her older sister.</p>
<p>"She's what?"</p>
<p>Abernathy's reaction, however, meant a slight adjustment of expectations.</p>
<p>"She's a-a heck of a witch," he finished lamely.</p>
<p>"Hm. Then she left of her own accord." He looked the red-faced wizard over with just enough consideration to make him sweat. "Did it have anything to do with your... warm regard?"</p>
<p>"Now wait just a minute, Mr. Graves," he said, raising a hand. "I was never anything but strictly professional with Queenie, unlike some of the other gents around this place. And if she ever had any complaints, I never heard 'em. Except for the ones about the toilets, that is, but I can't do anything about the poltergeist."</p>
<p><em>Toilets?</em> Graves surveyed the gloomy Wand Permit Office and its continually shifting stacks of licenses and applications, tickets and renewal reminders. Leaky pipes, perpetual disorganization, endless rows of desks occupied only by magical stamps that worked unsupervised—nothing had changed from the last time he'd visited some years ago. Tina had been banished down here for a reason.</p>
<p>"What exactly was her job?"</p>
<p>Abernathy made a face as he started ticking things off on his fingers. "Filing, some general paperwork, license processing, bathrooms and offices-"</p>
<p>"Bathrooms?"</p>
<p>"Jinx-removal, mostly," Abernathy said before he coughed. "S-some cleaning. Light cleaning."</p>
<p>"All that <em>and</em> she got to make coffee for people?" No wonder she'd sounded so happy whenever she mentioned serving coffee in other departments. It must've been a treat to get out from under the low ceiling, which seemed to creep lower by the minute. "What about enforcement? You ever let her go out in the field?"</p>
<p>"She wasn't cleared for it, not like her sister was. I asked her once about getting certified, but you know witches," Abernathy said, hands slipping into his trouser pockets as he leaned conspiratorially towards Graves. "Some of them don't have the stomach for that kind of action."</p>
<p>He thought of Miss Goldstein's interview, how casually she'd recounted breaking into his office, and wondered if perhaps she'd been misleading more people than just Allegan for longer than anyone suspected.</p>
<p>"Did you need anything else, Mr. Graves?" Abernathy called to him after he turned on his heel and made his way back to the elevator. The door rattled open, and Abernathy must've taken his pause as consideration of his question, because he pressed further. "Is Queenie in some kinda trouble?"</p>
<p>A house elf sat on a stool waiting for him to enter, and as usual the car wasn't so small as he always imagined. Enough room that he could stand in the middle without touching the elf, and it had grates, not solid doors or walls. More than enough air.</p>
<p>"No," he said, ignoring the second question in favor of pulling out his pocket watch and naming a floor for the elf. The day was getting on without him, but there should be someone left in Administration to pull Goldstein's address. And if not... he still remembered how to use the directory.</p>
<p>He shut his eyes as the elevator swayed, and did his level best to focus on the possibility he might have to dig up Queenie Goldstein's information himself instead of on how narrow the compartment really was. As if he were back in the field and running down a tip, he thought with greater enthusiasm than the idea normally would have merited. Distracting enough he almost didn't notice how close the air became, nor how tightly clenched his fists were.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The clock on the night stand said it was indecently early. While he didn't technically have a job to report to, that didn't stop Graves from making his usual start. By the time he'd shaved, applied the prescribed healing salves, dressed, and had three cups of gut-rotting coffee at the nearest diner, he was ready to face the day. It couldn't be any worse than whatever he'd faced last night.</p>
<p>Resolving to focus on why he was standing across the street from Queenie Goldstein's apartment building, he pushed away the blurred impressions of tight spaces and helplessness that lingered from the night before. The hand he scrubbed over his face was trembling; undoubtedly one cup of coffee too many.</p>
<p>The address Administration had given him was further uptown than he typically traveled, but any change of scenery—anywhere Grindelwald hadn't set foot—was welcome. Unfamiliar No-Maj hustled by on mid-morning business, sparing not a glance for Graves as he'd walked the neighborhood and formulated a plan of attack.</p>
<p>The mean sunlight of a late-December morning threw the ridiculousness of his suspicions into sharp relief. Allegan had conducted a dozen or more interviews by the time she got to Queenie Goldstein—maybe she'd been off her game. It would not be a stretch to say he was as well. There was a reason he wasn't back at MACUSA headquarters attending a regularly-scheduled meeting with the rest of the department heads.</p>
<p>Silence Goodspeed would be doing that. Doing <em>his</em> job. And he was here, pacing like a junior auror sweating over his first warrant. Chasing down… could he even call it a lead? What did he really have on Goldstein? No discernible connection to Grindelwald. A sloppy interview and compliments from a couple of equally low-level employees. The WPO was in no danger of falling apart without her; the performance reviews he'd skimmed were thoroughly middle-of-the-road and held nothing more noteworthy than a request for a Remembrall when she'd first started, which she'd returned by her next review. Tina qualified for the aurors; Queenie's wandwork left her in the literal basement.</p>
<p>Her exit interview had hinted at an awareness of that. Polite but characteristically vague, with no complaints at all, not even about the toilets, Goldstein had referred to a simple desire to move on to something new after a bland expression of gratitude for being allowed to serve her country.</p>
<p>The bottom line was he had nothing. Nothing but his gut, which said over and over that Goldstein was simply <em>too</em> unexceptional for someone who knew <em>far</em> too much. His mind, on the other hand, said—</p>
<p>His mind—</p>
<p><em>You have a remarkably well maintained mind, Mr. Director,</em> Grindelwald purred, grip tight on his chin. <em>Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised, considering the rest of you, but in my experience most Americans are more... haphazard. Casual in their thinking. A product of substandard education, I assume.</em></p>
<p>Graves sucked in a rough lungful of air and pushed his way through the crowd, crossing the street nearly at a run and heedless of traffic or the dirty ankle-deep slush, scarf flapping in the wind. The blaring horns blew away the last tatters of the dream, the phantom fingernails digging into his skin, but the irritated No-Maj shouting at him made his fingers twitch for his wand. He clenched his gloved hands instead and ruthlessly quashed the unfamiliar impulse to hex them.</p>
<p>A pair of strange No-Maj women hurried down the front steps, giving Graves the dubious looks he was used to as they passed by him where he stood at the bottom of the stoop. Neither of them bore any resemblance to Tina Goldstein; her sister had to be inside. Without a job, where else would she be but at home?</p>
<p>He'd apparated cross-town just to talk to her, and now he hesitated? Disgust twisted a stomach already curdled by burnt coffee; he flexed his cramped fingers free of the fist they'd curled into. He would approach her, speak with her, do a better job than Allegan. He would figure out precisely how she'd come to know so much, prove to himself if no one else he was still capable of conducting a thorough investigation, and then—</p>
<p>And then what?</p>
<p>
  <em>I just like to get paid and help out when I can.</em>
</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and dug out his pocket watch. <em>Late for work.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Queenie!" The old No-Maj landlady bellowed up the stairs before giving him another suspicious glower. "You got a visitor!" She didn't move out of the way until there was a clatter of footsteps overhead, and even then he only got as far as a toe over the threshold.</p>
<p>"Coming, Mrs. E," called a familiar voice from floors above. A light patter down a flight of stairs, and down again, and Graves had the sudden realization that he should've pulled her entire file himself instead of relying on others to cherry-pick bits of it for him.</p>
<p>"Oh my." Queenie Goldstein paused on the stairs to look at him, brushing a stray golden curl back out of her eyes. "Mr. Graves."</p>
<p>She was taller than he expected. After so many comparisons to Tina—mostly made by Queenie herself—he'd come to expect someone similar to Tina, but also lesser. Dark-haired, then, but mousy. Perhaps frumpier to match her drab duties. A young witch who lived in her sister's shadow both figuratively and literally, and had reason to be used to it.</p>
<p>Despite adjusting for Abernathy's reaction, he'd still been far off the mark. She wasn't even a brunette. In fact, the apron was the only thing that fit the mental image he'd so foolishly conjured up, and that barely. If there was a single smudge of dirt on the navy blue fabric he couldn't detect it. The embroidered flowers over the pockets, one of which unobtrusively held her wand, matched the red polka dots sprinkled over her smart cornflower blue dress.</p>
<p>"Miss Goldstein." His unapologetically curt tone, brought on by rising irritation with her blatant unease, would've earned a hard look from his mother. Perversely enough, her landlady seemed to approve. "I must speak with you privately regarding an issue at the office."</p>
<p>Growing impossibly paler, she nodded jerkily as she stepped down to the floor. "Y-yeah, alright. <em>Is</em> it alright, Mrs. E?"</p>
<p>The landlady considered him head to toe, lingering obviously on his clothes rather than his face, before she turned away, letting the door she'd been holding open fall against his shoulder. "Fine, seeing as how he looks like the respectable type and this is a respectable place. Don't give him any ideas to the contrary, girl," she tossed over her shoulder as she scuttled back down the narrow hall to her ground-floor apartment.</p>
<p>If Goldstein resented the remark, she gave no sign of it. Rather, as soon as her landlady's door snapped shut, she leaned forward to whisper anxiously, "Is this about Tina? Nothing's happened to her, has it?"</p>
<p>"No. So far as I know, she's fine," he said, bristling when she grasped the sleeve of his coat like a lifeline. "Granted she's no safer than any other auror in the field, but unharmed." What stopped him from shaking her off was how green her eyes appeared in her anxious face; he found himself frozen as one caught in a basilisk's stare.</p>
<p>"Honest? No foolin'?"</p>
<p>He gave a slow nod while another quieter part of himself wondered, <em>Is this how she does it? Does she lure people close, like a siren, and coax their secrets free?</em> Standing in the stuffy front hall of her building, allowing her to touch him so casually—his suspicions took on a new intensity as he instinctively braced himself for invasion.</p>
<p>Yet whatever twinge of magical pain he feared never came.</p>
<p>She let out a sigh and released her grip on his sleeve right when he made to pull away. "Sorry, it's just... I got used to seein' her around the office every day, and now <em>you</em> turn up, and..." She flapped a hand before cupping her cheek and turning aside. "I'm being silly," she said with a wry laugh.</p>
<p>The relief she felt wasn't mutual; embarrassment flooded him. What had he thought would happen when she grabbed at him, some sort of psychic assault? Travers was right—she wasn't a sorceress, or Grindelwald in disguise. She was, in all likelihood, a successful busybody. Of course there'd be no sudden pressure of another's mind seeking unwanted entry into his own, no shredding burn of someone rifling through his thoughts.</p>
<p>Had he really expected it?</p>
<p>"C'mon," she said, starting back up the stairs and tossing him a coy smile over her shoulder, oblivious to the muddle he'd found himself in. "You can tell me what brings an important guy like yourself all the way uptown just to see little old me."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Graves hadn't been unemployed since the day he graduated from Ilvermorny, so he could only imagine what the jobless got up to in their copious amounts of spare time. After hearing how she'd typically spent her days, he'd pictured her idle in her shared apartment. Perhaps lounging about in pajamas, eating cake for a very late breakfast and flipping through magazines before casting them aside in favor of a nap. He hadn't anticipated interrupting what looked to be a serious cleaning.</p>
<p>The apartment she rented with Tina was positively stuffed to the rafters with... <em>things</em>. The expected magazines were actually fighting over what order they should stack themselves on the shelf, but there were also books and potion supplies, lamps of differing heights and a small general-purpose cauldron, cooking utensils of all sorts, dishes, framed pictures, a wireless. Most of it—bickering magazines excluded—appeared to be clustered in the middle of the room, trapped in a slow-moving orbit around the twin stars of low-slung couch and dining room table. Squashy cushions floated through the air like fat moons, and the lot was attended to by a couple of harried rags while a broom and mop performed a complicated waltz around the room.</p>
<p>"Sorry about the mess," she said, blushing prettily when he hesitated by the door while stripping off his gloves, eyes widening at the cramped quarters. Of course the place would be smaller than his own Upper East Side apartment, that only made sense, but that didn't stop the usual prickle of sweat that gathered at his temples at the sight of so little space to maneuver around in.</p>
<p>Two adults lived here? How could they stand it? They'd be practically in each other's pockets, no privacy at all. His eyes moved from one thin wall to another, certain they were inching closer together, until he felt it.</p>
<p>There: a window, open, and a wayward feather duster blew towards him that he had to duck to avoid. The breeze was more summer than winter, likely thanks to some earlier charm to keep the place from freezing as she aired it out, but it still cooled the sudden sweat on his face.</p>
<p>Attention locked on that breeze, that escape out of these tight quarters into the wider city beyond, Graves barely noticed as Goldstein took his coat and scarf to hang up, then waved her wand to clear an unobstructed path for him to the couch. "I ain't used to having so much free time and I kinda got carried away trying to get it done before the new year. You want something to drink? Coffee? Tea? It ain't the season for it, but I could mix up some lemonade, there's strawberries and I just love—"</p>
<p>"Lemonade's fine." More coffee would likely kill him but if he didn't pick something he sensed she'd only keep going. There was something of the determined hostess about her that he recognized from many an agonizing society luncheon.</p>
<p>When at last they were both seated—he on the wicker couch that was bizarrely more comfortable than his own bed, she on a springy chair, both with tall glasses of unseasonable strawberry lemonade and a plate of cookies on the table between them—she crossed her trim ankles and smiled benignly at him. Her wand, he noted, was safely back in her apron pocket.</p>
<p>He did not smile back as he waited for hers to fade or her gaze to drift. Few people smiled at him for very long, and fewer still maintained eye contact. Most were like Abernathy, discomfited yet incapable of resisting the desire to look, their eyes drawn continuously as if charmed to the scars. The rest, like Travers, took great pains to avoid looking at his face entirely; they typically looked at his hands instead.</p>
<p>Queenie Goldstein sat across from him, smile as constant in its strength as <em>lumos</em>, and he realized after a lengthy silence that she wasn't going to break first.</p>
<p>It unnerved him.</p>
<p>"You're aware of Grindelwald's extradition back to Europe, correct?" he asked at last, as close to polite small talk as he was willing to waste time with.</p>
<p>"Good riddance," she said with surprising vehemence before she continued in a happier tone, "It was all over the papers for ages, so yeah, I read a thing or two about it."</p>
<p>"Auror Allegan already spoke with you about your part in the case, but I wanted to go over a thing or two with you." His cheek twitched in an abortive attempt at a nonthreatening smile. "Loose ends. You understand."</p>
<p>The first hint of her reluctance was a careful sip of lemonade. He shouldn't have tried to smile. "I dunno how I could help any more than I already have, but sure."</p>
<p>Setting his own untouched glass down on the table between them, he leaned forward slightly and clasped his hands, ignoring the framed photographs that were floating behind her head, a black-and-white Tina Goldstein self-consciously straightening up when she spotted him. "Where were you when you heard your sister was going to be executed?"</p>
<p>Goldstein winced, but that was only to be expected. "Delivering coffee to a staff meeting."</p>
<p>"Which one?"</p>
<p>"Housing and Development," she said, nudging a floating book away. <em>Protection-Charm Your Mind</em>—a typical text for aurors looking to move up at MACUSA. "I thought you said this wasn't about Tina?"</p>
<p>"It isn't. How did you find out?"</p>
<p>She blinked. "Find out what?"</p>
<p>It was a close call, but he kept both sarcasm and impatience out of his voice as he restated the question. "How did you find out she was going to be executed?"</p>
<p>"Oh." The way she chewed the inside of her cheek was interesting, but not as much as her apologetic shrug. "I guess I overheard somethin'. People talk—"</p>
<p>"Around you, yes. I've heard. Who was at the meeting?"</p>
<p>This time she didn't try to deflect, but instead rattled off a half-dozen familiar names. "It must've been one of them I heard it from," she said with another easy smile.</p>
<p>A reasonable enough conclusion except for how no one in the H&amp;D department would have the clearance for the kind of information she claimed to have stumbled across.</p>
<p>When he said as much to her, her response was as simple as it had been in her interview: "Maybe they heard it from someone else. You know how people love to gab." The smile she'd been giving him all along grew and was, like her shrug had been, tinted with apology.</p>
<p>He was halfway to agreeing when something occurred to him as the twitch of rags polishing silver caught his eye and fueled his unease. Too many things moving about, too many distractions obscuring something frightfully obvious: what she said was ridiculous, and yet he'd been ready to accept it. Why?</p>
<p>Something like a cool wind against the nape of his unprotected neck made him shiver, so different from the gentle breeze that stirred the curtains.</p>
<p>Picking up his glass, he slouched back on the couch with a mock casualness, a frown briefly crossing his face as he kept his gaze locked on the middle distance, not flicking here and there to track the feather duster still moving about with a snitch-like erraticism. "You're right, of course. Anyone would think there was nothing more important to do than gossip."</p>
<p>Predictably she agreed, though her smile dimmed as she reached for a cookie. "People can be awful when they think no one's listening," she said before reconsidering, setting it down and turning her attention back to her lemonade instead. Fidgeting. It was tempting to focus on how her slim fingers wrapped around the glass or on the faint quaver of emotion in her voice. Sincere, possibly, but distracting.</p>
<p>Allegan had been distracted. Not by Newt Scamander, with his endless supply of pointless anecdotes, but by Queenie Goldstein, who had been downright terse in comparison.</p>
<p><em>I will succeed where she failed,</em> he reminded himself, and steadied his mind as he'd been trained. As Tina's instruction manual would suggest.</p>
<p>"But that's all you do, isn't it?" he said, prodding her. "Listen, not spread it yourself?"</p>
<p>Her eyes flicked up to his. "One of those things I can't help, one I can." No trace of sympathy there, only a firm resolve that matched his own.</p>
<p><em>Admirable,</em> he thought, and found that he believed her. He would've believed her even without her willing him to. But now that he'd collected himself properly, as every auror ought to when on the clock, he could feel it: a ghostly pressure of fingertips against his cheek as if bidding him look away.</p>
<p>Gentleness was often an illusion; it was all he could do not to tense in expectation of the hand that would undoubtedly grab tight and shake and <em>crush</em> when it didn't get what it wanted.</p>
<p>The glass was there in his hand: it was either hurl it the too-small distance to shatter against a wall and hear something other than the roar of blood in his head or use it as intended.</p>
<p>Unbidden, the image of his mother's pinched face rose in his mind. <em>This is your fault. Surely after two years of school you ought to know the repairing spell?</em> His sip turned to a gulp.</p>
<p>"Good, huh?" The phantom insistence vanished as her smile widened. Every witch had a source of pride.</p>
<p>"Given what I've heard about you, I expected nothing less," he said, licking his lips and forcing his mind to relax, to let his thoughts be nudged away from his purpose for visiting her to other questions. Unimportant things he did his best not to ponder, such as: when last had anyone made anything for him? For him specifically, and not merely because he was a customer? It was galling to consider.</p>
<p>"Oh, honey." That brush of fingertips again. "How awful." There was a beat as they stared at each other across the table, both holding their glasses of lemonade like a couple of posed dolls before Goldstein set hers down with a crack against the tabletop to cross her arms. "Mr. Graves, that was a real mean trick."</p>
<p>Her wand was still in her pocket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were a number of obscure subjects Europeans devoted time to studying that Americans had been happy enough to let fall by the wayside. Ancient runes, for starters. Auguries. The mental arts.</p>
<p>The witch who had trained him in occlumency was European. Swedish extraction, if he recalled correctly, by way of Durmstrang. Grindelwald's old school, though anyone who'd been expelled couldn't be properly counted as an alumnus. That had happened late into his academic career, presumably after he'd already learned occlumency himself.</p>
<p>Huld had been a precise woman with endless reserves of patience that filled the makeshift classroom they'd assembled for her in MACUSA headquarters. Not that she had needed much beyond an empty space for a dozen or so high-ranking yet wary aurors to stand and wait their turn.</p>
<p><em>You may not have any warning in the real world, and so I will give you none,</em> she had said before silently casting the legilimency spell, sending one or another of his colleagues to their knees as she rummaged carelessly through their mind. Just long enough to teach them how humiliating it was to be so known. How dangerous it could be.</p>
<p>How painful.</p>
<p><em>Imagine if I were your enemy, and you had something I truly wanted,</em> she said one afternoon as he struggled to push her out of his head. <em>Clear your mind of anger, embarrassment, hate. Even the desire to keep me out must be set aside; strong emotions are the crack in the foundation that leads to collapse. You must push it all away until there is nothing. That is where the raw power of occlumency lies—absence. Absence of thought, emotion. If there are no words to read, there is nothing to rewrite. Do you understand?</em></p>
<p>Sitting across from Queenie Goldstein, a touch of fear evident in her pretty face as the detritus of her life together with her sister spun around the room, Graves realized with a shocking pang that understanding only took him so far.</p>
<p>
  <em>If there must be words, let them be of your own careful selection, that whoever reads them learns only what you wish.</em>
</p>
<p>The lie of his loneliness—and it was a lie, he was sure—was gone from his mind before Goldstein saw the pointlessness of glaring at him. He'd been getting all kinds of looks from people all his life; she would have to try harder to sway him now that he had his feet planted, so to speak.</p>
<p>"You're a natural, then."</p>
<p>As if by habit, her annoyance evaporated like morning mist, replaced by a wide-eyed look and a tip of her head to one side. "A natural what?"</p>
<p>"Enough." A sharp jerk of his free hand stopped her possessions where they floated in mid-air, the mop and broom frozen like statues, and at last he could pretend to relax without so many distractions. For a serious moment he considered dropping the lot on the floor just to hear the tinkle of breaking glass and cracking porcelain, but as before he resisted.</p>
<p>Barely.</p>
<p>There was still time to get the real satisfaction he was after. He didn't have to live down to his family's bad habits.</p>
<p>That didn't stop him from grinding his teeth before speaking. "You don't need to cast the spell, correct? Even nonverbally." Casting <em>legilimens</em> silently wasn't unheard of—Huld had made ample point of it—but doing so without the use of a wand was, at least to his extensive knowledge. It wasn't the levitation charm, after all; even Huld had believed it too delicate a magic to control without the additional focus a wand provided.</p>
<p>Goldstein's wand had not touched her hand since she'd made them both lemonade.</p>
<p>Her lips parted for a second, though whether it was to scold him for so rudely interfering in her charmwork or to deny his claim further he couldn't say. <em>A legili-what?</em> He'd listened to her statement enough times to be able to imagine her tone of voice exactly. But the illusion she'd maintained for years of a diverting appearance and cheerful irrelevance had failed at last, and she knew it.</p>
<p>She hugged her crossed arms tighter against her chest, creasing the front of her apron. "Yeah, that's me," she said with a roll of her eyes. "I'm a natural."</p>
<p>"Your sister knows, of course. Who else?"</p>
<p>A shrug, full not of apology this time but simmering resentment. "Nobody." Then she looked sharply up at him, her curls bouncing slightly, framing her bloodless face. "You ain't gonna demote her again, are you? Or—It ain't her fault. I-I made her not report me, I used my—"</p>
<p>He raised one hand to shush her. "No one's going to be demoted, and I'm not here to arrest you."</p>
<p>"You're no citation-scribbler, and if you ain't gonna slap the cuffs on me then what?" There was an edge to her teasing, but the tiny wrinkle that appeared between her slim brows hinted at a leery curiosity. "If you're thinking of offering me a job as some kinda official MACUSA mind-reader, you can obliviate yourself."</p>
<p>A chill ran through Graves before he could stop it. But when she continued on to say she'd already heard the spiel and wasn't interested, <em>buster</em>, he allowed himself to relax minutely. <em>If</em> he were thinking about it. With his mind (temporarily) right and his occlumency shield in place, she couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>She was just out of work. Naturally her thoughts would turn to employment. And if her sister knew, she'd doubtless been the one to suggest it.</p>
<p>Tina wasn't the only person to think of such a thing.</p>
<p>"I'm not here in any official capacity," he admitted, ignoring how she twitched. "But yes. I'd like to make you an offer."</p>
