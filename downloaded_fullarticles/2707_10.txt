    <p>Harry glanced at Dobby. "Dobby, do house elves have any problem going through wards?"</p><p>"No, Master Harry Potter Sir. We can get through anything."</p><p>"So, how do the house elves feel about Voldie?"</p><p>"Most fear him, Master Harry Potter sir. They don't want to go near him but he has a few that serve him." Dobby and Harry had been hiding in this tent for a week already. They had been about a 60 km away. They had walked here, hiding as they made their way around England.</p><p>"Dobby, I have an idea." </p><p>Dobby started bouncing. "Yes, Master Harry Potter sir, what is your idea? I will help."</p><p>"Good. My idea is simple. You bring me any house elf willing to get rid of Voldie. I have a lot of work for them."</p><p>"I will, Dobby will bring lots of house-elves for his Master Harry Potter sir." Dobby danced away.</p><p>Harry grinned and sent a coded message.</p><p>__________________________________________________________________</p><p>Harry looked at the eleven house elves in front of him. "We are looking for Horcruxes."</p><p>The house elves gasped. "Bad magic, very bad magic." A few muttered.</p><p>"Exactly. We need to find them. I have a way to destroy them and after all of them are gone can get rid of Voldie." He eyed Dobby, Kreacher, and Winky. "Dobby will be the one to speak to if you find one. We need to find a way to get a way to track Voldie's magic."</p><p>Kreacher stepped forward. "I knows."</p><p>"Kreacher?" Harry asked.</p><p>"You promise to destroy bad magics?"</p><p>"Yes, Kreacher."</p><p>At those words Kreacher disappeared with a pop and returned a few seconds later, holding a locket. "Bad magics. Killed my Reggie."</p><p>Harry took the locket. "How do we trace Voldie's magic?"</p><p>"You don't, we do." An elderly house elf stepped up. "We will touch and find."</p><p>Harry nodded as watched as each of the house-elves touched the locket and disappeared except for Kreacher. "You want to do it?"</p><p>Kreacher's eyes went big. "Me?"</p><p>"Yes, I have some Basilisk Venom that will do it."</p><p>"Yes, I do." Kreacher answered.</p><p>Harry laid the locket on the ground and went to his small endless backpack. He pulled out the phial of poison. He handed it to Kreacher. "It won't take much to do it. Just pour a drop or two on it. Move away after that, the soul piece will be furious."</p><p>Kreacher obeyed and jumped back as the locket started screaming in pain. They watched the black form come out of the locket and start to shrivel up. Kreacher looked at Harry. "We do the rest."</p><p>"Yes, we will do the rest." He was extremely glad he had ignored Dumbledore's advice and gotten a medical exam at Gringotts and discovered the Horcrux in him. They had removed it and he had spent a week recovering.</p>
