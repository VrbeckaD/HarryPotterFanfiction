<p><b>What Dreams Were Made Of</b><br/>
Characters: Harry Potter<br/>
Prompt: Stuffed</p>
<p><br/>
*~*~*<br/>
This was the stuff dreams were made of, Harry thought when he first entered Hogwarts. Magic was real, and opened up a whole new world where he had gold in his pockets, a friend at his side, and a castle to call his home.<br/>
 <br/>
The enchantment didn’t last. Soon, he learned that magic could also take the form of lies carved into his flesh in blood and pain; the Unforgivable Curse that killed his parents; and a prophecy he could not escape.<br/>
 <br/>
Yet year after year, Harry stepped back onto platform 9¾, because this was the stuff life was made of.<br/>

Magic marked you.<br/>
 <br/>
At first, she couldn't keep her eyes from popping at new miracles, her ears from straining after strange sounds. Dinners were accompanied by candles floating beneath the night sky, and breakfast by the sound of beating wings.<br/>
 <br/>
She would never forget the first electrifying jolt of holding a wand in her hand, and delighted in practicing until the proper motions became engrained in her muscles and bones.<br/>
 <br/>
Magic imprinted itself on your senses, and marked you indelibly as its own. As Hermione stepped back into the Muggle world, she could still feel it singing in her veins.<br/>

1) Normal is good.<br/>
 <br/>
2) There’s no sense in buying anything unless it’s the newest model, makes your neighbours envious, or will provide a happy distraction for Dudley for at least ten minutes.<br/>
 <br/>
3) Your child is the most perfect, delightful, and intelligent human being ever set upon this earth. Anyone who says otherwise is simply jealous or blind.<br/>
 <br/>
4) Never, ever let strangers wearing oddly coloured robes or pointy hats into your home.<br/>
 <br/>
5) If, despite your best efforts, those magi – I, mean, weirdos, do somehow manage to enter your abode, do not accept any food from them, and try to get them out as soon as possible.<br/>
 <br/>
6) Your life will start again when your nephew reaches seventeen years of age and you can boot him out of the house with a clear conscience.<br/>
 <br/>
7) Do not expect those ruddy postal owls to be house-trained.<br/>
 <br/>
8) Your neighbours value normality just as much as you do. Therefore, they will happily accept any half-baked, logical explanation for the flying car hovering by your house, the hundred owls hooting on your roof, or the pig’s tail sprouting from your son’s bottom.<br/>
 <br/>
9) If you ignore something hard enough, it will cease to exist.<br/>
 <br/>
10) Normal is very, very good.<br/>

"Harry, you don't have to go back," Aunt Petunia suggested. "My sister was hopeless, but even if you're…her kind, you can still choose a normal life. Smeltings is out of the question, but a nice public school perhaps?"<br/>
 <br/>
Harry rubbed his hands nervously. Quidditch had left calluses that ran from the tips of his pinkies to the top of his wrists. He thought of Ron and Hermione, of all the memories crammed inside his school trunk, and knew that he could never be truly alive in her world.<br/>
 <br/>
"I need to go back," he answered firmly. "It's where I belong.”<br/>

Prompt: Everyday objects gone awry.</p>
<p><br/>
*~*~*<br/>
Two hours before the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin, a duel broke out in the most unlikely place: the library. By the time Madame Pince had chased out the combatants, Colin Creevey had sprouted feathers, Malcolm Baddock was blown up like a balloon, and countless misdirected spells and hexes had been fired into the book stacks.<br/>
 <br/>
Unbeknownst to everyone, a certain book woke to life.<br/>
 <br/>
Had anyone opened it within the next fortnight, it would have given directions to the best snogging spot on the school grounds, told them what portraits dreamed about, revealed Tom Riddle’s greatest weakness, and explained why they should all avoid the shepherd’s pie at dinner.<br/>
 <br/>
Unfortunately, nobody ever did, and <em>Hogwarts: A History</em> was forced to keep its secrets as it silently gathered dust upon the shelf.<br/>
