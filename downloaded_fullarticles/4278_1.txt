  <b>Episode 1: You’re a Wizard, Tony</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony was bored, bored, bored. He was trying to be good but he was eight years old. He didn’t care if Daddy needed to make new friends or mommy said he shouldn’t talk to the adults. What was he supposed to do? He was</span>
  <em>
    <span> bored!</span>
  </em>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony’s eyes lit up seeing his mom’s brother. Uncle Clive was kind of cool even if he was old. “Hey, Uncle, can we pretty please go into the village ... I’m so bored and you said we could go watch that sport you told me about. Cricket?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>His Uncle chuckled. “You bored, little one?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony nodded and for added effect, he upped his pout. He was always taught to use all his tools. “Can we please go before I get into trouble with Mom and Dad?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>His Uncle snorted as the child may only be eight but he did know how to plan ahead already. He obviously knew he was going to get in trouble if he stuck around so he was taking steps to fix it. He should be commended really. Tony had already learned that being stuck around so many adults meant he had to use manipulation to make them listen to him. “Go on, go get your coat. There is a game going on at the village green. Lucelia, if you see Claire or Anthony can you tell them I have stolen their son for a little while. I will bring him back later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His wife, Lucelia, nodded, amusement lighting her eyes. She didn’t know how her nephew managed it but he had her husband wrapped around his finger. She had been devastated when Crispin, their son, had died from Dragon Pox and yet, it was only Tony that had pulled her husband out of his funk. “Go, I will let them know. You two have fun and stay out of trouble.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>~*~</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Tony was walking hand in hand with his Uncle. It was his Uncle’s rule that while he was in a foreign country he needed to abide by this one simple thing. Tony didn’t mind as Uncle Clive always answered his never ending questions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why does that tree make me shiver?” Tony asked because it was the one tree he hated on the property in Hogmorton. Although, even the name of the place confused Tony as some of the people were calling it Hogsmeade as well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His Uncle looked at him sharply. “It does? Can you tell me what about it that makes you feel like that? Do your best....”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony thought hard about it. His Uncle had asked him a serious question so he thought really hard about his answer. “I feel it here.” Tony answered pointing to a place just by his heart. Clive was astounded because unbeknownst to Tony, that was where a magical core sat. Huh, Clive was going to be having words with his sister. Tony would need to be going to school at Hogwarts if he was able to pick up the haunted tree at eight in amongst all the ambivalent magic in the air. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clive wanted to introduce him to one of the lesser known delights of the wizarding world - </span>
  <em>
    <span>Seriously exploding candy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. It was similar enough to the Muggle candy called pop-rocks that he could get away with it so it would be fine. “Come on, let’s go to Ms. Bertie's sweet shop. She has the best sweets ever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Tony looked at the adults on the street and it was like earlier. It was like there were two crowds of people. There were the normal adults talking about things and then there were the other people - the ones wearing dresses and speaking funny. Not like a funny accent, they were using weird words. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t get why none of them seemed to notice the others - why weren’t they looking?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His Uncle seemed to see the same thing as he did. He kept nodding at some of them. The way they responded to his Uncle spoke of respect. His Uncle must be the big cheese.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do they keep nodding their head to you, Uncle Clive?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>His Uncle smirked. “Do you understand what a Lord is?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony nodded his head, it wasn’t American but his mamma would explain all the cool things from the land of her birth. “Yeah, Mamma explained.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Well, that’s good and I am one. Your mamma was Lady Paddington until she married your father.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony frowned, not liking the sound of that. “Why did she have to give it up?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>His Uncle chuckled at his defensive tone. “Fear not, Anthony. It was not a punishment but if your mother wanted to be American she had to renounce her title. She did it by her choice.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony shrugged as his mother was pretty and cool. So if she wanted to give it up then it was okay he supposed. He moved onto different thoughts. “So I have one last question, Uncle?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Only one?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Tony rolled his eyes. He was eight it was good to be curious about the world, wasn’t it? “For now.”</span>
</p><p>“Ask your question, little one.”</p><p>
  <span>“How are the people wearing dresses and no one is laughing at them?” Tony asked, knowing that if he was back home in Long Island that all the men wearing dresses would be made fun of. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Uncle ruffled his hair. “There is a very good answer to that question. For now, I am going to tell you that I need an hour or two before I can answer that question. We will need to talk to your Dad and Mom first.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony sighed because he wanted to know now but he could wait. “So where is the awesome sweet shop?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>His Uncle pointed across the green patch that Tony remembered his Dad called the Village Green. It was cool, they had the patch between the shops and that was where the Cricket thing was taking place. They all wore white which seemed silly to Tony. If they slid to the ground then they just got mucky from the mud and the grass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony </span>
  <em>
    <span>oo’d</span>
  </em>
  <span> when the one player hit the ball with the bat. “What are the rules?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Well, you have two teams - the batting and fielding side and each team has eleven men. The simplest rule is this - if you are the batsman you want to keep your wicket, which is the wood behind them, safe and intact. If the bowler breaks it your are out, or, if you hit a ball in the air and a fielder catches it you are out. They are other ways but that is the gist. The fielding team needs to take 10 wickets to get in to bat themselves.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony looked closer at the game. “Looks cool but I think I prefer football.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Clive shook his head because he was sure if Tony knew what Quidditch was - then he would claim a new sport but he was getting ahead of himself. Clive still needed to speak to Claire and Anthony Senior about his suspicions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can watch some of the game later if you wish but for now ... let’s get your sweets. We don’t want your mother upset, do we?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Clive ushered young Anthony into the shop and showed him a few of the sweets. The fact that he was magical meant that he was no longer as careful about what he showed the young boy. He had no idea that someone had naively broken the Paddington wards by inviting the Deatheaters into his house. Senior always had eyes bigger than his bank accounts only now - it would see every party guest dead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What he did know was that one minute he was pointing out sweets to Tony and then the next minute they were collapsed on the floor as the brunt of the pooled family magic settled on the two remaining family members. </span>
</p><p>~*~</p><p>
  <span>The attack was quick and coordinated. Abraxas Malfoy had found Clivis Paddington to be a thorn in his side. He was only too happy to make an example of the man’s family as a way to </span>
  <em>
    <span>convince</span>
  </em>
  <span> other families that there was no such thing as neutrality. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lady Paddington had been vicious and nearly disemboweled one of his fighters with a cutting curse - only she hadn’t targeted a limb but rather his stomach. Abraxas had personally killed her. There had been some muggles here, who had been like lambs to the slaughter. They had no business being here and were too stupid to run. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Moments later and everyone was dead thanks to the unforgivable's - all cast using stolen wands so that they could not be traced. “Torch it and cast the sign. Our Lord is in the ascendancy and it is time to let people know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Job done, they slipped away like cowards into the night. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <em>
    <span>They narrowly missed a disorientated Clive Paddington who was still clutching Tony’s hand. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tony was bewildered, one minute they’d been at the sweet shop and on the floor and the next, Uncle Clive had told him to close his eyes and they were back at the house. Only, gone was the grand mansion and all that was left of it looked like a shack. It was grim and the air smelt bad to his nose. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony pointed to the green mark he could see in the sky. “What is that?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Clive was furious in a way he had not felt in years. He’d had no intention of getting involved in this blood war. It was a foolish crusade that would do nothing but cull the magical’s numbers. “The sign of a very stupid man who has just ... just hurt our family.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony was still holding his hand as he felt so sad. It hurt in his heart, he hadn’t said but he already knew what his Uncle was going to say. “They are all dead aren’t they?” There were tears running down his face but he hadn’t acknowledged them.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Clive nodded because he had a rule. If a child was old enough to ask a question then they deserved an honest answer. “Yes.” Clive was just glad that Tony obviously hadn’t received the images of the deaths like he had. The Lord of a Noble and Ancient House was a burden for a reason.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s going to happen to me?” Tony asked, scared. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clive bent down. “No one will take you are from me, Anthony. I won’t let them. We will survive this together. Par Viribus Virtus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony wiped his tears away from his face. His Uncle looked fierce and sure. He wanted to be like that, not scared and afraid. “What does it mean?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“It is the Paddington Family Motto. It means virtue through strength and I need you to do something for me. I need you to stay quiet whilst I talk to the men who will be here shortly. I promise that I will explain everything soon but this is very important.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Anthony nodded, Uncle Clive was all had in the world right now. His Uncle patted his shoulder. “The police are coming but I will be calling them by an odd name. Auror, it’s perfectly normal for people like us, Anthony.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>He nodded, still bewildered at everything that had happened. In truth, he hadn’t wanted to consider what it meant. He kept looking at the smoke as his Uncle spoke. Tony remembered how his Daddy said that the English could be funny but this was weird even for that. They kept talking with weird words like</span>
  <em>
    <span> Fuego, Mordesmorde and even Avada Kedavra.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The policemen person asked his Uncle, “Who is this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His Uncle Clive kept a hand on his shoulder. “He is my heir, Antonius Paddington.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony didn’t understand there and then about what was happening but he did feel something settle deep inside him. He knew that his Uncle had made a promise so good that he felt it in his bones. He didn’t know enough of the magical world to understand about unbreakable vows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he had just received one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His Uncle clasped his shoulder. “We are going to do the funny travel thing again. Close your eyes and just keep your focus on me.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony nodded and concentrated real hard. He felt the pull from his stomach and he trusted his Uncle to keep him safe. It was like he said - they were all the other had. The place they landed looked like a palace. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Welcome to your new home, Antonius. Now, I know how sad you are, I feel it too but you need to rest. I have a very special drink that will help you sleep. Tomorrow I will explain everything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony nodded. “Okay. Where do I sleep?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Clive smiled softly and it was the first time he’d managed even a faint one. “Let me show you.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Tony was in awe. He didn’t get a chance to really take it in as his Uncle asked him to take his drink, even the cup was cool and smoked a little. The minute he drank it he fell asleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clive felt very old. Voldemort had taken his neutrality off the table. If the man wanted a war - he’d got one. The vicious bastard had taken his wife and his entire family from him. It was only a miracle that he’d survived with young Anthony. He hadn’t let the Aurors release that fact he was still living. He’d informed Ragnok he was alive and he wanted a list of the names who tried to grab the family vaults. The family magic was holding back his grief knowing that he had to be clear headed to plan. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then there was young Anthony who was completely unaware of his heritage. The child was in for a rude awakening and a crash course in magic that he would need to adapt to. He had three years before Anthony would be attending Hogwarts - he wanted his heir ready to survive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Abraxas Malfoy was walking through Gringotts with a sneer. He was only here to start the paperwork for claiming the vault. His wife was a Paddington through a marriage. It was close enough he could make a claim. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>An hour later, he was meeting with his vault manager. “What do you mean?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“The Paddington vault is not up for claiming as there are still living members.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy snorted, slamming his cane down on the floor. “The whole bleeding family perished. It was all over the Daily Prophet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, they weren’t and at this time the Goblins have been instructed to not disclose who survived as it was clear that the Dark Lord has chosen to target the family.” Razor informed his client. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I demand to see the manager of the bank.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Razor looked down the nose of his glasses and a sword had appeared at his hip. “Lord Malfoy, you would do well to remember this Goblin Sovereign ground. That </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bank Manager </span>
  </em>
  <span>is our King and you don’t make demands of a King in his own home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the early hours of the next morning, Clive Paddington received a missive through a Firebird. They were stunning creatures, similar to but not quite a Phoenix. The missive was a list of names. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Corban Yaxley </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Walburga Black</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Abraxus Malfoy</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Druella Rossier</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Cantankerous Nott</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He sipped his fire whiskey considering his plan. He wanted to be a perennial thorn in Voldemort’s side but he had to think about this carefully. He knew now who was not on his side and wanted him dead. He would greet them with a smile until such a time he could gut them and get away with it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needs to organise Anthony a wand and he would need to talk to Dumbledore which always was a stretch of his patience. The boy would need a wardrobe and tutors, plus, he would need to be educated in the magical world and his place amongst the sacred twenty-eight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He fire-called Croaker, Clive was never high on trust but this had just cemented his distrust. </span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“You’re alive, you canny bastard.” Croaker said, grinning in delight at some good news. “I am sorry for your wife and family.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Clive nodded, circumspect. “I intend to make the </span>
  <em>
    <span>dark wanker </span>
  </em>
  <span>pay, Croaker, but I need help. I have a young heir who shows all the signs of being very powerful but is a complete newcomer to our world.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“How do you know his power level?” Croaker asked, knowing that with someone like Clive it wasn’t misplaced familial pride.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clive snorted. “How about asking why the Haunted Tree was bad and felt funny to his ... well, he didn’t know it was his magical core.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Now Croaker was intrigued. “Who?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“My nephew, Anthony DiNozzo. His parents were at the party yesterday, Claire was a squib and her waster of a husband was a muggle. They would have had no chance. It’s why I am calling. I have done the paperwork at the bank, Ragnok himself oversaw it. I need to get the same filed at the ministry under sealed files ... I am waiting as long as possible before I let the Deatheaters know they didn’t finish the job.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Croaker snorted because there were few wizards that could beat him for controlled viciousness. Voldemort didn’t know it yet but he’d made a massive mistake yesterday. “Consider it done, my old friend. When you are feeling less lethally protective I want to visit you and your nephew.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Clive smirked because his friend knew him too well. “Ragnok is beside himself with his joy. I have authorised the creation of new Goblin Warwards and that is not up for discussion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Croaker looked pleased. “Good, you will hear no complaint from me. If people are stupid enough to attack you then they deserve death. They attacked an Ancient and Noble House today and you survived it so I have no doubt that you will get your revenge.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clive raised his glass. “</span>
  <span>Par Viribus Virtus.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Croaker snorted. “Words to live by, send me your files.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clive took one last look at the photo of him and Lucelia and went to sleep a few hours. Their marriage had been arranged like expected but he held great affection for his wife. The Death Eaters had taken her from him and that would not be allowed to go unanswered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~*~</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>The next morning Anthony woke up feeling refreshed. Then the wave of sadness hit him - his momma and father were dead. They’d ended up hurt in that building that Uncle Clive had taken him far away from with a cool trick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted to do that trick if he could just get his stomach settled when he got to the new place. The bed was massive and now he understood why his mommy had given him the big King Louis bed. It was because it reminded her of home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked at the end of the bed and saw the clothes at the end of it. They were like the funny clothes he’d seen the people wearing yesterday.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shrugged seeing that he would have nothing to wear unless he put them on. He did and wandered out into the hall. It was full of golden things and the paintings </span>
  <em>
    <span>moved</span>
  </em>
  <span>. His emotions were pushed to the side as he explored.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a painting of Grandpa Paddington, he was sure of it. “You remind me of my Claire, such a shame she was a squib.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony stood up straight and confused. How was a painting talking to him like Grandpa? Still, he was adaptable and found himself saying. “She was my mother, Grandpa.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Huh.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony had listened to a lot of stories about his grandpa and none of them would suggest he would have said a word. “Have I said something wrong?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“You don’t seem to find it strange that I am talking?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tony didn’t shrug as his mother had always lectured him that it was bad manners. “Grandpa, right now, I find </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span> strange ... but Uncle has promised to explain everything to me this morning. In fact, I was trying to find him.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“He is down the hall in his study.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Tony bowed slightly. “Thanks, Grandpa.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony knocked on his Uncle’s study door. “Good morning, Uncle. Can I come in?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course you can, how did you sleep?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Tony answered. “Very well, I didn’t think about yesterday at all. I still have lots of questions though. Why were we attacked? How did we get from there to here? And why did grandpa just talk when he is a painting? This is freaky stuff but everything is upside down and I don’t understand why!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clive liked the fact that at eight, Anthony could hold his own. They were all fair questions too. He started simply knowing that there was no easy way to break it to him. Once the secret was out there - then they could move on as a family, together.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Well, Tony, you see - you’re a wizard.”</span>
  </em>
