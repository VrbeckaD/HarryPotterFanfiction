  <b>Professors Riddle, Black</b>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> <b>: </b> <em> I do not own Harry Potter or the associated characters. </em></p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Can someone <em> be </em>so beautiful? Her Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher was, right down to the nails on her fingers.</p><p>Her black hair and pale skin was just so… Enticing. Her eyes dark, but perfectly full of that beauty that graced her whole body. She just admired her, nothing more, she told herself.</p><p>Hermione smiled as her professor lazily handed out her papers, hers, as usual, with an ‘O’. She nudged Harry next to her, who turned his paper facedown.</p><p>“Disappointed?” She asked playfully.</p><p>“Could've done better.” He answered, shrugging.</p><p>When Ron was handed his own paper, he coughed, looking around, before covering the writing.</p><p>When the professor reached her desk in front of the room, she cleared her throat, catching everyone's attention.</p><p>“Disappointed with most test scores. If there's anything that will at least <em> help </em> you raise your knowledge, please <em> do </em> tell me!” She demanded, narrowing her eyes and looking across the room at her packed classroom. There was silence. “ <em> Anything </em> that would help?”</p><p>Hermione just smiled, knowing well that this was not directed at her. Her professor went on about grades until class was dismissed. She stood by the door and glared at all the students as they passed, save for Hermione, for her mouth moved into a straight line.</p><p>It was near dinner, so Hermione was glad to go to the Great Hall. She found her seat next to Harry and Ron, filling her plate only lightly. Ron looked at her quizzically.</p><p>“Something the matter, Hermione?”</p><p>“Nothing’s wrong, just tired.” Hermione replied, looking over to the staff table where Professor Black was missing. Ten minutes in, she had arrived, a light smirk laid upon her red lips. A man, Professor Riddle, the other DADA teacher, walked in with her. Hermione huffed, watching as he pulled the chair out for her to sit. He sat next to her, as always, Hermione noticed.</p><p>She felt an odd twinge in her stomach as he leant over and whispered something in Professor Black’s ear. They both laughed, and Dumbledore shot them a look, shutting them up. Half the room watched this, and Professor Black was obviously trying to hold in her anger. She had a sour look on her face, and instead shot Dumbledore a glare, before turning to eat.</p><p>Hermione snorted at the interaction, the two adults getting called off by the headmaster. Ron and Harry, who had also seen the exchange, held in fits of laughter. Hermione felt the burn of eyes on her, and turned to see Professor Black staring at her with a raised eyebrow. Hermione nervously waved to her and elbowed Harry, shaking her head.</p><p>“She's watching us!” Hermione informed in a hushed tone.</p><p>Ron shrugged and stuffed chicken into his mouth. Harry turned to see Professor Black speaking to her table mate once again.</p><p>“It's nothing. Probably just something to keep up that ‘creepy, dark teacher’ vibe. You know she's crazy. Everyone does, but no one says anything. She keeps the strangest company, too. That other DADA teacher, Riddle.”</p><p>“She's not crazy! She has a unique way of teaching… Plus, you see Snape, he's got that vibe, too!” Hermione had to keep from shouting.</p><p>Ron took his turn and piped up, “Pansy said she saw Riddle and Black snogging in the corridor!”</p><p>“You know how Pansy likes to spread rumors.” Hermione defended.</p><p>“I've seen her talking to her cat. She might be a little… Off. You seem keen to defend her.” Harry teased.</p><p>“Well… Maybe she likes her cat. I talk to Crookshanks sometimes. Am I crazy?” She ignored his last comment.</p><p>“I don't know about that one.” Ron joked.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Did you hear about the dance coming up?” Harry asked.</p><p>Hermione gasped as she remembered- it was almost Christmas! “I completely forgot! It's only in a few days!”</p><p>“I bet Professor Black is going to wear something <em> brilliant </em>. Remember last dance when she wore that dress? Was that even allowed with the school rules? All the students stared at her!” Ron almost shouted, throwing his hands up in the air.</p><p>Hermione <em> did </em> remember her Professor’s outfit, a dress, much too short, she suspected, for the school dress code. Dark green, which showed her Slytherin house preference. Her heels were black and strappy, and her wild hair was tamed into a special updo. She lurked in the shadows and broke up anything inappropriate between students, with a bite in her tone. Pansy Parkinson snorted and said ‘It's because she's not getting any’.</p><p>Everyone around her laughed. Black narrowed her eyes but instead watched them, listening, like always, to their ‘secret’ conversations. Riddle joined her in her lurking, and they all heard a startled whisper from her as they met. He seemed to sneak up and scare her often, probably in a flirty way. Well, definitely not in an aggressive way.</p><p>Hermione blushed, sitting at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, thinking of her DADA Professor. She'd admit it wasn't the worst thing to be thinking of, after all.</p><p>Professor Black was a pureblood, Hermione remembered, thoughtfully. What was her Professor’s opinion on <em> her </em>? A ‘mudblood’? She had the highest scores in all her classes! Almost competing with the other DADA Professor, Tom Riddle. Almost competing with Professor Black herself...</p><p>It wasn't a lie, her Professor had all the best marks in all her years, and had the head girl title. Tom, years before her, had been the same, being head boy. Aside from that, no one knew much about the mysterious man. They knew very little about Black, aside from her air of superiority over her students- Because of her blood status. She flaunted it often, purposely using a leather notebook that had ‘<em> Toujours Pur </em> ’ printed on the cover- some pureblood saying, meaning ‘ <em> Always Pure </em>’.</p><p>Hermione sighed as the dinner was called to an end. Ron, Harry, and herself headed back to the common room.</p><p>They passed the two DADA Professors on the way, and Hermione listened to a bit of their conversation as they passed.</p><p>“You're twenty five years older than me, and leading me to a strange place, should I be worried?” Black asked, smiling.</p><p>“You're twenty five years younger than me, and thinking about it just now, should <em> I </em>be worried?” He replied darkly, placing a hand on her lower back, guiding her down a turn.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione lost sight of them as a swarm of people walked in front of her.</p><p>“Wonder what they're up to…” Harry hummed, Ron nodding his head in agreement, “Should we see what's up?”</p><p>Hermione snorted. “You have a way of looking for trouble. Harry, why don't you get the cloak and the map?” She confirmed.</p><p>The boys grinned and excitedly ran to the common room, leaving Hermione standing alone.</p><p>After a few minutes, the boys returned, holding the items in a bag slung over Harry's shoulder. They moved into a dark spot, managing to fit all three of them under the fabric, barely. Harry looked at the map and saw the moving feet of Bellatrix Black with Tom Riddle standing close together, feet in a perfect, synced rhythm. They were talking to each other, from the looks of it. Hermione wondered if he still had his hand there, but shook it off in her brain.</p><p>Crammed into the space of the invisibility cloak, they followed the feet on the map, until the shoes turned and stopped- an unused classroom.</p><p>They reached the door, which was slightly cracked open. They could clearly hear the conversation now.</p><p>“Meow for me, Bella.” Riddle’s voice rang out.</p><p>“Such a weird request. But of course you'd ask me to.” She giggled and there was a bang inside the room. It wasn't possible to see inside. “<em> Meow </em>.”</p><p>He chuckled and she huffed, “Please don't turn me into a cat for real… Again…”</p><p>“You know I wouldn't do that. Or do you not?”</p><p>“How should I know, <em> mysterious </em> man. That's what they call you.”</p><p>“I shouldn't say what they call <em> you </em>.”</p><p>“I know. That evil bitch, moody, and the witch who ‘doesn't get any’.”</p><p>“Well, they obviously don't know what they're talking about, do they, <em> Professor </em>?”</p><p>“Remember when I was your student? That was <em> years </em> ago. <em> You're </em> Professor to me, sir.” She was flirty now, and there was a noise of something small and hard hitting the floor.</p><p>“How could I not remember, Bella? I feel quite offended you try to chuck your shoes at me.” He was returning by being playful back, yet a hint of something darker in his voice. There was a lighter noise of what was probably the shoe hitting something, then a muffled ‘<em> ow </em>’.</p><p>“You clunked me in the head! It's not fair you can use your wand, Professor.” She whined as there was a clatter of wood hitting the floor, “I don't like it when you transfigure my outfit without asking.”</p><p>“You love it. Go on, do it.”</p><p>“Meow. Meow, meow, <em> meow </em>.” There was a pause, “Hey! You bit me!” Her voice exclaimed, “That wasn't very nice of you, Professor.” She used her baby voice.</p><p>Hermione, Ron, and Harry all looked at each other, wide-eyed.</p><p>“Miss Black. Forgive me?”</p><p>“Detention. Tomorrow after class. I'll give all the kids to Snivellus… It's weird now, isn't it? Now that I work here. Much more exciting than being a housewife, though. Couldn't imagine sitting at home all day cleaning and only seeing my husband, assuming he works here, on vacations. Don't marry me, by the way. My father would probably like having you in his circle, but my mother would kill me. All that blood stuff, which, by the way, I don't mind. If anything, you've taught me to respect it. I <em> do </em> , let me tell you, I <em> love it </em>.” She commented smoothly.</p><p>“I think you're drunk.”</p><p> </p><p>He growled at her, and there was the scraping of a piece of furniture on the ground.</p><p>“Do that again.” She laughed, “<em> Please </em>, Professor?”</p><p>More scraping, and laughing from both of them.</p><p>“I don't need to marry you to make you mine, do I?” He snapped.</p><p>“Of course not. I was yours the second I walked in that door. Even when Roddy was around.”</p><p>“Good girl.”</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>There was a noise outside the door- Ron sneezed and looked quite guilty.</p><p>“I heard something. Was the door open this whole time? Ugh.” Professor Black sighed, rising from her place, which was lying on an old teacher's desk. She was wearing a <em> student uniform </em>, but her shirt was unsurprisingly unbuttoned. The door slammed shut and it's hinges creaked in protest.</p><p>“Anyone could have been listening, Bella! I thought I told you to close it!” He yelled angrily.</p><p>“Sorry…” She trailed off innocently.</p><p>“I know you're not.”</p><p>“No detention from <em> me </em>, I see now. Punish me.” She breathed, leaning against the wood.</p><p>“Oh, I will.” He barked.</p><p>Then there was no sound, assuming someone had put a muffling spell over the room.</p><p>The three friends had wide eyes and blinked multiple times before speaking.</p><p>“What was that?!” They asked at the same time.</p><p>Harry rubbed the back of his neck, Hermione was blushing, and Ron’s mouth was gaping open.</p><p>“I can't believe it…” Ron started, shaking his head.</p><p>“I think we all need to sleep this off and forget about it, right?” Harry gasped.</p><p>“I second that!” Hermione agreed.</p><p> </p><p>When they reached the common room, they all rushed to their dorms, to their beds. Hermione changed into her night clothes and laid down in bed, covering her head with her pillow. Tomorrow was truly going to be awkward for her.</p><p>She had a dream about her teacher, Professor Black, that night, and woke up quite flustered. Much less appropriate than what a dream should be- not that she should be dreaming about her Professor at all.</p><p>She woke later than normal, crunched for time to get ready. She rushed and hastily grabbed her things, running to her first class. Having already read most of what was being taught here, she subconsciously thought about her teacher again. Not so nice thoughts.</p><p>Her day was quite the same, until she stood in front of her Defence Against the Dark Arts class nervously. She was a few minutes early. Her hand lingered on the doorknob before turning it and pulling the door out.</p><p>Her professor was lounging in her chair with her feet up, eyes closed- until her top student stepped one shoe into the class.</p><p>Professor Black opened her eyes and looked up at Hermione. She brought her feet down and yawned, cocking her head at Hermione’s red face.</p><p>“You may sit. Technically you're on <em> my </em> time, so you can wait.”</p><p>Hermione slowly sat in her normal chair, facing the front of the classroom.</p><p>Professor Black stood from her seat and searched for something in the cupboard before pulling out two potion bottles, one small and brown, the other larger and dark green. She opened the cork to the brown one and downed it easily, before throwing the other across the room, as if trying to smash it against the door. No crash sounded, and Hermione looked behind her with a jump, to see Riddle holding the other bottle, in the position of just catching it. He sniffed airily with his head tilted up.</p><p>Hermione was a bit startled to see him, as she hadn't heard him come in.</p><p>“You're welcome.” She droned, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>He grunted and turned to open the door, but she stopped him by closing it with her wand so she could speak.</p><p>“Next time brew your own potion, then.” She snapped, throwing the door open for him.</p><p>“Thanks.” He muttered, exiting.</p><p>The door clicked shut and both women could just feel his powerful magic emitting angrily from him.</p><p>“<em> Men </em>. He's more moody than me sometimes…” Black said, leaning on her desk as she pulled on a strand of dark hair, straightening it, and letting it go, where from there it bounced back into place.</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat and Professor Black’s eyes widened.</p><p>“You're still here? Of course you are… Homework on my desk, please.”</p><p>Hermione raced up to the front of the room and dropped a large stack of papers on the wood. All homework from <em> one night </em>.</p><p>“Tell me something about your homework last night. About the werewolves.”</p><p>“Well, they change in the time of a full moon, and after, they are worn out, due to the tiring transformation and activity.” Hermione elaborated, “I can say more about-”</p><p>“That's good for now.”</p><p>Hermione realized Black was wearing a thicker robe, and when she pulled it off, the girl blushed, the image of her teacher with her shirt unbuttoned popped into her head. She quickly pulled her books up to cover her colored face.</p><p>Hermione peeked over at her body and saw a bruise- or was it that?- on her Professor’s collar bone. Black sat down in her chair and looked at Hermione’s work, boredly running her hand over the mark near her neck.</p><p>Hermione quickly looked away, blinking once, before turning back and meeting the eyes of her Professor, who was down to her level so they could look each other in the eyes. Her eyes darted down to Black's chest, before realizing what she was doing and snapping them up.</p><p>“The paper on bogarts?” Her professor asked her with a weird look on her face, at Hermione’s strange actions. She seemed not to have noticed her change in gaze.</p><p>Quickly, she fished it out of her bag and placed it lightly on the table.</p><p>“Of course, Professor!” She said, a bit too enthusiastically.</p><p>“Sure.” Black answered, shrugging and standing slowly, unknowingly giving her student the view of her breasts, “You don't have to linger. You have other classes, correct? It must be your free period…”</p><p>Hermione gasped when she realized she was <em> very </em> early for class. It <em> was </em> her free period. No wonder no one was here. It must have been Professor Black’s, as well.</p><p>“He's coming back, I can feel it.” Black commented, using her wand to flick open the wood covering the entrance.</p><p>Professor Riddle walked smoothly on the ground over to his female counterpart, not noticing the student in the room.</p><p>“Feeling better, Professor?” She asked him, taking in his appearance, which was perfect and clean.</p><p>“Thanks to you.” He smirked, and put his hands on her shoulders, “Do <em> you </em> feel better?”</p><p>“Are you assuming I felt bad in the first place?” She said dryly, waving her hand and trying to dismiss Hermione.</p><p>Riddle turned to look at her with narrowed eyes and she quickly grabbed her bag before moving to the door.</p><p>He looked over at Professor Black, before using his own wand to close the door in front of Hermione.</p><p>“Stay, tell me a bit about yourself,” Riddle said smoothly, “It's always interesting to hear from the top student. Right, Professor?” He elbowed Black, who he stood next to, and she rolled her eyes.</p><p>Professor Riddle beckoned Hermione to sit back in her seat. She did, cautiously.</p><p>“You're muggle born, yes?” He asked darkly.</p><p>“That is true. But just because one is born outside wizarding families does not make me any less capable of learning magic.” She retorted.</p><p>Riddle raised an eyebrow and nodded once. Hermione felt a strange prickling in her head and suddenly recalled the dream about Professor Black- of course, absent of clothes. Hermione had never been with a girl, but Black made her curious.</p><p>She blushed, eyes wide, and looked over at Riddle, who tilted his head up knowingly. Many girls had said Professor Riddle was one of the most attractive they'd ever seen. Seeing how beautiful Black was- it made them somewhat perfect together.</p><p>Many of her classmates were jealous that Black pretty much had him wrapped around her finger.</p><p>She was very easy to like- if she didn't open her mouth, that was. Almost all words came out dripping with attitude and soaked in a snarky tone.</p><p>People had briefly heard him refer to her as a ‘Raging Incendio spell’. Of course, that was only once, when she had slapped him in the hallway to the Great Hall because he had conspicuously lowered his hand past her back. She hissed at him, like a cat, and he snorted, grabbing her wrist and pulling her back as she tried to walk away. He said something quietly in her ear, and she bared her teeth at his glare. She obviously wasn't in the mood that day.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Any interesting thoughts going through your mind?” Riddle asked.</p><p>It really wasn't any of his business. Hermione shook her head. Black answered for her.</p><p>“Well, next year should be a good one, I think.”</p><p>“Are you an only child?” Riddle asked.</p><p>“Yes, I am.” Hermione replied.</p><p>“You live with your parents?”</p><p>“Yep.” She smiled happily.</p><p>“What is it like? Being an only child like that?” He asked</p><p>“It gets kind of lonely sometimes. I do have my own space, and I like it. Do you have any siblings, Professor Riddle?”</p><p>“I have a sister!” Black interrupted.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione knew she had two, but she said nothing. Her, being in a pureblood family, had disowned Andromeda, the middle child. Well, according to Draco.</p><p>Riddle gave Hermione a look and they both turned to see Professor Black playing with a curl of her dark hair.</p><p>Hermione tried to drag her dreaming eyes off the older woman with little result. Riddle just sat, gaze empty.</p><p>Hermione wondered briefly if Black had any children. Or the male professor, himself. She decided not to ask. Professor Black didn't give off the parental vibe, being almost immature and insensitive, but she was young enough to be a mother. Professor Riddle definitely didn't give it off either. He was obviously much older, with grey hairs sprouting up. Surely, his offspring would be grown by now, even Black’s age. But he was too… He was very serious. He was dark, in a way. He had a looming sense that tended to ruffle students, namely the first years. Not the qualities of a father. Not to mention the subject of finding a woman to raise his child. No one had ever seen him with one, aside from professor Black. She was always at school, as well, and <em> alone </em>.</p><p>But it was odd enough Riddle had relations with his previous student, having children together was probably awkward and farfetched.</p><p>Black was just scary sometimes. Raising her voice was no problem, neither was selectively picking on them. She publicly embarrassed Hermione multiple times. Hermione couldn't imagine being the daughter of either, let alone both. The thought made her laugh internally. How ridiculous, thinking of that.</p><p>Black sat on her desk and tapped on the wood with her long nails, tinted black.</p><p>“You enjoy Hogwarts?” Riddle asked.</p><p>Hermione nodded enthusiastically. How could she not?</p><p>“Do you enjoy to work here, Professor Riddle?”</p><p>“It has its perks,” Black looked up from studying her nails and snorted, “Well, it's definitely interesting. Teaching students.”</p><p>“You, Professor Black?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“Hogwarts is like a home to me. Of course, a noisy irritating one, always under the watch of the headmaster. It's not like I've <em> done </em> anything. For the most part. I wasn't a bad student. He's like a strict father who will allow <em> nothing </em> under his house.” She finished bitterly.</p><p><br/>
Hermione thought of Dumbledore scolding Professor Black as a student. She held in a laugh.</p>
