    <p>Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft</p><p>Library</p><p>December 10, 1994</p><p>Harry Potter groaned as he flopped down into his usual chair opposite his best friend Hermione Granger, he’d just left the Transfigurations classroom where his Head of House and Deputy Headmistress had informed him that he needed a date for the Yule Ball. He toyed briefly with the idea of asking Cho but quickly rejected it. Cho had been especially chummy with Cedric recently and while she was pretty, Harry really didn’t want to step into that wasp’s nest, particularly with Rita Skeeter buzzing around.</p><p>Harry was knocked out of his reverie by Hermione, who had tossed a ball of parchment at his head. “Uh, um, sorry, Hermione, I… I wasn’t listening,” He admitted sheepishly.</p><p>“I noticed; I was asking what Professor McGonagall wanted?”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry replied as a blush crept up his cheeks. “S-she told me that champions need to have a date for the ball.”</p><p>“Oh…” Hermione replied with a matching blush. “Are you going to ask Cho?”</p><p>Harry laughed, which confused the brunette witch. “What’s funny?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “I just imagined myself trying to ask Cho, I would probably get tongue-tied and have to ask three times before she finally figured out what I was saying. Besides, I think she’ll end up going with Cedric. They’ve been hanging out a lot lately.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you kept such close tabs on Cedric, maybe I’ve got it figured wrong, and you’re pining after Cedric,” Hermione teased.</p><p>Harry pointed his quill at Hermione with a grin on his face. “You, are a big meanie Hermione Granger,”</p><p>As Hermione poked her tongue out at him, Harry smirked. “I could definitely do worse than Cedric anyway.”</p><p>Hermione’s jaw dropped as Harry laughed, and she gave him a mock pout. “You’re teasing me.”</p><p>“Yup, but as Sirius says, don’t knock it till you’ve tried it.”</p><p>“Are you saying Sirius is…?”</p><p>“I think the term is, he swings both ways,” Harry explained. “He’s hinted at some of the stuff him, Dad, and Mum got up to but… I really don’t need to know.”</p><p>Hermione chuckled. “Welcome to the horror that is knowing your parents had sex, Harry.”</p><p>“Gee thanks…” Harry replied, drolly.</p><p>Hermione shook her head still giggling a little as they packed up to go to dinner. Harry considered Hermione carefully. “What do you think I should do?”</p><p>Hermione blinked. “Why are you asking me?”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Because you’re my best friend and you’re way smarter than me.”</p><p>Hermione paused at the door to the library. “I-I’m y-your, best friend?”</p><p>Harry turned around, slipping Hermione’s book bag off her shoulder and slinging it over his own. “Of course, you are, you’ve stuck by me through everything, you even believed me when I said I didn’t put my name in the Cup.”</p><p>“But Ron…”</p><p>“Ron is an insecure jerk. If he were really my best friend, he would have at least asked for an explanation, but no he just flew off the handle and assumed I was a cheating bastard. I took him back as a friend, but now I’m really regretting it. I shouldn’t priorities him over you like I did when you had my broom confiscated last year,” Harry held up his hand to cut Hermione off as he moved them from in front of the library doors. “I know you’ve apologised, and it’s ok, really, you were right in one sense. We didn’t know who sent it and we thought a mass-murdering psychopath was after me. We should have sat down and discussed it, but I had to side with Ron Bloody Weasley. Never again.”</p><p>Hermione had happy tears running down her face as she flung her arms around Harry. He smiled and winced, returning the hug. “Thank you, Harry,” She mumbled into his shoulder.</p><p>“Always,” He replied, offering Hermione his elbow. “Shall we?”</p><p>Hermione continued to smile as she slipped her arm around his. “We shall.”</p><p>Harry and Hermione walked arm in arm to the Great Hall, Harry smiled the entire way, but he could tell Hermione was mulling something over by the way she worried her bottom lip with her front teeth. When they arrived, he got a smile and a nod from the other three champions, Hermione frowned as she watched Harry give a nod towards Fleur Delacour. She knew Fleur was the girl of every guy from three schools’ fantasies, but it wasn’t every guy she worried about, it was Harry.</p><p>The two sat at the other end of the table from Ron and ate in silence. Harry tried to engage Hermione in conversation but only got monosyllabic answers in response. Eventually, he gave up and finished his meal. It was about the same time as Hermione finished hers so by silent agreement the two walked back up to Gryffindor Tower.</p><p>About halfway up, Hermione pulled on Harry’s arm, and he allowed her to lead him into a nearby classroom. He sat on one of the desks as Hermione stood in front of him, still worrying her bottom lip with her teeth. Hermione took a deep breath to calm herself and spoke. “I-I know this isn’t usually the way things are done but, oh damn it, Harry, would you go to the Yule Ball with me?”</p><p>Harry blinked and then blinked again, and then smiled. “I would love to go to the Yule Ball with you Hermione, I can’t think of anyone I’d like to go with more.”</p><p>Hermione squealed happily and wrapped Harry in a hug. She pulled back and considered Harry carefully. “You know that Ron will get into an almighty snit about this.”</p><p>“I know, and I don’t care,” Harry replied confidently.</p><p>Hermione smiled and tugged on Harry’s hand leading them out of the classroom and the rest of the way up to Gryffindor Tower, where an angry redhead was waiting on them. “Harry, mate, where the heck have you been?”</p><p>Harry blinked tugging Hermione by the hand to put himself between her and Ron. “I wasn’t aware that I needed to give you a running commentary on my day.”</p><p>“I’m not asking you to give me a bloody running commentary, I was just asking where you’ve been, I wanted to play Wizard’s chess with you after Transfiguration, but you disappeared after McGonagall kept you back.”</p><p>“It’s Professor McGonagall Ron, and I went to start on my homework with Hermione if you must know.”</p><p>Ron rolled his eyes. “Yeah, homework, that’s a good one mate, come on, tell me where you really were?”</p><p>Harry blinked, turning back to look at Hermione. “Did I stutter?”</p><p>Ron blinked, looking confused. “Mate, what’s with the attitude?”</p><p>Harry sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. “Well, Ron, you could have gone with Hermione and started on your homework, but you chose to skive off, same as always. While the entire school was pissed at me, again, for something I didn’t do, I found I enjoyed getting my homework done on time and getting praised by my teachers for the quality of work I submitted. I don’t know about you, but I have plans for my life once I finish school, I don’t plan on skating by on my name or inherited wealth, I’m not Malfoy. So, if you want to make something of yourself, you need to buckle down and get studying. OWL’s are less than two years away, and I plan on at least trying to compete with Hermione, I know I won’t win but I’ll give a damn good go. What about you?”</p><p>The entire Common room was now watching the exchange in rapt silence. Harry saw Ron’s eyes flicker, and he growled. “Don’t look at Hermione, she’s not your personal homework helper, and neither am I. If you can’t be serious about studying, you’d best leave us alone, got it?”</p><p>Harry walked away towards the couch Neville was sitting on as Ron rounded on Hermione. “This is all…!”</p><p>Ron stopped short when he found a wand in his face, Harry’s wand. “One more word Weasley and you’ll get to see how well I’ve picked up the Bat Boogy Hex from your little sister.”</p><p>Ron glared at him and then Hermione and stalked away. “Bloody barmy that girl, its always studying and reading, I bet she won’t even be able to find a date to the Ball.”</p><p>Harry paused as Hermione sat down, she gave him a nod and a smile, squeezing his hand. Neville grinned at this exchange. “Actually Weasley, Hermione has already found a date for the Yule Ball.”</p><p>Ron scoffed. “Pull the other one Potter.”</p><p>Harry sighed. “This is the second time today you’ve called me a liar in front of everyone, you seem to be making a habit of it.”</p><p>“Alright, go on then, who is Hermione taking to the ball, the Troll from first year, Peeves?” Ron jeeringly replied.</p><p>“Me.”</p><p>At this, Ron’s ears turned pink. “Y-you, you’re fucking barmy! You could have any girl in the castle, any girl from three bloody schools! And you’re going with Hermione, WHY?!”</p><p>“Because she asked, and I said yes,” Harry replied calmly.</p><p>“She asked, that’s not how it’s supposed to work! Girls aren’t supposed to ask guys out!”</p><p>“Why not?” Angelina, who was sitting next to Fred (or George) asked.</p><p>“B-because it’s just not how it works!” Ron blurted out.</p><p>“Just because that’s the way things have always been done doesn’t mean that’s the way they always have to be done,” Alicia replied from where she was sitting next to George (or Fred). She turned to her boyfriend and smiled. “George, would you do me the honour of accompanying me to the Yule Ball?”</p><p>“I would be delighted,” George replied with a big grin, Fred had a similarly big grin on his face seconds later when Angelina asked him.</p><p>As the rest of the house saw how much fun the Twins and their respective girlfriends were having pranking Ron, the girls of the house took it upon themselves to ask the boys they fancied to the ball. Hermione meanwhile snuggled into a blushing Harry. “I like this new you.”</p><p>Harry grinned sheepishly. “I-I like that you like the new me.”</p><p>“I like the new you too Harry, just without the whole cuddling part, I’ll leave that in Hermione’s capable hands,” Neville chipped in with a grin.</p><p>“I will happily accept the burden,” Hermione replied teasingly. “Would you like to join us to work on our homework?”</p><p>Neville shook his head. “Not right now, I’ve uh, got something important I need to do. But will you be here when I get back?”</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow. “Yeah, but, where are you off to Nev?”</p><p>Neville blushed. “I-I need to ask t-the girl I like t-to the ball.”</p><p>Harry smiled and slapped Neville on the arm. “Go get her tiger.”</p><p>“Oh, shut up…” Neville muttered as his face burned bright red.</p><p> </p><p>Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft</p><p>Great Hall</p><p>December 11, 1994</p><p>The next morning Harry, Hermione, and Neville sat together at the Gryffindor house table at the other end from Ron who was clearly being isolated by the rest of his house after the incident the previous night. Neville had a big grin on his face, in fact, he’d had a big grin on his face since he’d woken up that morning. Harry couldn’t help but chuckle. “All smiles today, Nev?”</p><p>“Hm, oh, yeah,” Neville replied absently.</p><p>“You must have been successful, we didn’t see you at all after you left the Common room last night,” Hermione observed.</p><p>“He didn’t get back until almost curfew. I heard him climbing into bed.”</p><p>“Scandalous,” Hermione replied mockingly.</p><p>“Lay off you two, can’t you just be happy for a guy?” Neville asked, sounding slightly annoyed.</p><p>“Peace Nev, we are happy, we’re just teasing.”</p><p>Neville let his shoulders drop a little. “I know, sorry, I just, I never thought she’d say yes, I mean, we’ve known each other since we were babies but… when she got sorted into…” Neville stopped a muttered the next part.</p><p>“Uh, Neville, I didn’t quite catch that,” Harry replied.</p><p>“S-she got sorted into Slytherin…” Neville mumbled.</p><p>“Did you think we’d be upset if you went with someone from Slytherin?” Harry asked to which Neville nodded. “Nev, it's not the house we dislike, its just Malfoy and his goons, as long as you didn’t ask say… Pansy, we’re fine.”</p><p>A look of relief washed over Neville as he smiled again. “Good, and no, definitely wasn’t Pansy, it was, uh, Daphne.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened. “Daphne Greengrass?”</p><p>“Wow, way to go, Nev, ow!” Harry replied to which he got a swift kick in the shin. “Hermione! I was just complimenting Neville on his superb choice of date. Now Neville and I won’t look out of place when we walk in with the two most beautiful girls in Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Just Hogwarts?” Hermione asked carefully.</p><p>“Well, since the Beauxbaton carriage and Drumstrung’s Ship are both within Hogwart’s grounds, yes all of Hogwarts,” Harry replied with a grin.</p><p>“Nice save,” Hermione replied, looking slightly tearful.</p><p>“I said it last night, there is no one I would rather go with than you,” Harry explained, wiping her tears away with his thumb.</p><p>“If you two are about to engage in some PDA’s can you tell me now, I haven’t had breakfast yet,” Neville interrupted and got a mocking glare from the pair.</p><p>Just then Ron swaggered up to their end of the table giving Hermione a terse look before turning his attention to Harry. “Hey Potter, watch how it’s done.”</p><p>“How what is done?” Harry asked, annoyed at having his breakfast disrupted by his former friend.</p><p>“I’m going to show you how a real man asks a girl to the Yule Ball, in a few minutes the hottest bird in all of Hogwarts will be on my arm for the Yule Ball.”</p><p>The three watched as he strolled away towards the Ravenclaw table, Neville leaned in. “Was that Ron Weasley or Draco Malfoy?”</p><p>“Hard to tell…” Harry replied.</p><p>Hermione groaned and buried her face in her hands. “Oh Merlin, he’s going to ask Fleur Delacour…”</p><p>“Breakfast and a show,” Harry commented, earning another kick in the shin by Hermione.</p><p>Ron sauntered up the Ravenclaw table to where Fleur, Cho, and Marietta Edgecombe were sitting, he leered down at Fleur as she stared back, unfazed. “Yes, can I help you?”</p><p>Ron’s face went suddenly slack as he was hit with a dose of Fleur’s allure. Harry sighed, watching in amusement as Ginny ran over to pull her brother away as she apologised for his behaviour. Harry and Neville laughed along with the rest of Hogwarts. Hermione just shook her head but was unable to hide the grin on her face as the two Weasley’s left the Great Hall.</p><p> </p><p>Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft</p><p>Entrance Hall</p><p>December 25, 1994</p><p>Harry and Neville stood at the bottom of the stairs waiting for their dates, Harry tugged on his black dress robes for the umpteenth time, trying anything he could think of to work off the nervous energy. Neville, also for the umpteenth time, slapped Harry’s hands away. “Harry, relax, you’ll do great.”</p><p>“What if I don’t though Nev, what if I ruin this and embarrass Hermione?”</p><p>“But you won’t,” Neville glanced up behind him and smiled. “I think your date has arrived.”</p><p>Harry turned around, and his world stopped, Hermione walked down the stairs with a dazzling smile and in a Periwinkle Blue Dress that was pulled in at the waist. Her usually bushy hair was straight and pulled back into a knot. She stopped in front of Harry and blushed. “S-say something.”</p><p>Neville gave Harry an elbow in the ribs which re-started his brain. “Y-you look amazing.”</p><p>“So, do you.”</p><p>“Oh, there’s my date,” Neville observed with a grin as the blonde Slytherin clad in an emerald green dress with a silver lining, and a slit up the thigh glided down the stairs towards Neville. He took her hand and bowed, brushing his lips across her knuckles. “Thank you for doing me the honour of being your date tonight, my lady.”</p><p>“The honour is mine Heir Longbottom,” Daphne replied.</p><p>“Wow,” Hermione breathed as Harry raised an eyebrow, she just grinned. “I’m allowed to find other girls attractive.”</p><p>Harry grinned in return. “Never said you weren’t.”</p><p>The two approached Neville and Daphne as she hooked her arm with his. “Hermione, you look amazing tonight.”</p><p>Hermione smiled and blushed at the compliment. “So do you, Daphne.”</p><p>“I’m all for ditching the ball and watching you two make out…” Harry commented, earning himself a sharp elbow in the ribs.</p><p>“Forgive my date, he can be a big idiot,” Hermione explained.</p><p>“I’ve noticed, Dragon’s, Basilisks, he does have a habit of displaying his Gryffindor courage at inopportune times.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Don’t remind me…”</p><p>Before Harry could summon a retort, Professor McGonagall stepped out into the Entrance Hall. “Can the Champion’s and your partners please line up in front of me.”</p><p>The two bid Daphne and Neville farewell and followed the orders of their Head of House. They lined up last, just ahead of Victor Krum and Draco Malfoy. Harry had heard the rumours, but he’d dismissed them as the usual Hogwarts idle gossip. Malfoy glared back at them. “Something to say, Potter?”</p><p>“Nope, as long as you don’t insult me or my date, I won’t insult you or yours.”</p><p>Malfoy nodded. “I can accept that compromise.”</p><p>“I am surprised though,” Harry commented as Fleur and Roger Davies were announced. “I thought you would have gone to the ball with Pansy.”</p><p>Malfoy frowned. “We’re, just good friends.”</p><p>“Ok.”</p><p>Malfoy raised an eyebrow as Cedric and Cho were announced next. “That’s it?”</p><p>“That’s it, it doesn’t matter who you love Draco, as long as they make you happy.”</p><p>Malfoy nodded silently and turned his head forward as McGonagall announced him and Victor. Hermione smiled, patting Harry on the arm. “What?”</p><p>“You’re a good man, Harry Potter.”</p><p>“Now Introducing the Fourth Champion, representing Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft, Harry James Potter and his partner Hermione Jean Granger!”</p><p>Harry and Hermione entered to polite applause, Harry’s eyes swept the room and found Neville and Daphne sitting beside Daphne’s best friend Tracy Davis and her date for the evening Blaise Zabini. Pansy Parkinson was wedged between Malfoy’s two gorillas, and Harry was pleased to note that after his antics in the Common Room and the dismal failure the next morning, Ron had been unable to secure a date. Not even Ginny wanted to be seen with the git after that. Harry led Hermione around to the head table where he sat beside Cedric who had Cho on his other side. He gave the pair a polite bow after helping Hermione to her seat.</p><p>“I think we’re two of the luckiest wizards in Hogwarts tonight,” Cedric offered holding his Butterbeer out.</p><p>Harry smiled and clanked his glass with Cedric’s. “I can toast to that.”</p><p>Hermione and Cho looked past their dates and gave each other an exasperated smile. The four were enjoying their meal when something caught Harry’s eye, looking down the table Harry watched as Headmaster Dumbledore engaged in a heated discussion with a toad faced woman in a pink cardigan.</p><p>“So, you’ve noticed our guest…” Cedric observed.</p><p>“Guest?”</p><p>A sour expression crossed Cedric’s face. “The woman talking to the Headmaster is Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, Delores Umbridge. She’s here representing the Ministry in place of Mister Crouch who has been ill since before the first task.”</p><p>“I thought Percy was representing the Ministry?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“Apparently, he’s not senior enough for the Minister’s liking, at least that’s what my Dad said when he Owled me about Umbridge.”</p><p>“That bad?” Harry asked.</p><p>“She’s a menace, a horrid bullying toad faced woman. My father has to deal with her if he wants to see the Minister and she always gives him the run around because he’s not our sort of Wizard.” Cho explained. “She forgets that the Chang’s can trace their heritage back to the building of the Great Wall.”</p><p>Cedric laid a hand over Cho’s. “Sorry, Cho’s father is in the Potion import business, Umbridge and like-minded individuals have been putting the squeeze on his business for a while.”</p><p>“Because he’s not a British pureblood?” Hermione guessed.</p><p>Cho nodded. “That horrible woman will destroy this country.”</p><p>“We’ll fix it, Cho, I promise,” Cedric replied soothingly.</p><p>Harry gave Hermione a meaningful look, and she nodded. “May I have this dance, Miss Granger?”</p><p>“That sounds lovely Mister Potter.”</p><p>Cedric gave them a smile as they walked away to the dance floor. The band had started a slow song which allowed Hermione to rest her head on Harry’s chest and for them to just sway gently to the music. “I’m so glad I came to the ball with you, Harry.”</p><p>Harry smiled down at his date. “I feel the same.”</p><p>The night rolled on with Harry and Hermione taking many dances together, sometimes swapping partners. Harry got to dance with Cho, Fleur, Daphne, Lavender, Parvati, and even, awkwardly, Draco before the night was over.</p><p>Finally, the evening was at an end, and Harry and Hermione found themselves the last two standing at the bottom of the stairs to their respective dorms. The two stood, holding hands, smiling at each other. Harry eventually let go, rubbing the back of his head. “I had a wonderful time tonight Hermione.”</p><p>“So did I.”</p><p>“So, uh…” Harry stuttered as his blush intensified. “I’m thrilled we went to the ball together, and I was hoping…”</p><p>“So am I, I’m glad we went as friends,” Hermione replied, talking over the end of his sentence.</p><p>Harry paused for a beat and then his face fell, his hands falling limply. “A-as friends…”</p><p>“Yeah, just friends.” Hermione re-affirmed.</p><p>“Just friends, that’s all we’ll ever be, right?” Harry asked, coldly his hands curling into fists.</p><p>“Yep,” Hermione replied cheerfully.</p><p>“Goodnight, Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione tried to reply, but Harry ignored her as he stomped up the stairs. He didn’t even strip out of his robes when he got up to his dorm, instead falling face first into his bed. Pulling the privacy screen up around it, he began to sob into his pillow. Hermione’s words repeated on a cycle in his head.</p><p>“Just friends, I was ready to give you my heart, and all you want is to be, just friends…”</p><p>To Be Continued…</p>
