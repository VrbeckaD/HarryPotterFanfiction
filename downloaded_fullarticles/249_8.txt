    <p>“Come back to bed.” Ash’s voice was muffled by the pillow he had shoved his face into at some point during the night, but the familiar lyrical tones made Harry shiver where he stood at the side of their bed. The light that was leaking in through the gauzy white curtains hinted that it was closer to noon than it was morning, but the elf seemed content to lounge for the next year… or century. Not that Harry doubted that he would; time didn’t hold the same power over Ash as it did him. The elf had once said that he had slept through the entire settling of the New World only to wake up in time for the second (third?) French revolution.</p>
<p>“Some of us have a job to go to,” Harry laughed. Sure, his job was as a cashier at the twin’s joke shop - and they had been pushing for him to take a day off since the damn place had opened - but Harry had never had the luxury of doing nothing. The lingering touch of the war and echoes of the Dursleys made him far too anxious to stay still long. </p>
<p>In one fluid motion, Ash had sat up in bed and snatched Harry around the waist, easily tugging the wizard back into bed and pinning him under his larger body. Harry yelped, hands straining uselessly against the iron grip around his wrists, and glared up into playful silver eyes. “Your trouble makers will last a day without you, dearest. I will perish from loneliness.” Ash let his weight (lighter than any six foot Man but still enough to press Harry into the mattress below him) rest on him in a dramatic swoon. </p>
<p>A huff was pushed from Harry at the sudden weight, but there was a smile on his face even as he half-heartedly attempted to squirm his way free. “You were without me for two million years,” He teased.</p>
<p>Ash huffed as he always did when Harry over exaggerated his age, and dipped his head down to nip at the wizard’s shoulder in retaliation, drawing another yelp from the boy. Ash loved to mark his little wizard from the moment he had stumbled on the sixteen-year-old wizard wandering the Forbidden Forest in grief for his Godfather. The playful nip to his wrist had drawn Harry from his grief better than any of his friends had managed, and Harry had found himself coming back the next day, and the next, until Ash had finally sent a beautiful owl to formally request to court him. They bonded on Harry’s seventeenth birthday, only to be driven apart the next day when Death Eaters attacked Bill and Fluer’s own wedding. </p>
<p>It had been Ash that saved Fred from a killing curse, and Ash who had fired the arrow that killed the man had Remus cornered. It was Ash who had called upon the magic of the Forest itself when he saw Harry’s limp body carried by Hagrid. </p>
<p>The scream that had left his husband as that magic tore through him still haunted Harry’s dreams, just as he had been woken many nights by Ash’s arms clutching him tightly to his shaking chest. </p>
<p>All of his resistance slipped away, and this time when Harry tugged at the grip Ash had on his wrists the elf allowed him to move, letting him cup the elf’s face and draw him down into a kiss. When they pulled back, Harry wandlessly summoned his patronus to tell the twins that he would not be coming in. He got back a hyena and coyote both only saying “Fucking finally.”</p>
<p>Ash chuckled low in his chest and leaned down to press another kiss to Harry’s lips. The wizard squirmed after a few moments, knowing that Ash would spend hours simply kiss him if Harry allowed it. </p>
<p>“I thought you were planning on going back to sleep?” Harry asked with a giggle when Ash finally released his lips to nip down his throat. </p>
<p>“There are better things to do to you in my bed,” Ash growled with a smirk and sunk his teeth into the skin where Harry’s neck met his shoulder, drawing a sweet whine from the boy. </p>
<p>A simple wandless spell had them both naked (Harry having learned long ago that when his husband was riled it was either that or Ash would tear the clothes from both of them, something that was far less sexy now that he was tearing silk and leather instead of Dudley’s hand-me-downs) and both of them hissed at the sudden overwhelming feeling of skin on skin. </p>
<p>Harry was so lost in the sensation he didn’t even realize Ash had moved for the vial of oil on their bedside table until slick fingers were probing at his hole, slipping in with no resistance. A sweet keen slipped from his lips as he pressed back into the finger. Ash often would see just how many times he could get his little husband to cum from his fingers alone, if only so he could watch the glazed over look those emerald eyes took when he was three fingers deep inside him. Now however he was too impatient to draw it out longer, and he rushed as much as he dared in stretching his lover.</p>
<p>Then he was pushing his cock into Harry and they were both gasping, clinging to each other as they adjusted. When Harry squirmed against him, Ash’s hands fell to his hips gripping tight enough to bruise. The elf set a slow pace, drawing out every whimper and groan until Harry was sobbing as he spilled over their chests. Ash followed only a few thrusts later with a long groan of pure male satisfaction. </p>
<p>When Ash collapsed onto the bed next to him and wrapped an arm around Harry, the wizard had to agree that a day in bed wasn’t all that bad.</p>
