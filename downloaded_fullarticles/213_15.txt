    <p>Hermione glanced out of the fogged-up window of the Hogwarts Express, just about discerning the mountains of Scotland in the distance.</p><p>It was strange to go back.</p><p>After the battle she had so many misgivings about returning, but at the same time something inside her balked at the idea of not finishing her education.</p><p>Pushing a soft brown curl out of her eyes, she thought about the past year.</p><p>Obviously Ron and Harry had been just as traumatized as her; dealing with their losses and trying to make sense of the fact that it was now supposed to be over.</p><p>The end of the war had also meant the end of her romance with Ron: while she had yearned after him for years, she had quickly realized that the war had turned them into very different people. Not in a necessarily bad way, but they would never work as a couple.</p><p>It would also give her a year of freedom, rather than pining for a boyfriend who was off Merlin knew where.</p><p>Harry and Ron, with the help of Kingsley, were able to start the Auror training program straight away, without sitting for their N.E.W.T.s.</p><p>While Hermione had options as well to progress into professional training, she had wanted to finish her seventh year at Hogwarts. Maybe, she thought, this was the year she could actually try and be a normal teenager.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The arrival at school had felt strange yet comforting, although most students had seemed so terribly young that Hermione felt very out of place at the beginning.</p><p>However, after the feast - which was now opened by McGonagall - the trudge to the tower with Ginny, and the first morning of classes, Hermione felt herself slipping back into a semblance of normalcy.</p><p>As Hermione now shared her classes and a dorm with Ginny, there was a lot less of elbow-nudging than there had been with Ron and Harry.</p><p>Unfortunately, the amount of talk about Quidditch remained about the same, now Ginny was Captain of the team.</p><p>Thursday brought as pleasant surprise, as they strolled towards the paddocks next to what used to be Hagrid's house.</p><p>Hagrid was currently taking a year out to be closer to Mme. Maxime at Beauxbattons, leaving the position vacant for a professor for the Care of Magical Creatures.</p><p>The table at the feast had not given Hermione a clue who was to take up the position, as the war had meant the number of teachers were decimated, there were several gaps at the head table.</p><p>As Ginny and Hermione arrived at Hagrid’s hut, Hermione was surprised and pleased to see a shock of Weasley red hair.</p><p>Ginny gave a squeal of delight as she ran towards Charlie, who turned around at the sound and caught his sister to hug her.</p><p>"What are you doing here? Why didn't you tell me you were going to teach this year?!" Ginny asked, her smile quickly slipping into a frown, demonstrating the suddenness of the Weasly temper.</p><p>"I didn't know. I was trying to get a job closer to home, you know, to help mum and dad. But I hadn't found anything until McGonagall owled me on Saturday. She asked if I would be interested in teaching this year, as they hadn't been able to find a good replacement for Hagrid. So here I am!"</p><p>Looking at Charlie’s face, Hermione felt a quiver of butterflies in her stomach.</p><p>She’d had a good summer at the Burrow, spending time with all the Weasleys, even if it was tinged with grief and sadness.</p><p>But she’d been mostly surprised by her connection with Charlie during this time.</p><p>Having only met briefly during the Triward Tournament, the summer was the first time Hermione had ever actually spent time spent time with the second eldest Weasley. She was rewarded with a highly intelligent, kind and fun person who was keen to talk to her.</p><p>They had both talked about their losses: Charlie’s loss of his brother, Hermione’s trauma of the months of searching, the violent events at Malfoy manor and the quest to repatriate Hermione’s parents from Australia.</p><p>This had proved much, much more difficult than she’d initially thought.</p><p>Due to the turmoils of Britain’s wizarding world, the Ministry had restricted diplomatic actions such as the ones needed to bring Hermione’s family home. Connections had been made with Australia’s government. They had managed to track them down and were now working on a plan to reinstate their memory, but this was all a long-term process.</p><p>Hermione was told it would be at least a year before she would see them again. Seeing no alternative, she had accepted this, albeit with a deep sadness.</p><p>Charlie had helped her a lot in dealing with this blow. Not only had all of the Weasley’s made her feel like she still had family surrounding her, but Charlie wasn’t afraid to talk to her about it. Or anything else for that matter.</p><p>She even told him about the torture she had endured at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir and the nightmares that still haunted her of that night. Hermione had noticed herself growing attached and rather attracted to the second-oldest Weasley.</p><p>His copper hair was now a mane that rivalled Bill’s, although his shorter stature gave him less lanky and more imposing demeanor than his brother. His broad and well-muscled shoulders made his t-shirts bulge and his arms were covered in magical tattoos of dragons, a phoenix and various other magical creatures.</p><p>Near the end of the summer, Hermione had found herself increasingly drawn to these tattoos, overcome by the wish to touch the skin that they resided in.</p><p>It had taken all her restraint during their conversations to keep her hands to herself, sometimes so much so that she was distracted from their conversations. In the end, Charlie had figured out what caused the distraction.</p><p>After laughing that booming laugh for a good few minutes, had taken her small hands and guided her slim hands along his tattoos, explaining what each meant to him. Hermione had been breathless by the end of the exercise and blushed a Quaffle-red when he quipped that the tattoos she wasn’t seeing were quite spectacular too.</p><p>Yet for all his jokes, talks and attention to her, Hermione was convinced that her attraction was a one-sided thing, a school-girl crush on a friend’s big brother.</p><p>She chided herself each time she’d looked at him a little too long, or had thought of him when she was lying in bed, unable to sleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But now he was here. Charlie, a shock of tattoos, muscle and red hair, dressed not in teaching robes, but in a dress shirt with rolled-up sleeves that accentuated his muscles and had some of his tattoos peeking out underneath.</p><p>He actually looked every inch the professor, a thought that made Hermione's insides clench.</p><p>Luckily the rest of the class arrived at that moment, so after a quick hug hello Hermione was prevented from having to say or do anything.</p><p>It proved to be a great lesson. Charlie had warded a piece of the forest and had them find a number of magical creatures by the clues left of their habitation. Her time during the summer had already given Hermione the idea that Charlie would actually make a great teacher, as he was patient and could make a joke out of anything.</p><p>Unfortunately, he also proved to be quite distracting, as her thoughts wandered off whenever she reveled in some part of his body exposed to her.</p><p>“Hermione?” Ginny waved her hand in front of Hermione’s eyes, which had glazed over while she was staring at her drawing of a Knarl. She had just been thinking about that one tattoo on his right bicep, the one that had its tail curved towards his broad back. This had led her to wondering about what Charlie would look like without a shirt on. </p><p>“Are you okay?” the younger witch asked, with a concerned look at her friend. Hermione shook her head to clear her thoughts.</p><p>“Uhm, yes, sorry. I was just… thinking.”</p><p>Ginny arched an eyebrow. “You always pay attention in classes, Hermione. What's up? Is something bothering you?” She looked concerned.</p><p>“Are your nightmares bothering you again?”</p><p>“Oh no, no. Nothing like that. I was just ehm, distracted for a bit.”</p><p>“Well, we can’t have that, Miss Granger” said a deep voice, just behind Ginny and Hermione.</p><p>Charlie walked around their table, his eyes crinkled into a smile. He looked comfortable supervisor the students, exuding an easy nonchalance and authority. </p><p>“How can the brilliant Hermione Granger be distracted when she’s got one of Britain’s most eligible dragon-keeper as her professor?” He was grinning broadly at her. </p><p>Hermione couldn't help herself and snorted a laugh. “Right. Sorry, professor. I should have known. I’ll be on my knees to worship you the next time I’m in your class.”</p><p>The joke was out before she realized what she said. </p><p>She turned red as a Quaffle as Ginny started sniggering and Charlie burst out laughing in his boisterous laugh.</p><p>“Sassy witch! Hmmm, I should actually take some house points for that, you know.”</p><p>Charlie narrowed his eyes at her, a small smirk playing on his lips.</p><p> Now, at the threat of losing points, Hermione spluttered “You wouldn’t…”</p><p>“Don’t worry that smart head of yours, Granger. I’ll give you a chance to make it up at some point.” Charlie smirked and winked at Hermione.</p><p>She was now possibly even redder.</p><p>He left their table to supervise the other students, still chuckling, while Ginny was giggling uncontrollably and Hermione was still muttering indignantly.</p><p>“I think I know what was distracting you, ‘Mione’” Ginny teased her blushing friend, as Hermione quickly busied herself with their Knarl again.</p><p>“It’s not like that, Ginny” Hermione said, shrugging off the comment.</p><p>Then the younger witch looked at her sceptically, a smirk playing on her lips. “I thought you guys were spending a lot of time together this summer…”</p><p>“We are just friends. Your brother is actually a really good listener." She huffed. "Even if he's an insufferable prat" she added, still a little indignant.</p><p>Ginny snorted, but still seemed unconvinced and was still looking at Hermione, her head cocked. </p><p>"I guess I’m just overwhelmed with being back is all” Hermione lied, staring at the castle behind them.</p><p>Still a little unconvinced, Ginny said primly, “Well, for what it’s worth, I think you’d make a good couple” and turned back to their Knarl.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Charlie suppressed the urge to smirk outright as he walked away.</p><p>Hermione was always quick to react when she felt wronged and he loved getting her roused. He actually liked that a lot about her.</p><p>Other girls were always so occupied with how they came across. Hermione was much more interested in a good debate or an interesting talk.</p><p>He had been very impressed at the witch’s mind this summer as he got to know her.</p><p>Her physique certainly had not escaped his attention, either. When learning from Ginny that the ‘thing’ between Ron and Hermione had really been over before it began, he’d been very happy, surprising himself with the attraction he felt to her.</p><p>However, the owl from McGonagall had put paid to any blossoming feelings. He was her professor now and there was no way he'd be breaking the rules regarding professor/student relationships.</p><p>It did not, however, prevent him from wanting to see this gorgeous girl flustered, as the blush that crept over her breasts when she was embarrassed was quite spectacular. And as a natural flirt, this made it very appealing for him to tease her at every possible instance.</p><p>Standing at the other side of the paddock with some other students, he glanced at the spot where Hermione and Ginny were working with the little Knarl.</p><p>At 19 she was now a little older than the other students in her year, but her maturity had always set her apart from her peers anyway. In this final year, that would only help her with her exams. He just hoped that she didn’t forget to have a little fun.  </p>
