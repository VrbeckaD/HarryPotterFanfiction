    <h3>1</h3><p>Her hands caressed the pages as she read, a familiar, practiced movement over the worn tome. Every once in a while she would shift slightly and brush wispy tendrils of hair away from her face where they threatened to come between her eyes and the text. In the few months the library had been open Hermione had already chosen a favorite alcove and spent hours there every day. The librarians all knew her by name and shooed others away from the area when they saw her approaching the library door. If Hermione noticed that her spot was always open for her even on the most crowded days she made no sign of it. Her celebrity embarrassed her and the staff loved her all the more for her humility.</p><p>Draco had his own alcove. As the founder of the library, he allowed himself this small indulgence in his gift to the wizarding community. It was not sumptuous or decadent, but rather a private place to both work and relax. This space was guarded by more than librarians, however. Taking cues from the architecture of Hogwarts and from the baroque churches he’d visited with his parents in their travels, Draco designed his own personal space to be a stone alcove set into the wall that could only be reached through a hidden door. He could see and be seen as any other patron, but he would mostly be left alone.</p><p>When he first saw her enter the library he had been in this alcove. She had arrived for the grand opening with throngs of witches and wizards excited about this new addition to Diagon Alley, and had toured the building with a wonder in her eyes that made him swell with pride. His involvement in the library’s foundation had been all over the papers and still she came. With fascination he watched as she recovered from her initial awe and began scouting for the perfect place to sit. It took all his willpower to turn his attention away from her to instead allow himself to revel in the overwhelmingly positive response to his library.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Lucius and Narcissa had been pleased, but fear made them skeptical of their son’s plans. Even ten years after the Battle of Hogwarts they had not managed to fully recover their position in society and they worried about Draco putting himself in the line of fire of critics. They had tried to garner good faith by contributing to the restoration of Hogwarts and inviting the press to the Malfoy Manor to share the changes they were making to cleanse their home of dark magic and the influence of the Dark Lord, but no one was interested in listening to them. Their efforts managed to keep them out of Azkaban, but the damage was done and they had been socially cast out. Lucius and Narcissa had waited until their remodeling projects were complete before retiring to the seaside in France where they planned to live out their days in peace. Draco took over Malfoy Manor and the family’s finances with his parents’ trust and support, their hope that he would forge a better future for himself than what they had made for him through their mistakes guiding him forward.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The scratching of Hermione’s quill on a long roll of parchment was the only sound in the library. It was close to closing time and most of the wizarding community was out enjoying their Friday evening. Draco couldn’t tell if she had lost track of time or was simply disinterested in joining up with friends at a pub like everyone else. On late nights like these he fantasized about maybe going over and talking with her, but he could never bring himself to interrupt her focus. Since that first day he’d managed to convince himself that he was just grateful to her for accepting what he was trying to offer the community. His friends could give him all the knowing looks they wanted, but he ignored their insinuations.</p><p>“Hey mate, you coming out tonight?” Blaise had appeared in his alcove and the hand he clapped on Draco’s back pulled him sharply back to reality. Whatever grumpy remark he was about to make to his friend died on his lips as he realized what Blaise was wearing. “Come on, Draco! We’re doing muggle London tonight! Theo’s waiting outside.”</p><p>“What <em> is </em> that?” Blaise looked ridiculous and Draco’s eyes danced with amusement. Blaise did a funny kind of pirouette so Draco could get a good look at him.</p><p>“It’s a vest. Muggles wear them all the time. I’ve got one for you too.” Blaise tossed the vest to Draco who caught it deftly, and warily started putting it on as he was led out of the alcove. Their conversation had caught Hermione’s attention and there was a moment when Draco could have sworn they made eye contact. He desperately hoped he looked graceful and debonair, but doubted that he did. He wished he hadn’t let Blaise coerce him into the strange clothes until he was out of her sight, but had little time to worry about it as Blaise maneuvered him out of the library. He casually tried to look her way again, but she was focused on her parchment and did not acknowledge his departure.</p><p>Theodore Nott was waiting outside and his face broke out into a ridiculous smile when he saw Draco emerge wearing the vest. Draco raised a questioning eyebrow that made Theo laugh. He pulled a flask from the pocket of his own vest and offered it to Draco and Blaise who took turns taking swigs while Theo outlined the evening’s plans to go out and ask for numbers from muggle women. Blaise couldn’t understand what the numbers were for and Theo started to explain before Draco put a hand up to stop him.</p><p>“Just show us, Theo. No reason to stand here talking about it.” Theo saluted and they followed him through the busy London streets to an elegant cocktail lounge with no name on the door. A waitress greeted them and led them to a low table surrounded by comfortable chairs where she left them with menus and a promise to return shortly to take their order.</p><p>The names of the drinks and their ingredients were foreign to Draco. Theo and Blaise read every word they didn’t understand as if it was a private joke and Draco began to suspect from their giggling that they had been taking pulls from the flask long before they got him out of the library. When the waitress returned Blaise ordered the first drink on the menu and Theo leaned in and asked her to surprise him. A smile played at the corner of her mouth and Draco sat up a little straighter and politely asked for the <em> Chataeu Delacour </em>, a familiar red wine he was a more than a little relieved to see on a muggle menu.</p><p>“Lighten up, mate! We’re here to have fun.” Blaise leaned back and spread his arms over the back of the seat, his relaxed pose in stark contrast to Draco’s rigid discomfort. Theo put a comforting hand on Draco’s shoulder.</p><p>“No one is going to recognize you here. It’s okay.” He gave Draco’s shoulder a squeeze and Draco relaxed a fraction. Maybe his friends were right. He’d been on edge since the library opened, constant anxiety about public perception coloring his thoughts and behavior for months. He supposed he could allow himself a little celebration.</p><p>Drinks arrived and Draco allowed himself to sink into the comfort of the chair with his glass of wine. Theo and Blaise made him try their drinks, explaining it was part of the adventure to try new things. He had to admit they weren’t half bad and was persuaded to try something more “festive,” as Theo put it, for his next drink.</p><p>Blaise told them stories about his work in the legal branch of the Ministry, Theo complained about the lack of attractive witches at Gringotts - “it isn’t all goblins. There are other cursebreakers but they’re all blokes!” - and Draco sat back and allowed the normalcy of it all to wash over him. How long had it been since they had gone out like this? Years? Maybe it was the fine wine and whatever the other two festive cocktails were that Theo had ordered for him, but Draco was feeling warm and happy for the first time in a long time.</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco swirled the ice in his glass lazily with his pinky, sighing as he gazed into it. Theo and Blaise shared a look which, had Draco been paying attention, he would have found suspicious. Both moved in a little closer to him, effectively sandwiching him into his seat and preventing his escape. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mate, are you going to tell us what’s going on? You’ve been a tense mess and you never leave that accursed library. Everyone likes it! Now is the perfect time to get out of that stuffy corner and live your life.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s true,” Theo added with a little more kindness in his tone, “tonight you’re going to find yourself some gorgeous girl and shag her senseless. There’s a brunette at the end of the bar there who’s been watching you all night. Go ask for her number.” Draco lifted his gaze hopefully to see the girl. She made eye contact and smiled, but he couldn’t bring himself to smile back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not her. She would never notice me.” His friends exchanged another look and Blaise shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you talking about, you daft idiot? She’s looking at you now and batting her eyes. All you have to do is walk over there. Theo, do you think our friend here is pining over some witch?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean some other witch who isn’t doing the noticing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or maybe the poor bloke’s had too much to drink.” Draco sighed deeply at his now empty glass while Theo and Blaise got the bill. “He definitely had too much to drink,” Blaise said after looking over the itemized receipt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The plan was get Draco drunk and make sure he doesn’t go home alone, not get Draco so drunk he </span>
  <em>
    <span>can’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> get home on his own. We should have been much more specific in our plan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Theo, I’m fine. Blaise, don’t you worry about me either okay,” Draco slurred. “You guys said get a number, right? All I have to do is ask for a number. She can pick one. I don’t get it, but that’s why we came out yeah?” Draco stood and steadied himself. Even inebriated he succeeded in gliding gracefully across the room to ask the girl for a number. Theo and Blaise stared open-mouthed as he came back with a cocktail napkin and waved it in front of them. “I asked for one number and she gave me nine! And told me to use them! Mission accomplished, boys! Let’s go dancing!” He threw down a handful of galleons which Theo quickly swept up and replaced with a generous amount of muggle money. Theo managed to turn and wink at their waitress who smiled back before he followed Draco and Blaise back out into the street. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All right, you drunk idiot, where to?” Draco had managed to escape Blaise’s attempts to help him out the door and was skipping ahead of them with the insane joy and energy only an entire night of drinking could induce. Draco was distracted by a small group of people walking past. They were talking and laughing and Blaise and Theo didn’t realize why they seemed so oddly familiar until it was too late.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bit late to be out and about, isn’t it Mr. Malfoy?” Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny stood together in the soft glow of the streetlamp above. Ron and Ginny were standing behind Harry and all three clearly had their hands on their wands under their jackets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just out for a summery evening stroll here, same as you,” Blaise tried to pull Draco back. He had become a little more physically subdued, but there was mischief in his eyes that did not bode well for a late night encounter with four very sober witches and wizards looking at him with hatred. Theo and Blaise held Draco between them and slipped his wand out from his pocket so he couldn’t get himself into trouble. Harry and Ron noticed and relaxed a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he okay?” With Draco disarmed and trapped between his friends, Hermione stepped forward and concern tinged her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Worried about me, Miss Granger?” Draco asked softly. Theo and Blaise gripped him tighter and tried to turn him around to walk away, but they struggled to move him as he seemed to have rooted himself to where he stood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco here had a few too many drinks and we’re just getting him home,” Blaise said apologetically. Draco opened his mouth to say something more to Hermione, but Blaise elbowed him in the ribs. Caught by surprise, the words died on his lips. “Time to go, old chap!” Blaise ignored the fire in Draco’s eyes at his interruption and together with Theo dragged Draco away from danger. Ginny still looked ready to hex them and Blaise didn’t trust Draco not to say or do something stupid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the walk back to Draco’s nearby flat was quiet and uneventful. Theo and Blaise tried to wheedle some kind of explanation out of him, but Draco didn’t seem to hear them. He just looked thoughtful and sad as they carried up up the stairs and landed him safely onto his couch. Theo brought him a blanket and a pillow and Blaise made sure he knew there was a glass of water on the table for him. Draco could hear their concerned voices talking over him before they eventually left and he drifted off into a dreamless sleep. </span>
