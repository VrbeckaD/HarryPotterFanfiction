  <em>The shard of glass on Potter’s hand trails lazily across his wrist. Drags along the vein. It doesn’t bleed, doesn’t even break the skin. He brings it to a stop, right below the start of his hand. Anticipation hangs in the air. He removes it from his arm. Brings it to his knee instead. Cuts.  his hand shakes. He doesn't want to do it again. But he -has- to. So he does it again, trying to ignore the feeling of glass slipping beneath his skin. He doesn’t enjoy the pain, he isn’t doing this as a punishment. He’s doing it so the rest of him matches his forehead, his branding: stupid red scars. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco sits at the end of the slytherin table in the great hall, against the wall. He’s always been a striking boy-high cheekbones, silver eyes. He tries to stay out of plain view, if only so he can keep to himself. Draco malfoy likes to be on his own, and though he is generally liked by the slytherins, and he knows almost all of them well enough to say hello to them in the halls, he doesn’t exactly have friends. There’s no one that would visit him over the summer, the Malfoy name seems to give off a rather bad vibe. He butters his toast, looking over the great hall. Draco eats breakfast earlier than most in the castle are even awake. He finds that if he stays later than everyone else, he’s even more noticeable than when he eats at the normal time. </p><p> </p><p>He opens his book and crosses a leg under the other. But he can’t seem to focus. Hi s eyes skim over the other students, resting on a boy with rumpled black hair and round glasses. Draco waves at Harry Potter, but the other boy doesn’t catch his eye. Only bites his lip and turns back to his friends. A wave of disappointment cats itself across Draco. Harry’s never seemed to like Draco. He has always had a problem with judging people. He’s always pointing out bad things about others-though he would never speak them aloud. His mother tells him not to be so negative. His father tells him to keep it inside his own head. But he can’t seem to think up one single bad thing about Harry Potter. Even his scar is beautiful. Even though Draco has a curling dark mark on his wrist, and even though Harry Potter should be his enemy, draco can’t keep his thoughts away.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s his problem?” asks Crabbe as he and goyle collapse next to Draco on the bench.<br/>
He sighs inwardly. He doesn’t exactly dislike the two blubbering idiots, he just...doesn’t exactly have any interest in becoming closer friends than they already are. </p><p>“Who knows.”</p><p>After a while though, they turn to Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson in favor of laughing at a gryffindor first year, who was tripping on a loose stone and dropping his bag. He sighs again and looks up just in time to see harry leaving the hall. </p><p>Draco doesn’t know why he does it. But he stands up, muttering something about needing to get his books before potions. He feels as if something is tugging him out, plugging him to the lightning scar boy.</p><p>Slipping through the corridors far enough behind Harry that he wouldn’t notice, but close enough that Draco can see him. The raven haired boy is nearly skipping-something that is rarely seen by others-spinning a bit every now and then. Draco is beginning to wonder if he should just turn back-the clattering of silverware and laughter fading away. Suddenly, the other boy turns quickly into a classroom on the third floor glancing around (draco has to duck behind a statue) as if he was afraid someone would see him. But as soon as he’s inside, Draco hurries over to the now closed door, casting a  Tenerisque* charm. </p><p>He watches with baited breath as Harry  collapses into a desk and pulls something out of his bag.</p><p>It’s a shard of glass. A simple, small shard of glass. Draco draws a short breath as The Golden Boy pulls up his sleeve, trails a corner of the glass along his wrist.  <em> This is when i should step it. I should stop him. But...the lines of red along his wrist strike me a statue: so many red lines.</em> They’re beautiful. They stand against his pale skin just like his lightning scar.</p><p>But Draco draws the line when blood appears in a smooth, swirling pattern on his arm.</p><p>“Potter what are you doing?” Draco practically falls through the door, letting out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding. </p><p>Harry freezes. Tugs down his sleeve. Draco almost scoffs. As if he didn’t see. The blank expression on his pretty face is replaced by a look of horror, then schooled into a warm smile. </p><p>“Oh nothing, i was just going to study a bit for the charms quiz tomorrow.” </p><p>“It’s dark in here. And i dont think cutting is a part of your test.” he raises an eyebrow. “Or is it?”</p><p>The smile melts-the smile that is so rarely seen-into a drooped, blank expression. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p>“If i tried to explain, would you understand?”</p><p>“I-I” Draco stutters. The truth is, he can’t think of anything that he would believe, that would excuse the blood now trailing down Potter’s fingers. </p><p>“Thats what i thought.” A grin. That same, stupid grin his father has in the pictures he's seen around Hogwarts.  “We all have our own ways of coping, Malfoy. “</p><p> </p><p>“Let me see.” Draco takes a step toward the boy. </p><p>“Let you see what?”</p><p>Even from three floors above, the thundering of students leaving the great hall is almost offensive to the silence. </p><p>“Let me see your wrist.”</p><p>Harry tugs up his robe, still keeping that grin. Draco looks at it for a moment before prodding the slashes with his wand. They’re not deep. They’ll stop bleeding soon. </p><p>
  <em>Knees bleed most. Shoulders hurt least. Wrists get attention.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>But for some reason, perhaps the same thing thats stopping draco from smirking and walking out and pretending like this day never happened, he thinks this might not be for attention.</p><p>Draco knows he should leave. Knows that his nemesis is suffering, knows he should be happy about that. But he cant-some unexplainable thing holds him there, despite the curling skull on his arm. </p><p>“You shouldn’t-” “I know i shouldn’t-”  they burst out at the same time.</p><p>Draco pauses, allowing for Potter to finish. “I know i shouldn’t. Can we just pretend this never happened?”</p><p>Drac0 doesn’t respond, because he knows he wont allow that. Doesn’t respond because, suddenly, he thinks he might throw up.</p><p>He waits for potter to leave. </p><p>Waits until the sound of the students has gone. </p><p>Then he walks back to his dorms, the sight of the matching scars on the boy’s arms and on his forehead flashing across his thoughts.</p>
