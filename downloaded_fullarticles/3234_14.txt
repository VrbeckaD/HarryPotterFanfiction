    <p>Harry had always liked teaching. He taught a defense club in his first life, tutored Heros to be in this life, and was about to become a teacher to an actual class of Hero students. He remembered when he'd first stepped foot into U.A. as a student. It was like Hogwarts all over again, except without the dorms or the magic. </p><p> </p><p>Harry found his classroom and frowned at it. U.A. allowed teachers to teach their subjects however they felt would best prepare their students for the real world. Harry's class was Heroic Strategy. This room of desks would not do.</p><p> </p><p>He directed the desks into stacks along the back wall. His quirk was a form of levitation similar to the charms he'd learned in his first life. Using his hands to direct where things were supposed to go was easier than using only the power of his mind, but he'd learned to do it the hard way as well.</p><p> </p><p>When his first-class began entering the classroom Harry smiled. Hopefully, this whole teacher thing wouldn't be as hard as the horror stories make it out to be.</p><p> </p><p>"Today we'll start with a simple quiz," Mr. Potter said, ignoring the students' groans with a smile. "You have sixty seconds to get into two teams and pick a team leader,"</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Potter tapped a button on his desk, a holographic timer hovering in the air.</p><p>"Time starts now,"</p><p> </p><p>Izuku wondered who would want to be on his team as his classmates scrambled across the classroom. The desks were out of the way, which made this part easier at least. Seconds later, Izuku found himself being pulled into a team of friends, and classmates. The other team was around Kacchan, the explosive teen declaring himself the team leader.</p><p> </p><p>"Team Griffins," Mr. Potter said, a piece of chalk writing it out on the board. "Team leader is Bakugo. Here is your Team Goal, and you each have an individual goal to accomplish as well, return here when you've finished if you're not here already, "</p><p> </p><p>"I'm the team leader," Momo said, glancing at their teammates for any protests.</p><p> </p><p>She led them to the front of the classroom to get their Goals. She was handed two sheets of paper, one of them she glanced at and passed around. Mr. Potter handed them their own sheets of paper, labeled 'Personal Goal', the one being passed around was labeled 'Team Goal'.</p><p> </p><p>"Complete your Goals," Mr. Potter said sitting down on his desk. "then return to see your grades,"</p><p> </p><p>Izuku looked at his personal goal, 'Put a sticker on Eraserhead's sleeping bag', to the team goal, 'Remove 13 students from their classrooms without the teacher's stopping you,'</p><p> </p><p>"This is a weird quiz," Tsuyu said. " A really weird quiz-Kero,"</p><p> </p><p>Izuku agreed. What did this have to do with Heroics?</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, we need a plan," Momo said. "There's ten of us, and we need to get thirteen students from their classrooms...somehow,"</p><p> </p><p>"I'll get someone from Midnight's class," Todoroki said before walking away.</p><p> </p><p>"Right, anyone else?" Momo asked.</p><p> </p><p>Several others volunteered to visit various teachers, and left to do so. </p><p> </p><p>"I can get someone from All Might's classroom," Izuku offered.</p><p> </p><p>"And I'll check Present Mic's," Momo said.</p><p> </p><p>Izuku walked over to All Might's classroom, a plan to achieve his personal goal forming in mind as he walked. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, All Might?" Izuku asked, walking into the training room. All Might stood, watching over a third-year group as they ran though battle simulations. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Young Midoriya?" All Might asked.</p><p> </p><p>"I need to ask you something...do you still have those stickers we'd found while cleaning the beach? And could I borrow one of your students? They'll come right back, promise,"</p><p> </p><p>All Might raised an eyebrow but nodded. </p><p>"The stickers are in my desk," he said. "Young Togata, please escort Young Mdoriya back to his classroom,"</p><p>"Yes, Sir!"</p><p> </p><p>Izuku grabbed the stickers, there were only two stickers left, Izuku sighed.</p><p> </p><p>"We need to take a detour," Izuku said as he and the third-year walked through the halls. "I need to put one of these stickers on a sleeping bag in the teacher's lounge...unless it's in the classroom..."</p><p> </p><p>"How can I help?"</p><p> </p><p>Before Izuku could begin to think of a response, Kacchan came charging down the hall.</p><p> </p><p>"DEKU!" Kacchan yelled, an explosion getting ready to blow from his hands. "DIE!"</p><p> </p><p>"Crap," Izuku said. "Run,"</p><p> </p><p>This just got a lot harder.  </p>
