  <strong>Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waist- band on Harry’s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something, as the jeans had once been Dudley’s). He lay down his spoon in a lull in the general conversation. Mr. Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Nearly time for bed, I think,” said Mrs. Weasley on a yawn.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Not just yet, Molly,” said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry. “You know, I’m surprised at you. I thought the first thing you’d do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort’s name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “I did!” said Harry indignantly. “I asked Ron and Hermione but they said we’re not allowed in the Order, so —” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“And they’re quite right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’re too young.” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched upon its arms, every trace of drowsiness gone. </strong>
</p><p>Harrys face immediately went cold, being thrown back into the feelings from the rant he had when he first saw Ron and Hermione earlier in the night.</p><p>
  <strong> “Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?” asked Sirius. “Harry’s been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He’s got the right to know what’s been happen —”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Hang on!” interrupted George loudly.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “How come Harry gets his questions answered?” said Fred angrily. “We’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven’t told us a single stinking thing!” said George.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’” said Fred, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother’s. “Harry’s not even of age!” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“It’s not my fault you haven’t been told what the Order’s doing,” said Sirius calmly. “That’s your parents’ decision. Harry, on the other hand —”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “It’s not down to you to decide what’s good for Harry!” said Mrs. Weasley sharply. Her normally kindly face looked dangerous. “You haven’t forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Which bit?” Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though readying himself for a fight. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,” said Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George’s heads turned from Sirius to Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open. Lupin’s eyes were fixed on Sirius. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“I don’t intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,” said Sirius. “But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back” (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), “he has more right than most to —” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Mrs. Weasley. “He’s only fifteen and —” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“— and he’s dealt with as much as most in the Order,” said Sirius, “and more than some —” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. “But he’s still —”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “He’s not a child!” said Sirius impatiently.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her cheeks. “He’s not James, Sirius!”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “I’m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,” said Sirius coldly.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “I’m not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it’s as though you think you’ve got your best friend back!”</strong>
</p><p>“What’s wrong with being happy over having a piece of my father back?” Harry said hotly.</p><p>
  <strong> “What’s wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him!” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. “You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Meaning I’m an irresponsible godfather?” demanded Sirius, his voice rising.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Meaning you’ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and —”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “We’ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please!” said Sirius loudly.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. “Arthur, back me up!”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say, “Dumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters —” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Yes, but there’s a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes!” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Personally,” said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, “I think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather than a garbled version from . . . others.” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs. Weasley’s purge. “Well,” said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, “well . . . I can see I’m going to be overruled. I’ll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry’s best interests at heart —”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “He’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. “Who else has he got?” </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“He’s got me!”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> “Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. “The thing is, it’s been rather difficult for you to look after him while you’ve been locked up in Azkaban, hasn’t it?” </strong>
</p><p><strong>Sirius started to rise from his chair</strong>, but Harry had had enough and got there first.</p><p>“HOW DARE YOU! Sirius was locked away after RISKING HIS LIFE trying to protect me that night! He didn't know Voldemort was gone but he made sure I was with someone safe and <em>then went after the one responsible</em>. He made some mistakes <em>yes</em>, but he's spent twelve years being bloody well tortured for it!”</p><p>Harry was shaking with fury at this point standing over the table. The room was silent, and Mrs. Weasley’s face looked like she had been hit, transforming to outrage at a child talking back. Lupin put a hand on Harry’s shoulder to try and calm him down but Harry shook him off.</p><p>“<em>You</em> may have housed me but <em>Sirius</em> is the closest thing I’ve ever had to family and he's done his <em>damn best to keep me safe</em>. Time and time again people have kept secrets from me because they want to protect an innocence that I’ve never had! And all it’s gotten is more danger for me and more people DEAD!”</p><p>But Mrs. Weasley was shaking her head now, a look of pity on her face. “You may think you're old enough, but at fifteen theres just some things you cant understa-“</p><p>Harry’s fists came down on the table and the lights flickered then brightened violently. “I HAVENT BEEN INNOCENT SINCE I WAS SEVEN AND VERNON TRIED TO KILL ME FOR THE FIRST TIME! I SLAUGHTERED A MAN WITH MY BARE HANDS WHEN I WAS ELEVEN!”</p><p>His chest heaved as he tried to reign in his magic. “I’ve fought <em>monsters</em> and maniacs, and faced the idea of my own death more times than I can <em>count</em>. Sliced open and tortured and beaten. I’ve seen <em>friends</em> DIE… And thanks to dementors I remember every fucking detail of my only family’s murder.”</p><p>At this point he was on the verge of begging, his rage turning a cold sadness as he let the sets of hands now clutching his shoulders pull him back into his chair before shrugging them off.</p><p>“What more could I <em>possibly</em> have to go through for you to see me as I am? What does it take to be worth the knowledge that might save my life? That might save my friends lives?”</p><p>Harry gestured to the other kids in the room, their jaws set even as tears were in their eyes.</p><p>Mrs. Weasley pulled a shaking hand from her mouth. “But Harry dear, don’t you want to stay a child? Go to class and have friends and be free of that <em>burden</em>?”</p><p>Harry gave a hollow laugh, eyes dull and free of the fire they had held just a moment before, voice quiet in the silent room.</p><p>“What I want doesn't matter. Voldemort (the room flinched) attacked before I was two and almost every year since I’ve been at Hogwarts. He doesn't care about killing someone underage, and he's told me <em>himself</em> he wont stop until I’m dead.”</p><p>Mrs. Weasley clutched at her husbands arm tightly, sobbing silently at his words.</p><p>Harry shook his head and decided to address the room, face reflecting the numbness he was left with after his outburst.</p><p>“I know that Dumbledore has told you what he thinks I should know, but Dumbledore is a <em>man</em>. A brilliant wizard <em>yes</em>, but <em>just</em> a man, and his choices have left me alone, in the dark, and defenseless against an enemy whose name you won't even <em>say</em>.” He sighed trying to calm himself. “I can't make you tell me anything, I <em>know</em> that, but you all need to realize that by cutting me off like this, you're making me and the people around me (he tipped his head towards his friends) fight on our own and without any help.”</p><p>The room was filled only with the crackle of the fireplace, shuffling robes and the sounds of Mrs. Weasley’s tears for a full minute before Sirius and Lupin gently guided Harry out of his chair and the room altogether.</p>
