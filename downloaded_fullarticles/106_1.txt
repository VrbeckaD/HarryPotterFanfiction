  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p><p>Fifty-eight. That was how many interminable days the Wizengamot had spent watching different sets of teeth viciously gnash together as their judgement passed without leniency. The gallery had become accustomed to witnessing bitten nails splinter themselves into the wooden armrests of the accused’s stand. It didn’t matter what family the accused belonged to. They all did it. Men. Women. Adolescents. All of them broke at some point. Blood purity did nothing to transform tortured screams into something classical or respectable. In fact,  purity was the furthest thing from spectator’s minds. It may have been fifty-eight days since the war ended, but Harry Potter’s pastime was still consumed with watching the suffering of others. </p><p align="center">**** </p><p>“Absolute bollocks.” </p><p>The muscle along Harry’s jaw tensed. He had been forced to hear the mumbled statement an obscene number of times during the previous weeks. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, attempting to ease the bundle of tension that had steadily bloomed into a migraine. </p><p>“Poncy fuckin’ git.”</p><p>Closing his eyes, Harry deeply inhaled and counted backwards from five. The Mind Healer from St.Mungo’s had instructed him to do so whenever he started to, as she described with an airy voice, “feel an unfortunate amount of impending stress.” </p><p>It was rather rich advice considering his entire life could have been classified as <em> an unfortunate amount of impending stress </em>. </p><p>An unsympathetic grin hitched the corner of his mouth at the memory of that particular afternoon. The moment the words came out of Healer Cleary’s mouth, Harry accidentally blew up a nearby sweets bowl. A traitourios chuckle escaped him as Exploding Bonbons flung themselves across her office and splattered the walls with a congealed mud-like paste. </p><p>Shaking the memory of the sweets bowl away, Harry tried the prescribed breathing exercise. With the amount of press lurking in the courtroom, he had to maintain the Golden-Boy-Now-Man behavior that the newly minted Head Auror, Gawain Robards, forced him to practice. It wasn’t good for wizarding families to see a future Auror acting unreasonably. </p><p>
  <em> “You must learn to control your emotions, Mr. Potter. Control your emotions and the control of your magic will follow. Take a deep breath for me and practice control.”  </em>
</p><p>Harry’s hands gripped the knobs of his knees as Healer Cleary’s voice flitted through his conscience. </p><p>
  <em> “Difficulties exist to shape us into who we are meant to become. It’s time to let go of those difficulties and adjust to a new normal. Release your difficulties with an exhale.” </em>
</p><p>The heels of Harry’s palms pressed into the fabric of his constricting dress robes. Forcing Healer Cleary’s voice to become nothing more than distant white noise, he deeply inhaled and held his breath. </p><p>Ron grumbled, “Slimy bastard doesn’t deserve it.”</p><p>“You don’t have to be here, you know,” Harry harshly snapped, his words tumbling out in a rush. </p><p>“Harry,” Hermione admonished with a frown.</p><p>He belatedly realized that they had gathered the shameless curiosity of a few nearby witches and wizards. Harry flinched at their stares and instinctively ducked his head down even though it was too late.</p><p>“Sorry,” he relented even though he was not feeling sorry at all. When Ron made an unimpressed noise, Harry frustratedly ran his fingers through his tangled hair. He turned his upper body towards Ron and with a quieter voice, told him, “I mean it. You don’t have to be here.” </p><p>Ron’s shoulders sagged. They both stared down into the belly of the dungeon where an intimidatingly positioned chair stood. Steel chains heavily hung from each wooden leg. The manacles seemed to insidiously glint under anticipation of ensnaring another accused. </p><p>After a moment, Ron peered at Harry from the corner of his eyes. “You don’t owe him anything.”</p><p>Harry knew it was a losing battle. He automatically looked to Hermione for an answer as she was usually the most rational voice between the three. However, she wasn’t paying them attention any longer. </p><p>Hermione stared across the chamber with a haziness that was disconcertingly unusual for her. Harry frowned and followed her gaze. He raked over the looping gallery, but didn’t see anyone they hadn’t spent the past few months staring at. Just when he opened his mouth to ask what Hermione was looking at, Harry noticed her fingers twitch. Irrevocable sadness wrapped around the pit of his stomach. </p><p>“‘Mione...” Harry started and stopped, not having the slightest clue what words would come close to being right. Maybe there would never be something as simple as the <em> right </em> words.  </p><p>Hermione halted the mindless rubbing along her left forearm where faint scars were eternally etched into her warm-umber skin. She dazedly blinked from her stupor and Harry watched her features orchestrate into something significantly more nonchalant. </p><p>How could he have been so thoughtless?</p><p>Harry felt bile rise in his throat. Forcibly swallowing it back down, he stiffly stood from the bench and ignored the gaping onlookers. He wouldn’t put Hermione in the position of having to relive that afternoon. Especially when it meant her having to listen to Malfoy defend what had taken place in the Manor. </p><p>Harry spoke without forethought. “C’mon, we’re leaving. Kingsley already has my written testimonial.” He deliberately kept his eyes on Hermione when he concluded, “<em> We </em> don’t need to be here.” </p><p>Hermione caught on quickly enough and her nonchalance visibly deflated into resignation. She shook her head. “No. Really, I’m fine. It doesn’t—”</p><p>“I’ve already done all I can do,” Harry spoke over Hermione before she could say that her being mutilated no longer mattered. “Whatever is going to happen to him is out of my hands at this point.”</p><p>“If the Wizengamot misinterprets...Harry, you won’t get to change your mind on this if you decide tomorrow you don’t like the verdict,” Hermione carefully pointed out. </p><p>Harry stubbornly folded his arms and didn’t waver. “I don’t care what happens.”</p><p>Ron disbelievingly cocked an eyebrow. “<em> You </em> don’t care what happens to Malfoy?” </p><p>Harry looked down at Hermione’s forearm once more. He shook his head. “No. Whatever they decide, he’s earned it.”</p><p>“You’re serious, aren’t you?” </p><p>Harry nodded at Ron.</p><p>Ron groaned with an impressive amount of gusto that had Harry fighting off an inappropriate smile. “Well that’s just great, mate. I’ve been telling you for weeks to forget the twat, but <em> no, </em>you just had to go off and decide at the last moment when we could’ve been at Sunday roast.” </p><p>“I think you’ll regret it,” Hermione wearily restated, fully ignoring her boyfriend’s petulence. </p><p>“Hermione, leave it,” Ron sighed and got to his feet. He stretched his arms over his head before clapping Harry on the back. “He’s finally got some bloody sense knocked into him when it comes to Malfoy. Don’t question it.” </p><p>Hermione was significantly more hesitant, but she did rise from her seat in the end. </p><p>The trio strode to the nearest aisle. Around them, murmurs quickly swelled to a chaotic buzz. They filed in a line and started up a set of stairs that exited the gallery. Just as Harry was about to reach the top step, he heard the agonizingly familiar creak of the dungeon door opening. He paused with his back towards the center of the room. The crowd’s collective voice became a ghostly hush. Then, he heard it. Two sets of footsteps crossed the floor below. Harry’s skin crawled at the tinkling of manacles dragging against the marble. The eerie echo was almost enough for him to change his mind once more. </p><p>“Oi!” Ron hissed from the gallery exit. His wide gaze nervously darted from Harry to the depth of the dungeon.</p><p>Harry shook himself out of his own selfish agenda. He had to put an end to his obsessive nature. He had to for Hermione.</p><p>
  <em> It’s time to let go of those difficulties and adjust to a new normal. </em>
</p><p>Without looking back, Harry exited the courtroom and left thoughts of Draco Malfoy behind.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>A bead of sweat slowly trickled along the supple arch of Harry’s neck. It slid over the first few notches of his vertebrae before slipping beneath the unbuttoned collar of his Auror uniform. A renegade strand of hair plastered itself to his slightly damp forehead,  partly covering the scar that spiderwebbed downwards from his hairline and cut through this right eyebrow. He flexed his fingers as a rumble of subdued magic slowly ebbed from the center of his chest towards his fingertips. </p><p>A floorboard creaked. </p><p> Harry sprang from a crouched position and swiftly slashed his wand through the air. “Aguamenti!”</p><p>“No water charms near paperwork,” Auror Faust droned without looking up from the horoscope portion of Witch Weekly. </p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I know,” Harry automatically responded. He intently stared at a cluttered desk across the Auror bullpen. When Harry thought he saw movement, he flicked his wrist with a swish. “Cantis!”</p><p>A jovial laugh sputtered out from behind Auror Merrick’s desk. The top half of a freckled face popped up over the surface, eyes crinkled with delight. “If you want to hear me sing so bad, all you have to do is buy tonight’s rounds.”</p><p>“Nice try,” Harry breathlessly laughed while lowering himself into a squat. He peeked around the corner of a filing cabinet and saw Ron grinning back at him. Harry pointedly raised an eyebrow. “I picked up the tab last week. Hang on. Make that last week<em> and </em>the week before that. Y’know, when you and ‘Mione decided to bugger off. Without me.” </p><p>“No idea what you’re going on about,” Ron innocently deflected before rapidly throwing two stinging hexes Harry’s way. </p><p>“Course you don’t, you absolute shit,” Harry scoffed without any legitimate venom. He frowned and rubbed over his shin where one of the hexes landed. “Point. You got my leg on the second one.” </p><p>“Hear that, Nessie?” Ron practically crowed. </p><p>Faust raised her head from the magazine. She deliberately pushed her glasses down the narrow bridge of her nose in order to properly glare at Ron. She pointed a finger at him. “Call me Nessie one more time and I’ll make sure the only cases Robards gives you are for missing kneazles.” </p><p>“Bit counterproductive since we’re partners.”</p><p>Her frosty gaze sharpened and Harry felt exceedingly grateful to be partnerless. </p><p>“Fine,” Ron conceded with a whine. “Did you hear that, <em> Vanessa </em>?”  </p><p>A satisfied smirk lifted her burgundy painted lips. She waved her wand towards a chalkboard mounted next to Ron’s station. The disillusionment charm fell away to reveal a new score.  </p><p>
  <b> <em>Weasley - 186 </em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Potter - 194</em> </b>
</p><p>Faust flipped to the “What Would Celestina Do?” advice column of her magazine and went back to ignoring them. Ron gave his partner a fond eye roll before turning back to Harry. His expression morphed into something more sheepish. “You’re not actually still sore about about us leaving Tentacula’s Trap early, are you?”</p><p>Harry shook his head and valiantly did not laugh at the blatant concern. Immediate relief smoothed out Ron’s features. </p><p>“Anyways,” Ron started conspiratorially, “you wouldn’t have wanted to leave with us.” He ridiculously waggled his eyebrows, “If you know what I mean.”</p><p>“I’m sure we all know exactly what you mean.”</p><p>Harry and Ron flinched at the demeaning tone. They quickly stood upright and faced their imperious boss. Robards’ mouth was twisted with blatant disappointment. The brief elation Harry felt from the otherwise monotonous day was instantly extinguished. He slid his wand into the buttery leather holster that looped around his forearm. His eyes flicked towards the chalkboard, relieved to see Faust had replaced the disillusionment. Rolling his shoulders back, Harry clasped his hands together. </p><p>Robards strode further into the bullpen, scarlet robes whipping across the air behind him in a way that reminded Harry of Snape. The Head Auror folded his arms and stopped in front of Ron. “Remind me, Weasley, how old are you?” </p><p>The tips of Ron’s ears flushed. He reluctantly muttered, “Twenty-three, sir.” </p><p>“Oh, what a relief,” Robards sarcastically praised. “For a moment I thought I had accidentally hired a second year schoolboy.”</p><p>Ron’s lips turned white where they pressed together.</p><p>Harry took a step closer to the opposing men. “Auror Robards, it was my—” </p><p>Robards’ head snapped towards Harry, cutting off whatever Harry was about to say with a chilling look alone. He steepled his hands together. “Believe it or not, just because the two of you seem to be inseparable, that does not make you the same person, Potter.” Robards pointed a thick finger at Ron, “I was speaking to Weasley.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Harry muttered.  </p><p>The heels of Robards’ polished boots clacked when he promptly spun around and stalked towards his office. He didn’t bother to glance over his shoulder when he barked, “Weasley, I want your reports finished and on my desk by the end of the day. Don’t think I didn’t notice you’re two days late on Fortescue’s paperwork. Potter, my office. Now.” </p><p>Ron gave Robards’ retreating figure an impressively withering look. Harry sympathetically grimaced and followed their boss into his circular office. He stopped short in the doorway when he saw who had just stepped out of the fireplace. His stomach sank. </p><p>“Kingsley?” Harry’s hand paused on the doorknob before remembering himself and pulling it shut. Harry couldn’t recall having to meet the Minister in Auror Headquarters since they resolved Harry’s accidental magic.</p><p>That was at least three years ago. </p><p>“Harry,” Kingsley warmly smiled and extended his hand to Harry, “how’re you?”</p><p>“Uh, fine,” Harry cautiously answered and slowly shook Kingsley’s hand. He looked between the Minister and Head Auror. Before a warning bell of non-professionalism could ring somewhere in the back of his mind, the following question tumbled out: “Have I been sacked?”</p><p>Kingsley released a deep laugh that reverberated off the sleekly tiled walls. Robards somehow appeared more exasperated than before. </p><p>“No, you haven’t been sacked,” Kingsley chortled. </p><p>Robards gestured towards one of the chairs opposite of his walnut desk. “Have a seat, Potter.” </p><p>Harry hesitated, feeling inexplicably unnerved. </p><p>Kingsley encouragingly patted the back of the chair. “You’re not in trouble. Quite the opposite, actually.”</p><p>“Sir?”</p><p>“Take a seat and let the Minister explain.”</p><p>Only fractionally reassured, Harry followed the order. He subtly wiped his clammy palms over his work robes and waited. </p><p>“Minister Shacklebolt,” Robards held his right hand out towards Kingsley as if Harry had no idea who he was, “has requested to bring you on a Class Four.” Robards’ mouth twitched as if the following words pained him. “He believes you would be best suited given certain…<em> sensitivities </em>of the case.”</p><p>Harry’s brows shot upward and he turned to Kingsley for confirmation. At the Minister’s subtle nod, Harry slumped back in his seat. Class Four was far above Harry’s clearance. Or any Field Auror for that matter. Class Four was reserved for the Minister, Head of DMLE, Head Auror, and Unspeakables. </p><p>The implication of needing him specifically was enough to create a pool of anxiety in Harry’s gut. Magic vibrated through him, clawing for release. It felt like an uncomfortable itch that would never be satisfied. He subconsciously thumbed over the pair of thin gold bands that snugly circled his wrists. </p><p>“Does,” Harry started, but stopped at how unfamiliar his voice sounded to his own ears. He closed his eyes and deeply breathed in. <em> Five, four, three, two, one. </em>When the thrum of magic slightly subsided, he tried again. “Does this have to do with…”</p><p>They all knew what he was asking without saying. </p><p>
  <em> Does this have to do with Voldemort? </em>
</p><p>Kingsley and Robards exchanged a charged look. The Minister urged Robards into action with an authoritative tilt of his chin. Reluctantly, Robards placed a roll of parchment on the desk. Harry leaned forwards, expecting a file brief, but quickly realized it was a contract. </p><p>“Before we disclose details,” Kinglsey slid the parchment closer towards Harry, “we need assurance of your complete discretion and agreement not to speak of sensitive information to any unauthorized party.” </p><p>“Hard as it might be for you, that includes Auror Weasley and Miss Granger,” Robards demeaningly taunted. He summoned a quill and inkpot. Leaning back in his chair, Robards folded his arms behind his head and crossed one leg over the other. His deep-set brown eyes bore into Harry with unnecessary challenge.  </p><p>Harry took the extensively inked parchment in hand and began to read over the terms. It was relatively standard for the first few paragraphs until the details steadily became nothing more than obscure. When he reached a third of the way down the page, he frowned and read outloud, “Harry James Potter will not reveal the location of Personnel No. One’s quarters as well as his own temporary residence in the duration of Q.A.:Classified Case Four.” </p><p>“If you decide to accept, you will temporarily be living elsewhere,” Kinglsey elaborated without actually explaining anything. </p><p>Harry’s frown deepened. “Where, though?”</p><p>“I can’t tell you that.”</p><p>Harry glanced at the agreement. “For how long?”</p><p>Robards bitterly huffed out a burst of air. He stood from his seat and stared down at Kingsley. “If the definition of what ‘classified’ means is too complicated for Potter, I hardly think he is the Auror for the position. I’ve been telling you from day one that the preferential treatment he gets—” </p><p>“That’s quite enough,” Kingsley’s expression darkened. He raised himself to his full height and spoke with unveiled impatience, “As I have explained numerous times, Auror Potter has not received any more preferential treatment than you yourself, Gawain. He received near-perfect marks throughout training and has a superb case record. On top of that, given his particular background, Harry is the perfect Auror for this case. Now, if you question my decision one more time, especially in front of another subordinate, I won’t hesitate to put you on suspension.”  </p><p>The hue of Robards’ skin had steadily changed from sickly green to deathly white during Kingsley’s diatribe. When Robards quickly peered at Harry with ill-concealed contempt, Harry didn’t know how he was meant to react. There was no protocol for what to do when your boss openly campaigns against the merit of your employment. It wasn’t as if he was unaware that Robards didn’t like him. Everyone in the department knew that. However, up until his outburst, Harry had chalked it up to the fact that Robards didn’t seem to like anyone. </p><p>During the following silence, Harry decidedly saved thoughts for Robards until a later date and fully digested what Kingsley had said. </p><p>
  <em> Given his particular background, Harry is the perfect Auror for this case. </em>
</p><p>“So this <em> is </em>about Voldemort,” Harry confirmed more to himself than the other two men. When neither answered, he spoke a bit louder. “Isn’t it?”</p><p>Kingsley’s gaze flickered to the contract and Harry let out a frustrated noise. He grabbed the quill, dipped it in ink, and messily scrawled his signature at the bottom of the parchment. Harry tossed the quill back onto the desk’s surface. </p><p>“Tell me.” </p><p>Kingsley grinned despite the palpable tension in the room. He tightly rolled the parchment up and slipped it into his robes. “Let’s start from the top, shall we?” </p><p>Robards sounded forcibly more agreeable when he asked Harry, “Have you heard of Quod Authirutas?” </p><p>“No,” Harry slightly frowned and shook his head. “Sounds like an incantation, though. What is it?”</p><p>“<em>Who </em>is it,” Kingsley politely corrected. “It sounds like an incantation because it’s Latin. It means, The Authority.”</p><p>Robards slid a narrow case file to Harry. “A society recruiting likeminded witches and wizards who want to prevent another war.”  </p><p>“That’s...a bad thing?” Harry perplexedly stretched out. He didn’t want to sound thick, especially after Robards’ tirade, but he was becoming increasingly more confused as the meeting carried on.   </p><p>“Obviously not, Potter,” The Head Auror austerely grunted. At Kingsley’s warning glare, Robards amended, “No, it’s how they propose to do it.” </p><p>“They believe the way to prevent another  war is by protecting the magical world from growing complacent,” Kingsley grimly said. “They’re subtly going to create hysteria.”</p><p>“And hysteria means rash actions,” Harry thoughtfully sighed, catching up to where the conversation was going. </p><p>“Precisely.” Kingsley looked away from Harry and rubbed his forehead. “As our history has shown, it doesn’t take long for prejudice to take form when we’re feeling vulnerable.”</p><p>Harry’s shoulders dropped at the thought of a Witch Weekly article Faust had mentioned that afternoon. “Sir, would this have anything to do with the hotel by Leaky?” </p><p>A few streets from The Leaky Cauldron, there was a recently renovated hotel, Owl’s Nest. In a month’s time, the highrise would open to host not only wizarding families, but muggles, too. Magic wasn’t permitted to be used on the premises, even in private rooms. The general idea was to promote positive relations between wizarding folk and muggles, all the while keeping the Statute of Secrecy. According to Faust, it was the main topic of conversation for all news outlets. Even the Quibbler had begun to abstractly cover the impending opening.  </p><p>Kingsley didn’t turn around from where he was staring at the hearth along Robards’ fireplace. “We can only assume.” </p><p>“Merlin,” Harry breathlessly intoned. He picked up the file labeled, <em> Quod Authirutas: Classified Case Four </em>. </p><p>“Word of the group first came to our attention roughly two months ago.”</p><p>Harry nearly dropped the file.</p><p>“This has been going on for months?” Harry slowly asked, firmly injecting disbelief into each word.</p><p>Kingsley nodded and motioned for Harry to open the file. “There wasn’t substantial evidence that it needed to be investigated rather than monitored from the ground.” </p><p>“You’ve got to be joking.” Harry couldn’t help the sheer disappointment that poured into his expression. He had spent nearly the majority of his life fighting Ministers who didn’t take radical supremacists seriously. Harry never would have believed he’d have to have this kind of discussion again only a handful of years after the second war. Especially with an Order member. </p><p>“People are free to hold their beliefs, regardless of how twisted they might be,” Kingsley calmly pointed out. He held out his hands by his side. “There wasn’t anything to be done.”</p><p>“But now there is,” Harry muttered and opened the folder.  </p><p>“Now there is,” Kingsley seriously agreed. </p><p>Harry combed over the worryingly small amount of information. One of the Ministry's informants implanted in Knockturn Alley was first to report murmurs of the movement. When favorable traction seemed to be gaining, Auror Merrick and Auror Boone were assigned to scope out the rumored location of Quod Authirutas’ next forum. Pinching his bottom lip between his teeth, Harry flipped to the next page of the report. </p><p>There were two photographs of a small house, each dated from the prior evening. Harry recognized Auror Merrick’s profile in the corner of the first photograph. His lean frame was felinelike as he carefully stalked closer towards a dense thicket. It wasn’t until the second photograph that something bizarre happened. </p><p>Harry quickly blinked and stared at Merrick’s hand. One moment, Merrick’s wand was carefully raised in his grasp and then the next, his hand had flexed as if it had been hit by a stinging hex. The wand vanished.</p><p>“His wand disappeared,” Harry incredulously marveled. He shook his head as if to clear up more space to help him understand what occurred. Narrowing his eyes, he peered closer at the photograph. Where he originally thought the picture had a grainy quality, he realized it was actually Merrick’s wand turning to dust. Harry’s jaw slackened. “It <em> disintegrated </em>.” </p><p>A sickening sensation plagued Harry as he imagined how Merrick must have been feeling. Wandless. Harry was hurled back to a time during the horcrux hunt where his own wand had been splintered beyond relief. It had felt as if he was walking around with nothing more than a phantom limb for his wand hand. It was foreign. Unnatural. He shuddered when Kingsley snapped him back to the present. </p><p>“There was an undetected ward along the perimeter of the house. We assume it only destroys wands that haven’t had their magical signature registered by the leader of Q.A.”</p><p>Harry tossed the case file back on the desk and reluctantly admitted, “Impressive.”</p><p>“It is,” Kingsley readily recognized, but Robards’ expression had disturbingly twisted as if he has just bitten into a lemon rind. </p><p>“Did you find anything inside the house?” Harry asked. </p><p>“Nothing, yet. We can’t get past the wards,” Kingsley confessed with a visible amount of unease that made Harry sit up straighter. “Curse-Breakers can’t disable the traps. They’re intricately designed and require powerful wandless magic to disassemble them.”</p><p>“That’s where you come in, Potter,” Robards denounced. </p><p>“But,” Harry anxiously gripped the band along his left wrist, “I haven’t used wandless magic since—” </p><p>“Merlin help me,” Robards closed his eyes. He exasperatedly gibed, “We’re not talking about <em> you </em>using wandless magic.” </p><p>“Oh, right. Course,” Harry awkwardly bleated. He felt a heady amount of relief, but with it also came a surprising amount of indignation. Rubbing the back of his neck, he stumbled to question, “So...why me?”</p><p>Kingsley and Robards exchanged another silent conversation. Harry wanted to curse them both for their silence, seeing as he had signed the bloody contract. </p><p>“You’re going to have to come with us, Harry,” Kingsley finally acknowledged him. He strode to the fireplace and grabbed a handful of Floo Powder. “It’ll be better for...well, you’ll understand.”</p><p>Harry didn’t move. </p><p>“On your feet, Potter,” Robards instructed with a rough clap against Harry’s shoulder. He strode towards the fireplace and gave him a withering look, “Or do you no longer wish to be involved on this case?” </p><p>Gritting back a response that would actually get him sacked, Harry got to his feet. He watched Kingsley step inside the fireplace and boldly say, “Gringotts!” before disappearing in a roar of emerald flames. At the destination, Harry questioningly looked at his boss. Robards cruelly smirked and said nothing. </p><p>Knowing he wasn’t going to get answers from the other Auror, Harry first pocketed his glasses and then gathered a handful of Floo Powder. Letting go of the powder, he carefully enunciated, “Gringotts!”</p><p>Harry squeezed his eyes shut and tightly pressed his arms to his side. He felt an uncomfortable sensation ripple around him while his body was transported past different fireplace grates before abruptly halting. Green flames receded, but a film of soot still clung to his skin and robes. </p><p>A young group of wizards that had been walking by the hearth, abruptly stopped at the impressive arrival of the Minister of Magic, Head Auror, and Harry Potter. They unmovingly gaped for a moment before collectively huddling together. As they walked away, their excited gossip trailed behind them. </p><p>“Not everyday you see that.”</p><p>“I wonder if a vault has been broken into?”</p><p>“D’you reckon?”</p><p>“Don’t be an idiot, why else would they be here?”</p><p>“Alright, alright. No need to be rude!”</p><p>When their hurried voices diminished, Harry stepped further into the bank. He was fully aware that their presence caught more than just a few questioning looks. With that, Harry easily slipped into his public persona. It was a “confident yet approachable” demeanor that Kingsley and Robards had insisted he adopt. </p><p>He politely waved at an edlerly witch who had a velvet pouch of coins clutched in her bony hands. At his attention, she promptly dropped the bag. She owlishly blinked back at Harry and didn’t make any movement to pick up the tumbling sickles. </p><p>Oddly enough, the paralyzed in awe response happened more times than not.</p><p>With a grimace, Harry stiltedly lowered his hand and discreetly turn away.  </p><p>The Minister led them along the aisle of tellers until they reached an ornately carved podium of sorts. Harry stood back as Kinglsey leaned forward to have a hushed conversation with a rather plump goblin called Blagnogg. Robards surreptitiously positioned himself by Kingsley’s side, eyes restlessly sliding over their surroundings as if he expected an ambush. </p><p>After a few minutes of waiting, a stoney-faced guard appeared by the stand. He stood nearly a head above Harry in height and his closely cropped haircut gave him an aura of authority. On his chest was a silver name tag with “Gannon” printed in cold block letters. </p><p>Harry instinctively didn’t like him. </p><p>Kingsley beckoned for Harry to follow Gannon and Blagnogg. They veered away from the miner carts that brought bankers to their vaults. Rather, Blagnogg directed them towards a discrete metal door that was somewhat obscured by shadows. He pressed a meaty palm against the industrial material. A shimmer danced over the pewter-grey surface and the distinct noise of a locking mechanism opening <em> clicked </em>. </p><p>“Gannon will take you from here, Minister,” Blagnogg curtly told them with a slight downward tilt of his head. </p><p>Kingsley nodded, “Thank you.”</p><p>Blagnogg left the way they came and Harry couldn’t explain the sinking feeling that took place inside of him. </p><p>Once Gannon pushed the door open, the four of them strode past the mouth of a daunting passageway. </p><p>Dimly lit by sconce torches, the polished walls steadily transformed into macabre limestone. The further they walked, the air around them became muggy and nearly tangible between Harry’s fingers. He didn’t realize claustrophobia had sunk its talons into his nerves until the walls of the passageway widened and he shakily exhaled. </p><p>Harry ignored Robards’ demeaning leer when he tugged at the collar of his uniform to allow air to touch his dewy skin. He couldn’t stand small dark spaces. </p><p>“Not glamorous enough for you, Potter?” Robards muttered under his breath. </p><p>Harry ground his teeth together and forced himself to swallow down a retaliation. </p><p>The passageway led to an empty oval room with three connecting doors. </p><p>Kingsley was staring at the left door when he asked Gannon, “Did you tell him we were coming?”</p><p>Harry could have sworn a sickly smile was threatening to tug at Gannon’s mouth. He blinked and the guard’s lips were back into a firm line. He shook his head once. “No, sir.”</p><p>Kinglsey didn’t appear to be reassured or disappointed by the report. Harry whipped his head toward the left doorway and slid his wand from its holster. </p><p>“Sir,” Harry carefully began, “who exactly is in there?”</p><p>Kignsley sighed, and it did nothing but bolster Harry’s anxiety. </p><p>“Let's find out, shall we?” Robards jumped in, sounding and appearing far too delighted by the idea. He might as well have been rubbing his palms together and eliciting a maniacal cackle. “You can stay out here, Gannon. We’ll be fine.”</p><p>Everything about the situation had Harry’s teeth on edge.</p><p>“What the fuck is in there?” Harry incredulously asked Kingsley, not caring how it looked to be speaking to the Minister with such brashness.</p><p>Kingsley turned towards Harry and his gaze was full of gravity. He opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it once more. Finally, he carefully appealed, “I need you to remain practical.”</p><p>Harry felt his cheeks flush with pure frustration. When he didn’t respond, the Minister glanced at Gannon and tightly nodded. </p><p>Gannon walked right up to the door and placed his hand over the center just as Harry had seen Blagnogg do earlier. He twisted the doorknob, nodded for them to approach, and then pushed the door fully open. Kingsley and Robards walked straight into the room without hesitation. Harry was far more cautious. His fingers tightened on his wand before taking any steps towards the doorway.</p><p>When Harry walked through the threshold, every single thought that occupied his mind swiftly vanished. </p><p>They were inside of what could have been loosely classified as a studio flat. </p><p>Harry’s hand limply fell to his side as he rapidly took in his surroundings. </p><p>The limestone walls caved in together to create a low dome ceiling. Harry suspected if he were to reach upwards, his fingertips would be able to brush the dome’s peak. While the walls remained bare aside from an oddly placed mirror, the small room itself was condensed with furniture and, primarily, books. Harry bewilderedly stepped further into the room, his gaze catching on an overflowing bookcase. Well-loved books of all bindings and sizes filled the shelves until they were forced to create towering piles on the floor. </p><p>A kitchenette hugged another tiny portion of the room. There was a black kettle on a stovetop and an empty mug sitting on the adjacent countertop. Harry slowly ran his hand over the sanded surface, birch walnut nearly blending with his own skin tone, and then began to circle the room. </p><p>Aside the countertop was a rickety table. The legs seemed close to buckling under the weight of an ancient gramophone. Unlike the bookshelf that held the contents of an extensive library, Harry could only see one album resting against the table. He tilted his head to read, <em> Le Carnaval des Animaux </em>. Underneath the title were cartoon depictions of an array of animals. Everything from a lion to a tortoise to a swan, could be found in the myriad. </p><p>Continuing his pace, Harry passed a wardrobe and peered around a four-paneled partition. Nestled behind the room divider was a narrow bed. Cream sheets and duvet neatly stretched over the mattress. At the end of the bed was a carefully folded quilt. Harry reluctantly thought of the messy state in which he left his own bed at Grimmauld.  </p><p>A muffled sound of a faucet running brought Harry’s gaze away from the quilt and towards the only other door in the room. Kingsley gave him one final disconcerting look when they heard the tap turn off.  Harry held his breath as the door opened. </p><p>The man that stepped out of the connected washroom was  infuriatingly familiar and somehow impossibly foreign. </p><p>It was Malfoy.</p><p>But, at the same time, it wasn’t. </p><p>Harry’s brain couldn’t work fast enough to catalogue the distorted version of the boy he hadn’t seen in almost five years. </p><p>If it wasn’t for the trademark white-blond hair that Harry had spent years actively despising during Hogwarts, he would have sworn this man was a complete stranger. However, where Malfoy had always worn his hair short and slicked back, this man had tresses that tumbled past his shoulders and halfway down his chest. Mindlessly, Harry thumbed one of his own curls that fell almost nearly as long. </p><p>When he was just a boy, Malfoy’s pointed features had transformed his face into something antagonistically repellent. As a young man, however, his sharpened features created something formidably enigmatic. Harry couldn’t tell if that was because his cheeks had hallowed while his the rest of him slightly broadened with lean muscle. </p><p>Muscle that was covered by muggle clothing nonetheless. Harry’s gaze dropped from the blue crew-neck jumper to a pair of speckled grey joggers. In all of his years, Harry had never seen Malfoy dressed in anything remotely casual and now he was strolling about in <em> muggle </em>leisurewear. </p><p>Even with all of <em> that </em>put into consideration, Harry was mainly fixated on a strip of gauzy material that was tied over Malfoy’s eyes. He nearly dropped his wand at the ridiculousness of the entire thing. Harry hadn’t heard a whisper of Malfoy since the trials and here he was, walking around the depths of Gringotts wearing muggle leisurewear and a blindfold. </p><p>Before Harry could break into the tirade that had boiled to a surface, three things happened in very quick succession. </p><p>Malfoy halted his stride into the room and whipped his head from left to right. He swiftly flexed his fore and middle finger before waving them in a sharp severing motion. Harry jolted back as a ring of canary-colored light shot across the room. It pushed itself through Harry, Gannon, and Kingsley. Harry rapidly patted over his front where a bizarre wave of heat felt as if it was exploring his skin. </p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Harry halted his manic ministrations and looked up to see Malfoy’s body facing him. He was standing straighter than before, the tip of his chin slightly raised. Harry belatedly realized Malfoy was taller than he remembered. Or it was just the size of the room that made him appear that way. Or it was the sudden display of wandless magic. Harry was too discombobulated to tell. </p><p>“What did that spell do, Malfoy?” Harry sputtered with anger. Any tact he previously possessed flew out of the door. </p><p>Malfoy fractionally tilted his head, but remained disturbingly expressionless. “Potter?”</p><p>Harry never heard Malfoy say “Potter” with more monotony. Confusion replaced hostility as Harry’s main emotion. Malfoy always, <em> always, </em>had the uncanny ability to layer Harry’s surname with pure venom. Restlessly, he glanced at Kingsley and Robards. The Minister had his bottom lip pinched between his fingers, and the Head Auror looked inordinately pleased. </p><p>Not allowing his own caginess to show, Harry decided to treat Malfoy the way he always had. With purposeful provocation. He scoffed, “Take off the blindfold and see for yourself.” </p><p>After a moment, Malfoy slowly turned towards Kingley’s direction. He folded his arms and stood with bald confidence. “You didn’t tell him.”</p><p>Kinglsey released his bottom lip and sounded overly thoughtful about his words. “We thought it would be best...”</p><p>“If Potter saw for himself,” Malfoy finished without feeling. </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Malfoy flatly commented, “How ironic.”</p><p>“You better watch your tone,” Robards darkly warned. </p><p>“What tone?” Harry incredulously cut in. He was on the verge of tugging his hair out. A world where Malfoy didn’t respond to Harry’s general existence with melodrama wasn’t feasible. It was material from a parallel universe. Harry shook his head, “He sounds like he’s been hit by Imperio and instructed to have the personality of a wet mop.”</p><p>“Close enough,” Malfoy acknowledged. </p><p>“Too far, Draco,” Kingsley warned. </p><p>“Can someone please tell me <em> what the fuck is going on </em>?” Harry’s voice steadily rose to shout. The other three men faced him. His chest rose and fell with rapid breaths. Harry wanted to rip the blindfold off of Malfoy and shake him until he met Harry’s eyes. He needed to see the contempt he felt reflected back at him. </p><p>Kingsley sighed, “Have a seat. Both of you.”</p><p>Malfoy strode towards a tufted wingback chair with precise steps. His fingers reached out to touch the left arm of the chair just before he turned to sit down. Harry was enraptured by Malfoy’s movements. Everything was different than Harry remembered. The way he neatly sat with his hands on his lap, posture upright, and head tilted as if he was calculatedly listening for motion. Nothing about him was abrasive like the way he used to be. </p><p>Harry padded towards a maroon couch perpendicular to Malfoy’s chair. Disturbingly, Malfoy was clearly tracking him as he quietly walked. The direction of his head followed exactly where Harry was. Harry stopped halfway to the couch and Malfoy didn’t did miss it. His face remained on him. When Harry silently took just one more step, his weight carefully on the balls of his feet, Malfoy knew it. He lifted an eyebrow, but the rest of his expression was unmoving.</p><p>“You’re testing me,” Malfoy stated, his matter-of-fact tone proving he knew exactly what Harry was doing.</p><p>Not wanting to confirm what they both knew, Harry deviated. For the second time, he said, “Take the blindfold off.” </p><p>Harry didn’t know why it suddenly seemed like the most important thing in the world for Malfoy to do so. He supposed it was because he knew he could rely on finding some legitimate answer in Malfoy’s eyes. Malfoy had never been good at shuttering his emotions. </p><p>“I will if you sit down,” Malfoy evenly acquiesced and gestured towards the couch. He turned towards Robards. “The sooner I find out why you decided to bring Potter in my home, the better.”</p><p>Robards snarled, “Don’t talk to me like that, you insolent—”</p><p>“You live here?” Harry spoke over Robards.</p><p>Even though all signs led to that conclusion, Harry felt shocked by the admittance as well as the clear lack of disgust from Malfoy when he said it. Malfoy lived in a cramped crevice in a bank and didn’t seem to care. He didn’t seem to care about anything. </p><p>“I do,” Malfoy said without elaboration. </p><p>Harry plopped down on the couch and Malfoy leaned forwards. Even though it was his idea, Harry was startled when Malfoy actually went to untie the material. His arms stretched as he unknotted the blindfold. The movement caused the cuffs of his sweater to slightly slide back. Harry confusedly narrowed his eyes at a thick black line that briefly appeared along Malfoy’s left arm. Malfoy lowered his hands and Harry’s attention was brought back upwards. </p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Yes, Potter,” Malfoy folded the blindfold and numbly echoed, “<em> oh </em>.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes were milky, pearl-grey.  </p><p>“You’re...you,” Harry thickly stammered, unable to get the words out. </p><p>Malfoy was detachedly staring just to the right of Harry. “I believe the word you’re grappling for is <em> blind </em>.”  </p><p>Malfoy was blind. </p><p>Harry’s righteous anger left him in a whiplashing whoosh. He skimmed around the room as if it would give him answers. Both Kingsley and Robards were steadfastly avoiding his gaze. Harry rubbernecked back towards Malfoy when he wrapped the blindfold back around his head. </p><p>Once Malfoy finished, Harry asked barely above a whisper, “What happened?” </p><p>For the first time, Malfoy showed a trace of actual emotion. The corners of his mouth quivered downwards before reverting to a thin line. “The trials.”</p><p>Harry frowned, “What does that have to do with you...whatever happened to you?”</p><p>“Merlin. You truly didn’t care what happened after the war, did you?” Malfoy said, sounding as if he was confirming something to himself. </p><p>Harry indignantly shot back, “You’ve got to be joking.”</p><p>“Why? Does this amuse you?”</p><p>Harry’s anger resurfaced. He shook his head and dumbly realized Malfoy couldn’t see him.  </p><p>
  <em> Malfoy was blind. </em>
</p><p>“That’s not what I meant.” Harry squeezed his hands into fists and gritted out, “Of course I cared about what happened after the war.”</p><p>“Allow me to rephrase,” Malfoy propped one elbow on the arm of the chair and rested his chin on his hand. He sounded almost bored when he clarified, “You didn’t care what happened to <em> me </em> after the war.”   </p><p>“That’s not true,” Harry lied. Heat coloured his cheeks. </p><p>“Still have that scar of yours, Potter?” Malfoy calmly asked. When Harry instinctively reached towards his forehead, Malfoy tutted. “Not that one.”</p><p>“How’d you know—”</p><p>“Because I know you. Whether you like it or not.” Malfoy pointedly wiggled his fingers, “I meant the one on your hand.”</p><p>Harry protectively rubbed his fingers over the back of his hand. The pink scars were faded, but they never disappeared. </p><p>
  <em> I must not tell lies.  </em>
</p><p>He cleared emotion from his throat, “How do you know about my hand?”</p><p>“I <em> know </em> you,” Malfoy steadfastly asserted without further explanation. He sounded too level-headed when he continued to chastise Harry. “Don’t lie and say you cared. You clearly did not because you didn’t even know what my sentence was.” </p><p>“I defended you!” Harry hotly pointed out. He swiveled towards Kingsley and almost beseechingly carried on. “I gave the Minister a written deposition of what happened at Malfoy Manor. And the astronomy tower.” </p><p>Kingley didn’t say anything. </p><p>“Sir?” Harry asked no louder than a whisper. He was vaguely aware he sounded like a scared child.  </p><p>Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose. Harry could see his chest expand with a deep inhale. He lowered his hand, but kept his face turned away from Harry. </p><p>“You left,” Malfoy flatly said. The muscle along his jaw twitched, “I watched you leave.” He shook himself out of his own reverie and he was back to indifference. “Your statement didn’t hold weight without you there to defend it.”   </p><p>“No,” Harry vigorously shook his head. “No, that can’t—”</p><p>“Harry,” Kinglsey interrupted. Somehow the single address was able to confirm everything Malfoy had said. </p><p>When no one spoke, Robards decided to be the person to break the silence. He clapped his hands together, “I think that’s been enough for one day, don’t you, Minister?” </p><p>“Suppose I shouldn’t be surprised you’re not going to tell me why Potter came here in the first place,” Malfoy deadpanned. He reached towards the ground, his fingertips skimming the air before coming in contact with a book. Malfoy picked it up and opened to a bookmarked page.</p><p>Robards ignored the comment and strode to the door. Kingsley tilted his head towards the exit and motioned for Harry to follow the Head Auror’s suit. </p><p>“You can’t be serious,” Harry challenged, looking between Malfoy and the Minister. “I’m not going anywhere until someone starts making a lick of sense. Malfoy’s right, why am I here?” </p><p>Kinglsey was losing his patience. He tersely said, “It’ll make sense in a moment. Now, follow Head Auror Robards out.” </p><p>Harry’s shoulders sagged in a combination of defeat and the weight of Malfoy’s earlier statement. He glanced at Malfoy once more, watching as he waved a hand over the right page of the book. A disembodied voice began to read the book aloud. Malfoy didn’t seem interested in their presence any longer.  </p><p>Kingsley, Robards, and Harry left the room without further word. Gannon was still stood outside of the room and straightened his posture at the sight of the three wizards.</p><p>“Minister,” Gannon stiffly nodded. </p><p>“We’re going to need the interrogation room,” Kingsley answered without preamble and interestingly enough, walked towards the middle door.   </p><p>“Yes, sir,” Gannon dutifully nodded and then unlocked the door. </p><p>They walked through the second door. Harry instantly felt ice insert itself in his veins. The door shut behind them with a metallic <em> clink </em> and the other men sat themselves around a sterile table. Harry couldn’t move. He was utterly petrified by the view in front of him. </p><p>He was staring into Malfoy’s studio. </p><p>Harry walked closer towards the transparent barrier. He touched the cool glass and understood how he was seeing into the room they had just left.  </p><p>“The mirror,” Harry mumbled. He watched Malfoy flick to the next page of his book. Harry cursed, “Merlin, you’ve put in a two-way glass.”</p><p>Robards proudly hummed, “My own particular contribution.”</p><p>Sadness rooted itself somewhere inside of Harry’s hatred for Malfoy. </p><p>“He doesn’t know.” </p><p>It wasn’t a question, but Kinglsey answered anyways. “No. He doesn’t.”</p><p>“You approved this?” Harry turned away from the glass, feeling disgustingly perverse, and faced the Minister. He jutted a thumb over his shoulder towards the glass, “How could you have possibly thought—”</p><p>“Mind yourself, Potter,” Robards unkindly cautioned. </p><p>Harry ignored the heading. He hotly pressed on, “Is his sentence surveillance?” </p><p>“House arrest,” Kingsley corrected.</p><p>“House arrest?” Harry shrilled, his voice shooting up an octave. “How does a two-way-mirror align with the parameters of house arrest? You’re taking advantage of his…” Harry angrily choked off, unable to voice what he refused to believe.  </p><p>“The blindness is temporary,” Kinglsey diplomatically reassured. “The enchantment lasts for one year.”</p><p>Robards added, “As did the other hijacks.”</p><p>“Other hijacks?” Harry wearily asked. </p><p>“Emotion, touch, and speech,” Robards rattled off almost off-handedly. He abruptly snapped his fingers, “Oh, and first year was Azkaban.”</p><p>Harry’s knees buckled. He had to grab the table’s surface to keep himself upright. Bowing his head, Harry let the information swell over him until it drowned him. He squeezed his eyes shut. Malfoy had been abused for the last five years. He couldn’t feel emotion. He couldn’t feel touch. He couldn’t speak. If Harry hadn’t walked out on the trials it wouldn’t have happened. Harry <em> never </em> would have let that verdict happen. </p><p>“You’ve been torturing him,” Harry quietly spoke. </p><p>Robards shot from his seat and closed in on Harry. He smelled rancid as he breathed down Harry’s neck. “Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater. He got what was coming to him.”</p><p>“He was just a boy,” Harry growled back. His magic dangerously crackled beneath his skin.</p><p>Robards viciously pointed at the mirror, “Have you forgotten what he’s done, Potter? <em> Who </em> he is?” </p><p>“I know who he is better than you!” Harry shouted back. </p><p>“Which is exactly why I picked you for this case, Harry.”</p><p>Harry and Robards snapped their mouths shut at Kingsley’s comment. </p><p>“What?” Harry barked. At Kingsley’s raised brow, he tacked on a slightly more reserved, “Sir.”</p><p>“Head Auror,” Kingsley looked to Robards, “wait for us outside.”</p><p>Robards looked like he had been slapped. His cheeks were ruddy and eyes restless as they darted between Harry and the door. He squeaked, “Sir?”</p><p>Kinglsey cocked his head towards the door. “Outside.” </p><p>Robards unintelligibly grumbled under his breath as he left the room. </p><p>“You have an incredible way of driving him round the twist,” Kinglsey commented with a faint smile playing over his lips.</p><p>Harry couldn’t be bothered with pretence. “Why did you pick me?” </p><p>Kinglsey gestured towards the seat across from him. “Would you like to sit first?”</p><p>“<em> Kingsley. </em>”</p><p>The Minister breathed deeply, and Harry impatiently waited.</p><p>“The deposition you gave for Draco proved you know him better than any Auror we have on our team,” Kinglsey divulged as he steepled his fingers together. He glanced at the mirror. “Draco has been working as a Curse-Breaker for the last three years.” </p><p>Harry’s jaw went slack. </p><p>“As it turns out, his hijacks have strengthened different aspects of his magic rather than...<em> hinder </em> them.” </p><p>Harry watched a quick collision of guilt and embarrassment pass over the Minister's face. He read between the lines of what Kingsley accidentally inferred. </p><p>“You were trying to force the magic out of him,” Harry took a deliberate step back from the table. “To make Malfoy a squib.”</p><p>“Like I said,” Kingsley carefully sidestepped the accusation, “his magic has adapted to his circumstances.”</p><p>“Circumstances,” Harry scoffed. “That what we’re calling it?” </p><p>“Deciding the correct sentence for every Death Eater wasn’t an easy job,” Kinglsey appealed, and Harry could hear the earnestness in his voice. </p><p>Harry turned his back to Kingsley. He forced himself to shove away the disgust he couldn’t help but feel towards the Minister. They all played their part in Malfoy’s fate. What made him any better than Kingsley? </p><p>Harry felt shocked beyond relief and was rendered numb. With a deadenned voice, he asked, “Why Malfoy?”</p><p>“He’s the only Curse-Breaker who can manage completely wandless.”</p><p>“Was his wand snapped?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Harry suspected as much, but it didn’t ease the uncomfortable feeling in his gut. </p><p>“Do you know what spell he used earlier?” Harry eventually asked, turning around to look at Kingsley. “With the light?”</p><p>Kingsley nodded and stood from his seat. He slowly walked around the table as he explained, “It senses an individual’s magical signature, which allows the caster to know who’s in a room with them.” </p><p>The Minister chuckled at the way Harry’s eyes widened. Harry touched over his stomach where he had felt the tingling heat roaming over his skin. “Do you mean…” </p><p>“He will know when you’re in a room with him, yes.”</p><p>Harry nodded, unsure why Malfoy knowing his magical signature felt oddly intimate. He wasn’t sure what to say. Instead, he returned to his original inquiry. “You still haven’t explained what you’d like me to do.”</p><p>Kingsley stopped beside Harry, and both of them stared out of the double-glass. Malfoy hadn’t moved from his position on the tufted chair. After a moment, Kingsley explained, “Draco hasn’t been outside in five years. The only people he’s been in contact with in recent years are Gannon, Robards, Healer Blackshaw, and myself.”</p><p>“He’s been seeing a Healer?”</p><p>“Of course. It was actually Healer Blackshaw’s idea to give him the blindfold. She enchanted it to block out light. Apparently, it bothers his eyes.” He glimpsed at Harry from the corner of his eye. “We’re not as cold-hearted as you’re thinking.”</p><p>Harry didn’t placate him, but re-worked the words over and over in his head. He couldn’t remember Malfoy reacting badly to the lights when he took the blindfold off. Then again, Malfoy could be detrimentally stubborn when he wanted to make a point. It was one of the few things they had in common. </p><p>The Minister carried on when Harry didn’t speak. “Healer Blackshaw reckons he’s stable enough to be taken on-site. Robards...has his hesitations.”</p><p>“I bet,” Harry derisively muttered. </p><p>Kingsley sighed but didn’t reprimand Harry’s tone. He continued on, “We came to a compromise. Since you will be the Auror partnering with Draco, we want you to do a preliminary three day assessment. Study him. Determine what you make of his stability and skills. If you believe he is strong and safe enough, we will take him on the case.” </p><p>“No pressure, then,” Harry stiffly joked. </p><p>Harry mulled over Kingsley’s words. He rubbed the back of his neck and began to pace the small room. In a warped way, Harry felt as if he owed Malfoy another chance. As quickly as the thought entered Harry’s mind, though, his ingrained hatred toward Malfoy battled his empathetic nature. </p><p>Plucking his glasses off his nose, Harry held his face in his hands. He forced himself to keep a clear head. Malfoy committed crimes, and he was paying for them. It had been nearly five years, though. Malfoy <em> had </em> paid for them. Harry couldn’t help but glance back at the double-mirror. He quickly made up his mind.</p><p>“I’ll do it on one condition,” Harry said before he could overthink it any further. He pointed at the mirror. “This comes down. Today.” </p><p>If Kingsley was surprised by the request, he did a good job hiding it. He curiously stared at Harry’s determined expression. “It would prove helpful to observe him.”</p><p>“It comes down,” Harry firmly re-stated, leaving zero room for disagreement. </p><p>Kingsley stared at the mirror for a long moment. He nodded. “Alright. I’ll have Gannon remove it once we leave.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Kingsley cautiously implored, “You do understand Draco will be your responsibility. If you clear him and he goes rogue...it’ll be on your head.”</p><p>Malfoy abruptly closed his book and turned towards the double-mirror. Harry felt pinned to the spot. He subconsciously rolled his wand between his fingertips even though Malfoy couldn’t possibly know Harry was watching. When Malfoy finally faced away, Harry numbly accepted that he was about to do something extremely idiotic. </p><p>“Yeah,” Harry heavily exhaled. “I understand.”</p>
