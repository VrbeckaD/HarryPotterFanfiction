    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I said <em>now</em>, Mr Malfoy."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco grudgingly scooped up his books from what he thought was his safe invisible corner to Potter in the front row. Trust Professor Milligan to insist on everyone having a Potions partner on the one day Potter was without his Weasel. Draco had been doing quite fine by himself all year. Now, he was expected to work with Harry Potter? How fucking inspired.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter didn't even look up as Draco sat down. <em>Fine</em>, if that's how he wanted to play it. Draco could ignore Potter too. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Who was he kidding? </span>
  <span class="s1">“So where’s the Weasel?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter looked up in surprise, his mouth gaping open in a way that should have been gross but had a certain attractiveness to the sexually depraved brain. Draco would be putting this exact memory in his pensieve for a wank later. He was only human. Wait, Potter was talking. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“...mean Ron, he's sick.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sick of you or sick of living in poverty?” Cruelty still came easy to Draco's lips, but the aftertaste was bitter. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter’s face twisted, not in the anger Draco loved to see flare up, but in disgust.  “Shove off, Malfoy.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Gladly,” Draco snapped back, which he admitted to himself was a terrible comeback, if it could even be considered one. “<em>After</em> I make this potion.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“After <em>we</em> make this potion,” Potter corrected. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Actually, there’s no <em>we</em>, Potter. I’m going to use my expert skills to create this potion to absolute perfection and you’re going to watch with no input because I refuse to let you fuck up my grade.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course, Potter didn’t like that. His eyebrows did <em>the thing</em> Draco wanked over in his pensieve only two weeks prior. “What about<em> my </em>grade?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Your grade will inflate from my Potions expertise and you won’t even have to lift a finger,” Draco explained as he pre-heated the cauldron between them. He reached for his Potions book to check the exact temperature but Potter snatched it up. Draco lunged. “I don’t see why you’re even arguing with me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Because you’re being a prick,” Potter said, holding the book high out of reach, which didn't make any sense because Draco was exactly 11 centimetres taller. Draco wouldn't have been surprised if the perfect bastard was using wandless magic. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco jumped for the textbook with no success and even less dignity. He leaned back and crossed his arms. “Well, you’re being difficult.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>I’m </em>being difficult? You won’t let me do anything.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Because you’ll fuck it up.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter lowered his arm an inch. “I won’t."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You will. And you know it. You’re just arguing with me for the sake of arguing.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So are you!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No, I’m trying to maintain my Outstanding grade. Do keep up, Potter.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fine,” Potter said, slamming Draco’s book on the table and dropping back down to his chair. “Do whatever you want. I’ll just sit here.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco rolled his eyes. Any other student (with the exception of perhaps Granger) would have jumped at the deal Draco had offered. “You might as well make yourself useful and pull the ingredients from the pantry.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter laughed. “Oh, so now you want my help?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t want your help, just your use as a courier owl,” Draco said, only to be contrary. Riling Potter up usually brightened Draco’s mood, if only for a fleeting moment.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter snorted and crossed his arms. “No.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>Potter</em>.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You distinctly said there’s no ‘we’. You wanted to make the Potion on your own. You fetch the ingredients.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco realised Potter was being serious. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fuck you, Potter,” he muttered as he stomped off to the Potions pantry. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco let his eyes dart back between his currently cooling potion and work desk, searching for the next and final ingredient: white horse hairs.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Fuck.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Potter didn’t look up from his doodles. He’d been drawing snakes all over the margins of his Potions textbook. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Fuck,” Draco repeated louder and with more emphasis.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“What do you want?” Potter asked. Finally.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“We’re missing the white horse hairs. Since you’re not doing anything of use, can you get off your lazy ass and grab some from– “</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“No.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Potter,” Draco said, keeping his eyes on the potion, “if I let this potion cool for too long, it’s going to turn fuchsia and we’ll have little hope of even scraping an Acceptable grade. So, unless you want to kiss your dreams of becoming an Auror goodbye, you’ll get me those horse hairs.” He risked a look over at Potter. “And quickly please.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Only if you admit you need my help.” Potter looked far too pleased with himself.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Yes,” Draco said, allowing his impatience to soak his tone. “I need your help. I literally just asked you for assistance. Hurry the fuck up.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Potter’s smug look disappeared and he trudged – much too slowly – to the pantry.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco refocused his attention on the potion. It had turned into a deep shade of purple which meant it was time to commence stirring. Draco did so carefully, once clockwise, twice anti-clockwise, once clockwise, thrice anti-clockwise, once clockwise, four times anti-clockwise, once–</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Potter slumped back into the seat beside Draco with an unnecessary sigh. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Chop them finely,” Draco said quickly, not wanting to lose count. He heard Potter grumbling beside him but he blocked it out. Anyone who underestimated the importance of a perfect stir was an idiot. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The potion was now lavender. Once the horse hairs were added, it would turn into a soft periwinkle blue and they’d have an Outstanding level potion. All thanks to Draco, obviously. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You can add the hairs now,” Draco said to Potter, taking a small step back. He couldn’t do much to sabotage the potion now anyway.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Potter lifted up the chopping board and starting scraping the hairs in. Draco noted they were cut a little uneven but let it go, knowing it would be unlikely to affect– <em>fuck.</em> Draco spotted it too late: the telltale iridescent sheen of the hairs.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Potter, stop,” he called out reflexively but the damage was already done.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Potter turned around, oblivious. “What’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco took in four deep breaths, reached acceptance that the potion was irreparably ruined and backtracked to anger. “Tell me, Potter," he said through gritted teeth, “what kind of hairs did I ask you to get?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Potter's eyebrows did <em>the thing</em> but Draco hardly even noticed. “Horse hairs?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“So,” Draco said, attempting to keep his voice level, "why the <em>fuck</em> did you just dunk a handful of unicorn hairs in my otherwise perfect potion?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Potter’s eyes flashed, recognising his mistake. He crossed his arms defensively. “I think you mean<em> our </em>potion. And what does it matter? Unicorns are basically horses anyway– ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“UNICORNS ARE BASICALLY HORSES ANYWAY IS THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS AND FACTUALLY INCORRECT THING I HAVE EVER HEARD.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco heard laughter behind him. Why couldn’t he have stayed in his safe invisible corner?</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Calm down, Malfoy. I’m sure the potion will still– ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“IT WON’T STILL WORK BECAUSE THE MAGICAL PROPERTIES OF UNICORN HAIR ARE PARTICULARLY POIGNANT AND UNLIKELY TO ADD SUBSTANCE TO ANY POTION OTHER THAN A– ” Draco caught himself before he said anything further. People were starting to stare. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Other than a <em>what</em> potion?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Never mind,” Draco said, staring at the floor and hoping his face wasn’t obviously flushed. “It doesn’t matter. In summary, you’ve ruined everything.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’ve ruined everything? You wouldn’t let me do anything!”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“And the one thing I did let you do, you ruined, so I’m not sure what your argument is.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Isn’t the potion supposed to be blue?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“It would have been if you hadn’t– ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“It’s blue.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco looked up. “What?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“The potion’s blue. It’s fin– ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“But what shade of blue?” Draco asked, pushing past Potter to see the potion. “I’m sure it’s not the right– ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Except it was. It was the exact periwinkle blue it was supposed to be.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“See?” Potter said smugly in a smug voice that was far too smug. Did Draco mention it was smug?</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco swivelled back around to face Potter. “Just because it’s– ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Relax, Malfoy. It’s fine.” Potter summoned a goblet without even pulling his wand from his pocket and filled it with the potion. “I’ll prove it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy watched, wide-eyed and frozen, as Potter tipped his head back and chugged the potion without a single hesitation. He dropped the goblet and they both stared at each other, waiting for something to happen. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">A beat passed.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You really are the most reckless person I know. Like dangerously stupid, Potter. I can’t believe– ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And then everything went black.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Unicorn hair was the star ingredient in any soulmate potion worth a damn. Draco knew this because he’d tried every soulmate potion he could get his hands on. The ones that worked all featured unicorn hair…and all came to the same conclusion: Harry Potter was his soulmate. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was rather poetic really. The one person Draco had ruined his chances with beyond all repair was his soulmate.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Being soulmates didn’t mean you’d end up together, of course. Happy endings couldn’t be guaranteed. All a potion could tell you was who you were ultimately compatible with, and who, given the right opportunity and right circumstances and a splash of luck, could make you happier than any other. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">No, there wasn’t some predestined fate awaiting Draco and Potter. There was only real life where Draco had already fucked it all up. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And now he had to live with it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco came to before his body did. His eyes were planted firmly shut and no amount of will seemed to open them. It wasn’t until he was already hobbling to his feet when they acquiesced and granted him vision. </span>
  <span class="s1">How he wished they hadn’t.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Crouching above Draco was…well, Draco. With impeccably styled hair as usual, of course. Because he had more than two brain cells, he knew immediately what had happened. He’d switched bodies with Potter. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“For fuck’s sake, Potter, why’d you have to– ” Draco trailed off and so did the Draco in front of him. They were talking at the same time, which didn’t make any sense except if–</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“What the fuck is this?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco could hear Potter’s voice as if he were across from him, but he couldn’t see him at all. Draco straightened up and watched the Draco in front of him do the same. It was all very disconcerting but simply to figure out. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Isn’t it obvious, Potter?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was clear from Potter’s grumbles it was not, in fact, obvious. Or it was and Potter was just thick.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Let me spell it out for you, Potter. I’m going to close my eyes now.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco did as he said, but his vision did not change. He watched as the Draco in front of him closed his eyes at the very moment he intended to.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I can’t– I can’t see.” Potter’s voice was panicked. “What’s happening? Everything's dark.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’m going to open my eyes now,” Draco said and did so. He heard Potter exhale. “Now do you get it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Are we…seeing through each other’s eyes?” Potter asked, as if he still wasn’t sure, despite all the evidence.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“No, Potter. We’re seeing through each other’s belly buttons. What the fuck do you think?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco saw himself as he spoke, his eyes narrowing and lips twisting cruelly. He felt queasy. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Fuck off, Malfoy. Why do you have to be such an arse all the time?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Why do you have to be so thick?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not thick! I’m sorry I can’t be as calm as you when I’m sharing my vision with an elitist asswipe.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Very creative, Potter but we’re not <em>sharing </em>our vision, technically we’ve switched– ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I KNOW!</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco turned his head – no Potter must have – because Professor Milligan came into view. Draco turned his head in the same direction – it was less disconcerting when he could trick his brain into thinking the vision was his. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy,” Professor Milligan said in the wrong order as she addressed them both with a look, “what have you done?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I didn’t do anything,” Draco said quickly before Potter could blame him. “Potter ruined our potion and then, because he’s an absolute buffoon, drank it, and now I can only see through his stupid near-sighted eyes.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’m wearing glasses for fuck’s sake.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Language, Mr Potter,” Professor Milligan said, staring at Draco. “And there’s no need for your tone, Mr Malfoy,” she said to Potter. She turned back to Draco. “How did you ruin the potion, Mr Potter?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“All I did was add unicorn hair instead of– ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco saw the recognition in Professor Milligan’s face. “And you didn’t touch the potion at all, Mr Malfoy?” she asked. “It was only Mr Potter who came into contact with the potion?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco nodded. He could feel his face growing red at the admission of it. Potter glanced in his direction – out of habit it would seem – and Draco had the pleasure of seeing his own blushing face up close and personal. He closed his eyes, but of course, it didn’t help. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Stop doing that!” Potter said.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco opened his eyes. Potter turned back to Professor Milligan. She addressed the class behind them. “Everyone, please finish your potions, bring a labelled vial to my desk and dismiss yourselves. I must take Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter to the hospital wing immediately.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Draco already knew that wasn’t going to help. </span>
