    <p>A green eyed boy sits next to you in class<br/>You take notice of him<br/>You see how his eyebrows furrow in concentration while working.<br/>You see how his hair sways in the wind, revealing his lightning bolt shaped scar<br/>One day you decide to say hi to him<br/>He smiles and says hi back, then asks your name<br/>You tell him what it is, he smiles and says he likes it.<br/>Then he tells you his name, “Harry” but you already know what his name is, everyone does.<br/>You two start to talk more, You meet his friends.<br/>You take a liking to them all, they seem funny and caring. <br/>Harry starts to talk with you more.<br/>You guys tell each other jokes and secrets.<br/>Once the school year ends you go with him to his friends house, only for a while though, because you don't want to be a burden.<br/>Molly says it's okay if you stay, but you insist on going back home. <br/>Once you're home, you spend summer with your family. You write letters to Harry and his friends frequently. <br/>The summer's over before you know it and just like that you're back at Hogwarts.<br/>You find Harry and his friends, and you guys pick up the year like the last one never ended.<br/>Pretty soon all of you are closer than ever before. Especially you and Harry.<br/>The year goes on and you and Harry get even closer. <br/>Then before you know it, the year is over, and you’re waiting to board the train with Harry by your side <br/>You notice a small blush start to creep up on his face. You wonder why that is.<br/>He pulls you to the side and gives you a hug. You guys stand there for a moment, enjoying the others embrace. <br/>You hear the train pull into the station, so you break the embrace, wishing that it could never end. From the look on his face, Harry thinks the same.<br/>Then as you say goodbye and start to walk away, he grabs the sleeve of you shirt, stopping you from going any further. <br/>You turn back to him. His face is now a scarlet red.<br/>“I...well..I..really like...you..” He says, stumbling over his words<br/>You smile, “I really like you too” <br/>“No, I..I mean that...I like you...as more than just a friend” He stutters out, blush seeming to get even darker.<br/>Your eyes widen, Harry's a really nice guy, and you’ve wanted this for a while now, but, you're not sure if you the right person for him. Maybe you could just try it out, “I..I like you too...as more than a friend” <br/>Harry smiles and hugs you again. <br/>“Make sure to write!” He says as he runs to the train, probably to tell his friends what just happened.<br/>“I will, every day!” You say as you wave to him and start to run to the train.<br/>You smile to yourself as you make your way to a empty spot on the train.<br/>You think about what happened and smile again, imagining what could become of you two</p>
