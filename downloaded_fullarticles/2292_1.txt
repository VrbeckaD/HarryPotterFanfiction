    <p>1. If I wasn't a fashion designer, I'd be a gossip columnist.<br/> 2. My mother is my best friend.<br/> 3. I'm very fond of Muggle literature.<br/> 4. My favourite is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, because it's all about survival of the fittest.<br/> 5. When I first visited Paris, I was disappointed that even wizards couldn't go to the very tip-top of the Eiffel Tower.<br/> 6. I have shopped in every shop on the Champs-Élysées.<br/> 7. Divination is drivel, but Astronomy is fascinating.<br/> 8. I was fond of stealing my mother's wand as a little girl and attempting to cast makeup and beauty charms on myself.<br/> 9. The results were never pretty.<br/> 10. I detest champagne.<br/> 11. I'm studying to become an animagus.<br/> 12. My favourite colour was pink, until fifth year.<br/> 13.

I have been good friends with Viktor Krum ever since he visited Britain for the Triwizard Tournament.<br/> 16. Some of my designs have been worn by many of the wizarding elite.<br/> 17.

I routinely beat the pants off anyone in Slytherin when playing Wizards chess.<br/> 20. I could also drink them under the table.<br/> 21.

It's my dream to headline my own fashion show.<br/> 24. If I ever needed to, I have enough information to blackmail my dear friend Draco Malfoy for the rest of our lives.<br/> 25.
