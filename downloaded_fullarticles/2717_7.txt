  <span>Ding</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>The bell above the door that lead into Borgins and Burke’s  shop sang, letting its owner that a customer had arrived.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Mr.Borgin sighed as he strutted out of his office and into the main shop area where a tall, blue haired and sliver skinned teen stood wearing a dark but expensive trench coat and matching boots.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Ah Young mistress Kandomere, it’s so good to see you again! How are you doing this lovely evening?”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>The blue haired girl looked up to reveal her white-silver colored eyes and a beautiful smile as she beamed at the elderly man.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Her moon light like eyes made it clear she was no ordinary witch or even human...There was no doubt that she was Elven.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“hello Mr.Borgin! It’s so good to see you again and I’m doing as well as I can...you see I’m running low on my medicine and it’s been terrible. My runes are burning like nobody’s business and the bloodlust is...well difficult to quench.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The teenager said mournfully as she took off her gloves to reveal a scabbed over death rune and fire rune on her left hand while her right had black snake like markings that traveled under her coat and stopped at her neck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my...that’s terrible dear! I’m am so sorry to hear that! It’s such a shame you get obtain your medicine legally over in your country...much like kinder eggs. Well anyway I do have your medicine but we may have to wait to get it. You see I have a few clients that are doing business with my partner in the room where your vial is...my apologize Miss Kandomere.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mr. Borgin said in a regretful tone as he examined the girl’s hand before letting her go and sighing loudly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please call me Inny or Ianna, You’ve known me for 3 years now and my family for well forever! But I don’t think I can wait...But if I must then I guess I have no other choice…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna said sighing as she pulled out her phone and messaged her brother, Ienzo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d be happy to even pay 10 or 20% extra to get it now...but I guess I have wait.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instantly Mr.Borgin’s attitude changed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know their meeting hasn’t full started, besides I’m sure they will understand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mr. Borgin said smirking as he he led Ianna to the back room where he timidly knocked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A woman with pale blonde hair answer the door, she could’ve easily been 30 but stress made her seem more like 40 instead nevertheless she was enchanting to look at.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After some whispering and haggling the two were allowed in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instantly Ianna felt unsafe as if she had just crossed into the dark plain, the feel of darkness and the stench of death was eminent and overwhelming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna’s stomach did a flip as she spotted fenrir Greyback, a notoriously violent werewolf with a rap sheet the length of Merlin’s beard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Lycan smiled evilly at her as she trailed close behind Mr. Borgin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“An Elf? Haven’t seen the likes of your kind in ages...especially one as beautiful and Delectable as you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fenrir said smirking as Ianna glared at him, Draco who had been unaware of Ianna’s presence until now felt his chest tighten as he laid eyes on her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s Elv to you Lycan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna said tucking a lose blue curl behind her ear, greyback snarled as he let out a growl and bared his teeth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The hair on the back of Draco’s neck stood up as a chill passed over him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suddenly there was a shriek from the blonde woman as a blue haired man no older than 23 apparitioned into the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was wearing a matching black suit jacket and dress pants set with a white button up and black tie with a rose that was the same navy blue as his hair and eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Along with the unusual looking suit he had a holstered 9mm that had unique markings on it, possibly runes of some sort etched into it and a badge that read:</span>
</p><p>
  <span>FBI - Magical Affairs Division- Special agent </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna groaned as she pursed her lips and turned around, clearly not pleased at the visitors arrival.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Gramoto*</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Ienzo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna said crossing her arms as the man sighed and looked around before looking down at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco frowned as he looked to his mother, he had never heared that word before maybe because it was the elven word for hello or greetings but Draco wouldn’t have known that it was elven as he had never been exposed to it before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gramoto, Ianna… May I ask What are you doing here? In a place like this? With criminals?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ienzo said in his native tongue of elven, leaving this group of wizards lost as what the siblings were discussing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I need my medicine and I wanted out of the house, is that a problem?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna said narrowing her eyes, Ienzo pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have no idea how worked up mother is! You’re lucky that father and I were done with our business at hogwarts when you texted me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ienzo said as a soft feminine voice began whispering from inside Ienzo’s bag.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Free me! Free me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The voice whispered, both Ienzo and Ianna understood it clear as day but to the others it was a faint hissing noise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna gasped this time in English before rushing forward and pulled the snake out of her brothers bag.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The snake in question was all white basilisk snake, it’s eyes were a sapphire blue instead of an intense yellow like most.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The snake hissed as it coiled up ianna’s arm and wrapped itself loosely around her neck before licking her cheek.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome...Tell me do you have a name?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna asked in perfect parseltongue, causing all eyes with the exception of Ienzo’s to go wide in shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The female basilisk shook her head,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s yours to keep, we found her down in the chamber when were sealing it. It was only her and 3 others, her mate is with father and the others are being rehomed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ienzo said in English as a small smile came to his face as he watched his little sister bump snoots with the snake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, I think we’ll be fast friends, what’s her mates name?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ashtaroth...He was a feisty beast, although loyal. He bit me twice before we got him calmed down.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ienzo said snickering as he looked back on the memory.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t help but over bear miss Kandomere but was that parseltongue you were speaking?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mr.Burke asked as he and his partner worked on mixing up Ianna’s potion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed it was...it’s almost non existent in the wizarding communities or so I hear. Such a shame too, snakes are such graceful and beautiful creatures...Much like our race.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna said smiling up at her brother before petting the snakes head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Name...I want a name!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The snake demand as she bobbed her head around eager for attention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How about….Lilith?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna said using parseltongue as she looked Her snake in the eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yesss! That’s wonderful! May we go home now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilith hissed as she flicked her tongue against ianna’s cheek. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suddenly Lilith hissed as she focused her attention on the window up above them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Peeping toms! Spies! Rats!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lilith hissed angrily as she bared fangs, her eyesgflowed yellow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instantly Ianna covered Lilith’s eyes and cuddled her to her chest as she soothes the snake, turning around to see that no one was there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We should go now, I have something I need. To teach about your school before you go there next week. Is the elixir ready sir?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ienzo said putting a hand on his sister’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes indeed it is! That will be 15 Galleons. Tell me young miss are you heading to hogwarts this year or just business?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mr.Borgis said grinning as He handed the Vial to Ianna and received payment from Ienzo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Both. Father says that I should get out of the country more, although he is concerned about the return of Britain’s Darkest Wizard-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Magus”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ienzo said interrupting Ianna as he corrected her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine </span>
  <em>
    <span>warlock</span>
  </em>
  <span> anyway but his return is just another reason for me to go to hogwarts, Do my part in lending some light in a time of darkness. Beside I could use a brush up on my transfigurations and charms.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A rather bushy haired woman that looked dreadfully pale and rather mental began to cackle as she listened to Ianna talk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry miss Lestrange, does something amuse you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ienzo said focusing his attention on the black hair woman as sighed loudly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh most definitely! Lovely little Lottie thinks she can defeat the dark lord!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix snickered in a song song voice that grinder on The elves ears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t defeat him...not alone but if I can help make sure than no more parents have to bury their babies because of him, then I’ll do what I can. For humans, children are the ones to bury their parents, parents aren’t supposed to bury their babies. Taking a life is wrong but the life of a child is particularly heinous. That’s why I’m going to be a dark soul hunter just like my brother and father.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna said proudly as she kissed Lilith’s head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Such big dreams...Such a shame they’ll be snuffed out!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix mocked as she took a step towards Ianna with her wand out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instantly Ienzo pulled Ianna backwards as he drew his gun.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One more step and I’ll splatter your brains across this room Lestrange! I’ll look past you being alive but if you even so much as touch my sister I promise you, Azkaban will look like paradise compared to your stay in Oblivion. Your death will not be a good one, you will die without honor or prayer or peace. No one will be there to receive your soul at the Crossing fields...Remember that Lestrange.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ienzo said as his irises  turned the color of moonstones as he took his safety off, the room was dead as everyone held their breath in shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tension gripped the room like the stench of death on a rotting corpse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instantly The owners stepped in between the two as The blonde haired woman snatched bellatrix’s wand away from her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco gasped a few times as he stared at Ianna in wonder and confoundment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re going home Ianna. I don’t want you to step foot near this backwater shop again! Do you understand me?! You could’ve been killed!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ienzo said as he placed his weapon back into its jokester and turned to his siter who blinked a few times before sighing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Next time-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There will be no next time for this place. Father and I will obtain your medicine. This is no place for you! This is why mother is so stern about you coming to London!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re making it sound like as if I made you draw your gun...You know what I think I can apparate home by myself...Thank you for the visit Ienzo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ianna said stiffly as she stared up at her brother before turning to the owners and apologized feverently and said a few warm good byes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But before leaving as gave Draco a warm smile and a wave before disappearing with a snap of her fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a shame she’s not one of us...she would make a fine wife for Draco wouldn’t she Narcissia?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Narcissia sighed and looked over at Draco who flushed a deep pink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s still hope...the mind can be changed..and a heart swayed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Narcissia said as she cupped Draco’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes and turned his attention the cupboard as if uninterested but his action couldn’t be further from the truth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In reality he was fancied by her and curious all at the same time. she was undeniably beautiful as well as smart and the fact that she wasn’t even human peaked his curiousity even more…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For once he was excited to start school for reasons beyond the usual of seeing his friends and despite dreadful and gut wrenching task he had been given by Voldemort himself, hogwarts was something to look forward to.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile outside…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She speaks parseltongue Harry!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A bushy brown haired woman hissed excitedly as she and her 2 friends navigated their way out of knockturn alley.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know Hermione! I was right there! I don’t understand any of this though! I’ve never seen an elf like that before...come to think of it I don’t think I’ve heard of there being elves like her in hogwarts or the UK at all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry said excitedly as he as his friends headed into the leaky cauldron.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s because they usually stay in their own communities well at least here that’s the case but she didn’t sound British at all, if I had to guess probably America...East coast maybe...Possibly Boston.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But she said her Father was an ambassador and that brother of hers had that badge...Somethibg Federal Division of Magic was it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Federal Bureau Of Investigation, Magical Affaires Divison...Special agent I think.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron added as he curtailed behind his friends</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good memory Ron!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s hard to forget something like that...Makes me wonder...Do you think that muggles and wizards aren’t you  know separated over there in the States like they are here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron asked as he shut the door to Harry’s room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They aren’t segregated like over here, it’s amazing! Orcs, centaurs, Dwarves, fairies and even dragons all live together like normal people. My aunt lives in Los Angeles and she says they have orc cops now! But the elves they’re a bit stuck up and very wealthy. I can ask her if she know about this ambassador. I Anna said she was going to hogwarts...maybe we can get to know her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione said as she pulled her hair back into a ponytail.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s just hope Draco doesn’t get to her first...you saw the way he was ogling at her! Creepy dude I tell ya!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron said shaking his head as the other two blushed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She seems passionate about defeating Voldemort, you heard her talk about losing her sister to him, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry said as he reached over and stroked hedwig's head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I highly doubt he’s going to say anything about Voldemort to her, Harry. Besides, I don’t think a girl of her place would stoop so low as to go for Malfoy…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione said as the conversation went quiet for a few moments until Ron broke the silence with talk of new teachers.</span>
