    <p>Al Potter has not been a problem child. Not compared to his siblings (too-cheeky-James and Lily-lacking-regard-for-her-personal-safety) and also not compared to his best friends (raising-the-dead-Rose and stubborn-as-hell-Scorpius). He hasn’t exactly been an angel all the time either—but all in all, he hasn’t made his parents worry too much. Until now.</p><p>It <em>is</em> a nice day. They are done with their NEWTS, done with seemingly endless studying. Their families are there to cheer them on (and there’s a little tinge of sadness for who’s missing, but that almost manages to accent the joy of the day –it has been a long time), Rose and Scorpius, as head girl and boy hold a nice speech and the air is filled with the warmth of summer and new beginnings.</p><p>The thing is, James and Lily and Scorpius and Rose all have something in common: they know exactly what they are going to do with their lives the nice summer day of their Hogwarts graduation (well, James actually graduated a year before and Lily isn’t going to for another two and Al doesn’t actually know if she has a plan for her future, but knowing her, she probably does).</p><p>Al, on the other hand, has no clue. Doesn’t have a clue as Scorpius and Rose finish their (inarguably inspiring) speech, doesn’t have a clue as he hugs his father, doesn’t have a clue as he boards the Hogwarts express for the last time ever and still doesn’t have a clue as he brings his suitcase back to his room in his parents’ house.</p><p>Albus declines Scorpius and Rose’ invitation to travel to Australia with them over the summer. He isn’t quite sure why. He likes his friends and he likes the idea of travel, but doing it just doesn’t feel right. It’s something in Rose’s eyes as she invites him—a certain kindness that Al isn’t sure if he wants. It’s not that they pity him, they know him better than that and besides, what is there to pity? But he feels like it is the first step in <em>their</em> future and while he definitely has a part in that, it isn’t <em>his. </em>Al can see in their eyes that they don’t quite understand, but that’s alright.</p><p>Still lost and with nothing else to do, he starts wandering the city. At day, and at night, too. He’s not doing a lot, really—mostly walking, and sketching the more interesting things he sees. He gets a little bit addicted to it—to the views of the city, to the loneliness in midst of all the people and to the lostness itself, to the point he finds himself craving it.</p><p>He does not notice his parents worrying about him first. Of course, his parents have always worried about him—if he eats his greens, if he wears his scarf in the winter, if he is happy and safe. This is a new kind of worry. He is not used to it.</p><p>It takes his mother, usually loud and not-at-all subtle about her feelings, sitting him down to talk to realise what’s happening. She has her serious face on and for a moment Al is scared that Something Has Happened. It’s only when she calmly but firmly asks him whatever it was that he had been doing for the past month staying out all night not talking to anyone that he realises it’s him that Is Happening. His parents think that he has gotten involved in something shady. Maybe drugs or something, he isn’t quite sure. He hadn’t even noticed that he hasn’t been talking much.</p><p>There isn’t really anything to it—he’s not doing anything, just walking and drawing, but Al doesn’t feel like it’s anything he can explain to his mother the same way he couldn’t explain it to Scorpius and Rose either. He just can’t. For a lack of better ideas he tells her he has gotten a job. The relief in her face feels like a stab in the stomach.</p><p>Al doesn’t like to lie, so telling his parents he has a job when he, in fact, does not, is not really something he feels comfortable with. Especially since they are going to find out almost certainly eventually. They are Harry and Ginny Potter and they didn’t win a war by having bad instincts. The only solution to this problem is, of course, to actually get a job.</p><p>Al forces Lily to teach him the basic functions of a computer, fakes a CV in a thing called an internet café, and applies for a couple of jobs. He starts in some sort of muggle fast food place but gets fired pretty quickly because he very obviously has no clue what he’s doing. The same thing happens three more times, at a 24 hour super market, a gas station and the internet café he faked his CV at(—it isn’t even that fake, mostly it just says he’s a muggle and even has his real name on it), until he gets a hang of how both muggle jobs and customer service work. His fourth job is at a weird mixture between a bar, a club and a café, in the sense that people go there in the evenings to party and then stay to have breakfast. Like all of his other jobs, it’s firmly in the muggle part of London. Al doesn’t feel like being recognised the same way he doesn’t feel like staying in one place too much or talking to people all day long.</p><p>It is a good job, though. Good for Al, at least. It is hard work, for sure, and stressful, and exhausting, but he isn’t lying to his parents anymore and while he doesn’t make a lot of money, it <em>is</em> something he has for himself. Besides, his coworkers are nice (even though Al keeps his distance) and he can take night and evening shifts, which fits his insomnia.</p><p>By the end of the summer, Al has settled into a routine. He works at He goes to sleep late at night or in the early morning, gets up in the afternoon, spends the rest of the day straying around various museums and art galleries in both the muggle and the wizarding world before they close and Al goes in for work—either the evening or the night shift, or both. When he doesn’t work at night, he wanders around—not to the clubs and parties, at least not mainly, but to see things, watch people, and to draw.</p><p>It’s a good routine, as far as he is concerned. Not a terribly social one, but that wasn’t what he was going for anyway. In any case, his parents seem fine with it, mostly. Less worried. Al tells them a bit about work—the drinks he has learned making, how to count and calculate muggle money quickly—but he is reluctant to share about his wanderings.</p><p>But as the end of the summer approaches, he realises that they are expecting for something to change. For him to move on. To start doing whatever it is that he is going to be doing with his life. Al still has no idea.</p><p>By now, Scorpius and Rose have come back from their travels, happy and sun-burned and full of plans. Rose starts her studies at the Magical Academy of Medicine, while Scorpius heads into a low-level job at the portkey-office in the ministry that he takes ridiculously seriously.</p><p>Al starts taking up more shifts at the <em>Nightowl, </em>some in the mornings and afternoons. They are less busy, but Al actually gets to sleep at night every once in a while and some of the old ladies that come in every Thursday teach him how to knit.</p><p>He uses his salary to buy books about art. Art history, techniques, books that depict pictures he likes. He gets himself a cheap muggle camera that he takes onto his nightly walks to capture the things he sees. It’s small stuff—the lights of the pubs falling into the streets, the gasoline shimmering like a rainbow in a puddle—but they have an odd kind of magic to them Al doesn’t quite know how to describe. It’s not enough to sketch them anymore, so he starts painting them, setting the room in his parents’ house up like his art studio.</p><p>His parents, who are worrying about him again.</p><p>Harry Potter comes into his son’s room at an afternoon around four o’clock. Al’s had a morning and a noon shift, quiet enough for him to sketch his customers on the counter after wiping all the surfaces. His manager doesn’t mind Al drawing when there isn’t anything else to do. Al is a hard worker and by now he knows how to be efficient. He’s a good employee and a little sketch on the notepad for his orders isn’t going to change that. Anyway, Al has gotten his sleep in at night and isn’t due for another shift until tomorrow night, so he is up in his room, painting, when his father comes in.</p><p>“Hey, Al.”, he says, standing in the doorway. Al greets him with an absent sort of smile and nod, then goes back to frowning at the line of yellow light in his new painting. He is not quite happy with it, but he isn’t really sure why.</p><p>It takes him a while to notice that his dad is still there, must have come in here for a reason.</p><p>“Oh”, he says, belatedly, “hi, Dad.”</p><p>Harry steps inside, looking around the room a little bit bewildered. It’s not like he never comes into Al’s room, but over the last couple of weeks, it has changed quite a bit. There are his paintings everywhere, canvases standing around leaning against each other and even more pieces of loose paper, printouts of his photos and sketches he uses for reference, art books and post-its holding notes, most of whom would barely make any sense to anyone who isn’t Al at two a.m.. In short, it is a bit of a mess.</p><p>Harry chooses to sit on the bed, which is mostly free, due to the fact that Al needs it to sleep there.</p><p>“Have you been seeing any of Rose and Scorpius lately?”, he asks.</p><p>Al’s mind is still half on the yellow paint. “Sure”, he says. He met up with them last week. Rose is excited about her classes, but stressed out of her mind and Scorpius is clearly being underestimated by his employer, but all in all, they seemed pretty happy. Al startles at the thought and looks his father into the eyes. “Nothing happened to them, did it?”, he asks, alarm clear in his voice.</p><p>“No, no, of course not”, Harry says and Al exhales in relief. “I was just wondering if you were keeping up with them.”</p><p>Al’s brow twitches. “Of course I have. They’re my best friends.”</p><p>It’s true. They are. Al loves them to death. They are the two people he knows best in the world and they know him. He would do anything for them. And yet he hasn’t thought about them much at all lately.</p><p>“It’s just that you have been behaving differently lately”, Harry says carefully.</p><p>Al has a feeling he knows what he means but he asks anyway. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well, you haven’t been talking a lot to your mother and I lately. It’s not- You’re an adult now, Al, I don’t want to tell you what you should be doing, but-“</p><p>“Do you want me to move out?”, Al asks, suddenly, without knowing he was going to ask it.</p><p>His father looks at him, startled. “No, I mean, eventually, but that is not what I was talking about-“</p><p>Al doesn’t quite know what he is feeling, but his mouth is quicker than his mind to catch up.</p><p>“I have some money saved up from my work at the <em>Nightowl</em>, if you give me a bit of time I can probably find something soon-”</p><p>It would be possible. He could rent a cheap place, maybe room with someone. He knows he doesn’t need a lot, just a bit of space to paint and a bed to sleep. A small kitchen.</p><p>“No, no!”, Harry says suddenly, almost violently, “I’m not trying to drive you away, Al.”</p><p>Al looks up and sees the urgency in his father’s eyes. It’s a kind of desperation he has barely seen there before and it scares him a little.</p><p>“I-“ Al stumbles, he doesn’t know what to say.”</p><p>“You’ve been pulling back from us.”, Harry says, softly, calmly, in a way that worries Al more than yelling ever could. “Your mother and I, your friends, your brother and sister—we barely know what you’re up to these days.”</p><p>“I’m not doing anything bad.”, Al says, not quite sure what the right approach is in this situation, or even what the situation is, really.</p><p>Harry holds out a hand and brushes it through Al’s hair. The touch is unexpected and goes through Al like a jolt. Not in a bad way, it’s just that, well. He hasn’t exactly touched a lot of people lately, not casually, not affectionately. He hasn’t noticed, but he notices now.</p><p>“I believe you”, Harry says, “You’ve always been such a sensible boy.”</p><p>And it’s true, isn’t it? Al knows it in his brain. He has been sensible, doing the right things, holding back the crazy in his friends, knowing moderation. He has been healthy and sensible and the opposite of obsessed and extreme. It’s a good role and he’s been content with it.</p><p>“It’s just that even sensible people don’t always see the bad things”, Harry continues, “sometimes they come in disguise and look harmless, or even good.”</p><p>“This is not-“, Al starts, but he doesn’t even know what to say. “I’m just working at this café –uh, I guess it’s a bar at night. I mix drinks and take coffee orders.” He gestures wildly around the room. “Then I come home and make some-”, he falls short, his hands pointing at the canvases and the paper sketches around them. “There’s nothing bad about that.”</p><p>“There isn’t.”, Harry agrees, “but you’re isolating yourself. I don’t know why you’re doing it and maybe you don’t know that, either, but trust me when I say that nothing good can come from that. I’ve been there before. It’s not a good place and you don’t always realise you’re in it.”</p><p>Al crosses his hands in front of his body. “I’m not—sad, you know.”</p><p>“I know”, Harry says, quietly, “but maybe you will be.”</p><p>Al doesn’t know what to do with that.</p><p>“There’s another thing”, Harry adds, “I said that you are an adult and can make your own choices and I stand by that”, he started and Al could feel a headache creeping up his head already.</p><p>“There’s nothing wrong with working at the café and doing what you’re doing, I’m sure you’re applying yourself. But the things you are doing now, at this age, how you educate yourself further, the experience you get—that is going to be a base line for the rest of your life. And I don’t think you’ll want to be a waiter or a bartender in the muggle world forever, so I really think you should look into starting something new.”</p><p>Al sighs, then presses his hand over his forehead. “It’s not so easy”, he admits, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>“I know”, his father answers and Al wonders if he does know. Harry has been an auror all his life and before that he was saving the Wizarding World from an evil wizard, which isn’t that far off, career-wise, if you think about it. “Just promise me you’ll think about it.”</p><p>“I promise”, Al says, and well, now he is screwed, because if he says he is gonna do it he actually has to do it. He promised.</p><p>“Oh, and please come around to talk a bit to your mother and I.”</p><p>Al smiles. “I live here. I come around all the time.”</p><p>Harry winks at him. “You know what I mean.”</p><p>The next week, Al actively tries to be less of a loner. He actually gets around to visit Scorpius and Rose at their new flat. The place is tiny, but they seem almost disgustingly happy about it and Rose tells him about all the cutesy decorations she’s going to put up. Al has no idea where her sense for aesthetics came from, since neither Uncle Ron nor Aunt Hermione seem to have a knack for it, but he can see the glitter in Scorpius’ eyes as he shuffles around the room that is almost to small for his rollator. Al catches his eye and smiles. As usual, the two of them are disgustingly in love, but Al doesn’t feel any worse for it. Or lonely. In fact, it makes him feel better that they are there for each other and him and that they are working so hard to try and make the world a better place, both in their own way. In that moment, Al has no doubt that it’ll work.</p><p>True to his promise, Al tries to think about what it is that he wants to do. It’s not that he hasn’t thought about the topic before—it has just been something he preferred to avoid. Now, he couldn’t do that anymore.</p><p>It is a hard thing to think about because in a weird way, Al doesn’t want to be doing anything else. He always thinks he is on the brink of something, just on the verge of discovering something that will change everything. On the other hand, he has no clue what that might be.</p><p>So instead of thinking about what he wants to do, he thinks about what he wants to learn. There is so much magic still out there, so much they barely touched on in Hogwarts, so much more he could learn. It seems great, in theory, but when he actually thinks about it, it is hard for Al to pin down something he actually wants to know more about in more than an abstract capacity.</p><p>The thoughts of this dilemma keep turning around in his head, until about two weeks later. He is at Flourish &amp; Blotts, picking up a new book on contemporary wizarding artists and skimming through the pages. He’s meeting up with Scorpius for an after-work drink later today, but he still has a little time. Well, for Al, who’s working the evening shift today, it will actually be a before-work drink, but since Scorpius can’t safely drink anything stronger than a butterbeer anyway, it’s not much of a problem.</p><p>Al's fingers pause on a page that shows a portrait—in fact, it is a portrait of Albus Dumbledore, or at least a photo of it—the very portrait that graces the wall in Professor McGonagall’s office in Hogwarts. The portrait, Al realizes suddenly, it moves. It’s a weird thought. Al has been around magic portraits and photographs all his life, he knows them, knows about them, but this realization is different. <em>I want to know how to do this</em>, a voice says at the back of his mind. <em>This is what I want to learn. </em></p>
