    <p>After weeks of not talking face to face the boys would finally get to meet each other again. Harry desperately wanted to talk about, really everything, but mostly about three things: the Death Eaters, and if Draco was ok, the gifts Draco had sent him and about the Animagus book. They decided to meet in the astronomy tower after dinner on the second day back.</p><p>The Gryffindor was shaken out of his thoughts when he heard the gentle creak of the staircase, meaning that someone was coming up. He prayed that it would be his Slytherin.  Soon the platinum head came into view.</p><p>  "I see that you liked your gift," smiled Draco coming to sit next to Harry. A glint passed through Draco's eyes when he saw the small cat.</p><p>  "No Draco, I loved them," Harry saw a blush form on Draco's cheeks. He felt his heart skip a beat.</p><p>  "What did you name her?" Draco nodded at the cat.</p><p>  "Sage. Don't laugh!" Harry glared at Draco, which made him laugh even more.</p><p>  "That's an adorable name," said Draco once he stopped laughing at Harry, who smiled despite himself.</p><p>  "And the Bonifatus is wonderful. Honestly."</p><p>  "Have you kept the cut flowers? Good. When you need luck burn all of them.” For a moment there was silence.</p><p>  “How have you been after the attack…?” Harry trailed off. Draco looked down into his hands.</p><p>  “ I think it was my father. That one of those horrible horrible masks hid his face, "Draco's sad voice was barely a whisper," Hell, it could’ve been even him who tortured those poor people. No, it was <em>him, </em>“ Harry barely heard those last words. Silent tears streamed down Draco’s face. He shook his head. Harry wrapped his arms around the boy and pulled him close.</p><p>  “Shh it’s ok, it’ll be ok,” Harry promised himself to keep to that word. They stayed like that long after the slytherin's tears have dried: Draco was practically in Harry's lap as the boy gently rocked him.   </p><p>  "Ever given any thought of becoming an animagus?" Murmured Harry. Harry felt Draco's chuckle through his chest. It was an odly pleasant feeling.</p><p>   "Yeah. Kinda wanted to be one when I was younger. Now I know that it's super hard to become one and two that the books on them are quite hard to get. Why'd you ask?" Before Harry answered he reached out his arm to rummage through his school bag. He took out the blue hardback.</p><p>   "Remus Lupin, my godfathers' boyfriend , gave me this book on becoming animagus. My father was one, a stag. I was thinking if you would like to be an animagus with me?"</p><p>Draco sat up to look straight into Harry's eyes.</p><p>   "Harry James Potter are you asking me to become an <em>illegal </em> animagus?"</p><p>    "You don't have to if yo-"</p><p>    "Yes."<br/>     "What?" Harry asked, brows furrowing in confusion.</p><p>    "I would be honored to become an<em> illegal</em> animagus with you, Harry." Draco smiled at Harry.</p><p>   "Really?" Harry was happy and relieved that his friend agreed to become a animagus with, otherwise Harry might've not of become an animagui. Draco nodded in answer.</p><p>After that they decided their plan on the hard work of becoming animagui. Draco would steal- sneak out some ingredients from Snape's cupboard (since if he was caught he'd probably probably get away with it) and Harry would work on the charm work that would be involved. They started to talk about other things too: the use of some of Harry's presents, quidditch and of course the Triwizard Tournament. They went to their dorm rooms well past midnight, parting with a tight hug and a promise to meet as soon as possible.</p><p> </p>
