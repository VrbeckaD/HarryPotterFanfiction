    <p>                Harry cursed as he ducked behind the familiar stone arch. He was back to where he had first started getting real about fighting back. He’d lost his god-father here and now, before he was even old enough to drink he was going to die here. He knew it was going to happen, he just didn’t know how. He was’t going to lay down and let the people who had forced him to become a killer because they couldn’t handle their monster kill him. They wanted him dead because they feared that would become what he had fought against. He just wanted to live his own life, but that wasn’t possible, not ever again. He clutched at his necklace, which was the real fuck you in this.</p><p>                The people trying to kill him wouldn’t profit from his death. He had withdrawn everything he owned, after selling his properties, and all that was in his trunk which was shrunken around his neck. All of that would be coming with him when he made his next great adventure through the veil.  He wasn’t going to give them the choice on how he died. If there was a higher power, and if they had any mercy then he wouldn’t die and he would find Sirius. Other than that he had no plan other then getting through the veil that he was leaning on.</p><p>                “I expected more dignity from you that running and hiding Potter.” The man he had called best friend sneered. Harry snorted, holding his arm as it gave a stab of pain. He’d take care of it when he had a chance, hopefully when he didn’t die going through the veil. Weasley was a real bastard though, wanting to be the one who killed him. He really couldn’t’ believe that he’d thought of him as a friend at any point in time, not now.</p><p>                “Yeah, I’d like to see you facing being killed by the people who you called family once Weasel. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be standing still like an idiot waiting for the final blow, but i may be wrong.” He shouted back before taking a breath and turning the corner, jumping into the veil. A stunner hit him as he passed, making the world go dark, and stopping him from knowing if he’d wake up on the other side or not. He didn't even get to hear his once friend's reaction to his final insult.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>                When Howard Stark was faced with a robed stranger appearing in the middle of his home laboratory he wasn’t a surprised as most people would be. The distinct pop that accompanied his guest’s arrival indicated that the teen was a wizard. Said teen didn’t look more than 14 years of age so he was more worried than confused by his arrival. Even with the war reaching into the Wizarding world the children were not allowed to apperate on their own. Then he looked the boy over. There was visible damage done to the frail body, and signs of malnutrition, long term if he was correct, and he was out cold. He was careful when he picked the teen up, already making up his mind not to contact the wizards until his guest woke and told him what had happened.</p><p>               As he lay the boy in a guest bed a slim device fell out of the robe’s pocket. That was another oddity, considering wizards didn’t mess with muggle technology, even if they were muggleborn by birth. He should know because the one’s he’d met were still convinced that he was somehow magical because muggles couldn’t make what he did.  He’d almost gotten into a lot of trouble a time or two because of that, and only proving them wrong saved his sexy genius ass. Finding a piece of technology on the child was odd to say the least.</p><p>              He opened the object and jumped in surprise when a small screen popped up. The very thought of slimming the tech for the display screen down was astounding. Then he saw the date displayed on the contraption. He cursed as he looked at his out of place guest. The wizarding world was defiantly out of the question for the young wizard. If he was correct the protocol for time travel was imprisonment so the traveler couldn’t change events. There was no way in hell he was letting them throw a kid in jail for something that wasn’t his fault. </p><p>               He’d see what he could do about incorporating the kid into his world. Which was dangerous enough with the war and his part in it, but hell. He couldn’t throw the boy on his ass on the street now could he? It looked like he might just be becoming a daddy without all the fun parts, but he’d let sleeping beauty decide. He cleaned the kid up, and tending to his wounds, vowing that while it was in his power the teen wouldn’t ever end up in this condition again, and he intended on keeping that vow. Something told him the kid hadn’t had people looking out for him, not like he should have at least. Whatever situation the kid had come from wouldn’t happen again.</p><p>               Howard sighed as he closed the electronic device, before going to gather the things he would need to talk care of his young guest. He might as well get used to acting like a parent and taking care of his kid's injuries, because he had a feeling he wasn't really going to accept no when it came to his charge leaving. Bringing a large tub of warm water into the room, along with rags, anticeptic and bandages he got to work cleaning the kid up. His mind cataloged every injury and every scar, making note to get the names of the people who had had him before. He may be in the past now, but one day he could and would make these monsters pay. No one harmed a Stark and lived to tell the tale. </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>                When Harry woke up he was in a warm, comfortable bed, and he didn’t hurt too much. His throat was dry, but he was waking up which was more than he could have hoped for. Someone brushed something cold and wet over his forehead. He flinched and his caretaker sighed, but didn’t pause in his movements. Harry kept his eyes closed, trying to decide what to do, before he peeked an eye open. A handsome man was standing over him and the wet something on his head was a wash cloth. He opened the other eye and took in the room warily, wondering what the hell was going on.</p><p>               Well he was alive, and from the looks of the room and the man’s dress he was somewhere among the muggles and not in his own time. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. This could be bad if the Wizarding World found out. They didn’t take well to time travel of this magnitude. He’d be going to prison until he arrived in his time, and then he’d be right back where he started. The wash cloth was taken from his head gently and a hand turned his head.</p><p>              “Hey Green-Eyes. Don’t start panicking alright. When ever you came from doesn’t matter, and I won’t let the wand wavers know about you. I can tell you’ve been though hell, and there’s no way I’m going to let you go back to that.” The man next to him spoke up suddenly, his voice passionate, but gentle as if he didn't want him to panic. Harry snapped his eyes open again and winced, trying to figure out how this muggle- he couldn’t feel a magical core within the other man at all- knew that he was a wizard and what he was going to do about it. He was in another time with a muggle who knew he was a wizard- this could be very bad. His heart was trying to pound it's way out of his chest as the man looked exasperated by his reaction to his statement.</p><p>               “I’m not going to do anything to you Green-Eyes. In fact I’m promising you that I won’t let anything like what you ran away from happen to you again.” The man murmured his eyes gentle. “My name is Howard, Howard Stark. You’re in muggle New York City in America. There is a small magical community not far from here that we can establish an identity for you if you want that. If not I can make you an identity here in New York on the muggle side.” He added. Harry inhaled at the name. He knew muggle history- Dr. Stark was famous, but his son even more so. From the looks of the apartment he hadn’t gotten married yet, so there was no son yet, no wife either if he was reading the bachlor pad air correctly.</p><p>              “I’m Hadrian. British Wizard, but you already know the wizard part. I’ve read about you in the history books. I know what the consequences of time travel is, this wasn’t exactly what I expected to happen when I ran though.” He responded, his voice horse and reedy. Howard chuckled, brushing his hand over Harry’s forehead in a rather fathely gesture, one that made Harry even more nervous given that he had no experiance with him.</p><p>              “I know the wizard’s way of dealing with time travelers. I’m not letting them lock you up until you get back to your time and then have to deal with fines and whatever you were running from.” He responded, his voice feirce. Harry snorted at that, looking away and trying not to panic at the mention of what he had escaped from.</p><p>              “Why would you care? No one else has, so why would a complete stranger stick thier neck out for me?” He asked, his voice suddenly bitter. After what happened back home he didn’t trust this man. He had no reason to. A hand gripped his chin lightly and turned his face back towards the other man.</p><p>              “I look at you and I see a child who has been abused. Why shouldn’t I care? You ran from something and in running you ended up going into the past. I see no need for you to be punished for saving yourself. The only people who deserve to be punished are far out of my reach for now, but by god I will try and make sure they experiance hell without changing the timeline, as tempting as it seems.” He spoke, his words stern. Harry blinked in surprise. Just how young did Dr. Stark think he was? And did people’s morals change so much between wherever here was and the 90’s that the man actually noticed and cared about something that no one had even raised an eye about before? Stark’s smile was reassuring as he looked at him.</p><p>               “I don’t trust you.” Harry blurted out suddenly, because he didn’t know what to say to that. Stark chuckled, looking at him fondly.</p><p>               “I didn’t expect you to right away. Now I need to know how old you are so we can start making your identity, and get you into muggle school so you can have the credentials to build a life here. You don’t need to worry about money- I have more than I can spend in three lifetimes.” He replied, his eyes sparkling. Harry’s mouth dropped open in shock, and Stark smiled even wider. He swallowed hard.</p><p>                “How old do you think I am?” He responded.  Stark chuckled, sitting in a chair that Harry hadn’t noticed and looked over him with a professional eye. Harry resisted the urge to blush at the examination.</p><p>               “I’d say from looking at you 14 tops, but I’ve also noticed that you’ve suffered severe malnutrition long term so you could be as old as 18. Not that it will matter much. I’ll fib your age when I make your identity to give you a head start. I know that wizards don’t stay in touch with the mundane side so your education is probably severely lacking as a muggle, even if you were muggleborn.” He replied finally. Harry sighed, before sitting up.</p><p>                “I’m 17. I was raised by my squib Aunt and muggle Uncle when my parents were killed. You’ve noted that I wasn’t treated the best there. Both my parents were magical, but the magic world in England hasn’t been the best of shape for a long time. When I entered it I knew right away that I was going to have to have an out. No one gave a damn if I came to school covered in bruises and basically bones. I kept up my muggle education via correspondence courses, and entered university- again through correspondence courses. I’ve reached my Master’s in Physics and Chemistry. What is the year? I know I’m going to have to be careful about how much I let on I know.” He replied, his voice crisp. He had planned out his escape even before it became apparent that he wouldn’t be allowed to live in peace in the wizarding world. For some reason he didn’t want Stark to think he was helpless. Stark looked shocked for a moment, before his smile widened. He looked almost proud of Harry.</p><p>               “That I didn’t expect to hear. We’ll still fib on your age, just to get you used to the standards we use. It’s 1940 by the way kid.” He responded. Harry nodded hesitantly. Stark grabbed his hand and squeezed. “It’s not going to be easy, trusting people after what you went through, but it will be alright. I promise. You’ve done good kid, preparing to run by keeping your muggle education. It shouldn’t be hard for you to adjust to life here.” He added softly. Harry closed his eyes, sighing. His stomach growling interrupted the conversation and Stark chuckled.</p><p>               “I’ll run out and grab you something to fill that stomach of yours. We don’t have much time to try and feed you enough for you to grow, considering your 17. It’ll be liquid for the moment, but when I know your stomach will handle it I’ll feed you some solid foods. You’ll have a new identity by the end of the week at the latest. I hope you don’t mind becoming a Stark. That way if you slip up any with your previous knowledge people won’t bat an eye too much.” He chirped, standing up. Harry stared after him confused, not daring to hope that he was telling the truth about helping him. Only time could tell and if Stark tried anything he’d disappear plain and simple. He lay back down against the pillows and yawned, feeling tired again.</p>
