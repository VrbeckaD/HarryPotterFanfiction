    <p>"I know you’re screwing my fiancé."</p><p>Bellatrix whispers it on her ear, when she’s sitting at the piano, her voice as soft and deadly as poison. Andromeda’s eyes open wide and she knows she won’t be able to tell a single lie.</p><p>She turns around and meets her sister, who's bearing a smile Andie can only describe as smug.</p><p>"Bella…"</p><p>"Silly me. I thought you’d at least try to deny it."</p><p>Andromeda doesn’t answer. She couldn’t. She doesn’t even say ‘I’m sorry’.</p><p><em>She’s not sorry</em> </p><p>"Well, stop doing it" Bellatrix says, matter-of-factly "It’d be a terrible scandal, and we’re not a vulgar family to have such things."</p><p>"Bella, wait!" Andie calls, as her sister turns on her heels to leave "I never meant…"</p><p>"Never meant what?" Bellatrix cuts her, turning to stare Andromeda in the eyes "For it to have gone so far? Or for me find out? Honestly, you weren't exactly being discreet".</p><p>Andromeda’s face grows hot and she doesn't dare to meet her sister's gaze.</p><p>"I never meant to hurt you."</p><p>Bellatrix laughs. A soft, crystalline sound that’s nothing like her.</p><p>"Andie, please. Hurt me, over Rodolphus? You should know better than that".</p><p>There's a longe silence then. Andromeda thinks Bella will leave, but the older sister just stays there, gazing out the window, as if remembering a mildly fun history.</p><p><em>Andromeda thinks of smiles across dinner tables. Of talks at the corners of rooms when Bellatrix isn't around. Of not being</em> discreet.</p><p>"Why -" her throat is dry. Andromeda licks her lips and begins again "Why are you marrying him if you don’t love him?"</p><p>Bella pauses for a second, divided between incredulous and amused.</p><p>"Why, I wonder, would I ever marry someone I love? Honestly Andie, that’s not what marriage is about."</p><p>Andromeda swallows and turns to stare the piano keys. She tries to hide her expression, but Bella has her figured out in an instant.</p><p>"Oh. But <em>you</em> love him."</p><p>Her eyes are red and burning from holding back tears when she stares at her sister. Defying her. Bella just smiles.</p><p>"You poor thing. Your sister’s fiancé, Andie, honestly? And a man like Rodolphus? I thought he wasn’t your type."</p><p>"You don’t know anything about me" Andromeda snaps back, more defensive than she intended.</p><p>"I sure don’t" Bella sounds satisfied. Then she walks to the bench and sits across Andromeda "What I know is: whatever gleeful adventure the two of you were having, it’s over now. Whatever loving words you said to each other, forget them. He is my fiancé, no matter what are your feelings on the matter. And he won't, ever, be <em>yours</em>" she touches her younger sister’s face, gently "You knew, after all, that this was how it was going to end."</p><p>Andromeda doesn’t answer. But both Bella and her know that that is exactly what she’s going to do. Andromeda might be a lot of things, but stupid is not one of them.</p><p align="center">

  <em>When Rodolphus first smiled at her, she smiled back. There was a thrilling danger to him, that was not like anything Andromeda had ever done. At the time, Bella was off with Sirius, somewhere, doing Merlin knows what those two did together. Rodolphus didn’t mind. He knew marriage wasn't about love. Turned out he wasn’t really dangerous at all. Not around her, at least. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The first time they kissed, she felt like she could live like that forever, on the haze of neither of them being what they really were. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But no. Andromeda wasn’t stupid at all. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>She knew, since minute one, it was never meant to last. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Things like that never are.</em>
