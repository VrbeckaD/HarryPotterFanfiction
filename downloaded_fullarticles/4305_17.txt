    <p>(POV Change/Time Skip)</p><p> Chapter 1 </p><p>(Tom's POV)</p><p>100 years. It has been 100 years since my ascension to Emperor of the World. The world has drastically changed in that time. I have brought peace and prosperity, and created a bridge between the muggles and the magicals. Well mostly…</p><p>I let a sneer break out on my handsome face for a second as I thought of those who refuse to accept the changes I have made. Dumbledore. I scoff. What makes him think he knows best? He is just a senile old fool who no one in their right mind would pay attention to. But at least his followers haven’t been causing trouble lately. It is rather amusing to see them attempt to change a world that doesn’t want to be changed. Mostly. There are still some stupid bigoted muggles who “protest” my rule by refusing jobs, food and decent housing. I am glad that such stupidity is not contagious or else I would fear for the rest of the human race.</p><p>100 years...100 years has shown me how inconsequential people can be. I have seen my most faithful get married, have kids, grow old and die. And then their kids would repeat the process. But it still amuses me how alike they are to their predecessors. </p><p>The Malfoys act like peacocks always concerned with how they look. The Parkinsons all manage to breed banshees. The Blacks were always blurring the line between sanity and insanity. And the Princes were always grouchy, unpleasant people. But there is one thing they have in common.</p><p>“Your Majesty, this is my son….”</p><p>“My lord, I have a daughter who is very keen to meet you…”</p><p>“Your illustrious majesty, I must insist you meet my daughters…”</p><p>As if I would do anything with those fools. I am just lucky the general populace doesn’t know what I look like, else I could never leave the palace. I am already drowning in marriage proposals. Luckily they serve as adequate kindling for fires. </p><p>I sigh. Why didn’t I just apparate to the palace? Oh right. I want to delay working on the paper work that is surely waiting for me there for as long as possible. If it means taking one of my many magical cars on a short drive, well at least I use them occasionally.</p><p>I relax further into the plush leather seats.</p><p>Then my world went sideways. And I lost consciousness. </p><p>(A Couple Minutes later)</p><p>“Hello? Are you okay?” </p><p>When I opened my eyes I thought I was dead. Which is impossible because of my steps to immortality. But that was the only explanation I could come up with for the angel on top of me. </p><p>The first thing you notice was the eyes. A dazzling emerald green that reminds me of my favourite curse. Decorating the eyes are beautiful black lashes that match his silky black hair perfectly. I wonder what it would be like to touch his hair? His delicate face almost looks like it would break from a single touch. His sinful lips begging for attention. That shy smile shows off perfectly white teeth and shows off his innocence. Oh but his body, straight out of a models magazine, lithe and slightly small. The only real difference from a female was the lack of chest fats, notably called breasts. Finally his effeminate hands complete the picture of perfection. </p><p>“Beautiful,” I whisper staring at him.</p><p>“Sorry?” The angel asks. Salazar! Even his voice sounds like an angel’s.</p><p>“Nothing…” I reply. “May I inquire as to why you are hovering over me?” </p><p>“Oh” He blushes as he moves slightly away from me. I almost smirked as I saw it. He is definitely the most beautiful man I have ever met...myself notwithstanding. </p><p>“Um...well you were in a car accident and well..uh..I pulled you from the wreckage. Are you alright? It looked like a pretty bad crash.” He stated still blushing slightly.</p><p>“I feel fine.” A mere car crash wouldn’t harm me.</p><p>“Well an ambulance is on the way anyway so...Are you sure your head isn’t sore? It looks like you’re bleeding a bit from the head.” He asks worriedly.</p><p>“I am fine.” I say gritting my teeth ever so slightly.</p><p>“Would you like some water? I have some in my bag over there?” He asks as he points to a bag behind him. I raise an eyebrow at him. “Um...is that a yes..?” </p><p>He takes my silence as confirmation and turns around in a crouch giving me a nice view of his gorgeous ass. Realising the opportunity I have been given I use a couple of spells. Wandless and wordless, of course.</p><p>The spells showed me he is a carrier, which is a delightful bonus, and that he also has magic. I am slightly confused as to why he hasn’t used magic to assist him but before I can ponder this further he turns back around with a slightly puzzled face. </p><p>“Um..well here’s the water...Oh no wait let me help you sit up.” He says as I started to sit up. I almost rolled my eyes, honestly I am not helpless. Nevertheless if faking it keeps his body close to mine...well I won’t complain.</p><p>After taking a few sips of water I decided to start questioning the angel. Starting with… “May I know my dashing rescuers name?” I say with a small smirk.</p><p>His blush returned. “Ah...um..Harry, just Harry. And um...you are?”</p><p>“Thomas Marvolo Riddle, but you may call me Tom.” I try to stand up at this point but the angel...Harry’s arms are holding me down. </p><p>“Are you sure you can stand up?” He questions with a concerned look on his delicate face.</p><p>“Yes I am fine.” I sigh in exasperation. Harry assists me in standing up keeping his arm around me. I loved the feel of it.</p><p>“Er...Maybe we should wait for the ambulance?” Harry asks.</p><p>I scoff. “That will not be necessary.”</p><p>He bites his lip once again bringing it to my attention. Hmm…how do I get this luscious person on a date with me…? Oh!</p><p>“I wonder...might I take you out for dinner as a thank you for rescuing me from the crash?” I query.</p><p>“Um...well...I am very busy with work…” Harry stutters out. </p><p>“Surely you are not busy on a Saturday….say this coming Saturday?” I inquire politely.</p><p>“Um...er..no not really…” Comes his quiet reply.</p><p>“Then I shall see at the Le Canard de Chance over on Levier Road at 6 o’clock?” </p><p>“Ok,” he says softly. </p><p>I smile a little at him showing my natural charm that never fails. He blushes further. Seems it still doesn’t fail me. I hear ambulance sirens in the distance. Merlin! If it had been a fatal crash I would already have been dead, if I could die that is, for how long it took for them to get here. </p><p>“Well. I must really be leaving” and do something about reaction times for ambulances “So I shall thank you yet again for your help in retrieving me from the wreck” speaking of which how did the car crash anyway? “It was a great pleasure to meet you Harry and I shall see you at 6 o’clock on Saturday.”</p><p>“Wait but the ambulance…” Whatever else he said was drowned out by the near silent pop as I apparated back to one of my many palaces.</p><p> </p><p>Now back at the palace I let my masks drop. Since I have time, I decided to ponder the last thirty or so minutes. First off, the car crash. How did it happen? It’s a magical car. They have safety measures in place to prevent crashes. It is standard in every car, even more muggle models, removing the possibility for human error. So that means...sabotage. Which obviously means the Order. Dammit, I jinxed myself!</p><p>But it isn’t the worst thing in the world. It allowed me to meet that angel.</p><p>I smirk at the thought of the date with Harry on Saturday. Seems my schedule just got cleared. Maybe for the next few months as well. Oh yes...Harry is going to be mine. Not any of those gold diggers who don’t even know my real name or what I look like, who throw themselves at me asking me to “bear their children”. Nor the sons and daughters of my elite who I am so generously introduced to. No. Harry shall be my consort. I can guarantee it.</p>
