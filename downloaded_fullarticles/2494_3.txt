    <p>Natalya took a sip of her black tea—two sugars and splash of milk—as she regarded the young girl across from her. Lilli took her tea black which was at odds with her personality—the girl was sweeter than anyone Natalya had met. They both enjoyed sweets but Lilli seemed to gravitate towards more bitter desserts like coffee cake and such. Perhaps it was something she picked up from her older brother or perhaps it was because Lilli needed to balance out all the sweetness in her soul for something bitter. It would certainly explain why Natalya consumed desserts as though they were necessary as air.</p>
<p>They had been talking about a book that Lilli had lent to the older Belarusian woman—<em>Roadside Picnic</em>—before Lilli suddenly asked, “did Mr. Jones tell you that he and Ivan are now official? He said he was afraid to tell you personally,” she said before letting out a small laugh—probably, at the idea that the boisterous blonde was afraid of someone as delicate looking as Natalya.</p>
<p>Natalya took a sip of tea to mask her grimace. She had no idea what the hell Ivan saw in Alfred, that loud, obnoxious American. “I do not see it lasting. They are both complete opposites,” she muttered. Their constant Cold War surely indicated that it wouldn’t last long.</p>
<p>Lilli tilted her as she regarded the statement, her short blonde hair falling onto her face before she pushed it back. “But don’t you think we’re opposites, Natalya? And we get along well.” She looked at Natalya before glancing. Even now, she was still bad at making eye-contact with Natalya.</p>
<p>The Belarusian paused and thought about it. True, they seemed as though they were opposites—Lilli was shy but caring and kind. Natalya, on the other hand, didn’t care much for other people that weren’t Ivan or Yekaterina—her older brother and sister. She’d rather stay inside and read old Russian literature by herself—the books were often as bitter and depressing as her soul. Lilli, on the other hand, enjoyed tea parties with her friends and preferred science fiction. But it wasn’t the same. They managed to bridge their differences in their own way. Literature was a shared common ground between the two. Lilli enjoyed Russian science-fiction which tended to have the dreary atmosphere Natalya enjoyed. They would meet up and discuss the books they shared and talk about it for hours. The Belarusian woman would put up with the occasional tea party with several other people if it made Lilli happy.</p>
<p>“We may be different, but we do have similarities.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think Mr. Jones and Ivan work like that too? I’m sure they have common interests, too.”</p>
<p>Natalya’s frown deepened. She remembered their shared interest in space and star-gazing trips. “Even so—“</p>
<p>“Are you worried that he won’t care for you anymore?” Lilli asked suddenly. She wasn’t one to interrupt people but it seemed that this time she had a point to make. She ducked her head, as though she was abashed to bring up the topic but at the same time, she didn’t attempt to take back her words</p>
<p>Natalya didn’t respond.</p>
<p>Lilli set down her cup of tea and toyed with the edge of her skirt before she reached out for Natalya’s hand. The older woman acquiesced easily as she hardly ever objected to holding hands with Lilli.</p>
<p>“I think they’d be good for each other.” She said softly.</p>
<p>Natalya sighed softly and turned Lilli’s hand over. She stroked the insides of the other girl’s wrist. She traced the faint veins with feather-like touches. They were slim and dainty and not unlike her own—perhaps another similarity between the two, but surface level traits didn’t mean much. Not when Natalya was too selfish to ever be there for Lilli. She wasn’t a good enough friend for the younger woman, simply dragging her along her own pace.</p>
<p>Natalya could feel the air shift. “They are still very different. A few common interests aren’t enough to sustain a relationship.” They weren’t only talking about her brother’s relationship here, were they?</p>
<p>“True—it could fall apart. But it’s not as though they would know without trying. Haven’t you considered that their differences could make up for they’re each missing?”</p>
<p>The platinum blonde woman’s fingers were still clutched around the other’s wrists as she played with the red sleeves. Getting bolder, she let her fingers wander, tracing patterns in the shorter woman’s skin—nonsensical patterns, really.</p>
<p>Natalya let out a soft huff. “I suppose so,” she conceded and Lilli let out a shaky breath. Natalya glanced up in confusion and saw Lilli’s flushed pink face and gentle smile. Her own face turned pink as she realized what she was doing. She was about to pull her hand away before the younger took her hand with both of her hands.</p>
<p>“Natalya, I like you.” Lilli said seriously but her confession was undermined with her red face. She was only able to hold eye-contact for a bit before she started blinking and looking everywhere else. “I-I really, really like you. Um, if you—if you, um…will you…”</p>
<p>Natalya waited for her to continue. To say Natalya was surprised by the confession was an understatement. Perhaps not on the sentiment itself but rather the fact that Lilli actually went through with it. They never voiced the underlying current of intimacy between the two of them until, well, now. It was almost an unspoken rule between the two. But seeing Lilli push that admittedly illogical rule aside, well, Natalya couldn’t help admire her. When it was clear that this confession had taken everything out of Lilli and thus wasn’t able to continue, Natalya considered her words.</p>
<p>She had her reservations about entering a relationship but……</p>
<p>“Perhaps two that are opposites would work well in a relationship. We cannot tell until we test it out, as you said.” Natalya said unsurely. But it was clear that these were the right words as Lilli perked up and nodded shyly. Natalya smiled. She took her other hand and squeezed Lilli’s hands. Lilli smiled right back at her.</p>
