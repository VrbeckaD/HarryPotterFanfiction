    <p>Percival Graves sent a powerful lightning spell towards his opponent, incapacitating the woman, and managed to take two steps before he was forced to fend off another wizard. They were crawling out of woodwork now! There had to be at least twenty of them at that moment!</p>
<p>The rumors had to be true then; this tall building was indeed where the artifact Grindelwald wanted was kept!</p>
<p>“Theseus!” He called out to the man fighting nearby, “Back to back!”</p>
<p>The two made their way towards each other, deflecting and returning spell-fire, until they were indeed back to back, making it impossible for sneak attacks, and they moved in a slow circle while sending off countless spells to keep the enemy at bay.</p>
<p>After weeks of following the artifact’s trail, they were finally battling Grindelwald’s minions. A trail which had lead them to an eerie and desolate city in Belgium. It was as if every No Maj there had suddenly vanished without a trace…</p>
<p>A short distance away, Credence was shooting spells with his wand as well, but he was up against three other wizards and withdrawing under their barrage. He ended up with his back against the building, trapped, and the three approached with murderous glee.<br/>Credence sent them a nervous look. “Please, don’t…”</p>
<p>The tallest wizard lifted his wand, ready to fire it, but paused when he saw the corner of Credence’s lovely mouth tug at a slight smile.</p>
<p>When the darkness exploded towards them, only one of the three had time to scream.</p>
<p>Inside the building, at the top floor, Makarov was running. Spells were flying around him. Lightning kept crackling too close for comfort and the heat of fire spells were even closer, so he kept running. <br/>In his right hand, Vasiliy was clutching his wand, but in his left; he was holding a small orb. It was one of the key ingredients for Grindelwald to make his dreadful Inferi army. Without the orb, his undead army would not rise.</p>
<p>Crossing his arms protectively in front of his face, Makarov closed his eyes, leaped forward and burst through the window he had been aiming for.</p>
<p>As he fell, he opened his eyes and inhaled sharply; instinctive fear jolting through him due to the height, but then the shadows below came alive and the Obscurus was racing up against him. He fell and was engulfed by the darkness.</p>
<p>On the ground, Theseus glanced back at Percival over his shoulder, grinning widely with the tip of his tongue poking out. “He did it!”</p>
<p>Graves rolled his eyes, flicking a spell. “Fine. So he didn’t mess it up. I stand corrected, okay?” He absently summoned a wandless magic with his left hand to take care of an overly confident wizard to his left and then he was the one to smile; at the sight of the massive Obscurus now heading their way. “Buckle up. Our ride is coming.”</p>
<p>Whining, Theseus tensed up a little. He was still getting used to traveling by dark magic and the Obscurus was a little too fond of sniffing around him in this shape; as if sensing a prey but unable to find it as long as Theseus kept calm. Theseus had never been fond of playing chicken, even as a child!</p>
<p>Wizards were flung away when the Obscurus ploughed through them on its way towards Percival Graves and Theseus Scamander. It snarled furiously as a spell hit it, but it didn’t change course. It washed over the two, and when the darkness shot off towards the sky again; all that remained on the ground were Grindelwald’s terrified followers.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Hours later, Makarov walked into the living room of the luxury apartment Graves had spell-cast some poor civilian into believing he’d rented out to them. Some of the attacks had indeed come too close and he’d been forced to both shower and change clothes to get rid of the singed smell.</p>
<p>In the sofa, Theseus sat, or slumped was more accurate, and rested his head on Percival Graves’ shoulder. Graves was holding up the orb with his left hand, studying it, and absently carded the fingers on his other hand through Theseus’ hair in slow, repetitive movements.</p>
<p>Vasiliy hesitated for one moment, but eventually walked over and found his place on Theseus’ other side. He’d barely sat down before Theseus tugged him over and Makarov ended up stretching out on the sofa with his head in Theseus’ lap. The light touches to his hair and face made him almost drowsy…</p>
<p>“So what do we do with it?” Theseus asked, referring to the orb.</p>
<p>Graves sighed. “We need to hide it somewhere safe.” He clenched his hand into a fist around it. “He may not have the Resurrection Stone yet, but he can still use this for a whole bunch of dark rituals.”</p>
<p>“Why not destroy it?” Vasiliy asked, half asleep.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we can,” Graves admitted. “This is powerful magic. And even if we manage, I have no idea what will happen to the magic inside it. We might unleash something even worse.”</p>
<p>“So we’ll drop it into the ocean,” Theseus declared, trailing a finger along Vasiliy’s jawline before he scouted towards the kitchen area. “Think he’s done yet?”</p>
<p>Credence had vanished into the kitchen to conjure up their dinner and they were all banned from entering until he invited them. This because of previous incidents which had ended in several alpha-fights between Vasiliy and Graves and Theseus nearly killing himself with a potato peeler.</p>
<p>They had offered to split the kitchen duty separately and evenly, but that barely lasted a couple of weeks. Makarov only knew how to make basic army meals, while he saw nothing wrong with that; Graves had loudly claimed he was trying to poison them all. Theseus would only make fish and chips, insisting they contained all five food groups growing men needed. Graves kept insisting on dragging them to far too expensive restaurants instead of actually making something himself.  In the end, Credence had kicked them all out and claimed dominance over that particular room. And nobody wanted to challenge an angry Obscurial.</p>
<p>“He’ll let us know when he’s done,” Graves stated, and as if he had hear them; that was when Credence did call out for them.</p>
<p>The trio made their way into the kitchen and Theseus made a beeline for Credence, who was standing with his back towards them and waving his wand to keep the three spoons in the different pots stirring. Theseus wrapped his arms around the waist of the younger man and rested his chin on his shoulder to peer down at what he was making. “You need to dump Percy and marry me, Credence. That smells absolutely divine!”</p>
<p>Flushing slightly, Credence failed to hide a flattered smile. “If only you could cook as well as you smooth-talk, Mr. Seuska.”  He then turned beet red and fanned Theseus away when the Englishman smirked and declared he was talented, oh so talented, in other areas.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>They ate, talked about the day, what had gone right and what could be improved. <br/>Credence tensed up a little when they began talking about what to do next. As much as he rejoiced in their success that day, as much as it pleased him to know they had messed up Grindelwald’s plans, Credence was also painfully aware of that their luck wouldn’t last forever.</p>
<p>They had dodged everything which Grindelwald had thrown at them, gotten away with blatantly breaking Ministry rules in several countries; their luck was bound to run out sooner or later. Eventually, consequences would catch up with them, if they didn’t quit while they were ahead.</p>
<p>When they had withdrawn to their respective rooms, Credence sat on the bed, waiting for Percival to emerge from his regular evening-routine of wooing his mirrored reflection in the bathroom. Once he did emerge, changed into his silk pajamas and with newly washed hair, he sent Credence a puzzled look. Usually the young man would be a snoozing lump under the sheets by now.</p>
<p>“Something wrong, Credence?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he admitted. “It’s just…”</p>
<p>“Just what?” Percival walked over and sat down next to him. “Talk to me.”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you noticed?” Credence began, nervously wringing his hands and staring at the floor. “Nothing good ever lasts. Bad stuff always follows, whenever we think we’re safe, whenever we push our luck…” He drew a sharp breath and turned to look at Percival. “If we keep going like this, we’re going to burn.”</p>
<p>Frowning, Percival reached up to draw a calming hand over Credence’s hair. “I know.”</p>
<p>Strangely relieved, Credence leaned into his touch. Of course Percival knew. </p>
<p>“But it’s either this, or we keep running and looking over our shoulder for the rest of our lives,” Percival explained quietly. “Gellert won’t leave us alone, we both know that. And if we can take him down, we might have something to bargain with when it comes to the MACUSA. We won’t be allowed back, but if we hand them a victory, they might be persuaded to leave us alone.” He sighed. “It’s not much, I agree. Most likely it won’t make a difference to them. So… want to run? I got no problem with running. Whatever you want, I’ll make it happen.”</p>
<p>Credence considered it and ended up shaking his head with a defeated sound. “No, I…” He knew why Percival kept pushing now. It was a weak hope, but it was the only hope they had. Keep running and they would end up exhausted, paranoid and tearing each other apart. He didn’t want that. He wanted that hope. “I want to fight.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? You could go back to Greece. Wait for me there and I’ll come back to you. To be honest, I’d be relieved if you did. You and Theseus. You’d both be safe, for a while. I’ll bring the Russian. Maybe Gellert will turn him into something nasty, if I’m lucky.”</p>
<p>Snorting a weak laugh, Credence bumped his shoulder against Percival’s. “Shut up. Vasiliy is nice. Really nice. You could learn a lot from him.”</p>
<p>Huffing, clearly insulted, Percival pushed him back on the bed and crawled up to hover over him. “Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Credence insisted, fighting against a smile and the instinctive thrill of having a predator pinning him down. “And I’m not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The next day, they packed up and headed out. </p>
<p>Makarov gritted his teeth so hard it hurt when they passed the Manneken Pis and Graves remarked how it was the mirrored image of the Russian. (One day he would get his horrible revenge on that horrible American… One day!)</p>
<p>Theseus, fighting desperately against the urge to laugh, tried to soothe the man’s ruffled feathers by loudly stating that he knew for a fact that Vasya was indeed MUCH larger. Especially in a very important area!</p>
<p>Credence decided at that moment to create some distance between himself and the others, fearing he’d die of embarrassment if he didn’t. </p>
<p>They were crossing the Grote Markt when the smugness left Percival and fierce unease took its place.<br/>He glanced over at Theseus, made eye contact, and the smile vanished from the Englishman’s face as well; clearly picking up his unease. They scouted their surroundings and quickly found reasons to be worried. Theseus nudged the Russian and whispered something, making him tense up as well.</p>
<p>Percival discretely let his wand slide out of his sleeve and into his hand.</p>
<p>Once he saw Theseus and Makarov were armed as well, he let out a low whistle to catch Credence’s attention. The young man had been gawking at the amazing buildings and had completely failed to pick up on the dangers. Now he sent Percival a quizzical look.</p>
<p>Knowing they would have very little time once he revealed that he knew, Graves braced himself and got ready for a fight. “Credence. Go Obscurus, get out of here. Now!”</p>
<p>No sooner had he shouted the words did every other person in the market pull out wands. Some stunned the No Majs unlucky enough to be there to get them out of the way, while others began setting up a shield to encapsulate the area and trap the startled Credence, who instinctively went into his Obscurus shape and shot up into the sky.</p>
<p>All hell broke loose. Spells were flying to and from everywhere. Percival had to dive down to avoid being hit, rolled across the ground and shot back at some random wizards before getting up again. He kept moving, kept firing and deflecting spells, while trying to keep an eye on Theseus and Makarov as well. So far, they were standing their ground, but there were too many people surrounding them. Thirty? Forty?</p>
<p>A loud crackle of energy caught his attention for a moment and Percival cast a quick glance up at the sky. What he saw made his heart drop inside his chest.</p>
<p>The shield had closed over the market place before the Obscurus could escape and now it strained helplessly against the barrier. <br/>They were trapped.</p>
<p>Turning his attention to his surroundings again, Graves assessed the situation. They were trapped inside the dome. There were at least forty wizards in the marked, far more than he and the other two could handle. The Obscurus could probably take on a whole bunch of them, but it still hadn’t recovered fully from the light attack and he had no idea how much damage it could take before Credence would be in trouble. Another problem was the fact that these were Ministry agents, not Gellert’s people, which meant that killing them was not an option…</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Percival Graves!” A voice called out.</p>
<p>Percival deflected a spell and glanced to the left to find a woman standing with a confident pose and her entire focus on him; her prey. She had thick blonde hair to her shoulders, brown eyes, and a powerful wand in her hand. “On behalf of the British Ministry, you are under arrest!”</p>
<p>Sneering, Percival send off a spell that made the man next to her crumble. “The British Ministry? Fawley sent you?”</p>
<p>“My name is Leona Silvestri,” the woman replied. “Surrender voluntarily or I will make you.”</p>
<p>It was a name Percival knew well. The Auror they sent to chase down rogue agents and who had yet to fail a mission. Damn…<br/>Why the hell had Fawley sent his prized hunter after them? <br/>“Sorry,” Percival lifted his wand. “You will have to tell your boss I’m busy. I have to deal with Gellert first, then I’ll come back for Fawley!”</p>
<p>Leona was strong, really strong, and he had to concentrate to keep her at bay and also be alert of back attacks from her cronies. He suffered a couple of hits, clenching his jaw against the jolts of pain, but kept his main focus on her. She was the dangerous one</p>
<p>He heard the Obscurus roaring, slamming against the barrier, swatting away the Aurors closest to it, and it hurt to know there was nothing he could do to aid it. Percival felt even more helpless when he caught a glimpse of Theseus collapsing after a double hit, forcing Makarov to step in to protect him.</p>
<p>In a regular duel, Percival would have won. Leona was strong, but she was still no match to him. However, with her henchmen sniping at Graves at any chance they got, sneaking in hits and depleting him, he was soon struggling to keep up.</p>
<p>Eventually Makarov was hit hard and collapsed next to Theseus. Aurors swarmed them and kept them down.</p>
<p>Leona gave a cruel smile. “Your friends are down, Mr. Graves.” She was panting and sweating after the strain of their battle, but she was nowhere near done. “They can’t help you.” She cast a lightning spell that he deflected. “You can’t defeat us all. Surrender now, make Barebone stand down and we won’t have to destroy him.”</p>
<p>Anger flared up and Percival went after her. No one threatened Credence. No one!</p>
<p>Percival managed to drive her back, even made her blink under his barrage, but he kept being hit by her cronies. He could feel his strength being drained. “Touch him and I swear I will fucking kill you!”</p>
<p>When Leona and five others all hit him with spells at the same time, Percival Graves didn’t hear himself scream. But Credence did.</p>
<p>“Stop!” The last thing Percival saw before he passed out was Credence, in his human shape, standing in front of him, between him and Leona, calling out; “Stop hurting him!”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Wake up!”</p>
<p>Theseus groaned as he slowly fought his way back to the real world. It was as if there was an angry swarm of bees inside his head. What had happened? He didn’t remember…</p>
<p>But then the memories came rushing back. Brussels, the fight in the market place!<br/>He opened his eyes and found himself staring up at a vaguely familiar face. A woman. What was her name? Piperita! She worked at the Ministry in London, guarding the prisoners they had in for questioning. </p>
<p>“Wake up, Scamander,” Piperita repeated, sharper now.</p>
<p>Theseus sat up, fighting waves of nausea and jolts of pain. His body was battered. “What…?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Fawley wants a word with you,” Piperita said. Her eyes were cold and her mouth a tight line.</p>
<p>Trying to shake off the haze that made him sluggish, Theseus glanced around and realized he was in one of the cells beneath the Ministry. He was back in London. What was going on?<br/>He got up on his feet, somewhat unsteadily, and followed Piperita out of the cell. Theseus scanned the surroundings, hoping to catch a glimpse of the others, but he saw no one.</p>
<p>Eventually he entered one of the interrogation rooms and found Hector Fawley sitting there. Resisting the urge to punch him in the face, Theseus walked over and sank down on the other side of the table from the man. His body was so tired! “Mr. Fawley. Care to explain what I’m doing here?”</p>
<p>“You, Mr. Scamander, and your band of hooligans, are wanted for murder.”</p>
<p>“What?” The fog disappeared completely and Theseus was suddenly wide awake. “Is this a joke?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” Fawley replied, sliding over the wanted poster with his photo and details. Wanted for the murder of Viberus Nadder.</p>
<p>Shock and disbelief hit Theseus even harder. “The man was a psychotic murderer! He killed Regina Broadchurch and the Polish girl! We tried to apprehend him, he fought back and we had to defend ourselves!”</p>
<p>Fawley shrugged. “We have no evidence that connects him to the Broadchurch woman or that he even touched the Obscurial girl. What we do have is his healer, who swears the man was cured, and a whole lot of Aurors who saw Graves’ beast tear Nadder apart in front of their very eyes.”</p>
<p>“His healer is under the Imperius Curse! He tried to kill Credence Barebone on Nadder’s order, remember?” If anybody was a beast, it was Nadder!</p>
<p>“According to an Obscurial, your brother and a dead woman. Not the strongest evidence I’ve heard of!” Fawley sighed and shook his head. “You people have been causing me nothing but headaches and problems since that waterfront incident. Surely you did not expect to get away with the things you’ve been doing? Blatantly breaking rules left and right in eight countries, can you imagine my embarrassment? A British Auror gone rogue, dragging with him a MACUSA traitor, an Obscurial and a Russian defector? This simply cannot be endured, Mr. Scamander. It shall not!”</p>
<p>Theseus leaned forward, desperate to make him understand. “But we got results! We discovered more about Grindelwald’s organization and ruined more of his plans in six months than we did here in London over two years! We are trying to prevent a war, Fawley!”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” Fawley huffed. “People keep making Gellert Grindelwald into the bogeyman, but I won’t be fooled. He’s a criminal, but that’s all. Nothing more, nothing less. And criminals must be punished.”</p>
<p>Theseus leaned back in his chair, swallowing hard. <br/>He knew what happened to wizards convicted for murder in England…</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Percival woke up in pain and wearing magic blockers in the shape of some very unfashionable bracelets on his wrists. It took him two seconds to go from dizzily confused to awake and seething with fury.<br/>He didn’t take much longer to recognize his surroundings as a holding cell back in London either. The Aurors had brought them back to England. That did not bode well…</p>
<p>Hours passed and Percival was left to pace his cell in solace. He was worried about the others, but knew no one would appear before it suited them. Graves had used the stalling tactic himself plenty times when he had prisoners he wanted to break.</p>
<p>Finally there was the sound of approaching footsteps and Percival steeled himself.</p>
<p>The door opened and he was slightly surprised to see Leona Silvestri there. She raised her eyebrows at the sight of him, as if she was impressed that he was up on his feet already, but there was still an unmistakable coldness to her eyes. </p>
<p>“The others?” Percival asked.</p>
<p>“Alive,” Leona replied. She tilted her head and studied him. “The infamous Percival Graves. You’re every bit as strong as they said you’d be.”</p>
<p>Graves knew it wasn’t a compliment, merely an observation. “So what happens now?”</p>
<p>“What happens to all criminals, you get locked away.”</p>
<p>“You know that’s a mistake,” Percival stated. “Fawley might not want to realize it, but a war is coming. Gellert Grindelwald is building his army and he will come for you all. There will be no mercy for those who oppose him.”</p>
<p>Leona did not seem worried. “If Grindelwald attacks, I will be the one who shows no mercy.” She shook her head a little. “You were the second in command of the MACUSA. You’re a direct descendant of one of the original Aurors. What happened to you?”</p>
<p>Percival Graves smiled like a razor blade. “I woke up.”</p>
<p>“Your escort will be here within the hour,” Leona studied him a final time. “I doubt we’ll meet again. Goodbye Percival Graves.”</p>
<p>“Until next time,” Percival replied, watching as she closed the door behind her. </p>
<p>He knew it would be pointless to ask her for more information on the others. As much as it tore him up inside not knowing, Percival knew he had to wait. Someone further down on the food chain, someone less experienced than Silvestri, might give up some information.</p>
<p>As usual, Percival was right. When two Aurors came to guide him out of the Ministry, he was able to learn what had happened to the others. He almost wished he hadn’t.</p>
<p>Credence was to stay behind in the Ministry to ‘aid’ them in their research of his unique abilities, while Graves, Scamander and Makarov were to serve their lifetime sentences for the murder of Viberus Nadder; in Azkaban.</p>
