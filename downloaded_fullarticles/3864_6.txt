</center><p> </p><p>Harry, Chis, John, Max, Frank, and Skull walked into a pub. Harry ordered a Cider, Chris a draft, Max a Lager, John didn't care, Frank couldn't decide so ordered a 'Car Bomb' and Skull just wanted to drink himself to death.</p>

</center><p>"I'm glad you picking him up. He's only been here a couple of hours." The bartender explained as Fon tiredly waved his credit card, it was only the first stop at o'dark thirty in the morning. Hibari's Hibird would have committed murder before dawn for less.</p><p>"He finally cracked. He drunk text my phone. I tracked him to a biker bar with a 4 digit tab. A stunt-clown lost a bet and footed the bill."<br/>
<br/>
It was a rare glimpse behind the Sun's impenetrable persona. A wounded posture and expression Fon had never seen before. Reborn was slouched in the shadows and looked haunted.  A chip in the chaos armor while everyone else was away; chased remnants of Skull's past and problems. </p><p>Skull really was broken - He kept switching seats and mixing his drink. He was talking and responding to himself in different names, languages, and accents. He even had widely different gestures and mannerisms! </p><p>
"Dude, who's that?"<br/>
"Fon! You're Here!"<br/>
"Longwei. A cider?"<br/>
"Guys, it's Mr. Chameleon!"<br/>
"Not a lizard, that's Reborn too!"<br/>
"Sensei-sama!! My friends are here!!"</p><p>"Is he an actor?" The bartender chattered. "He's quite good! What plays has he been in..." </p><p>Needless to say, the bartender never got the truth.</p><p> </p>
