          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Lily, don’t do it!” a girl’s voice shrieked across the near-deserted playground, as a young red-haired girl swang higher and higher.</p><p>A skinny pale boy in old-fashioned worn clothes watched covertly from a clump of bushes as the girl launched herself into the air at the apex of her swing and floated gently to the ground like thistledown.</p><p>Petunia scowled, hands on her hips. “I told you not to!”</p><p>“But I’m fine,” giggled Lily. “I love magic!”</p><p>“There’s no such thing. It’s… something else,” sniffed Petunia. “I’m sure there’s a rational explanation for it.”</p><p>They’d thought they were alone in the park, but the boy crept out of hiding at her dismissive words. “It <em>is</em> magic. And you’re… you’re a witch.” He gazed at the pretty young redhead in shy admiration, a faint blush staining his pale cheeks.</p><p>Petunia shrieked, recoiling away from him in shock at the surprise of his sudden appearance, or perhaps his words. “How dare you say such a thing! You have no idea what you’re talking about, we didn’t do anything odd!”</p><p>Lily was also startled, but not as scared as her sister. “No I’m not!” she said, shaking her head with a small smile. “And that’s not a nice word to call someone. You should be more polite.”</p><p>“It’s alright, you <em>are</em> a witch. But there’s nothing wrong with that. My mum’s one, and I’m a wizard,” he said to her, dark eyes gazing intently into her green ones. “I thought you believed in magic?”</p><p>“Rubbish,” said Petunia, but she sounded unconvincing in her avowal. “He’s that Snape boy from Spinner’s End, Lily. He’s just making fun of us - just ignore him.” Petunia stalked over to grab her little sister’s hand, but Lily seemed reluctant to leave, dragging her feet.</p><p>“Don’t go! I’ll show you my magic too – we’re the same, you and I!” Severus called.</p><p>Lily turned her head to watch him over her shoulder as they left, and called back, “I <em>do</em> believe in magic. But I’m not a witch. It’s my sister, Tuney. She always catches me when I jump.”</p><p>“Shh!” Petunia hissed. “What have I told you about talking to people about that stuff? Come on Lily, we’re leaving.” She tugged firmly on Lily’s hand, and the little girl followed her obediently this time.</p><p>Severus watched them leave, slack-jawed in shock.</p><p>-000-</p><p>Two children sat in the shade of a small thicket of trees next to a sunlit river as they discussed their future.</p><p>“So Hogwarts is real? It’s not a joke? My sister doesn’t want me to go – she wants us to go to school together. She says she’ll miss me.”</p><p>“It’s real for us,” said Severus. “Not for her. We’ll get the letters, you and me. You’ll get yours first, and I should get mine the year after. We’ll learn all about magic. Ignore your sister. She’s jealous. She’s ordinary, and you’re special,” Severus said quietly.</p><p>“Maybe you’re right. She <em>has</em> been a bit jealous,” Petunia said thoughtfully, looking rather smug at the notion. “I will miss her though. Won’t you miss your family?”</p><p>Severus just scowled, then grudgingly admitted, “I’ll miss my mum. But… you’ll be there. That helps.”</p><p>“I’m glad.” Petunia grabbed his hand and gave it a brief squeeze before letting go, looking embarrassed. “It helps me, too.”</p><p>They looked shyly away from each other.</p><p>-000-</p><p>The train whistled piercingly in warning – it was almost time for the Hogwarts Express to leave, and Petunia still wasn’t aboard.</p><p>Mr and Mrs Evans gave their daughters a little privacy for their farewells, chatting with other parents on the platform. Lily clung to her big sister, sniffling wetly against her shoulder. “It’s not fair. I want to go too. I wish I could learn magic. And… I’ll miss you, Tuney. You’re away <em>all year </em>learning spells, and the summer went by too quickly. You’re so lucky!”</p><p>Petunia smiled, proud to have something so <em>special</em> about her that her little sister – so cute, so smart, everyone’s darling – was still so envious about. She patted Lily’s back and rubbed it in comforting circles. “I’ll miss you too. I’m sorry you didn’t get a Hogwarts letter this year like Severus did.”</p><p>“I wish I had,” Lily sighed, pulling away gently and gazing longingly at the bright red steam train. “But I haven’t done anything magical at all. Not the slightest thing, and I’ve tried <em>ever</em> so hard. Well, you’d better go, Tuney. Severus is waving for you from the carriage door, and he’s starting to look cross.”</p><p>Petunia turned to glance towards the train and gave her friend a little wave, which brought a small smile to his sallow face. “Well, I promised to sit with him and watch out for him. I think he’s a bit nervous, though he doesn’t like to admit it. He might have had trouble in Muggle primary school, but he won’t have any problems with bullies at Hogwarts with <em>me</em> around. I’m a second year now, you know!” she said proudly. “I know loads of spells. He’s not making a face because he's mad at you Lily, he just doesn’t want me to miss the train, I think.”</p><p>“You’ll remember to write, won’t you?” Lily begged. “Send letters with your owl? You must tell me all about your classes! You’ll miss me, won’t you?”</p><p>“Of course,” Petunia said gently. “I sent lots last year, didn’t I? I’ll miss you terribly. We’re not just sisters, we’re best friends.”</p><p>“Always?”</p><p>“Always.”</p></div>
