    <p>“It is about <em>diplomacy! </em>” Hermione Granger gritted her teeth, trying to explain the concept yet again to her long time fiance, Ronald Weasley, in the living room of their flat. One would think he would understand by now. She had only been working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation for ten years. </p><p> </p><p>Ron had struggled to find a purpose following the Second Wizarding War. He decided against following Harry into the Auror program or even putting the effort into a Quidditch career. He was more interested in his newfound fame than any long term plans, drinking in the attention, even as the papers pestered him for insight into what came next. His future did come to him in a roundabout way, a mixture of chance and impulsive words.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve always been good at Wizard’s Chess,” He had slurred slightly at a reporter, buzzed and caught unawares leaving a pub from an afternoon watching Quidditch with Harry. “I’ll just do that.” He had chuckled and apparated home to the flat he shared with Hermione. Imagine his surprise when owls began arriving from Chess enthusiasts around the world and even the barely known Wizard’s Chess World Federation. His frustrated, haughty words had given him the opportunity to do something he loved, and also single-handedly revitalized Wizard’s Chess in the mainstream. </p><p> </p><p>“Neuenacht doesn’t deserve diplomacy,” Ron seethed in retort, pacing the room, “Bloody fucking Death Eaters.” After the fall of Voldemort, the Death Eaters, assisted by Karkaroff, fled Great Britain into Northern Europe to settle in the unplottable lands around Durmstrang. After two years of silence and tension, Lucius Malfoy reappeared to the rest of the world, Chancellor of their newly formed country, Neuenacht.</p><p> </p><p>“They were recognized by the International Confederation of Wizards seven years ago. They are paying reparations and trying to reintegrate into society. It’s been twelve years, Ronald. The world has moved on,” Hermione sighed, tired of this recurring argument. A vote was a vote, and though Neuenacht’s acceptance was only by a slim majority, the process was the process. It had been a tedious process. Hermione was front and center as an intern for Penelope Clearwater, one of the British Seats in the ICW. Lucius had levied all of his previous political capital and cited his family’s assistance against Voldemort to further convince the world that his compatriots were previously misguided and now reformed. He was armed with many letters of contrition from former Death Eaters and sob stories of their lives that led them to darkness. He even used Severus Snape’s name to paint the Death Eaters as mostly secret resistance fighters. Hermione’s stomach had been churning. Upon completion of her internship, Hermione transferred quietly to the International Magical Office of Law. She had found her time assisting the diplomats tedious and pointless anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> International Confederation of blithering idiots</em> is more like it. How can you defend them?” Ron fixed his wrath on her, moving to face her down.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’m <em>not </em>defending them. How could you even think that?” She grabbed his shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“You want me to offer them diplomacy! After everything they did, everything they took from us… Diplomacy!” Ron’s voice began to rise as he shrugged out of her arms, turning away.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop. We’re not having another knock-down-drag-out about this. I can’t be the only one operating from a place of logic in this relationship. The world is what it is and you agreed to play their champion. I’m only saying that if you spout off about Death Eaters and Voldemort at the press conference, you’ll be the one looking like an arse and a child who can’t let go of the past.” Ron sputtered and Hermione cut him off again, “You think I want the world to forgive them? You know we searched for the Death Eaters for months after the Fall. Azkaban should be overflowing with those bastards.” She flopped dejectedly onto the couch. “But it isn’t. We don’t get to choose the world in which we live, only how we operate in it.”</p><p> </p><p>“When do we leave for Italy?” Ron calmed, joining her on the couch.</p><p> </p><p>“Kingsley is meeting us with the portkey in two days,” Hermione paused, dreading addressing the elephant in the whole discussion. “You know who it is, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I know. His blasted face has gotten almost as much press as I have.” He stiffened.</p><p> </p><p>“Would it be this hard if Malfoy wasn’t their champion?” She took his hand. </p><p> </p><p>“There is nothing that wouldn’t make this hard,” Ron turned her arm over, revealing to them both the scar Bellatrix had carved into Hermione twelve years ago. Hermione covered it again quickly with her sleeve, unwilling to get caught up in the reminder.</p><p> </p><p>“He wasn’t the worst of them. He saved Harry and even when he was so young-” Ron exploded at her words, rising and upsetting the coffee table in front of them. Hermione flinched at the violence, scrambling to the other end of the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you <em> dare </em>defend any of those bastards!” </p><p> </p><p>“Get yourself under control,” Hermione’s intense glare robbed Ron of his fire yet again. Unwilling to fully concede, he snorted disdainfully and turned for the door, slamming it on his way out.</p><p> </p><p>This was what their pattern had developed into. Gone were the days where she matched his temper blow for blow. Sure, he riled her plenty, but she no longer showed up for the path of his self-destruction. The anger had been intoxicating in the early days and she had risen to meet it passionately for the first few years. She had to grow, though, and she had hoped he would as well. She couldn’t build a life on angry sex and mutual remorse. Now, she almost felt like his handler and loads of people treated her as such; Kingsley Shacklebot definitely did. That’s how she had gotten roped into this whole situation. He had approached her to join the expedition, pretending it was her previous diplomatic experience and her knowledge of International Wizarding law. She knew, however true those reasons may be, that he really needed her to help prevent an international incident with their Golden boy. Ron was a loose cannon and the world was beginning to see it. </p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p> </p><p>“This is too much, father,” Draco sighed, looking out a large bay window to the mountains rising behind the new Malfoy Manor. “It’s too soon and too much.” He had known something was coming when Lucius asked to see him in the library after breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve done my part, boy. None of us went to Azkaban and now we have a life again. We’re no longer huddled, desperate masses fighting among ourselves. We have a home and we have status. We’re getting back all we lost in those years of darkness. Now, pull your head out of your ass and do your part,” Lucius sighed at his grown son. “It’s a frivolous Wizard’s Chess spectacle. It’s not fighting for your life against the Golden Trio.”</p><p> </p><p>“You say that but I know the stakes. It’s against Britain and against Weasley. <em> Frivolous </em>is not how I would describe this particular spectacle,” Draco turned a withering glare. “You’re missing work to have this discussion, oh illustrious Chancellor. If it wasn’t important you would have sent Theo for this pep talk.”</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t bother talking you around then,” Lucius sighed and chuckled. “Neuenacht has already agreed on your behalf and the portkey leaves in two days. You <em> will </em>  be the challenger at the Wizarding World Chess Championships, and you <em> will </em> grind Weasley into the dirt for all of our sakes.”</p><p> </p><p>“What..?” Draco sputtered. “This is ridiculous! I’m not a political tool to satisfy your need for conquest. You nearly ruined my life with your daft machinations-”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop being dramatic, Draco.” Lucius cut him off. “You have always been a political tool,<em> Heir</em>, and better mine than the Dark Lord’s again. This has been your life from conception. We are pureblood wizards, regal and dangerous, descended from greatness and rising to greatness again. Are you to be a pawn or a king?”</p><p> </p><p>“Actually, if we’re speaking in chess pieces, the queen is the most dynamic in terms of movement and strategy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then be a fucking queen, but you will do it in Italy against Weasley on a stage in front of the whole wizarding world. You are a symbol of The Neuenacht, and winning or losing reflects on our country.”</p><p> </p><p>“I <em>will </em>win. Weasley is clearly on the way out if the papers are any indication of his temperament and state of mind. His game is admirable, but all the pomp and circumstance is clearly going to his head.”</p><p> </p><p>“Great. Theo will be by later. There are press conferences and wardrobes and other little things for you to discuss. As you said, I’m missing work.” Lucius apparated swiftly away.</p><p><br/> “Goodbye, father, and you’re welcome,” Draco muttered to the empty room. <em> How did he..? I wasn’t going to do this. </em> Draco growled, frustrated that his father played him quite so easily. He turned back to the window. <em> Is this why he let me go into Chess in the first place? How many moves ahead would that have had to be? </em></p>
