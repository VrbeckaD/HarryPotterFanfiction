          <div class="userstuff"><p>At nine-thirty, Harry slides the door to the compartment open. It’s less than halfway down the train, but in an hour the corridor will be full of children, trunks, cats, and noise. He steps in to put his new briefcase—a gift—in the luggage rack.</p>
<p>Draco comes in after him, footsteps heavy with fatigue. “I feel like I’ve forgotten thirty things,” he says, but he throws himself into a seat and leans his head back. “I’m going to make a terrible professor.”</p>
<p>“I told you,” Harry says. He sits down across from Draco, feeling misplaced. He can’t help but imagine them as children, sharing a compartment like friends. He couldn’t have imagined what they are now.</p>
<p>Draco props his feet up in Harry’s lap without making eye contact.</p>
<p>“Oh, so it’s like that?” Harry says, grabbing his skinny ankles. “Am I just your footrest?”</p>
<p>“Do you think children will try to sit in our compartment?”</p>
<p>“They absolutely will,” Harry tells him. “They do every year. You’re not allowed to be mean.”</p>
<p>He doesn’t answer immediately, so Harry looks out the window, absently rubbing his thumb along the knit of Draco’s sock.</p>
<p>Finally, he says, "This year will be different.”</p></div>
