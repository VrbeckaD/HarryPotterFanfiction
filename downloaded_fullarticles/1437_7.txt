    <p>Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter </p>
<p>  It was a wonderful winter afternoon on February 25th, 1999. The soft, white snow had fallen during the night, there was a cool breeze looming in the air, and the sun was shining in the blue sky above The Burrow. Today was going to be absolutely perfect, for it was the wedding of Harry James Potter and Hermione Jean Granger.</p>
<p>  "Oh Hermione, you look beautiful." Karen Granger told her daughter as she began to cry. Her only daughter stood in front of the mirror as she looked at her reflection. The dress was a white strapless petite ballgown with a sweetheart neckline and beaded lace that showed off her curves. Her two- inch high heels were hidden underneath her dress as if she was walking on air. She wore a pearl clip on the left side of her brown curly locks as it fell two inches past her shoulders. Her tulle lace applique fingertip veil fell to the middle of her back as pearl earrings dangled from her ears and the matching necklace hung around her neck.</p>
<p>  "Oh Mum, please stop crying, you're going to ruin your mascara." Hermione joked as she sat on the bed next to her mother in Ginny's old room.</p>
<p> "Well, when you have children of your own and you are about to watch them get married, you will understand why I'm crying." Karen told her daughter, wiping off the tears that were running down her face.</p>
<p>  "I am sure that I will, seeing as Daddy always says I'm just like you." Hermione said as she gave her Mum a hug.</p>
<p>  "Your mother is right Hermione, you look stunning!" Ginny Weasley said as she and Luna were adding the finishing touches to their make up before putting on their bridesmaid dresses and styling their hair.</p>
<p>  "I'm so happy your day has finally arrived Hermione. This is the day you and Harry have dreamed about for a year." Luna chimed in as she gave her best friend a gentle hug, being careful not to wrinkle Hermione's wedding dress.</p>
<p> "Thank you ladies. I'm sure some day soon I will be able to return the favor and help the two of you get dolled up for your weddings." Hermione said as she winked at the two girls who blushed in return.</p>
<p>  "I wish that were true. I've been hinting to Ronald about being ready for marriage but he doesn't seem to pay attention anytime I talk about it."</p>
<p>  "Don't beat yourself up, Luna. My brother can be pretty daft when it comes to women. Next time you hint at it, maybe place a pile of chicken wings in front of his face and maybe he will pay attention." Ginny told her as everyone in the room chuckled. Karen and Hermione helped Ginny and Luna fix their hair and dresses while Molly Weasley was downstairs making the final preparations. Once the two girls were done getting ready, they bid Hermione goodbye and told her they would see her in a couple hours as they were going downstairs to help Molly.</p>
<p>  An hour later there was a soft knock on the door. "Hermione, May I come in?" Roger Granger had called through the door.</p>
<p> "Come on in, Daddy." Hermione said as she and her mother stood up and pulled her veil over her face.</p>
<p>  "Wow Hermione, you are absolutely breathtaking." Roger told her as he stepped into the room and walked towards his little girl. He stood in front of her and rested his hand on her cheek. "You look just like your mother in this dress." He told her as a small tear ran down his face. Karen stepped from behind her daughter to fetch the bouquet of white roses that were sitting in a vase on the dresser.</p>
<p>  "Thank you, Daddy." Hermione said as her mother handed her the flowers. Hermione took one last look in the mirror before her mother and father took her downstairs where her future awaits.</p>
<p>  Meanwhile, Harry James Potter was standing underneath the wedding arch with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy, at his side. The wedding was taking place in the garden in about fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>  "I am so happy for the both of you." Ron said as he patted Harry on the back.</p>
<p>   "Thanks Ron." Harry said eagerly as he watched the guests enter the garden to take their seats.</p>
<p>   "You okay? You seem nervous mate." Ron said to him noticing the way Harry kept pacing back and forth.</p>
<p>    "I'm not." Harry lied as he rubbed his hands together.</p>
<p>    "You know, you were never a good liar, even Hermione can tell you that. Now again what's wrong with you? I haven't seen you act like this since we took our NEWTS. "</p>
<p>    "What if she says no? Or what if I mess up on something in our marriage? What if I am not a good husband towards her?" Harry kept on asking as thousands of possibilities came running through his head.</p>
<p>    "Mate just relax. You just have pre-wedding jitters that's all. Listen to me okay? Hermione loves you. There is no way in the world that she would say no. I can tell you love Hermione a lot and you will do anything to make her happy. You both care about each other so much." Ron said trying to boost up Harry's confidence.</p>
<p>    "Ron's right, Harry. You two have been nuts about one another for years. Hell, even I could tell that before you two noticed anything. Ask anyone for that matter and they will tell you the same thing I am." Draco told him as he loosened his tie. Ginny had made it so tight that he could hardly breathe.</p>
<p>    "Thanks for saying that guys it means a lot. So when are you both going to propose to Luna and Ginny?" Harry asked his friends. Ron and Luna have been seeing one another for almost three years, just as long as Draco and Ginny have been seeing each other. After the war ended, Draco changed his ways and Ginny was the only one to see that for a while. Ron about had a heart attack when he heard Malfoy was dating his baby sister but as the last three years went by, Draco became part of the family.</p>
<p>   "I was thinking on our three year anniversary next month. I already have her ring, I've just wanted to do it at the right moment. She has been hinting at it lately but I pretend not to notice since I don't want to ruin the surprise." Ron said with a smile.</p>
<p>   "I was planning on proposing tomorrow night. I wasn't about to ruin you and Hermione's night by asking her here. It's been a pain to plan since I have been working on those burglary cases with Neville." Draco told his best friends as he smiled at the thought of asking Ginny to marry him.</p>
<p>   "Good. Just remember to make me the best man at both of your weddings." Harry told them playfully as he gave his best mates a pat on the back. Once everyone was seated, Kingsley Shacklebolt, The Minister for Magic, took his place in front of Harry, Ron and Draco. When the music began to play, Ginny and Luna came walking down the aisle with their hair laying across both of their shoulders. Both of the girls wore periwinkle blue dresses with matching heels that added an extra couple of inches to their height.</p>
<p>   As Ginny and Luna took their places opposite Harry and the Groomsmen, <em>The Wedding March</em> began to play and Harry was anxious to see Hermione walk down the aisle. His breath hitched in his throat at the sight before him. She was walking down the aisle with her father at her side and she looked breathtaking. At that moment in time, it felt as if they were the only two people in the world. Their gazes were locked with one another the whole way as Hermione continued to walk towards him. She smiled brightly at him, which caused all of Harry's worries to disappear.</p>
<p>  Once Hermione reached Harry, her father lifted up the veil and gave her hands to Harry. He gave Hermione a gentle kiss on the check and then Roger went to go sit next to his wife, Karen, who was quite overwhelmed. When Harry took Hermione's hands he mouthed the words" I love you" to her. Hermione gave him a soft smile and did the same.</p>
<p>  "I'd like to welcome everyone today as we watch these two young people join together as one. In all my years of living, I've never once came across a couple more in love and perfect for one another than Harry and Hermione. Hermione has chosen to recite her love for Harry first." Kingsley Shackbolt said as he welcomed the guests and gestured for Hermione to recite her vows.</p>
<p>  "When I arrived at Hogwarts, I never knew my life was about to change for the better. At first I was a bossy know-it-all who didn't have any friends, but then you and Ron came to rescue me from the troll. It hadn't been until you jumped on the troll and stuck your wand up its nose when I developed a crush on you." Hermione said as she began to cry." When it came to our fifth year, my crush began to expand into something more. I fell in love with you then because you were willing to help other students defend themselves when no one else was. You have such a big heart that is so full of love and compassion. You were starting to see me as a girl and not just ' one of the guys'. You have shown me that I can be myself and I never have to change who I am. You have made me stronger than I have ever been in my entire life. While the war was taking place, my only thoughts were to help you come out alive, that way I could tell you how madly in love with you I was. I love you because of the man you have turned out to be and I always will, no matter what. I promise to support you and be there for you no matter the obstacles thrown in our way. You're my best friend and I love you very much Harry James Potter and I cannot wait until you and I can spend the rest of our lives together." Hermione finished and had everyone in tears, especially Harry.</p>
<p>  "Those were really beautiful words Hermione. I don't even know if I can top that." Harry said which made everyone laugh. "Hermione, the day I knew that I was in love with you was when I had thought I lost you. That day we had gone to the Ministry of Magic and we were fighting off two Death Eaters and one of them had struck you with a spell, I panicked. You had fallen motionless to the ground and I was afraid I had lost you forever. When Neville came by my side, checked on your pulse, and told me that you were okay, I was relieved. I knew then how I felt about you and how much you really meant to me. I knew that I couldn't have told you how I felt about you because I didn't want to put your life in more jeopardy. You are the one person who I could never live without seeing each and every day of our lives. The thought of losing you makes my heart ache and I never want to know how it feels to lose the one you love before we truly begin to live the rest of our lives together. You have made me the man I am today. I am blessed that the troll wandered into the bathroom, because he lead me to you. I promise you Hermione, that I will always be there for you whenever you need me. I love you so much Hermione. I always have and I always will." When Harry finished Kingsley had them put on their rings.</p>
<p>  "I now pronounce you Husband and Wife. You may kiss the Bride." Kingsley told Harry who pulled Hermione into his arms and his lips met with hers in a gentle kiss. A kiss that promised one another that their love would always be eternal.</p>
<p>  "I love you, Hermione Jean Potter." Harry said to Hermione when they broke the kiss.</p>
<p>  "I love you, Harry James Potter." Hermione told him as they began to walk down the aisle towards their future as husband and wife.</p>
