    <p>Wynstella is hiding in the bathroom.</p><p>She doesn't want to be found. Not by The Weasley, not by the Bright Witch, not by Kedavra, and especially not by Lee.</p><p>She wants to be left alone. </p><p>(She doesn't, she really doesn't.)</p><p>It's better this way.</p><p>(It hurts. It hurts more than she could ever imagine.)</p><p>They're safer this way.</p><p>(She angrily throws in the back of her mind the picture of two black eyes, empty and unseeing.)</p><p>She knows exactly what to say to make them leave.</p><p>---</p><p>Kedavra and The Weasley are not at the Feast.</p><p>The Bright Witch looks worried. So does Lee, but her faces lights up when she sees Wynstella, and she waves happily. Wynstella pointedly ignores her.</p><p>(It's better this way.)</p><p>Everything smells like meat and candies, the hundreds of children around her make her skin sticky, and she feels the taste of sickness in the back of her throat.</p><p>She shakes her head to clear her mind. It's not Dark Magic. Just the smells of the Feast reminding her of</p><p>(Ami)</p><p>bad things.</p><p>Still. She doesn't manage to take a single bite.</p>
