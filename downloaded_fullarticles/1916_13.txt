    <p>“I think he’s waking up.” the second voice said flatly. “Let’s speed up the process. Rennervate.”</p>
<p>Awareness flooded his system, and he lifted his head to see a dozen wands pointed at his person. He grunted in annoyance when he found his hands bound to his sides, and his wand laying on the table before him. He should have expected this, he had been warned about the healthy amount of paranoia in the Order. A small, sad smile crossed his features when his gaze landed on the more familiar members.</p>
<p>Mad-Eye Moody stepped forwards and held his wand close enough to touch the tip of his nose. “Who are you, boy, and how did you get into this house?”</p>
<p>He cleared his throat. “I was sent here.” he began, his voice gravelly and dry. Shit, he thought as every member looked all the warier. They weren’t going to believe him on good faith. As a nervous gesture, he turned his ring with his thumb. The action didn’t go unnoticed. “I was sent here, from the future.” he finished.</p>
<p>A gasp was the general reaction, except for a certain few, Moody included. “And if you are, who might you be?” a pause. “Let me guess. Draco Malfoy.” </p>
<p>Here Draco laughed a little. “I haven’t gone by that name in years.”</p>
<p>“What is your name then?” Molly ventured as she got a good look at him. </p>
<p>“I’ve been going by Draco Potter for the last 7 years.”</p>
<p>Sirius and Severus looked twin shades of green. </p>
<p>“Well, that certainly blew all my other expectations out of the water.” Tonks deadpanned.</p>
