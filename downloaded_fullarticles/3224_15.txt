    <p>Sebastian Enjolras leaned over to Emeric Grantaire beside him and smiled at him "Grantaire - 'Taire? Would you help me practice a spell?" Emeric Grantaire beamed at Enjolras and stopped playing exploding snaps with Francois Feuilly and nodded happily- Enjolras was talking to him again!!! He was so happy! "Sure Enj! What should I d-" No sooner had he started asking - just wondering what the spell was and how he was to help - when Enjolras pointed his oak wand at Grantaire and said calmly and softly "Diminuendo!" And Grantaire began to shrink - Feuilly jumped back confused and frightened as Enj laughed and caught Thumbelina sized Grantaire- he brought him up to his face "That was for the Love potion you put in my Butterbeer a month ago." Tiny Grantaire pouted and crossed his little arms "I told you - Courf stole your hair from your robes and put it in your drink - oh that was the polyjuice potion he was going to use - nevermind -" Feuilly watched with wide grey eyes</p>
