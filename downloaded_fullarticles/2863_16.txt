  <p>
    <strong>Chapter 1: Hiding From the Press</strong>
  </p>
  <p>"No, he is NOT available for comment!" shouted Mrs. Weasley. "Now leave before I hex you! And I will too!"</p>
  <p>Harry couldn't help but smile as he heard Mrs. Weasley yell at yet another group of reporters. It had been like this the past several months; ever since Voldemort was defeated. True it had gotten better as time went by and the excitement went down, but the reporters had become so annoying that Harry was forced to get nine magical restraining orders; one of them being for Rita Skeeter.</p>
  <p>Harry had been staying at the Burrow for the past several months. The Weasleys had been more than happy to let him stay. Harry was extremely grateful. He had no intention of ever going back to the Dursleys, and he was determine to sell Grimmauld Place as soon as possible, since it was no longer headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix, not that he needed the money.</p>
  <p>Constantly being swamped by reporters was the only thing that was a problem. Harry hardly had private time. Time that he wanted to spend alone with Ginny. But the reporters weren't the only ones hounding him. Ron was also watching his every move; making sure that nothing happened between Harry and his sister. The only time Harry and Ginny did get any time alone was when Ron went to have his own private time with Hermione. And even then, the other Weasleys substituted for Ron's absence; leaving Harry embarrassed many times and Ginny yelling at her brothers even more.</p>
  <p>"They've gone for now." said Mrs. Weasley, coming back inside. "But I'm sure they will be back."</p>
  <p>"You think they would have learned to just leave him be." snickered Ron.</p>
  <p>"Yes, you would think you would learn to let him be." growled Ginny, eyeing her brother angrily. Ron had stumbled upon Harry and Ginny kissing a little while ago and Ginny still wasn't happy about it.</p>
  <p>"I was talking about the reporters." said Ron.</p>
  <p>"How much longer do you think this will last?" asked Harry.</p>
  <p>"Probably a few more months." said Mr. Weasley, reading the Daily Prophet, whose cover read, <em>'Happy 18th Birthday Harry Potter!'</em> "You would think they would find better things to report by now. But don't worry, it will die down eventually."</p>
  <p>"Yeah, then I'll be faced with constant gossip at Hogwarts." said Harry.</p>
  <p>He, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were returning to Hogwarts this year to make up the year they missed while searching for Voldemort's Horcruxes. Harry, Ron, and Hermione would be entering their seventh year while Ginny would be entering her sixth.</p>
  <p>It would be rather strange going back to Hogwarts. So many things would be different. McGonagall would be Headmistress, and since several teachers were killed the previous year, they would have a different Transfiguration, Herbology, and Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher as well; although having a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher wasn't something new for them. Then there would be the matter of their friends. Most of them had graduated the previous year that Harry and the others missed. Harry would miss his roommates Neville, Dean, and Seamus, but at least he still had Ron, and he did know some of the fifth year boys that would be his new roommates. Harry groaned as he realized that one of them would be Colin, who would be just as bad as the reporters.</p>
  <p>Yes this year at Hogwarts Harry would be hero-worshipped even more than he was in his first year. All the guys would want to know how he defeated Voldemort and all the girls would fancy him. But there was only one girl for Harry, and she was sitting on his lap and being held by him right now.</p>
  <p>Ginny seemed to read Harry's mind because she turned to him and said "If any girls even look at you the wrong way they'll have to deal with me."</p>
  <p>Harry smiled and kissed her forehead. "Not chance, love. You're the only one that has a place in my heart."</p>
  <p>Ginny sighed and brought Harry's hand to her mouth and kissed it. Ron put on a disgusted face. "That's disgusting. Must you guys act so… mushy around me? I really don't want to see it."</p>
  <p>"Then go away." said Ginny.</p>
  <p>"And have images in my head of the two of you snogging. No thanks."</p>
  <p>"Then go snog Hermione, and you won't have those images." snapped Ginny.</p>
  <p>"That's enough!" said Mrs. Weasley loudly. This wasn't the first time she had to break up an argument between her son and daughter. "Ron leave your sister alone."</p>
  <p>"I'm not doing anything!" said Ron defensively.</p>
  <p>"You're constantly hounding us." said Ginny.</p>
  <p>"I am not!"</p>
  <p>"You are so!"</p>
  <p>"I said that's enough!" said Mrs. Weasley. "Today is Harry's birthday and I don't want any fighting."</p>
  <p>"And I don't want to see my best friend and sister snogging." said Ron under his breath. But Ginny still heard him.</p>
  <p>"How do think I feel about seeing <em>my</em> best friend and brother snogging?" she said.</p>
  <p>Hermione blushed and Ron opened his mouth to retort, but Mr. Weasley interrupted him.</p>
  <p>"That's enough, you two." he said. "Ron your sister is old enough to take care of herself. Let her be."</p>
  <p>Ron muttered something that sounded like "You always take her side" and let it go after that. Harry smiled and kissed Ginny's head again. This was common ground for them. This argument broke out more times than he could remember and probably more times than even Hermione could count.</p>
  <p>"So this officially makes you a man in the muggle world." said Hermione, trying to change the conversation.</p>
  <p>Harry shrugged. "I guess so. Not that it really matters."</p>
  <p>"Of course it matters!" exclaimed Hermione. "The laws of the magical world don't apply to the laws of the muggle world."</p>
  <p>Harry shrugged again. "It doesn't matter. I have everything I need right here." He bounced Ginny on his lap and she laughed. Just then Mrs. Weasley appeared in the room again followed by Fleur and Gabriella.</p>
  <p>"The cake is ready!" she announced. "Come on everyone."</p>
  <p>As Harry walked into the kitchen, Gabriella gave him a flirtatious smile and he felt her use the veela charm on him. She had been doing this every chance she could. Not that it mattered. She had nothing on Ginny. He walked right by her, merely nodded at her as she passed. But Ron was a different story. He stopped to stare at her until Hermione hit him over the head looking annoyed.</p>
  <p>It was a very good cake. It was chocolate cake in the shape of a Snitch. The wings were covered in vanilla icing and the center was covered in yellow icing. Harry thanked Mrs. Weasley for it. She smiled and told him that Ginny helped make it. Harry showed his appreciation by kissing her on the cheek.</p>
  <p>At one point the flash of a camera went off as a paparazzi took Harry's picture through the window. Mrs. Weasley lost her temper completely and actually went outside to 'talk' with him. She came back in a few minutes later looking very satisfied with herself.</p>
  <p>"Time for presents!" said Mrs. Weasley once she noticed that the cake was finished.</p>
  <p>Fred and George dove into the pile of presents and pulled out theirs.</p>
  <p>"Open ours first." they said in unison.</p>
  <p>Harry poked the gift and eyed the twins suspiciously. He knew that you could <em>never</em> trust them. Especially if whatever they were giving you was wrapped.</p>
  <p>"Don't worry. It's nothing bad." said Fred, but he couldn't hide the grin on his face.</p>
  <p>Harry still wasn't sure he could trust them. He opened the present very carefully. After opening the box he was sprayed in the face by water, leaving him drenched and the twins laughing. Ginny kicked them under the table as Mrs. Weasley dried Harry off before scowling the twins.</p>
  <p>Ron handed him his present next. It turned out to be a Snitch. This was a very good present since Bill and Fleur's gifts turned out to be two Bludgers and Mr. Weasley's was a Quaffle.</p>
  <p>"We figured you could use your own Quidditch set." said Ron.</p>
  <p>"Thanks." said Harry.</p>
  <p>"Here's mine." said Hermione, handing him a present that looked very much like a book. It was too. And it was <em>Hogwarts: A History</em> no less.</p>
  <p>"Why would he need that when we have you?" said Ron, looking at Hermione. "You're our own personal <em>Hogwarts: A History."</em></p>
  <p>"Ron really." she said going red. "I think everyone should read it."</p>
  <p>Harry was secretly agreeing with Ron, but still thanked Hermione just the same. Gabrielle handed Harry her gift next, which also looked like a book.</p>
  <p>"Oh you've got to be kidding me!" cried Ron once Harry opened the gift.</p>
  <p>It was a book. A history book titled <em>"Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World."</em> The book had obviously been written back when Harry first defeated Voldemort. Harry wasn't sure he would be reading this anytime soon either.</p>
  <p>"Er, thanks." said Harry.</p>
  <p>"Oh, you're veery velcome, 'Arry." said Gabriella. Harry felt her use the veela charm again, but he ignored it. It was very old now.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Weasley handed Harry her gift, which turned out to be new dress robes.</p>
  <p>"I made them myself." she said proudly.</p>
  <p>"Mum, you made that?" gasped Ron, amazed his mother could sew so well. This was a lot nicer than the sweaters she made.</p>
  <p>"Yes dear. I'm getting better." said Mrs. Weasley.</p>
  <p>"Thanks Mrs. Weasley. These are really nice." said Harry.</p>
  <p>"You're very welcome dear."</p>
  <p>Ginny leaned over and whispered in Harry's ear. "My present isn't quite ready yet. So here's a substitute."</p>
  <p>She kissed him long and hard on the lips, ignoring the groan from Ron.</p>
  <p>"Oh gross!" cried Fred.</p>
  <p>"I'm going to be sick." said George, putting his hand over his mouth.</p>
  <p>Ginny pulled away and smiled at Harry who said "That was present enough."</p>
  <p>"Really?" said Fred, now in amusement. "So next time all we have to do is snog him instead of getting him a present."</p>
  <p>"You didn't even get him anything." said Ron.</p>
  <p>"I know. We made it." said George.</p>
  <p>At that moment there was another flash of a camera from outside as another paparazzi attempted to get a picture.</p>
  <p>"Not again!" snapped Mrs. Weasley. She grabbed her wand and headed for the door as the others laughed at the terrified cameraman.</p>
  <p>It was late that night and everyone said their goodnights and headed for bed. They had been playing with Harry's new Quidditch set and Harry was exhausted from playing all day.</p>
  <p>"Think you'll be over your nervousness this year?" said Harry.</p>
  <p>Ron gave him a nervous smile. "I think so. You'd think that after winning the cup two years I would be over it."</p>
  <p>"Relax man, I'm just kidding you." laughed Harry, slapping his friend on the back. "I'm sure you'll do fine."</p>
  <p>Ron gave another nervous smile. "Thanks."</p>
  <p>"Psst! Hey Harry. Over here."</p>
  <p>It was Ginny standing in her doorway. She was dressed only in her nightgown, causing Harry's breath to get caught in his throat.</p>
  <p>"Come here." she said again.</p>
  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked Ron.</p>
  <p>"Just giving him his birthday present." said Ginny.</p>
  <p>Ron wasn't convinced. "And what is his present?" he asked suspiciously.</p>
  <p>"<em>I'm</em> his present." said Ginny.</p>
  <p>Ron's face turned as red as his hair before Ginny burst out laughing.</p>
  <p>"Oh Ron really. You're so gullible." she said. Ron's face relaxed, but he was now red with embarrassment. "Come on Harry."</p>
  <p>She grabbed his hand and pulled him into her room, closing the door behind them.</p>
  <p>"I've been working on this for awhile. I hope you like it."</p>
  <p>She showed him a poster size picture. At first Harry thought it was a portrait of himself, but on second glance he realized it was actually a painting of him.</p>
  <p>"Ginny did you paint this?" he asked amazed.</p>
  <p>"Yes. It's not that good but-"</p>
  <p>"Are you kidding!" he said. "This is incredible! I never knew you could paint like this. You're really good."</p>
  <p>Ginny blushed. "It's not much."</p>
  <p>"Sure it is." said Harry. "And what makes it even better is that you made it. It's not something bought, but made." He suddenly realized something. "Wait, I didn't pose for this. How did you do this without me there?"</p>
  <p>"Oh well, one of the pictures I have of you posed for me." said Ginny. "I'm glad you like it."</p>
  <p>"I love it Ginny. Thanks."</p>
  <p>He gathered her in his arms and kissed her deeply. It barely registered that he and Ginny were alone in her room.</p>
  <p>Ginny moaned into their kiss and Harry kissed her harder. Ginny's hands began wondering and they became tangled in his hair. They fell back against her bed.</p>
  <p>"Merlin Ginny, I love you so much." said Harry.</p>
  <p>"I love you too Harry." she said. "Now stop talking."</p>
  <p>Harry didn't need telling twice. He kissed her again more forcefully. Ginny asked for entrance with her tongue and Harry granted her access. Ginny moaned again as their tongues danced around. Harry loved hearing that noise coming from her. He began trailing kisses down her neck, and Ginny moved her head back to give him better access.</p>
  <p>Things were beginning to get out of control. If they didn't stop soon Harry didn't think they would be able to. As much as he wanted to be with Ginny, he wasn't stupid enough to do it at the Burrow with all the Weasleys present (not counting Charlie, who was still in Romania). Not to mention that Hermione slept in this room too.</p>
  <p>"Ginny we have to stop." he said.</p>
  <p>Ginny groaned. She knew what he meant. They had had this conversation before. But Ginny was getting harder and harder to deny.</p>
  <p>"I don't want to stop." she said.</p>
  <p>"I don't either." said Harry. "But I don't think we should be doing this here. Ron is probably still standing outside."</p>
  <p>"So what. Let him stand there."</p>
  <p>"Ginny-"</p>
  <p>"Harry shut up and kiss me." she said before kissing him again.</p>
  <p>All thought was driven away from him when she did that. Suddenly it seemed worth the risk to be with her. Harry kissed her back even though he knew that they should stop before something happened.</p>
  <p>"Um, excuse me."</p>
  <p>Harry and Ginny broke apart. Hermione was standing in the doorway looking very embarrassed. Ron was behind her looking furious.</p>
  <p>"I better go before Ron kills me." said Harry. He kissed her one last time before leaving the room. He looked at Ron who didn't seem too happy about what he just saw. Harry felt like he was about to face the famous Weasley temper.</p>
  <p>"Since it's your birthday, I'm not going to hex you." said Ron.</p>
  <p>Harry breathed a sigh of relief then before following Ron upstairs.</p>
