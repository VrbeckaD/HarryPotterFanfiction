  <em>Sir Harmon Fellows, Esq.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Once there was a man who dreamed. He didn’t dream of greatness or riches, nor did he dream of love or passion; this man dreamed of safety. His name was Xerxes Al Ka Ban and he was a most terrible person; a most terrible wizard. Not only did this man practice the darkest of arts magika but he was a known Necromancer, a wizard of death!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He terrorized the nation with his band of dark wizards bringing droves of the dead back to life to torture the living, or so it is said by the families who remain who still remember it. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He and his conclave, a legion of men all dedicated to his dark propose, had but one goal, to sow the seeds of He’Cati the dark goddess of magic and death. One might think this was a metaphorical goal, to spread the worship of the dark goddess to Wix but no, this was more of a literal goal they all wished to achieve. For each man in his conclave, one hundred seeds of He-Cati were given, seeds which they were bid to plant and watch grow.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Most would think nothing of this, mire plants after all were nothing to fear, least not to the great people of the Wixen Clans or Wizarding World in modern parlance, for this all took place even before the time of Merlin when Wizards collected in small Bands and Clans, and bands and roamed the British islands with nothing to fear from the Mundane Folk. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>These seeds though were not like any normal seed. Pales white with a shimmer of violet to their shell they gave off each a dark aura and when one was planted whole acres of land became as death, uninhabitable by any normal man without going insane. The White Blight it was called, for everything that sprung from the blighted land was ghostly and deformed in appearance and poisonous to all folk who lived near. Even the water was polluted by the foul spread of the White Blight.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It is said that the wizard Xerxes was given a vision by the goddess, that when each seed was planted that only then would his conclave and their families be safe. Safe from what, you might ask? I do not know, but many have speculated as to what it was he and his followers feared, death mayhap, it does not matter. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>All that is known is where Al Ka Ban walked death followed quickly in his footsteps. It took only a year of this cursed pilgrimage for the Wixen Clans to gather, forming the very first rendering of the Wizengamot, where it was discussed and agreed that no longer would they suffer the White Blight of Xerxes or his followers. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>They laid waste to the blighted land, creating the disastrous curse now known as Fiendfire which swept the lands distorting the seeds of He’Cati down to their roots; along with everything else. The Wix counted it a success for new green things began to grow soon after in the dark ask of the fire. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Xerxes and his followers were incensed by the Wixen’s actions and swore vengeance for they were nearly complete in their sowing, nearly to the promise of safety and freedom. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>What happened next is unknown for the most part. Some tales say there was a great war between Xerxes and the Wix. Some say he was captured and killed and some others say he left of his own volition. What is known is that he and his people were exiled from the British Islands. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>They left and disappeared into the waters of the North Sea. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>For many years they were forgotten about. Xerxes was reduced to nothing more than a bad dream with which to scare children into behaving. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And then one day, some hundreds of years later, a new terror became known of a dark place hidden deep in the centre of the North Sea. People were going missing, strange lights stole sailors away from their boats and dark shadows took the very breath of a man away. What we would find of that island nation would terrorize the Wix for generations to come. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was the Dark Isles of Hollow, The Sovereign Nation of Alkaban, where Xerxes and his people laid their heads and grew their dark seed. Some say they used the sailors as a sacrifice to their dark goddess creating the creatures we now know as Dementors. Other people say they were a safe haven for those who were weary. Personally, I believe the truth lies somewhere in between. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Envoys of the British Wixen went to the Dark Isles searching for what, I do not know. They found in the Central City of Soul, not what they were expecting. A tyrant forcing his wills upon all, no, it was not that at all. What they found instead was a King, a King who ruled over a small but prosperous country, a paradise for the Wix who lived there and all, devoted to their lord, not through force, but honest love of him. He was after all the man who commanded the Dementors, he who withstood the burdens of their protection, the man who fought and bled for them and made the land a fertile and magical place.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Seeing the control one man had over such demons the British Wix sought to control it in part for their own selfish desires. For crime on the Dark Isles was nearly nonexistent. After all who would be foolish enough to go against the words of a King who could have your very soul condemned to an eternity of suffering? Thus the alliance between Britain and Alkaban (the name was later anglicized to Azkaban) was created and the fortress of Azkaban Prison created under the agreed terms that the people of the Dark Isles would be the ones who ran it, with select members of the British Wix acting as liaisons of course.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For many years this alliance stood. Revered and feared amongst the people of Britain who did not wholly understand the people of the Dark Isles. Until one man chose to destroy it completely, Gellert Grindelwald, who in the early 1990s assassinated every member of the Royal Family of Azkaban. He had plans you see, plans that would be hampered if any Mage of the Azkaban family were left to live. After all, with the islands overrun by free Dementor’s he would have an easier time stealing what he needed to rule the entire world. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>What it was he wished to steal will never be known. When the Wix of the Dark Isles learned of his actions against they’re beloved Sovereigns the people of Dark Hollow banned together and rebuffed him. They closed their gates to all save the Ministry, allowing them greater control over the prison as they attempted to find any who could bring the Dementors under control. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was the Ministry of Magic that came forth with an answer for their allies. A Curse that would keep the dark creatures contained to the prison. All the Dark Hollows would need to do, was give them complete control of the prison…</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry sighed and shook his head, closing the book. He had picked it up when he had last lived with Sirius. A book on Dementors and Azkaban, or at least that was what he had figured. It looked to be more fairy tales than anything else. Leaning back against the headboard of his old, decapitated bed Harry stared vacantly at the far wall of his cluttered bedroom.</p><p>Harry Potter was a boy of fifteen, almost sixteen, with dark unruly hair which fell into his bright emerald green eyes. He was small for his age, only five foot five and slim, too slim thanks to his relatives continued starvation of him. On his chin, a dark bruise bloomed black and peaking up from the horrid oversized neck of his Cousin Dudley’s old shirt a similar mark in the shape of a hand laid around his neck.</p><p>Harry Potter, was not having a good summer.</p><p> His godfather was dead killed by his own cousin and no one cared. Sure the man was wanted as a murderer, innocent thought he was. But that was no excuse. People should have cared that he was gone. People should have tried to save at least a little bit of his memory. But from all the letters he had gotten back from Dumbledore, it seemed like no one was.</p><p>It was an endless litany of, calm down Harry, adults know best Harry, not the right time for this Harry. Or Harry’s personal favourite, listen to your elders Harry, we know best. Best seemed to be keeping an innocent man’s memory hidden in the dark, tarnished by the evil actions of others while sitting on their asses in that very same man’s home using his things and pretending he wasn’t dead.</p><p>It was disgusting. Or at least Harry thought so.</p><p>Instead of trying to stop Voldemort, or trying to clear his godfather’s name, they were keeping him locked up! Harry had spied no less than three order members at any given time in and around the area of his house since the beginning of the summer. And once, when he had tried to leave, going to the shops to get his aunt something she had just absolutely needed, he had been stunned in the back and then woken up hours later in his bed, task not completed with no memory of how he had gotten there or what had happened to him while he was stunned.</p><p>His uncle had loved the excuse, not that he needed one anymore, for violence. Which is how he now found himself, bedridden, his one kneed horribly swollen, and from the sharp gagged pain of it, as broken as his collarbone and ribs.</p><p>There was a knock on the door, an actual knock, like a hand gently rapping on the wood of his door. It was insane. Turning he saw the clock, three-thirty in the morning.</p><p><em>‘Ah</em>,’ Harry thought, ‘<em>time for dinner then.’</em></p><p>“Come in!” Harry called softly and gave a small smiled as the face of his fat walrus of a cousin poke in after the clicking and clanking of the opening of the locks came thought the door.</p><p>“Hey, Harry,” Dudley said as he comes through the door, a plate of steaming creamy chicken pasta in his hands. “How are you feeling today?”</p><p>If there was one tolerable thing about this summer, it was his cousin’s unexpected attitude towards him. Sure he had saved him from a dementor the other summer but he hadn’t expected such a turnaround. Hell, Dudley was practically kind to him, coming up to his room with sandwiches when he couldn’t leave his bed, or sneaking him out so he could use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Lately, that kindness had been bringing him healthy and hardy dinners while he was laid up with a broken knee and helping him to the bathroom when he couldn’t make it on his own.</p><p>“Same old same old” Harry sighed taking the hot bowl from his cousin and starting to eat.</p><p>Dudley sat down beside him and stared down at his swollen knee, “did you know I never knew it was wrong, what we did to you?”</p><p>Harry blinked, licking the sauce from his lips, “Oh?”</p><p>“All my life, my father has hit you. I never knew it was wrong. I just thought it was normal,” Dudley sighed. “I’ve been seeing a therapist. Mom insisted what with the Dementy thing last summer. I talked about you one day and I couldn’t understand why the doctor was so angry. Which just made him angrier I think?”</p><p>Harry frowned, “Well, yeah. People, especially family, shouldn’t hit each other. Definitely not kids.”</p><p>Dudley nodded, “Yeah, see you say that and I knew that, but I don’t think I understood it. I didn’t understand that it was wrong. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Harry wanted nothing more than to tell his cousin to shove it up his ass. He wanted to tell him that his apology was worth shit because here he was broken and starving anyway. He wanted to tell him that one apology wasn’t worth anything in comparison to fifteen years of hell. But, as he opened his mouth to yell all his frustrations out, he couldn’t help but think of Sirius.</p><p>Not that his godfather would hold his anger against him. But, Harry sighed, if he died tomorrow, he didn’t think he’d want his last words to his cousin to be what amounted to fuck off.</p><p>“It’s fine,” he said instead. “I didn’t know it was wrong either. Not until I went to live with Ron for the summer back when we were twelve.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a bit while Harry finished off his dinner, each of them uncomfortable with the other.</p><p>Harry sighed and put the empty bowl on his nightstand, flinching as his knee jostled as he did. His cousin grabbed him around his shoulders as he gasped and started to slide off the bed, pushing him until his back hit the backboard of his bed.</p><p>“Thank you,” Harry gasped trying not to clutch at his knee.</p><p>“Is there anyone I can call? Someone who will come and get you out of here and to a damned doctor?” Dudley asked looking worried. He had changed over the school year, and while he wasn’t slim and never would be Harry thought he looked like he had lost a lot of weight. He had also gotten his hair cut without his mom around because the sides and back of his head were shaved down, leaving the top long and floppy, but it looked good, made him look less like a little boy.</p><p>Harry laughed and shook his head, “Who exactly do you think put me in this place Dud? Sure your dad broke my knee, but it was because the fuckers who are watching me stunned me in the back and put me back here when I tried to do a chore for your mom. I’m not allowed to leave; they’ll just bring me back.”</p><p>Dudley huffed and leaned back, “That can’t be legal.”</p><p>“Well, when one of the people holding you hostage is the Chief Warlock I guess no one cares,” Harry said.</p><p>“There isn’t anyone else you can call? Someone who doesn’t like your Chief Warlock any?” Dudley asked looking frantic.</p><p>“Well, I could call the Dark Lord. But he’d just kill me,” Harry told him. His cousin looked horrified at the idea, and Harry laughed, “The only people I can think of would be the Goblins, but I don’t think they’d do anything for me. They run the bank after all not the police force and as a general rule hate all things Wizard. Dudley, I’ll be fine, I just need to rest.”</p><p>As Dudley went to reply, his face saying it all really, there was a repeated tapping at the window. Harry blinked and stared at the stately owl hovering outside the window pane.</p><p>“Can you let him in?” Harry asked, nodding to the owl.</p><p>Dudley nodded and heaved himself to his feet, before opening the window. The owl, a Large Horned Owl swept through the window and landed at Harry’s elbow before presenting him its leg on which a letter was safely tied.</p><p>Pulling it free Harry watched as the owl swept back out the window and into the night.</p><p>“What’s that?” Dudley asked coming back around the bed.</p><p>Harry shrugged, turning it over. The Gringotts coat of arms gleamed back at him from the wax seal.</p><p>“Speak of the devil. What would the bank want with me at three in the bloody morning?” Harry wondered aloud, turning the letter over once more in his hands before ripping it open. A small coin fell from the fold of the envelope and Harry stared at it, utterly confused before turning to the letter.</p><p>

</p><p>
  <em>Riptide</em>
</p><p>Harry blinked down at the letter. Presumed Heir? Henry? His name was Henry, not Harry? Just what the hell was all this about? Last letter they were sending, did that mean they were trying to contact him before and couldn’t? But then, why wouldn’t they have been able to send him mail?</p><p>“What the fuck is going on here?” Harry asked looking up at his cousin. His birthday was the next day, he wouldn’t have long to wait for answers.</p><p>“Dudley?” Harry asked as the boy took the letter from his shaking hands.</p><p>“Yeah, Harry?”</p><p>“You’re sorry for hurting me right?”</p><p>“Yes,” the boy nodded.</p><p>“Well then,” Harry said, staring up at him with burning eyes, “I need your help. You help me make that appointment Dudley and I’ll forgive you everything.”</p><p>Dudley looked down and read the letter in his hands, “What’s a portkey?”</p><p>“It’s a magical means of travel, but I can’t take it with my knee, not alone anyways. I need you to help me stay on my feet, or at least to soften the landing when we get there.”</p><p>Dudley hummed, “And to help you around to all those meeting’s I’d wager.”</p><p>Harry nodded, “Once I’m out of the house, and past the guard, I can get to a doctor. I can hide where they won’t be able to find me.” Well, Harry hoped he could anyways.</p><p>Dudley sighed and stared at his cousin. Small and broken though he was his eyes spoke a lot for him, bright and burning with something that just might be rage. His father had tried to stop that fire from his cousin, had tried and failed. Dudley didn’t think there was anything out there that could truly break the boy beside him. Not if even soul-sucking demons didn’t make him flinch.</p><p>“Well,” Dudley decided. “I have always wanted to see the wizarding world. I’ll take you to your meeting, little cousin.”</p>
