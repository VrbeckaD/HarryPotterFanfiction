  <span>He felt like it started with the letters.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Well. If he was being honest it started so much earlier than that but the letters were a good enough way to begin.</span>

<p>
  <span>As much as the Dursleys would like everyone to believe, Harry Potter was not an idiot.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He may be dense at times but he was no idiot. Which is why he was sure that some of the things that happened around him and the weird things that the Dursleys blamed on him were not normal. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>See, Harry found it ironic that a family like the Dursleys --who prided themselves on being normal and forbade anything and/or anyone that </span>
  <em>
    <span>wasn't</span>
  </em>
  <span>-- would be surrounded by such odd occurrences. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Many things came to mind: him being able to talk to snakes, the buzzcut that grew overnight as if nothing had happened to his hair and the shrinking of the sweater that he didn't like (amongst other things). But, like stated before, it really began with the letters.</span>
