          <div class="userstuff"><p>Dear Nobody,</p><p>I am Harry James Potter. I am eight years old. Miss said it my name in class. I don't like my name. What truly is the point if nobody is ever going to say it at home? They barely say it at school, either. I hate it. I want it gone. They don't like it at home, so they call me Boy. I'm okay with that. I am eight years old</p><p>The Dursleys hate me. I don't blame them - I would hate me too. I am nothing but a nuisance, after all. I had a pet mouse once. Dudley killed it and they made me watch. Dudley is a fat oaf. He ran over my mouse on his creaking red tricycle. I snuck in paper to my <strike>cupboard</strike> bedroom. There isn't much light though, because <strike>there isn't a light here</strike> my aunt and uncle are asleep.</p><p>I'm sorry Mr Nobody. I burden everyone I meet with my issues. How fantastic is that?</p><p>Yours Faithfully, </p><p>Hjp</p></div>
