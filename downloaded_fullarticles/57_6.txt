  <strong>~Scorpius’ POV~</strong>
</p><p>It’s a typical morning, with a huge breakfast made by Grandfather, since none of us know how to cook, and Grandmother being a pervert towards him which only earns her slaps to the forehead. As I sat down, an owl flew through the window and dropped a letter next to my plate. It was from Hogwarts, clearly, and I tore open the envelope.</p><p align="center">
  <em>“‘Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Headmistress: Minerva McGonagall.</em><br/>
<em>Dear Mr Malfoy,</em><br/>
<em>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 4 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.</em><br/>
<em>Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress.’”</em>
</p><p>I looked at the other piece of parchment in the envelope. “Give me the supplies list.” Father said as he took the paper from me. Rude. “Since it’s still early, we can go to Diagon Alley now, go get ready Scorpius.” I internally groaned and got up, going to my room. Oh, before I forget, I must mention something. The Malfoy family is a family of demons, well, until Grandfather married Grandmother, then Father ended up a hybrid, and I ended up a full demon. Our family tree is sorta weird. Anyway, I put on a simple black t-shirt, with jeans and some black high-tops. I wrapped a jacket around my waist and went downstairs where Father was waiting for me.</p><p>He took out his wand and apparated us to a building that’s apparently called the Leaky Cauldron. “Hello, Malfoy.” A mysterious, but a recognizable voice said. My father turned towards a table, where the famous Harry Potter and his sons were sitting. Father really can’t shut up about him, for some reason. “Potter. How surprising it is to see you.” They talked for about a minute or two, and Potter invited us to have breakfast with them.</p><p>“As much as I’d like to, we already-” I cut him off before he could finish. “I’d personally love to have breakfast considering I didn’t get to have any.” I said, looking at my father. “Alright, we’ll have breakfast with you.” I smiled internally smiling at the fact I pissed off my father and slightly embarrassed him, I think. I sat next to the younger one, the one my age, and who looked awkward. “Hello,” I said to him, and he looked at me. “My name’s Scorpius, what’s yours?”</p><p>“Oh, um, my name’s Albus.”</p><p>“Albus? Like Albus Dumbledore?”</p><p>“Yeah…” He said, trailing off. I smiled at him and a waiter came over and asked us what we wanted to eat. “The Pancake Breakfast please.” We said at the same time. When the waiter left, Albus’ brother asked, “Did you two plan that?” We shook our heads.</p><p>After breakfast, Father and Potter decided that we would shop together. We got up and went to a back wall full of bricks. “What is this supposed to be?” Potter then tapped a weird combination in the wall, and all of a sudden the bricks started moving, creating an archway for us to enter. We slowly walked in, and I looked at all the buildings. “Cool,” I muttered. “How much stuff is here?”</p><p>“It’s really like a large marketplace, but it’s nothing special.” Albus said. “Dad, Mr. Malfoy, can we go to Uncle Ron’s shop?” Father and Potter looked at each other. Potter seemed fine with it, Father seemed reluctant to let me go, but he nodded. “Alright, James, go with them.” ‘James’ nodded and Albus started walking along the brick road. I followed him and James caught up to us. “Albus,” I started. “What house do you think you’ll be in?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I hope I get Gryffindor though.”</p><p>“Knowing your edgy ass, you’re probably gonna end up in Slytherin!” James said out of nowhere. “I’m not edgy, James!” Albus said. We approached a building with a glass display of a bunch of joke objects. “Is this it?” I asked the arguing brothers. “Yeah, this is it,” Albus said. “Come on, there’s a couple of things I wanna show you.”</p><p>I nodded and we all walked into the store. I looked around and it was very… colourful. I don’t know how to explain it. As I walked in, my eyes drifted to an area that had these adorable little creatures! I immediately walked over to it and picked up a purple one. It snuggled into my hands and at that moment, I knew it was mine. “You’re so cute!”</p><p>“Yeah, aren’t they?” A sudden voice behind me said. I squealed and kicked behind me. I heard a grunt, so I knew I hit someone. It was a red-headed man, clutching his stomach and groaning. “What have your parents been teaching you?!”</p><p>“Self-defense since I was four, now who are you?!” I yelled.</p><p>“Scorpius, relax! He’s my uncle! He doesn’t wanna hurt you!” Albus said.</p><p>“Oh,” I said, as my shoulders relaxed. “Um, Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine, I can take it. You have a strong kick though.” He said, standing up straight once more. “My name’s Ronald Weasley.”</p><p>“My name’s Scorpius, Scorpius Malfoy.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re a Malfoy.” He said. Oh boy, here we go again. “Uncle Ron, he’s nice!” Albus pitched in my defence. “At least give him a chance!” ‘Ron’ looked as if he was considering being nice to me or not. “Fine,” He said after a couple of minutes. “I’ll give him a chance.”</p><p>“Thanks, Uncle Ron.” Albus said. “Scorp, dad said-”</p><p>“Scorp? Is that my new nickname or something?” I said as Mr. Weasley walked away. “You don’t like it?” Albus asked. “No, I like it, I was just curious.” I said. “Anyway, are you gonna get this Pygmy Puff?”</p><p>“So that’s what they’re called…” I muttered. “Yes, I’ll get it.”</p><p>“What are you gonna name her?”</p><p>“Cassiopeia!” I said after thinking about it. “What were you going to say before I interrupted you?”</p><p>“Oh, dad wants us to go to Ollivander’s to get our wands. And then we’re going to get our robes. And he said we might be going to Magical Menagerie to get a pet.” He said and I nodded. I put Cassiopeia on my head and Albus and I went over to the cashier. James was already talking to the cashier, who was another red-head. “Hi, I’d like to buy this Pygmy Puff please!” I said, way too excited. “Sure, that’ll be four galleons and a sickle.” I put the coins on the counter and Cassie snuggled into my hair.</p><p>“Uncle George, this is my friend, Scorpius.” Albus said. “I heard about you from Ron.” ‘George’ said.</p><p>“Oh,” I muttered. “Sorry if he gave you a hard time, he’s got a bit of a grudge against your family.” He said.</p><p>“And you should too!” Ron said from another stand. “Albus, what are they talking about?” I muttered to him and the two red-heads started arguing. “I dunno.”</p><p>“We’re just gonna go…” Albus said and I nodded. “Bye Uncle George, bye Uncle Ron!” He said and we went to the door where James was waiting outside, talking to a blue-haired boy. “James, let’s go.” Albus said. “Alright, bye Teddy!” James said and Teddy waved, as Albus and I went towards Ollivanders. I took Cassie off my head and snuggled her. We arrived at the shop and went inside where Father and Potter were waiting for us. “Scorpius, what is that?” Father said, looking at Cassiopeia. “She’s my Pygmy Puff.” Father looked at me for a moment and sighed. “Albus, would you like to pick you your wand first?” Albus shrugged and nodded. They went over to the counter where a man, presumably Ollivander, was. “Mister Potter, how wonderful it is to see you!” He said. “This is my son, Albus. We’re here to find a wand for him.”</p><p>Ollivander nodded and picked up a wand from the back. They tried out a few wands, and finally, Ollivander picked out a rowan wood wand with a unicorn hair core, according to Ollivander. It apparently ‘chose him’ or something, I don’t know. Then it was my turn to get a wand. Immediately I was trying out wands so fast that I could barely process it. I was then given an alder wood wand with a dragon heartstring core, also according to Ollivander. I don’t know what it was with this wand, but something just clicked, I don’t know what. I think the wand chose me like Albus’ wand, but I don’t know, I wasn’t paying attention.</p><p>After that was over, we walked to a shop called Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. It was pretty boring, and I didn’t even get to talk to Albus because I was constantly wincing from a needle every five seconds! After that was over, we bought the rest of our supplies, and it was sadly time to leave. “Hey, Scorp.” Albus started. “Since we won’t be able to see each other for a couple of months, owl me, okay?” I nodded and Albus smiled. “Bye, Scorp!” He said and I waved him goodbye. Father apparated us home and gave me all the shopping bags. “Have fun carrying that upstairs.” He said and walked away from me as I dropped all the bags and groaned internally. Mother came downstairs to the front door to help me with the bags. It was painful, but we managed to get all the bags to my room.</p><p>“I think you should start packing when September comes closer, so you can procrastinate, sweetie, I know you love to.” Mother said and smiled at me, although her tone sounded very sarcastic. I nodded and collapsed on my bed as Mother walked away. I heard a squeak near my head, and I saw Cassie, who fell off my head. Orion, the family owl, conveniently came swooping into my room and stayed on the desk, which gave me the idea to write to Albus, even though we just saw each other. It might be a bit clingy, but I don’t care. I got out of bed now that my back was feeling better, and picked up Cassie. I then went over to the desk and sat down, dipped my quill in ink, and wrote on a piece of parchment, "Hi Albus, I know this might seem a little clingy but, I just want to write to you, to see if you get it or not. If you get it, please write me back for verification." I signed it and wrapped it up, writing his name on the outside so Orion would know who to deliver it to. I gave it to him and opened the window. He flew outside and hopefully to Albus. I played with Cassie for a few minutes, and Orion came back with a sheet of lined paper, folded up and with my name on it.</p><p>
  <em>“Hey, Scorp! I don’t think this is really that clingy, I did tell you to owl me, after all. I didn’t expect you to even send anything though, I’m glad you did. You know, you’re actually one of the quickest friends I’ve made, besides my family. Unless we’re just acquaintances. If so, I’d like to be friends. But, I don’t have anything else to say so, bye.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Signed, Albus”</em>
