</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius wakes up at 1 p.m., earlier than usual, to his stomach’s impatient rumbling. He makes his way to the kitchen, hoping to find anything that could quench his hunger. Unfortunately, the fridge is emptier than the capitalist void he is unfortunately stuck in. He groans, realising his position. The young boy is now facing a dilemma — getting dressed and leaving his house to get food or staying and dying of starvation. The latter requires minimal effort, which Scorpius always appreciates, however he feels a craving for some good cheese and Nutella. He sighs — getting ready is tiresome but at least Carrefour is just across the street. He puts of a Misfits shirt, a pair of jeans and the rainbow bowtie he bought in Tiger. Satisfied, he grabs the wallet and the keys and leaves the house, looking like the tired gay legend he is.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He moved in to this flat fairly recently and hasn’t yet been to the Carrefour across the street. When he steps in, Scorpius is greeted with soothing air conditioning and, to his great surprise, BTS’s superior title track Fake Love playing in the background. The three cashiers were dancing along instead of working, one rapping Namjoon’s verse and the other singing Jeongguk’s ‘just for you’s. The third one, from whom Scorpius senses goth vibes, is tumbled over in laughter, recording the two. Once they notice Scorpius’s arrival, they stop their shenanigans and pretend to get back to work with embarrassed smiles on their faces. He found it quite funny, actually, being an Army himself. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius grabs four jars of Nutella and a packet of crisps, puts them in the shopping basket. He finds the cheese aisle quite quickly, however the cheese he wants is on the topmost shelf and he isn’t able to reach it. He jumps up, hand raised as high as possible, but to no avail — the cheese doesn’t budge. Suddenly, one of the cashiers, whose name tag reads ‘Albus’, pops up next to him. They’re good-looking which gets on Scorpius’s nerves — the audacity!</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“May I help you?” they ask with a smile.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Can you get this for me?” Scorpius asks, pointing at the desired product. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sure thing!” Albus says, standing on their tippy toes and easily grabbing the cheese. “Anything else?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Your number, </em>Scorpius thinks, but opts on thanking the person politely. Albus checks him out, both literally and figuratively, with the two other cashiers, ‘Paddie’ and ‘Cyano’ peeking and giggling from behind. Albus looks like they want to kill them, and then themselves, so Scorpius gives them a reassuring smile. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He pretends not to hear Cyano and Paddie tease Albus about their ‘<em>new cruuuuush’</em> as he leaves. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">2. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The second time Scorpius goes to Carrefour is a few days later, because he needs to restock on instant soups and he might have caught himself missing the cute cashier. This time he smears eyeliner around his eyes and wears his coolest lip-ring, knowing he rocks the aesthetic. To his relief, Albus is there, but this time they are alone. They look bored to say the least, but their face glows up when he sees Scorpius.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hi, welcome to Chilli’s, I mean Carrefour,” Albus greets him. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Whaddup, you’re Albus, you’re a millennial and you never fucking learned where you work,” Scorpius jokes, proud that he manages to elicit a chortle from the cashier. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He grabs all the vegetarian Vifons and heads back to the cash register. Albus gives him a knowing grin. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And you dare call me the millennial,” they say, scanning the products. “The total is 35.87. Card or cash?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Cash,” Scorpius replies, “can you give me a moment, though. I need to count something and I’m not very good at maths.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Understandable,” Albus laughs. Scorpius pulls out his phone and opens the calculator app. After a while he hands the cashier exactly 36.56zl. Albus is confused until they realise what the change amounts to.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Here you go, 69 groszy, you know what that means?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t have enough for chicken nuggets,” Scorpius pouts exaggeratedly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus’s laugh, he comes to realise, is melodic to his ears. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">3. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If Scorpius had a group of friends like the main characters in Comedy Central sitcoms, they would have staged an intervention by now. He finds himself opening the door to the Carrefour for the third time this week. Paddie smiles and greets him when he enters. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Albus is in the back,” they say, “assuming you were looking for him.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Am I that obvious?” Scorpius asks, to which the cashier nods. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He does find the boy in one of the alleys, passionately explaining something to a confused looking customer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“This is spicy and the other is mild, like more pepper, less pepper,” Albus tells the lady, pointing at the jars of tomato sauce in her hands.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“</span><span class="s2">я</span> <span class="s2">не</span> <span class="s2">понимаю</span><span class="s1">,” the woman replies. Scorpius decides to use his knowledge of Russian to step in and help.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“</span><span class="s2">Это</span> <span class="s2">пряный</span><span class="s1">,” he tells the customer, “</span><span class="s2">в</span> <span class="s2">то</span> <span class="s2">время</span> <span class="s2">как</span> <span class="s2">этот</span> <span class="s2">мягкий</span><span class="s1">.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“</span>
  <span class="s2">Спасибо</span>
  <span class="s1">,” the woman nods in gratitude and leaves. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus sighs in relief, “thank you so much, I was literally going to combust. Why are human interactions so stressful?” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Is it a cue for me to leave?” Scorpius jokes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No!” Albus exclaims in fear. “No, you’re nice, I’m sorry. Hi, by the way.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hi,” Scorpius smiles widely, “it’s okay, don’t apologise. How are you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good, now that you’re here,” the cashier says, voice raised slightly unnaturally, “I’ve been meaning to ask, what’s your name?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Scorpius,” he answers, “but please don’t call me Scor or Scorp, or else I’ll spontaneously combust.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Noted,” Albus laughs, “can I call you Pius, though? Like the Popes?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sure, Bus,” Scorpius says, “like the public transport. Vroom vroom.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They can hear Paddie calling Cyano and livestreaming their conversation for them. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m sorry for them, they are what the kids call buffoons,” Albus sighs.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s fine, sweet ray of sunshine,” Scorpius assures him, “it’s as fine as butter and banana on a hot summer day in the Caribbean.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He only gets an ice cream this time, but it was nice to see the boy again. Scorpius is already planning on excuses to go to the Carrefour again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">4. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s not as fun the fourth time he goes to Carrefour and misses Albus’s shift. At least BTS is still playing, although it’s a Love Yourself: Her playlist and Scorpius enjoys their other albums more. Cyano and Paddie are both there. To his surprise, they start a conversation with him even without Albus around. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hi, Scorpius,” Cyano says, “you missed Albus, but come chat with us. We promise we’re cool, too.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know, guys,” Scorpius says, “you rock the goth and dad shirt aesthetic, only the greatest individuals are able to do that. And you’re Armys! Namjoon invented communism.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ugh, your mind…” Paddie exclaims, “we stan so hard.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“By the way,” Cyano changes the topic, “can you <em>please</em> ask Albus on a date? He is a lonely, single gay and we’ve had enough of him talking about your eyes and how he got that cheese for you. Save us, we beg you…”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh sweet nuggets!” Scorpius says. “But it’s so hard to just ask someone out, can’t he do it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Gosh, I’m so sorry for your loss of braincells,” Paddie sighs, “seriously, just try. He’d agree if you proposed, he is a braincell deprived homosexual.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Valid…I’ll think about it,” Scorpius promises. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We have flowers on sale for 2.99, if you need them,” Cyano adds, helpfully.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius is faced with the second greatest dilemma in his life, so he gets not one but three bananas and munches on them, trying to make a decision.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">1</span></li>
</ul><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s a Tuesday when Scorpius heads to Carrefour, with his look on point and a bouquet of origami tulips in hand. He sees Albus from outside, checking out a customer. He takes a deep breath and walks into the shop. Ignoring the cue to the cash register, he bravely walks towards Albus and gives him the flowers. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Albus, will you go on a date with me and help me pick up cheese from the top shelves?” Scorpius asks. “Perks of dating me: I love hugs, will hug you a lot and have a reverse mullet sometimes. It’s nice to run your hand through it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Paddie and Cyano, who are standing next by, have both of their phone’s up, recording the event. Albus looks surprised, but happy.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’d love to go on a date with you, Pius,” he gushes, accepting the flowers, “thank you so much, ah!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The people queing give the gays a round of applause in excitement. Albus hides his head in his hands, embarrassed but happy. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I love you, Bus,” Scorpius says, strumming an invisible guitar.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, my God!” Paddie exclaims from the side.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I ain’t ever gonna stop loving you, Bus!”</span>
