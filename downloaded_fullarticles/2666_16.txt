<p>Hello, my name is Death.<br/>
You may have heard of me.<br/>
Some people know me by ‘Grim Reaper’, of course, but I much prefer Death. It has a much nicer ring to it.<br/>
I’m here to tell you a story.<br/>
This story is about a girl called Ginevra Weasley. She was a colourful girl – red comes immediately to mind, as does green. Green eyes and deep, deep red hair.<br/>
But I’m getting ahead of myself.<br/>
Please do excuse me.<br/>
Ginevra Weasley saw me three times.</p>
<p>///</p>
<p>The first time was when Ginevra was very little, but six, I would imagine. It was a party. Humans love the things, particularly Ginevra’s family. Their house was clean and all the family was invited.<br/>
When I arrive for Elanor Weasley, I am too early.<br/>
It happens occasionally.<br/>
I greatly dislike it when I am early, because then, you see, I have to wait. I have to watch as the last breath leaves the body. As healers are called for, and as children start to cry. And then the soul relaxes. And I pry it from the body, and disappear hurriedly.<br/>
Ginevra Weasley was sitting on her grandmother’s lap in a chair apart from the rest of the festivities. The rest of the guests were under the pavilion, laughing and probably drinking too much butterbeer. Elanor was telling Ginevra a story, still very much alive.<br/>
I lean in closer.<br/>
“It was a hard time,” Elanor says, quite softly to Ginevra.<br/>
“Why, Grandmama?”<br/>
“Because, my child, bad things happen. Terrible, terrible things happen. Your grandfather – “<br/>
Her breathing becomes husky. I prepare myself.<br/>
“Grandmama, are you okay?” Ginevra slides off Elanor’s lap in concern.<br/>
Elanor seizes her grandaughter’s hands, clutching them tightly. “My child. My heart.”<br/>
Her hands shake in Ginevra’s, and she clasps them – “Grandma! What hurts?”<br/>
“Harry Potter. He saved us all. Death, Ginny – death is coming –“<br/>
The gnarled hands relax.<br/>
Ginevra screams. People come running. Healers are called for.<br/>
In the middle of the chaos, I step in and gently pull the old soul from its body. It is warm in my arms.<br/>
I carry it away, leaving the Weasleys behind me.<br/>
At the last moment, I turn. I cannot help it. Sometimes I wish I had not.<br/>
Ginevra is looking straight at me, staring into me, piercing me with her brown eyes.<br/>
I close my eyes and disappear.<br/>
That look will haunt me for years and years to come.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>The darkness slivers and hisses out of the snake.<br/>
A girl lies on the tile floor, her fierce hair spread around her like blood.<br/>
Darkness hisses, loud and quiet in the same moment.<br/>
It hovers over the girl –<br/>
And slithers in.<br/>
At home at last.</p></div>
