    <p>Moria watched from the compartment on the train departed from the station waving at her anxious uncles and aunt, many of who were either crying or about to cry. She stared at them and continued waving, a twinge hitting her heart as she waved back, a slight smile on her face. But other than that, her face was void of any emotion. She hadn't shown any emotion in years…it was too dangerous to show emotion. She watched as the scenery continued to skirt past the window anticipation filling her.<br/><br/>Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br/><br/>She had never heard of that school till this summer…had never known about that she was a witch. It had been quite a shock to see an old woman in strange garb standing at the foot of her entrance. She introduced herself as Minerva McGonagall. The older woman then informed her and her family what she was truly capable of, and had suggested that she enroll in the school that would train her powers. When she had she had never seen her uncles and aunts argue about whether not she could go. Eventually they conceded and after that she had a local witch help her buy the books that she had needed. She had promised to send letters once she got there, granted she wasn't sure if her aunts and uncles would appreciate an owl sending their mail…but whatever, there wasn't a whole lot of choice that they had. She pulled out an aged picture, staring at the man and woman in the picture, before shaking her head, placing it back into the book. Suddenly the door to her compartment opened and her light brown eyes watched in curiosity as a pair of kids her age walked in.<br/><br/>"-that ignorant, selfish jerk! AUGH!"<br/><br/>"Lily, I can't agree with you more." A young boy with long black hair and a rather large nose replied. The red head girl who apparently was Lily nodded then noticed that Moria was now staring at her inquisitively. Her face soon after became the same color of her hair.<br/><br/>"Oh I'm sorry! I didn't know-!" She began to stutter out and Moria waved her hand nonchalantly.<br/><br/>"Meh. It's okay. You can sit here if you want."<br/><br/>"You sure we won't be a bother?" Lily asked. Moria looked around at the empty seats.<br/><br/>"I'm pretty sure the invisible people can make room." She said sarcastically giving her a small smile. Lily smiled and then dragging the boy in sat down next to her.<br/><br/>"Hi my name's Lily Evan's, muggle-born." The girl said pleasantly. Moria smiled.<br/><br/>"Moria Prescott, muggle-born as well. Pleased to meet you too." She replied then looked at the boy who was staring at the floor.<br/><br/>"What about you?" she asked. He glanced over at her.<br/><br/>"Severus Snape." He said simply not making eye-contact with her. She blinked then heard the door open again. The trio looked up and saw a girl with dark hair peering in.<br/><br/>"Um…can I join you?" the girl asked. Severus rolled his eyes but both Lily and Moria nodded. The girl beamed.<br/><br/>"Hello. My name is Alice Lahr!" she said cheerfully as she sat down, clutching a toad to her. Moria looked at the three in slight amusement.<br/><br/>Yep. Things were definitely looking up.</p><hr/><p><br/>"GRYFFINDOR!" the hat that was currently placed on top of her dark-brunette head called out. The table that apparently she would sit at cheered loudly. She hopped off the stool and walked over to her table, plopping next to Lily, who smiled.<br/><br/>"That's great! You, Alice, and me are in the same House!" she cheered happily. Moria smirked at her.<br/><br/>"Too bad Severus isn't in our house." Alice commented though to Moria it seemed that she was actually relieved that the boy wasn't in Gryffindor. Lily nodded apparently not seeing the look. She glared at the two boys that were sitting near them.<br/><br/>"But why did THEY have to be in our house?" she spat out spitefully. Moria shrugged.<br/><br/>"Well let's not spoil the fun right away." Alice said in a sing-song voice. Lily glanced at the boys and saw that they were moving down. She stiffened enough for Moria to notice and she sighed.<br/><br/>"Alright Lily, switch with me." She ordered and the girl followed instructions sliding to where Moria had been sitting and allowing Moria to take her spot. The two boys stopped next to her.<br/><br/>"Hi! My name is James Potter!" the boy who wore the glasses said to her grinning from ear to ear. She looked at him with a bored expression, pausing only to clap as another person was sent to their table.<br/><br/>"Moria Prescott."</p><p>"Where are you from?" </p><p>"Scotland." She replied, brow rising. He reminded her of her uncles. "Sorry but I'm not switching seats with you." She said before he even asked. He frowned as did the other boy that had followed him.<br/><br/>"Aw, come on." The other one said.<br/><br/>"What's your name?" she asked smoothly, gaining an &lt;i&gt;'hmph'&lt;/i&gt; from Lily.<br/><br/>"Sirius Black." He replied easily giving her an innocent smile. She smirked.<br/><br/>"Hello Mr. Black. Sorry but I can't. I'm under strict orders not to." She replied just as easily, mentally grinning when he realized the sweet innocent smile wasn't working. She heard Lily and Alice giggle softly. And for once in so many years…<br/><br/>She was happy.</p><p>Maybe this was a start of a new beginning.</p>
