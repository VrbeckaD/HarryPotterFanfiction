    <p>The moment Harry saw Draco slip into Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, he knew that something was wrong. Harry hadn’t <em>meant </em>to stalk his former archrival again. It wasn’t even really stalking, he didn’t think Draco was up to anything. He was just… concerned. Not that either Ron or Hermione would believe that. He could see the pitying looks they gave him whenever they thought he wasn’t looking. He knew they were concerned that he was falling back into the same old habit of following Draco’s every move like he had in sixth year. But things were different this time.</p>
<p>Draco was different, for starters. There was something about him that just seemed so small after the war. He had returned to Hogwarts in perhaps the most courageous thing Harry had ever seen from the blond thus far, but he wasn’t the Draco Malfoy everyone knew. He wasn’t the Draco people remembered. He was different. Drastically different. Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but he knew he had to follow him and try to figure it out.</p>
<p>The bathroom was still, and for a brief moment, Harry was certain that Draco had simply vanished somehow and that he’d missed him. He had kept a respectable distance so as not to catch Draco’s attention, but he knew he had seen him heading this way and he was fairly certain he’d even seen him entering the bathroom, but for the life of him, he couldn’t see anyone. Harry sighed, turning on his heel, he had almost made it to the door when he heard a soft sniffle coming from one of the toilets that was distinctly <em>not </em>Myrtle. Harry froze, straining to hear the noise again. The softest little sniffle he had ever heard. Harry turned back towards the bathroom and made his way towards the individual stalls. They had all looked open, and he’d seen no one’s feet dangling either, and then he heard it, a soft hiccup coming from the stall to his right. Harry turned towards the sound, and pushed the door open. There, sitting on the toilet with his legs curled up to his chest was Draco Malfoy. For a brief moment, Harry was so taken aback to see Draco sitting there sobbing that he almost didn’t notice the fact that Draco had something nestled in his arms. A fuzzy black teddy bear that was clutched so tightly to his chest that Harry was certain Draco was attempting to meld it with his own flesh. He didn’t know what possessed him in that moment to draw attention to himself, nor did he understand why he found the sight of Draco holding a teddy bear so endearingly adorable or why it made him <em>desperately </em>wish to protect him. He barely had time to register all those emotions before Draco had looked up at him, his bottom lip quivering as tears ran down his face.</p>
<p>Without thinking, Harry instinctively reached out and wiped the tear from Draco’s eye with his thumb. “That’s a very cute bear you’ve got there,” Harry said softly, the way he might speak to Teddy. “What’s his name?”</p>
<p>Draco swallowed, if he was taken aback by Harry’s quiet kindness he made no mention of it.</p>
<p>“Harold,” he replied easily, though his voice sounded somehow smaller than it had before. Not quieter exactly, just… sweet. Harry merely smiled. “Cause he always protects me.” Harry nodded at that.</p>
<p>“As well every teddy bear should,” he replied. Draco looked up at him again, his eyes wide and full of awe. Harry barely resisted the urge to pull the blond into his arms. “Would you like me to walk you to your dorm?”</p>
<p>Draco sniffed, and nodded, holding out his hand for Harry to take. Harry smiled softly at Draco, and took his hand, helping him carefully off the toilet and walked with him out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>The Slytherin dungeons were not very far from the toilets, though Harry suspected they would get many odd looks at the fact he was currently holding Draco Malfoy’s hand, walking him down to his dorm, Harry didn’t care. If he was honest, he couldn’t explain any of it himself. The sight of Draco just looking so small and helpless had changed something for Harry. It didn’t make sense, but he <em>knew </em>he had to help.</p>
<p>“Do you know the new password?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>Draco sniffed again, and nodded, clutching Harold tight to his chest, then leaned towards Harry and whispered the password into his ear. Harry nodded, and told the portrait the password. The portrait swung open and Harry was about to let him go when Draco squeezed his hand tight, staring into the endless black void of the Slytherin dungeons that lay ahead. “Would you stay with me?” he asked in that same small, watery voice he had used before. “I’m scared.”</p>
<p>For a brief moment, Harry considered this bit of information. He had never known Draco to be scared of the dark before, but then, he hadn’t <em>really </em>known Draco at all, had he?</p>
<p>He knew what Hermione would say. <em>What if it</em><em>’s a trick Harry?</em></p>
<p>He knew what Ron would say too. <em>Why you gonna help that tosser for anyway? </em>But Harry had never been able to resist the urge to help someone in need. Even if that someone <em>was </em>Draco Malfoy. Harry merely nodded quietly, giving Draco’s hand a comforting squeeze and pulled out his wand. “Lumos,” he whispered. The tip of the wand lit up and Harry walked Draco through the door, deeper into the Slytherin common room than he had been in quite some time. It hadn’t changed of course, though it was decidedly even more empty than it had been that first time. In fact, he was fairly certain there was no one else there at all until…</p>
<p>“There you are!” a voice shrieked from behind them. Harry turned around. <em>Parkinson. </em>He thought. “I’ve been looking all over for you,” she admonished, not unlike Mrs. Weasley, he noted, though wisely did not point out to the witch. Harry had the distinct and confusing urge to stand in front of Draco then, and protect him from her wrath. Before he could, however, Pansy walked over to them as if she hadn’t seen Harry, and took Draco’s free hand, and walked him into the dormitory without another word. Harry stared at the spot where the two of them had been just a moment before, feeling a mixture of sadness and confusion. He wasn’t sure what had happened or why. Why Pansy had completely ignored his existence, or why he felt so annoyed that she had just pushed him off like that. But here he was.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure whether or not he should leave or stay, and for a long moment, though he didn’t know how long exactly he found himself glued to the spot, unable to move, as if compelled by some invisible force to stay where he was. Eventually, he realized that Pansy was not going to return and with a beleaguered sigh, made his way towards the dorm exit when he heard the dormitory door open suddenly and Pansy reappeared.</p>
<p>“I see your still here,” Pansy said, her arms folded across her chest. “Want to gawk then is it? Kick the boy while he’s small?”</p>
<p>“No,” Harry said quickly. “I wouldn’t…”</p>
<p>“Why should I believe that?” Pansy sniffed.</p>
<p>Harry gave her a hard look then. He wanted to argue that she had no business even questioning him, but of course, she had been Draco’s friend for years. Whereas Harry was merely inexplicably protective of Draco for reasons he didn’t understand himself. “I walked him down here didn’t I?” Harry argued.</p>
<p>Pansy snorted, “Oh well, saint Potter, would you like a medal?”</p>
<p>“No, I just…” Harry shook his head. He didn’t know what he wanted.</p>
<p>“He said you complimented Harold,” Pansy said after a moment.</p>
<p>“It’s a cute bear.”</p>
<p>Pansy pinched the bridge of her nose. “Look, Potter. I don’t know what your game is, but I do know that Draco is dealing with a lot right now, and as his best friend, I’m looking after him. I’m not… what he wants but I’m what he’s got, so just leave us alone,” she snapped.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. “I…” he wanted to argue. To lash out, though for the life of him he couldn’t understand why. What was it about <em>this </em>Draco that had suddenly caught Harry’s attention in a way that he didn’t understand? What was it about <em>this </em>particular Draco that made Harry feel so… determined to get close to him? “I’m sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean anything by coming down here I was just… concerned about him.”</p>
<p>“Why? Since when do you even care?” Pansy asked, looking visibly annoyed.</p>
<p>“He’s just seemed so different since after the war,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“War changes a person, especially with what he went through.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Do you? Do you really even have a clue? I know you think he’s just some Death Eater.”</p>
<p>“I don’t,” Harry argued. At this Pansy raised an eyebrow. “I admit, I did. For a long time I was suspicious, of course. How could I not be? But… he’s… clearly different,” Harry added.</p>
<p>“Yes well… I expect you’re different too,” Pansy said. Harry nodded, he couldn’t begin to explain how much he had changed these past few months. For a brief moment it seemed as though Pansy wished to say something more, only she didn’t. It was clear there was something she didn’t feel she <em>could </em>say about the situation, so instead Harry merely nodded.</p>
<p>“I should go,” he said solemnly.</p>
<p>“I’ll make sure he thanks you in the morning,” Pansy said. “If he’s not feeling too bratty by then.”</p>
<p>Harry chuckled, and with that, he turned on his heel and made his way out of the Slytherin common room, thinking all the while about how Draco had changed, and how the thought of a bratty Draco seemed more adorable now than it ever had during the previous seven years he had known him. He didn’t know what any of it meant, he wasn’t even sure he totally understood what was happening anymore. But he knew with a certainty he was sure he had never experienced before, that he wanted to find out.</p>
