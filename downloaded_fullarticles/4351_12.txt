    <b>July 1979</b>
  </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Remus Lupin woke up he was surprised to find a banana, rather than his boyfriend Sirius Black lying on a pillow next to him. Remus licked his lips. A banana sounded delightful but his mouth tasted like shite and his head pulsated painfully. Another night out drinking firewhisky, he supposed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He stretched and rolled out of bed, scratching his bum as soon as he was on his feet. He wandered over to the loo, looking down and noticing someone funny as he relieved himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What the bloody hell?” he whispered down at his own cock.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He flushed the toilet then dashed into his bedroom, looking for some better light. He pulled on his cock and squinted down at it. It was unmistakable. He would know that shade of red lipstick anywhere as belonging to his best friend, Lily Evans.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What the fuck happened?” he asked his red tinted friend, hanging limply in his hand as if it were capable of answering.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He absolutely could not let Sirius see this before he had a chance to figure out what happened. They’d only been dating for around six months and Sirius had already proven himself to be a tad jealous from time to time. Remus shuddered to imagine what would happen if Sirius found him red-handed… well, red-cocked, he supposed with a sigh.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Just then Remus began to smell something. Something was <em>burning</em>. Remus grabbed his wand from the top of his dresser.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fire!” he shouted, dashing out of the bedroom, seeing smoke pouring out of the kitchen as held forth his wand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s all right! I’ve got it!” a voice that was not his boyfriend’s called out.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Aguamenti!” Remus shouted, spraying the kitchen and the source of the voice with water.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Merlin, Moony! I was just using the toastie maker!” James Potter complained, looking very soggy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Not correctly, you weren’t! What the hell, Prongs?” Remus asked, as James tossed a burnt sandwich in the bin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was at this point that James noticed what Remus himself had forgot: he was still naked. His spectacle covered hazel eyes gazed between Remus’s thighs, his mouth falling open.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh. Shit. I’ll be right back,” Remus said, starting to head back to the bedroom before James said, “Wait!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus stopped, his bottom facing James.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Blimey, I never thought I’d be saying this but… can I take another look at your cock?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus gave James a look of shock but shrugged and turned around. He wasn’t shy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I knew it! I’d recognise that ring around a cock anywhere. That’s Lily’s lipstick. Any last words before I murder you?” James asked with a fierce glare.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Now, listen, Prongs, there’s a rational explanation for this!” Remus sputtered as James stepped towards him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James stopped halfway and laughed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m just taking the piss, mate. Lily was with me all night. She was actually just here. She went out to get some eggs.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus sighed with relief.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s the best news I’ve heard all morning. I didn’t want to have explain to my jealous boyfriend that I might’ve let Lily suck me off last night.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Would you have?” James asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What?” Remus replied, blinking.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No judging. I’m just wondering. If Lils like pulled you into an alley and offered to suck you off. Would you give her a go?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus stared at his friend with total shock, still really wanting to get cleaned up and dressed. He also didn’t want to explain that he and Lily had already done some experimenting back at Hogwarts. He would leave that for Lily someday.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No. I wouldn’t. I mean… Maybe if were were both completely pissed but… if I was sober and aware, never. She’s your fiancée. I would never want to interfere with your relationship.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James grinned.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re a hell of a bloke, Moony,” James said, patting Remus on the shoulder with a dark hand as the front door opened, both of them jumping and James pulling his hand away.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily stared at them both, her green eyes bouncing back and forth, as she clutched her grocery bag to her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What’s all this then?” she asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Moony was just showing me his cock,” James offered.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Was he? That’s fair, I suppose. But maybe Remus would like to… Wait. Hang on now,” Lily said, quickly approaching, her eyes fixed on Remus’s cock.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Bloody hell,” Remus muttered under his breath.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s my lipstick on your knob, mate,” Lily observed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, that was why Prongs was having a gander,” Remus offered.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, is that what he told you?” Lily said, giving her fiancé a wink.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James’s dark cheeks reddened and he awkwardly laughed. Remus could feel blood rushing down below and definitely didn’t want to get a sodding erection at a moment like this.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Lils… have you seen Sirius?” Remus inquired.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Not since last night, no,” she replied, putting the eggs up in Remus’s refrigerator.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus sighed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So what happened last night? I remember we were going to the Leaky Cauldron but everything is blurry after that.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, the five us went there. You lot were downing firewhisky like there was no tomorrow while I just had a couple of glasses of Elf-made wine. You and Sirius were snogging up a storm. I said you should get a room so the two of you took off. That was the last I saw either of you until just now. Oh, and earlier I did notice my lipstick was missing from my purse. Take that for what you will,” Lily explained.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus scratched his head feeling like things were making more sense but several mysteries, particular the banana on his pillow, remained to be resolved. Then the front door opened once more, his boyfriend entering and looking oddly ashamed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Moony… why are you standing there with your willy hanging out?” Sirius gasped and pointed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Because everyone keeps asking to bloody see it!” Remus snarled.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I mean it’s beautiful, so I get that but… any particular reason why… wait… Ohhhh,” Sirius said, seeming to have been hit by a revelation.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, I don’t suppose you know how some of Lily’s lipstick got on it, do you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius grinned, seeming proud of himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I do, yeah. Sort of. I don’t remember but I did wake up with lipstick on my face this morning when I got up to take care of the thing…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What thing?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, it’s nothing,” Sirius said, sitting down on the sofa and wincing with obvious pain.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“This is proving to be a very entertaining morning, lads,” Lily said with glee.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What did you do, Padfoot?” Remus asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Went to sit down on the loo this morning. Felt something stinging. Looked in the mirror and discovered the worst ever tattoo of a Hippogriff bursting through a window you’ve ever seen right on my arse.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Can we see it!” Lily asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No. I’ve had it removed, obviously. I can show the patch where the wizard blasted it off, though.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius stood up and pulled his trousers and pants down, revealing his left arse cheek was swollen and red.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Merlin’s arse!” James called out.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah,” Sirius grumbled pulling his trousers back up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Padfoot… will you join me in the bedroom? There’s one more mystery I need solving,” Remus asked, beckoning his boyfriend with a finger.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Let’s go, James. Give the lads some space, shall we?” Lily said, taking James, who was still soaked from Remus’s spell, by the hand.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Cheers, Lils,” Remus said as the two of them left the flat and Sirius followed him into the bedroom.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So what’s the deal with the banana?” Remus asked, pointing over at the fruit a thumb.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“How should I know?” Sirius asked earnestly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Remus stared up into his grey eyes, finding not a hint of mischief, disappointing him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Really?” Remus asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It was there when I woke up. I assumed you put it there.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Padfoot… I don’t have any bananas. Where did we even get a banana?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius shrugged.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It was a long night. Who knows what we got up to? Maybe you just wanted a banana. Personally, there’s something else I’d rather stick in my mouth,” Sirius smoothly chuckled, leaning down into a deep snog.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You crafty bastard,” Remus moaned, feeling his greatly scrutinised cock stiffening between them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sorry, I keep glancing at that ring around your cock and I’m jealous of the bastard who got to put it there,” Sirius said.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, let me go clean up then you can see about making him jealous right back,” Remus winked, heading off to the shower.</span>
