    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>Naruto fidgeted with his Hogwarts robe in anticipation in what house he’d end up in. Hufflepuff maybe? Naruto never really did fit in considering he was an orphan who had no real wizarding skills. Or Slytherin? He had dreams that he’d do almost anything to make a reality. Merlin knows. </p><p>But Naruto knew one thing.He had to make a good impression if he wanted to have friends so Naruto tapped the shoulder of the dark haired girl in front of him. She looked nice.<br/>“Hey.” Her face was turning red and she her large, lavender, pupil-less eyes where terribly startled. Well, this is weird, Naruto thought to himself. At least he won’t be the only weirdo.<br/>“So what house do you think you’ll end up in?” The strange girl brought her thumbs together and turned away from Naruto. Weirdo. So naturally her and Naruto would inevitably become great friends.</p><p>“Don’t mind Hinata. She’s just nervous. My name is Shikamaru Nara, umm, and hi”. The voice was uninterested and lazy as was the appearance of the lanky owner of the voice.</p><p>“ I’m Naruto Uzumaki, and I will become a great wizard!”</p><p>“Hold up. Uzumaki?” Shikamaru looked at Naruto incredulously, his lazy eyes widening in surprise.</p><p>“The Uzumaki clan were wiped out eight years ago! They are all dead!”</p><p>“Do I look dead to you?” </p><p>“Somewhat. But whatever, it’s troublesome anyway.” Naruto internally snorted. Shikamaru was way more dead-looking than he was. He turned his attention to the sorting hat.</p><p>“Hinata Hyuga!” The strange girl with the shoulder length hair walked up to the platform with her head facing the ground. Her face showed a mixture of emotions, from irritation to wonder. He didn’t blame her, the sorting hat clearly possesses and unregulated amount of sass shown by how it riled up the really pretty yet rather annoying blond girl, Ino, who eventually ended up in Ravenclaw.</p><p>“Slytherin!” the sorting hat yelled. Slytherin? That can’t possibly be right. That shy weirdo couldn’t possibly be evil Naruto thought to himself as he watched her join the table with the bastard, Sasuke, and some blond girl with crazy pigtail thingies. </p><p>“Kiba Inuzuka!” He is going to be in Gryffindor, Naruto thought to himself. Kiba was friendly, loud and obnoxious and also clearly begging for attention with those red inverted triangles on his cheeks.</p><p>“Gryffindor!” ‘Ha!’ Naruto thought to himself. ‘I could be a seer!’</p><p>‘Gaara no Sabaku!’ He was artsy clearly considering he is wearing eyeliner. Ravenclaw maybe?</p><p>“Slytherin!” Oh.</p><p>“Tenten Yarime!” The girl was pretty but menacing looking with Chinese buns and Kunai in her robes. Slytherin, yes definitely Slytherin.</p><p>“Hufflepuff!” ‘So much for being a seer.’ Naruto sighed.</p><p>“Neji Hyuga!” Naruto widened his eyes. This guy was beautiful. Sasuke and Ino were also beautiful but this guy was on a whole other level. There was a bandanna covering his forehead. And his eyes, Merlin his eyes. Hinata may of had the exact same eyes but they looked so wonderful on him. But he was unattainable and probably a Slytherin like Hinata.</p><p>“Ravenclaw!” Neji bowed his head then walked towards the table with Ino. </p><p>“I saw you staring at Hyuga. Don’t bother, he doesn’t let anything or anyone close to him.” Shikamaru had a slight smirk on his face. Was Naruto really that obvious though?</p><p>“Naruto Uzumaki!” Naruto walked up the steps of the platform where Lady Tsunade would put the sorting hat on his head. He shouldn’t be nervous. It wasn’t a big deal. But Naruto was indeed nervous.</p><p>“An Uzumaki, huh? Not particularly wise. But there is ambition. Slytherin perhaps? No. You are too loyal” The hat seemed to whisper in Naruto’s ear.</p><p>“Gryffindor!” Naruto leapt off the platform and hurried to the Gryffindor table next to Kiba and somebody with a ridiculous haircut and eyebrows. Sakura later joined them on the Gryffindor table and Naruto felt content with his house.</p>
