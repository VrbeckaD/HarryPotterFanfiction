  <strong>Foreword</strong>
</p>
<p>This is my version of the literary tradition known as the foreword. In this case, I will use it to let you know in advance some of the thinking that went into this story project, explain what kind of story I intend to write, and generally warn you in advance about what you're walking into. If you're not interested, feel free to scroll ahead to the Prolog, which is also in this 'chapter'. But when a plot point or a pairing appears that you don't agree with, you might want to check back here to see if I warned you about it BEFORE you send the nasty review or e-mail.</p>
<p><br/><strong>1</strong>: As this story began before book six came out, I will continue it as if books six and seven DO NOT EXIST. This foreword was originally written before book six as well. I have tried to rewrite/update it, but time is still far too short these days. So, for now, I ask you to treat this foreword as if book six and seven do not exist.</p>
<p>That said, I do know that there are a few plot points I had planned that, while not identical to some things J.K. Rowling did in books six and seven, they landed in the same ballpark. I can honestly say that I have tried not to change what I was already going to do. I will note one exception. As a life long RPG player, I was going to heavily modify the Dungeons and Dragons enchantment “Magic Jar” to explain Harry’s scar. Sound familiar? No, my result was not EXACTLY like her horcrux. But it was close enough, I can’t help but wonder who the gamer is in her life. Anyway, my result felt awkward and long-winded, I decided to try to blend hers and mine. The result, while still long-winded, doesn’t feel nearly as awkward as either, so I have decided to go with it.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>: When it comes to canon, I think we all realize that there are multiple sources for information and interpretation, and these sources don't always agree. For the purpose of writing this story, I have ranked these sources. Then, when a conflict arises, there will be a clear method to determine which source to use. The order of priority is as follows.</p>
<p>First, the FIRST FIVE BOOKS themselves. The 5th has highest priority, then it goes backwards in order.<br/>Second, the INTERVIEWS and OFFICIAL INTERNET CHATS with J.K. Rowling, the most recent I have first.<br/>Third, the website HP Lexicon.</p>
<p>If this puts me in conflict with your favorite Harry Potter information site, I ask you to remember that the people who run those sites are as human as I am. They will prioritize the data as they believe is correct, and I will do so as I believe is correct. All I can do is promise that I will not do anything that I believe would make this story out of canon by the standard listed above. If you read something you believe is a canon problem, e-mail me, and I'll let you know why I did it as I did. I might even fix it.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>: For the Latin and Welsh translations I will use for original spells, I will be using Goggle Translate. I had been using a different website, but it no longer works. I guess things can change after a decade.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>: I know from my first long fanfic that it is much easier to change the story’s perspective to wherever the action is. However, I'm going to try to avoid that here. I'll do this like JKR did her books. With very few exceptions, the story will unfold for the readers as you watch it unfold for Harry. And even the exceptions have JKR precedent, such as the opening chapter of both Book One and Book Four.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>: I'm not going to have the bodies of named characters "piled up like cordwood." However, it is war, and people you know about will die. Including some deaths that happen before we first see Harry. And one of the people who dies then will bear the name Weasley. I’m sorry if that bothers you, but I believe it to be necessary to attempt to reflect war’s true nature in this story. That said, I believe that this war would most likely be fought primarily as a guerilla war, with few if any battles larger than a couple dozen per side. Remember, this is wizarding England, not World War I.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong>: People handle grief differently. While some people break down emotionally, I expect that if this were true of Harry to the extent some people have had it, he would have been far less functional at the train station at the end of OotP. That's not to say I think Harry's going to be emotionless about it. It wouldn't surprise me if Harry has at least one good cry over it, and I expect him to have moments when his sadness about Sirius pushes itself forward similar to when Moody showed him that photo of his parents as part of the original Order. But the complete breakdown so many writers give him? It seems to me that Harry's made of sterner stuff than that.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong>: The next thing is about shipping. Frankly, I believe that shipper wars are complete wastes of time and energy. I can be as comfortable reading a Harry/Ginny as I can be a Harry/Hermione or a Harry/Luna or a Harry/Tonks. And before anybody tries to read anything into that sentence, note that the girls’ names are in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>As far as the ships in this story are concerned, I'm going to try to write this story in a way that reflects that kind of flexibility. I know how easy it makes it for a fanfic writer to get their favorite pair together early. But given Harry's . . . less than stellar record with girls, do you really think he'll "suddenly see the light" about anybody, at least this summer? I don't. I actually know whom I plan on having Harry ends up with. You probably do too, as the story is filtered for that pairing. But I'm going to give him at least one, and maybe as many as three, girlfriends before he finally starts a romantic relationship with the future Mrs. Potter. And their romance won't happen until sometime in seventh year. In fact, of all the student couples that board the Hogwarts Express at the start of Harry's sixth year, I plan for only one will be intact through the end of his seventh. And that will be the only one that, prior to book six, JKR has all but explicitly admitted in interviews would be together, Ron and Hermione. If any of that is something you cannot handle, then I invite you to the exit.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong>: I've seen too many promising stories that I've had to drop because it became obvious they were written by a hater. Some still hating Ron for his initial reaction to Harry being Tri-Wizard champion. Others hate one of the girls because they see her as a threat to their favorite ship. And of course there are the Dumbledore haters who, apparently, have never made a well-intentioned mistake in their lives. Really makes me wonder how these people keep human friends. I'm not going to waste my time debating with these people, as I've found they often lack the brain cells necessary to see any points they didn't start with. So I'll just say this: If you're a hater, you should probably leave now. While some characters will make mistakes, that's part of being a sentient, intelligent life form. This is not, nor will it be, a hater fic.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong>: I am an American. While I am going to try to minimize the appearance of Americanisms, they will likely still get through from time to time. One exception to that I'll warn you about now is the fact that I just can't call any sport football other than the one played by my beloved Pittsburgh Steelers. Dean's West Ham United and my Newcastle United play soccer. Sorry if that bothers you.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong>: While I do try to use correct grammar when writing, the fact is that sometimes I'm going to write what sounds right instead of what’s technically correct. This would happen when what's technically correct sounds ridiculous to my ears. This will be most likely to happen with dialog. And I'm not going to be worried about some rules about semicolons or whatever that should only be known by somebody who has spent every second of the last twenty years of his or her life locked in the Oxford Literature Department. If anybody is overly bothered by any of that, then I invite you to the exit.</p>
<p><strong>11</strong>: While I know it is difficult, I do try not force my personal beliefs and values upon all of the characters I work with. I believe that allowing each character to have/keep/develop their own values is part of how I can keep each character a unique individual. One example I can give you appears early on. Consider how Moody uses mead and compare that to the fact that I am a teetotaller. The overall point is that if a character say or does something that reflects values you don't agree with, just remember that it is entirely possible that I don't agree with those values, either. I simply consider it the cost of allowing characters to be individuals.</p>
<p><strong>12</strong>: This story was started on March 25, 2005. It was left after the chapter "The start of a Beautiful Friendship" was uploaded on July 1, 2005 due to real life. While I am not silly enough to promise it won't happen again, I intend to try to get this going again. It is also worth noting that it is possible . . . okay probable my writing style has changed during the thirteen year gap. I will try to keep any changes from being too jarring.</p>
<p><br/>I think I've covered everything I intend to here. I appreciate everyone who took the time to read this the first time you clicked on this story. I also understand if you passed that first time, and decided to come back later. I hope I've answered most of the questions you are doubtlessly going to have, and I'll do what I can to answer the rest. Just make sure that either your profile or your review has an e-mail address I can reach you at.</p>
<p>Thank you, and enjoy the story.</p>

  <strong>Prolog</strong>
  <br/>
  <strong>Sins of the Family</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sky of the late-June evening darkened as twilight settled over the Wiltshire countryside, bringing the first stars out into a cloudless sky and softening the angles on the manicured landscape of the centuries old mansion that was Malfoy Manor. The beauty of the moment was lost to the young man who apparated in front of the iron gate.</p>
<p>“BASILISK!” Draco yelled at the gate as soon as he felt he had finished apparating. The gate slowly opened. Draco slipped through as soon as there was a large enough gap, then broke into a dead run the instant he was clear.</p>
<p>Draco’s mind was still reeling. Only a few minutes ago, he had been at a secret Death Eater meeting location. He had just finished proving he had all the skills necessary to be a Death Eater, and had been brought before The Dark Lord himself to receive The Mark.</p>
<p>Voldemort, however, had something else in mind. “Draco Malfoy. Before I make you one of my Death Eaters, I must be certain of your loyalty.” Even through the serpentine hiss accenting The Dark Lord’s voice, Draco recognized a tone similar to the one his father used when telling someone beneath him to do something they wouldn’t want to do. “Your aunt’s failure has cost me much needed information, as well as some of my most valuable followers. I have been subjecting her to the cruciatus, of course, but that is not enough. While I do not wish to kill her, I need to give her, and the rest of my Death Eaters, a permanent reminder of the price of failing me. Her failure will cost the lives of two members of her family.” He paused for a moment, as if to judge Draco’s reaction, then continued. “I have ordered Bella to personally lead the team of Death Eaters that will kill her sister Andromeda. She left a moment ago.”</p>
<p>Another pause, during which Draco thought. ‘No real loss. She married a muggle.’</p>
<p>Then Voldemort continued again. “You, Draco, will prove yourself to me by killing her other sister, Narcissa.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure how he managed it, but Draco was sure he’d convinced The Dark Lord that he would do it. How else could he have gotten out of there alive? But he also knew that this was a test, which meant that there would probably be somebody coming to check on him soon. That was why Draco kept running after passing through the main door of the Manor. As he sprinted toward the sitting room she favored, he tried to force himself to come up with a plan. “Never stick your neck out without a plan.” His father would always remind him.</p>
<p>His father! All Draco had to do was find a way to hide with his mother long enough for his father to get out of Azkaban. Together, they would figure out a way to save her.</p>
<p>He burst through the door of his mother’s favorite sitting room. She was there, clearly surprised by the sudden intrusion. “Draco, what is the matter?”</p>
<p>In his haste, Draco didn't use the formality their family normally used. “We have to go, mum. One bag of stuff for living in hiding for a couple weeks should do.” He took her hand just strongly enough to lift her out of her chair so she could follow him.</p>
<p>She stood, but didn’t move. “Hiding? Draco, what’s wrong? Did something happen at your meeting? Is this about your father?”</p>
<p>“NO!” Draco cut her off. She looked surprised by his outburst. “I’m sorry, but we must leave NOW. The Dark Lord . . .”</p>
<p>“Petrificus Totalus!” Came a surprising and familiar voice from the doorway. Draco’s body went stiff. Then, because he had leaned toward her as he was speaking, he toppled over into his mother’s arms.</p>
<p>Narcissa held her son while looking in shock. “Lucius! When did you get out? And why did you do that to Draco?”</p>
<p>Lucius moved slowly toward her, as if nothing at all was out of order. “I will explain everything in a moment.” As he reached them, he grabbed Draco by the arms and moved him until he had him lying on the small couch, in a position to see them. “There. Now, to answer your questions. I’ve been out of Azkaban for about twelve hours now. Having the dementors on your side can prove very useful. As for Draco, he has proven himself to be a disappointment and a traitor.”</p>
<p>“WHAT? How is that possible? He’d never betray us.”</p>
<p>“You are almost correct. He’d never betray you. And that is a problem because it has led him to betray The Dark Lord.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“Because,” Lucius answered as he raised his wand, “as his final test to become a Death Eater, Draco was ordered to kill you.” He now had his wand pointed directly at her. “Petrificus Totalus.” She stiffened and fell to the floor. “And,” Lucius continued, “if Draco did as I expected and tried to save you, I am under orders to kill both of you.”</p>
<p>Draco, still petrified, watched in horror as his father pointed his wand at his mother. He then heard his father cast the one spell he never believed his father would use on either of them. “Avada Kedavra!” The sick beam of green light flashed from Lucius’s wand, and stuck Narcissa in the middle of her chest.</p>
<p>‘NO!’ Draco screamed in his mind. Suddenly, without knowing how or why, Draco was on the floor next to her. Tears flowing freely, he moved to cradle her head in his arms.</p>
<p>“Why, Draco.” His father began. “I’d be impressed by that little feat of wandless magic, if not for this pathetic display of weakness.” He shook his head in disgust. “There really is no reason to go on like this, Draco. You will be joining her in a moment.” That’s when Draco looked up at him.</p>
<p>Draco couldn’t see that Lucius’s wand was pointed at him. All he saw were his mother’s dead eyes. He felt a near suffocating grief, but even that was overrun by rage. A rage that literally hurt as it grew inside him, seeming to set every nerve and muscle and even his blood on fire. A rage that deafened him with a throbbing pulse in his ears, and nearly blinded him with a reddish haze covering his vision. His body was shaking, as if it was having trouble deciding how to avenge her, when he finally looked into his father’s eyes. Suddenly, the red haze on his vision changed to a sickly green as Draco fell unconscious. He hadn’t heard himself say what he said just before the haze changed color. The final words Lucius Malfoy would ever hear.</p>
<p>“AVADA KEDAVRA!”</p>
