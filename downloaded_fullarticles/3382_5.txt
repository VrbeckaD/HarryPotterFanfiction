    <p align="center">Golden Boy’s Dance</p><p align="center">Ch.1</p><p align="center">Golden Boy’s Birthday</p><p>Harry was nineteen years old, and in desperate need of a job. Ever since he “graduated” Hogwarts, he has been living with the Weasleys. Ron has already applied for the Auror training program while Hermione got herself into a neat position at the Ministry of Magic working for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, working endlessly for the better treatment of house-elves. Hell, even Ginny has several tryouts and interviews with various Quidditch teams! Which left Harry with… nothing.</p><p>He tried to look for a job, he really did, but then night would come along with the night terrors. Nightmares and horrible dreams of his hunt for the Horcruxes, his endless battles with Voldemort, and the dead—so many dead, their faces always coming back to haunt him. The one time he tried to enter the Auror Training Program, he did fine until he was hit with a horrible flashback of Fred’s body and fell to the floor crying. The mediwizards at St. Mungo’s diagnosed him with a severe case of PTSD and prescribed several potions for him to use daily. Since then, he just wandered around the house, doing chores, making sure that the Burrow was clean. He became very efficient at cleaning spells.</p><p>But still, he felt trap, like he was just a waste of time and energy siphoning from the Weasleys, even though they reassured him several times that it was fine, that he could stay with them as long as he liked, that he will find a job eventually. But still he felt completely awful. When it was really bad he would just mope around in his room, staring at nothing in particular as the day slowly went by.</p><p>He hated himself, hated feeling useless. If he can’t be an Auror like his parents, like how everyone expected him to be, then what good was he? The Wizarding World already seemed to have forgotten about Harry’s deeds two years ago, the last reporter to stalk him was over six months ago, and that was only to get proof that Harry was suffering from PTSD and is now a washed-up hero.</p><p>The one thing that gave Harry some spark of life was his body. He worked hard to make sure that he never loses his shapely figure. Cursed short, Harry made sure to make up for height with attractiveness, exercising every day to give him a lean, toned body with a cute bubbly butt; he had some hair on his chest and stomach that led to a wild forest of pubic hair that Harry was too afraid to touch with anything sharp in case he hurt himself. He still ate everything Mrs. Weasley would feed him, but he would work all the calories off just to make sure that he’s small and sleek. On the days when he’s feeling half himself, Harry would stand naked in front of the mirror, trying to encourage himself as he said, “I will get a job today. I will get an interview today. No attacks today. You can do this Potter.”</p><p>It would make him feel better temporarily before reality crushes him, as he would inevitably ruin every interview.</p><p>One day in mid-August, needing a pick-me-up after another failed interview, Harry decided to visit George in his flat above his jokes shop. The flat was a homey place, having a large room that served as a general area plus kitchen and dining room and two doors leading to the bathroom and bedroom. George gave Harry a key after everything happened, telling the small Potter that he was welcome to stay over anytime. Nowadays this would usually end up with George giving Harry a shot or two of firewhiskey to calm his nerves.</p><p>Harry was surprised to see that the flat was empty. “George?” Harry said softly, looking around. There was no answer. Harry stood still in the flat. There was a faint noise coming from the back of the flat. Curious, Harry slowly made his way towards the noise, which became louder and louder as Harry sneaked towards the bedroom.</p><p>“George?” Harry said again opening the bedroom door, his eyes widening at the sight.</p><p>George was completely naked, his hard, thick cock on display as he stroked it slowly as he stared at what looked like a muggle computer, yet different. There was no cables or wires, and the keyboard was typing by itself as George continued to stroke his fat cock to the screen. Harry bit his lip as his own cock started to swell as his eyes moved from the delicious cock to the screen.</p><p>A boy around Harry’s age wearing a black latex tube sock around his chest with holes for his pierced nipples was moaning in complete ecstasy as a huge black dildo moved in and out of his exposed hole at an even pace. “George!”</p><p>George turned around, still stroking his cock, and gave a lazy smile at Harry. “Hiya Harry, you got to watch this,” he said. “Newest muggle technology, altered for wizard use. Best thing in the world. They sell like hot cakes. Come on, take off your clothes and enjoy the show with me,” he smirked as he took his wand and, with a wave, produced a chair next to him.</p><p>“I-I’m a bottom,” Harry said, still completely shocked at seeing George naked and casually jerking off in front of him.</p><p>“So is he, but he loves it,” George smirked, pointing to the monitor were the boy was jerking himself as he was fucked. He then turned to the monitor and said, “Daddy’s friend arrived and is nervous to jerk off for you. Moan for him Baby.”</p><p>“D-Daddy’s Friend,” the boy, apparently named Baby, moaned as he looked directly at George and Harry, “please jerk off! It would make Baby very happy.”</p><p>“Good Boy,” George said, the boy moaning in response. He turned to Harry and winked. “Come on, I can see you’re hard, so just join me. It’s a private show.”</p><p>“Please Daddy’s Friend,” Baby moaned.</p><p>“He can’t see us, it’s a cam-show,” George said. “Just relaxed and jerk off, you look like you need the stress relief.”</p><p>“Fine,” Harry sighed. He stepped out of his shoes and quickly stripped, revealing his hard five-inch cock. George snickered but Harry glared at him. “Told you, I’m a bottom,” he said. “My size doesn’t matter.”</p><p>Harry moved towards George and sat down, hissing slightly as the cold wood made contact with his ass. He leaned back and gotten comfortable, staring at Baby on the screen as he continued to fuck himself with the large dildo. Harry had to admit that he was cute. His face was hazy, Harry couldn’t exactly make up the details, but he had sandy-blonde hair and bright blue eyes.</p><p>“Daddy’s friend is a bottom, Baby,” George chuckled. “I think your cock is bigger than his.”</p><p>“Tee-hee, that’s funny,” Baby moaned. George flicked his wand and the moan quickly turned into a cry of shock and pain. “Daddy!”</p><p>“Don’t make fun of my friend’s cock,” George said. “Just for that, fuck yourself harder.”</p><p>“Yes, Daddy,” the cam boy moaned and with a flick, the dildo began moving faster, rougher. Harry matched the thrusts and, with helpful glances at George’s thick cock, got himself into a comfortable feeling of lust as he continued to jerk himself.</p><p>“Yes, Good boy, Daddy’s friend is loving your show,” George moaned. “We’re both so close Baby.”</p><p>“Please cum for me Daddy, Baby needs your cum,” the cam boy moaned. Harry, really into the lustful needs now, stroke his small cock viciously before giving out a high, loud moan as he came, his seed spraying all over his stomach and chest. George followed soon, cumming on his hands and lower stomach. There was a high-pitched scream and Harry watched with fascination as the cam boy came, screaming “Daddy!”</p><p>“Such a good show Baby, Daddy loved it… and so did his friend,” George chuckled.</p><p>“Thank you, Daddy! I’ll see you next time, okay?” The cam boy smiled before the screen went black.</p><p>George sighed and turned to give a lazy grin to Harry. “Not a bad show, eh? Baby’s real good at stress relief.”</p><p>“What was that?” Harry demanded. “How—”</p><p>“That, little Harry, was a cam show. Basically cute men and women get naked in the comfort in their own home and put on a little show for anyone who wants to watch,” George said. “If they like it, they’ll give the cam boy money. Baby here is a pro, he’s been doing this for a couple of years. Nice bit of money from what I heard of.”</p><p>“But…they actually—isn’t that dangerous?” Harry asked.</p><p>“This site isn’t,” George said. “Best security you can get online.” George paused then chuckled, “Listen to me using muggle words. Anyway, the place that I visit? Totally one hundred percent safe for both cam boys and viewers." Harry nodded slowly as reality seeped into his brain.</p><p>He and George were both naked and covered in cum. Suddenly completely embarrassed, Harry reached for his wand and cleaned himself. George, however continued to relax in his chair. “So, what can I do you for Harry?” He asked.</p><p>“Just failed another interview,” Harry frowned. “I don’t think I could go back to the Burrow. Your parents are understanding but… I don’t think I can stand their pity at the moment.”</p><p>“Harry, you know—”</p><p>“Yes but I need a job George,” Harry said. “I just—since third year I wanted to be an Auror like my parents. But because of my stupid PTSD I can’t even do a damn training exercise without… without…”</p><p>“I understand,” George frowned. He stood up and pulled Harry into a hug. Harry squeezed George closer, doing his best to fight back the tears. “Mate, if you don’t want to bum off my parents… then move in with me.”</p><p>“George I can’t, I need a job,” Harry said.</p><p>“We’ll get you a job, don’t worry… how about we put our clothes on and talk about it over some tea, eh? Jerking off always makes me thirsty,” George said.</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” Harry sighed. He picked up his pants and shirt and pulled them on as George moved to a nearby dresser and pulled open a drawer. “I’m going to be in the kitchen,” Harry said.</p><p>“Alright, you know where everything is,” George said.</p><p>Harry moved out of the bedroom and made his way to the corner kitchen. Having the placed memorized from his countless visits, Harry filled a teapot with water and placed it on the stove, turning it on. He then pulled out two cups along with two teabags and placed one bag in one cup. Seconds later, the kettle was whistling, and, with an easy flick of Harry’s wand, it floated into the air and poured hot water into the two waiting cups.</p><p>Harry busied himself with making his own cup as George walked in wearing only jeans and a T-shirt. “Thanks, mate,” George said as Harry took his to the small table that acted like the dining room. A moment later George sat down and said, “You’re moving in with me.”</p><p>“George—”</p><p>“No, I don’t want to hear about you moaning about bumming off people, I won’t hear it,” George said. “You hate it at the Burrow, don’t try to argue with me Harry. You’re doing yourself more harm than good there. So you’re going to live with me, and together we’ll think of a job you can do.”</p><p>“But you’re not hiring,” Harry said, “You told me so six months ago, you’re fully staffed—so where—”</p><p>“Harry, calm down about that,” George said. “I am not going to let our first investor down. We’ll think of something that’ll get you money.”</p><p>Harry gave a defeated sigh and took a sip from his tea. Living at the Burrow or with George wasn’t going to change the fact that he felt useless.</p><p>“Everything would be easier if I had easy money,” he muttered to himself. He thought, for a moment, to dip into the Potter and Black Vault, but quickly pushed that thought out of his mind. He wouldn’t dare insult his family heritage but just spending all their hard work.</p><p>He stared at George, and his still perverted mind went back to his thick cock, to how George was stroking it lazily as he watched Baby… then it hit him. “I…I can work,” Harry said softly.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“I can…I can work,” Harry said. “I can… be a cam boy… at least until I find a real job.”</p><p>He looked up hesitantly at George. He expected the man to be disgusted at the proposal, saying something that becoming a whore is too good for Harry Potter, the killer of Voldemort, but instead he just gave a large, supporting grin. “That. Could. Work! Think about it Harry, you’ll be bringing in money as well as raising your self-esteem.”</p><p>“I don’t have a problem with my—”</p><p>“Yes you do, it’s been on a nose-dive the last two years,” George said. “You can use Fred’s room for your bedroom and workplace. I’ll teach you everything you need to know how to work the magical computer, how to get the camera ready and how to set up the charms Baby uses to hide his face.”</p><p>“That doesn’t come with the site?”</p><p>“No, there are some cam boys who wants to show their faces to the world,” George said. “But Baby, obviously isn’t one of them.”</p><p>“I’m guessing Baby isn’t his real name,” Harry said.</p><p>“God no, and nobody knows what his real name is, nor do they care,” George said. “So you don’t need to worry about people finding out who you are.”</p><p>“Okay,” Harry nodded.</p><p>“So… are we really doing this?” George asked.</p><p>“Yeah… yeah we are,” Harry nodded.</p><p>“Wicked! Then we’ll tell mum and dad the good news tonight,” George smiled. “In the meantime, I think we should think of a new name for you…”</p><p>Harry thought for a moment before looking up at George, “I know,” he said. “This was an old insult Malfoy used to call me in our first and second year, but I think it will work wonderfully.”</p><p>“What is it?” George asked, leaning towards Harry in anticipation.</p><p>Harry looked up at George and smiled.</p><p>“Golden Boy.”</p>
