  <span class="s1">Albus Dumbledore was not a man easily shaken, but he was certainly perplexed.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="left">
  <span class="s1">Instead of finding Harry Potter safely in the care of his aunt and uncle, the Professor had followed the owls (they always knew where to go, and he never quite understood how) to the boy, (a house in London, of all places</span>
  <span class="s1">) and found that his guardian was another person entirely.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="left">The man, -who had introduced himself as Loki- for his part, was taking the news that his adopted son was a wizard remarkably well. Tall and pale, with fairly long black hair, he reminded Albus vaguely of a younger, handsomer, less greasy Severus Snape. He had piercingly green eyes, and was nattily dressed in black and green. Harry -much older that when Albus had last seen him of course- seemed to try and emulate him, wearing his back curls long and tied up and sporting a smart button-down shirt.</p><p class="p1" align="left">Loki raised an eyebrow. "A wizard school, you say?" </p><p class="p1" align="left">While his tone was not apprehensive, he seemed to somehow convey all too clearly exactly what he thought of the idea.</p><p class="p1" align="left">"Correct." Albus said. "One of the finest in Europe, may I add."</p><p class="p1" align="left">Loki's brows furrowed almost imperceptibly. "And just how safe is this," He waved a hand vaguely. "Wizard school?"</p><p class="p1" align="left">"There's no place safer." The Professor said proudly. </p><p class="p1" align="left">Harry and his guardian shared a split-second Look.</p><p class="p1" align="left">"Father," Harry spoke for the first time. "Face it. You may be a very skilled sorcerer, but you can't teach this kind of magic." He gestured to the ornate silver tea set Dumbledore had conjured from thin air minutes ago. "Wouldn't it be best to let me learn it there? After all, it sounds perfectly safe."</p><p class="p1" align="left">Harry spoke in a strange, somewhat formal manner, with the barest hint of an undefinable accent at the edges of his voice. A capable sorcerer? Albus' blue eyes gleamed curiously. That would explain things. Harry's hands sported a number of rings, and even sitting some few feet away, the Professor could see the charms and enchantments glisten on them. Not to mention the ornate, golden helmet atop the mantlepiece, the strange energy coating Loki like armour, and the small dragons-tooth necklace that hung from Harry's neck.</p><p class="p1" align="left">Loki's eyes turned to his son, softening. "<em>Ormtjusare, </em>are you sure?"</p><p class="p1" align="left">The man spoke Swedish, Albus noted. Not a language he was fluent in, but he knew enough to pass. <em>Orm </em>meant snake, though he was lost to <em>tjusare</em>. An affectioante nickname, he decided.</p><p class="p1" align="left">"Of course I am, <em>listig skojare</em>." </p><p class="p1" align="left">So Harry spoke it too. The man didn't have an accent, bar the slight undefinable one his son shared, but perhaps he was Swedish himself? That would explain the name.</p><p class="p1" align="left">Loki smirked. "So determined." He said. "Where do you think I got it from?" Harry grinned back. "Haven't the foggiest." Loki replied.</p><p class="p1" align="left">The two turned their emerald gazes back to Dumbledore, who was starting to feel a little overlooked.</p><p class="p1" align="left">"Then it's decided." Loki said, his arm on Harry's shoulder protectively. "Starting September, my son will be attending your school, Professor Dumbledore."</p><p class="p1" align="left">"Please," The Professor smiled, his eyes crinkling. "Call me Albus, Mr Laufeyson." </p>
