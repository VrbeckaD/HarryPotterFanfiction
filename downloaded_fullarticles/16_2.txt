  <em>July 31, 1958 (Thursday)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>         Cold air hit his body uncomfortably as Harry cringed and let out an involuntary cry. His eyes were shut tightly as his small ears picked up the first sounds of this world - voices chatting, fabrics shifting, feet shuffling.</p><p>         “-a healthy screamer, this one – ”</p><p>         “-beautiful, pureblood heir,” someone cooed as a finger caressed his sensitive cheek. Suddenly, he felt something soft being wrapped around his body, something snuggly (flannel? cotton?) as he was lifted upwards. He settled into a depression filled with warmth. An embrace, Harry guessed.</p><p>         Slowly, Harry cracked open his bleary eyes a mere inch. There was a handsome face filling up his entire view as his body was swayed gently. The man was looking down at him. His eyes crinkled with joy. </p><p>         Harry was mesmerized with his eyes that shone so brightly as though there were glimmering films. And beneath the sheen, there were two rings of light grey with a subtle purple undertones that communicated peacefulness. They were also accented with specks of charcoal that hinted at a modest air of aristocracy and class. But most importantly, he felt warm and... at home.</p><p>         Harry was finally able to peel his gaze away from the soulful eyes and turned his attention to the combed-up raven hair and the well-trimmed handlebar moustache. His appearance was reminiscent of his godfather, only… posher.</p><p>         “Thank the magic, it is a boy,” a female voice said outside his view.</p><p>         Harry recognized her voice, yet he could not place where he had heard the voice from. As the man moved Harry away from him, he squirmed at the loss of the man’s touch - the sense of warmth and safety. He felt himself being placed on a soft surface. A bed.</p><p>         Then, a woman came into view and blocked out the man as she loomed over him. Her face looked familiar as well – the pointed nose, high cheekbones, and piercing black eyes that would have frightened him if he did not detect the hint of softness behind them. There was little warmth to her obsidian eyes and Harry shivered. But suddenly, recognition slapped him across the face, tearing forth a scream of surprise.</p><p>         <em>‘</em><em>Walburga Black.’</em></p><p>         He felt his magic rushing through his body instinctively as it reacted defensively against the perceived threat. However, his tiny body was unable to handle the flood of magic and caused him to discharge the energy uncontrollably into the room. The window and vases on the cupboard shattered as the door slammed shut; two landscape portraits hanging on the wall crashed down to the ground in two loud thumps. A woman, the wet nurse, shrieked.</p><p>         “Merlin! Was that accidental magic?” The man, who Harry assumed is his father and no doubt named Orion Arcturus Black, stared at him in awe. “B…but, isn’t he far too young for – ”</p><p>         “Orion, only the best for the new heir of the House of Black!” the woman in view snapped at her husband and looked back at him with a bigger, more genuine smile. “My little prince. You will be called Turais Rigel Orion Black, the newest heir to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. And you will become the strongest Black of all.”</p><p>        <em> ‘</em><b><em>Welcome to the House of Black, young Master.’</em></b></p><p>         Harry screamed.</p>
