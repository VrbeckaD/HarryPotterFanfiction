          <div class="userstuff"><p>The celebrations had been going on for the past month. The Dark Lord had been defeated and the wizarding world was determined to show how happy they were about it. Grinning as he downed yet another free shot sent to him from someone at the bar, Ron tried to blink the haze from his eyes.</p>
<p>He hadn't had to pay for a drink once in the past month. His mother wasn't exactly happy about that, but Ron wasn't going to turn them down. He swayed a little as he was dragged onto the dancefloor of the Bubbling Cauldron, one of the latest hotspots to open in Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Ron's body thrummed with the beat of the music. There were no lyrics, just a constant <i>thump-thump-thump</i> as the bass thudded out of the speakers not five foot from him. Reaching out for the nearest body, he pulled whoever it was to him, pressing close.</p>
<p>Heat emanated from the body in front of him. It was definitely a guy, from the lack of boobs. Either that or Ron had found himself one of the most flat-chested women in London. He chuckled at the thought as he pulled the body closer to him. The man's back was pressed to Ron's front, his shapely arse rubbing right into Ron's groin. Wrapping his arms around the man's chest, Ron leant in so he could speak directly into his ear.</p>
<p>"Is this a hint?"</p>
<p>The man's head fell back onto Ron's shoulder, exposing the length of his pale throat. Unable to resist, Ron latched onto the pulse throbbing in the side of the man's neck. A long-fingered hand reached up to tangle through Ron's hair. It pulled gently with each movement of the man in front of him.</p>
<p>"You've never been good with hints, Weasley."</p>
<p>The voice was familiar, the aristocratic tone grating. Ron let out a questioning sound, but did not release the man's throat. Sucking and nipping, he knew he would be leaving a deep mark on the pale skin. He ran one hand down the length of the man's body, ghosting his fingers over his stomach. He didn't linger there long, however, no matter how tempting it might be. Sliding his fingers further down the man's body, he rubbed the very top of a toned thigh. The bulge in the man's tight trousers was clear from the stretch of the material. Ron grinned.</p>
<p>"I'll take this one."</p>
<p>The hand in his hair tightened painfully. Instead of pulling back, as the man clearly wanted, Ron pressed closer, rubbing his own erection into the man's arse.</p>
<p>"I'll take <i>you</i> if you want me."</p>
<p>The man turned. Ron blinked as he caught a quick glimpse of blue-grey eyes and the lights turning the man's pale hair a rainbow of colours. The free alcohol had given everything a slightly fuzzy quality. The question of just who this was occurred to him, but he couldn't act on the notion before the man closed the gap between them, pressing their bodies together. The motion of swaying to the music gave Ron a friction that caused his head to spin with lust.</p>
<p>"I've wanted you for longer than you could know, Weasley."</p>
<p>"Sir?" A soft tap on his shoulder drew Ron back away from the man. "From the group of girls at the bar."</p>
<p>Ron accepted the shot with a grin. Raising the glass high in the air, he nodded hazily towards the bar in thanks. Returning his gaze to the man in front of him, Ron's smile didn't falter. Draco Malfoy stared up at him, his eyes dilated black. Clenching a hand on Malfoy's hip, Ron tilted his head back and downed the shot in one breath. A loud cheer went up around the club when he handed the glass off to some random person standing beside him. Swaying slightly – whether it was due to the alcohol in his system, the beat of the music, or the lust in his veins, he did not know – Ron leant forward.</p>
<p>"You want me, Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Malfoy didn't seem to mind that the words were slurred. His hand landed once again in Ron's hair, tugging it painfully.</p>
<p>"I want to fuck you, Weasley."</p>
<p>Ron hummed as their lips met in a sloppy kiss. The crowd around them broke out in a loud noise, but Ron couldn't quite make out whether it was a cheer, or objections. He couldn't care, though. The sensations running through him would not be denied.</p>
<p>Malfoy tasted of Firewhisky. The deep, smoky taste flooded Ron's senses, sending his mind spinning crazily. Humming again as Malfoy pressed closer, he opened his mouth, sucking on Malfoy's tongue when it slipped past his lips. Malfoy rubbed against him, his hands roaming Ron's body freely.</p>
<p>"Fuck me, then."</p>
<p>Malfoy's response wasn't verbal. With a sickening lurch, Ron found himself Apparated. He clung to Malfoy as the world spun around him, the swift movement reacting poorly with the alcohol coursing through him.</p>
<p>"I–" Ron didn't get the chance to speak further before Malfoy placed a hand in the middle of his chest and shoved. "Oi!"</p>
<p>Stumbling backwards, Ron landed on what he had to assume was a bed. He couldn't be certain, as the second he landed, Malfoy pounced. With a grunt, Malfoy slammed their lips together, pressing Ron down into the mattress.</p>
<p>The pace Malfoy set was frantic. He almost forced his tongue past Ron's lips again, sliding it over his teeth. His hands seemed to be everywhere: sliding up beneath Ron's shirt, gripping his hips, and tangling through his hair. Ron tried to match his pace, but knew he was beginning to fumble. Not that he could find the will to care all that much at that moment, as Malfoy's touch was exciting him rapidly, sending jolts of lust straight to his cock. Tilting his head back when Malfoy broke the kiss, he offered his throat.</p>
<p>"You <i>do</i> want to be fucked, don't you Weasley?"</p>
<p>The words were spoken in a broken whisper straight into Ron's ear. Malfoy slipped a leg between Ron's thighs and began to rock against him.</p>
<p>"You're practically gagging for it."</p>
<p>Ron groaned. The sensation of having Malfoy's hard cock rubbing against his thigh was enough to distract him from responding immediately. Reaching down, he gripped Malfoy's arse, pulling him even closer.</p>
<p>"Get on with it, then."</p>
<p>A wash of magic preceded a rush of cooler air. Ron grinned when he realised Malfoy had Vanished their clothing. Spreading his legs, he pulled Malfoy's head down, offering his throat again. Malfoy didn't seem to need any further prompting.</p>
<p>Moving quickly, Malfoy muttered another spell just before latching onto the pulse in the side of Ron's throat. The slide of slick lubrication between them had Ron groaning again. Malfoy was just as hard and ready to go as he was. He jerked his hips, sliding their cocks together as he sucked on Ron's throat.</p>
<p>Ron couldn't work out what to do with his hands. They slid aimlessly for a few seconds before landing on Malfoy's arse. The firm muscles tightened every few seconds as Malfoy thrust against him, and Ron matched their rhythm. Kneading his fingers into Malfoy's arse, he pressed their bodies together as close as he could.</p>
<p>Pleasure jolted through his stomach, overpowering the numbing effect of the alcohol he'd drunk at the club. His knees fell apart even further as he tried to pull Malfoy closer still. He wasn't going to last long, he knew.</p>
<p>"Fuck, Weasley," Malfoy groaned into Ron's ear, his voice deep and rough. "Gonna…"</p>
<p>Malfoy's hips stuttered. Ron wouldn't allow him to stop, however. Squeezing his fingers and thrusting upwards, he elicited a ragged moan from Malfoy.</p>
<p>"Gonna… <i>Fuck</i>…"</p>
<p>Malfoy froze as much as was possible with Ron's hands gripping his arse. His back arched and his head fell back. With his eyes closed and his mouth open, Malfoy looked beautiful. Heat spread through Ron's stomach as he watched Malfoy's orgasm. When Malfoy collapsed on top of him, Ron pushed against the bed, flipping them over.</p>
<p>Thrusting wildly against Malfoy's thigh, Ron focussed solely on bringing himself to orgasm. It didn't take long. His hips jerked and his breath caught in his throat as he tipped over the edge, a sharp jab of pleasure coursing through him. His release coated both of their stomachs, spreading as his hips jerked. The room spun before his eyes as he landed on the bed, rolling to his side to stare up at the canopy of the bed.</p>
<p>"Malfoy?"</p>
<p>A light snore was Malfoy's only response. Staring up at the spinning canopy, Ron grinned. This hadn't been the night he had thought he would have when he had left his flat that evening, but it had turned out better than he had expected.</p></div>
