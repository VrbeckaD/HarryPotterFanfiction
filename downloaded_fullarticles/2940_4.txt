    <p>Disclaimer: I don't own the Harry Potter franchise </p><p>      When people are asked to describe Hogwarts, they will usually start out with physical characteristics;the enchanted ceiling, the forbidden forest, the library, or their respective common rooms. I however start with the people. Hogwarts itself is a marvelous building that you can not help but gawk at every moment a new surprise scuttles your way in the form of a hidden corridor, or a lonely door just begging you to wander inside and breath in all the secrets it beholds. Personally none of those things intrigue . In twenty years if I am asked the colour of the tapestries in the hallways I will not be capable of answering, but if you ask me what profanity my cousin James hollered before every Quidditch match I'd be able to tell you word by word without skipping a beat. It's not because we are family or that I'm a big Quidditch fan, no I barely ever speak to him unless it is absolutely necessary or my mother forces me to. It is because he always has this look in his eyes, his cockiness fading and fear slowly creeping in and taking over bit by bit. That is why the people of Hogwarts will always be something I remember and better then the twinkling stars on the ceiling that enchanted all the students, even me .</p><p>      I don't have many friends outside my family, yet that may be due to my over excessive pickiness of traits I deem to be normal. I will, sometimes, engage in conversation with my cousins Molly or Lucy however they seem to believe that everything and everyone should bow down to their superior intellect and looks, so our conversations are not very long and usually revolve around academics or the next family gathering. The cousin I would consider closest would be little Lily, yet since non of our classes coincide and we are in different houses opportunity for conversation is slim. James, as I have mentioned before, is very cocky and has an ego larger than an elephant so needless to say we are not the best of friends. His better half, Fred Weasley, very much resembles his namesake not only in physical appearance but behavior as well, we do not converse much either. The last of the Potter pack, Albus, is usually pleasant company yet is often depressed for reasons he does not wish to disclose upon. One of the more joyful cousins would definitely be Roxie since she always has the most unbelievable stories up her sleeve. The last of my cousins include; Dom, Louis, and Vic all undeniably smart, outgoing, attractive and competitive, overall we get along unless we are playing a game of wizarding chess, then things may get ugly. The only other relative I have is my brother Hugo, yet I feel he does not like me very much. There are many possibilities as to why he rarely even looks my way yet I have never been capable of pinpointing the exact cause.</p><p>      Another reason for my lack of friends would be that most of the student population at Hogwarts is overly self-involved. Their conversations mostly revolve around three topics; Quidditch, members of the opposite gender, and whether or not there will be a party hosted that week. As a Weasley I am invited to all these parties since they are usually hosted by one of my numerous relatives or one of my family friends.  All the parties follow the same pattern; everyone gets drunk, someone snogs someone they should not, punches are thrown, and last but not least everyone wakes up with a dreadful hangover. Since none of those things interest me I rarely ever attend. The only way I ever end up attending is if Roxie or Dom drag me to one in a body bind, literally. To my dismay it looks like I will be ending up in a body bind sooner than I expected.</p><p>       "Rosie, Rosie, Rosie dearest you will not believe what I just found out!" Dom shouted as she bursted into the Great Hall.</p><p>       "That James is throwing a party in the Room of Requirement tonight at midnight and that he  smuggled in some of Ogdens finest Firewhisky ." I nonchalantly answered her while continuing to eat my breakfast.</p><p>       "How did you find out, I just heard about it less than five minutes ago from James himself?" Dom questioned me as she started pilling an omelet on to her plate.</p><p>         "Penelope Stuart could not stop "whispering" about it to the rest of the bimbos in her "pack" this morning." I swiftly answered as I poured myself another glass of orange juice.</p><p>         "How did she find out before me?" Dom whispered flabbergasted dropping her fork, actually more like flinging her fork.</p><p>         "Dom, she is the prettiest girl in our year and you are wondering how she knew that James, the play boy of Hogwarts, was throwing a party, you surprise me sometimes." I sighed as I finished off the last piece of my breakfast.</p><p>        "I have no idea what everyone sees in her. I mean she is so fake just look at her breasts those definitely had some work done on them, and..." Dom tried to complain when she was cut off.</p><p>        " And those legs are just magnificent wouldn't you agree Rosie?" Cut in Freddie dearest as he plopped down in the seat next to me.</p><p>        "I'm sorry Freddie but I do not pay much attention to the legs of my housemates, anyway what are you doing here I was not aware you wanted to switch houses." I replied as I got up to leave.</p><p>      "Well I always did wonder what it would be like to be a Ravenclaw, especially when I can get a full few of Penelope Stuarts mhmhmmhm." Freddie daydreamed as Dom stuffed a cream puff in his mouth.</p><p>      "Must you always be such a perve, actually don't answer that." Dom criticized with disgust as she also got up to leave.</p><p>     "Where are you two going I haven't even told you the key term for the party!" Freddie yelled after us but we just kept walking to our first class of the day.</p><p>                         ***** </p><p>     Finally after an exhausting day of classes and Roxie charming Mrs.Noris's fur pink I thought I would have the evening to myself but Dom had other plans.</p><p>      "But Rosie it's the first party of our sixth year, you have to go even Alby is going and you know how much he dislikes these events." Dom begged me while I picked out a book on Potions in the 18th century.</p><p>       "The only reason Albus is going is because he lost his bet with Roxie and he never backs down on his word." I told her flipping through the book trying to find the chapter on dragon scale based potions.</p><p>        "Please, I'll be so lonely without you." Dom continued to beg as she flopped on to the sofa next to me.</p><p>         "Right until the moment you start snogging Alexander Thomas, if you'll still be missing me by then you need to find a new boy toy." I countered finally finding the potion I needed.</p><p>         "Rosie he's old news, been there done that, just please go or else I'm going to have to body bind you again." Dom continued to try and persuade as she stood up from the sofa.</p><p>         "No means no Dom go bother ..." I started to say as she cast a body binding spell on me. That party better be something or else she's gonna look forward to writing my essays until November.</p><p>                     *****</p><p>         Before Dom levitated me to the party she went into the girls dorm and brought down two dresses both extremely short and for the loss of a better word skanky. She better know I will never put that thing on no matter what. Oh looks like we are taking a detour to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom perfect. Oh no Dom don't drop me.</p><p>      "And you dropped me, thanks all I needed for my day to be complete was to be body bound and dropped in a bathroom." I gritted out while trying to regain my balance.</p><p>      "All right just put the dress on before I put it on you." Dom commanded me while making sure her makeup looked alright. </p><p>     "I am not wearing this dress it looks like a strippers dress." I hissed pushing away the offending garment. </p><p>     "Rose it is not as if I am doing this for my own good I just want you to live a little, get drunk, snog someone and not care about it in the morning." Dom said with concern.</p><p>      I do understand she just wants me to be happy but I really do not see the appeal in pretending to be something I am not. She may like these parties that make her feel "alive" yet to me they are just ways people momentarily forget their mortality. Maybe it is best if I do dress up this once to try and prove to her it is not my lifestyle. If that does not work maybe I'll just be able to get her off my back for a while. </p><p>      "Fine I'll put on the dress, if you can call it that, but you are so writing all my History of Magic essays until November." I told her not really expecting a positive answer after all writing my essays for an entire month isn't exactly how Dom spends her time.</p><p>     "Ok just put it on already." Dom agreed as she shoved me into a cubicle. As soon as we get there I am finding Al and sitting in a corner with him until Dom leaves with her new boy toy or passes out.</p><p>                       *****</p><p>     "James dearest what a party, and on such short notice I am very proud, so very proud." Exclaimed Freddie as he walked through the doors.</p><p>     "Thank you Freddie, but next ones on you alright?" Yelled James over the deafening music running up to his best mate.</p><p>      So far the party was going very well by most people's standards. The alcohol was being passed around, the dance floor was packed and the girls were in some very retaking outfits. Well that is hypocritical of me since I could very much hold the stripper name vixen right now. </p><p>     "Rose is that you, if you do not mind me saying you look gorgeous, I didn't know you owned anything of the sort." Confessed Freddie still staring at me as if I had a second head.</p><p>      "Freddie don't be a prat, the only reason I'm wearing this is because Dom is doing my homework until November." I exclaimed hoping no one else noticed my wardrobe malfunction.</p><p>      Just as Freddie was no doubt going to complain about me getting free homework for attending a party, we all turned our attention to the new guest.</p>
