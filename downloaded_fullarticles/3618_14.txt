  <b>7 Years After the Battle of Hogwarts</b>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"What House do you think you will be Sorted into?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Dunno. Hufflepuff seems most likely, although Gryffindor could be fun. I'm not sure that I'm enough of a bookworm for Ravenclaw, but it's a possibility."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"What about Slytherin? Ambition and resourcefulness sounds like a good combination to emphasise."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Absolutely not. You're a Muggleborn so I'll overlook it this time, but never talk about Slytherin like that. Slytherins are evil, and bent on taking over our world. No-one trusts anyone from that House anymore. You'd better get that into your head, and make sure you're Sorted somewhere else. I like you, but I'd never be friends with a slimy Snake."</em>
</p>
<p align="center">Welcome back, another year,<br/> To Hogwarts you return.<br/> And welcome, too, new students all,<br/> Who've chosen here to learn.</p>
<p align="center">I greet you as the Sorting Hat,<br/> Your best House I'll analyse.<br/> But before we start, listen close,<br/> I give a word to the wise.</p>
<p align="center">War, though past, left many scars,<br/> Tearing our world apart.<br/> But each house has its gift to heal;<br/> Search for them in your heart.</p>
<p align="center">Hufflepuffs have compassion to<br/> Acknowledge others' pain,<br/> Gryffindors show the courage needed,<br/> Once betrayed, to try again.</p>
<p align="center">Slytherins see that holding grudges<br/> Only keeps them from their goal,<br/> Ravenclaws know that not all children<br/> Inherit their parents' role.</p>
<p align="center">Each House a different reason gives<br/> But the message, they agree,<br/> Is that if you want life to move on,<br/> Forgiveness is the key.</p>
<p align="center">A new year starts, your next life stage,<br/> Embrace the gift you've gained.<br/> Judge others on their own merits<br/> And not by House or name.</p>
<p>The Sorting Hat looked around the Great Hall. It did not have eyes, but in such a magic-rich environment its other senses were more than enough. The past few years had been unsettled, with the aftermath of the War. Repairing the damage of the final battle had taken time, even with magic, and some of the scars on the stone walls would never be removed. Of course, those scars were nothing to the ones left on staff and students.</p>
<p>But time heals all things, or at least allows life to move on. None of the current students had suffered though the year of Death Eater occupation, and the new teachers had settled into their roles. All in all, life had returned to a familiar pattern.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not a pattern the Hat was happy with.</p>
<p>Tensions had been high following the War. It was to be expected really; no-one likes being exposed as on the losing side, and no-one likes trusting those who have once betrayed them. It was understandable; but worrying. While the War had changed the balance of power, it had done nothing to change the underlying prejudices.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the War had been fought between anti-Muggleborn and pro-Muggleborn factions, but the truth was more complex, catering to deeper issues. While the aftermath had seen some strides towards better integration, there were still plenty who objected to their intrusion. At the same time, prejudice against Slytherins spiked, blame for the pain and loss of the War being placed on the House of the highest profile members.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was becoming that the ultimate stigma was having been Sorted into Slytherin. Those alumni who had once worn green hid the fact, or found themselves shunned and distrusted. They warned their children against allowing themselves to be Sorted into their parents' House or else sent them to school overseas, often following them out of the country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Hat had no choice. The magic of Hogwarts demanded that the students be Sorted into four Houses. While it had some leeway with exact ratios, the growing prejudice against Slytherin forced its hand, requiring it to place there any students who did not outright refuse, almost regardless of their other aptitudes. What this meant, was that in contrast to the past, the House was rapidly becoming the domain of the Muggleborn, those who did not yet understand the consequences of such a choice. And as the percentage of Muggleborn in Slytherin increased, the two prejudices merged, ignoring their opposing origins.</p>
<p>The Hat desperately hoped that the Wizarding World would come to its senses. It had seen this pattern before, and did not want to see another war so soon.</p>
