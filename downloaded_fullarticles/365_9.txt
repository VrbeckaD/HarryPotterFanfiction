    <p>"For the last time, Ronald Weasley, I do NOT love you and I definitely do not want to marry you...under ANY circumstances!  No means NO!  Get that through your thick, red-headed skull!"  Hermione screeched at the unfortunate Ronald Bilius Weasley.</p><p> </p><p>"You have to marry me.  Mum says you have been leading me on and so you have to marry me!" Ron whinged.</p><p> </p><p>"Let me repeat myself, Ronald Bilius Weasley.  I do not love you...I do not want to marry you...and I am not completely stupid!  I know for a fact that you have been shagging Lavender Brown for the last two years!!!  ALL of Gryffindor knows that and probably half of Hufflepuff and a quarter of Ravenclaw!  Maybe even someone in Slytherin!  Lavender has a very big mouth and she has described your "wand" and what you do to her with it!  So since you were getting your "needs met" elsewhere, it is quite obvious that I have not led you on one little bit.  I owe you nothing!  Now go marry that prize slag, Lavender, as I will NEVER EVER want you!  End of story!!!"  Hermione snarled!</p><p> </p><p>"Mother said..."</p><p> </p><p>Hermione abruptly interrupted Ron.  "You want to marry me ONLY because your mother wants it.  It's only because your mother doesn't approve of Lavender that she wants you to marry me instead.  Well that isn't happening!  Molly can either suck it up when you marry Lavender Brown OR she can find you another witch to marry.  And if you ask me to marry you one more time, I am going to permanently remove every single hair on your body...with a pair of pliers!  Understand?  Nod if you understand!"</p><p> </p><p>Ron slowly nodded his head, turned away, and downcast he walked to the apparition point.  He wasn't looking forward to telling his mother that Hermione will NEVER marry him...and she was adamant over the matter.  He wasn't looking forward to that discussion one little bit!</p><p> </p>
