    <p>Hermione Granger walked over to the bar as quickly as she could, hoping she did not appear as bothered or flustered as she felt.</p><p></p><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="">
    <p>Normally she would not drink at an event like this. It was a loss of control in public and a semi-professional setting that she did not like to have, especially here – among the ultra rich – where she felt so out of her element. But she needed <em>something</em> to calm her fraying nerves and to quell the irrational flash of fury she had gotten when she had seen the most recent couple walk in a few moments ago.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Weaving her way through mingling people in their finest evening wear, she approached the bar and slipped into a stool at the far end.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>"Give me the strongest whiskey you've got," she said to the bartender, who nodded, plucked a glass and a bottle off shelves, and began to pour.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>"Well, well," came a lilting drawl from behind her.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Hermione stiffened.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>There was only one person that voice could belong to.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Sure enough, when she peeked over her shoulder she was greeted by the sight of none other than Draco Malfoy. He was wearing immaculate dress robes that were the exact color of his gray eyes, and he appeared incredibly amused.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He slid into the stool next to her and she rolled her eyes. Mostly out of habit than actual irritation or dislike. She had seen plenty of Malfoy since the war's end, and she was more than used to him.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>After taking the option to repeat her seventh year and then leaving Hogwarts two years ago, Hermione had gotten involved in charitable work. She had joined the board of a charity for house elves and other non-human magical beings, as well as a second charity dedicated to assisting and supporting the victims of the wars and their trauma.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Malfoy, she had initially been displeased to discover, had also been on the board of the both. Twice a month for two years she had seen him at board meetings and several other events put on by the charities throughout the year. Over that time, however, she had been pleasantly surprised by him. He did not <em>only</em> donate obscene amounts of money, as she had expected. She had thought his involvement with the charity had just been a calculating and very cunningly Slytherin way of making the Malfoys look good in public again (and she still suspected that played at least some role in his behavior). But he was actually a good board member, making helpful suggestions and sometimes volunteering to help with events.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>No, she no longer could say she <em>disliked</em> Malfoy. Their verbal sparring was no longer cruel, and sometimes it was even entertaining, but his teasing or taunts —usually based on his unnervingly accurate perception — were the last thing that she needed right now.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>"Didn't know you were coming tonight, Malfoy," she said primly, throwing him a sidelong glance and trying to ignore how nicely his robes fit him.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She wasn’t blind, after all. She was aware that it was <em>Malfoy</em>, but still. The pointed features of his childhood had become a pleasant sort of angular as he had grown into a man, and while he wasn’t conventionally attractive he was still nice to look at. He was tall and lean, though a different sort than Ron. Malfoy was lithe, and he moved with an almost enviable aristocratic grace.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>"Neither did I until a few hours ago," he said, shrugging and signaling the bartender for another whiskey. "My mother insisted."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Ah, yes. Narcissa Malfoy.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Hermione had to hand it to that woman: she was very clever, and knew how to try and return to the public's good graces. The Malfoys always had known how to align themselves with power, after all. The amount of charitable work Narcissa had done since the war was staggering, and it had half worked.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>The Malfoys no longer got curled lips or insults hurled at them in public. But the underlying contempt was clearly still there; they were disliked by both sides.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>"You seem tense, Granger. Have you got an even longer stick up your arse than usual this evening?" She flicked him an irritated look, but his gray eyes just glinted at her, clearly enjoying himself.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>"Your presence isn’t helping."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He placed a mock hand over his heart before nodding at the bartender, who had just set down his whiskey. "That offends. It's also a lie."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>"Malfoy, while I acknowledge that you may not be the garbage human you were at school I promise that you are still massively insufferable." She scowled and took a long drink, shuddering a little at the powerful taste.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He smirked. "You wanted that strong drink before you knew I was here."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He paused, and she tensed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She knew that pause.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He was relishing the fact that he was about to go in for the kill.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>"Could it be," he mused sarcastically, and she heard the wicked grin in his voice, “That you are so very upset because a certain ginger just walked in with another witch on his arm?”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“No,” she snapped, realizing too late that she should have said it slower.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She glared at Malfoy, but he just gave her a smug smile.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He knew he was right. She hated that he was right.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Hermione wasn’t angry that Ron was dating someone else. Of course not. They had broken up six whole months ago, after all.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>No. Absolutely not.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>It just would have been nice to get a forewarning before he showed up to an event for charities with <em>Gabrielle fucking Delacour</em> holding onto his elbow and smiling radiantly for the press. Of all the ways to find out your ex is in a new relationship, taking a part Veela public was a heavy blow.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>All the men in the room were practically drooling.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Hermione scowled into her glass as she took another very long drink.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Gabrielle Delacour,” Malfoy mused slowly, in his signature drawl. “Didn’t the eldest Weasley brother marry her sister?” He raised his eyebrows. “And people say the Malfoys are incestuous.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“The Malfoys actually <em>were</em> incestuous,” Hermione told him, rolling her eyes. “Granted, not as bad as the Blacks, but in the Middle Ages your family was marrying <em>actual</em> blood relatives. You have no room to judge.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He just chuckled. “Please, Granger. You honestly can tell me it’s not a little strange to you?”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She pursed her lips. “I’m not willing to gossip about it. If Ron is happy, then I am happy for him.” She took another furious drink of her whiskey.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>There was a long silence.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“You’re still not over Weasley.” Malfoy arched an eyebrow at her.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Of course I am,” she sputtered irritably. “Besides, it’s not as if I’m discussing my love life with <em>you</em>, of all people.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“You offend yet again, Granger.” A slow smile curved the corner of his lips upward. “Besides, you don’t need to discuss it. It’s all over your face.” He chuckled and took a triumphant sip of his drink, eyes sparkling with mirth.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Hermione drained her glass and stood, face blazing with determination. “I am not bothered by this, and I will prove it.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She ignored Malfoy’s low chuckle and hurried away from the bar, fuming; though the anger was quickly melting to nerves the closer she got to Ron and Gabrielle.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Particularly when Ron’s blue eyes swept over the crowd and spotted her.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Merlin, she was glad she had time on her side and this wasn’t her first interaction with Ron since they had broken up. They hadn’t seen each other that much in the past half year, and each time they did it had been distinctly awkward. Hermione had begun using work as an excuse to avoid Weasley dinners. Still, it was better than nothing. At least she was mildly equipped to deal with this now.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Heart pounding uncomfortably, she approached them. “Hello,” she said politely, feeling how warm she was and wishing she hadn’t drank that whiskey so quickly.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Hermione,” said Ron, giving her a lopsided grin. “Hi.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Oh! ‘ermione!” Gabrielle was beaming, and before Hermione knew it the other woman had put her hands on Hermione’s elbows, leaned forward, and kissed her on both cheeks. “Eet eez so wonderful to zee you!”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Thank you,” said Hermione, a little taken aback by the incredibly warm greeting, though she supposed Gabrielle had always been very kind whenever Hermione had interacted with her. “So lovely to see you both as well. I wasn’t aware you were a couple. Or that you would be coming.” She threw Ron a pointed glance, and he suddenly looked a little sheepish, as if just now realizing his mistake, which was probably exactly what was happening.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Hermione felt a powerful wave of both affection and irritation. Ron was by no means an idiot or purposefully inconsiderate, but he sometimes did forget certain things might be nice to know. This being a prime example.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“We’ve been together about two month now, and recently decided to go public,” Ron hastened to explain. “And coming here was a bit last minute. Gabrielle wanted to see some different charities, you know, ask about donating...”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“I will be donating to yours!” said Gabrielle, smiling.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Oh that’s very kind,” said Hermione, returning the smile. “What do you do, Gabrielle?” She was wondering how this younger woman had so much money that she could frequent an event where the wealthy people of Wizarding Britain essentially decided which charities to throw their money at.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>As far as she understood, the Delacours were not hurting for money, but they weren’t that wealthy either.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“I am a model,” she said cheerfully. “Eet pays nicely.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p><em>I bet it does</em>, thought Hermione, gazing at Gabrielle’s unworldly beauty and feeling an annoying twinge of inadequacy.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>"Are you – er – here with someone?” Ron asked tentatively.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“No,” said Hermione.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She should have stopped there.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She wasn't sure what possessed her to continue. Possibly the look of polite surprise on Gabrielle's face, or the flash of pity that she saw on Ron's.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>But next thing she knew, she was word vomiting.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“I mean – well – I <em>am</em> seeing someone. It’s...a bit new. And we just want to keep things quiet at first. He’s, um, a very private person in that way, but we were planning on...um, coming out with it soon.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p><em>Oh my god, what are you saying</em>?? she screamed internally.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Oh!” exclaimed Gabrielle, clapping her hands together excitedly. “I just ‘ad the most wonderful idea!” She took Hermione’s hands in hers. “We ‘are going away to France for a long weekend, and we leave theez Friday,” she explained, “There are other couples coming weez us, but one ‘ad to cancel yesterday...”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Hermione saw where this was going and tried to stifle the rising sense of dread.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Per’aps you would like to come? Eef you worry about privacy, eet will not be in England, so none of theez ‘orrible reporters...” She scowled for a brief moment, still looking like utter perfection as she did so, her eyes ranging behind Hermione and to one of the many paparazzi present in the room. But she was quickly giving Hermione an earnest smile again. “We will all stay at the <em>chateau</em> of my family! We would <em>adore</em> ‘aving you and your lover weez us, ‘ermione!”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Hermione did not need to look at Ron to know he was massively uncomfortable. She heard the slight shuffling of his dress shoes on the floor.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Oh....oh, Gabrielle, that truly is so thoughtful, but...” She searched desperately for an excuse. “Work is so busy, you know...”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>At that, Ron scoffed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>It was the tiniest of scoffs, and he disguised it as a cough.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He had often complained that her work drowned her. He hadn’t technically been wrong, but the little sound hinted at a smug sort of knowledge that she hadn’t changed for <em>this</em> relationship. And despite the fact that this mystery man was completely made up and that, again, Ron technically wasn’t wrong – Hermione <em>did</em> tend to bury herself in work, and it had gotten even worse since they had ended things – she found herself getting defensive, especially remembering all the arguments she and Ron had gotten into over this very thing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“But perhaps we can make it work,” said Hermione firmly, and Ron’s eyes widened slightly when she glanced at him. The surprise in them gave her a feeling of vicious pleasure, despite the fact that what she was doing was utterly insane and she would surely regret this in less than five minutes. “Getting away from England would be nice for us both, I think.” She forced a smile, even though she rather felt like she was going to explode.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p><em>What the hell are you saying?? There is no ‘us’!!</em> her logical brain screeched.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Her emotional brain gave them both a pleasant smile.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Oh, ‘ow wonderful!” said Gabrielle, kissing Hermione’s cheeks again. “I can send you zee details by owl in zee morning!”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Sounds lovely,” said Hermione, hoping Gabrielle would forget or change her mind and this would never be spoken of again. “Well, I just wanted to say hello. I’m very happy for you both. Have a nice time.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She gave another perfunctory smile, they both hugged her and bid goodbye, and when she stepped away she saw that reporters and paparazzi were already descending on Ron and Gabrielle.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Her feet took her back to the bar of their own accord. Each step filled her with a rising sense of panic and foolishness.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“The mighty lioness returns,” drawled Malfoy, eyes full of mischief.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Oh shut it, Malfoy, not now,” she said, desperately wringing her hands and sitting in the exact same stool as before, slumping dramatically over the bar. “Oh, Merlin. What have I done? <em>Shit</em>.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Another one for the lady, I think,” she heard Malfoy say to the bartender. “That bad, Granger? Didn’t look like it from here.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>The fact that he had been watching her flounder made it so much worse, even if it didn’t <em>look</em> like she had been floundering. Then again, her back had been to the bar and he had probably mostly been treated to Gabrielle’s intoxicating smiles. Maybe the Veela in her had somehow made Hermione drunker than usual, despite the fact that Hermione should be immune. She also hadn’t eaten dinner and she had slammed back that whiskey.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Ugh, she was so stupid. And she still had to go try and do fundraising, which she was in no mood or state to go and do.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“She’s lovely,” grumbled Hermione, reaching for the glass the bartender passed her and taking a drink immediately. “But it was horrible. Ron asked if I was here with someone, and of course I said no because that was the truth, but then...” She stopped with a little groan, realizing who she was speaking to.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Malfoy just tilted his head. “Then?” he prodded.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>The words spilled out. “Then I saw <em>pity</em>. And I...said things. Without thinking.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“What things?”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Untrue things!” she moaned, clutching her glass tighter. “I told them I was seeing someone, but that we’re just keeping things quiet, and then Gabrielle invited us to a weekend at her bloody chateau in France so I tried to...to use work as an excuse. But then Ron scoffed, and work had always been a sore point with us, so I – I <em>agreed</em>! Like an idiot! And – and Merlin, why am I talking to <em>you</em> about this? I’m giving you free ammunition! Not that your Pureblood arse even knows what ammunition <em>is</em>, but the point stands that–”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Just tell them you’re sick when it comes,” suggested Malfoy, cutting off her ranting. His eyes were glittering with amusement and he seemed to be fighting the urge to laugh.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“I don’t want to lose this breakup,” she growled, slamming back the rest of her glass of whiskey and then setting it back on the counter with more force than necessary.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“You’re a bit of a lightweight, aren’t you?” he commented, frowning, but she hardly heard him.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“I suppose I already have lost it,” she said dully.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>It was silent for a long time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>So long that she finally looked up miserably, resigning herself to get Malfoy’s teasing over with. But he didn’t look about to tease. He had a strange expression on his features and a light in his eyes that she couldn’t quite interpret.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Then again, she was tipsy.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She really should have eaten a bigger dinner.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She never should have gone for a drink in the first place.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Well, go on,” she said, sighing. “Have at it.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He smirked, and the curious light that had been in his eyes faded. “Actually, I have a suggestion that might help you.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“You do?” She gaped at him, eyes widening.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He nodded slowly, appraising her. “I can pose as this made up man.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>There was another long silence as she stared at him, mouth wide open, until he finally said snidely, “You’ll attract flies, you know.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“You?” she finally gasped.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Me,” he said calmly, though she thought she saw him stiffen a little on his stool. But then he leaned forward and explained very quietly, “It would make sense for us to keep a relationship quiet at first, wouldn’t it? And it’s mutually beneficial, Granger. You get to keep your pride and I am publicly seen dating a war heroine. We can quietly “end” things a predetermined amount of time after we get back. Tell everyone it’s amicable. Act normal at the charities. It ends up being good for both of us.” He suddenly grinned viciously. “Also, Weasley would hate that it’s me and I would thoroughly enjoy making him squirm.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>She threw him an exasperated look at that but then moved her gaze to stare unseeingly at the various bottles behind the bar. “Well...” said Hermione slowly. “I suppose when you put it that way...” She nodded, turning fully in the stool to face him. “Fine. If you’re willing, then it’s a deal.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He rolled his eyes. “I wouldn’t have suggested it if I wasn’t willing.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“But you’ll have to kiss me,” she said bluntly. “And touch me and act affectionate with me. In front of everyone. If you can’t handle – ”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He suddenly reached out and covered her hand with his and she faltered.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He was surprisingly warm. She had been expecting him to feel like ice. Maybe because of all the paleness, or how sharp his features were. For a moment, she just stared up at his face, eyes ranging over him with a newfound curiosity. She found herself lingering the longest on the curve of his mouth.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Checking out your prize, Granger?”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He was grinning again, and when her eyes moved up to his she saw a knowing glint in them. She flushed. “Intellectual curiosity.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Well, you’ll satisfy it soon enough,” said Malfoy, pulling his hand away and finishing his drink. He leaned forward again. “Besides, the better question is whether <em>you</em> are ready to answer questions about why you’d stoop to <em>my</em> level, Granger. Not to mention that there may be the issue of dealing with my family. And considering that you are a horrible liar, I don’t have much confidence in your acting skills, so if being near me repulses you–”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“It doesn’t repulse me,” she said, frowning. “You’re attractive enough, Malfoy.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>His eyes glittered. “You really <em>are</em> a lightweight. I was referring to our tumultuous history and the disdain you seem to have for me, but by all means, continue complimenting my physical appearance under the influence of whiskey.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Shut up,” she said, swatting his shoulder. “I’m sure I’ll manage.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He stood from his stool and took a step closer. “You’re certain?”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Yes,” she said. “I’ve thought it through.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Well then,” he murmured. “I’ll contact you tomorrow for details. Now go home.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“What? But the donations–”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“I’ll take care of it. I’m already here, aren’t I? Besides, I speak their language.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Oh, but–”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>He chuckled. “Granger, that was my polite way of telling you that I am afraid of you going around and asking for donations due to your tipsiness, but since you are obviously unable to take a hint, I will say it more directly. I will get more money than you will. Leave it to me. Go home and rest. And drink water.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Right,” said Hermione, feeling rather dazed. She desperately scanned her brain for something to say in a situation like this. Anything.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>What is the proper thing to say to your sometimes coworker who you once truly despised as children but you now actually mostly get along with, just after said coworker agreed to be your fake boyfriend?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>Nope. Nothing. She had no idea what to say.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="">
    <p>“Well, bye then,” was all that came out, and the last thing she saw as she unsteadily moved out of her stool and away from the bar was his amused grin.</p>
  </div>
</div>
  </div>
