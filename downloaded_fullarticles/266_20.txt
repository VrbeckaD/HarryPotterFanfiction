          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco and Harry had two very different styles.</p>
<p>     Draco had dyed his hair black and started to wear black and white striped shirts under random band tee shirts. Not to mention chains. Lots of them.</p>
<p>     Harry had started to wear baggy shirts and scrunchies all on his wrist. He also carried around a hydroflask and had metal straws in his pocket.</p>
<p>     Both boys had been walking into the Great Hall when Harry dropped his hydroflask.</p>
<p>     "And I oop! Sksksksksk" Harry voiced while bending down to pick up his hydroflask.</p>
<p>     This made Draco s n a p.</p>
<p>     Drace got one of his chains and wrapped it around Harry's neck, choking the boy out.</p>
<p>     Harry coughed and started hitting Draco's legs with his hydroflask.</p>
<p>     "IM SICK AND TIRED OF YOUR 'OOPS' AND 'SKSK'ING NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE FUCKING TURTLES!" Draco yelled.</p>
<p>     Harry grabbed one of his metal straws and stabbed it into Draco's hand.</p>
<p>     "OW WHAT THE FUCK!" Draco retreated his hand and rubbed it. Definitely going to bruise.</p>
<p>     "SAVE! tHe MOTHERFUCKING! tUrTLES!!!" Harry charged at Draco with his hydroflask.</p>
<p>     Just before he was about to whack Draco, Hermione walked between the two and sighed.</p>
<p>     "You absolute gay fucks." Hermione shook her head before grabbing one of Harry's scrunchies off his wrist and putting it on Draco's</p>
<p>     The two boy's blushed and looked at each other before having an epic angry make out session.</p>
<p>     "Ah, young love." Dumbledore smiled.</p></div>
