    <p>"I don't believe you! What makes you think that my daughter is a witch?" Vallia and her mother sat together on the couch in their living room, watching Vallia's father pace in front of the strangely dressed woman.</p><p>"I wish I could give you an exact answer, Mr Malek. But this is hardly a science."</p><p>"Then why would we let her go with you?" Vallia's mother pulled herself upright, standing almost the same height as the strange woman.</p><p>"It would be for her benefit. She turned eleven last year, and you know that her abilities have started to manifest. The fire in the street last month?" Both of Vallia's parents paused. "She missed the cutoff to attend our school last year. However, we would be more than happy to take her this year."</p><p>Vallia looked at her mother as the woman sat down next to her again.</p><p>"What would she be allowed to take?" Her father asked quietly, talking to a much different tune than just a few seconds prior.</p><p>"Whatever she needs. We're open to everyone, that I can promise you, Mr Malek." The woman assured. "I'll leave you to make your decision. Here is her letter." The woman set an envelope on the coffee table, before sweeping out of the room dramatically, the front door shutting softly behind her. </p><p>Vallia darted to the large window in the living room, hoping to catch even a glimpse of the woman. But surprisingly, she wasn't there. In fact, there was no sign of her, only a tabby cat running across the street. The girl turned around again at the sound of her parents arguing.</p><p>"Mina, she was right! We both know that the fire was Vallia, she can't control this! If they can teach her, then we should let them!"</p><p>"She's our daughter! She's only eleven! And you just want to send her away without a second thought?"</p><p>"We've been thinking about it since we got the first letter, Mina. I feel like this will be good for her." Mina sighed, and looked back at her daughter, standing there, just watching what was happening in front of her.</p><p>"You know Professor McGonagall will make sure nothing bad will happen to her, to the best of the Professor's abilities." Vallia's father put his hands on Mina's shoulders. </p><p>Mina sighed and knelt down next to Vallia. "Vallia, do you know what we've been talking about?" Her daughter shook her head. "We're thinking about sending you to a new school. It's kind of far away, but they really want you to go to their school. What do you think, dear?"</p><p>Vallia shrugged. "I don't know. Will I still be allowed to say my prayers?"</p><p>"The Professor said that you would be able to do what you need to, Val." Her father said, standing behind Mina. "In the end, it's up to you."</p><p>Vallia, all of eleven years old, nodded. "I want to go." Mina and her father both sighed.</p><p>"Alright, dearheart. Alright"</p>
