  <i>It is theorized that a wizard’s consciousness is contained entirely within their magic, such that should a wizard be stripped of everything but their magic, they remain capable of thought and awareness.</i>
</p><p>She didn’t know where she was. She felt caught in that fugue state of not-quite-awake, or perhaps awake-for-far-too-long: nothing felt <em>real.</em> Everything lacked that edge of reality, the bite of complete awareness, the sting of <em>here.</em></p><p>Was her mind too fatigued to perceive it? </p><p>Had she once more pushed herself too far, demanded too much of her frail human body, drove herself relentlessly onward, failing to pause, to rest, until the choice, like so many before it, was taken from her...</p><p>Or had it been her demons, haunting her, wresting away what should have been a restful sleep, a chance for her to recuperate, and twisting it into a dungeon of horrors, corrupting what was and is with what could have been, the innumerable barbs pricking at her as she drowned in darkness…</p><p>Or perhaps she was ill, a fever wreaking havoc on her mind as her immune system fought. Perhaps too she was drugged, her mind forcibly addled for as long as it was within her system. </p><p>That should have alarmed her.</p><p>
  <i>Some people believe this is what happens during apparition, to a lesser extent: rather than stripping away your being, it is instead compressed, allowing your magic to encapsulate you in your entirety. </i>
</p><p>She didn’t know where she was. All she saw, all she heard, all she felt, all she perceived, was an <em>absence.</em></p>
<p></p><div class="font-transparent">
  <p>
    <em>Please…</em>
  </p>
</div><p>What? It was faint, fleeting, ephemeral. Had she merely imagined it? Was she so desperate to fill the <em>absence</em> that her mind, the brilliant, terrible thing it was, conjured specters of her imagination?</p><p>She heard something.</p>
<p></p><div class="font-transparent">
  <p>
    <em>Someone, anyone…</em>
  </p>
</div><p>There it was again. And the doubt that it had simply been a machination of her mind ebbed away as details slotted into place, too numerous and too confusing for her mind to have created. <span class="font-transparent">Probably.</span></p><p>Someone was...someone was calling her. Calling <em>for</em> her.</p><p>
    <em>Help…</em>
  </p><p>She <em>moved.</em> She had no sense of her body, saw no glimmer of light, heard not a whisper more, felt no wind part before her motion—all she could sense was herself—her abstract being—, the distress of the person calling her, and the distance between them. It was unacceptable.</p><p>She <em>moved,</em> willing herself closer without hesitation, without pause, knowing instinctively, subconsciously, from the depths of her very being, how to close that gap. Someone needed her help and she <em>knew</em> she couldn’t help from where she was, not as she was, not as they were; but she <em>could</em> help, if only she was—</p><p>
  <i>Apparition is only for an instant, but the proponents of this theory take the strictly-physical effects of splinching as proof that it is your consciousness, through your magic, that travels, and the rest of you simply hitches a ride, to varying degrees of success.</i>
</p>
<p></p><div class="font-transparent font-serif">
  <p>How you have wandered...</p>
</div><p>Much later, she would think back to this moment, and wonder if perhaps this was what Icarus felt, flying too close to the sun. One moment she was moving, and in the next all she knew was <em>pain.</em>
</p><p>
  <i>What would demonstrate this theory to its full extent? A form of self-travel that lasts longer, much longer, than an instant and for the entirety of its duration requires that a consciousness be borne only through magic. Such a consciousness is typically dead, much less aware. That’s a large part of why this remains just a theory.</i>
</p><p> </p><p>Was she screaming? A part of her wondered, blind and deaf and numb to anything but agony.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>And then she knew nothing at all.</p><p> </p><p>
  <i>Living? Well, that would require one hell of a tether, wouldn't it.</i>
