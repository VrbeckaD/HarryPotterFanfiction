    <p>If you had asked Harry Potter what he was going to do after finishing off his nemesis Voldemort for good, he probably wouldn't have been able to tell you. He'd been fighting ol’ Snake Face for his entire life. Now that he didn't have to, he had no clue what to do with himself. </p><p>What was a child soldier suppose to do once he was no longer needed? </p><p>He could return to Hogwarts to finish his seventh year, like Hermione was. He could join Ron in entering the Auror Corps training program, like he was expected to. He could run off with Blaise and pursue a partnership in potion and alchemy entrepreneuring, like he was cautiously warned away from (still, nobody would be all too surprised if he <em> did </em> , you see? Except, Zabini’s a <em> Slytherin </em>, Harry...).</p><p>He’d throw them all a plot twist, per say, and do none of those things. </p><p>Not everyone knew the exact story of what happened in the final Battle. Though, all sorts of them will tell you, of course, “Harry Potter became the new master of the elder wand, and used it’s unbeatable power to defeat You-Know-Who!” and “Harry Potter used strategic brilliance to outmaneuver the Death Eater forces and bring victory to the Light!” and “General Potter dueled the Dark Lord, and <em> won </em>.”</p><p>They didn’t know what really happened that night. No one does, actually.</p><p>Nobody but Hadrian Potter, and Death and all it’s Reapers.</p><p>Or… <em> his </em>Reapers. </p><p>At first, he’d been angry. Why did these things always happen to him? Why not anyone else? Harry Potter always seemed to get the short end of the stick, the end that came with serious missions where everyone relied on you to <em> do the right thing </em>, and... piles of unending paperwork.</p><p>Paperwork was evil, and Harry Potter despised it. </p><p>He’d moved on to bargaining next, having skipped right on over denial (he’d gotten used to it, you know? There’s no use denying the bad luck you always knew was capable of throwing you even more grief). Only to discover, what was this? There was no need to bargain because this whole “Master of Death” gig was not quite what he’d been expecting?</p><p>He’d like to tell you that the depression came next, but then he’d be lying. He’d always had that. It had only gotten heavier since.</p><p>The only thing left was acceptance, and, considering where he was at that very moment, Hadrian considered himself very accepting of the circumstances. </p><p>“What brought you across the pond?”</p><p>
  <em> It was a bloodbath.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The soles of his boots were soaked in the stuff, he knew he'd never be able to get rid of it. It would literally haunt his every footstep from this point forward, something that he knew he deserved. Looking over his shoulder at every turn, wand up his sleeve in an invisible scabbard, waiting.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Their faces swam before his vision, two for each. The same people never looked so apart from their own visages. They were alive, laughing. And then there was the other, cold and still. They followed him, too.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> More faces, only these ones are alive. Asking, “Harry, what's the hold up, mate?” and “You need to plan for your future, now.” It was stifling. He couldn't breath.  </em>
</p><p>He smiled serenely. “I just needed a… change in scenery.”</p><p>“And your experience in this field?”</p><p>
  <em> Late nights, often staring at nothing, but knowing there could always be something. Something dangerous, something that meant death. Huddled around the campfire, sometimes not because it was too dangerous for even that, so- cold night, huddled closer for warmth that wouldn't come, eyes always vigilant, searching the darkness. Guarding.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Leaves rustling, footstep stumbling, shoes squeaking, one mistake. Flashes of light, colors of urgent, be alert, painful, dive! </em>
</p><p>“Oh, plenty. I’ve headed security for several projects.” </p><p>“Your past employers have commented staunchly on your trustworthiness.” </p><p>
  <em> Trust? Password, ask them for a phrase. It's their face, but what if it isn't? If they get it wrong, they're dead anyway.  </em>
</p><p>“Of course. What about your education?”</p><p>
  <em> “Harry, please listen to me!” She pleaded. Or demanded. It could be both, knowing her. “You really should finish your schooling, why not come back with me? Think about it, an entire year that's just… normal!” </em>
</p><p>“... Six years in a military training school would suffice for this, I should think. Shouldn’t it?”</p><p>
  <em> It was never normal, and why couldn't she understand that? Faces, always staring. Accusing, in awe, in anger, some even in fear. He wanted nothing to do with it.  </em>
</p><p>“And why should I hire you?”</p><p>
  <em> They'd be smiling, perhaps, if their faces weren't nearly completely obscured by the shadows of their hoods. A voice that didn't make a sound, always cheerful, emanating from within.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Master, there's something that might interest you.”  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Yes,” another, identical, agreed. “It's been a point of puzzlement for us, for quite a while now. A place that interferes with the Circle.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “And not in the way you might be thinking, either! We deal in Death, as you well know. But this place, a bubble of the opposite! We can't tell where it's coming from, and we can't enter it. So strange! All we can do is watch from afar, but our observations have brought us nothing.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “You, though,” a third peers at him, nose to his nose. “You could enter. See what all the fuss is about. It's been stressing Death out for ages, sometimes moving but not often. Started out in Egypt but hasn't been for ages. It's in America, now.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Why not check it out? It'll give you something to do, and get you away from… all the undesired attention. Win-win, right?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “What will I be looking for, exactly?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “You'll know it when you see it. A small area, just a building. Life blooms in it every night, and ceases every morning until midnight, before it starts all over again. Strange thing is, though; there's no output of death. The life appears, then disappears, out of absolutely nowhere. Boggles the mind.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Should be easy enough to get looking,” the first informed him mischievously. “It's at a museum, in New York. They've got a night guard position open. A general would be the perfect fit for it, wouldn't you think?” </em>
</p><p>Another smile.</p><p>“Well… you <em> do </em> need me.”</p><p>The curator, McPhee, slapped the file on the desk that sat between them. He lifted a hand and rubbed at his eyes. </p><p>“That's true, yes,” his fellow Englishman signed. “That's not the point, though— listen, all I'm asking is the standard interview for a new employee, you get it?”</p><p>“I do,” Hadrian Potter-Black replied quickly, amiable smile never leaving his face. “You're only doing your job, of course. To be more efficient, though, why not get straight to the root of it? You need a security guard. I can do that. Job done, right?”</p><p>“Job <em> to </em> be done,” McPhee corrected. “But… well, you're not wrong. Alright then?”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>“Brilliant, you're hired.” The curator stamped something down on the file and signed another page off with a flourish. He spun it around and offered his new employee the pen. Hadrian took it graciously, and they set about getting the paperwork filled. </p><p>“Don't duff around, and we'll get along fine, yes?”</p><p>“I couldn't agree more.”</p><p>And that was the end of it, really.  </p><p>One could hope, after all. </p><p>

</p><p>It was a nice place, two streets down from Central Park. The location made it busy, sure, and at times it could get a bit crowded, but that's what Hadrian liked about his apartment. The walls were thick, and sound had it's own trouble trying to penetrate such guards. </p><p>That wasn't to say he was safe from sounds inside its walls, however. </p><p>“No, ‘Mione, listen—“ the young Black pinched the bridge of his nose, taking a quick breath. “I already <em>told</em> you, didn't I? I said— no, that is <em>not</em> what I said and you know it… What? I never promised such a thing! Why would you think…? Just because— Ronald Weasley, you give Hermione back her cell right this instant, <em>no I am not going to argue with you</em> <em>about this— </em>right, I'm hanging up—“</p><p>With an explosive sigh, Hadrian slammed the phone back into its cradle, rubbing his face with his hands. He tilted himself backwards and leaned against the polished wood of the walls, praying for patience. From <em> who </em>, exactly, was still up for debate, but for now the prayer floated there, without ties, hopefully to reach some deity that might ease his anxiety a precious few moments. </p><p>He purses his lips and cast a glance at the window, peering through the gap in the curtains to see the bright lights of New York outside, the sky beyond them just beginning to darken for evening. Checking his watch, he saw that it was 7:30, nearing the beginning for his new job. </p><p>He pushed off the walls and made his way to the door, slipping on a dark navy uniform jacket. Grabbing his keys from the bowl on the shelf next to the coat stand, he made one last cursory glance over his new abode before turning his back and exiting. </p><p>It was time to see just what it was about this museum that got his Reapers’ knickers in a bunch. </p><p>

</p><p>“Naw, Mr. Frederick was my father,” Mr. Frederick told him amiably. “Call me Cecil.” He had a rough voice, like sandpaper against gravel. </p><p>Hadrian raised a brow as the snowy-haired head of security- or rather, <em> ex </em>-head of security- opened the lower half of the door and captured his hand and gave it a good shake in greeting. He tightened the hold and returned the gesture. </p><p>“Nice good handshake,” Cecil noted, pleased. “I like that. Tells a lot about a man.”</p><p>It absolutely did. A weak handshake showed a person that was either too conscious of their own strength, had trouble with commitment, or didn't think much of you. A tight grip coupled with a strong arm showed that the person either had something to prove or wished to intimidate.</p><p>That Frederick’s handshake was a bit too rough and unrefined for Hadrian’s tastes, he didn't voice aloud. </p><p>“Come on in,” he allowed himself to be manhandled past the threshold instead. </p><p>As he followed Frederick to the back, the man clapped his hands together. </p><p>“Let's tap turkey here,” he started off, with some odd American idiom that Hadrian couldn't make heads nor tails of. He sat behind a cluttered desk and turned an imploring gaze up at the younger man. </p><p>“The museum is losing money, hand over fist. Guess kids these days aren't all that interested in wax figures or stuffed animals. So they're downsizing, which means they're firing the three security guards and replacing them with one new guard. You.”</p><p>Hadrian shrugged helplessly at him. </p><p>“Sorry,” he said, not really feeling halfway sincere. </p><p>Frederick shrugged, an overexaggerated move where his arms flailed out dramatically and his face took on a look of good-natured resignation. Hadrian resisted the urge to chuckle at him. </p><p>“Well, what can you do? Oh! Here,” he jumped up from the office chair, surprisingly spry for an older man, “I’d like ya to meet my two colleagues- Reginald!”</p><p>Hadrian turned, to see two other men of elderly dispositions sitting across the room. Well, one was sitting, a dark man in a faded green recliner, with a newspaper unfolded across his lap, who glanced up as he was called. </p><p>The other was sprawled out across a small, washed out couch, thin blanket tossed over his legs and snoring like a lawn mower. He was a shade or two paler than Frederick, with a receding hairline and a squat build. </p><p>“Reginald! Ah,” Frederick cast the slumbering man an exasperated look, raising his voice. “<em> Gus </em>!”</p><p>Hadrian twitched back slightly, nearly reaching for the firearm strapped against the small of his back, when the man suddenly came alive without warning, letting out a startled and loud holler.</p><p>“HA! WHERE IS ‘E? I’LL BEAT ‘IM WITH MY FIST!” Gus shouted, sitting upright. He blinked blearily and surveyed the room with a narrow-eyed glower. “I'll beat ‘im with my… <em> hrmn </em>…” he broke off into indiscernible grumbling. </p><p>Frederick glanced at Hadrian with an impossibly mirthful grin, as if sharing a joke, before turning back to his fellows. </p><p>“Gus, Reginald.” He said, gesturing to the balding man, and the taller one still reclined lazily in his chair, respectfully. “Fella’s, this is Hadrian Black, the kid who wants to be the new night guard.”</p><p>Hadrian suppressed a sigh as he received two glance overs, one from a cautiously welcoming Reginald and another much more suspicious and surly from Gus. </p><p>“Most important position in the museum, Hadrian!” Reginald greeted, nodding down at him. Hadrian tried his best not to bristle at the utterly unintended slight toward his height, knowing the older man hadn't meant anything at all. </p><p>Sometimes his sensitivity to the fact was ridiculous, and he despaired at his own fragility. </p><p>“He looks like a weirdo,” Gus commented tactfully. </p><p>Hadrian raised an eyebrow. “I'm <em> British </em> . To me, <em> you're </em> the weird one.”</p><p>Frederick laughed. “Wonderful guard, terrible people skills. I do apologize for him.”</p><p>“No need, truly.”</p><p>Gus was undeterred. “Listen lunchbox, don't try anything funny. I once went nine rounds with John L. Sullivan!”</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Hadrian caught Frederick glancing away and mouthing the words as they were spoken, and suppressed a smirk. </p><p>“You’ve never fought John L. Sullivan in your life!” Reginald retorted. </p><p>“Gentlemen,” Frederick attempted to take back the reins before the conversation got too off track. “We have a job candidate here, he- “</p><p>“Actually,” Hadrian cut in, “I <em> have </em> already been hired.”</p><p>Frederick glanced over at him, for the first time appearing genuinely surprised.</p><p>“Have you, then?”</p><p>The young Lord Black tilted his head, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. </p><p>Reginald and Gus exchanged an unreadable look. </p><p>“Well!” Frederick clapped his hands again, rubbing them together. “No need for an interview from us old geezers, is there? Right this way, kid- why don't you let me show you the ropes.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>He followed Frederick back through the door and was led through a narrow hallway that opened up into a wing of the museum, separated only by a door with “employees only” painted on the other side of the blurry glass window. </p><p>“Head on up to the second floor,” Frederick told him. “I'll meet you there. Gotta go slip my orthopedics on- arthritic knees, you know?”</p><p>“Comes with age, I suppose.”</p><p>Frederick chuckled good-naturedly, and disappeared back down the hallway and into the guard room. </p><p>Hadrian turned around, intending to push through the door and enter the exhibits section of the museum, when a tap on his shoulder distracted him. </p><p>He turned, and immediately went deadpan, “Thought you lot “couldn't enter the museum.’”</p><p>“We <em> can't </em>!” His reaper defended, a nearly scandalized expression in its voice. “We'd never lie to you, master!”</p><p>“What do you call this, then?”</p><p>“Well,” the thing took up a sly look, “we’re not exactly <em> in </em> the museum, sir. This office is an adjacent wing, not actually part of the museum proper.”</p><p>“Right.” Hadrian replied flatly. “What do you want.”</p><p>His reaper brightened. “We said we'd contact you with new information, didn't we?”</p><p>“Spit it out, Clarence.”</p><p>“My name is <em> Chalance </em>...” Clarence pouted. “Alright, our watchers picked up on a sudden… well, there's no way to describe it other than ‘a sudden spike of power,’ the moment that you entered the museum yesterday.”</p><p>When he'd come for the interview with the curator. “What kind of power?”</p><p>“Similar to the readings on whatever it is that's causing this unnatural phenomenon.”</p><p>“And you still have no clue what that is?”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Some help you are, truly.”</p><p>Clarence pouted again. </p><p>Hadrian shook his head. “So whatever strange magic that’s fooling around with the Cycle bylaws is, what, interested in me?”</p><p>“Sure is,” his Reaper leered. “We just thought you should know. Tread cautiously… is what I'd say if you were some normal human.”</p><p>“But I'm not.”</p><p>“But you're not,” it agreed. “This is just so you have all the facts, master. It's well known, how you hate being uninformed. We <em> do </em> care about your sanity, you know.”</p><p>“You have a weird way of showing it, sometimes,” Hadrian murmured, glancing back down the hallway. Really, he should have left for the second floor several minutes ago. The fact that Frederick had yet to return, though, brought up some light suspicions that he couldn't bat away. </p><p>Surely, it didn't take this long to slip in some orthopedics? </p><p>“Thanks,” he tossed at his Reaper, who sent an overjoyed grin his way as he entered the museum’s large corridors. The skin along his shoulders tingled strangely as the herald of death disappeared back to its patrol. </p><p>

</p><p>“I'm not really as spry as I used to be, kid,” Frederick warned him as they entered the Diorama room. </p><p>Hadrian gazed around, interested to see the different tiny civilizations of history spread out for the exhibit. From his quick glance, he could name ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece, and even an old Western cowboy town. There was also a tiny Mayan civilization off to one side. The minuscule figures were frozen as they went about their daily lives, building pyramids, creating the fine arts, and wrangling cattle, all of them looking as serious as could be. </p><p>They were adorable. </p><p>He turned his attention back to his tour guide, and narrowed his eyes almost mockingly. “... You could have fooled me.”</p><p>“Could I?” Frederick looked almost delighted at what might have been taken as a compliment. “You flatter me, son. But I <em> am </em> old, and a whole lot slower than I was at your age.”</p><p>He herded Hadrian through to the next exhibit, pointing out to the younger man another employee entrance nestled between the alcoves by the signs pointing to the restrooms that were apparently located down the hall from where they walked. </p><p>“Take a left through there, and it'll lead you back to the guards locker room. There's another door outside the desert animal exhibit that does the same, just go right and take two left turns with that one. Don't use the one in the main lobby with the T-Rex, that one takes you to McPhee’s office, and,” Frederick cast him a furtive glance, lowering his voice, “he doesn't like people in there.”</p><p>Hadrian nodded, bemused. His fellow Englishman had indeed seemed quite territorial and, dare he say it, obsessively compulsive with his work space. </p><p>Frederick showed him the spaces for the last few exhibits, and allowed Hadrian to look around for a little while before he and the others shut things down for the night. On the tour he was shown Attila and his Huns, the large stone Head from the popular Easter Island, and the African animals exhibit, where he was introduced to a stuffed monkey named Dexter that Frederick seemed to dislike for some reason. He was poking around the Native American exhibit, curious about the history despite himself, when the lights above were suddenly enveloped by darkness with a loud, mechanical click that echoed throughout the building. </p><p>Although he'd been expecting it, Hadrian could help but stiffen, muscles going taught as he fell into a more ready stance. </p><p>He blinked, and then relaxed, shaking his head at himself. He was about to turn to head back to the guard rooms when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye. </p><p>One of the Native figurines was trying to sneak out of its exhibit. </p><p>Hadrian narrowed his eyes at it, but didn't turn his head. </p><p>Suddenly, as he passed, it lurched out at him widely, and yelled, “AH!”</p><p>Hadrian jerked back, hand flying to the small of his back, before immediately sighing in exasperation and rolling his eyes. “Mr. Frederick, please.”</p><p>The older man laughed loudly as he tugged the headdress off. “Sorry, sorry. I couldn't help myself. Gotta let a grandpa like me have some childish fun sometimes, yknow?”</p><p>“You're not that old,” Hadrian protested, and received a embellished mock-fond smile from the ex-head of security. </p><p>“I'm flattered you think so. Ah… moving on!” There came the hand clap. “This stuff is really old, so, aha, you… probably shouldn't play with it.”</p><p>Hadrian was amused. “I won't tattle, I promise.”</p><p>The older man brightened. “Great! Right, this way…”</p><p>He was led up a flight of stairs to the top floor, where the African exhibit was, and where the decor became more in tune with the dry continent. Frederic gestures him to the northern section, and showed him past two colossal black statues of the Egyptian god Anubis. </p><p>Hadrian forcefully turned his mind away from the irony of entering a place guarded by the visages of a deity of death. </p><p>In the chamber, lined with ancient slabs of stone etched with faded hieroglyphics, placed on a clean, minimalistic pedestal, was a guilted sarcophagus. </p><p>“The tomb of the Pharaoh, Ahkmenrah.” Frederick announced, gesturing at the ancient coffin. “And right in there is the great king himself.”</p><p>The breath in Hadrian’s lungs stilled for a moment, and he felt his forearms tingle with his own innate magics.</p><p>Above the pharaoh’s sarcophagus, hanging on the wall in the place of honor, obviously having been deemed of great important by the archeologists that had dug it up, was a gold tablet. </p><p>Unbidden, Hadrian's eyes surged with his power, and his vision went pale blue. All aside from the tablet, which shone bright golden light, as if it were a star. A tendril of that gleamed down and attached itself to a more dull but no less blinding ball of light that sat within the sarcophagus. </p><p>Hadrian bit his lip. Obviously, this was what was created the blips in his Reaper’s readings. </p><p>Of course it would be something left over from the notorious magics of Ancient Egypt. The great civilization was famous for impossible feats of the supernatural kind, and had gone down in history as one of the founding origins of magic itself. Artifacts of great power and mysterious academics from the old country still popped up to this day, and the archeologists and historians of the magical world all went mad with excitement every time they did. </p><p>“-his most prized possession,” Frederick was saying, grandly, and Hadrian zeroed his attention in on the words, “the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.”</p><p>The Tablet gleamed, cheekily, as if it were winking at him. Hadrian shut off his mage sight with an ominous feeling building up within himself. </p><p>“24-karat gold, that thing is,” Frederick commented wistfully, voice going soft. It sent off warning bells in Hadrian's head, and the young Brit turned to regard him carefully. </p><p>Frederick caught his gaze, and grinned. “Must cost a fortune, right? Hey, let's head back to the lobby and get you situated, hm?”</p><p>Hadrian watched him walk ahead, eyes glued to the older man’s back. He narrowed them, and gnawed on his lip. As he followed, something in his core lurched, as if the tablet or something else near it were attempting to tug him back. </p><p>Curious, all of it. </p>
