"Ten points from Hufflepuff for the slow reaction, Miss Weasley."</p><p>Victoire grinned. "Wicked!"</p><p>Teddy asked, "Shall we see if my disguise works?"</p><p>Victoire smirked. "Let me help get you proper clothes that Professor Longbottom would wear, Ted."</p><p>Teddy changed back to his self and insisted, "After you, Vic."</p><p>Victoire pulled him along to her dorm and told him, "Wait here."</p><p>She disappeared into her dorm and emerged with a bundle of clothes.</p><p>Teddy inquired, "Is that the outfit?"</p><p>Victoire nodded and prompted, "Try it on."</p><p>Teddy said, "I will if you turn around first, Vic."</p><p>Victoire turned around and Teddy quickly changed into the disguise Victoire had put together for him.</p><p>Teddy queried, "What do you think?"</p><p>Victoire smirked.
