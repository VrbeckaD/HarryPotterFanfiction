</p><p align="center">Kudos to frumpologist for making this beautiful aesthetic!</p><p align="left"> </p><p>"Pansy's jeans are awfully tight."</p><p>Hermione sipped on her water, turning her head to observe an unexpected couple sprawled across one of the sofas.</p><p>"I don't see how Potter should be able to get his hands down them, but alas, I stand corrected," Draco added casually as he looked ahead, but Hermione had the impression that his eyes flickered to hers for a second.</p><p>Face buried in Pansy's neck from behind, Harry seemed to have a similar thought. He pulled his fingers out of her trousers to nimbly open the button and pull the zipper down. Without missing a beat, he resumed right where he had left off. His hand could be seen moving beneath the delicate fabric of her knickers visible through her half-opened jeans, Pansy's opened shirt pushed up haphazardly. The dark lavender fabric parted to allow for a view of her pert nipples showing through the sheer, red bra she was wearing. Harry's other hand fumbled a little with the front clasp until it snapped open, but then he found a bud and <em>tugged</em>. The witch's eyes fluttered closed, her upper body arching off Harry's chest with a moan.</p><p>Hermione clamped her thighs together in response to the erotic sight. She was getting wet already, and they hadn't really started yet.</p><p>A myriad of magically-lit candles illuminated the room they'd prepared. While the golden light shone just brightly enough to showcase the delicious details of tonight's activities, it was also warm enough to cast a seductive glow over everything. Two generously-sized beds were located on two sides of the room, each accompanied by chairs and bedside cabinets. One of the beds was empty, the cream-coloured sheets on it still smooth and innocent; the second was occupied by a half-naked, intrigued-looking Blaise, who did not bother to conceal his curiosity. On the remaining sides of the room were two sofas, one long enough to seat four people, while the other was the low, cozy loveseat Hermione and Draco were sitting upon.</p><p>Padma and Luna were undressing Neville, and each other, in the middle of the room, giggling and touching every freed patch of skin as they pushed him back onto a plush chair. Throughout the room were scattered several of these chairs, along with little tables loaded with drinks and snacks. They had all started out at the high table next to the doorway to the room. Now it was almost vacant but for Astoria and George, still in deep conversation, who placed their emptied vials back onto it. George gave the witch a friendly, encouraging smile while he squeezed her bare shoulders. Both had loosened their clothes already.</p><p>Hermione really hoped all their careful setup would pay off and that it invited everyone to communicate and play. Judging from the activities commencing, it had worked.</p><p>A glance down to Draco's lap confirmed Hermione's expectations about just how much he would enjoy watching. "Do you want to join Pansy and Harry? Or anyone else?"</p><p>"Maybe later." Nodding at her glass, he said, "I think leaving out the alcohol was the right decision. Especially with the potion…"</p><p>She placed her glass on the side-table to her left, just next to the vial with the orange-layered remnants of the aforementioned potion, and waited for him to continue. He left the end of the sentence hanging. Meanwhile, the damp cloth of her underwear slid along her labia when she shifted her bum on the sofa. It was a nice kind of friction, but not nearly enough. She'd have to up the ante soon.</p><p>"Do you still have doubts about it? We all knew what we would get into before we agreed to take it." Skimming the inside of his thigh with her fingernails, she added, "And if I have trust in anyone's potion mastery, it's yours."</p><p>Half a decade ago, Draco had begun to work on potions aimed to improve the Wizarding world's sexual relations. As expected, his decision had generated an outraged cry for banishment. Despite the biting articles commenting on their love life—or maybe <em>because</em> of them—his general potion business was flourishing. Particularly, the sales of a little blue potion in a trapezium-shaped flask were doing extraordinarily well.</p><p>Draco kissed her cheek and nudged her hand a little up, closer to his crotch. "I know we tried it ourselves, and I know we both were able to say no to the things we didn't want. I also recall that Luna and George tried it too, probably when they were testing a prototype of that new toy they're working on." He paused to return Hermione's kiss. "But it's not as if we tested it under many different conditions. Its counter-inhibitory properties might react with something." He took a deep breath when she grasped his hard cock through the cloth of his trousers, effectively faltering his train of thought. He swallowed visibly, eyes roaming the room before they returned to her. "However, I can't deny that every single person in this room is so bloody <em>alluring</em>."</p><p>"That's the point but... darling, if you want out, there'll be no questions asked. We all agreed on that, explicitly so. And if there's somebody you don't want to have sex with, everyone will have to accept that," Hermione reminded him softly. One of her hands reached behind his head to pull him in for another languorous kiss. His taste was familiar: a trace of vanilla along with the apple he'd had when they were welcoming their friends. Her hand rested on his cock now, waiting until his smile and confident nod gave her the clear sign to proceed.</p><p>With a twist of her wrist, she flicked his buttons open and pulled his boxer briefs as far down as she could. Heat emanated from the velvety surface of his hard cock. The sensation of it on the skin of her palm was like a caress. She moaned as his hand shoved her skirt up in non-verbal answer and he trailed his fingers along the crease between her opened thighs and her vulva. Lifting the white French lace, he sneaked his digits under her knickers. She knew her arousal was natural; still, the selective carelessness which came with the potion was exhilarating. She didn't mind if her friends saw her like that—on the contrary.</p><p>"I don't want out. I <em>want</em> this," Draco confirmed. "I want to have a good time and I want to explore this fantasy with you." He traced the trimmed triangle of her pubic curls with one finger. "And you're definitely enjoying it," he remarked. His amusement was obvious as he delved between the slick lips of her labia. The single circle the tip of his middle finger made around her clit caused Hermione's whole lower body to tense. Her anticipation rose. Soon he'd touch her <em>there</em>, rubbing the side of it just the right way; soon pleasure would course through her. Her head fell back, mouth open.</p><p>"You are positively drenched. Is that your exhibitionistic streak? Or that everyone is going at it?" Without much preamble, he slid a finger inside. He knew too well what talking like that did to her. His first finger was immediately followed by another, and he pressed the pads onto the elevated patch on the roof of her channel. Her mouth formed a delighted 'O' as the coil behind her navel began to wind up. To Hermione's dismay, he pulled them out again all too soon. "Why don't you show everyone how randy you are?" he whispered against her ear. A wave of goosebumps ran down her spine at his sultry words.</p><p>Tugging her thin, barely opaque skirt and underwear down, he left a faintly chilly track along her thigh where his wet fingers grazed her skin. Hermione couldn't decipher if her pleasant shivers came from the cold or from her overwhelming arousal. Or perhaps he had increased the sensation with a quick spell.</p><p>Her lace knickers were still tangled around one ankle from when she had kicked her shoes off. It didn't matter. Placing her bare heels on the sofa they were sitting on, she tilted her knees outward. Wet as she was, the difference between her own body warmth and the sudden cooler surrounding air had her tensing her inner muscles. She felt a drop of her arousal sliding down the crack of her arse.</p><p>In the meantime, Draco had pushed his trousers and boxer briefs down to his ankles, already slipping his feet out of his shoes and socks. The pearly buttons of Hermione's partially see-through blouse resisted her frantic fingers a little, but she felt it was mandatory to stroke his cock with the other hand all the same. From the hardness of it, she could tell he was enjoying it as much as she was.</p><p>A trembling moan left her throat when he helped her shrug out of her frilly bra, his fingers slipping from her shoulders down to tug on her sensitive peaks and then to move slowly to the apex of her thighs. His dark shirt stood open wide enough to reveal his pink nipples and the few hairs he had on his chest, heaving with his deep breaths.</p><p>To her right, Hermione looked over when she heard Neville gagging on Blaise's cock, though her alarm abated when she saw that his head was free. Neville must have left his earlier liaison with Luna and Padma, she realised. Now, Blaise was on the bed, leaning back on his elbows, eyes fixed on Neville kneeling between his parted legs. He bobbed his head up and down, lips taut around the other man. Intrigued by the sheer size Neville could deepthroat, Hermione imagined being stretched out by Blaise's cock. Maybe she even got a little wetter at that mental image. Draco's fingers were pumping her cunt leisurely as she let her view roam.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pansy had finally discarded her trousers, her legs spread as wide. Harry's fingers slid lazily in and out of her cunt while he nibbled on various parts of Astoria standing next to him. The younger witch bit her lower lip, looking insecure as her eyes flitted from person to person. Her high cheekbones were tinged pink, but she carded her fingers through her husband's unruly black hair as he suckled on her tits. Hermione couldn't begrudge her the reluctance; she had felt unsure, as well, when she and Draco had visited a Muggle swinger club for the first time. For a fleeting second, she wondered if Astoria would bow out early and if Harry's fun would be cut short, too.</p><p>A couple of soothing caresses and whispered words from Harry however, had Astoria kissing him tenderly and letting her hand trail over his skin. Her fingernail grazed over his nipple, her eyes following the way of her own digits until they finally moved from his body to Pansy's. There, they meandered over the dark-haired woman's skin, skimming one breast without touching her nipple at first and then drawing smaller and smaller rings around the taut nub, causing Pansy to arch her back even further. Hermione could positively see how the chary witch squared her shoulders before she bowed down to take Pansy's nipple between her lips. When Astoria finally let her fingers join Harry's in the act of pumping into Pansy's cunt, Hermione heard all three of them moan.</p><p>Their guttural sounds were replaced by Hermione's own as Draco added a third finger to her and scissored them a little. He slid them in and out easily. The lewd noise reached her ear, demonstrating only too well how slick she had become from the scene unfolding in front of her and Draco's touches.</p><p>"That feels good," she hummed and looked back to him from under half-lidded eyes.</p><p>"You're so wet, sweetheart. You're gonna feel so perfect around my cock."</p><p>She moaned. Feeling him thumb around her clit but never flicking over it, she gripped his cock faster. Draco<em> loved</em> teasing her. Two could play that game, though.</p><p>In faux-retaliation, she ran her thumb along the rim of his glans with upwards strokes. His cock twitched with every pass, the hard velvet of it heavy in her hand. In preparation for the evening, he had shaved the skin around its base clean with a spell. It emphasised his generous length and girth, something Hermione couldn't wait to be filled with. Small beads of sweat were forming on his upper lip already. Occasionally, she kneaded his balls and pressed a finger on his perineum, which made him take a shaky breath every time.</p><p>He cupped the back of her head with a deep rumble and tugged it closer to kiss her hungrily. "First dibs, darling. After that, we'll go with the flow, alright?"</p><p>Hermione searched his lust-darkened eyes and nodded once, swiping his pre-come with her thumb from the flushed tip of him. With a mischievous tilt to the corners of her mouth, she licked it off. While she usually didn't mind his taste much, this time she enjoyed a surprising sweetness. She sucked on her thumb again, more thoroughly this time. "New potion you're working on?"</p><p>In answer, he crooked his fingers and pressed, hard, on the sensitive spot inside her. The light vibration from his fingertip made her yelp at the same time his tongue dove into her mouth. "Hmmm," he agreed, smacking his lips as he tasted himself. "Vanilla. Still needs a bit of work. And more flavours to choose from."</p><p>"Yesss," she panted, but in this very moment, even she wasn't sure if she meant him fingerfucking her harder, or his choice of flavour. Her thoughts cleared a little once he'd extracted his digits. "Nothing is exactly <em>vanilla</em> about you, Draco."</p><p>He huffed a laugh. "Probably not."</p><p>Tugging on her wrist to manoeuver her onto his lap, he slid her down onto his length. As he moved her slowly, a choked noise puffed against the damp skin of her shoulder blade as he leaned his forehead onto it. Hermione loved the tantalising stretch, and she wiggled a tiny bit to adjust to it.</p><p>Her slow exhale was wobbly. "It feels so good when you fill me to the brim, Draco."</p><p>"And you take me so well." He swept her hair over her shoulder and planted a line of kisses from one to the other. "You're perfect."</p><p>With contentment sweeping through her, she spread her thighs wide as she placed them outside of his on the floor. It left her open and exposed. In this position, her back was against Draco's toned chest. His arms wrapped around her for a few moments, lean but well-defined muscles shifting beneath her stroking palms. Hermione snuggled into his hug, smiling to herself at the recollection of his arms lifting her for the occasional romp against a bookshelf. Her wandering mind was put back to the present when his hands gripped her breasts.</p><p>"Oh fu—" she exclaimed when she felt him pinch and twist both of her nipples.</p><p>"Move," he encouraged. "Let them all see how good you look on my cock."</p><p>Another surge of need beelined to her core. His hands secured on her hips now, Draco guided the roll of her hips. She panted out a heavy groan with every drop down onto him. The friction of his cock over all the right spots left her desperate for release. She <em>loved</em> it.</p><p>From half-lidded eyes, she saw Luna and George approaching them. The blonde witch was clutching and lightly pumping George's cock in her hand.</p><p>"You two look inviting. May we join?" she asked with a smile.</p><p>Hermione and Draco were both a bit breathless already when they replied in unison, "Yes."</p><p>George ran his hand down along Luna's back before he plopped down onto the sofa next to Draco. His erection bobbed with the movement. Luna began pinching Hermione's nipples while they shared an open-mouthed kiss; she tasted like the cherries she'd had shortly after she and George had arrived together, sweet with a hint of zing. Their tongues touched playfully, an additional thrill to the push and pull of Draco inside of her.</p><p>"Thought you <em>both</em> wanted to participate," Draco ground out from between his teeth as Hermione dropped down onto him with emphasis. She undulated her hips, his exhale warm on her sweaty neck. His cock changed its angle like that, pressing not only on her g-spot but also hitting others of her sensitive spots.</p><p>"Of course. George is still warming up. Aren't you, dear?" Luna said before she grabbed a cushion and put it under her knees in front of her. The hot course of Luna's tongue making its way from her calves to her centre made Hermione shiver in the most exhilarating way. Whenever Luna nipped the sensitive skin of her inner thighs, Hermione felt herself clenching around Draco. The ache between her legs intensified.</p><p>Tugging on his length, George admitted, "I thought this would turn into a comparison of dick sizes, to be quite frank."</p><p>Draco half-snorted, half-moaned as Luna licked a stripe from the base of his cock up to Hermione's clit. "We still can do that, if you insist." Hermione tensed her inner muscles around him and he guided her ensuing faster tempo with one hand on her hip, the other one kneading her tits. "But—" He paused to kiss her shoulder, lingering on it for a moment. "—you'll understand that I have to make my girlfriend come first."</p><p>After all the years they had been together, Hermione's heart still made those little somersaults at Draco's undivided devotion. She turned her head and pressed a clumsy kiss onto his mouth.</p><p>Her mental swooning was cut short when Luna expertly dragged the tip of her tongue along Hermione's inner labia, sending little jolts of pleasure to her core. She imagined the feeling Draco must be experiencing, dick sliding along the walls of her slick, smooth cunt, and Luna's tongue at the same time. The feather-light touch of Luna's fingertips along the insides of Hermione's thighs tickled a little. Her leg twitched. But then she felt Luna's tongue flicking over her clit and she moaned loudly in response to the titillating sensation.</p><p>Opening her eyes when she sensed the blonde witch's face bump against her, Hermione saw that Luna must have signalled George to join. His fingers in a fast grip on Luna's hips, he thrust into her with slow determination, giving her time to anticipate the movements. Hermione threaded the fingers of one hand through Luna's hair, while the other safely locked onto the armrest of the sofa. She closed her eyes again with a happy smile.</p><p>"A pity you can't see them properly, Malfoy. Luna's bum wiggles with every fuck. Simply beautiful. And Hermione's all flushed and—"</p><p>"Luna's tits graze my knees, Weasley," Draco panted out. "And Hermione, my pretty, clever Hermione—" He paused to grab both of her breasts from behind and squeeze the nipples hard, "—'s fluttering around my cock already. Fuuu..." The long-drawn vowel could only mean that Luna had started to finger his anus, maybe even inserted a second finger. She must have cast a silent lubrication spell, the ingenious witch.</p><p>"Stop it, Draco. Got better things to do than listen to your bragging," George bit out, speeding up his movements.</p><p>Hermione felt the telltale tingle in her womb building momentum. With Luna's knowing suckling and Draco now pounding into her from below while he treated her nipples to thrilling pleasure-pain, she opened her eyes to watch George's cock move in and out of Luna's cunt. His length shone with her wetness.</p><p>Along with Draco's cock, the blonde witch snaked a finger in and massaged Hermione's g-spot. In that instant, Hermione cried out. The coil snapped and for a few moments, she stopped thinking. White spots floated through her unseeing vision as she clenched intermittently around both her boyfriend's length and Luna's index finger.</p><p>Draco thrust deep into her once more, then he stilled. His whole-body twitch and his guttural groan signalled his own climax. Luna kept the pressure up inside of Hermione, elongating her orgasm through the wiggling of her fingertip. Hermione's entire lower body spasmed helplessly. Eventually, the other witch pulled her finger out and licked it clean from Hermione and Draco's combined essences.</p><p>"Fuck," George groaned. "<em>Fuck</em>." He slammed into Luna a couple of more times, making her gasp into Hermione's thigh. With a deep-throated sound, he pulled out and painted her arse in his come.</p><p>Luna's face was gleeful and shiny with Hermione's slickness when she squeezed two fingers back into Hermione's cunt and then offered them to Draco. Hermione's vaginal muscles tensed up again when Luna's fingertips ran over her g-spot. She was so sensitive, and despite the softening of Draco's cock, she still felt nice and full. Hermione's stomach made a dulcet swoop at the lewd noises Draco made next to her ear. She could hear how much he enjoyed cleaning those fingers. It sent a fresh wave of arousal through her body already.</p><p>Luna got up with surprising agility and kissed first Hermione, then George, who grabbed her tits and began playing with her nipples. The tautness of them pronounced their rather large size and Hermione caught herself swallowing when she imagined running the tip of her tongue around the big, light pink areola in a Fibonacci spiral. She resolved to finally get a proper taste this evening, but resorted to tracking Luna's next movements for the moment.</p><p>Dislodging from her husband, Luna allowed him to cast a cleaning charm on both of her hands, though she denied letting him clean the mess on her arse. A moment later, she was heading over towards Pansy, Harry, and Neville, who had joined them.</p><p>Neville seemed to have integrated himself seamlessly. He kneeled behind Harry, slowly inching his length into the other wizard. Harry's eyes closed as he slowed down between Pansy's thighs for a moment; Astoria, on the other hand had moved on. Now she was stroking Blaise's cock where they were both draped over the other couch. The wizard petted her head, tucking her hair behind first one ear, then the other.</p><p>Hermione gazed out over her assembled friends, and she raised her eyebrows. This was all really unexpected, but not unpleasantly so. In the years since they had all left school, Pansy had managed to snatch up Neville— though the Slytherin side of their circle of friends would claim the contrary. Be it as it may, their marriage seemed to be one of the happiest among her friends. It contrasted Pansy's friendship with Harry, which was strained most of the time.</p><p><em>Maybe they'll literally fuck it out tonight</em>, Hermione thought.</p><p>Luna whispered something to Neville, who widened his kneeling stance in confirmation of her request. Pulling his lower lip between her teeth, Luna pressed her mouth onto his roughly. Her hand skirted from Neville's shoulder over his side and, lastly, cupped one of his arse cheeks. She continued to knead it while making herself comfortable on the edge of the bed. After a well-aimed smack that made Neville yelp out, she reached between his thighs and fondled his bollocks from behind. Hermione saw his knees quiver as he fucked into Harry harder.</p><p>The whole image was textbook debauchery. Hermione felt a tinge of envy and, at the same time, a new level of horniness building up.</p><p>Pansy was sprawled out on the bed. She had her calves on Harry's shoulders and looked almost folded in half. Harry was propped up on his hands on either sides of her shoulders. He pistoned in and out of her in a frenzy, but every second thrust was enforced by a more powerful one from behind. Neville's hand stroked Harry's back, eyes fixed on where his cock disappeared into Harry's arse. Every hard rocking of Neville's hips made both Pansy and Harry moan. Pansy's face was positively blissed-out.</p><p>Hermione's legs shook a little when she got up and let Draco's flaccid dick slip out with a soft squelch. She knew he'd be ready to go again in a few minutes, if the potion's regenerative effects were working as before. Turning around to kiss him squarely on his mouth, she could feel their essences trickling out already. She didn't mind. Indeed, she couldn't wait for somebody else to fuck them deeper into her.</p><p>Maybe Blaise would be amenable? She'd seen his girth earlier and by the enthusiasm with which he ate Astoria out now, he probably wouldn't mind stretching her pussy a little, too. In fact, he could slam his hips into her while she fucked her fingers into Harry's wife.</p><p>Or maybe she should take a seat first and watch Pansy, Harry, and Neville? Luna still alternated between grazing Neville's bollocks with her blunt nails and rolling them between her fingers. From time to time, she slipped her index into his arse, eliciting shaky breaths from him.</p><p>Alternately, Hermione could charm her wand to vibrate and push it deep into herself. One hand could fuck the vinewood into her cunt, while the other would rub her clit. <em>Everybody</em> would be able to see how she got herself off.</p><p>She didn't bother disguising the low groan forming inside her chest. More wetness pooled between her thighs.</p><p>Caught in her vivid daydream, she had missed the little signs of her friends' orgasms. Only when Harry shouted into Pansy's neck, did Hermione again pay more attention. Her best friend could barely keep himself up above Pansy. She got louder and louder, each of Neville's slaps against Harry driving the latter into her and rubbing his pelvis against her cunt. The witch spasmed with a noisy "Ooooh," making Harry tremble in what Hermione assumed was the oversensitivity of his cock. Neville drove home a couple of more times before he stopped almost all movement as he came. The little jerks of his contracted gluteal muscles were in sync with Luna's soft squeezes of his bollocks.</p><p>Hermione sighed at the missed chance. She was glad that her friends were having fun, but she also knew that she had missed an opportunity to come <em>so</em> hard whilst observing them.</p><p>The four slowly untangled. Neville wiped the back of his hand across his face as he gently pulled out of Harry. He didn't look too tired, just sweaty. Instead of simply falling onto the mattress with the others, he kissed Luna's forehead and let her murmur a cleaning charm. He did kiss Harry on the mouth though, as soon as he was standing upright. Harry wasn't that steady yet, but his tongue dove into the other wizard's mouth, making Neville gasp when he pinched his buttocks.</p><p>Hermione's eyes flickered to Pansy. The witch was stretched out appreciatively, lifting her foot to trail her toes over Harry's bum. Her dark pink nipples stood out from her small breasts. Pansy still had her legs splayed open, revealing her tuft of dark hair along with different kinds of slickness smeared over her labia. It was already dripping out of her. The sight made Hermione's pulse increase. A moment later, Hermione's eyes met those of the other witch, whose gaze met Hermione's eager glance almost with a challenge.</p><p>For a split second, Hermione imagined the taste on her tongue.</p><p>She dislodged her stare from Pansy's. While she wasn't averse to the obvious provocation, she had wanted to join Astoria and Blaise in the first place. Taking a slug of water from the glass she'd had earlier, she turned to ask Draco, "Who's next for you?"</p><p>Draco stretched his arms over his head while he took a languorous look around. "I think I'm going to watch for a bit and maybe approach Padma in a little while. Or eat something." Dragging one hand down his chest, he closed his fist around his already stiffening erection. The potion really worked well on stamina and recovery.</p><p>Hermione's eyes tracked Draco's glances.</p><p>Since his earlier romp, Neville had moved on to talk to George, who sat with his legs apart on one of the two generous beds. Padma was sucking on his cock. Her bobs were leisurely, alternating between kitten licks across the head, and deep swallows. She didn't stop as Neville asked something, fully concentrated on moving her head up and down in sync with her own fingers as they vanished into her cunt. Even from this angle, Hermione could see how wet they were. She knew she wouldn't mind hearing the accompanying sounds from nearer, either, but she stayed in place to watch.</p><p>George shook his head, which Neville acquitted with a polite smile, but then George pointed at Luna. The witch had lain down on her stomach next to her sitting husband, and was stroking Padma's head and shoulders while she whispered something. Hermione thought they were probably words of encouragement, judging by the renewed vigour with which Padma blew George.</p><p>Luna agreed to Neville's subsequent request by lifting her lower body onto her knees, arse high up and swaying a little. Neville climbed onto the bed behind her, licking his lips as he moved them in a wandless spell. His hands spread her pale cheeks, thumbs running along the crack and pressing one of them into her arse. After he had stretched her enough, he exchanged it with first two, then three fingers, slowly pumping into Luna. She smiled serenely as Neville lined his jutting cock up and worked it into her, his lips pinched in concentration as he slowly rocked back and forth. Hermione saw how he inched further into her with every roll of his hips.</p><p>By then, George had righted himself. He pulled out of Padma's mouth and nudged her back. On her knees, she tilted her head up, her back in a soft arc. Her heavy breasts were pushed out, the nipples protruding from the dusty amber of her areola. The tip of his tongue licking the corner of his mouth, George jerked only once on his cock. He groaned loudly and came all over Padma's face and hair. It dripped down her chin. Squinting up at George, she gave him a pert grin and licked her lips off.</p><p>Hermione observed Draco from the corner of her eye. His hand got slower, but the squeezes on his cock were more forceful now. When he turned his focus to the next scene, Hermione made sure to follow his look again.</p><p>Pansy and Harry seemed to be taking full advantage of regenerative properties of the potion. Both had swapped the bed for the shag-pile rug in front of the other sofa and she was riding his cock already. His hands dug into her arse, hard enough to leave fingerprints on her pale skin. Teeth buried into his lower lip and sweat lining his forehead, he snapped his hips up everytime she dropped down. Their fucking was rough enough to resound throughout the room.</p><p>Hermione turned back to Draco, whose fist was moving up and down his cock in quick succession. His focus kept wandering from scene to scene, tongue flitting out to moisten his lips. She could tell how much he enjoyed the display by his ragged breathing in concert with each squeeze around his length. Now that she was sure he was enthralled, she felt content to seek her own pleasure. She kissed him again, wiping the little droplets of perspiration from his temples with a tender gesture.</p><p>"I'm going to see if Astoria and Blaise are interested," she murmured. Grabbing a couple of apple slices from a plate of fruit, she sauntered over to Astoria. The other witch's back was arched off the bed they'd moved to, and her hips were jerking. She was very well on her way to orgasm.</p><p>"She's almost there, Blaise. Beautiful," Hermione spurred the dark-skinned wizard on as she put the plate on a low side table. It earned her a quick flicker of his eyes to her. Scrutinizing Hermione, he slowly dragged the tip of his tongue over Astoria's cunt. His grin was positively smug when a soft moan escaped not only the younger witch's throat, but also Hermione's. She squeezed her legs together, trying to create friction by contracting her inner muscles and shifting on her feet a little.</p><p>It didn't work very well, though. Hermione skimmed her hand over her peaked nipple and supple stomach, digging her teeth into her lower lips as she reached the top of her slit. She breathed out a moan when the tip of her middle finger slipped over her clit. It was swollen with how sensitive and wanting it was. Reaching down a little further, she squeezed it softly between two fingers and widened her stance to get better access.</p><p>Groaning, Astoria opened her eyes. Her gaze was a little unfocused, but she seemed to be concentrating on Hermione's finger moving back and forth. Hermione pushed her digits inside, upper body bent a little forward to get a deeper reach, and looked at Blaise. The man's face was buried in Astoria's cunt, wiggling his whole head in alternation with small nod-like movements. The fact that Blaise knew what he was doing was extremely alluring. Hermione fingerfucked herself quickly, but she was not quite able to match his speed. When she pulled her fingers out to rub on her clit again, she swore she was just shy of dripping.</p><p>Astoria continued to observe Hermione until her eyelids fluttered shut. Her moans increased in volume, neck and cleavage flushed an appealing crimson as she finally shrieked. Blaise's palm was a sure grip on her hips when her thighs tensed and shook with her climax. He prolonged the pleasure as he stiffened the tip of his tongue and pressed it onto Astoria's clit with slow, determined strokes until she scrambled back with a yelp. Pulling back with a proud mien, he wiped his hand over his mouth.</p><p>Only now, Hermione saw that he'd shoved his wand into her cunt. It even looked like he'd put an invisible enlargement charm on it, stretched as Astoria's core was. The sight was so engaging that Hermione increased the pressure on her clit at once, moving two fingertips over it in minute circles.</p><p>She licked her bottom lip as she zoned her attention in on the wand. She <em>needed</em> to learn that spell. More heat rushed into the bottom of her belly as Blaise pulled the wand-cum-dildo slowly out. Astoria whined, her pussy ruddy and glistening, covered in the white-ish moisture of her come. Her walls seemed to cling to the transparent enlargement of the wood. Blaise's lips turned up at the corners and he licked her one last time. His tongue moved from the bottom of her slit to the strip of dark hair above her clit as he ran his free hand up and down her thighs. Astoria's hips jerked again when he reached the top.</p><p>Hermione was so wet by now that it added to the previous slickness on the insides of her thighs. Staring at the boneless witch in her orgasmic aftermath, she tremulously asked, "Mind if I join you?"</p><p> </p>
