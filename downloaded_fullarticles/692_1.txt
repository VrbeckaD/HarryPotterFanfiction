    <p>
  <span>Albus Potter let his trunk slam on the platform tiled floor with a satisfying thud, he huffed as he collapsed onto it. He set down the unopened Chocolate Frog box on his right without a thought to it. He let robe cascaded down the side of his trunk onto the floor, without care of it being stepped on or getting dirty by the marked floor. Instead, he unbuckled his satchel and pulled out a quill and a small vial of standard black quill ink. He spun the cap off and dipped the tip of his feather into the endless pool of black, before rolling out his parchment onto his thigh and beginning to write.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Dear," he paused, taking a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew for a fact this was useless. He didn't care what his parents or Dr. Palmer thought, or whatever his brother said. Letters to himself were the worst thing Dr. Palmer had ever suggest. He was kind of at a loss at how letters to </span>
  <em>
    <span>himself </span>
  </em>
  <span>were supposed to get him talking to </span>
  <em>
    <span>other people. </span>
  </em>
  <span>It made absolutely zero sense and was a complete and utter waste of time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And still, he did it. Because god forbid his anxiety let him disappoint Dr. Palmer, because would if she freaked out? Or told his parents? In which his brother would find out and would if James told his friends? And then they told the whole of Hogwarts. Well, Albus would be the laughing stock of the school.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so, he had to do them, because well- at this point he was a little unsure as of why- but he had to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Dear Albus Potter," He muttered, making sure to use proper punctuation because- well just because he was a perfectionist like that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sucked in a breath, scratching his cheek as he glanced around the station again. His parents were still nowhere to be seen, neither were his aunt and uncle. He knew the traffic was probably crazy and judging by the jumbled and quite honestly messy letter he had received from his father, they were probably running late and left too late and now they were probably stuck in traffic. So, he would be there for a while. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Albus knew, oh he knew, that his mother and father would immediately ask if he had written his letter for Dr. Palmer's tomorrow and he hadn't. He had procrastinated writing it till the very last minute and now he was writing it while waiting on the platform for his parents, because he was awful like that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dipped his quill one more time in the bottled ink, and was just about to pull it out when someone called; </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey, Potter!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus glanced up a little surprised at being acknowledged. He glanced around in confusion for a moment, only for his brother to walk right passed him over to Tiberius Flint. James didn't even blink an eye in Albus's direction as he stalked passed, with an easy grin on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus turned away, unsure why he even thought for a moment someone was calling his name. People in his school didn't call him "Potter" or "Albus", they called him "move out of the way!" or "aren't you that guy?" and more famously, "you talk? I honestly thought you were mute." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus was not mute, he just didn't talk to people he didn't like. Which pretty much summed up everyone at Hogwarts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He capped his ink again and begun to write without thought, while he mumbled the words he wrote, </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So turns out this wasn't your day or month or even year." Albus could feel his throat close slightly, and a lump growing in it. He wasn't going to start crying in the middle of Platform nine and three quarters, which was buzzing with students and parents alike. He wasn't going to shed a tear no matter how large the ache in his chest grew.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And why would it be? It was just the same as the past three years and the next three will be the same. You will continue to be a quiet weirdo, the Potter boy everyone doesn't like or notice. You'll continue to lie to your parents about it until you physically cannot. But God forbid they ask to meet your friend 'John', who was just a name you pulled out of your asre when your mum asked if you made any friends the summer of first year." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the complete truth. Because if there was one thing Albus hated more than the constant inch called anxiety that rang under his skin, it was disappointing his parents. His mum and dad tried so hard to give him everything, to make him feel not so alone, but it was hard not to when he had to spend months away from home in a place where he had no friends, spent all his time quietly faded into the back of his classrooms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so he lied, had been since first year that he had this friend, "John", and yeah John was cool. John was this awesome guy who could ace tests with his eyes closed and could probably do spells in his sleep, he was a teachers favourite and was in Slytherin. He and Albus shared a room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>John was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> cool, he was unreal. Literally.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And I know, I know. I shouldn't complain. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Because you could have it worse, Albus Potter</span>
  </em>
  <span>. You could be struggling with money or have both parents dead or have the weight of a prophecy on her shoulder. But still. I don't want the whole world to notice me, not like my dad. But if I disappeared tomorrow, would anyone notice at all?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He swallowed, sniffing loudly, as he finished off the letter. He hardly noticed in all his turmoil someone had placed their suitcase down on its side, the same as Albus's, and sat down next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Your best and most dearest friend..." He sighed, "Me." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you going to eat that?" A voice suddenly asked, practically shouted at full volume, to his right. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus jerked suddenly, he whipped around to look at the person and held his letter close to his chest as not to let another soul read it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Laughing stock,</span>
  </em>
  <span> a voice whispered as a remainder in his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The person sitting in front of him was a boy. In fact a boy probably his age. He was in Slytherin too. He was quite one tone- pale pasty skin, platinum blond hair that swept across his forehead, his pupils were silver ringed, looking like pools of mercury in the station light. His pale pointed face was set in an almost bored look. He wore the same uniform as Albus, the same black robes, and green Slytherin tie and vest jumper. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus stared at the boy, but found the other male wasn't staring at him. Instead at the unopened chocolate frog box, he had placed next to him when he sat down. The one he had bought on the train and decided not to eat, because he had a queasy stomach after a few Hufflepuff girls walked by laughing softly. And Albus's mind decided that it was probably from that one time in first year when he tripped over his robe and face planted in a practically empty corridor. And yep that was definitely it. And all he could think for the rest of the train ride was, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I fucking hate myself.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus blinked, before shaking his head and realizing the boy didn't even see, silver eyes still glued to the box.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Uh, no. Here." He picked it up and held it out across the small space between him and the boy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy looked overjoyed and let out a little 'ah' of delight as he took it. He didn't once look at Albus as he tore open the packet and immediately begun to shove his face with chocolate. It was messy and quite animalistic to watch and Albus was immediately reminded of his cousin Fred when he and James had races to finish their dinner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus turned away, glancing only once at the male before seeing he was too occupied by the chocolate to even look his way and then quickly rolling up his letter and stashing it into his pocket with his quill and ink. He played with the brooch at the neckline of his robes absently, glancing around the platform to search for his parents once again. There were a lot of students without parents wandering around and Albus guessed that the roads were closed nearby. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you want the card?" The boy suddenly asked, and Albus turned back around, watching him lick the chocolate off his fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus scratched his eyebrow, as he thought of the most nonchalant way to respond, </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not if it's anyone I know," he replied after a moment, the answer being totally honest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He refused to have more than one card of anyone he saw more than twice a week on average. That meant only one card for all of his family, one card for his dad and mum, one for his uncle Ron, George, and aunt Hermione. One for both Grandparents. No more and definitely no less.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How could you know any of them they're famous witches and-" The boy finally turned to look at Albus and immediately stopped mid-sentence, his mouth dropping open in surprise as he met Albus's eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh Dumbledore, you're Albus Potter." He said suddenly and Albus blinked staring at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Surely, this boy- this weirdly loud and blunt and chocolate eating boy- had not just noticed that Albus was </span>
  <em>
    <span>well</span>
  </em>
  <span> Albus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Uh, yeah." Albus replied awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck, "so, if you want to run and get away I won't even judge." He added honestly, and he wouldn't. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why would I run away?" The boy asked, confused and curious by the statement, his head tilted to the side slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well I mean usually there's a hound of Gryffindor blokes that would love to just make fun of me and anyone in a radiates of five feet." Albus droned, gesturing with his hand as he spoke and the one-tone boy stared at unmoving and unblinking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Albus finished, the boy shrugged, wiping his still chocolate-covered fingers down his dress pants and leaving grease streaks behind. Albus cringed inwardly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, they're going to make fun of me anyway, whether I'm with you or not. So, I don't see why I don't have a good conversation before it happens." He shrugged again as he spoke, playing with the collector's card and watching the person move back and forth as the station lights hit it from different angles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why would they make fun of you?" Albus questioned, honestly a little curious at the answer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy titled his head, staring at Albus with a lopsided deadpan look,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, I'm small, scrawny, practically white-haired," he tugged at a lock of his platinum hair, "and super pale. Also, I'm a huge nerd. You take your pick" The boy quipped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus couldn't help but smile just a little at the sarcastic remark and the boy gave him a smile that was slightly amused. Albus brushed his hair from his face as he wanted to say something in response, but couldn't find the words. The moment was here and it was slipping through his fingers. He swallowed, opening his mouth, before closing it again. He took a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Come on, Albus. This is your one chance. Your one chance to turn things around.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a beat. And something passed through Albus, something he had never felt before in all the time he spent quaking in social situations. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bravery.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"I didn't catch your name." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He seized the moment with both hands and gripped it tight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy looked up from the card and smiled almost bittersweetly, like he knew this wasn't going to end pretty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Scorpius. Scorpius Malfoy." He answered and Albus paused, his eyes widening. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Malfoy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Like Draco Malfoy. This was- This had to be Draco's one and only son. It made sense, his looks; platinum blond hair, pointed face, pressed attire. It made total sense. It really did. Even his attitude. Because it was the complete opposite of Draco Malfoy at Scorpius's own age. That's what Albus's dad had said when he recounted meeting Draco's son the one and only time, he said he was exactly what Draco wasn't. And he had said that with a bit of warmth. He said it in a way that he was proud of Draco for taking the chance Harry had given him by vouching for him in court when they trialed for him to go to Azkaban at the end of the</span>
  <em>
    <span> Second Wizarding World.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Scorpius looked disheartened, his upbeat and witty character gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> get if you want to run and get away." He replied, glancing lopsidedly at Albus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus blinked. It was another moment. Which was so odd. Why suddenly he was having all these social interacts that had such strange choices. That caused him to make such strange decisions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus stared at Scorpius carefully only for a moment, before shaking his head and finally replying,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why would I run away?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Scorpius paused, looking confused, before smiling in that amused way. He looked ready to say something, but was suddenly cut off when someone slapped a hand down on Albus's shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Albus" his brother said, as Albus jumped, glancing up at James, who as standing there looking mildly annoyed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Dad and mum are waiting, let's go." He nodded his head behind him, over to where Lily was standing with her and James trunk, a look of annoyance on her bright features. Their parents must have pulled up outside and were planning to make it home quickly without all the pleasantries of standing in the station and hugging it out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Right." Albus answered, standing and picking up his case. Setting it back on its four wheels.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James huffed as he walked back over to Lily. Albus followed, wheeling his case only a few steps before turning back. He found Scorpius watching him. He sucked in a breath, waving awkwardly,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bye." he said, and Scorpius smiled,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"bye," he waved back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus hesitated for only a moment longer, before turning back around and running after his brother and sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Albus who was that guy you were talking to?" James questioned, when he, Albus were sitting in the middle two seats of the car, Lily was in the very back with three whole seats to herself. Albus glanced away from the window and at London as it blurred passed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus didn't blame James, but the guy could be thick sometimes. I mean Albus was socially inept, but James was just socially dumb sometimes. Like how it was just a given to not mention Albus having a conversation in front of both their mum and dad. Because they would always, </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span> make it bigger than it was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What guy?" His father suddenly asked, looking through his rearview mirror, his green eyes watching his youngest son carefully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus shrugged, not wanting to get into the details. Not wanting to have to explain breath by breath what had happened in the station.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nothing, there was no guy." Albus waved his hand dismissively, turning back to stare out the window, as he could hear his sister shifting and sitting up behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But didn't James just say there was a guy?" She questioned, looking confused, her auburn brows furrowed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus puffed out his cheeks, trying hard not to lose his temper at his nagging family. He made a wide gesture with his hands,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, there was a guy but-" He sighed, "He was just asking for... directions."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lie came easy, and he hoped it would be enough to keep his family at bay for the moment. But that seemed fruitless when James suddenly said; </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But you guys were talking and he was sitting." He made a face of confusion, as he stared at Albus, who let out an annoyed breath, pinching the bridge of his nose with his two fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He was just- Sure, we talked. But it was- He's not my friend, okay?" Albus looked at James with a stand-offish look, "Are you happy now?" He asked sounding passive-aggressive and looking at James expectantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James put his hands up in a sign of surrender, his eyes wide, as he shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Relax, I was just curious." He answered, but Albus hardly heard. He was turned back to the window and instead of responding, simply watched the city give way to the countryside. He relaxed at the thought that he was almost home and he could lock himself in his room in no time.</span>
