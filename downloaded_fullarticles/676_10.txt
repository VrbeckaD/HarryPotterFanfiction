    <p>Percy Jackson was walking along the sidewalks of New York City, hands in pockets and humming gently in the night. He passed an alley and heard a sharp CRACK, followed by three more. He instantly tensed and snatched his pen, Anaklusmos, out of his pocket while backing up to the alley. He could hear the sounds of a fight, but instead of hearing weapons clashing together all he heard were shouts of strange words followed by a sort of fizzing, zapping sound.</p><p>He rounded the corner and quickly assessed the scene. There were three men with masks and robes fighting a teen with a shock of white-blonde hair. The teen was fighting desperately, trying to deflect or dodge the streaks of light shooting at him from the masked men. As Percy was watching, a dark blue spell hit the side of the teen, who started to crumple but fought to stay on his feet. </p><p>Percy rushed in, following his gut feeling and charging the nearest man. The men, who were advancing slowly to the blonde, were wholly unprepared for an attack from behind. Percy reached the closest one, uncapped Anaklusmos, and smashed it's hilt into the man's temple. The man crumpled to the floor, unconscious, and the other two quickly backed up and readied their - sticks?</p><p>Percy backed up as well, warily watching them and trying to reach the blonde teen who had, by now, fallen on his side and seemed to be bleeding profusely. One of the masked men jumped at his distraction and jerked his hand in a specific motion while shouting, "Incendio!" Percy dodged to the left, past the fiery red blast that seared past him into the brick and towards the man, readying his sword. He heard a rustling behind him a spared a split second to look over.</p><p>The blonde teen had risen on shaky legs and launched a blast at the other man - who was completely focused on Percy - with the shout, "Stupefy!" The man fell down and didn't get up. </p><p>Percy tried to get under the guard of the last man to no avail, there were too many blasts coming from him. Percy raised his hand towards the nearest fire hydrant, which exploded and water came pouring out towards the man.</p><p>He stood stock still for a second before the water smashed into him. His mask came off, revealing an aristocratic face with long blonde hair and gray eyes. Percy advanced, but before he came within a few yards the man disappeared with the same CRACK that had announced his arrival.</p><p>Percy ran towards the teen, trying to assess the damage. He was still conscious, and when Percy came within range he grabbed his leg and all Percy heard was another loud CRACK before everything went black. He felt squished, as if travelling through a rubber tube that kept squeezing him.</p><p>When the sensation ended Percy opened his eyes and found himself in a forest, definately not New York. The teen was still grabbing his leg, but when Percy looked at him he just gasped out, " Healing Potion, bag" before passing out.</p><p>With the state of the teen Percy felt he had no choice but to help him. He had questions, many questions, but those could be answered later when a life wasn't on the line. There was a pouch clutched in the teens hands that was the only container in sight and so Percy pried it out of the blonde's grip and opened it up. The bag held more contents than possible, but it was rather easy to find a red-liquid filled bottle labled, "Healing Potion" in neat script. </p><p>Percy administered it to the teen, then settled down to wait. He would get some answers when the teen awoke.</p><p>
