    <p align="left">Regan was sitting underneath a tree on the grounds of Hogwarts, she was leaning against the tree as she read from her book that looked like it had been read through a lot. Her curly black hair was pulled back in a messy bun as her blue eyes scanned the page in front of her.</p><p align="left">She wore the uniform of Slytherin, Regan wore her uniform proper. There was no wrinkle or crease unlike her older brother's uniform. He looked like he slept in his uniform, she wouldn't be surprised at all if he really did.</p><p align="left">
  <strong>
    <em>"Three brothers, travelling along a lonely, winding road at twilight reached a deep treacherous river where anyone who attempted to swim or wade would drown. Learned in the magical arts, the brothers conjured a bridge with their wands and proceed to cross." </em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="left">She read the story out loud.</p><p>The younger Potter wasn't alone underneath her regular tree, sitting next to her was Remus Lupin who was resting his head on her shoulder with his eyes closed as he let her voice calm him. He liked her voice, it was soft and soothing.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Halfway though the bridge, a hooded figure stood before them. The figure was the enraged spirit of Death, cheated of his due. Death cunningly pretended to congratulate them and proceeds to award them with gifts of their own choosing."</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>Regan flipped to the next page as she continued to read, not looking at Remus as she did so. </p><p>This was a regular thing for them, during a break they'd met up under this tree and she'd read to him. When he wasn't with her brother and the rest of his friends and when she wasn't with her own friends.</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>"The eldest brother, a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence. Death granted his wish by fashioning the Elder Wand from a branch of a nearby elder tree standing on the banks of the river. The second brother, an arrogant man, chose to further humiliate death, and asked for the power to recall the deceased from the grave. Death granted his wish by crafting the Resurrection Stone from a stone picked from the riverbank. The third and youngest brother, who was the most humble and wise, did not trust Death and asked for something to enable him to go forth without Death being able to follow. A reluctant Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Invisibility Cloak."</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>She felt Remus move but only to get more comfortable against her, he was now facing her with his eyes still closed.</p><p>If her brother or even Sirius were here they would be teasing them, James knew of her crush on Remus but Regan had 'threatened' to tell Lily about his crush on her. Regan was friends with the red headed girl.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>"The eldest brother traveled to a village where a wizard whom he had quarreled lived. He sought out a duel and fought the wizard using the wand, instantly killing the latter. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the eldest brother walked to an inn not far from the dueling site and spent the night there. Taken by his conscience and lust of the Elder Wand's power, the eldest brother boasted of this wand gifted by Death and his own invincibility. That very night, Death transfigured to a murderous wizard. The unknown murderous wizard crept to the inn as the eldest brother slept, drunk from wine. The wizard slit the oldest brother’s throat for good measure and stole the wand. That was when Death took the first brother."</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>Regan turned another page as she continued to read, she didn't know why Remus kept insisting that she read this story to him. She had read this story numerous times to him before and she always kept expecting him tell her to read another story by Beedle the Bard.</p><p>But he never did.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>"The second brother returned to his home where he lived alone. Turning the stone thrice in his hand the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him, much to his delight. Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, committed suicide by hanging from his house' balcony so as truly to join her. That was when Death took the second brother for his own."</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>Remus listened to the sound of a page being turned as the younger Potter turned the next page, it wasn't just her voice that drew him to her. There was also her personality and scent, the latter he would never say out loud because he knew how protective James could be with his sister.</p><p>Though he knew that James didn't understand why he didn't seemed bothered by her personality.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>"Death searched for the youngest brother as years passed but never succeeded. It was only when the third brother reached a great age, he took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. Greeting Death as an old friend, they departed this life as equals."</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>Regan closed the book and lowered it onto her lap as she closed her eyes as well, she sighed heavily as she rested her head on top of his. This was something they did after their reading sessions.</p>
