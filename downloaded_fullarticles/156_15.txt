    <p> </p><hr/><p>The office of Head Auror Potter seemed to be a revolving door of neverending problems. It had been a long time since he'd been able to really fling himself into fieldwork, instead of sitting behind a desk and solving the less than savoury problems of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.</p><p>It helped that it made his wife happy, but even so.</p><p>Harry eyed the evergrowing list of files on his desk, sighing and grabbing hold of the entire stack. He flipped them upside down, the first trick that he'd been taught when it came to running the department. The files that they didn't want him to see, and usually the most important ones, were usually nestled at the bottom. He flicked the file open, his eyes widening at the complaint that awaited him.</p><p>"Maria!" He shouted. Harry pushed away from his desk, the bottom of the rolling share squeaking as he did so. "Maria!" He hollered once more, stomping across his office and throwing the door open.</p><p>His secretary was a middle aged, no nonsense type of woman who reminded him a little too much of Molly Weasley. Unfortunately, her desk was empty. He looked around, his wire-framed glasses slipping down his nose as he did so. "You," he barked, the file still clenched in his hand.</p><p>The intern's face drained of colour as she froze mid-step. "Head Auror Potter," she greeted nervously, her fingers flexing around the file in her hands.</p><p>He didn't recognise her, and judging as Hogwarts had just let out for summer hols, she looked to be one of the new interns. He raised his chin. "Have you seen Maria?" Harry asked, not unkindly, but there was an urgency seeping into his voice.</p><p>She shook her head. "I saw her leaving for her lunch break a half hour ago. Is there anything I can help you with?"</p><p>"No, thank you. I'll take care of it myself. Thank you." Harry brushed past her, raking his fingers through his hair as he hurried toward the lift.</p><p>Since his secretary was on lunch, he supposed he'd just have to find the man in question himself. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, not particularly looking forward to the meeting at all.</p><hr/><p>"Potter."</p><p>"Malfoy." Harry sighed as the man closed the door to his office. "I came across your complaint."</p><p>A pale brow rose. Malfoy snorted, falling into his leather chair behind his desk. "I must have submitted it two weeks ago, minimum. I'd expect for the DMLE to take a special interest in death threats, especially ones targeting a higher than normal official."</p><p>Harry didn't ask before taking the seat across from him, slapping the manilla file onto the desk between them. "I apologise for the lack of communication. It will be dealt with. How long has this been going on?"</p><p>Malfoy rested his elbows on his desk, propping his head up with his palm. "Theo has always received death threats. They started shortly after they allowed him to earn his certification as a barrister. These are different, and he chucks them out."</p><p>"Why aren't they being screened by his secretary? Surely he understands Ministry policy? Each of these should have been vetted as soon as they entered the building." Harry said roughly. "I don't think I need to say how bad this is, Malfoy. These aren't typical threats."</p><p>The blond man sat across from him cleared his throat. "They haven't been read by his secretary because they're coming straight to Nott Manor. He attempts to throw them away, but his house elf brings them to me right away."</p><p>"How did you manage to get Nott's house elf to bring <em>you</em> anything?" Harry asked. Not waiting for an answer, he continued, "Why isn't he taking these seriously?" He flipped the file open, snatching up the first threat, which was hardly one. "He has a full-fledged stalker."</p><p>Draco pulled the moving photograph from his hand, despite having already seen it once before. It captured Theo stumbling out of a pub in Diagon Alley, a buxom blonde on his arm. Theo had never seen the witch again after the photo had been sent, determining that it was too much of a risk, Draco answered. "He refuses to believe he's in danger, but I'm worried."</p><p>Harry plucked the photograph from the slender fingers gripping it, and he tucked it back into the file. "After what I've seen in this," Harry shook it, frustrated, "I'm worried as well. I can assign an Auror to be with him at all times, but first I'll need to open an investigation. Nott's a hell of a lawyer, so it's best I can prove without a doubt that he needs the protection."</p><p>Theodore Nott was the exact type to fight his own protection.</p><p>Malfoy blew out a harsh breath, adjusting his St Mungos coat. "Can I make a request for which Auror you assign?"</p><p>"I'll take it into consideration, I suppose," Harry replied, standing from his seat. "I hope you realise I'm going to put Nott with someone who can protect him."</p><p>The man nodded. "I do, but…" Malfoy trailed off, swallowing hard. "Put Granger on him. She's got the highest success rate these days from what I hear. They did an article over her last week in <em>Witch Weekly.</em>"</p><p>"Hermione?" Harry echoed. "I'll see what I can do, but she's out of the country right now. By the time I arrange this, she ought to be back."</p><p>Malfoy leaned back in his chair, relaxing against the leather. "Look," the man began, causing Harry to pause. "I know that she probably has no interest in protecting someone who—"</p><p>Harry raised a dark brow. "She's a professional. Any personal grudges, which she doesn't have any toward Theodore Nott, wouldn't come in the way of her job."</p><p>"Are you sure she doesn't have a grudge because she's a terror each time they cross paths."</p><p>Harry chuckled as he ran his fingers through his hair. "Are we going to have this conversation? I'll be in touch. Do me a favour, and don't let Nott know anything about this."</p><p>There was Malfoy's nod and then Harry closing the door behind him.</p><hr/><p>Hermione arrived in London in the early morning hours. It was silent around her in Diagon Alley, but within a few hours, it would come to life. Bundling her scarf around her neck, and pulling it over her chapped lips, she took in the frost that had settled over the streets. It was Christmas, officially.</p><p>Diagon Alley would be closed for the day for witches and wizards to spend time with their families. How had she forgotten what day it was?</p><p>Her scarf slipped from her face as she hurried toward the nearest public Apparition point. She crossed Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. There was a light on in the flat over the shop. She wondered why George was awake so early, and almost wished she was closer to the man so it wasn't strange for her to check in on him.</p><p>She wasn't though. Snow crunched beneath Hermione's boots as she made her way down the street.</p><p>Upon landing inside her flat, she noticed the layer of dust that covered everything. It'd been a month since she'd been home at all, and she spent more time away than home anymore. Harry hated it, so did Ron, but keeping busy was the best thing for her. Leaning against the back of the sofa, she removed her boots, tucking her wool socks inside of them.</p><p>She lit a fire with just a movement of her hand, and muttering the incantation, "<em>Incendio.</em>" Warmth slowly spread through the room as she held her hands in front of the fire.</p><p>The Floo connected behind her, and she turned to see a small face hovering in the fire. "James?" Granted, he wasn't so small anymore. She couldn't spin him around quite so easily, but he was in his second year of Hogwarts. "What are you doing?" Hermione laughed.</p><p>"Dad said your wards let him know someone entered your flat." James quipped. He ran a hand through his messy hair, looking to be the perfect image of his father. "He thought someone broke in."</p><p>She arched a brow. "So he sent you to call an intruder?"</p><p>He shook his head. "Of course not. He's already on his way over, but I assumed that you'd just come home for Christmas. You wouldn't miss it, you know?"</p><p>He was wrong, but Hermione said nothing. "And if you were wrong? What if someone had broken into my flat?"</p><p>Albus elbowed his way into the flames. "We were hoping that we'd get to see Dad kick somebody's arse." His voice was smaller than his brother's, honest and earnest.</p><p>Hermione burst into laughter. She knew that Harry had been itching for a fight since he left fieldwork—well, for the most part—and she knew it was the only reason he sprang out of bed. "Well, it's just me. There will be no arse kicking today."</p><p>James looked to Albus, his eyes widening. Just as she turned away, James shouted, "Wait! Could you pretend that you didn't know Dad was coming?"</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. "Pardon?"</p><p>"I just mean, if you didn't know he was coming, you'd think he was an intruder. So you could…"</p><p>"Kick his arse?" She supplied. "Well, I may need to. His response time is terrible. How long have we been on the Floo?"</p><p>A sudden, vicious crack vibrated through her flat. Harry stood on the other side of the room, wand drawn, but he didn't look menacing at all while in his pyjamas. "You're home late." He deadpanned. "What the fuck happened?"</p><p>"Naughty word!" Came another voice and Hermione looked to the Floo. Lily had joined her brothers. "Swear jar!"</p><p>Hermione sniggered. "You have a swear jar now? Your poor kids, they won't have anything left for their Hogwarts supplies, potty mouth."</p><p>Harry dragged a hand down his face, sighing heavily. "Shouldn't my kids be waiting for their presents?"</p><p>"Apparently me duelling you and winning is the best present they could ask for." Hermione snarked. "We can discuss why I'm late another time."</p><p>He ushered her to the Floo. "You're coming to family Christmas. In you go," Harry stared at his children. "Get out of the way or I'll sit on you when I come through." They scattered. As Hermione stepped into the fireplace, he said, "For the record, I would win in a duel."</p><p>She knew that he most likely would. It didn't stop her from teasing her. "What are you going to do? <em>Expelliarmus</em> me to death?"</p><p>Harry glared at her. "Fuck off."</p><p>She held a hand out. "Swear jar."</p><hr/><p>Ginny wrapped her into a tight hug as they came through. "We were worried about you." The woman whispered. "You're alright?"</p><p>Hermione smiled. "Nothing to worry about." She untangled herself from her friend and followed her into the sitting room.</p><p>All three children sat around the tree, their hands eagerly planted on the first presents they would open. It was immediately after that Hermione saw Teddy laying on the sofa, halfway hanging off. His hair was a different colour than the last time she'd seen him at Halloween in Hogsmeade. Now it was a bright purple.</p><p>Hermione sat at the end of the adjacent sofa, tucking her legs beneath her. James tossed a small box to her that seemed to be a collective gift from all of the Potters. It was curious. Almost every year, whether it was a birthday or Christmas, she received books. As much as she enjoyed reading, it was hardly her only hobby. She closed her hand over it, watching the kids tear into their presents.</p><p>Harry and Ginny sat beside her on the sofa, both sipping tea. He handed Hermione a cup of coffee. "Have you had any sleep?"</p><p>She shook her head. "No, I've been travelling by international portkey all night. I'll sleep later. Where's Ron?"</p><p>Usually, Ron, his wife, and their two, now three, kids joined the Potters for Christmas morning. Harry glanced toward Ginny before replying. "They decided not to join us this year. I understand he wants to spend the morning with his family just like I do, but we'll see them at the Burrow for lunch. You'll come, won't you?"</p><p>Hermione didn't hear the question. She was too old to be worried about intruding on his family, considering she knew just how welcome she was, but the wording struck her like a bludger. "Do you want to celebrate the morning alone?"</p><p>His eyes widened, and he looked to James who was loudly whooping that he'd gotten a new broomstick. "That's not what I meant."</p><p>"Okay," Hermione said with an easy smile. "I wouldn't mind if that was what you wanted. I could catch a few hours sleep and join you at the Burrow if that was the case." Merlin, they were really too old to be going back and forth on this. "I just wanted to be sure is all."</p><p>Ginny laughed from her seat. "Do you like it?"</p><p>Lily proudly held up the newest joke set from Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. "I can't wait for James and Albus to return to Hogwarts." She traced a finger over the itching powder encased in the plastic. "Gives me a couple of months to prank you really good."</p><hr/><p>Hermione didn't dislike visiting the Burrow. She was still part of the extended family as Molly said, but it was uncomfortable. Like something was stuck under her skin and she was dying to escape from the moment she arrived.</p><p>She didn't dislike Lavender either. Their school rivalry revolving around Ron Weasley had been long put to rest, but it was hard looking at her. Looking at them when she knew just why everything had fallen apart with her and fallen into place with Lavender.</p><p>Still, the woman rushed Hermione as soon as she saw her, pulling her into a tight, friendly hug. "Hermione, it's been ages!" Lavender squealed.</p><p>"Eight weeks is a long time." Hermione grinned, patting her back before stepping away. "Where's the baby?"</p><p>Lavender grinned ear to ear, holding up a finger as she disappeared around a corner. She reappeared while holding an impeccably dressed baby who'd been born with a full head of red hair. "Had to pry him away from Molly. She'll probably be around the corner once she hears you're home."</p><p>Genuinely smiling, Hermione took the baby and spun while holding him tightly to her chest. He let out a giggle, and Hermione laughed. "How are the kids?"</p><p>"Oh, the same. Scarlett is a hellion. All she wants to do is go to Hogwarts, and it's less than a year away now."</p><p>"Oh, but that's not enough." Hermione laughed. "She wants to go right <em>now</em>."</p><p>"Rose is still reading through all of the books you bought her. I can hardly get her to do anything else." Lavender motioned across the room to where her two daughters were standing. Ten and nine years old, Ron and Lavender hadn't wasted any time.</p><p>Hermione knew it was because they wanted the Potter and Weasley children as close as possible. "Well, for the moment, Fred is my favorite." It had been a year since he'd been born, but the familiar name rolling off her tongue still twisted her gut.</p><p>She wondered if it was the same for others.</p><p>Hermione nuzzled her nose against Fred's, smiling wide as he threw his hands up. "Who's just the cutest little baby I've ever seen?"</p><p>"Rose wants to be an Auror now."</p><p>Her head snapped up. Lavender's expression had changed swiftly, worry clouding her features. "She's only nine; she may change her mind still."</p><p>"To tell you the truth, it's one of the only things she'll talk about. 'When I'm an Auror, I'll do this, or that.' What parent wants their child to be an Auror?" Lavender sucked in a breath. "Not that you—"</p><p>Hermione held up a hand. "No offence taken. It's a dangerous job at times. If I had children, I'm sure I wouldn't want it either."</p><p>"I've been waiting for you to come home to pick your brain about it." Lavender admitted. "It didn't seem so urgent to write when we didn't know where you were."</p><p>She shifted Fred to her other hip. "I'm not sure I'm the ideal person to discuss it with. I don't have kids. I have no parental experience."</p><p>"I know," Lavender said quietly, taking a side to the right, pivoting away from the room. "I just wondered what you thought."</p><p>Rose was laughing loudly after pushing Victoire and Teddy under an enchanted mistletoe.</p><p>"If she wants to be an Auror, you'll do more damage by discouraging her goals than if you encourage them " Hermione answered. "She may very well grow out of this, and want another career."</p><p>She tucked blonde strands behind her ears as she nodded. "I thought that's what you would say. You're right. Thank you."</p><p>Hermione blinked. She hadn't done anything at all. "Of course. You're welcome."</p><hr/><p>Harry insisted that she take a couple of days off. In the same conversation, he mentioned that he had a new mission for her, and it would be long term. It would also be close to home.</p><p>She spent a small amount of time wondering what it was. Other than that, she took a long soak in the bath, read two books that she picked up, and did some much needed shopping.</p><p>Even though she was under orders to avoid the Ministry, she visited Harry for lunch on the last day before she would return to work. The walk across the atrium provided scattered hellos, and momentary surprise as others passed her. She'd been gone for a long time, she supposed.</p><p>The lift was rickety in the same spots as she remembered, and there was a wobbling part next to her ear. Brushing elbows with the man beside her, she stepped onto Harry's floor. It was a sea of people, all chattering, the collective panic almost palpable in the air.</p><p>Hermione stopped beside Auror Boot's desk, hovering as he stared at the file in front of him. "What's going on?"</p><p>He didn't raise his head. Terry handed her a photograph, and her stomach sank. It was a body, the head nearly severed. "Fuck's sake," Hermione breathed.</p><p>"Look at this one." He handed another, still not lifting his head. "Whoever is doing this is a seriously sick fuck."</p><p>In the next photo, there were runes carved into the victim's back. She wasn't sure what they were used for without research, but near the bottom of his back, she recognised the Dark Mark. "He's dead."</p><p>Terry nodded. "We were all there to see it. Harry and his <em>Expelliarmus</em>. The noseless bastard disintegrating, but if this makes it to the public, we'll have an outcry."</p><p>The Wizarding World would believe there was a third act of Voldemort coming. "Was he discovered this morning?"</p><p>"Glamoured on the edge of the Thames. Best guess is whoever left him wanted him to be found by an Auror on patrol."</p><p>Hermione handed the photos back, making a beeline straight for Harry's office without making time for pleasantries. Pushing the door open without knocking, she paused in the doorway as she Malfoy stood from the chair across from Harry. "I didn't think you had anyone. I'll wait."</p><p>Harry rubbed his temples. "No need, Malfoy was just leaving."</p><p>She lingered in the doorway, nodding to Malfoy as he brushed past her. But the look he gave her was curious, indiscernible really. Hermione closed the door behind her, taking the seat across from Harry. "In my defence, I came to have lunch with you."</p><p>He dropped his glasses to his desk, leaning back in his chair. "But that's not what you're here for now."</p><p>"I want to start working now. That was a grisly murder." No sooner had the words left her mouth, Harry shook his head. "What difference does it make whether I return to work today or tomorrow?"</p><p>"The difference is that you're not working that case," Harry replied. "I already told you that there was an assignment waiting two days ago. This was just discovered this morning. Since you're already here, however, let's talk about your new assignment."</p><p>She sat ramrod straight in her chair, waiting. "You have a sour look on your face."</p><p>"Commit it to memory then because I'm sure you'll look the same in a minute. You know Theo Nott, don't you? Big shot lawyer now, taller than Ron or I, a bit of a—"</p><p>"I know who he is," Hermione said smoothly. "Go on."</p><p>"He has a stalker. For the past two, maybe three, months death threats have been sent directly to his home. There were photographs showing where he's been, who he's been with, and it was brought to me that he's in danger."</p><p>Clearly so, but she already knew where this conversation was leading. "I'm his bodyguard, aren't I?"</p><p>Harry nodded. "It was Malfoy who filed a report, and brought it to my attention. Nott is convinced that the threats can be disregarded, but it's a risk I'm not prepared to take."</p><p>Rational. "Okay. I've acted as a bodyguard before." She was confident in that moment that she understood, and that she had it under control.</p><p>He ripped the metaphorical rug out from under her. "Not like this. It's a 24/7 mission, Hermione. Once this starts, you'll be living in Nott Manor until we find the stalker."</p><p>Her lips parted, and then her jaw was hanging open. "You're—Nott has agreed to all of this?"</p><p>Silence.</p><p>"Don't you <em>dare </em>tell me he doesn't even know."</p><p>Harry smirked. "I must not tell lies."</p><p>She wanted to throw his name plate at his head. "I won't be the one to drop the news on him."</p><hr/><p> </p>
