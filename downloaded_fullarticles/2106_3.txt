    <p>Harry heaved again as Severus came into the bathroom. “Here, love. I’m sorry you had to wait so long.” He tried to hand down the Morning Sickness potion to Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“I—" Harry paused to heave again. “<em>Hate</em> you.” He finished, taking the potion and opening it. “You've put the spawn of Satan in my belly!” He added before taking the potion and sighing in relief.</p><p> </p><p>“I assure you, the only <em>spawn </em>currently residing in you is <em>mine</em>.” Severus said, kneeling down to rub comforting circles on Harry's back. “By now, you’ve certainly missed the meeting.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry groaned. “I <em>know</em>. Thankfully the whole dragon reserve thing is already underway, since we passed it two days ago, so I could afford to miss today's.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>Severus smiled. “Come back to bed for a while.” He said. “We can lie together. I have nothing pressing going on today.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I do</em>.” Harry said regretfully. “I promised Draco I’d meet them for tea, so we could go over my role in the wedding.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus sighed. “Rain check, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Definitely.” Harry confirmed before kissing him and rushing out the door.</p><p> </p><p>He got to Draco's house just as Draco and Neville returned home and grinned brightly. “Did I miss anything?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Draco shrugged. “Just father and cousin Sirius sniping at each other. Nothing interesting. I would have liked to have seen <em>your </em>reaction to the mood father was in today. He was in fine form, more than willing to start a pissing contest with any comers.” He said in amusement.</p><p> </p><p>Harry chuckled. “I was too sick to make it, but next time he's in that mood, I’ll happily take him on for your amusement, shall I?”</p><p> </p><p>Neville shook his head. “You do know that if an Alpha goes after you, Harry, it’s <em>my</em> job as your escort to jump in and help you defend yourself from them? I don’t want to fight <em>Lucius Malfoy</em>!” He said worriedly.</p><p> </p><p>Harry snorted. “He wouldn’t attack <em>me</em>. He knows Severus would rend him limb from limb if he did that, and he's seen Severus in full Alpha rage. It was terrifying for <em>him</em>, I’m sure. <em>I</em> found it sexy as all hell. I got to climb my mate like a tree after, it was very satisfying.” He said as they walked into the house and took their seats.</p><p> </p><p>Draco chuckled. “Climb him like a tree? I'll have to remember that one.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>“So, the wedding will be traditional.” Neville began, rolling his eyes at the two subs who were still grinning at each other. “Since Lucius and Gran wouldn’t have it any other way. There will be a purity spell cast.” He said, in deep amusement. “Which, of course, everyone knows we will fail.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco snorted. “The babies are kind of a dead giveaway.” He added.</p><p> </p><p>Remus came into the room, wiping his hands on a hand towel. “The house-elf is now free, if you'd all like tea. I had her make up some pregnancy crackers for you, Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco called her and ordered tea and seven crackers for Harry to snack on.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco, don’t take this the wrong way, but I <em>love</em> you right now.” Harry said happily as the elf popped back in, handing a handful of crackers to him.</p><p> </p><p>Draco smiled. “Adoration noted. You're welcome.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry turned his smile to Remus. “Thanks for having her make them. They're a life-saver.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus smiled. “Of course. You're the nephew I never had, I <em>have</em> to spoil you.” He said simply.</p><p> </p><p>Harry munched on a cracker for a few minutes while everyone made their tea, then asked, “So, what exactly is <em>my part</em> in the wedding going to be, and does it differ from Ron's job as my best man?”</p><p> </p><p>Neville smiled. “The real difference is going to be the blessing spell we’re incorporating into the hand-fasting…”</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Harry groaned in appreciation as Severus finished massaging his feet, placing a soft kiss on the arch of each, making Harry giggle.</p><p> </p><p>“There, all clean and relaxed, and ready to stand for however long you need to. When we get home I will massage your feet again if they hurt, but I only kiss those things when they've just come out of a bath or shower. Not out of your <em>shoes</em>.” Severus said sternly.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled. “Got it. Where are my dress robes?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I laid them out on the bed while you were cleaning up. They should still be there, if Nyx stayed away from them.” Severus muttered.</p><p> </p><p>“She doesn’t much <em>like</em> you, does she?” Harry asked.</p><p> </p><p>Severus shook his head. “The rancour is mutual, but we <em>have</em> learned to <em>coexist</em>, if nothing else. We’re doing it for <em>your</em> sake.” He told his mate.</p><p> </p><p>Harry beamed at him. “And I appreciate it. Even false harmony will help with my stress levels, which is good for the baby.”</p><p> </p><p>“The <em>only</em> reason she is still allowed in my rooms.” Severus muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled as he dressed. “Well, once we get a <em>proper</em> house, she can stay in my study.” He said. “Then you won’t have to deal with her, nor her with you. I’m sure you'd <em>both</em> prefer that.”</p><p> </p><p>“It would be <em>heaven</em>.” Severus told him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry beamed at him and patted his cheek. “Just a little while. Let's look for a house <em>now</em>, shall we? We can contact a real estate agent after the wedding. When we get a house, we can get separate wardrobes and tell Nyx she's only to shit in <em>mine</em>. Does that sound good?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Severus hummed. “I suppose it’s a good idea. We can’t have a child underfoot in our rooms here.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned at him. “We <em>will</em>, though. The baby is living <em>here</em>, with <em>us</em>, until they are three. Don’t fight me on this, you won’t win.”</p><p> </p><p>“Will you be able to keep the child out of the potions and my things once they start crawling and walking?” Severus asked.</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. “We'll need a nanny, too. I'll have classes to attend.” He realized.</p><p> </p><p>Severus shook his head. “We have Pippy. She will be <em>thrilled</em> to look after our child. I spoke with her privately after we returned from our honeymoon. She is capable and excited.” He explained.</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. “I <em>suppose </em>that will work. I’m going to sweat in my shoes.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>Severus chuckled. “No. Cast a barrier charm around your feet. Not all wizards wear socks, but none want to ruin their shoes.” He cast the charm and Harry smiled at him.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks.” He sat and pulled his shoes on. “We're ready.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus led him out of the bedroom and to the Floo. “I'll go first.” He said, then Flooed to the Manor.</p><p> </p><p>Harry followed him and groaned as his stomach turned as he was spat out of the fireplace into Severus' arms.</p><p> </p><p>“Graceful as ever.” Severus said in amusement.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off.” Harry muttered. “Oh, I <em>hate</em> Wizarding travel.”</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, best man. Let's get you to your groom.” Severus said with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked at the ring in his hand. It was white gold, with Neville and Remus' names engraved on the inside of the band.</p><p> </p><p>Neville held his hand back for the ring, and Harry handed it to him.</p><p> </p><p>He shifted his attention back to the wedding, and was just in time to hear the officiator declare, “You may now seal your union with a kiss.”</p><p> </p><p>Neville cupped Draco's face and leaned in to kiss him.</p><p> </p><p>There was a round of applause, and the officiator smiled. “Now, there is to be a second event. Will the third party in the bond step forward?”</p><p> </p><p>Remus came forward to stand between the two.</p><p> </p><p>“Is there any reason why these three men should not henceforth be hand-fasted?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>No answer was forthcoming, although Harry was sure that sound he was hearing was Lucius’ teeth grinding.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator turned his smile on Remus. “I understand you wish to give your own vows, and they both have vows to make to you in return. You may begin.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus cleared his throat. “I have known love before, among others afflicted like me, but the love you two gave me was purer, as it came from a place of privilege I have lost, and was all the stronger for it. You didn’t <em>have</em> to accept me and welcome me into your hearts, yet you did. You didn’t <em>have</em> to trust me every full moon and nurse me back to health the day after, but you <em>did</em>. The two of you have given me, not only unconditional love, but two beautiful children, and hopefully more in the future. I love you both more than words can say, and hope to spend the rest of my days showing you my love in every way I am able, both big and small. I hope to make you both as happy as you have made me.” He said, taking a hand in each of his own.</p><p> </p><p>Neville and Draco smiled back at him, and Neville began to speak. “Remus, we both love you more than we can say. You've submitted yourself to me beautifully, and I treasure the trust you have in me to keep our partnership equal.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>Draco continued the vow. “At the same time, you’ve listened to him when he explained things about Omegas that aren’t exactly common knowledge, and you’ve helped me to be more comfortable with my biology and my body, even when it sometimes feels like both are betraying me. You’ve stayed calm through mood swings and sleepless nights, through hormone-driven heats and droughts after the babies were born.”</p><p> </p><p>“We both have learned a lot from your calmness, and your patience has outstripped even <em>mine</em>.” Neville told him. “We'd both love to join our lives to yours, and share in every joy and heartache you will face from here out.” Neville finished.</p><p> </p><p>“You are our beloved, and we will never let you down.” Draco finished.</p><p> </p><p>The officiator drew his wand. “If you three will bring forward your right hands, and lay them one atop each other, with the Omega's on bottom and the Alpha’s on top, I will bind you.”</p><p> </p><p>They placed their hands as instructed and the officiator murmured a spell, causing ribbons of magic to wrap around their hands before they gave a single pulse and seeped into their skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Your lives, magic, and souls are now bound together. Lady magic will watch over you, and you will never be parted again.” He said. “Will the groomsmen join me in blessing this union now?” He asked, and Harry raised his wand with the others, casting the nonverbal spell that caused a shower of silver sparks to rain down over the three men, blessing their union and strengthening their bond.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had to admit, the ceremony was elegant and beautiful, but he preferred his wedding to Severus. The fusion of Wizarding and Muggle had suited their relationship better.</p>
