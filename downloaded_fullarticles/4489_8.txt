  <b>Prologue</b>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> On Christmas Eve of 1977, there was a snowstorm of epic proportions in the Highlands of Scotland. At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where nearly four feet of snow covered the castle and grounds, six teenagers awoke at approximately the same time and spent the first few waking minutes of their last Christmas at school staring at what the blizzard left in its wake. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> That morning, for just a few minutes, the fear and anxiousness that had burrowed into their minds was cast out. Similar thoughts crossed all six minds at precisely the same moments; but they were not thoughts of missing loved ones, terrorized muggles, or the latest Wizarding War news at all. For those precious moments, six teenagers who would each change the course of the war in dramatic ways thought of nothing more than the beauty and peace that had wrapped itself so wholly around their school. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Yes, the thick blanket of snow drew these students to start their day in the same way, but the next twenty-four hours marking their last Christmas at Hogwarts played out very differently starting the moment they looked away from the snow. </em>
</p><p><br/> <em><br/> One would make a move that four of them had seen coming for ages.</em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> One would unknowingly begin the downfall of the other five. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> One would have the best day of his life thus far. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> One would doubt his loyalties for the first time. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> And two of them who had recently called off a relationship would be brought together again, if only for a few hours. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> … But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. </em>
</p><p><br/> <em><br/> At 9:07 am on Christmas morning, 1977, six teenagers in varying states of dishevel and undress looked towards the frozen, snow-covered lake and unknowingly thought identical thoughts.</em></p><p><br/> <em><br/> "Wow," breathed Lily and Peter from opposite sides of Gryffindor tower. </em></p><p><br/> <em><br/> "Yeah," answered Sirius and James from the same room, different windows. </em></p><p><br/> <em><br/> </em>Everything's so peaceful,<em> thought Remus and Severus as they shivered on towers on each end of the castle.</em></p><p><br/> <em> And in the seconds that followed, they all thought that they were in for a perfectly ordinary Christmas, and each was soon proven very, very wrong. </em></p>
