    <p align="center"> </p><p>The voyage to America had been a smooth one, but Newt still found himself feeling rather ill. He was just going to stop in New York to get his wand permit, and then he’d leave for Arizona immediately, he wouldn’t be anywhere near the security department. Wouldn’t be anywhere near <em>him. </em>There was no reason for him to be so anxious, it wasn’t as if the head of magical security would be down in the permits office after all. Newt swallowed the lump in his throat painfully, and let himself think of the circumstances which had led him to Percival Graves.</p><p>
  <em>They’d just received word, Turkish forces had fallen in Megiddo, Germany had asked for armistice, and, after a brief mutiny from their navy, signed a treaty with the allied forces. The war was over; they could finally go home. Newt had been overcome with a wave of conflicting emotions; on the one hand the fighting was over, they didn’t have to live every moment in fear of death anymore, but on the other he would have to go home to a rather uncertain future.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Newt was only supposed to be there to do his part, to aid the muggle forces the way his brother had intended to. He had one job, and that was to get through the war, return home and fade back into obscurity. His brother would have a good record, honorable discharge maybe, and would then be able to carry on with his dreams of becoming an auror. Newt still wasn’t sure how to feel about his parents almost violent reactions to Theseus decision to join in the war effort- they hadn’t even been that angry when Newt had been expelled, though it certainly came close. They had begged at first, but when his brother refused to budge, stubborn Gryffindor that he was, his parents turned cruel- they threatened to disinherit him, to disinherit them both, if he proceeded to go to war. He was their baby boy, their heir, he couldn’t gamble his life on something so unpredictable as war, least of all a muggle war. That night, after everyone had gone to bed, Newt thought long and hard about what he was going to do. Theseus didn’t believe their parents would disinherit them, he thought they were merely bluffing, and that, when he came home, they’d forgive him his need to serve, “We’ve no right to sit by and let the muggles fight while we sit with our thumbs up our arses. I have to do this, Newt, for king and country!” he’d guffawed, trying to lighten the mood. But Newt knew otherwise. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Newt knew their parents meant business- they’d shown him just how serious they were, how angry they were, when they’d received word of his expulsion: he’d already been removed from their estates, and wills, they just hadn’t felt the need to mention it to Theseus when they’d threatened him. Newt refused to let his brother throw away a promising career over his bullheadedness- theirs was a very proprietary society, and something so bad as being disinherited would make it so much more difficult for Theseus to chase his dreams. It was terrible to think, but Newt knew that Theseus would likely be unable to fulfill his aspirations if he was disinherited- that the purebloods running the Ministry would see him as a disgrace and therefore unfit to serve as an auror- power and competence be damned.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So, with the consequences to his brother at the forefront of his mind, Newt went to their parent’s rooms. They were not terribly happy to see him, their favorite son refused to see sense and now they had to deal with the disappointment on top of everything else. “What is it Newton? Do not try to plead your brother’s case, you know very well we will see he is stripped of his inheritance if he refuses to see sense,” his father intoned hotly. His mother merely nodded her head primly, her eyes still puffy and red rimmed. Newt shook his head as he said, “I’m n-not here to try and convince you to let Theseus go. I know this isn’t an em-empty threat, and I know he won’t be able to f-follow his dreams if you follow through. I-I’m here to ask you to l-let me go in his st-stead.” The gob smacked look on his parent’s faces would have made him laugh under normal circumstances, but as it was Newt was merely resigned.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Absolutely not! It’s bad enough that your brother wants to fight- he’s at least a competent duelist- but you want to smear our family name further by attempting to enlist, by defying the ministry so openly!? You were a below average student at Hogwarts, who couldn’t even manage to graduate without nearly being expelled, you’d be killed in the first altercation! No. I refuse to be embarrassed by you in such a public fashion again. Your brother will see sense, or he will not inherit the lands and titles befitting the heir of our house.” The steely glint in Ignatius Scamander’s eyes was nearly overwhelming, and Newt fought hard to maintain eye contact- it wouldn’t do for his plans to fail because he couldn’t look people in the eye.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> “No father, I won’t be enlisting, Theseus will, at least, that’s what it will say on paper.” His parents voiced their confusion, “What do you mean? We’ve just had this discussion, Newton, your brother cannot go, he is our only heir, and we refuse to let you embarrass us any further!” Newt pursed his lips and then, looking both in the eye told them his plan. “Theseus wants to make sure to do his part in the war, he feels obligated, and you and I both know that he’ll do what he wants, both as a patriot, and because he’s bound and determined to do the right thing, whether or not it’s in accordance with the law; so, I will take his place. Theseus will stay here- threaten only to disinherit me, perhaps that will stop him, or say they’d sentence me to Azkaban, anything to keep him from following- and I will serve in his stead. I know you don’t think I can do anything but embarrass you, but I can stay alive long enough to guarantee that Theseus gets his wish- I will aid the muggles as he wants, he will have a proper military background, and the Scamander name won’t be tarnished. Please. Don’t let him ruin his life, let me take his place. I swear I won’t let you down. Not in this.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>After much debating, Ignatius and Diana Scamander finally agreed to Newt’s terms; he would take his brother’s place so that they would not lose their proper heir, and they wouldn’t disinherit his brother. Newt enlisted the next morning, after having put his brother under a rather heavy sleeping jinx, and left for basic training immediately. When he received Theseus’ owl three days into training, he was lucky his brother hadn’t sent a howler, though Newt imagined it’d been a near thing. Theseus was livid, how dare their parents use Newt to keep him home, and how could Newt go along with their cockamamie scheme? Newt’s reply was an assurance that he would be fine and that everything would work out for the best.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He hadn’t intended to garner so much attention to himself, honestly, he’d only been trying to save his men. But here he was, a bloody war hero, likely headed toward commendations or some other such nonsense- Ministry rules paled in comparison to what he’d “accomplished”. He wasn’t a hero, he’d only been doing the right thing, he didn’t need accolades for being a decent human being. Though, he supposed, in a time where men were dying for a few feet of land every other day, it could be considered commendable to want to save the lives of his fellow soldier at great risk to himself. Still, he wasn’t a hero he was a- “Theseus!” He was a bloody buggering liar, that’s what he was. Closing his eyes, Newt turned to watch as Percival jogged over to meet him, brandishing papers no doubt further confirming the news of peace, Newt felt a terrible weight settle in his stomach as he took the older man in, tried to burn the memory of his deep brown eyes, and his disbelieving smile into his mind. Newt couldn’t see him after this, couldn’t continue the fragile romance they’d struck up one night after another day of pointless loss. He couldn’t keep lying to the man he’d come to love.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Their entire relationship was built upon a lie, after all. Percival knew him as Theseus; that’s what he’d introduced himself as, and that’s the name Percival used when they drank together. It was the name Percival used when they told each other about their homes, and their dreams of the future. Theseus was the name Percival whispered harshly when Newt went down on his knees for the first time to suck him off. Worst of all, though was what Percival went on to say later that very night, after the celebrations had died down and they’d hidden away for a bit of privacy. After they had rutted against each other and snogged like a pair of swooning teens, Percival had looked up from Newt’s shoulder, and, cupping his cheek, stated, “I think I’m in love with you, Theseus Scamander.” That, more than anything, drove home the reality of the situation, and how careless Newt had been. Now, it was not only his own heart which would be broken, but Percival’s as well; so, for both of their sakes, he had to let the other man go. Percival would leave with the other Americans when they were shipped home, and Newt would return to England immediately. He’d managed to make a few contacts with the Dragon Corps while they’d been on a stopover at his unit’s camp, they informed him of positions in need of filling after the war had ended, so Newt had something waiting for him as well. With the knowledge that he would likely never see Percival Graves again, and that what he was doing was a terrible disservice to the man himself weighing heavily on his heart, Newt Scamander left his lover’s side and headed toward the communications tent; he was owed a small favor, and getting to head home a smidge early couldn’t hurt anyone.</em>
</p><p>Newt was pulled from his melancholy thoughts when the latches of his case snapped open abruptly. With a soft, indulgent smile, he pushed his hurt down and leaned toward the case, saying softly, “Dougal, do settle down now, please. We’ll be there soon.”</p><p>
