    <p>Mother, Father, and I fled before the battle was even over. When Voldemort came up to the front doors of Hogwarts from the Forbidden Forest, Harry Potter laying lifeless in the great oaf Hagrid's arms, and announced that a change of sides could be made I walked over to where my parents stood beckoning, very much aware of the countless pairs of eyes watching me on both sides.</p>
<p>As Potter made it known that he was still alive and the battle resumed, we snuck away and apparated back home to Malfoy Manor. But we couldn't stay here anymore. As former headquarters for Voldemort and his followers, it wasn't safe here and it was likely to be confiscated by the Ministry of Magic to aid in tracking down former death eaters. Not to mention there were too many bad memories here. Too much dark magic. So we packed up the essentials and apparated to the outskirts of London. We found an inn to stay at while we thought up our next move.</p>
<p>We watched that night as the Dark Marks on my father and I's forearms slowly faded. They were still visible, but just barely. We knew what this meant. Potter had succeeded. Voldemort was dead. For good this time. He wouldn't be coming back.</p>
<p>I laid in one bed with mother while father laid in the other. She held onto me, gently stroking my hair. My head was tucked under her chin and I could feel her silent tears fall on the top of my head. We fell asleep like that.</p>
<p>&lt;~~~&gt;</p>
<p>The next morning the sound of the door being busted down startled me awake. I shot up and looked towards the door. Five Aurors were standing there with wands all pointing at my fathers' bed. The only one who had a wand was my mother, but it was on the other side of the room. They had found us, and we were defenseless and vulnerable.</p>
<p>"Lucius Malfoy," the Auror in front bellowed in a deep, authoritative voice, "you are sentenced to life in Azkaban for assisting You-Know-Who. Narcissa and Draco Malfoy," he glanced at mother and I before continuing, "trials will be held to determine your fate as a result of your aiding in You-Know-Who's efforts." With that as their premise, they cuffed my father and took him away, presumably to rot away in Azkaban. After they were gone, my mother broke down into sobs. Still dazed, I turned to mother and held her while she sobbed with tears of my own streaming down my face, the rule of 'Malfoy's don't cry' momentarily thrown to the wind.</p>
<p>"Draco," she croaked. "What are we going to do? We're condemned for sure."</p>
<p>"I don't know, mother. I don't know." I couldn't think straight. Fear, sorrow, and guilt coursed through me. Mother whimpered and I stroked her back comfortingly. We sat like that for what seemed like hours.</p>
<p>&lt;~~~&gt;</p>
<p>Mother and I's trial was about a month later. We pulled ourselves together and fixed ourselves up as best we could and made our way to the Ministry of Magic. Mother gave me a sad smile as she straightened my dress robes. "You look lovely dear." Her smile faltered a bit, "if only we were dressing for a different occasion." The sorrow was so strong in her eyes that I had to look away or else I might've started crying again. I didn't want to go to Azkaban. I know I probably deserve to go, but I was scared. In Azkaban, I'd relive the events of Voldemort's reign for the rest of my miserable life. If I was lucky they'd sentence me to a dementor's kiss and I'd be done with it all. I vaguely wondered if that was what is to happen to my father.</p>
<p>We showed up to the Ministry of Magic a couple of hours before our trial was set to start, anxious to get it over with and know our verdict. The wait was agonizingly nerve-wracking. We were sitting on a small bench in the hall. Mother was holding my head to her chest as she stroked my hair when the sound of someone clearing their throat next to us caught our attention. I looked up to see if it was someone coming to collect us for the trial but low and behold, none other than Harry sodding Potter stood before us. He had this stupid sheepish look on his face.</p>
<p>I felt mother shift and let go of me. I shot her a panicked look as she stood to which she responded with a smile before saying, "I think I'm going to go get some water." Then she was gone leaving me alone with the boy wonder.</p>
<p>He took her previously occupied spot and I sat up even straighter. I didn't know what he wanted but it couldn't be anything good.</p>
<p>A long time passed in silence before I decided that I couldn't take it anymore. Just as I opened my mouth to say something Potter spoke up. "Thank you. For what you did at the Manor. I appreciate it." I'm sure I looked like an idiot with my mouth hanging open so I snapped it shut.</p>
<p>I opened and closed my mouth a few times trying to make words come out but all I managed to do was look like a fish struggling to breathe. My mind couldn't formulate a coherent response. Why would Potter be thanking me? I made his life miserable for 6 years. One act couldn't possibly make up for that. Could it?</p>
<p>"Erm, thank you for, er, saving me. From the fiendfyre." I replied awkwardly.</p>
<p>He nodded. "Sorry about Crabbe."</p>
<p>Crabbe. I stiffened. I still didn't like to think about it. It brought too much guilt. All the memories did.</p>
<p>As the members of the Wizengamot started to file in one by one I knew it was finally time. Mother returned to my side and Potter bid us both farewell. Mother gripped my shoulder and I placed my hand over hers. Then we walked in to face our sins.</p>
<p>The charges against us weren't as bad as that of the other death eaters but they weren't good either, and we were sure we were doomed. But with Harry "Golden Boy" Potter's testimonies about mother saving his life in the forest, the countless times I was too afraid or hesitant to fulfill Voldemort's wishes, and the time I also saved his life in the Manor, we were freed of most of our charges. We were both sentenced to five years of house arrest and constant check-ins with the Ministry. Mother settled down in a nice little house on the outskirts of London while I got my own apartment not too far from her. But we wouldn't live happily ever after; I don't think either of us knew how to be happy again.</p>
