  <em>Foolish girl.</em>
</p>
<p><b>iv.</b><br/>Ginny writes in the diary out of needfulness, at first, needing some place to store her thoughts and hurts and fears, somewhere they won’t be laughed at, won’t be made less of, won’t be ignored. Some place they’re taken<em> seriously.</em> When the book writes back she begins to write because <em>at last someone cares.</em></p>
<p>Oh, maybe it’s not <em>someone,</em> her Tom, he’s just a book after all, but he <em>listens </em>and he responds, offers kind words and comfort and assures her when she doubts.</p>
<p>She writes because<em> she has a friend.</em></p>
<p><b>v.</b><br/>Time, slipping. Dizziness.</p>
<p><b>vi.</b><br/>When she comes to, her hands are covered in red. She doesn’t know if it’s blood or ink. If it’s the blood of a cockerel, a rabbit, an owl, or her own.</p>
<p>The blood of Mrs. Norris, maybe.</p>
<p>She hides in the shower, and cries.</p>
<p><b>vii.</b><br/>There’s things going on in the school - the spiders, the cockerels, the petrification, the signs in scarlet red scrawled on the walls. Ginny doesn’t care, is too wrapped up in the growing sieve of her own mind.</p>
<p><b>viii.</b><br/>Tom. Tom <em>please-</em></p>
<p><b>ix.</b><br/>Foolish Girl.</p>
<p><b>x.</b><br/>Ginny wakes in the chamber, soaked in ink.</p></div>
