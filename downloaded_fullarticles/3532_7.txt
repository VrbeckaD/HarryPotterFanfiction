    <p>She had known Harry would want to spare her. She had also known that it would be no use to explain to him why he <em>couldn’t </em>spare her—that it wouldn’t make a difference to the Death Eaters whether she was the love of his life or just his ex. She was a Weasley, a blood traitor, and Harry’s former girlfriend. Of course she would have a target painted on her back. But Harry was trying to do the noble thing, the <em>Gryffindor </em>thing; it was part of why she loved him, and also what made him so bloody frustrating to love. So she shut up, and let him leave her, let him wrench away another piece of her heart, and laid her plans.</p><p>Ginny had no intention of staying safe this year. Harry was off to fight Voldemort on his own terms, on some secret mission from Dumbledore that only Ron and Hermione could help with. If it hadn’t been for the Trace, Ginny might have tried harder to go with them, but as it was, she would only have added to their risk of getting caught. That didn’t mean she couldn’t fight, too.</p><p><em>Neville,</em> she wrote. <em>Now the Ministry’s fallen, how much do you want to bet there’ll be some changes at Hogwarts? Nobody from the Order’s telling me anything, so it looks like we’re on our own. Want to make some plans?</em></p><p>
  <em>-Ginny.</em>
</p><p>The letters to Luna and Colin Creevey were almost identical. Pigwidgeon came back with short responses.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Ginny,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I would be delighted to help destabilize the new regime. Father thinks they’re going to replace Professor McGonagall with a vampire as headmaster. I suggest we bring plenty of garlic. Also, we need to be very careful about our dentistry. With the Aurors now working for the Dark Side, the Rot-Fang conspiracy has surely taken a stronger hold within the Ministry, and they might try it at Hogwarts, too. I shall come up with more ideas when I have more time.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Luna.</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <em>Ginny—</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Time to bring the DA back, you reckon?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>—Neville</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hi Ginny,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I don’t know if I can come back. I’m Muggle-born, remember? Maybe I can get my family tree updated. But if I do come back to Hogwarts… I’ve got quite the stock of Dungbombs here at home, and Dennis and I have been studying up on Defensive magic. I hope I can come back to Hogwarts and fight alongside you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your Friend,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Colin</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Reading Colin’s note, Ginny felt as though a lump of iron had settled in her stomach. The fact that one of her best friends from school might not be able to return hadn’t occurred to her. She went downstairs slowly, clutching the letter in her hand. Her parents were sitting at the table, heads close together, talking in whispers. They both looked up at Ginny’s footsteps.</p><p>“Ginny!” Molly’s eyes widened as she took in the look on her daughter’s face. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“I’m okay, Mum.” Ginny glanced at her father. “Dad, could I have a word? When you’re not busy?”</p><p>Her parents exchanged looks.</p><p>“Why don’t you two go outside?” Molly suggested after a moment. “The house is a bit… crowded… at the moment.”</p><p>Arthur got to his feet and beckoned Ginny. About to follow him out the door, she turned. “Thanks, Mum.”</p><p>“Nothing to thank me for, dear,” said her mother, but her eyes went to the wall of the kitchen where the clock hung; all nine hands now rested on “Mortal Peril”.</p><p>Ginny shivered, and went outside.</p><p>“Colin Creevey’s in trouble,” she said without preamble, when they were outside. “He and his brother are Muggle-borns—if something isn’t done, they’ll either have to go on the run or register themselves.”</p><p>“They can’t hide, at least, not if they want to use magic,” Arthur pointed out. “They’ll still have the Trace on them. The Ministry’ll be on them like bowtruckles on doxy eggs.”</p><p>“I know.” Ginny rubbed her forehead. “And we all know the Muggleborn Registration Commission’s a travesty—if they go in there, they’re not coming out again.”</p><p>“What do you want me to do?” His voice was mild, but he had the shrewd look in his eyes that told her he already knew what she was going to ask.</p><p>“Isn’t there anyone who can forge a family tree for them?” she asked. “Someone in the Order—one of Dung’s contacts—surely there are people doing it?”</p><p>Arthur looked grave. “It’s not something that can just be tossed off in a hurry,” he said. “I know a few people, but… the price is high. And there’s no guarantee it will work.”</p><p>“It’s more of a chance than they’ve got now.” Ginny met his eyes. “Dad, if there’s anything that can be done, we have to do it. You know that.”</p><p>He sighed and drew her into his arms, ruffling her hair. “Yes, Ginny, I do. Sometimes I wish…” He stood back, patted her shoulder, and smiled wanly. “I’ll do my best, Gin. I promise.”</p><p>“Thanks, Dad.” She gave him another quick hug and a warm smile, and headed back into the house. She had more letters to write.</p><p> </p><p>It was a couple of days later when Arthur called her downstairs. There were two strangers sitting at the kitchen table: a man and a woman. The man had skin a few shades darker than Harry’s, and light brown hair. His emerald green robes had a lot of embroidery on them, but Ginny could see the stains and worn places that the gold thread was meant to hide. The woman was white, bald, and wore hoop earrings, a leather jacket, and a shirt that showed her belly-button piercing. Ginny, remembering the fight she’d had with her mother the one time she’d bought a belly shirt, felt a little envious.</p><p>“Ginny, this is Xavier and Artemis, from the Records Office,” said Arthur. “Artemis, Xavier, my daughter Ginny.” He lowered his voice. “They may be able to assist the Creeveys.”</p><p>“Right.” Ginny dropped into a chair. “Let’s hear about it, then.”</p><p>The two strangers looked at each other, then at Arthur, as though making sure that they were really supposed to discuss an important matter like this with a teenage girl. Ginny tried to keep her face impassive, but her dad must have seen a warning sign, because he said hurriedly, “I believe it involves a few different steps, is that right?”</p><p>“Yeah,” said Artemis, after a moment. “Let’s start at the beginning. Do you know how the Records Office works?”</p><p>“I know that’s where they do the Apparition licenses and arrest records and stuff,” Ginny answered. “Do you keep genealogies, too?”</p><p>“Sort of.” Xavier tapped his fingers on the table, frowning slightly. “We have records of Hogwarts students—who entered, who graduated—and a lot of the pureblood families have their family trees registered with us. The newer families, immigrants, mixed-bloods—they don’t usually have their family trees down, but we do keep track of Wizarding households, businesses, and, as you said, Apparition licenses. So it’s not that hard to track someone down if you know where to look.”</p><p>“Why do you keep track of Wizarding households?”</p><p>“It’s for the Statute of Secrecy,” Arthur explained. “The Ministry has to know where magic-users are likely to be, in case of a breach.”</p><p>Ginny thought about this. “So what happens if someone’s not in the records? Say they never got an Apparition license, or something.”</p><p>“That can happen,” said Artemis, “but it doesn’t happen often. And under the new laws, if your relatives aren’t anywhere in our records, you’re going to have to be examined by the Muggle-born Registration Commission to make sure you aren’t... well, muggle-born.”</p><p>“How do we get around it?”<br/>
            Xavier’s eyes narrowed. “What makes you think there’s a way to get around it?”</p><p>“Why else would you be here?” Ginny retorted.</p><p>“Fair point.” Artemis leaned forward. “Here’s the deal. We can forge Apparition licenses and Wizarding household applications, so that when the Records Office makes a masterlist of—er—legitimate wizards—”</p><p>“Which it will,” interrupted Xavier.</p><p>“Whoever’s got parents, or at least close relatives, in the Apparition records, will be on it.”</p><p>“And no one will know?”</p><p>“Frankly, nobody is going to care,” said Xavier. “They don’t pay us enough for that, and half the Department has resigned in the past month. We’re understaffed and overworked, and the MRC is a massive headache for all of us. No one’s been through most of this stuff in ages. It’s not going to be noticeable.”</p><p>“We can do the forging, and get it into the Records with no one the wiser…” said Artemis.</p><p>“But it’s going to cost you.” Xavier looked over at Arthur. “A hundred Galleons per person. Up front.”</p><p>“That’s extortion!” Ginny cried.</p><p>“That’s business,” Artemis snapped. “Take it or leave it.”</p><p>“Ginny…” murmured Arthur. “It’s got to be up to the Creeveys. If it’s worth it to them…”</p><p>“Dad, their father’s a milkman, they don’t have this kind of cash. No one does.” Ginny felt ready to cry. For one glorious moment, she’d allowed herself to hope….</p><p>“Well, if you’re not interested….” Xavier pushed back his chair.</p><p>“Wait!” An idea flashed into Ginny’s mind. She leaned forward. “How hard is the actual forgery part?” she asked.</p><p>Artemis’s eyes narrowed. “Why do you ask?”</p><p>“If I did the forging—helped you with it—could you bring down the price? Say, by half?”</p><p>“Why would we want that?”<br/>
            “You already said you’re overworked.” Ginny’s heart was beating fast. It was hard to keep her voice calm. “Wouldn’t it be easier for you to just do the Records part? And fifty Galleons just for sneaking some documents in is pretty good. If you taught me how, I could do all the forging for free, and you’d be doing less than half the work.”</p><p>The other two looked at each other.</p><p>“How good’s your quillwork?” asked Xavier.</p><p>“Decent,” Ginny answered. She thought of Dean, whose drawings had been… well, magical… and felt a pang. “My ex-boyfriend taught me how to forge people’s handwriting. We used to do it for fun.”</p><p>“Ginny!” Arthur looked both amused and horrified.</p><p>“We didn’t ever use it,” said Ginny. “It was just a laugh. But I got pretty good at it.” Her forgeries, she thought, would have fooled Ron—and had, once, when she wrote him a note “from Lavender” for a laugh—or someone similarly unobservant, but Dean… Dean could have outwitted even McGonagall with his perfect copies. Right now, she would give a lot to have that gift. “I’m a quick learner,” she added. “I’m sure I can get it, if you just give me a chance.”</p><p>Another exchange of looks. Then Artemis said, slowly, “Alright. We can give you a trial run—but we’ll still want full payment up front. We can discuss a discount if your work is good enough.”</p><p>“But—” Ginny started.</p><p>“Fifty percent up front,” said Arthur, “And the rest in full if she can’t do the forgeries herself.”</p><p>“Seventy-five, and we’ll return twenty-five if she passes muster,” countered Xavier.</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>The two men shook hands, then Artemis and Xavier shook hands with Ginny, as well.</p><p>“We’ll be in touch,” Artemis told them. “Seventy-five Galleons a head, remember.”</p><p>Ginny had a sudden, vivid mental picture of the Elf-heads on the walls of Grimmauld Place, and suppressed a shudder. “I have to talk to Colin before anything’s final,” she said.</p><p>“Whatever.” The woman rose, and walked to the door. “Send us an owl when you suss it out. But don’t wait too long. I give it a couple of months, maybe three, before they’ve got the records straightened out and the forgeries’ll be a hell of a lot harder to sneak in.”</p><p>“I’ll be quick,” Ginny promised.</p><p>Xavier winked in a way that wasn’t at all reassuring. “Nice doing business with you.”</p><p>He followed Artemis out the door, and a moment later, Ginny heard the bangs of the two Disapparated.</p><p>Arthur gave a long sigh. “Well, that was… interesting.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She looked at him sidelong. “Sorry about… about dragging you into this, Dad.”</p><p>He shook his head. “Don’t be. It’s no madder than any of Dumbledore’s schemes.” There was a little silence; then he laid a hand on her shoulder, turning her so he could look her in the eye. “I’m proud of you, Gin,” he said seriously.</p><p>Ginny had never been one for crying, but now she could feel tears pricking her eyes. She turned her head away to hide them. “Thanks, Dad.”</p><p>He pulled her into a hug, rocking her a little, like he had when she was small, and it occurred to her how strange it was to be the last child at home; the house felt terribly empty with only three people in it, especially after being packed to the rafters for the wedding. She wondered if her parents felt the same.</p><p>“Alright.” Arthur pulled away, and gave her a rather watery smile. “We’d best get down to the village, so you can call Colin on the fellytone.”</p><p>“Telephone,” Ginny corrected. “Honestly, Dad, it’s like you get it wrong on purpose.”</p><p>Her father laughed. “And wouldn’t you like to know? Come on, I’ve got some Muggle money and everything.”</p><p>Ginny shook her head, and followed him outside.</p>
