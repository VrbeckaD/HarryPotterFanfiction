  <b>MOLEMAN'S EPIC RAP BATTLES!!!!!</b>
</p><p> </p><p><b>GWEN…</b> </p><p>...<b>VS</b><strong>…</strong></p><p>
  <b>…DARIA!!!!</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>BEGIN!</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Gwen:</b>
</p><p>Dear diary, I'd like to write about today,</p><p>And how I sent this whiny hipster bitch packing straight away!</p><p>I'll make this battle quick, seal your face with a kick,</p><p>Like the psycho killer. Come at me, Misery Chick!</p><p>You're a smug, obnoxious Mary–Sue,</p><p>And I'd rather share my quarters with Courtney than you!</p><p>Moping and doping, that's how all your time is spent.</p><p>And unlike you, I at least kissed <em>my</em> Trent!</p><p>You come from MTV? Your reputation must be poor,</p><p>When you share your station with Jersey–Fucking–Shore!</p><p>So run home, Diarrhea, go make out with Jane,</p><p>Before I take this shovel to your spine and break you like Bane!</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Daria:</b>
</p><p>I've got to be direct, Gwen: you're about to get smoked.</p><p>Your whole life, your whole world is just a sick, sad joke.</p><p>You think I still care the slightest bit about Trent?</p><p>Get with the times, and while you're at it, get bent.</p><p>I'm a philosopher, you're a pathetic trash–talker.</p><p>Need to know why I'm brilliant? Just ask Doug Walker.</p><p>Your time's spent suffering, fighting, all over a bad check,</p><p>And now, I'm looking forward to standing on YOUR neck.</p><p>I'll crush you like Tommy Sherman, bury you alive,</p><p>Pour drain cleaner down your throat and pass it off as suicide.</p><p>I'll maul you like a koala, and make your eyes swell.</p><p>In short: I'm Daria. Go to Hell.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Gwen:</b>
</p><p>What, that's all you got? Bitch please, your flow SUCKS!</p><p>Oh, and by the way, your breath reeks of Upchuck.</p><p>And why's your face always so plain? Here, I'll give it a makeover…</p><p>When I tear it to shreds like a rabid, screaming gopher!</p><p>You make Noah look active, you antisocial loafer,</p><p>And any relevance you ever had is long–since over!</p><p>What that Tom guy ever saw in you is a mystery to me,</p><p>But soon, like Mr. DeMartino's class...</p><p><strong>Mr. DeMartino:</strong> <em>YOu'Ll bE hIsTOrY!</em></p><p>I'm a nice person; you're cold, bitter and heinous.</p><p>You have no goals in your life, while I wanna be famous!</p><p>And on your life: think it sucks? Well, look what <em>I</em> have to go through!</p><p>"First World Problems" much, Daria? Girl, what the Hell is wrong with you?!</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Daria:</b>
</p><p>That's it, Shakespeare, leave the rhyming to me.</p><p>Your lines have so much shallowness, I mistook it for complexity.</p><p>And it's funny. After what you've been through, you should be dead.</p><p>I've seen safer behavior from Beavis and Butthead.</p><p>And you've nothing to show for it; no money, no fame,</p><p>So next season, just go straight to the Whatever–of–Shame.</p><p>You'll never be free from the sadistic games of Chris,</p><p>And you practically ruined your social life with one kiss.</p><p>While my love triangle was subtle and realistic,</p><p>You downright cheated, and let your "best friend" go ballistic.</p><p>You're just a slutty caricature; I <em>invented</em> cartoon drama.</p><p>So consider this loss your latest serving of karma.</p><p> </p><p>
