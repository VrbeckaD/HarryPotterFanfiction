    <p>his son's hair. Remus smiles back, swatting his father's hand away and giggling.<br/>
<br/>
"You'll be okay?" His father asks again for the fourth time in the last five minutes. He doesn't want to leave, but the Minister has sent an owl demanding to speak with him as soon as possible and John is in no position to refuse. He wants Rhea to be there, but she is off in Italy with her parents, and he doesn't know what to do with the number she had left him.<br/>
<br/>
The small boy nods, picking at the design stitched into the overstuffed chair he was curled up in. He hums some tune his mother often sings for him under his breath and is not at all worried. <br/>
<br/>
"I'll just be an hour," John repeats. "It won't be long," he promises. "Just have to go over some of the new werewolf legislation." He isn't sure why he was telling his son such a thing. Remus looks up at him, head crooked to the side. He is still smiling and humming and not at all bothered by his father's nervous babble. <br/>
<br/>
"They don't like the new tracking tattoos," He explains. "The werewolves. The ministry thinks it's brilliant, of course. A wonderful bit of magic." Rhea says he frightens Remus with all his talk of werewolves and giants and other such monsters, but Remus likes to play Vampire with him, and John thinks it more likely that his wife is scared than his son.<br/>
<br/>
"Mrs. Logan will be over in a minute," John says. He looks out the window for a sign of their Muggle neighbor. It was pouring down rain so thick he couldn't even make out the light from the full moon. "I have to go now."<br/>
<br/>
"Okay," Remus says, jumping off the chair to give his father a quick hug. "When you come back we should go swimming! I wanna swim in the rain."<br/>
<br/>
"We'll see," John says, knowing that Rhea would kill him. He leans down to ruffle Remus's hair again. "Be good, okay Remy?"<br/>
<br/>
Remus screws up his nose and sticks out his tongue. He hates that nickname. He hates it because his mom hates it. "It sounds French," She says, as though it's an insult to her Italian heritage. Remus looks a lot like his father, but when he wrinkles his noise John thinks of Rhea and chuckles. <br/>
<br/>
In what sounds like a clasp of thunder he's gone, leaving Remus alone to stare out the window at the dark, hunched figures prowling about in the rain.<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
It's raining the first time they go to the Hogwarts Express.<br/>
<br/>
Remus is scared and excited and overjoyed and terrified. On the car ride to King's Cross he makes his dad pull over so that he can throw up on the side of the road.<br/>
<br/>
His mother is simply terrified. She spends the last two days before the trip hugging Remus, telling him how proud she is, and crying in her room. When he gets sick she wants John turn the car around. For the rest of the ride she sits in the back with her son, trying not to cry.<br/>
<br/>
His dad is unreadable. "Rhea calm down," He says when she makes a grab for the clutch to swing the car in reverse. "It's going to be all right, Dumbledore said...."<br/>
<br/>
Remus had heard more of Dumbledore opinions over the last few weeks than he has of his father's.<br/>
<br/>
"You're wet," His mom is fussing over his hair as his dad tries to get his trunk into the train. Remus doesn't mind that he is the only one who needed help into the train or that his mother is nearly hysterical or that he is soaked through the bones. He is too amazed to be embarrassed or put off by any of this.<br/>
<br/>
Remus had never seen so many people. There seem to be at least ten thousand, all running around trying to get aboard the train as quickly as possible without getting wet and each as interesting to stare at as the last. There is a girl whose black dreadlocks were each charmed a different color and another one in Muggle clothes with the trousers' legs so huge they seem to swallow her whole. Two boys dart past them, one waving a shaken looking kneazle above his head as the other screams and chases him down. Another boy is standing not far from Remus, his cheeks a bright red as his mother shoves a basket of sweets into his hands and smothers down his thin blond hair.<br/>
<br/>
"I love you, Remus," He mom says, kissing him on the forehead.<br/>
<br/>
John runs a hand through what little hair is left. It's completely gray now. No one says it, but it's Remus's fault. "Take care." Remus would give anything to be called 'Remy' at this moment, or ever again. Instead he gets a pat on the shoulder. "Listen to whatever Dumbledore says and be careful."<br/>
<br/>
"Write us if you feel ill," His mother says. In the background a whistle blows. "I'll miss you so much."<br/>
<br/>
Remus is a little embarrassed by the hug. It looks like all the other kids are already aboard the train. Still, he hugs his mom back. "I'll miss you, too," He says as quickly as he can while still meaning it.<br/>
<br/>
When he's finally on the train, waving goodbye to his parents through the window, he realizes just how wet he is, and he wonders if he should try changing into his school robes right then.<br/>
<br/>
Before he can do anything, though, his compartment door is being swung opened and a face is popping in. The face is attached to a body, which is wearing a pair of emerald robes that don't look wet at all. "Hi," The boy says. The boy looks his age, but mostly dry and his clothes don't haves patch marks in the like Remus's do. His hair is black and short but still manages to look wild, like he had never combed it down in his life.<br/>
<br/>
"You're a first year." Remus nods. "Anyone else in here?" Remus shakes his head. "Kay, then." The young boy turns around. "Come on, this one's almost empty!"<br/>
<br/>
Before Remus can say anything there are people flooding in. Two girls and two boys pile in the compartment, chatting the whole time without much thought to Remus.<br/>
<br/>
"I need to change," Remus tries to say over the talking. He suddenly feels very small and shy, like a downed mouse.<br/>
<br/>
The first boy, the one with messy black hair, smiles. "Not a problem," He says, and before Remus can protest he's waving his wand and muttering something.<br/>
<br/>
An odd feeling sweeps through Remus's stomach. He shivers and the feeling is gone, but the water dripping from his bangs isn't. One of the girls starts laughing. The others follow very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
The young man blushes. "Ah...." He said, sticking his hand back in his pocket. "It worked for my dad, at least..."<br/>
<br/>
Remus has a very bad feeling. He sees one of the girls pointing and reaches up to touch his face. Nothing feels different. His noise, eyes, mouth, and ears are still attached which he takes as a good sign, but the other students are still laughing at him and Remus can feel his face start to burn.<br/>
<br/>
"I need to go," He mutters, looking at the ground as one of the girls squeals with delicious delight at something the other boy says.<br/>
<br/>
The young black haired boy stands between Remus and the door, but he's looking behind Remus at the two girls. "You two look a little wet," He says. The boy draws out his wand, waving it in their general direction. "I could always try and give it another a whirl."<br/>
<br/>
Before he has the chance both girls are up and running from the compartment, covering their faces as they make their exit. The boy who had said something about Remus earlier got up to follow, keeping his eyes on the black hair boy.<br/>
<br/>
"No sense of humor," He mutters as he walks by. The first boy rolls his eyes, stepping on the back of the other's robes. He waits until the other boy has fallen face first into a group of screaming third year girls to slam the door. <br/>
<br/>
"My names James Potter," The boy says.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm Remus Lupin." He has an odd feeling in the pit of his stomach, a lot like what had happened when the boy had tried that spell out on him. He can't tell if it is a good or bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
"Sorry about the... Err... coloring," James says. He bites his lips and tries not to smile. "I'm sure someone at the school can fix it. Hey, my mom packed me some chocolate frogs. You want a few?"<br/>
<br/>
James and Remus became fast friends.<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
It's raining during the first quidditch match.<br/>
<br/>
It's Slytherin verse Gryffindor. Remus hates flying. It makes his stomach twist in weird ways. He only does it when he has to, and he couldn't imagine doing it for sport, especially not in the rain.<br/>
<br/>
James makes him go, anyway. <br/>
<br/>
"What's happening!" Remus shouts over the cheers and screams from the stands. He didn't really understand quidditch, and even if he did he can't see a single thing in the air.<br/>
<br/>
"Slytherin scored!" James shouts back. "We're still in lead, but Philips might still get the snitch!"<br/>
<br/>
In the row in front of James and Remus and Peter (a small, mouse of a boy in their dorm who admire James like an older brother, hero, and father all rolled into one great package) is Sirius Black. James doesn't talk to Sirius because he says his family is of the worst sort of blood. He warns Remus not to let it slip that his mom is a Muggle in front of him. "If his father had his way, there wouldn't be in Muggle borns or Half Bloods at Hogwarts," James says. So Remus makes sure to avoid this Black fellow.<br/>
<br/>
The boy turns around, and through the rain Remus can see his eyes all a glow. "Watch this!" He shouts above the gale before straightening in his seat.<br/>
<br/>
James and Remus exchange a look. Peter fidgets until he's almost hidden behind James and safe from Sirius's eyes. The three boys watch as Sirius draws his wand. It's impossible to hear what he's saying over the storm, but his eyes are fastened on the Slytherin section of the stands.<br/>
<br/>
A gasp goes through the crowd. Remus tries to follow everyone else's pointing, but the rain in hitting his eyes and he can't make out anything more than vague shapes. He wipes his bangs out his eyes, shielding his vision from the storm enough that he can almost see two blurred figures diving downward. Down, down, down they go right over the Slytherin seats and - BOOM!<br/>
<br/>
Most of the crowd screams. Remus doesn't, but he does nearly topple over and behind him Peter does both. The Slytherin side of the stadium has exploded in a mess of red and gold. Fireworks are whizzing around the quidditch field, and the entire Slytherin student body looks as though someone has drowned them in thick, gooey paint<br/>
<br/>
Seconds later, Lauren Keller holds the golden snitch above her head. The paint covering the Slytherins are already starting to leak onto the field, staining the grass in Gryffindor colors.<br/>
<br/>
Sirius looks behind his shoulder at Remus. "What did you think? Rather clever, huh?" He asks, and Remus doesn't think he sounds like someone who would hunts werewolves for fun.<br/>
<br/>
James is doing a little dance in the stands. Most of the students are laughing. Teachers are hurrying over to the Slytherins to make sure everyone is okay. Gryffindors are hurrying down the stands to congratulate the team on their win. It's still raining, but no one seems to care.<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Remus wonders if it waits for the full moon to start to pour. <br/>
<br/>
Madam Pomfrey has him wrapped up in enough blankets that he can't feel a single rain drop. "I want you to put them up high," She says. "In case it's raining on the way back." Remus agrees, but he knows that if they smell even ever so slightly of human it won't matter how high up they are.<br/>
<br/>
She props open the trap door at the foot of the willow tree. "I have to hurry," She says. Remus nods again. It's the last night of this full moon and he just wants it over and done with.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll be okay," He says, taking the trap door from her. She doesn't look convinced. Remus slips down the trap door as quickly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
He takes a few steps before he hears the door shut behind him, followed by a light thud. He expects the Whomping Willow has woken back up and doesn't think to turn around until he hears his name being called. "Remus."<br/>
<br/>
He knows that voice.<br/>
<br/>
Remus swings around, dropping the blankets to the dirt. For a few seconds there is nothing there, then the sounds of fabric being brushed aside.<br/>
<br/>
James is in the front, of course, eyes wide and glasses somewhat askew. He looks terrified, his mouth half open like he's trying to find words that aren't there. Sirius is right beside him, his handsome face twisted with something Remus just knows is disgust and it makes him want to pick up the blankets and hide himself away forever. Peter is behind the other two, too short to see very clearly in the dark passage way but Remus can almost smell the fear, and that makes him even more upset because he hates the idea of his friend being afraid of him even more than he hates the fact that they're all going to hate him.<br/>
<br/>
"Remus," It's James again, taking a small step forward. His mouth opens and closes a few more times. He can't find the words because there are none.<br/>
<br/>
"Why didn't you-" Sirius sounds angry, and Remus can't help but let his mind flash back to what James had said about his family. He feels guilty the moment the thought crosses his mind. Sirius was not his family.<br/>
<br/>
But just because he wasn't his family didn't mean he likes werewolves. No one likes werewolves. Remus knows that much.<br/>
<br/>
"Get out," He cuts his friends off before they could say anything. He doesn't want to hear them and he doesn't want to explain. He wants to curl up in a ball and never move again. He wants to burry himself in blankets so the world can't see him. He wants to kill something, to rip out its throat and lick at its hot, warm blood, the soft body still moaning and trying to fight back beneath him.<br/>
<br/>
"Remus... You..." James still seems to think he can say something to fix what has happened. Remus watched his mother try this tactic a hundred times before. He already knows how it will end. <br/>
<br/>
"Get out!" Remus repeats himself, more frantically. This time something seems to get through. Peter yelps, his fists wrapping into James's sleeve.<br/>
<br/>
"I think he's changing!" Peter squeaks and Remus wants to scream. Wants to jump at him and bite and rip and tear and it would feel so good right then, to have that boy's throat in his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
"Right." James finally snaps out of it. He grabs Peter's hands, backing the two away slowly as if afraid that Remus will attack.<br/>
<br/>
Remus is afraid of the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
"We need to go." James pushes open the trap door and water pours in. Remus wants to feel the moonlight on his skin. He wants to taste something warm and still alive. He wants and needs, and with the last of his self control he runs, takes off for the shrieking shack as fast as he can, trying not to think about blood and meat and Sirius, standing just where he had left him with that look in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
It rained all of the next week, too.<br/>
<br/>
Remus tries to avoid them, and at first he does a fairly decent job. He sticks to the library and study groups. He avoids anything that might be considered fun at all cost.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, they eventually catch up with him.<br/>
<br/>
Remus plans to go to the library, but he catches James standing around the exit just in time to turn around to make a hasty retreat. He knows he couldn't head back to the Gryffindor Tower, Sirius is most likely up there, and Peter is sure to be at the Great Hall. So he just takes off.<br/>
<br/>
He marches out to the grounds without knowing where he's going. Without Madam Pomfrey's blankets or an umbrella over his head he is soaked through almost immediately. The water feels good against his skin, cooling the heat that had been bubbling up inside him. It's nice to be alone and not have to worry about James or Sirius or Peter coming to look for him. It's nice not to be anger at your best friends for finding out your secret. <br/>
<br/>
This sanctuary lasts all of three minutes.<br/>
<br/>
There's this myth that werewolves have better reaction times than 'normal' people. It's believed that they have super normal sense, the small blessing of a terrible curse.<br/>
<br/>
Remus finds out that this isn't true when, without warning, he's being tackled to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
He's not entirely sure what's happening. He lands on the ground with a soft thud, protected by the wet mud and grass. His hair is in his eyes along with the rain and wind and someone else hair and he has no idea what he's doing. For a moment he wonders if it's Snape, a Slytherin in their year that James is determined to pick a fight with at least once a day, but then there are fists in his side and he doesn't care who it is he is ready to fight back. He tries to get in a good hit, flailing and kicking and struggling under the weight that was crushing his chest.<br/>
<br/>
He might die, he decides. He might die and Sirius and James and Peter wouldn't care.<br/>
<br/>
"You're a fucking wanker, you know that?" The fists that are pounding against his skin let up. Remus is sputtering. He reaches up to brush his wet bangs away from his eyes. In the night with rain still pouring onto his face it's hard to make out much more that Sirius's scowl.<br/>
<br/>
"Hell," Remus says, pushing against Sirius's chest to move him. "What did you do that for?"<br/>
<br/>
"Because you're a giant fucking wanker," Sirius says it as though Remus should know this already. "And you needed some sense beaten into you."<br/>
<br/>
As irrational as it is, that offends Remus. He had always thought of himself as the sensible one in the group, when there had been a group. He wasn't the one who was stalking after his friends in the dark and pouncing on them without warning.<br/>
<br/>
"You're an idiot." Remus pushes against Sirius's chest again, squirming out from under the other boy as he does. Sirius stands up, letting Remus go free. Almost.<br/>
<br/>
"You've been avoiding us," He says. Remus is walking back towards the castle and Sirius is right on his heels. "You've been treating us like we're Slytherins or something."<br/>
<br/>
Remus isn't sure what to say. 'I'm sorry, you've found out my deepest, darkest secret and are probably afraid of me and hate me now, so I thought it best to just ignore you.' He wants to say it, but he's so angry and ashamed that he's jaw has clenched up and the words won't come out. He's not even sure why he's anger, only suddenly the rain is really annoying him and why was Sirius following him about like a lost puppy?<br/>
<br/>
"Go away, Black." Sirius scowls and makes a grab for Remus's shoulder. Remus jerks away and ends up being boxed in the chest.<br/>
<br/>
"Make me," Sirius dares him. They're facing each other now, Remus glaring and Sirius with a dangerous look on his face. "If you want me to leave you alone so bad than do something about it."<br/>
<br/>
Remus struggles to find something to say.<br/>
<br/>
Sirius takes his silences as a sign that everything is better. He punches Remus on the shoulder, but this time it isn't meant to hurt. "There we go," He says. "See. It's all much easier if you just give me my way."<br/>
<br/>
Remus raises an eyebrow. "What? Were you planning on stalking me if I kept ignoring you."<br/>
<br/>
"Imprison you, is more like it. I was going to turn your pumpkin juice into Slytherin jizz," Sirius says. "So that you'd get sick and rush to the bathroom. I figured I could get you cornered in there."<br/>
<br/>
Remus smiles. "You are an utter arse, Sirius Black."<br/>
<br/>
"Least I'm not a giant wanker," Sirius retorts.<br/>
<br/>
They walk back to the commons together, and everything seems better.</p><p>*</p><p>It was raining the first time Remus got kissed.<br/>
<br/>
It's a moth before end of term exams and everyone should have been outside enjoying their last free days before they have to start cramming. They should be, but they're not. The weather made sure of that. So all of Hogwarts is stuck inside the castle.<br/>
<br/>
Not all of them. James and Sirius were at quidditch practice. James had made team in third year, and Sirius became a beater this year. Both of them mutter and complain about the whole ordeal, but were all too happy to spend their weekend flying around in a storm.<br/>
<br/>
Peter is in the stand watching, even after Remus insists that he come study in the library with him.<br/>
<br/>
"What's the worry," James says. "You'll just be meeting up with Connor for defense help, right, and that's the only thing Peter's good at anyway." Remus gives James a look that means Peter's education is more important than James having someone at practice to cheer him on. James doesn't get it.<br/>
<br/>
"And divinations," Peter pips up.<br/>
<br/>
James rolls his eyes. "But anyone can do go at divinations, Peter. All you have to do is pretend is talk about death and changing and stuff."<br/>
<br/>
"I predict that Lallin will die of a panic attack if we don't get to the field soon," Sirius had said, twirling his brand new Comet around so that Remus and Peter constantly have to move a little to avoid being smacked.<br/>
<br/>
"I predict that one day you'll change your underwear," Remus says before pinching his nose in disgust. "Obviously that day has yet to come."<br/>
<br/>
James, Sirius, and Peter hurry off to quidditch practice and Remus has to gather his books and meet Adair Connor at the library.<br/>
<br/>
"I think at least half the school is here." Connor was a Ravenclaw in their year. He asked Remus for help with defense against the dark arts after receiving a seven on his last paper. Remus, always one for any excuse to read up on his favorite subject, had readily agreed.<br/>
<br/>
"Professor Lupin," Sirius jokes. "Always ready to help those more unfortunate then yourself."<br/>
<br/>
"Seems like it, doesn't it," Remus replies, looking up from the textbook to glance around the library. Madam Pince is buzzing around a number of tables trying to quiet some of the groups of chatting students. So far she has done fairly well, but from the exhausted look on the librarian's face she isn't up for much more of these rainy days.<br/>
<br/>
"I can't concentrate at all!" Connor sighs, flicking his wand and muttering something. The pages of the book flip to the next chapter. "I don't suppose you want to go somewhere more quiet?"<br/>
<br/>
Remus shrugs. "Sure." He sends a quick glance at the window. The rain hasn't let up yet, and he wonders if James and Sirius have been let off practice early. He thinks that even if they did, they wouldn't want to come find him in the library anyway as that would mean actually studying instead if simply relying on their natural brilliance. "Where did you have in mind?"<br/>
<br/>
That's how Remus ends up in the back corner of the library, pressed up against Adair Connor at a one-person table far away from the rest of the students.<br/>
<br/>
"This is my favorite chapter," Remus says, pointing to the title 'The Mislabeling of Certain Beast as Dark Creatures'. "Groban is a genius, you know. Talks about how you can't really divide animals into good or... is something wrong?"<br/>
<br/>
Connor had this glazed look in his eyes. He was staring into space with that same vacant expression Remus had caught more than once on James' face. "I'm fine," He says, coughing and wiggling in his seat a little. "Yeah... Um... That chapter's really fascinating."<br/>
<br/>
"It is," Remus isn't convinced that Connor had been paying any attention, but he doesn't press the matter. "If you have somewhere to be-"<br/>
<br/>
Connor shakes his head. He is still wiggling in his seat. "No. Look, Remus... Don't take this the wrong way but has anyone ever told you that you look like a girl?"<br/>
<br/>
Remus wonders how one could take that the right way. "No."<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, well... You know Sandra Jabian?"<br/>
<br/>
"The fifth year?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah. That's her." Connor pauses again. "You have her hair."<br/>
<br/>
Remus has to stop himself from touching his hair. He has brown, goldish locks that had once been cut properly short before he'd meant Sirius and James and haircutting had become something of the past. Now it tickled the back of his neck and he was constantly tugging at it to move the bristle ends out from under his robe collar. Sandra had golden hair that was long enough to get stuck in her pants and looked like it might be made out of strands of braided silk.<br/>
<br/>
"What do you mean?" Remus says as slowly as he can. "That I look like a girl?"<br/>
<br/>
"Not a pretty girl!" Connor interjects. "I mean. Sandra's pretty, and if you were a girl I guess you would be but... Well, you're skinny like a girl. And you're all quiet and you like to read."<br/>
<br/>
Remus is being told he liked to read by a Ravenclaw.</p><p>mean. Sandra's pretty, and if you were a girl I guess you would be but... Well, you're skinny like a girl. And you're all quiet and you like to read."<br/>
<br/>
Remus was being told he liked to read by a Ravenclaw.<br/>
<br/>
"I mean, I don't think girls would get half as many detentions as you," Connor adds. "And I don't think they'd try and charm Mcgonagall's desk to take points away from Slytherin like you did. So you're not really a girl."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm glad we can agree on that." Remus looks back down at the book hoping that Connor would get the hint and drop the subject.<br/>
<br/>
"You do kind of look like Sandra, though."<br/>
<br/>
Remus temporally thinks about charming Connor silent, but then Madam Pince might make him do the whole library and he doesn't have the time. <br/>
<br/>
Instead he just gives a loud, irritated sigh. "Connor?" He hopes he sounded as thoroughly annoyed as he feels. "What are you going on about?"<br/>
<br/>
Connor's lips were hot and wet and sort of crushed against his like he is trying to eat Remus's mouth or something equal as gruesome. It's so unexpected and disgusting that it took a moment for it to register as a kiss.<br/>
<br/>
"What the hell are you doing!" Remus didn't know he could hit someone that hard. Connor goes reeling back, and if there hadn't been a wall there he would have gone tumbling from his seat.<br/>
<br/>
"Fuck!" He yells, rubbing the back of his head where it connected with the hard stone. Remus is already out of his chair, gathering all his things as quickly as possible. He doesn't look back when Connor starts yelling something at his back. He just keeps wlaking, resolved not to stop until he gets to his dorm. <br/>
<br/>
Sirius, James, and Peter are standing around the transfiguration section of the library, flipping through a couple books. The moment Remus came into view Peter starts pulling on James' sleeve, helping him to stuff the books back into the shelves.<br/>
<br/>
"Remus!" Sirius jumps out in front his friend. It was that point when Remus notices them.<br/>
<br/>
"Sirius," He tries to sound like another boy hadn't almost stuck his tongue down Remus's throat. "Is practice over all ready?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, got out early," He says, running a hand through his still wet black hair. Behind him Peter and James are trying not to get noticed. "We came looking for you. Done with Connor?" Sirius sends a few not so subtle glances over his shoulder to the other two Gryffindor boys as a couple of the books they'd been reading toppled out of the shelves.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes!" Remus wonders if he had said that too quickly. "Yes," He repeats, a lot slower this time. "I think I should be going to bed. James? Peter? I didn't see you two there."<br/>
<br/>
James smiles. "We were just picking up some reading to help Peter with his... um... transfiguration exams."<br/>
<br/>
"Right," Peter nods vigorously. "We all know how horrid I am in transfigurations. All the help I can get. In fact, I might have to come down to the library every day to- OWE!" James's heel comes down hard on Peter's foot.<br/>
<br/>
In his daze, Remus doesn't notice.<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
<br/>
It was raining the first time they told him.<br/>
<br/>
"You look like a wet dog." <br/>
<br/>
Remus doesn't think there was anything funny about this, but James, Sirius, and Peter can't breath they're laughing so hard.<br/>
<br/>
Remus sits on the edge of his bed, book propped open his lap. He waits patiently for his friends to get their wits about them, which could take years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is three days until the full moon and he feels worse for the wear. So while the other boys were running around enjoying their Saturday, Remus stays in bed. From the looks of their wet clothes and huge smiles that can only mean trouble, this might have been a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
"Funny you should say that." Sirius spreads himself across the sheets like Remus had not gone through all the trouble of making sure they were clean and well made. "I am kinda dog like, huh?"<br/>
<br/>
"A total dog," Remus agrees. He has no idea what they are talking about, but has found that it makes life much more easier if one simply agrees with Sirius on every matter when he was smiling like he was now.<br/>
<br/>
"But Moony," Sirius uses the nickname James had given the werewolf side of him. 'How was Moony tonight?' He asks after Pomfrey would allow them to visit him in the infirmary. James had taken to asking the oddest questions. 'Was he bad? Did it hurt? Did you kill any rats? Do you ever kill rats?"<br/>
<br/>
Sirius smiles and, without warning, grabs hold of Remus's face and licks him across the cheek. A huge, slobber lick that elicits a chorus of moans and 'gross!' from the other three boys. Remus pulls back, swatting at Sirius as he uses the sleeve of his robe to wipe away his friend's spit. "What the bloody hell?"<br/>
<br/>
Peter is beside him now, and Remus can't remember seeing him this full of energy. "Can we tell him now?" He asks. He keeps bouncing on the balls of his feet in a way that is starting to make Remus a bit dizzy.<br/>
<br/>
"It's a surprise!" James claims. He has his chin up in the air, which means he's done something of which he is usually proud of himself for. Remus's stomach jumps a few times. The last time he saw that look the Snape was left in the hospital wing for a full two days.<br/>
<br/>
"Fuck surprises," Sirius says. He is still on Remus's bed, though his arms have fallen away from Remus's face and around his shoulders. Remus can feel the rainwater seeping in through his robes.<br/>
<br/>
"How do you suggest we tell him then," James asks. "We can't just come out with it, can we? The poor boy will have a heart attack."<br/>
<br/>
"Tell me what?" Remus asks. He fidgets around a bit, trying to hide his excitement. James is all smiles and hand motions, and Remus wants to be in on the joke.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll have a heart attack if we don't let it out soon," Sirius replies. He's still hugging Remus, and now he's leaned in close enough that he's nearly snuggling against his neck. Remus tries scooting closer to Peter, who is still acting like a bundle of nerves.<br/>
<br/>
"What are you two going on about?" Remus asks.<br/>
<br/>
Sirius laughs and hugs Remus around the shoulders, really hugs him so that Remus is leaning into him and no blood is getting into his arms. "We've gotten you a gift," he says.<br/>
<br/>
"What sort of gift would give me a heart attack?" Remus is surprised he can speak with Sirius trying to squeeze the air out of him.<br/>
<br/>
"Why would we give you a heart attack?" Peter asks.<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah," Sirius nods. "We like our Moony. We don't want him dead."<br/>
<br/>
Remus doesn't know how much longer he can stand the cryptic talk and strangling hugs when James comes to his rescue. "I think Remus is going to have a heart attack if you keep molesting him, Sirius," He says, wrapping a hand around Sirius's collar. "Bad dog!"<br/>
<br/>
All three boys laugh again. Remus rubs his shoulders, bruised from Sirius's tight squeeze. "Are you drunk?" He asks James.<br/>
<br/>
"No... Not really. Not in a good old sense, anyway." James was back to making as little sense as the rest of them. "I think its just Sirius. It was the first time he'd managed it almost all the way, all though it only lasted a few seconds. I can do it for a whole minute, though Peter says my coat shouldn't be made of black, mangy hair."<br/>
<br/>
"Mine should!" Sirius pips. He's lying back of Remus's bed, the comforter growing darker under him as the water from his clothes spread out. "Mangy, black dog!"<br/>
<br/>
Remus closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. "This gift?" He asks. "Did you get me a dog, by chance?"<br/>
<br/>
All three of them begin laughing again.<br/>
<br/>
*<br/>
It was raining after their first night together.<br/>
<br/>
"That was...."<br/>
<br/>
The boys lay completely still in the middle of the clearing. Remus thinks they need to be heading back to the shrieking shack before Madam Pomfrey finds him missing, but he can't make himself move. The rain, it's more of a light sprinkle really and it feels so good on his skin. Almost as good as it feels to be lying on the muddy, wet grass in the middle of the Forbidden Forest after the full moon.<br/>
<br/>
"That was wonderful!" James supplies the word Remus was missing. Remus nods, but really he doesn't think wonderful covers everything.<br/>
<br/>
"Did you see that jump?" James asks. "Peter," He turns to his right, nudging Peter in the side. Peter grunts, still out of breath and covered in a thin layer of sweat and rain. "Did you see that jump? Did you SEE me? It was like flying! Just like flying!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"We get it, James," Sirius says. He's got his eyes closed. Remus squints his eyes and through the veil of drizzle bouncing off Sirius's skin it almost looks as though he's friend is surrounded by a halo. "You like to jump."<br/>
<br/>
"At least I didn't try and sniff Moony's ass," James retorts.<br/>
<br/>
Remus snorts as Sirius flails his arms about, trying to hit James without actually moving. "You tried to sniff my ass?"<br/>
<br/>
"Only once," Sirius replies. He looks over at Remus with a smile that would have scared Remus in his first year. "What can I say, you have a cute ass. Very round and firm and-"<br/>
<br/>
"Furry," James says. "You have a very furry ass."<br/>
<br/>
"At least," Remus says. "My furry ass is only when I'm a wolf." He twists his head to smile at James and feels something heavy slip away from him. It's the first time he's really consciously referred to himself as a wolf.<br/>
<br/>
"What's your excuse, James?" Sirius asks. James picks up a rock and tosses it at Sirius. It lands on Remus's belly, and suddenly Remus is reminded that despite being surrounded by all his friends it doesn't stop the moon from making him feel as though he has been properly cursed this way and back.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm going to be sick," He announces, clutching his bruising stomach and launching himself onto his knees just in time.<br/>
<br/>
"That's gross," Sirius says, and Remus feels a nice warm robe wrap around his shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
"We should probably get back before Pomfrey," Peter says. He's standing close enough that Remus can use his shoulder to help pull himself off the ground.<br/>
<br/>
James was standing by the edge of the clearing looking around. "Does anyone know how we got here?" He asks.<br/>
<br/>
All four boys fall silent for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Peter breaks it with, "Bullocks."<br/>
<br/>
James looks over at Sirius. "I'm not guessing you've been trained as a tracking dog."<br/>
<br/>
Sirius snaps. "I know I should have taken 'Survival Skills for Illegal Animagi'. I mean, who needs charms?"<br/>
<br/>
"Guys?" Peter asks. He looked over his shoulders past the dark crowd of trees that seemed to be boxing the boys into the clearing. "We should try and get back now."<br/>
<br/>
"We ARE trying!" James sounds stressed. He scratches the back of his head and tries not to make eye contact with anyone. "We just need to remember where we came from, that's all."<br/>
<br/>
"Maybe you could smell the wolf," Remus suggests to Sirius. He is shaking, even with his friend's robes wrapped around him.<br/>
<br/>
Sirius shrugs. "I guess it's worth a try," He says, but he doesn't look up to it. Remus remembers James mentioning that it was still exhausting for the other two, transforming back and fourth. He thinks of it like he thinks about his transformations and how they leave him unable to walk straight and sick to the stomach. He doesn't want to ask any of them to try that again.<br/>
<br/>
Sirius looks down at his feet and Remus is about to tell him that, no, they'd find another way when his face lights up. "Hey, what about these?" He asks, pointing at the floor. "Can't we follow these... Pronged things?"<br/>
<br/>
James and Peter hurry over to where the other two boys are standing.<br/>
<br/>
"They're hoof marks," Remus explains. "From James."<br/>
<br/>
"Pronged things," James scoffs. Now that they're not as lost he seems much more cheerful.<br/>
<br/>
"You know what I meant," Sirius says, smiling as he steps around the stag's footprints. "Come on, then. We're following the pronged things."<br/>
<br/>
"Hoof prints," James corrects.<br/>
<br/>
"Following the pronged thing," Sirius repeats. "Pronged-prongy prong!" He uses a singsong voice and James is scowling at his back, stalking after Sirius.<br/>
<br/>
Remus shakes his head and starts after the two. He makes it about four steps before tripping. "Are you all right?" Peter asks. In the background Sirius is calling James a mule and James is yelling about fleas.</p><p>"I'm fine," Remus says without even thinking. He picks himself off the ground and brushes off his bruises knee, ignoring the sting in his bleeding palms. Peter gives him a skeptical look.<br/>
<br/>
"All right," He answers, walking off to catch up with the other two.<br/>
<br/>
A few seconds later James is by his side. Remus is shaking so badly he can't even be mad at Peter for telling on him.<br/>
<br/>
"I think I might transfigure," He says. "Just to show Sirius what a real stag looks like."<br/>
<br/>
"All right," Remus says. He's having a hard time working his voice and his feet at the same time. James doesn't point out how unsteady he is.<br/>
<br/>
"Want to help me get back at that arrogant prick?" James asks. Remus gives a weak nod. "Climb on, okay?"<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, Peter and Sirius were passed by a boy on back of a stag. </p><p>*</p><p>rain should have been illegal for, but that didn't matter to the rain.<br/>
<br/>
"I can't go to Hogsmeade this weekend," Alastair says. <br/>
<br/>
Remus looks up from his book called 'Wizarding Wars Around The World'. "Why not?" <br/>
<br/>
"I promised Slughorn that I'd help with something," He replied. Remus nods. Professor Slughorn was constantly asking people for certain things. James says it was just so he could burry his claws deeper into their skin and suck out all their talent and life. Sirius says James was just mad because Lily Evans took some Hufflepuff boy to one of his parties last month.<br/>
<br/>
Alastair is one year above Remus and his friends. He is one of the few Gryffindors that appreciates spending quiet time in the library, which was how he and Remus had meant in the first place. He had asked Remus out about two months ago, and they had been dating ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Dating was a strong term for it. More like snogging in the dark corners of the library and studying together without their louder friends around to distract them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Well," says Remus, shutting his book. "I guess I'll see you around."<br/>
<br/>
"Right," Alastair seems relieved to see Remus taking it so well. "I'll see you Monday, all right?"<br/>
<br/>
"All right." Remus slips his books into his bags and starts walking towards the dorms.<br/>
<br/>
He tells himself he isn't disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
Boys don't like Valentine's Day, he reminds himself. It was over romantic, and it was cheesy, and the whole thing was about giggling girls and perfumed air and hairy little men in togas, none of which were appealing to Remus. Even if Alastair hadn't been busy, it wouldn't have been a date-date and so there was no reason for Remus to feel upset. <br/>
<br/>
Still, he remembers his father taking him to the werewolf registry and the look of horror in people's eyes as he passed them by. He remembers lying up at night thinking about how disgusting Adair Connor was and how he couldn't stop jerking off to the thought of another boy's lips on his own. He remembers thinking that he was always going to be alone, because no one can love a monster. He remembers thinking that he'll make himself die alone because no one should have to love a pervert.<br/>
<br/>
Still, Valentine's Day is for girls and Remus tells himself he isn't disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
"Why are you here?" Sirius is sprawled out on his own bed. He is wearing a pair of black robes that aren't his school robes and seem to fit him better. Remus resists the urge to reach out and touch the fabric; already knowing it would be much to soft under his fingers. "Aren't you out celebrating Valentine's Day?"<br/>
<br/>
Sirius snorts. "Valentine's Day is for girls," he says. Remus nods in agreement. It is for girls. Not for boys, not matter how excited they were about it.<br/>
<br/>
"I though you had a date," He says. He remembers Pricilla Dresdun talking about how she and Sirius were going to Hogsmeade for Valentine's Day this weekend. She sat in front of him for Arithmancy and spent every day talking to him about how wonderful Sirius is and how much he liked her. Sirius, for his part, treated her the same as he did before they were dating. Only every now and then he would snog with her in a corridor. Remus didn't really notice much of a change.<br/>
<br/>
"I don't want to," Sirius says. "She's annoying. She never shuts up. All she does is talk talk talk."<br/>
<br/>
"I thought you liked that," Remus says. "You broke up with Clementine because she was too shy and never spoke up."<br/>
<br/>
"Exactly," Sirius says. "I thought she never talked because she had better things to do with her mouth. She didn't."<br/>
<br/>
Remus doesn't say anything. He liked Clementine. She was a sweet Hufflepuff in their year, very nice and well read. Her only fault was that she had a huge crush on Sirius.<br/>
<br/>
"Anyway," He says, determined to change the subject to protect what was left of Clementine's honor intact between the two boys. "So you called off your date with Pricilla?"<br/>
<br/>
"I told her I believed deeply in divinations," Sirius says with a completely straight face that Remus find eerie. "And that anyone who kisses on a rainy Valentine's Day is doomed to forever be trapped in a series of heart breaking relationship and that I didn't want to put either of us in danger."<br/>
<br/>
Remus takes a moment to digest all of this. "You're an arse, you know that?"<br/>
<br/>
"But at least I'm not an arse who is on a date with Pricilla Dresdun." Sirius bites his lower lip and starts chewing it over, a sign that he's feeling down. Remus recognizes it easily, because it seems to always happen when they're talking about girls. No matter how sweet the girl Sirius always seemed weary of her attention and usually ended up being too nervous to have more than four or five dates. He has a feeling that it has something to do with Sirius's mom.<br/>
<br/>
"What are you planning on doing today then," Remus asks. "If you're not kissing anyone?"<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know," Sirius admits. "I guess we could go down to Hogsmeade anyway." As an after thought he adds, "Unless you've a date."<br/>
<br/>
Remus shakes his head. "I have nothing better to do then follow you around."<br/>
<br/>
"It's a date, then," Sirius says and hops out of bed.<br/>
<br/>
Half an hour later Sirius is balancing a bottle of butterbeer on his nose. At least he's trying to, and making a bit of a fool out of himself.<br/>
<br/>
"You're making a bit of a fool out of yourself," Remus says, twirling his own mug of coco around, creating little circles of light and dark chocolate on the surface.<br/>
<br/>
"Am not," Sirius says, but he takes the bottle of his face anyway. "Where do you suppose everyone else is?"<br/>
<br/>
"That new love café," Remus says without even thinking about it. They both know that nearly every couple in Hogwarts bypassed The Three Broomsticks and headed over to Madam Puddifoot's, a small romantic getaway in the middle of Hogsmeade. Or so the girls claimed. Remus hadn't gotten close enough to see, but to him it looks liked a giant sore thumb sticking out of the town with a pretty pink ribbon tied around it.<br/>
<br/>
"Right," Sirius says. Remus can tell he's starting to get bored, and a bored Sirius is never a rule-following, not-get-the-newly-elected-Prefect-Remus-a-detention Sirius. "This is boring." Remus winces, and wonders if he must be right about this sort of thing all the time. <br/>
<br/>
"Where's James?" Remus asks, trying to distract his friend from doing something Remus would regret later.<br/>
<br/>
"He convinced Jillian Urson to take him to Slughorn's Valentine Party," Sirius says with a snort. Sirius hates Slughorn with a passion, even though their potion's teacher is rather fond of Sirius. Rather, he is fond of the amount of talent Sirius has shown. "Apparently Evans is going and refused to take him."<br/>
<br/>
"Not surprising," Remus says. "James must hate whoever Lily went with."<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah. I thought he was going to kill Malstrom."<br/>
<br/>
Something in Remus's stomach turns. He sets down his coco and tells himself it's probably heartburn from the biscuits him and Sirius had shared. They had tasted a little off. "Malestrom?" He repeats. "You mean Alastair Malestrom in sixth year?"<br/>
<br/>
"How many Malestroms do you know?" Sirius roles his eyes, and that sick feeling Remus has starts again double fold. "Of course, it's a bit of a shock. Didn't mention it until today," Sirius says. "Probably knew James would kill him. Shame. Always thought Malestrom was a good guy."<br/>
<br/>
"He's always seemed like a bit of a bastard to me." Remus hopes his voice doesn't shake.<br/>
<br/>
"Funny," Sirius says, cocking his head to the side as if trying to study Remus. Remus tips back his mug of coco to hide himself from Sirius. "He reminded me a bit of you. Always figured you two got along. Don't you both spend a load of time in the library together."<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah," Remus answers as deadpan as he could manage. Unfortunately this required lowering his cup and now Sirius was staring at him again. "You think Jillian will drag James down to that new café afterwards?" He asks, hoping the subject change wasn't too blatant. <br/>
<br/>
Sirius snorts. His dislike of all things romantic was stronger than his urge to quiz Remus. "Puddifoot? What kind of name is that, anyway?"<br/>
<br/>
"I think it's a last name." Remus says, but Sirius isn't listening.<br/>
<br/>
"It sounds so stupid. Puddifoot. Like Puddle-Foot it Patty-Foot or Pud-Foot."<br/>
<br/>
"That makes no sense," Remus says.<br/>
<br/>
"Or Puw-Foot or Paw-foot. Like a dog. Who names a romantic restaurant after a dog?"<br/>
<br/>
Remus shrugs. "I don't know. I think dogs are lovable enough."<br/>
<br/>
Both boys fall quite.<br/>
<br/>
Remus bites his tongue, something he wishes he could have done earlier now. Sirius is just sitting there was a very unreadable look on his face which is only making Remus even more nervous. "We should probably head back now," He suggests.<br/>
<br/>
Sirius shakes his head. "Look outside," He says. Remus turns around and sees that outside the pub the storm has only gotten worse since he and Sirius had arrived. "We'll just wait until it calms down a little."<br/>
<br/>
"We could use an umbrella spell," Remus says. "Besides, how do you know it's going to calm down? We could be here all night."<br/>
<br/>
Sirius shrugs, downing the last of his butterbeer. "Then we shall be here all night!" He declares, standing up and slamming down his empty bottle to add some conviction in his words. Remus winces as half the pub turns to stare at the two boys. <br/>
<br/>
Sirius doesn't notice the attention or doesn't feel up to basking in it at the moment. "I'm going to go play a round of chess," Sirius said, motioning over to the two tables was the broken bits of old wizarding chess pieces sat. "Coming?"<br/>
<br/>
Remus shrugged. "Sure," He replies, standing up and brushing off his robe. He uses the time not to think about what he had said or about Alastair and Lily or about the weird looks Sirius has been giving him. "You know I'm going to win, though."<br/>
<br/>
"I know," Sirius says, managing to look cheerful about the prospects of loosing.<br/>
<br/>
"Let the record show that you have accepted your inevitable defeat," Remus teases. "And hereby surrender all rights to whining and/or rematches in the face of lose."<br/>
<br/>
Sirius smiles, leaning over the table until the two boys were inches apart. He is wearing a dangerous smile. One Remus has come to associate with the screams of girls running from bathrooms and teacher's yelling from down the hall. "For the record," He says. "whatever it is. I think wolves are rather lovable as well."<br/>
<br/>
For the first time in years Sirius beats Remus at chess.</p>
