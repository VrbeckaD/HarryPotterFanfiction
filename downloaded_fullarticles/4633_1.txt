<p dir="ltr">Lily shows first blatant signs of magic, scaring the hell out of her parents. She and Petunia watched a cartoon where a character had his tail stuck in a light socket, and Lily thought it was hilarious. Her parents come upstairs to find Lily, hair puffed out like crazy, flashing different colors with her little finger in the socket.</p>

  <em>January 30 (Lily's birthday):</em>
</p>
<p>Lily gets a music box with a ballerina on it. Money has been tight, and this was her grandmother’s. It gives it sentimental value, and she knows it, but it doesn’t change the fact that Lily is seven and wants stuff. She climbs up on top of the garage, her favorite perch, and sits with the music box’s tinkling music, and the ballerina begins to move, dancing for her.</p>
<p>
  <em>July: </em>
</p>
<p>By this time, Lily has learned that she can make things move, and in a fit of pique at Petunia, who wouldn’t give her a record she wanted, she purposefully removes it from her hands with magic. They all stare at her, because when things like this happen, the lights flicker and her hair flies and stuff, but she’s calm. Her mother reprimands her for doing that on purpose.</p>
<p>“Imagine if someone had seen! Your… talent, Lily, dear, it’s not normal. You can’t let people know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t do it when there are people around! Usually…”</p>
<p>“Lily! How long has this been going on?”</p>
<p>“Erm… a while. M-my birthday?”</p>
<p>“It stops, here and now. It’s not rig- not safe. You’re not to do it any longer.”</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“Lily.” Her father now. “Listen to your mother.”</p>
<p>“I… yes, mum.”</p>

  <em>February:</em>
</p>
<p>A freezing, slush-covered Severus shows up at the Evans’ home asking if he can stay a bit. Lily doesn’t ask questions, but after some prying from Petunia and her mother, he lets slip that his alcoholic father had thrown a chair through the window and kicked Sev out. He’s given a standing invitation to the Evans’ house.</p>
