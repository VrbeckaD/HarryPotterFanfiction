          <div class="userstuff"><p>He wears black clothes<br/>
and shiny rings<br/>
Hair like white gold in his eyes<br/>
Magnetic </p><p>He knows the effect he has on people<br/>
The grudging hate, the reluctant fascination<br/>
He plays with fire </p><p>You can see how the war changed him<br/>
Not just the remorse,<br/>
Not just the repentance,<br/>
But the <em> freedom</em><br/>
Everyone acts as though they don’t give a fuck<br/>
As though they’re above what people think<br/>
Yet he’s the only one who lives by it </p><p>There are other wizards like you in this world but<br/>
They pretend they can’t see it<br/>
No one talks about it<br/>
No one wants to acknowledge it<br/>
Doing so would make it real </p><p>No one <em> comes out </em></p><p><em> Wizard with wizard is an abomination</em><br/>
Preserve the line,  they say<br/>
<em>Don’t let the magic die</em> </p><p><em> Well I’m not asking for permission, </em>his shiny rings say<br/>
<em>I’m not expecting your blessing, </em> his silk-lined robes sing<br/>
because<br/>
I may never get it from you<br/>
And I’m still going to live </p><p>They call after him in the corridors at school<br/>
<em>Pretty boy, hey pretty boy, </em> they taunt him<br/>
<em>No need to rub it in our faces</em> </p><p>He wears <em> pretty boy </em> like a badge<br/>
And you clench your fists </p><p>He’s like a whirlwind<br/>
And you’re a leaf<br/>
Swiftly caught in his wake<br/>
He’s the snake charmer<br/>
And you’re the serpent in his hands<br/>
Woken from your sluggish dream by the song of him </p><p>He wraps himself in colorful scarves<br/>
Violet and blue and green and bright floating behind him<br/>
He wears splashes of pink in his white hair<br/>
A provocation<br/>
A beacon and a lodestar<br/>
And you can’t help but stare </p><p>He catches your eye in class and smiles<br/>
Shiny—white—feral</p><p><em> You’re like me, </em>his gaze seems to</p><p>Whisper</p><p>Entice</p><p>Back you into a corner</p><p>
  <em> You’re like me, Potter, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Come and be free. </em>
