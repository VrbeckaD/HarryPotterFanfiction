    <p>Deracinate - to isolate or alienate from a native or customary culture or environment. To pull up by the roots; uproot; extirpate; eradicate.</p><p>Draco Malfoy had always been told that the world would be his.  That whatever he wanted, he would get. And until his first day of Hogwarts, that had been true.  Thinking about it now, it only seemed fitting. He had wanted Potter then, and he wanted him now. It wasn’t <em> quite </em> the same, but the comparison still stood.</p><p>And from that very first day, Potter had wanted nothing to do with him.  Nothing at all.</p><p>He had refused Draco’s hand on that first night of Hogwarts. Now, back in their final year of Hogwarts after betrayal and savings and hurt and pain and <em> war -- </em> Draco took a breath -- after all of that, it was no wonder that Potter wanted nothing to do with Draco or his lot.  </p><p>Potter wasn’t rude, but he wasn’t kind.  Draco should’ve known better than to expect something different.  But when Potter had testified at his trial, hope -- stupid, stupid hope -- had blossomed in his chest.  If Potter didn’t think he deserved to be in Azkaban then maybe this new life he had to build wouldn’t be automatically forfeit.  But they returned to school and Potter had ignored him. His eyes would pass over Draco as if he didn’t know him. Didn’t have <em> eight </em> years of history with him.  Didn’t shape every aspect of Draco’s life for those past eight years.  Hadn’t responded to Draco so addictingly dynamic. Hadn’t carved out a part of himself into Draco’s chest.  It was as if he and the other returning students in Slytherin simply didn’t exist to Potter.</p><p>Potter’s eyes used to stray over to the Slytherin table habitually.  It was what made him such an easy target for Draco. The second they made eye contact, Draco could quirk an eyebrow, and Potter would already be working himself up into a fit of imagined slights.  </p><p>Draco can’t remember the last time Potter looked at him.  And, Merlin, wasn’t that pathetic. That he was still trying to win Potter’s attention. Eight years.  Eight years Draco had been fishing for this acknowledgement. This <em> approval. </em>  </p><p>He frowned down at his plate and pushed his food around despondently.  Not exactly behavior fit for the only Malfoy heir, but no one was around to see it.  Only Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson had returned from their year, and they had refused to associate with him since the start of term. And all the younger years were too afraid.  Either of him or what associating with him would bring from other classmates. All the students gave him a wide berth.</p><p>It had been a long couple of months. Alone and ridiculed and abused.</p><p>He pushed his uneaten food away and stood to leave.  Having not really been paying attention for the last couple of minutes, he had no way of realizing that Potter and his lackeys were also heading to the doors.  Draco walked with his head down, the way he had been since he got here, fighting every instinct instilled in him. <em> Head up, Draco.  Never let anyone feel as if they are above you. </em> A voice annoyingly like his father’s filled his head.</p><p>He kept his head down and had just made it through the door when he felt his bag rip.  His body jerked with the force of the curse and he was whirled around as if he had been physically shoved.  His hand clamped over his cheek that was now throbbing with the bite of a stinging hex. He could feel his blood rushing through his veins, his head pounded with it. He was hyper aware of every breath entering his lungs then exiting. His hands shook and the tremor of it brushed the welt on his cheek.  Draco carefully brought his hand away, clenching it into a fist, and hissed in a pained breath as he bent to gather his scattered belongings.</p><p>“All right, Malfoy?” Draco looked up into green.  Piercing emerald eyes were watching him curiously.  Potter’s head was tilted, watching Draco’s reaction to the hex, as if waiting for him to throw a fit.  His face was free of the tension he carried for as long as Draco could remember. Potter’s hair was as messy as ever, and, as Draco watched, he brushed a hand through it.  He was always stupidly, annoyingly attractive.</p><p>Granger and Weasley had continued walking and were arguing at the bottom of the first flight of stairs.  They didn’t seem to notice that they had left Potter behind.</p><p>Draco cleared his throat.  “Fine. Just fine, Potter. Thank you,” he ground out.  He had no reason to be embarrassed. It wasn’t as if he had lost a duel.  Someone had cast a spell at his back. Of course he hadn’t--</p><p>“Someone just cursed you from behind.”</p><p>Draco heard Potter state the obvious and continued to gather his things as if he hadn’t spoken.  Potter, Draco was sure, could see the irony in Draco being taken unawares from behind after that incident in fourth year.  Draco stood up with his books and parchment all held haphazardly in his arms. He glanced up and saw Potter holding his Potions textbook.  </p><p>The cover had been torn off and the binding on it was more than a bit worse for wear.  It was better kept than some of the other books in his arms. Potter stared at it with his head cocked and his mouth slightly open as if in surprise.  Potter’s eyes narrowed as he looked at the book, then Draco, then back again.</p><p>“What--” Potter started to ask.  Draco snatched the book from him before he could ask.</p><p>“Don’t worry your pretty, little brain over it, Potter,” Draco said sounding the most like himself he had in two years.  “It’s just a text.” He made to walk towards the dungeons, but Potter grabbed his arm. And unless he wanted to recollect all his belongings, Draco couldn’t pull away.</p><p>Draco heaved a sigh. “What do you want, Potter?”  Even to his own ears, Draco sounded defeated.</p><p>“You should go to the hospital wing.  Your cheek is swollen.”</p><p>“Well it’s not quite so bad as your ego. So I think I’ll survive.”  Draco grimaced. Why could he never keep his mouth shut around Potter.  He felt Potter’s grip on his arm tighten for a second then let go. Draco stumbled a bit not realizing he had leant into the pressure.</p><p>“You’re absolutely right,” Potter bit out irately.  “I don’t know why I was worried. It’s just you.”</p><p>“Yes,” Draco hitched his shoulder and started down the steps. “Just me.”  His mouth curled in disgust. Just Draco the Death Eater. Just Draco the idiot.  Just Draco, who was always on the wrong side of things. Who couldn’t make the right choice if it punched him in the face.  Who could never seem to do anything right. In his parents’ eyes. In Potter’s eyes. In--</p><p>His jaw clenched at these thoughts. He didn’t have time to worry about this.  He had a Transfiguration essay due and reading in his pitiful Potions text. Draco readjusted his hold on his books and carefully continued down the stairs.  He heard footsteps and snippets of conversations as others started leaving the hall from dinner.</p><p>Focusing as he was on maintaining the balance of his load, he didn’t notice the eyes of a group of Hufflepuffs light up when they recognized him.  A hastily whispered tripping jinx tangled his feet, and he toppled down the rest of the flight of stairs. Everything in his hands went flying as Draco went arse over kettle down the stairs.  A gasp wrenched its way out of him as he felt his arm twinge. He landed hard at the bottom of the stairs, head cracking against the flagstones. His breaths came in sharp, shuddery gasps that caused his ribs to flare in shooting pain.  A hysterical giggle flew out of his mouth.</p><p>“You think this is funny, death eater?” One of the Hufflepuffs spat out.</p><p>Draco pressed his uninjured arm to his ribs.  Staring at the ceiling and breathing against the pain, he said nothing.</p><p>“What? Not going to go crying to daddy now? Oh right, because he’s finally where he belongs.  Where you should be, too.”</p><p><em> Where </em> , Draco wanted to ask. <em> Six feet under? </em>Instead, he bit his tongue.</p><p>Did Draco deserve to be dead for what he had done?  People seemed to think Azkaban at the very least. He hadn’t been cleared in the eyes of the people. He had escaped punishment.</p><p>If he didn’t respond the way they wanted him to, they would leave.  They would go to their common room and Draco could go to the hospital wing. He wasn’t sure what was wrong with his arm, and he didn’t know how to handle anything more than bruised bones.</p><p>Draco watched the ceiling swirl and felt like he was going to fall over.  But. But he was already laying down, wasn’t he? Did he have a concussion?</p><p>He didn’t know.  He didn’t know anything, anymore.  Hufflepuffs were supposed to be nice.  Draco wasn’t supposed to be suffering. And purebloods were supposed to be superior.  But Draco was injured. Hufflepuffs had caused it. And blood status meant nothing, now.  Another hysterical laugh was working its way into his throat. He just didn’t know anymore.</p><p>Draco tried sitting up and almost ended up horizontal again with the rush it sent to his head.  He slowly stood up and looked around at his school things. Someone had upended a bottle of ink on his half finished Transfiguration essay and it was soaking into the books beneath the parchment.  Any other assignments he had had been stamped on and torn. The thought of bending over to pick it all up sent a preemptive rush to his head. He sighed and left it all, bag included, on the floor and started his climb back up the stairs.</p><p>The hospital wing wasn’t exactly close to the dungeons, and he didn't want to get caught out by anyone else looking for a go at him.  He moved slowly trying not to agitate his ribs. He heaved a sigh at the thought of his walk and winced at the stretch of his lungs.  His shoes tapped clearly against the flagstones and he walked in silence.</p>
