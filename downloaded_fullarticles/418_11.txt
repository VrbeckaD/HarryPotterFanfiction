  <em>Breathe in, breathe out</em>
</p><p>His breath catches in his throat, he is not supposed to be here. The door was not supposed to be open, it was never open. He is not allowed to open it. Only Him, never him. He should go back and pretend he didn't leave, pray that He doesn't find out.</p><p>Instead he steps forward. His legs feel weak, as if they're about to crumble beneath him. He squints at the light. <em>There is light. </em>There is never light without Him, He allows the light.　</p><p>The light is coming from the front door. It's directly in his path, a few steps and he can touch it. He stills, listening, but the only sound is his ragged breath. He is alone.　</p><p>He takes another step forward, then another and another. He reaches out a hand and brushes his fingertips against the wood. His other hand hovers over the door knob.　</p><p>It will be locked, it is always locked, never unlocked, always trapped -</p><p>The door clicks. It opens. Another slither of light. It's day.</p><p>Draco slowly pulls the door completely open. He cringes and takes a step back as his sensitive eyes burn and the cold hits him. He keeps his eyes half shut. He steps forward again.</p><p>One foot in front of the other. The ground is cold and wet under his bare feet. The wind feels powerful enough to knock him over. He stands rooted on the spot. He doesn't know the last time he was allowed outside. Not for a long time. He waits for the crashing footsteps, the shouting and the pain. Nothing happens.</p><p>There is a red gate at the bottom of the small garden. He steps towards it. Again. Again. He pushes the latch up and it opens.</p><p>For another second he turns back to the house. Rodolphus is going to kill him. He's going to find out that he went outside, and he's going to beat him and strangle him and hold him under in the bath-</p><p>Draco runs. He runs faster than he ever has before. He doesn't know where he's running and his legs are aching. He can't breathe properly, can barely gulp down air. He runs and runs and runs.</p><p>There is another person. A group of people. He doesn't remember the last time he saw someone else, not really. He doesn't notice until he runs into them.</p><p>He falls to the floor, gasping for breath, tears streaming down his cheeks. He can't look at them.</p><p>"Woah, you alright, mate?" One of them asks. He's young. Almost as young as -</p><p>He glances up. Yellow robes. Wand. Honeydukes sweets.</p><p>"Please," He forces the word past his lips <em>(do not speak unless I fucking tell you to)</em>."M-My name is Draco Malfoy. I've been, I've been. . ." He can't say it, can't get the words out. He doesn't know what he's been. Where he's been.</p><p>He glances up. A short glance at the stranger's look of horror is enough.</p>
