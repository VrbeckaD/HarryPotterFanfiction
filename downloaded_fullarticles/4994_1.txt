          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Stay.”</p>
<p>Pansy pauses mid-movement, her leg hovering in the air. She turns, her eyes wide in disbelief, to stare at the woman beside her. Bellatrix never wants her to stay; she always kicks Pansy out after she’s satisfied. She certainly never comforts Pansy after she uses her. </p>
<p>“Stay,” Bellatrix rasps again, her voice hoarse from punishment at the Dark Lord’s wand. Her talon-like hand wraps around Pansy’s bruised wrist and yanks her back into the bed. </p>
<p>The older witch has taught her passivity and obedience, so Pansy lets Bellatrix pull her into an embrace, one leather-clad arm at her throat and the other snaking over her hips. Knowing better than to question this unexpected tenderness — and this <i>is</i> tenderness, coming from Bellatrix — Pansy simply closes her eyes and tries to sleep. </p>
<p>Moments like this are rare — nonexistent, really — so Pansy doesn’t mind when she feels Bellatrix’s nails dig into her skin, or when Bellatrix’s other hand squeezes her throat. </p>
<p>Bellatrix eventually falls asleep, but her hands continue to grip Pansy possessively even in slumber, and this more than anything soothes her. </p>
<p>Pansy is sure that tomorrow she will be unwelcome again after pleasing Bellatrix. </p>
<p>That knowledge is also soothing.</p></div>
