</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The war was finally over. The threat of Voldemort no longer a worry in the Wizarding World, but there was something different in the air of victory. Harry Potter stood tall with his friends and the family he made while one who has been with him since the beginning stood at the side away from the many who were cheering. Hermione Granger stood with a small smile at everyone she cared about. Although there were a few that lost their lives, the few that still remained were not as relieved as everyone else that it was done.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There were still Death Eaters who disappeared during the heat of battle and she knew already that her best friend wasn’t going to go back to Hogwarts. Chasing dark wizards is something that Harry Potter was very talented at and Hermione already knew that’s where he was going to go after all this was over.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She sighed before frowning. At this moment, she didn’t feel like she belonged with them. Many times during the years they had been friends, Hermione always felt like the outcast. She knew that the boys used her for her knowledge, but she knew they cared. However, she just felt empty inside, like nothing made sense anymore.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Have you made your decision?” a soft spoken voice said behind her. Hermione didn’t need to look to know who it was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t belong in the spotlight, Luna,” Hermione turned to her friend who had a small smile on her face. “I belong in the shadows where I can make a difference with my mind.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luna nodded, “I know the feeling, but I will be here when you get back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione nodded before a quiet pop sounded to the left of them. She looked to see Luna’s father with a half masked man. No one around them noticed the man it seemed so Hermione thought that he had a certain disillusionment charm on him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Have you decided to join us then, Ms. Granger?” Xenophilius Lovegood asked in a more sane voice than what she was familiar with.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Hermione looked back at her friends one last time before she turned back to the three next to her. “What do I need to do?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Xenophilius smiled before the man beside him spoke. “Hermione Granger, you are standing here making the promise of the Assassini Dell’ombra and are willing to take the mark of the brotherhood. How say you?” he took her arm and held it like how one would take an Unbreakable Vow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am,” Hermione answered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you swear that you will serve the brotherhood until death?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I will.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you swear that if you are in a dire situation and cannot call onto those that you will call brother and sister that you will sacrifice your life to keep the secret of our creed safe?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I will.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you swear that you will protect the Wizarding World from any threat whether domestically or internationally?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I will.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lastly,” Xenophilius Lovegood made a wand movement around Hermione and the man’s arms that weaved a red line tight around their vow. “Do you swear that you will be a shadow. Unknown to your loved ones. Unknown to the world? To protect the world from the darkness that will come? And to protect yourself from harm?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione looked the man in the eyes and nodded. “I will.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just as Hermione spoke those last words, the red line tightened more around their arms until it disappeared in their skin. Hermione noticed that the man who made the vow with her had the line etched into his skin like a scar. She looked at her skin and compared to his, hers was a soft white line.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man unmasked himself and standing before her was Blaise Zabini. He had disappeared from the war before Voldemort attacked Hogwarts and was nowhere to be seen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Welcome sister,” Blaise smiled at her, “We must make haste.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione nodded before looking over at her friends once more. They didn’t seem to notice she wasn’t with them, but that only made it safer for them. She felt a hand on her shoulder and looked at Luna. Like Hermione’s, Luna had a scar on her arm. “One day you’ll come back into their lives, but for now, we have a mission. We must go.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione sighed and nodded. Xenophilius flicked his wand and Hermione felt a warm sensation around her and knew that the world around them won’t see them as they leave. She took one last glance at the Weasleys and Harry before she felt herself pulled into apparating.</span>
