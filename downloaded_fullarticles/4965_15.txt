    <p>       Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.</p><p>   "Sir?" Said Harry "I've been thinking...Sir even if the stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who-"</p><p>   "Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of the name increases fear of the thing itself."</p><p>   "Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?"</p><p>   "No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share...not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time - and if he is delayed again, and again, why he ma never return to power."</p><p>Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Just as he was about to speak again; Dumbledore interrupted him.</p><p>   "Which, my boy, is the reason I will be moving you away from the Dursleys and into another home," Harry's face become a pale white as all the blood seemed to be drained. They were moving him from the Dursleys? Perhaps he would go to the Weasleys, a comforting thought, or he would be shipped off to an oprhang. Maybe a nastier family with the luck Harry had, "I have already informed them about your situation, they have agreed to take you on for the rest of your educational schooling years and will meet you upon your departure of the Hogwarts express, this welcoming family are called the Golds." Dumbledore's bright blue eyes twinkled in delight.</p><p>Harry hadn't been able to see his friends until the end-of-year feast as he had been much to busy worrying about the news given to him by Dumbledore. At the feast he was finally able to catch up, every Gryffindor congratulating his bravery. His mind was much to focused on his friends and the delicious meal to tell them about his new discovery.</p><p>At the end of the feast, after receiving their exam results. Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boosts that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts express; talking and laughing as the country side became greener and tidier. Harry practically dropped his Bertie bott's every flavor beans on the compartment floor as the memory of Dumbledore's words came flooding back to him. Ron stopped eating his sweets to look up at Harry confused.<br/> <br/>    "What's the matter Harry? Did you get a nasty one, don't worry I ate a rotten egg flavored one earlier." Hermione placed her book down onto her lap wondering what was going in.</p><p>   "Ron...Hermione-I, I need to tell you something important, it completely slipped my mind somehow," Harry seemed apprehensive at first. Placing his sweets next to him and fiddling with his fingers. Hermione and Ron were confused and nervous as well, it could be any sorts of news, both good and bad, "I won't be staying with the Dursleys anymore" Ron's eyes lit up.</p><p>   "Congratulations mate!" he threw his fist up in the air in excitement for his best friend, a wide smile on his face.</p><p>   "Wait Harry, than who will you be staying with ?" Hermione spoke this time. Harry looked his two best friends nervously before speaking.</p><p>   "They're called the Golds but, Dumbledore didn't say much else, Hermione you wouldn't know anything about them would you" He tilted his head to look at Hermione, his glasses slipping down his nose.</p><p>   "No I don't think i've ever heard that name in fact, perhaps their just a ordinary family"</p><p>   "Hopefully their a wizarding family, trust me Harry you'll love it! Just hope they don't have their own versions of Fred and George!"<br/> <br/> Pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross station. It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract any attention by all bursting out of a solid what once and alarming the muggles.</p><p>   "You must come and hang out this summer," said Ron, "both of you- I'll send an owl."</p><p>   "Thanks," said Harry, "I'll need something to look forward to."<br/> People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world. Some of them called:</p><p>"Bye, Harry!"</p><p>"See you, Potter!"</p><p>"Still famous," said Ron, grinning at him.</p><p>"Not where I'm going, I promise you," said Harry.</p><p>He, Ron and Hermione passed through the gateway together.<br/> <br/>    "There he is mom, mum, there he is, look!" It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.</p><p>"Harry Potter!" she squealed.</p><p>"Look, mum! I can see-"</p><p>   "Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point." Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.</p><p>   "Busy year?" she said.</p><p>"Very," said Harry. "Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley. "</p><p>   "Oh, it was nothing, dear." Mrs. Weasley was about to pat his messy flop of black hair when a voice behind them spoke.</p><p>   "You must be Harry Potter." They all turned to spot a short man with a black and gold cane. He had a Scottish accent, graying hair and wore a suit and hankerchief looking like the Devils very advocate.</p><p>   "May I ask who you are?" Mrs. Weasley said placing one hand on her hip, the other holding her daughters hand in a protective grip.</p><p>   "Mr. Gold at your service," He gave a little bow to herald the children, always keeping a sneaky grin with his shiny gold tooth. "I am actually here to pick him up" Mr. Gold said pulling out a letter from the inside of his suit jacket and handing it to Molly. She grabbed it delicately and let go of Ginny's hand to open it. Ron and Hermione looked at Harry with skepticism.</p><p>   "Well...I wouldn't want to hold you any longer Mr. Gold," she turned to Harry patting his floofy hair. "Everything seems to be in order my dear."</p><p>  "Yes I would hope so, my wife is waiting on me, as we are quite in a hurry" he simply touched Harry's luggage as well as Hedwig's cage with one of his spidery hands, making it disappear into thin air with a blink of an eye; leaving the Weasley's, Hermione and Harry all flabbergasted.</p><p>  "How...how did yo-" Hermione didn't get to finish as Mr. Gold hurried up Harry.</p><p>   "Come now Harry we must leave at once, say your goodbyes now" Mr. Gold spoke as he turned, visibly limping as he walked away. Harry turned to his friends with a frown on his face.</p><p>   "I'll send you an owl guys, goodbye" Harry waved and turned to catch up with the strange man.</p><p><br/>  </p><p> </p>
