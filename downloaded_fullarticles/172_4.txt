          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione quickly made her way back to Malfoy Manor.  She had in her bundles some different potions to try out from George.</p><p>Lucius and Severus were pacing back and forth, waiting for their wife to come home. "She should be here by now."</p><p>"I know!" Severus snapped out at him.  They've been quarantined in the Manor ever since the snowstorm.</p><p>Hermione quickly rushed inside out of breath. She laid all her packages on the dining room table. "Did you get it?" they rushed in, asking her enthusiastically.</p><p>Hermione arched an eyebrow curiously, noting that both husbands were feeling particularly well.  She took a deep breath, reached in a bag, and pulled out George's potion, which was a mixture of rum, firewhsky, ginger ale.</p><p>"Yes! And you've got the popcorn?" Severus questioned her as she pulled out a Cheeto's bag of popcorn.</p><p>"Something new we can try out!"</p></div>
