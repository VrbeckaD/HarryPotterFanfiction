    <p><strong>Part 1: On stranger tides</strong><br/>
<br/>
Gwythyr was panting in pain by the time they reached the port city Gibraltar. It wasn’t quite the outermost tip of Portugal, but a bay at the very south of Spain, occupied by Britain for the time being. The bay of Gibraltar appeared less like a part of the Atlantic and more like the English Channel, just as blue, just as cold, lacking the characteristic smell of the sea. Every downstroke of Gwythyr’s wings splashed water on to Albus’ face. Protective shields be damned, he was occupied enough holding her upright. His spells did nothing to relieve her pain anymore. The veterinarians had been right; she was nowhere near fit enough for a journey to the north of Europe. Hot, dry rainless weather during the two weeks they were forced to stay in Venice was wearing down on the food supplies. Italy could only provide so many herds of sheep, cows and pigs for food. Strong marching them all from Rome was out of the question. There simply wasn’t enough time and they were surrounded by enemies. It drove Albus up the walls to the point that taking flight had been nothing short of sheer relief. Gwythyr had fought for her life, bravely so, along with all the other injured dragons.  Their Riders recovered a day at a time and it had all been going so well, or at least from the outside. Lying down she had not lifted a single claw from the ground for two whole weeks.<br/>
Albus saw the mistake in his impatience now.<br/>
<br/>
The horizon was a shimmering line of brilliant blue where the incoming ocean reflected the sky, not a single cloud in sight. The northern coast of Africa was still too far away to be spotted today. With the sun burning mercilessly down on them it was hard to concentrate and watch for sails. The <em>HMS Achilles</em> should have anchored in Port Gibraltar by now. It was pulled from Le Havre as soon as word of the battle of Venice had reached King George. Worrying, not to see it waiting in the harbour by now, indeed. But still, Albus held his tongue since they weren’t alone. They hadn’t been since Gellert left for Prussia to join the marching army against the impressively numbered Russian and Austrian forces. At each side of Gwythyr flew a young Venetian Green dragon respectively, named Argiro and Aurora with the colours to match their names. They were usually noisy and as impatient as Albus felt, and unable to hover in place for more than ten minutes at a time. In front of them Gibraltar rose like a needle out of the Mediterranean Sea. Only the English flags tied to the tail ends of the three dragons prevented them from being shot on sight. They had to avoid the Spanish city of Algeciras across the bay at all costs. Gibraltar was a British safe haven on a small half-island for them to land on and get away immediately. It was enough of a risk already, besides, no way in hell was Gwythyr going to hold the position for any prolonged time.<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Tired’</em>, she sighed in his mind for the fourth time today, and her head sunk deeper. Albus scratched her neck scales absently, still watching the horizon, sweating, breathing in time with the slow up and down of her enormous wings. Every movement jostled her injured neck. The bones were still healing. Though the torn tissue sewed itself back together already it would take time. So much more time than they had.<br/>
“I know. We need to land immediately, we’re not going any further than this!”<br/>
<br/>
The Roman Rider Baldassare Colleone caught Albus’ warning first. The British boy on Gwythyr’s right hand side only nodded so his mop of sun-bleached hair bounced on his head.<br/>
“Go down slowly, gently, Gwythyr,” Albus murmured almost fully dipped forth onto his chest, affection laced his subdued voice. It hurt more than words could express so see her like this. He watched her struggle and howl in pain when the changed angle made the wind rush into her wings too harshly. She toppled to the cliff just above the town of Gibraltar without grace, maybe a mile or two away from the harbour. No need to scare harmless soldiers by a fully grown Heavy Weight and two Medium Weights. All three of them were capable of unleashing hell through a snort alone.<br/>
<br/>
Albus slid from her back with ease, long since healed himself, and promptly rushed off to Aurora’s landing point. The boy was struggling with the belts. He clearly was not trained and scarcely equipped.<br/>
“Scamander!”<br/>
“Yes, Sir?” Goddamn, the boy was too young for this.<br/>
“I know that you most likely weren’t told these things, but that landing was sloppy. Too loud, too much flailing about. We are supposed to keep this whole sorry ordeal under wraps. I do understand the joy that comes with flying, trust me, but if the Spaniards get <em>any wind whatsoever</em> of us, we are as good as captured or worse! Do you understand?” Newton Scamander looked about ready to argue, his eyes too bright and the leather straps tightly clasped in his speckled hands. He would be sunburned all over by the end of the day, no doubt.<br/>
“Yes, Sir. I’m sorry, Sir.”<br/>
Albus sighed.<br/>
“Don’t Sir me that much, would you? I’m a scant twelve years older than you, not twenty.” A small smile lit up his whole face accompanied by a short nod that showed his willingness to comply.<br/>
“As you wish. It is nice, I admit, to have somebody who speaks English around here. I wasn’t exactly given much time to prepare for this transfer.”<br/>
<br/>
The sound of stomping feet behind Albus interrupted them. Aurora lifted her head curiously to the noise of dry brown grass breaking like straw.<br/>
“Well, that’s a shame, Scamander! Italian is a wonderful language, you think not?”<br/>
Rider Colleone, grinning like the midday sun and his arms spread wide, was an annoying prick more often than not and never knew when to shut up. Broad shoulders, full in size, double Albus’ age but appearing younger. Being a Rider did wonders to the aging body if you weren’t scratched and torn in some battle or another. He was the seventh son of a working class couple, the others at the healer’s bay had said, which showed in his good nature and strength. He was the Venetian’s security measure and technically in charge, but only until Aurora and Gwythyr were safely atop the ships. At the moment Albus only wished their heavily accented chaperone to listen in a bit less on other person’s conversations.<br/>
 <br/>
“I hardly think that any skills in Italian that we achieved at the Academy are of much use in your beautiful city. It’s your dialect, I’m afraid.”<br/>
“Nah, horse dung,” Colleone replied and clapped a hefty hand to Aurora’s soft rosé scales. He was mindful enough not to cut himself, but apparently not of other creature’s personal space. “Translation spells ‘n all. You guys do that, don’t you?”<br/>
“Sometimes,” Albus replied curtly, faked a smile and went to work conjuring a bathtub filled with water. Out here there wasn’t any drinking water within miles, unless they marched straight into town.<br/>
He held the Italian’s gaze for a moment longer than necessary, not quite a warning yet acknowledgement of the tension between them. They were clashing personalities, and had different ideas on how to treat a dragon. He dearly wished for Gellert’s company to keep him from lashing out at anyone who got within a five feet radius of Gwythyr. She had been so terribly close to losing her life, and hovered on the brink without falling to either side for days. The thought of being trapped on a ship for over two weeks didn’t exactly calm Albus’ nerves. At all.<br/>
<br/>
“I say we make camp, wait for your comrades to show up,” Colleone ordered with a sneer. He stomped away to his silver dragon Argiro, who had long since settled into the dry grass, tail tucked next to his body like a great cat. Next to Gwythyr both dragons looked three sizes too small. They were just as muscled as she was, though faster and not very talkative. Aurora was meant for the Ministry’s new training program. The Ministry had, against their own will, been told by the parliament that too many Heavy Weights were unsuited for formations going up against the French strategy. It was a damn façade, a dragon as a gift like a sword specifically forged for this war. Albus squared his jaw and stood his ground, waiting for Colleone to be out of earshot.<br/>
<br/>
Gwythyr nudged his legs from behind with her snout, obviously expecting him to hold on and lean back. It really was a marvellous view from up here. The cliffs fell so steeply into the Strait of Gibraltar that looking down made him dizzy. And he was a Rider! Somehow, standing at the edge of Europe had a different feel to it entirely than sitting strapped onto a strong back made of muscles and scales twice the size of his combined hands each.<br/>
<em>‘Albus.’</em><br/>
“Not long now, my dear. They can’t be far or else word would have reached us.” Whom he was reassuring, him or her, he wasn’t sure.<br/>
<br/>
The sun took a long while to dip down into the arms of Spain, setting the sky on fire. The far heights were covered in gold in the west and azure over the sea they were leaving behind. Soon the fortress of Gibraltar turned into a silhouette of pitch black boulders scattered over flat plains. It was one of the most heavily armed and guarded forts in the entirety of Europe. One could easily be tricked, by the peaceful slumber of the evening, into tranquillity. When the terrible heat finally gave way to a slight breeze coming in from the ocean Albus fooled himself into imagining small triangles floating over the south-western horizon. This was the edge of the world, of his world, at least; there was a whole continent behind that horizon. Africa was full of people with skin as black as the night sky and palms as pink as Aurora’s scales. It was a well for the slave trade that Albus loathed with a passion. Though he was acutely aware of the anew riches it had brought, and continued to bring his home country every day.<br/>
<br/>
As night settled over Gibraltar, neither of them dared to start a camp fire. The bay wasn’t large enough for it not to be seen from the other side.<br/>
“Sir?” Albus turned around. Newton Scamander approached him carefully from the left where he wasn’t nestled against Gwythyr’s warm flank.<br/>
“Yes, Mister Scamander?”<br/>
Damn shame to call that boy Mister instead of Rider, really. The sound of a breath puffed out into the dark.<br/>
“It is not my speciality, these sorts of things, but I thought to see ships approaching from the west just before sundown. Too dark now to spot anything, obviously. Maybe it would be wise to sweep down into the harbour and settle there instead. No ship will ever see us here.”<br/>
“And you would prefer not to camp out in enemy territory, is that what you’re truly saying?”<br/>
<br/>
The boy’s blush would have been very obvious, indeed, if there had been more daylight than the little glow left to see just past his own hands. Somewhere, Colleone was trying not to argue too loudly with his dragon and failing spectacularly.<br/>
“Yes, S- Yes, I suppose so.” Albus picked himself off the hard grass, weary of Gwythyr’s deep breaths. She was asleep and had been the second they touched ground.<br/>
“Fine, then. I thought it wiser not to scare the townspeople, although we can’t have our transport home wonder where we are, now, can we?” There was a hint of a smile, an outline of relieved gratefulness in the dark of the night, and the young Scamander retreated respectfully. Albus couldn’t fault him for leaving the part where he broke the news to Colleone to himself. The farewell was brief and friendly enough with both parties glad to part ways.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>HMS Achilles</em>, as they soon found out, was a majestic ship of the line rowed with cannons on two decks and four masts. The rear was large enough for Gwythyr to curl up, but not wide enough to stretch out on from starboard to portside. It would be damn difficult not to get in the sailor’s way constantly. Accompanying them were two frigates, the <em>Brilliant</em> and the <em>Juno</em> with their respective captains. The captain of the flagship, the <em>HMS Achilles</em>, was a man about Albus’ age called Admiral Samuel Barrington. Albus settled in for a long journey surrounded by heaps of rough men bursting to tell the tale to the unknowing Riders about their successful raid on Le Havre to prevent a French invasion on Great Britain over the channel, with each tale being a bit more colourful and exaggerated each time. And if he basked in said rough men walking around shirtless shamelessly, packed in muscles like mules, well, nobody knew him well enough to call him out on it, except Gwythyr. He worried more about the Scamander boy. He was just young and pretty enough to be of interest to some of the sailors, but too shy to say no to anybody and too oblivious to notice that he was being hit on <em>constantly</em>. It was maddening.<br/>
“Gellert is going to kill me for this,” he groaned under his breath on the very first day afloat and made it his task to protect the young magizoologist nonetheless. He also spent a lot of time tending to Gwythyr’s healing wounds, finding it hard to let her alone for long.<br/>
<br/>
Restocked with goods, food and fresh water, the three ships set out into the open sea two days after landing in Gibraltar. For a ship this big, apparently two days was a quick jump in and out. There was no time off for the crew, only enough time to purchase new clothes, more thread and some needles to fix their scarce belongings as well as the sails. Aurora tried to fit in somewhere in between, changing between the <em>HMS Achilles</em> to curl up next to Gwythyr. Sometimes she rumbled deep, soothing sounds like the purr of a cat when pressed into her sides. When she became just too much hassle for the sailors to deal with, she simply hopped over to the <em>Brilliant </em>again. It unsettled the sailors, of course, to work around the dragons, which were living, breathing mountains of fire, teeth, spikes and claws. When exactly Albus had started to think lovingly about them like a loyal partner in crime and more relaxing to be around than humans, he had no idea.<br/>
<br/>
Sailing onto the open waters with the sun barely hovering above the horizon behind them felt like a breath of fresh air. Albus was standing at the nose of the ship with his arms crossed, and he hadn’t eaten yet. Never in his entire lifetime had he experienced a journey by ship, not to mention several weeks out on the ocean, because frankly, he was a wizard, thank you very much. Besides, Gwythyr was more comfortable, not to mention faster than a ship. The sailors currently on deck had started singing once out of earshot of Algeciras. It was a longing, hopeful song that neither cared much for melody nor for proper wording; the lyrics were crude at best. A strong breeze blew all sails so taught that every change of direction resulted in a sound like gunfire, even tying Albus’ long hair into an orderly ponytail didn’t keep it out of his face. In front of their little fleet, the Atlantic stretched so far into every direction that one could almost sense the Americas waiting on the other side. The ocean was a deep dark blue where the continent of Europe gave way to nothing but water, crowned by small patches of white foam. Last night sent clouds on their way, wherever they were travelling, torn apart and hurtling across the sky at a speed that made Albus worry. He was intimately familiar with the changing moods of the weather, though it mostly wasn’t a concern as Gwythyr always had the option to land and seek shelter. On a ship there was no escaping a storm.<br/>
<br/>
He tried his best not to stumble, to go with the rhythmical rise and fall of the ship and get used to the different movements. It felt nothing like flying, though just as freeing and the slightest tad dangerous. The air smelled of salt and the rushing sound of the rumbling, constantly moving ocean would put him to sleep in no time that night. They would have made the turn to the north by then.<br/>
“Impressive, inn’it?” He almost jumped out of his skin, cursing under his breath. How was the sailor so quiet in approaching? A bald man with several tattoos on his upper arms and less teeth than holes in his mouth stared at him. He stood slightly behind Albus, as an indication that he didn’t plan for a long chat. Albus nodded curtly, his gaze flickered to Gwythyr. Still sleeping, but not for long.<br/>
“One of the most beautiful things on earth I have seen so far. The sunrises and sunsets here are stunning. It sets everything into perspective, somehow.”<br/>
“Yeah, that’s what yeh posh people always say. Sky was on fire for several mornings now. Means nothing good. Never does.” Albus refrained from pointing out that superstition was nonsense. Sailors didn’t receive the same education that Riders did, not to speak of his expertise of Transfiguration achieved in Hogwarts. The man most likely didn’t have a single spark of magic in his blood with his small eyes, wide forehead, wrinkled skin, scarred from decades of healed sunburn.<br/>
“Forgive me, I do not believe in the sky reflecting events which took place somewhere in the world. For there to be a red sunrise every time blood has been shed in the night, we never would have the pleasure to witness a yellow hue to announce the day.”<br/>
<br/>
“Poets,” the sailor spat and grimaced, baring ugly stumps as teeth. “Don’t think this’ll be a pleasant ride on horseback, landlubber! Tore the French a new one, we did, aye. Weren’t amused, ‘f course.” Albus gave another incline of his head, a nod too slow to be recognized as such.<br/>
“I heard.” Albus would have liked to add that Gwythyr had taken out twice as many French soldiers with one blow than their cannons presumably had in the two days of the raid on Le Havre. Staying silent, however, paid off when a shrill whistling sound ripped through the hustling and bustling of the morning on deck. Turning around, he recognized the captain on the wheel with a sour expression. Admiral Barrington wasn’t a man to be toyed with. The sailor left Albus’ side, muttering filthy things in a language that didn’t quite sound like English anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Gwythyr slightly lifted her head in confusion, apparently decided it was way too early to be bothered by human noises and went right back to sleep. It would have been adorable, and Albus truly couldn’t help but smile, if the better part of her long neck hadn’t still been wrapped in caskets and bandages. Newt Scamander was already up and about, dragging two goats that moaned pitifully out of the belly of the ship.<br/>
<br/>
He felt the captain’s eyes on him while he made his way over the deck and most likely a complete fool of himself in the process. Admiral Barrington never truly smiled, though he appeared amused seeing a dragon rider stumble across his ship. Albus took it in stride. He was well aware of how he must have looked the first time he climbed onto Gwythyr’s back all those years ago. Which was over a decade now.<br/>
“May I take those from you?” he asked the young Scamander boy politely just before he reached the stairs to the stern. Albus took pity on his struggle against two very strong-headed goats, who weren’t willing to end up as breakfast for a dragon. The boy blinked up to him, almost confused, before he handed over the ropes with a quiet bow.<br/>
“Yes, please, thank you, Sir. Did you rest well last night?”<br/>
“Indeed I did. I am ever so glad to return home, aren’t you too?”<br/>
<br/>
Scamander lowered his gaze and smiled carefully. His face was an open book, and his youth painfully obvious. Aurora was nowhere to be seen.<br/>
“My brother certainly will be glad to have me back where he can watch over me. He warned me not to do anything stupid on the continent.”<br/>
“Well,” Albus replied and lowered his voice. “I agree, of course, but we aren’t on the continent anymore, Mister Scamander. Still, I would advise you not to converse too much with the sailors. They can put funny things into your head. Superstition, that kind of thing. It can make you quite nervous, until the dragons catch up on those nerves and that’s the point where we have a real problem on our hands.” Scamander lifted his eyes for a second longer than he normally did, longer than strictly necessary for a polite reply at least, and straightened his shoulders. It gave him a whole inch of added height.<br/>
“Of course, Sir. I’ll be careful.”<br/>
Albus let out a sigh he didn’t know he was holding. The goats bleated again in their attempt to break free of his iron grip.<br/>
“Thank you. Now go on, have breakfast as long as we still have something halfway decent stored under deck.”<br/>
<br/>
He watched the boy disappear under deck again before he stunned the two goats with a muttered curse. Gwythyr wasn’t even awake properly and wouldn’t eat for another half hour, at least. To magically glue them to the deck in front of her would be the easiest thing. Albus straightened his posture though he had some difficulty to focus on the Captain when Gwythyr was right there, alive and breathing evenly, clearly still asleep. Even her mind felt calm, which was a rare thing these days.<br/>
He didn’t think anyone, least of all the captain, to raise an eyebrow at his discretely drawn wand; magic wasn’t so odd a thing in the Rider Korps when you dealt with dragons on a daily basis. So he did the only wise thing: come over as non-threatening as possible. <br/>
“Admiral Barrington.”<br/>
Wasn’t working so well with two goats under his extended hands, barely a foot away from Gwythyr’s snout, apparently.<br/>
“Rider Dumbledore. You sent your stable boy away for the morning?” Brilliant, they would stick to the planks come hell or high water.<br/>
<br/>
Carefully he touched the small scales over Gwythyr’s nostrils, felt the heat underneath, smiled at the vibration of fire and smoke. Albus shook his head no.<br/>
“Mister Scamander is more of an apprentice under my protection than a stable boy,” he corrected the Captain and forced himself to make eye contact. The Admiral had dark brown eyes and hid a tamed haircut, of the same colour, under his hat. His deep blue uniform was spotless if repaired in several places. And eyebrows. His eyebrows spoke more than words.<br/>
“Is that so? Well, I advise you to look out for him, Sir. Boys like him are always so very welcome in the navy, you see.” Albus scoffed in amusement.<br/>
“Not a chance in the world. What use would you have for a veterinarian?” Magizoologist, he thought and sighed internally. Still, the term was broader and easier to understand for a Muggle.<br/>
<br/>
Admiral Barrington gave him a look that didn’t need any explanation - the tired, long-suffering expression of a leader who had lost too many good men in the recent years. Albus heard rumours about this Admiral since landing in Gibraltar, such as he has been afloat for fifteen continuous years now. He was a treasure for the Crown, a strong rock in dangerous waters for his sailors. Heavens, but they were all tired of fighting.<br/>
“You would be surprised. Your <em>apprentice</em> takes care of your beast, then?”<br/>
“Dragon,” he bit before he could stop himself, “Her name is Gwythyr and she almost gave her life saving Venice, we both did. Mister Scamander is helping to take care of her wounds. Trust me, had I not the need for him we wouldn’t be in your hair right now.”<br/>
<br/>
The Admiral returned his gaze to the ocean again, which was calm and steady. They wouldn’t need to turn north for another two hours, at least. The sky hadn’t even bled all that red yet with the sun rising in their backs.<br/>
“It is my honour to transport the hero of the hour back home. The Venetians must have been quite reluctant to let you go.” Albus hid the urge to snort by lowering his head and regretted it instantly, not seeing the horizon made him dizzy. It would take a while to get used to. At least the feeling of confusion upon the first step on dry ground that would overtake him in Britain he was very much familiar with.<br/>
“Not really, no. My understanding of Italian isn’t what it used to be and the summer was kind on nobody in all of Europe, least of all an island almost cut off from the main land completely.” He crossed his arms, reluctant to speak his mind. “You heard of the battle, then, and of what we did, though no word from anybody has reached us in return. Lord Abraxas payed me a visit three days after, but we received no messengers.”<br/>
<br/>
Admiral Barrington clicked his tongue, turned around to watch something only he knew of and focussed on Albus again briefly. His gaze was piercing.<br/>
“Ah, I see. Something particular Old John said to you over there?” So that was the name of the bald soldier, then. Albus shook his head.<br/>
“No, just superstition, nothing more. Something about red mornings and blood having been spilled in the night, the usual.”<br/>
“I hate to break it to you, good Sir, but in this case, John was right. He’s a muttering fish head is what he is and you shouldn’t listen too closely to him, although he is a decent fighter in a tight situation. I doubt that he got wind of the Prussian struggles.”<br/>
He almost swallowed his own tongue in surprise.<br/>
“Pardon?”<br/>
There was a careful blankness on the Admiral’s face. It made Albus worry even more than he usually did.<br/>
<br/>
“The Prussian King was shot in the battle of Kunersdorf, some three days back as a little bird told me. Do you speak German?”<br/>
“A little,” he admitted before slapping himself mentally for it. It never did one any good to give away language skills to superiors. It only made listening in on conversations infinitely harder.<br/>
“You may forgive me for butchering the pronunciation then. I find it hard and quite odd; it hurts the throat, don’t you think? The king lives, and rumour has it a snuffbox stopped the bullet from piercing his heart. His guard urged him away from the battlefield immediately. I bet the Russians and the thrice damned Austrians had a jolly time watching him flee. Six Thousand Prussians dead, thirteen thousand more heavily injured. Fifteen Heavy Weights fell, and one really doesn’t have to elaborate on their Riders.”<br/>
“Merlin and Morgana… The war is as good as lost then.”<br/>
To call the open pit in his chest terror didn’t cut it in the slightest. Albus felt his hands shake and hid them behind his back to appear calm when he absolutely was not. All he could think about was Gellert and his old, weary companion Anarawd fighting a battle lost to all hope. The two of them holding a position as long as possible or even escorting King Frederick back to Sanssouci through the air. With an injury like that, the damage done by a stopped bullet to the ribs and the tissue, getting to a healer as fast as possible must have been the priority, thus transporting Gellert away from the battlefield speedily as well. Albus refused to grieve until someone told him without a shred of a doubt they were both dead.<br/>
<br/>
Admiral Barrington glanced at him from the side, checked the compass embedded in a small table next to the wheel and squared his shoulders.<br/>
“Not all is lost just because the Prussians have been handed their arses back to themselves. King Frederick lives, no doubt raging in his castle, as we speak, where no worries ever had a place at his table. Lighten up, good Sir, we will cross that bridge when we come to it. And for us, the Prussians don’t make a difference, now, do they? Do they have colonies, do they have ships?”<br/>
“No,” he murmured and straightened his back to not come off as quite so gloomy. It was bad enough that Gwythyr was waking up from his mental state of turmoil. “No, of course not. I thank you sincerely for telling me the news so rationally. The attack on Venice makes sense now, gives it meaning. An ambush, meant to cut off any supply of help for the Prussians marching on Kunersdorf.”<br/>
“It appears so, yes. That no-one has heard of the tragedy south of the Alps is a misfortune. Though I wonder if the Venetians would have been of any help at all.”<br/>
To that, Albus stayed firmly silent, because no, they would have not. Not at all.</p>
