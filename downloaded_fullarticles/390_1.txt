    <p>Of course she remembered the first time she saw her, at least the first time she noticed her bushy brown hair. It has been about two years and today she was standing by the door of a small kitchen crowded with redheads and there she was, standing on the opposite corner of the room, talking to her famous friend, Harry Potter.</p>
<p>“Fleur! It’s so nice to finally meet you!” The oldest redhead woman greeted her as she came inside moments before. “Bill has been talking about you nonstop since he got here!”</p>
<p>“Mom!” Her redhead boyfriend groaned, she only smiled lightly.</p>
<p>His little sister was wearing a frown leaving quite obvious that she didn’t like the blonde. Fleur knew the younger girls didn’t like her. What she didn’t know was why. It was imaginable why Ginevra didn’t like her, she was dating her older brother. But it fled from her the motive of the brunette dislike. Oh, right, there was the fact that her trail didn’t affect them. Still her intense dislike…</p>
<p>“Hallo, Fleur!” The twins spoke to her in unison smiling widely.</p>
<p>“‘ello everyone!” She smiled.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you again, Fleur!” Harry was now next to her, having left Hermione to whisper almost angrily at Ginevra. He smiled at her motioning to hug her, which she reciprocated.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you too, ‘arry!”</p>
<p>She arrived at the Burrow a few days after Bill, around the middle of Hogwarts summer vacations. Fleur was highly distraught with Bill’s plan of her getting to know his family. They were dating for a year now and neither had met each other’s parents. She wanted to let Bill get some family time before she arrived so she made sure to get there at least a week after him.</p>
<p>Fleur knew that her Veela heritage wouldn’t allow her to actually fall in love with him as she knew he wasn’t her mate. It might have escaped her mind that she should tell him that. And she was well aware that she was being a bitch doing it, but she was beginning to feel a little lonely when she moved to England and then began to feel attached to him. But she knew she had to talk to him soon.</p>
<p>“Fleur, babe? Are you ok?” Bill reached her and stole her from her thoughts.</p>
<p>“Sure, just got lost in my zoughts.” She smiled faintly. And in a last minute decision, “I actually need to talk to you later” she whispered to him, making him tense up.</p>
<p>“Ok. After dinner?” He asked as his mother shushed them all from the kitchen, asking only Ginevra and Hermione to stay and help. Fleur nodded to him.</p>
<p>“I would be glad to ‘elp too, Molly.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not! Bill, go show her the house and where she will be staying, with the girls!” She said, making them get out of the room. Fleur heard a grunt coming from where she had been and was quite sure it came from the younger girls that stayed behind. “Ginevra Weasley, you are going to treat your brother’s girlfriend well! As will you Hermione!” The blonde heard the woman scold her daughter at her antics.</p>
<p>“Yes, mom. I’ll treat Phlegm all right.” Fleur frowned, she had heard that one while in Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament, but she had forgotten it completely.</p>
<p>“Enough with that silly nickname!”</p>
<p>“Babe, I’ll show you around.” Bill said, with his hand around her waist, making her stop paying attention to the other’s blathering. He showed her every room stopping at Ginevra’s to drop her baggage he had been carrying all along.</p>
<p>“Dinner is ready!” Molly said, poking her head out of the kitchen as they arrived at the room the others were. As they got inside and sat, she found herself stuck between Molly and Ginevra.</p>
<p>“Ginevra, would you pass me ze salt please?” She noticed that she might have said something very wrong as the girl had grown red in anger.</p>
<p>“Uh, you might want to call her Ginny, Fleur.” Harry smiled apologetically at her.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Unless you want a painful death.” Fred said, seriously.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. Won’t ‘appen again.” She said nodding slowly.</p>
<p>As they finished eating, she grew nervous. That was it, she was going to basically shatter the redheaded’s heart she was dating. She would regret it. Saying that to him now would make her look even worse. She saw Bill stand from his seat and invite her for a walk outside. Both of them were walking side by side, quietly. Once they were far enough from the house, Bill stopped and looked at her.</p>
<p>“You wanted to talk…” he said, quietly.</p>
<p>“Oui. Bill I don’t know ‘ow to say zis.” She begun, looking at her feet.</p>
<p>“Have you found them?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Fleur looked up into his eyes.</p>
<p>“Your mate. Have you found them?” The redhead smiled at her, sadly.</p>
<p>“Uh, ‘ow… ‘ow did you…”</p>
<p>“I just happen to know one or two part veela wizards. And they have found their mates.” Bill was now smiling at her sincerely, “And I just know I’m not yours. What we feel for each other isn’t what I heard a veela and its mate feel about each other. At least in my part.”</p>
<p>“Oh Bill!” Fleur hugged him dearly. “I’m sorry I didn’t talk about eet before!” She began to cry.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s ok. It’s not like you have been fooling me. You weren’t ready to talk about this and that eminent war made everything worse. We need each other.” He soothed her a little. “Now tell me. Who are they?”</p>
<p>“I ‘aven’t found my mate yet, Bill. I was just anguished about not telling you.” She said, leaning out.</p>
<p>“Oh. I see. Fleur, I…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. You are my friend, above all. I should ‘ave talked to you sooner.”</p>
<p>“It’s really ok, Fleur. I am your friend and happen to consider you my best friend. We were only in a friends with benefits phase.” He laughed. “No hard feelings. And if you want, I’d like to keep dating you.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?”</p>
<p>“Well, of course. The time I spent with you was really good. I love you. Just not the way mates are supposed to.” Fleur was awestruck. Of all the out comings she had imagined, this was not one of them. “Only please let me know when you find you mate. And don’t listen to my mother’s nonsense about marriage. She seems to think we should get married soon.”</p>
<p>“I will. Isn’t because you ‘ave been talking about me nonstop?” She gave him a smile and a soft peck on the lips. “And I love you too, I’m really sad you aren’t my mate but I’m sure you will eventually find the one for you and that’s why I can’t hold you behind by dating me.”</p>
<p>“And who said you would hold me back? Oh come on. No strings attached, we could try these open relationships.” He smiled at her. “We are at war, Fleur. It’s not like I’m going to find the love of my life now or anytime soon.” He hugged her and kissed her head.</p>
<p>“What did I do to deserve someone like you?” She said, leaning against him.</p>
<p>“What do you say?”</p>
<p>“Ok.”</p>
<p>“Good. Now let’s get back before mom starts to freak out that we are out for too long.”</p>
<p>They walked to the Burrow hugging and went to the living room where everyone was chatting. Apparently, while they were outside some of the other members of the Order arrived. The room was now crowded. The Burrow was strongly protected, they had a Fidelius Charm on it and at least four members of the Order were guarding it’s surrounding.</p>
<p>Molly decided that they should throw a birthday party for Harry. Some of them were against it,  Moody, above all. Somehow, the Death eaters found out and they were attacked.</p>
<p>Fleur wasn’t sure about what transpired because was busy fighting  one of them but she heard someone among her own yell “The lightening is gone!”. Relief. One by one, the Death Eaters retreated. And in the next afternoon a worried sick Molly received an otter patronus, letting her know that her son, Harry and Hermione were fine and that Dumbledore had left them something to do.</p>
<p>“They are just kids! Dumbledore was a crazy men!” An angry Molly stormed out of the room they all were. The Weasley’s clock had all its hands indicating ‘deadly danger’.</p>
<p>About a month after Fleur saw Molly say her goodbyes to her daughter. Even with the school being taken by Death Eaters, she had no choice. At least there the girl would be under some protection, McGonagall’s.</p>
