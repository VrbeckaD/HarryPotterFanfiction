          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Scared, Potter?"</p><p>"You wish."</p><p>"Then take the shot." A smirk graced Draco's lips as Harry huffed before throwing back something red and alcoholic. Everyone at the table jumped back when Harry breathed out a puff of fire, creating a large plumb of smoke over his end of the table.</p><p>A breath whispered in Harry’s ear through the smoke, "Come home with me tonight."</p><p>Harry startled and looked to his left where Draco was sipping a glass of white wine, and his right where Luna was staring dreamily at him. "That was wonderful Harry. Did you like the flavor?”</p><p>"Did you just...?" Harry brushed his hands along both cheeks back into his hair.</p><p>"Yes, I made the Dragon Shot. Why?" Luna tilted her head like a curious puppy and Harry shook his to clear his smoky thoughts. He immediately felt dizzy and decided that was a bad idea.</p><p>"Um, nothing Luna, I must have been mistaken. Yes, the shot was lovely, but strong. I'd rather not burn off anyone's eyebrows so maybe tone it down a bit? Maybe add something to dilute it?"</p><p>"I think so too, but red <em>is </em>my favorite color." She smiles serenely and looks towards her girlfriend.</p><p>Harry chuckles and places a brief kiss on her cheek. "I'm glad."</p><p>"Oi! Hands off the girlfriend Harry!" Ginny wraps her arm around Luna who snuggles into her side.</p><p>"Yes, yes, I know how jealous you Wesley's get. Right Ron?" Harry turns to his best friends and smiles lopsidedly at them. "Yule Ball, was it?"</p><p>"Piss off Harry! And I got the girl in the end, right?" Ron turns to Hermione and sends her a soppy smile. Harry cackles and turns to his left to tell Draco the story, but in his place is an empty wine glass.</p><p>"Where did Draco go?"</p><p>"Loo!" Blaise shouted. He was in the middle of some weird card/spoon/drinking game with Seamus, Dean, Pansy, and Neville but heard Harry all the same.</p><p>Being a bit dizzy it took longer than Harry expected to make it to the loo, but when he opened the door it was empty. Harry made his way over to a stall, but as he was shutting the door it was shoved open by Draco. He locked the door behind him.</p><p>"Come home with me tonight."</p><p>"Oh fuck, Draco, yes." Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and pulled him down for a deep kiss. Tongues wrapping around each other the instant their mouths opened. "Think anyone knows?" Harry asked once they separated.</p><p>Draco shrugged one shoulder. "Only everyone."</p><p>Harry chuckled. "I love you.” Draco’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Are you drunk, Potter?”</p><p>Harry smiled. “I just needed a little liquid courage.”</p></div>
