    <p>Hanzo Shimada was a patient man. He had been angry and brash - strict- when he was a boy. And then he killed his younger brother. He knows now that Genji survived -at what cost?- having found out from the man his brother became himself. Hanzo is a patient man, grown and tired with eyes that see truths clearer now ever before. So when Tracer's - Lena's- temporal anchor exploded outwards after being clipped by Widowmaker’s bullet, he did little more than turn to his lover Jesse McCree, and grab onto him with wide eyes as his dragons tried to protect them. Then there was-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     rushing</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     lights</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     spinning-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And both men fell to the ground with a thud, onto grass when they had just been in a city of metal and asphalt and man-made harshness.</p>
<p>    Hanzo was the first to get up, head still reeling from their apparent fall. Jesse was groaning next him, making Hanzo scoff at the cowboy as he looked around at what appeared to be a small neighborhood of identical houses, though it was hard to tell with only moonlight to see by. What caught Hanzo’s attention is how utterly simple - outdated- everything seemed to be. He licked his lip as Jesse sat up at last, turning to face him. “I do not think we are in the correct time, let alone the correct place.”</p>
<p>    That had Jesse paling, plopping his damned hat back onto his head as he too looked around with a calculating gaze few got to see -or live to remember- from the cowboy. “Well I'll b’darned, this's gon be a problem,” he muttered. Then he paused and peered through the night, eyes straining. “S’that a damn babe left on that there porch when it's this cold out?”</p>
<p>    Hanzo followed Jesse’s gaze to a house near them before pushing himself up with a grunt, Jesse following his lead. “It indeed seems to be a child. I cannot explain it, but I, or perhaps my dragons feel drawn to it.” Jesse mulled this over in quiet contemplation as they walked closer to the child, and house. The quiet shuffling of his boots in time with the sure footed clicks of Hanzo's prosthetics against the pavement resounded loudly in the stillness, everything so still that it seemed as nature itself was holding its breath so as not to ruin this meeting.</p>
<p>    He knelt before the babe, picking it up and holding it against his chest as he gave Jesse the card that had been laid on top of the sleeping child. “‘Dear Mr. N Missus Dursley -ugly name- I ahm sorry to inform you that yer sister an her husband have been murdered. Harry is the only survivor -poor kid-, and yer nephew. As his next ah kin, he has been given over to you ta raise. I ahm sorry for yer loss. Albus Dumbledore.’ Well ain't that just fine an dandy. Kid coulda died out here or they could rafused to take him in... Well, wha we gon do?” he asked, looking expectantly at Hanzo. “i ain't gonna let you leave him here, so you know. This Albus fellow sounds mighty stupid. Something bout it rubs me wrong.”</p>
<p>    Hanzo raised an eyebrow before looking down at the child - Harry- then sighing. “We could bring him to an orphanage… or we could raise him ourselves for now. I do not.. know how to get back to our time.” He looked slowly at Jesse who swallowed hard and nodded before looking away.</p>
<p>    “Yeah I figured.”</p>
<p>    “Come Jesse. If we are to raise a child we will need money, and proper identification.” With one last look at the house, Number 4 of Private Drive, the two men melted into the shadows, carrying a child destined for greatness, and changing the flow of destiny.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>    That morning when Petunia Dursley woke up, she did not scream at the sight of a baby left on her doorstep. She merely collected her milk and closed the door, unaware of her sister's passing, and the horrid life she almost forced upon a child.</p>
