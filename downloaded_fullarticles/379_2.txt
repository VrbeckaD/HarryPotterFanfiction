    <p>Lizzie sighed irritably for the hundredth time as a swarm of young children ran past her, nearly stepping on her pristinely white shoes. Her eyes roamed through the sea of foreign school robes desperately trying to catch a glimpse of familiar brown hair to no avail. </p><p> </p><p>Still no sign of her twin. </p><p> </p><p>Lizzie turned towards her mother with an annoyed glare. “Mom, are you sure Josie is coming? At this rate, we’re going to miss the train!”</p><p> </p><p>“Calm down honey.” Caroline put a reassuring hand on Lizzie’s shoulder. “I’m sure she’s on her way. She should be here any second now.”</p><p> </p><p>“This sucks,” Lizzie huffed, crossing her arms across her chest as her feet tapped the ground impatiently. “First she just goes off to Japan <em> without </em> me on some prestigious summer program at Mahoutokoro or whatever that stupid school is called, which she didn’t even <em> tell me </em> she applied to, and then she extends her stay last minute so she doesn’t even come back until the day we leave for our <em> brand new </em> wizarding school despite the fact that we’ve spent the last <em> four </em> years at Beauxbatons all because daddy <em> dearest </em> accepted a job offer as headmaster and he’s too much of a control freak to let us out of his sight.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ohh,” Caroline cooed empathetically as she patted her daughter’s shoulder comfortingly. She was used to Lizzie’s rants and knew that the best thing to do was just to let Lizzie spill it all out. “I know it’s been a rough summer without your dad or your twin, but hey, traveling across Africa with your mom wasn’t too bad, was it?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Lizzie grumbled reluctantly as she let her mother pull her in for a hug. </p><p> </p><p>“And this is a big deal for your father,” Caroline continued gently, always the voice of reason. “You know he always wanted to be a professor of some sort, but after he lost his powers-”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, I know,” Lizzie interrupted with a slight roll of her eyes. She knew all about her father’s lifelong dream. She’d witnessed enough of his not so secret irresponsible drinking at home when he thought her and Josie were asleep for the past few years, to know that it was a very big deal when he was offered this job. It was a topic that came with a lot of emotional baggage and the last thing she wanted to do was deal with how <em> she </em>felt about the repercussions that came with her father’s incessant want to be a professor ever since they were little. She had enough problems already right now. </p><p> </p><p>Like where in hell was Josie?</p><p> </p><p>But, Africa <em> was </em>nice. The best part obviously being that she was able to spend time with her mother, whom, given her job as an auror, was rarely ever around. Lizzie and Josie absolutely treasure the time they spend with their mother, so the summer was heavenly to Lizzie. Having her mother by her side made up for all the killer mosquitos she had to fight off and the excruciating summer heat that practically boiled her blood. Mostly.  </p><p> </p><p>Next to the platform, the train let out a loud whistle, signaling that the time for departure was soon. </p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Lizzie stated dryly, as she leaned even more into her mom’s embrace for support. “It’s official. Josie isn’t coming. She’s officially the worst sister ever. And Hogwarts is going to suck.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t be too quick to judge,” Caroline stated knowingly. </p><p> </p><p>Lizzie looked up and noticed her mom nodding at something or <em> someone </em> behind her with a wide smile. Lizzie whirled around, excitement already building up in her chest despite her mood earlier. </p><p> </p><p>As she zeroed in on a familiar blinding smile accompanied with bouncing soft brown curls racing towards them with a carriage full of belongings wildly swinging behind her, Lizzie couldn’t help but feel a swell of contentment rise up in her at the sight of her twin after three months of being apart. However, she squashed the feeling down just as quickly as it came, remembering that she was still mad at Josie, even if she desperately missed her. </p><p> </p><p>Josie didn’t seem to notice the edge in Lizzie’s stance because next thing Lizzie knew, Josie was jumping atop of her, pulling her into the tightest hug, and exclaiming her name <em> very </em>loudly into her right ear in excitement before exploding into a barrage of non-intelligible mutterings about how much she missed her. For a few seconds, Lizzie allowed herself to drop the cold act and just enjoy being back in her sister’s embrace. </p><p> </p><p>However a few seconds was all she allowed herself before she leaned back and fixed Josie a glare. Josie’s smile dropped slightly at the look and Lizzie had to steel herself to not be weak. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re late!” she huffed before coldly ignoring Josie and grabbing her stuff. She boarded the train without looking back once, not even bothering to acknowledge her mother.<br/><br/>Josie just watched her go with concerned eyes before turning to her mother for an explanation. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s just mad because she missed you,” Caroline provided with a knowing motherly smile. </p><p> </p><p>“Right,” Josie returned the smile with a small one, reassured that Lizzie wasn’t actually mad at her. “I kind of figured she would be. But don’t worry, I’ll fix it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure you will,” Caroline agreed before taking a hold of Josie so she could get a closer look at her daughter for the first time in three months. “So, I know we don’t have much time because you are <em> quite </em>late, but how are you? How was Japan?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m good,” Josie beamed, taking in her mother’s fondling. Spending all of summer alone in a foreign place took a little getting used to at first. She’d missed her family immensely. Lizzie especially. “And Japan was amazing,” she gushed. “I learned so much. Did you know that they have <em> seven </em> different spells for creating fire? Well technically nine, if you include-”</p><p> </p><p>“It sounds like you had a good time,” Caroline interrupted gently with a soft pat to Josie’s cheek, knowing that Josie also had a tendency to ramble like Lizzie whenever she got excited about something. “I would love to hear all about it later, but right now, you have a train to catch and a sister to appease.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re right,” Josie nodded. “Don’t want to keep an angry Lizzie waiting, do we?”</p><p> </p><p>“No we do not,” Caroline agreed with a grin.  Josie chuckled and pulled her mother in for one last goodbye hug before boarding the train. </p><p> </p><p>“Take care!” Caroline shouted after her daughter. “And tell Lizzie to take care too!”</p><p> </p><p>“We will mom!” Josie shouted back over her shoulder as the doors closed behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Caroline watched with fond eyes as the train sped away, taking her daughters further and further away from her. </p><p> </p><p>“Take care of them, Alaric,” she whispered into the wind as the train disappeared in the distance. Then she too disappeared into thin air. </p><p> </p><p>Duty called. </p><p> </p><hr/><p>

</p><p>Josie took a deep breath as she peeked down the busy train corridor. How was she going to find Lizzie? She decided her best bet was just to walk down the corridor and peek into each compartment until she found her twin. </p><p> </p><p>After five minutes, Josie had already traveled through two train cars with no sight of Lizzie, when a boy around her age suddenly walked up to her. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey! Are you looking for a compartment? We have some room in here, if you want to crash with us.” The boy gestured to the compartment behind him before sticking his hand out in front of him. “I’m MG by the way. Fifth year. Hufflepuff,” he introduced himself before scrutinizing Josie with kind eyes. “I don’t think I’ve seen you around before.”</p><p> </p><p>Josie, a bit startled by MG’s straightforwardness took a second to gather her wits. “I’m Josie,” she replied eventually with a reserved smile, taking MG’s hand and shaking it. “Josie Saltzman. It’s nice to meet you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Saltzman,” MG repeated, tilting his head mid-ponder. “As in our new headmaster Saltzman?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do I look like a middle aged man to you?” Josie joked, earning a loud laugh from MG. “But you’re close. I’m his daughter. I used to go to Beauxbatons but with our father’s new appointment as headmaster, he thought it’d be better if I received my education at Hogwarts instead.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, well then, may I be the first to say, welcome to Hogwarts, madame,” MG said with a bad impression of a French accent causing Josie to burst out in laughter. He grinned widely at her reaction. “I didn’t know he had a daughter,” MG continued. </p><p> </p><p>“Daughters,” Josie corrected lightly. “I have a twin, Lizzie. Fraternal though. I’m actually looking for her right now,” she said, peering over MG’s shoulder for any sign of Lizzie before returning her attention back to him.  “I don’t know if you’ve seen her. She’s a little taller, blonde hair, and in a bit of a mood at the moment.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think I’ve seen her. But if I do, I’ll let you know,” MG offered with a kind shrug. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Josie grinned. Despite it being only a few seconds since they met, Josie could already tell that MG was a joy to be around and he was glad to have met him. They could become good friends. “Well, I’m off to find my twin.”</p><p> </p><p>“My offer still stands,” MG called after her as she walked away. “If you need a compartment to stay, just knock.”</p><p> </p><p>Josie grinned at him. “I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>“See you around then, Saltzman,” MG smiled back. </p><p> </p><p>“You too!” Josie bid him farewell and continued her quest to find her angry twin. </p><p> </p><p>She finally found Lizzie brooding all alone in the last compartment. Taking a deep breath to prep herself, Josie slid open the door, not bothering to knock. Lizzie didn’t even look up at her. She just sat there silently staring angrily out the window. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh Lizzie,” Josie sighed at the sight of her miserable sister, feeling terribly knowing that she’d caused this. “Forgive me,” she pleaded. She slid into the seat across from her sister and took Lizzie’s hands into her own. “Please? You can’t be mad at me forever,” Josie pouted, knowing that Lizzie was weak whenever she pulled that face. </p><p> </p><p>Lizzie huffed and pulled her hands away from Josie, crossing her arms so Josie didn’t have access. </p><p> </p><p>Josie bit her lip with guilt. “I’m sorry I was late. And I’m sorry about extending my stay in Japan so last minute. I know you were excited about us hanging out before school started, but there was just so much I wanted to learn, I couldn’t give it up. But let me make it up to you. Please? We’re going to spend so much time exploring our new school together you’ll be sick of me by the time winter break comes around.”</p><p> </p><p>Josie could tell her apology was working by the softening lines on Lizzie’s face. </p><p> </p><p>“Unlikely,” Lizzie pouted and Josie had to fight back a small smile. Her sister was adorable at times, even when she was mad at her. </p><p> </p><p>“You know I can’t get sick of you, like ever,” Lizzie stated seriously. Upset blue eyes met gentle brown eyes for the first time. </p><p> </p><p>“Well that goes double for me,” Josie grinned softly. </p><p> </p><p>Lizzie scoffed, looking away once more. “Yeah right. You were the one that left halfway across the globe to get away from me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Josie forced Lizzie to look back at her. “That’s not true. I was always interested in Japanese culture. I wanted to go to Mahoutokoro ever since I found out there was a wizarding school in Japan. You know it was always my dream to study there. The entire summer there though, I missed you so much. It felt weird waking up and not seeing your face first thing in the morning. I missed our twin cuddles, gossip sessions, and even your admittedly sometimes annoying nagging.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Lizzie shot Josie a glare, which had the opposite effect as Josie only widened her grin knowing that Lizzie wasn’t actually offended. </p><p> </p><p>“And you know I was just doing everything I could to learn about how to-”</p><p> </p><p>“To stop the Merge, right,” Lizzie finished, her anger at her sister quickly deflating as <em> the </em> topic was brought up. </p><p> </p><p>It was as if a switch had been flipped as the atmosphere between the Saltzman twins changed completely, enveloping everything in a heavy grim silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you and mom find anything in Africa?” Josie asked quietly, breaking the tension. </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing helpful,” came Lizzie’s hopeless response. “You?”<br/><br/></p><p>“Unclear at the moment.” Josie’s lips pursed with worry as she took a second to just look at her twin, their future fate heavy on her shoulders. Wrought with emotions, Josie pulled Lizzie into a hug. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she apologized once more. “I hate it when we fight.”</p><p> </p><p>Lizzie fought back a sniffle, as she brought her arms up around her twin. “Me too.” </p><p> </p><p>She was done being mad at Josie. She missed her too much to keep up the cold act. And with so much uncertainty in their future, with a whole new school and classmates as well as the Merge to worry about, they were going to need each other now more than ever. </p><p> </p><p>"You know," Josie spoke up, breaking the tender moment. "You got tanner."</p><p> </p><p>Lizzie scowled into her sister's shoulder. "Dammit."</p><p> </p>
