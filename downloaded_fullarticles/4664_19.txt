Harry yelled and took a step forward. </p><p>The Gryffindor looked at him and smiled, "Oops, you moved."</p><p>With that, he plunged the knife into Draco and Harry screamed.  Time slowed down as the other Gryffindor let go of Draco and he stumbled back.  Harry ran to him and caught his body in his arms as they fell to the floor. </p><p>"Draco, Draco, you'll be okay.  Look at me." </p><p>The blond boy turned to Harry and tried to smile, but it came out as a grimace.  "Harry," he breathed.</p><p>"Shh, shh, don't talk.  I'll get you to the infirmary."</p><p>Draco shook his head.  "Harry, I know what's gonna happen.  I need you to be strong for me."</p><p>"No, no, no!  I'm not letting you die!"  Harry pulled out his wand and pointed to the wound in Draco's chest.  "Reparo!  Reparo!  Reparo, damn it!" </p><p>Draco gently took the wand from Harry's hand, "You and I both know that's not gonna work."  He started coughing.  Blood stained his lips.  "Harry, just hold me."</p><p>Silent tears streaming down his face, Harry did.  </p><p>Draco started singing softly, "You are my sunshine, my precious sunshine."</p><p>Harry let out a sob.</p><p>"You make me happy," -he started coughing again and more blood came out- "when skies are gray."</p><p>"Draco, save your breath.  You'll be okay."</p><p>"You'll never know, dear, how much I love you."  By this point, Draco was crying too. </p><p>Harry joined him for the last line, "Please don't take my sunshine away."</p><p>Draco smiled and went limp.  </p><p>"Draco?  Draco?  Baby, wake up.  Draco?"</p><p>Harry's breathing became erratic and he let out an anguished cry.</p><p>AN: Sorry?</p></div>
