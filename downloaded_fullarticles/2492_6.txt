"When did this happen?"</p><p>Albus sighed. "Many moons ago, my dear Minnie. We were just children."</p><p>Minerva inquired, "Why didn't you tell me?"</p><p>Albus muttered, "I wanted to, but I made an unbreakable vow with him that prevented me from telling you directly."</p><p>Minerva queried, "What happened between you two?"</p><p>Albus frowned. "I fell in love, so did he. For one reason or another, he ended it shortly before he declared war on the wizarding world."</p><p>Minerva patted him on the shoulder and smiled. "If you two didn't break up, then we would have never gotten together; Al."</p><p>Albus turned towards her and beamed, "You are absolutely right. Besides, I love you more than I ever loved him."</p><p>Minerva grinned. "I'm glad."</p></div>
