    <p>HARRY POTTER and the Sorcerous Staff</p><p>Chapter 1<br/>	It was a late, dark night in sleepy London Town, in a neighborhood where everyone went to bed before the hour of watershed. The streets were dark and sleepy in the late hour, the morning milk lorry far away yet with its daily rounds. The night was moonless and dark with the faint, humming electrical lights of the light posts humming sleepily in the dark. No one was around. A lonely setting, but also an important one.<br/>	For far in the dark a powerful and magical old man stood in his bent hat and crooked robes, banishing the lights one at a time with powerful incantations from his wrinkled old hands. When it was dark and lightless, his business could begin. He alighted from his magical motorcycle and strode down the street with a powerful importance and came to a stop outside an unassuming house. This is the one he thought to himself, nodding in confirmation.<br/>	At the doorstep he bent and left a basket, within which was a child. A mere infant. A baby still fresh and new to the world just as he was old and decrepit in turn. Upon the baby was a sealed letter in an envelope, tucked just so above the blanket. With a wave the magical man made this letter unravel through time until it had been vanished entirely.<br/>	Yes he thought with certainty, No one must ever know.</p><p>	In the wee hours of the morning the door opened and out stepped a woman, Petunia Dursley. She noticed the basket on the stoop and bent over for it, lifting the infant and eyeing him speculatively. The baby met her eyes calmly, staring at her over his glasses. This was no ordinary infant. Those eyes she thought, meeting his gaze. This baby was calm, calmer than any baby should be, with an assurance that belied the exactly one amount of years it had been living. Something isn't right she thought to herself as she hefted the wee babe; the baby had surprising heft for such a small infant.<br/>	And then she looked down, and her world had changed forever.</p>
