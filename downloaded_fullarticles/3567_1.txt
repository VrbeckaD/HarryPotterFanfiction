    <p>One sunny late afternoon when Hermione was sitting outside the Burrow under a tree reading her book she was interrupted by the deep tones of her friend and the new Minister of Magic Kingsley Shackelbolt. At first she was a little shocked to see the Minister of magic sit down next to her but when he started to ask her about her plans for the future she started to become curious as to why he was really there.</p>
<p>“I would very much consider it a personal favour if you would join the Aurors training program” He asked casually but with an air of authority</p>
<p>“I was planning to go into the Department of Magical law Enforcement for magical creature care and use my seat on the Wizengamort to help change some of the hideous laws that are incredibly out dated” said Hermione not wanting to sound rude but she couldn’t hide her disappointment at being asked to change her plans for herself, she thought after everything she would be free finally. She thought wrong.</p>
<p>“I’d like it if you would sit on the law review board that will be looking at all the laws and by-laws that are standing, you would have a say in the creation of new by-laws and the demolishment of others” said Kingsley with a little smile that looked close to a smirk knowing she would in no way give that up.</p>
<p>“Deal” she said holding out her hand for him to shake on it.</p>
<p>He took her hand, smiled and got up and started to walk back towards the house</p>
<p>“Wait” she called after him getting up and running towards him. He stopped and half turned back but didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Why do you want me to be an Auror” she asked “I doubt you’re personally recruiting every new Auror now” asked Hermione curiously</p>
<p>“Just the special ones Miss Granger, the ones I have great plans for” he said as he walked back into the house and floo’d away leaving Hermione confused and a little concerned.</p>
<p>What plans could the minister of magic have for her?</p>
<p>She walked inside to tell the Weasleys about her deal with the minister of magic and the change in plans for her future.</p>
<p>Everyone sitting around the kitchen table ready to eat dinner was excited for her news, everyone began wishing her well and speculating about the “future plans” the Minister of Magic had for their friend.</p>
<p>The only person not to speak was George. He had barely spoken since Fred’s funeral 6 weeks earlier and when he did it was only to Molly and occasionally Hermione. He got up from his seat next to his mother making it squeak along the floor a little and everyone stopped talking to looked at him as he walked over to Hermione who was sitting at the other end next to Mr Weasley.</p>
<p>He pulled her up from her chair gently and into a tight hug. Hermione hugged him back but could tell this hug was saying much more than just good luck.</p>
<p>George pulled back and rested his forehead against Hermione’s looking directly into her eyes</p>
<p>“I think you would make a brilliant Minister of Magic” he said taking the side of her face in his left hand and kissing her other cheek “please be safe” he whispered before letting her go and walking to the stairs.</p>
<p>“Thank…you…. George” said Hermione trying to hold her tears in as he disappeared up the stairs.</p>
<p>She had felt a part of the family for a long time now but since the war she realised that she was just as special to them as they were to her.</p>
<p>Everyone was a little touched by George’s action except Ron who didn’t like other people being that close to Hermione.</p>
<p>They were together now finally and he didn’t want anything to ruin that. </p>

<p align="center">***</p>
<p>3 weeks later Hermione was standing with Harry and Ron in front of the Fire place at the burrow.</p>
<p>Today they were to report for their first day of training. Adult life was beginning today and strangely that was scarier than anything they had faced before.</p>
<p>They spent the last few weeks talking about real life and discussing all the things they were afraid of now they had the change to be an adult.</p>
<p>Molly sat at the kitchen table watching at The Golden trio as they looked apprehensively at the fire place.</p>
<p>“We’ve ridden a dragon” said Hermione trying to boost their courage</p>
<p>“Fought hundreds of Death eaters” added Ron trepidation in his voice  </p>
<p>“Defeated the most powerful dark wizard in history” finished Harry</p>
<p>Still no one moved forward. This seemed harder then all of that. This was a new adventure and this time if they messed up they wouldn’t die they would just be called frauds and laughed at by the whole magical community.</p>
<p>Molly rolled her eyes and walked up behind them and wrapped her arm around all three of them squishing them together.</p>
<p>“It will be fine, you’ll all be great, in you go” she said as she stepped forward and pushed them into the fire place, grabbing a hand full of Floo powder she smiled before letting it go and shouting Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p>They could hear Molly laughing as the whooshed up the chimney all squished together.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Magic had undertaken some serious and drastic changes in the weeks following the end of what was now referred to as the Voldemort regime. Now he was actually dead with proof his name didn’t carry any fear. Kingsley had instructed the Daily prophet to use his name without the self-indulgent title. And without the fear of death or incarceration they were going full attack on any known Death eaters and Ministry staff that stood by and helped. Stories of what had happened to individuals had come out. Umbridge had been given page two with all of her transcreation’s starting with threatening to use an unforgivable curse on Harry Potter in front of other students right up to running the trials of the blood status. They were very honest and none of it was pretty for Umbridge, she was sent to Azkaban for 20 years for her crimes. Many others received the same sort of treatment but only Umbridge’s gave Hermione, Harry and Ron a sense of satisfaction. For the first few weeks most of the paper was obituaries, Percy had written Fred’s on behalf of the Weasleys. Hermione had cut it out and framed it with a photo of Fred laughing. Percy had surprised them with how beautiful and funny it was at the same time. Fred would had given him stick for being sappy but George had read it and gave Percy a little nod before wiping his tears away and going to his room.</p>
<p>The ministry itself had had a revamp the awful statue in the middle of the ministry foyer was replaced with one of multiple magical creatures that were smiling and standing together the words ‘<em>United we stand’ </em>carved along the bottom in every magical language. The entrance was by fire place only now. And thanks to Harry, Ron and Hermione sneaking in using Polyjuice everyone passed under a reveal fall. Gold sparkles drifted down like a waterfall as you stepped out of the fire place, the effect was quite pretty and gave you a slight tingle over your body as you stepped through. At first it was a full vail that you had to step through, but the magic was a little to strong and all the witches and wizards who has spelled their hair a different colour or length had stepped out bold or grey, so the security department tweaked it a little.           </p>
<p>The first day was just orientation. Hermione wasn’t surprised when they discovered they would be going through training apart. They each made a few friends with other people in their groups almost two hundred new recruits all split into 3 rotating training classes. They learnt that the first cuts to the program would be in 3 weeks as much as the magical world needed to feel safe not just anyone would do. They were first introduced to Morgana Shacklebolt the lead in Auror charge of training and several other instructors. They had found out through the daily prophets ‘<em>What really Happened’ </em>section that about 20 Aurors were arrested in the years leading up to the public discovery that Voldemort was back. Including Morgana, Kinsley’s twin sister.</p>
<p>Some of the twenty that were arrested went straight back to work to catch the remaining death eaters that had escaped. The others had agreed to train the new recruits until they were ready and take an early retirement. Azkaban prison had different effects on people’s career goals.</p>
<p>Hermione felt instantly bad for not knowing any of this the whole time she had known Kingsley she hadn’t thought to ask him if he had a family or what his reasons were for joining the Order of the Phoenix. She had been so close to the centre of the storm she had missed a lot of the devastation that was happening on the outside. Hermione had made a mental note to review every prisoners file in Azkaban just to ensure no-one was missed that shouldn’t be in there. </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>Training consisted of early morning, mid-afternoon or night training. They practiced duelling, learnt about the by-laws, Advanced potion making, Magical languages, hostage negotiations between magical creatures, Magical creature history, correct arresting procedure, emergency first assistance in case of injury, which Hermione had already taught herself while she was off with Harry and Ron.</p>
<p>They did team exercise through houses looking for manikins that had been transfigured alive, some would need rescuing and some would attack them, they had physical training as well which Hermione was not so excited about, they had to do magical obstacle courses and flying lessons.   </p>
<p>After 3 months of training and only ever really seeing anyone on the one day off a week that they got Harry and Hermione decided to move to Grimmauld place together.</p>
<p>They had begun to feel like they were treating the Burrow like a hotel passing each other as they came and went to training, shovelling down food before either running upstairs to sleep or to study or to go off to training again, despite what Molly had said while crying when they told her they would be moving out, it was time to be grown adults. Ron of course would never move out until he got married because there was no way he could feed himself to his satisfactory.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at Grimmauld place with all of their belongings Kreatcher arrived to take care of them.</p>
<p>No matter how many times Harry had set him free or requested he stay working restoring Hogwarts he wouldn’t leave Harry. He was even pleasant to Hermione and would make her favourite meals for when she was studying.</p>
<p>Training was going smoothly for Hermione she was top of her class as usual but unlike at school her peers respected her, no one was rude or mean and they would often ask Hermione for tips. But not the way Harry and Ron had done, they really listened and took on what she advised. One afternoon when she arrived for training she was advised that the Minister of Magic wanted to see her. Immediately she went straight to his office trying to think about what she had done wrong. She wasn’t helping the others enough for anyone to really notice so it’s not like cheating and she hadn’t failed anything so she couldn’t have been kicked out. Ok so the Flying section of her training wasn’t the best but who cares she could make up for all the skills she didn’t have on a broom with all the skills she had without one. As Hermione walked to the minister of Magics office she begun coming up with arguments for why she shouldn’t be kicked out due to her mediocre flying skills.</p>
<p>When she knocked on his door she was convinced her heart was going to jump out of her chest it was beating so hard and fast, when she opened the door and saw who was sitting in the office with the Minister of Magic and Amelia Bones Head of the Department of Law Enforcement her heart stopped.</p>
<p>Frozen in fear first then quickly hatred and anger and other emotions she couldn’t process.</p>
<p>“Please come and sit down Miss Granger” Said Amelia</p>
<p>“I’d rather stand thank you, what is this about Minister” she said with her eye locked on a familiar blond-haired boy from her past. He looks much more like the Malfoy she had known from Forth year then the last time she saw him. He was healthier somehow less mentally distressed and slightly less pale.           </p>
<p>Kingsley looked annoyed at the shortness from Hermione but seemed to not be altogether surprised by it “Mr Malfoy has been a great assistance to us since the war ended Miss Granger, he has supplied an almost complete recollection of everything he has witnessed and has supplied us with a great deal of insight which has made catching those involved a lot easier” he said calmly</p>
<p>“Want a medal Malfoy for finally doing the right thing for once in your pathetic life” Snapped Hermione angrily before casting an apologetic look at Kingsley. More surprisingly then her outburst was the lack of one from Malfoy he just sat in his chair and rolled his eyes as if he had expected her to be rude and mean and wasn’t going to do anything about it.</p>
<p>“What has this got to do with me” she asked looking between Amelia and Kingsley.   </p>
<p>Before the Minister could speak Amelia raised herself from the chair and pulled a small vial filled with silvery mist and placed it on the desk in between the Minister and Draco.</p>
<p>“There is one memory that Mr Malfoy has altered and will not relinquish” Said Amelia slightly annoyed as if she didn’t understand why this was such a massive thing that Draco would keep to himself.</p>
<p>“Again what…” but Hermione was cut off by Draco speaking for the first time.</p>
<p>“It’s from the manor” he said looking as his feet</p>
<p>Instantly Hermione was furious. They wanted her memory. The memory she had not shared with anyone not even Harry or Ron knew the full details. It was a pain that couldn’t be healed, that would never ease and she would never forget.</p>
<p>“Hermione we can see you in the memory so we know you were there but the time in which you were without Harry and Ron is blank, we can tell time has pasted as the clock in the memory changes but Mr Malfoy is reluctant to hand it over”</p>
<p>“Why” Shouted Hermione directly at Malfoy</p>
<p>“Why would you hold that back, you should be proud shouldn’t you, all you death eaters enjoy that sort of thing” she yelled as she advanced on Draco getting right up close to him</p>
<p>Draco stood up and pushing chair out from under him causing Hermione to take a step back.</p>
<p>“I didn’t choose to be a Death eater, I was forced…. they didn’t ask me…. do you know what it’s like to be marked without…..” he said through clenched teeth</p>
<p>His words were abruptly cut short by Hermione’s open right hand coming straight across his face with so much force his head shot to the side and he stumbled back a few steps. Auror training had made Hermione strong and fast.</p>
<p>Hermione pulled her left sleeve up with so much force you could hear a few of the stiches break.</p>
<p>She advanced on Malfoy and thrust her arm directly in front of his face so he had no option but to have a really good look at what had been carved into her arm.</p>
<p>“YOU STOOD THERE AND WATCHED” she yelled louder then she had ever heard her voice before.</p>
<p> “I know…… I couldn’t…. I’m sorry” said Malfoy with a genuine look of regret on his face. Hermione was too angry to notice.</p>
<p>“You’re sorry” she laughed “you’re not sorry, you couldn’t give a shit about me or any other mud blood you helped torture and kill” she spat at him, she could see that what she was saying had affected him although he hid it well.</p>
<p>All the while Kingsley and Amelia were standing watching both with wands in hand just in case but they too had apparently assumed some kind of altercation would take place and had decided that it would be better to let it happen and then maybe they could both move on.</p>
<p>“Miss Granger” interrupted Kingsley “Mr Malfoy hasn’t tortured anyone and hasn’t killed anyone either, we’ve reviewed his memories”.</p>
<p>“Not all of them” Said Hermione eyes flicking to the vial on the desk</p>
<p>“Miss Granger you’re not here to give us your memory if that’s what you think, Mr Malfoy has refused to hand over that particular moment without your permission”</p>
<p>“Why” Said Hermione looking at Draco</p>
<p>“I didn’t….. I don’t…. it’s private and I didn’t think……. I know you haven’t told anyone” he said not really able to find the words he wanted. He was ashamed by his inactions yes but he knew she wouldn’t want anyone seeing that moment not because she was ashamed but because they would look at her differently and pity was something they both had hated to see when people looked at them.</p>
<p>Hermione seemed to understand what he was saying that in some strange way this was his way of protection her, because he knew he should have in the first place.</p>
<p>“Why” Hermione asked again she wanted to hear him say it out loud.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to cause you further pain” he said quietly looking directly in her eyes</p>
<p>“What happens when you see this memory” asked Hermione not taking her eye away from Draco’s</p>
<p>“Mr Malfoy will be moved to a safe location until all the death eaters are caught, we are making excellent progress but it may take a while to get them all” Answered Amelia</p>
<p>“Running and Hiding how classy” said Hermione spitefully with a snide look on her face that Draco thought looked out of place on her. </p>
<p>“Fine… show them and leave, run away from the mess you helped make while everyone else cleans it up… well those of us still standing that is” said Hermione</p>
<p>She turned and walked out of the minister of Magic’s office without looking back or saying anything else.</p>
<p>As she stormed down the hall she started to get a hold of herself again and was instantly shocked at her behaviour. Kingsley may have been a friend and war buddy but she was way out of line in his office. She was instantly regretting her actions and outburst.  She wasn’t sure what had come over her it was not like her to act in such a way especially towards respected authority and most defiantly towards her new bosses.</p>
<p>Hermione returned to her training and spent the rest of the day trying to figure out what had gotten into her and hoped whatever it was wasn’t going to happen again. Thankfully tomorrow was Sunday and that meant she got to spend the day at home with Harry and then see Ron for dinner.</p>
