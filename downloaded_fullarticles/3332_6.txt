    <p>“—Love bears a color. Do you know which it is?”</p><p>His hot breath fanned across my neck like a peacock’s tail, unfurling in some obscene display of vanity and lust. He was too close—just close enough, <em>not</em> close enough depending on when you asked me—setting a trap like the seasoned hunter he was. It was either the wall or him, and that was really no question at all.</p><p>In any other situation, perhaps I would’ve bristled and pushed right back, but I could barely string together a sentence never mind put up a fight I was wholly unwilling to follow through with. In fact, I did not register his question until he pinched the skin of my hip, far enough away from his current area of focus that I jolted.</p><p>“Red?” I said, or thought I did, thinking of my mark—thinking of my hand. He chuckled and I felt the blunt pressure of his teeth at my ear. But his tongue followed soon after, and I forgave him.</p><p>At the time, I didn’t care for the question or the answer, but that he didn’t reply at all was odd. Tom loved to hear himself talk. That was all he did, some days—correct those less knowledgeable than he, dictate and command and expect to be obeyed without question. Most did. I, on the other hand, admitted that he had a very nice voice, but whether or not I was inclined to play along depended on the situation.</p><p>Now, however, it felt as if he’d forgotten a line in the script. He did not correct me, but I did not assume I was right. If anything, something was horribly wrong.</p><p>I pushed him back. He held like a mountain, head buried in the junction between my neck and my shoulder. By the flow of his breath I knew he was breathing me in, the scent I could not smell on myself the only fragrance he desired.</p><p>My worry brought back clarity. “Tom?”</p><p>He breathed out. I left his body, only to return upon his tongue when he pressed a wet kiss near my jawline.</p><p>“Harry,” he rasped, and he spoke in such a way that lost me all together. He was a million miles away, a thousand leagues beneath the sea, a hundred light years and a half across the universe, and yet the only thing he said was my name. I was pleased and anxious at the same time. It was rare that he addressed my importance to him—it was rare he spoke as if anything but himself was important to him.</p><p>“Tom? What’s wrong?”</p><p>I should’ve known, but that’s what they always say looking back into the past. It did not matter how many ‘what-if’s crossed my mind, how many ‘if-only’s I promised or begged. The past is the past. What was done was done.</p><p>He did not speak again. Instead, he resumed his task with renewed vigor that stole my mind away again. The memory of his disturbance did not leave me completely until he kissed me long and needy, and then I thought he’d simply had a bad day and wanted a bit of comfort. That, I was always willing to give without question, and so I forgot as he pulled me against him.</p><p>I should have known nothing was so simple with Tom Riddle.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was late that summer that he brought me to a secluded beach. I did not know exactly where we were, and as he offered no answer, I offered him no question. I trusted Tom inexplicably, even if I knew many people who would warn otherwise.</p><p>They were only working off what they knew, of course. We had our overt differences; I was quick to action—what he would call foolhardy—and he preferred action as the very last step in his grandiose schemes—the majority of which I might call overly complex.</p><p>We could butt heads like bulls, lock our antlers together until we bled our bodies dry, and that was what people saw: all the things that made us opposites.</p><p>But the marks on our hands were complementary. The red of my crystal and the green of his did not lie. And I will not lie, either; if we had any other color scarring our hands, perhaps I would not have gotten to know him, and he nor me, and neither of us would have ever been willing to learn how to trust each other.</p><p>The marks of our souls were two halves of a self-fulfilling prophecy, and I was inordinately glad for it, for it convinced me to learn his language and he, mine.</p><p>It was an uphill battle, sometimes. Tom built his appearance on being perfect because perfection, once established, was easy to trust. He told me once that people complied with perfection because they desired it for themselves, and as much as I wanted to argue otherwise, I had not found it false. Tom could be blunt to a fault when he wasn’t minding his words. It frustrated me how many times I was caught between vexed and flattered.</p><p>With his mask of perfection, it wasn’t always easy to handle knowing his imperfections. I could not deny I wanted to know them all, but upon each discovery, I troubled myself and stayed up late into the night, trying to wrap my head around the glaring flaws that made up his person. I wondered why I was acquainted with him at all, why I craved his companionship and valued his growing trust in me.</p><p>Then he would do something like this, take my hand in his, returning my bid for affection. He was just as human as everyone else was, feeling the same overwhelming emotions as the rest of us; I cared for him and he knew—even returned it in some measure—and because he did not know how to speak of it without botching it up, he told me in other ways.</p><p>We both did not care much for the beach; the ocean’s salt was not half as pleasant as the various perfume ads might imply, and while we could swim as well as the next person, our preferred entertainment lied elsewhere—him with his books and his notes, I with my broom or among friends. Still, it was a change of pace, and certainly fitting with how hot the weather had been as of late.</p><p>Cooling charms could only do so much. The sun was an insistent presence wherever we went. As an offhand remark, I said we traded our noses for our remaining comfort, and Tom had snorted but then quietly agreed.</p><p>It was also nice to take a break from society and enjoy time simply with each other. I was uncomfortable with crowds and strangers, but my friends were as good as family to me. Tom did not like people at all, though he was arguably the more social of the two of us simply because he minded his tools. Thus, an extended weekend alone was welcome; I thanked him for inviting me, and he said in more words and veiled metaphors that he wouldn’t have gone had it not been for me.</p><p>Though I hated the smell, I loved the perpetual breeze that came in with the sea. It brought with it relief from the sun as well as the memory of the sky; without a broom, I could not fly, and so upon the sand with my toes cold and wet was the closest I could get. I think Tom knew, because we ended up walking more than we swam.</p><p>I was perfectly willing to spend the whole time unwinding with Tom. We could do whatever—I didn’t care—as long as we were together and it wasn’t categorized as ‘work’ or ‘dangerous.’</p><p>We walked along until the end of the beach, and from there we swam around the cliff side until a small opening presented itself. The ceiling was low, and it was only possible to see now at low tide. The other times we were near, it had looked just like the rest of the cliff. Unlike the previous times, Tom lead me over. We then swam beneath it, our heads just shy of bumping against the rock.</p><p>“Where are we?” I finally asked, because for some reason it felt important to know now.</p><p>Tom did not answer right away. He led us further in to the crescent shore. The sand felt different here, the grains even softer beneath my feet, and they glittered with some unknown substance when the light hit them just so. Upon closer inspection, I realized they were seashells, buried deep and undisturbed by nothing but the waves. Each was colorful, smooth, and lustrous—cartoon stars in an imaginary sky. Had I not known better, I would’ve assumed they were fake.</p><p>“We’re not in Britain anymore, are we,” I stated, flat.</p><p>“No,” Tom said. “We’re farther south than that.”</p><p>“Greece?”</p><p>“Around,” Tom hedged, purposely vague and unrepentant for it.</p><p>I shrugged. It wasn’t the question I wanted to ask anymore. “<em>Why</em> are we here, then.”</p><p>“You have your wand?”</p><p>Exasperated, I nodded. The day Tom stopped springing surprises on me was the day we stopped being soulmates. He had bought me a wand holster several months ago for that explicit reason—though maybe it was also because he tired of seeing me pull it from my boots. I only owned one pair and thought I took fairly good care of them, but Tom never failed to glare at them when he thought I wasn’t looking.</p><p>They were high quality dragonhide. I didn’t skimp on protecting my feet; who knew when I would have to run from a dangerous situation. That was probably the only reason Tom hadn’t tried throwing them away and buying a more fashionable pair for me. So, I kept my boots, and he didn’t mention them. I did appreciate the wand holster, though.</p><p>“We’re going treasure hunting,” he declared.</p><p>I twisted away from the seashells I’d been eyeing. “Treasure hunting,” I repeated.</p><p>“Treasure hunting,” he confirmed. Then he headed for the cliff side further into the beach, leaving me to follow.</p><p>“Tom!” I called, speeding up to a brisk pace. Once I’d caught up, I said, “You can’t just say those things without explaining some. What’s the treasure, for one.”</p><p>His attention slid over to me out of the corner of his eyes. I gulped, seeing nothing but his amusement, but even that set me on edge. I trusted Tom with my life, true, but with my dignity was a whole other matter. ‘Treasure hunting’ usually involved some sort of obstruction or challenge. Would I fumble and make a fool of myself? Only Tom knew.</p><p>“Excited?” he asked, low and ominous.</p><p>And I, honest to a fault, replied, “Not anymore.”</p><p>Tom laughed. “A little faith, darling,” he said with a degree more of mockery than affection, “I could’ve brought us here during high tide instead.”</p><p>“…Right. When’s the tide coming in again?”</p><p>He seemed to enjoy my growing panic. “Now, would I do that? Put us on a tight schedule simply to watch you flounder?”</p><p>“Yes,” I replied without additional thought.</p><p>Tom sighed. “We can apparate, Harry.”</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest. “So why didn’t we apparate here, then?”</p><p>“I thought you would enjoy the view.”</p><p>Now, if it were months ago, I admit I would have completely ignored his answer. Tom did not mind lying by misconstruction or distraction. The only thing I could take at face value without putting myself at risk were his promises, and those were difficult enough to wrangle out of him.</p><p>However, as I learned, that did not mean everything he said needed to be put under suspicion. He told me once that the best lies were mixed with the best truths; it merely took some skill and attention to extract one from the other.</p><p>So, instead of waving off his answer, which would earn his silent morosity, I slid my hand into his and confessed like a secret, “I did enjoy the walk.”</p><p>“And the swim?”</p><p>“Especially the swim,” I told him. “It felt like going on an adventure.”</p><p>Tom hummed, pleased. “The adventure continues.”</p><p>“Treasure hunting?” I prodded, hoping I sounded less wary this time. And honestly, I was—now that he had assured our (relative) safety, my attention turned to what object could attract his interest.</p><p>“Would you like to hear a story?” he asked.</p><p>And, because I knew it would please him—to make things fair, my curiosity was also piqued—I urged him on.</p><p>“You are aware of the different types of merfolk.”</p><p>“I did take Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts,” I reminded him.</p><p>His snort told me exactly what he thought of that class. Still, I dared to nudge him with my elbow—it had been a fun class, and he knew how much I adored my beastly friends.</p><p>“You were correct as to our rough location,” Tom continued. “We are not in Britain; we stand closer to Greece. At the same time, it would be false to give a country’s name to this place—here or there, the answer is neither.”</p><p>I should’ve known Tom would not take me somewhere mundane. Salazar Slytherin would’ve had a difficult time convincing him to go to a tourist trap as a vacation, and Tom idolized his ancestor.</p><p>“Like an untraceable plot of land?” I asked.</p><p>“Something similar. A minor dimensional tear, millennia old, created this place. The doorway is not always the same. It may be in Greece; it may not be. The location is ephemeral—but not untraceable.”</p><p>I squeezed his hand, delighted once more and thankful. I could not help but think how far we’ve come together, how he cared enough to share his discovery with me. It was not yet to the point that I thought he would do it <em>for</em> me—that distinction was a particularly important one, and I did not think so much of myself to dare that thought yet.</p><p>Still, I was touched, and impressed, and I wished to convey in a non-embarrassing manner how proud I was of his achievement. I did not think it was easy—nothing Tom ever did was.</p><p>He preened under my gaze, his smirk shallow compared to the earnest pleasure in his eyes. I loved to see him happy, and it was better still that <em>I</em> had been the cause of his happiness. It pleased him that I was pleased, and I was pleased because I had pleased him. In this manner, we took pleasure in one another like two hummingbirds fluttering about the same flower, partaking in something intimate and innocent.</p><p>We moved together as it happened—just a second of time, but worth so much more in heart and weight. Times like these convinced me well and true that no other but he could be the mate to my soul.</p><p>Tom was a difficult person to please; I was learning how to manage it, and though I was yet to be perfect, my speed of improvement would make a cheetah flush in shame.</p><p>“What’s this to do with mermaids?” I asked.</p><p>“You could say this is the nesting place for one of the longest surviving colonies. We are currently in the season they come.” At my horrified look, Tom’s smirk grew wider. “Fret not; I have taken precautions to erase our trace. Regardless, they only come at high tide.”</p><p>“The-the beach?”</p><p>“It is only this cove they go to,” Tom clarified. “The beach can be here or there.”</p><p>I somewhat understood. The cliff we swam beneath must’ve been the doorway he talked about, but how it operated I did not know. Mollified, I decided to enjoy it as it was. Tom was a Slytherin through-and-through; it had been his Hogwarts house, and the blood of Salazar himself ran through his veins. If this trip proved life-threatening, he would be the first to notice.</p><p>Certainly, he had not survived so long with his penchant for dangerous studies had he not exhibited due caution.</p><p>“As you can imagine, a secret dimension hides more than a pod of mermaids. We’ve arrived.”</p><p>We had walked along the rock until a dip in the earth led us lower; there, hidden beneath a jutting rock piece and several other well-placed boulders was a cave entrance. I could not see farther than several meters within, and that was hardly enough information to tell exactly why this place was important. So, I left my inspection and turned instead to Tom. I found him watching me as well.</p><p>“There is a reason why this place attracts merfolk. It is incomparably safe, yes, but they were first drawn here for a more compelling reason.”</p><p>“Treasure hunting?” I asked again.</p><p>Tom smiled, all indulgence this time. “Indeed. Legend tells of a siren who once fell in love with a human. She brought him here, providing him safety from her kind who would’ve otherwise killed him with their voices. However, at the time, a giant sea serpent lived in the cove. When she went to visit him one day, the serpent was awake and attempted to devour her for trespassing.”</p><p>“A romance story for the ages,” I quipped.</p><p>“The oldest love stories often end in tragedy,” Tom remarked. “This one is no different. The siren managed to escape to this cave, though her bird half had been eaten by the serpent. Near death, her last wish was to see her lover again. As you can imagine, he was horrified to see her in such a state, and in an attempt to save her, he tried to replace her missing limbs with fish parts.”</p><p>“That’s…” I felt a bit queasy at the image of it. The sight of blood was not an issue for me, but the thought of a naked woman with large pieces of her bitten away—blood splattered over the stone cavern floor, caked over her skin as a replacement for cloth—and equally bloody chunks of fish sewn on in a poor parody of muggle surgery was…disturbing at best.</p><p>Tom continued, completely unaffected. “You may suppose that his solution did not quite work, and you would be correct. As her last final act, she sung to him—a voice he had never heard before, as she previously refrained from singing to keep him safe. Whether it was the power of her love or, more possibly, the power of her magic, upon her death she was reborn as the Mediterranean mermaid you know today.”</p><p>“What happened to the man?”</p><p>“Oh, him. She ate him.”</p><p>I choked. “What?!”</p><p>“Oh yes,” Tom said, not one bit disturbed. “When I said she was reborn, I did mean exactly that—there and then, her body fused with the fish parts her lover had used in an attempt to save her. Upon awakening, she found herself severely starving—I imagine rebirth takes large amounts of energy, so it was only natural. Her first sight was her lover, who was elated to see her revival…then horrified, for she lunged at him, mistaking him for food, to sate her hunger.”</p><p>“And she just…” this time, the repulsion must’ve shown on my face, for Tom did not allow me to finish and nodded along.</p><p>“She ate him entirely before she returned to her senses. He arguably kept her alive; had she not eaten something she would’ve died of hunger. As you know, the magic that sustains us lends some sort of buffer. We can go longer without food or drink, have more immunity to mundane illnesses. However, her magic had been drained dry due to her revival, leaving her vulnerable, and thus she would not have been long for this world without sustenance.”</p><p>“You’re taking me in here why?”</p><p>Tom chuckled. “Patience. I must finish. Upon realization that she had eaten her lover, she wept and decided to join him in death. Thus, she plucked her scales one by one and cast them into the ocean. These became the first mermaids. Her hair, she braided in a bundle and then cut. This blessed all her descendants with her beauty. Covered in the blood of herself and her lover, she performed a powerful ritual to slay the serpent, declaring this cove a sanctuary for others who might follow her.”</p><p>“Please tell me we’re not going in there to desecrate her corpse.”</p><p>“We’re not going in there to desecrate her corpse,” Tom replied succinctly. “It’s long gone, regardless. As a final act of her despair and self-hatred, she also sacrificed the body that had consumed her lover. The pieces of her shattered and scattered, becoming the shells along the beach.”</p><p>I decided to watch where I stepped once we left. “So if we’re not going tomb raiding—” I waited a beat, just to see if he would correct me and say we <em>were</em> going tomb raiding, “—then what treasure are we hunting?”</p><p>“I’ll show you instead,” Tom said, and then ducked into the cave. As we were holding hands, I was pulled along with him, though the force was more like a soft tug. The idea of adventure attracted me, and so I was more than willing to follow—even after that morbid story.</p><p>We both pulled out our wands and cast a lighting spell.</p><p>Eventually the thin winding path ended, filling out into a larger cavern. The light from our spells faded, as there was no need for them here; crystals embedded in the very walls provided a waxy glow. It was like being in a room with a hundred—no, a thousand candles, their flames all cradled in the center of the waxen shell. I swiveled my head left and right, trying to take in the entire view all at once.</p><p>“Well,” I said, “That was easy.”</p><p>Tom chuckled. “We’ve not found the treasure yet, darling.”</p><p>“No? Seems like treasure to me.”</p><p>Amused, Tom shook his head. He pulled me along and I complied, though my focus was more on the walls than where we were going. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the crystals were actually shells: seashells, just like those buried in the sandy beach above.</p><p>At some point, I felt us descend. There were no stairs, but the stone floor of the cave tilted into a long, loose spiral downward. The seashell lights appeared to be a permanent fixture, so I eventually tired of them and refocused on our direction. Tom continued at the same leisurely pace, so I too naturally did not panic.</p><p>The further we went, the colder it became. I stiffened when I felt the caress of a draft; it was not my imagination either, for my bare torso was not in any state to tell a lie.</p><p>At the very end of the path was another smaller cavern. Even the ground was embellished with those glowing seashells—I knew then that we had reached our destination. The draft had become stronger, the breeze brazen and the following chill glacial. In the very center was a pool of water. I could not tell whether or not its sheen was a reflection of the shells’ lights, or if it was from some inner magic yet unidentified.</p><p>“If we follow the story, this place is where she perished.”</p><p>“It feels just as creepy as it sounds,” I muttered.</p><p>“Is it?” Tom asked. “I find it fascinating—she was driven mad from her actions, that which she had performed to survive. In the end, it was all for naught; she killed herself anyway. The end was not much different than it would’ve been—eventually, her lover would’ve died, either to the serpent or another siren passing by. Perhaps she herself would’ve killed him; a mere melody would’ve lured him out to his death.</p><p>“Death was their fate, and yet if the story is to be believed, her foolishness created an entire new race of magical beings. Would that be considered a reward, or fate’s mockery? Life, cast from a life who no longer wanted it.”</p><p>It was indeed a great irony. Tom criticized her, calling her foolish, and yet I thought her an admirable soul. She could’ve committed suicide after realizing the barbaric truth, and yet, she hadn’t. Instead, she had considered those who would come after her—those who would inevitably feel the same love she had felt, perhaps feel the same pain as the pairs were rend apart by death, or by their own identities.</p><p>I was reminded of something I heard on the streets of muggle London. It was a passing conversation, and I a passerby, and yet it stuck with me until now. I quoted it then: “If a bird and a fish were to fall in love, where would they live?”</p><p>Tom being Tom, provided an answer. “There is no difference between the sea and sky in death.”</p><p>“But that’s not living, is it?”</p><p>“Certainly not,” he replied. “To die for love is a foolish thing. What love can exist in the void that is death? But when the ignorant are desperate, they turn to the things still unknown; death is a void, or a hole. They fall through together, seeking something that doesn’t exist on the other side. It is a fool’s quest, and only foolish fish and foolish birds would fall in love. Hence, death.”</p><p>My heart ached, and I did not understand why. “What if they weren’t foolish?” I asked. “What if they were…”</p><p>“Marked?”</p><p>I squeezed his hand as if it would bring back moisture to my throat. It didn’t. “Yes,” I said, because that was all I could say. I feared his reply.</p><p>Whether or not what he said next were his true thoughts, I didn’t know. I hoped they were; I prayed to the gods they were. I did not know what happened to him in the past, would not know until he told me, but I knew something was there—a person didn’t become like Tom without a reason. If this was a lie, let it be so, but if it was truth, I wish I had told him I loved him then and there.</p><p>“Love is a choice,” he told me, very carefully and deliberately. And yet still, even in that slow and easy pace, he was calm and held certain. That was why it was so difficult to prove he told a lie—in the moments that he spoke, he did not leave one pinprick loose that his words were false.</p><p>“The world will lay out any array of things, scatter them by the four winds to travel along the ocean’s waves. We see these things and try to connect them—that is the manner of humans. What symbols we find, true or not, convince us to believe certain thoughts, fact or fiction.”</p><p>“Is love false?” I asked, trying to hide my trepidation.</p><p>“It is a choice,” Tom repeated, not unkindly or too gentle. “No matter what reasons there are behind the choice that is made, it is a choice. If the bird and the fish are bound by souls, so be it; they are bound. Their love is a separate matter altogether. If they choose to love, they are foolish—”</p><p>“But?” I whispered.</p><p>He turned to face me then, and I thought I saw something curious reflected in his eyes. This was a horrible, terrible place for a conversation such as this, but it was Tom and somehow that gave it a little more sense than it deserved. I wished I could say it was perfect, but it was the farthest from. The wind did not stop for us; the ghosts of the past still existed…but.</p><p>All I wanted to know was his hand in mine.</p><p>Tom smiled, close-lipped and slight. It appeared so fragile I wished to support it with my own two hands, while simultaneously I feared to touch it lest it flake away into sheets of ice.</p><p>“But it is not false,” he said to me.</p><p>And I hoped that it was true.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The treasure hunt that summer had been successful. From the cove, we had managed to collect something Tom called ‘mermaid tears.’ I had thought them sea glass upon first inspection, but they did have some sort of magical aura that made me hesitant to touch. Tom had packed the colorful shards away in a pouch, and I did not see them again until long later.</p><p>December came, and as per tradition, the annual Weasley family-and-friends Yule dinner came as well.</p><p>Needless to say, Tom was not looking forward to it. Still, he had promised me the first time that he would come if I came, and so we would go without question. To balance the bill, I would attend the Malfoys’ Yule Ball as his plus one, and act cordial and polite as he did for me.</p><p>We ran in different circles, to say the least. Most of my friends did not like Tom, but they tried to be nice—he was my soulmate, and would not be going anywhere for some time. That he made me happy was the reason they accepted him into their house and home, unquestionably. I loved them for it, because Tom was an acquired taste and few would suffer the acquiring process.</p><p>Of course, one of the longstanding issues they had with him didn’t have much to do with his personality at all—it was his age. Tom was fifty-four years older than I, and yet somehow, we were soulmates.</p><p>It was an uncommon situation. Rare. Soulmates were usually born closer in years together; it was something about how souls worked, Tom had once told me. Soul magic was an unstable, unstudied field, but Tom had delved into it early on. He wanted to know why his soul mark came so late—why we were born so far apart, why our souls were held separate in a revolution that would not coincide.</p><p>A soulmate’s existence was to serve as balance. Magic could be a fickle thing, and the human form was not made to accommodate its whims. Hence, the existence of a soulmate on earth—regardless of location—ensured that the soul was large enough to contain a wizard or witch’s magic.</p><p>But Tom had been born, had lived, without one. He had not gone mad, had not become a victim of his own power. It was surprising, and it was not—his control had always been legendary; how else would he have been able to cast wandless magic? And so he lived depending on no one but himself…until I was born.</p><p>He was old, and he was not. The only sign of his age was that his hair was not so dark as mine, and the wisdom in his eyes could not have existed in one younger than he. It offset many of my friends, especially Hermione—she grew up in the muggle world where such a relationship would have been vilified and condemned without question. She was unaccustomed to a wizard’s life span, especially one as powerful as he, and it showed in that she was the least comfortable interacting with him.</p><p>I, on the other hand, had long come to terms with it. My affection for him was not solely because he was my soulmate—that had been the terms of our acquaintanceship. Sometimes the difference between he and I showed in our conversations; devils would sooner drink holy water than Tom contenting himself with my ignorance. But in times like those, he was rarely condescending, and that helped.</p><p>I once thought he would’ve made a good teacher. Then he snapped at Ron’s owl when it collided with the window, and I left that thought well alone.</p><p>Putting the fact that he was old enough to be my grandfather aside—though no one dared to forget; with his appearance, it was easy to and that made them all the more insistent on remembering—this was not the first Weasley dinner he had attended, and so there was little to fret about.</p><p>Everyone would be perfectly on their toes, perfectly polite, and he would return the same courtesy, for it would please me and he would rather face my friends than my ire.</p><p>I did say it would be a Weasley dinner, but the name was not inclusive enough. Any friend of the Weasleys came, and in particular, the significant others of their family members. I was considered an honorary member—along with Hermione, who had once dated Ron until she found her soulmate in a Bulgarian named Viktor Krum—and so the invitation was more tradition than necessary. I would come as I always did, bringing along Tom.</p><p>This helped, I suppose. The extra attendees ensured a wide variety of people, and so the significance of Tom dimmed somewhat. There were also people genuinely pleased to meet with him; Viktor, for example, respected Tom for his expertise and followed many of his publications. Bill, the eldest Weasley sibling, also got along well enough with him. They bonded over stories of dangerous adventures, common for Bill as his job was a curse breaker for Gringotts.</p><p>Charlie, the second eldest sibling, might’ve been a contender had his focus not been so tightly held by dragons. Instead, he merely respected Tom from afar as one with superior knowledge than he. I supposed that was good enough. None of the Weasleys were openly hostile.</p><p>There was also Andromeda Tonks, whose maiden name was Black. She was distantly related to Molly Weasley. Though she had been disowned by her family because of her marriage to muggleborn Ted Tonks, she was indeed a Black daughter and was quite comfortable speaking in the realm that Tom was more accustomed to.</p><p>And so, dinner proceeded. The Weasleys once again somehow made room for everyone at their table, I once more enjoyed the company of my friends all at once—which was a difficult task to accomplish with our busy schedules—and Tom passed the time either with me, conversing to the very few people who would like to, or locked in a game of chess with Andromeda.</p><p>I noticed Ron side-eyeing that particular table, but because he was warier than interested, I let it go. He was a longtime friend—my first, I would claim—and I knew he often worried even when he was masterful at disguising it. Beneath layers of inattention and laziness, Ron was sharp. He wouldn’t be able to go toe-to-toe on the chessboard with Andromeda otherwise.</p><p>“So how’ve you been, Harry?” he asked, sprawled out on a couch and patting his dinner-full belly.</p><p>I knew he wasn’t actually asking how my week had gone, because we had already discussed that over dinner. However, I didn’t like the other answer my brain had come up with either, so instead I hummed, and watched as Fred and George set up yet another prank. I reminded myself to steer clear of the house plant until someone else tripped it.</p><p>Hermione would be joining us at any moment.</p><p>“Things have been good,” I finally said.</p><p>“Good? So managing, are you?”</p><p>“<em>Ron.</em>”</p><p>At my reprimand, he muttered an apology. “Just want to make sure you’re alright, mate. You never did say where you went on vacation, you know.”</p><p>“That was months ago,” I exclaimed, baffled.</p><p>“Heads up that Hermione will probably ask, too,” he said. Then we fell silent.</p><p>He was worried and I wished to reassure him. The vacation had been amazing and we weren’t mauled by mermaids—but if I said that, he’d probably look as if I’d gone mad and insist on a checkup at St. Mungo’s.</p><p>Fair enough. I gave him that a weekend getaway where no owl could reach me might worry him—specifically that I didn’t know where we were going, either. I was a capable wizard, but Tom was even more capable—who knew if his idea of a vacation was raiding a pharaoh’s forsaken cursed tomb, or something. Or something to deal with spiders. Ron was traumatized from a stint in our Hogwarts years.</p><p>“Harry, Ron!” Hermione greeted, finally among us again. She hugged us both, though she had hugged us before dinner as well.</p><p>“You’re looking good, Hermione,” Ron mumbled as he returned her hug. He nodded to Viktor in greeting, who was standing across the room in a conversation with Charlie.</p><p>“Thanks—as are you both. Um, you look a little tanner, Harry?”</p><p>I smiled, helpless. I figured I might as well get this over with. “Tom took us to a beach during the summer.”</p><p>“Oh, yes!” She clapped her hands and ushered us all to sit squished in one couch. “Where did you go? How was it? You didn’t say in your letter!”</p><p>I did want to brag about Tom’s brilliant feat—Hermione would be in awe, surely—but I knew it was not what he wanted, and just as well I desired to keep that secret place between him and I…even from my dearest friends. So instead, I said, “It was somewhere in the Mediterranean, I think—I can’t recall the name. And it was beautiful; clean sands and clear skies.”</p><p>Hermione squeezed my hand. She was probably relieved it was some little mundane vacation rather than whatever else she had thought it was. “I’m happy to hear it. Perhaps Viktor and I should go next summer; we haven’t been to the beach in a while.”</p><p>“You should,” I agreed, and wound my arms around her so all three of us formed some awkward looking pretzel. “Anything new with you?”</p><p>Ron scratched his cheek. “Well…the department got a new case recently.”</p><p>“Another one?” Hermione furrowed her brow. “You just finished one.”</p><p>“Crime doesn’t rest? I dunno.” He shrugged. “Well anyway, it’s still new so there’s not a lot of information, but…”</p><p>He paused, and in one practiced motion, Hermione set up an additional privacy ward. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Tom turn our way. He was particularly sensitive to magic, so I nudged him back with a tendril of mine. We were fine, I told him, just talking.</p><p>He inclined his head and turned back to his chess game.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ron had said, “Something’s going on. Overseas. It’s not exactly in our jurisdiction, so…”</p><p>Hermione frowned. Then she slowly repeated, “Overseas…”</p><p>His gaze turned sharp. “You heard anything?”</p><p>“It…wasn’t big,” she began, “And I didn’t really think much of it. But Viktor got a letter from his family while we were stopping in Germany, and...”</p><p>That didn’t sound good. “And?” I prodded.</p><p>“He didn’t really tell me what it said. But we left the next morning, and I thought he looked a little worried. At the time I just thought he didn’t want to be late—you know Viktor, he’s always very punctual—but it was odd.”</p><p>Ron frowned. “Isn’t his family some uptight pureblood family?”</p><p>Hermione scowled. “Ron! <em>No</em>. They aren’t ‘uptight’ in the least—though pureblood, yes,” she admitted. “The last time we had dinner with them they were very pleasant to me. I think they just want him to be happy.”</p><p>Or, I thought, they respected the meaning of soulmates. Viktor’s family certainly followed Tom’s writings. They would know about his published studies in soul magic. Souls were worth more than blood.</p><p>“Huh,” Ron drawled. “Well coincidentally, our spy thought there was something wrong in Germany, too.”</p><p>All three of us grew quiet. Germany the country, we had nothing against, but with the war having been so close to our generation, it was not surprising that the name held some connotations. Trouble stirring in Germany gave us all chills. It reminded us of the late Gellert Grindelwald, who the older generation told us stories about—terrible stories that were enough to give any child chills.</p><p>In retrospect, looking back, it was entirely unexpected we would have news—or some inkling of news—about Grindelwald. We three, no more important than the rest, just friends with a penchant for attracting trouble, heard the warning bells before many else did. I would not have regaled this tale of a Hogwarts trio catching up on the times elsewise—I simply thought it funny that we could’ve known. But we didn’t, and the conversation was forgotten when we each independently pushed it all away.</p><p>What did we know—an Auror, a low Ministry of Magic employee, and a wandmaker? There was not enough evidence to connect the pieces then.</p><p>I noticed near the end of our conversation that the chess game had finished, and Tom was now talking to Viktor. I also thought nothing of this; it was normal, and the rest of the party passed in a similarly mundane fashion.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Malfoy Yule Ball was a gathering of elitists. Or at least, that was my opinion of it. Purebloods were as common as grass, the oldest and most powerful families all in attendance. There were Blacks, Notts, Greengrasses, Lestranges, Carrows, Averys, Crabbes and Goyles—all ‘dark’ families. Of course, the Malfoys being the host, there were more neutral guests in attendance as well.</p><p>The Weasleys were not in attendance (something to do with a blood feud, I surmised), but the Abbotts were, as well as the Diggorys. Other individuals with political status were a dime a dozen.</p><p>I felt out of place. My robes fit perfectly—of course they would, specially tailored and high quality as they were—but they still felt like shackles with every step I took. I was unused to dressing up. The only parties I ever went to were weddings, and there I was friends with some of the guests. Here, I hardly knew anyone, and those I knew were with string-thin ties.</p><p>For Tom, I bore it. He was worth seeing all my old Slytherin classmates again, worth wearing these stuffy dress robes, worth putting up with all the staring. Here, the gulf between Tom and I was our social status. By blood we were the same, if one ignored the Slytherin name, but status and repute was a whole other matter.</p><p>If things had been different, perhaps I would’ve been in attendance regardless of Tom. The Potter name made it possible, but in the end I chose my lion’s pride and a small wand shop. I did not regret that choice.</p><p>The pleasantries were simple, if not exceedingly dull. Tom led me over to the host of the party, and I settled in for a long night.</p><p>I noticed a familiar figure standing in the small circle as well; it was Draco Malfoy, my once school rival. I expected him to be among others than still around his father, but perhaps the night was still early yet—plus, Horace Slughorn was there. From Tom’s stories, I surmised he was ‘fishing’ again.</p><p>“Malfoy,” I greeted, more personally after the preliminary greetings were done.</p><p>He nodded back. “Potter.”</p><p>We had reached an…accord, a long time ago. Quidditch had been our main contention after the first two years, and come graduation when that was no longer on the table, we had little reason to mudsling each other. Besides, he had grown better with time—there was less, “My father will hear about this!” and more, “Well, let me prove you wrong with my dazzling genius.”</p><p>Sure, the marked improvement had been small, but it had been there.</p><p>Now, so long from our Hogwarts years, time had further mellowed the tension between us. We were not friends, but the option was not out of the question. It was the camaraderie built through sweat and blood on the Quidditch pitch—mutually assured destruction of our aching bones and muscles—or so I liked to believe.</p><p>Slughorn was eager to see his old student again, a prized member of his once entitled ‘Slug Club’. He greeted Tom with great, though suitable enthusiasm, shaking his hand and acting as good old friends reunited at last. I did not doubt there was some truth there—from what I knew, Tom was a gold star student with the NEWTs to show it.</p><p>“Dear Tom,” he exclaimed, wiping his forehead from sweat with a handkerchief, “It has really been far too long. Perhaps you should join this old man for tea soon, just like the old times?”</p><p>“Certainly,” Tom replied, perfect smile stapled in place. I resisted the urge to laugh. That smile I knew anywhere, and the brighter it was, the greater the contrast in his actual mood. “There is much to speak of, Horace.”</p><p>“Yes, yes,” nodded the old Potions professor. “I heard word of your new book, ‘Eyes of the Soul’? How exciting, truly! The study of soul magic has been sparsely scattered through time; why, I have not heard word of modern study of it until you began! And now, another book!”</p><p>“Oh, not quite yet,” Tom replied. “I still must review it; the article was but a small excerpt to gauge reactions.”</p><p>“Many of my associates voice an interest in it,” the Lord Malfoy offered. While cordiality held him back, I knew he was similarly close to Tom as Slughorn was. Abraxas Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy’s father, had gone to school with him—technically, Tom had known the current Lord Malfoy since he was but a baby. He was as good as his godfather…and Merlin was that awkward to think about.</p><p>“Aren’t we all, I say!” Slughorn was practically beaming. “The soul is not an archaic art; it is here and present and affects all of our lives! The only reason no one has studied it is the danger involved…it takes a particularly skilled wizard for it, yes. I always knew you were destined for great things, Tom.”</p><p>Well, at least he wasn’t two-faced with his flattery.</p><p>“Why, I remember as if it were just yesterday… You were but a young lad, excited and hungry to learn more of magic. You came to my office, yes, as you often did—the most immersive conversations I have ever had with a student—and you asked—why, you asked about—”</p><p>His eyes slid over to me, as if taking notice of the arm tucked into Tom’s for the first time.</p><p>“And might this be who I think it is?”</p><p>Now, I must admit, for a Slytherin Head of House, Slughorn was the farthest from subtle. Anyone with a half-operating pair of ears could hear his set up from half a ballroom away. But it was Tom’s business what Slughorn could be ‘used’ for—his words, not mine—and I was not interested enough to inquire. Politicking always drove me mad; I had no skill for it.</p><p>To my surprise, his next words did not proceed as I thought they would.</p><p>With a shocked, amazed expression, Slughorn murmured, “Those eyes…I would know those eyes anywhere! My word, Lily Evans! You are her son, are you not? Lily’s son! Blessed Lily!”</p><p>He knew my mother’s name. Thinking back, he was a professor during her time of attendance, but I had not connected the dots until now. I heard she was a brilliant student, a true Charms witch. I did not know personally—word of mouth from my old professors were all that I had. She was long dead, and the only thing I remembered of her was her soft fiery hair and the lullaby she used to sing.</p><p>“You knew my mother?” I blurted.</p><p>“Knew her!” Slughorn exclaimed, “Knew her? Why, Lily was one of my very brightest! No one could rival Tom, of course, but she was the brightest witch of her age, certainly! Oh, Lily—she was the sweetest thing, but step one foot out of line and she could be most fearsome! Her and Severus, yes, best of their year—Lily Evans! She had the potential to be a potions master, had there only been a bit more time…”</p><p>I was startled to see he looked genuinely regretful even indirectly mentioning her death. It was a look I had only ever seen on my professors. No one else had ever offered their condolences and meant it.</p><p>“Terribly sorry, my boy…but I didn’t quite catch your name?”</p><p>It was a little insulting to still be called ‘boy’ at my age; I was twenty-two, not eighteen! To a man of his age though, perhaps that was what I was to him. He was considered old when Tom went to school. I had no ground in that argument.</p><p>So I answered, “Harry James Potter,” hoping the mention of my middle name might fish some other esoteric details of my parents.</p><p>“Harry James, Harry James… A fine name! A nod to your father, yes? Following tradition, I see,” Slughorn said, enthusiastically shaking my hand. I went along with it. “Oh, and how rude of me! I haven’t even introduced myself! My name is Horace Slughorn, Tom’s old Potions professor.”</p><p>“Oh yes, he’s told me a lot about you.” It was not necessarily a lie. Slughorn’s name had popped up as much as any other associate of Tom’s—that they rarely entered our conversations, no one needed to know.</p><p>Slughorn beamed. “But of course! Tom was my favorite student. Not to say you weren’t a fine pupil yourself, Lucius—your dueling was just as good as your father’s!” And that truly was a compliment; Abraxas Malfoy was hailed the top duelist of his year, though Tom had revealed to me he had found victory enough times that it bored him. I did not doubt it; there was little reason to boast about beating a dead man.</p><p>Lucius took it for what it was. Unfortunately, the conversation was then redirected toward me.</p><p>“And I suspect…that you are…?” Slughorn sent a pointed look at our entwined arms.</p><p>“Indeed; we are soulmates,” Tom replied. I thanked him thrice in my mind; as interested as I was in Slughorn’s relation to my mother, I was equally rebuffed by any interest in <em>me</em>.</p><p>“So you’ve finally found him. I suppose congratulations are in order—though rather late, unfortunately.”</p><p>“My apologies, Horace; you hid yourself away far too well this time. None of my owls could reach you,” said Tom. Whether Slughorn could tell he was lying or not, I didn’t know, but I could suppose if Tom felt confident enough to say such a statement, he didn’t risk offending the man.</p><p>Slughorn chortled then, pleased at the backward compliment. “It’s of no issue; we really must have some tea sometime! And why not bring Harry with you? I would love to hear more about your meeting when there’s more time to chat…”</p><p>My and Tom’s presence were clearly not enough to make him stick around. Slughorn soon waddled off to greet some other old student of his, and we bid the Malfoys farewell as well to leave them to their rounds…and Tom’s, for a good deal of people sought to speak with him.</p><p>Perhaps anywhere from half an hour to an hour later—I could not recall exactly how long it’d been; it would have been considered rude to check the time as constantly as I would’ve liked—just as we were finishing up a conversation with the esteemed Antonin Dolohov—and I say that with some seriousness; apparently he was one of the best duelists of his generation, second only to Abraxas—I noticed out of the corner of my eye Draco, standing across the room.</p><p>Now, this would not have been notable if not for the fact that he too noticed and locked eyes with me. Then, in a quick gesture bred from years of Quidditch, he turned his head, made a slight motion with his hand, and then briefly locked eyes with me again before pivoting and walking out to the nearby balcony.</p><p>It needs to be understood that Quidditch, well, knows Quidditch.</p><p>Slytherin and Gryffindor spent years deciphering each other’s codes, seasons making up new ones in hopes of baffling their bosom enemies. Seekers especially had to learn quick on their feet; our observation did not only lend to the snitch. We were the eyes of our team, and if we were blind, our teammates might as well all be wearing eyepatches. It thus followed that when Draco Malfoy of all people made a distinctly Gryffindor hand signal, the first thing I thought was, “No wonder they were able to read our plays that season. They knew all along!”</p><p>I also wasn’t surprised, which helped maintain the poker face Tom and I had made a bet on—if it managed to survive the entire night, the victory would go to me. And I definitely intended the victory would go to me—there was no way I was going to give up on the current prize pool. That aside…</p><p>“I’m going outside to get some fresh air,” I told Tom. “It’s too stuffy in here; must be all the purebloods.”</p><p>If we were alone, Tom would’ve snorted. Unfortunately, we were in a public setting and snorting was ‘uncouth,’ so he inclined his head instead and I disentangled myself from his arm, seamlessly moving in the direction Malfoy went.</p><p>It seemed like only yesterday I was throwing him into stands with my Wronski Feints. Now he stood with his hands clasped behind his back, looking so much like Lucius that it was a bit unnerving.</p><p>Part of me felt inadequate, for I felt like I had not grown at all since school, but then I remembered where exactly Draco Malfoy had started out, and I didn’t feel so bad anymore. There really was no getting worse than baby first year Malfoy.</p><p>“I can hear your plebian insults all the way over here, you know.”</p><p>“Good,” I replied just as airily, “I’m sure you don’t get enough of those at home. Who else is going to control your giant ego?”</p><p>To my surprise, he smiled. “Astoria will run you out of a job, Potter.”</p><p>“Greengrass’ younger sister?” I asked. “Wow. Congratulations?”</p><p>He inclined his head, and that with the slight furrow of his brow told me all I needed to know.</p><p>“Congratulations,” I said, this time with all the solemnity befitting a funeral.</p><p>In a rare display of humanity, Malfoy shrugged. “We will learn to love, just as my mother did my father. She is certainly not the worst of the lot.”</p><p>“Not Pansy,” I remarked.</p><p>“Not Pansy,” he agreed.</p><p>With caution more befitting Tom than I, I asked, “Is that why you’re talking to me now?” I believed it a valid question. He hadn’t spoken more than a greeting to me the last time I came.</p><p>“As subtle as a train wreck. It’s an improvement, at least—seems your soulmate’s done you <em>some</em> good.”</p><p>I smiled and tried to make it as least lovesick as possible; in front of Malfoy at least I wanted to preserve some essence of nonchalance. He brought the pettiness back out of me—something about a Gryffindor and his inability to bow to a Slytherin. “We’re making it work.”</p><p>We were silent for a moment, simply overlooking the gardens below. Malfoy manor was indeed expansive. I tried to run through the maze garden with my eyes, failing when the angle cut off the pathways further out. There were white peacocks lazing about on the perimeter, so I followed those instead and pretended they were the most fascinating creatures in the world. Malfoy needed time. I could wait.</p><p>“We’re getting married in the spring,” he finally announced.</p><p>“Cool. Am I invited?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t want you at my wedding even if you begged, Potter.”</p><p>I grinned. “Smart. I’d probably ruin it for you.” False, of course; I had more respect for him than that. Still, what he didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him.</p><p>He waited another beat before saying, “I would’ve disagreed, back in Hogwarts.”</p><p>He caught me entirely off-guard, but I should’ve seen that coming from a mile away. Perhaps it was the way he said it—how he led into it first by mentioning his wedding, how he would be marrying a woman for blood and prestige and family…how alternatively, I had been lucky enough to meet my soulmate, and had been even luckier to pursue a relationship with him regardless of external circumstances.</p><p>It was either the worst or best setup I’d heard in my entire life, and I wanted to laugh because of course it would be.</p><p>“It wouldn’t have worked out,” we both said in unison. We weren’t even looking at each other, but seeker-to-seeker, childhood-enemy-to-childhood-enemy, our thoughts were one.</p><p>This time, I did laugh. He smiled, too—or so I thought; it might’ve just been my imagination.</p><p>“I always knew you’d end up with a Slytherin,” Malfoy said. “They’re your type.”</p><p>“What about Ginny? Cho?”</p><p>“Her Bat-Bogey Hex was foul as any. And do I even have to say it—Quidditch. For both of them.”</p><p>I considered making a joke about that. Instead, I said, “True. Guess I ended up with the Slytherin-est of them all,” and left it at that. We stood there for a while more in that lax silence, a completely different atmosphere than back indoors. I appreciated it, even if my comfort was not part of his consideration when he called me out.</p><p>“Harry,” Malfoy began. I turned to him and found his expression sobering. “I know sometimes you can act like a confused Slytherin, but there’s a reason you didn’t end up in our house.”</p><p>I swallowed. Part of me wanted to tell him that I’d asked the Sorting Hat for that, while the other half understood exactly what he’d meant.</p><p>“So that’s why…I’m telling you to be careful,” he said, licking his lips. “Word says that there’s something’s coming. Something big.”</p><p>“And I’m in the wrong circle?” I asked weakly.</p><p>There was no humor in his gaze. “If things explode, none of us are in the right circle. <em>Britain</em> isn’t in the right circle.”</p><p>“You can’t tell me what it is, can you?”</p><p>“Not even I know,” he replied. “And what I have points to nothing definite. Maybe Riddle would know more—I don’t know. It’s up to you to ask him, but you didn’t hear anything from me.”</p><p>I nodded. “Thank you,” I said, trying my hardest to sound as sincere as I felt.</p><p>Malfoy nodded back. “Be careful, Potter. I wouldn’t want to be scraping your corpse off of Diagon Alley’s cobblestones.” And then he left, without even giving me the chance to snark right back. I had the perfect line for it, too—something about how flattered I was that he cared enough to get his hands dirty. It was just as well; perhaps that would’ve been ill-timed considering the circumstances.</p><p>I knew he would protect his own. I was not one of those—his warning to me, completely unconditional and out of the goodness of his heart, maybe, was as generous as he’d get. That did not disturb me in any way whatsoever—Malfoy was Malfoy. I understood the gravity of this potential situation the second he used my first name.</p><p>In the end, as I stood there, I decided I wouldn’t ask Tom—not yet. There was no malicious intent behind that withholding of information; I simply did not feel it was the right time to mention. After all, why did Malfoy warn <em>me</em> instead of him? It was possible he knew me better, possible his father was already warning him, possible that the information came from Tom or possible that it applied to me more than him. I didn’t know. Whatever the case may be, I did not yet feel compelled to say anything.</p><p>So, I returned to the ball.</p><p>There might’ve been other interactions there that were just as significant to the war’s prelude as the one Draco and I shared, but I can’t recall any. That was the last of it, and nothing else Tom did foreshadowed his future actions to me.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Well, that’s it. I’d say I hoped that answered your question, but from the look on your faces, I see that it didn’t. But what else do you expect me to say? Tom is dead. Does it really matter what he was thinking before he died—whether he knew about the war’s arrival or not?</p><p>“Think about what you’re asking me. Think about it <em>carefully</em>. I was closest to him, yes; we lived together, ate meals with one another, thought about binding our lives together. I bear his mark on my hand, as he had mine on his, but it’s cold now. If he was this dark lord that you speak of, wouldn’t it still be warm?</p><p>“You want to know this dark lord’s intentions. You want to pick apart his brain and see if he’s a threat to you, a threat to Britain. I know. I can respect that. What I cannot respect is your desecration of my soulmate’s memory—you think you can just sit me down and say to me, ‘<em>We have reason to expect the late Mr. Tom Riddle is the Dark Lord Voldemort. As his soulmate, tell us everything you know about his thoughts on the war and his ensuing disappearance. Oh, and bonus points if you happen to know his top five weaknesses’</em>? You expect me to have the answer to that?</p><p>“I mourned him. You were not at his funeral. You did not have to see his empty grave, his cold tombstone—as cold as the assets report I was invited to Gringotts to read, as cold as his will, without voice, one line—‘<em>All to my soulmate, Mr. Harry James Potter’</em>. You saw none of that.</p><p>“And when his name was blazoned on <em>The Prophet</em>’s front page with a sham of a report by Rita Skeeter—<em>FAMOUS AUTHOR TOM RIDDLE: MURDERED?—</em>not three days after I had felt my mark chill for the first time in all my then twenty-five years, <em>you</em> were silent. <em>You</em> made no protest of that slanderous article, not even in the smallest pittance of compassion for your once student.</p><p>“Now, three years later, with Grindelwald knocking at our door and a mysterious dark lord risen from Great Britain’s very own womb, I sit here—<em>you</em> captured me and sat me here, then told me my soulmate is in fact not dead, and now you’re forcing me to dig up old ghosts in order to sate your own curiosity, never mind the fact that you’re basically telling me Tom never once thought or cared about letting me know he was alive and well, <em>if</em> in fact you’re right and not delusional, <em>which</em> I sincerely doubt.</p><p>“I don’t think I can name a more offensive turn of events if I tried.</p><p>“Look, I’m tired. Of living, of seeing your faces, of hearing Voldemort’s name in the same sentence as Tom’s. I answered your question under Veritaserum, and if you didn’t get the answer you wanted, then you might want to rethink your logic a little.</p><p>“And don’t even think about trying to verify through Legilimency again. It’ll be even uglier than the last time.”</p><p>Harry takes a deep breath. That had taken more out of him than he thought it would, but like hell he would let <em>them</em> see that.</p><p>“I assure you, Mr. Potter, we are well aware of Tom’s skill in the art of the mind,” says Dumbledore. In Harry’s memories, he recalled his once Headmaster as a jolly old man, spry for his age, with oddly colored robes and a terrible sweet tooth.</p><p>This Dumbledore is little like that man. He sits world-weary, a noticeable hunch in his shoulders, looking as if he has not slept for many days. The dark rings beneath his eyes looks like a new batch of bruises coming in, and even his glasses are slightly off-kilter. Whether he notices or not, he makes no move to fix them, and that final detail to his unkempt experience is like the nail in the proverbial coffin.</p><p>Harry cannot stay angry with him. He pities him, like he pities himself, and can just nearly taste the sympathy on the tip of his tongue, but the bindings around his hands and legs stop him from saying any words of comfort.</p><p>So instead, he turns to Severus Snape, his old Potions professor, who he had never quite liked and who had never quite liked him, either.</p><p>“Done with your interrogation now?” Harry asks.</p><p>Snape stays quiet for a moment. Predictably, Harry wants to punch him the second he starts to speak.</p><p>“If there is anyone in the world who would not trust their soulmate, it <em>would</em> be Riddle.”</p><p>Dumbledore strokes his beard. “Ah, yes, but I figured…at the very least… He seemed as if he had changed from his old ways. And that he had taken the time to shield young Mr. Potter’s mind—I had thought… Ah, but you may be onto something, Severus; it could all very well be a red herring.”</p><p>Harry wants to punch him, too.</p><p>“I’m right here,” he says. “Since you think my soulmate is the Dark Lord, you’re not worried that he might be watching through my eyes? Listening through my ears? Saving my memories for a later viewing time?”</p><p>They pause and look back over to him.</p><p>Grudgingly, Snape says, “He does have a point.”</p><p>Dumbledore, on the other hand, continues to observe him curiously. It’s unnerving how those eyes look now—they’re not the same friendliness that Harry had grown accustomed to at Hogwarts. No, this was war hero Dumbledore, he who had slain the previous dark lord—or had presumed to have slain, considering that said dark lord is currently rampaging through Europe again.</p><p>But then there’s another one besides Grindelwald, here in Britain, and his ulterior motives are a complete mystery.</p><p>…Harry doesn’t like thinking about it.</p><p>“No,” Dumbledore says, “I don’t think he is. You wouldn’t have said it if he was.”</p><p>“And if I didn’t know?”</p><p>Dumbledore straightens up. “We will not torture you, Mr. Potter. We do not intend to harm you.”</p><p>Some of that is true. The Veritaserum dose they had given him was carefully within safety measures and not a drop more, even when he had begun to go over the time limit. Bless small mercies. Sometimes the Gryffindor bluff pays off.</p><p>“And if I didn’t know?” Harry repeats. “If he has as much of a strong control over my mind as you think he does, how do I know anything? How can <em>I</em>, personally, know the distinction between fact or fiction?”</p><p>Dumbledore sighs. “I know what you are trying to do, Mr. Potter. I am quite clear on your opinion of your soulmate, that you believe he can do no wrong, and certainly not become a dark lord. However, we know for a fact that Tom <em>is</em>—”</p><p>Harry cuts him off. “I’m tired,” he says. “I don’t know anything.”</p><p>Snape is the one who sighs this time. “Leave the boy alone, Albus. This is the pointless. Maybe once the war comes to Britain and he can no longer hide behind his silly little delusions, he’ll tell us what we want to know.”</p><p>Harry would certainly do no such thing, but he stays quiet this time. They leave. Fifteen minutes later, someone comes to untie him from his chair and bring him back to his room. It’s a surprisingly nice room for a prisoner, but his wand is pointedly missing, and the careful selection of books and parchment he would’ve had little to no interest in touching just goes to show how barren it is.</p><p>No wand, no Hedwig, no broom, no friends. The door, he knows, is locked.</p><p>Harry falls back onto the bed and sighs. He places his hand over his forehead, the hard crystal of his mark rubbing against the skin there. It’s cold.</p><p>No Tom. No Tom ever again.</p><p>Harry rolls over. With a fact like that, there is no need to torture him. His dreams will do it for them.</p>
