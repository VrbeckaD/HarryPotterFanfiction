  <em>Well, it's been three days, so here's my next letter. Nothing much going on over here. Uncle Vernon whipped me raw again, and I haven't eaten in maybe four days, but I've had worse, so whatever, right?</em><br/>
  <em>I appreciate those brownies, Mrs Weasley, but I have no desire to eat food spiked with potions, so maybe just, I dunno, don't put them in next time?</em><br/>
  <em>That's all for now, I guess. Uncle Vernon wants me back in my cupboard.<br/></em>

    <em>It's unfortunate that we have to go against members of your family, but you've said it yourself, if they aren't open to reason, what can we do?</em><br/>
    <em>Have you been able to get anything done? I can't do much from my end, considering I'm back in my childhood bedroom. Horse, Hippo, and Whale have resumed their previous treatment, making it near impossible for me to do anything.</em><br/>
    <em>Azure Iris and Fuchsia Storm have both informed me that the Chicken guard has been removed. I guess Lemon Sucker doesn't feel I'm in any danger from Crimson Phantom this summer.<br/></em>

        <em>Back in the childhood bedroom, huh?-and the old treatment? Damn them! Do you need any potions or anything? I can always knick them. I just heard about the guard removal too. No one's saying why.<br/></em>
        <em>Amber Canis has been sent out to try and recruit the others like him by Lemon Sucker, which is probably why you haven't heard from him. Violet Mist is with Slate Lupus at his hideout.

                                      <em>If you accept your Lordship, you won't need a magical guardian any more, which means you will legally be able to leave your relatives' house, and </em>
