    <p>Hermione may have came from an upper class background and her parents were more than slightly well off however that didn’t stop her from associating with whomever she wanted to and that included Harry – Although not Harry was not a high class citizen who came from well to do family and could afford to go to a private school, Hermione’s parents had always allowed her to be friends with whoever she wanted. Class and social circles didn’t matter to her and so Harry was one of her very best friends.</p><p>Which now lead to her sitting in front on the Tom Marvolo Riddle having afternoon tea.</p><p>Hermione had done her research – born 31st December making him currently 27, raised in Wool’s Orphanage as his mother died in child birth, ostracised by others at the orphanage due to his intelligence, found out about his father and confronted him when he was 16, destroyed him and took over his business leading to where he was today in charge of all of London which was gradually branching out, thought to be undefeatable.</p><p>However Hermione did her homework, she always does her homework and nobody is undefeatable. His online security had been good but she’d been better and she was capable of destroying everything online, or worse, she could expose everything with one tiny press of a button.<br/>He would be ruined – she wanted him to know this.</p><p>Hermione sipped her tea delicately as she pushed forward some copies she had made of his bank accounts across the table for him to read. Nothing incriminating but obvious to him.</p><p>Hermione watched as he raised an eyebrow and spoke calmly, “And what do you want from me Ms Granger? Money, a position or something else entirely? What can I do to make this mutually beneficial?”</p><p>She sipped her tea again before she spoke, “Harry is very important to me. I would like to ensure that he is kept happy. As long as he is happy and you do nothing to harm him then I don’t see why anyone should need to see anything. However, as you can understand if my friend was to get caught up in something and get hurt then it would be my duty as a good law obeying member of the public to report anything I happen to come across in order to protect my friend.”<br/>Hermione had no qualms about destroying a major underground organisation if it came to it. Harry was her best friend who had always been there for her. She would be there for him if need be.</p><p>She observed as Tom seemed to sit silently in shock for a moment before nodding slightly, “Obviously my priority is ensuring Harry is happy. Anything else I can do for you Ms Granger?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head then drained the last of the tea from her cup, “Nothing else today Mr Riddle. For future note lets pretend this never occurred when Harry introduces us properly. And also, you simply must let me know where you get this tea from! It divine! I look forward to seeing you again soon.” Smiling at him, she placed her cup back down and stood up to leave. Smiling at him once more really just so she could admire the look of overwhelming shock on his face she turned quickly and showed herself out.</p><p>Tom had now been warned.</p>
