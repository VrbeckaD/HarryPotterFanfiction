          <div class="userstuff"><p>James Potter had had enough. He loved his friends, okay? He really did! So did Pete! But he could only handle so much and this was really--it was pushing it. He needed to say something. </p><p>"This is an intervention," he said, sounding smart. </p><p>Remus Lupin sighed slightly. He was currently sitting shoulder to shoulder with Sirius Black, looking very tired, and sort of ill-looking--but that wasn't out of the usual, and that definitely wasn't because of this. "Listen, James, it's really not necessary--"</p><p>"When I said bros before hoes this wasn't what I meant."</p><p>"But what if your bro is your hoe?" Sirius said, smirking. </p><p>Remus facepalmed. "...I really hate you."</p><p>"Look, mates, I really don't care if you two are gay or something--"</p><p>"I'm not gay!"</p><p>James paused. Remus paused too. They both stared at Sirius. That was a little doubtful, with all due respect, to be honest. The leather jacket, the long hair, the eyeliner? The overcompensation with flirting with girls? The real way he'd look at Remus when he thought his other friends weren't looking? </p><p>"I'm not gay," he continued. "I just have some gay tendencies."</p><p>"Gay tendencies--" Remus said. He really should've just stopped there. </p><p>"Like the tendency to rail Remus at four o'clock in the afternoon," James said slowly, crossing his arms and staring Sirius down. "Even though you knew my last class ended at three because--and I quote--it simply could not wait?"</p><p>Remus had the decency to look red in the face. </p><p>Sirius did not. "Mate, if Moony and I want to bone down then it's our business."</p><p>It wasn't when they all shared a living space, a sleeping space, but at the moment James felt like he was fighting a losing battle. He'd continue this another day. </p></div>
