    <p>When the final battle with Voldemort had begun, not a single soul could find their savior. Harry James Potter had vanished. The sudden reality that the war would end with the light dying came crashing down on everyone at Hogwarts.<br/>
<br/>When everyone had been captured or killed, the Dark Lord had stepped to the front and smirked at them. Nobody was paying attention to him though. Everyone was looking at the towering person that was standing next to the snake-like man.<br/>
<br/>The man had long raven hair that was tied back with a silk green ribbon and a broad build. His face was covered by a mask that was colored silver with edging of a dazzling emerald. He wore robes that were colored green with a silver lining. The man had broad shoulders and stood to be six foot five. He had a white silk formal shirt on under his robes with an ebony vest covering it. His pants were black and unwrinkled, and his shoes were a shiny inky color. The man stood there elegantly and regally as Voldemort leered at the so-called Light side.<br/>
<br/>Voldemort looked over to the mysterious man next to him and regarded him with a look of respect,” This here is Lord Peverell. Would you like to reveal yourself to everyone here?”<br/>
<br/>The man, Lord Peverell, chuckled and brushed a hand against the mask he was wearing,”Very well, Travers. Shall we see their reactions?”<br/>
<br/>Lord Peverell’s voice had immediately made everyone in the vicinity to shiver in fear and pleasure. His voice was a deep baritone that demanded obedience and nothing else, but it also had a slight seductive tone to it.<br/>
<br/>Lord Peverell slowly took off his mask and there were loud gasps and sobs that came from the surrounding crowd. Everyone was shocked to say the least because there stood their savior. There stood the man that was meant to save them all from the Dark Lord Voldemort. There stood Harry James Potter in all his glory.<br/>
<br/>“I knew you were dark,” Ron Weasley screamed as he attempted to run at Harry but got stopped by Dolohov. “You fucking Death Eater scum should go rot in hell!”<br/>
<br/>Harry raised a sculpted eyebrow at Ron before swiftly walking towards him. Harry grabbed Ron’s chin when he approached and forced the teen to look at him. “Ronald Weasley, do I look like a Death Eater to you? Do I have that mark on my skin? No, I didn’t think so. Use that brain for once, Weasel.”<br/>
<br/>“You’re the actual Dark Lord, aren’t you,” Hermione asked as she slowly stood from where she had previously been sitting next to Ron.<br/>
<br/>Harry smirked at her before schooling his features and looking at her,”You would be correct, Muggleborn. Maybe you aren’t stupid after all.”<br/>
<br/>“My Lord,” Lucius Malfoy said with a small bow,”there is an issue with young Lord Riddle.”<br/>
<br/>Harry walked towards Lucius and placed a hand on his shoulder,”Take them all to the dungeons at Slytherin manor.”<br/>
<br/>Lucius gave a stiff nod quickly before going to gather the light side. Everyone was surprised that Harry had just left like that. He wasn’t even there for the full battle! He had just arrived! Before anyone could realize it, Harry was gone and back at his manor.</p>
