<p> </p>
<p>                The night was deep, dark, and quiet. The stars silently shone, free from clouds and obstruction. They seemed especially bright this night, and Kreature grunted as he lowered the telescope from his eyes. Though it defied muggle logics, the Star named “Sirius” stood out starkly from directly above Grimmauld place. Kreature muttered to himself as he lumped back over to the door to the roof. Quickly as the old and misshapen elf could, he re-entered the house and made his way down the stairs to the main floor. Once there he went down the hallway and to the master bedroom. Once inside the bedroom, he hopped up on the king-sized bed. He peered down at the young woman sleeping in the bed for just a moment before reaching out and poking her with one long, gnarled finger.</p>
<p>                “Mistress be getting up!” He commanded. Ri rolled onto her back and blearily peered up at Kreature standing over her.</p>
<p>                “Kreature? What time is it?” She asked, wondering what was going on.</p>
<p>                “Mistress be getting up! It being time!” Kreature repeated impatiently, poking her in the shoulder again. With a grunt of irritation, Ri sat up and scrubbed her hands over her face.</p>
<p>                “I’m up, I’m up.” She grumbled while swinging her legs over the side. “What’s the matter, Kreature?” She asked again.</p>
<p>                “It being time. Sirius is waiting for mistress.” Kreature informed her, hopping off the bed and exiting the room. Frowning, Sirina “Ri” Potter-Black followed her servant.</p>
<p>                “Kreature, Sirius has been dead for years. We even had a funeral after the war, remember?” She prodded gently, wondering if Kreature had finally lost the last of his sanity. Kreature grumbled under his breath in irritation.</p>
<p>                “Not Sirius, Mistress. <em>Sirius!</em>” As though the words aught to make sense to her. Then he began to grumble rudely about her upbringing under his breath while leading Ri towards the kitchen. Mystified, Ri nevertheless followed Kreature all the way into the room, and then to the wall of cupboards. Kreature gently stroked one finger down a seam between two cupboards, and with a groaning sound the wall revolved until it was perpendicular to where it sat before. Kreature snapped and a small fireball floated over his palm as he walked into the darkness beyond the wall opening. No light from outside penetrated, nor did Kreature’s light seem to illuminate anything. Not certain Kreature wasn’t leading her into a trap, Ri straightened her back and followed behind Kreature bravely. Obviously he was determined to show her something, and Ri was curious despite herself. Once she was in the darkness, she still couldn’t see anything except for darkness and Kreature’s ball of light.</p>
<p>                Strange whispers surrounded her, reminiscent of those coming from the veil in the department of mysteries. These whisperers, however, seemed to be judging her. She couldn’t have said how she knew they were judging her, as she couldn’t hear any actual words. Something about the tone of the whispers seemed to imply judgement, though. The journey seemed to take forever, her sense of time ceased functioning entirely. Finally, as Ri followed Kreature into a large, cavernous room, Kreature’s light illuminated the room. Gray walls and flooring surrounded them. Kreature flicked his hand toward the highest point, which was at the center of the domed cavern, and the light flew from his hand to hover there. Imperiously Kreature pointed towards the center of the floor with one hand, and placed the other over his lips in a shushing motion. Ri moved to the center of the room, and sat at Kreature’s direction. It was only her trust in the bond between elf and master, which prevented Elves from harming their master, which kept her sitting as Kreature starting painting a circle and symbols around her in blood.</p>
<p>                As Kreature closed the circle, all the whispers went silent. The hair on the back of Ri’s neck stood on end. The room seemed to grow a little chilly, and then a glowing light seemed to descend through the ceiling where Kreature’s light lit the room. A feeling of awe overtook The huge glowing ball of light drifted down until it floated just before the circle. The light seemed to shudder for a moment, and then it grew four legs, a tail, and a head with floppy ears. A long, blue tongue of flame lolled out of the muzzle, and a fire dog floated in front of her.</p>
<p>                <strong>“Who appears before us?”</strong> a booming voice asked. Ri wanted to look to Kreature to see if she should answer, but she could not look away from the magnificent creature glowing before her in golden light.</p>
<p>                “Sirina Lillian Potter-Black, named after Sirius, the Dog Star, of the Black Family.” Kreature intoned solemnly. The “Dog” tilted its head and looked into Ri’s eyes. A shiver of magic traced over her.  </p>
<p>                <strong>“Sirina Lillian Potter-Black. You have been brought before your guiding Star, to be judged whether you are worthy of becoming a full and adult member of the Black family. Before you can be judged worthy: You must learn the truth of the Black Family, and also what is required of every family member.”</strong> The “dog” intoned. Ri continued to stare up at the Star, enthralled by its mere presence.</p>
<p>                <strong>“The <em>Black Family</em> is an ancient family, mainly descended from three sources. First, from the Stars. In a time before most humans recollection, a Star once fell in love with a human woman. That Star had a child with that woman, and ever since then members of the Black family have been granted a guardian from among their Starly kin’s number. To signify this guardian, the child’s first given name is granted unto them by that Star and impressed upon their parent’s or guardian’s mind. Hence, you were named “Sirina” after Sirius the Dog Star.” </strong>The Star informed her gravely.</p>
<p>                “So, you’re my guiding Star?” Ri asked, voice trembling slightly. Not in fear, but from the sheer presence of the Star. The “dog” Star’s tail wagged.</p>
<p>                <strong>“Yes. Since the day you were born, I have watched over you always. Though you could not yet hear me, I have still done my best.”</strong> The Star agreed.</p>
<p><strong>“Almost a millennia later one of your ancestors married into the Dark Fae King. The Fae, not being particularly inclined to watch over every single part-human child descended from them, were content with allowing the Stars to keep care of their co-descendants, and for the most part have little to do with our Family. The third source being the original Human ancestor. All three of your heritages grant you special gifts and abilities, but it is the Star and Fae heritages which affect the ability to be <em>Always Pure</em>. Though it is little known to most humans, many magical beings like the Fae have designated soulmates. For example, your father James of the Potter family and your god and Star father Sirius of the Black Family, were platonic soulmates. Your father James, despite not being granted a Guardian Star, since his Father denied him the Black Family Magic, had two soulmates. He was still descended from the Black Family, after all, even if he was never a full part of it. He was a platonic soulmate to one, and he married the other.” </strong> Sirius instructed, before pausing and somehow upping the intensity of his next words.</p>
<p><strong>“This you must remember, Sirina Lillian Potter-Black. Because you are descended from Dark Fae, there is a curse on your line. You cannot sleep with, nor marry one who is not your soulmate. If you and your soulmates decide to be platonic, you must not marry. For those of the Black line who sleep with and/or marry one who is not their soulmate, they go insane. For example, your distant cousin Bellatrix. Her father ignored the guidance of his Star and contracted his daughter to one who was not her soulmate. Sadly, she went mad as a result.”</strong> The Star lectured. Another chill, this time of fright, raced down Sirina’s back.</p>
<p><strong>“But there is hope. You are not left to find your soulmate alone. For this purpose has a servant of your Family brought you before me, to perform the Black Family <em>Coming of Age</em> Ritual. This Ritual will help me illuminate your link to your soulmate or soulmates. Using my power, the dormant bond will pull you towards your mate or mates. If you swear to find, stay true to, and do your best to treat your soulmate(s) right, you will be acknowledged as a full adult member of the Black Family. And also be acknowledged as the rightful head of the Family. I will also then be able to speak to you directly and teach you all you need to know about your gifts and the family as you sleep.” </strong>He softly encouraged.</p>
<p>“I swear to find my soulmate or soulmates. I swear to stay true to them, and to treat them the best that I can, so long as they do the same in return. For it is not in my nature to put up with being treated poorly.” Sirina swore to her Star. A barking laugh, much like that of her Godfather, echoed from the Star before her.</p>
<p><strong>“That is well. For the second oath of the Family is to bow to no one except the head of the Black Family. A Black is a leader, not a servant. For you are descendants of Royalty and Immortal beings of immense power. Not even other Royalty, nor immortal beings will you bow to.” </strong> Sirius agreed.</p>
<p>“Though I may choose to listen to the council of those I trust, such as yourself, I will not Bow to anyone else.” Sirina swore easily.</p>
<p><strong>“Then be welcome among the rest of the adults in the family, Sirina Lillian Potter-Black, daughter of Sirius of the Black Family, James Potter of Black descent, and Lillian of the Evans line. You are hereby acknowledged as the new <em>Head</em> of the Black Family. All other Blacks must bow to you and only you. For if they do not bow to you, they are cast out. All gifts taken away and bonds snapped.”</strong> The Star pronounced before stretching with his butt up in the air. When Sirius stood normally (for a dog) once more, he barked thrice and blue light flowed from the sound until it began lighting up the runes and circle around Sirina. It got so bright Ri had to not only close her eyes, but also cover them with her hands. When the light seeping in around the edges of her hands faded enough, she lowered her hands.</p>
<p>Sirina opened her mouth to ask a question, but a glowing orange and blue swirled flexible rod coming out of her chest caught and held her attention. A pulling sensation took over her mind, consuming her thoughts. Without a word, Ri stood and moved to follow the sensation. Laughing his barking laughter once more, the Star caught Ri around her middle and bounded away through the top of the cavern. Ri had just a moment to brace herself before she thought she’d hit the ceiling, and then they both passed right through it. She looked down at herself to see she was glowing like the Dog Star, and somewhat see-through. Like the Star, most of her body was made up of a glowing amber fire. Here and there were darts of indigo and purple mixed in.</p>
<p><em>“Fire?”</em> She wondered to herself, and then she heard the Dog’s words in her head.</p>
<p><strong><em>“Flames.”</em> </strong>He corrected mildly. <strong><em>“They are known as Flames. In particular, your flames are generally believed to be of the Flames of the Sky category, as opposed to Flames of the Earth, or Flames of the Water. There are seven flames in the Sky set, including: Sky, Rain, Mist, Cloud, Storm, Sun, and Lightning. Your flames appear to be a Primary flame of Sky, and two secondary flames of Cloud and Mist. Each Flame has its special properties, but I will teach you more about most of it when you sleep. For now, what you really need to know is that Sky flames harmonize, or bond, with other flame types. It is a soul bond, so be careful not to bond with one who is not your soulmate, as Wizards and Fae consider a soul bond a marriage. This means you are likely to have more than one soulmate, as a powerful Sky truly needs a full set of elements to be complete. And you are powerful.”</em></strong> The Dog added.  </p>
<p><em>“Complete?”</em> Ri wondered in her thoughts, and the Dog again answered in her mind.</p>
<p><strong><em>“Yes. Consider a full set of elements, or ‘Guardians’ as some call them, like filing in the other half of your soul. A weak Sky can get by with one, maybe two guardians. But the more power you have, the more guardians you need. And, as I said, you are very strong. The job of an element is two-fold. The first is to physically protect the Sky, just as the Sky’s job is to try to keep their elements safe. The second, and slightly more important job, is to drain off the excess power and Flames. Most mortals have forgotten, because they have become weaker as the ages pass and </em>THAT PARASITE<em> prays on them. Still, even a weak Sky can burn themselves up by having more flames than their body can safely contain. Breeding plays a certain role in how much flames you can safely house in your body on a daily basis, as well as upbringing.”</em> </strong>Sirius answered as they flew above the countryside. Ri marveled for a moment at how fast they were flying, and then wondered if people below were seeing shooting Stars and making wishes.</p>
<p><em>“Why haven’t I burned up yet, then? I’ve seen my Flames before, back when I burned Quirrell, and also on nights when I was locked out of the house and it was cold.”</em> Ri mused. Above her, Dog growled angrily.</p>
<p><strong>“That is because of the Darker side of Flames, and humanity. There are two opposing forces, known as Sky Attraction and Sky Envy respectively. Sky Attraction is a biological sort of charisma that attracts other flame users to you. This can be dangerous, because if you don’t have bonded elements to defend you, flames users of all types will attempt to bond themselves to you. Sometimes, in powerful Skies, it can create what is known as a Frenzy. Much like a feeding Frenzy among sharks. As they fight over the Sky in question, they steal little bits of your flame. Those bits of flame then break off. It provides little relief, and the over-abundance of Flames can still drive a Sky mad, but creates no bond unless the Sky wills it. The second, Sky Envy, is even more dangerous. Sometimes, a Sky will meet another Sky more powerful than themselves. If they are not…well. If they have problems such as insanity, they are power hungry, or for a multitude of darker reasons, they will attempt to take out  the competition. In your case, Dumbledore found out you are a more powerful Sky than he could ever hope to be. So he used a ritual when you were very young to siphon off your flames and add them to his own reserve. He also kept you isolated and planned your death, hoping no one else would even realize you are a Sky.” </strong>He continued in a snarl.</p>
<p><em>“Oh. So I’m in danger of implosion now that I’m free from his Siphon, and around less people?”</em> She paraphrased back to Sirius, making sure she understood.</p>
<p><strong><em>“Yes. But for now, just concentrate on finding your soulmate. We will figure something out if your soulmate is not willing to be one of your elements and spouse, or if you only have one soulmate. If nothing else, we could contribute your flames to those who need it. I happen to know you have a very distant sky cousin who was sealed as a child, and so is dying from a lack of flames. A Potter cousin, so not one granted their own Star Guardian.”</em></strong> Dog soothed, and Ri relaxed slightly in relief. Then  she realized they were crossing the English Channel, and then Dog landed on a beach of what Ri could only assume was France. <strong><em>“Go, little one. I will watch over you as you journey.”</em> </strong>Sirius urged, releasing Ri to stand on her own and prodding her forward with his nose.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sirius.” She murmured quietly. “You be safe too, okay?” She demanded softly. The Dog barked a laugh and jumped back into the Sky. “Be safe, Sirius.” She repeated again. Then she turned and began to trudge up the beach. Once more the bar of light, which she assumed was her incomplete bond to a soulmate, consumed her attention and all she thought of was its pull. Paying only enough attention to skirt around people, cars, and buildings, Sirina Lillian Potter-Black began her quest.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To Sirina’s increasing frustration, following the pull of the bond wasn’t as simple as she thought. For one thing, the pull, feelings, and direction of the bond constantly changed! She’d take a break for a half hour rest sometimes, then wake up and find the bond going in the opposite direction and the person on the other end feelings ten times as far away! Finally, she gave up. All of the buildings, cars, people, and the sheer size of the gap between her and her soulmate took to long to traverse. So she used the Point Me spell to locate the nearest magical shopping district, where she got many strange looks for being in muggle pajamas, and purchased herself a new broom. Once back outside the broom shop, Ri disillusioned both herself and the broom before she took to the air.</p>
<p>In the air, the wind ruffled Ri’s hair and made her feel at home once more. Idly she wondered if having Sky flames was one reason she was such a good flyer. Wondered if it was the reason she felt more at home in the air than on the ground or in the water. Then the bond consumed her once more, and she closed her eyes. To her surprise, she found she got more information from the bond with her eyes closed. Quickly she cast a shield charm around herself, as well as a large area charm that would warn of oncoming planes or air traffic. Then she gave herself over to the pull and flew in the direction it indicated. She didn’t stop for rest, and switched her direction immediately at the urging of the bond. It took her a few days, and Ri honestly believed her Star was giving her the unflagging energy of the Dog Star so she didn’t collapse from exhaustion. On the third day since she started flying, Ri felt the prickle of magic over her skin that indicated she’d just passed through a ward of some kind. The bond sort of zinged inside her, and Ri could tell she was very close to her soulmate.</p>
<p>Finally, she allowed her eyes to open. Down below her, near some sort of obstacle course on the edge of an island, she could see a large group of small people. When she got close, Ri cancelled her spells. Then, when she was near enough the ground, Ri stuck the self-shrinking broom into her pocket and fell the last few feet to the ground. A white carnivorous bird of some sort and a monkey both screeched a warning, startling Ri and also the group of people before her. The people before her looked like children, but Ri could feel through her bond that at least the soulmate she currently sought was older than she was.</p>
<p>“Hello, I’ve been looking for you.” Ri stated calmly, while looking into startled and wary blue eyes.</p>
