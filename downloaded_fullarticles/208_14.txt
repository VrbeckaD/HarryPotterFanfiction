    <p>Pain, that has been all Hari has felt for five years; physical, mental, spiritual. The Dementors bring out two of those; the third was caused by humans. <br/>For five years Hari had been tortured; whipped throughout the day and one nail ripped off a day as well. Throughout the night the Dementors came five or more always stood outside her cell and then at dawn were chased away for her to be tortured more.<br/>Chains on her wrists and ankles making her hang in the middle of the room, Hari looked down the day was over and the tortures had left and the Dementors were coming. Those tortures were the worst they enjoyed what they did and they did far more than whipping.<br/>They would beat her till her skin was covered in bruises, they would laugh whenever she screamed, and they enjoyed whipping her more sensitive areas. They had whipped her breasts, stomach, feet and arms in the past but today they had whipped right over her left eye.<br/>Hari left eye was now nothing more than a disgusting mess, it had dried out so it no longer leaked fluids but still horrible pain came from it, she had cried earlier but that had only made it hurt worse.  <br/>The Dementors were now all around her cell pulling up her worst memories, the Dursleys constant torment, Cedric’s death, Sirius’s death, her friends betraying her. All those memories played over and over in her head combined with all the pain she had suffered in Azkaban.<br/>Then all of a sudden they stopped.<br/>Hari looked up but only having one eye and not having glasses made it so she couldn’t see what was going on, or why the Dementors were leaving.<br/>“Expecto Patronum!”<br/>She recognized the voice but she was in too much pain to think on whom it belonged to, but it definitely was a male voice.<br/>“Expecto Patronum!”<br/>A different voice a woman’s voice! Who was helping her, Hari though everyone had betrayed her. The door opened and she herd four people gasped, one of the people ran up to her.<br/>“Oh Hari what have they done to you.” The woman asked lightly, at that moment it clicked.<br/>“L-Luna?” Hari croaked out her voice so horse and soft Luna barely heard it.<br/>“Yes Hari I am hear.” Luna said to Hari, before harry could form any coherent words a potion was put to her lips and she drank no longer caring what it might be. She instantly felt better her hunger and thirst was gone, and her injuries were no longer bleeding.<br/>“That, should have healed to wounds.” The male said.<br/>Now that Hari was more coherent she recognized the voice. Still barley above a whisper Hari croaked out,<br/>“Draco, w-what are you doing here?”<br/>“Me, Luna, Neville, and George came to break you out.” Came Draco’s quick reply.<br/>“B-But what- “The Malfoy family owes you a dept so I came to help you in every way I can. Draco replied while searching threw his bag.<br/>“Draco you won’t be able to fix those scars, these whips are enchanted making it so every scar won’t fade.” Neville said angrily from the corner of the room Hari new the torture devises were kept.<br/>The shackles unlocked and Hari started to free fall till Draco and Gorge cot her. They slowly eased her onto a blanked on the floor. Luna walked up to her and used magic to clean her of all the grime that had accumulated on her body over the years, she then slipped underwear and a shirt onto Hari.<br/>“Hari, we know we can’t hide you so me and Draco looked and found a spell that will send you to another world of sorts, but we won’t be able to come with you it, it requires four sacrifices.” Neville said sadly sitting on his knee right in front of her.<br/>“N-no don’t do this, you all have lives just live them, without me.” Hari’s shoulders were shaking she was crying, it still hurt her eye a little but not to an extent of actual pain just discomfort.<br/>“Hari you greatly improved all our lives and have saved us all at least once we all need to repay that dept.” Draco said.<br/>“I have already set the runes Hari; we are all sorry for not saving you sooner.” Gorge says sounding like he was close to tears.<br/>“Bye Hari,” Luna said kissing her forehead she then stood back. Hari herd the sound of four bodies dropping as well as knives hitting the floor. Before Hari had a chance to produce a single tear she was whisked away.<br/>////////////////////   <br/>Hari slowly comes out of the most restful sleep she could remember having, she sat up still tired; because it will take a lot more than one restful sleep to recover, she thought and then yawned, steam erupts from her mouth, it is warn on her face causing her to sigh witch just created more steam.<br/>After spending a little time to just relax in the warmth she slowly rose to her feet. She looked down at herself, she was still covered in the scars she suffered in Azkaban and she also lacked clothes, as quickly as she could while still stumbling a lot she gets into a forest of short trees.<br/>Hari looked around for quite some time unable to find something suitable to cover herself with. She was just about ready to rip branches of the trees to cover herself she heard it; someone was walking in her direction. <br/>She quickly hid behind the largest tree she could find, and just in time to, a short man came out from behind another tree his body was disproportionate; his arms and legs were thin and short, and his body was extremely fat his head had to large eyes that almost popped out of his head.<br/>He was also naked, Hari quickly turned away, but before she had turned all the way around she had seen his crotch, and lack of gentles.<br/>She slowly walked out from behind the tree. He, no it didn’t seem to notice anything different. Hari walked up to it, still no reaction, she waved her hand in front of its face, nothing.<br/>“What, The, Hell- Hari cut herself off her voice was deep and gravely she could barely understand herself she felt around herself trying to find out why.<br/>She gasped; and more steam came out of her mouth.<br/>She had no genitals, and her body was extremely hot.  She tentatively touched the thing in front of her; its skin was burning hot too. They were the same species.<br/>Hari quickly felt around herself she wasn’t misshapen which was a good thing she was still female; if these things actually had genders that is, she looked like a female at least in human standards.<br/>The thing suddenly changed directions and ran with a new found vigor; Hari went to follow it when she heard a sickening crunch under her foot. Hari slowly lifted her foot and found a squashed something under it. Upon closer inspection she saw that it was a deer, a tinny tiny deer.<br/>Wait.<br/>The trees were short the grass looked like it barley came out of the ground the animals weren’t tiny she was a giant, a huge genderless giant.<br/>Hari remembered the other giant and ran after it; wherever it was going it seemed important to it, she should see what it was, she thought. <br/>As she ran she ran from her old life and into a new much stranger life.<br/>Hari ran after the short giant trying to figure out what had excited it. Hari cot up to it the second a flash of silver and green sliced through the back of its neck; with only one eye she couldn’t make out what had done it, she watched it as it fell forwards and before it even hit the ground it was dead.<br/>She stood in the middle of a small clearing in the woods frozen, she just stared dumbly at the half way disintegrated corpse. Everything was quite for a moment then she heard an excited scream and felt something stick into her shoulder blade.<br/>Hari reacted quickly, she grabbed the string that had stabbed her shoulder and ripped it out, then her hand was cut in half by twin blades. The same thing stuck into her leg and she grabbed it and this time through it at a tree.<br/>“Hanji!” something yelled from down below she looked and saw lots of saddled horses and people riding then all wearing green cloaks. <br/>Another thing stuck into the back of her neck, this time and she went berserk. Hari flung her damaged hand in front of the extremely fast green blur so it cut into her already ruined hand. She then grabbed the string and through it only for another string to come from the same thing she just through of herself.<br/>The fight went on for several minutes the man that moved like lightning and the titan covered in scars. Sometimes other people would try to help him but they were either injured or killed by the titan that could move faster than humanity’s strongest.<br/>After three minutes of solid fighting Hari new she had to get away she could only hold off the blades for so long, so she ran, she stepped on a cart and a few horses while getting away but she got out mostly unscathed. <br/>Hari looked down at her hand which she knew was now ruined because of her using it as a shield, but when she looked at it, it was all repaired except for the scars. <br/>Timidly Hari grabbed a branch (small tree) and lightly cut into her skin, it healed almost immediately.<br/>Why, why can I now heal any wound in an instant except these scars, she thought getting angrier and angrier with the dammed wizarding world.<br/>So Hari released all those emotions she had been hiding for five year; all the pain, all the anger, and all the sadness, she released all of those emotions into an ear spitting roar. The sound made birds fly, animals run and every human who heard shiver.  <br/>//////////Scouts//////////<br/>Levi flew over to Hanji, she seemed alright, but Levi new that she her back was going to be black and blue from how hard she had been slammed into that tree, it was a miracle that her back wasn’t broken.<br/>“Can you stand?” Levi asked holding his hand out for Hanji to take.<br/>Hanji shot up and gripped his shoulders.<br/>“Levi did you see her, she was covered in scars! I didn’t know that was possible, poor baby I probably scared her screaming and jumping at her like that. She probably couldn’t see me that well since her left eye was all messed up, oh Levi who would do something that cruel to that poor baby, she looked like she was covered in whipping scars!” Hanji said her voice going through so many emotions Levi had a hard time keeping up.<br/>“Please let go” Levi said calmly.<br/>Hanji let go of his shoulder than hissed grabbing her side and falling to her knees. Levi caught her before she could fall on her face.<br/>“I guess you can’t stand.” Levi said, he picked her up and carried her to one of the carts that wasn’t destroyed.<br/>“We are turning back, we took to large of a blow hear.” Erwin said riding his horse to Levi.<br/>Levi made a grunt of acknowledgement. Erwin got off his horse and help Levi get Hanji in the cart. After they got her into the cart Erwin asked Levi and a few others to see if anything from the destroyed cart was salvageable.<br/>With ten of their horses killed, and a third of their comrades dead as well they started making their way home, that was when they heard it an earth shaking roar, coming from the east, all the scouts including Levi shuttered. They hurried north back to the wall back to their cage.<br/>//////////Hari//////////<br/>Hari had decided to follow the people and see where they lived so she could avoid them, she felt bad now that she realized that those things with blades were people and she had killed them. <br/>Even though the healing powers had made it so she didn’t need glasses, she had lost her left eye which was also her dominant eye, making it harder to see fast movement, and also needing to put her hand in a different spot than she saw. (Kind of like going cross eyed stuff isn’t were it seems to be)<br/>She followed them to the edge of the forest, she saw them enter a massive wall many times her height, she just stared dumbly at it, it was huge, she continued to stare till the sun started going down, after it became dark she felt very tired and decided to just go to sleep.<br/>Her life was stranger than ever.<br/>//////////scouts//////////<br/>They had made it back without too many titans attacking, which everyone was grateful for.<br/>They entered the walls solemnly, Levi hated it that people always stared at them whenever they came back.<br/>During the time Hanji and the others that were injured were recovering, Levi, Erwin, and Hanji; when she was feeling better, talked about the newly dubbed Scared Titan, or Nike as Hanji liked to call it, something about speed and ancient history.<br/>All Levi really thought about when regarding the titan was that it was that he and the titan were on equal footing when fighting, it was not only his speed that kept him alive while fighting the titan, it was his experience and ability to change what he was doing on the dot that kept him alive.<br/>Its vision wasn’t the best, though that was a given seeing as it only had one functioning eye, and that statement brought up so many more questions that it gave Levi a headache, how could a titan have injures that couldn’t heal, why did the titan have injures like that, like whipping marks.<br/>Levi brought a picture to his mind of exact what the titan looked like, it stood at 13 meters, it was thin, pale, it had waist length black hair with so many knots in it that it angered him, it had scars all over its back, chest, stomach, legs, and feet, the gross mess that was its left eye, and it’s one undamaged eye, not lifeless like all the other titans he had seen, no its eye was a sharp green full of intelligence.<br/>That intelligence scared Levi the most, that titan wasn’t a dumb monster, it was an intelligent creature that could think, that could learn.</p>
