        <em>Being in love was an overwhelming feeling.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Giving yourself up to someone so completely, trusting them fully - it was no easy feat.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They were no different.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If anything, they were the epitome of every intense feeling one could experience while being in love.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Excitement, anger, elation, frustration, contentment, confusion, lust, desire - the list was endless.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Theirs was an interesting love, a complicated love.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A consuming love.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A love born out of passion, control, dominance, acceptance, understanding, and most importantly, forgiveness.</em>
      </p>
      <p>"Do you love me?"</p>
      <p>"More than anything." he whispered, his lips ghosting over hers as he slowly moved over her.</p>
      <p>Her hands traveled over his back and into his hair, their movements completely in sync.</p>
      <p>"Promise?"</p>
      <p>He nodded, his lips trailing over her neck, her breasts, her cheeks, her lips - showing her how much he loved her.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Being in love was complicated.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It made you do crazy things. It made you say crazy things. It made you think crazy things.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It made you crazy, sometimes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It made you irrational and upset and jealous - it made you care.</em>
      </p>
      <p>"Don't ever leave me." she whispered, her arms tight around around his shoulders while her legs were around his hips.</p>
      <p>He groaned, "Never."</p>
      <p>His hands tangling themselves in her hair as he captured her lips in a kiss, his tongue dancing along hers.</p>
      <p>"You did before." she said, her voice catching as he moved over her - in her - just perfectly.</p>
      <p>
        <em>You make mistakes. You screw up. You hurt the person you love, and the only thing you can do is hope that they're able to forgive you.</em>
      </p>
      <p>"Never again." he promised, his lips claiming hers yet again, his gentle rocking slowly pushing them closer and closer to oblivion.</p>
      <p>
        <em>That was another thing. Turning yourself over completely - feeling it all and making them feel it too.</em>
      </p>
      <p>"Look at me."</p>
      <p>Her eyes fluttered open, toffee meeting silver, and it was as if they were the only two people in the world.</p>
      <p>
        <em>When you're in love you learn to take the good with the bad.</em>
      </p>
      <p>He trailed his lips over the scar on her arm, long since healed.</p>
      <p>Her fingers flitted over the faded mark on his forearm, a reminder of a dark past.</p>
      <p>"I will never hurt you again."</p>
      <p>She closed her eyes, a silent tear escaping, before she looked back up at him.</p>
      <p>"I know. I trust you."</p>
      <p>
        <em>Being in love is scary. You're trusting someone not to hurt you, even if they have before.</em>
      </p>
      <p>"God I love you." he groaned, his head against her neck.</p>
      <p>He was close.</p>
      <p>That was okay, she was too.</p>
      <p>"I love you too." she said softly, no doubt that she did, no doubt that she wanted him to know.</p>
      <p>He slid a hand between them to where they were connected, and urged her to fall into oblivion with him.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Sometimes love is like jumping off a cliff into the wide open ocean - scary, exhilarating, eye opening, amazing.</em>
      </p>
      <p>They tensed at the same time, clutching each other in a tight embrace as white stars exploded behind their eyelids.</p>
      <p>He moved up onto his forearms, placing soft kisses to her chest, her shoulders, her neck, her lips.</p>
      <p>"Draco,"</p>
      <p>He pulled up and looked at her, his eyes flitting over her features as if he wanted to commit every last detail to memory.</p>
      <p>"Why did you leave?"</p>
      <p>
        <em>Sometimes when you're in love you have to answer the hard questions.</em>
      </p>
      <p>"Because I was stupid. Because I didn't realize what I had. I didn't realize that I loved you." he said, his voice holding none of its usual arrogance.</p>
      <p>"What changed?"</p>
      <p>"I did."</p>
      <p>She let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding and smiled, "And you love me?"</p>
      <p>He smiled too, leaning down until his lips were only a breath away from hers before he said, "More. Than. Anything."</p>
      <p>
        <em>When you're in love you learn that sometimes you've just got to let go, give in, and go with it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Because love is quite a few things - but at the end of the day, it's the only thing that gives us the drive to get up and do it all over again tomorrow.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Love is...well...just ask Hermione and Draco.</em>
