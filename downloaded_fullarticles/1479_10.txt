    <p><b><em>        DEAD. VOLDEMORT WAS DEAD. </em></b>The Death Eaters who weren't killed during the battle vanished to God-knows-where and Avalon could not wrap her head around the fact that no one did anything to stop them, to go after them.</p><p>    Her fingers were still curled tightly around her wand, her knuckles white and bloodstained, and when someone placed their hand on her shoulder, she did not waver before whirling around and pointing her wand at them.</p><p>    Realizing it was just Ginny, Avalon lowered her wand, tucking it into the waistband of her torn-up jeans.</p><p>    Ginny hesitated for a moment, throwing Avalon a sad glance she promptly ignored. 'He's dead, Avalon. It's over... You can stop fighting.'</p><p>    Avalon's stare was hard, the one of a warrior who no longer knew how to stop swinging their sword. 'It's not over yet. Some of <em>them</em> got away.'</p><p>    'You-know-who is dead-'</p><p>    'So?' Avalon interrupted, anger that bordered hysteria laced every word she said. 'They're as bad as he was, some even worse. So you really think they'll just hide away for the rest of their lives? They'll harm other people, maybe not today, not tomorrow, but they <em>will.'</em></p><p>    'There's nothing we can do now,' Ginny persisted. Avalon wished she'd just give up on her. 'This isn't your fight anymore, Avalon.'</p><p>    'No... I need to make this right.'</p><p>    Numb. Her hands felt so numb she could barely feel them – her heart, however, was beating so fast against her ribs it hurt.</p><p>    'You already did, everyone knows that,' Ginny assured her.</p><p>    Avalon didn't answer. From the corner of her eye, she saw a familiar walk past her and her heart decided to slip a beat. Two beats. Hell, maybe it decided to stop beating altogether.</p><p><em>    Theo. </em>His name was clear and loud in her mind, but she didn't say a thing.</p><p>    Her breath was stuck in her throat as she turned to face him.</p><p>    Their eyes only met for a fraction of a second.</p><p>    Her bones, her soul begged her to run to him, to wrap her arms around him, to feel his warm skin against hers one more time, but, without a second glance, he simply walked away and, against her mind's relentless pleading, she didn't move an inch to stop him.</p><p> </p>
