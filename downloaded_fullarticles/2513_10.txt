    <p>The atmosphere in the halls, in the Great Hall at meals, in classes… was much darker… much quieter… more subdued. The students kept their heads down, the once cheery chatter now resembled the low murmurings of those in mourning. Because they were. Mourning, that is. The Hogwarts population was almost a hundred lighter than each previous year. Many lives were lost at the Battle of Hogwarts, and many more either took their children and fled, or kept them home for the year to grieve and to be with family. Regardless of the many reasons why, the long tables in the Great Hall had many vacant seats, the dormitories of the upper years were half empty, and the halls were almost barren. Those who did return did not wander or go on leisurely strolls as they once did. No. They quickly and quietly made their way to and from their classes and back to the sanctuary of their dorms. No one lingered out on the grounds or in the halls for long, for no one cared to face the final resting places of their friends, their family members, their teachers. Hogwarts had been rebuilt and returned to its magnificent state, but the same could not be said for its occupants’ spirits.</p><p>Which was why McGonagall, the new Headmistress, had implemented several ideas to help her students cope with the war immediately following that first week back. There were mandatory meetings with Healers for all who either fought in the war or lost a loved one in the war, there were additional extracurricular activities (art classes, dueling clubs, flying lessons, dance classes) to help students relieve stress and channel their frustrations into something more appropriate, there was an educational tour to show younger students where aspects of the war took place and just how the war was won, a memorial was erected in the Entrance Hall for those who had bravely given their lives, and there was The Wall.</p><p>The Wall was just a bulletin board that was hung up in the Great Hall meant for students to post- well, anything. They could write about their experiences during the war, they could get out their frustrations or anger by venting, they could make an anonymous confession- anything that might help them release their demons. Other students could then respond or add to a post, or create a new one. There were no rules or limits on what could be posted, with the exception of slandering other, current students. It was meant to benefit the student body. And, it was very well-received.</p><p>About two months went by and Healer meetings were no longer mandatory. Most of the extracurriculars dissipated (with the exception of the dueling club and one art class), the tour was discontinued. But The Wall remained.</p><p>*             *             *             *             *</p><p>Harry was among the few who still went to the Healer every other week. He almost didn’t return to Hogwarts. The horrible memories, the things he saw, the things he <em>did</em>… he never wanted to set foot in his first real home ever again. It was like walking back into a waking nightmare. But Hermione had made a solid argument that he couldn’t- well, argue with. They had been given another chance at a future. The war prevented them from attending their final and most crucial year at Hogwarts, but, as awful as it is, the many vacancies this year allowed McGonagall to offer Harry’s year admission to complete their education as “eighth year” students.</p><p>And so, there Harry was, taking his very long route (one he mapped out that did <em>not</em> trigger terrible memories) to his biweekly Healer meeting. He had no desire to go, but he knew he wasn’t coping well. Why was he even concerned with his future? He should be dead.</p><p>That was a recurring topic all on its own. He was tired of discussing it. It was a fact that he should be dead after all. He <em>did</em> die in the Forbidden Forest. But of course, he couldn’t tell his Healer that. He was sworn to secrecy when it came to the horcruxes, and his own death was a part of that. He could not reveal it to anyone. Therefore, he just kept citing the prophecy as the reason for why he shouldn’t have survived, but she kept coming up with arguments against that logic. It was frustrating and not at all helpful. He did not continue seeing her to talk about his “survivor’s guilt.” There were other topics of discussion that they might actually be able to make progress on… if only he could summon the courage to bring them up.</p><p>He couldn’t do it. Instead they talked about how everyone died because of him. Again. He wished he could make it through one session without completely losing his composure and coming across like a pathetic, self-pitying sod. Some hero he was.</p><p>*             *             *             *             *</p><p>Harry stopped at the loo on the way to dinner to wash away the evidence of his earlier breakdown. He took a good look in the mirror- something he hadn’t done in weeks- and gaped at his reflection. His skin was pale, he had dark circles under his eyes, his cheeks were nearly sunken in, his eyes were dull… he looked gaunt. Hollow. The physical manifestation of misery and grief.</p><p>He ripped his gaze from his barely recognizable reflection and made his way to the Great Hall. He pushed the heavy doors open and noticed the crowd of students gathered around The Wall on his way to the Gryffindor table. He had thought about posting something up there, but each time this thought crossed his mind he decided against it. Everyone thought of him as a hero, a <em>savior</em>. No one wanted to hear him complain. He was interested though. Maybe he’d check out the new posts after he forced down a little dinner.</p><p>“How was your session?” Hermione asked as Harry sat across from her and Ron.</p><p>Harry shrugged, trying to find the words. “It was… typical. I avoided certain topics by bringing up more painful ones. I’m not sure it’s helping much anymore.”</p><p>“Please don’t give up on them just yet. I really think you could benefit if you’d just- just open up more. And not about the usual things. Your future, for instance-what you’d like to do once we graduate. Your thoughts on love and romance, and any potential prospects…”</p><p>Harry’s stomach was doing- unpleasant things. “I don’t have any potential prospects, Hermione, I-”</p><p>“What are you talking about, mate? Of course you do! Girls would line up for a chance to date you, even with you being all moody and such! Blimey, are you really that oblivious?”</p><p>“Ronald!”</p><p>Harry sat quietly and let his two best friends bicker. He didn’t feel like elaborating on his stance that he had no potential prospects… If the only people that were indeed interested in him were girls who hero-worshiped him, then he really didn’t have any actual prospects. That was one of the biggest things eating away at him- the fact that everyone treated him like some deity or something. He wasn’t. He was just- Harry. He wanted someone who would treat him as such. He wanted… well. He didn’t want to go there. He could barely admit it to himself in his own head. He wasn’t nearly ready to tell his friends. Which was why he remained silent throughout their bickering.</p><p>“…right, Harry?” Ron finished as he nudged the brunette’s arm.</p><p>Harry snapped back to the present with a start. “What?”</p><p>“You always have my sister. Ginny? Remember her? She still wants you back. How long are you going to keep her waiting?”</p><p>“I…” Harry faltered. He had forgotten about that. Well, he didn’t exactly <em>forget</em>, he just didn’t consider it an option now that he had discovered… He needed a good excuse. “I don’t think I’m ready to pursue a relationship or anything just yet. I’m still messed up over the war-”</p><p>“Which is precisely why you need this. It’ll take your mind off of everything. I know she’s my sister, and that’s disgusting, but you’re both of age now so I can’t threaten you anymore. So, if you <em>really</em> want a nice distraction from everything, I can tell you about a few that I know from experience will- Ow!”</p><p>“You will <em>not</em>, Ronald Weasely!” Hermione yelled as she smacked him in the arm.</p><p>Harry snickered. He took advantage of their distraction and made his way over to The Wall. He just had to see what had the Hall gossiping and chatting like they used to before he made his escape. He joined a few younger students and scanned the posts, noting the new additions. One was of someone’s nightmare, describing all of the horrible details and terrified reaction it provoked from its author. Harry barely batted an eye at it. Another post was a fifth year declaring his feelings for a fellow classmate. How cute. He glanced over at the author of that post and saw that his declaration had been rewarded. His crush was currently wrapped around him, snogging him senseless. Harry smiled to himself and looked back at The Wall.</p><p>Then he saw it; the post that everyone was undoubtedly gossiping about. Someone wrote an anonymous confession… they confessed to… being… <em>gay</em>.</p><p>Harry’s stomach churned unpleasantly. It felt like it had dropped out and was doing cartwheels up and down the aisle. <em>Merlin’s pants. Someone is gay…</em> He reread the post multiple times to make sure he had read it correctly. He had. <em>Someone is really gay. Someone here, at Hogwarts</em>.</p><p>“Shocker, innit? Wonder who it is,” the younger student said.</p><p>Harry glanced at him before turning away from The Wall. “What does it matter who it is? It’s their business.” He had to leave, he had to process this.</p><p>He quickly left the Great Hall and took his long route up to Gryffindor tower.</p><p>
  <em>So… He wasn’t alone.</em>
