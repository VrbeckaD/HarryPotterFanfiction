    <p>Tuesday Night<br/>
July 31<br/>
3 days before The Day<br/>
The Smallest Bedroom<br/>
4 Privet Drive<br/>
Little Whinging,<br/>
Surry</p><p>After a very eventfully day Harry Potter sat in his bedroom, on his bed, with his dog’s head in his lap.  At the foot of said bed was his school trunk, filled with most of the things he’d bought that day for the coming year.  New things.  New Things that were just for him.  It almost didn’t feel real.  As unlikely as magic, wizards, witches, goblins, dragons, and-</p><p>Harry’s eyes were drawn to the small stack of new books on his desk.  To be exact, to the one on top which was opened to a drawing showing a man and a woman walking out of a garden.  Above them were storm clouds letting go of their fist few drops of rain.  As was normal for most of the books Harry had gotten that day magic brought the picture to life.  Every now and then when the clouds moved just right Harry thought it looked like there was a face inside.  Underneath the image was a caption.  It read, ’It was only when Adam and Eve were leaving Eden that God was inspired to invent rain.’</p><p>From where his head lay in his master’s lap the newly named Buster looked at the books as well.</p><p>***<br/>
Earlier that day<br/>
Flourish and Blotts<br/>
Diagon Alley,<br/>
London</p><p>Books and books, so many books that the shelves were stacked right up to the ceiling.  Sniffing around them Buster could smell all sorts of magic and lingering aurors littering the stock.  Some of it smelled darkish, almost like something he might find back home in hell, while others burned with such benevolence it make his nose hurt.  The important thing was that he couldn’t smell anything that could do harm to his master, other than the people walking around, but Buster trusted he could handle them if need be.</p><p>His master, the antichrist was eager to look around but the half giant was trying to speed them along.  He cared about the stone in his pocket and some man called Dumbledore more than he did the Master’s desires and that Buster would not allow.  Thankfully the half giant’s will was full of vulnerabilities for the hell hound to exploit.  It only took a little nudging to quiet his worries so he would allow the Master to leisurely enjoy his first and what may very well be his only excursion into the magical world.  After all, soon enough everything would be coming to an end.</p><p>As they wondered through the stacks Buster stayed close to the boys side.  When the basket full of books began to strain his master he stepped in, gently taking the handles in his maw and carrying it himself to his master’s delight.  He got much pets and praise for his efforts which he basked in.  He had not known such pleasant attention since he was a pup and still with his mother and litter mates.  Hell had been training him and all the others who were the largest of their litters to possible guards for the antichrist since they were only weeks old.  The training had not been kind for Hell wouldn’t allow for the hounds to have anything less than a vicious temperament.  But viciousness was not what the Master wanted and so vicious Buster would no longer be.</p><p>They’d been going around the shop for a bit before the smell of home, faint though it was drew the hellhound’s attention.</p><p>“Buster,” his master asked.  That he sounded curious rather than demanding or scolding made Buster bold.  Creeping forward he led the Master to the source of the scent.  It was coming from a book on a shelf dedicated to heaven, hell, and their inhabitants.</p><p>The Master looked at the titles curiously, his brow pinching in confusion, before his face opened with surprise.  Reaching out his hand moved towards the center of the shelf which held several shiny new copies of a single title.  ’A Guide To The Devilish Denizens Of Hell.’</p><p>Strongly objecting Buster interceded, pushing the Master’s hand away from this text.  He’d heard talk of this book in hell and laughter.  The author had been influence by the great demon Crowley into lacing its entirety with partial truths and outright lies, most designed to mislead the mortals into thinking demons weren’t as vulnerable against magic and holy water as they truly were.  The rest was almost entirely fictitious fluff and nonsense about life in hell.  Buster would not have this being his Master’s introduction to his people.</p><p>Instead with a gentle push of his nose he directed the antichrist’s hand to the book which had first drawn his attention this way.  ‘The Truths Of Creation and the Fallen.’  The binding smelled of magic woven to beacon the readers towards the truths within with open minds.  It was delicate work, likely designed to shake the faith of the devote.  Buster hoped it would help his Master to accept the truth without any of the rubbish the mortals had taught him getting in the way.</p><p>Pulling it off from the shelf the boy flipped through absently.  Like many of kids his age the pages of text weren’t enough to fully capture his interest.  It wasn’t until he came across a picture that he stopped flipping.  The pen and ink drawing depicted heaven and hell.  Up in the heavens were the angels, beautiful and light with their white feathered wings.  Down in hell most of the demons were depicted as dark but still being beautiful with a few mixed among them who were ugly, filthy, or in distinctly none human forms.  In Buster’s experience they’d gotten the ratio wrong.  Those who were clean and unmarked by hell were rare.</p><p>Flipping the pages again the Master moved on to find the next picture.  Again the image depicted heaven and hell.  At the top stood the great Lord Lucifer in his lost angelic form.  Moving down the page with him you watched his fall and transformation until finally he stood in his all his glory as King of Hell only to move off page and reappear an angel at the top.  With an unsteady hand the antichrist reached out to stroke a finger over the image of his father.  Despite not knowing about his true heritage the image still called to him.  Faintly Buster could hear the first whispers of Hell’s influence reaching out to his Master’s mind.  They would grow louder as the days past, guiding him in what was too come.  For now they would touch only his subconscious but closer the end he would hear their instructions clearly.  Or so it was said in hell.</p><p>“Hagrid,” the Master asked hesitantly.</p><p>The half giant hummed distractedly as most of his attention was occupied with a book on the history of cross breeding to created new magical species which Buster had used to help tempt him into reading so he might happily spending more time in the shop.</p><p>Swallowing, the Master couldn’t take his eyes off the book in his hand.  Finding his courage he asked, “Demons aren’t real?  Are they?”</p><p>“Oh they are.  The worst sort they are.  Not much out there as evil as a demon.”  Looking up from his book he put a hand on Harry’s shoulder as he imparted some choice words of wisdom, “No matter what kind of trouble you get into, never make a deal with a demon Harry.  Never.  The price you pay won’t be worth it, no matter how good the deal sounds.  You hear?”</p><p>The boy nodded numbly while Buster rolled his eyes.  It was good advise, for a human, but this was the antichrist, Prince of Hell.  All of demon kind answered to only one other above him.  Whatever he asked for would be given.  No demon would dare deceive or swindle him.</p><p>Staring at the titles on the shelf before him the Master asked, “And angels?  Are they real too?”</p><p>With his nose already back in his book Hagrid snorted.  “Of course they are.  If there were no angels to fall from heaven there would be no demons to tempt souls to hell.”</p><p>Looking up at Hagrid with wide eyes the Master asked softly, “And god?”</p><p>***</p><p>Back in the smallest bedroom<br/>
4 Privet Drive<br/>
Little Whinging,<br/>
Surry</p><p>After giving Buster one last scratch behind the ear Harry gently pat him.  Sensing a change his Master’s intent the hound lift his head.  Free to move without disturbing his dog Harry slid out of the bed and onto his feet while Buster remained where he lay but with his head kept up, watching intently as Harry moved about the room getting ready for bed.  He wanted to follow when the boy made for the bathroom but a gentle stay from Harry kept him to the bed.</p><p>When Harry returned he shut off the lights and laid his glasses on the desk.  Then with no small amount of hesitation he made to kneel beside his bed.  With his elbows on the mattress he brought his hands together in the way he always saw those in prayer depicted.  </p><p>When he was younger Harry used to pray often.  He’d heard god looked after and loved all children.  That was an appealing promise to someone like him who couldn’t remember what it was like to be loved and looked after.  Harry never consciously chose to stop praying.  It wasn’t some dramatic decision, just a habit that had dwindled as it stopped being a comfort to Harry with the years passing without his prayers being answered.  </p><p>Sometimes, even though he didn’t want to, he wondered if the Dursleys were right and there was something wrong with him and that was why he wasn’t lovable.  If even god who loved all couldn’t be bothered with him.  In no time at all though Harry’s life was almost unrecognizable.  It seemed like so many of his prayers had come true all at once.  He couldn’t help but to wonder if maybe, god had a hand in it.  Maybe they really did care, had spent the last years moving all this into place, and Harry just hadn’t been patient enough.</p><p>With his eyes closed and his head bowed Harry began his prayers, without form or ceremony, speaking aloud directly to the Almighty as though speaking with a beloved friend.</p><p>Close by Buster’s ears had flatten back as he held himself low to the bed, instinct driving him to get as small as possible because this?  This was no good.  If he ever found out about the boy praying to the Almighty and not to hell? Lucifer would not be pleased.</p><p>It was all Buster could do to hold back from whining or nudging his Master to get him to stop.  His fear of the father was not enough to empower the hound to go against the antichrist’s will.  The boy wanted to pray.  He was made happy by the exercise.  So despite his distress Buster kept quietly where he was as his Master continued to pray until a yawn interrupted his words.  It was at this point that he realized he might fall asleep kneeling on the floor and so wrapped up this ‘conversation,’ saying his goodnights to the Almighty… throwing in well wishes for those in heaven.</p><p>Lucifer could never know.</p><p>And so it was with much relief that Buster watched his master stand and crawl into bed.</p><p>“Come on buddy,” he said said patting the bed next to him.  </p><p>Eagerly buster moved up the bed to lay beside his master.  The boy was smaller than him in length and bulk.  He was able to hide the boy almost completely behind his body like this.  Such a small thing,  Nuzzling in close Buster enjoyed the contact and the warmth, the soft mattress beneath them, and his master’s fingers burring into his fur to hold on tight as he drifted off to sleep.  There would be no sleep for Buster though.  He must remain vigilant and aware.  Buster would keep his Master safe until he truly came into his powers.</p><p>The boy had only been sleeping for a few short minutes when Buster’s ears twitched.  The whispers had returned to speak to his Master as he slept.  Blocking them out the hound focused on listening for sounds of what was physically present.  Because of that there was something the hellhound missed.  Two other voices that were speaking to his master, blocking out the voices of hell.</p>
