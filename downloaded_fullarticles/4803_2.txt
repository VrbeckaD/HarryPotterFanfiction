          <div class="userstuff"><p>The sight of the <em>thing</em> lying in the bed disgusts Bartemius Crouch. Finding it impossible to call Barty Jr. his son anymore, he refers to him in his head as ‘the <em>thing,’</em> and the heap of bones that Barty has become furthers the illusion.<br/>
<br/>
Every time Bartemius looks at Barty Jr., he regrets the promise he made to his wife. The <em>thing</em> should be locked in Azkaban, instead of being nursed back to health by a house-elf. Winky does not care that the young master is a despicable Death Eater; she dotes on him, like Barty Jr.’s mother would have, if she had not taken his place. <br/>
<br/>
Every time Bartemius thinks of his wife, of her dying alone in Azkaban to save her son, he feels bitter. He misses her — the only person he ever loved — and now he has Barty Jr. in her place, an unwanted burden. <br/>
<br/>
Barty Jr. had been named after him, the son that should have been the apple of his father’s eye. But instead of making him proud, Barty Jr. ruined Bartemius’s dreams of being the Minister of Magic. <br/>
<br/>
Bartemius does not love the <em>thing</em> — not like his wife did — and so it is easy for him to keep Barty Jr. subdued with spells. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Incarcerous</em> is his favorite. <br/>
<br/>
Watching his former son fight against the conjured ropes of the <em>Incarcerous</em> spell quickly becomes a nightly ritual. Barty Jr. struggles futilely until he passes out, exhausted from screaming threats and tugging against the ropes. <br/>
<br/>
It’s the perfect stress relief, especially after Bartemius is shunted to a dead-end department.<br/>
<br/>
At least he still has control over some<em>thing.</em></p></div>
