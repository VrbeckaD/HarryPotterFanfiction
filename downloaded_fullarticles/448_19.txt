One of its number one employees, Vernon Dursley is in deep conversation with a friend of a wife of an employee, Petunia Evans.</p><p>Petunia yawned. "What is your plan to stay awake?"</p><p>Vernon smirked. "A little game I like to call posh, boring or both?"</p><p>Petunia said, "Hm, do go on."</p><p>Vernon told her, "It's simple really, we take turns choosing three random people in this room and say which is posh, boring and both."</p><p>Petunia smiled slightly. "I do like the prospect."</p><p>Vernon asked, "The guy in the bowler hat Reilly, that lady in the purple frock Samantha and me?"</p><p>Petunia grinned. "Easy. Reilly is boring, Samantha is posh. Therefore, you are both."</p><p>Vernon laughed. "First test test passed with flying colours."</p></div>
