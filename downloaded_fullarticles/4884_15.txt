    <p>A young babe and a letter are left on the chilled steps of number 4 Privet Drive on an early November morning, the child is as still and silent as Death while the writing on the parchment declares him Harry James Potter. Somewhere else, in a towering bank with halls of glittering marble the Death of two young parents is recorded with their only living relatives; Petunia Dursley nee Evans, and Vitus Jormungadr Mortis. On a letter there is a name <strike>Vitus Jormungadr Mortis</strike> Harry James Potter; on a Death certificate there is a list of living relatives Petunia Dursley nee Evans, <strike>Harry James Potter</strike> Vitus Jormungadr Mortis.  </p>
<p>He lives yet he doesn’t, he exists yet not. </p>
<p>The Death bell <em>tolls</em>.</p>
