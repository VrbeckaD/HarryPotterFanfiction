    <p>Albus Dumbledore was not a humble man. Proud and occasionally vain, he sought the secrets of the unknown, hoping that it would lead him to the most singular truth he has ever known: life beyond death. He used those around him as tools and disposed of them when they were no longer useful. Many did not know this side of the man who wore a continuous smile and had a twinkle in his eye. Only a few knew of his arrogance and power and one of that few was gliding towards his patrolling figure outside of the castle.</p><p>“Headmaster…” the ghost whispered in a gentle voice. Even in his undying form, he was dressed in layers of simple clothing, the clothing of someone who didn’t really want to be noticed. How he had come to haunting the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was a mystery, even to the other ghosts. For you see, he was the first to haunt Hogwarts…and thus, the oldest. Even the Bloody Baron and Helena Ravenclaw, more commonly known as The Grey Lady, weren’t comparable in age to this ghost.</p><p>“Ah…what can I do for you?” the twinkle was not in Albus’ eye tonight the ghost noticed as he glided alongside the Headmaster.</p><p>“I’ve come with a warning tonight,” he whispered quietly, “five will appear as if none had seen them before in this lifetime. You must trust them…”</p><p>“But of course,” Albus nodded.</p><p>“No,” the ghost whispered firmly, “do not attempt your foolish practices on them. They will not serve you well in the long run…”</p><p>“You mean for the defeat of Tom?”</p><p>“I mean beyond that which no one can see…”</p><p>The Headmaster of the school raised a curious eyebrow, “And pray tell, why must I believe you?”</p><p>“Because I bring word from the Weavers, Headmaster…”</p><p>If there was one thing that could surprise Albus Dumbledore, the ghost knew that it was this. He watched as the grizzled old wizard’s white eyebrows shot straight into his hairline as both halted.</p><p>“Are you sure,” the next words from Albus were so cold and hard that if the ghost had believed in the appearance that the Headmaster gave off, he would have believed the man standing in front of him was a Death Eater who had drank Polyjuice Potion. However, the ghost just nodded.</p><p>“Thank you Ignotus, I will heed your warning,” the Headmaster nodded once, slowly before walking away, leaving the ghostly form of Ignotus Perevell floating behind him.</p><p>The ghost shook his head before addressing the sky above him, “This isn’t how its supposed to happen!”</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry Potter, The-Boy-Who-Lived, twice, landed on the cold, hard, wet, ground of darkness with a painful thump. He scrambled out of the way just as he sensed four other people falling around him and managed to only get his legs squished under the heavy weight of Neville Longbottom.</p><p>“Ow! Get off!” somewhere near his right; Ginny Weasley muttered before drawing her wand and said, “Lumos!”</p><p>Harry adjusted his glasses which had become skewed on his nose and looked around the lighted area where Ginny had lit up. It looked oddly…familiar…</p><p>“What in bloody hell was that?!” his best friend Ron Weasley said to his right, picking himself up after making sure his girlfriend Hermione was all right…</p><p>“I…don’t know,” Harry pulled himself to his feet and stood up, still feeling a bit dizzy.</p><p>“Hey…weren’t we just in the school?” Neville asked also lighting his wand, “what are we doing outside?”</p><p>“Why is it so dark? I thought the centaurs were still celebrating outside with the giants?” Ginny moved closer to him and he reached out and grabbed her hand, squeezing it for reassurance.</p><p>“If they were I assure you, they wouldn’t be here on the school’s grounds,” a new, yet familiar voice startled all of them and they turned to their left to see someone who should have been quite dead walking into the edge of their lights.</p><p>“You should be dead,” Harry said as he drew out his wand, mildly surprised to see that in his hand was the Elder Wand.</p><p>“I saw you die by Severus Snape’s hand, Albus Dumbledore…”</p><p> </p>
