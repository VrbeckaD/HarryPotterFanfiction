          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily Potter was sipping her tea and reading the papers in the Potter kitchen when she heard her son, Harry, stomp his feet all the way to his bedroom while muttering something like “stupid Tom Riddle” under his breath.</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course.</span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry often talked about Tom Riddle. Well, more like <em>complained </em>actually. So often, in fact, that Lily already memorized some details about the boy. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was a Slytherin, apparently, and was so arrogant that Harry instantly had an all-out academic debate with him—with a few insults here and there—the moment they met.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry even mentioned—in a mocking voice—that though Riddle was not a pureblood name, the Riddles were a very <em>prominent </em>family in muggle England. In fact, there were even rumors that Tom Riddle used to play with Prince Edward when they were young. That was how high up they were in the social ladder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was always beating Harry in his grades too which was probably the biggest source of frustration his son was feeling. He’s never really been challenged before. And now here comes Tom Riddle in all his alpha glory, not only challenging Harry but actually <em>beating</em> him<em>—</em>at everything<em>—</em>without so much of an effort. Lily couldn't count all the times Harry would come home complaining about Tom answering every possible recitations before Harry even knew the answers to them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">James had said that this Tom fellow probably did not hate Harry and Harry probably did not hate him too. Harry had indignantly disagreed and Lily nodded fiercely along with his son. James only said that because he couldn’t hear half the things that Harry said about the Slytherin. The fact that he was Slytherin alone made him suspicious, if Lily was being honest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily’s thoughts are interrupted as Harry suddenly appears in the kitchen and grumbles that Lily has to talk to Headmaster Dippet for a Parent-Teacher consultation as he is graduating soon.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What are you so angry about?” Lily asks already knowing the answer.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry sighs overdramatically. “Tom will assist you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well, that wasn’t so bad. At least Lily will finally get to meet the boy who teases her son a lot.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Lily says, quite taken aback. “<em>You’re</em> Tom Riddle?” She asks widening her eyes towards Harry.</span> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harry never told her he looked like… looked like <em>this</em>. </span> <span class="s1">Merlin. </span> <span class="s1">The Slytherin smirks in a way that reminded Lily of when she was just a school girl with a school girl crush and immediately understands. James was probably right. They <em>may</em> not really hate each other…</span></p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">How Harry was able to survive with smirks like that directed at him all the time was a mystery to Lily.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her <em>poor </em>son, she thinks to herself, he never stood a chance against <em>this</em> in the first place.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Lady Potter,” Tom greets smoothly, taking Lily’s hand and kissing it. “You are far more beautiful in person than all the papers could print you,” It should have sounded practiced. It should have. No one can say that without sounding fake. But Tom sounded sincere, charming even, brimming with utmost confidence that Lily couldn’t help but giggle a little. <span class="s1">She looks at Harry with a huge grin on her face.</span> Her son only looks at her in a horrified manner. “I am Tom Riddle, Head Alpha of Hogwarts and I will assist you today.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s nice to finally meet you, <em>Tom</em>,” Lily says with a big smile. “I’ve heard <em>so much</em> about you.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Beside her, Harry noticeably stiffens.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh?” Tom asks, one eyebrow raised elegantly, looking at Harry amusedly. “Only good things, I hope.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh yes,” Lily gushes. “<em>Very </em>good things, indeed.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That, was the farthest thing from the truth. But she figured her son needed a little push in the right direction.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry grabs Lily by the arm that almost hurt and smiles at her tightly. “Mom, shouldn’t you be going to Headmaster Dippet’s office by now?” The way his grip threatened Lily made her grin even larger.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course, of course,” Lily says looking at Tom.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Head Alpha smiles at her. “If you’ll follow me, Lady Potter.” The alpha leads the way, strides long and confident, robes billowing behind him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So, Tom, you are Head Alpha, yes?” Lily asks curiously. “You must be incredibly intelligent to secure such a position.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">With this, the alpha looks back and smiles at her, all charm and modesty. “I can only hope to be as bright as your son.” He says pleasantly totally evading the question, though Lily knew he was graduating as Valedictorian this year with Harry mentioning it every five minutes in their home.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry scoffs beside Lily. Tom turns back around just in time for Lily to see a satisfied smirk at his lips. Harry rolls his eyes and looks at Lily with an expression that said <em>‘See what I have to deal with everyday?’.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Lady Potter, I believe you graduated Valedictorian of your class.” Tom says charmingly, smiling at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">How did he know that? </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You did?” Harry stops walking and looks at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I did,” Lily confirms.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The <em>first </em>omega to be given the award,” Tom says appreciatively.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily grins. This boy has done his research. Harry looks gobsmacked beside her and hurries his steps so he can walk beside Tom. Harry whispers angrily at Tom while the taller boy just looks on ahead.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Then suddenly, Harry looks back at Lily. “Mom, I want to see your Valedictorian picture in the trophy room!” He says excitedly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry isn’t looking where he was going which should be a concern for Lily because there were <em>definitely</em> some students going the opposite direction that he was going to bump into. She was about to tell him to be careful when Tom places his hand on Harry’s back and casually guides Harry’s body to avoid colliding with anyone while talking to Lily.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry doesn’t notice and keeps talking to Lily.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Do we have time to do that?” Lily asks, completely distracted by Tom’s hand on Harry’s back. She was so going to tell James about this when she gets home.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m afraid we can’t—“</span>
</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“God, don’t be such a buzzkill, Tom,” Harry rolls his eyes. And there it is again, Lily observes. But this time, it’s Harry who does it. He takes Tom’s arm and leads him so they can change directions to go to the the Gryffindor common room. It’s such a casual gesture that Lily can’t help but think that this must have already happened a number of times in the past. What’s more is that the alpha allows the action, yet his face was totally blank.</span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily follows them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Wow,” Harry whispers as he sees his mom’s picture. “You look so beautiful here, mom.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily knew she should be looking at her picture and she did, pretended to, actually but she watches as Tom’s formerly blank expression becomes gentle as he looks at Harry totally amazed by Lily’s picture.</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">They make their way into the headmaster’s office. The students look at Harry and Tom in almost an awed way, Lily notices. The alphas stare at Harry but immediately look away when they see Tom looking at them. The omegas whisper and giggle as Tom passes by. Harry doesn’t react but instead chooses to say something to Tom almost as if to distract him from their attention.</span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They finally reach Headmaster Dippet’s office and Tom looks back to her with the same charming smile at his face. “Lady Potter, we’re here. It was an honor to meet you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, please,” She says, smiling widely. “You can call me Lily.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Oh, James was <em>totally</em> going to hear about this.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Lily hums as he takes a seat beside Harry in his bedroom. “You know,” she begins. “I hated your father too.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry looks at her, a frown still on his face. “You <em>didn’t,” </em>Harry says disgustedly. “At least not the same as I hate Tom Riddle.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I did,” Lily laughs. “He was an asshole, he bullied my best friend and teased me all the time.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He did?” Harry asks, quite sure, his mother was just making this thing up. “How come I never knew about this before?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, your father and I never really talk about it anymore,” Lily says. “But we did, hated each other so much… until… he asked me on a date.” Lily grinned towards her son.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>“No way,</em>” Harry said. “How did he do it?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, you know he was bullying Uncle Severus and I was screaming at him to stop and he told me he would on one condition…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry rolled his eyes. “Let me guess…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yep,” Lily says smiling at the memory. “It was in bad taste but… He <em>was </em>James Potter. The coolest guy ever. And he was asking <em>me </em>out.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re cool too, mom.” Harry says absent-mindedly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know, baby, but you know when you’re young and you aren’t really aware of these things,” She explains. “Now... this boy you hate...”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I hate him,” Harry says passionately. “And trust me, it’s not like with you and dad. He’s just <em>insufferable</em>.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Mhm,” Lily says knowingly. “He is <em>very</em> insufferable."</span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Isn’t he?!” Harry says. “You saw the way he absolutely looked like he was superior to me!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah, totally, <em>super </em>superior.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And the way he talks to me as if I can’t understand what he’s saying!” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>And the way he looks at you,</em> Lily almost says. <em>With the same fire that you look at him.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily nods at everything her son says.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ah, young love. She was so happy that her son got to experience it as well.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry swallows as Tom’s father looks at him. It was... unnerving to say the least. Something about the man screamed power even when he held no magic at all. Harry immediately registers the rich fabric Tom’s father wore. Whatever rumors he heard about Tom’s muggle bloodline came back to him—of how rich and influential they were in the muggle world. Suddenly, those rumors don’t seem to be just rumors anymore.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Riddle Sr. didn’t even seem fazed by all the magic he was seeing as if he was born into it, as if he sees it everyday. He kept a strangely calm and dominating facade, head held high, face proud—exactly like his son. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course the similarities were there. They looked exactly the same except for their eyes—Tom Sr.’s eyes held a warm brown color to them while Tom’s was a cold dark blue. But the Riddle charisma was reaching out to Harry. The charisma that instantly made you like the man, not that Harry liked Tom or anything like that. But there was that pull, their very persons having a gravity of their own.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still, Harry pushes his shoulders back and smiles prettily. If there was one thing he was good at, it was charming alphas. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He came dressed in his best robes, the Riddle emblem clear and menacing both at his chest and at the ring in his hand. He was always in his best clothes, of course. Working close with England’s royal family required that of him. But his son had written to him, in his usual formal letters, asking quite subtly, no<em> telling</em> him to wear the expensive black robes he only wore on very special occasions. And also, somehow, indirectly telling him to wear their family ring.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He had obliged. It was rare for his son to ask something of him, when he was usually so independent. And if he took the time to write to him about it, then it must be serious.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And when he saw the boy accompanying his son to greet him, it suddenly became <em>very</em> clear.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And when the boy got closer, ah, it was no wonder then, why his son was so smitten. The boy was beautiful and if he wasn’t mistaken, with the way his cheeks burned and the way his eyes were intensely focused on Tom, he was completely infuriated at his son.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That must be a first.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The Riddle senior smirked before reaching out his hand. “Tom Riddle Sr.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The boy straightens up and smiles charmingly, the confidence of a being an heir suddenly very apparent, takes his hand and shakes it firmly. “Mr. Riddle,” he says prettily, batting his eyelashes. “I’m Harry Potter, Head Omega, and I will be your guide today,” he says as he shakes Tom Sr.’s hand. “Now I finally know where Tom gets his good looks from,” the boy says all grace and charm of an omega.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Sr. sees his son’s expression completely close off at this declaration. His eyes are emotionless, his face not giving anything away. To outsiders, it might even seem frightening. But Tom Sr. knew better. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Tom’s face suddenly became blank, it meant he was… <em>feeling</em> things. Right now, he was probably brimming with absolute... giddiness. The boy called Tom <em>handsome </em>albeit indirectly<em>.</em> And even though everyone he met has expressed this certain sentiment at him from all ages of his life, this was different. This was special.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Tom shouldn’t be here,” the omega informs him. “But he loves his <em>daddy</em> so much he wants everything to be perfect.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“On the contrary,” His son’s commanding voice says. “I <em>have</em> to be here,” His son says pointedly at the omega, a bit of an alpha bite present in his tone. The omega is not even affected but instead looks at Tom with a bit of mischief in his eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mr. Riddle,” Harry says smugly. “If you’ll follow me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He follows the small omega, who was small, really, even for an omega. He had to look up at Tom all the time and his son also had to look down when they were talking.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was rather... adorable.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Is this your first time in Hogwarts, sir?” Harry asks kindly. Tom snorts at his side. Harry pretends not to notice, smile frozen and entirely directed at the older Riddle.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No,” he says plainly. Tom smirks at his reply and Harry blushes but smiles again instantly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course, Tom would have wanted you to experience the magic as well,” Harry says diplomatically, trying to engage the man in conversation.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He did,” Tom Sr. says. “Tom is the best son anyone could ever hope to have.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Sr. sees Harry’s smile twitch at the sides as if stopping himself from laughing, and Tom surprisingly does not look embarrassed at his father’s declaration, but rather smug.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not really surprised, Mr. Riddle,” Harry bats his eyelashes. “With a father like you, Tom’s bound to be perfect.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Sr. chuckles. “Indeed,” he agrees. The boy was <em>cheeky</em>—tongue honed for flattery like any heir should be. He would make a good Riddle. And those <em>eyes</em> with Tom’s sharp cheekbones—ah, but he was getting ahead of himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Careful, father,” Tom says in obvious mock warning. “You’re not the first alpha he’s charmed.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry laughs loudly albeit still gracefully, eyes looking at Tom, not delighted at all. He opens his mouth but instantly bites his lip. Tom Sr. smirks. It was rather amusing to see how the boy was trying hard to suppress his tongue, torn between wanting to fight with Tom or impressing his father.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But there was no need for that. If his son was impressed, it was easy to see why—the Potter heir was intelligent, probably the only one would could keep up with Tom, he was gutsy too, with a sharp tongue that matched his son’s quick mind.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Sr. had a feeling that this was exactly why Tom liked Harry and not his appearance as he first originally thought. It was the challenge he presented, the utter confidence that he carried himself against Tom when everyone was completely smitten with him and would give him anything he wanted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His mother was the same way, Tom Sr. recalls fondly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And here I thought I caught myself a pretty omega,” Tom Sr. says.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry giggles charmingly, completely unabashed by a direct flirtation, and smirking egotistically at his son. There’s a sense of pride at his eyes, knowing full well that he has won Tom’s father’s approval.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This omega, Tom Sr. guessed, was entirely clueless as to what his son was feeling for him and what he was feeling for his son. But, no matter, that could be fixed easily.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As they reach the headmaster’s office, the omega smiles at him and says he could enter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He nods and places his hand on the doorknob, pausing as he enters the door, “It’s nice meeting you,” Tom Sr. drawls. “Especially since my son never introduces his omega girlfriends to me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The temperature in the room drops.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom’s magic suddenly reaching out suffocatingly to him in threat. The omega’s smile freezes and he pales. Harry takes an instinctive step back, almost hiding behind Tom. As this happens, his son takes a step forward, shielding the omega from him almost… protectively.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Father,” Tom says darkly. “We are <em>not </em>together.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh?” Tom Sr. asks, one delicate eyebrow up in the air. “I could have sworn...” He muses thoughtfully, closing the door behind him before his son could murder him.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry,” Tom calls after him. Harry walks faster, never feeling more humiliated in his life. “Harry.” Tom calls again, catching up with Harry almost so effortlessly.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Damn his short legs.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry walks even faster not wanting to face or talk to Tom at this moment. It was stupid. It was really stupid. He didn’t even know why he felt this way. It wasn’t like he and Tom were ever a thing. He didn’t know why it hurt though. When Tom said it so casually like that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Because… maybe… maybe his mother was right. Maybe he did kind of like Tom even though he was a complete asshole and he drove Harry nuts all the time and they fought all time and Harry can never comprehend why Tom annoyed him when people don’t usually annoy him and why Harry wants to annoy Tom too all the time and now—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s throat hurts.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Harry,” Tom calls, impatient.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No!” Harry says. “I hate you! Don’t come after me! I hate you!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry,” Tom calls lacing his tone with a bit of an alpha command.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry stills, instantly irritated over the power Tom has over him, mostly irritated that it didn’t affect him the way it should–to annoy him and make him abhor the alpha even more for making Harry follow orders. Instead, the omega in him can’t help but crave the praise that goes with submitting to an alpha, to Tom. He could very well ignore he command but… he seethes. “I said I hate you!” Harry finally stops to face Tom, eyes burning bright and cheeks red from anger and embarrassment. “I hate you I hate you I <em>hate </em>you—“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know,” Tom says, tone steady and comforting and deep. “You’ve been saying that to me since we were eleven, Harry.” Tom says while looking at him. “Why are you crying?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">What? Harry didn't even know he was crying. He takes a step forward, suddenly very aware of the calmness that Tom was emitting, wanting nothing more than to be comforted by the alpha but he stops himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I hate you,” Harry says passionately. Even now, when he wanted nothing more than to be held, to bask in Tom’s comforting presence, he couldn’t. That wasn’t his place. That was never his place. They were enemies, rivals, they always fought. This just makes Harry cry even more. <em>We are not together</em>… Harry remembers the way Tom’s face looked when he said that. He looked so serious and scary… like it was such a horrifying idea.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I hate your <em>stupid</em> face,” he says while tears fell from his eyes. “And—and the way you always know the answer in class before I do,” Because he did. Harry hated him for it. “And the way you treat my mom as if she—as if she—“ The way he effortlessly charmed Lily was annoying too because—“You <em>never</em> treat me that way! You’re always nice to everyone except to me! And I hate that I have to look up at you every time I talk to you because who the fuck is that—“ Harry motions towards all of Tom “—tall anyway?!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom doesn’t say anything. Harry wipes the tears falling in his cheeks and sees that Tom’s hands were fisted as if he was trying to keep them where they were.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Is that really why you’re crying?” Tom asks seriously, finally breaking the silence.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry cries harder because it wasn’t. He was crying because—because— “I just—“ He sniffles. “Your father said—and then you—“ Harry’s eyes gets suddenly wide and then he smacks Tom’s arm, angry again. “You said we weren’t together!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We <em>aren’t.</em>” Tom explains as if he was explaining to a child.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know that!” Harry says vehemently. “But… but…” He doesn’t look at Tom and blushes. “But it hurt me when you said it like that… like—like, like I was nothing to you.” Harry admits, hopelessly embarrassed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Again, Tom doesn’t talk and Harry doesn’t dare look up at him. This was embarrassing enough as it is. What if Tom thought he was stupid? What if he just got more disgusted by Harry’s crying and his declaration? God, he was such an idiot. Why did Harry even have to open his mouth in the first place—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Suddenly, he felt Tom’s hand on his waist, pulling him into the taller man, and it should have hurt, really, it should have, Tom did it so harshly but all it did was make him shiver, goosebumps running all over Harry’s skin, and he wasn’t entirely sure why but it felt <em>good. </em>Harry looks up and his eyes go wide as he realizes what Tom’s intents were and it was too late to move, not that he could move anyway because Tom was holding him tightly in place and—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Wow.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom was so… warm… and <em>wonderful</em> that he couldn’t help but giggle into the kiss.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry,” Tom chastises.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hmm,” Harry says leaning in again to try and get another taste of—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why are you laughing?” Tom asks him seriously.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry smiles, pulling gently at Tom’s hair to make him come closer. “You feel good,” he says, wanting nothing more than to kiss Tom again.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You were angry just a minute ago—“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not angry now,” Harry says kissing Tom again lightly on the lips. “Again.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom looks at him, and allows the kisses, thank God.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You’re not angry anymore?” Tom asks placing his hands on Harry’s arms.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No,” Harry says. “Come kiss me aga—“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>Harry</em>,” Tom pulls him up by the chin, an arrogant smirk on his lips, the Tom Harry knows well. “You really are so clueless, aren’t you, despite being as smart as I am.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry pouts in spite of himself, feeling rather cute and giddy, liking the way Tom’s attention was all on him, his hands on his waist, pressing their bodies together. “I am <em>not </em>clueless.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom smirks. “You know this means you’re mine now, right?” he asks placing quick kisses on Harry’s neck.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry doesn’t answer but instead chooses to crash his lips against Tom’s again. Tom already knew his answer before he did anyway. He always did.</span>
</p>

  <span class="s1">“There’s this alpha that Draco really admires, he says he’s in the seventh year, Harry might know him,” Narcissa says. “Someone named Tom... Rydle?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily gasps excitedly. “You mean Tom Riddle?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes!” Narcissa says. “So you do know him? Draco says he wants to be like him when he grows up.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“<em>That</em> is my future son-in-law you are talking about,” Lily says smugly.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You mean <em>our</em> future son-in-law,” James chimes excitedly beside her.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You know I heard his muggle family is like, thirty-fourth in line for the English throne,” Lily says proudly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And,” James says. “If we can Avada Kedavra thirty-three people, our son could become…” James and Lily look at each and take a deep breath. “<em>The Queen of England!</em>” They finish together triumphantly grinning brightly at Narcissa.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Really?” Narcissa asks. “And how can you be so sure?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lily and James look at each other smugly. “Oh you have <em>no </em>idea, Cissy,” Lily begins. James nods enthusiastically beside her. “At the Parent-Teacher consultation, see… Tom Riddle assisted me…”</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Narcissa listens to Lily’s story and looks at James who was just as giddy as his wife. She felt her chest swell with the familiar feeling of protectiveness. James and Lily were always so pure even when they were still in Hogwarts.</span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Narcissa smiles fondly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Really, sometimes she wondered how Harry was faring with such <em>childish</em> parents.</span>
