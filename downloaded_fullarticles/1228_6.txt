  <em>He just looks so good in that uniform.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And while he's eating. How does someone eat that clean?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He grew up with parents, idiot. He was taught manners.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Unlike me.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I learned them. Eventually. By watching others. By watching him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I wish he didn't hate me so much.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I want to be friends. Maybe more. If he would even want me.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I doubt it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Oh shit. Look away. Don't turn around yet. Keep cool. Don't let him see.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I slightly turned away from him, as if something was happening behind him that was interesting. I slowly start to scan the Great Hall, trying to look as nonchalant as possible. I scan the the table where the professors sit. McGonagall is talking with Flitwick about something that must be exciting because the little man's hands are flying everywhere and McGonagall is trying very hard not to look amused. It takes me back a little to not see Dumbledore in the Headmaster's seat. It still hurts, but Snape and I have come to an understanding. I think. Hard to tell with that man sometimes. He is also neatly cutting his food into bite sized pieces.</p>
<p>
  <em>Huh. Must be a Slytherin thing.</em>
</p>
<p>I let my eyes continue their path until I am looking back at my friends so I can pretend I know what they were saying.</p>
<p>"-seriously isn't listening! Hello?! Earth to Harry?!"</p>
<p>"Sorry Mione. I got distracted. What did you say?"</p>
<p>"We can see that mate. Who's on your mind so often you're distracted? I haven't seen you like this since you were following Malfoy with that blasted map."</p>
<p>"It's-it's no one." I blush a little and look down at the table and then quickly look back up at Hermione.</p>
<p>"Don't pressure him Ronald. He'll tell us when he's ready." She gave me a little smirk which made my stomach churn a little. That smirk means she knows what you know, but not because you told her; she figured it out herself.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I was asking you if you were going to be okay with the whole inter-house unity thing that Snape wants. Ron knows who he's paired with, but it isn't you. We're worried about you being stuck with someone who was a Death Eater supporter."</p>
<p>"Thanks for the concern guys, but I think I'll be fine. Most of them I could take on just fine."</p>
<p>Seeing the incredulous looks I was getting, I said, "Guys. Seriously. I'll be fine. If I have a big issue I'll bring it up to Snape, I promise."</p>
<p>"Alright mate. Just know I'm first in line to punch someone if they hurt you."</p>
<p>I grinned while Hermione shook her head and told us to finish dinner.</p>
<p>Happy they dropped the conversation, I did a quick glance at the table where he sat. He was turned back around and eating, but Blaise made eye contact. Oddly enough, all he did was hold my gaze for a few seconds, nod, then go back to eating.</p>
<p>
  <em>I wonder why he did that.</em>
</p><hr/>
<p align="justify">Once dinner was finished, Snape stood up and gave the usual Headmaster speech before saying, "All returning Eighth Years, please stay here. You will be escorted to your new dormitory and given roommates once everyone else has left."</p>
<p align="justify">The rest of the houses left for their respective dorms and all of the professors except for Snape left, and the rest of us were anxiously waiting to leave and find out who we had to room with for the rest of the school year. Knowing you were going to be split from your friends was daunting to some, especially after everything that went down last year.</p>
<p align="justify">Amazingly enough, it was Dumbledore that took down Voldemort. All it took from me was a "Hey you!" to get Voldemort to turn his head, and Dumbledore managed to cast a spell strong enough to ensure Voldemort would die and actually stay dead this time. The spell worked, but not without a cost. The spell sapped all of Dumbledore's magic out of him, and wizards need magic to sustain life within themselves. Kind of like plants needing sunlight to perform photosynthesis. Within 10 minutes of the spell and Dumbledore's subsequent collapse, he was gone. Everyone missed him, even Snape I think.</p>
<p align="justify">Snape had become a much quieter man, now that he didn't have to worry about walking a very thin line. He taught Potions for a short period of time while the Ministry scrambled for a new Headmaster, and he had given only a tenth of the detentions he used to give and he praised more than just the Slytherins for getting things correct. Eventually, he got sick of the Ministry not being able to get their crap together and decided he would be Headmaster since Dumbledore had been training him for it in case Dumbledore should die suddenly. I backed Snape's decision, and no one at the Ministry questioned it. Life went back to normal and a new, <em>competent</em> Potions Master was found to teach the students.</p>
<p align="justify">Snape stood up from his chair and called out to the returning Eighth Years, "All of you will now follow me to your new dorms. On the bulletin board inside there is a list of dorm mates. There are only two to a room this year for how little of you returned. Roommates can be negotiated, but it is up to me to decide who is placed with who. I want no arguments from you if you don't like each other. If I hear of any fighting between any of you, those persons involved will be locked in a room together until the argument is figured out. Is this clear?"</p>
<p align="justify">Everyone nodded and muttered out a chorus of yes's and groans.</p>
<p align="justify">"Excellent. Follow me."</p>
<p align="justify">He walked out the side door the professors use, and took a left. We went down a set of stairs that seemed to have no bottom, until he stopped before a section of brick wall. He looked at all of us, and then turned around and tapped certain bricks in a complicated pattern. The bricks parted like they do for Diagon Alley, and he stepped in with the rest of us close behind.</p>
<p align="justify">He stopped in the middle of what appeared to be our common room and turned around to say, "If you don't like the decor, you are welcome to change it. Male rooms to the left; female rooms to the right. There are no magic stairs to keep you apart, but I shouldn't have to tell you all what an early pregnancy does to your chances of doing well and finishing school."</p>
<p align="justify">Most of my classmates paled and quickly muttered no's and we won't sir's.</p>
<p align="justify">"Then I bid you all good night and will see you at breakfast tomorrow." With that, he turned and stalked out of the room like he always does. We all turned and looked at each other, unsure of what to do, until Hermione walked up to the board and started listing the pairs on the list.</p>
<p align="justify">"Ronald Weasley-Blaise Zabini"</p>
<p align="justify">"Hermione Granger-Cho Chang"</p>
<p align="justify">"Pansy Parkinson-Padma Patil"</p>
<p align="justify">"Justin Finch-Fletchly-Theodore Nott"</p>
<p align="justify">"Draco Malfoy-Harry Potter"</p>
<p align="justify">My heart dropped to my stomach and all the blood in my head rushed to my feet. </p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>The Fates must hate me.</em>
