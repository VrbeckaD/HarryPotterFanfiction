    <p>Harry slid his hand into Draco's pants.</p><p>"Mmm... I think I know what that is... and --" Harry's hand brushed against something else, which seemed to be rough and moving sinuously. He jerked his hand back and nearly toppled over. "What the <em> fuck </em>was that?"</p><p>"Potter, what are you talking about?"</p><p>"I felt something... moving."</p><p>"Are you sure it wasn't my penis?" he answered with a grin.</p><p>"I was <em> holding your penis</em>. There's something else in your pants. What else is in your pants, Malfoy?"</p><p>"Why don't you take them off and find out?"</p><p>"I think I know better than to put my hand anywhere near your pants until you tell me exactly what is going on. What are you up to?"</p><p>"Come on, it won't bite. At least, it never has before."</p><p>"Enough!" Harry snatched his wand from the nightstand. <em>"Desartorio!"</em></p><p>Draco's pants and underwear were blasted across the room, crumpling against the opposite wall before settling into a small pile on the floor. Harry looked in astonishment at Malfoy's now-exposed crotch. "Do you have...two dicks?"</p><p>"Don't be stupid, Potter. I've got one dick, and I've also got a snake. I assumed you knew -- though maybe I should have known better than to assume you know anything."</p><p>The insult failed to register in Harry's brain as Draco strode toward him. Immediately next to Dacro's penis -- growing from practically the same spot -- was a snake, waggling in small side-to-side motions. It was about 6 or 7 inches long, Harry guessed.</p><p>"Okay," Harry said with a steeling breath, "why do you have an extra snake dick?"</p><p>"First, it's not a dick, it's just a snake. Second, that's a extremely rude question, isn't it? I may as well ask why you don't have one."</p><p>"I'm not sure that's really a fair comparison," Harry tried to interrupt.</p><p>"And thirdly, it's a traditional Malfoy trait. We're well-known and well-respected for our trouser snakes in well-bred society."</p><p>"Hold on, are you telling me that your dad has one of these, too?"</p><p>"I'm sorry, are we going talk about my father's anatomy, or are we going to have sex?"</p><p>Harry looked at the snake. He felt deeply uncertain about how to answer the question. The snake looked back.</p><p>"Okay, look, I want to have sex with you. I do. But do I need to, um, take care of the snake, too? How does that work, exactly?"</p><p>"Why would you need to take care of the snake? It has a cloaca."</p><p>"I mean, what should I do with it while I'm, you know, down there?" Harry found himself physically holding his head steady to keep it from swimming.</p><p>"Just let the snake mind its own business. It doesn't mind watching."</p><p>"You know what, this might just be easier to do and course-correct as we go. I came here to have sex, and I refuse to let this snake-dick get in the way. Let's do it."</p><p>"Finally. Merlin's balls, it took you long enough. Also: not a dick."</p><p>"Just a snake," he answered, getting into bed. "Got it."</p><p>Malfoy sighed -- partly in pleasure, partly in relief -- as Harry took his dick in his mouth and went to work. Giving fellatio was a new, strange experience, but he couldn't help wondering if it would be slightly less weird if he didn't have a nagging worry that the snake might bite his ear at any moment. It would be nerve wracking, Harry supposed, to have a snake nearly brushing his cheek under any circumstances, right?</p><p>"What are you doing down there?" Malfoy asked. "Show a bit more care, if you would."</p><p>Harry had to admit that the snake-induced discomfort was hurting his already novice performance. He tried sucking harder.</p><p>"That's better, though it isn't… mmm… all about the brute strength of suction, Potter. Don't be such a Gryffindor," he said. "Have some... ooh! ...subtlety."</p><p>Harry rallied, determined to impress. He tried using his tongue more, but wasn't sure the right way to do it. With Malfoy filling his mouth, there wasn't room to make the right movements. Malfoy seemed to enjoy some of it, but there was obviously something missing in his performance. He was about come off and ask for suggestions, when to his relief, he got one unprompted:</p><p>"Try... sssliding your lips…"</p><p>Harry did as he was told, rocking back and forth slowly, riding along Malfoy's length. The results were obvious at once. His pleasure built in speed and volume. By sliding away, Harry gave his tongue more room to work, intensifying Malfoy's reaction even more. By the time he was gripping the bed sheets, Harry knew he needed to be braced.</p><p>He came suddenly, and Harry's mouth was warm with semen. Harry stumbled off the bed in an involuntary lurch. Next to Malfoy's nightstand, he found tissues to spit into.</p><p>"Got it your first time? I'm impresssed."</p><p>Harry's chest swelled with pride at the compliment and he got to his feet. "Never thought I'd see the day that you'd admit you were impressed."</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Malfoy said with a soft sneer. He was still lying naked on his back, hands tucked under his head. The snake was resting contentedly on his thigh, looking directly at Harry. "Although I will say, not a bad first effort, Potter."</p><p>"But you just said..." Harry started. "You did say you were impressed. Right?"</p><p>"<em>Impressed</em>," Malfoy said, "is for when you make me moan loud enough to break the soundproof warding. Today was good. I'll keep you around. Hand me my pants?"</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. When he handed Draco his pants, the snake looked directly at him, flicked its tongue, and hissed, "Well, I had a good view, and I thought you did very well." Harry blinked in disbelief, but the snake only continued, "You know, he tries to sound so experienced, but he's only been with, oh, maybe four other people? Don't be intimidated."</p><p>Well, now Harry knew the truth: Draco Malfoy had a snake that grew out of his body, right next to his penis, and the snake could talk.</p><p>"Draco," said Harry, ignoring the snake. It felt rude, but he simply wasn't ready to direct any questions to the snake. "Your, um, trouser snake. It can… talk?"</p><p>"I keep telling you, it's just a snake. Stop worrying about it."</p><p>"Sorry, it's just… it's talking to me. I mean, right now. I think it's Parseltongue."</p><p>Draco ran a hand through his hair thoughtfully. "You mean it's literally talking to you? What's it saying?"</p><p>"Well, it just said, 'Put those pants on already. I'm cold-blooded and it's chilly in here.'"</p><p>"Prat," Draco said.</p><p>"Do you mean me or the snake?"</p><p>"The snake, Potter. I suppose I should known it'd be a saucy one." Fully dressed now, Draco stood and grabbed his bag. "Listen, I've got History in five minutes and I'm going to be late as it is. Don't let any of the Slytherins catch you on your way out, yeah? Be smart." He leaned in and gave Harry a kiss on the forehead and dashed out of the room.</p><p>Harry fell backward onto the bed and stared the ceiling for a long time. Eventually, the room stopped spinning.</p>
