    <p>It was a crisp fall wind that whipped Ginny’s copper hair in an untamed array around her face. It reminded her far too much of one of the lions before her, a thick golden male that licked his paw nonchalantly.</p>
<p>She pushed it behind her ears in an attempt to restrain its wild habits as she continued to shovel the day’s work.</p>
<p>The sky was a clear blue, a similar shade to the date’s anniversary of a mere two years before. It was the day she’d started this job, if one could call it that.</p>
<p>The circus was more of a lifestyle than a job.</p>
<p>Growing up with six older brothers had placed Ginny Weasley in an impenetrable shadow that hung thick above her for most of her life. She was fathered by a man who was mostly absent, attempting to feed the mouths of eight others on a government salary. Her mother, on the other hand, was an overbearing broad who’d wanted nothing more than a precious baby girl- Ginevra Molly Weasley. What she’d gotten, however, was Ginny- athletic, tomboy, and wildly inappropriate with a spirit and determination that could set the world on fire. To her mother’s disappointment, Ginny refused to be tied down by the ruffle of satin bows and dresses that trailed the floor. She wanted to run- to feel the wind sting her face without a petticoat tripping her ankles. And, ironically, that’s what she’d done.</p>
<p>Just after she turned sixteen, Ginny Weasley had decided she’d had enough. She would never have the ambition to be a Ministry official like her brother Percy, or the smarts to make it to Gringotts like Bill. Even Fred and George had somehow pleased the family name more than she had, and they’d dropped out of school to run their own shop.</p>
<p>It was her turn to be happy. To make her own choices. Even if they weren’t all that she’d thought they would be.</p>
<p>She paused her shoveling to glance up at the elephants, who clearly needed a bathing after last night’s rain. Mud was caked in brown rings around humongous legs and trunks that were clumsy and had no regard for the redhead’s labor.</p>
<p>After that it would be feeding time; carnivores first, then the elephants, and lastly the smaller animals that were available for the petting zoo.</p>
<p>And then, only then, would Ginny get fed. She rolled her eyes at the thought and continued to cleanse the circus grounds of dung.</p>
<p>It was two years ago that she’d packed her bag, a stocky, patchwork rucksack that contained all of the necessary supplies to live. She’d made a mental note of all the things she’d miss about the burrow; the open fields, the large oak trees, the sanctity of her room. And, with a silent goodbye, she let the screen door close behind her and entered a world covered by a starry night sky.</p>
<p>Life on foot was both liberating and extremely exhausting. Her humble life savings clanged against her shoulder, tucked safely away for the moment she would run out of pre-packed pb&amp;j’s.</p>
<p>She spent the few weeks before she’d laid eyes on the Cirque de la Vie as somewhat of a squatter, finding shelter in abandoned buildings and enjoying the hidden solitude.</p>
<p>The day she’d come across the large, red and white pin-striped tent was one that marked a forever change in Ginny’s life.</p>
<p>She’d entered the circus grounds cautiously, not a soul in sight as the sun hang at high noon. Empty carnival rides danced about the tent, swaying with the breeze. When she pulled back the corner of the tent, making a slow entrance into the unknown, she was met with an arena full of eyes. Beings that she would come to know and love and hate all at the same time.</p>
<p>“Who’s she?” A tall, elegant young man just slightly older than herself stood confidently, sporting an emerald cloak and a luxurious top hat. His platinum hair peeked from beneath the edges of black silk and blended into his pale complexion. A sneer was present upon his lips.</p>
<p>Beside him stood a boy just slightly shorter who wore a bemused expression beneath rounded spectacles. He was dressed much more casually but appeared by his stance to be somewhat close in relationship to the blonde. His raven black hair hung tousled over his forehead, messy and unkempt and it reminded Ginny of her own mane.</p>
<p>Across the group of individuals came an answer, barreled from a large man of muscular stature. His dark skin contrasted wildly against a stainless white suit. Ginny quickly realized he held leadership in some form.</p>
<p>“Indeed, Draco. Who are you?” His eyes bore into her unforgivingly, suspicious but rigidly composed.</p>
<p>“I...uh... I’m Ginny.” She took a moment to absorb the presence of each face around her. It appeared that she’d interrupted some form of meeting.</p>
<p>Most of the individuals seemed to be the same age or slightly older than herself. Across the arena was a mixture of curious and offended expressions, all wanting to know what the story was behind this new mystery girl.</p>
<p>“I’m a runaway.” She continued nervously. “I didn’t mean to interrupt, I just- I’ve been on my own for a while now, and something... something about your tent drew me in.”</p>
<p>She paused, suddenly wondering what the hell she was doing here. Clearly, she didn’t belong.<br/>The silence was deafening, and just as she pivoted to exit the arena, a voice cut through the tension.<br/>“My name is Kingsley Shacklebolt. I am the Ring Master of this circus and carnival debut.”</p>
<p>Ginny turned back to face the white-suited man, listening intently.</p>
<p>“We are more than just employees here at Cirque de la Vie. We are all strays in a sense, and we are family.” He directed his attention to the arena as a whole. “We have an opening for a new caretaker of the animals. Does anyone object to this ‘Ginny,’ joining our ranks?”</p>
<p>Ginny’s mouth dropped at such a proposition. Quiet rang throughout the tent as she studied the faces of each voter. Eventually, the raven haired boy shrugged. “I think she’d be a nice fit.” And he flashed her a smile.</p>
<p>That was the day she became a member of the traveling Cirque de la Vie.</p>
<p>She’d quickly come to know the faces behind the show. There was Pansy, a girl of short stature that was a positively brilliant Seer. She ran the caravan at the opening gate, providing fortunes and Tarot readings for all who were interested.</p>
<p>Outside of the main tent was a smaller marquee that encased a group of animated individuals known as the “freaks,” though according to Ginny, they were far from it.</p>
<p>Seamus was the “shortest man in the world,” standing just below five feet; his boyfriend (or so Ginny presumed) was the exact opposite at a roaring six foot eight. Neville had six fingers on one hand and eight on the other and was quite possibly the sweetest person she’d ever met. Millicent was quite rarely half male and half female, though she certainly preferred her womanly attributes. Ginny found them all to be quite endearing.</p>
<p>Hermione was in charge of overseeing set up and disassembly as well as managing the traveling caravans. She tended to keep to herself, an attribute Ginny could easily respect.</p>
<p>Oliver Wood was the lion tamer and essentially in charge of training all of the larger animals. Ginny was excited to work with him, even if she wasn’t allowed to get too close to his subjects. He played a huge part in putting on the performances that wowed the audience beyond belief.</p>
<p>There were the show girls, better known as “bally broads,” whose names were Lavender and Parvati. Ginny didn’t particularly care for them; their attitude and unwillingness to include those who were perceived to be “below them” disgusted her. Admittedly, they were graceful and beautiful and captivated the audience like no one else could, riding atop horses and performing aerial tricks that were dangerously gorgeous. Ginny was perhaps a bit jealous of their poise and importance to the show, though she refused to let it show.</p>
<p>Draco, as it turns out, was the arena’s talented magician. The messy haired boy, Harry, was his faithful assistant who one too many times had appeared to be sawed in half. Ginny always found herself giggling at the absolute slight of Draco’s magic and Harry’s over-the-top facial reactions.</p>
<p>She’d always watched fittingly from the sidelines, enjoying the enchantment of the circus performance. The lights, the jumps and twirls and impossibilities- they fascinated her.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter that her responsibilities as “caretaker” of the animals consisted mostly of cleaning up after them. She loved the circus; she loved her life.</p>
<p>&amp;&amp;&amp;</p>
<p>“Hey, Gin, I fed the goats, the camels, and the alpacas. So as soon as your best friends are cleaned, you should be good to get lunch.”</p>
<p>Ginny’s face brightened at the sound of Harry’s voice. They’d become somewhat close over the years, sharing brief stories of childhoods and secrets that lived within the confines of the circus. He’d developed somewhat of a hold over Ginny, protecting her like a little sister and helping her with her duties when the day seemed like too much.</p>
<p>“Did I ever tell you that you are my hero?” She flashed him a wink and grin, reveling in the weightlessness of her day becoming just a little bit better.</p>
<p>He returned the smile, giving her a quick peck on the cheek before retreating to his own tent.<br/>“We’ve got some new acts coming up!” He called over his shoulder. “Draco’s got us practicing like crazy.”</p>
<p>New acts? Now that sounded enlightening. Over time, the circus had grown dusty in Ginny’s heart. The lights had dulled, the performances become mundane. It would always hold a small spark, the same beauty that had drawn her there in the first place, but the fading glamour of this job and lifestyle was prevalent. She was, to put it quite simply, bored.</p>
<p>Shrugging to herself, she shoveled another scoop of dung. At least she was that much closer to a good meal.</p>
<p>&amp;&amp;&amp;</p>
<p>Ginny wasn’t sure what she was expecting for that night’s opening performance, but what she saw wasn’t it.</p>
<p>As promised, Draco and Harry were the flashy, innovative duo that had the audience gasping and roaring with cheers. The lions and tigers were accompanied by Wood through rings of fire and other ornate intricacies that kept observers on the edge of their seats. Pansy told a series of fortunes that miraculously came to be.</p>
<p>When Lavender and Parvati descended from ribbons of silk suspended from the tent’s ceiling, Ginny froze. Their expected elegance and grace was accompanied by something- someone- she’d never seen before. How could a new member of their tribe go so unbelievably unnoticed?</p>
<p>The third aerialist was by far the most alluring. Ginny felt her lips forming a circular “o” that was uncontrollably present. Her blonde curls were pinned away from her pale face and trailed in a loose fashion down her back. She was slim, slender. Elegant. Purely and unobtrusively beautiful.</p>
<p>Ginny’s eyes never faltered from the blonde as she spun and flipped and descended to ground level with a captivated audience. She landed gracefully upon the back of a white Appaloosa, balancing on the tip of her wooden ballet slippers. Ginny gaped; she was clearly a dancer. And a very talented one at that.</p>
<p>The crowd “oooh’d” and “ahhh’d” at the three Bally girls, but Ginny was stuck on one. Her eyes followed each swift movement that she had to offer, fingers splayed in motions that were characteristics of a prima ballerina.</p>
<p>Ginny had to know who this girl was. She wanted to learn everything about her. And perhaps the most puzzling element of it all was that she had no idea why.</p>
<p>When the lights dimmed at the end of the show, Ginny hurried out back to find her. She wasn’t exactly sure what she planned on saying, or even what her reasoning was for chasing her. It was just that something deep within her being told her that this girl was something special.</p>
<p>When she entered the smaller tent adjacent to the grand Cirque De La Vie arena, she was greeted by the other members’ celebration of the night’s success. They’d finished off with a standing ovation and even with several roses thrown in the direction of Kingsley’s bow. This was cause for drinks and other kinds of reward that hopped about the crowd fleetingly.</p>
<p>She pushed through the crowd, eyes peeled for toe-headed curls. When she spotted Lavender Brown sharing a drink casually with her partner, she intervened.</p>
<p>“Who was your third performer tonight?” She asked bluntly and was met by the glares of both showgirls.</p>
<p>“What’s it to you? You’re no Bally,” the copper-skinned Parvati Patil answered with a roll of her eyes.</p>
<p>“I was just... wondering. I’ve never seen you guys put on so well. The three of you are a great team.” Well, it was true... for one of them.</p>
<p>At this, Lavender’s face lit up. “I know! We were spectacular!” She flipped her hair and began to dive deep into details of their performance. Ginny sighed, determined to get a better answer from someone else.</p>
<p>After humoring the Bally girls, she continued her search proactively for any sign of the new addition to the show. Unfortunately, she was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Defeated, Ginny decided to ditch the celebratory party in lieu of her own small quarters near the animals. On the way out, she dodged an already sloshed Harry slinging his arm around Draco:  “You are just... so... funny!”</p>
<p>She smiled to herself as she exited. Whiskey or not, maybe those two would finally admit to what they so obviously kept hidden from each other. A twinge of both a warm appreciation and something else- jealousy, perhaps?- twisted in her gut. She shook the thought from her mind.</p>
<p>The sky was a dark indigo dotted by the bright white of a thousand stars. As she trailed farther from the bustle of the carnival and circus nightlife, each one seemed to pop with its own infinite supply of light. The knee-high grass tickled her legs, swaying with the cool evening breeze.</p>
<p>There was a magical air to the setting; there was something oddly settling of the utter silence on the pathway to the animals. It was contrasted by the muffled noises of the functioning carnival and the celebratory cues of the performers, and it made Ginny feel both utterly alone and alive simultaneously.</p>
<p>She could see the slow movements of the tigers up ahead, restlessly caged as they paced in the shadows. Almost to her destination, she froze abruptly as the soft jingle of a voice she’d never heard before broke the muted silence.</p>
<p>“Hey, you. I know you’re lonely. I’m lonely, too.”</p>
<p>Ginny cocked her head. The sound was soft and gentle and caring in tone. She’d never heard anything quite like it before.</p>
<p>She quickened her pace, heart racing at the prospect of who this voice could belong to. The moon hung high above, illuminating the path as she rushed toward the animals. A few meters ahead, and her eyes landed on a young girl, about her age, with long, flowing blonde curls.</p>
<p>It was her.</p>
<p>She was perched innocently next to a female lion’s cage, reaching her hand through silver bars to rub the feline’s head. The way she seemed to connect with the lioness was phenomenal; the usually territorial animal was tame and tranquil. It purred relaxedly as the mysterious girl continued to massage the space between its ears.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen her so calm before.” Ginny stated softly as she took a seat next to Ms. Enchanting.</p>
<p>The blonde’s pale cheeks turned a rosy red that Ginny noticed immediately despite the pale moon glow.</p>
<p>“I’ve always had a place in my heart for animals. It’s one of the reasons I decided to stay here.”</p>
<p>Ginny studied her intently, intrigued. After a brief silence, the wind seemed to pick up and rustled strands of blonde hair in her direction. The scent of each strawberry curl was fresh and reminded Ginny of the lilies that grew in the fields behind the Burrow. She was immediately reminded of something whole and free.</p>
<p>“Your performance was amazing tonight. How long have you been a dancer?”</p>
<p>“Most of my life. My mother was a dancer. When she died, I followed in her footsteps.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that. I’m sure she was a lovely person.”</p>
<p>Her lips turned up at the edges, reminiscent. Ginny’s heart did a subtle flip.</p>
<p>“She was. She loved the animals, too.” She continued to gaze at the lioness, petting her lightly. Her smile widened as the cat licked her hand.</p>
<p>“What about your father?” She wasn’t sure why she felt so oddly comfortable around this girl, like she’d met her in a past life.</p>
<p>Her smile faded, but only briefly.</p>
<p>“My father said I was my mother’s twin. I think that’s why he pushed me away after she passed.”</p>
<p>Ginny paused, contemplating her response.</p>
<p>“How long have you been on your own?”</p>
<p>“Two years.”</p>
<p>“Me, too.”</p>
<p>“I’m Luna.” She tore her gaze from the lioness and shifted it blazingly toward Ginny’s.</p>
<p>Her eyes were a beautiful crystal blue; an infinite sky that held everything Ginny wanted to discover. They reflected brightly against Ginny’s own brown irises, a deep and contemplative match that held regardless of the silence.</p>
<p>It was an eternity, or so it seemed, before Ginny realized she hadn’t answered.</p>
<p>“Ginny. I’m... Ginny.” There was something so enchanting about Luna’s stare; it held her own even more beautifully than her earlier performance.</p>
<p>Ginny could feel her cheeks flushing, freckles blending into an embarrassing shade of pink. She hoped that the moonlight wouldn’t give her away.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you, Ginny. You’re the most genuine person I’ve met so far.”</p>
<p>“Here, at the circus?”</p>
<p>“Ever.”</p>
<p>There was another silence, and Ginny was sure her face was as red as the stripes on the arena tent behind them.</p>
<p>“Fireflies.” Ginny was snapped from her trance as Luna pointed a finger softly upward. Sure enough, there were several of the glowing insects flitting about above their heads. Illuminating Luna’s face and smile softly.</p>
<p>And that smile, it was so pure and holy and Ginny couldn’t put her finger on exactly why it had her stomach somersaulting. She’d never seen someone so amazed by something so simple.</p>
<p>“They’re beautiful,” Luna continued, face positively aglow.</p>
<p>“So are you,” Ginny slipped, and regret immediately flushed her insides. Stomach sinking, she shifted her gaze to her sneakers and began picking at a few blades of grass nervously.</p>
<p>To Ginny, the air felt suffocatingly thick. But the only reaction from the blonde was a subtle twitch of her lips as she leaned toward the curtain of copper hair hanging between them.</p>
<p>She lifted a delicate hand and brushed it behind Ginny’s ear, revealing a set of blushed cheeks and a soft gasp at the sudden contact.</p>
<p>Giggling at Ginny’s reaction, Luna lightheartedly tilted forward and pressed a soft peck to her cheek.</p>
<p>It was sudden, but there was no mistaking it. The butterflies that rushed throughout every part of her being had Ginny’s head swimming. </p>
<p>Luna’s innocent laugh was a wind-chime in the summer breeze; a carol during Christmas. It was the most beautiful sound Ginny had ever heard. When she pulled back and began gazing at the stars, lips pulled into a fascinated smile, Ginny couldn’t help but grin and gaze with her.</p>
