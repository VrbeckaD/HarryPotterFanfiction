    <p>
  <span>The girl was blonde with blue eyes. When she laughed, it was warm and rich, like sunshine, and whenever she laughed and tossed her hair in the sun, any who laid eyes on her would fall in love instantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl led a pretty normal life until age eleven. Sure, weird things would happen when she was upset or angry, which led to the other kids ostracizing and bullying her, but there was something even weirder about the girl, which almost made up for such things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A vision of a beautiful woman, dark where she was fair, but full of such love that she could never fear her, and a warm glow in the girl’s chest when she had these visions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They never failed to keep her calm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The owl arrived. With it, came explanations that the whole family was relieved to read.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl happily went through the Leaky Cauldron, sure that now, everything would be alright. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While she happily chatted, she missed the strange looks given to her by the shopkeepers and others in Diagon Alley. Looks largely of derision from the Purebloods, and disbelief from the other children, most of whom either looked bored or unhappy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the wand shop was when the girl got her first taste of what was to come. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, a Muggleborn.” The strange pale man, apparently Olivander had said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tough customer? Not to worry, we’ll find the right- ah!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl found her wand eventually. Yew, dragon heartstring and thestral hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Such a powerful wand normally seeks out a powerful witch… curious, then that you are so weak a witch…” Ollivander seemed to shake off some bad feeling and demanded eleven sickles from the girl, who had insisted, thankfully, that a wand was something she could shop for alone. A fact for which she was grateful, as she now handed the wizard monies over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her parents chatted happily in the sun, as the family had stopped for ice cream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl now noticed the odd looks she was attracting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She resolved to ask Florescue about it as she took the tip to a small jar to the counter of the shop. When she did, Florescue explained the difference between Purebloods, half bloods, and Muggleborns. He frowned as he explained that the first had prejudices against the other two. He also told her the disadvantage society had given her by discriminating against her blood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he winked. “But you’re a fighter. I can sense it. And you’ve earned an extra ice cream, on the house.” He handed over a strawberry chocolate ice cream, but then caught the girl’s arm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fellow seer, I will not pretend your path will be easy, but never be afraid to fight for what you want.” Then his face cleared. “Go on, enjoy your ice cream with your parents.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But the shadow returned as the girl skipped back to her parents.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Be well, little seer.” He intoned, hoping to ease her suffering some, before turning to the next customer in line.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl saw his face again in her dreams that night, along with his blessing. She smiled as she awoke, knowing that someone was on her side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her parents had started acting oddly the day before. They were, not harsh, just… more firm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was odd, but she put it out of her mind as she sat in an unused compartment, having gotten to the train early at her parent’s insistence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had decided to read as much as possible, Florescue’s warning-blessing ringing in her ears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She gathered with the other first years after the train ride. After they got in the boats, she thought she saw something twisting in the lake below. She shuddered, the resolved to ignore it… for now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She saw an enormous castle looming in front and gasped along with her yearmates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She nervously straightened herself up, under the gaze of a stern professor, along with her yearmates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She walked in line to the Sorting Hat with her yearmates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She clapped along after the hat’s song, along with her yearmates, sharing their relief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, it came time for her turn under the hat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she heard the voice, she startled, almost crying out, but the voice stopped her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When asked, almost rhetorically, where she should be placed, she asked timidly about the woman in her visions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How can I come to see her in person?” She asked the hat, “Do you know who she is?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The experienced, tattered hat seemed to hesitate. “I know her. She once sat here, in this very hall. Your path to her will not be easy. Do you still wish to see her, little seer?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The question seemed just like what Florescue had told her, but the allure of finding this woman was too great to ignore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want to see her.” The girl said mentally.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very well. I will tell this to you in good faith. Not all is as it seems, and the woman from your visions is one Bellatrix Lestrange. I will put you in a house that will help you find out who your real friends are: Slytherin. But know this, little serpent-seer, I wish you luck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“SLYTHERIN!” THe hat boomed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After the other children were sorted, there had been thunderous applause. It made the current silence all the more deafening, as she moved to her chosen house, only to find that she was summarily ignored, and her housemates shifted as far away from her as possible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What had she done?</span>
