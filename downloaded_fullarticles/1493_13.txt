    <p>Dan was having a crisis. It had to be some kind of warning sign- running into Phil at King's Cross Station and being rendered so totally speechless. Normally, Dan spent the majority of his summer holidays with Phil and his family (his parents never protested, and Dan often wondered if they would even notice if one holiday he just never came back from Phil's house. Phil's answer was always 'of course they would, silly' but there were many nights Dan lay awake and dreamt about graduating from Hogwarts and moving in with Phil. Just two best friends rooming together.) That particular summer, however, his parents had taken him to stay with his grandparents, which he had enjoyed, but he'd really missed Phil. Anyways, he had run into Phil at the station- well, into Phil's back, really- and as Phil turned around, he physically felt his heart drop into his dirty red trainers. <br/>
Dan had realised he was gay in Third Year, and it wasn't like he'd seen a particularly cute boy and felt everything click into place at once, easy-peasy. It had been bothering him for weeks, until one day, he and Phil were studying, and Dan was acting snappy and irritable because he hadn't been able to sleep with how much he was stressing about this. When Phil tried to find out what was wrong, Dan had blown up at him, and said some things to Phil that he still hadn't forgiven himself for. Dan would never forget the way Phil's eyes had filled with tears, and he had frantically apologised, and Phil had told him it was alright, but avoided Dan like the plague for the rest of the week, until Dan dragged him into a closet after class one day and just broke down. Phil had held him, and told him it was going to be alright. He had managed to stop crying long enough to tell Phil he was gay, and watched as Phil stared at him, unable to think of anything to say. Eventually though, he told Dan that it didn't change anything, and then he called Dan an idiot for thinking he would judge him for it, and Dan cried even harder. Since then, he hadn't actually taken the time to notice any boys, as he kept himself quite busy with his schoolwork. Until today. Because holy shit, in the two and a half months they had been away from each other, Phil had gotten hot. Like, <em>really </em>hot. Phil's face broke into a huge smile that damn near took Dan's breath away. <br/>
"Dan! I missed you!" <br/>
Oh god. <br/>
"Your voice," Dan croaked. Phil frowned. <br/>
"What about it?" He asked, and Dan quickly snapped out of his brief gay panic session. <br/>
"Nothing," he said, trying to sound more casual than he actually felt. "It's just deeper." And rougher. And huskier. Fuck. <br/>
Phil stared at him for a second before giving an undignified snort and pushing Dan lightly. <br/>
"Okay, whatever." He took a step back, and raked his eyes up and down Dan's figure. Dan turned bright pink under his gaze, and managed to squeak out a pathetic, "what are you doing?" <br/>
Phil looked up to meet Dan's eyes. <br/>
"You've changed too! Not your voice, but you're definitely a bit taller. And your hair is a darker shade of brown- and it's longer! Wait, are you trying to grow a mullet or something?" <br/>
"I beg your pardon, of course not. What exactly do you take me for? And... I missed you too, by the way."<br/>
Yeah- that entire exchange should have been some kind of signal that Dan was truly, deeply fucked. They clambered into one of the carriages, Phil keeping up an endless stream of chatter, which was just fine with Dan- he was able to sit back and just listen; he was immeasurably grateful when PJ and Chris burst in, yelling out hellos and their own stories about their holidays. He felt a little less grateful when PJ nudged him and murmured, <br/>
"Can't believe you haven't broken into hives or anything."<br/>
"What do you mean?" he scowled. <br/>
"I <em>mean, </em>look at him! You have to have had a gay crisis of some sort by now." <br/>
Dan rolled his eyes. He was out to PJ and Chris, but he had managed to relate it to them less dramatically than he had to Phil. They didn't care either, but it was only recently that PJ had started remembering how Dan acted around Phil; how he still acted around Phil, really. His inability to say more than ten words at a time to Phil was probably giving him the totally wrong idea. Because whatever PJ was implying was wrong. He didn't have a crush. In fact, it was kind of the opposite, he told himself. He didn't even really like Phil that much. He always stole Dan's secret chocolate frog stash, and never even bothered to learn the quidditch rules (though he seemed perfectly content listening to Dan ramble on about it). <br/>
"Whatever it is you're implying, get it out of your head right now," he hissed to PJ. "This is an important year for us, Fourth Year is when we take our NEWTS, and I need to focus- I don't need you to be running your mouth about this all the time when I'm trying to study, got it?" <br/>
"Uhh..." <br/>
Dan flushed and turned to see Chris and Phil, sitting opposite to them, looking confused. <br/>
"What's PJ running his mouth off about?" Phil asked, sounding amused. <br/>
"What isn't he?" Dan muttered, slumping further into his seat. The answer seemed to satisfy Chris, who turned away and continued whatever story he was telling to PJ. Phil looked at Dan quizzically for a few more minutes, before re-joining the conversation. Dan continued to sulk for a bit, before deciding to drop it, and entered the conversation too.<br/>
By the time they reached Hogwarts, he was almost giddy with excitement- he really did enjoy going back to school, a sentence he didn't think he'd be able to say four years ago, when he was still in muggle school. Phil was always asking him about it, and seemed a little disappointed when Dan told him it was literal hell on earth. Phil was a halfblood, but had never been to muggle school, and he had been raised almost as a pureblood. Dan, being a muggleborn, was amazed at Phil's house, which seemed to practically function on magic, unlike his own house.<br/>
The four of them laughed and talked at the tops of their voices throughout the ride and til they reached the Grand Hall, where they reluctantly parted ways. Phil was immediately immersed in conversation with all the other Hufflepuffs. Dan shook his head with a slight smile, marvelling at his friend's ability to make friends with anyone and everyone. He and PJ made their way to the Gryffindor table, and Chris bounded off to the Ravenclaw table. The sorting passed, and Dumbledore gave his standard speech- he stared at PJ as he reminded students that the Forbidden Forest was, in fact, forbidden.<br/>
Dan couldn't help laughing, but stopped as Professor McGonagall stood up and announced that students were required to stay in the dorms of their own houses, glaring at Dan, then sweeping her gaze to the Hufflepuff table and looking at Phil. They both turned a little red, and looked down, suddenly finding their shoes very interesting. They weren't the only students who snuck into each other's dorms for sleepovers, but they definitely did it the most- Phil's dorm mates and Dan were fairly well-acquainted by now. PJ snickered, and Dan stepped on his foot under the table.<br/>
Once the feast appeared though, neither of them could be bothered to continue their bickering. There was a brief silence as everyone ate, before the talking resumed, and Dan, in a better mood, apologised to PJ, and they went back to talking about everything and anything that came to mind. The meal ended and though Dan and PJ had both resolved to stay awake for as long as possible on their first night back, Dan felt a sudden wave of exhaustion rush over him, and PJ covered his mouth to stifle a yawn. The students all trooped off to their dormitories, and Dan and Phil bumped into each other, and only managed to say goodnight before the crowd separated them.<br/>
They went in different directions, but Dan couldn't help but look back, only to find Phil already staring. He went red, and Phil gave him a slightly sheepish smile before turning away.<br/>
And it turned out that Dan stuck to his and PJ's agreement- though he had never felt more tired, he found himself completely and totally unable to fall asleep, Phil's stupid multi-colour eyes and his stupid messy hair and his stupid, stupid smile running around his head. He sighed, and turned over in bed for about the twentieth time that night. It was going to be a long year. </p>
