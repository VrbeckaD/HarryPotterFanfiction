    <p>I began writing the works of this series in 2015. That April,a friend and I had a mental exercise as to ‘what if James and Lily Potter had lived’. This is the result of that.</p><p>This series is inspired by AidanChase’s <strong>Everybody Lives AU</strong> and Animegirl300’s putative <strong>Lionheart</strong> series, and I owe my inspiration to both of these wonderful authors. It involves five narrative arcs. The first involves the Marauders Era. The second is the first war against Voldemort. The third is Harry’s childhood. The fourth is Harry’s time at Hogwarts. And the fifth and final arc is the next generation. The story titles will be listed in the overall series description.</p><p>This series is also being posted on Wattpad and Alternate History,but this is the definitive edition. There will be worldbuilding,and the effects of PODs (Points of Divergence) will be explored.</p><p>By arc,the PODs are:</p><p>Arc 1</p><ul>
<li>Snape and the Marauders are in more of a ‘friendly rivalry’</li>
</ul><p>Arc 2</p><ul>
<li>Regulus,Peter,and Severus pretend to become Death Eaters:they are really double agents,spying on the DEs for the Order of the Phoenix</li>
<li>Regulus doesn’t die at the Horcrux cave</li>
<li>Fabian and Gideon Prewett successfully evade the Death Eaters sent to kill them</li>
<li>In a similar vein,Caradoc Dearborn and Marlene McKinnon don’t die. They get married after the war.</li>
<li>Benjy Fenwick also lives</li>
<li>When Voldemort comes to Godric’s Hollow, Peter AKs him while James duels with some Death Eaters. Thus,James and Lily live in addition to Harry. Peter loses some of his magic,and Harry is still marked by Voldemort.</li>
<li>At the same time,Aurors rescue Frank and Alice Longbottom just as they are starting to be Crucioed. Rabastan and Rodolphus are killed, Bellatrix and Barty Jr still go to Azkaban.</li>
</ul><p>Arc 3</p><ul>

<li>During the time travel to stop Buckbeak’s execution, Remus has Macnair sent through the Veil</li>
