  <em> Red </em>
</p><p> </p><p>His hair, his wonderful wonderful hair. That’s what the color would always remind him of. The hair of his last love, Louis Weasley.</p><p>The way that he had grown it out while they were together. It usually was held back in a ponytail, but fell over his shoulders whenever he grew really focused, because he would pull at it in frustration.</p><p>The way it tingled in his face when they were lying in bed on early mornings, Louis propped up on his elbows and moving his finger over Jeremy’s naked torso.</p><p>Those had been nice times and Jeremy wished he could return to them.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> White </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Many people said that white wasn’t even a colour, but they were wrong.</p><p>White was a colour, and it was a cruel, unforgiving one.</p><p>It was the colour of the snow that ended his life.</p><p>Jeremy had stumbled into a mess of an epic calibre completely by accident. He had been in Diagon Alley and he had noticed that he was still missing a present for his mother’s birthday a day later, so he had stumbled into the first shop he could find — his mother was a Muggle, anything magical would excite her.</p><p>He didn’t even get a chance to see what was going on before he was stunned.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Blue </em>
</p><p> </p><p>When Jeremy opened his eyes again, his hands are already freezing and blue. There was no doubt that they were going to turn black in no time, nor was there any chance that the rest of his body looked any differently.</p><p>All he could see was snow and ice.</p><p>He tried to reach for his wand, but even if it was there, he was too frozen to move.</p><p>This would be the death of him, no matter what he tried.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Black </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The last thing he would ever see.</p>
