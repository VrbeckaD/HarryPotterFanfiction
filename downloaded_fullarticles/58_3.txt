  <b>Chapter 1 - Being Crammed Into Tiny Corners</b>
</p><p>
  <em> Severus Snape  </em>
</p><p>“What don’t you understand about what you have to do?” The voice sounded like a ringing in his ear. </p><p>Severus Snape was talking, well, being ordered by Lord Voldemort himself. He had just received a mission, one which could change the course of the war in favour of the Dark Lord.</p><p>“But why would you choose me? Peter Pettigrew would be a much better choice. He was friends with him after all.” He responded, disgust laced in his voice for even having to think that Pettigrew was better at something than himself.</p><p>Not that he didn’t want the second chance, but Severus wanted what was best for the cause, even if that meant that he could never see his sweet Lily’s face again. He resented that Harry Potter didn’t die in her place. He resented that it was his fault, even though he didn’t want to admit it, that Lily died. He wished he could touch her soft hands and look into those bright emerald eyes again. </p><p>Lord Voldemort looked at him seriously, “Pettigrew is too unstable. He still wants to fight for the other side. If we told him that his mother was already dead by now, he probably would try to go back which would be troublesome for us.”</p><p>Severus snorted, he had a role in that situation himself, though Voldemort’s eyes made his expression serious again.</p><p>“You will go back to befriend James Potter. You will also make sure that he never gets in a relationship with Lily Evans and in turn, has Harry Potter with her. This will ensure my, our victory in the war.” Lord Voldemort explained again.</p><p>“Yes, sir.” Snape replied. </p><p>Voldemort had already explained his way of time travel thoroughly. He had kept a different type of time turner, with blue rings and a red centre. This time turner was called a time melder and it would have you keep your mind and memories, but let you travel to your old body. This way he’d blend in with the other students, and be able to be as unsuspicious as possible. He’d be brought back to his first year so he’d have the longest time to become friends with Potter and company. </p><p>Snape was supplied with the time turner, and he turned it. He had to really think about the time that he wanted to go to, but suddenly his mind turned to the start of the third year.</p><p>He was sat on the train with Lily when Potter stumbled in and was trying to flirt with Lily. This was the first flirtatious attempt of many and like always, Lily brushed it off with a “Bugger off, Potter.” She smiled as she threw another insult. “Go sit with your boyfriend Black or something.” </p><p>Suddenly though, Severus was sitting on the train and it was his third year now. The time turner no longer in his hand since he’d left it in the future. He sat with a book in his hands,</p><p>‘<em> Shit. </em> ’ He thought to himself, ‘ <em> This wasn’t supposed to happen. </em>’ </p><p>He then looked up from his book at Potter who was still standing over Lily and Black came running in. “I heard my last name, what’s going on?” </p><p>Potter sat down next to Lily and smirked. “You’re my boyfriend now I guess Sirius, and we’ll be sitting here.”</p><p>Black looked at Potter in disgust and said, “Eww. Gross. Me, your boyfriend? In your dreams.” Then he turned to look at Severus and the disgust grew even more, “And are you sure you want to sit with Snivellus in the same room?” </p><p>Potter smirked again, “Well, I won’t be the one sitting next to him.” He then pointed at the seat next to Severus. “You’ll sit there, won’t you, Honey?” </p><p>Black’s face said all that was needed to be said. “Only because it’s you James, and stop saying that I’m your boyfriend. I don’t know about you, but I sure as hell ain’t gay!” </p><p>Black sounded disgusted by the idea of himself being gay. Severus had forgotten how prejudiced the world was about minorities. ‘<em> Well, </em> ’ He thought as he looked at Lily. ‘ <em> We still have a long way to go. </em>’</p><p>‘<em> No! </em> ’ His mind screamed at itself. ‘ <em> You came here with a mission. Complete it. </em>’</p><p>Black then sat down next to Severus. Well, next is a bit far-fetched. He tried to keep to the wall as much as possible. Severus then turned his gaze to Lily, she was practically being assaulted with ‘the greatest.’ pick-up lines from Potter, but Severus knew that the red-head would be fine. She’s very fierce. </p><p>Lupin then peeped his head around the corner into the compartment. “There you guys are! Pete and I were looking for you. We had to check every compartment until now.” </p><p>Severus felt disgusted as he heard Pettigrew’s name. The reason for his disgust was one of the only times that Potter had helped him out though. His disgust grew only more when he saw the actual blonde’s face. It was fat and he didn’t know how, but he fit in between Black and himself. Lupin dropped down next to Potter in the corner and gave Severus a friendly nod which he returned.</p><p>While we're on the topic of Potter helping Severus. That’s right. Lupin is a bloody werewolf and the way he found out wasn't that great. How didn’t Severus notice before when he came in? How could he have forgotten that horrible incident? </p><p>It probably helped that he was being crushed by a human being of which he was disgusted. Wait. He was in his third year. In about seven months he’d be… </p><p>Severus shivered at the thought of what happened in his third year. Well, he couldn’t actually remember it. Madam Pomfrey had explained it to him afterwards. It was probably a way of his body protecting itself. </p><p>She had explained that he was found by Potter in his dorm with Pettigrew standing over him. Potter had said to her that Severus was almost naked, only his underwear was on and that he was looking terrified. Potter hit Pettigrew and carried Severus to the hospital wing. Severus had fallen asleep soon after.</p><p>He suddenly was awakened by his daze when Pettigrew and Black switched places. ‘<em> Why is he doing that? He was just going on about how he hated me and was disgusted by me. </em>’</p><p>Severus shifted uncomfortably and tried to continue reading in his book. Although it was a bit uncomfortable that Black was sitting so close to him due to Pettigrew pushing him closer, after a while, he eased into the touch and wasn’t sitting so tensely anymore.</p><p>The train ride went quite smooth after that, though he could still hear the ringing of Potter’s voice saying endless pick-up lines in the back of his mind. </p><p>Onto becoming that bastard’s friend.</p>
