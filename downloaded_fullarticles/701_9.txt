    <p>Hermione Granger walked through the corridor, sniffing quietly and sipping from her goblet of water. The witch was trying desperately to find her boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend. She would fix that, though. The witch was sure that if she only apologized for being overly sensitive, everything could go back to normal.</p><p>“Ah!” The slapping sounds of flesh and the scent of damp sweat hung in the air. “Oh… Merlin!” Heavy, familiar grunts followed. The witch hesitated for only a fraction of a second, before turning the corner to face the fornicating couple. Hermione’s mouth dropped open in shock and the goblet fell from her fingers. Both Ron Weasley, and the girl his cock was buried inside, turned in surprise as the goblet skittered across the stone floor. A horrible incident of timing, the wizard turned just as he climaxed, ejaculating clumsily all over the girl’s backside and the floor. Hermione's stomach churned and she threw the pair a disgusted look before turning back the direction she had come from.</p><p>“Hermione, wait!” Ron called out. The Head Girl did not turn back, only quickened her pace, as Ron raced to catch her, his flaccid member flopping about and he tried to adjust his twisted robes. Ron’s trousers around his ankles caused him to stumble, just as the witch turned back to face him.</p><p>“You know what’s funny about this?” Hermione spit bitterly, trying to swallow her tears back. “I was actually coming to apologize to you! Fucking apologize! We truly are through, Ronald. And right now, I honestly don’t want to see you ever again!” The witch whirled about and fled, wiping away the tears that had begun to fall…</p><p>Three hours later, Hermione rushed up the stairs to the fifth floor, leaning over and trying to catch her breath. She hadn’t expected the night to proceed the way it had. Needing to get away, she ran as fast as her legs could carry her, not stopping until she reached the edge of the Black Lake. Even being Head Girl, Hermione knew she shouldn’t have been outside, alone, especially not after dark. Still, it seemed like the only place she could be completely alone. She walked along the shore for a while, only realizing how far she had gone when she looked up at the castle and no longer saw flickering lights. The witch snuck up through the grounds, only starting to run when she had made it back inside the castle walls. With no prefect duties as an excuse, she did not want to be caught wandering the corridors so late. As she rounded the corner to catch the next flight of stairs, Hermione bumped into a tall, dark, and unyielding object, letting out a huff as she landed on her backside,</p><p>“I’m sorry, I-“Hermione glanced up and froze as Lucius Malfoy stared down at her. Regardless of the fact that he had been granted amnesty from the ministry and had somehow taken over Defense Against The Dark Arts, Hermione‘s stomach still twisted every time she laid eyes on him.</p><p>“Miss Granger, please refrain from barreling into people in the hallways. While a few years ago, you smashing your head open on the stone floor would be very pleasing to see, it is my job as your professor to ensure your safety. What are you doing out of bed at this hour?” Hermione gaped at him, practically shaking with anger. The nerve of him!</p><p>“Just because the ministry let you off with a slap on the wrist doesn’t mean I will answer to you, Malfoy,” she spat. “Snape vouching for you means nothing. The fact that McGonagall even hired you here shames Hogwarts.” Hermione watched as the anger flared in his eyes and she knew she had hit a nerve.</p><p>“Why you disrespectful little chit...” Before she could react, he grabbed her by her hair, pulling her face upward to look at him. “How dare you speak to your elder, your better that way?” It took all of Hermione‘s self-control not to spit in his face. She could very well face expulsion if she made a wrong move; instead, her voice became impassive.</p><p>“You’re hurting me... Sir.” He blinked down at her, surprised by her sudden submission. Lucius didn’t know what made him do it, but looking down into those wide brown eyes, something inside him needed to claim her. Hermione was taken completely by surprise as Lucius Malfoy’s lips crashed down on hers. The head girl couldn’t explain it, but as the wizard’s lips met hers, instinct overthrew rational thought. Her hands slid up and around his shoulders, gripping the neck of his robes and pulling him closer. Lucius let his hands follow the flow of her silk dress, cupping her bum. When Hermione let out a soft moan, he took advantage of the opening, pushing his tongue into her mouth. Her eyes remained closed as Hermione basked in the feelings of the moment. Lucius tasted like chamomile and honey, and she allowed him to explore her mouth fully. Only when his hand slid up, brushing her breasts gently, and she felt her nipples harden in response, only then did the reality of what was happening come crashing down on her. Suddenly, she wrenched herself from his grasp, breathing heavily, her eyes wild.</p><p>“You bastard!” she yelled angrily, wiping her mouth. It was like deja vu, Hermione’s anger took over, and she struck him as hard as she could. Later, it would seem funny to her that she had now hit both of the Malfoy men. “You disgust me, I hate you!” She spat, before spinning on her heels and rushing up to Gryffindor tower. Lucius let out a heavy sigh, leaning against the wall as she disappeared.</p><p> </p><p align="center">****************************************************************************************************************************************</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that went well.” a cold, smooth voice came from the shadows. Lucius Malfoy whipped around, only to come face to face with Severus Snape.</p><p>“Ah, Severus.”</p><p>“That was foolish, Lucius. For Merlin’s sake, there’s plenty of other witches who would throw themselves at you, but you go for Hermione fucking Granger? She hates the lot of us, you know.”</p><p>“She doesn’t hate you, my friend.” Snape rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I’m aware. The world thinks I’m some fucking war hero. How on earth do I explain I’m just a vindictive bastard with selfish motives?” Lucius grinned and the two walked off together, both ready for a drink.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*******************************************************************************************************************************************************</p><p> </p><p>Hermione arrived in her common room, dizzy, out of breath, and in a panic. She felt sick to her stomach that she let Lucius Malfoy put his hands on her. She felt cheap and dirty. The witch slowly climbed the stairs to her bedroom. That was the best thing about being Head Girl, having her own bedroom. Wrenching off the dress, and pulling off her heels, she fell into her bed, exhausted.</p><p>Hermione woke feeling her pelvic muscles spasming, her knickers soaked, and her head spinning. Never before had she come in her sleep. Despite everyone’s whispers and suspicions, Hermione wasn’t a total prude. She and Ron had been intimate, more than a few times, but it had never been intense, and she had always had to work to get herself off with him. It wasn’t simply the fact that she had an orgasm in her sleep that was bothering her, it was the person she was dreaming of as she came. His mercury eyes haunted her as her guilt and loathing kicked in, and she ran to the bathroom, dry heaving.</p><p>Hermione took her time getting dressed before heading to breakfast. It was Sunday, so she had no classes, but the witch was determined to find some way to keep her mind busy. Hermione took her usual seat, across from Harry and Ginny, Ron nowhere in sight, helping herself to some eggs and toast.</p><p>“Where is he?” She asked softly. Harry shrugged and shook his head. Truthfully, Hermione had no appetite. She mostly pushed the eggs around her plate, occasionally pecking at her toast. At one point, she glanced up at the head table, only to be greeted by piercing, silver eyes. The witch stiffened and looked away quickly, trying not to blush. After that, the Head Girl quickly left the Great Hall, and headed outside for some much-needed air.</p><p>“Hey, Granger!” A voice called, and Hermione couldn’t help but be annoyed. Why was is that when she wanted to be left alone, suddenly everyone wanted to bother her?</p><p>“Yes, Draco?” She huffed as he caught up with her, barely hiding her irritation. The witch really had no reason to be cross with him. Draco Malfoy had been nothing but polite since his return to Hogwarts. His presence, at that moment, however, only served to remind her of the night before.</p><p>“So... That essay for Defense...” Draco began awkwardly. Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p>“What about it?” She asked. He gave her that awkward grin she was beginning to like and she couldn’t help but smile. It was a strange feeling, but after all those years of bad blood, she was actually starting to feel like she and Draco could be friends.<br/>
`<br/>
“Will you work on it with me?” The wizard asked politely. Hermione gave another huff, “Please? You and I are the best students in the class. If we both swap ideas together, we’re sure to get top marks! Come on, Granger. Don’t make me beg.” She put her hands on her hips and gave him an expectant look, raising a brow. He sighed. “Alright! Pretty please, Hermione?” She threw her head back and laughed.</p><p>“Alright, alright. I’ll work on it with you.” She finally conceded. The grin she received made her chuckle again. “Library, seven o’clock. Don’t be late.” He gave her a wink and then headed back up to the castle. They did meet at the library, and the pair actually worked well together on their essay. Hermione was surprised to find that Draco had many of the same ideas about the subject.</p><p>For nearly three weeks, Hermione’s days passed quite the same. She avoided eye contact with her blonde professor, who seemed to have forgotten about the whole incident. She studied with the boys, Ron had apologized but things were still awkward and Hermione was still angry. She occasionally spent time with Ginny and met twice each week with Draco to work on their essay. Things seemed to be back to normal. Until the class got their graded essays back. Hermione sat motionless, staring blankly at her paper as Draco talked excitedly behind her.</p><p>“See, Granger? I told you us working together would get us top marks!” Hermione nodded, hiding her paper as she glanced at Draco’s perfect grade. She said nothing, but her blood began to boil. The pair essentially handed in the same paper, Draco had gotten an Outstanding, while Hermione was given an Acceptable. The witch left with her friends, but her anger quickly got the better of her.</p><p>“Guys, I forgot something, I’ll be right back.” Harry shrugged, but Ron turned.</p><p>“Want me to come with?” Hermione shook her head.</p><p>“That’s okay, Ron. You guys go ahead, I’ll catch up.” By the time she reached the classroom, it was empty, but Hermione was sure Lucius Malfoy was in his office. She quietly closed the classroom door behind her, and marched towards his office, determined to change her grade. She shoved the door open, yet he did not even bother to acknowledge her presence.</p><p>“What the bloody hell is this?” She shouted, tossing her paper on his desk.</p><p>“Language.” Lucius replied smoothly, still not looking up. “It appears to be your essay, Miss Granger.” His bored tone and careless attitude made her blood boil and her skin itch.</p><p>“Yes, it’s my bloody paper! Tell me how your son and I handed in the same paper, yet we were given different grades!” Lucius finally sneered up at her.</p><p>“That is twice now, you have cursed at me, Miss Granger. The next time you will be punished. Are you telling me this essay was plagiarized?”</p><p>“No!” Hermione looked stricken at the thought. “I just meant we worked on it together, it has the same concepts!”</p><p>“I see.” He blinked at her, seemingly unbothered.</p><p>“So?” He looked at her and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“So… What, Miss Granger?” Hermione’s jaw dropped.</p><p>“Are you kidding me? You’re not going to change my grade then?”</p><p>“I gave you the grade I feel you deserve, Miss Granger.” Hermione scoffed.</p><p>“This is absolute bullocks. It’s fucking favoritism and I’m going to-“ The witch was cut off mid-sentence as she was spun around and shoved face-first on top of his desk. Hermione struggled against him.</p><p>“Let go of me you piece of-“</p><p>“Now, now. We wouldn’t want to go for a fourth incident, would we, Miss Granger? Thirty strikes ought to help the message sink in, hmm?” He reached down and pulled her skirt up to her waist, bringing her robe with it. Hermione continued to fight and kick, until he eventually muttered a spell, binding her hands in place, and freeing his own. “You are going to count, Miss Granger. Each time you do not, I will add to our count. Do you understand?” Hermione shook her head in a panic as he pulled her knickers up between her cheeks.</p><p>“No, please don’t! I’m sorry! I-“ Hermione gasped in surprise when he struck her the first time. She felt humililiated, tears pricking at the corners of her eyes. The witch continued to struggle, muttering curse words. Lucius sighed after a moment.</p><p>“You aren’t counting. We’ll begin again.” He struck her again, harder than the first time and Hermione let out a pained shutter.</p><p>“Please, don’t! I said I’m sorry, just let me go!” The wizard simply chuckled, smacking her bum again, and Hermione twitched from the pain. “One.” She finally whispered, closing her eyes tightly, resigned to the realization she wouldn't be allowed to leave until her punishment was over. They continued that way until Hermione was sniffling and fighting back tears, and something else she couldn’t quite place.</p><p>“Last one.” Lucius said softly, sounding unsure of whether he was speaking to her or himself. He struck her a final time, harder than before, and Hermione choked back a sob.</p><p>“Thirty.” She whispered, sniffling, but feeling strangely calm. He released the spell on her hands, but Hermione couldn’t move. She stiffened in anticipation as she felt his hand on her backside again. The last thing she wanted was more pain. The pain never came, however. Lucius stroked her burning skin and Hermione sighed, surprised at how good it felt, how alive and alert she was. After some time, Lucius pulled his hand away, and the Head Girl let out a whimper.</p><p>“Please...” The wizard turned to her in surprise. He leaned over, allowing his hand to graze her heated skin once more, and she moaned.</p><p>“What was that, Miss Granger?” He crooned softly, his lips brushing her ear.</p><p>“Please...” her voice was thick with emotion, her throat raw from crying, and Lucius leaned even closer, as though he was having trouble hearing her clearly.</p><p>“Please, What?” He hissed at her, as she continued to wriggle against him, this time for a whole different reason.</p><p>“Please, don’t stop touching me...” she begged. Hermione couldn’t see it, but a smirk spread across the wizard’s face. This time when his hand slid across her bum, her back arched at the touch and she let out a soft moan. Lucius could feel himself hardening and wondered how far she would let this go. When his hand slid lower, they both gasped, Hermione at the pleasure, Lucius at the fact that her knickers were soaked. Hermione heard his belt opening and froze.</p><p>“I’m going to fuck you now, little witch. Would you like that?” Hermione let out a small sob of confusion and need. He paused for a moment, waiting for her refusal.</p><p>“Yes, please, sir.” she finally whispered. He tore her lacy knickers to shreds and positioned himself at her entrance. “Please, Lucius... Fuck me...” The wizard wasn’t sure if it was his name falling from her lips, or the dirty language, but the last of his self-control melted away. He thrust into her, burying himself to the hilt, and Hermione let out a loud cry of pleasure mixed with pain. Lucius pulled himself slowly out, before plunging deep into her tight heat once again.</p><p>“Oh, fuck...” Hermione moaned. When the wizard completely pulled away, the witch whimpered at the loss. She was quickly twisted around, hissing in pain as her red bum met the wood of his desk.</p><p>“Did you think I was going to stop, little witch?” He smirked at her, before leaning down to claim her mouth once again. This time there was no surprise and no fight. Hermione opened to him like a flower to the morning sun. Slowly, Lucius laid her back on the desk, pulling her legs until she was positioned at the edge. The wizard watched her eyes widen as he slowly pushed himself inside her once again. Suddenly, he needed to see her, all of her, and he pulled at her robes until they finally slid off. “Take that off.” He hissed, and Hermione ripped her shirt apart, not bothering with the buttons now littering the floor. Her bra followed shortly, and Lucius Malfoy’s mouth fell open as he took in the sight of her glorious body, skirt hiked up, knee socks on. She looked like a perfect little nymph. The wizard continued pushing in and out of her at a maddeningly slow pace, and soon Hermione was writhing on his desk.</p><p>“Please, faster, sir . Please, I’m so close...” He picked up the pace, feeling his climax approaching as well. He reached down between them, stroking her clit repeatedly until finally...</p><p>“Oh Gods! I-I....” Her eyes slid closed and her body arched as waves of pleasure rolled through her. “Lucius!” She called out his name as she orgasmed, that combined with the tightening around him, pushed Lucius over the edge. He came with a heavy groan, pulsing inside her.</p><p>“Fucking hell...” he whispered when he was able to catch his breath. Lucius glanced up at the witch and she had an odd look on her face, sort of like she couldn’t decide how she felt at the moment. The wizard quickly righted his clothing and Hermione followed suit, repairing her shirt and quickly dressing.</p><p>“I should go.” She whispered, not meeting his eyes. She scooped up her bag, grabbed her paper, and turned to leave, but his smooth voice stopped her.</p><p>“Leave the essay, Miss Granger.” The witch turned to him, her eyes widening in shock and embarrassment.</p><p>“I didn’t do it so that you’d-“ Lucius held up a hand to silence her.</p><p>“I’m aware of that, Miss Granger. Still, if you would like me to take a second look...” Hermione shoved the paper at him, feeling extremely offended, before stomping out of his office.</p>
