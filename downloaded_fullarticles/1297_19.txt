    <p>They stepped down from the shuttle that had brought them all up from Caprica to the Battlestar Galactica, their new home for time being.  Bright, excited silver and emerald green eyes looking around inquisitively, as neither of them had ever been aboard a Battlestar before.  They came to a stop between their Uncle Zac and Kili, fairly vibrating with excitement to get to their new quarters, unpack, and start exploring.  Their grandfather moved forward with a smile toward the two men who waited, both also with smiles.</p><p>"Adama, welcome back," a tall, probably around 6' 5,  wiry of build, though rather well muscled looking, handsome man who had dark brown hair, hazel eyes and looked to be somewhere in his mid to late thirties said, lifting a hand to shake with his Commander.</p><p>"Thank you, Omega."</p><p>Feeling his brother's, his cousin's, and the few warriors that had come up with them move in around them, Roark turned his head to see the all barely containing their amusement as they watched his and Harry's reaction to the huge landing bay around them, some even chuckled quietly.  Bumping his shoulder to Harry's, hearing the chuckles, made Harry turn.  The two of them, unable to contain themselves, stuck out their tongues. </p><p>Then they heard a throat being cleared.</p><p>Two midnight heads snapped back around to now see their grandfather standing there with Omega and a tall, not quite lean, just looking slightly overweight, muscular black man likely in his mid to late fifties or early sixties, amusement reflected in Omega's eyes.  They heard the muffled snickers of the Durin brother's and cousin's at being caught at doing something so childish as sticking out their tongues.</p><p>"Tigh, these are our newest officers and pilots, Captain Hadrian Peverell Potter-Lestrange, or Harry, and Roark Durin Peverell Potter-Lestrange.  Do forgive their childish action you just witnessed.  It seems Roark finding out has a rather large family brother's, cousin's nephew's and niece's, has brought out a side of him none of us had any idea he possessed, and Harry has simply followed his brother in the antics they have been getting up too of late.  Harry, Rory, I'm sure you remember the Galactica's second in command, Colonel Tigh?"</p><p>"Yes, Sir," he answered giving the man a sharp salute.</p><p>"As do I.  Good morning to you, Colonel Tigh," he said, saluting him smartly.</p><p>"It's very good to see you again, Sir, though we were very sorry to hear that you couldn't attend our marriage-bonding ceremony."</p><p>"And I you, Captain Roark, and good morning to you as well, Harry," Tigh said with a smile of welcome to both young men, saluting them in return.  "As far as your marriage-bonding ceremony, I, unfortunately had duty here that I could not get out of, though Adama has promised me a viewing of the video.  Welcome aboard."</p><p>"Thank you, Sir."</p><p>"We're very pleased to be here."</p><p>Tigh had to chuckle as both of them looked around the landing bay again, their eyes wide, excited and he knew they simply could not wait to start exploring.  As around and behind them, the Durin's were also chuckling.  "Excited too, by the looks of it."</p><p>Roark turned around. "You lot hush," he ordered them before turning back, shaking his head at the round of laughter that followed his order.  "Yes, Sir, definitely excited.  We can't wait to get out quarter assignment, unpack and start exploring."</p><p>"We intend to take a nice long walk around the Galactica."</p><p>"Just don't go and get yourselves lost."</p><p>A sound from their grandfather.  "Telling two boys who explored the warren of tunnels under Hogwarts not to get lost, is like telling them no pranks, and no placing bets on things they know they'll win."</p><p>Matching grins from the imps that were his grandsons.  "Besides," Roark said, "we've heard form several sources," a look over his shoulder at some of those sources, namely Kili, Fili, Logan and Damien, before his gaze slid to a smirking Aiden, "that getting lost and finding your way back, is half the fun,"</p><p>Deep laughter followed that as Tigh threw an amused look at the warriors that surrounded Roark and Harry.  "That is very true, Captain.  Very true indeed."</p><p>"Omega," Adama turned to the tall Officer.  "Roark is a very strong empath and telepath, as well as having more than a few other very strong psychic gifts.  He's going to need quarters that are well shielded.  You can place Harry in quarters adjoining the ones you give him."</p><p>"Understood, Commander," he said, stepping forward to salute Harry and Roark.  "Senior Bridge Officer Omega, Captain Roark, Captain Hadrian.  Welcome aboard to you both.  If you'll follow me, we'll see what we can find the two of you."</p><p>"Just a moment, Omega," Ethan touched Logan's shoulder and he turned to the side to allow his brother to move past him.  "I believe there are empty quarters across the hall from mine and Kili's and the quarters that adjoin them on the left are free."</p><p>Omega looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded.  "I remember them, Captain Ethan, but I also remember that both those quarters are family quarters."</p><p>"Well then, as both Harry and Roark are newlyweds whose husbands were kept on Caprica for other duties, those quarters will suit for when Rodolphus and Rabastan DO join them."</p><p>A smile.  "Well then, as that is the case, let's go have a look then, shall we?" he turned.  "Commander? Colonel?"</p><p>"Dismissed gentlemen, ladies," then couldn't help the laugh at the sudden movement of their warrior as they bundled Roark and Harry out of the landing bay, laughing and joking with them.  "Children," he said, then laughed all the harder when, as one, they all turned and stuck their tongues out at him."</p><p>Tigh could only chuckle himself at the antics of the Durin's.  "They will never change, will they, Jacob?"</p><p>"No, Dominic, that they will not, nor would I want them too, as there will be far too much to be serious about soon enough."</p><p>A sigh.  "All too true, my friend, all too true.  Shall we head up to the bridge?  There are a few things we need go over as the last three shuttles arrive."</p><p>"Yes.  Oh!  Roark and Thorin send you their best, and both recommended that you take VERY good care of their son, and nephew."</p><p>Tigh gave a deep laugh.  "They really do need to stop that.  They should know by now that their threats don't work on me."</p><p>"Oh, trust me, they know, but they still feel the need to issue them anyway.  Just as Kendric and Raiden did when they were alive."</p><p>A shake of his graying head, dark brown eyes alight with amusement.  "Durin's.  May Kobol bless that they never change."</p><p>"Family first.  Always."</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>                                                                                              cccVccc</p><p>After they had finished dealing with all the problems that tended to pop up whenever they were preparing to leave.  Once they had finally finished seeing to them, and their duty on the bridge ending for the night, Adama and Tigh retired to his quarters for something to eat and a drink.  "They've grown into incredibly handsome young men, Jacob," Tigh said with a smile as his long time friend carried a glass of ambrosia to him.  "We may have some trouble from some of the warriors. both once they have seen them, and once they've begun their duty rotation."</p><p>Roark is nineteen and Harry just turned twenty-four, Tigh, and they have both gotten very good at taking care of themselves and each other.  Roark's met with opposition from his fellow warrior's because of his age before, and we're quite sure he will again.  He did, after all," a smile, "start much sooner than any of them did, and has dome so much better for himself than any of us ever thought he would, or could have hoped.  He'll handle it as he always has."</p><p>A dark brow shot up.  "I noticed you ignored my first concern."</p><p>A shrug and an even wider smile.  "I'm not ignoring it, my friend, it's just not going to be relevant.  None of those men OR women who think to approach them, will have a chance, as they will all find out soon enough.  Harry and Roark are very deeply, and very completely in love with their husbands."</p><p>"Ah...but those husbands aren't here, my friend, now are they, and we know how some will play when there's no chance of being caught?"</p><p>"Not Harry and Roark.  In fact, it would never occur to either of them to cheat."</p><p>"As you say.  I do however, offer you my full felicitation's on the bonding of your grandson's.  Are the men someone that I know?"</p><p>A smirk.  "Oh, I should think so if you would only think of the name attached to theirs now."</p><p>"The name attach--Lestrange?" then his dark eyes went very wide as the realization hit him full.  "RODOLPHUS and RABASTAN LESTRANGE?!  Two of the best Terminators ever known?  The only two that managed to escape the platinum mine robbery several yahren ago?"</p><p>"The very same.  Only it wasn't an escape.  It turned out to be an extraction.  It seems our Terminators are actually Lt. Colonel Rodolphus Lestrange and Major Rabastan Lestrange.  They're Colonial Counter-Intelligence."</p><p>"Colonial Counter-Intel--How in the blazes did THAT happen?!"</p><p>Adama shrugged.  "Truthfully, I've not a clue as the Lestrange's files were sealed by Roark, Thorin, Dacian, Gabriel and Raphael.  None of them will discuss it.  All they have said, and WILL say is that Rodolphus and Rabastan were two of their best undercover officer's since Severus Prince Snape.  And their assignment was Tom Riddle."</p><p>Tigh shook his head.  "Bad business, Ardyn going bad like that.  I never would have expected it of him given he was such a good officer, a good man.  What happened to him, Jacob?"</p><p>"Yes, he was, and as near as anyone can figure, he became hooked on pain meds, the stronger the better.  The Base CMO on Aquaria refused to give him what HE felt he needed, so he went to someone who would."</p><p>"Tom Riddle."</p><p>A nod.  "Yes."</p><p>"So Rodolphus and Rabastan were uncover agents.  Why not just tell you what you want to know if the Riddle case is over."</p><p>Adama shrugged, finished his ambrosia, got up and went to the sideboard to pour another, holding up the decanter for Tigh, who swallowed the rest of his, then held out his glass.  "You know them about as well as I do, and you know how they protect their undercover people.  Look at the lengths they went too to protect Severus when his assignment ended all those yahren ago.  All any of them are willing to say on the matter is that the Lestrange brothers have been undercover since a couple of yahrens after Riddle murdered James and Lily and tried to kill the boys."</p><p>Tigh shook his head.  "THAT is a long time to be undercover.  So they really were Terminators then?"</p><p>"Let's just say they did what they had too, and everyone who was involved with that case all agree that, even though Riddle is dead, it's far from over.  None of his Inner Circle, his upper echelon was ever captured."</p><p>"Which would be why Rodolphus and Rabastan remained on Caprica instead of joining their new husbands here on the Galactica as they would have were circumstances normal."</p><p>"Possibly, though if you want the truth, I think their remaining on Caprica has nothing to do with the Riddle case as neither of them can work it openly."</p><p>"Because their covers were blown when they fell in love with other Counter-Intelligence Officers?"</p><p>"Exactly.  All Roark and Thorin would say about Rodolphus and Rabastan was that they needed them there on Caprica for the time being."</p><p>"Do Harry and Roark know why?"</p><p>"Likely, but even if they did, they would never speak of it until they were told they could."</p><p>"Because what is Counter-Intelligence business stays within Counter-Intelligence."</p><p>"Exactly so.  When they have something to report, some proof of whatever it is they're looking into, then, and ONLY then, will they be given clearance to speak of it, and we be told."</p><p>"So what was with adding Durin to Roark's name all about?" Wry amusement in his eyes.  "And isn't that a bit of a mouthful?"</p><p>A chuckle.  "It is and for the most part he intends to just go be Roark Lestrange.  You'll only get the full name when he's being introduced for the first time or at official functions.  As for Durin...It seems Roark is the long lost missing youngest son of Roark and that young lady he married on Leo.  He was planning to bring them both home to Caprica as soon as the Solarian was replaces by the Acropolis."</p><p>"Only that never happened because the Cylons attacked Leo, his second in Command sent the Solarian against that Basestar as Roark himself was off duty that day and not aboard."</p><p>"Yes.  As I'm sure you remember, Thorin took Dacian, Gabriel, Raphael, Sebastien, Aiden and Roark with him to Leo as soon as they had heard that Roark was critically injured and not expected to survive.  As soon as he was awake enough to communicate, he begged them to find the woman he's wed and their infant son.  They immediately began to search of course, only to discover that Selina had been killed in the attack and that her body, as well as her infant son, who had survived, had been claimed by the sister.  Too say they were all devastated was mild.  They were forced to return to Caprica without even having a chance to look for the boy.</p><p>"It was when Roark took that knife that the unimaginable happened.  His bloodwork came back, and in it was an anomaly found only in the Durin bloodline.  To be certain of what they were seeing, Severus and Sebastien ran the test twice more.  There was no doubt.  My grandson, Roark Christopher Peverell Potter was Roark Killian Durin's long lost missing son."  He sat back in his chair with a deep sigh.  "Did Omega end up giving Roark and Harry those quarters Ethan told him about?"</p><p>"He did with Dylan next tot Harry and Rohan next to Roark.  Desmond is still next to Ethan and Fili will remain in the quarters beside his brother, with the rest of the Durins spread out up and down that corridor."</p><p>"That's good.  Roark still needs a lot of training, and his shielding though good is also erratic at best."</p><p>Tigh frowned at that.  "May I ask why?"</p><p>Adama sighed again.  "Roark has ALL of the psychic gifts not seen in one single person since the old days of Kobol.  At ten yahren, those gifts were blocked then placed under very strong seals to keep them contained because one of his gifts, the gift of premonition showed him something so horrific, it sent him into a catatonic state to escape it.  The day he met Rodolphus every one of those seals shattered and those blocks began to come apart as well under the pressure of fully awakened gifts.  His fear of returning to Saggitara mean that the Durin's Rodolphus, and Rabastan will have to train him.  And before you ask, while Harry has a few gifts they are nothing on what Roark has shown.  There is also the fact that his magic is slipping his control more than it should, and through him, Harry."</p><p>"WHAT?  They've ALWAYS had incredible control of their magic.  Rodolphus and Rabastan?  What have they to so with Roark's psychic gifts?"</p><p>"Apparently they have a great deal to do with them, but I'll get to that in a bit.  The problem we're facing right now is that Roark's shields are connected to his empathy, which, by the way they aren't supposed to be.  He's not properly grounded, nor is he centered within himself.  Ethan says once they get him grounded and centered, the shields will redistribute themselves accordingly, including the one connected to his empathy, and stop fluctuating so badly."</p><p>"So why all these problems?  I would have thought that would have been the first thing that was taught on Saggitara."</p><p>"It is, but remember, Roark's gifts were locked and sealed shortly after he arrived there.  They're working on it, but the real problem now is that Roark is dreaming, Tigh.  So are Kili and Dylan.  Kili's are almost as bad as Roark's, while for some reason Dylan's aren't.  Roark's premonition is at full strength like his other gifts, and what he sees in those dreams is truly horrific, and in pieces...like a huge jigsaw puzzle that needs to be put together.  The dreams are so bad that his waking mind simply can't, or won't, we aren't sure which at this point, face them.  He never remembers the actual dream, only feelings, impressions.  He remembers the feel of fire, feels the pain, the anger, the fear and fury, then finally he feels the death and the destruction."</p><p>"And as his shields are connected to his empathy, the feelings of what he sees in those dreams are magnified, preventing him from being properly grounded and centered as each time he dreams everything they had put up before comes apart under the pressure."</p><p>A nod.  "That is the theory they're going on."</p><p>"So Rodolphus and Rabastan."</p><p>"Are direct descendants of the ancient aristocratic line of Lestrange on Kobol, and each have some of the same gifts as Roark, though both admit they don't have the premonition gift.  Rodolphus is, however, completely emotionally, mentally and physically linked with Roark.  He was the first one to find the wall around the memory of the dream.  When he, Rabastan, Harry, Roark Sr., and several of Roark's brothers tried to bring the wall down, it sent Roark into a spiral of lost control, dragging Kili and Dylan with him.  Only Rodolphus was able to isolate him and draw him out.  As he did so, he aught bits of what the three were seeing.  They realized it was more then one dream, but a series of them, each one progressively worse than the last."</p><p>"I see," a pause, a thoughtful look on his face.  "So, what is it the final dream portends?"</p><p>"As Ethan and the others were dealing with Dylan and Kili, leaving Roark to Harry, Rodolphus and Rabastan, all any of them caught that were still connected with them got was one of total annihilation."</p><p>Tigh gave a gasp, horror on his face.  "Of WHAT?" came his question.</p><p>"We don't know for sure.  Once Rory and Kili were free of the premonition dream, they locked themselves down, and those walls went back up.  Everyone agrees it's their minds way to defending them against the horror of what they see happening.  Roark was unconscious for three days."</p><p>"You suspect something."</p><p>"What I suspect is something not bearing thinking about."</p><p>Tigh drew in a deep breath.  "You all think it's the Colonies."</p><p>"We have no proof, and with no proof, there is nothing we can do."</p><p> </p><p>A/N  Well, there we go, the first chapter of Part 3.  I just couldn't resist.  Let me know what you think.</p><p>
