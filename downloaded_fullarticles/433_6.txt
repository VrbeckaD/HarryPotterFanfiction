    <p>This isn’t how Petunia had envisioned her life going, especially not after hissing to her sister that <em> she never wanted to see her again </em> . But there she was, staring down at a baby in a basket on her doorstep. It would be easy, she thought, to just close the door, wait for someone else to deal with this <em> development </em>. Someone had left a baby on her doorstep, they should be the ones to come pick it up. The letter next to the baby’s head had her name on it, though, in cursive writing that she recognized despite spending more than twenty years trying to repress those memories. The baby didn’t stir, even as she pulled the letter next to his delicate head. She tried not to think about the photos and letters her sister had sent, had tried not to imagine the terrible things that could have happened to her sister for her son to be on her doorstep. </p>
<p>Petunia Dursley had not needed to open the letter to know her sister was dead. She read the letter anyway, pretending she had been leaning on the doorframe the whole time, rather than needing the support as her legs gave out. She had not thought of her sister in a few months, hadn’t considered what could have been happening in a different world than hers. She had not thought of her sister in months and this letter reminded her of everything that she had ever said. Petunia Dursley would never be able to apologize to her sister. She would not receive an invitation to their funeral. She didn’t know if she would have attended, but the choice was never hers. As she looked down at the baby, who now stared up at her with eyes that she had spent her life envying, she couldn’t help but feel sick to her stomach at the baby who never had a choice. She let the letter fall to the ground; maybe she or Vernon would pick it up later, but the words were burned into her memory, and she would remember the exact words used for the rest of her life. She picked him up from the basket, the weight similar to her own son’s, the weight her sister must have held for hours, never getting tired. She wondered if her sister had sung him the same lullabies that their mother had sung to them when they couldn’t sleep. Her son cried from inside the house and she tightened her arms, stepping back and closing the door.</p>
<p>Lily was dead and her son was in her arms. Her son was in her arms. Lily was <em> dead </em> . Lily had just turned twenty-one years old when they had last spoken in person and now she was <em> dead. </em> Petunia felt a twisting from her stomach as she looked down at this <em> thing </em> that had Lily’s eyes and had probably been the <em> thing </em>that had her killed. She didn’t remember anything else, until her son cried out louder and she snapped out of her daze. Lily’s son stared up at her. She couldn’t think of anything to say to him. She would never know what to say.</p>
<p>Lily had fallen in love with magic, she had loved it more than anything else, and Petunia couldn’t blame her. There was something about the flowers that opened and closed that had curdled the blood inside her veins. It was a small thing, but there was danger in that magic. How long until Lily could make people move the way she wanted, twist them into whatever she wanted? How long until someone took all that pure magic and turned it into a weapon? Would it be Lily? Would it be someone close to Lily? Petunia was fourteen and the disgusting boy that was in love with Lily made a tree branch fall on her. How long would it be before it was the entire tree? Until he could twist her insides into a tangled mess and watch her choke on herself? Petunia was almost twenty-six and her sister was dead and she was still afraid of magic.</p>
<p>Petunia lasts a few days, under the glare of her husband as he takes in the baby. He lets the baby stay in the crib with Dudley, after she chokes out that it was her nephew. He never liked Lily, and he liked James Potter even less than she would ever. Petunia hated him for his casual use of magic, for the way the air around him seemed to spark with electricity, Lily becoming just like him. She hated James for giving Lily a reason to stay, for making her fall in love with more than just magic. She hated James for taking Lily away, with the promise of never giving her back. Vernon hated James for the dark tan on his skin, for the way he sometimes said something offhand in a different language, for the way he spoke about a culture that Vernon knew nothing about. She lasts only a few days before falling to her knees in front of the crib, her nephew staring at her with Lily’s eyes. Her husband and son were downstairs, but she spent most of her free time here, in front of the crib, watching Lily’s son blink at her. There were tears burning her eyes, and her body began shaking with sobs. She covered her mouth with both of her hands, afraid of what she would say if she allowed herself to speak. Would she curse Lily, for leaving her, and everything they had ever known, behind? Would she apologize to her sister, and tell her ghost how much she regretted not picking up the phone or sending back photos of Dudley? Would she scream at her nephew, blaming him for all that she had lost? Would she tell him that he had Lily’s eyes, but that he had the power to make them his own? She did not let herself speak, because there was nothing that could change, no matter what she said. Her sister would still be dead, and he would still be here. That night, she stared up at the ceiling, and in a quiet voice, told her sister’s ghost that she was sorry, sorry for all that they had lost together, sorry for all the wasted time they spent hating each other, sorry for all that would never be. Vernon woke up to his wife crying and tried to comfort her, but she assured him she’d be okay, and made her way to the boys. He followed her and watched his wife pick up their nephew. He swallowed down words about choosing him over their son, but Petunia had been through the wringer these past few days. She would come back to bed when she was feeling better. Petunia held her nephew and thought of the bedroom she had shared with her sister, thought of the memories she had tainted with her own bitterness.</p>
<p>Petunia Dursley hated a lot of things; her sister’s new last name was just the newest thing on the list. Petunia would hate a lot of things about her nephew, but it was never him. She tries to repress the thought, but it floated up into her subconscious every few days: it was never her nephew that she hated. She wondered, constantly, if she could learn to love him, the way she loved her son, the way Lily would’ve loved Dudley if she ever left him in her care.</p>
<p>It was a day like any other. Petunia Dursley woke up, got ready, went to the children’s shared bedroom, got them ready, and then made her way downstairs with two toddlers in her arms. The weight was becoming familiar, only a year after the death of her sister. Her husband gave her nephew the Morning Glare as she handed him a cup of coffee when he entered the kitchen. He hadn’t wanted to fork over money for the second high chair, so she carried her nephew while he fed their son. When Vernon began his lecture to Dudley over the table, his voice carrying into the entire house, Petunia spoke quietly to her nephew, her voice softer than it ever had been, lower than when Lily snuck into Petunia’s bed to have discussions that couldn’t wait until morning. Her nephew was the only person she spoke about Lily to; she figured he deserved to know about his mother. As she leaned over the counter, she told him that Lily liked her eggs over medium, because she didn’t like the taste of the yolk, but their mother insisted on both of the girls eating a plate of eggs and toast before school. She wondered if they could continue this, and in her mind, she could imagine her nephew sitting on the counter while she cooked, perhaps being reprimanded by Vernon for doing so, giving Dudley a fist bump as his cousin passed him to get to the fridge. She wondered if he would like cooking, the way Lily did, if he would like to garden, helping her in the summer to water her prized rosebush; she wondered if Dudley and her nephew would chase down the ice cream truck, if they would ask her to drive them to parties when they were older. She wondered if Vernon would ever learn to love him, if <em> she </em>would ever be able to love him. She wondered if they could ever be happy like that, if at some point, a switch would flip and she could call him by his name, if he would ever be more than just Lily’s son.</p>
<p>She tells Vernon that she’ll be running errands today; their next door neighbor is busy, has a meeting out of town, so she has to take the children with her. He grumbles and sends a second glare at her nephew. She shifted him in her arms nervously as Vernon leaned in to kiss her cheek when he left. Dudley reached out and she picked him up, feeling strangely numb as she looked over her empty kitchen. She had never pictured her sister at her dining table, but she longed for it, for Lily drinking from a wine glass, James and Vernon having heated debates over politics as Lily mimicked the faces they were making over her glass, their children in the living room, watching cartoons. She could almost see it now, spending holidays with them, watching Vernon grumble thanks as he opened his presents from the Potters, giving her nephew boxes to present to his parents, serving hot chocolate to the boys when they came in from playing in the snow. Her nephew patted her face, bringing her back to reality. She blinked and looked down at the boys, shaking her head to clear the thoughts of a future she can never have.</p>
<p>There were times that her dreams clouded her thoughts, where she forgot the fear she held for the curse her sister called a blessing. There were moments where she forgot the way her sister had run away from her, away from everything Petunia was; she forgot everything she hated about Lily. She had prayed, every morning, that he wouldn’t have <em> it. </em> She prayed that he would never cause branches to fall on Dudley’s head, that he would never jump off the swings in an impossible way, that he would never go where they couldn’t follow, where she couldn’t follow. There were a lot of things that Petunia hated, a lot of things that she could learn to stop hating, maybe she could even learn to love many of them. She imagined herself loving this boy, tucking him in, helping him with his homework at the dining table, convincing Vernon to give him The Talk, taking him to his parents’ graves, laying petunias and lilies on Lily’s, telling stories about her sister as she poured a glass of wine, the one that she and Lily had gotten drunk on when they were young and stupid and brave enough to break into their parents’ liquor cabinent, over James’. She could imagine it, but as he reached out in the grocery store, a piece of candy that Dudley was crying over, floating inches from his little hand, it was all shattered. All the daydreams she’d ever had about their perfect family, who they could turn out to be, it was all over. She could never have that, of course she couldn’t. She was a fool to have had faith in a happy ending for them. Her stomach dropped and she remembered reading the letter informing her of her sister’s death. She had never given much thought to what she would do, what they would do if her nephew ever showed… signs… of having what Lily did, what James did. She thought of her destroyed relationship with her sister, and tried not to think of Dudley and her nephew. She remembered what it felt like when her sister had received an owl-delivered letter, while she had spent years pretending she didn’t care, staying up late one night to offer the owl a letter written on college ruled notebook paper. She hadn’t realized she had walked out of the store, until her hands began aching from gripping the steering wheel. She adjusted her mirror, trying to occupy her hands, but caught sight of her nephew, staring back at her, too calm for any <em> normal </em> child. Dudley was fussing and waving around his toy, but her nephew simply stared at her. She turned in her seat and he blinked at her, Lily’s eyes, and she thought of Lily’s ghost watching over her, laughing at Petunia, mocking her for pushing Lily away, and having to raise her <em> cursed </em>son. Petunia was screaming, tears burning her eyes, Lily’s laughter twisted and cruel in her ears, her face decomposing in her mind, but still laughing. She thought of what Vernon would say, what her neighbors would say, and her hysteria was audible over the screaming she used to hear in nightmares. She registered the fear in her nephew’s eyes, but her body was shaking as she sobbed, too much noise surrounding her, and in her head, and she shut her eyes, pulling on her hair, imagining Lily’s falling out as her body continued to rot in her head.</p>
<p>There was loud and rapid knocking on her window and she forced herself to open her eyes, her sobs still loud, but oxygen rushing to her head made her feel dizzy. A concerned shopper had heard her and worried for her and her child’s safety. She was taken to a hospital, her mind numbing as the tests were completed. When Vernon arrived, he was rushed to the children’s ward, and came to check in on her after. Dudley was fine, and he was eager to return to her arms, but Vernon had a strange look on his face. She mouthed a name when the doctors looked away, one she had never been able to say out loud, but he shook his head.</p>
<p>Petunia Dursley had lost her parents at twenty, her sister at twenty-six, and her nephew at twenty-eight. She had been to two of the funerals, not invited to one, and would never have one for the last, but she would mourn every loss, the weight of them drowning her for years.</p>

<p>Jasper and Celeste Greengrass were trying to find their scheduled Portkey, discussing the changes in their government, their neutrality saving them from punishment, but only barely. It was difficult seeing all their friends and family go on trial, and even a year later, tensions were still running high in the upper social classes. The Malfoys had recently sent them an invite to a ball to celebrate also evading punishment, but they were hesitant to attend. Celeste casted a quick <em> tempus, </em> and cursed, thinking of her daughters waiting up for them. Hopefully, their nanny would convince them to go to sleep, but their daughters were stubborn. Jasper muttered <em> point me </em>, and changed their direction, pulling slightly as his wife laughed softly, squeezing his hand in hers as he led her. There was a change in the wind, and she slowed down, looking up at the sky. Her husband smiled at her, the wind ruffling her hair, but he felt a change. It reminded him of the first time he held his wand, the rush of magic in his bones. Before he could say anything, they heard a baby cry.</p>
<p>Jasper Greengrass loves his daughters, more than anything in the world, but a part of him was slightly disappointed that he had no sons. Celeste Greengrass would have loved to give her husband a son, but the curse in her family loomed over her, and she feared what fate would bring her, should she tempt It once more with childbirth. They followed the sound of the crying and found a toddler with eyes that didn’t remind them of anyone they knew.</p>

<p>Perhaps in another life, Petunia Dursley would have learned to love her nephew, would have raised him as if he was her own. Or perhaps he would end up in a cupboard, hidden away so she wouldn’t have to see her dead sister in his eyes. In this life, she would be haunted by his disappearance for many years. </p>
<p>Perhaps in another life, the Greengrasses would only have two daughters, and raise them to carefully edge the line of dark and neutral, to evade the accusations, but stay safe from Unforgivables. In this life, they will name their middle child Henry, who they will read fairy tales to every night, including some of the Wizarding World’s savior, and their youngest daughter will be unable to say his name until she turns seven, only managing to say <em> harry. </em></p>
