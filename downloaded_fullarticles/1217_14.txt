          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ginny looks around the common room. No one is watching, absorbed in conversations and homework and Gobstones.</p><p>There’s a quill and inkwell at the top of her bag, in easy reach. She retrieves them and sets them beside the diary, slightly bent from her pocket.</p><p><em>Harriet doesn’t notice me, Tommie</em>, she scrawls. <em>No one ever does.</em></p><p><em>They will</em>, the diary writes back. <em>Just you wait, my girl.</em></p><p>*</p><p>Ginny dreams of a girl. She can’t be older than Percy, with black hair and black eyes and sharp cheekbones. She’s like Harriet, but stretched and sharp and just…not.</p><p><em>This is wrong</em>, Ginny thinks. She can’t wake.</p><p>
  <em>No, it’s very right.</em>
</p><p>She smells of ink and old paper. She’s cold. Ginny revels in her embrace.</p><p>*</p><p>Ginny comes to on a cold stone floor, with Tommie Riddle—literal girl from months of dreams—hovering over her with a satisfied little smirk on her perfect mouth…</p><p>“It’s all right, Ginevra dear,” Tommie hums, brushing Ginny’s hair from her eyes with intangible, ghostly fingers. “I’ll never forget what you’ve done for me.”</p><p>“Harriet will save me,” Ginny whimpers. “What are you doing, Tommie? Why?”</p><p>You were so kind to me, Ginny wants to say. You listened to me when no one else ever did.</p><p>“Harriet may try, but she will never know you as well as I do.”</p><p>Ginny feels tears dripping down her cheeks, into her hair. It’s true. Harriet has never noticed her.</p><p>“Hush now. It won’t be long.” Tommie’s lips brush her forehead. Ginny blushes, even now.</p><p>“Remember,” Tommie murmurs, rising to her knees. “If you wake, then I have disappeared.”</p><p>Ginny’s eyes close. She hopes she doesn’t wake.</p></div>
