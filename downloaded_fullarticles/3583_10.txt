    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“We’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That’s who we really are.”</p><p>-J.K Rowling, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.</p><p> </p><p>Harry James Potter, a wizard of magnificent strength and power, with dazzling green eyes and a heart of fire, is on the run from the Ministry of Magic. Well, ‘running’ is a loose term, really; because currently he’s sitting on the edge of a cliff, head tipped towards the sky and watching the stars sparkling up above. It’s pretentious and desperate, the way he looks at the stars, as if they somehow had the power to change the outcomes of Harry’s own mistakes. However pretty they are, they’re not sentient and they most certainly do not hold time changing powers.</p><p> </p><p>At the end of the day would he really change the past, though?</p><p> </p><p>He doubts it. He’s created a problem for himself, for the rest of his life, but perhaps that’s his mistake to bear. The sheer amount of deaths in his name is - no. He stops himself. He curses at himself internally, glaring angrily. He told himself that he wouldn’t think of <em> them </em>ever again. He won’t go down that hole again, not if he can help it.</p><p> </p><p>He’s doing his penance.</p><p> </p><p>He can barely remember how long it’s been, moving every few days, scarcely eating, scarcely sleeping. Forget months or years; it’s been centuries.</p><p> </p><p>He falls down onto his back, absentmindedly gesturing with his hand around the meadow he’s laying in, setting up wards without uttering a word. He’s got a lot of time on his hands; he mastered non-verbal magic ages ago. The wards are strong, and will keep him safe as long as he stays there. But this place, for some reason he can’t place, makes his mouth taste sour and his stomach turn over. It doesn’t feel safe.</p><p> </p><p>The summer night is warm enough that he’s nearly comfortable on the ground, drifting off into sleep as he counts the constellations above him, trying in vain to remember all the stories that they hold.  </p><p> </p><p>II.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as Harry wakes up, he leaves. That place had felt weird. He couldn't find any peace there. It had almost been like someone was <em> watching </em>him.</p><p> </p><p>Watching him as he stumbled away from the edge of the cliff, the morning so new that the sun had not yet risen over the horizon.</p><p> </p><p>Watching him as he turned his head sharply from side to side, eyes flashing as he sliced the elder wand through the air, a thin white mist hanging in the air for a beat before it seemed to swarm away, as if the mist itself was looking for someone <em> watching. </em></p><p> </p><p>Harry has not felt safe in a long time.</p><p> </p><p>That being said, this is the most <em> unsafe </em>he’s felt in… years.</p><p><br/> It’s too quiet. Too still. Where are the small creatures, snuffling around through the nearby forest and around the edge of the cliff, only being awake at night as predators lurk in the sunlight of the daytime. There’s no wind, trees and bushes and grass alike staying too <em> still. </em> There’s no owls in the trees, no bats fluttering through the light overlay of clouds that covered the stars at some point within the last half hour or so. His wards are still up. Logically, there’s no way anybody could even <em> begin </em>to get close enough to attack him.</p><p> </p><p>But, as Harry Potter had come to learn, logic doesn’t always apply when it comes to the people following him.</p><p> </p><p>He fights to keep his breaths slow and even, carefulling spinning around in a circle, eyes wide, <em> waiting. </em></p><p> </p><p>Have they found him?</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, somewhere to his right, by the edge of the forest, there’s a shout. A scream. A yell. An, “Over here! Quick!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry watches as a group of men, fully dressed in leather dragonhide armour and holding their wands up high, stalk out from behind the cover of the trees. The wards stop them from hearing or seeing Harry. Either way, he crouches down, his hand steady as he grips his own wand so tightly he can almost feel it humming with magic.</p><p> </p><p>His pulse quickens as the leader of the group jerks a hand up, signalling the rest of them to stop. There has to be at least twelve of them, all highly trained aurors, if Harry were to guess. Highly trained and with their commander’s orders in their minds. They’ll believe the stories that the Ministry told. The lies and the manipulation will have got to them, making them believe that Harry is bad. That Harry has to be feared.</p><p> </p><p>At this point though, he doesn’t even blame them. There’s a part of him that thinks he’s bad, too.</p><p> </p><p>But that doesn’t mean he’ll let them catch him. So he stands tall and takes several steps backwards, until the heels of his feet are standing on the rough sandy edge of the cliff.</p><p> </p><p>The group of wizards are getting closer. The wards are still in place; Harry can practically feel them.</p><p> </p><p>But the aurors are trained. They know how to disable wards, even <em> Harry’s, </em>which are stronger and thicker than any normal ones. So as they wave their wands at the wards, muttering spells under their breath, Harry closes his eyes, shifts his weight back, and lets himself fall.</p><p> </p><p>III.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t often visit the graveyard in Godric’s Hollow anymore. It’s full of bodies of people who died so that Harry would live. Dozens upon dozens. Hundreds, thousands even, all around the country. Buried underground with a gravestone above their head. Hundreds that had one goal as death came for them: ‘<em> Let Harry Potter live’, </em>and that is something that Harry himself cannot live with.</p><p> </p><p>He keeps the invisibility cloak over him as he stares at his mother's grave. His father’s is beside it.</p><p> </p><p>Lily Potter. Mother, sister, daughter, friend. Loved one. Beautiful one. Died to keep her only son alive.</p><p> </p><p>If only she could see him now. Would she be disappointed in him, wanting more of her child? Wanting him to have become a great wizard?</p><p> </p><p>He is a great wizard. But so was Voldemort.</p><p> </p><p>IV.</p><p> </p><p>Harry doesn’t hear about it until almost three days after the event itself happens. Daily Prophets are few and far between, a hard thing to come by when you’re on the run and trying to stay as far away from the wizarding world as possible. But there’s an owl, flying through the sky in the early morning, the paper tied to its leg. A quick summoning charm is all it takes. The owl itself seems to care very little, simply letting out an indignant squawk before taking flight again.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>MASS PANIC, MINISTER OF MAGIC “TRYING” TO CONTAIN  THE SITUATION</em> </b>
</p><p>There’s a large picture and the people in it are running around, terrified, screaming. In the background there’s a building collapsing, and a furious cloud cover rolling and tumbling, lightning spiking out of it and… Harry squints, looking at it closer. It looks like there’s <em> something </em>inside the clouds. It’s dark, almost like waves, crashing to the side.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> On August 13th, at precisely 9:46 am, a strange storm took over the whole of London - some witnesses even stating that they could see it from their houses miles away from the city. People panicked and fled the scene as buildings seemed to collapse of their own accord. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Muggles are saying it was an earthquake coupled with a lightning storm, however aurors are saying with definite certainty that this was the work of something larger. It’s been nearly three hundred years since the Dark Lord was defeated during the great battle of Hogwarts, but did he really die? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Harry Potter, who disappeared after an ‘accident’ that took the lives of over seventy of the survivors of the great battle, has yet to be found. We are told that it was he who defeated he-who-must-not-be-named during the battle. What if they were working together the entire time? Could the Dark Lord be back? More on pages 4-6. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s hands are shaking. His face is transformed into one of anger, and the ground beneath him starts rumbling. The</p><p>Prophet, in his hands, bursts into flame. He throws it aside and disapparates.</p><p> </p><p>Every single person in a twelve-mile radius of Harry Potter at that moment does not get a good night’s sleep for over a month.</p><p> </p><p>V.</p><p> </p><p>For years, Harry has sacrificed everything he knows and loves for the good of the wizarding world. He’s laid down his life, more than once, to free them all from the evil lurking. He’s killed all types of demons and monsters; he’s fought countless battles, all for the people who took him in when he was eleven years old, wanting nothing more than to disappear.</p><p> </p><p>The wizarding world, for all intents and purposes, saved Harry Potter.</p><p> </p><p>In the past, he would have done anything for them. He aspired to be great, to become an auror, to marry Ginny and start a family and live a life that, when he was eleven, he never thought he’d be able to have. The wizarding world was a safe haven, a <em> home </em>for Harry when he had nowhere else to go.</p><p> </p><p>He went above and beyond in repaying them, defeating the darkest wizard of all time. <em> Dying </em>for them.</p><p> </p><p>At the end of the day, tens of years later, he’s in the middle of the forest, eyes flashing red and magic seeping into the ground beneath him. Dark, angry magic. He screams. An inhumane sound fills the air, thick with betrayal and hatred. He falls to the ground and digs his fingers into the dirt. A dark mist wraps around him and the sheer amount of power that he conducts through his body and out into the forest is incomprehensible.</p><p> </p><p>He’s angry. So, so angry. Unbelievably angry. So angry that his blood is running hot and he can barely catch his breath. So angry at the way that the very world that saved him, so many years ago, is now treating him like he’s no better than <em> Voldemort.   </em> Just because of an <em> accident </em>that happened. Just because of a corrupt government that took everything Harry had built up.</p><p> </p><p>It was them who killed all those people.</p><p> </p><p>It was all them.</p><p> </p><p>Harry is sick of hiding. Sick of running. Sick of blaming himself.</p><p> </p><p>He screams again. Birds take flight, leaving the forest as quick as their wings can take them.</p><p> </p><p>It’s the Ministry who took everything away.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> And fucking hell, even if it’s the last thing that the Boy Who Lived ever does, he will make them pay. </em>
</p><p><br/> </p><p>Over the years, Harry has found out more about both his own magic and the magic that the world held than Hogwarts had taught him during the six years that he attended.</p><p> </p><p>He can do everything without the aid of a wand, to the point where doing magic is second nature to him. He needs it to to survive. Perhaps more important than that is that he needs it to stay <em> sane. </em>It’s a friend, a power deep inside him, so strong that he doesn’t know who he’d be without it. Or if he would even be alive without it.</p><p> </p><p>The elder wand does what Harry bids it to, being that to obliviate the memories of people who lay eyes on him or set wards so strong that he’d be <em> impossible </em>to find, no matter how smart the wizard or witch.</p><p> </p><p>He hasn’t had much human contact since the incident that resulted in him becoming a wanted criminal. The encounters are always fleeting - Harry lost in a crowd of muggles halfway across the world from London; placing his order at a cafe; disappearing into dark alleyways, a homeless person watching from a distance with blurry eyes. He tries to keep these encounters few and far between, making sure to change his appearance enough so that nobody can recognise who he is.</p><p> </p><p>VII.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s life passes by in segments, fragments of the whole story. His hair grows too long and the bags under his eyes become deeper and darker. He stays in one place for no longer than twenty four hours. Slowly, carefully, he plans.</p><p> </p><p>Plans to get back what was taken from him.</p><p> </p><p>Plans to get revenge.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
