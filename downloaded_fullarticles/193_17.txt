    <p>
  <span>“Alright, mate?” Ron asks across the Gryffindor table. When Harry doesn’t answer immediately, he launches a still-steaming roll toward his best friend, and hits him smack in the face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry flinches, arms moving to catch the roll before his eyes can pull away from the head table and catch up with the rest of his body. The tips of his fingers grab the bread in the nick of time. “What the fuck, Ron?” Harry glares lightly at him and tosses it back his way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Language, Harry!” Hermione scolds from beside Ron, glancing to the other end of the table where the new first-years watch the trio with wide eyes when they think they don’t notice. Occasionally, an older student will look their way too, but by now they’re used to the antics.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rolls his eyes. He’d gone through the entire summer without Hermione on his back for swearing or making inappropriate jokes, but she’d mentioned something on the Express about “setting a good example for the younger years.” Or something. Ginny had laughed at that one, said he’d be more likely to burn Hogwarts down than be a good example for its students. “Well it’s not like he ever has before, has he?” she’d pointed out. Harry elbowed her at that, grumbling about how it wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> fault the world had it out for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve been spacing out for the past two minutes,” Ron says to him, forehead creased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shrugs. “Couldn’t sleep last night. I was too excited to come back.” ‘Excited’ is a nice word for it. The anxiety of returning to Hogwarts for the first time since the Battle had held his lungs tight and his brain vigilant. Thankfully, his panic attacks and mental breakdowns have always been on the quiet side. His nightmares, however, are another matter. One that never failed to wake Ron from a dead sleep and make Harry more exhausted than he was before he tried to sleep in the first place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron looks between Harry and the head table. “You sure?” he asks hesitantly. They haven’t had a meal in the Great Hall since Snape--hell, since </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dumbledore</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Every few minutes, Hermoine digs her nails into Ron’s thigh. She hides the tremble of her lips through bites of food, but after three months of holding one another through their traumas, Ron notices.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nods once, swallows. “Yeah. It’s just...different, you know?” McGonagall has taken the Headmaster’s seat, and Harry’s happy for her, he really is. They met eyes for just a second right after the sorting, and Harry could see the pride absolutely radiating off of her. The new Gryffindor Head of House and Transfiguration professor is none other than Charlie Weasley. He’d returned to Britain just before the final battle, and hadn’t had it in himself to leave since. After losing Percy and nearly losing Fred, staying close to home was keeping his parents from losing their sanity. When Harry had holed himself up in Grimmauld Place for two weeks after the battle, Charlie was the one who showed up in his Floo, coaxing him out of bed and into the shower. Charlie was the one that made sure he ate and packed his trunk for the Burrow. Charlie was a rock and Harry didn’t know how he could do it with everything else going on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Next to Charlie was Bill Weasley, the temporary Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. After losing Fleur to the same monster that had given him the scars on his face, he’d gone a bit off the rails--rightfully so, Harry thought. He’d started drinking, gotten fired for losing focus and landing himself in St. Mungos on more than one occasion, and started drinking even more. Surprisingly, Ron had been the one to talk him down from that ledge, storming into Shell Cottage one night and obliterating any bottle that had the faintest smell of alcohol. The owl from McGonagall asking him to return for half a year while they sought someone permanent for the position came the next week, and Ron swore he knew nothing about it with the smallest smirk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry thought it was something of a miracle that there weren’t more new faces at the head table than the two Weasley brothers. He tried his best not to count faces at his own table; he didn’t want to know who didn’t return, whose funerals he’d missed (because when that many people die so quickly, funeral times are bound to overlap and, simply put, Harry couldn’t drag himself to every wake he was invited to). He just wanted to have a semi-normal year with his friends.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter,” a bright, masculine voice comes from behind him, and Harry groans internally before turning, knowing exactly who it is.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy,” he returns, hating that he has to look up to him from his seated position.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A word?” Malfoy asks before turning to exit the Great Hall. He doesn’t turn to see if Harry’s following until he reaches the archway. He gives Harry a withering look when he sees the boy has yet to move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turns to Ron and Hermoine, who look angry enough for him. “What could bloody Malfoy want with you? Didn’t you already do enough for him?” Ron groans. He’d said the same thing when Harry had told him he wanted to testify at Malfoy’s trial, along with his mother’s. Even after Harry explains what Narcissa has done for him, Ron is hesitant to believe anything redeeming about the family. Hermione understands slightly better, knows that this is just something Harry has to do, but she still pulls a face whenever it’s mentioned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shrugs and puts down his silverware. “I guess we won’t know unless I find out,” he sighs, standing. “Send a search party if I’m not back by dessert,” he says, only half-joking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tries to put on a nice face before he reaches the hallway, but the grunted “what’s up?” that leaves his mouth sounds anything but welcoming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy frowns, posture going ramrod straight. “Sorry to disturb you, Oh Holy One,” before Harry can react, Malfoy pulls a box wrapped in mint green paper and a white ribbon out of his pocket and thrusts it between them. “I just wanted to thank you. For what you said at the trial...and whatnot.” He bites his lip and looks down to the box. He takes a deep breath, and Harry can see the way the bow on top shakes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry grabs it clumsily and jams it into the pocket of his robes. “I don’t need a present, you know,” Harry starts, but backtracks when he sees the way Malfoy’s face sours. “But thank you anyways. I...I just did what anyone would do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Malfoy rolls his eyes. “You did what any </span>
  <em>
    <span>Gryffindor</span>
  </em>
  <span> would do, maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nods and gives him a tentative smile. “Yeah, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy lets the corners of his lips curl up. “I had this crazy idea that we could be civil this year.” He suggests.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry pauses for a moment. “Perhaps,” he says slowly. “But I think I need more proof you won’t be an arsehole before I say yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Surprised, Malfoy lets out a choked kind of laugh. “Right. I can try not to be an arsehole if you try, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s smile grows, and he turns back to the Great Hall. “I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. Later, Draco.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he returns to his friends, Harry wagers a quick glance up to the head table. Charlie and Bill are unabashedly looking at him, whispering to one another. Feeling the blush rising in his cheeks, he breaks contact with them and hurries back to his place at the table, where a large platter of treacle tart has appeared just in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He supposes sometimes it is good to be back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The eighth years are told to stay seated until everyone else has left for their dormitories, and it doesn’t take long for them to be buzzing with excitement. In her “welcome back” speech, McGonagall had mentioned the eighth years would be staying in another part of the castle, but past that, no one had any clue. “I hope we’re near the kitchens,” Seamus says. Ron laughs and claps him on the back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermoine shakes her head at them. “I bet we’ll be near the library. McGonagall said this year would be extra challenging and it would be so helpful to be nearby. Not to mention we’ll also be close to the classrooms, giving us more time to get ready in the mornings.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or, I don’t know, sleep?” Harry replies, laughing at Hermoine’s glare of disapproval.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the last of the first-year Hufflepuffs drift out of the hall, McGonagall approaches the eighth years. “If you’ll follow me,” she waves past them, her velvet robes sailing behind her majestically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The group is lead to the third floor. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine exchange glances as they find themselves back at the door they faced at the end of their first year. Now, there’s a portrait in front of it, but Harry still has that quaking feeling in his bones that danger lies on the other side. “Now, if you’ll remember, this floor has been closed off for nearly a decade,” Harry swears McGonagall stares right at him, “due to various repairs and projects over the years. Hogwarts, however, has heard our needs and once again accommodated herself to fit them. The entrance to your dormitory is through this door. The password is…” she trails off, looking at the portrait for the first time since leading the group up. “Oh, where did he go now? Sleeping in my office, no doubt,” she grumbles. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looks to Hermoine, who’s wearing the same confusion on her face that he feels. The only portraits in the Headmaster’s office were…</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Albus! There you are. Slacking on your duties already?” McGonagall says sternly to the portrait of Dumbledore walking into the frame.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now Minerva, dear, you told me to be ready at 9, and as you can see, it is only 8:58.” Even in his portrait, Dumbledore has that knowing sparkle in his eyes that makes Harry’s stomach turn. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On time is late, Dumbledore,” McGonagall reminds the painting with a short roll of her eyes. “Anyway,” she turns back to the group, seemingly unfazed by the nervous energy floating in the air. “The password is Bertie Bott’s,”--the door opens up to a much more inviting room than had been there before, one without trapdoors or giant three-headed dogs--“and will change on a biweekly basis. You will need to check the board in the common room every other Monday for the new password. Now, I’ll leave you all to settle into your rooms. The girls’ rooms are on the left, gentlemen to the right. There are four beds and an en-suite bathroom in each room, and no more than two people from the same house can stay in any one room. This year we’d like to encourage more inter-house unity, and we expect you to lead by example. Now, off to bed! You will receive your schedules at breakfast tomorrow, so do try not to oversleep.” she takes a step toward the stairs and the eighth years part down the center, leaving her a perfect aisle to walk through. “And one last thing. As you are eighth years, we trust that you know when you need to sleep and when you need to stay awake. Therefore, curfew is lifted for you; the prefects have been told to refrain from giving you punishment so long as you are not causing any other issues. However, do remember that this is a privilege that I can and will take away.” With that, she retreats down the stairs and students begin to pile into their new common room. “Oh, and Mr. Potter?” McGonagall calls just before he makes his entrance into the dormitory. “Your Head of House would like to see you before you retire for the night. I assume you remember where the office is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry flushes at the memory of detentions with McGonagall, but nods. “Yes, ma’am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very well.” McGonagall looks him in the eye for longer than he feels comfortable with, and her face shows something like understanding. Of what, Harry is unsure. “Sleep well, Mr. Potter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Charlie must have been waiting for him; the door opens seconds after he knocks. “Harry,” Charlie greets with a warm smile and an even warmer fire; the room must be at least ten degrees hotter than the rest of the castle. “Come in. Cocoa should be ready in a minute or two.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smiles and relaxes as Charlie lets him in. He’s not sure what he expected on the walk to his office, but it should have been this. It’s practically routine at this point: Charlie makes cocoa, invites Harry to his room, and they talk. Sometimes about Quidditch, sometimes about the war, sometimes about Ron (or any of the other Weasleys, really) and what an idiot he is. Why did he ever think he needed to be nervous? It’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>Charlie</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of all the Weasley brothers Harry expected to get close to, Charlie was at the bottom of the list. He’d only met him twice before this summer: briefly when he came to get Norberta Harry’s first year, and then again for a few days during the Triwizard Tournament. Neither time was exactly an opportune time to start a friendship. Charlie was working and Harry was, well. Doing what Harry did: trying not to die. That day in late May was when it really started.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because he’d never needed to be, Charlie was never keyed into the wards of Grimmauld Place. He’d been in for quite the surprise when the Floo roughly pushed him out when he tried to come through. He’d had to owl Harry to allow him in. Harry took nearly two days to respond, and even then, all he’d said was a messy “okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first thing Charlie noticed when he entered Harry’s house was the smell of decay. He’d gagged and almost lost his breakfast by the time his nose adjusted. He called for Harry, and didn’t get an answer. He’d had to search the house room by room until he found the man curled up in bed, eyes rimmed red and cheeks sunken in. “Oh, Harry.” he sighed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Harry hissed at him before looking at him. “Charlie?” he asked when he did, voice smaller but no less annoyed. “I thought you were Ron.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You gave me access to your Floo yesterday. Did you think I wanted it for no reason?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked blankly, as if he’d forgotten that was only yesterday. “Right, right...can I help you, then? As you can see, I’m a very busy man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie scoffed. “No offense, but which one of us really looks like they need help right now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes grew hard, cold. “Oh, you’re here to </span>
  <em>
    <span>help</span>
  </em>
  <span> me?” he sneered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie nodded. “That’s what I said mate, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rolled over, tangling further into his blankets. “If you’re here to help, fuck off. I don’t want it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that Harry made room by moving, Charlie sat on the edge of the bed. “What do you want, then? To be alone? I highly doubt that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t know anything,” Harry grunts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie shrugged, even though he knew Harry couldn’t see. “Maybe so, but I certainly could try. I was there, too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s head whipped around dramatically to face him, eyes redder than before but also blazing with something heavy. “You think you’ll understand because you were there for a fucking battle?” Harry seethes. “A few hours to understand a lifetime of war? Tell me, how many deaths do you have on your conscience? How many months did you spend on the run from a literal fucking psychopath? How many times have you held the fate of the world in your hands?” The passion seemed to force Harry out of bed. Charlie stood and took a few steps back as Harry rolled out of bed and stood in something of a dueling position. Charlie’s heart began to beat a little faster until he saw the tip of Harry’s wand poking out from under his pillow. Still, the air in the room was sharp like electric--like magic. “I can’t leave my house without worrying that I’ll break down or get mobbed or most likely both, and how am I supposed to face the friends I have left without thinking about every one that I’ve let down? And you think you can understand all of that because of a fucking battle?” Harry was sobbing by the time he finished, shoulders heaving with the force of him trying to hold back. He looked at the glass of water on his bedside table, shivering like he was, knowing just how close he was to losing it too much to ever regain control.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Realization dawned on Harry’s face mere seconds after he caught his breath. “Fuck, Charlie, I didn’t mean that. Well, I didn’t mean to say that to you. I’m sorry, god I’m such a prick. This is why I haven’t been talking to anyone. I’ve got...there’s just this...I’ve felt out of control, ever since the end. Of the battle, I mean. It feels like there’s some kind of volatile potion in my chest and I never know when it’s going to react or boil over.” The words tumbled out of him as he clutched his chest. “It </span>
  <em>
    <span>hurts</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Charlie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And instead of yelling back, like any normal person would do, Charlie grabbed Harry and pulled him into the most bone-crushing hug he’d ever experienced. “That’s okay, you know.” Charlie said. “Grief does that sometimes, and you look exhausted. I’m sure that doesn’t help.” He paused for a second, watched him closely. “When was the last time you slept, Harry?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that was the beginning of Charlie and Harry. Two weeks later, Charlie had him moving into the Burrow temporarily, where he remained until the end of his summer. “It helps to be around family, trust me,” Charlie had promised. At that point, Harry had to take a moment to remember that the Weasleys didn’t hate him for killing their son, that he was still their family. Being alone for so long had convinced him otherwise. He had lost it again, totally and completely, when they’d apparated to the Burrow and the whole family, Bill and Hermoine included, was waiting to welcome him home. The late-night cocoa talks had started not long after that, and Charlie was right--being around family helped. He could function again (most days), if only so that Ron didn’t physically force him out of bed and Hermoine didn’t give him that god-awful hurt puppy look of pity. Still, not long before his birthday, Harry found himself with the realization that his talks with Charlie were the only time he felt anything close to human, and that’s been the truth to this day. There were other moments, pickup games of Quidditch and unexpected pranks from the twins’ new projects, but this is different. Charlie is the first person Harry has gotten close to that didn’t watch him grow up, the first to not expect anything from him but what he is now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Harry knows it, a mug of cocoa is hovering in front of his eyes. “Do you want to sit?” Charlie asks at his side, gesturing to a half-open door that leads to something like a living room. Harry realizes that must be where the heat is coming from, smiles, and nods.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie’s the best thing that’s happened to him since the end of the war, and maybe even longer than that. He doesn’t get mad like Ron or hurt like Hermoine when Harry lashes out. Maybe because he knows that it’s never really about him. Harry told him once that he doesn’t think he knows Charlie enough to really be angry with him yet. Harry knows that it comes down to Charlie being a total rock, with his family and with Harry. As Harry watches him sip calmly at his own cocoa, he wonders how someone can be so stoic. Has Charlie so much as flinched since Percy died? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sit on the black leather couch facing the fireplace. “Why didn’t you tell me you were Gryffindor’s Head of House?” Harry asks after a few minutes. Lately, Charlie has been letting Harry control where their conversations went. At first, it had been like pulling teeth, getting Harry to talk about anything of substance. Charlie found that the closer they grew and the quieter he was, the easier Harry found it to spill anything important.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie laughs and puts his feet up on the dark, wooden coffee table in front of them. “I wanted to give you something of a surprise. I thought you might have guessed it, actually. Hermoine asked me about it a week ago.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry blushes; it makes sense, given he’s the only one on staff that fits the criteria. He’s been too wrapped up in himself to even notice. “Nope, you got me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you been to your room yet? I heard the eighth year dorms are pretty wicked.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shivers at the thought of having to return there. He shakes his head. “McGonagall sent me here before I had the chance to go in.” He frowns. “Did you know the entrance to the common room is a portrait of Dumbledore?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A guilty look crosses Charlie’s face, giving him the answer he expects. “I tried to convince McGonagall it wasn’t a good idea, and she told me it wasn’t her doing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rolls his eyes. Hogwarts never wanted to give him a break, did it? “I don’t know how I’m going to walk past him every day, let alone talk to him.” Harry sits his mug on the coffee table and props his own feet up beside it. “I don’t even know how to feel about him. I think I might still be angry with him.” Harry speaks to the fire, not willing to look at Charlie. He’d only mentioned Dumbledore once or twice in their talks, and only in passing, because quite frankly, that was a wound Harry wasn’t ready to go near. Yet here he was, being forced to face it, and it simply wasn’t fair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s okay. He would understand,” Charlie says softly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What if he tries to talk to me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then tell him what you’re telling me,” Charlie shrugs like it’s obvious. Perhaps it is, but Harry’s never been great at standing up to Dumbledore. Except for that one time fifth year after Sirius, and even that was more trashing the man’s office than going off on him. He’d been called “Dumbledore’s man” with good reason.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-I don’t know…” Harry stutters, feeling his breathing going heavy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, hey, hey,” Charlie soothes, moving closer so he can run his hand down Harry’s back. “If it’s that big a deal, just make sure Ron or someone is with you when you go back to the common room. And if you can’t find anyone, just come ask me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry is already shaking his head. “No, I wouldn’t want to bother--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up, Harry,” Charlie’s hand raises to Harry’s shoulder and squeezes. “You know damn well you’re not bothering me or anyone else. And even if you are, I’d say you have at least the first half of the year to milk the ‘saviour’ thing without people getting too annoyed by it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wants to object, but he knows Charlie’s right. He usually is, annoyingly, about things like this. He likes to tell Harry he’s paranoid. How can he not be, after everything? It’s not like he’s used to people telling him their intentions. He thinks that for a leader of a revolution, he sure did a lot of following.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Charlie starts, drinking the dregs of his cocoa. “What was that with you and Malfoy at dinner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t matter,” Harry says immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie raises an eyebrow. “No?” is all he says, fighting a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man has a way of getting under Harry’s skin without saying a word. He’s just sitting there, hand resting against the small of Harry’s back, and Harry knows before he opens his mouth that he has to tell him. After all these months of oversharing for the first time in his life, he’s still not sure he likes it. He supposes there are worse people to test the waters with--Charlie’s still here, after all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighs. “He wanted to call for a truce.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie’s other eyebrow rises to meet the first one. “Huh, I didn’t think he was mature enough for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s different now. I mean, I guess we all are, but...he seemed to really mean it.” Harry doesn’t mention the gift; for some reason that he hasn’t quite figured out, he wants it all to himself. Telling someone else about it feels too much like giving it away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to accept it?” Charlie asks lightly, picking at a thread on his shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nods slowly. “I did, actually. I’m tired of fighting.” He sips down the last of his cocoa. “Although if there is one person I’d still like to duel, it’d probably be him. Riling him up was usually pretty satisfying.” The sectumsempra incident flashes in his memories, but he pushes it away. He hasn’t gotten around to telling Charlie that one--it’s between him and Malfoy and Madam Pomfrey, he supposes. The only other people that know about it are dead, which is sickeningly relieving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie gives him an odd look before joining him in laughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry tries not to think about it.</span>
</p><p> </p>
