    <p>It… was a weird feeling when I opened my eyes. Like… really, REALLY weird.<br/>
I could not remember overly much. There was a crash, immense pain, flashing lights… then calmness and cold, beeping sounds. And then there was… nothing.<br/>
There had been an accident, that much I could remember. I had been running on the side of the road, when suddenly a car had come careening towards me, crashed into the barrier that had separated the road from the pavement. And then it had crashed into me. After that… flashing lights and pain. The beeping probably indicated a stay in the hospital. Had they healed me? Completely?<br/>
I didn’t feel any pain…<br/>
Carefully I tried moving my arms and legs and really: no pain. Only then did I take a look around. I was in a room that looked kind of similar to mine when I had been a kid. The bed was made of wood, had four low posters and the duvet showed pictures of flowers. It was definitely intended for a kid. Still, I fit into it without problems, which weirded me out quite a bit. Beside the bed there was a bookshelf, filled to the brim with books of every variety – from children’s books to books for young adults and loads and loads of non-fiction and textbooks. There also were even more stacks of books on the bedside-table. Diagonal to the bed stood a heavy wardrobe and next to it, under a window, a desk with some more piles of books, together with notebooks and a few pencils. Some clothes had been thrown over the chair in front of it, nearly burrowing a brown teddy bear underneath.<br/>
There also was a chest of drawers with more books and some small knick-knack on top of it and a chest that looked like it could be containing pirate-booty crowded into the small room.<br/>
Where the hell was I?!<br/>
Warily I tiptoed to the window and peered through the curtains. I didn’t recognize the cobbled street with the narrow houses, but… they reminded me of my stay in Bridgend, a small town near Cardiff, the capital of Wales, or the time I had spent in Fort William, an even smaller town in Scotland. They were narrow but pretty high, just like the room I was in, with small gardens that tended to be a bit on the wild side, and looked kind of huddled together.<br/>
Yes, they definitely reminded me of my stay in the UK. And they definitely didn’t look like any city or town in Austria.<br/>
What the hell?!<br/>
My eyebrows lowered and I started worrying my lower lip. Something just… wasn’t right. I had of course read about people being abducted by some mentally ill and placed in rooms of their loved ones as substitutes, but didn’t that usually happen to children? Or… young, insecure women, at most?! And not people like me – confident women, secure in their standing and their abilities and rapidly going on thirty… One might be able to consider me pretty, but I was by no means a beauty, so that reason fell flat too. I wasn’t a person of interest either, considering I was a librarian. I hadn’t witnessed any crime or anything comparable, my hobbies were nothing of real interest to anyone. Maybe martial arts, archery, hiking, sewing and forging were not the usual hobbies of your average 29-year-old in the 21st century, but they were nothing that would warrant a kidnapping.<br/>
So… what the bloody hell was I doing here? And in a child’s room, no less?!<br/>
If I really wanted to, I could climb out of that window without any problems and be on the street, ready to run to safety and call for help in mere minutes, since I was only on the first floor.<br/>
But I was… curious.<br/>
Before running away and calling the law down upon my maybe-or-maybe-not-kidnappers, I wanted to know what I was doing here, how I had gotten here and who had brought me to this place. For that I would gladly try to do some acting – even if I was admittedly quite terrible at it.<br/>
So I snuck out of my room and looked around. I was standing in a corridor and counted six doors, including the one to the room I had woken up in, and excluding the door that obviously was the door that would lead me outside. With a hand on the doorknob I realized that somehow this apartment had to have been built for giants since the doorknob was at the height of my shoulder.<br/>
Weird.<br/>
It was also weird that I hadn’t thought more about the size of everything before. Was that some kind of kink? A… pint-sized woman? Maybe there were cameras everywhere and I was being filmed for some kind of pornographic movie about a midget or something. Didn’t they do the same when they were filming The Lord of the Rings?<br/>
…<br/>
Well, not the pornographic part, though.<br/>
Without my consent my eyes moved around, searching for dark corners or anything to possibly harbour a camera really, but came up more or less empty. Still, a shiver was creeping down my spine and I could feel my paranoia on the rise. Was I really being watched? Maybe this was some kind of weird Truman Show. Or maybe not. Or maybe it really was the midget-porn, I hadn’t ruled that one out yet.<br/>
Okay, I REALLY needed to get some perspective and insight here, which wouldn’t happen if I just stayed where I was. So, I opened the first door. It led into a quite unremarkable bathroom, maybe a little outdated. It had a bit of an eighties-flair and looked a bit like the bathroom in my parents’ first apartment, so I didn’t linger. The next door had me stumbling into a broom closet, in which there were also some preserved vegetables and fruit in big glass jars. The next door revealed a room that obviously housed the parents of the girl the room I woke up in belonged to. The next was another bedroom, but really impersonal, so maybe… a guestroom? Opening the next door I stumbled into a living room with an adjacent kitchen. Both rooms were quite dark with lots of wooden furniture and cluttered with knickknacks and pictures of a beautiful brunette woman, a handsome brunette man, who still looked young but obviously had some silver on his temples, and a young brunette girl. The little girl looked a bit like me, as I had, when I had been in preschool – scrawny, a wild mop of brown hair on her head, dark brown eyes, freckles and crooked teeth, not hidden at all by the wide smile. I grinned solemnly. Thank the gods for dentists.<br/>
But yes, that girl and me – we could probably be sisters.<br/>
I froze.<br/>
Even now I did look kind of like her, just older. Had something happened to their daughter and did they want me to fill the void? Well, that would at least be better than my suspicion of midget-porn… But there still was the problem with the too big apartment.<br/>
Thoroughly confused now I trudged back into what I had dubbed as “my” room and sat on the bed, staring at the white wall in front of me.<br/>
The room didn’t really look uninhabited though. The bedsheets looked slept-in, more than once, the desk looked worked-on, not too long ago, the clothes over the chair looked definitely worn, but not as if they had been lying around for longer than a few days…<br/>
…<br/>
The clothes.<br/>
I immediately got up and picked up the clothes. They were a bit old fashioned, but clearly for a young girl. And still, they were the right size to fit me. I scratched my head before I shrugged and decided to try them on. That was the first moment I consciously looked down my own body and… stopped. I actually froze.<br/>
Where were my boobs?<br/>
I… didn’t really have much on that accord, but I definitely had FAR more than that flat expanse of… nothing I was sporting now. My hips, nicely curved before, were about two thirds their former size too, my legs stick-thin… The only thing that matched my actual body was the slim waist.<br/>
Did they… Did they send me through plastic surgery???<br/>
My heartbeat accelerated and my breath came out faster. One never looked the same as before after trying to reverse plastic surgery. Trying to quell my bout of panic, I stumbled into the bathroom and consciously looked into the mirror.<br/>
I stared. Just… stood there and stared, until my stomach churned and I had to empty it into the nearby toilet. Gosh, I felt sick. Quivering I sank to the floor beside the weird square-shaped toilet and tried to keep my hysterics under control. My hands shook. The hands with nails that appeared to be bitten down severely. I hadn’t bitten my nails going on twenty years now.<br/>
I was a child.<br/>
But not just me decades younger. I was the girl in the pictures, with the mop of wavy, unmanageable hair on her head, the dark eyes, the freckles, the crooked teeth. My body had birthmarks I had never seen before, scars I had no idea how they came to be. And I was young. Like… really young. I guessed this body to be about seven or eight years old.<br/>
Had I been like… maybe ten years younger, I might either believe everything happening now a dream or my memories false or planted, but by now, I had a fairly good grip on my mind, so I knew I wasn’t hallucinating, dreaming or whatever, and I knew, I was a nearly 30-year-old in the body of a child. I knew my mind, I knew how to tell apart fantasy from reality, be they sleep- or drug-induced.<br/>
So… I knew. This was real.<br/>
Bloody hell.<br/>
I was a bloody child.</p><p> </p><p>It had taken me a while to come to terms with my situation, but deep breathing-exercises and a quite well developed control over my own mind and emotions, thanks to my martial-arts and archery training, enabled me to calm down significantly and to come up with a plan for the foreseeable future.<br/>
I needed to find out, who that girl was, whose body I was inhabiting right now. I needed to find out, if her parents had anything to do with me being here or if they expected their little girl to remain unchanged, since they had no idea there was somebody else occupying her form. I also needed to gather information about where I was, and, as I started to suspect, when I was. As soon as I’d have a handle on my current situation, I would need to find out how I got here and if there was anything more to me being here than mere coincidence. I was an avid reader and writer of fantasy and Sci-Fi, so the aspect of me being in another time and place was less upsetting than me being a bloody child.<br/>
But first things first.<br/>
A search of “my” room revealed that the girl must also have been an avid reader. Not that I couldn’t have guessed, with the amount of books lying around. But that was good, I loved reading. And as a librarian, I loved being around books in any form anyway. It… didn’t reveal much else though. She seemed to have an interest in everything and read books far above her age, both fiction and non-fiction.<br/>
The chest of drawers didn’t reveal much either. There was a game of Monopoly in there, which didn’t look as if it had been played often, some semiprecious stones, a dried orange rose, a game of dice and one of cards (both looked practically unused), a cream for dry hands (also unused), a screwdriver (a screwdriver???) and some audiocassettes, but nothing to play them with. There also were some buttons and a small sewing-kit that looked unused as well.<br/>
When I opened the pirate-chest, I stopped to blink for a second. It was filled with pillows.<br/>
What the heck?! With eyebrows practically disappearing into my hairline I took one out, turned it around, looked at it from all angles and touched and kneaded it all over, but… nothing. It was a simple pillow.<br/>
Seriously?!<br/>
I put the first pillow away and took out the next one. This one was also… simply a pillow. The next one too. Aaand the next one. Aaand the… Oh, wait! Incredulously I stared at the knife that was hidden on the bottom of the chest. It was… a knife. In a child’s room. And it was quite sharp too, if my bleeding finger was any indication. And… I repeat: IN A CHILD’S ROOM.<br/>
I may have had one or two knives when I had been her age, but they were given to me by my dad to whittle arrows for my self-made bow, not hidden away under bloody PILLOWS. And he had made sure that I knew what I was doing, before he allowed me to run about with them!<br/>
I took out the last pillow and curiously found a little wooden figurine, which – upon closer inspection – turned out to be a rough depiction of a little dragon.<br/>
Hah, the little girl was whittling too! Although far more artsy than anything I had ever attempted. I had to quell a little grin. But… quite obviously it wasn’t a hobby her parents approved of, if her hiding the stuff was any indication.<br/>
Okay, so that was, what I was working with: The girl, whose body I was occupying, loved reading everything she could get her hands on. Otherwise she didn’t appear to have any other interest but whittling, which didn’t seem to be anything her parents would accept. Yeah. That was it. The girl didn’t even seem to be in the habit of writing her name in her schoolbooks or on her notebooks. Instead, she used a number, probably her student-number. That wasn’t really helping. How was I supposed to emulate her if I didn’t even know her name?!<br/>
Oh, wait.<br/>
I jumped up and hastened out. The door that would probably let me out of the apartment stood there unopened as of yet, so I tried the handle, but… nothing. Locked.<br/>
I frowned, until I realized, it had a deadbolt. Grumbling I did the equivalent of a head-desk: a head-door. After realizing that, the door was opened quickly and I stared at the little shield that proclaimed this apartment the property of a family named “Granger”.<br/>
…<br/>
Granger?<br/>
I knew that name. Why did I know that name?<br/>
It really DID sound fami-… Oh.<br/>
A mop of bushy, untameable hair. Books, everywhere one looked. The obvious lack of other interests.<br/>
Oh, wonderful.<br/>
I had always thought her a very flat character, with no more use than being the personal library and research assistant of her friends, and what I had seen of her life ‘till now emphasized that conviction.<br/>
Bloody. Hell. I was Hermione fucking Granger.</p>
