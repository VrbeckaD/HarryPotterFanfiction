    <p>Teddy Lupin was immensely frustrated by one of the classes at Hogwarts. Most of them were interesting and challenging and Teddy could barely get enough of them.</p>
<p>Then, there was History of Magic.</p>
<p>The Professor was a ghost, but that was about the only interesting thing that could be connected to Binns' lessons.</p>
<p>He simply droned on and on, putting most students to sleep.</p>
<p>And Teddy simply could not accept that. History was not only very interesting but also tremendously important! You could learn from the mistakes other people had made and Binns was essentially dooming generations to repeat the mistakes of their ancestors.</p>
<p>No longer. Not if Teddy had anything to say about that.</p>
<p>He spent the History lessons studying their coursebook front to back and, once he was done with that, ordered more books — both magical and muggle — to do the same with.</p>
<p>He would pass the History OWL and NEWT and become the next professor.</p>
<p>There was no stopping him.</p>
