  <b>Uagadou School of Magic</b>
</p><p>
  <b>The Mountains of the Moon</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Uganda, Africa</b>
</p><p>
  <b>September, 1970</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Uagadou School of Magic was far more beautiful than Narcissa Black had expected. It soared up and out of the rugged, scarred palm of the mountain that cradled it, all moonbeam and mist-twined spire and polished white marble. The interior was just as exquisite; every tiny detail as far as the eye could see was utterly perfect in both aesthetic appeal and impact.</p><p>Her mother, Narcissa thought as she seated herself at her assigned place in the gleaming ivory and mother-of-pearl grotto that comprised the dining hall the first night of her arrival, would have adored it. Narcissa herself, after three portkeys, a good hearty sicking up at each stop, and a hot shower at the end of it all, was far more entranced with the wide variety of food placed before her. She had just dished herself up a bowl of fragrant  lentil and sweet potato soup when a deep, rumbling snarl reverberated through her very bones, and ten inches of twisted, sickly yellow wood nearly impaled itself in her throat.</p><p>She ducked just in time. The wand - it was definitely a wand - embedded itself in the wall behind her head. Narcissa straightened and turned, regarding it. It frothed and quivered at her in rage, an acidic black substance oozing from the buried tip. The students around her gawped at it, and her, and at its owner, now striding toward them. Narcissa leaned sideways as the gigantic woman reached over her head, yanked the wand out of the marble wall, and crammed it, shrieking and hissing and snarling, into a hip holster. Shining magical chains wrapped themselves around her waist, binding the thing down.</p><p>"Sorry about that, little miss," the woman addressed Narcissa. Her voice was as resonant and rolling and operatic as one might have expected of someone her size - fully six foot eight inches to Narcissa's five foot six, and at least twenty one stone to the girl's bare eight-and-a-half. "Alright, then?"</p><p>"Well that would depend, wouldn't it." Narcissa was far too well-bred - and proud - to allow her voice to shake, but polite and icy sarcasm, her mother had taught her, was always an acceptable social alternative. "On what the bloody <em> hell </em>!?"</p><p>"Yew," the woman explained. "Bit moody right there, and there's the core of nundu spine to be going on with besides. First night back, formal occasion - the fripperies really offend it, for some reason - lots of  new people about, no body with which to wreak havoc and disease... It's feeling repressed. You're just the most offensive, closest, frippery target." She held out her hand. Her fingers were easily twice as long as Narcissa's own: three times as thick, and paradoxically beautiful.</p><p>"Narcissa Black," the girl introduced herself as she took the fingers properly. Her lip curled ever so slightly at the thing within the rattling chains. "I shall try not to take it personally." The wand growled again.</p><p>"Now, now," the woman said. "Be nice, ladies. Namirembe Obonyo. Welcome to Uagadou, Miss Black."</p><p>"<em>Thank </em>you." This time, the growl was not so much a growl as a snarl, so low and deadly that the floor shook. More than one of the ISEP students shrieked in alarm.  The incumbents looked profoundly unconcerned. "Shut it, bitch."</p><p>She made no attempt to be quiet with it, and the acoustics this high up the mountainside were truly excellent. Abject shock resounded amongst the ISEP students <em> and </em>the incumbents. The massive woman before her looked her up and down as she withdrew her hand and tucked her thumbs in her chain belt.</p><p>"Rude," she observed disapprovingly.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Narcissa said politely. "Were you talking to me, or to your wand?"</p><p>The snarl evolved yet again, to a feral, affronted shriek. Even the teachers look a bit alarmed now. Narcissa just re-seated herself and poured herself a glass of mango juice. It was really quite remarkable, she thought as she sipped, how the pitch there echoed Aunt Walburga on a tear.</p><p>"I gotta ask," Namirembe Obonyo said after a moment. "Do you have a particular grudge against nundus? Because I gotta say, if you do, you might want to work on. You know. Moderating it a bit, empathically speaking, or however you're accustomed to expressing yourself there."</p><p>"I've never met one before, and, poor practice as it is to judge any group by the actions of any given individual, any grudges that I bear are strictly personal. In light of that... May I suggest that you recommend that your friend work on moderating its own methods of self-expression before criticizing my purely reactive, and if I may say so, situationally appropriate,  response? Monstrous, murderous, man-eating, disease-ridden and purely ill-mannered filth will never rate an invitation at any soiree that <em> I </em>host."</p><p>The wand howled, leaping at her once more, or trying to. Obonyo yanked it back, hard, stuffing it deeper in the holster.</p><p>"Eat your dinner, little miss." She turned back to the head table, then turned back. "Excellent reflexes. Do you duel?"</p><p>"No. I do not."</p><p>"You might want to look into it. It's a big bad world out there, and it'll bite your perky little behind if you don't learn to cover it proper..." She bit her tongue. Hard. "Ly."</p><p>Narcissa just reached for her napkin and shook it out. Her new advisor seated herself, discreetly adjusting her wedged knickers as she did so. The girl smiled at her sweetly and cast a  wandless, silent switching spell on the contents of the vial in her pocket and the other woman's glass. She placed the napkin properly over her lap, sipped her juice again, set it down, reached for her spoon...</p><p>
  <em> Three... two... one... </em>
</p><p>And the wand in the holster almost ripped its owner in two, trying to get at her as Obonyo sprouted gigantic pink fairy wings. Chaos, unsurprisingly, ensued... Narcissa just nibbled delicately at a chunk of sweet potato. Eventually, the wings receded. Obonyo said nothing, just continued to eye her narrowly all throughout the feast and the closing speeches.</p><p>The next evening, Narcissa found herself seated in a quite comfortable chair as the enormous woman stared down at her from that full six foot eight inches. The girl looked up inquiringly as she stirred her offered tea. Her new advisor's wand holster, she noted, was empty. A low, disgruntled whine sounded from behind a portrait on the wall behind the desk. Obonyo pulled up a second chair and sat, or rather, sprawled.</p><p>"Appropriate responsive reactions aside, you really do need to work on your attitude, little miss," she observed.</p><p>"How's that?"</p><p>"You're a <em>Black.</em> My wand should be sidling up to you and batting its eyelashes at you and begging for the privilege of warming your bed at night. Instead, it wants to rip your guts out through your cute little asshole."</p><p>"They're not necessarily mutually exclusive ambitions. Quite the opposite, really, I've found." Narcissa reached out and dropped another lump of sugar in her tea. "Go on."</p><p>"It doesn't <em> like </em> you," Obonyo enunciated. "It's a <em> nundu</em>. It doesn't like nice people. It would follow then, wouldn't it, that you must be a nice person. A fundamentally <em> decent </em> person. Your mother would be appalled if she knew, don't you think?"</p><p>"I didn't actually know that were that particular. Nundus, I mean. And that's a rather simplistic perspective, don't you think?"</p><p>"They're not; this one is, and how's that?"</p><p>"I could  either be a nice person, or from its perspective, a dangerous one. A threat. Even the nastiest of individuals may concede that there are vermin about that do no man, or woman, good, no matter their moral orientation." Narcissa sipped the sweet, milky spiced tea. "It's not about good or evil, Professor Obonyo. It's about power and ego. Your wand would like me perfectly well if I were of a temperament that is inclined to validate it in its current form. As things lie, I have no use for it, and it's obviously affronted by the fact."</p><p>"Mm?"</p><p>"There's a tradition in  my particular branch of the Black family," her new student said. "If you embarrass the family in any manner once past school age, your wand is taken from you, and you're fair game till you manage to earn it back." She sat back, crossing her legs neatly and slid her  own wand out of her sleeve, setting it on the table between them. "Oddly enough... It's never occurred to anyone in the family that there's a way around that."</p><p>"Uh huh. How good are you?"</p><p>"Good enough to get through school. Not good enough to get through what's coming after. I intend to improve considerably while I'm here. It is, in fact, why I <em> am </em> here."</p><p>"Ah. Well, I can't help you on that front, I'm afraid. I'm balls at wandless magic."</p><p>"I don't need you to help me learn wandless magic," Narcissa Black said patiently. "They have other people here to do that. I need you to provide me with opportunities to practice it. In context. Discreetly."</p><p>"So you want to learn to duel after all?"</p><p>"Not exactly, no. And... Yes. Precisely."</p><p>Namirembe Obonyo's eyes narrowed at her. The wand in the safe snarled yet again. "Shut up, bitch," the two women said simultaneously.</p><p>"Don't you like your wand?" Narcissa asked curiously.</p><p>"It killed my goat, and everyone I loved along with it, so... No. I do not. Not one little bit."</p><p>"But it still works for you?"</p><p>"It has no choice. I defeated it. It's a bitch, but it's my bitch now."</p><p>"And you don't worry that it has its own agenda?"</p><p>"It's not actually intelligent, little miss. It just retains a bit too much echo of its former attitude for its own good."</p><p>"It tried to stab me in the throat yesterday, and nearly cut you in two trying to get at me when I switched up your drink," Narcissa pointed out. "I'm not saying that intelligence is actually a prerequisite there, but that would seem an indication of conscious, never mind targeted, awareness."</p><p>"We've discussed the matter," Obonyo said coolly. "It won't happen again." She too crossed one leg over the other. "Tell me about your boyfriend."</p><p>"Why would I want to do that?"</p><p>"Because I want to know."</p><p>"I'm not here to talk about him. And he's not your concern anyway, or your business."</p><p>"No? That's why you're doing all  this, isn't it? For his sake?" She reached into a drawer and slapped a file on the desk, flipping it. "Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, son of Abraxas Publius Malfoy and Callida Burgess-Waites Malfoy, sixteen this past July and currently on location at Castelobruxo School in Brazil." She removed a photo and examined it. "Mm. He <em> is </em> a pretty bit, isn't he?  Pretty, magically gifted, amiable, rich, well-connected, and oh yes, there's that lovely career in politics waiting once he graduates. I've heard he's not a bad duelist at all either. All that <em> and </em>he's genuinely in love with you? I've said it before and I'll say it again, some girls have all the luck." She tucked the photo away, turned a page, and turned it back before closing the folder. "So?"</p><p>"You seem to have everything covered there. Anything I could add would just take time away from matters concerning. Never mind, as I said, that he's a matter that doesn't concern you."</p><p>Namirembe Obonyo set the folder aside and leaned forward.</p><p>"If you want me to help you, Miss Black," she said. "Everything that you are concerned with concerns me."</p><p>Narcissa said nothing. The enormous woman sighed, leaned back again, and scratched her chin.</p><p>"I get it. You're trying to protect him, and you don't know who you can trust and who you can't. Who you can count on as an ally, and as it's a delicate situation and will continue to be so, and as I, more than obviously, am not the delicate sort, you think that I'm a short-term proposition at best. Nothing worthwhile: nothing that it's safe to cultivate long term because I'm about as subtle as this mountain we're sitting on, and some wars are best fought with subtlety and some wars aren't, and this one... Well. It shouldn't be my area of expertise, should it?"</p><p>Still, Narcissa said nothing.</p><p>"Here's the thing about mountains, little miss," Obonyo said. "They make really big messes when you drop them on things. Sometimes, the mess is the entire point. Sometimes, the point is just to make the point that you're powerful enough to manage it. If you don't want to make the point of the fact that you've got that kind of power, though, there's something there that you need to internalize straight up. Or rather... That you have internalized, and you think I haven't."</p><p>"What's that?"</p><p>"That it doesn't take power in the first place. At all."</p><p>"Explain," Narcissa ordered.</p><p>"Every avalanche that starts on every mountain and brings it down," Namirembe Obonyo explained. "Begins with a single, small, properly placed stone. Easy enough job, you place the stone, and sit back and wait while nature, time, tide, and human nature does the rest, right? And you're thinking on your boy as your stone. No, no. Don't deny it. That's why you're trying to distract me on the subject; you don't want me looking at him. But while you're drawing attention away from him... You're missing the point entirely."</p><p>"What would that be."</p><p>"That as Riddle's chosen to approach his goal in a very certain way - to split his resources in order to reinforce what he thinks of as his potential power base - he is - you are - working with two mountains, not one. The one that relies on his ability to display power, and the other that relies on social respectability to reinforce it once he's got it. To slip it by people on the political level, just in case brute force fails him. He thinks he's covering all of his bases. In a way he is... But that leaves you with two stones to place, not one, doesn't it?"</p><p>Narcissa blinked at her.</p><p>"You're talking about my sister," she said. "Bellatrix."</p><p>"Try again."</p><p>"The baby," she said slowly. "The baby that they'll have together. Once it's born, there'll be no going back."</p><p>"No," her advisor agreed. "And dropping mountains on innocent children never ends well. So... Alternative solutions?"</p><p>"I have to make sure there are no babies," Narcissa Black said. "In the first place. Without a baby... He's got nothing. Not on the social mountain. And if Luke is placed to take down the second, while he's distracted by the first..."</p><p>"O for you. Is she fucking him yet?"</p><p>"Erhm. What?"</p><p>"Your sister. Is she fucking Riddle."</p><p>"No. The baby has to be conceived after the wedding date, so that no one can claim that it's not a legally biological Lestrange."</p><p>"When's the big day?"</p><p>"Midsummer next."</p><p>"Excellent." She reached into her drawer and pulled out a small bag. "Welcome to Africa, Miss Black."</p><p>Narcissa took the bag and opened it. Inside was an abundance of small, dried red pellets.</p><p>"A berry a day keeps the babies away," Obonyo informed her. "Non-magical, non magically traceable. There's a seed packet in the bottom; you're a bit of a gardener, I understand?"</p><p>"Why?" she said bluntly.</p><p>"I don't believe in sitting around and waiting on certain types of issues. You're hardly the only ISEP student ever to come to Uagadou out of Hogwarts, and there've been quite a few traveling the road in the opposed direction as well. Quite a few, going back quite a number of years, and observations have been made. Observations made, trends  tracked, projections projected.. It doesn't exactly take a genius to realize that Riddle doesn't plan to stop at Europe, and I can tell you right now, no details, but it's going to be almost impossible to bring him down personally. It will take, in fact, an act of God. All it's going to take to bring certain of his key <em> plans </em> down, on the other hand, is a bushful of berries, a girl who loves a boy, a boy who loves a girl, and a whole shitload of good planning to carry you both through till God gets off His ass and decides it's time to get the job done."</p><p>Narcissa's eyes narrowed at her.</p><p>"I don't suppose," she said. "That you have any personal acquaintances at Castelobruxo? Acquaintances who happen to share your personal perspectives on prevention and resolution?"</p><p>"I know a lot of people, little miss, and those people know a lot of people, and that lot knows another lot, and so on down the line. I also know that looking past the end of your own nose isn't an encouraged habit where you've grown up, that the world is both a lot smaller and a lot bigger than you've ever imagined, and that cultivating acquaintances and resources beyond those in immediate eye-shot is a surprisingly useful hobby.”</p><p>Narcissa said nothing. Obonyo watched as she stirred a third lump of sugar silently into her tea, and sighed internally.</p><p>“It’s not an insult,” she said, surprisingly gently. “Or at least… I’m not insulting you. I know how you were brought up, and the kind of expectations you’ve got laid on you as the third daughter of House Black - that is to say, not a single one. You’re a luxury. Unnecessary. Decorative, even.  What does it say that your sisters were named after constellations, after all, and you a flower? You can make it work for you though. You’re going to have to make it work for you, because you're not going to have the luxury of sitting around and flowering prettily once Riddle’s in proper position, even once your sister is taken care of. Winning the war is one thing, but if you really love that boy of yours, and you want to be sure that he doesn't go down with the mountain while you sit back with your fingers crossed and hope for the best, you're going to have to <em>be</em> the rest. Nature, time, tide... All of it."</p><p>"Am I your stone, then?"</p><p>"No," her advisor said. "And yes. I won't say it's not personal, but I'm in no position to take care of things myself, see? So it's all going to be on you. It's all you. Nature, time, tide... Wherever your enemy looks, there you'll be. And he'll never see you coming. By the time I'm done with you, he'll never see you at all. No one will."</p><p>"Aren't you supposed to be a proponent of the straightforward approach?" Narcissa asked, off-balance.</p><p>"I am, but this isn't the kind of war that will - can - be won by the straightforward approach, as I said, and as I'm also a proponent of winning, we're just going to have to mix things up a bit."</p><p>"You said it's personal. Do you know Riddle, then?"</p><p>"I've never met him, if that's what you mean, but I can recognize him for what he is. He's not a nundu," her advisor said. "But he's got a nundu's soul, if you want to call it that, and lives to spread death, disease and destruction as effectively as any nundu could, wherever he goes. It's just his nature, just as it is your oldest sister’s. And did you know... The one thing a nundu won't attack is another nundu? They just team up and…” She gestured.</p><p>Narcissa's eyes widened.</p><p>"Mm," Namirembe confirmed. "Might want to have a word with your boy at some point, and let him know that it'd be best to downplay my reputation should his boss-to-be ever ask him how much help he thinks I could be to the cause. We straightforward types, we tend to be vulnerable to spells such as the <em>Imperius</em> curse; we just don't have the mental subtlety to duck and dodge in the moment, and with not one, but potentially two International Dueling Masters on his team, never mind my Animagus form, and Sweet-Tooth here -" she nodded to her wand. "Yeah, we'll want to avoid that."</p><p>"Why  don't you just break it? That'd get rid of the one problem, at least."</p><p>"It's a bit more complicated than that. Also, far too late.That page has turned, and now... Now we're stuck with the road we're all on, for better or worse. It's got to play out."</p><p>"I have no idea what you're talking about."</p><p>"No. I know. It's better that way."</p><p>"And I'm just supposed to trust you on that?"</p><p>"It's not about trusting me, Miss Black. It's about trusting yourself, and your instincts." The huge woman perched on the edge of her massive desk. "Riddle me this, before you go. Why do you think - <em> really </em> think - my wand hates you so much? Hates you enough to rip me literally in half to get at you?"</p><p>Narcissa frowned at her... Her eyes widened till they took up half her face. She looked at the safe on the wall, then at the  woman before her.</p><p>"It killed every single person in my tribe." Namirembe Obonyo confirmed. "Every single one but me. I was fifteen. I didn't know shit on what I was doing when I ripped its spine out and took it back to the tree where I'd buried them all, and dug out a root - not a branch, but a root; it does make a rather significant difference, as it turns out - and imprisoned it inside. Well, I did know what I was doing, but I didn't care. Not in the given moment, anyway. Grief does funny things to the mind, you know?"</p><p>"It’s <em> Dark? </em> I mean… You bound it to you with <em> Dark magic </em>?"</p><p>"There were no rituals involved, but the effects were - are - the same, yes. Yew: the power of life and death, the originating tree fed on the blood of my family, and the murderer imprisoned within the root... It's enslaved to my blood now. My blood and my magic. It serves me, but that doesn't mean it's resigned to the fact. It's always on the lookout for its true match."</p><p>"It thinks I'm its true match?"</p><p>"Who knows. It senses your potential, anyway - a match in power, if a complementary one, for mine, and yes, maybe even that latent streak of insanity in your core. Probably that; it’s drawn like a magnet to that sort of thing. But  you're rejecting it straight up because you have no use for wands, do you? It's pulled to you, but you're pushing it away, automatically, and it's a little bit upset for the fact."</p><p>"So its response is to  try to kill me?"</p><p>"It might not be intelligent, but it's not quite sane either. It'd frankly rather see you dead than deal with the agony of chronic hope and inevitable rejection. If it could kill me in the process... Well. That'd just be a bonus, wouldn't it?"</p><p>"I'd never allow myself to bond with something like that,” Narcissa said firmly. "Never. That being said… Am I going to be warding off assassination attempts all year?"</p><p>"No. It'll snarl and bitch and whine and inflate itself threateningly at you - nundus do that - but past Christmas again, once you've completely lost the ability to focus your magic through an external source, it'll likely lose interest and go back to trying to puncture my eyeballs in my sleep again."</p><p>"Lost... Erhm. What?"</p><p>“You've never taken wandless magic formally, so you wouldn't know. Past the point of efficiency, a certain number of people can't use a wand any more. You literally become your own wand, with your magical core<em> as </em>your core.  I'd say, given your demonstrated technique at dinner, and your lack of formal training again, you're likely close to passing that point already. By Christmas... I'd say by Christmas, that little jewel you carry isn't going to be good for anything more than stirring potions.”</p><p>"Are you absolutely <em> certain </em> on that?"</p><p>"No," Namirembe Obonyo said. "But at least you won't have to worry about Sweet-Tooth there climbing into bed with you and snuggling up to your core against your will."</p><p>"I<em> will </em> break it," the girl said grimly. "If it even <em>thinks</em> about it." She eyed the safe disdainfully. "It's not wand enough for me anyway. It's what, ten inches at most? I am afraid it just doesn't meet my standards, never mind that nasty bit of a drainage problem it displayed at dinner last night. There are potions for that sort of thing, did you know?" She paused. "What would happen if it did break?"</p><p>"I don't know," Obonyo said. "It's not about..." She rubbed her ear. "Everything happens for a reason," she said. “If certain things happen before their time... If you try to force them, for the sake of the good and without the proper measures in place... No good can come of it. Everything is connected, little miss. Everything and everyone.”</p><p>“And that’s all you’re giving me to be going on with?”</p><p>“That’s everything. The rest is just spotting the patterns.” Namirembe Obonyo rose to her feet and went to the safe. "I'm going to open the door now," she said to the wand within. "And you <em> will </em> control yourself, or I <em> will </em>break your spine in two, the consequences bedamned.  As it's the only part of you left, consider this... Would it really be worth it?'</p><p>"Don't take this the wrong way," Narcissa said, watching as she began to slide the bolts back. "But even if you don't break it, why don't you just get a back-up?"</p><p>"I can't. The women in my family can only bond with one wand at a time, we have to hunt down the core sources ourselves, and the wood always come from the single tree that grows over our family cemetery."</p><p>"You said you're not really bonded, though."</p><p>"Oh, we are. The ties that bind us just aren't particularly traditional." She opened the safe and grabbed. The wand screamed in rage as she rammed it into the wrist holster and activated the magical chains that held it within. "You given any thought to trying for the Animagus transformation?"</p><p>"No." It was perfectly true. She hadn't given it any thought. Trying for the Animagus transformation had been a given in her book since she'd first read about it when she was eight years old. She'd been actively working on it for a year now, since the day of her first fifth year Potions class, when, as a newly assigned prefect, she'd gained after-hours access to the senior labs at Hogwarts, and, coincidentally, the contents of the restricted ingredients cupboard. That last, of course, wasn't exactly licit, but Professor Slughorn had given Lucius, as one of the top three Potions students in any year, access privileges since Christmas of the year before, and as he'd chosen his password on her suggestion, she now had access to everything she needed to prepare the noxious concoctions needed to convince her core of the necessary particulars.</p><p>"Why not?" her new advisor asked, returning to her desk.</p><p>"I prefer Charms over Transfiguration. And you never know what you're going to get, do you? All that effort, and who knows what's waiting on the other side?"</p><p>"This is very true," Obonyo conceded, and blurred, rearing up and hurtling forward, stopping not two inches from the girl's nose. Narcissa reached up, placed a single finger on the precise center of the enormous tigress' forehead and pushed back firmly. Obonyo blurred back.</p><p>"You've got one hell of a poker face," she observed. "Most people wet themselves when they see me do that for the first time, especially close up."</p><p>"Do they? How very unpleasant."</p><p>Obonyo snorted with laughter. "You're alright, little miss. Alright. Toddle off now; Professor Nami's got loads of paperwork to do, and an absolute lack of inclination to be going on with her deadlines there."</p><p>"Professor Nami should hire a student secretarial assistant," Narcissa observed as she rose. "If she truly dislikes that aspect of her position that much. It would give Professor Nami the opportunity to tutor the student secretarial assistant in a socially approved context."</p><p>"Aren't you clever!" Professor Nami said mock-admiringly. "Though as it happens, Professor Nami already has context lined up for you. It's called 'your first assignment is to make your roommate hate your pretty little ass so much that she requests a transfer out by the end of the week.'"</p><p>"What? Why?"</p><p>"A girl needs privacy to practice her wandless magic, never mind that her boy's how many oceans away?"</p><p>"Lovely, Professor. Really."</p><p>"Aaaand there goes the poker face. Aren't you adorable when you blush!" She pinched her cheek. "Almost as adorable as your boy. The two of you just have the market cornered on adorability, don't you? Your babies are going to be just precious. I might even agree to be godmother if you were to ask nicely enough."</p><p>“I might even consider it,” Narcissa responded sweetly. “If<em> you </em> were to ask nicely enough.”</p><p>“Save it for your roommate,” her advisor advised. “Though you might want to up the curled lip a notch or two with it. And sniff. Sniffing’s always good.” She slapped her wand, hard, as it demonstrated the suggested action in a revoltingly liquid manner, and proceeded to leak semi-congealed utterly foul smelling yellowish-brown liquid all over its mistress’s black leather trousers.</p><p>“Right then,” Obonyo said. “Back the safe with you. Dealing with your crap is one thing, but… Mm. On the other hand, do you know, it really, really isn’t?” The safe slammed and sealed, cutting of the ear-wincing shrill squeal of outrage.  Narcissa cast a discreet and prudent wandless cleaning charm.</p><p>“Does it do that often?” she inquired.</p><p>“No, if only because when it does, I lock it up and make it sit in it. It’s trying to impress you.”</p><p>“It thinks that would <em> impress </em>me?”</p><p>“<em>Nun. </em> Du,” the other woman enunciated. “Bat. Shit. In. <em> Sane</em>. Study hard, little miss. The faster you learn, the faster it’ll lose interest.”</p><p>Narcissa said nothing more, just exited the room, closing the door gently behind her. She glanced around, and as no one was in sight, slumped against the wall, pressing her fingers to her nose.</p><p>“And to think I came here in the hopes of leaving all the shit behind me,” she muttered as she pushed herself up. “Never mind the insanity, and all the great leaking wankers constantly up my arse. Lucius, you had best, I repeat <em> best</em>, be having a good enough time for both of us…”</p><p> </p>
