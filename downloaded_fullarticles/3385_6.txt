    <p>Death wreaked all around the small village as the fire started consuming everything in its path. The screams of the innocent rang as they tried to find a way out of the burning nightmare.</p><p>What was once the middle ground for Ravenclaw and Slytherin was now a living hell for those trapped within it. </p><p>The burning was a warning, a warning to those all across the world that as long as Riddle was alive, no one would be safe.</p><p>________</p><p>“Did you hear-“</p><p>“The village was completely burned down.”</p><p>“I heard there were no survivors” </p><p>“Oh what’s become of this world—”</p><p>Word spread quickly about the burning of the small village that once rested in between Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Many of the villagers were afraid and so were the people that ruled. </p><p>King James was a considerable ruler. He listened to the concerns of his people and the input of those around him. Before making a decision he would always contribute his friends, Sirius Remus, and wife, Lily. He also tended to be careless every now and then and was seen as a more casual leader compared to the people around him.</p><p>But James was visibly tensed throughout the whole council meeting discussing the growing danger of the Slytherin kingdom which was now in the control of a cruel and brutal ruler, Tom Riddle. Within his first few months of ruling, he managed to kill over 40 people, 43 to be exact, and fear of the man spread like a wildfire.</p><p>“We must expand the military and we need to do it soon! We don’t know when this mad man will attack” Rolland Cooper, one of the representatives of the common people, exclaimed.</p><p>“We need to evacuate the villages near the Slytherin-Gryffindor border! They’ve attacked Ravenclaw and once they’re done with them they’ll go back to us!” Somar Oppec, another member of the council, said.</p><p>“We will not cower like cowards!”</p><p>“There won’t be enough time!“</p><p>“Okay, okay enough!” James slapped his hand on the wooden table which made the two men go silent. “We will achieve nothing with all of this bickering. Now let’s discuss how we can prevent attacks in a civilized manner.”</p><p>_____________</p><p>“So how were the soul suckers?” A voice asked as James walked into his study and plopped down in his chair. He looked and saw one of his best friends, Sirius, sitting on the chair in front of his desk.</p><p>“It was terrible. We barely got anything done.” James ran his hand down his face and groaned. “Where’s Remus?”</p><p>“He’s in town visiting family.”</p><p>“Oh.” The two stayed quiet for a while before Sirius spoke up again. </p><p>“Fancy a game?”</p><p>After hours of playing chess (more or less chess with their own rules) he two friends stopped and James started to look through all the documents on his desk. </p><p>He picked up his quill and sighed, “God help me.”</p><p>When he started working on all the paperwork the sun was still shining into the room, but when he finished, the only light that shone originated from the moon. He dropped the quill onto the table and rubbed his hand, soothing the cramps that started to form from all the writing. </p><p>Suddenly a soft knock caught his attention. The door of his study opened and a woman with red hair walked in, closing the door behind her. </p><p>“You didn’t come down for dinner,” she said as she walked towards him.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t realize how late it was getting—”</p><p>“I asked Molonia to bring in food later tonight.” She ran a hand through his curls since he was currently sitting down, creating an advantage for her. </p><p>“Lily,” he sighed and leaned back into his chair, “God, things aren’t going well. Everything’s turning into a shit storm.” </p><p>“You could say that again…” Lily leaned on his desk and crossed her arms. Silence filled the room once again but for a strange reason, the silence comforted him. Lily pushed her body off the desk and grabbed his hand, gently pulling it. “Come on, let’s get going.”</p><p>They both walked towards their shared bed chambers, something that isn’t too common in the nobility world. The two whispered to each other as they bumped shoulders and giggled as if they were teenagers again and had no care in the world.</p>
