          <div class="userstuff"><p>The shooting star that careers through the night sky and crashes, quite spectacularly, into the muddy lake is not, in fact, a shooting star. The man that pushes open the emergency hatch and hauls himself, gasping and wheezing, onto the ruptured ship is not, in fact, a man. And the emergency response comm he aims at the stars and swears at in a harsh and alien language is not, in fact, <em>working</em>.</p>
<p>Graves would like very much to know <em>which</em> utter dipshit in Transfers had managed to screw up his warp jump quite this badly and whether Graves was allowed to throw them out of an airlock when he got back.</p>
<p>Then the heavens open and Graves discovers that the delightful little planet in the middle of delightful fucking nowhere has a working water cycle, one that brings with it a great deal of cold, a side helping of misery, and a whopping dollop of wet.</p>
<p>Oh, and apparently when he crashed he broke several ribs, fried the electrical connections to his left knee, and rolled in a pile of broken glass. Grand.</p>
<p>He retreats into his broken spaceship and cannibalises a control panel to fix his knee. It… mostly works. That done, he digs through enough old textbooks to identify where he is (backwater, uncivilised, and uncontacted - glorious), what language he needs to program into the translator (there are a ridiculous number to choose from, more than any one planet should reasonably need; he goes for the first seven in the list and hopes that’s enough) and what basic field-notes he needs to add to his mental database (far too many, most of them gathered from a distance, at least half of them marked with question marks and sounding blatantly ridiculous). And, because he’s currently hurting and light-headed, he says screw it to health and safety and just uploads the whole lot at once. The resulting headache has him staggering into the wall, missing the wall and tumbling through the breach in the hull, flailing and half drowning his way through the lake, and fetching up somewhere on the bank. And he’s still getting rained on.</p>
<p>“Fuck this planet,” he coughs through a mouthful of lake-water, and faints.</p>
<p>He manages, somehow, to survive undrowned until morning and it’s Newt that finds him, sprawled unconscious in the mud. Well, Niffler that finds him, Newt that scrambles after Niffler and almost trips over him in the process, but that’s just semantics, really. Newt’s the one that asks, hesitantly, if he’s alive; when he doesn’t get a response, Newt’s the one that manhandles him into the case and cleans his wounds as best he can.</p>
<p>When Graves rejoins the land of the living, Newt’s the one who stutters to a halt, blushes lithium red, and throws a sheet his way while backtracking pronto out of the room.</p>
<p>“I’ll get clothes!” he squeaks from halfway up the suitcase ladder. “There’s food in the kitchen, see you soon, don’t let Niffler out thank you bye!”</p>
<p>Graves blinks. “Illgetclothes,” he repeats. “Thankyoubye.” Then, switching back to a more familiar language, “Identify and translate. Please.”</p>
<p>Whirr. Beep. Whirr whirr. Ding! <em>English,</em> the text across his vision reads. <em>Activate real time translate Y/N</em></p>
<p>Feck it. The headache can’t get worse. “Activate,” he agrees. “Yes, that means yes. Yes. Activate - Y. I want the Y option.”</p>
<p>
  <em>Activating real time translate. Target language: English. Please note minor vocal edits required for accurate pronunciation.</em>
</p>
<p>“Minor vocal what now - <em>glerk.</em>” Graves lifts a hand to his throat, frowning the disturbed and confused frown of someone who’s just had their voice box rearranged without sufficient warning. And, from the feel of it, the back of his throat as well. Maybe? He opens and closes his mouth a few times to get used to the new sensations. “That will never not be weird,” he mutters to himself. It comes out in English and translates itself back into real words by the time his ears pass it back to his brain and the double-overlap does exactly squat for his headache.</p>
<p>Graves predicts direly that he’s going to hate this planet and distracts himself by turning his attention to what’s around him.</p>
<p>The room is soft, muted colours with strongly yellow-orange tinted lighting. The basic set-up is surprisingly familiar - he doesn’t need the fieldnotes ticking over in the back of his mind to identify that he’s on a bed, or that the primary building material is some kind of local plant matter. The assorted objects strewn around the room are less familiar and Graves takes a minute to run through the new words that flash up for each one (<em>chair</em> is obvious, but what’s <em>book</em> or <em>slippers</em> and why does the door have <em>handle</em> is that the keypad? There’s no control panel on it, and this place really doesn’t look advanced enough for motion sensing so what?)</p>
<p>Bored with the room, he turns back to himself. He’s wearing a clean bandage, wrapped tight around his chest, and part of him wants to unravel it to see how his back is doing underneath. It hadn’t seemed so bad, but he <em>had</em> passed out so there was a potential that one of his internal systems was wonky; based on what he’d seen so far of the planet it was doubtful the Earth-inhabitant who found him had known how to fix them. On the other hand, he feels surprisingly fine for a ship-wreck survivor.</p>
<p>He rests a hand on the neatly tucked end of the dressing for a long moment before shaking his head. “Food,” he says instead. “Food, kitchen, no niffler.” They seem simple enough instructions to follow.</p>
<p><em>Error</em>, the translator warns. <em>No entry for “Niffler”. Update dictionary when possible.</em></p>
<p><em>Error,</em> the fieldnotes warn. <em>Nudity detected. Local customs require nudity to be dealt with before proceeding.</em></p>
<p>Graves groans.</p>
<p>It takes some trial and error to work out what, exactly, the nudity problem entails, but he finally narrows it down to his lower back and the tops of his legs. That sorted, he winds the sheet round his waist and shuffles his way out of the bedroom into what is either a kitchen or a health hazard, or quite possibly both. The field notes haven’t yet given him the intricate understanding of Earth culture he needs to tell the difference, but there’s something about the haphazard way pans and bottles and jars are stacked on the shelves that seems a bit unstable to him. He proceeds with caution.</p>
<p>After about five minutes of careful study he slumps down on a stool and confesses to himself that he has no idea what he’s looking for. The small four-legged creature that had followed him around the kitchen hauls herself onto the table and tips her head with a curious chirp, and Graves decides, somewhat desperately, that she looks like she might know.</p>
<p>“What,” he asks her, “What, precisely, is food?”</p>
<p>She chirps. It’s not English. Life wouldn’t be that simple.</p>
<p>“Identify,” Graves says tiredly. “Translate. Please.”</p>
<p>
  <em>Language not supported. Download new language Y/N</em>
</p>
<p>“Screw it, why not.”</p>
<p>Four and a half minutes later, with a headache to rival a nova-shot hangover, Graves repeats his question.</p>
<p><em>Lots of things,</em> the creature answers with a series of drawn out squeaks. <em>Things that smell nice. Things that look nice. Things you want to eat.</em></p>
<p>Ah. Fuel. Graves reaches for the nearest bottle of thing that smells nice. He thinks. He doesn’t have much to compare it to, not of Earth smells, and it’s very different from anything he’s familiar with. It looks nice, that at least he’s more certain on, but <em>wanting to eat</em> is a stage he and the unfamiliar food-fuel haven’t yet reached in their relationship.</p>
<p>“Is this food?” he asks.</p>
<p>The creature wrinkles her nose. <em>Not for me,</em> she says, and Graves nearly puts it back - <em>but Mummy eats strange things. It could be food.</em></p>
<p>Mummy, Graves assumes, is the blushing human. He squints at the bottle. It’s labelled, and it takes a second for the unfamiliar script to resolve itself into something Graves can read. <em>Lavender,</em> it says, which the fieldnotes classify as<em> colour</em> and <em>plant</em>. Graves squints further. How can a colour be bottled. Electromagnetic radiation doesn’t listen to cork stoppers. Are the fieldnotes sure about this.</p>
<p><em>Plant,</em> the fieldnotes insist petulantly, and Graves allows that ‘colour’ may be a translation error - he’s stuffed a lot of data into his brain in the last eighteen hours, he can’t expect it all to go right. Plants, though. Plants are carbon. Carbon is a (primitive, but workable) energy source. Plants are probably food.</p>
<p>“Bottoms up,” he mumbles, and removes the stopper.</p>
<p>Lavender, he decides, is a bit dry, a bit difficult to swallow - and yes, he can now confirm that his throat has <em>definitely</em> been modified to speak English, he’s only glad it didn’t need further modification to speak the small creature’s squeaking language as well - but other than that, perfectly good enough. He toasts the creature with his bottle, and she makes a hopeful gesture at the door and asks if Graves is going out.</p>
<p>“Ah,” Graves guesses. “Niffler. Mummy said not to let you out.”</p>
<p><em>Mummy’s a killjoy,</em> Niffler grumbles, and crawls her way into Graves lap to curl up and sulk. Graves shrugs; Mummy has also taken him in and, from the feel of his back, poured far too much time and effort into healing him. Even his hastily-repaired knee feels better. He’s happy enough to keep Niffler in the kitchen if that’s all Mummy asks in payment.</p>
<p>He’s two thirds of the way through the lavender by the time Newt returns.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Newt calls from somewhere down a corridor. “Are you in the - oh, hello, potions lab. That’s. That’s fine. Hello.”</p>
<p>Graves smiles. It feels awkward. Are smiles always awkward? Maybe he’ll ask Niffler later. “I found food,” he says, holding up the mostly empty bottle of dried lavender.</p>
<p>Newt manfully holds his tongue about <em>potions ingredients</em> and <em>food</em> and <em>not really quite the same</em>. “I found clothes,” he replies, holding out the bundle. Graves puts the lavender aside and stands up to take them, toppling Niffler to the floor as he does so.</p>
<p>Naturally, she digs in her claws and takes the sheet with her.</p>
<p>Newt <em>eeps</em>, bright red again as he all but throws the clothes at Graves. “Wasn’t sure about your size, hope you like them, do you want tea I’ll put the kettle on kitchen down the hall,” he babbles, and flees.</p>
<p>Graves stares at the empty doorway, completely bemused. “Mummy is odd,” he tells Niffler.</p>
<p><em>Well obviously,</em> she grumps, wriggling backwards out of the sheet. <em>He’s Mummy. It’s what he does.</em></p>
<p>Graves absorbs the new information while he struggles his way into the clothes. Unlike the sheet, they don’t seem willing to stay if he wraps them round, and there seem to be too many of them for the number of limbs he has. What, he wants to know, is wrong with skin-tight nano suits. Who thought clothes were a better idea and are they still alive for Graves to explain why exactly they’re not. “Fieldnotes,” he finally says. “Help?”</p>
<p>The fieldnotes give him a barrage of images. The translator helpfully annotates each one; <em>petticoat, gauntlet, jumpsuit, scuba tank.</em></p>
<p>“Ok. Niffler. Clothes go how?”</p>
<p>She grumbles something about clothes being ridiculous (Graves privately agrees) but manages to talk him through the way Mummy wears clothes until they make some vague amount of sense.</p>
<p>Buttons, on the other hand, do not. Graves admits defeat and gives up. The trousers probably <em>are</em> the right size but without the buttons done up they hang low and almost falling off his hips; as for the shirt, Graves is lucky to have worked out the arm holes but he leaves the front open over his bandaged chest.</p>
<p>The belt, he abandons. No clue. Some sort of restraint, a collar of some kind? The fieldnotes suggest using it to tie his hands to a bedpost which seems highly counterproductive. He’ll ask later.</p>
<p>Niffler paws imperiously at his bare foot until he bends down and lets her climb to his shoulder. <em>Get me a sugar cube,</em> she demands. <em>Mummy puts them in tea. I want one.</em></p>
<p>“More food?” Graves asks. <em>Sugarcane</em> the translator tells him is another plant, as is <em>sugar beet</em> but there doesn’t seem to be an entry for <em>sugar cube</em>.</p>
<p><em>You won’t like them,</em> Niffler hurries to tell him. <em>Kitchen is through that door.</em></p>
<p>Graves hums and follows. He suspects he may have to try a sugar cube for himself before he decides if he’ll like it or not.</p>
<p>“Hello Mummy,” he says politely as he comes into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Newt spins round with wide eyes, takes in Graves’ rather lax approach to getting dressed, and brandishes a teapot in distress.</p>
<p>Graves pauses and frowns, confused. He has clothes. He’s found the kitchen (it’s not much less of a hazard than the potions lab). He’s not yet let Niffler escape. He’s not sure what’s wrong, but Newt is bright red again, and all but hyperventilates as Graves steps nearer to cage him against the counter.</p>
<p><em>Error</em>, the fieldnotes protest. <em>Data suggests current breathing method is inefficient. Lack of oxygen fatal to earth residents.</em></p>
<p>“What are you doing,” Newt asks in a rushed, high pitched breath.</p>
<p>Graves presses their foreheads together. Newt’s skin feels hot against his, even moreso than their different biology can account for. <em>Fever</em>, the translator supplies worriedly. <em>Sign of sickness and ill health. </em>Then the fieldnotes chime in with increasing panic: <em>Error: sickness leads to death. Reduce fever where possible.</em></p>
<p>“I’m helping,” Graves says out loud to all three of them, and modulates his skin temperature to be cool and soothing. It costs more energy than he’d hoped and it’s unnerving to see the proof of how weak he is, but when he leans back Newt’s sudden fever is gone.</p>
<p>He’s still flushed, and now his pupils are wide and his breathing has stopped altogether. The fieldnotes begin to bleep in distress but the translator shushes them. <em>Earth phrase identified: take my breath away,</em> it says soothingly, to which the fieldnotes start shrilling about giving it back. Graves deems him probably not in danger anymore and nods in satisfaction as he steps away.</p>
<p>“Better?” he asks.</p>
<p>“Newt,” Newt blurts (<em>semi-aquatic, pond dwelling, small creature similar in size to a finger</em>), which is an odd thing to answer with, but then he goes on to clarify, “My name is Newt.”</p>
<p><em>He lies,</em> Niffler says. <em>His name is Mummy. Don’t believe him.</em></p>
<p>Newt seems a lot larger than a finger, but he was near a lake when he found Graves so Graves elects to ignore Niffler in this. “My name is unpronounceable on your planet and may vibrate your vocal chords to shreds if you tried,” he says to Newt. “But I don’t mind if you call me Graves.”</p>
<p>Newt stares for a long moment. “Ok,” he finally says. “Graves. Ok. Vibrate my - ok, that’s. Ok.”</p>
<p>Graves smiles, and, potentially, it’s less awkward than before. Maybe. Graves is working on it.</p>
<p>Niffler pokes him in the ear and comes dangerously close to short circuiting his auditory processors. <em>Sugar cubes,</em> she reminds him.</p>
<p>Graves scans the table for <em>something Mummy puts in tea</em> and solemnly hands her a teaspoon.</p>
<p><em>It’s ok</em>, she says, patting his hand. <em>You’ll learn.</em></p></div>
