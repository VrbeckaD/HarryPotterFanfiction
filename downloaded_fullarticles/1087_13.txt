    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m going to kill you, Harry Potter. I’m going to destroy you. After tonight, no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight, if they speak of you they’ll speak only of how you begged for death. And I, being a merciful lord, obliged.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His body is aching. Voldemort’s calm, measured words ring in Harry’s ears over and over as he holds his wand with both hands, struggling to keep his footing. The blinding light of the conjoined spells keep him from seeing Voldemort, but he can hear the wizard shouting at his Death Eaters. The sickly, bright green of the Avada Kedavra gets closer, the red of the Expelliarmus fading as Harry strains with all his might, fighting for his life even as he feels his magic weakening the longer he keeps the spell up. Voldemort stands opposite him, sure and confident, laughing victoriously already. Harry pants heavily, feeling sweat beading on his brow from the exertion and he is sure this is it. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>This is it</em>. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After all, he may have defeated Voldemort as a baby, but now his mother’s protection is null and void - <em>thank you very much, Wormtail</em> - and Voldemort is back in human form and at full strength. Harry really has no chance now. Still, he holds on for all he is worth, thinking of his family, his friends, Hogwarts. He has to try, for them and for his parents’ sake. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He is mine!” Voldemort shouts triumphantly. “The Boy Who Lived will be no more!” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry groans under the strain of the spells locked together and knows he can hold it no longer. His Expelliarmus is almost non-existent now. He closes his eyes in preparation for the world beyond this one when suddenly he feels his feet leave the ground and he is flying through the air, arms flailing and hand still clenched tightly around his wand. He lands several feet from where he had been standing just a few short moments ago, breathless, his body screaming in pain from the impact and from the Crucio Voldemort had hit him with earlier. Eyes flying open, he scans the graveyard desperately, wondering why he is still alive and what on earth interrupted the duel. The Death Eaters are prone, scattered around the graves, some unconscious, some groaning in pain. Voldemort is struggling onto his knees, breathing heavily. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Between Harry and Voldemort, a strange figure stands with his back to Harry. He is tall - taller than Voldemort, Harry sees - and is dressed oddly even amongst wizards. He wears black and green leathers and heavy leather boots. Decorated, gold vambraces cover his forearms and there is another armoured gold plate on one of his shoulders. His leather coat seems to move with the wind even though the night air is still. Harry thinks he is dressed for combat - is used to it even. His stance seems all at once both relaxed and alert, all of his senses almost disinterestedly honed on the environment around him. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Across the other side of the graveyard, Voldemort snarls and lifts his wand in a rage. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>Avada Kedavra!</em>” He snaps. The spell shoots from the tip of his gnarled wand in the direction of the man and Harry shouts a warning but the man simply lifts a pale hand and catches it. The spell coalesces as a ball of green light in his hand and for a moment the man appears to play with it. It disperses seconds later with a dismissive wave of his hand. A low chuckle fills the graveyard. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">“You truly think your spells will affect me? Hm,” the man sounds as though he’s smirking. “I suppose, however, that I should expect no better from a mortal wizard.”</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Voldemort looks affronted - although really, Harry thinks, affronted is a rather mild word to describe the expression on the other wizard’s face. Enraged, Voldemort lifts his wand again. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I am no mere mortal wizard, you insolent worm! I am the all-powerful Lord Voldemort and all shall bow before me! <em>Crucio!</em>” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Again, the man simply catches the spell and holds it in his hand. He looks at it, pauses, and then moments later it splits and shoots from his hand towards some of the more recovered, bolder Death Eaters who had been rather stupidly sneaking up from the side. The Death Eaters in question do not dodge in time, but fall to the ground shrieking in pain. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I rather doubt your assertion, Tom Riddle,” the man comments. “I know many wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, and others, all of whom have far greater power than you.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">“And who might these be? I would have their names so I can prove you wrong.”</p>
<p class="p2">The man sighs and appears to brush lint from his shoulder.</p>
<p class="p2">“Midgardians. Always so egotistical and over-reaching their own capabilities. Always so ignorant and lacking in true knowledge,” he muses.</p>
<p class="p2">Midgardians? Harry’s brow furrows in confusion over the strange term. He’s pretty sure now that this man is no wizard - he’s not even sure that he’s human.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You clearly know not with whom you speak! Such insolence will be punished!” Voldemort hisses. Having seen the man deflect two Unforgivables, Harry isn’t sure that Voldemort can make good on his threat. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You have not even asked with whom you speak, so such an assertion on your part is pointless and foolish,” the man says, clearly amused. Whoever he is, Harry hopes the reveal is going to cause Voldemort and his Death Eaters no small amount of embarrassment. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Reveal yourself then, if you think yourself above me,” Voldemort snaps, his tone mockingly benevolent. “Though I warn you now, I have no equal.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Are you sure you would not rather... pontificate a little longer? I was rather enjoying myself, I must say,” the man admits. Voldemort lifts his wand and looks ready to scream a rather nasty spell, so the man sighs and concedes. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">“Very well, if I must,” he says. There is a moment’s pause as the man is suddenly bathed in a greenish-gold glow and his outfit changes slightly. A rich green cape now falls from his shoulders to the ground, obscuring his full attire from Harry’s point of view, but it is the man’s helmet that catches Harry’s attention. It is gold, shining brightly, and reminds Harry of a Roman Centurion’s helmet, save for the top. Instead of the tall, red plumage typical of the Romans, two graceful horns sprout from the front of the helmet’s crown, curving back over the man’s head, each sharpening into a pointed tip. He looks regal and intimidating - and Harry can only see his back. The man adjusts his stance and Harry sees him plant the butt of a long, gold spear with a wicked looking point into the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I am Loki of Asgard,” he announces proudly and confidently. Harry hears a few of the Death Eaters inhale sharply at the words. One or two even take a few steps back. Voldemort looks a little nervous for a moment, but his rage is too powerful and instead he begins to shoot a myriad of spells at Loki, clearly sick of the diversion from his original plans for the evening. With little effort, Loki alternately catches the spells Voldemort throws at him or deflects them with his spear, not moving from the spot in which he first appeared. After a while he appears to have had enough and moves his right hand in a brief, sweeping motion towards Voldemort. A sudden flash of green light startles Harry and he initially thinks that Voldemort may have just been killed, but instead the other wizard appears to be bound and wandless. Loki approaches him slowly, spear now held in both hands. He carefully makes sure to step firmly on Voldemort’ s wand and there is a sharp cracking and splintering sound. Voldemort looks outraged and opens his mouth to speak but fails when Loki lifts his hand once more. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Do all Midgardians lack manners? You did not allow me to finish my introduction. I am Loki of Asgard and that boy you dared to touch and to harm is my son, Hávarðr,” he continues. “I have often been told that I must have infinite patience from putting up with Thor for centuries but now I find my patience worn thin, Riddle.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The boy cannot be your son. He is the spawn of James and Lily Potter and I will defeat him this night,” Voldemort spits. Loki moves so quickly Harry is uncertain that he moves at all, but the proof is the blood that drips slowly from the tip of his spear and the long, oozing cut down Voldemort’s right cheek. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His son? What is this Loki talking about? Harry’s parents are James and Lily Potter, as Voldemort said! Harry thinks about interrupting, but decides now is not the best time. He is reckless, yes, but not stupid. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You will not touch what is mine, mortal. You spoke of insolence, Riddle? I am a god and I will not tolerate insolence such as yours. You have dared to touch what is mine and now you will reap the consequences,” Loki murmurs. Harry can hear the tightly controlled fury in Loki’s tone and shifts where he is, wand in hand and ready to run should he need to. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You, Riddle, have been courting my attention for a long while now. Playing with magic in the way you have been, slaughtering other users of magic. Magic is a gift - one which you were given but have tainted. And then to touch my Hávarðr - my son - well... I see no choice but to remove that which you were given.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Voldemort screams. It is an agonising scream, one that has Harry flinching back against the gravestone he is standing next to. He is not sure what Loki is doing to Voldemort, but there is a green glow surrounding his right hand where it is touching Voldemort’s face and it looks as though something - something foul and dark with the consistency of slime - is oozing from Voldemort’s skin and dripping to the ground beneath. The oozing does not last long and as Voldemort’s scream dies away, Loki drops the wizard to the ground. Voldemort is on his knees before Loki, shivering and cowed. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It is said of me that I am the god of Chaos, Mischief and of Lies. What is not known nor said is that I am the greatest sorcerer in the Nine Realms. To challenge me and claim omnipotence was the act of a fool,” Loki says, moving backwards a little. He plants the butt of his spear in the ground once more. “For your crimes against magic, I have removed your gift for it. For your crimes against Hávarðr...” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The spear vanishes in a glimmer of green-gold and from where he is standing Harry cannot see what happens but he hears the ring of steel and the sickly, squelching sound of a wound. Voldemort slumps to the ground, motionless. Harry holds his breath for a moment, wondering if this is it, if Voldemort is truly dead and by the hands of someone who is claiming to be Harry’s father. It is a strange sense of breathless hope mingling with terror that fills him as Loki lifts his gaze to the Death Eaters around him. A few of them drop to their knees in fear and respect. Loki seems to survey them for a moment. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Get out of my sight,” Loki sneers and none of them linger long after that, apparating away almost instantly. Once the last crack has sounded, Harry realises he is now alone in the graveyard with Loki - with the man not only claiming to be a god, but Harry’s father also. Harry stays still, watching as Loki turns slowly and he finally gets to see the man’s face. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The likeness is uncanny. Black hair - check. High cheekbones - check. Ethereal green eyes - check. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Loki’s eyes are glowing initially, but as Harry watches they dim a little. A smile quirks thin lips and with a wave of his hand, Loki’s cape, helmet and spear vanish. Harry supposes he is trying to seem less intimidating, but after what he’s just seen the man do to Voldemort, he isn’t sure that vanishing a few accessories is really going to help all that much. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You have grown, Hávarðr. So much. The last time I saw you, you were but a babe in arms. I have missed you, my son.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry swallows. Loki speaks gently and with the warmth of love in his tone, but Harry is confused and nervous and not quite sure what is going on. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m sorry - really I am - but I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he replies nervously. Loki smiles sadly and moves closer. He stops only a little way from Harry. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course you don’t. You were not even an hour old when I was forced to give you up. And h</span>
  <span class="s1">ere you are, almost full grown and learning your craft.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“James and Lily Potter are my parents,” Harry points out, even as he looks over Loki’s features once more, recognising the similarities between them. “You can’t be my father.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Loki laughs and this time it is far more pleasant than the sinister chuckle Harry had heard earlier. This one is light and airy and carries warmth in its sound. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Take me to them and they will tell you of the night I came to them, pleading for them to take care of you in my place. I am not your father and although I carried you, I was not in a position then to truly be your mother.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry starts at Loki’s words. He does not know that James and Lily Potter are dead, murdered by the madman Loki himself just killed? And what was that about being Harry’s <em>mother</em>?! </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“My parents - James and Lily - they were murdered by Voldemort when I was a baby. My aunt and uncle raised me,” Harry says softly. Loki’s eyes widen in grief and horror and he moves closer, one hand reaching for Harry, but not quite making contact. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I am sorry, Hávarðr.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I… I’m used to it, I guess.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That doesn’t mean it hurts any less, Hávarðr. Even if you do not truly remember them, either.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry swallows against the tears gathering in his eyes as he hears the truth in that statement. His head hurts and his body aches and his thoughts and emotions are whirling and this whole evening has been even crazier than the usual end of year disaster he stumbles his way into.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Voldemort resurrected and now this - a strange, non-human magic user claiming to be his <em>mother</em>?! </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You can’t be my mother - that’s not biologically possible, is it? You’re a man! And if you’re my mother, who was my father? And I’m still not sure I believe you!” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Loki laughs again; it sounds sad and resigned. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You have many questions, Hávarðr, and I will answer them for you in time.” Loki looks quizzically at him for a moment. “Your command of the Elderspeak is commendable, given you have lived on Midgard your whole life.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">“Elderspeak? What’s that?”</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The Elderspeak is the native tongue of the Aesir and it is a gift, whispered into your ear as a babe, mere minutes after birth. My use of the Elderspeak triggered your own command of the language.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh. Can we speak English? I’m finding this all really weird right now,” Harry asks. He feels far too calm now. He thinks he should possibly be a little more than worked up given he's just seen a friend killed, Voldemort resurrected then killed again, and been told that his parents are not his parents - all that, and he's only worried about speaking in another language? What the hell? </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Loki gives him an indulgent smile. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course, Hávarðr.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Harry makes it back to Hogwarts, clutching Cedric’s dead body to him, he is too shellshocked from the evening’s events to offer much of an explanation for the professors and Tournament officials. Minister Fudge immediately takes a dislike to what little information he can glean from Harry’s few shellshocked words and as Professor Dumbledore is dragging him inside and away from the cacophony, Harry spots Fudge talking with several Aurors and glancing at Harry from time to time, a strange combination of suspicion and fear on his face. Even in his hazy, stunned state, Harry knows that whatever Fudge is saying to the Aurors, it’s not good. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Dumbledore drags Harry all the way to his office behind the griffin statue, Professors Snape and McGonagall following at a fast pace. Harry manages to stutter out an explanation which is truthful up until Loki revealing who he was and why he was there, but cannot bring himself to reveal the full truth - and perhaps that is his downfall. Instead, Harry just says that a wizard he did not recognise apparated in, duelled with Voldemort and killed the Dark Lord. Snape’s testimony about his Dark Mark coming to life once more, the pain of the summoning and then its fading confirms Harry’s half-truths enough for Dumbledore to be seemingly convinced. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Cornelius Fudge and the Ministry of Magic? Not so much. They arrest Harry two hours later for the murder of Cedric Diggory and as Harry is led from the castle, watched by what seems to be the whole school, he wonders where his <em>mother</em> vanished off to. The god had left the graveyard after ensuring Harry could return to school, saying that there was something he had to do, to prepare, before he would return for Harry properly. Harry hadn’t been sure then if he wanted to go with Loki, or even if he believed him yet, but now he was wishing Loki had taken him along. If he had, then Harry wouldn’t be in this position right now. Maybe he would be safe - or not; he didn’t really know enough about Loki to be sure of that.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry is taken to the Ministry holding cells where he is to await trial. Time passes, but he doesn’t really know how long he is in there for. He has no visitors whilst he is stuck there and is allowed no letters. Clearly they all think him guilty, even if Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall initially believed him. He curls up in the comer of his cell with the moth-eaten blanket they’ve provided for him and the events of that evening rush through his head. The adrenaline as he ran through the maze, grabbing the cup with Cedric, landing in the graveyard and then that flash of horrific green light, blasting Cedric off his feet and stealing the life from his body. Harry shudders with the force of that particular memory, tears burning in his eyes, before forcing himself to think onwards, past the rebirth ritual to the arrival of Loki. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Loki, who is either a madman or a god or both and who claims to be Harry’s mother - that James and Lily Potter are not his real parents, but merely adoptive ones. Harry has no idea what to think. He has no idea what to believe. Loki saved him from Voldemort - defeated Voldemort - and all because Voldemort had dared to attack Harry. But why hadn’t Loki appeared before now? Harry has faced Voldemort numerous times before now, and has been in a myriad of other dangerous situations and yet Loki has never shown up before. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry wishes Loki would arrive now and steal him away from this cell, from this fickle world who can’t decide whether Harry is to be admired or vilified. He feels so incredibly lost at sea and out of place. Not even Ron and Hermione have come to visit him and for so long they have made him feel at home and at ease at least a little within the Wizarding World. So long as it suits - suited - them, Harry supposes. He chastises himself for his bitter thoughts; they are his best friends, after all - perhaps they have not been allowed to visit, just as he has not been allowed letters. That must be it, he is sure of it. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He eats the meagre offering of food that is shoved through the flap in the bottom of the cell door and drinks all the water they allow him. The guards taunt him with the rumours from the Daily Prophet and suggestions for what his fate will be. Dementors, they say, that’s what’s fit for a murderer like him. Harry doesn’t waste his breath protesting for much longer than the first day. He learns quickly that protesting his innocence and trying to defend himself will only earn himself more mockery and serve to convince them of his guilt. So he stays quiet and calm, nothing like the brash Gryffindor everyone has always assumed is his natural state of mind. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Instead he thinks of Loki, apparently his mother, and tries to remember anything and everything he knows of Norse mythology beyond Thor being the god of thunder. All he can remember of Loki is a vague story he was told in primary school about a god’s lips being sewn together after a bet gone wrong, but he isn’t sure of the truth of that. The man - god - he saw seemed far too at ease and in control to ever allow something to go wrong - especially something that would lead to a consequence as awful as having his lips sewn shut. But then again, things happen and even for the most well laid plans, things can go wrong. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Loki had explained very briefly to Harry exactly how it was that a man was his mother. It is something Harry isn’t particularly keen on remembering, however, considering it the fact that it could very well happen to him one day, should he not be as careful as he needs to be. Apparently Loki is of a race where all of them are intersexed and some of them are shape-shifters. Loki had apparently seduced a man and ended up pregnant, even though he was male at the time. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And thus Loki carried and birthed Harry - Hávarðr is his birth name - in secret and passed him onto the Potters, unable to care for the infant himself. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry didn’t quite manage to get the why out of Loki, but he did understand that Loki was very much distraught at having to give his baby away. It warms Harry a little to know that. For once, it feels as though someone wants him and wants him simply because he is Harry, and not the Boy-Who-Lived. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Still, apparently not enough to rescue him from this cell and eventually the Dementors. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He curls up tighter in the corner and discreetly wipes the tears from his eyes. He focuses on his breathing as Remus had taught him once in response to a panic attack he’d caught Harry having. He slows his breathing down and it calms him, steering his thoughts away from Dementors and the soul-less state that awaited him. His eyes begin to droop and sleep beckons and he is nodding off when a noise startles him awake. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hávarðr!” A voice hisses. Harry glances up quickly. There is only one who would call him that, his apparent birth name. Sure enough, Loki stands in the centre of Harry’s cell, glowing greenish gold around the edges as he reaches out a pale, long-fingered hand. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Come, Hávarðr,” he whispers. “We must leave and get you to safety.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry eyes the hand suspiciously for a moment before remembering that going with Loki - who claims he is Harry’s real mother - is far preferable to having his soul sucked out by the Dementors. Tentatively, Harry places his hand in Loki’s and then the world blurs. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
