    <p align="justify">Scorpius has always been an early riser, even when he was little. This hasn’t changed since he’s gotten older. It was 6.30 a.m. and his dorm mates were all still asleep. He sat up and grabbed his potions book from his dresser. They had an essay due next week on the Effects of Euphoria, it was supposed to be two roles of parchment long and he wanted to get ahead. This was the kind of thing expected of them now that they were in Sixth Year.</p><p align="justify">As he opened his book, he did his usual glance over to his best friend’s bed. He and Albus were inseparable. It was a comfort knowing that he was always there next to him. Every morning Scorpius would wake and one of the first things he would do is glance over at Albus’s sleeping form and chuckle silently at his funny sleeping positions. This morning was no different. He laughed silently as he looked at him. He was lying on his side straddling his bunched-up blankets between his two legs. One hand holding a pillow to his chest and his other hand stretched out above his head. Almost like he was cuddling, in the back of Scorpius’s curious mind, he wondered if Albus was a cuddler.</p><p align="justify">I suppose all of the times they’ve hugged; a lot of them initiated by Albus have proven that he is. Scorpius smiled to himself at this concept. Albus was the most restless sleeper Scorpius had ever seen. Constantly tossing and turning during the night. It’s a wonder he ever gets a proper night's sleep. Scorpius eventually tore his eyes away from his sleeping best friend and got to work reading his copy of Advanced Potion Making. Once Albus woke the two friends got dressed and made their way down to breakfast.</p><p align="justify">As they were descending the stairs to the Great Hall, Scorpius pondered the nature of their relationship. They’ve both changed a lot in the last two years, especially since that incident with the time turner, and in turn their relationship hasn’t been the same since. They’ve become a lot closer physically. They’ve always been emotionally close, always knowing what the other’s thinking just by a look or guessing what they’re about to say before they even utter a word. But in the last two years and especially in the last couple of months there’s been a lot more physical contact.</p><p align="justify">Albus would touch his arm lightly if he laughed at something Scorpius had said. Or rub his back soothingly if Scorpius was having a bad day. Or maybe it was the fact that Scorpius was more aware of their touching. It made Scorpius feel good. Any physical contact was comforting to Scorpius. As it was something he wasn’t used to, especially since his mother died.</p><p align="justify">Not that his dad didn’t try and Scorpius loved his dad more than anything. But it wasn’t the same, and not as natural as Scorpius and Albus’s relationship. Albus was the most comforting thing in Scorpius’s life. Every time something happens; Albus is always the first person Scorpius wants to tell. Just to hear his opinion or see his facial expressions.</p><p align="justify">‘What are you thinking about so hard?’ Albus asked looking curiously at Scorpius and breaking Scorpius out of his reverie. ‘Oh nothing, just this potions essay that’s due next week.’ Scorpius lied. He didn’t want to admit he was deeply thinking of the nature of their relationship this early in the morning.</p><p align="justify">‘You’re such a geek, you know that’ Albus laughed. ‘That’s not due till next week. You must be the only person to think about homework before they've even had their pumpkin juice.’ Scorpius laughed along with Albus, he had such an infectious laugh; Scorpius couldn’t help but join in. Even if Albus was laughing at his expense.</p><p align="justify">They entered the Great Hall and took their usual seats at the far corner of the Slytherin table. ‘Yeah maybe... but I like potions, and after this essay is handed in, we get to brew Euphoria potion. Do you reckon old Professor Slughorn will allow us to taste it?’ Scorpius exclaimed excitedly. ‘I don’t know’ Albus replied thoughtfully, ‘That would be fun though, do you think it’ll make us super happy and giggly? like we’ve drank too much Firewhiskey or something?’ Albus laughed.</p><p align="justify">‘My dad and uncle Ron drank too much Firewhiskey last Christmas, they were so funny; dancing and singing around the Burrow. Then they went to each member of the family, and I mean <em>every member,</em> of my <em>HUGE</em> family to tell them how much they loved them and to never change.’ Albus broke into hysterical laughter and Scorpius couldn’t help but laugh along with him. ‘Dad was so embarrassed the next day, not to mention the headache he had’ Albus chuckled again.</p><p align="justify">Scorpius smiled at this story; he couldn’t picture Harry Potter like this. All carefree and unanxious. Ron on the other hand, Scorpius can only picture like this, fun and carefree.</p><p align="justify">‘Advanced Potion Making doesn’t describe the effects of Euphoria as being drunk, but maybe it is a little bit like that. I’ve never been drunk myself so I wouldn’t know. Let me find it, one sec...’ Scorpius rummaged in his book bag and took out his copy of Advanced Potion Making, skipped through to find the paragraph he was looking for.</p><p align="justify">‘Ah here it is... "Once Euphoria has been ingested, the drinker will experience an extreme high as if all their endeavours will succeed. This however, is just a feeling that the potion produces, as it does not effect the outcomes of their actions and decisions like Felix Felicis. Which makes the drinker extremely lucky (see page 224 on the effects of Felix Felicis)".... And then it goes on to tell a story about a wizard who confessed his love to a witch he was infatuated with for many years, after drinking Euphoria. She rejected him in a very embarrassing way and he then became a hermit for the rest of his life.’ Scorpius finished and took a sip of pumpkin juice, slipping his book back into his bag.</p><p align="justify">‘Oh, too bad for that Wizard, that’s embarrassing. But still … I think it’ll be fun’ Albus said. Then suddenly, Scorpius felt Albus’s hand on his shoulder. He stood up to lean over him and grab a slice of toast. Scorpius’s heart jumped at the contact and his stomach flipped. Scorpius involuntarily gasped and jumped as if he had been shocked.</p><p align="justify">Albus looked down curiously at Scorpius ‘is everything okay Scorp?’ Albus asked worried. He grabbed a slice of toast and sat back beside Scorpius. ‘Yeah... yeah’ Scorpius said breathlessly looking down at his porridge. ‘Just a bit of a headache I think.’ Scorpius lied. ‘Oh.’ Albus answered pensively. ‘Do you want to go to the hospital wing?’ He continued. ‘Madam Pomfrey could give you a potion for that... I’ll walk with you if you like.’</p><p align="justify">Lovely Albus, thought Scorpius. Always looking out for me. ‘No I’ll be fine! Thanks Albus. I need to head to Ancient Runes anyway. I’ll see you at Charms.’ Scorpius grabbed his things and quickly walked out of the Great Hall towards his Ancient Runes classroom.</p><p align="justify">What was that about? thought Scorpius. Maybe he is coming down with something. Something that’s making him think about his best friend non-stop. And jump when he touches him.</p><p align="justify">Scorpius pushed that thought to the back of his mind and made his way up the stairs to Ancient Runes, this class will surely take his mind off it.</p><p align="justify">***************************************</p><p align="justify">Scorpius was having a strange week. Ever since he reacted strangely when Al touched him at breakfast last Monday. It’s all he’s been thinking about. He would be concentrating on his homework as usual and somehow, his thoughts would drift to Albus.</p><p align="justify">Thinking about his messy unkempt black hair; his deep green eyes, a colour Scorpius could never describe; the light dust of freckles over his nose; his smile; that one dimple he has on his right cheek and his laugh.</p><p align="justify">I mean Albus was never far from his thoughts. But lately it was all he seemed to think about. Scorpius realised, I mean maybe he never really acknowledged it before… but his best friend was quite handsome!</p><p align="justify">Is that something that’s okay for Scorpius to think? Is this what friends thought about?</p><p align="justify">Was Al touching him more lately? Or was Scorpius just hyper aware of his presence?</p><p align="justify">****************************************</p><p align="justify">It’s been a month since these reactions to Albus touching him started and Scorpius was starting to figure out why. ‘Hey Scorp’ Al smiled falling down beside him on the couch making Scorpius jump.</p><p align="justify">He was sitting on the couch, nestled at the back corner of the common room; their usual spot. ‘Feeling better?’ Al asked. Scorpius had jumped again today during Transfiguration when Albus’s hand brushed lightly against his, whilst writing out instructions for Professor Bones on transfiguring food.</p><p align="justify">Scorpius claimed he had a headache again and Albus was inclined to believe him. ‘You’ve been having a lot of headaches lately Scorp, maybe you should talk to Madam Pomfrey?’ Albus asked, concern in his voice.</p><p align="justify">‘No Al. I just haven’t been sleeping well. That’s all… Been having nightmares.’ Scorpius finished quietly. It was true that Scorpius wasn’t sleeping well. But they weren’t nightmares he was having. They were actually quite pleasant dreams. But dreams that kept him up at night after he woke thinking deeply of their meaning.</p><p align="justify">The kind of dreams that if he shared a room with a legilimens he would be so embarrassed that he would have to leave the country. This wasn’t the first time he’d dreamt of kissing his best friend but it was the first time that the dreams had gone further than kissing. It was an extremely hot and passionate dream and when Scorpius woke he was extremely sticky in his private area. Scorpius blushed at the memory.</p><p align="justify">‘Okay, if you say so’ Albus replied still not looking convinced. ‘But I worry about you Scorp…. I worry you’re not looking after yourself properly’ Albus stated. Scorpius’s heart and stomach did that thing again. Albus was concerned about him, Scorpius thought. Was this concern because Albus felt the same way Scorpius did about him? Or was it completely platonic?</p><p align="justify">As Scorpius realised late last night with a sudden mind altering epiphany. That yes; these dreams did mean something; and no they weren’t just his teenage hormones projecting his best friend where someone else surely should be. But actually... Scorpius was attracted to his best friend! Or perhaps he was infatuated. Infatuation would surely fade wouldn’t it? Scorpius wondered. He couldn’t be in love with Albus because he’s quite positive that he wouldn’t return Scorpius’s feelings. He was fairly certain of this.</p><p align="justify">‘Thanks Al, that’s so sweet of you to worry about me, but I swear I would go to Madam Pomfrey if I truly thought something was wrong. But these are just stupid nonsense dreams that are keeping me awake.’ Scorpius replied after a moment.</p><p align="justify">‘Really? What are the dreams about?’ Albus asked curiously as he leant back against the couch and stretching his legs out in front of him; looking at Scorpius expectantly. Scorpius wasn’t expecting this question, they normally didn’t discuss their dreams with each other.</p><p align="justify">Also Scorpius was a terrible liar, and Albus would see through it immediately. Scorpius decided to tell him a half-truth. Eenough for Al to know that he wasn’t lying but not enough to confess his feelings to his best friend.</p><p align="justify">Scorpius blushed slightly. ‘Scorp you’re blushing…’ Albus giggled. ‘…That’s because I lied.’ Scorpius interrupted quickly, hoping to get this over very fast. ‘They aren’t nightmares’ Scorpius replied. ‘They’re kind of.... sort of … dirty dreams … I guess.' Scorpius said stuttering 'my teenage hormones have started taking over my subconscious. I suppose they had to kick in at some stage haha.’ Scorpius finished with a humourless giggle.</p><p align="justify">His ears burning red with embarrassment. He chanced a glance at Albus. Was he blushing too? Albus's mouth hung open slightly; his pupils were dilated. Then he shook his head like a dog trying to dry himself; like he was trying to get his brain to start working again.</p><p align="justify">‘Oh’ Albus replied croakily. ‘I wasn’t expecting that’ and he gave a deep chuckle. ‘Um…. who are these dreams about? .... If you don’t mind me asking. I’m just curious?... I wasn’t aware you fancied anyone after your crush on Rose eventually fizzled out.’ Albus asked.</p><p align="justify">‘Oh it’s about no one in particular’ Scorpius replied quickly avoiding Albus’s gaze. ‘Just a faceless stranger, but you know what teenagers are like….’ Scorpius trailed off.</p><p align="justify">‘Yeah’ Albus answered, ‘I do know Scorp, I am one, haha’ Albus replied jokingly and chuckled. ‘And just so you don’t feel too embarrassed, I’ve had those dreams too.' Albus said blushing furiously now. 'It’s normal… But I don’t understand why they’re keeping you awake. You can just do a quick scourgify and go straight back to sleep.’ Albus stated.</p><p align="justify">Scorpius took a moment too long to recover, he found the fact that Albus was also having dirty dreams extremely hot. Maybe he was having these dreams about Scorpius, but that was wishful thinking and he knew it.</p><p align="justify">‘Yeah I know but I’m Scorpius the over thinker aren’t I?’ Scorpius laughed. ‘Yeah you are’ Albus laughed along with him and soon the two of them were uncontrollably laughing, holding their stomachs with tears of laughter in their eyes. The fact that such a personal conversation came out of Scorpius having a headache made them both hysterical.</p><p align="justify">‘Anyway, I better go to bed, or else I’ll never get rid of these damn headaches.’ Scorpius said after they both recovered, wiping his eyes. ‘Okay.’ Albus answered trying to recover himself and catching his breath.</p><p align="justify">‘But remember, quick scourgify and then back to sleep.’ Then Albus laughed and then winked. Scorpius was momentarily stunned.</p><p align="justify">He winked at Scorpius. Was he being flirty? Scorpius stared for a second too long, his mouth dropped open in surprise. Then his brain started working again. He chuckled and said ‘yeah, I’ll remember that thanks Al' and made his way to the dormitory.</p><p align="justify">Scorpius quickly made his way up to bed. That wink gave him a glimmer of hope. Was Albus flirting? …. Probably not. Scorpius scolded himself for even hoping.</p><p align="justify">He quickly pulled on his pyjamas and jumped into bed, secretly hoping that this was just a phase, and pleading with himself not to have another embarrassing dream about his best friend tonight.</p>
