    <p>At the mere age of 7 Harry had quickly learned the harsh rules and truths of his existence. He understood that he had to remain unseen to survive his life. That he had to be in his cousin's shadow, or pay the price. To call as little attention to himself as possible, because if he is not seen they won't think to find him to punish him. He knew he would obey at any cost; he didn't want to think of what would happen otherwise. It's worse every time.</p>
<p>Harry was no fool. He knew what was done to him was so very, very wrong. At one time, when he was younger and still believed in them, he thought he deserved it, that it was his fault for being different and that what they did was justifiable. Normal even. He met the harsh reality shortly after he started school. To bad the little faith he had left died when he tried to speak out. He wasn't able to go to school for the rest of that week.</p>
<p>He regularly fixed his face to be indifferent, and non-responsive towards everyone. He learned and studied what he could without being noticed, but he never dared show what he had learned because he would undoubtedly be punished.</p>
<p>It was just a week after his cousin's ninth birthday bonanza. He was still recovering from the punishments he received during and after the party. He was punished for small things like the food not being perfect, a weed was found in the backyard, Harry didn't clean up fast enough after the guests, and even the birthday boy and his cronies participated in a few rounds of the well known and loved game of 'beat up the freak'.</p>
<p>Harry was cautiously leaving his cupboard to get started with his mile long list of chores he undoubtedly had. They wouldn't have unlocked his cupboard if they didn't have things for him to do. He hadn't been let out since the party other than to clean up the subsequent mess, then it was right back in because he got blood on something.</p>
<p>Harry found his list tacked to his door. He quickly began by cleaned all the dishes that had piled up since the party and took care of the garbage that had also piled up. He wasn't too surprised to see that were only a few spoons left clean before he added the recently washed dishes to the cupboards. He had to make four trips to the trashcans to get all the garbage out.</p>
<p>He then set about making a fine breakfast of eggs, two scrambled, and two sunny side up, a small mountain of toast, a small roasted ham, a batch of chocolate and zucchini muffins, bacon just barley not burned, a strong green tea, and black coffee, all of which he would not be allowed to enjoy even the smallest of morsels of. Unless he burnt some of it, but then he would be beat soundly first.</p>
<p>They practically ignored him as they ate their food other than the usual snide remarks of 'Freak', and rough treatment. Harry was thanking his lucky stars for small mercies.</p>
<p>After he finished cleaning up from the breakfast fit for kings, he set about cleaning the entrance hall, kitchen, and living room in great detail, he would do those first because they were visible from the front door and the windows. Once he was done he would begin the front yard before the heat of the day set in.</p>
<p>After a lunch around 2 pm that consisted of the burnt bread crust from 1 and a half pieces of toast that his cousin had tried to make, Harry moved on to the back yard and the long list of jobs to be completed. As Harry made his way out back his aunt openly glared at him and watched his every move as if she expected him to try and set the house on fire or something.</p>
<p>He cleared out any remaining garbage, weeded the whole yard with extra care and attentiveness. He then cleaned and stored all the lawn tools, toys, and other outdoors items that he found just laying around. He then moved on to repainting and mending the fence that encompassed the yard and went through many painful bushes that he would have to prune as well.</p>
<p>He left the portion with the bushes for last and moved quickly to the other end of the fence. The heat of the summer day was really beginning to settle in and become uncomfortable by the time he had finished the all of the fence but the part with the bushes. He was well aware of his aunt glaring at him through the window as he worked.</p>
<p>When he was finishing up with the bushes, something shiny and hidden under the bush caught his eye. He began to worry if he had missed any other garbage as he knew he would have to check the whole yard again or risk excessive punishment.</p>
<p>He carefully pulled out the shiny offending item. He quickly realized with wonder and growing horror, that is was a missed present from the party.</p>
<p>It was a small book shaped parcel and light weight. It had no label about who it was from. The wrapping was a regal gold, and deep green with spirals in red and silver that all seemed to blend together and glow. It had no bow or string, and was wrapped perfectly with no visible tape holding it together.</p>
<p>Harry only thought about giving it to his family for but a fleeting moment before he hid it in his loose hand-me downs and prayed to anyone who cared that his mystery wouldn't be noticed.</p>
<p>He completed the rest of his day without to much incident and had made it back to his cupboard under the stairs in one piece. When he was finally sure that the other three in the house were sound asleep he cautiously pulled the present out of his clothes, and then found his mini flashlight he had stashed away a few months ago. His cousin had thrown it out because the batteries were dying and he couldn't be bothered to change the batteries out. He then hid under his covers and cautiously turned on his little dying light. He carefully unwrapped the mystery.</p>
<p>He held his breath as he carefully uncovered the treasure and found the book underneath the mystical wrapping.</p>
<p>Fairy Tail.</p>
<p>Harry opened the book up to see just what this book was about when said book told him he was going the wrong way.</p>
<p>He quickly figured out how to properly read the book and began.</p>
