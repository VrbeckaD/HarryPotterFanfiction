    <p>It was the evening of young Draco Malfoy’s eleventh birthday and come the end of summer he would receive his letter and begin to ready himself for the start of school. As it was dusk at Malfoy manor, everyone inside was getting ready for bed. Aside from the house elf, Dobby who was up and about cleaning up from the celebration of Draco’s birthday.</p><p> Narcissa Malfoy nee Black had retired to her personal bedroom not to long after the last guest had left. Lucius Malfoy was in his own room, counting down in his head and awaiting the usual time in which he would sneak away to his son’s room. There were many secrets of the Malfoy family that they dealt with. And some were heartbreaking to the ones involved.</p><p> Finally feeling the time was right, Lucius hurried from his room and towards his child’s. Draco’s room wasn’t far from his. Just down the hall. Narcissa’s wasn’t even in that hall. Still, the Malfoy head always felt he needed to sneak with these private visits to his son. Visits where they could be truly happy.</p><p> Lucius and Narcissa had been arranged to wed after Abraxas Malfoy had found a startling involvement in his son’s life. Draco had been born not long after. When baby Draco had come, others had pieced this to the reason of the practically instantaneous wedding. No one besides the Malfoys knew the deeper reasons.</p><p> Narcissa was far from a good wife. Not that Lucius had ever assumed her to be much of one. Between her sour moods in which no one was safe from her insulting tongue, and the Malfoy money being practically used to keep her appeased. Their marriage was simply a public appearance. Heaven knows she’s made constant reminders of this through nightly lovers and keeping herself physically and emotionally apart from bother Lucius and Draco. Not that Lucius needed reminders. He had enough with the fact he held silent disdain for the woman, and a longing for someone kept far away from him, and the public detachment he had to do not only in public but even just in Narcissa’s presence. Lucius was stuck in this marriage even after his father’s death, lest it be annulled by the minister or Merlin himself –as had been his father’s words.</p><p> As he silently hurried to Draco’s room, Lucius felt his throat dry at the thought that at the end of the summer, he’d see less of his son then before. These night visits he tried to make as frequent as possible, but even with them he felt he hadn’t had enough time with Draco. Between his work and Narcissa enforcing no familial contacting in the hours in which she could see it.</p><p> Pushing the door in quietly, Lucius’ white-blond haired head poked into the darkness of Draco’s bedroom. He saw his son’s in bed, covered from view in the blanket. He had obviously been exhausted during the party, so Lucius couldn’t feel to surprised. He had been surprised though when Draco had left the party for bed just before it ended.</p><p> He crept into the room and gently closed the door back. Lucius then crept over to Draco’s bed, pulling his wand and whispering Lumos. Holding the light just away from the boy, Lucius could see his son in the glow of the light. His absolutely perfect son. Draco had always resembled him, with the same hair and eyes and even in his pointed features. </p><p> Sitting on the bed’s edge, Lucius still held his wand away to keep the light dim from waking the boy. With his other hand he proceeded to gently caress the matching white-blond locks of his son. They were free of their usual slicked back style, the only thing of Draco’s style Narcissa insisted upon, and were their usual softness and wild appearance.</p><p> When Draco suddenly roused from his sleep, making a whimpering noise, Lucius hushed him.</p><p> “It’s alright, Dragon. It’s me, just go back to sleep.”</p><p> “M’sory, mu.” Draco’s words were muffled horribly by him rubbing his face into his pillow though Lucius could make it out just barely.</p><p> He chuckled and kept up with caressing Draco’s hair, now also rubbing his head with his fingers, lulling Draco back to sleep.</p><p> “Sissa told me to go to bed,” Draco muttered before drifting back off, “said I shouldn’t disturb you tonight.”</p><p> Lucius felt sudden ire towards Narcissa. Why shouldn’t his baby be able to see him before bed? Especially with two months before Draco had to leave for school and be alone? Severus would be watching him, the potion master had promised such, but Lucius still felt it hard to think of his Draco being alone.</p><p> Lucius felt his disdain for Narcissa grow into hate as every instance in which she showed loathing to Draco flashed in his head. How dare that woman be the one his son must call mother when around others. How dare she feel entitled enough to boss them around for her own gain when she was a faux in their lives. And how dare his father to make him wed this horrendous woman and keep apart him from the one whom he SHOULD have married. Not Narcissa. Never Narcissa. Past the marriage Narcissa didn’t have a single say in Draco’s life though they must allow it. It should have been the one Lucius had promised his heart to.</p><p> Narcissa hadn’t been the one who had carried the babe to term. Narcissa hadn’t been the one who birthed Draco on June 5th, 1980. Narcissa hadn’t been the one who spent sleepless nights to watch the baby, not even because he was crying but only to see him. Narcissa hadn’t been the one who wiped Draco’s tears, or coddled him, or shushed him, or comforted him with the words “Mummy’s here”. Narcissa hadn’t been the one Draco had addressed when he said his first word “Mama”. Narcissa hadn’t been the one who Draco ran to or called for when he had nightmares. Narcissa wasn’t the one who Draco looked to for comfort or reassurance even in the public eye. Narcissa hadn’t been the one in any of that. </p><p> It had all been Lucius.</p>
