    <p>Remus Lupin - Moony to his friend - was having none of it. He had just walked into room E14 to witness something he would rather not.</p>
<p>In a normal classroom Remus imagined students would have books out, pens scribbling away with notes and focus solely on their studies. E14 was completely different. In the place of textbooks and other learning equipment where mud clad shoes and card games. Some students were even asleep on the desks.</p>
<p>It repulsed Remus to see this kind of behaviour from his own peer group.</p>
<p>Inwardly sighing, Remus perched himself on the nearest chair to him, at least here he had full view of the classroom and the clock. Sat where he was meant the 16 year old could dodge any attempts on his freedom too. He could see a row in front of him two boys playing blackjack with stoic faces. Remus had never played blackjack before but he easily recognised the game from the amount of times Peter had brought up the game.</p>
<p>Peter Pettigrew was Remus' only friend really and he wasn't exactly the best person to hang out with but he didn't get on Remus' nerves all the time like most people. Peter was a rat like boy with pointed features, a round figure and a short posture, slightly stooped. The only reason Peter ever talked to Remus about blackjack half the time was because he was a 'popular kid wannabe'. Most people made fun of Peter for his ways but Remus accepted them with a smile and never shot him down about anything. A frown on the younger boy's face would easily leave Remus feeling guilty for what seemed like forever unless he found some way to make up for it.</p>
<p>From what Remus was observing from his seat two rows behind the male on the left, wearing a leather jacket with wilding black hair he had failed to tame was losing and according to the curl of his lips Remus caught a glimpse at: he was a sour loser. Before Remus had to register what had happened there there cards flying up in the air and a sour teenage boy was slumping over to a another male in the class wearing an identical leather jack only in dirt kind of grey colour rather than midnight black but he shared a similar problem with his own untidy black hair - it was untameable.</p>
<p>Maybe it took Remus 10 minutes, maybe it took Remus 30, he had just registered the clock in the classroom was broken and still no teacher had arrived. It was safe to say Remus honestly feared the students in the classroom with him. The scrawny boy had started his third maths equation now. An unfamiliar figure had slumped into the chair next to Remus who wasn't aware and unsuspecting.</p>
<p>"What you doing there, Pretty Boy?" Remus froze mid equation. He was being spoken to.</p>
<p>Slowly, Remus turned his head, his acid green eyes meeting stormy grey eyes that both intrigued and terrified him. "I-I'm sorry, are you talking to me?" He stuttered shrinking back slightly in fear he may be attacked - or worse criticized for actually doing assigned work. The older boy gave Remus a look that sent another nasty shiver down his spine, it felt like his eyes might be x-raying him.</p>
<p>A bark of a laugh issued from the mouth of the stranger to Remus. He continued to bark with laughter, turning in his plastic chair to face another student - the student with the dirty coloured leather jacket. "Prongs! You have to hear this!" He laughed until tears were forming in the corner of his eyes. He was beginning to make Remus feel uneasy as he recoiled, trying to put as much distance between himself and the teen in the leather jacket.</p>
<p>Sirius Black had finally stopped his barking and was now eyeing Remus with a look that made the younger boy's heart stop beating for a second in fear. His eyes were cold and authoritative. He was telling him who was in charge here. "You wanna watch yourself here Pretty Boy. You're new, so you don't know who's in charge here. I'm Sirius and you listen to what I say when you're in this room."</p>
