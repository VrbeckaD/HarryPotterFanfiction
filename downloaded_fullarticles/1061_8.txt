    <p>Ayden gazed at the display of valerian, dragon’s claws, and phoenix feathers through the window of Mr. Mulpepper’s Apothecary. She lost herself in dreaming of her very own potion’s lab. </p>
<p>Cauldrons of every shape and material, ingredients filled the shelves on the walls, and people lined up at her door to purchase her potions. </p>
<p>“AYDEN? AYDEN WHERE ARE YOU?” her mother’s voice shattered the illusion.</p>
<p>She quickly looked around for her mother and brother. They weren’t there.</p>
<p>"AYDEEEE! AYDEEE, MOM'S LOOKIN' FOR YOU!" her brother, Peder's, childish voice called out.</p>
<p> Standing on tiptoe, she leaned to both sides. Her eyes widened and her head turned wildly.</p>
<p>“Mom? Where are you?” she hollered back as she pushed her way into the crowd.</p>
<p>Her mother's deep voice rang through the noise and chatter of the crowd, like a big bell, "Ayden? Ayden, we’re over here!”</p>
<p>"Mom!" Ayden lunged forward to hug her mom round the ribs.</p>
<p>Her mother’s face collapsed in relief and she tightened her arms around her daughter, clutching her to herself.  "Where were you, Ayden? I was so worried when I turned around and you weren’t there."</p>
<p>“I wanted to look in the window.” Ayden mumbled into her mother’s stomach.</p>
<p>Her mom released her and crouched down to face her. She held her shoulders tightly and said, “You have to stay near me, Ayden, or tell me when you want to stop. A stranger could have taken you away from me and we never would have seen you again.” Peder hovered by her shoulder, his dark eyes filled with both worry and relief.</p>
<p>"Okay, Mom." Ayden said softly, "...Mom? Where are we going next?" </p>
<p>Her mother rose and held out her hands. Peder quickly grabbed the right and Ayden the left.</p>
<p>"To Ollivander's to get your wand." She said as she moved steadily through the crowd. </p>
<p>Upon the steps of Ollivander's, as they prepared to pull open the door, a smooth voice drawled, “Hi. Are you going to Hogwarts too?"</p>
