    <p>It was just an ordinary day for the young girl named Eve, not too hot, not too cold. She expected it to be like every other day she'd spent walking through downtown, not realizing that in this instant, the string of her original fate was cut in order to weave her into the chaotic tapestry that was slowly coming together on Fate's loom, foretelling of massive battles, danger, love, loss, and many challenges. No, she just thought it was just any other Thursday. There was no need to worry, everything would be fine.</p><p>A loud cry of "oops!" caught her attention as she was walking down the sidewalk, and she saw a red ball land in the road, and roll to about halfway between the center of the road and where she herself was standing. On the other side of the street was a young boy, no older than six, who immediately ran after his ball that he had lost his grip on. Eve also noticed that there didn't seem to be anyone out here watching him, aside from an old, tired dog. She was concerned, especially since she realized she must have zoned out during her walk, due to her not recognizing the part of town she was in. The child was just about to reach the middle of road when she heard it, a loud rumbling noise. Accompanying this noise she saw a truck out of the corner of her eye, speeding down the road. Faster than she had ever moved before, she rushed out into the street and pushed the child out of the way of the oncoming truck. But she realized in that split second that while she may have saved the child, it put her in danger, and soon she was the one hit by the car, her losing consciousness before being able to register the pain caused by the car. In the road laid her broken body, and she died a hero in the child's eyes, since he realized he could have been the one hit by the car.</p><p>*****************************************************</p><p>Fate moaned to herself as she felt another headache coming on. Meddling directly like this was always a pain, but it was all she could do since she had to stay and weave out the fate of the multiverse on her looms. She could only ever leave for short periods of time, usually to appoint a new favored warrior, but that only happened rarely. It had been countless millennia since the great Axolotl formed the first universes of the multiverse and she had chosen four individuals to be her favored. She took these warriors and set them into an almost endless cycle of death and rebirth to help set up new clusters of universes and fight off the evils that were destined to arise as the multiverse spiraled up and down, outwards and inwards and in every direction. But eventually they begged to be freed. They were saddled with the memories and skills picked up from every single life they had lived, and they were tired. The hearts, souls, and minds of mortals were not meant to carry this strong of a burden, for they didn't have the resilience of an immortal deity like Fate or her brother Truth. That had happened so long ago that she had almost forgotten, but her four would always be remembered across the multiverse, both as historical figures and fictional characters, for countless deeds, the most well-known of these being the founding of this little school known as Hogwarts.</p><p>That is not to say they didn't have other accomplishments, but that is what they were best known for, and had the largest new sector of the magic quadrant of the multiverse was born from their actions. But she had let each of them go almost one hundred thousand years ago now, so she was in need of a new warrior. One who was easy to mold, whom had enough basic knowledge to be able to learn skills quickly as they were catapulted from one life to next, gathering skills to face off against the horror that was this iteration of Bill Cipher.</p><p>All versions of Bill that have been antagonistic towards Fate had committed horrors large and small across the multiverse, but this one had done something none of the others had done before. Something that disturbed Fate to her core. He had sought out other versions of himself and absorbed them into his being to gain power, to grow stronger... and the absorption occurred through him devouring his other selves. Fate had never been as repulsed as she had been when she learned of the actions of this iteration of Bill.</p><p>Fate and Bill had been pitted against each other for so long that neither of them really remembered the short few hours after the Axolotl created them in which they got along. Fate may have been a weaver of destiny, but Bill was a pair of scissors ready to cut her work to ribbons before tossing it all in the fire. Fate had her warriors, and Bill had his "manths" (pronounced months), seven dark, chaotic magic users that he used to create the evils that Fate sent her warriors to face, or to cause problems that Fate still hasn't yet finished fixing.  One of them placed a curse over a valley of cold-water springs found in China, another took the form of the dwarf-in-the-flask, two of them possessed dark lords and made them more evil and more powerful than they were originally meant to be. Two messed with the time-stream, one to the past, and the other to the future in universes barely connected. One took possession of a young child, but that wasn't until after the seven teamed up and turned two friendly races against one another in war, and used their powers to seal one of the races deep underneath a mountain and behind a barrier only a human soul could pass. Six of the "manths" dissipated right there, with their effects lingering on the places their darkness touched, while the seventh went and possessed a yet to be born human child whose family lived in the shadow of the mountain.</p><p>The actions of the seven slowly siphoned power away from the dimensions they terrorized straight back to Bill, in order to continue adding to his strength. Fate could not let this stand.</p><p>Any easily molded mind was what she needed for this new hero, she would make sure they were determined enough to take down Bill once and for all, with enhanced strength and magic in the final battle. But they couldn't be determined or bull-headed enough to turn against her when they realized there was manipulation being used against them, was something Fate realized as well. She planned to give them honeyed words and make them think being a hero was their true destiny, instead of her trying to forcefully weave string into a tapestry that it doesn't belong in. While determined, the must also hold integrity and want to stand up for what's right. But most importantly, they must be kind... since those who are kind are meek enough to not turn against her, right?</p><p>It was for that reason she chose Eve. Well, "chose" isn't necessarily the right word. She just found the first string that matched what qualifications she placed for the position, and gave it a tug, quickly snipped it, and began weaving it into the tapestry depicting the fate of this iteration of Bill. She felt the moment that the soul left it's original tapestry, and landed in the space in-between tapestries, where Fate herself lived. So Fate allowed herself to leave to greet the newly arrived soul, and hoped the headache would go away soon.</p><p>******************</p><p>In a mound of ashes was a little bird. Well, that wasn't quite right. The small being was actually humanoid in shape, despite the downy fluff that grew out of their torso and arms and upper half of their legs. There was even fluff mixed in with the small poof of hair on top of their head. They had human hands, and feet like a chicken. Humanoid eyes, and even a beak, but they didn't have wings, and felt as though something else was missing, too. They felt bare, like it was wrong for them to be here like this, but they didn't know why it would be wrong. Their mound, or rather, nest, as their mind corrected, was located on a mountain next to an intricately carved door set directly in the stone, overlooking a valley full of pools of water. The place felt familiar, but they didn't think they'd ever been here before. They were suddenly startled when they heard footsteps from behind them. </p><p>What are footsteps, they wondered, as they identified the sound, both knowing and not knowing the sound all at once. The shook some stray ashes out of their yellow fluff and out of their shock of orangey-red hair.  Their green eyes looked up at the figure whom had walked up behind them.</p><p>"Are you my mother?" they suddenly asked, not understanding what possessed them to ask that of the tall, picturesque being with flowing hair in front of them. It felt right to ask, though, as though a small bird like they were should ask that of whatever creature they met.</p><p>"No, little bird, I am not your mother," the being said to the little bird, "I am no ones mother. I am Madame Fate, and I weave destiny into beautiful tapestries. I weave all destinies, including yours, and you are meant to be a hero."</p><p>"Oh, you're not my mother... that makes me feel sad." they said, overcome with emotion, not understanding why they felt this way, "But you say you're noone's mother? Could I meet this noone? I bet we could be friends! Oh, is little bird my name? What's a destiny? Or a hero?" The little bird started to perk up at the idea of making a friend.</p><p>"No, little bird is not your name. I do not have a child, that's what it means to be no ones mother. There isn't a child named no one that you can be friends with. Destiny is what you are meant to do with your life. A hero saves people from evil and protects those whom can't protect themselves." Madame Fate said to the little bird.</p><p>"Then what's my name? If I'm meant to be a hero, does that mean my name is hero?" the little bird asked.</p><p>"No, your name is not hero! And your name is not for me to decide, little one, it's up to your mother to name you." Madame Fate said with a sigh, "Now, I need you to understand, there is a bad man who wants to spread evil and chaos across the multiverse, and most of the multiverse can't protect themselves against him. You're meant to be a hero because you are destined to become strong enough to save the citizens of the multiverse from his schemes and to protect the multiverse by whatever means necessary. As long as you agree to save these people and to protect them as well, little bird."</p><p>"Of course Madame Fate! You said I can do it, so I can do it!" the little bird chirped excitedly. Madame Fate smirked to herself, and raised her hand.</p><p>"I will use my magic to send you to your mother so you can get your name and begin training to fight the bad man, alright little bird?" Madame Fate asked, lowering her hand slightly. The little bird nodded in agreement, and Madam Fate's magic swirled around the little bird in a vortex, encasing her in a cocoon of green energy, until it's form turned into that of an egg. And with the precision that only someone with immense practice has, Madam Fate takes the green egg and places it in the body of child that had been stillborn, where the egg hatches and green energy flows out, forming a heart shape, giving the child that was dead upon birth a living soul, thus beginning the cycle of death and rebirth.</p><p>Within an instant, the baby took a deep breath and began to wail; signalling the fact that it was, in fact, alive to it's worried parents; as all the memories of it's past life came flooding back, along with the conversation she had with Madame Fate. She was Eve. She was Little Bird. And if she had thought to listen to what her new parents were saying right then, she would have realized much sooner that she was also Dorothy.</p>
