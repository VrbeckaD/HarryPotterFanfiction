    <p>She knew, that he knew that she knew that he knew that she had been acting strange. Unfortunately, there was not much that she could do about it, because for once in her life she really was bereft of words. She sighed once more, the thirty seventh sigh of that day, and reaching over, grabbed the glass of water that sat on the granite counter top. The slightest of shivers ran down her arm at the tension in the muscles, and down went the glass, water and all, breaking against the tiled floor with a miserable crash. She flinched at the sight, getting off from the high stool to gingerly pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>'Oh.' That was all that she breathed as a shard pierced her skin. A jingling sound that signaled someone turning the key in the door-lock drew her attention away from the crimson that blossomed on through the wounded flesh. She raised her head, cocking it to a side as she peered at the figure that entered. Joy bubbled in her as recognition sparked. 'Hey Dray. See, it's red!" she waved her hand at him, unmindful of the blood that trickled down her arm because of her movements.</p>
<p>He stumbled a little as his foot caught in against the welcome mat as he rushed over to where she sat, grinning up at him. Cradling her hand in his, he gently pulled at the glass still stuck in her palm. He got up then, bringing her to her feet along with him. Tugging her towards the sink, he turned the faucet on. Hermione watched her blood swirling down the drain, and then looked up at the person who held her hand. Draco Malfoy, the resident bad-boy-turned-good, her best friend. The same person she did not want to see in distress. Especially a distress similar to what his features had arranged themselves to portray.</p>
<p>'Oh.' Her eyes widened in comprehension. She rescued her hand from his grip and with newfound energy, rushed out of the kitchen into her bedroom, quickly locking the door behind her.</p>
<p>A moment of shock later, Draco pounded on the door. 'Hermione! Open the door. Open it right now!' She shook her head, giggling slightly. 'It's okay Dray.' She called out. 'I'm okay. This is just a nick.' The continuing flow of blood from the wound lent its strength to her increasing hysteria and she laughed, resting her head against the door.</p>
<p>'It isn't okay and you know it. Open the door Mi!' he banged on the wood. The shock of it transferred to her head. 'Ouch! That hurt.' She twisted her lips into a pout and opened the offending separator. And burst out laughing once more. In the countable seconds that had passed between her locking the door, Draco hair had been tousled into disarray and he was breathing heavily at the efforts he had had to put in, frown lines marring his worried facade. 'Come on.' He growled.</p>
<p>'You, Mister, are no fun. No fun at all.' She replied petulantly. He sent her a glare as he made her sit on the plush leather couch in the living room. 'Sit. Don't move.'</p>
<p>'But why…' Hermione beat her fists against the soft cushion on her lap.</p>
<p>'Just listen to me and stay put.'</p>
<p>'Idiot boy.' She harrumphed.</p>
<p>'What the hell?!' the sudden exclaim from the adjoining bathroom had her attention focused within a millisecond of its utterance. 'Oh no.'</p>
<p>Draco burst into the room at the same time that she got up from her place on the couch. 'I can explain…' she began.</p>
<p>'You better.' He waved the crumpled scrap of paper he had apparently brought with him, along with the medical kit he held in his other hand. She cringed inwardly, knowing fully well what information the paper held. A quick breath to calm herself had her thoughts organized.</p>
<p>'It's my bucket list.'</p>
<p>'No scar, Salazar.' He sneered at her. 'My question is-'</p>
<p>'Why do I have one? Doesn't everyone?' She gestured to the world at large at the last word, her gaze faltering as it fell on his disheveled and angry self.</p>
<p>'Not everyone has a bucket list with just three items.' He gritted out, a vein pulsing at his temple as his Adam's apple bobbed with barely suppressed anger. 'And what about the last one?' His voice cracked.</p>
<p>That broke Hermione's shell. 'What do you want me to say then, dammit?! That I'm dying and there's nothing anyone can do about it?' She felt sudden hot tears ran down her cheeks</p>
<p>His face turned ashen as their combined world crashed around them in that pastel room with its deep brown accouterments.</p>
