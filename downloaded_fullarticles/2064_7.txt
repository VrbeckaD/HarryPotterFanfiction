  <em>"I'm Hermione Jean Granger. I'm starting at Hogwarts today, are you going to Hogwarts, too?" </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ginevra Weasley, usually known as Ginny, looked up from trying to wake the family owl from what could potentially be either a deep sleep, or a coma. She wasn't sure what to say to this pronouncement. "Why did you tell me your middle name?" was all that she could come up with. And then, "Not this year, next year. I'm only ten." All together, it didn't make a lot of sense, but the older girl seemed to understand what she meant. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"That's a shame. When you come next year, please come and say hello to me," she said, then added anxiously, "Isn't one supposed to tell people one's middle name when one meets them?" </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ginny shook her head, abandoning the owl and standing up. She stuffed her hands in the pockets of her combat trousers and stared curiously at the girl in front of her. Brown skin and a bush of dark hair accentuated two very white, very protuberant front teeth. Ginny knew a lot of the magical families in Britain, but she didn't recognise Hermione; she must be a muggle. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Are your parents non-magical?" Ginny asked, and Hermione replied in the same anxious tone she'd used before, "Yes. Will it matter? Only I do hope I'm not behind already!" </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"It doesn't matter," assured Ginny, "we know heaps of non-magic families with magic kids. Dad loves muggles. I'm Ginny, by the way." </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione nodded, appearing unconvinced, then turned her head as a tall woman with the same curly hair called out to her "Her-mio-ne!" "I have to go. Thank you for talking. Goodbye!" Hermione flashed a quick, bright smile, then took off down the station platform towards her parents. Ginny wished suddenly that she wouldn't go, but it was too late - the girl was gone. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ginny sighed loudly - it seemed like everyone got to go to Hogwarts except her; it wasn't fair. She knelt back down on the platform, preparing to give mouth-to-mouth to the owl and - </em>
</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Ginny's reverie is disturbed by the fourteen year old version of the eleven year old in the memory. Hermione pushes through the crowd, clutching handfuls of pink dress robe and...sobbing? Ginny looks around for her date, Neville Longbottom, who'd gone to get them both drinks, but the crowd is large and noisy and the punchline is miles long: it'll take her forever to get to Neville and tell him where she's gone. She'll just go and check on Hermione, then be back before he even knows she's missing.</p>
<p>Faded red dress robes swinging loosely, Ginny elbows her way to the main staircase; she catches a glimpse of Hermione, face distorted by tears, shouting something at Ron, before running away and out of sight. Ginny takes the stairs two at a time (avoiding the trick step); as she runs, she reflects on her friendship with Hermione since that day on the train platform.</p>
<p>
  <em>It was Ginny's first day, the day of her sorting, and she nervously scanned the crowds at the Gryffindor table, searching for a familiar face. She bit her lip - Ron didn't seem to be there; neither did Harry Potter, that marvellous boy with his black hair and lightning scar who she'd been so excited to see again. But there was the girl from the station platform - Hermione Jean Granger; Ron had spoken about a Hermione in his (very brief) letters, but for some reason Ginny hadn't connected the names. Hermione was sitting at the Gryffindor table next to Ginny's twin brothers Fred and George; she was sitting very tall and straight, black robes unstained and bright, and the candlelight bounced off her, giving her a haloed appearance. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ginny was so busy staring that she almost forgot to move down the line of first years until somebody pushed her from behind. Ginny felt, suddenly, very afraid - what if she didn't get into Gryffindor? What if she was sorted into Slytherin or Hufflepuff? Mum and Dad would be upset, the twins would tease her, Ron would be a pig, Percy would be shocked - and Ginny would never get to sit next to Hermione at the Gryffindor table. I must get into Gryffindor, I must, I must, Ginny thought as her name was called and she stepped forward to the sorting stool, eyes on the ground. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Placed on her head, the Sorting Hat laughed softly as though it could hear her thoughts. "Oh, you're a brave one, little girl. The last of the Weasleys are you?" it said as Ginny's insides churned. "Yes, very brave...but then, you'll need to be. You'll do well in - GRYFFINDOR!" </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And Ginny was clapped and cheered for and she knew that Mum and Dad would be so pleased, and Percy was shaking her hand, which was nice if slightly ridiculous, and the twins were clapping her on the back, which was also nice, if very suspicious. But Ginny had eyes only for the dark girl who, leaning earnestly over the table said, "Oh, you're Ginny, Ron's sister! I'm so glad you're in Gryffindor." </em>
</p>
<p>This memory has taken Ginny all the way to the Gryffindor common room. In her haste, normally careful Hermione has left the door open and this uncharacteristic oversight alarms Ginny, who moves faster.</p>
<p>Apart from her sorting, Ginny prefers not to think about her first year - being possessed by a Dark Lord will do that to you, she thinks wryly. In her second and third years, Ginny has grown closer to Ron, Hermione, and Harry Potter, although always one step behind. Now, Hermione is tutoring Ginny in Herbology and History of Magic (her worst subjects), and they spend several hours a week in musty corners of the library reading up on wizard conventions and goblin rebellions. Hermione keeps a notebook full of observations on magical rebellions and revolutions - 'for future reference,' she says.</p>
<p>
  <em>Ginny sighed loudly and pushed her textbook away from her with the flat of her hand, annoyed by the incomprehensible page in front of her. What was it trying to tell her? To Ginny, it looked like several paragraphs of thick black, knotted text, inpenetrable and unreadable. But she just had to get through this chapter tonight, because her essay on water weeds was due the day after tomorrow - two whole feet of parchment. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione, sitting by the fire with her Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook propped on her knees, looked up at Ginny's sigh of annoyance and smiled at her. "Everything alright?" she asked, and Ginny was further annoyed by the feeling of tears pricking the back of her eyes. She couldn't fail this essay, she just couldn't, she'd failed the last one, and what if she had to repeat this year's Herbology? History of Magic was just as bad, and although Ginny was excelling in her Defense Against the Dark Arts classes with Professor Moody, and even her Potions classes, she hated falling behind in anything. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I don't understand this water weeds stuff," Ginny told Hermione, who jumped up and came over to Ginny's desk. Hermione leaned over the desk, frizzy ponytail flopping to the side. She tutted. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"It's ridiculous how they've written it. All it's trying to say is that there are seventeen different classifications of water weeds, and what they are. Oh, and the first person to classify water weeds was Doctor Ambrosious Foster in his Gloucester experiments with water weeds and flooding. They do make it sound so complicated." </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Really?" the tears disappeared and Ginny began to feel hopeful for the essay again. She glanced up at Hermione, who was leaning over the textbook, still scanning the pages. "Would you help me?" Ginny asked. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione nodded. "If you like. I do remember all this from last year." She pulled out the chair beside Ginny's and sat down, pulling a spare piece of Ginny's parchment towards her and lifting Ginny's quill pen. "Now, read that page again, and see if you can find all seventeen of the different classifications of water weeds they've mentioned. We'll write them down so you'll remember." </em>
</p>
<p>Although Ginny hasn't spent much time in Hermione's dormitory, her friend's bed is immediately obvious because of the muffled sobbing emanating from behind the closed bed curtains. Ginny eases the curtains apart and climbs up onto the high four poster bed, where Hermione looks up; she seems unsurprised by Ginny's appearance, managing only, "Ginny," through a sob.</p>
<p>"The one and only!" Ginny's voice is determinetdly bright. Shutting the bed curtains behind her, Ginny gently pushes Hermione's shoulders up so that she is sitting straight again. She eases herself onto the stark white pillow beside Hermione, who looks loose and empty sitting alone several inches away, arms wrapped tight around herself in a gesture of self comfort. Cautiously, Ginny touches one of Hermione's hands. Hermione unfolds her arms and grasps it like a lifeline. For some reason Ginny thinks she knows what's needed; she opens her arms and lets Hermione fall into them, although it means getting bits of hair gel all over the threadbare red fabric of her robes. Hermione's lovely pink robes will be crushed, heaven knows what she'll do if she needs to where them again soon, although the house elves will probably clean it for her if she leaves it out...Ginny tries to think about this. But it's difficult because Ginny's never been this close to Hermione before and it's doing something funny to her heart, making it beat too fast. She can feel the muscles in Hermione's back contract with each sob, Hermione's chin pressed hard against Ginny's shoulder. Ginny has a small moment of triumph mixed with fear - Ron isn't here, not even Harry Potter is; It's Ginny Hermione needs now. It's Ginny who's come to find her.</p>
<p>When Hermione's sobs turn into hiccups, Ginny pulls away and wipes her damp palms on her robes, crossing her legs out in front of her.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Ginny asks.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's just Ron being an idiot again. I know he's your brother, sorry, but it's really getting too ridiculous," Hermione is rooting under her pillow to find a tissue. She extricates a bundle of greyish lumps and pulls at one, frustrated.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry, I agree," says Ginny, and is rewarded by a slight smile. "It's such a shame," she goes on, "you were having such a nice time with Victor!"</p>
<p>"I wasn't really having a nice time," Hermione confesses, blowing her nose.</p>
<p>"Really? But it looked nice. You were laughing," Ginny says, not adding, 'I know you were laughing. I couldn't stop watching you.'</p>
<p>"It's a common myth that laughter always indicates enjoyment," says Hermione, sounding much more confident to be back to facts. "Laughter can actually be a response to danger; it indicates submission and the desire for escape. That's why you only laugh when someone else is tickling you." Hermione blows her nose again, then continues, "Victor kept touching me. I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. He's like that. Very tactile. I thought I'd better leave before it got any worse."</p>
<p>"If Victor's bothering you, you should tell McGonogall. She'll be onto him like a ton of bricks, you know she will," Ginny scowls at Victor's audacity then adds, "Or I've been working on a nice hex. What do you say, him and Ron both?"</p>
<p>Hermione laughs and says, "Hexing your own brother. Ginny, where are your morals?"</p>
<p>"Gone," says Ginny lightly, "Flown away, never to return."</p>
<p>Hermione sighs and goes on, "Anyway, then Ron was sulking just because he couldn't be bothered to ask me to the ball himself first, instead of as a last resort. It's like he expects me to read his mind."</p>
<p>"Why do you care what Ron thinks?" Ginny is curious.</p>
<p>"Well, he's my friend! I'm sick of him fighting with me all the time. It's distracting and unnecessary. Surely it's not that unusual, to want one's friends to treat one with some respect?"</p>
<p>Ginny turns away, tracing the wood grain in the bedstead with a nail; it's really a very unusual grain, the same one that all the Hogwarts bedsteads seem to be built in. She says, "What wood is this? it looks just like mine. So it's not that you're upset because...it's not because you like him, then?"</p>
<p>Hermione drops her head and begins shredding the massacred tissue in her hand. "All the bedsteads are made of willow, hazel, and oak wood. It's in Hogwarts: a History. No, not in that way. Just as a friend. But we are friends! I'd never had friends before I came here; I don't want to lose them now. Besides, I don't think I actually...I don't think I actually like boys. In that way."</p>
<p>Hermione lifts her head and looks at Ginny like she's saying something important. Then she turns away.</p>
<p>"Oh." Ginny's heart, which had threatened to stop its heart attack staccato, immediately speeds up again. If Hermione turns her head now, thinks Ginny, I will kiss her. Just once, to make her feel better. Just once, or maybe forever.</p>
<p>Hermione turns her head.</p>
<p>Ginny leans forward and inexpertly places her lips on Hermione's, who instinctively kisses back, lifting a hand to cup Ginny's face. Ginny can see all the lines carving Hermione's face into pieces; she's close enough to see the tracks where the tears ran, half dry salt rivers. Hermione's eyes are wide open, pupils dilated; she looks afraid, and hungry. Once, in the library, Hermione explained muggle electricity to Ginny. How, when the circuit of conductors is connected, the light switches on. Ginny thinks that that's what this feels like - like electricity. Like a lightbulb going on. Then Hermione pushes her away, softly, retreating backwards over the bedspread until there's several inches between them. "Don't, Ginny. My nose is all blocked, I can't breathe."</p>
<p>"Oh, right. We could try again tomorrow?" Ginny looks at her hopefully. Please tomorrow, she thinks. Please kiss me again when you can breathe.</p>
<p>But Hermione is lifting her mind away, pretending she's forgotten about how hungry Ginny makes her; soul hungry, like she's lost something that can only be found inside Ginny's green eyes. Pretending to forget because she's good and she doesn't want be wrong; Hermione doesn't want to be like the couples her parents glare at when they walk down the street holding hands. She says, "Just don't, Ginny. Please. It's wrong."</p>
<p>"It's not!" Ginny is angry, the circuit broken.</p>
<p>"I don't want to do this now. Please. Please, Ginny." Hermione looks tired, and sad. Her curls are springing out of their neat hairstyle, adding to the frazzled appearance, and Ginny softens. It's time to let go, she decides. Until tomorrow, anyway. She slides off the bed and opens the bed curtains, says, "Okay. Bye, Hermione." Her feet sound harsh and too loud as she strikes the floor with her flat dress shoes. She doesn't want to walk away.</p>
<p>Hermione follows her to the door. "Ginny, we'll study tomorrow? The library, after supper?"</p>
<p>The simple statement makes Ginny feel immediately more hopeful. "Yes, please, if you don't mind. I can't get a hold of this giant rebellion stuff."</p>
<p>Hermione laughs softly, leaning forward to hug Ginny so quickly Ginny almost can't feel it. Almost. "I'll help. You'll get it."</p>
<p>As she walks away, backwards down the corridor, Ginny calls out, "Don't cry for Victor and Ron. They're not worth it." Then she turns and runs back to the ballroom. Poor Neville won't have anyone to dance with.</p>
