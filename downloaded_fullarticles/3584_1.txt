  <em>August 3rd, 1997</em>
</p><p>Natalia’s throat burned with repressed sobs which she figured might be her hormones combined with the exhaustion after the pregnancy and the birth. She hadn’t cried since she was first inducted into the red room. Her chest was tight with both anxiety and exertion. But she was trained to use her mind and stick to her mission. She had a goal.</p><p>She was far out of reach of the red room, but she needed this to stay secret, and for that to happen it was imperative she do this quickly. Which wasn’t turning out to be much of an option from her current situation.</p><p>From what she’d catalogued so far, it was summer here, but there was unnatural weather, cold biting winds which didn’t belong to this time of year, and dark clouds which made her senses spike up. Her long repressed innate magic responding to the thick currents of it that hung in the air.</p><p>In the necessity of getting out of Russia to a magical community that would be safe for the child cradled tightly against her chest, she had somehow apparated herself into a climate heavy with what looked like a conflict of some sort.</p><p>Natalia had retreated the moment she’d realised what was happening. The part of her that she’d locked away for most of her life resurfacing, making sure she protected the only life in the world she truly cared about safe. Her son’s.</p><p>She’d apparated as far back into the surrounding woodland as she could whilst still attempting to monitor her surroundings.</p><p>She was still aching and drenched with sweat after giving birth less than an hour ago. Still wearing the medical gown she’d been given. The baby in her arms had fallen asleep after she’d picked him up, singing as quietly as she could to lull him after silently creeping up behind the doctor they’d left in the room to monitor her and the baby. They had expected her to be too weak to do much after giving birth. They hadn’t expected her to wrangle her way out of the binds that held her to the bed, let alone do it silently whilst the doctor had been turned to her as he examined her crying child. She knew what would follow next, but that hadn’t been what had made her move.</p><p>She loved the child. The first person she was willing to love since her parents died. Even her memory of them was twisted and faint. The red room wanted to use him, and she would rather suffer the consequences they would bestow on her than sacrifice him to a horrendous future to save herself.</p><p>The doctor's body was on the floor of that room now. Killed with one of the scalpels that’s she’d seized from the tray beside him. The doctors were never the strongest. But normally Natalia was bound and the fear of what awaited her if she disobeyed forced her to restrain herself. That and her mother’s last frantic warning. Never to use her magic. Never to show it.</p><p>If she did all that awaited her was death and suffering.</p><p>For the first time, she’d ignored her mother’s warnings. She’d never learnt to use her magic as her parents and her ancestors before her. She’d been inducted into the red room too early on. But she knew if there was ever a time for her to risk misusing it, this was the time.</p><p>She’d pushed her magic. Forced it to push her and the quietened, warm, fragile baby she’d wrapped in the only cloth she’d been able to get (the dead doctor’s coat) out of that place, to somewhere he could grow up in a magical community hidden from the rest of the world. Hidden from the red room.</p><p>And she’d landed herself in the middle of two duelling factions of a magical community it seemed.</p><p>There were two sides from what she could tell. Some of the wand wielders were cloaked and masked, and they shot sinister green spells at their unmasked counterparts.</p><p>Natalia didn’t know what the spell was, but it felt sickening, and as she saw it hit one woman – who fell dead instantaneously – she moved further back into the forest. Making sure to watch her steps with her bare feet.</p><p>She glanced down at her child as he shifted in his sleep, brow furrowing and mouth parting. He had little wisps of hair on his head. She thought they were red like hers but there was still blood on him from the birth so there was that. Too late Natalia realised what was about to happen as he screwed up his eyes.</p><p>He started screaming and Natalia turned and ran.</p><p>She heard someone yell from behind her and then spells were shot and she recognised she was being followed.</p><p>Sticks and leaves and other things she didn’t care to look at dug painfully into her feet, almost making her trip. She wasn’t accustomed to running barefoot, but that was hardly going to stop her.</p><p>Ducking under a tree branch she tried to shush him. He had quieted down when she sang to him before, but she was running now and she wasn’t sure whether she’d be able to do both.</p><p>She resorted to humming instead and gently pressing a finger against the baby’s mouth as she registered he might be hungry. She felt relief flow through her as he started suckling on it rather than screaming and so she ran faster.</p><p>“Wait.” A voice rang out behind her. It was a man and he sounded almost desperate, but if anyone knew about deception it was her, so she didn’t stop.</p><p>Bursting out into a clearing, Natalia took a right and changed the direction she was running, halting when she heard the person behind her burst through. If she didn’t move he wouldn’t be able to hear which direction she took and hopefully he would just keep on going straight.</p><p>But as she listened she realised there were more footsteps behind him and they stopped as they entered the clearing. She prayed that the baby in her arms would stay quiet as she got ready to run again the moment they came in her direction.</p><p>She looked down at the little body cradled in her arms as she quietened her breathing. His eyes were almost closed and he looked almost intent as he instinctively suckled on her finger. She let the smallest smile cross her face. She hadn’t thought she’d ever get to hold him.</p><p>“James. Where did she go?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I can’t hear her anymore and she was fast.”</p><p>“Do you think she was a muggle?”</p><p>“Where would she have come from? There isn’t a hospital near here.” A third voice, female this time chimed in. That meant there were at least three people after her.</p><p>“How do you know she came from a hospital. She might have given birth alone. Or at least not in a hospital.”</p><p>“I caught a glimpse of a hospital gown.”</p><p>“What if the Death Eater’s got to her? She probably is a muggle. They’ll kill her and the child.” At least that sounded like they weren’t going to kill her. From the tone’s over their voices Natalia would hazard a guess they were the unmasked ones and were genuinely concerned.</p><p>She still wasn’t about to give away her hiding place though. The sooner they were gone the sooner she could find a safe place for her child.</p><p>Only then her baby boy seemed to realise then that they’d stopped running and he was still hungry despite the finger he was suckling on. He made a small noise as his eyes opened further for the first time, seemingly in confusion, though he didn’t seem to be able to focus on anything before he scrunched them up again as he began crying. They were blue. Like most babies were.</p><p>She readjusted him against her chest, reaffirming the hold she had on him, shifting her footing and started running again as the people behind her cursed.</p><p>“Hey! We can help! Wait!”</p><p>Thoughts raced through Natalia’s head. She needed to get the crying child in her arms somewhere safe and soon in order for the next part of her plan to work. Otherwise, the red room would never stop looking for him. The potential of a genetically enhanced child who was born that way who they could manipulate to be their weapon would be too much for them to give up. And if they found Natalia’s altered genetics didn’t carry down they would kill him anyway.</p><p>If these people chasing her were genuine, then that meant they were currently her best bet at getting him to safety. Despite the fact they seemed to be at war. They could at least get him somewhere safer than the red room. They seemed to be English, and that was far enough away a child put up for adoption around this time wouldn’t be a flag for the red room. But Natalia had wanted to give him to a family rather than plant him the system. There was a better chance he’d grow up in the magical community then.</p><p>Could she take the risk?</p><p>It turned out the answer was yes because she slowed her run when she realised they weren’t shooting spells at her. That was probably the best she was going to get when determining if they were safe.</p><p>She turned around to face them, her stance still ready to duck or flee if she was wrong.</p><p>There was a man with dark messy hair and glasses. He was stood at the front and was looking at her cautiously, hands raised as though to ease her, blatant concern on his face. She figured he was the de-facto leader as the other two stood to the side of him. Another man who had an expression of trepidation mixed with concern. Less outright than the man by his side. Probably the result of never knowing who to trust. The woman had tied back red hair and green eyes. Her eyes flickered between Natalia and the child in her arms. It was obvious she was worried about them both, but most likely the fact there was a new-born baby in the woods not far from what had only minutes ago been a battlefield. Though the sounds had died down now.</p><p>She realised they were young, and probably fighting for a cause they believed in rather than for a political reason. It made them safer bets than she’d thought.</p><p>“We’re not going to hurt you.” The man in the middle spoke and his voice was the same one that had called out to her.</p><p>“Then will you help me?” Her voice wavered. She knew she could have restrained it, but she needed these people’s help, and they would help her more if she let them see her as defenceless and desperate.</p><p>Not far from the truth currently. Though she would never quite be defenceless. Perhaps vulnerable would be a better word.</p><p>Natalia didn’t risk moving her gaze from the three people in front of her, but she did shift her son again, moving him up to her neck, hoping her pulse would help calm him.</p><p>“We can get you to a hospital.” The man spoke to her, stepping forward slightly.</p><p>Natalia shook her head, slightly swaying. The motion almost controlled.</p><p>“No. I need you to help me.”</p><p>“How?” The other man stepped up to his friend's side and Natalia realised she’d never met someone with silver-grey eyes before. But he was asking the questions she needed and so that fact was quickly discarded as unimportant.</p><p>Not having any time to find the right way to do this, Natalia stepped towards them.</p><p>“I need you to take him.”</p><p>All their brows creased with surprise and confusion. Shock perhaps.</p><p>“Your child?” The woman spoke, and that was what Natalia really needed. Because this she could work with.</p><p>She angled herself towards the woman.</p><p>“He’s not safe. Not where I’m from. He needs to be kept safe in a magical community. Grow like an ordinary child.”</p><p>“We’re at war here.” One of the men cut in. He was obviously trying to be gentle, but Natalia already knew that.</p><p>“I know. But he’ll be safer with you. Claim he’d a distant cousin or nephew. He’ll die otherwise.” Without giving the other woman time to pull back, Natalia pushed her son into the young woman’s arms (she barely looked twenty). Almost instinctively the woman cradled him, not wanting to drop the crying baby.</p><p>“Hey. Wait. Stop.” The longer haired man spoke. The other one was looking shell-shocked and she guessed he was in some kind of relationship with the woman for him to respond that way.</p><p>“He’ll die with me. Worse even. Please. Even if you have to put him up for adoption. You’re my only chance.” She knew guilt-tripping them was low. But she’s never claimed to be honourable, and if this would give her son the best chance she would do anything.</p><p>“Hold up. You have to explain.” The guy grabbed for her arm and she ripped it backwards. It seemed to surprise him enough that he didn’t try again.</p><p>“I don’t have time. You think if I did I would be doing this? I am desperate.” Her eyes were still trained on her crying son as her voice strained, her accent coming through finally from where she’d been trained to eliminate it.</p><p>The woman seemed to realise this and stepped forward.</p><p>“What’s his name?”</p><p>Natalia knew it would probably be safer for her not to name him. It meant she wouldn’t know and would be less likely to give something away about him. It would give him one less tie to her. But she couldn’t do it. She didn’t think she’d get to name him, and despite that, she’d already spent too much time in the dead of night when he kicked her stomach wondering what she’d call him in an alternate universe where she had that opportunity.</p><p>She considered his father’s name but decided against it. She’d wanted him to have a little piece of her with him. It was all she could give him.</p><p>“Nikolai.” She reached out to brush his cheek briefly, and miraculously he quietened.</p><p>She looked up at the woman who staring at her as though she didn’t know what to think.</p><p>She knew what she saw. A woman who was willing to give up her child to complete strangers she had been running from only minutes ago, but who had desperation in her eyes and her words. Who was trying to be distant with her son, because she was going to have to leave him, but she loved him and the tenderness broke through.</p><p>In the end, it didn’t matter. They didn’t have to know her or her reasons. They just had to take care of him.</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>The woman stared at her and then gave an abrupt nod.</p><p>“Lily!” Both the men exclaimed next to her, but it was enough for Natalia.</p><p>“Love him.” She kissed Nikolai’s head, revelling in him for one second before she stepped backwards.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>She ignored the men as they made noises of protest and she commanded her magic to pull her back to the road closest to the red room, bordering the forest where she’d run to when she needed them not to suspect her of magic. They’d be searching for her now, so she was quick with what she needed to do.</p><p>It was easy to pull the nearest car to her. She’d done enough magic by now to not hesitate before she just forced them to speed up before halting next to her.</p><p>She killed the man who opened the door to yell at her by smashing his window in and stabbing him in the throat with a shard of glass.</p><p>Shoving him back into the car was easy, and then she managed to remove the gas tank after removing the back seat (she was lucky in that the car was old, so it didn’t take much) and using a spanner she found in the boot to lift up the metal covering it (she had to make it look like she did it, even if she used magic). She poured the fuel over the front of the car and ripped open the wires.</p><p>Quickly, she used her already exhausted magic to fashion some of the nearby dirt and grass into an imitation of a dead infant. She wasn’t quite sure how she did it, and it definitely didn’t look like Nikolai but Natalia felt bile rising in her throat at the sight of the seemingly dead infant anyway.</p><p>She placed the body in the car and started it up, watching as it set on fire, and speeding up the process so it looked as though it had already been burning for ten minutes at least.</p><p>Done, she collapsed a little way away from the burning car and retched.</p><p>They found her passed out there and woke her up before dragging her back to the compound, where they forced her to tell them what she’d done.</p><p>They suspected her of lying. Not willing to believe she’d killed the child. The chance of him being alive making them send people out to search anywhere they could think of. But they didn’t find him and eventually admitted the child was dead.</p><p>She paid for it of course. When she went under the knife for the sterilisation treatment it was particularly painful, and it was by far not her only punishment, but Natalia didn’t regret it.</p><p>Even if she never saw him again, her son was safe from those that would seek to use him and harm him, and with all hope, he’d be happy too. She’d done that for him.</p>
