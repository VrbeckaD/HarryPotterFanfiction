    <p>Credence realized, eyes open, he had never really seen the stars. Not like this.</p><p>New York’s night sky had been permanently shrouded in smog and city lights way before he was born. His lungs were used to the ashen taste of its air, the salt of the rivers and the sea whenever he wandered too close to the coastline, the nauseating stench of garbage strewn on the streets during a hot summer day.</p><p>He had liked it, the first night he spent at Mr. Graves’ apartment and dared to get close to the window. He had never been so far up, not consciously at least. The shimmer of the lights had dazzled him, made him feel the city indeed had something to offer to him. Maybe. Something beautiful and secret.</p><p>Today, though, they had Apparated to the old Graves Manor, somewhere in the Catskills. And as Credence opened the dining room window, stepped into the balcony, the warm smell of earth and grass and dew had almost bowled him over - so unfamiliar and so sweet. And he had looked up.</p><p>The city stars were a smattering of fireflies against violet, paling in comparison to the dazzle of and New York's lights. But nothing man-made could stand a chance against the magnificence of the starry sky, eternal and unchanging, displayed like a lazy river of diamonds so close he swore he could touch it.</p><p>Credence had been trying hard to let go of his former life and its prejudices, but his first instinct was to think, <i>this is what being before God must feel like.</i></p><p>There was the slightest quirk in Graves’ mouth as he got closer, held him from behind. He pressed a soft kiss against Credence’s nape.</p><p>“You know, I don’t really have an use for this place. But I should have thought of bringing you here sooner.”</p><p>“I had never…”</p><p>“Been outside the city?”</p><p>Credence nodded, but they knew it was more to it than than that. Still, he sighed and relaxed into the embrace. Words felt difficult right now. Some days, he still woke up with his heart racing, convinced the soft sheets of their bed would melt away into cheap sackcloth anytime now. Good things happening to him, they still overwhelmed him from time to time.</p><p>Graves wouldn't take this moment from him. He did summon his well-kept Ilvermorny copy of <i>Night Sky: Astronomy For The Unversed</i> from the table with a gesture, but he set it aside on the railing next to the already installed telescope, untouched. He sighed in contentment and looked up as well.</p><p>“We can start the lesson later.”</p>
