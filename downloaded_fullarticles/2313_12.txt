    <p>He sits in the hallway, against the wall. The stone is cool against his back, grounding him against the sea of emotions, the bitterness and resentment and anger.</p><p> </p><p>He was at the table, a few hours before the full moon. Him and James and Peter and Remus, huddled at the end of the long table, whispering in hushed voices about tonight’s transformation. There was some sort of staff meeting that night, and they had to make sure that they were hidden and unseen, make sure that they could keep Remus’ secret. It was getting harder, sneaking out of the castle. Too many nosy people, the Slytherins taking more interest in them ever since Sirius ran away. There were the taunts too, mocking smirks and subtle sniggers, whenever they thought Sirius was alone. Hey, Black. Running away again? Cut off from your family name? Mudblood loving fag?</p><p>He was good at ignoring them, though, had learned how to over the days and months and years. They couldn’t do anything, not any more, the words like ash and mist compared to the torture he had once faced.</p><p>It was still a shock, realizing that he was gone, that they couldn’t hurt him, that he was free. A shock, to realize that there would be no more screaming, no more curses, no more scars carved onto his flesh. He had left, and he wasn’t going to ever look back.</p><p>The sounds of the owls cut through his thoughts, thousands of wings echoing in the hall. He always loved this part, the feathers and the beaks and the glowing eyes, rustling paper and the sound of wings. It had always appealed to him, the idea that you could outfly your problems in the sky, amongst the clouds.</p><p>He’s staring at the owls when he sees it.</p><p>It’s a handsome screech owl, the Black family crest dangling from it’s collar, and Sirius feels his heart drop into his stomach as it swoops above him. James and Peter and Remus are still lost in conversation, the owls ignored, but all Sirius can do is stare as he sees the letter being dropped into his lap.</p><p>He can barely remember leaving, shoving his chair under the table and muttering some half-assed excuse to the others. Fleeing, walking aimlessly, up and down the stairs until his legs were burning and his feet were numb. He sank down, against the nearest wall, the letter in his hand creased from his shaking hands.</p><p>It was interesting that his family still had that much power over him, that his mother could still make him feel faint with a single letter. He hated that part of himself, hated that he still cared, still have a damn about what they thought of him. With trembling hands, he spits open the seal, pulling out the thin paper with his fingers.</p><p>The letter is blunt, to the point, as if they couldn’t be bothered with their useless, wasted son.</p><p>
  <em>You are no longer part of this family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You no longer have any right to our name.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Never come back to us.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Never contact us or our son.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Good riddance.</em>
</p><p>Across the bottom was scrawled several words, in a hand that could only belong to his mother: <em>Blood-Traitor Loving Queer.</em></p><p>It hurts, a twisting blade inside of him, knocking the breath out of Sirius and making him feel dizzy with disbelief. It’s ironic, so bitterly and terribly ironic, that the one thing he once wanted more then anything in the world was now right in front of him. He scans the paper again, imagining his father typing it out, his mother scrawling words across it in black ink. They hadn’t bothered to wait, it seemed, perfectly fine to cut their eldest son out of their life.</p><p>He sets the paper down, his body shaking against the wall. He tried, tried so damn hard to forget it, to pretend he didn’t care. <em>Fuck them, </em>he whispers to himself<em>. Fuck them, and their pure-blooded bullshitted way of life. You’re better off without them.</em></p><p>A small splotch of ink catches his eye, and he turns the paper over to find a hastily scribbled message on the back:</p><p>
  <em>They’re watching me. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Don’t try and contact me. Don’t talk to me. Don’t come back.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m sorry.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Reg</em>
</p><p>Sirius lets his head fall back, the agony rising up inside of him. He was selfish, so goddamn selfish, abandoning his little brother to his screwed up parents.</p><p>“I should have stayed,” he whispers, to the darkness of his knees, his face pressed into them, huddled into a tiny ball. “I should have stayed.”</p><p>There are footsteps down the corridor, light and too-casual, and Sirius tenses. He closes his eyes, pulls the cocky smirk and the glinting eyes and the arrogant air onto his face, shoving himself deeper into his shell. He stretches out a leg, shoving the letters into his pocket, the epitome of relaxation.</p><p>He winces, internally, as Snape comes up the stairs. He’s sipping wet, covered in mud, and as his eyes fall on Sirius, he raises an eyebrow. “So. The great Sirius, alone in a hallway. What’s wrong, Black? Hiding from your mother?”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius scoffs, something vicious twisting inside his chest. He needs something, anything to take the edge off, dull this whirlwind of emotion inside his chest. He can’t stop himself as he replies, “Thought something smelled shitty in here. But it’s just you, isn’t it Snivellus?” Sirius frowns. “Or maybe it’s just the mud.”</p><p>Snape laughs, the sound forced and unnatural. “Brave words, coming from a queer-loving faggot.”</p><p>Sirius just shrugs, refusing to let the sting show. “You really ought to think of something more creative, Snivellus. You’ve been using that one for years.”</p><p>Snape laughs again, the noise seeming to grate inside his chest. “Where’s your boyfriend, Black? And the rest of those mudbloods?” He spits the words like they are daggers, his eyes gleaming with some strange light.</p><p>Anger flares inside Sirius’ chest. He knows he should walk away, before he said something truly stupid, but he can’t help it as he says, “Don’t talk about them like that.”</p><p>Snape smirks, a mocking grin, pressing his advantage. “Like what? It’s true, you know. Potter and his arrogance, Pettigrew and his softness, and Lupin. Gosh, that boy is daft. Dresses out of the rubbish bin, but you’ll shag anything, won’t you Bla - “</p><p>The roaring fills Sirius’ ears, a haze settling over everything. His voice is quiet, cold as ice as he says, “You’re one to talk, hounding over Evans like that. Following her like a bloody dog, hoping that she’ll throw you a scrap of her attention.” He scoffs. “When are you going to learn that Evans won’t date an overgrown, greasy little weasel of a - “</p><p>There’s a bang - Sirius feels his head being knocked back as a white-hot streak carved through his face. He laughs it off, though, ignores the pain as he mocks Snape. “And your aim is shitty too. It’s a wonder you can still see Evans, when you can’t even hit me with a binding spell from 2 feet - “</p><p>Snape’s voice is heated, anger pouring off him in waves. “Don’t you dare talk about her, she’s out of your league you little fag.”</p><p>Sirius just laughs. “Evans? Evans is completely out of my league. She’s amazing, and there is no chance in hell that she’s ever date a shitbag like you. And why would I date her, seeing as I’m just a fag? He shrugs, turning to go, noting the sun setting in the sky. “In any case, have fun, Snivellus. Try washing your hair - don’t drown in all the grease that comes out of it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He’s halfway down the hall when Snape shouts out. “Do you think I don’t know?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He doesn’t bother to look at him. “Know what, love? We all know your hair is absolutely disgusting...”</p><p>Snape laughs, almost manically, his face bright red as he screams back at Sirius. “Know your secret! The big one, that all you keep.” He spits. “Of course it’d be you. The Queer and the Animal, a match made in heaven.”</p><p>Sirius whirls. He shoves Snape against the wall, knocking his head against a lamp. “What did you say?”</p><p>Snape glares back at him. “You know what I said. You and your vileness. Wouldn’t be below you to fuck a werewolf, would it?”</p><p> </p><p>It’s as if Sirius has been shot. An icy numbness shoots down, turning his body to lead. Dimly, he can head Snape laughing, laughing as he smirks. “Wasn’t that hard to find out anyways. Remus always missing class the days of the full moon.” He spits. “Wonder how Lily would feel, if she knew her friend was a goddamn werewolf. Thanks for confirming it.”</p><p>Sirius slams him against the wall again. Panic is staring to bloom in his chest, a desperate, echoing feeling, terror that Snape knows. “Shut the hell up. He’s not...he’s not an animal.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Snape just scoffs. “Is he?”</p><p>With a roar, Sirius snaps, pressing him against the wall. He punches Snape, square but the jaw, and Snape shrieks as Sirius’s fists crushes his nose. “If you tell anybody....”</p><p>Snape smirks. “So I’m right. And look, it’s the full moon tonight.” He gives Sirius a tiny smirk. “Wonder who’s transforming right now?”</p><p>“Severus, I swear to god - “</p><p>Snape just laughs. “Alliges Duplica.”</p><p>Suddenly, Sirius is frozen, collapsing to the ground as Snape laughs. “Thought you were the only one with tricks, yeah Black? Tough.” He steps over him, slamming his heel onto Sirius’ stomach. “I wasn’t sure if Lupin was a werewolf, but you basically confirmed it for me.” He leans closer, where Sirius is panting in pain, fire traveling up and down his limbs. “I wonder how he’s going to feel, when he realizes that you told his deepest secret.”</p><p>Sirius tried to speak, to scream, to say anything, but all Snape does is smirk. “Reckon you’ll miss the moon tonight. If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to find Lupin.”</p><p>”No - “ Sirius croaks, but it’s too late. Without another word, Snape sweeps off, leaving Sirius frozen on the ground, his wand kicked to the side as the moon started to rise.</p>
