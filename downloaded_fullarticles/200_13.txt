  <em>
    <span>London Grimmauld Place, December 20. 1978</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was an old, opulent mansion in the heart of London. But for decades none of the people around seemed to notice this impressive building. Hidden from the world around, it came across to be remained in the last century. With high, narrow windows, the gothic exterior, with it’s intricately carved entrance of snakes, appeared as imposing and ancient as the most noble family that lived there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black was as formidable and eccentric as their main residence. The Black Family was infamous for their intellect, power and temper. Behind closed doors you could hear others even call them batshit crazy. Those, who weren’t as deranged were no part of the family anymore. Whether it was by Burned off the family tree, disinherited or killed by their loving family members. <span>But at the moment, their home was peaceful and quiet. Especially since they were still asleep. The first stirring came at the crack of dawn. A small creature with big batlike floppy ears, grey skin and many wrinkles fought its way out of its cabinet in the basement kitchen. Kreacher, their house elf had work to do, he needed to start the breakfast for its masters, and mistress. </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was proud to work for them up to the day he would be too old to work and he looked forward to the day when his head would hang in the foyer, where all heads of his ancestors were stored by the mistress of the house. It was truly an honour to work until death for such a noble family. He would never willingly betray them. Disobedience would shame not only him, but his beloved mistress and young master.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But today, everything would change. Not exclusively for Kreacher, but for all magical kind. Not that they knew about it just yet. Kreacher felt something strange in the bond between him and his masters. It wasn’t as strong and unyieling as it was normally.  The ambient magic, which surrounded him was heavy, as if something big would disturb the normally calm surface of magic. It was foreboding and almost violent, panicked full of sorrow and pain. But Kreacher did not dwell on feelings, he had work to do. So went the time by, while the loyal elf took care of all household tasks. The breakfast was prepared, the kitchen was cleaned, and now the sound of activity filtered through the dark and narrow halls of Black Manor.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first to rise was the heir Black. He took his time to awake properly and groom himself like it was expected for his noble breeding. The heir of Walburga and Orion Black was their youngest son Regulus Arcturus, who had just returned home a few days prior due to today's upcoming celebrations of Yule, the winter solstice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was the second yule celebration since he became heir, and it was his duty to stand by his family, while they would honour the old traditions</span>
  <em>
    <span>. He lost himself in his thoughts.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Prior to that, his elder brother Sirius was the heir. He never had been interested in anything that would have been befitting to his station as a member of an ancient and noble Bloodline. No, he even fought actively against it. It has been an open fought war between his mother and brother for years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius disgraced the family at the tender age of 11, by being sorted into the Gryffindor House, consorting with blood traitors, half breeds and mudbloods. Openly! All those, who in his family's eyes,were beneath them and a threat to their society by diluting the magical blood and power as well as for not carrying on their traditions. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had betrayed his family, his blood. He ran away, and took Regulus chance to live as free as possible with him that night. So it was not surprising, that his parents were set off by only the mention his name. Regulus hated Sirius. Now he was the heir, now <em>he</em> had to uphold the family honour, now <em>he</em> had to serve a maniac, who tortured others for the fun of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was no knock on the door. No - Walburga swept inside his room, without being asked for or being allowed. It was just not her style to ask for permission for anything. She stood in front of him making him feel small, inadequate, and lacking, as always. The room cooled significantly down, as if her frozen heart could cool the whole world. Her gaze wandered from top to bottom, searching for anything missing. Her eyes were just as cold as her heart and Regulus knew, she searched for any sign, that he would be as much as a disappointment as his older brother.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Naturally, she found him lacking. And so she disturbed the peace of the morning and began her monologue. How </span>
  <em>
    <span>proud</span>
  </em>
  <span> she was of him, to behold the family honour by serving the Dark Lord. In moments like this, Regulus was quite pleased that he had mastered occlumency on such a level, that even Severus, the Dark Lord, his </span>
  <em>
    <span>mother</span>
  </em>
  <span> could not break into his mind. Without that, </span>
  <em>
    <span>she</span>
  </em>
  <span> already would have cursed him. Like she had done to Sirius, since he was a child. Regulus caught his thoughts wandering and began to listen to her clamouring. Oh, her Dark Lord, the true power of blood purity, and eliminating everything threatening the magical world. Pure Bloods had to show those scum their place. First, by providing a visual sign of their worth. If the sons and daughters of the sacred 28 would not be able to even dress themselves properly, everything else would fail as well. She turned up her nose at the sight his robes. Regulus raised a brow. They were traditional and ridiculously expensive. He had bought them himself only days before from Twilfit and Tattings. They were even quite a sight -black silk with </span>
  <span>tasteful emerald, ivory, and blood-red embroidery- the colours of Yule.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ah... now he understood. She had not selected them, and he had the gall to choose something red. Sirius always wore red, like Gryffindor. Just a few stitches could set her off so easily... Regulus wanted to shake his head, while she  berated his loyal house elf Kreacher for allowing these “disgusting rags” into the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regulus decided to stop her now, before he had to endure her foul mood all day. He excused himself for the faux pas and signaled her to leave the room, so he could change into her choosing, a set of black and silver dress robes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And while she was gone, Regulus changed out of his clothing and into her choice. One had to choose their battles wisely. And so the truth festered in his heart. He would never be good enough for </span>
  <em>
    <span>her </span>
  </em>
  <span>or for his father. The second choice, never the first, and even that because there was no other to be picked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he put on his new shirt, he thought back to Sirius. </span>
  <span>But he would never speak about it, never speak about him, even if he missed his brother so much. Sirius had sheltered him as much as an older brother could have done, to the point that Sirius had almost broken himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And now, the boy without a choice started his day. Suddenly, the magic shifted around him. It smelled like change, tasted like revolution, and brought with it some needed hope. Regulus did not know, if it would get better. But he knew, to get better, it had to change. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Blacks were not the only magicals, who felt the shift in magic. Today, everything would change for magical Britain, even if most of them would never know about it.</span>
