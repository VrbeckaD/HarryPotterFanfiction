    <p>Harry was sitting on a couch and Hermione was on top of him gyrating her hips slowly. Ron was standing beside them a little awkwardly, and holding Hermione's head thrust or just let her do the job herself; Hermione deep-throated him without a problem like always. From time to time Ron would pull out for a bit of respite and Harry used the opening to kiss with Hermione.</p><p>In the heat of the moment a mishap happened and Ron's glistening with Hermione's saliva cock mashed against Harry's half-open mouth.</p><p>"Sorry, mate," said Ron horrified as he regained balance.</p><p>Harry not batting an eye opened his mouth, leaned to Ron and enveloped him with his lips. For several seconds both Ron and Hermione watched shocked as Harry was slowly sucking on Ron's cock before Ron staggered back and almost fell from the couch.</p><p>"Harry, you just took my cock in your mouth!" he exclaimed.</p><p>"I'm aware..." said Harry. "What?!" He looked back and forth between Ron and Hermione. "Hermione did it a minute ago and you said nothing."</p><p>"Mmm... Mate, don't do it again."</p><p>"You started it," said Harry grinning. "I didn't ask you to force yourself into my mouth."</p><p>"It was an accident!"</p><p>"Whatever. But okay - no means no."</p><p>"Hey! Why not??" said Hermione finally finding her voice. "Ron, I'd like watch Harry suck your cock! It was hot!"</p><p>"I'm up for it. But no thrusting. Unlike Hermione, I gag too easily."</p><p>"I..." stammered Ron. "No. I don't... Definitely not. We aren't doing this."</p><p>Harry without blinking pulled Hermione back into a kiss.</p><p>...</p><p>Hermione took the steaming cup Ron was giving her and sat down beside Harry. "Are we going to address it or what?" she said after taking a gulp.</p><p>"Address what?" said Harry.</p><p>"The thing that happened as we all were naked, what else?"</p><p>"I thought that you came..."</p><p>"Harry, stop playing dumb! How come you were ready to give Ron a blowjob?"</p><p>Harry shrugged. "I sort of just was..."</p><p>"Sort of?! We've been having sex for close to half of the past year! Well, with Ron less, but still... And you've never before sort of was!"</p><p>"I was. Just never mentioned it."</p><p>"And why not??"</p><p>"I should have?"</p><p>"Mate, am I wrong, or this wasn't your first time?" said Ron.</p><p>"It wasn't."</p><p>"And??" said Hermione.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Are you going to tell us or what? How come you've been giving blowjobs and nor I nor Ron know about?!"</p><p>"There are other things that you don't know about. Should I have made a grand announcement or something?"</p><p>"You did tell us about your first kiss! The one with Cho."</p><p>"Well, it wasn't my first kiss, but yes, I did tell you about my first kiss that was with her."</p><p>"I don't want to press, but will you please tell me... Us, about it?" said Hermione.</p><p>"There was one... Mmm... Well, in Hogwarts I've had a friend you don't know about. I've been giving him head sometimes. That's it."</p><p>"What?! You've had a boyfriend?!"</p><p>"No. He wasn't my boyfriend, just a friend like you two. How should I put it... We three are normal friends. At least friends how I always imagined friends should be, but he and I had a special relationship from the very beginning. Also a friendship, but a different one. With him I was able to talk frankly about things I wasn't comfortable discussing with you."</p><p>"There were something you've kept from us??"</p><p>"I wouldn't say kept... Just didn't tell."</p><p>Hermione frowned at the non-answer he gave. "And who is he? Do I know him?"</p><p>"I won't say his name."</p><p>"Why not?" Hermione kept grilling.</p><p>"We agreed to keep it that way. After I was selected into the Triwizard tournament, and you, Ron, behaved like an ass, I sort of befriended him. One thing led to another and I ended up sucking his cock one rainy day."</p><p>"What kind of friends do that?!" exclaimed Hermione.</p><p>Harry grinned. "What we've been doing for the past months?"</p><p>"That's different. We're just decided to have fun to break the monotony. Nothing more."</p><p>"I wouldn't say that we were having fun, at least at the start, but sort of we were as well from time to time."</p><p>"And he... He also went down on you?"</p><p>"He wasn't... Isn't into blokes, but he did give me handjobs sometimes. Sort of like to be fair, for my blowjobs."</p><p>"I can't believe you've had a boyfriend three years ago, whom you never mentioned to us!"</p><p>"I repeat - he wasn't my boyfriend. And it wasn't only in my fourth year. We've been friends since then."</p><p>"If you won't tell us who he is, at least tell us something - how you've met for instance."</p><p>"It's kind of embarrassing..."</p><p>"Harry!"</p><p>"Well, he stumbled upon me crying at the astronomy tower at night few days after I became a champion. He sat down beside me and asked what was wrong or something like that, and before I could help myself, everything came pouring out of me. For days afterwards I was terrified that he might blab it to somebody, but he hadn't. A week later I found a note in my pocket saying that if I wanted to talk again, to write time and place on that charmed piece of paper and he'll get there. So our meetings began."</p><p>"You mean dates."</p><p>"You intend to put words into my mouth, or should I tell it? It's like you know better."</p><p>"Sorry. Continue."</p><p>"You two are my best friends, but he is... I dunno. A different kind of friend. I never talked with him about you-know-who and stuff like that much, but instead we were very open with each-other about other things I never talked with both of you about."</p><p>"Like what?"</p><p>"Small things that now seem insignificant, but at that time were very important to me. Personal things, the stuff I was embarrassed to talk to you about. He also found an outlet in me in that regard."</p><p>"And how could that turned into you giving him head?"</p><p>"You really want to know?"</p><p>"Sure. If you remember."</p><p>"Do you think I'd forget the first blowjob I've given??"</p><p>"I don't want to know," mumbled Ron.</p><p>"Nobody forces you to listen. You can leave," said Hermione dismissively. "I'd like to hear it. With some juicy details of course."</p><p>Ron grumbled but didn't move.</p><p>"How juicy?"</p><p>"Whatever you're comfortable to share."</p><p>"Maybe before we've started to have sex together, I wouldn't have been at all, but now I don't mind describing how squishy his pink cockhead felt between my lips for the first time as -"</p><p>"Not THAT juicy!" exclaimed Ron. Harry grinned at his antics.</p><p>"This was just days before I had to face a dragon at the first task. We were talking as always. I was lying with my head on his lap as he was playing with my hair."</p><p>"What friends do that??" said Ron.</p><p>"The kind that we were. Anyway, I fell asleep. As I woke up, he happened to have an erection - he was wearing sweatpants, so it very apparent. At that point he already knew that I liked both boys and girls. He -"</p><p>"Why did he know about it, and we didn't?!" exclaimed Hermione.</p><p>"I was ashamed at that time to tell you... What do you want from me?? Should I continue or what?"</p><p>"Yes, sorry."</p><p>"Anyway, he was embarrassed about his erection, but since we decided to be quite open with each-other, I've said that if he wanted, I could take care of it, even though I never done that before. He was reluctant because he wasn't able to reciprocate and blabbered about fairness or something, but I said that it wasn't important for me at that time. As I've said, - the first task with a dragon was only a few days away and I said that there was a real chance that it might end badly and that I didn't want to die without ever trying it. I didn't believe in it myself, but the words on their own came out as I really wanted to try and didn't think such chance would happen any time soon. I did tell him about it already after the fact. Anyway, he agreed and came in under a minute."</p><p>"Details!" said Hermione.</p><p>"You don't know how blowjobs are given?" Harry said with raised eyebrows. "I just turned to the side, pulled down both of his waistbands and took his cock into my mouth. As I've said - it was really quick. I sucked a bit awkwardly, he came, I swallowed." Harry grinned again at Ron's grimacing face. "He said afterwards that he was thinking I was talking about a handjob, but decided not to stop me. It was first time for both of us. We kissed for the first time right after the blowjob."</p><p>"Kissed?! But you said that he wasn't into blokes!"</p><p>"He isn't. We never did it with tongues, just nibbled each-other's lips a bit. It was very sweet and not like kisses of passion or something. He said that he had nothing against kissing with lips and that brits are too uptight about it."</p><p>"So he's a foreigner," said Hermione decisively.</p><p>"Does one have to be a foreigner to criticize Britain? It might sound strange. But for me he was a combination of a friend, boyfriend, and a parent. When I was... Let's call it whining about my problems - he was a parent, when he was - he was a friend, and blowjobs and stuff like that was a boyfriend part."</p><p>"So you admit that he was you boyfriend then," said Ron.</p><p>Harry sighed. "I've said - no. But whatever... You can assign him whatever role you want."</p><p>"Harry, please continue," said Hermione.</p><p>"That was it."</p><p>"No! Tell us more - how did you manage to keep it from us? Where did you meet?"</p><p>"Almost always it was after hours. It varied, but generally we met few times a month in... Well, we met at night close to his tower, since only I had invisibility cloak - he mastered Disillusionment only by the end of last year and we wanted to be safe, then we went to the unused part of the castle, choosing randomly some classroom on upper floors. There he Transfigured something into a couch - he's really good at it, then we talked about stuff for several hours. It didn't always lead to me giving him head of course, but sometimes it did. So was with handjobs he was giving me. But we did often kiss. Last year sometimes we slept together. And I mean literally slept. Nothing more. So don't get any ideas. We were sort of shoulder to cry one for one another. He had his problems, I had mine. And don't get me wrong, it's not like I or he were crying every time we met. It did happen on occasion, but often we just talked normally. Maybe kissed. Sometimes wanked together. His cock looks very cute while not erect."</p><p>"Harry, don't get me wrong," said Hermione, "I believe that he wasn't your boyfriend, but the way you talk about him... It's like you did have a crush on him."</p><p>"I never said that I hadn't. Just a bit of a crush, that I was able to keep in check. He knew about it."</p><p>"So you would've dated him?"</p><p>"Yes. And I said him as much." Harry closed his eyes smiling dreamily. "He's such a great guy... I was never so intimate with anybody as I was with him."</p><p>"Mate, you literally fucked Hermione then went down on her just now."</p><p>"It was fun, it had nothing to do with intimacy I've had with him."</p><p>Hermione sighed deeply. "Why you've never talked about him?"</p><p>"We decided to keep it between us while we were at Hogwarts. And it was easier that way."</p><p>"But we long not in Hogwarts."</p><p>"It's just never came up."</p><p>"Was he bigger or smaller than you?" said Ron.</p><p>"Not was, but is. And he's taller than me. Even half of girls in our year were taller than me, so it's not like it's of any indication. I'm a midget due to my loving relatives." Harry grinned.</p><p>"No, I was asking about the size of his cock. Bigger than yours?"</p><p>"Ronald!" exclaimed Hermione.</p><p>Harry looked at Ron pointedly and smirked. "And why sudden interest in penises?" Ron scowled. "No, he has a smaller cock. About your size."</p><p>"Maybe that's why he didn't want to give you head? You're big after all."</p><p>"No, that wasn't the case. As I've said - we were very open with each-other. He just wasn't into it. He likes only girls."</p><p>"But you snogged!"</p><p>"Ron, Harry said that it wasn't like this."</p><p>"But Harry never kissed me!"</p><p>"Ron," said Harry wiggling his eyebrows. "If you want - we can kiss right now, even with tongues."</p><p>Ron's mouth opened and closed silently like a fish's. "No. I didn't mean it like that."</p><p>"I've known you for 7 years and you not once mentioned that you're bi!" said Hermione.</p><p>"I didn't know it myself until maybe 2nd year. But that's beside the point. As I've said, there were lots of things I never talked with you about."</p><p>"But talked with him."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"WHY?!! I... We're your best friends!"</p><p>"That was exactly why. With him it was easier at first because we weren't friends at the start, but total strangers. As I've said - it was spontaneous at first. But then it just was already established between us, so we just kept it up."</p><p>"I can't believe you like blokes... You've seen me naked during showers!"</p><p>"See?" said Harry looking at Hermione. "And you're asking me why I never told two of you about him or me being bi. And Ron, even if I didn't like men too - I did see your junk just now and dozens of times as three of us had sex before."</p><p>"That's not the same!"</p><p>"I never found you attractive anyway."</p><p>"You tried to suck my cock!"</p><p>"No. This was only after you almost forced it in my mouth. You looked as though you just killed a unicorn, so I just tried to defuse the situation and show that it wasn't a big deal."</p><p>Ron only opened his mouth to retort as Hermione pointed an index finger right in his face and said, "Ronald, shut up."</p><p>"Okay, sorry..."</p><p>"Ah, forget about it..."</p><p>"But you want to blow me?"</p><p>"What part about me not finding you attractive did you not understand? If you want me to - sure, I CAN do it. Do I want to do it? Not really, even though I do like giving blowjobs. Dicks are fun, right, Hermione?" Hermione nodded grinning.</p><p>"What's wrong with ME?"</p><p>"Nothing. You don't find every girl attractive, do you? So am I, only I have to add guys to such list."</p><p>"Was he in our year? At least from Gryffindor?" mumbled Ron.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"No to what?"</p><p>"That was a no to answering both."</p><p>"But Hogwarts has more than a thousand students! It's not like it might identify him in any way," he persisted.</p><p>"I might've slipped on something already. Five hundred plus are males, lower years we can strike out, so it's -" </p><p>"Well, okay, I do know that he was from our year or one above and most likely from Hufflepuff," said Hermione.</p><p>"I've never said that!" exclaimed Harry.</p><p>"Bread-crumbs you just mentioned... You've said that you waited him by HIS tower until he learned Disillusionment. So he's not a Gryffindor or a Slytherin. And no 5th year would learn this spell - it's impossible without knowing Bofot's second stipulation that Flitwick teaches to 6th years." Harry scowled. "As you were crying he got next to you and asked what happened? I'm not saying that there are no Ravenclaws who'd do that, but I'd put my money on a Hufflepuff. And your surprised face confirmed it after I've said it. Harry, relax. I haven't been able to get more than that."</p><p>Harry sighed and said to Ron. "See? I haven't even said that. If I keep talking, she'll deduce his mother's last name or something."</p><p>"Is he hot?" asked Hermione.</p><p>"I wouldn't characterize him as hot, but he's sexy in his own way."</p><p>"Miss him?"</p><p>"Sure I do. He's my third best friend, what do you think?"</p>
