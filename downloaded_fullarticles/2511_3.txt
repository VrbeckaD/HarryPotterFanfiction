And in this village, there lived a young man, kind and fair, named Newton.</em>
</p><p class="times" align="justify">
  <em>But this isn’t about him. At least, not in the beginning.</em>
</p>
<hr class="hr"/><p class="times" align="justify">Their village was a small place, as far away from mundane settlements as it could be, and protected with as many charms and spells as possible, some so ancient and powerful that only a select few knew of them, and even less could properly ensure they were kept up. These protective measures ensured concealment from those who weren’t born of magic, those who would mercilessly hunt their kind down, burn or hang them whilst still alive. It wasn’t foolproof — no magic ever was, and whatever witch or wizard told you that was selling something else — and they were still vulnerable to other magical beings who came upon their home. But wizards are still men, and man, naïve and foolhardy as it is, cannot imagine anything more powerful than itself.</p><p class="times" align="justify">Percival knew of the stories. Of ages ago, when being and beasts had roamed side by side with those who lacked magic, in, if not harmony, at the very least a peaceful cohabitation. How the mundane had become furious, or perhaps it was wizards who became too cocky and sure, the stories were so old, but what remained true was that they began to hunt one another, too kill and curse for sport, then for spite, then out of fear. Perhaps it had been fueled by fear or jealousy or greed. The truth was so distorted by the passage of time and the fickle and biased memories, that no one could tell what it once had been.</p><p class="times" align="justify">(Sometimes, when he laid in bed, Percival felt the magic thrum beneath his palms, course fire-hot through his veins, and could understand why they were so hated, persecuted. How sad it must have been, to be born as cold and empty and blind as the mundane were, to know what laid so close and yet be unable to even touch it when others were wrapped in its warm embrace.)</p><p class="times" align="justify">That was why their village was hidden, why the outskirts of the forest were protected by a dilapidated wall strengthened with the hum and spark of magic, why they could not leave. The oldest of them, they had seen what laid beyond the walls, the punishments in store for those of magical blood, who disobeyed and strayed. for It was for their protection, mothers parroted to their wide-eyed children, elders droned to their straight-laced pupils. Away from that protection there was strife and suffering, at the hands of those without magic, cold and childlike in their cruelty. As long as they remained this way, hidden, they would be safe.</p><p class="times" align="justify">And so they remained, trapped in their own little world, believing that nothing could ever, <em>would ever</em>, hurt them.</p>
<hr class="hr"/><p class="times" align="justify">
  <em>Of course, that was not true. Otherwise we wouldn’t have a story, would we?</em>
</p>
<hr class="hr"/><p class="times" align="justify">It was Percival’s duty to protect the village. Not his alone to bear, for there were others, too. Trained from youth to uphold the peace and protection. It was they who ensured the wards were up, they who delivered messages to other villages of their ilk, hidden in the land. For Percival, it was a tiresome job, especially so in recent time. His people had becomes restless, tired of their hiding away like beasts, as they said. Some demanded they rally together to take down the mundane, perceiving them as the root of their misfortune.</p><p class="times" align="justify">Dark wizards, those who remorselessly wielded magic to hurt and harm others, had begun to raid the villages for willing soldiers, or for victims. <em>Unite with us, brothers and sisters,</em> they would say, <em>raise arms against those who have forced us to scavenge and hide like vermin.</em> <em>Ours should be the world — not of the beasts, not of the mundane, but ours rightfully.</em></p><p class="times" align="justify">They would raid villages and towns indiscriminately, taking whatever and whomsoever they pleased. To join them meant loyalty and safety and protection, to deny them meant a swift and certain death. Their power grew with each passing day, and the tales of their dark exploits worsened. Sometimes they were so close that Percival could see the smoke of the pyres in the horizon. Things had taken a turn for the worse, and unease became a part of their daily lives. And it would remain so, for a very long time.</p>
<hr class="hr"/><p class="times" align="justify">In another village, one far away, but quite like their own, there lived a friend of Percival’s. His name was Theseus, and Percival knew of no man as just, brave and courageous as he. Through the letters they shared, they spoke of the darkness that was slowly overtaking, of the struggles to maintain peace. They recounted with sorrow of lives taken, both magic and mundane alike. Plans were also exchanged in these letters, of the how to take down the strongholds of wizards who posed threats.</p><p class="times" align="justify">With the rising threat, it soon became difficult for their letters to continue. Owls were slaughtered, messages were stolen and battles were being lost. Human messengers were untrustworthy, for one could not known on which side they belonged. Seraphina, the leader of Percival’s village, was at her wits end.</p><p class="times" align="justify">“We cannot remain this way,” she had said as another wizard died at the hands of brothers gone rogue. “Something must be done, Percival.”</p><p class="times" align="justify">As luck would have it, one day a letter of Theseus’ arrived. It was innocuous, they could no longer afford to discuss their strategies so obviously through letters. With a wave of his wand, the letters rearranged, until the true message was revealed. Theseus spoke of their struggles with dark wizards, of the werewolves and centaurs that had joined their fight, how many had sided with a man of pure darkness known only as the Dark Lord, under promises that free of the mundane, they would all live united, as they were meant to be.</p><p class="times" align="justify"><em>But that man only speaks lies,</em> Theseus wrote. <em>Beneath his rule there would be no unity. He will not stop until he is sure that only those pure, and only those who follow <u>him</u>, remain. I’m afraid of what will happen if we cannot stop him in time. He amasses more followers each passing day. Something must be done and hiding from him will not help us before he burns us all to the ground.</em></p><p class="times" align="justify">
  <em>I hope this letter reaches you Percival. They know our homes, our messengers, and intercept our letters. </em>
  <em>From now on, my brother shall be the one to deliver mine. There is no one, no thing, I trust in the world more than him, and I know he will not fail us.</em>
</p><p class="times" align="justify">Percival trusted in Theseus’ judgement, and as Seraphina trusted in Percival’s, it was agreed that the younger brother would serve as the secret messenger.</p><p class="times" align="justify"><em>How will we know who he is?</em> Percival wrote in return.</p><p class="times" align="justify">The snowy owl that was delivering their messages arrived with Theseus’ response rather quickly, and in the letter it brought back was but one sentence.</p><p class="times" align="justify">
  <em>Trust me, you’ll know when you see him.</em>
</p>
<hr class="hr"/><p class="times" align="justify">Seasons passed, flowers and fruits bloomed and ripened with the harvest season, and soon autumn would give way to the winter. There no sign of this Dark Lord for some time now, but there was also no message of Theseus which had arrived yet, and Percival was uneasy. Millions of possibilities passed through his mind. Had the message once again been intercepted? Had Theseus’ brother been captured? Had his friend succumbed to the Dark Lord?</p><p class="times" align="justify">“It’ll come soon, I’m sure of it,” Porpentina, another of the protectors and a kind young woman, said, sensing his worry.</p><p class="times" align="justify">The two of them sat outside together, watching as dark, heavy rain clouds passed through the dull gray sky. Between them, they shared a crisp apple, slicing it and taking nibbles of it. The sweet fruity scent took Percival back to the bright spring days. A few feet away from them, children played aimlessly, unaware and innocent in the way children are of the danger outside. With the winter season already upon them, the skies darkened quicker. The pair stood outside as people lit lanterns and candles, everything soon being bathed in the blue glow of magic.</p><p class="times" align="justify">Percival sighed, his breath fogging in the cold air. “I hope you’re right ‘Tina.”</p><p class="times" align="justify">Suddenly, the wind howled in their ears, the sound echoing throughout the trees and houses, and blew their hair in all directions. The howling became louder, until almost resembled the screeching of an animal.</p><p class="times" align="justify">“What’s that sound,” Porpentina said.</p><p class="times" align="justify">Villagers came out of their homes to look up at the sky, from where the loud sound came from. Percival and Porpentina stood and drew out their wands. From above, a figure could be seen between the clouds, large and winged.</p><p class="times" align="justify">“… <em>It’s a hippogriff!</em>”</p><p class="times" align="justify">Porpentina made quick work, pushing the children out of the hippogriff’s way, and making sure the others wouldn’t come close. It was not necessary, as it lowered to the ground with a grace that did not compare to its erratic flying, and remained in that very spot. Percival stood between them and the creature. Now that it had reached the ground, they could see it had been saddled, and not just that, but that it had a rider.</p><p class="times" align="justify">The figure, covered from head to toe in a hooded cloak of the richest red Percival had ever seen, so much that it strained his vision to look at it, slid down from the hippogriff and patted its neck with the tenderness one would offer to an old, docile horse. The hippogriff leaned into the touch, purring with contentment. At the sight of the creature acting like any other house pet, children began to creep closer, only to run back to their parent’s arms when it screeched and reached out to bite.</p><p class="times" align="justify">Porpentina was already speaking. “That creature —”</p><p class="times" align="justify">“It’s alright! Hush now, Alectrona. They’re not going to harm you.” The voice, a man’s, was deep, a kind hush against the feather’s of the hippogriff that measured whether they were food or friend. “I’m terribly sorry. She’s not good with strangers.”</p><p class="times" align="justify">Percival took a step forward, shielding the rest with one arm. His fingers tightened their grip on his wand. Who was this man, who so flagrantly came to their village — in a hippogriff no less! His body was poised, ready for a confrontation if it came to that. Percival couldn’t read the strange visitor, what with his face hidden beneath that massive hood, but he could feel the way his eyes travelled down to his hand, fixing on the defensive way he held his wand.</p><p class="times" align="justify">“Oh! How could I forget?” Two freckled hands reached up, pulling the hood back. Copper curls were soon exposed, and when the man shook the snow off his head, gold could be seen between the locks.</p><p class="times" align="justify">Percival took in the sight of the man. He was tall, taller than Percival, and his body was lean but strong. More freckles kissed his face, around plump lips and beneath his eyes — and oh, such eyes. Of a beautiful color, not quite green yet not quite blue, rimmed with gold. They were soft and rounded, and he could not imagine the man ever casting a glare or dark look. Percival watched as a hand, covered in thick, white scars that resembled bites and claw marks, reached for a letter in his pocket.</p><p class="times" align="justify">The sudden resemblance was there, in the long neck, the slope of his nose and shape of his brow.</p><p class="times" align="justify">“You’re—“</p><p class="times" align="justify">“Theseus’ brother.” He offered up the letter, filled with a familiar scrawl. “My name’s Newt, and it’s a pleasure to finally meet you, Percival.”</p>
