  <strong>Hogwarts Castle, the Scottish Highlands</strong>


</p>
<p>"And that ends the discussion on Cursed Artefacts. I expect your essays at my desk on Thursday, along with a detailed study on The Axe of Ragerous and why it is considered one of the deadliest artefacts to exist. Class dismissed."</p><p>Riddle set down the chalk and closed the text book. He watched the class scramble out, and glanced upon two lanky boys.</p><p>"Mr Potter and Mr Black. I suggest the two of you pick up all the dungbombs you have left inside my classroom, if you don't want to spend detention scrubbing the trophy rooms this evening."</p><p>He left the two troublemakers to clear the classroom and headed to his office. Teaching sixth year Gryffindors was a headache, to be honest. Chiefly because of four pesky-, ah, what was it that they called themselves?</p><p>'Marauders', he remembered.</p><p>Fitting.</p><p>"Good afternoon, Tom." Riddle turned in annoyance to see Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Riddle had never liked the man, ever since the ginger (now white) bearded man attempted to persuade the former headmaster, Armando Dippet, to reject his application for the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.</p><p>"I hope you are not too tired for an afternoon tea with me." Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. Riddle plastered a false smile on his face.</p><p>"Of course not, Headmaster."</p><p>He followed the wizened man up the gargoyle staircase, into the Headmaster's study.</p><p>"I have had several people ask me, why a brilliant and talented mind like yours is limiting itself to teaching at a school, when you could have such great prospects at the Ministry of Magic." Dumbledore smiled benignly.</p><p>"I'm sure you've had the same question directed at you many more times, Dumbledore." Riddle smiled stiffly, he knew where this was headed. The headmaster had called him to <em>this</em> office at <em>thi</em>s particular time of the year far too often, for him to not understand what the wizard needed. The headmaster suspected him of something dark, and was desperate to get him sacked, as he had always been, since Tom Marvolo Riddle first set foot in the school.</p><p>"Ah, Tom. I am but an old man, who has made his share of mistakes, seen his share of the world. I will be at ease imparting what little knowledge and wisdom I have gained through my experiences, to young minds. But you-"</p><p>"I'm not that young either, Professor." Riddle cut him off.</p><p>"But to an old man like me, you will still be that little boy I met in Wool's Orphanage, London."</p><p>Riddle winced at the memory of that infernal place. "Hogwarts is my home, Professor Dumbledore. I believe you have never received any complaints about my classes, yes?"</p><p>"No, but I do doubt the means you have used to keep it that way." Dumbledore said with a sinister undertone.</p><p>"You flatter me, Headmaster. I'm not <em>that</em> accomplished." Riddle laughed dryly and set the teacup down. "If you are done, Professor, then I will be taking my leave."</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>"Impudence, that's what it is! Which essay is this, Mr Pettigrew?"</p><p>"Uh... Um... The properties of the Axe of Ragerous?"</p><p>"If so, why is it titled 'The Properties of Asphodel in Brewing'?"</p><p>Pettigrew froze. Black patted his back sympathetically. Professor Tom M. Riddle was not prone to anger often, but when he was, it was not happy news.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Professor, I must've handed in the wrong essay." The plump boy began apologising frantically, and Riddle let him off with a three foot essay on the Axe of Ragerous. He returned to grading the remaining essays, but Sirius Black coughed slightly, reminding him of the other reason he had called the Marauder.</p><p>"Mr Black, what's going on with Potter?" He was direct, and the boy seemed a bit taken aback. "His poorly written work reflects the chaos within his spirit, so would you care to clarify? I don't think Potter would welcome me snooping into his matters, but if his grades drop, <em>I will be very much concerned."</em> Riddle gestured for the boy to sit.</p><p>Black seemed quite flustered, and he scratched his head, looked around and fidgeted.</p><p>"Well?"</p><p>"Uh, Professor... He's, um, he's in love."</p><p>"Send him to the infirmary, then." Riddle replied, continuing to grade papers.</p><p>"He didn't swallow a love potion, Professor Riddle, he's <em>in</em> love." Sirius Black grimaced. Riddle frowned. He had a fair idea of whom James Potter was pining over; all he needed was some confirmation.</p><p>Sweet, brilliant, Muggle-born Lily Evans.</p><p>Riddle sighed.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>
  <strong>Malfoy Manor, Somewhere in Wiltshire</strong>
</p><p>Riddle nonchalantly listened to Dolohov report on the new initiation. His army of Death Eaters were increasing. From a group of twenty youths, it had increased to a faction of almost a hundred. It appeared that Lucius Malfoy, Rudolphous Lestrange and Augustus Rookwood had joined. He remembered that it was only a few years ago that the Slytherin trio sat for their NEWTS at Hogwarts.</p><p>Ever since Armando Dippet let him have the post of the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, Riddle had to keep a low profile. He never appeared in front of his Death Eaters, never did any of the work himself. He had to admit, he had changed. Never had he thought Tom Marvolo Riddle would sit inside a comfy office and think up grandiloquent plans to take over the world. He had always imagined himself at the helm, proudly slaughtering the Muggle-lovers and Blood-Traitors.</p><p>But he liked it this way. He had the most faithful Abraxas Malfoy and Antonin Dolohov to do his bidding, the only two who knew the face behind the mask of Lord Voldemort. He could happily sit back and watch the abysmal performance of most Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs at advanced hexes, while Malfoy pulled strings at the Ministry, and Dolohov trained his new minions.</p><p>Tom returned to Hogwarts to specially-tutor his favourite students: Regulus Black, Remus Lupin, Severus Snape, and Lily Evans. The latter three made him constantly think why he was so adamant on pure-blood supremacy.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>Severus Snape and Regulus Black had been initiated into the Death Eaters' faction, the latter, due to sheer pressure from his family. Riddle knew the boy had only wanted to be a professional adventurer. And the former had <em>other </em>reasons for being miserable enough to sign his death contract. Riddle felt sorry for the impoverished, but brilliant boy. He had fallen into depression, and Lucius Malfoy had cajoled him into joining the Death Eaters.</p><p>James Potter was marrying Lily Evans, and the ecstatic girl had invited him to the wedding.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>"Class dismissed!"</p><p>Riddle left in Hogwarts in a hurry, flooing to Abraxas' private study in the Malfoy Manor. His wizened follower bowed his head in shame.</p><p>"Tom, we've lost grievously."</p><p>"What do you mean?" Riddle asked sharply. There was something wrong with the way Dolohov and Malfoy were standing, as if they were terrified.</p><p>"We had an informant, who overheard a prophecy being made. A prophecy regarding the end of your reign. So we sent a few of the Death Eaters to intercept."</p><p>"Well? What was it all about?"</p><p>“‘A child born on the 31<sup>st</sup> of July, born to parents who have thrice defied the Dark Lord, will have powers to vanquish the Dark Lord.’ We decided that such a prediction was dangerous enough to take immediate action, and we sent out Death Eaters to kill the children. What we couldn’t predict was the excellent defences set up by the Order’s wizards.”</p><p>“What are our losses?” Riddle sat on the armchair, pondering deeply.</p><p>“All the twenty five Death Eaters sent to the Potters’ hideout were… vaporised, it seems. Nagini is... missing.” Malfoy gulped. Riddle stiffened, but let the man continue. “And although Rodolphous and his team managed to capture the Longbottoms, the child escaped. The place was swamped by Order members once we caught the couple.”</p><p>Riddle had known that inevitably, the two sides would come into conflict. It could not be helped that the Longbottoms, Lily and the Marauders had refused to come over to the Dark side. They were too much influenced by Dumbledore. Apparently, James and Lily Potter had died, but their child had escaped as well.</p><p>Pity.</p><p>But very odd. Riddle realised that he needed to do more research on blood wards. The Death Eaters had used the Killing Curse, and it had to have bounced back after amplifying, otherwise there would not have been such a reaction. Much like a modified version of a Shield Charm. “Abraxas, with whom, did you say, were the Longbottoms?”</p><p>“The Lestranges, My Lord.”</p><p>“Make sure the Order finds them before that insane Black girl does.” Riddle fastened his cloak and apparated back to Hogsmeade. There was bound to be chaos in the Order of the Phoenix, and most of the teachers would be away. Someone <em>had</em> to stay at Hogwarts and make sure none of the teenagers snuck firewhiskey out from the kitchens.</p><p align="center">* * *</p>
