      <strong>Bucky's POV/Third Person POV</strong>
    </p>
    <p align="left">It was 3 in the morning when Steve heard pecking on the bedroom window. He looked at the window and it was an owl, so he got up and let it in. The light brown owl landed on the window sill and held its leg out, but when Steve tried to take the letter the owl pecked him, so for once instead of fighting he just decided to Bucky up instead to deal with it. He wasn't feeling well, and he was tired, and since it was 3 in the morning, he just go Bucky up.</p>
    <p align="left">"What is it Steve?" Bucky asked.</p>
    <p align="left">"There is an owl at the window for some damn reason holding out a letter, but it won't let me take it, so you get it and get the damn owl out of here"</p>
    <p align="left">"Fine lay back down, Steve and I will take care of it" Bucky told him in a tired voice.</p>
    <p align="left">Bucky got up and went to the window and the owl let him take the letter. Once he had the letter the owl flew off and he closed the window and went to lay back down in bed next to Steve, laying the letter on the night stand and going back to sleep.</p>

      <strong>Bucky's POV 6:00 am</strong>
    </p>
    <p align="left">When the clock reached 6 o' clock Steve and I heard banging on the door and the words "Kids its time to get up for school and then walking off. I went and got in the shower and got ready before going to get Steve up since he just hummed and went back to sleep.</p>
    <p align="left">"Steve come on its time to get up and get ready" I told him pulling the blankets off of him.</p>
    <p align="left">Once he was up and at least stumbling to the bathroom, I grabbed the letter and went to help mom in the kitchen.</p>
    <p align="left">"So, you got one of your letters then?" Dad asked.</p>
    <p align="left">"Yes, sir. I got it at 3 this morning" I answered.</p>
    <p align="left">"Have you opened it yet?" Mom asked.</p>
    <p align="left">"No, ma'am."</p>
    <p align="left">"Then you can open it at Breakfast." George commented.</p>
    <p align="left">"Even with Steve here?" I asked worried.</p>
    <p align="left">"Yes. He has been showing some signs that he is magical as well. I may not have gone to Hogwarts since I am a Squib, but all Barnes have been going for Generations." Dad answered and then commented "I am a little worried about how Steve is doing. He is getting worse as he ages, and he shouldn't be this sick all the time even if he was premature when he was born."</p>
    <p align="left">"George if you are worried about Steve then talk to him and Sarah and take him to St. Mangos. Steve is just like a son to us, so we will pay for the visit." Mom replied as I set the table as mom finished up cooking.</p>
    <p align="left">By 7 everyone was down for breakfast and at the table. I opened my letter and read:</p>
    <p align="left">
      <em> <strong>Mr. J. Barnes</strong> </em>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
      <em> <strong>The Last Bedroom on the Right</strong> </em>
    </p>
    <p align="left"><em> <strong>1838 W. 4</strong> </em> <em> <strong>th</strong> </em> <em> <strong> St.</strong> </em></p>
    <p align="left">
      <em> <strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong> </em>
    </p>
    <p align="left">"Dear Mr. Barnes, We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July." I read after opening the letter.</p>
    <p align="left">"Is that for real?" Steve asked.</p>
    <p align="left">"Yes, it is, Steve. It is very real. Winifred and I may not have magic, but you all do. I can tell because of the things that have been happening around this house since you Barnes were born. And you Steve just added to it when you started coming over regularly" Dad answered.</p>
    <p align="left">"Now get eating because you all have to go to school in a few minutes. And Happy Birthday, James" Mom told us.</p>
    <p align="left">Once we were done eating, we grabbed our backpacks and went to school.</p>
    <p align="left">George's POV</p>
    <p align="left">"Saturday we can take them to Diagon Alley in England and we can stay at my fathers for the weekend. And then come home so the kids can go to school. How does that sound."</p>
    <p align="left">"Sounds great. But you do know both James and Steve are not going to be happy about being separated for two yours." Winifred commented.</p>
    <p align="left">"That is true. But they will live especially Steve. We will take care of him. He has became one of us."</p>
    <p align="left">"Yes, well what we really have to worry about is when the kids hit 13 and they present."</p>
    <p align="left">"That is a long way away from now, baby. And I better go find Sarah. You know if she is not at the apartment., then she will be at the Hospital and the apartment is 2 blocks away from the house and the hospital is 4 blocks away, So I better get going."</p>
    <p align="left">"OK, George." She replied as I got up and started walking to the apartment. 30 minutes later I arrived at the apartment and knocked on the door.</p>
    <p align="left">"Hold on" I heard through the door.</p>
    <p align="left">The door opened, and Sarah said, "George is everything OK?"</p>
    <p align="left">"Of course, Sarah. I just came to speak to you about some family business"</p>
    <p align="left">"Of course, come in." Sarah said stepping aside to let me in.</p>
    <p align="left">Once we were seated. I started by saying "Have you ever heard of magic?"</p>
    <p align="left">"No way. Isn't it just something people make up?"</p>
    <p align="left">"No, it's not. You ever notice how weird things happen around Steve or one of my children?"</p>
    <p align="left">"Yes, I honestly thought I was going crazy when he was a baby. But honestly something would start to float towards Steve and then drop."</p>
    <p align="left">"Is that why you are listening to me even?" I asked her.</p>
    <p align="left">"Yes, and I know you are a rational man and wouldn't do this as a joke on me."</p>
    <p align="left">"No, I would not. Now the way your son's magic is acting is like it is trying to break free from being bound. But with his stunted growth and most of his health issues. You see when someone's magic is bond and they don't know it. The block can be passed down to the child if not careful. It has killed several people in the past and since I cannot sense any magic from you, I guess that it was your husband that was magical."</p>
    <p align="left">"Sense? Do you have magic also?"</p>
    <p align="left">"No, I don't but I have always had one of the rare Barnes family abilities which is to sense magic."</p>
    <p align="left">"Oh. So why are you telling me this now?"</p>
    <p align="left">"Because your son found out about magic today and I have been thinking of all the systems he has been showing over the years. And they are not good. If the kids don't die in the womb or around birth, then they end up dying before the even reach their 11th birthday. Your son has been putting up a fight. Not many kids are fighters like Steve. I thought of taking you and Steve with us on Saturday, so we can get him checked out at the magical hospital in England."</p>
    <p align="left">"OK, do it. With or with out me because I do not know if I can get Saturday off or not. And I will let you know if I can or not. And just in case I will give you power of eternity to do it. I will also pass along his medical records on Saturday." Sarah told me.</p>
    <p align="left">"OK, then I see you Saturday." I replied. Getting up and going back home.</p>
