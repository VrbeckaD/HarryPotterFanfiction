    <p>Ravenclaws. People call them stuck up, smart asses who never get their heads out of their books. Well that's what the Gryffindors and Slytherins have surmised, but they haven't seen the outburst of outrage, or the fits they through, or the way they sometimes walk around looking like zombies because, no, thank you they haven't slept, they were busy reading an advanced book on runes and arthimancy and how when joined they can create magnificent shows of light that could possibly bring about a new spell from thin air, or even time travel. And yes, they really should have used the time to study for that subject they hate and are failing at.</p><p>Because the truth is only those who never actually pay attention would think that Ravenclaws are stuck up and have a permanent stick up their ass. Ravenclaws also have rules, they have library rotations and they aren't allowed to take house books outside of the dormitory. And Professor Filtwik has rules set in place so you are only able to miss three meals a week and you must have at least five hours outside of the castle every week.</p><p>Because maybe Ravenclaws never get their heads out of books and they tend to forgot simple things, like food, and hygiene. But no one ever really notices.</p><p>One student, a Mr. Lopez Prince, followed these stereo types well. He was currently a sixth year and had attended Hogwarts for 2 years, a Ravenclaw by heart and by mind. His trunk was larger than normal and close to exploding with the amount of expansion spells cast on it, and when people would question him on as he hauled it up the school gates very year, or simply across the room, he would merely ask, where do you keep all your books?</p><p>His roommates often got irritated by his bouncy attitude and how he stayed up till all hours of the morning reading. He was also always open for debates, so much so that it often annoyed the Ravenclaws, who loved debating as it was. Professor Filtwik often found him curled up under a tree somewhere or tucked away behind some chairs or tapestry, and with a kind smile he would remind the boy of breakfast, or dinner, or lunch. His dorm mates often had to wake him up in the morning or remind him to brush his teeth.</p><p>Everyone in the house considered him their little brother and that was cool. He was okay with that, not that he really noticed much. He was too hidden behind his book, or writing something up, or even drawing runes with a look of extreme concentration on his face. Bubbly and bouncy, he never really noticed the amused and endearing looks thrown his way.</p><p>It was the second week back and Lopez, a book by his side that he had been dying to read, had been summoned by his father. He wasn't really sure what the man wanted, but he suspected his brother would be there, glaring at a cauldron and complaining about his fiancé or about his mother or Quidditch, which held little interest for the nerdy Ravenclaw. I idea of flying around in the air to catch a ball and nock other players from there brooms seemed rather barbaric to him, it was so much easier to spend the time reading anyway. However, he had yet to miss a game of his brothers, no matter what he thought on the subject.</p><p>He skipped happily down through the dungeons until he reached his father's office, a large smile still on his face. He walked through the door, careful not to harm his book, and closed the it behind him only to find his blonde brother, Draco Malfoy, leaning against a bench and glaring at a cauldron, just as he had suspected.</p><p>"Hey Draco!" He chirped, his voice void of the English accent very other member of his family had, replaced by the light yet firm Australian one he had gained through years of hiding.</p><p>Draco's scowl turned to a small smile as he spotted his adorable younger half-brother. "Lopez," he breathed. Slowly he stood and moved towards the Ravenclaw, wrapping an arm around him in a hello hug. "How have you been brother?"</p><p>"I've been great! I've got a new book!" Lopez bounced up onto his toes, smiling up at him, and ignoring the annoyance that cropped up at the fact that he was inferior in height.</p><p>Draco chuckled, "of course you have, what's it about this time?" He asked as he turned away, walking to his previous leaning spot, the smile still lining his lips.</p><p>The Ravenclaw followed happily, quickly going on to explain how his new book was on the theory of creation of spells and how magic flowed and worked in the universe, falling into the chair opposite the teachers. He stared wide eyed at the Slytherin as he spoke, excitement filling his voice at the prospect of learnings something new.</p><p>For Draco's part, he really only hummed occasionally, letting the younger one ramble on until Severus arrived. "Oh, what does dad want anyway?"</p><p>Ahh, he seemed he had remembered they were here for a reason. "I'm not really sure. But Severus said father is going be here as well," and a contemplative look came over Lopez's face.</p><p>"Okay," he chirped in response before pulling his book out and waiting. Although it wasn't a very long wait he did seem to become entranced in the book, his eyes glazing over as he flicked through page after page. When the potions professor arrived, the Malfoy lord by his side, they both smiled endearingly at their child before moving so Severus was sitting in his seat and Lucius was leaning in a similar manor to his son, except closer to his love.</p><p>They watched for a few seconds as their presence went undetected, before Lucius, smile still in place spoke. "Lopez," black eyes flickered up from the book and a great smile encompassed his regal features as he leapt from his seat to tackle his father in a hug.</p><p>"Father," he cried before his eyes found Severus and he too tackled the man, "dad."</p><p>"It's good to see you too Lopez," the potions master said, despite seeing him every day for classes. It wasn't common knowledge that they were father and son so they couldn't great each other as they did during class.</p><p>It took a few seconds but the sixth year finally found himself seated again, Draco chuckling in the background as he chimed in, "good evening father, Severus," with a bowl of his regal head.</p><p>They nodded back both smiling pleasantly before getting back to business. "Now, we called you here today to tell you something that couldn't quite be revealed through the mail," Severus began. "Lucius," and here he paused, his lover stepping forward to grab his hand, "and Narcissa have decided to get a divorce. Which means we can finally get married."</p><p>Draco smiled even brighter while Lopez leapt for joy. His fathers were finally getting married, he smiled so much his cheeks hurt but he couldn't help it. He was so happy. And now that he looked closer he could indeed see a ring on his dad's finger.</p><p>The newly engaged couple smiled at each other before they directed their attention back onto the two brothers. "There's something more," the Malfoy lord said, his voice filled with a gentle excitement. He cupped at hand to his very flat stomach and grinned. "I'm with child," it was said softly, gently and the two sons felt tears gather at their eyes.</p><p>"I'm so happy for you father, Severus," Draco spoke, walking around the table to bring his father into a hug.</p><p>It seemed Lopez was stunned, his mouth hanging open and eyebrows drawn. Before finally that winning smile broke across his face. "Yay!" He yelled clapping his hands. "We're going to have another sibling and this time it won't be in secret!"</p><p>He didn't mind the fact he had to be rushed away, he had understood the situation. With Voldemort and the war and everyone wanting to hurt the Malfoy family for being death eaters, it was expected. He had gotten the love he wanted, al be it, he had grown up in a different place, with different people and a different school. He had understood from very young why he couldn't take either of his father's names, and he had smiled upon learning of his heir ship.</p><p>The young Prince was just glad his sibling, sister or brother, he didn't know yet, would be able to be raised by the two of them, Draco and himself getting to see the whole thing.</p><p>Oh, and of course he had to research baby safe spells immediately. Or maybe just a rune on clothing to alert them of any danger the young magical may come upon. His mind kicked into overdrive as he pondered in the possibility of feeding the child a potion to monitor the internal organs, and it was only the gentle laying of a hand on his shoulder that broke his concentration.</p><p>He looked up into the black eyes of his dad, mirror images of his own. "I think it's time you went to bed," the black eyes flickered up to Draco's relaxed form, "both of you. I know for a fact you don't have class tomorrow, but you," here he once more looked to his son, "don't look like you have had much sleep."</p><p>"Well… I may have stayed up reading astronomy and magical particles in space. It was so interesting I mean, we can just create anything here, or transform one thing from another, which is so astounding. There are no laws or regulations that magic follows, and therefore it's unknown whether it would work in space or not. Because the level of particle strength and the thinner stretch energy, which leads me to wonder if magic would work in or around a black whole. But then I-?" A finger was placed over his lips and he stared up at his dad, a confused sound leaving his lips.</p><p>Of course he hadn't realised he had begun speaking faster and fast and that, although it did sound interesting, the only one that shared his passion for knowledge, unchanged able magic laws of the Universe, and the universe in general was, well, probably a Ravenclaw, somewhere. But none of his family really did.</p><p>Of course they never really stopped him, they found it ever amusing and adorable when he rambled as he had just done, his eyes wide and alight with wonder. Slowly Draco directed his younger and adorable brother out of the room, a hand on his shoulder. The two saying goodbye to their fathers as the heavy dungeon door closed behind them.</p><p>They began talking about something, maybe, but then maybe it was nothing, or just ranting, they never really knew, but by the time they had reached the point where they went in different directions they were on the topic of Luna, a friend of Lopez's although they rarely talked outside of the common. And even if there talks usually consisted more of heated debates on magical creatures, not their existence so much as their magic soul and where they got it from.</p><p>The particular debate they were discussing was if magical creatures could produce squibs, and if so what would they appear as, would a dragon not be able to breath fire or would it effect more than that. However, they had to separate and with a short hug they disappeared in different directions, both seeking their warm beds on the cold autumn night.</p><p>It seemed it wasn't meant to be, for as Lopez headed up to the fifth floor, his head down in his book as he pondered on the existence of magic and where it stemmed from, he was hit by a large, human sized, invisible being. He grunted, his book falling from his hands and his but landing on the ground. His stomach hurt slightly from where a sharp point had hit him, an elbow maybe. But he didn't really care, all he knew was that his book was gone, the book he had painstakingly spent all summer looking for and had worked for two months because, well, he didn't want his fathers to pay for it. Paying for it himself meant it was really his, meant he owned it, and although it had taken forever, finally holding it in his hands had been worth it.</p><p>But, it was gone, he couldn't see it anywhere. It had slipped from his hands when he had fallen and now it was just gone. He felt like crying, the tears bursting to his eyes but he held on, he would just have to find it, or make the person he had bumped into pay for it. Just as he had this through the invisible force that knocked him to the ground uncovered itself, taking the form of a teen with bright green eyes and messy black hair that was like a bird's nest on his head.</p><p>The boy, who Lopez thought seemed slightly familiar, opened his mouth to apologise, his hands reaching forwards as he said sorry. "Sorry, sorry," he leaned forward again, "Are you okay?"</p><p>The Ravenclaw moved out of his reach, still looking around frantically for the book. He stood, his hands soothing down his rumbled robes automatically as he moved around in a circle, looking every way for the precious item. The other taller teen watching in confused silence. Finally, the pair of dark black eyes landed on bird nest boy again. "What are you doing?" The boy spoke and Lopez growled, why was he out this late at night. If he hadn't been out then he would still be ready, still have his book.</p><p>"I'm looking for my book." And the teen gained a rather bemused look on his face, however it just angered Lopez, and then that anger, a feeling of utter lost and regret, morphed into sadness, because it was gone, it was gone and he couldn't find it.</p><p>Slowly his wide eyes drooped, his eye brows lowering and his lips sliding to the ground at the same times as the tears broke through. His hands met his eyes as water poured silently down his face, trying desperately to wipe away the tears as he gave into the desperation.</p><p>The other boy began freaking, reaching forward his eyes wide. "Um… are you okay? What's wrong?"</p><p>"My-My book," he mumbled in response, "it's gone."</p><p>"Your book," and it seemed he had finally realised what was happening. Quickly he looked around, anyway to stop the tears. Looking around slightly he saw a small skin covered book about two metres away, hidden by the shadows. He dove towards it, bringing it to the teens attention by literally shoving it under his face, a small awkward smile on his face as he tried to figure out what to do.</p><p>Lopez plucked the book from the hands, slightly larger than his own and slightly darker, and hugged it to his chest, relief washing over him. He looked up into the emerald green eyes and threw himself at the other teen, wrapping him in a thank you hug. So maybe it was the others fault for making him drop his book, but that didn't mean he didn't deserve a thankyou hug. Under his hands, the Ravenclaw felt the boy tense up.</p><p>Tears still on his face he backed off, smiling and pushing a strand of curly blonde hair out of his running eyes. "Thank you, thank you so much." He bubbled smiling brightly. Then he blinked, tilting his head to the side, huh, he finally realised he didn't know this guy's name. "Who are you?"</p><p>The other teen blinked too, confused by something by Lopez had no idea what. "You… You don't know who I am?"</p><p>Again Lopez blinked, "No… Should I?" Should he? Sure he seemed slightly familiar, but… no, Lopez had no idea.</p><p>A large smile lit the boy's face, "No, its… merlin, my name is Harry," And he seemed so relieved. A hand was held out, smile still in place. "Seventh year Gryffindor," he chuckled, "It's nice to meet you. Hell it's great to meet you!"</p><p>Lopez grabbed the hand back, holding his other hand to his chest, chandelling his book protectively. He returned the smile just as large, "I'm Lopez Prince, sixth year Ravenclaw." He cocked his head to the side, "Nice to meet you too?" He wasn't really sure why it was "great" to meet him but he went along with it. AS he always did.</p><p>"So what are you doing out so late?" Harry asked, a cloak made of some kind of silvery material under his arm.</p><p>"Oh, I was speaking with professor Snape," he replied cheerfully, "I was just heading back to my dorm."</p><p>A confused and yet irritated look crossed his face, "Oh Snape, what did he want?"</p><p>Lopez ignored the look on the Gryfs face in favour of heading back towards the stairs that lead to the fifth floor, slightly surprised to find his new friend following. "Oh, just something to do with my parents." Because he knew that dad preferred not to let people know of their connection, of the ridicule it would cause Lopez.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah," a toothy smile pulled tightly at his high cheekbones, "I'm gonna have another sibling!" He said happily and Harry smiled back at him.</p><p>"That's good," they had just finished walking up from the third to the fourth floor, when they were hit by a strong gust of cold air, Lopez shivering in his light clothes. "Are you cold?" The older wizard asked, concerned.</p><p>"I'm alright, it's just that my clothes are rather light," and he hadn't even finished saying those words that the other was pulling off his thick jacket and offering it to the Ravenclaw. Slowly he took the jacket, unsure. "Are you sure it's alright?"</p><p>"It's cool mate, I'm fine," and slowly he sunk into the warm, oh so warm, jacket, the material smelling of fresh grass and forest and it smelt amazing. The inside was lined with a thin piece of fur, and it was so decidedly fluffy that he couldn't help let out a small mew of happiness, prompting a laugh from the taller boy.</p><p>Ignoring the laugh, he turned his attention to the shiny material that the other boy held under his arm, a translucent cloak of something, perhaps that's what had hidden him. That reminded him actually, "what are you doing out at this time of night?" He asked.</p><p>Harry let out a nervous chuckle, a hand rubbing at the back of his neck. "I was sneaking down to the kitchens to get something to eat."</p><p>Lopez hummed, that made sense. "Did you miss the feast?"</p><p>"Kinda," the Ravenclaw blinked, what? "Well I went down to the feast but one of my friends spilt a potion on my plate and I couldn't eat much."</p><p>Oh, that made much more sense. And then the conversation tapered off into silence as they walked, simply enjoying the others company. It was as they reached the fifth floor, nearing the entrance to the common room that the Gryffindor decided to break their comfortable air.</p><p>"I'm sorry to intrude but where are you from, I can't really tell from you accent?"</p><p>"Oh, I was born in England but I was raised in Australia," Lopez admitted easily, not even really looking at the other.</p><p>"Why?" And he did indeed seem very confused.</p><p>"The war," and upon seeing the uncomprehending look, "sure Voldemort was gone but they knew he would rise again." Lopez didn't really understand why he was so comfortable around the other but didn't really care. Maybe because he wanted someone he could actually talk to about these things. Maybe because the boy was really handsome.</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to say something else, when other voices met their ears, "look, what are we even meant to do if we catch someone out of bed. Send them back, deduct points, I just don't get it?"</p><p>It seemed the two shared a single thought together, hide.</p><p>And that was how they ended up sharing the same breathing room inside a very tiny alcove behind an old tapestry, hiding from the newly appointed seventh year Ravenclaw prefects. Lopez with his head buried in the others chest and Harry with his arms braced on the wall that the younger was leaning against.</p><p>They waited silently, holding their breaths as the people walked past, neither of them could afford to get caught, and it was only after the footsteps faded and the voices went silent that the two realised what kind of position they were in. Lopez slowly loosened the hold he had on the others shirt, but he couldn't help it as he leant forward to smell him. Oh and what a wonderful smell.</p><p>Harry tensed as he felt the younger lean closer. "You smell amazing," He murmured before leaning back and smiling up at the Gryf.</p><p>He watched, confused as the taller lit up like a lamp. Had he said something wrong? He didn't think he had, after all he had just told the truth. But he did often say the wrong thing, and it would lead to accidents, to explosions and there was that one time in second year where he caused a brawl between the seventh years, and then in third when he got a professor fired.</p><p>Slowly he looked down again, sad, because yes, he must have said the wrong thing. "Sorry, I say the wrong thing a lot." He would have moved away, but the wall was already at his back, so instead he backed up just enough to put about 1 cm of air between them.</p><p>But as he was looking down he missed the look of concern that flashed across the others face, two gentle hands lowering to his shoulders. "Hey, you said nothing wrong," and it was said so gently, "it's just… I'm not used to being this close to people. And no one's ever told me I smell nice." He took a deep breath here and Lopez chanced a look up, staring into the kind, kind face that belied just how awkward he was. "I'm flattered really," and he smiled and something inside the Lopez glowed brightly.</p><p>Slowly, they left the alcove, pulling themselves out, Harry awkwardly and Lopez with a beaming smile. They walked in silence the rest of the way and when they finally reached the entrance to the Ravenclaw dwellings Lopez turned to Harry. "I hope we become good friends!" he said happily.</p><p>The other smiled, "It was great to meet you, and I to hope we become good friends."</p><p>And with no more words they pattered, both seeking the sanctuary of their beds until the sunrise tomorrow.</p><p>\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/</p><p>It wasn't till the next morning, when one of the other Ravenclaws, Simon Storth, kindly nudged him from his sleep, that he realised he still had the kind Gryffindors jacket. Where he had been curled up into little ball with the muggle coat not his own acting as his blanket and his book hugged tight to his chest, did he wake to find the very comfortable jacket not familiar.</p><p>Lopez had always had a problem with waking slowly, his feet dragging behind him as he walked to the bathroom to do his business, and as he eyed the piece of clothing through his dark tired eyes, he couldn't really comprehend who it belonged to. He only knew it was warm and fluffy and it was freezing cold.</p><p>"Come on Lo, you need to get down to the great hall for breakfast." He looked away from the fluffy loveliness to eye the man that had pulled him from his sleep. Brown short hair and brown small eyes and tall, oh so tall. Why was everyone so tall.</p><p>"Big mean tall person," he grumbled under his breath, not even registering what he was doing as he pulled the soft warm jacket to his nose and inhaled deeply, loving the smell of freshly cut grass and earth and something else that just made him feel refreshed. It also made him think of a pair of beautiful green eyes that were identical to the eucalyptus leaves that he had loved back in Australia.</p><p>But then Simon chuckled, and Lopez glared before sighing, because, yes, despite it being a Sunday, he realised he had to get up and face the treacherous beast that walked the halls with him, otherwise known as students. At least since it was the weekend he could escape the noise and hide out under his favourite reading tree next to the lake.</p><p>First he had to have breakfast, and a shower, yeah, a shower would probably be good. So slowly he wandered into one of the three showers allocated for his year and gender group and just let cold water wake him.</p><p>He wasn't in there long, and soon, with three books and the warm nice smelly jacket on his back, he made his way to the great hall, stealing a piece of toast and eating it quickly. When he was done he found himself staring out at the court yard and the rain, cold, wet, lovely rain. The pitter patter of falling rain echoed in the castle and even those others hid from the open windows and wouldn't dare to go into it, Lopez found himself rejoicing. How he loved the rain.</p><p>He shivered before casting a waterproof charm on the borrowed jacket, he would need to give it back of course, and a waterproof charm on his books, then with a flick of his wrist he used an old spell to create a half bubble over the top of him that the rain would slide right off of. Similar to an umbrella except he wouldn't have to hold on to it.</p><p>And so he walked through the rain in a swift easy glide, the sound of water splashing calming him as he moved to his favourite tree by the side of the black lake. The tree, a great, gentle thing had many leaves with which to provide shelter and the large trunk hid anybody when sitting facing the lake. It was Lopez's favourite spot, where he conjured a large pile of soft fluffy pillows, and spread the umbrella like charm to cover his sitting space, few knew about and it was the best place to get away from everything. To read during the rain and just rest when you wanted no one to find you.</p><p>It was his favourite spot and as he located it he conjured the pillows, spread the charm, and dived right into the large pile of fluffiness, his books occupying his mind as he sat and stared at the wild that was Hogwarts.</p><p>He didn't know how long he sat there, cocooned by pillows and consuming page after page, but it was late in the day when he was disrupted, a thump coming from the opposite side of the tree and breaking his train of thought. Slowly he crept around the trunk, eyes alight with curiosity, for it was still raining, the water akin to bullets on the skin, and he knew that few animals would venture so close to the black lake with such a treat upon them. However, his eyes widened in surprise when he caught sight of the figure laying almost dead against the tree, drowning in water, for it was a teen with messy black and sickly pale skin.</p><p>His curiosity peaked when he got a good look at the face though, for it wasn't just any old teen that had wondered into his space, but a Gryffindor with high cheek bones and emerald green eyes, a handsome one, the same one he had seen the night before. He blinked, what was Harry, the kind Gryffindor, doing soaked to the bone by his tree.</p><p>Slowly he reached down to poke the boy in the face, blinking once more when the head shot up, a confused and yet weary frown on the other boys face. Slowly, upon seeing the face staring down on him, the frown morphed into a small relieved smile. The smile made Lopezes heart beat just a little bit faster. Such a beautiful smile.</p><p>"Hello," he said, his voice worn and his face tired.</p><p>"Hello Harry," Lopez smiled winningly before tilting his head and asking, "Why are you so wet?"</p><p>"Why are you so dry?" Harry asked in return.</p><p>"Well I used a spell I learnt that conjures something similar to an umbrella."</p><p>A sigh let the taller teens mouth and he through his head back, "right," he muttered, "magic."</p><p>Lopez chuckled slightly at the display of teenagaerism (yes I know it's not a word), it seemed so strange for someone to forget magic, he'd grown up with it after all. It made him realise that Harry was either a muggle born or a half blood, not that he minded. The only problem he had with those raised by muggles was there ruining of traditions. The traditions that welcomed magic, the scared being it was. "Well, how about you come around here and I'll dry you off?" He asked turning to look back longingly at his mound of pillows. He didn't care that the boy wasn't raised around magic, but maybe he could ask him about his traditions a little bit later.</p><p>Harry nodded with a grateful smile, gasping slightly as he left the fall of rain and found the pillows, Lopez drying him with a wave of his hand, a mutter under his breath and a small chuckle.</p><p>"Dive in," and the Gryff wasted no time doing just that, sinking into the comfort that was offered.</p><p>Lopez sat himself down across from the other teen, an amused smile on his lips as he watched Harry snuggle into the seemingly bottomless pile of pillows. "So…" he began, pulling a book toward him, "What were you doing out in the rain with no cover?"</p><p>He froze, almost looking as though he had been caught, before it cleared quickly replaced by a cowed look, as if Lopez was telling him off, and, he supposed, in a way he was. "Um…" he muttered, folding himself closer under the pillows and avoiding Lopez's eyes, "well I just wanted to get away ya know?" and Lopez tilted his head to the side in confusion, because that wasn't really an answer. "My friends are all hounding me. Wanting me to study or go to a party in one of the common rooms. Wanting me to be a hero and a spokesperson for everything." Harry continued when he noticed the look. "It's just irritating."</p><p>Lopez nodded, he understood the need to escape sometimes. So he decided not to push anymore, welcoming the other teen with an easy smile. "Well you can stay here as long as you want. Rest or read or I don't know?" And with the wet gone Lopez could make out that lovely smell again, oh it was amazing. Not that he would say that, not after the boy had reacted last time.</p><p>"Thanks mate," and then Harry closed his eyes and Lopez went back to his book. An easy silence reining.</p><p>But Lopez found he couldn't focus on his book when the other teen was sleeping so serenely. And for the first time he really got a chance to just watch the other teen. His skin was pale, like most English raised teens, and his hair was just a mop of black but it looked rather fitting on the other teen. Lopez wasn't ashamed of his sexuality, not ashamed that he found males so much nicer than females, but he did blush when he realised just how attractive the older gryff really was. And how his smell made Lopez's stomach flutter. Maybe he had underestimated the strong sophisticated elegance the teen carried in the short encounter previously. How it made him swoon. He shook that thought from his mind quickly. It was unnerving and confusing.</p><p>He blinked. He still had the others jacket, didn't he? he grasped the edges of said jacket and pulled them tighter around him. He didn't really want to give it up, it smelt to nice and was too comfortable and made him think of the nice seventh year Gryffindor who smiled really prettily. His blush went just the slightest bit brighter. He didn't really know what was happening here and he didn't know how to explain it, but he knew he had to find out. Perhaps he could ask Draco, Draco would know. But for now he would go back to his book and try and focus on something other than wanting to run his hands through the messy black hair. It just looked so fluffy and soft.</p><p>And try as he might his eyes just kept wondering back to the soft looking black mess of hair. And unable to control himself he stretched a hand out to run it through the untameable locks. Just as he thought they were soft, oh so soft, and a content smile stretched his lips as he continued to run his fingers forward in a gentle caress. He noticed how the other teen moved his head up into Lopez's hands and it made him smile more. With his hand constantly moving he was able to finally turn back to his book.</p><p>When Harry woke about an hour later, he made a surprised but not unpleased sound in the back of his throat, drawing Lopez's eyes away from the words on his page. The head moved slightly again, pushing up into the hand, that is until it froze, Harry's body going tense. The emerald eyes flickered open and he threw himself up, eyes wide.</p><p>Lopez pulled his hand back, stunned by the sudden mood change that had occurred. His hand felt suddenly empty and he looked from it to the other teens eyes. He let out a small whine of disappointment, the hair had been so soft, so calming. Yet those emerald spheres held something akin to disgust and Lopez had to look away. Looking at his hand was better than those disgusted eyes. "Sorry," he muttered.</p><p>"Um…" Harry looked down to, shuffling slightly. "It's fine, it felt nice. It was just unexpected."</p><p>Lopez looked up again, unsure. His words had sounded sincere but he couldn't possibly mean it could he. But his face held as much truth as his voice did and, although uneasy, a small crokard smile was sent his way. A smile that made his heart speed up just slightly inside his chest. He had speak to Draco tonight, find out what this feeling is.</p><p>"What are you reading?" the question is unexpected and makes Lopez freeze slightly. No one outside of Ravenclaw or his family ever asked him about his books.</p><p>His face lit up like a lightbulb. "It discusses the rules and reregulation's around magic and how to manipulate and change magic on an atomic level. It's amazing!" He launched into a long and excited explanation on his current book. While Harry looked intrigued he had looked just the slightest bit confused for a while. He didn't interrupt, however, a small endearing smile on his face and his eyes alight with wonder, the same way the Lopez's own were.</p><p>It was only when the sun began to set, the rain having stopped at least an hour before that he dared to speak. The conversation had somehow gotten muggle physics verses magic manipulation laws, and as interesting as it was, they needed to go to dinner. "Lopez," his voice was gentle, quiet, "We need to go to dinner."</p><p>Lopez shook slightly, his head turning to the side. His eyes sparked for a second and then he smiled kindly, a confused look passing his face. It was as if the Ravenclaw was coming out of some kind of trance and it was rather disconcerting for Harry to witness. "It is rather late, isn't it?" black eyes looked around at the darkening sky, "yes, time for dinner." The smile that was shot at Harry made his heart beat madly in his chest.</p><p>The Rave stood up with a flourish that somehow didn't fail to come across as elegant, waving his hand quickly across everything and it vanishing as if it had never been. Although, he supposed it never really had. Behind him he heard a small sound of shock, and looked at the older boy in slight confusion. Why was the boy shocked?</p><p>Green eyes were wide, his mouth open slightly and his eyebrows drawn up. "You can do wand less magic too?"</p><p>Oh, right. Lopez forgot sometimes that he could, that he was strong enough to. Not like he was crazy strong or anything but he could do many complicated spells both silently and wordlessly. He always forgot that not everyone else could. But then that word, to? A bright smile spilt his face. And he nodded, "I didn't know there was someone else who could at Hogwarts, you can?"</p><p>Harry nodded, giving Lopez that smile that made his heart buzz. "Well, I guess we should be getting to dinner, huh?"</p><p>"Yeah," and although he hadn't been hungry earlier he was suddenly starving, longing the feeling of meat in his mouth. Hmm, meat. The two walked slowly back towards the castle, idle talk filling the comfortable silence between them. In a single moment of clarity, Lopez looked up at the other, the castle doors just a little bit away's now.</p><p>He pouted. "You're eating at the Gryffindor table aren't you?"</p><p>"yeah," it seemed Harry was rather disappointed to be separated from the comfortable silence that reined between them too. Lopez felt it odd, to be so easy around someone he had just met a day before. Most made him uncomfortable, uneasy. And he was sad that he couldn't eat with the gryff.</p><p>And then they were at the door to the great hall, other students still filtering in through the open doors. Lopez smiled at him shyly. "Thank you for listening to me ramble, I know it gets annoying." For despite what some thought he was aware that he drifted into mindless chatter that few could follow when he really put his mind to it.</p><p>Harry shook his head, that damn smile present, "No, it was interesting. Maybe you could tell me more about it sometime?" and damn that just made Lopez blush. No one ever wanted to hear about what he found interesting, no one ever wanted to know. It was always too much for them.</p><p>He nodded enthusiastically before they had to part and he resisted the urge to reach out and touch the others hand gently. It was weird and he didn't like it. So, instead of heading to the Ravenclaw table he headed to the Slytherin one, where he knew Draco would welcome him. Few were aware of their connection but they accepted Lopez, if a little hesitantly.</p><p>He sat next to Draco, giving him a hug and smiling. "Hello Lopez, what's up?"</p><p>"I need to ask you something Draco," that was new and the look of confusion that spread across the other blood face was kind of hilarious. Lopez rarely asked Draco things.</p><p>"Okay…" it was hesitant but it was denying.</p><p>"I met this person and somethings happening but I don't know why."</p><p>All around those around were listening in, not even bothering to be discreet about it, and a look of amusement crossed most of their faces. Draco looked both amused and slightly alarmed. He made a continue motion with his hand, nodding.</p><p>"They make my heart beat faster and they smell so nice and are so pretty and I don't know why? Do you know?" Draco let out a bark of laughter, smiling. Before a look of dread crossed his features.</p><p>His little brother had a crush, someone was trying to take away his little brother from him. And if this someone hurt Lopez there would be hell to pay. But first he needed to explain what was happening. He let out a small sigh and noticed all those around holding in laughter. He glared.</p><p>He opened his mouth slowly to explain and promised pain to everyone in his house. They were dead.</p>
