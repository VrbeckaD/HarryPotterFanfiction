    <p><u></u><u></u>This is a story concerning the eight years I spent at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland, from 1991 to 1999. I was in Ravenclaw House,and made Prefect in my fifth year and Head Boy in my eighth,the first Hobbit to become Head Boy (my grandmother Adela Took was the first Hobbit Head Girl, in 1936). I was a Chaser for the Ravenclaw Quidditch team, and its captain in the 1996-1997,1997-1998,and 1998-1999 school years.</p><p>The primary point of view for this story is my fiancée,Lady Tracey Davis,who graciously agreed to transcribe her views of the strange events that occurred in the Wixen community of Great Britain during our time at Hogwarts. Her friend Aria Breuer also provided much information during our recording sessions, held between April 18,1999 and September 5,2000. These sessions were held in the History of Magic classroom at Hogwarts,where Aria’s grandfather (and our History of Magic teacher), Sylvester Breuer, transcribed our recordings onto paper. I am indebted to him for this service.</p><p>The idea of recording the events of (and leading up to) the Second Blood War was suggested to me by Samwell Tarly,who attended Hogwarts from 1987 to 1994. After graduation,Samwell became a historian of magic. At the present time,he is helping me in compiling a general oral history of the First Blood War,the interwar period,and the Second Blood War. That history will be available early in 2004:this work will be presented as an appendix.</p><p>In the light of the One and the Powers,</p><p>I remain,</p><p>FRODO BAGGINS</p><p>
