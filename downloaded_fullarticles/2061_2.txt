<p>College was fine. Sure, sometimes it was tough during exams, but overall fine. That’s what you would tell your parents and friends when they texted you and asked how you were doing. Fine with a smiley face. Not the boring kind of fine, just the averagely “not much going on in my life” kind of fine.</p>
<p>So was this Saturday. You woke up around nine and noticed that your roommate Louise hadn’t returned from her boyfriend’s dorm, as usual on the weekends. Pleasant. Having the room to yourself in the morning was nice. If there had been a possibility to get a single dorm room, you would have taken the chance immediately. Privacy was underrated.</p>
<p>Not that you didn’t get along with Louise. She was a nice girl. But you were two very different kinds of people and she liked to talk. A lot. Both of you had realised how little you had had in common after a few weeks of sharing the room in freshman year, so you had given up on making friends with each other rather quickly. It wasn’t a result of malicious intent though. Just two people who didn’t have enough common interests to keep a conversation going. So you had started sharing the room while not getting into each other’s business too much. You helped each other out when something critical was going on, but other than that, you lived your lives separately. Almost like co-workers who got along well at work, while both knew they would never spend a day with each other in their free time.</p>
<p>This Saturday, after lying in bed and scrolling through all sorts of social media for half an hour, you decided to lie in bed some more and picked up your laptop to watch an old season of Brooklyn 99 on Netflix. Some minutes into the second episode your phone vibrated once and you saw Remus Lupin’s name popping up on your screen.</p>
<p>

<p>A frat party. Wow. Not a thing you would have thought to be attending ever again. You had tried it out once, when your best friend from back home had texted you to “come out of your shell more” and enjoy college. The party hadn’t been enjoyable a tiny bit tough, so you’d gone home and had called it quits for partying.<br/>Remus was right though - you needed friends. It wasn’t that you had no one at all, but none of the people you were really close with were going to your uni, and anyone you had met here wasn’t worth the effort to stick with. Remus was a good guy - a friend of some sorts. You had partnered up with him several times in English class and got to know that even if he was quiet at first, he also was witty, smart and reliable.<br/>You weren’t entirely sure why he would go out of his way and invite you to a party. You knew he wasn’t asking you out; that wasn’t the kind of relationship you had with him. But if he was nice enough to ask you, you should be nice enough to at least show up there for a minute. </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>So it was official. You would go to a frat party. Yikes. Even if the thought of drunk jocks put you off a little, you were excited to meet new people. Remus and his friends would surely be nice to hang out with and if they were like him, they would be far from the pissed-drunk guys you once fled from.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It was a few minutes past ten when you were on your way to the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity. A few minutes past ten and you already regretted your outfit choices. The burgundy top and black jeans felt fine, what you were worried about were the sneakers. Some groups of girls here and there were swarming to the house as well, but almost all of them wore high heels. The one’s that wore flats were rocking ballerinas and left you feeling like a fashion outlaw, a tomboy with no manners. </p>
<p>Whatever - at least you weren’t going to suffer in half an hour. No one could make you believe that those shoes were even slightly comfortable.</p>
<p>When you could see the frat from afar, you took out your phone to send Remus a quick message.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb7b6eda26b14d737e01c923c99f2464/tumblr_inline_pfvovd4tMD1s2kilv_500.png" alt="" width="500" height="289" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3318472470" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3318472470" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>
</p>
<p>Once you entered the house you were glad to be wearing your tomboy shoes. Someone had already spilled a gallon of sticky liquid all across the floor, and most girls struggled to walk without slipping. Joke’s on them.</p>
<p>As you looked across the room to check for a familiar face, Remus suddenly appeared between two people whose backs were facing you. He squeezed through the crowd and greeted you with a smile.</p>
<p>“Hey there,” he called, loud enough to drown everyone else’s voices and the music coming from another room. “I’m glad you came.”</p>
<p>“Hi,” you said as he pulled you in for a quick hug. “So am… I.”</p>
<p>He grinned knowingly. “Doesn’t sound too excited.”</p>
<p>“Well. I don’t come to these sort of things usually.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know.” He turned his head to watch the people storming in. Everyone seemed to be excited to get drunk and kill off their brain cells. “It’s not my favorite time to be here either.”</p>
<p>A girl next to you almost tripped and held on to your shoulder to stabilize herself, apologizing curtly before she went off. “Why are we here then?”</p>
<p>“To pretend we like being squished and yelled at,” he laughed, then turned around and started walking to the next room. “Come on, I saved us some seats.”</p>
<p>You followed him to what you assumed to be the living room. It was big enough to fit fifty people; they must have removed some furniture for the party. There was a table tennis table on the far end, where some dudes already arranged solo cups to play beer pong.<br/>In the center of the room stood four leather sofas, two four- and two two-seaters, all facing each other in a rectangular constellation, with a wooden coffee table in the middle.<br/>One of the smaller sofas was unoccupied even though the room was packed, which left you guessing this was the reserved seat Remus had been talking about. You were right, he headed directly there and sat down on the end of the four-seater, next to a dark-haired guy in a leather jacket, leaving the two-seater for you alone.</p>
<p>When you finally reached it and sat down, you glanced around the room once more, still baffled why all those people would rather stand and be jostled every other second than take a seat. Your eyes darted back to Remus and you watched him talking to the guy next to him. The stranger’s hand rested comfortably on Remus’ shoulder, his tired grey eyes drawn to Remus’ mouth as he spoke, until he suddenly looked over to you. His glance made you realize how awkwardly you were sitting. Your back perfectly straight, both hands folded on your lap like you were in church class. While you tried to relax and sit like a normal human being, who wasn’t extremely nervous to be at a random party, the guy drew Remus’ attention back to you by nodding your way.</p>
<p>Remus turned his head towards you and leant over the armrest so you could hear him better. “Oh, sorry. I haven’t introduced you yet,” he said. “This is my… This is Sirius.”</p>
<p>You reached out your arm to shake Sirius’ hand and introduced yourself, but didn’t miss the dirty look he sent Remus’ way.</p>
<p>“I’ve already heard a lot about you,” Sirius said, his nonchalant expression back in place, as he let himself fall onto the cushion again.</p>
<p>“Oh really? Only good things I hope,” you joked and begged he wouldn’t notice that you’ve never heard of him before.</p>
<p>Sirius grinned and clicked his tongue. “Of course.”</p>
<p>“So,” Remus said and raised both arms as if he was presenting the house to you. “What do you think? Not that bad here, huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well,” you breathed and looked around the room again. “Not bad when you’re not getting pushed around in the crowd. How could you even save those seats when it’s full to the brim in here?”</p>
<p>They looked at each other with pleased smirks and Remus laughed inaudibly.</p>
<p>“Are you some sort of VIPs, or what?” you asked when suddenly your eyes went wide in realization. “Wait a minute… Oh my god, are you frat guys?!”</p>
<p>Now both of them laughed, Sirius scratched the side of his neck and laid his arm around Remus’ shoulder again. “We’re not.”</p>
<p>“They’d wish though,” Remus added.</p>
<p>Your hand landed on your chest automatically, thinking of how often you had made nasty comments on jocks and frat guys before. “Whew,” you whispered to yourself and swallowed down the lump in your throat. “Honestly, I was just preparing my funeral. But really, I wouldn’t have thought you were idio-”</p>
<p>“MAKE WAY FOR THE HOLY GRAIL!” Someone’s obnoxiously loud voice interrupted you. “For the golden liquid! The refill you all long for!” People started to part from the archway to the other end of the living room, until a tall black-haired guy came through, carrying a beer keg on his shoulder. He looked at you on his way to the beer pong table and winked. “No need to ask darling, I’ll save one for you!”</p>
<p>“Idiots like that,” you said as you pointed to the guy with your thumb and turned back to Remus and Sirius.</p>
<p>“Um yeah. We’re not in the frat, but our best friend is,” Remus explained and grinned again. “That’s him.”</p>
<p>Well fuck.</p>
<p>“I’m… sorry,” you said and tried to think of a way to take back every word that had left your mouth in the last five minutes. “I didn’t want-”</p>
<p>“All good,” Sirius chuckled as he stood up from the couch. “No big deal, we already know he’s an idiot. You guys want a beer?”</p>
<p>You just nodded along with Remus, hoping he wasn’t mad either. When Sirius had left to get drinks you took a moment to fester in your embarrassment, hiding your face in your hands, your elbows pushing down onto your upper legs. “I am so, so sorry. I’m just stupid.”</p>
<p>“Come on.” Remus’ voice still sounded like he was amused by the situation. Either he really didn’t care or he was good at hiding it. “I already know how you despise frats. You’ve told me. A hundred times I guess.”</p>
<p>“I know! And you’ve never told me your best friend was the cliche beer-keg-carrying frat king!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that funny?”</p>
<p>“It’s not!” You watched Remus laughing, he let his head fall back onto the cushion of the backrest, his hand holding his tummy like he was a little boy. “I’m so embarrassed. Oh god.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. We’re good, okay?” Remus said and you could tell he still had trouble hiding his grin.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess.” You still felt like an absolute bitch and hoped Sirius would return soon, so you could hide your face behind a solo cup. Sirius! A good change of subjects. “So,” you began and quickly turned your head to check if he was still out of sight. “Sirius, huh?”</p>
<p>Remus’ grin vanished as soon as he saw your wiggling eyebrows. He moved closer to the armrest and leant forward towards you. “What about him?”</p>
<p>“Is there something going on? Between you? You and him, him and you.”</p>
<p>“It’s complicated,” he sighed and seemed to check for him as well. “Always complicated with us.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Dropped a brick again. “Sorry. You never tell me about those things. Remus, you need to start telling me about all this!”</p>
<p>A tiny smile reappeared on his face. “Okay, okay. I’m gonna.”</p>
<p>When Sirius returned with two cups in his hands, he wedged himself back to his place next to Remus. Just when you started to wonder why he had only brought two cups, you noticed some abrupt movement from the corner of your eye. You looked over to your right just to witness Beer-Keg-Frat-King jumping onto the free spot next to you from behind the couch and were able to avoid being spilled on just in time.</p>
<p>“Whoops, sorry darling. My apologies,” Frat King said as he wiggled on his cushion and offered you one of the cups he held. “Promised I’d save one for you.”</p>
<p>He was the complete opposite of what you had imagined Remus’ friends to be like. Tall, broad shouldered, confident. Too confident, too aware of how good he looked. Messy black hair that looked like he just got out of bed and hadn’t bothered to do anything with it, because he was attractive anyway. The pair of round hipster glasses made him look cute and you hated that too. Careless, loud, annoying. Probably a huge douchebag as well.</p>
<p>“James, this is Y/N from my English class,” Remus introduced you and made you realize how long you must have stared at Frat King.</p>
<p>“Oh I thought so already. I’m James,” he said and raised the cup again. “I’d shake your hand but I’m a little occupied.”</p>
<p>“Hi,” you answered and took the cup. “And thank you.” Why the hell were you so nervous?</p>
<p>“How come I’ve never seen you around?”</p>
<p><em>Because you don’t care for your surroundings.</em> “Um. I guess I’m not around much. I don’t go out very often.”</p>
<p>“What a shame, huh.” James grinned before he took a sip. <em>What a fucking shame.</em></p>
<p>The hours passed quickly, you kept talking to Remus the most, because he was the one you felt most comfortable with. James and Sirius shared some stories from junior year and how they’ve managed to stay drunk for sixteen hours straight once. Smart? Not really. But quite impressive nonetheless.<br/>Later on another frat guy brought a tray full of shots and just placed it on the coffee table where you were sitting. Twelve of the small glasses were still full, so Remus did the math and placed three shots in front of each one of you. You took part in the first two rounds, but backed out at the third. Lukewarm vodka was the worst. So James sacrificed himself and gulped down the last shot for you. Heroic.</p>
<p>It was past one a.m. already when three other guys asked Remus, Sirius and James if they wanted to play beer pong. They agreed, so you got yourself another beer and watched them making fools of themselves for a while. All of them swore they were usually really good at targeting, and blamed it on the shots every time they missed a cup. After a while of watching them, when they were almost done, you felt yourself getting dizzy from the thick, warm air inside and told Remus that you would go outside for a minute. He offered to come with you, but you teasingly declined. You couldn’t stop them from winning now.</p>
<p>The house was still packed, so you wriggled through the crowd and tried not to get spilled or puked on until you finally made it to the other side of the living room and opened the glass door to go out on the terrace. The backyard was beautiful, even in the dark. The grass was nice and well kept, they had a pool and sunbeds all around. No flowers or fancy plants, but you guessed the pool must have been enough work to maintain for a bunch of twenty year old guys.</p>
<p>A girl was smoking a cigarette, but quickly stubbed it out and went back inside when you walked towards the pool. You were alone for a minute. Good. It wasn’t silent, the blaring music was still present, but a lot more damped than inside.<br/>You sat down sideways on a sunbed, just breathing in cool air and scrolling through Instagram for a while, until you heard the glass door behind you rattling and the music getting louder for a moment. Someone was walking your way. You turned around and saw him. James. Beer Keg James with his hands in his pockets. Damn.</p>
<p>“Mind if I sit with you?” His voice sounded completely different suddenly. Calm, quiet, likable. Soft.</p>
<p>“Sure,” you said and moved a couple of inches to make room. “I was just about to leave anyway.”</p>
<p>“Oh why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Just tired and dizzy,” you shrugged but smiled at him. “Did you win?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” He sighed when he sat down and moved his arms backwards to support his weight on his hands. “What a… What a night, huh?”, he asked and started chuckling. “Sorry I had one too many shots. You want to have some shots? I can get us some shots if you want. Nope? Okay, no shots.”</p>
<p>His babbling made you laugh and you shook your head lightly. “What’s the matter with you?”</p>
<p>“With <em>me</em>?” he asked and placed one hand on his chest over-dramatically. “What’s the matter with <em>you</em> is the question. I’m not the one sitting outside while there’s a party going on in there.”</p>
<p>“Yes you are.”</p>
<p>“Well yeah. But I wouldn’t have… Whatever. My point issss.” He seemed to be thinking of something to say.</p>
<p>“Your point issssss?” you asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know actually,” he said and laughed again.</p>
<p>You looked him up and down, watched as he had a great time with only himself and had to smile as well. “How come you’re friends with Remus?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“You’re so… Different.”</p>
<p>He sat up straight, still grinning, but squinted his eyes. “How would you know that, darling?”</p>
<p>“I know Remus-”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but you don’t know meeee.”</p>
<p>“From what I’ve seen today, you’re as different as can be. No offense.”</p>
<p>“Sure, but that’s my party alter ego. My drunk self, you know?” He smiled foolishly again and looked so innocent all of a sudden.</p>
<p>“Okay, I guess you’re right,” you gave in. “I don’t know you. The sober you at least.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m saying! We should go out some time.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Why?” You wouldn’t have thought that this conversation would go this way. Did he just ask you out on a date?</p>
<p>“Because,” he said and hiccuped. “I think you’re cute.”</p>
<p>“You’re super drunk my dude.”</p>
<p>“I know. That doesn’t make you less cute though. So, next Wednesday?”</p>
<p>His overly confident attitude paired with a decent amount of vodka and beer in his system made you laugh again. How could one human have so much poise?</p>
<p>“James, I’m flattered, really,” you grinned. “But you’re so drunk, I don’t think you’ll even remember talking to me.”</p>
<p>“Of course I will.” Now he seemed a little upset. “Let me at least get your number then. You can block me anytime.”</p>
<p>“Really?” you chuckled.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” he said and took out his phone from his back pocket. “There you go.”</p>
<p>You shook your head while you typed in your phone number. If someone had told you, you would have given Beer-Keg-Frat-King you number tonight, you’d called them crazy.</p>
<p>“Alright, thanks,” James said and pressed the call button. “Let’s hope you didn’t give me fake number, or this will be pretty unpleasant for both of us now.”</p>
<p>A second later your phone rang and James hung up the call. “There you go. You can save me as Jamesssss. With an S.”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll save you as Beer Keg James,” you said as you unlocked your phone.</p>
<p>“Creative.”</p>
<p>“Or Jimbo.”</p>
<p>“Oh god.”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised no one’s calling you Jimbo actually,” you laughed.</p>
<p>“That would be… Awesome and terrifying.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“The guys have always called me James. I guess because they’ve got these ancient names themselves. Back in highschool, we were a group of four. Just imagine us.” He raised his hand and looked into the distance, as if he was telling you something really fascinating. “Remus, Sirius, Peter.” His voice went really deep. “And Jimbo.”</p>
<p>You laughed out loud, even threw your head back for a second. Who would have thought he was so funny? “You’re right. That wouldn’t fit.”</p>
<p>He nodded and still chuckled at his own joke.<br/>“Alright Jimbo,” you said. “I think I’ll head home now.”</p>
<p>“Oh already? Why?”</p>
<p>“You should always leave on a high note,” you told him and winked. You winked? Dear lord. “Good night, James.”</p>
<p>You left him sitting on the sunbed and could hear his voice mumbling ‘Good night’ along with another hiccup.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Sunday morning was slow and heavy. The hangover wasn’t that bad actually. You weren’t nauseous, just really drained. After noticing that Louise hadn’t slept in your dorm once again, you got up and took a much needed shower.<br/>The thought of having to put clothes on and leave the house to get food put you off, so you lay back down in your bed with your bathrobe on and contemplated watching Netflix on your laptop until you would starve to death.</p>
<p>When you scrolled through the comedy section you had to think of James and how funny he had been yesterday. Stupidly drunk, but funny. You wondered if he would even remember any of it. Surely the alcohol had made him forget everything. Still, there was a tiny spark of hope that he had texted you, so you took your phone from the nightstand and your heart almost skipped a beat when you saw his name on your screen:</p>
