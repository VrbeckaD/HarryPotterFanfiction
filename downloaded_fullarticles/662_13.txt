    <p>Hermione Granger and Narcissa Malfoy have been friends since the beginning of Hermione’s 6th year when they bumped into each other at Flourish &amp; Blotts. They figured out that they had much in common. They kept in touch secretly as the war raged on. It was very dangerous for Narcissa to keep in contact with Hermione since the dark lord lived in her home. They succeeded though. They even corresponded when the trio were on the run, Hermione being careful not to reveal anything about the location they were at. Narcissa told her things to help her with the horcruxes. She had studied about them and had overheard what they were and where they were. She gave her a clue to where each one was. </p><p>Narcissa told Hermione that Helga Hufflepuff’s cup and the Sword of Gryffindor was in Bellatrix’s vault and that she could go take it and bring it to her since she had access to the vault. She took them without trouble. She told Hermione a bit after she took it from the vault. Hermione told her to meet her in the forest nearby where her, Harry, and Ron were camping. She told her the location and Narcissa agreed to meet her the next night. She trusted Narcissa to not give up their location.</p><p>The next night when Hermione was on watch and everyone else was asleep, she snuck away and went into the forest. She was startled when she saw a patronus of a snow leopard in front of her. It started moving away, expecting her to follow. She followed the leopard until she was faced with Narcissa Malfoy. She smiled. </p><p>“I didn’t know your patronus was a snow leopard. Mine is an otter.” she smiled, casting the spell to show her, except it wasn’t an otter, it was a snow leopard. Her eyes widened and so did Narcissa’s.</p><p>“I don’t understand..It was an otter just a few months ago..” she mumbled, biting her lip as she knew what it meant when you had the same patronus as someone.</p><p>Narcissa smiled at her before handing her the horcrux and sword. “Here.” she said, changing the subject. She knew something she didn’t want Hermione to know.</p><p>She took the cup and set it down on the ground. “I have another horcrux here around my neck. I need to destroy them both. Would you like to help me?” she asked her. </p><p>Narcissa hesitated before nodding “If it will help you.” she smiled. </p><p>Hermione hummed and gave her the sword. “Destroy this one and I’ll destroy the necklace.”</p><p>She took the sword and destroyed the cup with it. Something suddenly washed over them and they faced each other, Narcissa dropping the sword. Their lips met in a passionate and hungry kiss. They held each other tight, Hermione’s hands eventually starting to roam around Narcissa’s body. She tugged at her clothes, Narcissa undressing them both with her wand, both of them in their underwear now.</p><p>Narcissa pushed the younger woman against the tree, deepening the kiss before breaking it and trailing her lips down to her navel. She cast a warming charm on them both before removing her underwear and spreading her legs more. She leaned closer before pushing her tongue in Hermione’s folds, starting to swirl her tongue around. </p><p>Hermione moaned, gripping her blonde hair and guiding her as her tongue swirled around inside of her. Her breathing became heavy quick and she was fighting the urge to moan. It felt so good and she wanted the older woman to know she was enjoying it but she also didn’t want to be caught. She eventually just started to let small and quiet moans.</p><p>Narcissa smiled, pushing her tongue as deep as it could go, picking her up and placing her legs on either sides of her shoulders for a better angle.</p><p>The new angle made Hermione whimper, throwing her head back with her mouth parted. She cried out softly when she felt the olders nose start nuzzling her clit.</p><p>“Fuck Narcissa, please don’t stop.” she breathed </p><p>She smirked and ate her out until she came, Hermione moaning her name softly when she did. </p><p>She hummed and pulled away, gently putting her down. She stood, looking at her. </p><p>Suddenly, Hermione crashed their lips together again. She pushed the older woman against the tree, switching their positions. She trailed her lips to her ear “Now it’s my turn.” she purred, making Narcissa shiver.</p><p>She started kissing her neck, trailing her hand down. slipping it in her underwear. She spread her legs more before starting to rub her clit, making her gasp softly.</p><p>She eventually started circling her hips, moaning so softly into Hermione’s ear. </p><p>She pushed two fingers into her suddenly, making her cry out. Hermione shushed her gently and starting curling her fingers, hitting the right spot every single pump.</p><p>Narcissa couldn’t stop moaning softly, hips gently bucking. She grabbed her face and started to kiss her again, kissing her hungrily. </p><p>Hermione responded just as hungry, speeding up her fingers. </p><p>Soon Narcissa was gasping and moaning her name as she came. </p><p>She smiled and pulled her fingers out, cleaning them with her mouth.</p><p>Narcissa blushed as she growled and told her that she tasted good</p><p>“Thank you.” she mumbled. She then gasped “Hermione..what just happened?”</p><p>“I don’t know..It must have been the influence of the cup when we destroyed it.” she mumbled </p><p>“Okay. Maybe so. Yeah that’s it.” she huffed</p><p>“We still have the locket to destroy.” she said taking it off of her. She set it in the grass before getting dressed, Narcissa dressing too. Hermione grabbed the sword before lining it up with the locket “I’ll do it..” she said </p><p>Just then, a mist came out, starting to show a scenario she didn’t like. It was Lucius and Narcissa, They were very happy together and they were kissing. Narcissa and Lucius both calling her a Mudblood and telling her that she was nothing. She got lost watching it, tears forming.  </p><p>Narcissa bit her lip when she saw the scenario. She tried to get Hermione's attention but there was no luck. She eventually just took the sword out of her hand and destroyed the locket for her, making the image disappear. </p><p>Hermione hesitantly turned to face the older woman. They just stared back at each other for a while before Narcissa broke concentration “I would love to stay but I must go..” she said sadly. She kissed Hermione's forehead. </p><p>Hermione pouted “You can’t stay the night? It’s so lonely now a days..Harry and Ron are so interested in each other that they ignore me..” </p><p>She sighed, embracing her “Alright, I’ll stay but you’re explaining to your friends to why i’m here and why I'm laying in bed with you..” </p><p>She smiled and kissed her cheek “Thank you Cissy. I still have to watch for a while. A few more hours and we’ll be able to sleep.” she told her.</p><p>“Alright. Lead the way back to your camp.” she smiled.</p><p>Hermione took her hand and led her to their camp, both of them sitting near the fire, beside each other. </p><p>Narcissa shivered. She was so small so she became cold easily. Hermione cuddled up against her to warm her, Narcissa smiling gratefully. They talked until Harry came out. </p><p>They immediately separated and stood. Harry pulled out his wand. </p><p>“Why is Mrs. Malfoy here? She’ll tell her husband where we are.”</p><p>“No Harry, she won’t. She’s on our side.” </p><p>He looked at her confused “Explain.”</p><p>They all sat by the fire as Hermione explained everything. Harry was convinced that she meant no harm and that she wouldn’t hurt them. Ron wouldn’t be so easy to convince though. </p><p>Narcissa yawned “Can we go to bed now Mione? I’m tired and I know you are. It’s late.” </p><p>She nodded and stood, taking Narcissa to where she slept. “It’s small but it’s enough for the both of us if we cuddle.” she smiled</p><p>She smirked and took her shoes off, before laying down in the cot. Hermione did the same before joining her, cuddling up as close as they could. </p><p>They both smiled. They both fell asleep in each other’s arms a few minutes later.</p><p>The next morning was sort of stressful. Narcissa woke to people yelling. She heard Hermione's voice. She was yelling at someone. She sat up and blinked, realizing that it was Ron Weasley she was yelling at. They seemed to be arguing about Narcissa’s loyalties. She stood and cleared her throat. </p><p>“Mr. Weasley, you doubt my loyalties? Let me just say something. Would I take the horcrux out of my sisters vault and bring it here to be destroyed if I wasn’t on your side? Would I be here right now if I wasn’t on your side? No, I would have left while you were sleeping and told everyone where you were and you would be at my home right now, probably being tortured. I am on your side. I’m not like my husband. I do not like my husband. He’s an abusive bastard.” </p><p>Ron huffed and looked down in shame. “I’m sorry for doubting you Mrs. Malfoy..” </p><p>“It’s okay.” she smiled “I’m just glad that we cleared this up.” She then turned to Hermione. She kissed her forehead, cheek, and lips. “I must go darling..Let’s hope we don’t meet again at the manor..” she mumbled “Be extra careful love. I want you safe.” she said softly, embracing her tightly. </p><p>Hermione smiled and kissed her cheek and lips. “I promise to try to stay safe for you.” she responded, holding her just as tight. </p><p>Narcissa pulled back and nodded. “I must go.” she sighed “Bye Mione. Bye Potter and Weasley.” she said before apparating away. </p><p>Hermione sighed softly looking at Harry and Ron as they gave her a bizarre look “What?”</p><p>“You and Mrs. Malfoy..” Harry said </p><p>“Oh. That. Well..Something happened in the forest when we destroyed those horcruxes.” she blushed not saying anything further. </p><p>They nodded, not questioning her.</p><p>They moved to a new location later that day, Hermione putting up all of the usual wards to keep people away and to make it like they weren’t there, along with others. </p><p>Hermione’s thoughts consisted of only Narcissa and Narcissa’s thoughts only consisted of Hermione and her safety.</p>
