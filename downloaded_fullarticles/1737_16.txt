    <p>Adronitis (n)</p><p> </p><p>A feeling of frustration at having met someone you like, but knowing that the relationship will take a long time to develop.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁⌁</p><p> </p><p>“Athena?” Helena cracked the door open, “It’s just me honey” She said soothingly, walking slowly towards her.</p><p> </p><p>Athena sat on the bed, shoulders hunched with her blonde hair hanging down in front of her face. Silent sobs shook her body. She didn’t move when her foster mother came, only wiping away a stray tear as it rolled down her cheek. On her lap lay her future, the one letter that she had awaited for a long time. Next to it lay the letter that held her past, at least all that she knew of it. She fingered the delicate penmanship of her past compared to the regulated script of her future. She couldn’t help but think, “Am I ready for this?”. This was so important to who she was and although she had been preparing for the best part of a year, it felt sudden and, she hated to admit it, she was scared. She flinched slightly at the sudden hand on her shoulder but she lent into it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“Honey,” Her foster mother began slowly, “I understand this is very important to you, and your father and I have agreed to let you lead the way.”</p><p> </p><p>She sighed slightly, bending down to kneel in front of Athena, she brushed her hair out of her face and lifted Athena’s chin slightly so that they looked each other in the eye. Helena studied the ice blue eyes that studied her own, noticing the flicker of helplessness that crossed her eyes. She hated to see her daughter looking as lost as she was but she knew her and her husband couldn’t help. This was something she needed to face alone.</p><p> </p><p>Looking her dead in the eye, Helena explained: “We think it would be best that you buy your school equipment by yourself.” She registered the look of shock that crossed Athena’s face. “You know how they are with muggles and Muggle-borns and we don’t want to tarnish your reputation. You’re smart, you’re strong, show them that and you will get far. You have the ambition to take their world by storm, take your world by storm.”</p><p> </p><p>Another tear trickled down Athena’s cheek, but this time when she wiped it away, her eyes were set with a calculating determination and a small smile tugged at the corners of her lips.</p><p> </p><p>————————</p><p> </p><p>Athena’s step faltered only a small amount as she stepped into Diagon Alley. She had gone through all her books last night about the famous wizarding street and although she had felt prepared then, a wave of apprehension and fear coursed over her. Steeling herself she remembered her foster mother’s words, ‘Take their world by storm, take your world by storm’. Taking those words to heart she stalked determinedly towards the grand bank, Gringotts. Now that she had gotten over the apprehension, excitement tingled through her at finally being a part of this world. The bank was even more imposing close-up, but the building itself appeared elegant with intricate architectural designs. Entering the bank, she walked confidently but slowly towards the counters. Masking her fascination at the goblins who were working there, she walked up to one of the more kindly-looking tellers.</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later she left, her purse full of traded Galleons and her mind full of wise advice. By recommendation of the teller she talked to, Athena headed towards a store that had robes hung in the windows. She entered somewhat nervously, passing a giant of a man on the way in, but she didn’t let it show on her face. She was stronger than that. There were two boys inside that were being measured by a woman who worked there. Athena watched with contained wonder and awe as the tape measured floated around their heads, coiling snake-like around body parts while the woman working there recorded the measurements.</p><p> </p><p>While she waited, Athena discretely examined the two boys. They were around her age and slightly taller. One had gelled-back, platinum blond hair and a smirk on his face. The other had messy black hair with round, taped-together glasses and looked rather uncomfortable at the situation. They had both looked up when she came in and the blond boy was now staring at the giant man who still stood outside.</p><p> </p><p>“I say, look at that man!” He exclaimed suddenly and pointed to the door, eyes examining the person outside.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s Hagrid” the other boy replied, narrowing his eyes. “He works at Hogwarts.” Athena glanced over at the boy who wasn’t even trying to hide his distaste at the blonde boy, although Athena wondered why. Hagrid wasn’t exactly common (even in the wizarding world) as one of her books, titled Hogwarts: A History, had mentioned him. He definitely wasn’t a good role model.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’ve heard of him” The blonde boy was now also watching the other boy, with a slight sneer on his face. “He’s some sort of servant isn’t he?”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s a gamekeeper.” The other boy almost spat.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I’ve heard of him,” Athena mentioned, watching the black-haired boy’s reaction, “Isn’t he the one that collects illegal creatures?” Athena smirked as the boy turned towards her, glaring, stuck between admitting the truth and reverently defending the brute.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes exactly,” the blond boy said, studying Athena. “I heard he’s a sort of savage - lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed” He scoffed and turned back to the other boy, “What kind of a gamekeeper is that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I think he’s brilliant.” The black-haired boy ground out, eyes flicking between Athena and the blond boy and full of disgust. Athena raised an eyebrow at him. “What an idiot,” she thought, rolling her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you?” The blond sneered, “Why is he with you then? Where are your parents?”</p><p> </p><p>“They’re dead.” His voice was slightly strained and his eyes followed the worker, almost begging her to hurry up.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sorry. But they were our kind weren’t they?” The blond boy didn’t sound sorry at all, although Athena shifted slightly. Her expression hardened at his question, knowing exactly what he meant.</p><p> </p><p>“They were a witch and a wizard if that’s what you mean.” The response was muttered, as he watched the worker add the finishing touches to his robes.</p><p> </p><p>“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get their letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in old wizarding families. What’s your surname anyways?” But before the other boy could respond, his robes were finished and he rushed out of the shop to meet up with Hagrid. Athena straightened slightly and shifted uncomfortably. She had known this would happen.</p><p> </p><p>Blond boy looked slightly offended, but turned to Athena instead. “What about you? What’s your name?” He said it with suspicion in his voice, like her blood status wouldn’t meet his standards. “Of course it won’t,” She thought bitterly. Not that it mattered in the slightest to her magic.</p><p> </p><p>“Tanith. Athena Tanith” She looked at him coldly, “Muggle-raised, adopted.” He raised an eyebrow but didn’t comment. “And yours?”</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy. Draco, Malfoy.” He saw the recognition in her eyes and smirked. They chatted a bit while they were being measured.</p><p> </p><p>“My real parents left wizarding books with me at the foster home. They knew that I would be a witch so they must have been Half-Bloods at least.” Athena was surprised how comfortable she felt, talking about her parents with someone she just met. But she trusted Malfoy, for whatever strange reason. The bell rang as the door opened again, revealing Lord Lucius Malfoy standing in the doorway, analysing the two 11 year olds in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>“Still haven’t finished Draco? Who is this lady?” Lucius peered down his nose at Athena, who stood her ground and stuck her chin out slightly. Draco smirked at the gesture.</p><p> </p><p>“My name is Athena Tanith,” Athena lowered her chin slightly but didn’t lower her gaze. “It’s an honour Lord Malfoy.” She said with a slight smirk, although she was sincere. Another book her parents had left her was a directory of all of the pureblood families in Britain. The Malfoy’s had been high up on the list, one of the many families that had been Slytherin for generations. Athena first thought had been connections. She wanted to be a Slytherin, so getting to know Malfoy a bit more now would help to secure a higher place in the hierarchy that Slytherin classes called courts. There is a high chance that Malfoy will rule the court, and so gaining his favour would help boost her status. However, he was also very interesting and, unlike other elite families, could hold a proper conversation instead of just exchanging niceties.</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps you would like to join us Miss Tanith, this is your first time here and we can fill you in on anything important that you don’t already know.” Lucius asked gently, offering Athena a small smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course Lord Malfoy.” Athena smiled nervously, “As long as I’m not a burden” She added quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Draco smirked, “Of course not Tanith, it’s been nice to meet another student from our year. That I haven’t known from childhood that is.” He gave Athena a rare genuine smile and she felt her cheeks heat slightly. She ducked away a bit when the worker came over to talk to Lucius. The group agreed to come back later to pick up the robes, after Lucius had recommended the best materials and charms.</p><p> </p><p>“Lets go to Ollivander’s next” Lucius smiled at the excitement in their eyes as they wandered over to the store. Athena watched as he slowly regained his infamous cool expression as soon as they stepped out the store. Malfoy also put a smug smirk on and Athena tried to follow with an air of indifference. Apart from the excitement shining in her eyes, she thought she pulled it off rather well.</p><p> </p><p>A small, golden bell rang as they opened the door and stepped inside. It was cooler than outside and Athena tried her best to stop the awe she felt spreading across her face. Ollivander chuckled at her and Malfoy’s expressions, he was doing the same thing.</p><p> </p><p>“Lucius Malfoy” Ollivander greeted the adult of the group, “10 inches, Elm, with a dragon heartstring, a beautiful wand. And I see you have brought young Mr Malfoy, wonderful! Now, who are you my dear?” He peered over his glasses at Athena, with a cool curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>“Tanith, Athena Tanith” She offered him a weak smile at the mention of her surname, a rare moment of vulnerability.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry dear, none of here will judge you on your blood.” He glanced around at the Malfoy’s, “Unlike what they say” He muttered under his breath, but Athena heard it anyway. She had always had good hearing, even as a child, and it had been very useful at times. “Now then Mr Malfoy, try this one. 9 inches, Black Walnut, with a unicorn hair core. For you Miss Tanith, I have this one. 10 inches, Cedar, with a phoenix tail feather core.”</p><p> </p><p>Athena nervously accepted the wand, trying her best to analyse how it felt. “How will I know?” She thought. Suddenly the lamp slid straight off the table and onto the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“No no that won’t do, let me try another. One moment Miss Tanith.” Ollivander rushed to the back of the store and disappeared from view.</p><p> </p><p>“Give it a wave when he comes back,” Malfoy whispered subtly to Athena, “If something like that happens, it’s the wrong wand.” He lent back just as Ollivander reappeared, holding a new wand.</p><p> </p><p>“This one Mr Malfoy. 10 inches, hawthorn, with a unicorn hair core.”</p><p> </p><p>As Malfoy accepted the wand, Athena waved hers. She had decided to trust Malfoy for now. As she did so the lights sparked on and off for a few seconds, until Ollivander grabbed the wand back.</p><p> </p><p>“Not this one then, Mr Malfoy will you try yours?” Ollivander asked while packing Athena’s tried wand back in its case. This time when Malfoy shook the wand he was bathed in a shower of green and silver sparks. “Perfect! And definitely a Slytherin too.” Ollivander winked at Malfoy before turning to Athena. “One moment, Miss!”</p><p> </p><p>Once he had disappeared again Athena whispered to Malfoy, “Does it always show your house when you choose a wand?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think it’s always, but it does give an indication that is sometimes difficult to interpret.” Malfoy whispered back.</p><p> </p><p>When Ollivander came back, Athena was even more nervous. “What if I’m not a Slytherin? I always thought I would be but..” She bit her lip nervously as Ollivander described this wand.</p><p> </p><p>“11 inches, Cherry, with a dragon heartstring.” He paused and looked Athena in the eye, “A very rare and powerful wand” He said slowly as he handed it to her. The room was silent as she took it into her hands, admiring the intricate engraving. With shaking hands, she waved the wand. She watched relieved as black and green sparks landed all around her. She grinned as she turned to Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy smirked as he said,” I thought you might be a snake, you acted too much like us.” Athena rolled her eyes at him as Ollivander packed up the wand cases.</p><p> </p><p>“Two arm holsters as well please,” Lucius added, after Athena had paid for her wand. He silenced Athena as she tried to protest and pull out her purse, handing one to her anyway. “Your a bright witch, cunning too. Just think of this as a taste of what it will be like if I decide to sponsor you.” Athena’s eyes went wide and her mouth opened slightly, but she recovered quickly, smiling at Lucius and happily accepting the holster and putting it on before attaching her wand.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you so much Lord Malfoy. I’m sure you will be impressed.” She added with a cheeky smirk.</p><p> </p><p>Once they had gotten the rest of their school supplies, along with a few extra’s under Lord Malfoy’s recommendation, they started heading towards the owl emporium. The store had a similar bell when they opened the door, but it was much louder so it could be heard over the noise of the owls. Malfoy and Athena wandered up and down the aisles, marvelling at the owls and picking favourites.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Tanith! You should get this one, it’s named after you!” Athena rolled her eyes and ran over to where Malfoy was standing. In front of him sat a small owl, with a brown speckled coat and bright yellow eyes. On the cage hung a sign that read: Athene noctua, Little Owl. Athena laughed as she looked at it, it copying her movements and never breaking its stare.</p><p> </p><p>“I love her!” Athena exclaimed, “Have you decided which one you want? You liked that Eurasian Eagle-Owl right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah” They were silent for a minute as the attendant came and sold them the owls and some packs of food and other care kits. Once everything was packed away in their new Basilisk hide trunks, they headed out again. “Father,” Malfoy began, “Can Tanith and I go down to the sweet shop? I can teach her how to eat a chocolate frog!” Malfoy smirked back at Athena, who rolled her eyes. She was grateful though, and even more so now that she got to try wizarding sweets. At Malfoy’s recommendation, she bought a few chocolate frogs and stored the spare ones in the front pocket of her trunk. They then sat down in the corner to eat. “Okay, so, when you eat this you have to eat it quickly or it will hop away.” Malfoy rolled his eyes at Athena’s disbelief, “It’s true! It acts like a normal frog until you bite it. There’s also a collectable card in the packet, I have all of them but they’re still fun to collect and trade. Malfoy said smugly. They both opened the wrappers and Athena quickly took a bite. Once she had finished, she took out the card.</p><p> </p><p>She laughed, “I got Circe!” She said showing Malfoy, “How appropriate, I have quite an Ancient Greek theme going on right now.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy snorted, “Of course you do, your parents didn’t give you much choice when they named you!” They chatted about random things to do with Hogwarts and magic before Lord Malfoy came to fetch them. As they were walking back down Diagon Alley, Athena turned to Malfoy. “You can call me Athena by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy smirked at her, “As long as you call me Draco.”</p><p> </p><p>“Deal.”</p>
