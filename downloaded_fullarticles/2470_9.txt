    <p>It was creepy, yes it was James knew that but he couldn’t help himself.</p><p>The raven haired wizard rushed up to the dorm room he shared with his friends and checked that no one was in there with him before closing it with a slam. He rushed over to his side of the room and got on the bed, closing the curtains as quickly as possible before casting a privacy charm around himself. After all of this was done he took a deep breath and slowly reached into the inner pocket of his robes to pull out a scarf. It was grey and green, old and faded with dozens of little bobbles scattered over it, but James didn’t really care much for what it looked like, what he cared about was the smell.</p><p>James held the scarf in his hands for a moment; letting his fingertips run over the wool material almost like he was marveling at its wondrous texture and hesitated before he brought the material up to his nose and took a deep breath, causing a shiver to run down his spine, since it smelled so distinctly of him.</p><p>Severus.</p><p>It wasn’t as difficult as he thought it would be getting a piece of the Slytherin’s clothing. All he had to do was wait until class ended just before lunch. With the halls being so crowded no one really noticed when they were bumped into or brushed up against so all James had to do was wait for his chance to discreetly slip by and grab the end of the Slytherin’s scarf and slip it off his neck. Severus felt the disturbance of course and quickly realized that his scarf was missing but James moved even quicker, slipping into the dense crowd before Severus could catch sight of him and he got away.</p><p>James moaned as he kept the woolen material pressed against his face, reveling at the scent on the scarf as he felt his chest warm and his head feel just a little bit lighter.</p><p>Again it was creepy but James couldn’t help himself.</p><p>It was all Sirius’ fault.</p><p>You see James Potter has been-for lack of a better word-silently pining after Severus Snape for the past three years. He isn’t entirely sure when his infatuation with the raven haired Slytherin started exactly, he just knows that it’s been getting worse with every year that passed. But he hid it well so well that the entire school, including his best friends, was under the impression that he hated Severus Snape but was hopelessly in love with his best friend Lily Evans and was therefore silently pining after her.</p><p>A condition that Sirius decided needed to be remedied with immediate effect.</p><p>So, for the first time since he first arrived at Hogwarts Sirius willingly went to the library to do some research on ways to relieve his friend of his situation. Eventually somehow Sirius found himself in the restricted section of the library where he found a very helpful looking book on spells and charms. From there on he stumbled on charm that seemed to be exactly what he needed to help his best friend out.</p><p>See Sirius had thought the spell was a charm that could be used to reveal emotional connections, like whether or not someone had feelings for someone else. In other words whether or not Lily Evans really liked James and was just pretending that she found him to be the most insufferable creature on the face of this earth.</p><p>Unfortunately Sirius was only partly right.</p><p>Not only was Sirius partially wrong but his execution of the spell was absolutely atrocious and the spell that was meant to hit Lily Evans ended up hitting his best mate instead, which probably wouldn’t be so bad since the entire school already knew of James’ affections for the redheaded girl. But again, Sirius was only partly correct in his assumptions on exactly what the spell he’d found in a mysterious book in the restricted section of the library and decided to use without any real practice actually did.</p><p>Along with his assumptions on exactly who it was that James fancied.</p><p>At first nothing happened.</p><p>They were sitting in class at the time, double potions with Slytherin. James was sitting next to Moony a few seats ahead of him and Peter just a few seats behind where Evans sat in her usual spot beside Snape.</p><p>At first nothing happened.</p><p>Sirius was partly relieved since that meant that his poor aim hadn’t harmed his best friend in some way and partly annoyed since he’d wanted to see exactly what kind of affect the spell would have.</p><p>Class went by as normally as usual without any mishaps or accidents and after a while Sirius started to forget about the spell he’d cast when the period eventually ended and he suddenly noticed something… odd.</p><p>During the class, Slughorn had written a list of questions down on the board, mostly just revision questions on various potions ingredients, their uses and possible after effects when used or prepared incorrectly. They were supposed to answer the questions on a piece of parchment before handing it in at the front of the class at the end of the period. As always Evans and Snape finished first and spent the rest of the class passing notes while the Marauders finished last. Sirius was just putting on the last touches on his assignment when he looked up to see if James and Remus had finished yet.</p><p>They had.</p><p>Snape and Evans had handed in their parchments and Evans stood chatting with Snape as he packed up his things when Prongs and Moony got up to hand in their assignments as well. James walked by behind Snape only to pause for a moment. Sirius paused as well, thinking that James was about to pull some kind of prank on the greasy Slytherin bat, maybe shove him into the table, slip a dung bomb in his bag or maybe he was going to use some kind of hex.</p><p>Sirius watched in anticipation only to frown in confusion when James seemed to lean in towards Snape for a moment, seeming to take a deep breath of his hair as he shut his eyes when Evans asked him if he was lost and Snape quickly spun around to face the other. James flushed and mumbled out something intelligible before stalking off to the front of the class, leaving everyone who saw the scene completely confused.</p><p>Sirius may have forgotten the incident and thought nothing of it if it weren’t for what happened next. They were having lunch in the Great Hall, Wormtail had detention at the time. They were talking animatedly about Quidditch practice and the next game against Ravenclaw when they just happened to hear Evans make a comment about the fact that she didn’t see Snape at the Slytherin table before complaining about how they were supposed to study together after lunch and he didn’t seem to be anywhere in sight. One of her friends, Alice seemed to giggle as she suggested that maybe Snape was spending time with Malfoy again when James asked the girl exactly how she knew that.</p><p>“What’s it to you Potter?” Lily asked with her eyes narrowed down in suspicion and James paused before he answered, “Nothing, just curious is all.”</p><p>“Really? Since when are you curious about anything that Severus does?”</p><p>“Oh calm down Lil’s it was just a question.” Emily, another one of Evans’ friends who had a horribly obvious crush on James, said as she twirled a lock of her golden blonde hair around her finger as she looked up at James and spoke, “It was just a guess, Snape’s been spending a lot of time with Malfoy lately and Malfoy’s been giving him all sorts of gifts.”</p><p>“Gifts?”</p><p>“Haven’t you noticed? The new robes, brand new quills and ink pots not to mention how Malfoy always seems to be hanging around Snape on Hogsmeade weekends.”</p><p>Sirius gave a snort at that, “I hardly believe anything would be going on between them, Malfoy has a contract with Narcissa. Even an arrogant prat like him has some standards, I doubt he’d choose a toad like Snivellus over her.”</p><p>James growled and Sirius looked over to find his friend glaring at him and he was about to ask what was wrong when Lily drew his attention first wearing a slightly less intense glare than his friend.</p><p>“Don’t call him that.”</p><p>“It was just an observation.” Alice said with a roll of her eyes before giving a shrug, “Besides Snape doesn’t look that bad.”</p><p>Sirius gaped, “Excuse me?”</p><p>“Oh come off it Black.” Evans said as she looked back down to her Shepard’s pie. “If you weren’t such a narrow-minded troll you might have noticed that Severus is really starting to grow into himself.”</p><p>“Right like he’s growing into that gigantic nose of his.”</p><p>“Sirius.” James suddenly said in a warning tone.</p><p>“What?” Sirius asked when Alice gave a snort, “That gigantic nose hasn’t stopped your brother from drooling all over him.”</p><p>Emily giggled and Sirius glared, “Regulus would never-“</p><p>“Sure he wouldn’t.” Alice said with a mischievous smirk and Lily rolled her eyes as her friend continued, “Just like he doesn’t stare at Snape’s arse every time he walks by.”</p><p>Sirius’ glare got darker when Lily shook her head, “Calm down, Regulus isn’t even Severus’ type.”</p><p>“He has a type?”</p><p>“Exactly what is Snape’s type?” That question made Sirius pause to look back at his friend with a frown one that only got worse when he saw the light dust of pink spreading across his cheeks. But no one else seemed to notice.</p><p>Lily simply shrugged as she lifted a spoonful if mash and mince into her mouth when Emily spoke, “Phillip Diggory.”</p><p>Lily almost chocked on her food before she hissed, “Emily!”</p><p>“What, he asked.”</p><p>“You didn’t have to tell him.”</p><p>“Phillip Diggory?” Sirius asked with a frown, “Isn’t he a chaser for Ravenclaw?”</p><p>“He’s also the captain of the Quidditch team and a prefect and the winner of last years’ junior thinking cap prize <em>and</em> the captain of the Ravenclaw chess team.” Emily listed off easily despite the redhead’s glare.</p><p>“He fancies Snape?”</p><p>“No, he doesn’t and Severus doesn’t like him either.” Evans said clearly.</p><p>“That’s not what it looked like in the library last week.” Alice gave a snort as she mumbled out into her pumpkin juice while Lily rolled her eyes with a heavy sigh, “They’re just friends, Severus is helping him with his potions assignments so Diggory offered to help him with transfiguration.”</p><p>“Oh well that makes more sense than him actually liking that greasy bat. Although it’s still hard to believe that Snape has any friends at all, at least any that aren’t death eaters in the making, anyway.” Lily glared at Sirius when Remus suddenly spoke, “I think Snape looks alright.”</p><p>Emily giggled and Sirius gaped at his friend before letting out a groan, “Oh no, Moony please don’t start. If you get a crush on Snape I’ll never forgive you.”</p><p>Remus shrugged, “I’m just saying.”</p><p>“Why do you care who Snape fancies anyway Black?” Alice asked with an arched brow and Sirius sputtered for a moment before he spoke, “I don’t, it’s just hard to believe that anyone would actually want him, isn’t bestiality illegal?”</p><p>Remus gave a small smirk speaking low enough for only Sirius to hear, “Well, you’re one to talk.” And the animagus started to flush just as Emily spoke again. “I don’t know about bestiality but I bet Diggory would love to get Snape down on all fours.”</p><p>Lily flushed a horrible dark red while Alice let out a loud hearty laugh, Sirius made a gagging sound and Remus shook his head despite the light blush he wore because of the comment when James suddenly snapped.</p><p>“Oh all of you can just sod off!” James got up and immediately stormed out of the hall causing the entire table and some of those sitting at the next one to stare at him in surprise when Alice spoke.</p><p>“What’s his problem?”</p><p>The last event came just after Quidditch practice. They had just finished getting dressed and were making their way from the locker rooms back to the tower where Remus and Peter would probably be waiting, when they heard someone talking in the corridor that led to the Ravenclaw changing room. Ravenclaw usually had practice after Gryffindor on Wednesdays so it wasn’t all that surprising to run into the other team every now and then. What was surprising was the conversation they overheard between what sounded like Diggory and his mates.</p><p>“…go tonight, I’m studying with Snape.”</p><p>One of his friends sighed, “You’re still hanging around him? I thought you already finished with the assignment.”</p><p>“Ages ago, but Severus doesn’t need to know that.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you’re ditching us to spend time with Snape. You can’t be this desperate for a shag mate.” Sirius’ eyes went wide from his spot beside the wall near the corridor while James glared as the animagus whispered, “No way.”</p><p>“You realize that there are plenty of skirts in this school for you to chase right?”</p><p>“But Severus isn’t like the other skirts in this school, is he?”</p><p>“But-“</p><p>“Boys, boys, boys.” Diggory said in mock exasperation, “How many times do I have to tell you; a pretty package might be nice to look at but what’s the point if there isn’t any substance to it?”</p><p>“And exactly what kind of substance does Snape have?”</p><p>“He’s intelligent, witty with just the right amount of bark to his bite more than ample bite. I couldn’t find a more perfect match if I tried.”</p><p>“He’s not much to look at though.”</p><p>“They all look good from behind, mate.” Diggory’s friends laughed and Sirius gagged, “Besides, you know what they say about the quiet ones.”</p><p>One gave a snort, “That’s just a myth.”</p><p>“Well, I’m studying with Severus again next Friday night, that’s a good a time as any to find out for sure.”</p><p>Another laugh, they were close. Sirius immediately moved to duck away before they were seen only for James to stay right where he was.</p><p>“Prongs!”</p><p>The next moment Diggory appeared with his friends but there was only a moment for shock when James suddenly grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and turned around to slam him into a wall.</p><p>The brunette gasped only to glare at the teen in front of him who had shoved him firmly against the wall. Diggory was a good six inches taller than the raven-haired wizard but that didn’t seem to make much of a difference to James as he swiftly reached into his robes and snatched out his wand to aim at the older teens throat.</p><p>“Potter? What the hell do you think you’re-“</p><p>“Stay away from him.”</p><p>“What?” Diggory asked staring incredulously at the younger teen when his friends stepped forward. “Let him go Potter.”</p><p>“If you touch him I swear, I’ll kill you.”</p><p>“James!” Sirius suddenly snapped grabbing a hold of his best friend’s arm which seemed to bring James back and the Gryffindor chaser suddenly let go and stepped back staring at his hands with wide eyes when he just as suddenly turned away and rushed down the hall.</p><p>“What the hell was that all about?”</p><p>One of the Ravenclaws asked but Sirius didn’t stay to find out which as he went after his friend and found him locked in the bathroom in their dorm in one of the toilet stalls.</p><p>“What the hell is wrong with me? This can’t be happening, this can’t be happening.” Sirius could hear his friend mutter over and over again from the stall at the end of the room, Remus gave him a look as they approached the door until.</p><p>“James, are you alright?”</p><p>“I don’t understand, sweet Merlin what the hell?!”</p><p>“James,” Sirius started as he stared at the door curiously, “What on earth was that about? You just went absolutely mental on Diggory for no reason.”</p><p>“He did what?”</p><p>Sirius let out a heavy sigh, “We were walking back from Quidditch practice right and everything was fine, but then we ran into Diggory and his mates and James lost it.”</p><p>“Lost it how?”</p><p>“He threatened to kill him.”</p><p>Remus’ eyes went wide, “He did what? What on earth for?”</p><p>“I don’t know!” Sirius said with a sigh of exasperation, “They weren’t even doing anything, Diggory was just bragging to his friends about his dates with Snape.”</p><p>“Dates?” Remus paused, “I thought Lily said they were just friends.”</p><p>“Yeah well from the sounds of it Diggory plans on changing that very soon.” Sirius said with a cringe and for a moment it seemed that they’d completely forgotten their friend in the bathroom stall whose confusing mumbles had turned into low growls.</p><p>“I can’t believe that someone would actually want to have Snape at all. You should have heard him Moony, going on and on about shagging that greasy git.” The Animagus shook his head, “All the birds in this school and he chooses the ugliest snake here. I mean honestly, if he really does prefer blokes then he could have had a go at someone that wasn’t completely evil or at least go after someone that doesn’t look like they’ve never seen the inside of a bath before-“</p><p>Remus and Sirius both gasped at the exact same time when the bathroom stall suddenly flew open and James lunged at the animagus, grabbing a hold of the front of Sirius’ robes to drag him over and slam him against the nearest wall.</p><p>“OW! What the he-“</p><p>“Take it back.” James hissed and Sirius started to squirm, “What-James what the hell is wrong with you?!”</p><p>“I said take it back!”</p><p>Sirius paused just then as he stared into his friends eyes. They were dark and intense, burning with rage while the chaser’s skin had flushed and his body was tight with tension. He pushed Sirius into the wall a little more and the animagus blinked in surprise since the pressure on his chest was making it hard to breathe.</p><p>Has James always been this strong?</p><p>“Take it back right now.” James’ voice was lower, darker with the promise of something that Sirius didn’t even want to attempt to understand right at that moment.</p><p>Still the animagus swallowed hard and didn’t break his gaze as he spoke, “Take back what?”</p><p>“What you said.”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>“AH!” Sirius gasped before yelping in pain when he was suddenly pulled away from the wall only to be slammed back into it as James screamed, “You know what!”</p><p>Sirius just stared back at him like he was insane, “No I don’t you fucking loon now let me go!”</p><p>A few feet away Remus was watching the entire interaction; watching as the two friends bickered back and forth, with James looking close to murder and Sirius looking as confused as he probably felt. It didn’t make a lot of sense, James was behaving so oddly but really, his behavior has been off all day. Ever since double potions to be precise. Unfortunately Remus couldn’t for a moment understand what was wrong.</p><p>James’ first outburst came when they were in the great hall for lunch and they ended up talking about Snape. He was constantly watching the doors during each class and fidgeting throughout all of them, despite the fact that he normally liked his other classes since they didn’t have to share them in the company of Slytherin. He kept glaring at Malfoy and some of the other Slytherin students, which isn’t really all that odd but James has never been this focused on the Slytherins either. Then, according to Sirius, he had another outburst when he had another after Quidditch when Diggory talked about Snape. And now he looks like he’s having some trouble not killing Sirius for talking about-…</p><p>No.</p><p>Remus almost took a step back at the thought but it kept coming back to him. But-but it couldn’t be.</p><p>Could it?</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about!”</p><p>Remus’ head gave a tilt to the side and his eyebrows pulled into a tight line.</p><p>No way.</p><p>But-</p><p>“James?” The werewolf started as he tried to get his best friends attention, earning nothing more than a slight twitch as James continued to glare at Sirius and Sirius kept struggling to get away.</p><p>“How the hell are you this strong anyway?!”</p><p>“James.” Remus said more firmly only to be ignored again, so he took a step forward, swallowing hard when an idea suddenly came to mind.</p><p>But it couldn’t be, right?</p><p>“James, Severus is a dirty slag.”</p><p>It’s ridiculous but, James’ reaction was immediate.</p><p>He dropped one friend onto the cold stone floor in favor of grabbing the other and Remus gasped as he was suddenly shoved against a bathroom stall, but he didn’t struggle just stared at his best friend’s rage filled eyes in disbelief.</p><p>“Prongs are you insane?! Let him go!” Sirius said once he collected himself and rushed up to his feet while an odd little smile spread over the werewolf’s lips that made him stop in his tracks. “Moony?”</p><p>“Take it back.” James hissed and Remus’ smile twisted a little as he spoke, “James… do you fancy Snape?”</p><p>James froze and Sirius gaped, “What?! Have you both gone insane?!”</p><p>James suddenly blushed and his eyes went wide as he almost pulled back.</p><p>“James? Do you fancy Snape?”</p><p>The hazel eyed wizard let him go completely and took a step back, before he started biting his lip so hard that it started to bleed. Sirius’ eyes went wide.</p><p>“Ja-“</p><p>“Yes!” James suddenly yelled out before his eyes went even wider than before and he quickly slapped a hand over his own mouth.</p><p>“You what?” Sirius said quietly as his shoulders slumped and he stared at his best friend in complete shock, while Remus stared as well, “You do don’t you? Fancy him.”</p><p>James shook his head so hard for a moment Remus feared that he might hurt himself, but he pushed on anyway, “Then why do you care if he’s with Diggory? Why do you care if he spends time with Malfoy? If you don’t like him then why do you care who he shags-”</p><p>“Because he’s mine! No one should touch him but me!” James suddenly screamed out as his hands went down to his sides and he almost seemed to rush at Remus again only to freeze when the werewolf spoke.</p><p>“Since when?”</p><p>Sirius just stared at the two in confusion while James stepped back, Remus stepped forward and spoke again.</p><p>“How long have you liked Snape James?”</p><p>“Since the first day on the train!” James blurted out and Sirius’ eyes went wide.</p><p>“No way. Will someone please tell me what the hell is going on?”</p><p>“He was just so…” James let out a sigh, looking miserable as he stepped back and leaned back against the wall beside one of the stalls. The raven haired teen looked down at his hands, “He looked so small and helpless, miserable and poor but then he looked me right in the eye and insulted me. That little shit had the nerve to say that Slytherin was better than Gryffindor. The house of my ancestors-“</p><p>“What does that have to do with-“ Sirius interrupted before Remus hushed him, “Sirius let him finish.”</p><p>“When we were sorted I hoped, I wanted him to be sorted into Gryffindor, just so I could spite him. I thought if he was with us he wouldn’t be so arrogant he’d realize that he was wrong, but then he got sorted into Slytherin and those first few days he just… He ignored me like I was nothing.” James said with his voice laced in disbelief, “Me! My family has more gold than his could ever hope to have, I’m handsome and talented-no one in our school is a better flier than I am. I’m the best chaser Gryffindor’s ever had but no all he cared about was Evans and what she was doing and how she looked. It’s like I didn’t even exist. And then you messed up and almost got him killed.” James said gesturing towards Sirius and the wizard tensed while Remus pulled back, “I’ve never been more afraid before in my life. I was terrified. If anything had happened to him I never would’ve forgiven myself and then,”</p><p>James’ expression twisted in thought and then a smile started spreading over his lips, “After we made it out of the shack we made it to the lake and I realized that, he was clinging to me. It was like he needed me, like he needed me to be safe. Holding me tight and I could feel his heart beating right up against my chest. I whispered in his ear, I told him that he was safe that I’d never let anything hurt him ever again and he held on even tighter, but I don’t think he even knew what he was doing. You should’ve seen what he was like after Dumbledore called us to his office.” James’ eyebrows pulled together in a tight line, “It’s like he hated me more than before. He wouldn’t even look in my direction and when he did his eyes were so empty.”</p><p>“James-“</p><p>“Oh but Malfoy, Severus had plenty of time for Malfoy and his minions. Just letting that arrogant twat touch him whenever he wanted,” James said when he suddenly got up and started pacing, Remus and Sirius both stepped back to give him more room all while they gaped at their friend. “And then there was Avery and Rosier and your bloody brother and now it’s Diggory. Diggory! When did that even happen?! I’ve been watching Severus for months and I never saw that snarky pretty boy go near him and now they’re studying together?! Of course, that’s all going to come to an end because that infuriatingly oblivious slimy snake is so blind; he doesn’t know when someone’s trying to shag him. I’ve been trying to get his attention for months and nothing! Fucking nothing! At least Diggory’s managed to get him to agree to study with him but me? Of course, not me. The stupid prat can’t stand me!”</p><p>Sirius was gaping, Remus’ lips twitched up into a smile.</p><p>“He’s so- I’ve never met anyone so frustrating before in my life! And those books! Those dark books he insists on reading. No matter how many of them I ruin he insists on reading them. The dark arts are evil, everyone knows that but no matter what I do Severus won’t listen! He’s so fascinated by it all, I just I can’t understand why he won’t listen to me and and at the same time I-“ James suddenly stopped and leaned back against the nearest wall, sliding down until he was sitting flat on his ass as he sighed. “I want him so badly… I don’t know what to do.”</p><p>“Oh, sweet Merlin.” That’s about all that Sirius could think to say in that moment as he continued to gape at his friend. Remus on the other hand wasn’t as immobile.</p><p>The werewolf stepped forward and stopped in front of his friend with a tilt of his head.</p><p>“While I can’t say I’m not surprised by your confession James, I’m not sure I understand what brought it on. If you’ve been feeling this for so long why suddenly admit it now?”</p><p>James let out a heavy sigh as he threw his hands up in frustration.</p><p>“I don’t know! I usually have it under control, but today I suddenly just felt so… when we were in potions I suddenly felt this overwhelming need to just get down on my knees in front of him and beg him to forgive and accept me. To let me touch him or just to say my name once.” James stared up at his friend incredulously, “Can you believe that? Me beg Snape to do anything?! But I wanted to touch him so badly and then you all wouldn’t stop talking about him shagging other blokes-“</p><p>“I never said Snape was shagging anyone.”</p><p>“That’s not the point Moony. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t understand what’s going on.”</p><p>The werewolf looked away for a brief moment with his hands folded over his chest, “And this started when we were in potions?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Maybe Slughorn left some potions out during class, but then we all would’ve been affected by it so maybe something else.”</p><p>And then suddenly Sirius let out a sharp gasp and took a step back.</p><p>Remus and James both looked back at him and frowned when they found their best friend had paled considerably. The werewolf frowned.</p><p>“Sirius, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Sirius swallowed hard, “I-uhm…”</p><p>Remus was still frowning, James’ eyes narrowed ever so slightly at the look on his friends face when something in his head suddenly just clicked and he glared hard.</p><p>“You did this didn’t you?”</p><p>Remus looked back to James, “Did what?”</p><p>“I swear I didn’t mean for this to happen.” Sirius said raising his hands in a placating manner. Remus’ eyes went wide-</p><p>“What did you do?”</p><p>Sirius took a deep breath, “I can explain.”</p><p>He did explain. Sirius explained about the spell and the book and his plan to help James finally get the girl of his dreams after which James immediately lunged out in an attempt to kill him.</p><p>“You idiot!” James said while Remus tried his hardest to keep his friend restrained. Sirius kept back, “Are you insane?!”</p><p>“Look, I’m sorry I didn’t know the spell would do that.”</p><p>“And yet you used it anyway! Merlin this is almost as bad as when you sent Severus to the bleeding shack.” Sirius tensed considerably at that and Remus tugged James back.</p><p>“ALRIGHT CALM DOWN!” The werewolf huffed, James finally stopped moving and Remus slowly let him go. “Getting pissed and trying to murder Sirius isn’t going to fix anything.” The werewolf let out a sigh as he turned to the Animagus. “Sirius, do you still have the book?”</p><p>“It’s in the library.”</p><p>“We’ll have to go have a look.”</p><p>They went to the library, got the book and spent most of dinner huddled together in the forbidden section with James looking close to murder while Sirius kept apologizing profusely until-</p><p>“It looks like the only way to break the spell is for you to confess.”</p><p>James frowned, “Confess what?”</p><p>“You have to tell Snape how you feel about him James.”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely not.”</p><p>“You don’t have a choice. According to this you have to tell him, if you don’t it’ll get worse.”</p><p>James let out a sigh of frustration, “How could this possibly get any worse?”</p><p>“I don’t know, it doesn’t say but I’d rather not tempt fate.” Remus sighed, “All you have to do is tell him how you feel, and the spell will break.”</p><p>“I can’t, I mean, what would I even say? How would Snape react? He’d probably think it was some sort of prank.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t that be a good thing?” Sirius suddenly said from his spot on the floor propped up against a shelf, “The spell will break, and he’ll never know that you actually like him… for some insane reason.” Sirius said that last part quietly, James glared at him but couldn’t help but let out a sigh.</p><p>“Yeah, I guess you’re right.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Remus frowned eyes narrowed down at the book in his hands, “It says here he has to acknowledge your feelings. He has to take it seriously or else it won’t count as a confession.”</p><p>“Great! And how am I supposed to do that?! He hates me, he’ll never believe that I’m in love with him.”</p><p>“Well, we’ll just have to convince him. We don’t really have a choice in the matter. In two months, the spell will reach its maturity. The book doesn’t say what will happen when it does but the way you’ve been behaving today, I have a feeling it won’t be anything good.” Remus said with finality as he shut the book and got up off the floor, “We need to think of a plan, for now no more pranks from either of you and James you’ll need to stay away from him.”</p><p>The wizard’s eyes went wide, “I… but-“</p><p>“You threatened to kill someone today because they showed an interest in Snape.”</p><p>“He’s trying to get into Severus’ pants!”</p><p>Remus held up his hand, “I don’t even want to think about what’ll happen if Snape insults you. Just stay away until we think of a plan.”</p><p>They eventually did come up with a plan. They’d start slowly, James first at least getting on semi civil terms with the Slytherin and then slowly working his way up to a confession.</p><p>The plan was failing.</p><p>Its just. Severus was just so snarky and rude and brilliant, and his eyes were just so annoyingly endless. James tried to stay away; he couldn’t. He tried being civil; he couldn’t its like he just couldn’t control himself. There was just so much he wanted to say and do, and Snape was just so infuriatingly <em>Snape</em>.</p><p>So, James thought of a plan B.</p><p>Plan B entailed subtly wooing Snape without Snape realizing that James was the one wooing him and once enough time has passed, he’d reveal himself and by then Severus would be so impressed he’d absolutely accept James confession and maybe, he’d maybe they could finally be together.</p><p>Its been one month and three weeks, time is running out fast. James has felt his control slip away little by little with every day that passed. He didn’t know how the spell would manifest itself once it matured but he could feel that Remus was right.</p><p>It wasn’t going to be pretty.</p><p>James pressed Severus’ scarf against his face, taking another deep breath wondering how it would feel to pull Snape close like this. To smell the scent right off his skin, kiss and touch him. the Gryffindor chaser couldn’t help but moan as he lay back against the bed.</p><p>Just a few more days, in a few days he’ll confess everything.</p>
