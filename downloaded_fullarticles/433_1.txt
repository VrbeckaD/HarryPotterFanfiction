  <span class="s1">Ginny rested her hand on Harry’s wet back, grinning when he let out a squawk of surprise. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I thought you were sleeping!” he said. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Just dozing. I wanted to see you,” she said. Her cheek pressed against edge of his shoulder blade. Unable to resist, she nuzzled him a little, then pressed a kiss against his skin. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“This is a nice surprise,” he said. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But when he moved to turn and take her into his arms and — Ginny had no doubt — kiss her thoroughly, she gripped him by his hips. “No,” she said. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No?” he asked. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her fingers pressed harder, and she pressed herself all along his back. “Turn the shower back on, Harry, I don’t want to get cold,” she ordered. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Bossy tonight, are we?” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ginny knew he meant to sound amused and nonchalant, but his body had given an ever so slight shudder. “You’re going to enjoy it,” she promised. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hot water cascaded over both of them. Ginny wrapped her arms around him, then, running her fingers up his sides, and across his chest. He cleared his through when her thumbs found his nipples. Ginny toyed with them, plucked at them, and teased them until they were as stiff as hers. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What are you doing?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Trying to impress you,” she murmured. “Is it working?” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Witch,” Harry breathed. “Careful, or I won’t last long.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not worried about that,” she told him. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Good,” he said. Then he grabbed her hand in a tight grip and dragged it down his belly where he pressed it hard against him. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was why Ginny’d waited until he was nearly done with his shower before she’d joined him. It was past midnight but she’d known he would still have energy to burn, that he wouldn’t want to wake her up, and that his shower would include a happy ending. Thus she hadn’t been surprised when she’d seen his silhouette through the translucent wall. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He hadn’t been nearly as hard as he was now, though. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ginny touched him. He was hot under her hand — hotter than the water — and she squeezed. He rewarded her with a moan. There was a pause — did she want to linger over him the way she usually did? Or just go for the gusto? </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She shifted against him, scraping her sensitive nipples against his back. “Lift your arm,” she said. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He did so immediately, bracing it against the pale blue shower wall. Ginny peeked around his torso, wanting to watch as she touched him. It was a gratifying sight: his penis, flushed with heat and desire, pointed straight at her, its small eye throbbing. He was so aroused, so very aroused, Ginny didn’t have the heart to tease him, so when she made her first stroke, it was firm and fast.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His grunt told her it was the right choice. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I missed you,” she murmured. She didn’t take her eyes off him, watching the way she pumped him. “I had to make myself come last night, wanting you in me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t — don’t tell me you can’t... can’t make it two days without me shagging you,” Harry said. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ginny bit him on his side. “I’d prefer not to have to go twelve hours,” she told him.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A breathless laugh erupted out of him. When he didn’t comment, didn’t try to tease her, didn’t do anything but moan, Ginny knew he was close. Her strokes were harder and faster now. Her other hand dipped down to his sac, squeezing in a light, pulsing rhythm. The head of his penis was a bright red now, and his groans were louder than the water hitting the floor.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His whole body tensed in her arms, and a shudder rippled through him. A moment later, the first streak of white spurted out of the tip and splattered against the translucent blue wall. It hovered there, a glossy rope, before the water washed it down. His penis pulsed in her grip as she milked him, watching with interest as more and more came out of him. He was leaning forward now, bracing himself with both hands against the wall, head bowed under the spray. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ginny trailed kisses along his back as he recovered, pulling away slightly, and flicking her wet hair out of her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That was brilliant, Gin,” he rasped out. This time, when he turned, she let him. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Was that a nice little treat?” she asked, grinning at him. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Very,” he said. “I’m just surprised.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That I didn’t immediately have my way with you?” Ginny asked. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, yeah,” said Harry. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ginny wrapped her arms around him, and buried her nose against his chest. “I still plan to,” she said. “I’m not done with you yet.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The water stopped with the same abruptness with which it started. There was a gleam in those green eyes that told her he was up to whatever she had in mind for that night. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Actually,” he said. “I think it’s </span>
  <span class="s2">my </span>
  <span class="s1">turn to impress </span>
  <span class="s2">you.</span>
  <span class="s1">” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And he proceeded to do just that.</span>
