    <p> </p><p align="center">Chapter One: Draco tries to get through a simple extraction mission</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>If there was anything that he hated more than his boss waking him up at four in the morning to travel to London it was the horrible English weather. It was moments like these that he missed his family’s chateau in the south of France. Too bad he will never be able to go there again. His childhood vacation home was now just a distant memory, like his mother’s kisses and days spent playing football. Memories that haunted  him at night and brought about such an intense yearning that he was sometimes unable to move from the pain in his chest.</p><p> </p><p>

  <em> You have only one chance to get this right. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco looked up at the apartment building across the street from where he stood  and sighted. Considering Potter’s financial situation the state of the building was surprising he still had hope that it was maybe better on the inside. He started walking towards the building knowing that he was going to be disappointed.</p><p>***************************************************************************</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter was nothing impressive. He was shorter than him with a mop of dark hair and bright green eyes behind glasses that were slowly sliding down his nose. Potter, to his credit, did not seem to trust him and did not allow him to get into the apartment until Draco said the magic words.</p><p> </p><p>“Let us cut the crap.” He said while fixing his tie, “I can help you find your family.”</p><p>Potter frowned, “My family is dead.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lupin isn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>The frown fell off his face and was replaced with hope and then skepticism. He walked into the apartment and Draco followed him. He knew Potter was a fan of racing what he did not expect was the various blueprints of motorcycles hung up on the kitchen walls. Potter sat on top of the kitchen counter while Draco made himself comfortable on the chair of the kitchen table (not <em> too </em> comfortable though, the chair was old).</p><p> </p><p>“Who are you and how do you know about Lupin?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco raised his eyebrow, apparently Potter was one of the brash types, “First tell me what you know.”</p><p>As Potter opened his mouth to argue Draco continued, “You can not expect me to just disclose such sensitive information, I need to first know your scope of the situation at hand.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter sighted, “I know that my parents owned a large company that distributed chemicals and that there was a fire once at the factory and that it destroyed everything.”</p><p>Drao made a motion with his hand for him to go on.</p><p>“I know that the fire was started by Sirius Black and that my parents died in the fire, the body of Remus Lupin was however, never found even after their will disclosed that he was second in place to be my legal guardian.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco could feel that Potter was starting to sink deeper into his thoughts, “And how exactly did you come up with this information.”</p><p> </p><p>“My aunt told me.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco had read the file and he knew that Potter’s previous home life was a big no-no, he was glad that the man seemed to know <em> something </em>. It made his job much easier. Even if his knowledge about what his parents did was very limited.</p><p> </p><p>He was about to explain everything to Potter when something caught his eye from the window next to where Potter was sitting.</p><p> </p><p>Draco quickly stood up and lied flat on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“Potter I’m going to need you to come down here for a minute.”</p><p> </p><p>**************************************************</p><p> </p><p>This was supposed to be an easy job. Extract Potter and bring him to Tom that was it. He did not sign up for unknown variables.</p><p> </p><p>He looked at Potter who still hadn’t  gotten on the floor yet. There was a look of confusion on his face as he stared at Draco lying on his stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s  happening?”</p><p> </p><p>“Someone is watching us from the building across the street.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter’s shoulders tensed, “Just who are you exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>“Does that actually matter, we just found out that you’re under surveillance, they could have bugs in the apartment for all we know.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “We?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Follow my lead Potter, and we might make it out of this alive.”</p><p> </p><p>He was going to have to have to use brute force, it seemed,  because Potter was still not getting on the damn floor.</p><p>Draco crawled forward and grabbed his hand, pulling him to the floor next to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Now we have about a minute before whoever was watching you comes barging in here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who are they?” Potter seemed to finally register the situation because there was fear in his eyes, coupled with grim determination. Draco was glad that the idiot still had the will to live.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.” He knew that there were two possibilities they either wanted Potter dead or they wanted him alive and since Tom had not disclosed why he needed Potter, Draco did not know which one was worse. The one thing that he knew for sure is that he was ordered to bring Potter in alive and if he failed this mission then whatever those guys had in store for Potter would be nothing compared to what Tom will do to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Where’s the bike?”</p><p> </p><p>The question seemed to have broken Potter from his silence. “In the shed in the back.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” His eyes met Potter’s green ones, “We’re going to need it.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco then got up to his feet and ran out of the door the sound of footsteps behind him assured that Potter was not a complete idiot and that at least he had the brain to follow him.</p><p> </p><p>The sprint to the shed was a short considering Potter lived on the third floor. He knew whoever he was dealing with was dangerous, however when he found them waiting for them by the back door of the building he knew they were fucked. He had made a rookie mistake and treated this job as if it was nothing. His experience with this sort of thing led him to a false sense of security and now he was going to pay for it. Really he did not even notice them until he heard the click of the gun and turned around to meet blazing dark eyes.</p><p>The first thing that Draco noticed about her was that she was small. She was dressed in dark pants and a dark shirt and boots that he knew would hurt if she managed to land a kick. He pushed Potter behind him and hoped that he had the instinct to run.</p><p> </p><p>“Hand him over.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry but you see it is of the highest importance that he stays with me.”</p><p> </p><p>He did not expect her to shoot. He managed to move just in time to avoid the bullet being embedded in his shoulder it did graze him though. He turned to see Potter make it just in time to ride his bike and drive into the street before the woman reached him. Draco could hear her curse and get into a car as she chased after Potter.</p><p> </p><p>Whoever she was, she was highly trained. She didn't even hesitate to pull the trigger and the way she drove the car showed experience. He had interacted with an unknown person  and Potter was by himself.</p><p>Tom was going to fucking skin him alive.</p><p> </p><p>He was starting to contemplate the ways in which he can escape his fate, knowing that each scenario was even more unlikely than the ones before it, when he heard a screech of Potter’s tires as the fool came back for him. The man was making his life so much harder.</p><p> </p><p>He got on to the bike behind Potter just as that bitch’s car rounded the corner. As Potter speeded up he quickly turned around so his back was facing Potter’s, and took his gun out of its holster. Using his uninjured arm he shot at the wheels of the car making it crash to nearby tree. His left hand must have not been as quick as his right (despite all the training he’s done) because the women was able to jump out of the car before it crashed. He turned back quickly not wanting to know what happened to the woman and winced as the pain in his shoulder intensified.</p><p> </p><p>“Where are we going?” Potter raised his voice so he could be heard over the roaring wind.</p><p>That was why Draco prefered cars to motorcycles. “Just make a couple of left turns and then one right to make sure no one is following us.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter nodded and sped up again.</p><p> </p><p>**************************************************</p><p> </p><p>Tom was on the chair in his hotel room when he opened the door.</p><p> </p><p>Next to Tom stood Theo, latex gloves at the ready and with all his equipment beside him spread on the coffee table. The sight of Theo had never made him happier. He walked into the room and collapsed on the couch as Potter closed the door.</p><p> </p><p>“I take it you ran into some trouble.” Tom’s voice was as cold as ever but at least he was not angry. That would’ve been so much worse.</p><p> </p><p>“I took care of it.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom nodded, “ I’m sure you did.” He turned to Potter. “Mr. Potter it’s a pleasure to meet you, I only regret that it wasn’t under better circumstances.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco turned his head, ignoring Theo’s glare and looked at Potter’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“He said that you can tell me about Lupin.”</p><p> </p><p>The corner of Tom’s mouth twitched and Draco knew that was the closest thing Potter would ever see resembling a smile from Tom’s face. That is if Potter ever saw Tom again.</p><p> </p><p>“We will talk about this in the morning, you must be tired.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco saw Potter open his mouth to argue and then close it. Even though Tom’s back was to Draco and Theo, his face must have showed Potter that Tom was not a man you argued with. He was the kind of man you obeyed.</p><p> </p><p>Tom turned and raised his brow at his hiss of pain as Theo dressed his wound. When Theo was done he quietly packed his equipement and left. Tom looked at Draco and then Potter.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Potter you will be staying with Draco here until we can meet again,” He then fixed Draco with a look, “I am sure that he will be the most gracious of hosts.”</p><p> </p><p>Then he too left leaving Draco on the couch with a very angry and confused looking Potter.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know about you, but I can use a drink.” He then lifted his uninjured arm,” Draco Malfoy, pleasure to meet you.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter looked at his arm and then walked to the mini fridge and started pulling out the small bottles of whisky.</p><p> </p><p>Draco might start to like him after all.</p><p> </p>
