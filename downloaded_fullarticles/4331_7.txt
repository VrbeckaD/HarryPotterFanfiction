    <p>She does not think of it when she sees Fleur exit the Beauxbatons carriage during her fourth year at Hogwarts. Neither does she think of it when Fleur walks up to the champion’s room when her name is spat from the goblet of fire. She does not even think it when she spies Fleur at Gringotts during her pre-fifth year shopping at Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>No, it is not until the summer before her sixth year at Hogwarts, when she is visiting the Weasleys for an extended stay at the exact same time as <em>her</em> that she realizes: Hermione has met Fleur Delacour before, outside of Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, and Great Britain entirely.</p>
<p>They met while she was on Holiday in France, just after her first year in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Hermione realizes this over breakfast the second morning into her stay with the Weasleys. She is eating her eggs, pretending to listen to Fleur talk animatedly about the south of France. Ginny is making snide faces behind her back, and Hermione has to struggle to keep a straight face. Something that Fleur says catches her ear, however, “...I spent much of my summers growing up on the beaches there. Oh, how many people I would meet! British tourists would always find their way to the shores, not to mention the odd witch or wizard.” She laughs in that airy, other-worldly way that makes Hermione question the state of her insides. They always churn like she’s just leapt from a great height.</p>
<p>And then, the memory strikes Hermione so hard that her mouth falls half-open. She stares at Fleur, unable to believe that this woman is the same girl she had met on the beach, speaking in broken English and giggling at the broken French Hermione spoke back.</p>
<p>“It – it’s you,” she mutters.</p>
<p>Fleur blinks and halts her story, casting Hermione a curious glance. “Well, of course I am me, Hermione. </p>
<p>“No, I mean, I spent a summer in the south of France, and I could swear that I ran into you and your little sister on the beach a few times. She...she always called you something else though.”</p>
<p>Fleur’s cheeks color a bright red. “Soeur Fleur, probably. She ran it together like one word when she was little.” But Fleur pauses and studies Hermione more closely. Her eyes scan over her with a scrutiny that makes Hermione flush. “I...that is right. I remember now.” She speaks as if she is really back all those years, reliving the moments on the beach where she and Hermione tried to have fun between the bustle of all the other older, boring tourists.</p>
<p>The beach they had been on was infamous for being a quiet, unexciting place. It drew retired travelers and parents looking for peace. If Fleur had not lived nearby, Hermione guesses she probably would have found another beach to party at. She remembers Fleur, who must have been 14 at the time, running wildly down the sandy beach with her baby sister following close at her heels. She would always be laughing, tossing her mane of glimmering blond hair as she ran, and something about the way she laughed caused Hermione’s insides to go funny even back then.</p>
<p>There had been no one else even near her age at the beach. Of course, she did not even work up the courage to talk to Fleur. It had been Fleur who approached her first.</p>
<p>And Fleur’s cheeks are still a dark red, as she no doubt remembers all of this as well. Hermione wonders how neither of them could have recognized one another before now. Then again, neither of them has been together for any amount of time between then and now. “That was quite some summer,” Fleur says, the same sense of distance still caught in her throat.</p>
<p>“Yes, it was.” Hermione goes back to eating her breakfast because it is too embarrassing to think on those memories for long, especially in a kitchen with Fleur, Ginny, and Molly, and especially while Fleur is here as Bill’s girlfriend. Hermione’s stomach feels odd again, even though Fleur is not laughing anymore.</p>
<p>Ginny glances between the two of them, a furrow forming in her brow. She pushes her plate aside and clears her throat. “Hermione, would you come help me with my arithmancy after you’re done?”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Hermione asks. She cannot remember if Ginny had ever actually enrolled in arithmancy.</p>
<p>Ginny nods her head seriously. “I’m so scared I’m going to flunk my summer studies.”</p>
<p>“Well, alright then.” Hermione quickly finishes her food and brings the plate over to Mrs. Weasley, who raises a brow at both her and Ginny.</p>
<p>“You’ve got weeks left before the term starts, Ginny. It’s not like you to fuss,” she says, a hint of suspicion in her voice.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s a really long problem. I’m not going to get through it just today.” This answer seems to satisfy Mrs. Weasley, and the two of them run upstairs to Ginny’s room. When they get there, Ginny shuts the door and rounds on Hermione. “Spill it,” she says, fixing Hermione with an unblinking stare. Her mouth is upturned in a smirk and suddenly Hermione is feeling very, very nervous.</p>
<p>“I...I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“Don’t play stupid with me, <em>‘ermione</em>. I want to know what happened between you and Fleur during that summer in France.”</p>
<p>“I was twelve, it was nothing dramatic.”</p>
<p>“It was dramatic enough to make Fleur blush harder than a French harlot,” Ginny says with an air of sarcasm. She flips her hair back in a mocking imitation of Fleur’s own actions. She saunters over to the bed and plops down, patting a spot next to her. Hermione joins, reluctantly, and allows Ginny to rest her head on her shoulder. “Did you two kiss? Should I tell Bill?”</p>
<p>Hermione feels her face grow hot as the memories of that summer flood back. Yes, they had kissed. It had been chastely, though, not the messy snogging that most of her classmates participated in these days. “It’s how they say goodbye, over there,” she says, knowing that this will only spur on Ginny’s imagination.</p>
<p>Ginny cackles wickedly. “Is that what she told you? Hermione, she was stealing kisses from you.”</p>
<p>“It was always on the cheek! Well, aside from the last time.” Hermione touches her fingers to her lips, remembering the faint brush of lips that happened so quickly she had been sure it was an accident. She had said, <em>goodbye, Sirflor</em>, which she had been convinced was Fleur’s name thanks to Gabrielle, and Fleur had leaned in to peck her on the cheek. Except she changed course at the last second. “It was nothing to write home about, though.”</p>
<p>Ginny laughs even more. “You’re saying the part-veela is bad at snogging?” </p>
<p>“It wasn’t a snog, Ginny. We were barely teenagers. All sorts of kids our age were trying out kissing. Dating meant hand-holding and the occasional peck on the cheek.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so you were dating, now?” There is a glint of pure, delighted evil in Ginny’s eyes.</p>
<p>“No! Not at all! We were friends over the summer, and we lost touch, possibly because I found the idea of sending an owl across the English channel revolting.” Hermione’s heart is hammering. She hears the implications behind this conversation, and it is ringing a warning bell inside her head.</p>
<p>This is perhaps another reason that Hermione has simply refused to remember Fleur: she did not want to question her sexuality. Hermione remembers what little time she spent in muggle school and the cruel, incessant bullying that hounded her for not being popular, for not fawning over every pretty boy, and for not keeping up with the latest fashion statements, and to top it all off, she was a witch, meaning that she could not even lead a “normal” life by their standards. Hermione has never wanted a “normal” life anyway, but she cannot deny that the whispers she endured stung.</p>
<p>They had stung enough so that when Fleur kissed her, she felt as if she had no choice but to ignore whatever rising storm of emotions had clamored to respond to Fleur.</p>
<p>“You think she still fancies you?” Ginny asks, bringing her back to the present.</p>
<p>Hermione shakes her head. “She’s with Bill.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but that’s before she realized you were her summertime fling.”</p>
<p>“Honestly, Ginny. It wasn’t a fling.” But it does little good to say this, because Ginny is grinning widely at her. “What’s the matter with you? Don’t you hate Fleur?”</p>
<p>“I did, but now it’s so much more intriguing to imagine that she could dump Bill for you.”</p>
<p>Hermione snorts. “You’re being ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“Did you see how red her face got?”</p>
<p>Hermione remembers the blush on Fleur’s face. She also recalls several lectures from History of Magic regarding prejudices in the wizarding community and how they differ from muggles. Same sex relationships are not something that puzzle magical folk, meaning that she hardly could have been blushing because of shame...unless Fleur has a thing against muggle-born witches, which Hermione highly doubts. “I think you’re reading far too much into this.”</p>
<p>“Hermione, let me have my fun,” Ginny groans, flopping backward on the bed.</p>
<p>“Not if it’s at my expense.” Hermione freezes as she hears footsteps outside the bedroom. Ginny shoots up into a sitting position and grins at her. “Oh shove off,” she mutters.</p>
<p>There is a quiet knock on the door and the lilting tones of Fleur’s voice, “Hermione? Are you in there?”</p>
<p>Hermione is shaking her head <em>no</em>, but Ginny calls out, “Come in!" </p>
<p>The door opens and Fleur is standing there. She glances between Hermione and Ginny, red still tingeing her cheeks. Ginny sidles off the bed, clearly ignoring the look that Hermione gave her. “I remembered I left my arithmancy book downstairs. I’ll be right back.” She steps around Fleur and disappears down the hall.</p>
<p>Hermione stares adamantly at her feet. Her face feels hot, too hot. She is so blatantly red that there is no way Fleur cannot notice. As if she can read Hermione’s mind, she says, “You are blushing.”</p>
<p>“Well, it is a little embarrassing that I completely misconstrued your name when we were younger, and that I’ve gone nearly two years failing to recognize you.”</p>
<p>Fleur laughs and her stomach plummets. “I failed to recognize you as well, Hermione.”</p>
<p>She glances up at Fleur and sees her smiling. That smile only continues to twist her insides further into a knot. “There isn’t much to talk about. I mean, we knew one another. That’s all there is to say.” She catches sight of Fleur’s odd smile once again. “Isn’t it?” </p>
<p>“Would you do me the honor of walking with me?” Fleur asks, nodding toward the hallway.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Before she gives an answer, Hermione slides off the bed. She follows Fleur out into the hallway. “Sure.” They walk downstairs together and Fleur opens the back door, gesturing for her to go first. Hermione catches sight of Ginny hiding on the living room sofa, throw pillow stuffed into her mouth to stifle giggling. Hermione furrows her brow at her before turning and walking out into the backyard.</p>
<p>Fleur follows. “Let us walk the fields, yes?” She shuts the door behind them and gestures toward the tall, green grass growing just beyond the fence. They silently cross the yard and begin their walk. Hermione is scared to look at Fleur, so she watches her feet as they cut a path through the wispy grass. “You always intimidated me, you know that Hermione?”</p>
<p><em>My face. Why can’t I avoid being cherry red? Oh goodness, my face.</em> Hermione clears her throat. “You were a Triwizard Champion, Fleur. I can hardly imagine myself as an intimidating figure next to that.”</p>
<p>Fleur laughs and shakes her head. “You had more brains than all four of us did put together. You still do. You know so much, and you never are shy about letting people know so. I cannot help but feel that you will run this country, one day. You are too clever not to.”</p>
<p>Hermione snorts. “Politics is for idiots,” she says, perhaps a little more derisively than she intends. She cannot help it. Cornelius Fudge’s antics have left a foul taste in her mouth.</p>
<p>“Why do you reason that?”</p>
<p>“If a system like the Ministry of Magic can be bent so easily to the whims of a madman like Cornelius Fudge, then I have little respect for it as an institution.” Hermione hesitates before continuing. “The short-sightedness and selfishness found in every one of our laws is deplorable. The Ministry is a wizard-centric organization that has no interest in serving the needs of magical beings outside of wizarding men and women.” Hermione clamps her mouth shut before she begins ranting about SPEW or werewolf rights. She is certain that Fleur probably does not want to hear about it. However, when she catches Fleur’s gaze, she does not see the familiar, wary look or any hint of mocking derisiveness.</p>
<p>“This is exactly what I mean, Hermione.” Fleur’s steely blue eyes lock with hers. “You don’t look at the world like other humans. You don’t see it as exclusively yours.”</p>
<p>Fleur’s features have hardened. Hermione is certain that there has been no physical shift, but the defining line of her cheekbones stand out more. Her nostrils flare, and for a moment, Hermione cannot identify where Fleur’s thoughts have gone. And then it dawns on her. “I forget your veela heritage, sometimes. Is there much discrimination?”</p>
<p>Fleur shrugs. “No one else would call it that.” They walk aimlessly through the field. Fleur gestures at no one in particular. “They laugh when we complain. <em>Is it so hard to be so beautiful?</em> they say. But it is difficult, especially when you receive nothing but unwanted advances. Any time I receive special attention or praise, I must question the motives behind it. I must question everyone who looks at me.” When Fleur says this, Hermione becomes very aware of how she is staring and looks away. “But Hermione, you have never looked at me that way. Not when we were younger. Not when I came to Hogwarts, and not this summer.” Her voice does not carry any tone of triumph or satisfaction from this statement. It is merely Fleur relaying facts. “You look at me like I am a person.”</p>
<p>Hermione, at a loss to do anything else, says, “You are a person, Fleur. You deserve to be treated as such.”</p>
