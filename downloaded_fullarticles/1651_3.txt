  <em> Draco </em>
</p><p> </p><p>My breaths rushed past the inner cage of my ribs and whooshed out of my convulsing throat, the erratic, somewhat anxiety ridden pace of my heart beat ricocheting within its rhythmic sound in the hollow thrum of my ears, loud and obnoxious in its noise as the soles of my feet slapped against the pristine, linoleum floor. The ground was washed in the brilliantly ominous lighting of the opal shaded moon peering into the large floor to ceiling windows that encased the long corridor connecting all of Hogwarts rooms together, stretching for miles on end.</p><p>
  <em> Fuckfuckfuck! </em>
</p><p>“Ready or not, here we come!” The disgruntled, deep baritone of a familiar voice, specifically Jacob from Ravenclaw, echoed throughout the whole of the deadly quiet of the large red wood hallway.</p><p>My body jolted on the spot as my heart slammed double its pace beneath my rib cage.</p><p>
  <em> Find a spot to hide, Draco! </em>
</p><p>My mind screamed at me to run towards the end of the hall and into one of the old chambers in the school, having sneaked around enough as a child in this academy to know a few secret hidden places. But with the house of Ravenclaw declaring their presence for hunting down the rest of the other houses who were most likely in hiding themselves, I was out of time to get to the chamber I needed to hideaway in.</p><p>Pansy just had to convince me to participate in this morbid fucking game of hide and seek. I wouldn’t be in this mess if I wasn’t so damn prideful in winning a years worth of Ravenclaw’s endless collection of food they so happen to stash in their refrigerators that the school never served.</p><p>I wanted those damn desserts that the dining hall members wouldn’t give away for their own selfish reasons in keeping them for themselves.</p><p>The bastards!</p><p>And despite us Slytherins being declared as one of the most cruel houses in Hogwarts, Ravenclaw gave it a run for its money along with the Gryffindor house. The Ravenclaw’s liked playing games that made others feel small and rather stupid for their own amusement because they thought they were the most intelligent beings on the damn planet and wanted to watch those mentally below them grovel. And I couldn’t blame them.</p><p>Slytherins were just as bad.</p><p>But at the given moment, I was very much wishing that I hadn’t decided to participate in this competition.</p><p>The last one who would be found, will win all the food for a year and be supplied more throughout the given twelve months if they ran out of what the person is given in compensation. The game started when lights were out throughout Hogwarts, so it was around ten fifteen at night without any professors or wizarding administrators wandering the halls at this time. Ravenclaw made sure they weren’t involved.</p><p>The shit I did for sweets and other food delicacies amazed me.</p><p>And it seems that others were in the same boat when it came to food that Hogwarts didn’t serve to its students.</p><p>And I’m a Malfoy.</p><p>I have to win.</p><p>Despite everyone giving me the cold shoulder ever since I returned to finish my Eighth year and graduate because of the Dark Lord and my disgusting association with him, I still held my head high and did what I needed to do to keep thriving if given a chance. And I was given it by none other than Harry Potter when he arrived at mine and my mother’s court hearing after the war and deemed me none guilty in being forced to cooperate with Voldemort.</p><p>My mother was sent to Azkaban along with my father and Snape.</p><p>And I was left to stay with my very much alive cousin, Sirius.</p><p>The administrators allowed me to go back to Hogwarts so I could finish my newt exams, graduate, and create a potential normal life for myself outside in the wizarding world, despite having to be hated by all.</p><p>But I took my second chance at life, although with shaking hands.</p><p>And I still had a name to uphold and replenish for the sake of my family even when my father and mother never took care of me or loved me like they should have. I wanted the Malfoy’s name to still thrive because the family members before my parents didn’t deserve all their hard work into the family name to waste away like nothing.</p><p>I snapped out of my thoughts when I pushed myself into the nearest door that was left slightly ajar to my right, rushing into the dark room with a fervor of gasps leaving the moist part of my mouth as the hot sticky sweat of my flesh stuck to my Slytherin acquired buttoned up blouse and black slacks. The disarray of the pale, messy silver, almost cream white colored strands of my hair swept across the planes of my forehead and slightly over the watered down, smokey gray slate of my eyes, the color bright and eerie with how blind it made me look and resembling that of a moonstone or a snowflake's brightened shimmer from the suns ray's hitting its crystalline hue. The action of my hair caused my hands to flick up and push the blonde tufts away from my peripheral view as I stared wide eyed out into the shadowed abyss in front of me and strained to hear any sound of movement that could give away any sign of another wizard or muggle hiding away in this dark room.</p><p>But I couldn’t hear jack shite with the pounding of my heart ringing like a high pitch buzz in the solace of my ears, thrumming loud over the stream of my frantic thoughts as I tried to catch my breath from having practically ran down the hallways of Hogwarts within at least a good thirty minutes, going from one end of the huge building to the next.</p><p>I swore inwardly at myself, having not changed out of my school uniform right before this stupid game started. I didn’t want to wear the regular clothes I wore when I wasn’t in the presence of my school mates. My clothes were too casual and with the way people treated me horribly here, they wouldn’t think twice to make fun of the outfits I wore when out of school uniform. And the clothes I had now did good to show off the delicate curves my slim and small figure catered to, fitting around the perk of my bubbly yet perky arse and the almost dainty frame my body held. I didn’t want to bring more attention to how fragile and feminine I looked. The unblemished milky expanse of my flesh seemed almost translucent and elf like with how pale and unmarked I was.</p><p>Students already made crude comments about my body.</p><p>Although most of the time I ignored them, it didn’t help to veer away the insecurities I held when it came to the shape and form of my person.</p><p>But I did my best to not let the student’s demeaning comments get to me, although it hurt at times. Even when I was made out to be this cold, slytherin prince, I was rather immensely emotional. I was just good at hiding said emotions with a mask made up of sneers or bitch like facial expressions.</p><p>Trying to calm the erratic breathing that kept escaping the purse of my lips, I made my way blindly through the cool dark of the room, my hands floating to the bottom hem of my blouse as I subconsciously fiddled with the end fabric between the tittering of my fingers.</p><p>This room would have to do.</p><p>It was so damn dark in here, and unnveringly quiet that I could just sit in the dark corner of the wall and wait out the entirety of the game. I was almost at the very end of the building where the game had started at the opposite side. It would take a while to find me, and hopefully, I would be the last of them.</p><p>In the breezy spring warm air that flooded the rooms and towers of Hogwarts, I sharply inhaled in hopes of scenting the beginnings of flowering plants of all varieties that usually spilled throughout the entirety of the academy during this season, but instead, something else hit my senses all at once.</p><p>My body went rigid on the spot, the line of my spine growing hard as all the air seemed to have seized in my lungs. The nervous movements of my fingers playing with my blouse came to a screeching halt as I stood perfectly still, holding in the burning oxygen I took a gulp of in my fit of shocked strain.</p><p>It was <em> him. </em></p><p>The very strong musky scent of a fire withering away during the midst of a winter’s solstice and the beginning of a hot august night fornicating with the enticing smell of fresh new pines invaded the whole of my body, sinking into my heated flesh like an inevitable parasitic drug that made my body sway on its own two feet.</p><p>This particular scent came from one man.</p><p>Weasley.</p><p>And then that damning voice of his broke through the paralyzed silence of the room, tension snapping in the suddenly suffocating, heavy air that surrounded us both, the tone running over the slick of my skin like red velvet cake spreading and melting into the desperate expanse of my tongue, roughened and low in the almost calm, deep monotonous drawl Ron emitted. “I see you, Malfoy.”</p><p>The indefinite sound of my teeth grinding against one another in the wake of my panicked, annoyingly thrilled state now were loud in the stillness of the sound that followed after Ron’s deceptively indifferent voice filtering through the whole of the room.</p><p>I couldn’t see the damn redhead.</p><p>And the sudden dipping sensation bubbling in the depth of my gut had my mouth popping open without my say so, causing the slippery wet sound of a <em> pop! </em>to release from the caverns of my lips, the infuriating instinct to run far away from the man inside this room as well as hissing and raising my damn hackles like a fucking cat in distraught was almost blinding in its want.</p><p>I winced at the loud sound my mouth caused, a shiver racing over my flesh as I internally banged my head against a cemented wall at the crude sound I just made, filthy as it was although with no intention of it to be so.</p><p>“I should go.” I whispered my words out loud, barely audible to the regular human ear as I softly spoke out in the all consuming dark of the room.</p><p>Ronald Weasley was trouble.</p><p>Ever since coming back this year, Ron had been an intimidating force that I tried to stay clear of.</p><p>The redhead had become more brutally cold than he ever was.</p><p>And he grew into himself well.</p><p>Harsh.</p><p>Absurdly sexy and insanely gorgeous.</p><p>And he treated me like shite.</p><p>Mean and callous, this guy had become.</p><p>And despite seething hateful words his way whenever he decided to be the most notorious bastard in this whole bloody world, the guy didn’t even flinch away from my venomous mouth.</p><p>And not once have we been alone in a room together.</p><p>Our encounters with each other were always in the dining hall or classes that we had with each other.</p><p>He’s made me feel out of my own skin, itching and wanting to crawl from my own body to get away from him.</p><p>
  <em> Oh, but you look for him everywhere. </em>
</p><p>He enraged me.</p><p>And scared the holy shite out of me.</p><p>Taking a tentative step back, I let the breath I had been holding for a good minute or so, fall from the trembling of my mouth, air whooshing from my chest as I flexed the quivering of my fingers open and closed to put some sort of sensation in the abrupt numbing of my limbs.</p><p>
  <em> Calm down, Draco. </em>
</p><p>I didn’t want to start a fight.</p><p>Not when I was completely in the dark, alone in a room with just Ron that probably was using his own magic to see in the Stygian of the area around him while I had no magic on my person whatsoever.</p><p>I was defenseless.</p><p>And with the way Ron looks at me like I was the pesky little bug squashed beneath his boot, I didn’t want to know what he’d likely do to me when we were alone together.</p><p>I needed to get out of here.</p><p>
  <em> But you don’t want to. You take excitement in the terror he induces inside you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Fucking dirty slut. </em>
</p><p>I shook the barraging thoughts bouncing off against the walls inside my head frantically, choosing to disregard the quick influx of such inappropriate impressions, my breaths quickening by each passing second as I stood in the dark of the room with my heart threatening to jump out of my throat.</p><p>Usually, in the light and with people around, I was more confident in my way to be upfront with Ron, but now that I was forced to be alone with the damn Gryffindor with no witnesses whatsoever, all my fears of what the guy could say or do to me ran rampant through my head and quiet literally terrified me while at the same time, shamefully had heat zipping down into the space of my groin.</p><p>
  <em> What’s wrong with you! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Stop getting turned on by the fucking Weasel, Draco! </em>
</p><p>Fuck the damn hide and seek game.</p><p>I was better off in the safety of my room. Away from Ron and preventing my body from bursting into flames in front of the guy.</p><p>
  <em> Stop thinking about how your body reacts to the redhead. </em>
</p><p>Blinking rapidly, I decided that I needed to run for it.</p><p>I could care less about the game now.</p><p>Turning on the heel of my foot, I whipped my body around, bending my knees to start off of my soles with a bounce so I could start sprinting on the fuck out of the room, but as I turned on my heel, I felt the front of my torso slam against a hard brick wall.</p><p>I squeaked out loud, the sound foreign to my ears, high and frantic as I staggered back in surprise, stumbling about while I tried to get my balance back into my stance as a burst of fluorescent lighting spilled throughout the whole room.</p><p>The quick splash of light elicited my eyes to squint against its brightness, vision turning into spots of burning white and pitch black before clearing away enough for my gaze to settle on the fucking wall that I ran into.</p><p>Except it wasn’t a wall.</p><p>It was Ron.</p><p>I couldn’t help the way my eyes widened like I was some deer caught in the headlights, my body recoiling as I leaned back away from the towering, predatory figure looming over me, the furnace of Ron’s body radiating like the orange glow of a summer’s sun, burning my flesh without no touch with the breadth of air splitting the two of our bodies apart.</p><p>My chest heaved up and down as I stared up at Ron in appalled confrontation.</p><p>This was unfair.</p><p>The man had no right to be looking the way he did with the way he treated me.</p><p>Ron was tall, coming a few scant centimeters above six feet and four inches, body lean and muscular like a professional boxer, the chords of his muscles contracting and relaxing beneath the short sleeve of his black T-Shirt. The veins in his arms were prominent, the lines of his biceps and triceps defined as well as his forearms. His thighs were powerful, the long of his legs strong under the fitted dark of his blue jeans that slung low off the sharp of his hip bones, showing a peak of the Adonis white smooth skin of his flesh as well as the narrow V slope of his hips.</p><p>And the redhead had tattoos everywhere, etched all over the smooth of his flesh, intricate black ink designed in different curves and curls, angling towards one another and connecting to each other in an endless scrawl of engravings of sorts, creating intimidating images, dark and foreboding and personal.</p><p>Ron’s hair was the color of auburn with shades of amber hazel highlights that gleamed beneath the lights spilling over us. The disheveled locks looked silky and smooth to the touch, cut short above his head and long at the top. The tousled strands of his hair fell over to the right side of his head, the tips of the red locks licking away the fringes of the skin of his smooth forehead, as if he’d just finished having a round of rough sex.</p><p>His jawline was strong, and cheekbones sharp with a set of provocative lips.</p><p>And those damn eyes of his were the embodiment of mesmerizing and violent.</p><p>The man’s eyes were made up of cobalt blue, electric like with the colors of Sapphire and a stormy Azure that reminded me of the coldest depths of hell itself, raging and silent and frigid. Wisps of Caribbean mingled about in the array of illuminating blues that Ron’s gaze held, like the darkest of waves crashing against towering spikes of rocks. Powerful and dangerous.</p><p>Ron was unpredictable.</p><p>No one knew what the man was thinking, his attitude ranging from hot and cold and in between. One second he would be brutally silent and assessing without a hint of emotion coveting his striking face and the next he’d be pummeling his fists into someone until they bled out and was led to the hospital, snarling and malicious intent spewing out of his body like a feral wild animal.</p><p>People stayed clear of him.</p><p>Harry and Hermione were the only ones allowed close to him. But even then, he seemed to stray and was rarely seen hanging around anyone anymore. But he did have occasional guy friends that he’d be seen talking to for a brief moment before he ditched them.</p><p>But he also seemed to have an appetite for sex. For both female and male and in between. He fucked everything.</p><p>A none stop sex machine.</p><p>Even though people were scared of him, they were intrigued because he was just so damn breathtakingly sexy and strikingly beautiful.</p><p>He had everyone wanting to writhe beneath the beast of a man.</p><p>Ron was like a terrifying Irish Viking.</p><p>“But it’s the first time we’re alone together. Don’t tell me all that snarky attitude you have around an audience goes away the moment you’re left defenseless?” Ron’s voice gave away a low timbre, mocking in the vibrato of his tone that shook within my chest.</p><p>I still had my Malfoy bravado intact and so despite the fear coating every blood cell in my veins, I couldn’t help but give into the need to show myself strong and fearless, the need overruling any logical thought in my head even though I know I should walk away from Ron before I would find myself in a fight with him because of my stupid pride.</p><p>I would not show how weakened in the knees and mentality I was in the face of Ronald fucking Weasley.</p><p>My mouth was running its course before I could even begin to think about what I was saying. “What makes you think I’m powerless? The only reason I’m leaving this room is so we don’t start a fight and end up suspended.” I hissed out my words up at the redhead, mouth curling up slightly to reveal a subtle sneer as I felt my breaths rapidly picking up speed even more so than it already was at.</p><p>Ron tilted his head, the slow motion of his action letting the tendrils of his air sweep over his forehead enticingly as he watched me with a stare that rendered me still, piercing and pinning me to the spot as I tried not to shriek out in frustration at the situation I was in.</p><p>Why the hell was Ron in this room anyway?</p><p>“We both know that you’re too fucking prim and proper to get into a fight with me. Your delicate princess hands would break if I so much as touched them.” Ron voiced his words in a low thunderous murmur, seeming to crowd in on my space as he neared me the slightest of a bit, causing my head to tilt back and my hair to brush against the sides of my temples in a fluttering motion as I watched Ron beneath the pale of my lashes.</p><p>The close proximity made a dizzy spell erupt in my head, heat filling up my cock as blood rushed south in a mortifyingly fast manner, my hands trembling with anticipation and trepidation all at once as I stood my ground while Ron’s impassive face stared down at me.</p><p>
  <em> Breath, Draco. Breathe. </em>
</p><p>“Stop calling me that.” I gritted my words out, anger at myself for the way my body reacted to the redhead before me and at Ron for saying such demeaning words to my person. I could feel the irritation brewing within my limbs at a fast rate, my temper always having the short end of a stick whenever I felt pressured, stressed, or offended.</p><p>“Did I hit a nerve? You have to have noticed that you look weak and pathetic with that body of yours. No wonder no one wants to get into your pants, Malfoy.” Ron’s tone was pitched low in a harsh taunt, the illuminate glow of his blue eyes reminding me of the glacier storms in Alaska, without mercy and severe.</p><p>“Oh and what makes you think that I ever cared about your opinion of me? I don’t care for a redheaded starburst who walks around like he’s got constipation every day of his waste of a life.” I raised my eyebrows up at Ron, feeling the tremor in my hands shake as my nerves grew tenfold, the haughty snap of my words slicing through the air like a gutted fish cut with the sharpest point of a knife.</p><p>Ron simply stared back at me in silence, but the air seemingly got thicker, a raw substance that made the air around me pressurize as my throat worked overtime to swallow in any sort of moisture in the suddenly dry atmosphere around us.</p><p>That’s when I saw the minute tick of Ron’s jaw, tense as the muscles tightened there in an avid ferocity that seemed to make everything around us drop about ten degrees, my chest constricting as I faltered back a step, my body doing so without my permission.</p><p>And Ron caught the flash of anxiety ridden heat that morphed my usually properly poised face with the way his eyes scanned my said action with intense focus but only for a millisecond before I schooled my features back into a look of nonchalance.</p><p>I was too late though.</p><p>The Gryffindor saw me falter.</p><p>And he had to poke fun at me for it.</p><p>“We both know you act all high and mighty when in reality you’re a little boy just starving for any ounce of affection that your mentally fucked parents never gave you. Or maybe you act like this because rumor says your father’s fucked you good and hard and whenever you’re away from him, you get all wet and needy for your precious father’s cock so you get all sorts of bitchy when  Lucius isn’t around to turn you into the slut that you really are.” Ron’s words came out in an octave lower, dropping to an almost demonic tone that caused the heat to shift into a scorching path straight to my cock and my blood to boil then, my head spinning with the impending rage and fire that coveted my field of vision.</p><p>And that’s when I snapped.</p><p>The fear I had of Ron didn’t compare to the anger and shame and weakness he induced inside of me.</p><p>I didn’t think twice.</p><p>My fist stuck out, the curve of my fingers bent into the palm of my hand while my nails dug into the flesh there with a stinging prick. My vision became a mass of clashing colors as I glared through a narrow slit of my eyes that dared to hold back the agitated, hurt tears that threatened to flood my eyes, my throat burning with the effort to hold back my scream of vexation.</p><p>I felt my knuckles brush air as I tried to strike at the Gryffindor’s irritating face, a hiss of vehemence leaving my mouth as I snapped my teeth together, hard and clacking like, when I felt myself being easily lifted up by the sides of my torso like a fucking feather.</p><p>With a whipping motion, I watched Ron’s face contort into a sharp grin made up of viciously heated sinister intent in dawning horror as I felt my back slam against the wooden floorboard of the vacant room we resided in, Ron’s eyes taking on a disturbed pulsating cobalt.</p><p>And I yelped out.</p><p>The pain sliding up my spine jarred my vision, my peripheral view a blur as I somewhat spazzed across the floor at the harsh impact of my back having been practically slammed into the damn ground.</p><p>All air wheezed passed my mouth as my mouth dropped open to emit a moan of pain, ache tingling along my back like sparks biting at my flesh as if immature pincher bugs crawled all around me.</p><p>I bowed my back across the floor, the tip of my head touching the ground as I felt my hair sprawl across the polished surface, my eyes huge as I spluttered and hiccuped about, trying to catch my breath while my vision cleared.</p><p>I tasted the tangy, copper rush of my own warm blood flood the gape of my mouth, the red liquid trickling over the sides of my lips. The stench of it mixed together with Ron’s scent as he leaned over me, crouching at his knees with a slow descent, all calm and observant as his gaze shifted down the length of my hurt body.</p><p>That wasn’t a normal strength for any human, muggle or wizard.</p><p>Ron placed his forearms over his bent knees, watching me with that same infuriatingly calm demeanor, mocking me as I laid there gasping in pain, the muscles in his forearms contracting beneath the wicked draw of his tattoos. Terror driven and massive in his predatory state.</p><p>But what was worse was the fact that my prick was hard against the zipper of my slacks, my breaths coming out fast as my heart rammed itself against my chest and heat flooded my cheeks at noticing the way Ron’s cool gaze slipped down my torso unnervingly slowly and stopped specifically at my imminent boner.</p><p>“Now what do we have-” I disrupted Ron’s low drawl of a statement with a snarl of my own, somewhat quaking in its angered embarrassment while I discarded the blood dripping now from both my nose and mouth as I pushed myself up in a springing action from the ache of my elbows, pushing my front against Ron’s knelt figure with a hard drop, taking the redhead down with me.</p><p>I heard an unmistakable grunt leave Ron’s lips as I straddled his waist, feeling the heat of his body burning mine up as I felt our bodies slip against one another. I settled my arse back against his groin, finding myself arching my back and gasping out at the way a burning heat clouded over my frame that came from the Gryffindor's body.</p><p>But before I could get lost in the sensation of the redhead’s warmth, presence, and smell, I forced my arm back in quick succession to form a straight flat palm that shown the not so short jut of my nails above my head before slapping the right side of Ron’s chiseled cheek as I brought my hand down.</p><p>I felt the rumble of his growl cascade down my front, caressing over the hard of my prick as I let my nails scratch down the skin above Ron’s right eye and over the top of his cheekbone, my frantic eyes taking in the way blood bubbled out of the deep rooted scratch. Droplets of scarlet red oozed out of Ron’s raw scarred pores, something magnetizing in the way the tousled locks of Ron’s auburn hair splayed out across the wood of the floor and the way the chords of his muscles bulged and strained with the heavy, tiniest ragged of breaths leaving his mouth.</p><p>The azure hell of his eyes drowned me then into the darkest depths of the ocean as he moved too quick for my own eyes to catch.</p><p>In one rushed pace, I felt Ron shift up into a sitting position, my thighs spreading wide over his groin as he forcefully had me leaning back away from the sudden press of our torsos together, his face a few mere centimeters from my own as our breaths mingled together. That damning scent of his consumed me whole, the way the hard of his abs rubbed against my front enticing a shudder to wreck my frame. The inner slope of my thighs felt sensitive and hot at the feel of Ron's hard body parting them.</p><p>“Wh-what-” I let out a startled squeak when I felt the unmistakable heat of Ron’s long, rough fingers drag through the strands of my blonde tufts at the back of my head and grip them in a tight vice to yank my head back with a harah pull, my jaw dropping open as I was forced to meet Ron’s dark midnight blue gaze, pain prickling down my scalp while his other large hand drew itself around the small of my back and dragged me bodily up his groin with an easy tug.</p><p>I couldn’t help the keening breathy whimper that broke free from the slack of my jaw at the way the bottom of my balls and cock created a delicious friction against Ron’s hard navel, a tremble that shook me to its core from the heat and intoxicating scent that the Gryffindor carried around with him like the fucking devil himself.</p><p>My eyes were caught beneath Ron’s indifferent gaze, cold and harsh when he pulled my hair back further, exposing the long line of my throat with its bobbing Adam’s apple and my eyes wincing at the dull ache of my hairs practically hanging onto my scalp with scant strength, causing my bottom half to wriggle about in dismayed arousal while my breaths came out hard and my skin rose with fear induced want.</p><p>The cobalt in Ron’s eyes grew into a wicked melted bright metallic blue, burning holes into my wide eyed gaze as I watched crimson drip from the wound I created over his eye and cheek, my own blood dripping down the divot of my lip, to the sides of my mouth, and out of both my nostrils.</p><p>I was a fucking mess.</p><p>And I was mad. And horny.</p><p>Which I bloody welI shouldn’t be!</p><p>Ronald Weasley was a bastard! I knew I bullied him when we were younger but he was taking things too far. Beating me, insulting me … this man was mean. And I wanted to hit and scream at him while my body wanted him to fuck into me-</p><p>
  <em> Stop it! Stopitstopit! </em>
</p><p>“You don’t interest me, Malfoy. Not one fucking bit. I’d never fuck you. So get over yourself and put your hardened prick away because you’re a waste of <em>my</em> space.” Ron murmured his words into my face, his expression devoid of any emotion as he drew those low words out of his mouth with no care in the world.</p><p>I felt cold air encase my body then, Ron having pushed me off with a simple flick of his damn wrist like I was some rag doll, my arse bouncing over the floor and making me cringe at the pain that still tingled in my spine and tailbone from Ron slamming me into the ground as if I weighed like nothing.</p><p>And right when I hit the floor again, with Ron already standing on steady feet, a Ravenclaw student came bursting into the room, yelling out his victorious find but at the same time letting his enthusiasm die down when he caught sight of my bloodied face and the Gryffindor’s too.</p><p>Ron simply walked out without another word, not once looking back at me as I sat on the floor with small tremors raking my body and my mind closing off Pansy’s frantic concerns as the Ravenclaw student called for someone to help me up because the prick didn't want to associate himself with an ex death eater like myself.</p><p>I wanted to crawl into the nearest hole and stay there.</p><p>This night was a fucking wreck.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
