    <p>Violet sighed happily as she twirled the stem of a poppy between her fingers, as she walked through the tall grass of the field. Next to her, George carried the folded up blanket and empty basket in his hands, a dreamy smile on his face. The sun had started to set, putting an end to a hot and sticky day. Both sunburnt and sweaty, they managed to make the half a mile walk down the road from the fields. </p><p>"So, do we tell everyone?" Violet asked, as they walked. "Or should we wait until later?" </p><p>"Well, I'm pretty sure Fred knows," George shrugged. "And I think Ginny and Hermione know. Girls have a way of wearing their feelings on their faces." </p><p>She gasped in mock outrage, as George took her hand into his. "We do not!" she cried, as he chuckled. </p><p>"I think we should tell them before we head back to Hogwarts," he shrugged. "Though.. Mum might start planning our wedding and future grandchildren." </p><p>"Already?" Violet frowned. "I mean.. we haven't even gone on a date, George." </p><p>In the distance, the Burrow appeared; a welcoming beacon of love and security. It had been Violet's favorite place, other than Hogwarts, to be in. Her summer's and holidays were spent there, a twin bed propped up in Ginny's cramped room. She even had a place on Molly's clock, as the mother of seven worried about her wellbeing all throughout the year. </p><p>"I guess we could tell them before school starts again," Violet shrugged. "Professor McGonagall's going to be quite happy, I think!" </p><p>Reaching the gate, George unlatched it and held the door open for her, giving Violet room to pass by. "Why is she going to be quite happy?" he frowned, as Violet waited for him to lock up. "Did you tell her about your desire to be my girlfriend?" </p><p>She giggled, "Professor McGonagall's been family to me for years, George," she reminded him, taking his hand again. "And while she believes that we must all take our education seriously, she does have a soft spot for romance. Besides, she's always said that you're very lucky to have me in your life. Otherwise... you'd be flunking all of your classes, including Transfiguration, without my guidance." </p><p>George had to roll his eyes at that one, "I'll have you know, that I'm exceptionally good at Transfiguration. And Charms. And Defense Against the Dark Arts." </p><p>"Yet, you bombed ever other O.W.L we had to take," Violet reminded him. </p><p>"Does it bother you that much that I've only gotten three O.W.L's?" George asked, as they stopped on the road. </p><p>Violet shook her head, "I don't expect you to become an employee of the Ministry, George" she said. "You and Fred want to open your shop. That's what you're passionate about, George. You have a creative mind and you want to share that with the world. And I'd love you if you had all your O.W.Ls with passing marks or none at all." </p><p>He grinned, "Mum's going to be so happy that you're going to spend the rest of your life with me," he said, making Violet laugh. </p><p>"We've only said "I love you," to each other a handful of times today, for the first time," she reminded him. "I've only agreed to be your girlfriend at the moment. We can talk about marriage once we graduate next spring." </p><p>Giving he a quick kiss, they both rushed down the remainder of the road, darting around the back of the Burrow towards the kitchen. Laughing, they both tumbled into the house, only to find it in chaos. </p><p>"What's going on?" Violet asked, as things went to a fro from the cabinets. "Are we having company?" </p><p>"We're leaving," Ginny grumbled, as Molly sent pots and pans over to a chest. "Tomorrow morning." </p><p>George set the basket down on the chair, along with the blanket. "Leaving?" he asked, as Ginny nodded. "Mum, what's going on?" </p><p>Molly set the knife on the counter to chop the potatoes, "We're going to Grimmauld place tomorrow morning," she announced. "Violet, be a dear and bring the clothes in from the line. I expect you to have your things packed and your trunk with the others before bed." </p><p>"I-I'm going with you?" she asked, as Molly checked on the stew. </p><p>"Well of course, my dear!" Molly laughed. "Can't leave you all on your own! Besides, Sirius is looking forward to seeing you! He's heard all about you and Hermione! Minvera spoke highly of you both!" </p><p>From upstairs, they heard a crash followed by shouting. "Boys!" Molly huffed, shaking her head. "Georgie, can you go on up and see what that's all about?" </p><p>Giving Violet a sheepish grin, he quickly made his way out of the kitchen, his footsteps pounding on the staircase. Setting the poppy flower down on the shelf near the backdoor, Violet grabbed the empty wicker basket and headed outside to collect the freshly laundered clothes. Tugging down the sheets, Violet dropped the clothespins into the basket, before folding them. As she worked, Violet tried to think of any positive reason why Professor McGonagall would talk about her to Sirius Black. She'd never met the man, whom Hermione and Harry helped escape during their third year. All she knew was that he was Harry's godfather, accused of a crime he did not commit and currently in hiding. </p><p>Once everything was in the basket, Violet brought it back into the house, placing it down on the chair. "So, how long are we staying at Grimmauld Place, Mrs. Weasley?" </p><p>"The remainder of the summer," Molly nodded. "Now, don't worry Violet. While it may not be as cozy as the Burrow, it will be safe." </p><p>Violet frowned, "Safe?" she asked. "Are we in danger here?" </p><p>Molly shook her head, "No, dear," she said, placing her hand on her arm. "Just... don't worry too much about it, alright? Now, go on and pack up your trunk. Make sure you bring all of your books! Arthur and I won't be back until after you lot are off at Hogwarts." </p><p>Nodding, Violet made her way across the kitchen and into Ginny's room. Pulling the clothes off the trunk against the wall, Violet heaved it up and onto her bed, unlatching the top. On the bed across from her's, Ginny's trunk laid open with clothes and miscellaneous items spilled about. Based on that alone, Violet knew this was a last minute announcement; no one was prepared to spend the remainder of their summer break, away from home. </p><p>As she packed up her clothes, a majority of them being for the winter, the door was pushed open and George stood in the doorway. </p><p>"Dad, Fred and I are going out for a bit," he said, as she set a pair of boots into the trunk. "Do you want anything? Sweets from the shop?" </p><p>"Whatever you get for yourself is fine," she said, giving him a small smile. "Though, nothing that will turn my mouth black or given me a spontaneous nosebleed." </p><p>He chuckled, "I promise," he nodded. "Oh, Fred and I need some help smuggling a few things to Grimmauld place and then Hogwarts. Ginny's offered to carry some stuff, as did Ron..." </p><p>She sighed, "And you want me to smuggle as well?" she asked, as he smiled sheepishly. "Fine. But it better not explode and destroy all my things, George."</p><p>"I'll bring some stuff down after dinner," he said, tapping his hand against the doorframe. "Make sure you pack up your stash of sweets! And don't tell Ron that you're bringing them this time!" </p><p>"Go!" Violet laughed, waving her hands at him. "Before you get stuck doing chores, instead of heading into Diagon Alley to get my sweets!" </p><p>As he rushed off, Arthur and Fred waiting at the door for him, Violet shouted out for Ginny. "Hermione's here!" Ginny yelled, as a roar came from the fireplace. "Hermione, you have to help us pack! Violet's going to overpack, yet again!" </p><p>As the younger girls chatted, Hermione stopping to answer a few of Molly's questions about her summer so far, Violet went to work folding and packing her trunk and her duffle bag. All the while, as she moved back and forth from the dresser and the closet, she smiled. </p>
