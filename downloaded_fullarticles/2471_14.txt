  <strong>PART THE FIRST</strong>
</p><p align="CENTER">***</p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Do you believe in reincarnation, Kacchan?”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In Eastern belief, for sworn brothers and sisters it is far more preferable to die on the same day, the same month, the same year, than being so born. Midoriya Izuku and Bakugou Katsuki perished within minutes of each other – though their passings were not natural or peaceful in the least.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In Eastern belief, those who owed one another enough in one life would be reborn as family in the next, because life might fade and wealth might expire but debts do not. Midoriya Izuku and Bakugou Katsuki owed each other aplenty – though who owed whom was a matter for debate still.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In Eastern belief, there are bonds that transpire life and death, stronger than nuclear fusion, more mysterious than quantum physics. Midoriya Izuku and Bakugou Katsuki shared bonds – though be it of friendship, love or hatred remains unclear and not at all mutually exclusive.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">All told, it would be more of a surprise if Midoriya Izuku and Bakugou Katsuki had not gotten another chance together.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“If we ever get reincarnated... I would want to be childhood friends again.”</p><p align="CENTER">***</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Harry Potter was born on a stormy evening, and there was a thunderclap like an explosion as he cried his first. Those first thin wisps on his mostly hairless head were neither black like his father's, nor red like his mother's, but white blond and took a lot of effort to make to stand down. Soon his hair was to grow out of control, which his father and godfather found amusing and his mother not quite so. "Stubborn as Daddy," said his godfather, trying futilely for the umpteenth time to keep the wee lad's hair down.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Dudley Dursley was born on a normal day, and his birth brought great joy to his mother because he was a normal boy all told. Normal, well, except for the fact that he had left his mother's womb with a right abnormal amount of hair, pastel-green and unruly. Soon blond dye became such an integral part of the family expenditure the Dursley could not recall a time they'd lived without at least one bottle stocked in the cupboard at all time. The very best kind money could buy, too; people could fault Vernon Dursley for a lot of things, but sparing expenses on his little tyke wasn't one of them.</p><p align="CENTER">***</p><p align="JUSTIFY">When Harry came to Dudley Dursley's doorstep in a basket, Dudley was sleeping. Harry's world had included an old man who had lived too long, done too much, made too many mistakes, and Dudley was sleeping. Harry had flown before he could walk, by a bespelled motorcycle twice and once by broom, both in the dead of night, and Dudley was sleeping. Harry had been in a war and had the scar to show, and Dudley was sleeping.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">But Dudley was a dreamer, quite literally. He dreamt of excursions and secret bases, and a gang of childhood friends boasting about how great they would be as heroes. He dreamt of a bald doctor who said 'give it up' so callously. He dreamt of little drawings and little flowery scripts in little notebooks upon whose cover was written “Hero Analysis for the Future”. He dreamt of a man who might well be a giant, whose hair was like a lion's mane, who smiled all the time, who was so cool and never lost - “It's all right, for I am here!” that man would say, and Dudley would smile in his sleep.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In every universe Dudley was meant to be less handsome than Harry. Same in this world: he was a bit rounder and had a bit more puppy-fat than most. In every universe he had parents who would want him to balloon like plumpness was all it meant to be a good boy. In every other universe Dudley had thought nothing much about sharing, and all those calories had to go somewhere. In this universe Dudley shared. He shared his ice-cream with Harry, his cookies with Mrs. Figg down the street, and his birthdays was as likely to cause his friends' teeth to rot as it was not: this Dudley was a firm believer of the 'sweet brings happiness' theory.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In every universe Dudley was meant to be stronger than Harry. In this world, where he was neither rounder nor taller than Harry, and the messy raven's nest on his head was naturally green rather than blond, Dudley was still stronger than Harry. Once he kicked a football so high it vanished, and frightened himself for days. “What if it hits a plane and crashes it?” he asked, and Dad and Mum laughed because footballs couldn't shoot down airplanes (not without the right feet it wouldn't). There might not be magic in a wisp of blond hair once swallowed, but it was an inheritance, and inheritance often meant something. In this case it did.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In every universe Dudley had been dumb and dull. This Dudley existed to make up for all of the rest. He looked. He observed. He took notes. He mumbled alone about things that interested him. What he did not do, was flaunt his knowledge; because Dad wouldn't think very much of it. “Bah, eggheads,” he would say, and rap his huge thumb on his head and make a face. “Oooh, I so smart!”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">That did not mean Dudley had learnt nothing from Dad. Dad was a dreadfully dreary man, old-fashioned and boring, and cared more about golfing and jokes not supposed to be told in front of children than books and reasoning. Dad was also hardworking with a capital H.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In this world, there was no school of heroes to teach Dudley the words Plus Ultra. There was no television broadcast or Youtube videos of so many face-offs between heroes and villains, flashy and lethal in equal measures. There was no idol who laughed at burning buildings and say “It's all right! Why? Because I am here!” and rescue everyone who needed rescuing.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">What there was, was Dad.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Dad, who made himself a fortune and a place in society from a secondary school degree and pure force of will. Dad, who clawed his way from his coal-miner terraced house in Newcastle to a detached house in Surrey. Dad, who hurled himself at problems and jobs until they made him director of Grunnings so he could translate drills into a nice house and two cars and a boy who would never go without material wants. His hands might be huge and clumsy, his neck nonexistent and his etiquette far on the lacking side, but when he lifted Dudley to his shoulder and shoved Harry aside, it was Dudley that was chiefest of his concerns.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">(Dudley would think a lot, on those days the family went on holiday to squeaky-clean beaches not scrubbed by his own hands, how one could love so deeply and hate so much at the same time. He would find out many years down the line Dad and Mum weren't the exception.)</p><p align="JUSTIFY">But this is important: this Dudley did not think very much of bullies. There were nights he had woken up, sweaty and alone, amid unfamiliar voices and unfamiliar sneers, trapped between unfriendly crowds and a hard place, firework flashing red and yellow in his eyes. “Why don't you take a swan dive off the roof?” he had heard more than once in those dreams of his, along with a drawling laugh and the ridiculing eyes of a dozen boys. More than once, too, did he have a mind to tell Mum like every other child with a nightmare, but he didn't. Mum wouldn't understand or believe anyway.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Besides, dreaming of things that weren't true counted as 'freak' in the eyes of Dad and Mum.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Dad and Mum had told him so often stay away from the freak, and rarely called him anything but that. But Dudley knew better, because the word quirkless rang in his ears still, and the difference between the one and the other was mere semantic. If it was meant to hurt, to belittle, to put down, the actual word did not matter. Mere semantics, that's what it was, and Dudley knew this before he knew what semantics meant.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In every world, Dudley Dursley was afraid of his parents, and this one was no difference. So he sat still and hated himself more every time Mum looked at Harry the way a decent person might look at a dead rat: pest, filthy, you deserve everything that came to you. There was no sludge villain threatening to strangle the life out of Harry to be fought; no, that would be too easy. Instead there was constant scorn and neglect, and just the right amount of put-down to bend to the breaking point. Harry looked like he needed help, all the time, and most of those times Dudley only sat still and ate his bacon.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">A moment's courage before mortal danger was a tremendously admirable thing, but infinitely more admirable was constant, unshakable, unflinching conviction in the face of your own family's ill. That courage Dudley did not have – again, because it was infinitely easier to be brave and roaring with righteous fury before an enemy than before family.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">(One day he would say "Because you look like you need help" to someone in distress. Except it wasn't Harry.)</p><p align="CENTER">***</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In another world the boy who was Harry Potter would have been favored by fate in so many ways. In this, he learnt firsthand that life was not fair. It hadn't fair from the day he started looking around and calling the adults in his life 'Unca' and 'Auntie' rather than 'Dad' and 'Mum'. Being stuffed into a cupboard under the stairs, or being fed just enough not to starve, or being called names and treated like a freak and a burden upon the honest, well, that was only an extension of the lack of justice.<br/> Harry didn't cry. Harry didn't weep. Harry never showed the world Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's words or treatment had any impact on him.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">What Harry <em>did</em>, was be angry.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">This version of Harry had learnt to swear before he learnt to speak; to make sparks between his thumb and his palm before he could walk; to throw punches, to elbow and to kick shins long before he knew just because he <em>could </em>did not mean he <em>should.</em></p><p align="JUSTIFY">Despite himself Harry had never thought himself anything <em>but </em>special. He did not tell many about that, of course, less because of manners and humility and more out of self-preservation.<br/> He was the leader. He was the hero. He was the main character. He was the one who made his own hair grow back in a day. He warped from place to place when he needed a quick escape. He shrank a sweater he didn't like into a doll shirt and nobody was any wiser. He didn't know how he'd managed, but there he was.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">More importantly, he made things blow up just by rubbing his palm. This he treasured more than any material possession, and guarded more than his own life.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">You see, in every little boy and girl there is a tiny pyromaniac, and why would it be any other way? Fire and light had been the salvation of mankind, the torch in the endless night of the cosmos beyond. It is only later when a child knew fire could burn and explosions could destroy, that fascination turned into a healthy reverence.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Harry never learnt to fear fire, and explosions even less. They were bright and warm and noisy and didn't quite hurt him like it would others. The cupboard beneath the stairs offered little warmth and even less light, and diversion none at all; Harry would take what he could have.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">On those particularly hungry nights he burned the sweat in his palms into little firecrackers, like the little match girl in that old book by an even older Danish writer, and imagined himself something other than a little boy in a cupboard under the stairs. Like a hero who never lost, who wore his smile like a weapon, and imagined how amazing it would be to fight villains and never lost too.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">What Harry <em>did </em>fear was the consequence of them imposed so arbitrarily. Uncle Vernon loved his peaceful quiet and loved his baby-faced, blond-dyed Dudders so much more. Aunt Petunia hated everything that did not fit nicely into her housewife's ideal like a beauty pageant into a corset. What he feared, however, was not the scolding (because “<em>I can do better</em>”) or the expletives (because “<em>I can bloody do fucking better</em>”) or the very occasional, very mild violence (because “<em>I can blow this fucking house up</em>”), but the insinuation that he wasn't a hero.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Every such time Harry would fall silent and lick his wounds. Freaks could be heroes too, couldn't they? Why, wouldn't they make for even better heroes than the rest? After all, they were freaks, if they died saving a hundred in a burning building, nobody would mourn them. That would be a hell of a good way to go, wouldn't it?</p><p align="JUSTIFY">When Dudley dreamt, Harry dreamt too, through fitful sleeps curled in a thin blanket on a bed too hard: a flash of green and screams and a noseless serpentine man on some days, and a toothy grin and a voice that drawled “Die, Deku, die!” on others. The one was what could be done to him, the other, what <em>he </em>could do; and the latter frightened him quite a bit more than the former. On particularly rough winter nights he would wake up alone, and wondered how it would feel to drive someone to jump off the roof by words alone.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In this life Harry had not driven anyone to commit suicide yet. His voice, however, still had powers of its own. Like that one time he saw Dudley almost step on a snake, big and green and black all over. In fact it was just about to rear its head and bite his cousin when Harry raised his voice.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Next thing he knew, the snake was cowering. Harry thought it said something to the effect of “<em>My fang-felt apologies, my great lord!</em>” and backed off.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“How did you do that?” asked a wide-eyed Dudley, fear vanishing like the snake slithering away.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">“I told that shitstain to fuck the hell off or I'll stomp its head in! Splat, just like that!”</p><p align="JUSTIFY">(Years later Dudley would wonder if snakes understood expletives. Harry would clonk him upside the head. “Of course they do, don't be daft!” he would say, and shove another slice of treacle tart Dudley's way.)</p><p align="CENTER">***</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
