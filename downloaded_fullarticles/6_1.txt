    <p>Harry felt as if he were the only living thing in the world. He hadn’t seen another person for hours and he feared that he would never again. The stone of the walls seemed alien, and felt it to, as it ebbed cold into his bones and sucked out both warmth and magic from his body at a rate to make it just uncomfortable enough that he hadn’t been able to sleep for hours. His head laid rested on the barred entrance to his cell whilst on the opposite wall, there was a small barred box of a window. His vision was fixed on it, or rather what was beyond it, as he felt it was the only thing keeping him fixed to sanity. The stars twinkled like tears and thin wads of cotton wool moved to wipe them every so often, although, they soon were gone and the tears were left flow again. If Harry had the power to do anything, it would be to relate to that sky.</p><p>Harry had thought that he knew what loss was. Afterall, he had lost so much, more so than others perhaps, he had even caused loss simply by existing. But never had he truly ached so much as when Voldemort split that slit for a mouth into a smile as he looked down at Harry’s wasted, defeated body or when his cronies could be heard cackling from the sacred rooftops of Hogwarts as they danced in victory into the night. Never had his heart bled in his body as it did when he realised that he was the one who had stamped out all the hope left in the world and had left it to rot like that thing in King’s Cross. But the worst part, the part that had his spirit reeling, was that he was alive and sitting in this cell while everyone else died because he was so incompetent that he couldn’t be trusted to die. He had always found being special awkward and uncomfortable, now he despised it. </p><p>Whilst his body functioned, Harry’s mind had definitely stopped working. He couldn’t remember the last time his brain had had a cohesive thought. If he did manage to coax something into his brain, he was met with a bombardment of the events at Hogwarts and they continued to beat him until he lost the energy to torture himself. He would then be left sitting defeated once more on the floor of the cell, staring into the stars</p><p>Besides, what good would thinking get you? He thought he would win the battle for the lights. He thought that he would celebrate with a mug of butterbeer and discuss careers with Ron and Hermione in front of the common room fire. He thought that maybe, if he were lucky, he could marry a nice girl like Ginny, and they could build a life together. He even dreamed of growing old and watching his grandchild win their first Quidditch match from the Hogwarts stands with a lion’s scarf wrapped proudly around his neck. Those thoughts had only done him harm, for now, he sat alone in a cell with no one but the stars to keep him company.</p><p>Harry felt a tear warm his face, following a pre-determined path to his neck where it would add to the uncomfortable damp on his shirt. He briefly closed his eyes, willing sleep or anything to break up the day for him and give him a break from reality. However, his eyes remained light and lithe and unsettled, so he opened them once more and felt his body wrack in a sob. </p><p>His whole being stilled then, as he watched a star pass in and out of the sky like the stitch of a seamstress on a quilt. He laughed, unsure of what quite motivated it, and decided, perhaps in a moment of insanity and diversion, to make a wish. It was what the muggles did, and simply because it was not wizard related, it appealed to his mind. He closed his eyes and made way for his voice to leave his body by coughing. </p><p>“I wish..” His eyes opened. “I wish that I had a chance. Just one chance to solve everything. To save everyone. To make up for my mistakes. To finally be happy,” He took a deep breath and felt his lungs stretch and contract stronger than before. It soothed him actually, to breath so deeply, and, rather unintentionally, he found himself begin to droop. He wondered if he had been breathing properly at all up until this point as he suddenly could not keep his eyes open, even if you paid him to. The last thing he felt as he slipped into unconsciousness, was peace. </p><p>Complete and utter peace.</p>
