    <p>
  <span>I knocked on the open door to McGonagall’s office, to be greeted by a distracted, “I’ll be with you in a moment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s okay,” I responded cheerfully. “I can wait.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her bright green gaze shot up from the parchment on her desk and fixed on my position in the doorway. “Lily Flores!” she exclaimed, climbing to her feet. “You are supposed to be in Australia right now!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I crossed the room and briefly took her hands in affectionate greeting. “I was homesick. They gave me some time off, so I came back to visit my parents. As luck would have it, I ran into Rowan’s mum on a trip into London, and she sent me here with a care package for her. So here I am. It is good to see you, Professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not your professor anymore, Lily. Minerva will suffice.” She gestured for me to pull up a chair as she sat back down, giving me an intelligent look in the process. “She couldn’t have sent it by owl?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled revealingly. “Some owls can be rather unreliable, you know? And besides, I don’t need much more than a terrible excuse to visit old friends and teachers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Old? I see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know what I mean. I’ve slowly been making my rounds. Rowan looks quite well. I can tell she loves her job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed. You’ll be happy to hear she is one of the best professors I have ever seen, which is remarkable given her age. She gives the students a challenge, so be assured the Ravenclaws love her. If she keeps this up, then she may very well replace Filius as Head of House. Only after a good number of years of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I chuckled. “I’m unsurprised. There are few people smarter than Rowan, and this has been her dream since before we were first-years. She deserves it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I agree. Although, if I may be so bold as to boast, one of my own Gryffindors, a fifth-year named Hermione Granger, gives her a run for her money, so to speak. Top of every class.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t underestimate Gryffindors, but I’ll believe it when I see it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hah! Best believe it. Have you spoken with Filius yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not yet. I was planning on saying hello to Flitwick next.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She raised her eyebrows. “So you came to me before coming to your Head of House? I should be honored.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, in all honesty, your position is more conveniently located, Deputy Headmistress.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Please, Lily, as I have said, call me Minerva. These are stressful times. I would prefer it if I knew more people were on my side, especially when you never know who may be listening in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can count on it...Minerva.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s good to hear. Now, tell me how you’ve been. Working with Australian Magical Customs must bring a fair amount of excitement. You’re in charge of overseeing the import and export of magical creatures, correct?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Basically. I travel with the creatures and make sure they get to where they need to go. It’s interesting, and I love traveling, but it does get tiring. I’ve been thinking about taking a position closer to home. Apparently I’m not the only one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve met with Bill Weasley?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have. I heard from Charlie first. My most recent job involved escorting a dragon to him in Romania, and he told me some rather surprising things. I had such a hard time believing that Bill Weasley, our most adventurous Curse-Breaker, would take a desk job with Gringotts that I had to make a stop in London to see it for myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you found it to be true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did. And, in the strangest coincidence, I ran into Nymphadora Tonks in Diagon Alley as well. On some Auror business for the Ministry or whatnot. Always leaves her mark on the town, that one. But both of them told me the same strange things Charlie did...about the Quidditch World Cup and the Tri-Wizard Tournament.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound like you’ve been out of the loop.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not out of the loop exactly. I just know that the farther information has to travel, the more likely I am to be misinformed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well said. If I may inquire, what new position were you thinking of taking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, since Tonks makes it look so cool, I was thinking of becoming an Auror.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She granted me a stern expression. “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>have</span>
  </em>
  <span> been misinformed. There is no security in such a position, not like there once was. And especially not for someone of your...particular talents.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what would you recommend I do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I recommend you go back to Australia for the meantime. For your own good. Things here are becoming...complicated. It’s not safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not safe? Have you ever been to Australia? Half the creatures there spit venom! But anyway, I have my own reasons for returning to Britain, as you may very well know. If I’ve heard correctly, things aren’t just going to blow over, Minerva. They’re going to get worse. You’ll need all the help you can get.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head, but she failed to keep a small smile off her lips. “Five years since you graduated, and you haven’t changed a bit. When there’s trouble, you always have to run towards it; never away from it like a sensible person. This is why I’m glad you were Filius’ problem and not mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I hummed my assent. “You say that, but I’m fairly certain you took more house points away from me than he did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do think he was too fond of you for your own good, and I’ll never forgive him for teaching you how to duel as a first-year, but you were a good student. And I’ll admit I was softer on you than I should have been as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If he hadn’t taught me, then I would’ve found someone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you most clearly demonstrated, time and time again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you know I hated disappointing him—and you and Dumbledore, but it was always to do what I thought was right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if it was stupid and dangerous and wrong. It is honestly a miracle you lived to graduate. But, yes, I know. And I hope you’ll never do anything like that again!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No promises,” I laughed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is where you’re supposed to lie to me,” she sighed. “I’ve had my own problems to deal with since you’ve been gone. Speaking of...do you three need something, or are you going to continue to eavesdrop from around the corner?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked over my shoulder to see a student enter the room with a sheepish expression on her face. She was older, perhaps a fifth-year, wore Gryffindor robes, and had a wild mane of curly brown hair. “We’re sorry, Professor,” she said sincerely. “We didn’t want to interrupt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two boys trailed in after her, also both in Gryffindor robes and with matching expressions. One had short, messy black hair and glasses, and the other had striking red hair and a face full of freckles. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s quite alright, Miss Granger,” McGonagall said unconcernedly. “We were just catching up. What can I do for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl handed her a small slip of parchment. “We were wondering if we could get your permission to check this book out of the Restricted Section. We want to do some extra reading on defensive spells.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall adjusted her glasses as she studied the parchment. “The Patronus Charm? These are highly advanced spells, well beyond the capability of the average fifth-year. Why not ask your Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor instead?” If I wasn’t mistaken, it almost sounded like she was joking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The red-haired boy spoke up. “To tell you the truth, Professor, you’re a great deal more approachable than she is.” Now that was saying something. There were many words that could be used to describe the Deputy Headmistress, but “approachable” was not one I would choose. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Careful what you say, Mr. Weasley,” she lightly chastised him. So he was a Weasley! He bore remarkable similarity to his brothers. “But I see no harm in letting you do some extra reading, so long as that is only what you do. I’ll sign the permission slip only if you promise that I won’t catch you performing these spells. Understood?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I didn’t miss the loophole in her conditions, and it was clear from the trio’s excited faces that they didn’t either. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Professor!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Professor!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Professor!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t thank me. I will not bail you out if you get yourselves into trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I stared in amazement as she dipped a quill in ink and began to sign the parchment. “Things have certainly changed since I was a student.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall didn’t look up from her task, but she said, “I probably should have asked you this first, Lily, but does Umbridge know you’re here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I haven’t exactly been keeping my presence a secret. I met her shortly after I arrived, and can’t say I’m too fond of her. I told her the truth—that I’ve been out of the country for a while and wanted to visit old friends, but she wouldn’t believe me. Insisted on personally inspecting Rowan’s package. She finally left me alone when a chocolate frog mysteriously escaped and jumped on her face.” I winked at the students as they fought back laughter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall gave me another stern look. “Know that I am serious when I say this: avoid her at all costs. You would do best not to get on her bad side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Prof...Minerva. But I can’t go sneaking around or people will think I’m up to something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just try to behave. </span>
  <em>
    <span>All</span>
  </em>
  <span> of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me,” the girl addressed me, “But did I hear correctly? Are you Lily Flores?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had heard of me? That wasn’t necessarily a good sign. “I am. And you must be the student Professor McGonagall was just telling me about—the one that is showing up Professor Khanna. Hermione Granger?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked thrilled that I knew her. “Yes! Oh, it is such an honor to meet you! I read about you in the revised edition of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts: A History</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Your rediscovery of the Cursed Vaults is legendary. And you’re one of the seven Animagi to be registered in the twentieth century, not to mention one of the youngest—registering at only thirteen, along with Talbott Winger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No way!” the Weasley boy exclaimed. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>You’re</span>
  </em>
  <span> an Animagus?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I chuckled. “It’s true. Talbott is actually the one that taught me how to transform, along with some advice from McGonagall.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wicked cool!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor Khanna talks about you a lot,” Hermione added. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does she mention that I’m her best friend?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled knowingly. “On occasion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s nice to meet you too, Hermione. I’m honored that you’re honored.” </span>
