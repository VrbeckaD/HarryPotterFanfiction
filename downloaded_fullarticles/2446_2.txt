    <p>She had been throwing dirty looks at him ever time he came into the shop. Technically, it was still partly his, a fact the ex-demon seemed to have trouble getting her head around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He sighed when Anya crept up behind him and stared into the cash register after he rang up a customer. “Anya, I’m not stealing anything.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not while I’m looking.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Even when you’re not.” Giles closed the drawer with more force then necessary. Normally her behavior wouldn’t get to him so much, but with Buffy being so distant, Anya was only serving to add to his sense of being unwanted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Don’t damage my property!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It is my property as well--”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The shop door opened and its little bell tinkled the signal of a new arrival, but for some reason the familiar sound froze Giles in place. It was late and the shop was about to close, though they had their fair share of last minute shoppers. There was something different this time, Giles could feel it right down to his core. When he had stopped mid-sentence Anya had begun waving her hand in front of his face, but he continued to ignore her and turned his gaze towards the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“God no!” He threw himself to the floor and pressed himself up against the counter, praying to all deities and demons that he hadn‘t been seen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anya wanted to question Giles, but when she caught sight of the new arrival she couldn’t help but wonder if time had jumped backwards to Halloween, thus distracting her. Halloween this year hadn’t been bad, Xander had finally decided to tell everyone they were engaged. The thought made Anya smile and pet her engagement ring, which gave her time to consider option number two. Option two was that the man who just walked into the Magic Box was an escapee from an old folks home. He certainly looked old enough to need to be in a home, and his eccentric dress gave the impression he had to escape form somewhere in order to be dressed in such a manner in public.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can I help you?” she asked, hoping there wasn’t an option number three in which he was a cultist searching for young beautiful women to sacrifice. You could never be sure when it came to odd-dressers in Sunnydale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The old man smiled pleasantly at her, walking farther into the shop, causing his midnight blue robes to swirl around him. He certainly pulled the look off well, if that indicated anything. “Ah yes, madam, I was wondering if you could help me find someone?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His eyes twinkled at her with amusement, giving Anya the impression the man he was looking for was the hiding behind the counter, holding onto one of her ankles with a death grip. For the sake of her ankle she played along.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Uh, who?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Rupert Giles, have you heard of him? I’m an old friend, and haven’t seen him in quite a while.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Somehow, Giles‘ iron grip on her ankle tightened to near excruciating. “He’s out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Could you please tell him Albus has stopped by town and would very much like to speak with him?” He stopped across from her on the other side of the counter and began rooting around in his pockets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ll pass along the message.” She kicked Giles with her free foot, but he still didn’t let go, or make a sound. “While you’re here is there anything you’d like to buy?” Any opportunity was a business opportunity in her book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Albus’s eyes roved around the shop with an oddly childlike curiosity, but he shook his head in the end. “I’m afraid not. Would you like a lemon drop?” He had taken the bag of sweets from his pocket and popped one into his mouth when he finished speaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hm, alright.” Anya plucked one out of the bag and sniffed at it curiously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Rupert,” the older man called out. “Would you like to join us and have a lemon drop?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I will not be bribed like a bloody infant.” Giles groused, finally releasing Anya’s ankle, but not getting up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I shall not treat you like one if you do not act like one.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Grumbling irritably, Giles finally pulled himself up off the floor, dusting off his clothes as he stood. Anya smacked him on the arm when he stopped fidgeting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s what you deserve, I’m probably going to bruise!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Albus continued to smile pleasantly at the both of them, silently offering the lemon drops to Giles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No thank you.” He rubbed at the now sore spot on his arm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you insist, but they’re quite good.” Albus put the bag away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anya finally ventured to put her candy in her mouth, and her face scrunched up immediately at the taste. She swallowed the whole thing before it could reek any more havoc on her tongue, coughing slightly. Giles awkwardly patted her back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You know,” Albus continued. “If I had known how you would react to my arrival I would have--”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come anyway.” Giles finished for him. “What do you want?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Want? Would you judge my motive so quickly? What if I simply wanted your company?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You would still be wanting.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Albus chuckled at the come back. “True enough!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anya massaged her throat, now eyeing the robed individual suspiciously, as if he had been the reason she choked. “I’m going to get some water,” she mumbled, slipping away from the pair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When she disappeared into the back room the ex-Watched sighed, slipped off his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Let’s not waste either of our time, what do you want?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before he could answer the shop bell rang out, but the sound was quickly drowned out by voices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“See? I’ll even hold the door, like a perfect gentleman!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tara laughed at Willow. “I don’t want you to be a gentleman.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, a perfect lady then.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pair continued to giggle softly, but a much quieter figure followed behind them like a shadow. Willow, Tara and Buffy froze and fell into a matched silence at the sight of Albus, however.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Giles groaned, leaning forward onto the shop counter, squeezing his eyes closed, and wishing the whole scenario away. “You always come at the worst bloody time, don’t you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Whatever do you mean?” the old man asked cheerfully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three girls gaped for a moment, and Willow was the one to regain speech first. “Giles, who’s this?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Willow.” He sighed, resigned to his current fate. “Tara, Buffy; this is Albus Dumbledore. An old… friend of mine.”</p>
<p> </p>
