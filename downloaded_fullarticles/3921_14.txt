  <em>The cries of anguish echoed the area. A fire spread quickly, its flames eating the forest and its inhabitant. I could hear them begging for their lives, protecting their loved ones from us. This isn’t what I wanted, we were supposed to be the protectors, killing innocent beings was not part of our jobs, but why were we doing this.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I dragged my sword across the dirt, staring at the angels being slaughtered one by one. I felt someone bumped into me, a child perhaps, as they wrapped their arms around my waist as they shook uncontrollably. The looked up at me with fear evident in its eyes, blood was dripping down her face as she cried. This isn’t what I wanted, but if I could save this child then maybe I could be forgiven. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I took her in my arms and ran, I ran as fast as I could. Away from the blood being spilled, away from my team being possessed by the madness. I desperately search for a safe place I could hide the child while also trying to avoid being seen, If they saw me save this child, an angel no less, I would be punished and tortured for all eternity.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I could hear my team calling my name, it was deathly silent now, and I knew they finished killing all the angels that escaped. The child shivered in my arms, her grip tightening as each second pass by. I finally saw the border separating Heaven and Helle, if I was fast enough I could get the child to safety before returning to my team. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I was so close, just a few more seconds and I could save the child but alas, fate was never by my side. A demon patrolling was there, he turned as he heard the noise I made. I hid quickly, shushing the crying child in my arms, I held my breath as the demon inspected the area. He shrugged, thinking it was just his imagination before leaving. I almost cried in relief, I walked with the child, hand in hand and I watched her walk towards the barrier. She turned, giving me a tight hug, I returned the favor, grateful she was going to be alright.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“what are you doing Sephaire?” I turned and saw the face of a sinister man with a grin so wide and psychotic. It happened so fast, one moment I was hugging the child next, I saw the blood-covered axe being raised before plummeting down to-</em>
</p><p>I woke up with a gasp, I clutched my chest, willing my heart to calm down. It was that dream again, he thought. He wondered who this Sephaire was and why he was dreaming about him. Shaking his head, he pushed the dream at the back of his mind, he had more important things to do, like attending to his father’s needs.</p><p>He left his ragged bed, fixing it in the process. He did his daily routine in the bathroom, wash his face then brush his teeth. He stared at the mirror, taking in the tired eyes and his large nose, then opening the mirror to get an ointment for his bruised face.</p><p>Once finished, he got dressed and went downstairs to prepare breakfast. He carefully walked as to avoid the creaking noise it would make, if his father was sleeping and was awoken by the creaking noise then he would be punished, and he was too tired for any punishments.</p><p>In the kitchen, the chopping sounds echoed inside the quiet room. His mother was standing there, cutting up the ingredients for today’s breakfast. He steadily went and helped her as she looked like she might fall over.</p><p>He prepared the table for them to eat, placing the food on the table as his mother went to wake his drunk father. A loud crash was heard, and he cringed at the sound, his father came in through the door, a scowl on his face as he sat on the dining table. They ate quietly, Severus willing for his father to finish eating. His father stood up, opening the fridge to get the last set of alcohol and left. With him gone, Severus collected the empty plates and placed them in the sink for him to wash.</p><p>“I’ll be going to buy more food, stay safe Severus” His mother whispered as she kissed his forehead. He bid her goodbye, wanting nothing more than to join her so he could leave this place he calls home even for a little while.</p><p>After all his chores were done, he went into the living room where his father took place. He made himself look small and prayed that his father wouldn’t see him. He was almost at the staircase when he heard a bottle breaking and his fathers' gruff voice calling for him.</p><p>“yes, father?” he asked. His father shook the bottle of beer he was holding, all around him was dirt and trash, the shards of the bottle lay by his feet.</p><p>“get me more beer freak” his father said. He nodded, his father gestured at the broken shards, he quickly ran towards the kitchen and took a broom to clean up the mess. He placed the broom back to its original place once he was finished. Severus placed on a sweater with a hood and wore his shoes, coming back to his father to get the money.</p><p>“You better be back with the damned alcohol freak!” Tobias slurred as he threw a couple of bills at Severus’ feet. He shakily bends down to pick the bills and left the house to buy the beer bottles his father wanted him to get. He pulled the hood of his sweater to cover his bruised face as he walked towards the nearest store. He didn’t want the townspeople to stare at him with pity when they knew who had hurt the poor child. Tobias was a drunken mess in the Snape household and Eileen was no better as she was constantly being abused and couldn’t help her child even if she wanted to. </p><p>“Help! Please help me!” He heard someone, a female, yell out, it made him pause and the urge to help the said person and not leave her behind was tempting. He looked up and saw it was nearing nightfall, he needed to buy the beers his father wants to avoid a beating. He took a step forward when the screaming increased, there was a sob in there too he thought, he sighed and turned around, searching for the sounds. The screaming was coming from an alley, he placed both of his hands on the wall separating the two buildings and peered in to check if the sounds were coming through here. He gasped in shock when he saw a girl, probably the same age as him, was pressed on the dirty alley wall with a man touching her on places deemed inappropriate. The man had his left hand covering the girl's mouth, quieting any sounds she makes, while his other hand was currently undressing her. Tears and snot slowly dripped down her face and onto the hand that was on her mouth. Severus felt disgusted at the sight, not because of the liquid trailing down her face, but because a girl his age was going to be raped and he had thought about leaving her on her own.</p><p>The man had pulled down the girls pants and was now unbuttoning her shirt. Severus looked around for something that can help him save the girl. He saw the lid of a garbage can on the floor, it was only a few meters away from him but if he was fast enough he could knock out the man without being seen. He ran as fast and as quietly as his small body can, he bends down and took the lid without stopping and raised it above his head before smashing it down to the side of the man’s head. The girl looked at him with wide eyes, he smiled softly, hoping that she would be comforted, and she did. She jumps towards her savior and hugged him, repeatedly saying thank you as she clung to the boys’ shirt. He pulled her back, buttoning up her shirt and helping her put on her pants.</p><p>“Thank you, thank you so much” She whispered softly, Severus ruffled her and watched her shakily leave the alley, glancing back at the man who had almost raped her if he wasn’t there. Her body was shaking from the cold and he felt sad for her, he took off his sweater and handed it to the girl which she took with gratitude. Severus noticed the sky had gone black, stars twinkling here and there, and he cringed at the punishment he knew he was going to get for returning late, especially without the beer. Severus quickly bid the young girl goodbye and ran towards the nearest store and bought the beer before running back home.</p><p>Severus opened the door to the house as quietly as he could, praying to god that father was passed out, so he could get away from any punishment today. Upon entering, he noticed how dark the place was and it was oddly empty. He crept into the room, dropping the plastic with beers on the kitchen table before slowly making his way upstairs. He was almost there, just one more step and he would make it, but the universe really wanted him to suffer, the lights downstairs suddenly came on and he heard his father’s voice, loud and clear asking him where had he been.</p><p>“I didn’t realize it was that late father, I didn’t mean to stay out that late” Severus replied timidly. He felt his heart racing by the minute as he went back downstairs and stood in front of his father.</p><p>“You know better than to keep me waiting boy, get on your Knees!” He shouted out. Severus did as he told, tears prickling in his eyes. He heard him take off the belt attached to his pants, he whimpered as the belt hit his arse. He wanted someone to save him from his father, he pictured his prince charming coming here and saving him from this monster he calls a father.</p><p>He could see the growing spots on the corner of his eyes, the steady pull of unconsciousness was growing, and he accepted the darkness that held him in its grasp. The last thing he saw was his father's angry face and a man with horns on his head holding him and carrying him back to his bed.</p>
