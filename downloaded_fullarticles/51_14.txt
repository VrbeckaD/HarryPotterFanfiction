    <p>It was a couple of days before September first when Draco made his way through Diagon Alley for the second time that month. He passed by Flourish and Blotts and gazed over his shoulder at Gringotts as he made a sharp left turn. Just like last time Diagon Alley was busy, but it wasn’t the kind of busy he was used to in the wizarding shopping street. Usually people would stand still to chat with whatever acquaintances they came across and check out shops because they wanted to see what’s new. Now everyone seemed to be in a hurry to get their last-minute shopping done before their kids went off to Hogwarts; everyone that didn’t have children going to Hogwarts knew not to go to Diagon Alley when it was this busy.</p>
<p>Draco wasn’t in a hurry. He wandered into the side street with his hands in his pockets, by all appearances simply walking by and not walking towards anywhere in particular. That he had a destination in mind was beside the point, because no one had to know that he did. According to Borgin it was possible that someone followed him last time, because the last time he’d been to Borgin and Burkes a witch came in not long afterwards querying about him. That just wouldn’t do. He hadn’t been careful enough last time and he wasn’t going to let it happen again.</p>
<p>After all, he had plenty to worry about all by himself. He didn’t need people that thought he was up to something adding to it. He always was, and it was never good news, and whoever had done it should know as much by now and leave him alone.</p>
<p>He passed by a few men smoking muggle cigarettes – he wrinkled his nose at the scent – and an older woman who was mumbling to herself. Knockturn Alley was always filled with sketchy types, so it was probably for the better he had the hood of his cloak drawn up. Instead of walk into Borgin and Burkes immediately he stood still in front of the shop and studied the window display, as though studying the items in there before going in with the intent to buy something. The older witch passed him by. Just as Draco thought she was gone, she stood still beside him.</p>
<p>“Do you like anything you see?” she asked with a raspy voice.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Draco asked. “Money? Will that make you go away? Because I’m not in the mood and usually above hurting women, but don’t test me.”</p>
<p>That got the woman’s attention, if the way she turned towards him was anything to go by.  “You’re in danger,” she said softly.</p>
<p>No shit, Draco wanted to say. The Dark Lord was back and people were disappearing left and right. His father was in jail for ruining one of the most important operations in years, setting the Death Eaters back in their plans a lot, and he was suffering the consequences. That he was in danger seemed to be the bloody understatement of the century.</p>
<p>“You’re in danger if you don’t leave soon,” he said, already reaching for his wand. The Dark Lord would kill him if he got expelled for performing magic at Diagon Alley, but it was a problem that went away when they threw some money against it. If Potter got away with it by getting Dumbledore as a lawyer, it couldn’t be that big of an issue.</p>
<p>“Draco,” the woman said, undertone dry suddenly, “I may not know you very well, but I do know you’re not capable of hurting an old woman. I just want to have a word.”</p>
<p>Draco stared at her. How did she know his name? He’d been in the newspaper, sure, but he didn’t think anyone recognized him in Knockturn Alley. He’d hardly ever been here. This was only the second time this summer and he’d accompanied his father there just once before, but that had been years ago. Part of him immediately wanted to prove the woman wrong, but she’d done no harm so far and she may hurt him if he didn’t listen. There was no harm in a word, right?</p>
<p>“Fine,” Draco conceded. “No more than a minute. I have business to attend.”</p>
<p>It was with a sigh that he turned around and walked after the older woman. He passed by Borgin and Burkes and watched how she stood still in the doorway of a shop that had recently been trashed by the Death Eaters. The owner, someone who openly sided with Potter, had fled the scene and the Death Eaters had set the place on fire when they were done with it. The smoke damage was everywhere and there was hardly any merchandise left.</p>
<p>The woman turned away from him as he stood still in front of her  and seemed to shake her head. He couldn’t see what she was doing, but when she turned to face him next her face had changed drastically. She was no longer an old woman. Instead, she was a young woman in her mid-twenties with dark brown hair and brown eyes, a striking resemblance to Bellatrix. She had the Black bone structure that Draco did too. It wasn’t Polyjuice Potion, because Draco hadn’t seen her drink anything. That could mean only one thing and that pissed him off.</p>
<p>“Is this how the Ministry operates these days, Nymphadora?” he spat at her. “Or the Order? Am I the weak link, is that is? Are you going to abduct me next and torture information out of me? I said I was usually above hurting women but this is starting to look like an exception to me.”</p>
<p>Nymphadora Tonks, in the flesh. The cousin that he didn’t (or at least wasn’t supposed to) acknowledge existed was standing in front of him with an undeniably irritated face expression. Andromeda Black married beneath her and was disowned. This was the result of that marriage. A young woman, an auror, an Order member and currently an enormous pain in Draco’s side.</p>
<p>She leaned against the doorway of the shop casually and studied him briefly, as though trying to figure him out before concluding there was nothing she could see other than the oh-so obvious irritation. “Tell me that you’re not involved in anything dark,” she challenged him, eyebrows raising. “Tell me that you’re wandering around Knockturn just because you’re fascinated with the place and nothing else. You can’t and you know it. You’re in trouble, Draco.”</p>
<p>“You can’t arrest me for wandering around Knockturn Alley,” Draco said. “I’m always in trouble. You don’t know that about me because we don’t know each other, but trouble is kind of my thing. You are, however, getting me in the kind of trouble I don’t enjoy: the trouble I’ll get into when I have to explain that my half-blood cousin of my mother’s blood traitor sister insisted to talk to me.”</p>
<p>Nymphadora sighed briefly. “I’m not surprised,” she said after a short silence. “But it’s not too late. We have to talk, whether you like it or not. From what I’ve gathered, it’s about life-and-death matters. Your father’s life, for starters.”</p>
<p>That remark set Draco on edge immediately. “What do you know about life-and-death matters that involve my father?” he snapped at her. “You don’t know anything.”</p>
<p>“No, but you just confirmed it has to do with your father’s life,” Nymphadora replied before she pressed on. “Just hear me out. Please. I know that you don’t think of me as your family, but I also know that blood means something.”</p>
<p>“Tainted blood doesn’t.”</p>
<p>“Draco -”</p>
<p>“Fine,” he said through gritted teeth. “But this is the last favour I’m granting. Once you’re done I’m going back to the business I had to tend to and you’re going back to minding yours.”  </p>
<p>As it turned out, hearing Nymphadora out was going to have to happen in another location. Draco didn’t trust it, but he wasn’t given much of a choice in the matter. She was still an Auror, and if she already knew more than she was letting on she also could have arrested him based on the fact that he was a Death Eater alone. Arrested he wasn’t going to kill Dumbledore, so he let her take him away from Knockturn Alley by side-along apparition, complaining all the while he didn’t like side-along apparition (he really didn’t).</p>
<p>They apparated to what looked like a regular London street at first glance, with houses on both sides of the road and a small grocery store at the corner with a pub next to it. They crossed the street and passed through another side-street afterwards.</p>
<p>“Do you live here?” Draco asked his cousin.</p>
<p>“No one lives here,” Nymphadora replied. “We don’t know if we can  trust you, so you wouldn’t bring you to a place that’s ours. Your possible allies don’t need the help, Draco.”</p>
<p>His possible allies were wondering where he was right about now, but that didn’t seem to bother Nymphadora, who moved on fast. She pushed open the door of a pub and made her way towards the bar. She looked over her shoulder at him then. “Do you want anything?”</p>
<p>Would she give him alcohol if he asked? Probably not. “A water, please,” he replied, resigning himself to the fact that this was apparently going to be a long sit.</p>
<p>Nymphadora ordered two waters, which she got from the bartender swiftly. She took both glasses over from him and made her way towards the back of the cafe, where they were sitting out of sight. When Draco walked after her, however, he realized she had invited another person to this clandestine meeting. Briefly, he thought he was looking at Bellatrix and his mind immediately made up a story about how the Death Eaters captured the real Nymphadora, used her hair to make Polyjuice Potion and tricked him to check his loyalty. But then he realized that wasn’t possible: Nymphadora was a metamorphmagus. He’d seen it up close. Whoever were to take Polyjuice Potion to look like her would look like her latest look, but wouldn’t get her abilities as well.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t Bellatrix waiting for him. The same bone structure, again, the same cheekbones and her hair and eye colour was the same, but that was it. Draco let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding and slowly sat down at the table. He chose the seat in front of his aunt and next to his cousin. </p>
<p>Andromeda Tonks took him in and smiled slowly. “Hi Draco,” she said, reaching out to touch his arm. He was quick to pull back and watched how Andromeda and Nymphadora exchanged a glance. “We don’t have long,” Andromeda continued regardless, acting as though nothing had just happened. “I presume you know the story between your parents and myself?”</p>
<p>“You married a mudblood and had a daughter with him,” Draco said pointedly. “What did you expect was going to happen? That your family would be squealing with joy over those facts? You tainted our bloodline.”</p>
<p>“And yet you’re here,” Nymphadora pointed out, surprisingly calm considering that he had insulted her family yet again.</p>
<p>“I figured it was either this or get arrested, so I picked my poison,” he replied, shooting a look aside at her briefly. “But if you’re not going to arrest me, I have to go.”</p>
<p>When he did as much as move to get up, Nymphadora responded by taking his arm. His right arm, thankfully. She didn’t hold on tightly and he didn’t make much of an effort to get loose, though. He shot another glare at her before she let her go and he sunk down onto the chair.</p>
<p>“Draco, this meeting isn’t about me,” Andromeda said. “It’s about you. I may have left our family, but I know plenty about the Dark Lord and how he operates from all the years of listening to Bella’s, Rodolphus’ and Lucius’ stories. He doesn’t take failure very lightly. With your father arrested for what can only be considered one of the biggest failed missions of the Death Eaters, second only to Voldemort dying after trying to kill Harry Potter, I doubt he’s taken it lightly.”</p>
<p>Draco wanted to protest almost every word she spoke and had a number of insults at the ready to hurl at her, but he felt too tired to do it.  This was going somewhere, he was sure, and he didn’t think the offer was going to end in him getting killed. The people that supported the Light like Andromeda and Nymphadora didn’t seem to believe in death threats. Maybe that was why institutions like the Order were so shockingly ineffective.</p>
<p>“What does this have to do with me?” he asked, feigning disinterest.</p>
<p>He saw mother and daughter exchange another glance. “We suspect that Voldemort -” he hadn’t cringed the last time Andromeda used that name, but now he couldn’t help it, “has taken out Lucius’ failure on you. People are worried about you. We’ve been keeping an eye on you this summer and you don’t seem to be doing very well, if you don’t mind me saying so.”</p>
<p>“My father is in jail,” Draco said with a raised voice, causing multiple muggles to look at him. For the next sentence, he lowered his voice. “Excuse me if I don’t know how to handle that particularly well.”</p>
<p>Nymphadora had enough of the chit-chat. “Draco, what is he making you do?”</p>
<p>He looked aside at her briefly and contemplated what to say. The truth, obviously, was not among the options. Thankfully there was no way she could get that out of him due to the Occlumency he had been learning in the summer so far. “Who is making me do what?”</p>
<p>In a swift movement, Nymphadora reached out for his left arm, taking advantage of the fact that he had slumped in his chair and put his hands down in front of him at the table. Draco immediately tightened his muscles so she couldn’t turn his arm around to see if there was a Dark Mark even if she tried. After a couple of seconds she gave up and sighed.</p>
<p>“The fact that you’re fighting it proves there’s something you don’t want me to see,” she remarked.</p>
<p>“You can stop using your psychology bullshit on me,” he said. “I could have any number of things on my left arm that I don’t want you, Order member and half-blood, to see.”</p>
<p>“Draco,” Nymphadora said sharply, “Everyone is willing to let you struggle with whatever it is Voldemort wants you to do and is willing to let you face whatever the consequences are. The only people in your corner are us and you’ve not been someone I want to be in the corner of.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need you,” he said. “You’ve dragged me here thinking I’m yours to save, but I’m not. I can figure out a way to do what I have to. I have the entire school year. I’ll do it. I just need to know how. And I don’t need you stopping me or telling me I don’t have to do it, because I do.”</p>
<p>Nymphadora sighed again and leaned back against his own chair. “You’re going to get yourself killed,” she said flatly.</p>
<p>“I’m aware,” Draco replied, smiling dryly. “You’re too late. I don’t believe that you, or anyone, can do anything for me anymore. But you tried, so whatever makes you sleep at night, right?”</p>
<p>With that, he finished the glass of water that Nymphadora ordered for him and sighed. “Out of courtesy I’m going to say it was nice to meet you. Can you apparate me back or do I have to find my own way back and get lost?”</p>
<p>Nymphadora finished her glass as well and stood up. “I’ll take you back,” she said, eyeing him sadly. “Don’t get yourself in trouble, Draco. I’ll be in Hogsmeade this school year if you need me. I’m in the Three Broomsticks, so send me a letter and I’ll come and find you.”</p>
<p>That was a terrible plan, and Draco didn’t intend to hold her to it.</p>
