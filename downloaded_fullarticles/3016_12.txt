    <p>Sirius wasn’t often accident prone. Somehow, without even looking where he was going, he managed to be completely aware of his surroundings. Remus would never forget the first time he’d properly noticed. Sirius had his head in a book, doing his best to get in a last little bit of studying before Quidditch practise, and a first year had tripped, spilling their potion all over the walkway. It was the smell that hit Remus first, and it took couple of seconds for him to piece together that should anyone step in that, they’d immediately end up on their arse. Not Sirius though. He took one step, paused without even looking up from his book and did a quick hop over the mess. Every now and again, however, usually when he was acting like an idiot, Sirius would finally have an accident, and his accidents were catastrophic. It was as though the universe were making up for the countless times he’d been flawless. James and Sirius had been throwing a quaffle back and forth for a little under an hour and where as it’d started out as a simple game of catch, it’d escalated to trying to get the other to miss. A particular bad throw on James’ part, and Sirius dove to catch it. What he hadn’t accounted for however, was tripping on his robes and knocking into the desk where Remus kept his work. Had that not been bad enough, the jolt of the table knocked over a pot of ink, sending the top flying off, allowing the ink to spill everywhere.</p>
<p>“Shit...”</p>
<p>There was a brief exchange of glances back and forth between the two before both of them darted about the room frantically trying to both clean up the mess and make it look a little less like they’d been doing exactly what Remus had told them countless times not  to do. When the dorm room door nudged open, all either of them could do was freeze on the spot, James with a handful of ink covered tissues and Sirius looking for a place to hide the ball.</p>
<p>“What...the fuck are you...is that ink all over my desk?!”<br/>“Fuck...”<br/>“Pads....Prongs...”<br/>“James threw the ball!”<br/>“Well Sirius knocked into the desk!”<br/>“You little snitch!”<br/>“You snitched first!”</p>
<p>The back and forth was nothing Remus wasn’t already used to. While they weren’t related by blood, it was clear that these two were destined to be brothers. That dynamic alone was what had forced a relationship to be put on hold in the beginning. Looking back on it now, it was funny. At the time, it’d been as though the decision were life or death. Sirius liked Remus. James liked Remus. Remus liked them both, and he didn’t want to choose. The idea of seeing James naked had made Sirius wrinkle the bridge of his nose, and James had made a melodramatic gagging sound.</p>
<p>“Oi! You’d be lucky to see my dick.”<br/>“I’d rather see Merlin’s dick than yours, Pads.”</p>
<p>While it was all lighthearted banter back and forth, accompanied by a few nudges here and there, a decision would have to eventually be made. They’d come to conclusion that it wasn’t fair for James to want Remus and  Lily, so he’d backed off, to let the two love birds have their way, but it hadn’t exactly worked out that way. He was supposed to be going to Hogsmede in a bid to get Lily to go on a date with him, but at the last minute she’d cancelled. Something about Marlene and a failed polyjuice potion. What he’d anticipated was to go back and have his friends laughing at the idea that she’d actually just changed her mind. What he was greeted with was Sirius bent over the edge of the bed, moans muffled into the duvet while Remus held him there, thrusting hard into him. He could swear he’d gone lightheaded at the rate at which the blood in his body had rushed south to one particular point. Remus hadn’t even stopped, just turned to look over his shoulder and lifted a brow as if to say ‘coming?’. Sirius was a mess beneath him, pelvis hitting hard against the bed frame.</p>
<p>“Open your mouth, Sirius.”</p>
<p>James hadn’t ever seen his friend like this. Somehow he didn’t even look like himself, and James wasn’t entirely sure if he liked it. He was so...pliant. Obedient. Immediately lifted his head and flopped his tongue out in wait for whatever he was told. Remus was in a different state too. So demanding, and yet James felt himself moving with the same obedience that Sirius had, to complete whatever task was asked of him. He dropped his jeans at the door, hastily crawling across the bed and he barely waited a second before fucking into Sirius’ mouth, all because Remus had told him to. God what a mouth. That had been the start of this, and somehow it brought them closer together.</p>
<p>More often than not, James and Sirius would flip back and forth between the role of partners and siblings.They’d spontaneously shove each other in the halls to get the other to fall, and laugh about it, and then a few short minutes later, they’d be lazily setting kisses across each other’s jaws. Now, with Remus stood furious in the doorway, they were more like brothers than lovers again. Nervously shuffling on their feet to try and get the other into the firing line of Remus’ anger. Remus on the other hand was just trying to make sense of the shit show he’d walked in on. In trying to clean up the mess, they’d only managed to make it a thousand times worse, and he wondered why in the hell they hadn’t just used their wands. He knew why. James’ mum. When they were at home she made them clean the muggle way, it was supposed to teach them patience or something, but right now, it was teaching Remus that he was dating two absolute idiots.</p>
<p>“Knees. Both of you.”</p>
<p>It was like a switch flicked in both their heads. Both of them dropped everything in their hands to fall to their knees in the perfect submissive position. Arses sank back to rest on their feet, open palms upward and settled on their thighs, eyes lowered to the ground. Remus snapped into his dominant persona so quickly, it was hard to imagine that he was ever this soft creature wrapped up in oversized jumpers, reading a book. When he delivered a sharp tone like that, they knew better than to dare look up at him. There was the gentle sound of Remus’ feet crossing the dorm room, likely inspecting the damage. The silence was almost painful while both boys waited to find out what their punishments would be. Across the room the sound of Remus’ bedside drawer opening filled the room, and the hair on both their necks stood up. It was a very distinct sound. It creaked slightly with the weight of its contents. Things that caused pleasure. Things that caused pain. Things that did both at the same time. Each of the boys had their favourites, but neither of them had expected Remus to appear in front of them with two heavy lengths of rope.</p>
<p>“If you can’t sit still for five minutes, I’ll make you.”</p>
<p>Sirius wanted to look over at James to gauge his reaction, but he wouldn’t move until he was told to, and even then he doubted that looking anywhere aside from at Remus was a good idea. He knew there was a heavy leather paddle in that drawer and the last time it came out, sitting down had been almost impossible for a full three days. James was called up first. The sharp bite of his name caused him to scramble up to his feet and Sirius craned his neck a little to try and catch a glimpse at what was going on. Bloody hair, obscuring his vision. What he could hear though, was Remus’ orders.</p>
<p>Strip.<br/>Hands in front of you.<br/>Palms together.<br/>Turn.<br/>Bend over.<br/>Kneel.</p>
<p>Every now and again, an order was accented with the sound of James’ moan, a sound Sirius had come to love as much as Remus’. It felt like a lifetime of his knees aching with the pressure of his weight on them, pressed against the hard floor, and then his name was called. He quickly followed suit, lifting to his feet abruptly. He did an instinctive cast of his eyes around the room and yet...no James. Odd. He hadn’t heard the door open, so where the hell had -. He was quickly dragged out of his thoughts by Remus’ voice.</p>
<p>“Eyes on me, not on the room. Strip.”</p>
<p>He obliged easily, hands coming up over his head to tug the t-shirt off, folding it neatly as he knew he was supposed to. Jeans came next, and shoes to follow. Then it was his turn and he finally saw what James had seen first. It wasn’t a bad feeling, just...odd. The rope was soft, circling his wrists and spiralling up his forearms. Remus had him turn and the sharp tug forced his hands into his chest as though he were praying. His skin felt cold,  but he was vaguely aware of the fact that he was sweating, and he knew why. He’d caught sight of James finally. There he was, suspended from the ceiling, tied in the most intricate rope pattern, eyes fluttering closed. The steady rise and fall of his chest was causing one certain length of rope to brush ever so gently against his hardened cock. Not enough pressure to be of any use, but enough to send a shock wave of static over the surface of his skin every time. God, he looked beautiful like that and Sirius wanted to lick the precum off of his stomach, he looked so delectable. Finally he understood why it’d taken so long for Remus to be done, every now and again, he’d stumble on the way a knot was supposed to go before he’d correct himself, though Sirius wasn’t complaining. It didn’t hurt at all, but he was very aware of every single length of rope. The way it rubbed against his skin, and should he move the wrong way, it’d pinch. Wand out, Remus levitated him up to one of the hooks they’d put in the ceiling. It was supposed to be for a swing, James idea, but it seemed as though they were multi-purpose.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back in half an hour, maybe more.”</p>
<p>Sirius pulled in a sharp breath as though he were about to ask a question, but the rope shifted just so, forcing a knot in the rope against the tight pucker of his entrance and his words trailed off into a moan instead. By the time he’d gathered his thoughts, Remus was gone.</p>
<p>Half an hour. Bound. Suspended from the ceiling like meat in a butcher shop. That was their punishment. He felt worthless. He loved it.</p>
<p>James lazily let his head rock to one side to look at the other, offering a soft smile. He was doing his best to maintain some sort of composure, but the rope...God the rope. He'd made a flippant comment about it a few days ago. Something about how interesting it looked. He couldn’t decide if it was something he wanted to try, or something he wanted someone to try on him. That was how their relationship worked. Sirius was the sub, every time. He thrived of of things being done with or to him. Remus was always the dom, and James couldn’t imagine it any other way, and then there was James, who had a tendency to switch. At times like this, he couldn’t imagine why he’d ever thought that being in a relationship with Sirius would be a bad idea. He was beautiful. Utterly relaxed in his restraint, breathing deeply to try and find the ways in which he could get even the slightest bit of pleasure from the rope.</p>
<p>“God, I wish I could fuck you.”<br/>“Don’t, Prongs, I’m already hard enough.”<br/>“No, I mean it. You look beautiful like this. Your cock looks fucking stunning, it’s making my mouth water.”<br/>“James -”<br/>“Would you like that, Pads? Remus tugging at the rope while you fuck my mouth?”<br/>“Merlin...”</p>
<p>It can’t have been longer than fifteen minutes and Sirius already wanted out. His cock was painfully hard, every brush of that blasted rope made him jolt with pleasure. He just wanted to rut against it, and now he had the image of James’ lips around his cock and he just wanted to move. James looked like the picture of bliss. Perfectly content in just hanging there. Sirius shifted a little, doing his best to arch a little in the binding, no such luck. He shifted again. No dice. Once more, and finally something did shift, but not in the way he wanted it to. He only managed a half a yelp when he knocked a knot out of place, giving the rest of the rope some slack, only to tighten again around his neck, and Jesus fuck he was stuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!</p>
<p>It took James a second realise what was happening, it was all too quick and when he'd turned his head, Sirius’ mouth was already stretched open while he desperately tried to drag in a breath. James felt his heart drop like a lead weight into his stomach and he moved only half an inch before realising that he could be preparing himself for the same fate, and then what would they do. So instead, he turned his head toward the door and screamed like he never had in his life.</p>
<p>“Remus! Remus! Fuck...Remus! It’s okay, Pads. You’re okay. He’s coming, just try to relax. He’s coming. Remus! God, Remus!”</p>
<p>Try to relax. It was probably very valid advice, but how the fuck was he supposed to do that. He couldn’t breathe, and his body wanted to react. His muscles burned with the effort of trying to move against the rope, even his fingertips was stretching upwards trying to relieve even the slightest bit of pressure from the tightness around his neck, but there was no give. The more he thrashed, the tighter it constricted and James’ frantic screams sounded a little more muffled than they had before. Shit.</p>
<p>“Nonono. Sirius. Open your eyes! He’s coming, Sirius. Sirius! Fuck! Remus, please!”</p>
<p>James couldn’t afford to panic too, but he couldn’t keep screaming either. His throat felt raw, it could have only been a few minutes, but it felt like hours. He felt like he couldn’t breathe too. Chest heaving with the effort of calling both boyfriends’ names and doing his best to stop the tears that had started streaming down his face. He barely noticed when the door swung open.</p>
<p>“I told you to w-”<br/>“Help him! Fucking get him down, Remus, please!”<br/>“Oh my...Sirius? Sirius!”</p>
<p>The next few moments felt as though they somehow happened both fast and slow. Remus’ trembling hands reached into his robes for his wand. Sirius came down first, limp body settling gently down the ground, and then James, the ropes slackening upon their decent. James frantically shoved the rope off of him, the thought of it touching him suddenly made his skin crawl and he couldn’t bare it. He scrambled across the floor to where Remus has Sirius’ head in his lap, roughly slapping the boys cheek. James was willing himself to stop sobbing, but he couldn’t help it. Every time he took a slow breath to try and stop, another choked sob came out.</p>
<p>“How long was he like that?”<br/>“I was screaming for you, why didn’t you come back?”<br/>“James-”<br/>“I couldn’t move, I couldn’t help him. I couldn’t fucking do anything.”<br/>“James! Focus. How long.”<br/>“I...I don’t know. Fucking ages. It felt like ages.”<br/>“Shit. Sirius? Sirius, come on pup. I need you to open your eyes okay? Fuck...Sirius. C’mon.”<br/>“He’s not...Merlin, tell me he’s not. I can’t...”</p>
<p>It felt like an eternity before Sirius suddenly jolted, pulling in a ragged breath, and while he was suddenly breathing, the two other men in the room had stopped.</p>
<p>“Pads?”<br/>“Pup...can you hear me?”<br/>“...Fuck...do that again.”</p>
