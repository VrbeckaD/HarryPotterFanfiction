    <p>On October 12, 1976, James Potter asks Lily Evans out for the 78<sup>th</sup>time. He is standing and she is seated by the lake with her friends, chatting and enjoying the cool autumn air. She looks up at him after he asks and shakes her head wearily.</p><p>“Potter, this is absurd,” she says, sounding exasperated. “Can’t you just get over it, already?”</p><p>James grins and waggles his eyebrows at her. “Maybe it would help if you let me get under you first?”</p><p>“<em>Ugh</em>.” Lily rolls her green eyes so hard it looks painful, but one side of her mouth tugs upward in the barest hint of a smile. She quickly suppresses it, and with a wave of her wand, sends James flying twenty feet backwards and into the lake fully clothed.</p><p>He flails and comes up gasping for air. The sixth-year Gryffindor girls burst into cheers and raucous applause, and Lily gathers her things and marches away. Marlene McKinnon and Mary MacDonald follow her, giggling.</p><p>James drags himself back to land, where Peter Pettigrew is dumbstruck, but Sirius Black is literally roaring with laughter and Remus Lupin is shaking his head with an amused expression on his face. “Why do you antagonize her?” Remus asks. “It never ends well.”</p><p>Wringing out his robes, James grins at his friends and shrugs. He’s thinking of that smirk on Lily’s lips just before she tossed him in the lake.</p><p>“Totally worth it.”</p>
