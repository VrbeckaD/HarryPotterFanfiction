    <p>            “Severus, there you are. I have been looking for you everywhere,” Albus approached in his bright purple robes, never dropping his grandfatherly smile at scowl the potions teacher was giving him.</p>
<p>            Severus liked to believe he was observant, with the headmaster only speaking to him when necessary, he reasoned the headmaster wanted something of him. “What may I help you with, Albus?” Still scowling, he knew if he didn't just get whatever Albus wanted over with, he would never get back to brewing his potions. The school year had just started, and he needed to refill the hospital wing. The dour man continued to wait for the headmaster until finally he came to a stop, not four feet from the professor.</p>
<p>            “Harry potter has just sent an owl saying he was unable to board the train. I need you to go pick him up from his relatives’ home.”</p>
<p>            Severus’ face darkened at the mention of the Potter boy. “What, so he thinks he too special to ride the train like everyone else, that he just wants special treatment because he's the boy-who-lived?” He practically growled the last part. The boy was probably just like his father, too up in the clouds with his ego and always wanting to be the center of attention. He thought the spoiled brat should just stay where he was and not even bother to come to Hogwarts if he didn’t want to board the train with the other students.</p>
<p>            Smile never wavering, Albus continued to speak,” Come on now, Severus, my boy. I just need you to go pick him up. In the letter he wrote there was something holding him back from coming on the train. I bet there was a reasonable excuse for it.” Hoping that the man would do as he asked, the headmaster added a little more twinkle to his eyes.</p>
<p>            “Why can't Minerva do it, he will just end up in her house anyway? I am also too busy right now to do so.”</p>
<p>            “I sent Minerva right now on an errand for me, she'll be busy for quite a while.”</p>
<p>            Severus plaintively relented and after taking the letter with the address from the man, turned around and stalked off, robes bellowing behind him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            Harry could hear movement around the house, knowing that his relatives would be getting ready for the day. He continued to stay lying down on the floor of his cupboard, hoping they will be gone soon so he could leave the small room. The room barely held his small frame, on most nights he would have to lay in a fetal position to fit semi-comfortably. Finally, after what Harry would guess an hour, he heard three sets of feet shuffling towards the front door. He could hear his aunts high-pitched voice ring through the house, warning him of stealing any food or dirtying the house.</p>
<p>            After being sure that the car was gone, Harry crawled to his knees, feeling around with his hands for the door and pushing it open. He knew after the letter came for him, that his relatives would be harsher, no one ever saw him or knew about him. His uncle Vernon beat him more than usual afterwards, his back ended up blooded and shredded, not helping that he was then thrown back into his cupboard. They now gave him food every other day, hiding it when they were gone so he wouldn’t be able to find it easily. Harry didn’t even know what the letter said, only that him and the other ‘freaks’ were to pay.  </p>
<p>            It took weeks for Harry to sneak out and find someone to read him the letter, so he could have some answers. He found a woman at the park not far from his house, she was a nice lady. The woman, Arabella Figgs’, read the letter to him, never laughed or thinking it was a prank. He didn’t know what she thought of the letter, but he knew it to be true. He knew that the strange things that his relatives didn’t like made him special, his aunt would never like it and always told his uncle about it. Beatings became regular after he ended up on the schools’ roof, it wasn't until he was 10 that they became less frequent. Harry was ecstatic with the name he could put to his specialness, wizard. Hogwarts sounded like a dream come true to him, getting away from his family was an extra bonus.</p>
<p>            After finding the owl who sent the original letter, Harry quickly scribbled a reply, hoping that the words were legible enough to read.  It was only until the day before the train would come that his uncle came home angry about some promotion going to another man, and beat him more than normal. It had prevented him from sneaking out of the house to board the train. He knew that he would need the supplies listed, but he had hoped that the professors would help him gather them when he got there.</p>
<p>            For the rest of the day, Harry felt depressed that he would not be able to go to Hogwarts and away from his blasted relatives. Stretching his legs and walking to the backyard, he hoped to get some sun before his relatives got home. His mind was void of thought as he laid on the slightly damp grass and just listened to the sounds around him. It wasn’t until he heard an owl hooting that it occurred to him that he could still go to Hogwarts if he wrote a letter for someone to come get him. Quickly heading inside to find some scrap paper and pencil, Harry forgot about the step up on the backdoor and feel to his knees. Not one to waste time, he hurried to his feet and rushed to the kitchen. After finding the materials in a drawer, he began to scribble down a quick, vague explanation on his absence. Once down he rushed to where he last remembered the owl to be.</p>
<p>            Quickly finding him in the backyards tree, Harry whistled and reached out his arm for the owl to land on. “Can you take this to Hogwarts for me, it is very important that you give it to the headmaster or one of the professors,” his voice small but to the point. The owl grabbed the paper with his talons and nipped at his fingers before taking off. The days stress rushes from his body and he slumps to the ground, only to hear his uncles’ car pulling into the driveway. Adrenaline rushes through his body as he surely but quietly enters the house and back into his cupboard. Heart in his throat, Harry only hopes they didn’t find out he was outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            He was on his way to the gates of the school to apparate to the known address of one Harry Potter. He still couldn’t believe that Dumbledore was sending him to pick up the boy whose father tormented him in school. Almost to the gates, Severus finally looks down at the scrap paper of a letter the brat sent with his address on it. The write was atrocious, words looked as though they were thrown on top of each other. The boy probably thought that he was going to have it easy at school and that work would not apply to him, if his handwriting was as it was.  At the gates, Severus put the letter away and disapparated from the schools’ soil.</p>
<p>            Appearing on the street of privet drive, the potions teacher quickly made his way to house number four. He was disgusted with the overly average looking homes, every one of them the same no matter how many he passed. The worst was the house of Harry Potter, it screamed ‘we are normal, see?’. The perfectly cut lawn, looking as if a ruler was used to measure it, and the perfectly weeded flower beds followed greasy man to the door. Wanting to quickly get the brat and leave, he knocked a sturdy three knocks.</p>
