    <p>Severus Snape’s brows drew together in a fierce scowl as he turned from the inventory he’d been taking of his potions closet and stepped into the hallway. He’d heard a high pitched shriek echoing through the dungeon a moment ago but students weren’t due to return to Hogwarts for another two weeks.</p>
<p>“Leave <i>off</i>, Monaghan,” an exasperated voice said from somewhere close by.</p>
<p>“You need to get over your fears, Boyd. I’m just trying to help you out is all,” came the amused reply.</p>
<p>“You’re just trying to be a complete git is what, and you’re succeeding admirably.”</p>
<p>Snape heard Monaghan’s amused snort and then the two men came around the corner, stopping short as they realized they weren’t alone in the corridor. Snape stared down his nose at them.</p>
<p>“Er…hullo. Severus Snape, yeah?” said the slightly taller of the two men. Snape could tell it was Monaghan by the English accent; Boyd’s voice had held a distinctly Scottish lilt.</p>
<p>“You were, perhaps, expecting someone else in the Slytherin dungeons two weeks before school was in session?” Snape said disdainfully, his eyebrow arching.</p>
<p>“Mate, one never knows what the dungeons of Slytherin hold,” Monaghan smirked.</p>
<p>“I’m not your ‘mate,’” Snape sneered, over-enunciating the ‘t.’</p>
<p>“Not yet anyway,” Monaghan said, his smirk transforming into a cheeky grin as he offered his hand. “Dominic Monaghan, Care of Magical Creatures.”</p>
<p>Snape’s lip curled in distaste and, after a few moments, Monaghan let his hand drop back to his side with a shrug. Snape then turned his cool gaze on to Boyd. Clear green eyes met his as Boyd stood, head cocked to the side, studying Snape.</p>
<p>“Billy Boyd. I’ll be teaching Charms this year.” He did not extend his hand, only stood there calmly under the ferocity of Snape’s scowl.</p>
<p>“You are in my dungeons why, exactly?”</p>
<p>“As to that,” Boyd said, his cupid’s bow lips curling into a smile, “we were re-familiarizing ourselves with the lay of the land.”</p>
<p>Monaghan snorted. “Also, we need some polyjuice potion so that if we get caught somewhere we aren’t supposed to be, we can conveniently make it look like someone else is breaking the rules. Figured you’d be the bloke could fix us up, yeah?”</p>
<p>Snape blinked, managing to convey his utter contempt in the small motion.</p>
<p>“That’s quite the ability you’ve got there,” Monaghan laughed as he nudged Boyd with his elbow. “C’mon, Billy, let’s go see Hagrid.”</p>
<p>Boyd’s smile widened to a grin. “Oh please, Dom. You know you’re more interested in Fang.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Dom replied with his own grin. “See you around, Severus Snape,” he added with a jaunty wave as he strolled past the potions master.</p>
<p>Boyd stood there a moment longer, his green eyes sparkling up at Snape. “You get used to him,” he said, clearly amused by the antics of his friend.</p>
<p>“I’d have to care first,” Snape drawled as he turned and headed back into the closet. He pretended not to hear the soft laughter that followed him.<a name="cutid1-end" rel="nofollow" id="cutid1-end"></a></p>
