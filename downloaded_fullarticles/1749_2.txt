    <p>« Come on Al! Hurry up! » Ginny was shouting upstairs for her youngest son.<br/>
Her other children were already outside helping Harry to organize their luggage.<br/>
« I'm coming mom! Sorry that I'm not too excited packing up my whole life and removing it from my childhood home. »<br/>
Ginny sighed. She had known it would be the hardest for Albus to move away, but she had hoped that he could see it as a new opportunity.<br/>
Albus came trotting down the stars. Two suitcases in his hands he took every step very consciously, he was making his last time walking down the stairs very dramatical.<br/>
« Al, » Ginny felt sorry for him, « Don’t make it so hard for us. I know that you will love Hogwarts and-« <br/>
« Of course I’ll love Hogwarts! But you know what? » Albus was screaming desperately, his voice getting pitchier with each word. « I would have loved it much more two years ago, when I could have gone there as a first grader like its supposed to be! I will look like an idiot! Like we only just figured out: Oh, Albus is a wizard! He should go to Hogwarts! Like his parents! »<br/>
Ginny had not seen that coming. She had wanted some sort of reaction from Al, who had been really quiet, not very ok with the whole situation but rather calm, this was just not like him. And that broke her heart.<br/>
« I’m sorry Al. » She said and went outside.<br/>
Al stared at his mother leaving him behind in their house - well, in their soon to be former house. He wondered what she’d meant with being sorry. Probably that she and his Dad had made the decision to move back to England and to have the Potter children attend Hogwarts on their own.<br/>
They had been selfish, in Albus words.<br/>
He had reached the bottom of the stairs and knew that he had to go. He didn't want his parents to feel bad because of him and if he were being utterly honest, he knew that he wouldn't leave too many things behind. Just the house and his own room that he had lived in since he was three years old. His siblings had to leave their friends too. Al didn’t. So why was he the one complaining?<br/>
He walked towards the door, trying to have a last look at just everything familiar, taking in the sounds of the creaking ceiling and the smell of wood and ash.<br/>
He would miss this place, he was certain.<br/>
Outside, everyone was already in the car, except for his Dad.<br/>
Ginny and Harry had insisted that they should go by plane and not like any normal wizard by portkey: « It’ll be fun! Doing it the Muggle-way! » Albus had remarked that it wouldn't really be like muggle would do it, since they were able to shrink all of their belongings to fit into some suitcases, but Harry had shook his head and grinned. « Adventure, Albus! » he had said, « You gotta embrace it ! »<br/>
Now Harry was waiting for Albus to put his luggage in the remaining space of the car.<br/>
Al could sense his father watching him and knew that he probably wanted to talk to him about what he’d said to his mom.<br/>
« Al? » Harry asked calm.<br/>
« Dad.. »<br/>
« I want you to be happy Albus. Do you know that? »<br/>
« I guess. »<br/>
« Well, Al. It’s true. And I know that you think that tearing you away from here and forcing you to go to Hogwarts, a complete strange territory for you, is doing exactly the opposite. But to be honest, I don’t think that you were happy here. You are lonely. » Harry’s voice sounds sad, Al hates it.<br/>
« Dad, I’m ok. I’m afraid that nothing will change, though. I mean the going to Hogwarts part. It won’t change who I am. I am weird. People just find me strange and don’t like me. »<br/>
« That’s not true! » His father sounds indignant. « Al, I won’t believe that! You are an extraordinary, special person! You are so talented and smart and thoughtful- I just won’t believe that people don’t like you. If you’d give them a chance to get to know you Al, they would love you. »<br/>
There were tears forming in both Albus’ and Harry’s eyes.<br/>
Al whispers: « Then why am I alone? »<br/>
Harry embraces his son, the one that looks the most like him, with his wild darkish hair, the blue eyes and his whole physique.<br/>
« You are not alone, my boy. I am here and your mum is and so are your siblings! We all love you for who you are. But sometimes it’s hard for us because you never show us who you are. Who you really are. We would love to get to know you! We are your family, don't shut us out. We won't judge you. »<br/>
Albus is sobbing now, clinging to his fathers body.<br/>
It’s my fault, he thinks. I am broken, I can’t make people like me, because I’m horrible. Even my own Dad thinks that something is wrong with me.<br/>
« Everything will be worse in Hogwarts, » he manages to say in between taking deep breaths to keep him from hyperventilating.<br/>
« No, Al. Hogwarts will be the best thing that could happen to you! It will lead you to the future you are designed to live. »<br/>
« No, Dad. Everyone will think that I am like you and they will expect me to be like you, be a hero and do heroic things and be happy and have lots of friends and play Quidditch and be a good Gryffindor and accelerate  in just being Harry Potters son! »<br/>
Harry was shocked hearing this. He knew it was hard for Albus because he looked so much like him, but hearing him actually say all his worries out loud, was near to unbearable for the loving father.<br/>
« Al, you can be whoever you want to be! Just be happy. Be the happiest version of you! No one who counts expects you to do heroic things - well, Mum and I wouldn't mind if you were good in school - but most of all we want you to be happy. Have fun with your friends. People you can count on for the rest of your live, people who love you for exactly who you are. »<br/>
« This sounds like a fairytale, Dad. But I’m not a child anymore. »<br/>
« For me, you are! You will always be. We are wizards, Al. This can’t mean that we stop believing in magical things, just because they are an everyday thing for us! »<br/>
« Ehm, Dad? » Albus wasn’t sure what exactly his Dad had meant.<br/>
« I’m just trying to say, well. Don’t stop believing in all the possibilities. There are things you can’t imagine waiting for you at Hogwarts. Don’t expect too much or you will miss all the things that just happen. »<br/>
They hugged for a few moments more and then they moved towards the car.<br/>
Albus couldn't deny that he was much more confused than before the talk with his Dad, but he also felt a bit better. Maybe because he could relate to his Dads stumbling for the right words and the strangeness of his speech.<br/>
« Can we go already? » his younger sister Lily said, looking rather annoyed.<br/>
« I think we can. » Said Harry, looking at his wife and then at his kids, smiling.<br/>
He started the car, took one last look at their old house through the back mirror, sighed and drove off.<br/>
Albus was tired, his eyes hurt from crying and his heart and head was in a turmoil but he wanted to see his old home disappear from his view. Maybe it would be the last time he would see this place.<br/>
Albus wasn’t the only one staring at their old house as long as they still could see it, all of the Potters were, except for Harry who had to look at the street. Nobody said a word. After all, they all would leave a place called home behind today. No matter how they felt about new beginnings, this was an ending and those were always hard.</p>
