    <p>The Burrow was the best place to be for the summer, Ophelia Fawley decided, leaning on the bottom half of the dutch door that lead from the kitchen to the yard beyond. It was early in the morning, but the world outside was already awake. The blooming garden was buzzing with bees and rustling with gnomes. The sky was blue, and the sun gently warmed everything it touched. In the distance beyond the property, a small lake sparkled while nearby trees swayed lazily. The shrill cry of birds broke the otherwise serene silence, a perfect distraction from the unopened envelope clutched in her hands. The tawny owl that had delivered it was still perched next to her, its familiar large black eyes boring into her, as if it were just as anxious to know its contents as she was. Ophelia reached out a hand and scratched the owl’s head gently, letting it nibble at her fingers affectionately in response.</p><p>The sound of footsteps thundering down the stairs behind her broke her from her reverie, an indication that she was no longer the only one awake in the house. Three redheaded boys rounded the corner and darted through the kitchen, disturbing Ophelia and the owl as they barreled through the door and into the yard.</p><p>“Fred, George, give it back!” the tallest of the three shouted angrily, his face so flushed that it threatened to disappear into his overgrown ginger hair. Identical cheshire grins flashed over the younger boys’ respective shoulders in response, trading off an unopened envelope between them as their brother tried and failed to catch them. No doubt, he had just received a similar letter to the one Ophelia was gripping to her chest.</p><p>“Oh George, can you imagine if Charles here got anything less than 12 O.W.L.S? Mum would have to disown him,” cackled one of the smaller boys, handing the envelope off to his twin as he dodged his older brother’s desperate grasp.</p><p>“Why Fred, I do believe that would be the disappointment of the century!” the other brother called back, managing to quickly duck two strong arms swiping at him. Charlie Weasley looked up at Ophelia, a silent plea for help on his face as his younger brothers danced around him, waving his examination results around his face but refusing to give them up. Ophelia help up the envelope containing her own results, showing the unbroken seal. She tried to offer an expression of sympathy, that her own results also lay in a state of academic limbo.</p><p>“Fred, George!” a voice called from immediately behind Ophelia. She hadn’t heard anyone else enter the room behind her. Ophelia turned to see the eldest Weasley brother call out to the yard, his expression one of unyieldingly stern disapproval. The twins’ heads turned, and in their distraction, Charlie managed to yank his envelope from Fred’s hand. The twins, recognizing the fun was over, scurried back into the house and up the stairs, leaving Ophelia, Charlie, and Bill standing at the doorway to the kitchen.</p><p>“Thanks,” Charlie grumbled to Bill, making his way to the dining table and sitting down. The envelope was a little bent out of shape from its excursion into the garden, but the wax seal that kept the contents a mystery was still intact. He turned to looked at Ophelia , a strain of worry darkening his usually carefree expression. “What if I didn’t get enough O.W.L.s? What if I didn’t get Care of Magical Creatures?” he asked in a low voice. “Fred and George are right, Bill got 12, I can’t compete with that.”</p><p>Ophelia offered an encouraging smile, fiddling mindlessly at the wax on her envelope. “Jacob got 12” she said, hoping she sounded helpful in some way. “You’re not the only one with an older brother whose legacy precedes you.”</p><p>“At least your brother isn’t breathing down your neck while you compare legacies” Charlie grumbled, jerking his head to gesture towards Bill, who was indeed hovering over him expectantly, but was visibly refraining from pressuring his brother into revealing his exam results.</p><p>More footsteps came from the stairwell, and Mrs. Weasley turned the corner into the room. She smiled warmly at Ophelia as she made her way to the stovetop and set the kettle. “Sorry Ophelia dear, I hope the boys didn’t wake you up” Mrs. Weasley said apologetically, gesturing towards the stairs where George and Fred and run back up a moment before with her free hand while her wand summoned several pans towards her.</p><p>“I was already up, no worries” Ophelia replied, trying to keep her voice chipper despite the anxiety that was gnawing away at her insides the longer she left her envelope unopened. “O.W.L. results arrived,” she added, tossing her letter onto the table next to Charlie’s as she took a seat next to him. Bill still stood over the two, practically buzzing with anticipation. Mrs. Weasley whipped around quickly, her wide eyes darting between the two sealed envelopes on the table.</p><p>“Both of yours? Well go on, open them!” she said excitedly, walking around the table to stand next to Bill so that she would be able to see the results over Ophelia and Charlie’s shoulders. Ophelia and Charlie both reached for their letters, carefully detaching the wax seal as slowly as possible. Ophelia could feel Mrs. Weasley nearly bouncing behind her, her eyes fixed on the letter in Charlie’s hands. Ophelia turned her attention to her own letter. She unfolded it gingerly, as if afraid that it might explode if mishandled. Silence fell throughout the kitchen, broken only by the sounds of unfolding parchment and the distant creaking of overhead floorboards as the 4 of them read through the results.</p><p> </p><p><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6a33a06aef8f64c787242793fe0c823/6cbb1a847ea828dc-1b/s1280x1920/17b8826951cb396904445cd4f92be86cd0dd299e.png" alt="Ophelia's OWL results" width="843" height="746" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3364093521" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/><br/>
 </p><p> </p><p>Ophelia let out a low breath that she hadn’t been aware she was holding. 10 O.W.L.s was a commendable feat, but a persistent little voice at the back of her brain kept chanting <em>Jacob got 12</em>. Whatever. Jacob wasn’t here. These were her results, and no one else’s.</p><p>“Your middle name’s ‘Cordeline’?” an incredulous voice at her ear asked cheekily, and Ophelia turned to see that the twins had stealthily reentered the room. George was hovering at her shoulder while Fred was situated at Charlie’s opposite shoulder, surprisingly close considering how unnoticed they had been.</p><p>“Your middle name’s ‘Septimus’??” Fred echoed from Charlie’s side, as if this was really news to him. Charlie glowered and batted away the young boys with his results. Charlie then turned to Ophelia, his own results held out to compare alongside her’s. He’d only gotten 8 O.W.L.s, although admittedly she’d taken one more subject than he had, and he had bested her in Care of Magical Creatures with an O. Not that that particular score had come at any surprise to her. There were no other Os on his results.</p><p>“10! That’s brilliant!” Bill said enthusiastically, clapping Ophelia on the back as he read through her results. “Rakepick’ll be pleased with that Defense Against the Dark Arts score” He added, pointing a long finger between the subject on the paper and the corresponding grade she had received. Ophelia flushed a little with pride while her attention strayed back to Charlie’s results. She had no idea how she had managed an O in potions (with credit to Penny where credit was due), although she was a little dismayed to see that Charlie hadn’t managed to score well enough to continue potions or history of magic with her.</p><p>More footsteps rang from the stairwell and soon they were joined by Mr. Weasley and Percy, who eyed the group at the table reading the open letters with a quizzical expression, before comprehension dawned on each of their faces. Mrs. Weasley made room at her side for her husband to read their son’s results, while Percy displaced Bill on Charlie’s other side, leaving Bill and Ophelia at the outskirts of the huddle. Mr. Weasley let out a stream of delighted gasps and proud murmurs, while Percy scoffed softly as his eyes darted down the page.</p><p>Ophelia reviewed her O.W.L.s yet again, experiencing simultaneous feelings of pride and frustration. She hadn’t received any failing scores, and she was grateful for that, but her scores and her memory of taking the exams reflected how close she had come to not passing Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and History of Magic. Failing any of those would have cut short her aspirations of being a curse-breaker. <em>Jacob got 12</em>. Well Jacob was a stinking genius, wasn’t he…</p><p>In her peripheral vision she saw Bill sit at the table in the seat next to her. The tight-knit cluster in the kitchen had begun to disperse. Mrs. Weasley resumed breakfast preparation, Fred and George hurtled back up the narrow stairs, and Mr. Weasley continued to review Charlie’s scores with him while Percy hovered from the other side. Ophelia looked at Bill’s encouraging and proud smile, and for the first time since that morning she felt a true wave of relief. As Bill had said, she had gotten more than enough O.W.L.s to pursue a career in curse-breaking.</p><p>“8 O.W.L.S, that’s really great, son” Mr. Weasley reiterated, handing Charlie back his results before stepping further into the kitchen to help his wife with the cooking.</p><p>“I’m going to get 12, like Bill” Percy said to no one in particular, his voice dripping with unmerited smugness. When no one responded, he silently excused himself and followed Fred and George back up the stairs and out of sight. Ophelia couldn’t stop rereading her results, even though she was sure she could recite them from memory if she had to at this point. She felt like a heavy weight had been released from her chest, and up until now she had been having a hard time articulating exactly why this meant so much. O.W.L.s held the promise of a career and a future, and Ophelia had admittedly not given too much thought to a future beyond freeing Jacob from the 4<sup>th</sup> vault and then… well that was all she had really planned for, to be honest. She had clung to the idea of becoming a curse-breaker when she left school after constant encouragement from Patricia Rakepick and Bill. Even Professor Flitwick had offered encouragement and praise when she had sat for her career advice session last year. It felt like a natural progression, from cursed kid to curse breaker. With scores like these, at least she wouldn’t have to make other plans right now.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>“Charlie, I’m really no good on a broom,” Ophelia insisted helplessly as Charlie pushed a weather-worn cleansweep into her hands. At the other end of the yard Fred and George were flying circles around a 9-year-old Ronald, who was swatting at them from his own shooting star. The training broom refused to climb higher than 10 feet, and its speed was no match for butterflies passing him in the wind.</p><p>“Rubbish, I’ve seen you in flying class, you’ve got your bearings about you” Charlie reassured her encouragingly. Before Ophelia could argue that she had required his assistance every single time they flew into the forbidden forest during their 4<sup>th</sup> year, Charlie had mounted his own broom and was rising to join an already airborne Bill. Side by side, Bill definitely did not look as comfortable on a broom as Charlie did, but Charlie had insisted that was what made the teams even. Fred and George were certainly talented enough to join the school team, as they both enthusiastically hoped to do, and Ron had been flying since he was 6. Unfortunately, his remarkably slow broom offset any experience and agility he possessed. Charlie had deemed that those 3 matched against Hogwarts’ brand-new Gryffindor quidditch captain and reigning seeker, yours truly, paired with 2 nerds who considered staying airborne to be a feat within itself, to be a fair lineup.</p><p>Ophelia grumbled and kicked off, taking a few wobbly laps around their end of the yard to refamiliarize herself with the feeling of flying. Her stomach lurched in protest, and it took all the core strength she had to not roll over sideways. She hadn’t taken a flying class in nearly 4 years, and she certainly never flew when she wasn’t at school. Charlie saying that she had her bearings about her was a liberal overstatement. She eventually settled herself in front of the single goal hoop on her side, playing the keeper’s position opposite Ron. Ideally, the less she had to move, the better. Young Ginny watched forlornly from the kitchen door, enviously eyeing her brothers as they flew and laughed around the yard. Ophelia would have gladly given her position up to Ginny if she weren’t so scared for the 7-year-old girl against several teenage boys.</p><p>Charlie swooped back down to the house, picking up an extremely worn leather ball from a trunk near the house. Without bludgers or a snitch, this game would effectively be a matter of keep-away and goal-scoring. Ophelia was grateful that she wouldn’t have to worry about bludgers trying to take her off her broom in addition to her own imbalance, but it did put more pressure on her a goalkeeper. With one graceful toss into the air and a broom mount so quick that Ophelia would have missed it if she had blinked, the 3-on-3 match commenced.</p><p>Watching the Weasleys fly together really contrasted how inexperienced she was on a broom; she refused to take even a single hand off her broom for more than a few seconds at a time and had subsequently let several easy goals past the solitary hoop she was supposed to be defending. To her team’s merit, quidditch prodigy Charlie was showing no mercy against his 9-year-old brother, and was making up for Ophelia’s deficiency in hoop defense by scoring goal after goal against his brothers. Between her useless hovering and Bill’s agile but overly-cautious flying, she was sure that Charlie could probably take on all of his brothers at once on his own and still win.</p><p>It was with an immense sigh of relief that Ophelia lowered herself to the ground as Mrs. Weasley called her family in for supper. She felt a little embarrassed for her poor performance in front of her close friends, but the Weasleys were all chatting happily amongst themselves as they gathered up the brooms and the old quaffle to put them away. It was apparent that the score had stopped mattering some time ago, and everything since then had just been showing off. Ophelia felt a small twang of jealously as she watched the brothers excitedly discuss their game.</p><p>She’d lived a fairly solitary life since Jacob had disappeared almost 7 years ago. Between her mother, who kept Ophelia and herself locked in the house most of the time out of paranoia, her cat Serafina, and the tawny owl she had unceremoniously inherited in Jacob’s absence, she was suddenly starkly aware of how unquestioningly isolated she had been almost all her life. It was a miracle that she had convinced her mother to spend the summer with the Weasleys at their home in the West Country, so far away from her home in London. She felt guilty knowing that while she and her mother had shared that isolation together in previous years, her mother now had to endure it alone.</p><p>“Were the boys playing too harshly against you, dear?” Mrs. Weasley asked kindly as she set the table. She threw a preemptive warning glance at her sons as they took their seats around the table.</p><p>“No, Mrs. Weasley, I’m really just not great at flying. I’m just there to make them look better,” Ophelia laughed. Ginny looked up at her with a pout.</p><p>“I want to fly with them” she whined, looking pleadingly between her mother and her brothers with large brown eyes.</p><p>“Tell you what, Gin, when I leave then you can have my spot on our team” Bill said kindly, ruffling his sister’s hair. “Honestly, Charlie wouldn’t even notice if I left” he added, punching Charlie in the shoulder. Charlie shrugged in nonverbal agreement, which drew laughter from the table. Ophelia’s heart secretly sank a little. She kept forgetting that Bill would be leaving next week, effectively removing him from her life. She had managed to cling to their time together after his graduation from Hogwarts by staying with the Weasleys, but every passing day drew her closer to saying goodbye to Bill. She laughed with the rest of the family, but her smile reached neither her eyes nor her heart.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>As much as Ophelia had tried desperately to make the most of her time with Bill before he left to pursue his promising career as a curse-breaker in Egypt, the week had managed to slip from her grasp, and before she knew it she found herself waking up only 12 hours before he had to report to Gringotts. From her position on the inflatable mattress in Ginny’s room on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor, she could hear hustle and bustle in the rooms below, indicating she was among the last to wake up for the day. Ginny’s bed had long since been abandoned, and in the interim time had been re-occupied by a slumbering Seraphina.</p><p>Ophelia hauled herself from her covers and pulled on her clothes, groggy from sleep but alert with anxiety. The sun outside the open window was still relatively low in the sky, and Ophelia doubted it was much past 7 in the morning. It was an early start for the household on a weekend, but she had to remind herself that she wasn’t the only one saying goodbye to Bill today.</p><p>The kitchen was crowded with breakfast eaters, and a quick headcount confirmed that Ophelia had indeed been the last to come downstairs that morning. Bill was sitting in the center on one long side of the table, answering a barrage of questions from his youngest siblings. She had barely taken her seat between Percy and Charlie when a plate of eggs and toast was slid directly in front of her. She gave a quiet thanks before she began to nibble numbly on her toast, her eyes blindly fixed on an animated Bill and his excitable brothers. She could hear snatches of conversation about ancient Egyptian monsters and cursed mummies, but everything in between sailed through her consciousness without leaving a mark. What could she even do or say today that would be a worthy goodbye to her best friend, mentor, and, honestly, her surrogate brother? If she drew it out for too long it would be too hard to finally see him off, but if she was too aloof and unemotional then he may leave with a negative sentiment.</p><p>“You alright, ‘Lia?” Charlie asked in a low voice with a mouth full of toast, nudging her gently. Charlie must have noticed that her mouth was moving over the same spot of toast without actually consuming any, while her had eyes glazed over completely. Ophelia blinked several times and furrowed her brow. No one else had noticed her distracted state in between all the nonstop movement and chaos that always occupied The Burrow. What she really needed was some time to speak with Bill alone, but as difficult as that had proved for the last week, it would surely be night impossible on the day he was actually supposed to leave. She quickly made a decision and subtly turned towards Charlie.</p><p>“I’m going to go for a walk,” Ophelia replied in an equally quiet voice before shoveling most of the eggs into her mouth quickly and sweeping the uneaten toast into her hand under the table. “Could you please tell Bill to come find me when he gets a chance?” Charlie’s own brow furrowed in a mix of concern and confusion, but he nodded shortly and quickly turned to draw his father’s attention, giving Ophelia the opportunity to slip out unnoticed.</p><p>The garden was much quieter than the kitchen, the mixed conversations quickly lost beyond the half-open kitchen doorway. Ophelia treaded through the grass, the fresh blades feeling cool and soft between her bare toes. Breakfast resumed in the house behind her, unaware of her absence. Ophelia was incredibly grateful that Charlie was an observant friend, and a loyal one on top of that. She was sure that if Charlie wasn’t able to get Bill out to see her in a timely manner, then he would come outside to find her himself.</p><p>Once she had moved past the garden, she knew she would be out of the line of sight of the kitchen, and from there she began to walk towards the trees that were scattered across the softly rolling hills. At the edge of the property was an especially old and proud-looking oak tree. From one of its stronger branches hung a swinging bench. Ophelia knew from her time with the Weasleys that this tree was favorable for climbing with siblings, but also just as satisfactory for sitting under quietly for long stretches of time just to enjoy the peace. She settled herself on the swinging bench and resumed munching on her swiped toast. Despite it still being relatively early in the morning, the day was warm around her, and the weather was promising to stay idyllic for weeks to come. It was a sharp contrast to the summers she had spent at home with her mother, inside the small apartment they had shared since leaving their house, answering the door with a wand in hand and a security question every single time. She had never resented her mother for her paranoia and overprotectiveness, because in Ophelia’s eyes it was a reasonable response to the trauma she had endured. Nevertheless, that didn’t make it any more enjoyable. This had probably been the first summer in years, if not ever, that she had felt both unrestrained and safe.</p><p>Barely 10 minutes had passed before the soft sound of footfalls through the grass told her that Bill had come to join her. Ophelia smiled at him, a little surprised that Bill had actually detached himself from his family to come.</p><p>“Your squire Charles sent for me?” Bill said in a pompous tone reminiscent of the Gryffindor ghost. Ophelia laughed and scooted down to the end of the bench, making a spot for Bill to occupy.</p><p>“It seemed better than asking for your time in front of your family” Ophelia responded with a shrug. She had really just wanted one last good old-fashioned heart to heart with him before he ran away to another continent to be wildly successful and handsome there instead of here, where she needed him to be. If she had been more blunt with her intentions at the breakfast table, she feared she would have to endure questions and teasing from the younger ones. Even though her intentions were pure and her feelings platonic, she didn’t feel like explaining herself to anyone. Bill sat at the other end of the bench, kicking his feet slightly so the bench swayed softly. They sat in comfortable quiet for a minute. Ophelia wished she could have hours of just this, but Bill’s time was valuable today of all days, and she didn’t have the luxury to spend any of it in silence.</p><p>“I wish you didn’t have to go,” Ophelia said. It was much more direct and admittedly louder than she had thought it would sound in her mind, and it hung in the air between them for a minute before Bill sighed.</p><p>“It’s my dream job, and it’s exciting and challenging and pays really well. I couldn’t have asked for more from Rakepick, and I’m lucky to have this opportunity” Bill said, trying to make the truth as painless as possible. Leaving his family, which was large and close-knit and also conveniently concentrated in the West Country, was one of the harder aspects of taking the job in Egypt. Ophelia was like a sister to him, which meant that leaving her was no different. Ophelia hummed noncommittally as she looked straight ahead, offering neither agreement nor argument. “I’ll visit when I can during holidays, it’s not like I’m leaving forever” Bill continued, but Ophelia still gazed ahead as if she couldn’t hear him. Bill frowned. “What did you wanted to talk about then?” Ophelia finally turned her head to face him, her bright blue eyes meeting his.</p><p>“Do you remember at the end of 3<sup>rd</sup> year, when I was that inconsolable sobbing mess and I didn’t want to talk about it, and you and everyone just thought it was from overexposure to boggarts?” Ophelia asked. Bill nodded slowly. “It wasn’t the boggarts” Ophelia said, biting the inside of her lip. “I was sad because my prefect Chester was leaving.” This was obviously news to Bill, and his expression changed from apologetic to bewildered. He’d had no idea Ophelia and her prefect had been that close. He had certainly never been that close to his first prefect.</p><p>“He was like a brother to me, or at least what I thought I was missing without a brother,” Ophelia turned away from Bill again, trying to keep her voice steady but not trusting her own eyes to not tear up as she went on. “I would act up, he would tell me off. I would ask for guidance, he would genuinely and eagerly help however he could. I annoyed him just by being a dumb kid, and he put up with me over and over again. He saw potential in me really early on, and he even tutored me so that I would be ready to become a prefect after he left. I never told him that I appreciated it so much. I don’t think I recognized how I felt until after he left.” Ophelia paused for a beat while Bill took all of this in, his eyes still fixed on Ophelia while she stared pointedly towards the horizon. “Really, my brother had disappeared, and then 8 months later I had this authority figure in my life who was about his age and kind of looked like him, and something in me just automatically marked him as a replacement brother. That’s why it hurt so much when he left. I felt like I was being abandoned all over again.” Ophelia let her voice trail off a little. To her credit, her eyes were still dry, and her voice was still steady, but she felt a little raw from admitting all of that out loud to anyone for the first time. It had taken her years to figure out exactly why Chester’s graduation had impacted her so much, and she had never trusted anyone else to understand. Bill was quiet again for a minute, torn between guilt and pity.</p><p>“That’s really rough, Ophelia, I’m so sorry. You felt like you lost your brother all over again, I can’t imagine how much that must have hurt you. And Chester had no idea.” Bill said sympathetically</p><p>“And now you’re leaving too.” Ophelia sighed, drawing her mouth into a thin line as she clenched her jaw. “Jacob left, Chester left, and then I had you, and now you’re also leaving. Who’s to say you won’t just forget about me?”</p><p>Bill let out a short laugh at this, which brought Ophelia’s attention back to his face. “I won’t forget about you for the same reason I won’t forget about Charlie, or Ginny, or any of my family. You’re just as much a sister to me as my actual siblings are, and they’re not hearing the last of me for a long time to come.” Ophelia gave him a weak smile in response. Bill put a reassuring hand on her shoulder, and Ophelia let its weight ground her a little. She knew it was ridiculous to assume that Bill would actually just forget about her entirely, and it had been preposterous to even suggest such a thing out loud. However, Jacob had left a deep emotional wound that Chester’s departure had reopened, and she wasn’t entirely sure that she would make it through Bill’s send-off in one piece.</p><p>An orange head appeared over the top of the nearest hillside, and soon Charlie could be seen making his way towards the two, hands shoved deep into his pockets as he tactfully diverted his eyes from what appeared to be a heartfelt scene. Bill removed his hand from Ophelia’s shoulder, and she immediately felt a little emptier in its absence.</p><p>“Glad you found her,” Charlie called to Bill. “You’ve probably got about 5 minutes before the rest of the family comes out to find you. You’re a commodity today, like it or not.” He stopped in front of the pair, eyes darting between the two, particularly between Bill’s hand on the bench and Ophelia’s shoulder that it had just parted from. “What was so important that the littles and mum and dad couldn’t be privy?”</p><p>“I was talking about Rakepick,” Ophelia said smoothly, surprising herself with how quickly she was able to lie to her friend’s face. Charlie’s eyebrows went up in surprise, as did Bill’s. “I was telling Bill about how I couldn’t believe she would abandon being the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher when the portrait curse is still active. Bill here was just telling me about how Gringotts needed her back in the field-”</p><p>“-Which is true-” Bill interjected indignantly, still a little caught off guard by the sudden change in topic. The emotional vulnerability that had weighed on their conversation a minute ago had evaporated completely.</p><p>“-But that puts us at a disadvantage if we actually find the vault, since we know it’s bound to be more dangerous and difficult than the last. And that’s a huge IF we find it, since Rakepick was supposed to actually help break the vault, and instead spent the year working on her own agenda while she sent me on a goose-chase after Peeves for a portrait of himself that doesn’t actually do anything.” Ophelia paused for breath. She hadn’t really intended to run with this lie, but airing her grievances out loud had really put into perspective how much of a bind Rakepick had left her and the trapped students in. It also felt really good to say it all out loud.  She considered Merula, as an afterthought. Merula had only acted as Rakepick’s apprentice, and Ophelia doubted that she would be willing to cooperate with her without Rakepick being there to tell her to do so.</p><p>“Professor Rakepick was an invaluable teacher for our O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. years,” Bill argued hotly. “She did her best to gather evidence to prepare us to continue her work after the defense against the dark arts teacher jinx inevitably kicked in. We all knew she wasn’t going to stick around for longer than a year in the middle of her busy life.” Bill’s ears were turning a little red, his handsome face twisted into a frown. Ophelia recoiled slightly. She had had no intention of pissing Bill off in their last few hours together. Treading on Bill’s blind reverence of his mentor was probably not the best cover to take just to hide her raw emotions from Charlie.</p><p>“You’re right, Bill, I’m sorry,” Ophelia said, trying to sound genuinely apologetic. “I wouldn’t have stood a chance in my defense O.W.L.s under any of our old teachers. Which begs the question-” she turned her attention to Charlie, who had awkwardly watched the two briefly bicker over Rakepick’s intentions with no comment, “Who’s going to replace her? Next to nobody applies because there’s no job security, and everyone we’ve had up until now has been incompetent, unqualified, uninterested, or some mixture of the three. They’ll have some pretty big shoes to fill.”</p><p>Bill seemed satisfied with Ophelia’s praise of Rakepick, which was admittedly largely rooted in fact. He also turned his attention to Charlie for his opinion. Charlie shrugged and sat down to occupy the gap between Ophelia and Bill, thinking quietly. “Dunno, but since we’re working towards N.E.W.T. level magic it’s got to be someone competent,” Charlie offered. “I hope we get to learn about dragons,” he added, eyes glazed over dreamily at the thought.</p><p>“You wish for that every year” Ophelia said, making a face. “They’re probably going to focus on actual dark creatures this year, since we’ve been working our way up from pesky and mostly harmless to pesky and potentially harmful.”</p><p>“I can confirm that, yeah.” Bill offered from Charlie’s other side. “You’ll learn about dementors and stuff, proper scary creatures. If there’s time in the curriculum, you’ll get to learn the patronus charm.” Ophelia and Charlie both ooh’d softly with excitement.</p><p>“I hope my patronus is a dragon,” Charlie echoed in the same dreamy tone.</p><p>“Charles, if anyone has a dragon patronus, it’ll definitely be you.” Ophelia laughed, as more red-haired children began to appear and approach them from over the hillside.</p>
