    <p>He hadn’t meant to - it was the only logical thought Harry could hold on to as he stared at the blood pooling out upon the floor, the gouges in Malfoy’s face staring up at him accusingly as Snape knelt, his voice like a song as he spoke the counter curse. He couldn’t think beyond the color blooming out before him, beyond the horrified screams and sobs of Moaning Myrtle above it all - his heart was pounding, but he felt cold, as if he had been flying too long in the rain, each breath seemed to freeze in his chest as his lungs clawed at him, burning against every intake.</p><p>The skin on Malfoy’s face began knitting together, and Snape drew the pale blonde up to his feet, mentioning something about <em>scarring</em>, talking about the Hospital Wing - Harry wasn’t catching everything, he was still too stunned. As Snape drew past him, he demanded that Harry wait there in the battered bathroom, in a backdrop of flowing water and the blood he’d spilled - and it didn’t occur to Harry to leave. He nodded on automatic, Moaning Myrtle’s sobs taking a new tone now that it seemed that Malfoy was going to live - murder. Murder in the bathroom, that was what she had called it, and if Snape hadn’t shown up when he did -</p><p>The shudder had barely finished wracking through his form when a hand grasped his upper arm, and Harry turned to find himself staring into the impenetrable gaze of Blaise Zabini. For the first time, Harry could see how the tall Slytherin commanded so much respect from the others without seeming to really work at it - just looking at the furious set of those aristocratic features was enough to make him feel very small and insignificant. He opened his mouth to say something - what, he didn’t even know - but Zabini shook his head and <em>yanked</em> - physically hauling Harry around and turning him toward the door where Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott stood with thunderous expressions.</p><p>Had it not been for the hard shove at his shoulder, Harry might have had the wits about him to argue Snape had told him to stay put, but as soon as his feet stumbled forward, he found himself carried on by his own momentum and directly into the joint grip of the other two Slytherins, who each clamped on to him from either side and lead him away from the bathroom. There were looks from others as they went - and Harry wondered, briefly, why no one interfered. Glancing down at himself, he cringed internally as the answer was made clear - the way Parkinson and Nott had him, it looked like they were supporting a bloody Gryffindor to the Hospital Wing - and they were going the right way for it, at least at first.</p><p>Parkinson snapped something - it sounded like a spell, but Harry didn’t catch it before a portrait slid to the side and he was dragged down a hidden hallway he certainly had not seen on the Marauder’s Map before. Alarm started to settle in, enough so that he finally got the wits to stop and drag his arm away from Parkinson, whose grip wasn’t as fierce as Nott’s - but the firm press of a wand just behind his ear, pressing against his pulse, stilled any further attempts to get away.</p><p>“Relax, Potter,” Zabini’s tone was hard to read, but there was something in how calm he was that made Harry even more nervous, considering how firmly the taller boy had his wand settled against his neck, “If we wanted to kill you, why would we bother moving you from the scene of your own crime?”</p><p>Hearing it worded that way - Harry swallowed thickly. “I didn’t mean - “</p><p>“Shut up,” Parkinson cut across him, high and sharp, “You nearly murdered someone, you think<em> I didn’t mean to</em> excuses that?”</p><p><em>No,</em> Harry realized grimly, something heavy settling in his stomach as he thought about it. He shook his head mutely, noting mildly that his other arm was starting to go a little numb in Nott’s grip. He hadn’t known what that spell even did - yet thinking about it, he could just hear Hermione’s horror at using a spell without knowing what it could do. Even Mr. Weasley had been clear on the fact that when it came to magic, one should never trust something unless you knew its origins.</p><p>“What are you going to do then?”</p><p>“We’re going to have a discussion, like civilized people,” Zabini assured softly, and Harry didn’t argue, because he understood enough about what wasn’t being said. He’d committed an adult crime today - being a kid didn’t excuse murder, and while sectumsempra might not be an Unforgivable, what it did certainly was. A court of his peers playing at being civilized was the least of his worries if this left the school - and there was no way Malfoy wasn’t going to talk. His family might have been in disgrace, but he probably had lawyers -</p><p>Harry was drawn out of his mental spiral when Nott dragged on his arm and he winced. Curiously, Nott frowned and eased his hold, though he and the other two were no less intent as they lead him on through the mysterious hallway until they reached another portrait and Parkinson spoke again. This time Harry paid attention enough to catch the password - only what she said sounded so strange it took Harry a long minute to realize she hadn’t said something in Latin but rather in <em>Welsh</em> - but before he could consider the wisdom of questioning that, he was being drawn through into what looked like a classroom.</p><p>The walls were lined with books, and there were several desks as well as a standing podium and a blackboard. Once in the room, the Slytherins moved away from him, each making their way to a desk and leaning against it. Faced with their stares, Harry shifted uncomfortably and looked around, trying to figure out where they were - and if there were any other exits. “So - uhm - Snape told me to stay where I was - “</p><p>“Oh too bad - so you’ll have to do whatever you usually do when you ignore him!” Parkinson had a way of speaking that was utterly obnoxious, and as Harry narrowed his eyes at her, Zabini laid a hand on her shoulder and she crossed her arms, looking away with an expression like she’d just popped a lemon wedge in her mouth.</p><p>“You won’t be punished - you know that, don’t you?”</p><p>Zabini’s question was so unexpected that Harry stared at him as if he might be a bit mad. Perhaps it showed, because the dark boy’s lips curved into a patient smile that somehow made Harry feel even worse. “Oh, Professor Snape will lay into you as much as he can get away with, that much is for certain. You’ll have detention for sure - but nobody will report you, or expect there to be any legal repercussions. You know why?”</p><p>“Because Mr. Malfoy’s in prison?” Harry hazarded, despite an inner voice that sounded suspiciously like Ron warning him to pick his battles more carefully when locked away who-knows-where in the castle with three understandably pissed off Slytherins.</p><p>“Merlin’s teeth, Potter - “ Whatever Parkinson had been about to follow that with was cut off by Nott, who startled Harry by laughing. The other two stared at him, and Nott shook his head helplessly for a moment before managing to croak out, “He has a point - old Lucius would never take this one lying down.”</p><p>Harry edged himself closer to the exit as the other two gave Nott displeased looks, but this appeared to be the wrong move as the next thing he heard was a quiet <em>expelliarmus</em> - his wand flew over to Zabini, who caught it with a lazy sort of grace that Harry couldn’t help but envy - he was <em>quick,</em> but he could never make things look that effortless. Frustration was clouding his judgment at this point however, and he’d about had it.</p><p>“Look, whatever it is you want, just get on with it - I’m really not in the mood for this right now - “</p><p>“You owe Malfoy a life debt, and you just about murdered him today. Had it not been for Professor Snape sparing him, you’d currently be bleeding out on the bathroom floor as your own curse shredded you until there was nothing left - and it would have served you right!” Parkinson again, though this time Harry didn’t concentrate on how shrill her voice was so much as the content of what she had to say. Something ugly shifted in him, and he stepped back - not out of any conscious need to escape, so much as reflex in the face of something deeply unpleasant.</p><p>“What the hell are you on about - “</p><p>“I know you make an annual effort to perish and all, Potter, but surely you remember your spectacular adventure in Myrtle’s bathroom last year?” Nott this time, his voice droll enough that Harry found he wasn’t particularly offended by the remark - it didn’t sound like an attack so much as a bored observation, and that was - close enough to the truth it would be pointless to be annoyed by it.</p><p>“You’re saying <em>Malfoy</em> was the one who - “</p><p>“Pried the venom from behind your teeth and saved you from drowning in your own blood?” The wicked question made Harry wince. “Honestly, could you be any more dramatic? Why not just throw yourself off the Astronomy tower if it was a scene you wanted - “</p><p>“I wasn’t trying to off myself!” Harry yelled, sick to his stomach at the insinuation he’d wanted his death to be a spectacle. “The hell is wrong with you Parkinson - why would I - “</p><p>“How should I know what goes on in that head of yours? You just <em>gutted</em> my best friend, Golden Boy!”</p><p>“Don’t call me that!” It was so irrelevant, but the way she said it made his teeth grind, “What happened last year was an accident - “</p><p>“Harry.”</p><p>The sudden use of his given name quieted him instantly, and it seemed to silence Parkinson as well. All eyes were on Zabini as he stepped forward, offering Harry his wand back. Frowning, Harry hesitantly reached out - but there was no trick, and his hand closed around the handle. He looked up at the other boy for just a moment, and caught the trap just as it slammed shut on him.</p><p>
  <em>“Can’t sleep, Harry?” Nearly Headless Nick sounded so painfully understanding, and Harry hated him for it. He hated everyone for their patience and their pitying looks - he didn’t want their kindness, he wanted someone to scream at. Someone who would fight back, and give him a reason to feel something other than this impotent, horrible rage that seemed to be eating away at everything good inside of him. “You know, when I was alive, I often had a difficult time sleeping,” The ghost carried on, oblivious to Harry’s frustration as he strode on faster, as if he could escape the prattle if he just moved quicker. “There was a plant that would make it all go away,” That slowed his steps, “The frustrations, my boy, they can be the death of a man,” The irony in that wasn’t lost on Harry, “They still grow it - greenhouse seven, I believe. It’s the one with the purple stem. One or two of the blue leaves ought to do it - you’ll want to take them in the bathroom of course, they make a man mighty sick, but after, oh. You sleep like a dream.”</em>
</p><p>A resistance started, but it was futile, as surely as it had been last year when Professor Snape had been the one traversing his thoughts as if they were nothing more than reading material - as accessible and vulnerable now as they had been during the lessons, though strangely lacking the fear. Perhaps it was because he knew what Zabini was looking for - and the moment he thought that, he surrendered the second part of the memory if only to get the other out of his mind faster.</p><p>
  <em>It was the last day - everyone was already packed and ready to board the Hogwarts Express tomorrow morning, and all Harry could think of was how desperately he wanted to go anywhere other than the Dursleys. He had avoided Nearly Headless Nick’s advice, but now the thought of a proper night of sleep before going to face that lot sounded like the exact medicine he needed. He had collected a lot more than two leaves - his hope was to sleep through as much of the summer as possible, frankly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Setting one of the blue leaves on his tongue, his first thought was surprise at how sweet it was. Like candy floss melting in his mouth, it even left that grainy texture like sugar sticking to one’s teeth. He had enough time to wonder if that was what the ghost had meant about it causing sickness first as he set the second one in his mouth. The pain struck him so hard he couldn’t breathe - he tasted rather than felt the blood that pooled in his mouth as lacerations opened up along his cheeks, he could hear the horrid, strangled gurgle of his own breath as he collapsed on the tiles, black shoes rushing toward him, green trim catching color as the stranger knelt nearby, hands maneuvering him, someone telling him to spit —</em>
</p><p>The recollection ended abruptly, and Harry swayed. A steady hand guided him toward a seat, and Harry collapsed into it wordlessly. He didn’t know what to say - he hadn’t told anyone how he had found out about the plant, not even when they’d all assumed he knew what it would do. Hermione had sent him books on grief and wellness, and Ron had sent him a letter every day that summer, demanding he write back - it didn’t matter about what, and eventually they had settled on exchanging quidditch strategy as if they both didn’t know the real reason behind it was to make sure Harry hadn’t done something to himself without his friends watching. He’d convinced himself it was an accident - that maybe Nick had gotten the details wrong - but going over it like he’d just been forced to - he shuddered and placed his head in his hands.</p><p>“That was no accident,” Zabini mused, and when Harry didn’t answer he asked just as calmly, “But what happened with Draco - that was an accident, was it not?”</p><p>“Like I’d do something like that on purpose!” Harry managed, lowering his hands to glare at the other boy, though it didn’t have as much heat as it might have a moment ago.</p><p>“Where did you learn that curse?”</p><p>“It was in my potions book,” Harry confessed, though immediately wondered why.</p><p>“I see.” There was a sound of a chair moving, and Harry watched dispassionately as Zabini sat across from him. “That curse - it’s from the first war. My mother saw fit to ensure I knew all the spells that were commonly practiced then, in case I found myself in danger. She believed if I recognized the work, I’d be able to identify my enemy,” The explanation startled Harry, but he supposed it made sense in a frightening kind of way. “We brought you here because we wanted to see if you had done it on purpose or been directed to do it, because nobody would punish you - you make a perfect candidate for unwitting assassin.”</p><p>“That’s insane - “</p><p>“Is it?” The calm question was unnerving. “Think about it - if any of us had done that to you - do you think a professor would have us wait, or do you think we’d have been hauled directly for expulsion?”</p><p>Harry shifted uncomfortably. He knew the answer to that and he didn’t like what it said.</p><p>“Did anyone put you up to it?”</p><p>“No!” Harry was glad, at least, to have something he could fight, “We were just dueling, alright? I saw that spell in the book - it said it was for enemies - I didn’t know what it would do! Nobody told me to use it, and I didn’t - I didn’t mean to hurt him like that!”</p><p>“I believe you.”</p><p>That took the wind out of Harry’s sails, and Parkinson picked up the silence.</p><p>“You didn’t know it was Draco who rescued you, either?”</p><p>“No - and about that,” Harry frowned, now giving Zabini an unhappy look, “I don’t appreciate having my brain picked - “</p><p>“Then shield it.”</p><p>Harry’s jaw snapped shut a moment, then, “That’s not the point - “</p><p>“The point is, you were nearly murdered too.”</p><p>“No - “</p><p>“Wait what? Draco found him with the galius leaves in his hand, Blaise - “</p><p>“Someone he trusted told him they would help him sleep.”</p><p>Harry’s protests were swallowed down with the bile those words rose up, and it was Nott’s sarcastic, “Permanently, sure,” that forced Harry to his feet, pacing away from the three Slytherins and desperately needing air. In lieu of knowing how the hell to get out of here ( had the bookshelves changed? Why was this room so disorienting - and where did the hidden entrance go? Where the hell was the <em>door</em> - )</p><p>“Why’d he do it?”</p><p>“Not sure,” Zabini began, but Harry cut him off before he could say anything damning. “Malfoy, I mean. Why’d he save me?”</p><p>The three pairs of eyes on him were disconcerting, but he refused to budge. “Well? You’ve all been so talkative about what I owe him and what I’m apparently willing to do to him - so speak up! Why would <em>Malfoy</em> save me? His father’s in prison and I’ll bet Voldemort’s not happy with him in the slightest! Surely he wants me dead? He could have even taken the credit - “</p><p>“You are such an idiot! Draco may not like you but he isn’t a killer, Potter! And what did his dad<em> really</em> do to you? Think about it!”</p><p>“What the hell do you mean what did he really do?” Harry demanded, frowning at Parkinson, “He attacked me and my friends at the Ministry!”</p><p>“Did he?” Zabini sounded so genuinely curious that Harry shook his head. What kind of trick was this? “Did he curse you or your friends?”</p><p>Harry found himself thinking through the battle. Malfoy had tried to get him to hand over the prophesy - then he’d told the others to smash the shelves. When they bolted he remembered Malfoy ordering the Death Eaters around, trying to organize them - but there hadn’t been much organization to the fight, especially not with broken time turners and Death Eaters turning into babies, brains flying around - but Harry did remember the voices - he could pinpoint several Death Eaters by their voices now, and he didn’t recall Malfoy crying any curses. He had shown up when the others were already captured, had faced Harry again and asked for the prophesy -</p><p>“What’s your point?” Realizing he had been quiet for too long, Harry shook himself and frowned at the others. “So he appeared when the fighting was over and didn’t cast any curses - he was still leading those who were willing to kill us. Dolohov broke Neville’s nose - I still don’t know what he did to Hermione - “</p><p>“You’re right - he was trying to lead them, but you’ve already acknowledged the important part - he never tried to kill you himself, or harm your friends - “</p><p>“And that makes him innocent, does it, Nott? Your dad was more than happy to - “</p><p>“My dad’s a piece of shit,” The calm acknowledgment, the easy roll of Nott’s shoulders, startled Harry. “I’m not arguing his role here, only Malfoy’s. He follows the old ways and he taught Draco to do the same - what would you have him do in that situation? Take on nine Death Eaters and hope his betrayal won’t get his family killed after him? Of course he didn’t do anything - but he’s not stupid, and neither is Draco. You dying on a bathroom floor won’t help anyone.”</p><p>Harry had a lot of things he wanted to say to that, but in the end he settled for a bland, “Right, so you expect me to believe Malfoy saved me because I’m the chosen one.”</p><p>“No, you absolute broom rag, I mean he saved you because he was brought up on the old ways! One of the primary laws dictates that no harm be permitted to come to children should one be present to prevent it,” Nott snapped, seemingly out of good natured amusement now. “You said yourself that Lucius Malfoy just appeared after the fighting was over - he couldn’t prevent anything, but he didn’t add to it either. Draco was raised by his father’s ideals - he was present at the harming of a child, so he followed what the law dictated and protected you, because as mad at you as he might be, he knows his father would never forgive him had he ignored your plight!”</p><p>Harry’s mind reeled with this information, but before he could say anything a blue light flooded the room. He heard one of the Slytherins mutter an oath moments before a door appeared in the middle of a bookshelf and burst open, revealing Professors Snape, McGonagall and Dumbledore.</p><p>“There you are, Potter!” Professor Snape sounded furious, but what caught Harry’s attention were the looks on Dumbledore and McGonagall’s faces - and the fact that they were blocked out by Zabini and Nott as the two boys moved in front of him in an eerily familiar fashion. Before Harry could quite place it, he felt a hand grip his wrist and looked to see Parkinson glaring at the three adults. She barely moved her lips, but in the quiet he was able to catch her whisper to him not to move.</p><p>“What is the meaning of this?” Snape’s anger seemed to be distracted by the sight of the two Slytherins - and for once, Harry felt himself in complete agreement with the man’s mood, because he didn’t understand the shift either.</p><p>“We have reason to believe that Harry has been framed,” Zabini remarked, causing Harry to stare perplexedly at the back of his head. “We brought him here in order to ensure his safety.”</p><p>There was a scoff from McGonagall, and Dumbledore peered over his half-moon glasses in a way that made Harry wonder if Zabini could block mental intrusion as well as he could attack. “Is this true, Harry?”</p><p>“Er - “</p><p>“It’s okay Harry,” Zabini’s soft voice was strangely hypnotic, “You can tell them about the galius.”</p><p>Even Harry saw the way the teachers all stiffened, and he realized something sneaky was going on - though why he played along with Zabini he couldn’t rightly say. “It was Nearly Headless Nick - he said the leaves would help me sleep, when I was - struggling, cause of -Padfoot.”</p><p>Interestingly, Snape went a strange shade of white while McGonagall took on a reddish hue to put the house banners to shame as she whispered, “You cannot be serious Mister Potter - “</p><p>That - for some reason - pissed him off.</p><p>“Why? Why would I lie about that Professor? Do you really think I wanted to die like that?”</p><p>Whatever she had anticipated from him, that was clearly not it, and Harry felt rather guilty for how hard she blanched even as he felt Parkinson’s hand shift and move from his wrist to hold his own. It was - surprisingly supportive, and he shot her a confused, if mildly grateful look. She didn’t appear to notice though.</p><p>“Minerva, I believe we will need to have a word with your house mascot,” Dumbledore mused, to which she nodded mutely. “I thank you all for looking out for Harry - would you like to accompany him to my office?”</p><p>The question confused the hell out of Harry, and Zabini must have understood that considering his response clarified why it had been asked in the first place, “Seeing as his own house is out to kill him, I think it would be best if he was surrounded by those who are less blindly faithful.”</p><p>The headmaster smiled, and patted Snape on the shoulder. “Come, Severus - it seems your students have this well in hand.”</p><p>Mystified, Harry found himself lead out of the disorienting room into a familiar dungeon corridor, following the Headmaster, his head of house and Professor Snape toward Dumbledore’s office, flanked by three Slytherins who seemed intent on guarding him. Still soaked from his ordeal in the bathroom, Harry was once again confronted by the bloody sight he made as they entered the brightly lit halls of the greater school area, and he found himself dazed by the amount of questions he had - not the least of which being how he was going to explain to Ron why there were people whispering about him holding hands with Pansy Parkinson like he was the new Draco Malfoy…..</p>
