    <p>“Ow.” I protested under my breath, flinching as I was pricked once again with a small dressmaking needle that seemed to be unnecessarily sharp. The witch who haphazardly flourished her wand above my head and down around my shoulders was old, very old. Thin strands of ashen hair were twisted into a low bun at the base of her head and her hands possessed a tremor so pronounced, I suspected it had been there her whole life. She frowned with concentration as she worked, the expression only emphasising the lines already present on her aged skin. </p><p>“We should be done after this, darling.” My Mother remarked from where she was delicately perched on a dusty mauve pouf. She had kept her list close at hand all day, not letting us veer from its contents in the slightest. Even as I stood on the elevated platform in front of three long mirrors, she was still ticking items off and scribbling notes down with her delicate white travel quill.<br/>
“But couldn’t we just…?” She looked up from the parchment in her hand and my question was curtailed, without the need for an answer to be voiced. </p><p>“First years are not allowed their own brooms, Nina.” She repeated and I fought the urge to cross my arms and pout. It was the same answer I’d received all day. But I’d already seen the Nimbus 2000 in the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies. Other wizards and witches of my own age and older with their noses pressed against the glass. </p><p>“I just want to look.” </p><p>“No, Nina. Because if you look you will beg your father until he buys it for you. The answer is no. I’m not going to repeat myself again, young lady” I sighed in defeat as my reverie of rule breaking at Hogwarts before I’d even arrived were whisked away. </p><p>My attention was suddenly diverted from my own appearance in the aged mirrors, to the pedestal next to me as the bell on the front door jingled – announcing the arrival of another customer to Madam Malkin’s Robes for all Occasions. A boy stepped up next to me, white-blond hair slicked back, drawing emphasis to his sharp and pronounced features. He briefly examined his own reflection in the mirror before turning to me, I offered a small smile – his eyes flickering down to my mouth before his eyebrows furrowed and he turned away, his chin jutting into the air as a woman joined his side. Her hair was almost an identical shade of blonde. </p><p>“That’s you done then, dear.” The old witch sighed before charming the pins out of my arsenic robes and returning me back to the tartan skirt and black t-shirt I’d been wearing. I shrugged my denim jacket over my shoulders and winced as my mother pulled my hair from underneath the collar. The blonde woman offered a small smile in my mother’s direction and a curt nod was returned but I paid little attention to either of them as I watched the old witch fold my robes and place them in a paper bag before tying it with string. Plain from head to foot, they were yet to be adorned with the house I would find myself in once I arrived at Hogwarts. My mother folded her list back into her purse, paid the witch for her services and ushered me from the shop and out into the heaving streets of Diagon Alley.</p><p>“Now we just need to find your brother and father,” she commented as we gingerly stepped among the excited crowds. There was never a dull atmosphere in Diagon Alley, it was always a happy and high-spirited place to be and that feeling was often contagious. I’d wished that we’d been able to go into every single shop and just wander round as if we had all the time in the world but of course, with my mother attending, we had been put on a very strict time schedule. I hadn’t been able to go into Madam Augusta’s Astronomy Supplies even though I had practically begged to. It was a deep navy shop, decorated with silver stars that moved across the walls and sometimes there were even meteor showers. I had pressed my nose against the glass to look inside and at the top of the building there was a huge telescope that people were using to see the planets, most presumably in preparation for our astronomy lessons at school. Lessons I was particularly looking forward to. </p><p>Eventually, we found my Father stationed outside the Apothecary. He was piling small jars and phials into the arms of my brother who rolled his eyes at me through the new glasses he’d had to start wearing over the summer and I stifled a giggle. Alec and I were close as siblings. We fought enough and often times our parents had to act as mediators to our conflicts, but we shared a passion for much of the same subjects, meaning we always found a way to reconcile with one another. I did miss him terribly when he went away to school but this year, I would be going with him. </p><p>“Did you get everything?” My mother questioned instantly upon seeing them. My father nodded in response, but it was clear she didn’t believe him. To say my mother was a bit uptight when it came to shopping would be a mild understatement. </p><p>“Are you sure? The books?” He nodded and sighed with a small smile on his face. He often said that our mother’s meticulousness was something that he loved about her. </p><p>“Alec picked them up whilst I got her cauldron.” My mother retrieved the list once again from her purse and ran a manicured nail down the parchment for what must have been the hundredth time that day. </p><p>“Ok, I got her gloves, hat, cloak and robes.” She nodded lightly as she listed off each item, double checking that we still had each item in our possession. As she listed them off, my father was placing each of the items into her handbag with its extendable charm that concealed the true size of it. Despite being surrounded by magic my whole life, I loved watching the items drop into her bag and vanish into unknown depths. Once Alec’s arms were clear he pulled a paper bag of sweets from his pocket, tossing me a stick of Droobles Best Blowing Gum which I happily popped in my mouth before attempting to blow the biggest bubble I could muster. </p><p>“…I also got her telescope, crystal phials, and the scales.” I heard my parents mutter between themselves. “Is that everything?” </p><p>“No! My wand!” I cried as the bubblegum popped and I picked it from my cheeks as my parents watched me disapprovingly but it didn’t matter, I was suddenly brimming with excitement as I spotted the concave windows of Ollivander’s shop front. I had taken off and entered the shop before my parents had the chance to catch up. </p><p>Ollivander’s was dusty inside, the smell of old wooden boxes and forgotten books got right into my nose and forced three sneezes out as my parents and brother followed inside. There were wand boxes piled floor to ceiling, varying in colours but every single one was the same size. Dust clung to some of them and cobwebs to others. The old man at the counter had looked up the moment I’d stepped in and waited patiently for my eyes to locate him amongst the wands. </p><p>“Ah, Miss Rosier? Is it that time already?” He smiled softly, placing his quill in its stand before he folded his hands together. I nodded as he looked to my parents, “Finally off to Hogwarts alongside your brother.” I smiled in excitement as he reminded me of the exciting news. </p><p>“Remind me, Mrs Rosier. Which wand chose you?” My mother pulled her wand from her purse, smiling proudly as its delicate features and white colour. She handed it to Mr Ollivander, and he turned it over in his grasp. </p><p>“Ah yes, Aspen wood. Phoenix feather if I remember correctly?” My mother nodded, accepting it back into her own delicate grip. </p><p>“It has served me well.” She remarked as Ollivander repeated the action with my father. </p><p>“Beech.” Ollivander smiled as he ran his old fingers along the groves of my father’s wand. “For those wise beyond their years and full of understanding.” My father cleared his throat and I couldn’t help but notice him tilt his chin upward slightly, earning a subtle snigger from Alec and an admiring smile from my mother. Ollivander handed the wand back and leant over his desk to me, a fabric tape measure came sliding over the counter top and began to measure my arm, wrist, each of my fingers and even around my head. I kept my eyes trained on Ollivander however as he examined my face closely before retreating to the back of his shop, returning moments later with a purple box in hand. He removed a wand of English Oak and my hand clasped around it. It felt cold to the touch, but I waved it nonetheless, the magic felt staggered as it moved down my arm and into the wand and I wasn’t sure what I had wanted it to do but I was sure that it hadn’t happened. The actions that the wand had performed were quickly confirmed however as we heard a scream from down the street outside. Alec poked his head out the door and then quickly closed it, his face red with silent laughter. My mother swatted him with her list but he couldn’t stop himself. I quickly placed the wand back on the desk with a shaking hand and apologetic expression. Ollivander sighed with a smile, muttered that it happened all the time and returned to the back of the shop, returning the second time with two boxes, one grey and one green. He opened the grey one first and handed it down to me.</p><p> “Yew.” He said simply and I waved it again. My mother practically jumped into my father’s arms as two floorboards ripped themselves up from under her feet and combusted into thousands of tiny splinters. </p><p>“No, I didn’t think so, but I like to be sure.” He waved his hand and I watched with amazement as the floorboards put themselves back together and fitted themselves back amongst the others on the floor. My mother did not step back onto them, instead staying close to my father’s side. </p><p>“Here, try this one.” Ollivander took the wand away and handed me the third one. As soon as I touched it, warmth spread throughout my hand and arm and I felt instantly attached to the intricately carved wand in my hand. I waved it slightly and several silver wisps emerged from the end and floated around the air, dancing to their own silent song. I watched in awe as they rose to the ceiling and disappeared. </p><p>“Yes. Yes, I think that is the one for you, young Miss.” I reluctantly handed the wand back as he wrapped it in its green box and tied it shut with black ribbon. “A questing wand, it is always seeking out the next great adventure. It will become dangerous if left to the mundane activities that occupy so many of our lives.” </p><p>“Sounds like you’re destined for Gryffindor in that case, panda.” Alec smirked. I grimaced and looked up at my Farther in silent protest as the box was handed back to me and I clutched it to my chest. As close as our family was, my Dad and I were partners in crime. He was my best friend. </p><p>“Leave your sister alone. If I remember correctly, weren’t you almost a hat stall? Didn’t it almost put you in Hufflepuff? We all know how much yellow doesn’t suit you.” A rose tint appeared on my brother’s cheeks as my mother hushed them both, paid Mr Ollivander and we left the shop. The streets had begun to empty slightly but they were still busy. </p><p>“Come on. Everyone will start leaving soon and the Floo Network will soon be backed up.” My Father said. “I want to go home and have some well-deserved dinner.” He then turned to me;<br/>
“You also need to start packing. In six days, you are off to Hogwarts.”</p>
