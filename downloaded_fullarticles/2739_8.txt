          <div class="userstuff"><p>I wake up and he’s still here.</p><p>Sitting on the bed, looking down at me.</p><p>I turn on my back and rub my eyes.</p><p>‘What time is it?’ I ask.</p><p>‘Just after eight.’</p><p>I groan.</p><p>It’s way too early.</p><p>‘Here,’ he levitates a tray into my lap.</p><p>A tray with food.</p><p>I look at it, puzzled. ‘What is it?’</p><p>‘Wow,’ he deadpans. When I don’t eat, he says: ‘It is <em>not</em> poisoned.’</p><p>‘I didn’t think it was.’</p><p>I drink the coffee.</p><p>I eat, way too quickly.</p><p>My stomach not rumbling anymore.</p><p>We don’t speak, he watches me and it’s a bit weird.</p><p>‘Thanks. It was good,’ I speak when I’m finished. ‘Did you eat? Should I’ve left you some?’</p><p>‘Yes, I ate,’ he turns his head away, looking through the window.</p><p>I don’t know what else to say so I stand up.</p><p>And <em>oh my god</em>, my whole body hurts. The ache is deep and dull.</p><p>‘Are you all right?’ he frowns at me, standing up.</p><p>‘Yeah, it just still aches a bit.’</p><p>I stretch some more. I want to lie in bed and sleep. <em>Again</em>.</p><p>All these potions make me feel off.</p><p>‘Rest then. I’ll go,’ he says and vanishes the tray.</p><p>He only takes two steps when I blurt out: ‘Don’t. Stay.’</p><p>Because… whatever.</p><p>There’s no hesitation in his movements.</p><p>He walks towards me until he’s right in front of me.</p><p>He raises his hand to my shoulder.</p><p>He kisses the skin where the scars slash my neck, cheeks, head.</p><p>His breath is hot in my ear as he speaks.</p><p>‘You almost died.’</p><p>I shiver. ‘But I didn’t.’</p><p>‘No,’ he inhales.</p><p>I lean into him and bury my fingers in his hair.</p><p>I breathe in his scent.</p><p>I kiss there and then I kiss his temple and cheek and jaw.</p><p>His lips.</p><p>My head is spinning.</p><p>I want to keep kissing him because I missed him.</p><p>I miss him all the damn time nowadays.</p><p>But he stops and pulls away.</p><p>His eyes flit about my face.</p><p>I don’t even try to hide anything anymore.</p><p>I don’t care he didn’t visit.</p><p>I don’t care he infuriates me.</p><p>I don’t care.</p><p>And in that wild moment, when I look into his darting eyes, I think it’s more for him.</p><p>More than desire.</p><p>More than hatred.</p><p>In that moment, I let myself think he loves me too.</p><p>I grip at his shoulders and I almost say it.</p><p>But he surges forward and kisses me again.</p><p>I pull him on the bed, on top of me.</p><p>And I yawn in the middle of the kiss. Right into his mouth.</p><p>He is startled for a moment, eyes wide but then laughs and rolls us over.</p><p>‘I’m sorry, I don’t even know why I’m still so tired,’ I yawn again.</p><p>I rest my head under his chin.</p><p>‘It’s fine,’ he murmurs and pulls me closer.</p><p>He breathes in and then out.</p><p>In and out.</p><p>In...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>
