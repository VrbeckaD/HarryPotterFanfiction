  <u> <strong>Harry Potter - To Wish Upon A Star</strong> </u>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> Chapter 1 </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Sometimes only breathing isn’t enough. You try to suck air into your lungs, they inflate but you still feel like you are suffocating. It doesn’t matter how much you breathe in; the feeling is always there. When you try to exhale, you can’t. You only get to squeeze out a small amount before you try again to take in as much air as possible. And then you think about what little sense is makes. You feel guilty, ashamed, angry with yourself.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sometimes you hurt even though physically you are fine. There is no scratch on you but there is this hole burning in your chest. It pushes tears into your eyes and you try to swallow the sobs. You hug yourself to keep yourself together, to not fall into parts. You feel guilty, ashamed, angry with yourself.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sometimes you smile, you laugh, sometimes you even mean it. Then, suddenly you think what little sense it makes. You are reminded by the burning hole in your chest, you are reminded that you are slowly suffocating and falling part. The smile lessens, the laughter grows quiet and you are alone with yourself again. Silence consumes you. It is a blessing, swallowing you whole. You feel guilty, ashamed, angry with yourself.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sometimes you wish you had a reason to feel like this. Sometimes you wished something had happened to cause all this because then there is a reason. A cause, a problem, something to be solved. But in reality, it is just you, you alone with yourself. When you want to curl up under your bed, hide and be never seen again, when you cry for no apparent reason, when you feel numb and just don’t care anymore, when you clench your fist and want to beat into something, maybe yourself, you feel guilty, ashamed, angry with yourself.</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The day had started like every other day. He had gotten up, made breakfast and hoped that Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were in a good mood. Dudley had eaten his breakfast like a pig, spilling food and crumbs everywhere for him to clean up. Vernon had gone to work after finishing reading the news paper and telling him to behave or else. Aunt Petunia had given him a list of chores to complete. Gardening even though the sun was burning high on the sky. Swiping the floors, dusting the whole house, cleaning the bathrooms and bringing Dudley’s room into order. For lunch he had eaten a sandwich and an apple, his first meal of the day. In the evening he had made dinner. He had made steak and some vegetables. All had gone well. Aunt Petunia had told him that he was worthless and a freak which was technically true, Uncle Vernon had told him that he was a waste of air which was also technically true. The steak was too dry. Harry had been sure that he had left it in the pan not too long. Dudley had said is was like eating the sole of a shoe. He had gotten a slap left and right for it from Vernon. No supper for him. He went to bed hungry, feeling angry and empty. It had been a relatively normal day. A day like everyone else.</p><p>Harry stayed awake till midnight. He did always on the night before his birthdays. It gave him much time to think. To think about the past year and what he wished for, for the coming one.</p><p>Sirius alive, a family, not feeling empty, not feeling like a failure, Sirius alive, someone who cared for him, not suffocating, Sirius alive, someone to look out for him, not always feeling guilty, Sirius alive, someone he could truly trust, not drowning, Sirius alive, someone who saw him like he was, not being numb, Sirius alive, someone who could help him, feeling alive.</p><p>It wasn’t always easy to pretend. Hermione and Ron believed him; last time he saw Dumbledore he trashed his office. He felt guilty for it, embarrassed. Rage has washed over him and he just gave in. He destroyed everything in his surroundings, relieving himself of the anger which had been there for a long long time.</p><p>Sometimes Harry believed himself. He believed himself to be this brave boy who had faced off against Voldemort many times. He believed himself to be this curious boy who went into the chamber of secrets and faced off against a century old Basilisk. He believed himself to be the Quidditch loving boy who caught the snitch almost every time. He believed it. When he laid in bed late at night, when the darkness tripped away all the lies, he holds back the tears. He was a lair, a good one. He was an intruder. He was a pretender. He was alone with himself. His friends were friends with a puppet whose strings he pulled. They painted the mask he created.</p><p>Don’t get this wrong, Harry didn’t always feel like this. In moments, he forgets his emptiness and laughs with his friends. He forgets that he is just pretending and the master becomes the puppet itself and feels happy. He likes Hermione and Ron, they have their flaws but everybody had them, right? He was their friend, sometimes he doesn’t even have to pretend. Sometimes he did only worry about the next homework due. But- when he thought about it too long, when there was no distraction, when he is left alone with his thoughts, the numbness returns. The doubts, the guilt, the embarrassment, the anger.</p><p>Now, living at the Dursleys it was easier and harder at the same time. It was easier because there were no expectations. He didn’t have to pretend; he just needed to follow their rules and do his chores. Mostly he was left alone, true when he made a mistake, he was slapped here and there but he deserved it. He made a mistake that had to be punished. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon told him who he really was. They saw the real him, they saw who he was. He was a freak, a waste of air, a no-good, a plague. It was in their right to tell him. Aunt Petunia took care of him, she gave him food, he ate once, when he was lucky, twice a day.</p><p>It was harder because he didn’t have to make up this tale about himself, pretending to be brave, happy. He was constantly alone with his thoughts, the only distraction was doing chores and maybe run away from Dudley. That was not much.</p><p>The nights in Surry seemed to be darker than they were in Hogwarts. The shadows were deeper, the stars dimmer. It was around midnight when the pain started. First Harry didn’t notice it, it started with an arch in his back. The arch spread and developed into something more. It got stronger and stronger until it was like somebody was pouring hot oil over his body and then tried to prevent it from catching fire by throwing water into the mix. Which lead to the fire lighting up. Harry laid on his bed. He clenches his teeth together but moans of pain left his lips. He wanted to curl into himself but he hurt so much. He clenched his hand into the bed sheet. His back arched up just to fall down onto the bed again. He trashed around, throwing his head from one side to another. It felt as if his bones were pulverized, as if his organs were ripped out and then stuffed in again, as if someone was trying to crush his scull, make it pop like a ripe grape, as if someone was pulling on his shoulders, ripping them out of him. He couldn’t take it anymore, he just couldn’t. He wanted to faint, to lose consciousness but it seemed that blessing would not be given to him. He wanted to scream his throat raw but when he opened his mouth no sound came out of it. He let go of the bed sheet and dig his nails into the palms of his hands until he could feel a hot liquid coming out if them. That didn’t stop him.</p><p>When he thought it couldn’t get any worse, when he thought he would die, he was proven wrong.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Somehow, somewhen he must have finally lost consciousness. He couldn’t remember what last happened. Just this agony, the excruciating pain. Harry woke up to the clicks of locks.</p><p>“Hurry up and make breakfast”, Petunia’s voice called out to him. Harry struggled to sit up. His whole body felt painfully sore. He looked down on himself. He had crescent-shaped marks on the inside of his hands. His skin looked strange; it must be the dim light. His pyjama shirt and bottoms were to short. He rubbed his eyes to try and wake up more. What had that been? What had happened? That couldn’t have been normal. What a great start into his birthday. Maybe he imagined it or Voldemort had sent him another dream to taunt him.</p><p>Harry got up on unsteady legs and wobbled out of his room and into the bathroom. Walking seemed unexpecting difficult this morning. It was as if he had to learn to balance again. In the bathroom, he brushed his teeth and washed his face. He looked up to the mirror and froze. He looked different, beautiful and delicate. He looked like himself but not really. His cheeks were still hollow, his eyes were still sunken in, there were still the purplish rings under his eyes and his skin still looked pale. But there was a glow to him, his skin was pale, true, but it looked soft, pure and glowed. His eye colour was more intense and the dark green from before and evolved into a gleaming unnatural light green. His black hair had gotten so dark that is almost look blue. Where it was messy before, it was now a gorgeous head of curls reaching over his ears. His lips looked plum and pink, his teeth were pearl white. And he grew, at least a few inches. Harrys look wandered down, the ugly scar on the back of his hand was barley visible now. The angry red marks of the recent scar were now silver. Now that Harry saw it, he saw more silver marks, they were all over his body. It looked like delicate silver tattoos now decorated his whole form. Harry looked up again. The silver lines were even on his face, he hadn’t noticed them before. The tattoos formed a silver rim on his forehead. The lightning bolt scar was still there but it had faded like every other scar he had. It looked, it looked pretty.</p><p>Harry shuddered and took a step back from the mirror. He knew that he hadn’t been the manliest man before, but silver rims? Plum pink lips? Was this a joke? He reached with his hand between his legs, still there. At least something. The next think he notices was that because he grew, he looked even scrawnier than before. That didn’t sit well with Harry either. He asked himself again, why? And also, why him? Then the numbness washed over him again, does it even matter? It doesn’t. What is this going to change? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. He knew that he had come in some kind of creature inheritance, but the only thing that change was that he wasn’t going to die a human but the bloody thing he was. He didn’t know, honestly. He still bleeds red, he still breathed air, he still felt empty and guilty. Nothing had changed. Not a thing.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>He didn’t know if he was lucky or if it was just a coincident. Petunia had made breakfast and all of them where in the dining room eating breakfast not paying him any attention. When he went into the kitchen, there was just a piece of paper waiting for him. Almost all of it was garden work. He looked out of the window. It was still early but he could tell that is was going to be a hot summer day. The sun was already out and some birds sang. The back yard looked idyllic and Harry almost believed the illusion. To him, the back yard was an escape but also a torture place.</p><p>On the one hand, he was away from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. He was alone and had time for himself. On the other side, Aunt Petunia made him always do the gardening, doesn’t matter the weather, doesn’t matter the condition he was in. He had had many colds from working in the rain and many sunburns from working in to unforgiving sun. Now, it did bother him anymore. He was used to be in constant pain, to always be arching. He had come to value the alone time more.</p><p>Harry forced his glance away from the window. He could hear the Dursleys eating. The noises of food being chewed, tea being sipped, the smacking of lips, the grinding of teeth. He could hear them breathing, Dudley and Vernon being out of breath from eating, kind of disgusting. Aunt Petunia sighing. Suddenly it grew to loud, the noise washed over him like a wave, Harry turned on his heel and went outside into the backyard.</p><p>Tend to roses, mow the lawn, cut the bushed, weed the weed, water the flower beds.</p><p>While doing all this or at least trying to get it all done, Harry felt anxious. What if somebody saw him? What if Petunia saw him? Would she kick him out? He hoped not. What was he anyways? Was he an abnormality?</p><p>“Don’t day dream boy! Get back to work”, he heard Petunia’s voice from behind him. Shocked, he looked up. He must have looked like a deer looking into headlights, eyes wide and mouth lightly open. Petunia had already turned around, deeming him unfit for her attention. He felt strange, maybe relieved? Did she accept him for what he was? No that couldn’t be. It just could not. Petunia always found something to complain about, she would have said something. So maybe, possibly, perhaps, she didn’t see him like he saw himself? It had to be.</p><p>Harry shook his head and went back to his work. Maybe it had just been a coincidence, he had to test this again. Uncle Vernon would voice his opinion, he was sure of it.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry was in the kitchen preparing breakfast when something else than a fresh summer breeze came through the window. An owl flew in and dropped a letter in front of him. Harry could catch it barely before it fell into the pan with the bacon. A little unsure he looked at the letter. Had he done something wrong? Maybe he had done magic without knowing and now the ministry wanted to snap his wand. He turned the letter in his hands and was greeted by the Hogwarts-crest on red wax. He breathed out the breath he didn’t know he had been holding. But then it hit him, this were the results of the OWLs.</p><p>With shaky hands he broke the red wax. The envelope laid heavy in his hands. The Parchment felt oddly smooth under his fingertips. He pulled out the letter and the envelope dropped onto the kitchen counter. His eyes scanned the paper. The hand holding the letter slowly dropped down. His insides formed into a knot. For a moment he was choking on air.</p><p>He failed History of Magic and Divination. In Defence against the Dark Arts he only scored an E. He had no O’s. In Charms and Transfiguration, he had only gotten an A. That means he could not proceed doing his N.E.W.T.s in these subjects.</p><p>For a moment he just stood there, shocked, in silence. The bacon was frying next to him, the oil was spraying up and thus creating a sound. The clock in the kitchen was ticking away. The half open fridge door was beeping, trying to remind somebody to close it. The birds were singing outside and all Harry could think of was, why the world was going on? Why hadn’t it stopped?</p><p>Harry didn’t feel anything for a moment, he was empty, a rather pleasant feeling, then everything rebounded back into him and the guilt and shame hit him. He was a failure; he couldn’t account to anything in his life. How was he suppose to kill a madman when he couldn’t even get an O in Defense?</p><p>He chuckled. Well, he had an E in potions, Snape would probably spit out his black coffee if he’d known.</p><p>Harry forced his attention back to the bacon and flipped it. His relatives would not be happy if it were to burn. His stomach twisted and he was a little nauseous. He didn’t know if it was because of his marks or because of the sweet smell of the meat frying in the pan.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>It felt as if his chest, his ribcage and his stomach were torn open and all his intestines were falling out of him. He tries so pick them up and shove them back in but the bloody mess is slipping through his fingers. His insides are spilled out in front of him. They dangle on a thread; the only thing connects them to him. He doesn’t know if he should cut it or pull on it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He was choking on his own blood. He tried to spit it out but even more was coming up and blocking his airways.</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry laid awake in his bed. The room was mostly dark but a few strands of light found their way through the window. He was on his back, starring on the ceiling. His mind felt numb where as his body was burning. He felt like he had no perspective anymore. The future, it held nothing but pain for him.</p><p>First, there was this guy without a nose hunting and trying to kill him. He supposes if he told Voldemort to fuck off, he would probably not be so kind to follow the order. He felt left alone with the problem. Everybody just expected him to fight and also come out with a victory. Nobody was concerned with how in the seven worlds he was supposed to do that. Not even he himself knew. How great.</p><p>His friends. His “friends”. His acquaintances who haven’t even bothered to write him the whole summer. Not even on his birthday. He didn’t know what to do about them. Harry knew Ron envied him. For what he didn’t know. Gladly he would give Ron all the fame for a second of peace. Gladly he would let Ron take his place. The problem was, Ron just saw what he wanted to see. He saw all the flashes and lights but did not experience the moments of blindness and discomfort. He did not understand the task given, forced, on Harry. To kill someone. True, to kill a monster but one has to first come to peace with the thought of ending a life. Ron did not know the sacrifices he had to give. All the people dying, Sirius, dead. His parents, dead. Ron did not see what he already had. A family, a loving family. It was rather sad. Truly. And Hermione, well Hermione was Hermione. What was there more to say? She believes in authority, she believed in books and she also believed that they could do no wrong. Who was he to criticize? She was there to help him study, to help him do his homework and anything beyond that, there was not much. He once thought that she was his voice of reason but now he thought otherwise.</p><p>His thoughts returned to the conclusion he had come to. To the idea that had formed in his head. Could he ever come to peace with the thought of killing someone? Even though it was “just” Voldemort. Even though it would be a monster he will kill. Even though he would save lives. Harry didn’t know. He truly didn’t and to be honest, at the moment he didn’t care. All these people counting on him, all this sheer pressure, seemingly focused on him. It choked him. There was no way out, no secret escape, no short cut. But, what if he couldn’t? What if he was not good enough? What if he failed? What if he was a disappointment? His marks proved it. He wasn’t good at anything, really. He was nothing special. Maybe they, all the people, maybe they could find someone else fighting for them? Did it really have to be him?</p><p>Why couldn’t they just leave him be. Wasn’t his life miserable enough?</p><p>Maybe they liked to see him suffer.</p><p>And he suffered.</p><p>Silently.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was dark but not cold. Harry sat on a swing, pushing himself forward with one foot. Sand got into his shoe but he didn’t bother to shake it out because more would just get into it later. He had needed an escape from everything, a break out. Here, time stood still, at least for a second. He felt the hopelessness and the numbness but it was easier to just breathe. For a second, he didn’t need to think and just concentrated on breathing. The air flowed easily into his lungs and he could smell the fresh summer night.</p><p>He was glad that Dudley and his gang didn’t find him yet and he had a few moments to himself. He wondered what he would do when they found him. Maybe he should stop running and just- no, he stopped the thought. He wasn’t going to stop trying. At least for now.</p><p>The sand was darker where he disturbed it. It formed a weird pattern on the ground. He looked at it, it looked like nothing, like dirt. It reminded him of the few times he tried to draw anything. To say the least, he could have only made a name for himself in the modern art community if he ever wanted to go into art. He let himself swing a little. His feet dragging on the ground. The sky war clear tonight and he saw a variety of starts in the sky. They were so beautiful and tiny he couldn’t find words for them. He could just look up and stare.</p><p>He wanted to forget for this one moment. Wanted to forget his parents, Voldemort, Sirius, his burden, his recent academic failures, his change and this new side of him. Now, in this very moment, there was just him. He enjoyed it and dreaded the moment this glimpse of normality was over. When he was back at being a worthless freak.</p><p>He needed to be back before Dudley was so his Aunt would let him back into the house. He always managed to slip into the house just seconds before Dudley did. Except this one time. He had to sleep in the slide of the playground. The next morning, he returned and made breakfast.</p><p>He slowly got up, not wanting to return just yet. He walked slowly, looking at the scenery. Everything looked peaceful but also a little lonely and creepy at night. Especially the playground. It was just such a contrast; in daytime the place was full of life and children laughter. But now it was eerily quiet and abandonment. Harry liked it at night better. The slide stood there, empty, then there. A noise. Something was in the bushes. Harry’s head snapped around, looking at the green leaves expectantly. For a second, he saw someone jump out of the bushes and murdering him. Nothing happened. It was quiet again, this eerie silence filling up the space. He wondered if he just imagined it. If it had been a produced of his scared mind.</p><p>Harry turned around, trying to forget it and walked away. When he almost reached the end of the playground he looked back. He hadn’t been able to supress the urge. Just for a second. There wouldn’t be anything anyways. Black eyes starred at him. It felt as if they were boring into his soul. He felt naked and stripped. The rest of the way Harry ran home.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>It was dark and the air was frosty cold. When Harry breathed out white smoky air resurfaced and was then blown away. First Harry thought that he couldn’t see anything and that the darkness around him was impenetrable, that it was laid over him like a thick blanket not letting get any sound through. He was wrong because he could clearly make out that he was sitting in some kind of circle. He was surrounded by chalk markings, they spread around him like a spider web forming mysterious patterns and maybe even a language. And the dead centre of them was he. He was the focus, he felt strange realising it. It didn’t feel like he just learned that information but rather that he realised this fact as something he should have known. Suddenly it hit him, something that has been bothering him but wasn’t sure what it has been. It was the eerie silence that consumed everything. This blanket was even thicker than the other one. It was so quiet that he could hear the slight ring in his ears as well as his pumping heart. All this echoed inside of him and it felt much louder than it should have been. He reached up with his hands, clasping his head between them. It was so silent and loud at the same time, his heart beat faster and faster and the ringing got louder and louder, it felt like it couldn’t possibly get louder but then it did. He screamed but his voice was swallowed by the thick blanket. He thought his body must burst or rip in half, he thought he couldn’t bear it anymore.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then, suddenly, it stopped. Harry fell back, relieved because he thought that it was over. When he saw light from behind is eyelids, he opened them. The chalk markings had begun to shine and shimmer in a white light. Fascinated Harry had to watch them. He couldn’t redirect his glance. Then, he was not alone anymore. He was surrounded by five hooded figures, all of them starring down at him. He didn’t know how he knew it because he couldn’t make out what was under their hoods but he could feel their glances crawling up his skin. It felt itchy and it burned. He felt like he should want to escape but reality was that he didn’t want to. Something inside him told him that he was save, that he should stay where he is. He closed his eyes again.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry woke up in his bed soaked in sweat. His breathing was going a little harder than it should be and he felt a little heavier than he should feel. Thinking of his dream he felt strange, it was a strange dream after all. Ruffling his hair, he couldn’t think of a meaning for it. There was this other side of him, the one which had been there since the change many nights before, it felt content. It felt longing, hopeful. Weird, it was the first time Harry really distinguished between himself and his new other side.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>
