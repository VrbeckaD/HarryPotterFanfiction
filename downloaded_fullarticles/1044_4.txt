    <p>Love came in all shapes and sizes, and one Harry Potter understood this now. </p>
<p>He watched as Cedric and Cho danced, and he was filled to the brim with jealousy. But, to his dismay, he found out that he was jealous for rather unusual reasons.</p>
<p>He heard a familiar sound, and felt Mad-Eye Moody's hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"I know what's going through your mind now, son." Moody grinned in a rather creepy manner </p>
<p>"You can read minds?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in a way." Moody revealed "My magical eye allows me to peek into your mind."</p>
<p>"And you understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Moody affirmed "I am gay too, and the object of my affections doesn't return my feelings either."</p>
<p>"Really?" Harry asked "Who is it?</p>
<p>"D.....Dumbledore." Moody said "We've been friends for so long. I've been wanting him to take our relationship to the next level, but he's too hung up on Grindelwald to care."</p>
<p>"Oh." Harry nodded, turning around to stare some more at Cedric and Cho, who were doing a macarena.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-Moody's mind-</p>
</center>Barty Crouch Junior was prostrated in front of his Dark Lord, whose bald head reflected the sunlight.<p>He was wearing a wedding dress for some reason, while Voldemort was dressed in a tuxedo.</p>
<p>"Please, my Lord." Barty gasped "Take me and ravage me under the moonlight."</p>
<p>"I can't." Voldemort said quietly "You're too lovable and loyal for that. We'll have to do it in bed, after I take over the world. For now, let us kiss."</p>
<p>Barty closed his eyes, and felt a kiss on the lips. When he opened his eyes, it wasn't Voldemort who was kissing him.</p>
<p>It was a Dementor.</p>
<p>Well, his soul belonged to his Dark Lord anyway.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-Real world-</p>
</center>Moody frowned. He almost let slip who the true object of his affections was. Luckily, he managed to cover it up well.<p>He watched as Harry seized Cho and began dancing with her in order to make Cedric jealous.</p>
<p>"Note to self." he murmured "Tell Voldemort to kill Cedric."</p>
<p>He hated the little brat anyway, so killing his crush would be exhilarating.</p>
<p>After all, if he couldn't have his crush's affections, then no one else will.</p>
