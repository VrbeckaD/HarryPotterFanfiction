    <p align="center"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus Lupin was smart. He knew a lot of things. </p>
<p align="left">One thing he'd known for sure was that in the summer of 1971, when all the young wizards and witches of his age would receive their Hogwarts letter, his mailbox would remain void of any letters addressed to himself. He had accepted it a long time ago, and while it upset him, he didn't blame anyone. Sure, he would love to step into the school of witchcraft and wizardry that generations upon generations of wizards and witches spoke so highly of, but it was fair. He couldn't expect the great Albus Dumbledore to place hundreds of students in danger just for him, it was positively unfair to even think about it. He was a monster. His affliction had ruined his life and it was not fair to risk ruining anyone else's - or even taking it - because of it. </p>
<p align="left">At 11 years old, he sat at the table reading a muggle book that his mother, Hope, had given him a few days earlier. He wasn't particularly enjoying it, but he was determined to finish it to make his mother happy, the last thing he wanted was to disappoint her. She had been good to him, she could have run back to her normal, muggle life when he was bitten, he wouldn't have blamed her. But she didn't, she cut all ties with them when they began to question some things about their lives. She stayed. She was one of the only things that made him feel loved - <em>human.</em> He was too lost in his train of thought to notice a small white envelope be placed neatly in front of him, until the voice of Hope Lupin herself rang in his ears.</p>
<p align="left">"It's here! This is it, right? Oh, Remus, I am so excited for you!"</p>
<p align="left">His eyes widened as he closed his book and placed it sloppily on the table next to him before examining the letter further. It had a blood red wax seal with the Hogwarts crest imprinted into it, and on the underside it read <em>Remus Lupin, Lupin cottage.</em> Hope watched carefully as he opened it and began reading. His vision had blurred a little, but he got the general gist of things, picking up small sentences like <em>Dear Remus Lupin </em>and <em>accepted into Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. </em></p>
<p align="left">"This must be a mistake." He muttered, putting the letter down. He couldn't allow himself to believe it to be true, any minute now he would wake up in his bed, the sunlight creeping through the curtains, no letter in sight, and none on the way.</p>
<p align="left">"What do you mean? I'll fetch your father and we'll take a trip to Diagon Alley right away, we're so excited to go school shopping with you!" </p>
<p align="left">Right at that moment, Remus' father, Lyall, walked into the room, sitting down next to his wife and son.</p>
<p align="left">"Someone's Hogwarts letter arrived, I see!" He began, before his smile faltered, upon seeing the wary and upset look on his sons face. "What's wrong?" </p>
<p align="left">"Dad, I can't go. Surely they can't let a-" He racked his brain for a more appropriate word than monster. It was the truth, he was a monster, but his parents were never too happy to hear him refer to himself as one. They were in denial. They didn't want to accept that their only child wasn't even a human. Just a burden. He continued. "someone like me. I can't go. What if I hurt someone? What would we do? I'd be put to sleep like an animal, and I'd deser-" </p>
<p align="left">He was cut off by his fathers stern, but gentle voice. </p>
<p align="left">"Remus John Lupin. I will not have you speaking of yourself that way. You're a bright young man, and I think you will make a fantastic wizard. Your situation will always be your situation, but it is not a burden to us or anyone else. You deserve a place in Hogwarts just as much as any other witch or wizard. Albus Dumbledore is an extraordinary man, and I can assure you that if he doesn't already have a plan to deal with your situation, there is one being conjured as we speak. Now, go put on your robes, we have some school supplies to buy." </p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">***</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">It was a rare occasion that Remus allowed himself to dream of what it would be like to board the Hogwarts express. He had never wanted to build false hope, and if he were to be honest, he was still slightly expecting to wake from a dream, disappointed that it was all fake. But he hadn't, and he wouldn't, because he was about to step onto platform 9 and 3/4, and the moment he walked through that wall, he saw a sight infinitely more amazing than he had ever imagined it - even if he'd only let himself do so once or twice. </p>
<p align="left">It was packed with wizards and witches bidding farewell to their parents, pushing trolleys carrying luggage and pets, the great red steaming engine sitting behind it all. It was huge, bigger than he could have thought before. He didn't see man other students that looked to be first years, but he figured that maybe they were already on the train, eager to be on their way. </p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">------------------------</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Sirius Black had almost become lost in himself as he stood on platform 9 and 3/4 for the first time. He watched all of the other new first years beaming at their parents as they said goodbye, excited to start a new phase in their lives. </p>
<p align="left">If he had a mirror to look at himself, he would see a miserable (But oh so well mannered, because apparently, that means something) heir to the Black fortune, groomed impeccably, staring at his hostile mother, wanting nothing more than to spend a few months away from her. He had been waiting for this day for years, he had finally gotten a chance to try to break away from the expectations that were placed onto him the moment he was born. He was ready to step onto the train and make friends, real friends.</p>
<p align="left">His younger brother, Regulus Black, stood next to him, still a year to go before he himself would attend Hogwarts. Regulus was one of the only members of the family, along with his cousin Andromeda, that he genuinely loved. He'd not yet been corrupted by the views and practices of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black, and if Sirius could have anything to do with it, it would never happen. Reg was good, too good for the Blacks, and as much as he was looking forward to leaving for school, he was worried his mother and father, Walburga and Orion Black, would take the time with Regulus to recruit him to whatever weird cult he was sure that they were part of. </p>
<p align="left">"Reg?" He tried to grasp his brothers attention before he boarded the train. The smaller of the two looked up at him expectantly. </p>
<p align="left">"I'm only an owl away, and it won't be long until we're boarding this train together next year. I'll write to you, tell you all about Hogwarts and all my new friends. Will you be ok without me?" He had always been very close to his brother, being only a year apart in age, as well as the fact that he had taken it upon himself to try steer Regulus in the right direction. He knew himself that he shouldn't know so much at just 11 years old, but growing up in the house of Black meant that childhood didn't exactly exist, not for him anyway, considering his parents weren't very discreet with the fact that Regulus was their favourite son. </p>
<p align="left">Regulus nodded. "I'm gonna miss you, Sirius. Promise you'll write?" </p>
<p align="left">"Of course I will. I have to go, be good, ok Reg?" He patted his brother on the back before returning a hostile wave to his mother and heading into the train. </p>
<p align="left">"Sirius!" He closed his eyes for a second and continued walking, speeding up slightly, ignoring the voice. "Sirius! Wait!" He finally stopped and turned around, to be faced by his cousin Narcissa, who was followed closely by Lucius Malfoy, whom she was apparently dating. The two were only about 16 or 17, and were already making wedding arrangements for after their graduation.</p>
<p align="left">"Yes, Cissa?" Sirius knew that she hated the childhood nickname that he continued to use. His words were dripping with venom, which made her sophisticated stance and fake smile falter slightly. </p>
<p align="left">"I've told you before to stop calling me that, Sirius. Now come along, we have a compartment down this way." She gestured beyond Lucius, who was still standing behind her, a smug and arrogant smirk on his lips.</p>
<p align="left">"I don't think I will, actually. I'm going to go sit with some people who don't make me want to tear my hair out." He turned to leave when he felt a small, bony hand grip his wrist. </p>
<p align="left">"Now, Sirius, you know I can't let that happen. I've promised auntie Walburga that I'll watch you while I'm still at Hogwarts and that I will do. Now, please, don't be difficult." Lucius had edged closer, as if he would step in if needs be. <em>Arrogant twat.</em></p>
<p align="left">Sirius shook his arm free of her surprisingly tight grip before setting quickly down the opposite side of the train, hearing the murmurs of Lucius Malfoy's voice telling Narcissa that 'he's not worth it, dear'. At this point, he didn't much care who he was in a compartment with, as long as it wasn't anyone he was related to. He peeped his head into many compartments, seeing that most of them were full, he had begun to worry that he'd have to return to his cousins after all when he arrived at the very last compartment, in which sat just one boy, anxiously staring at an old, battered looking pocket watch. He looked up as Sirius opened the door. </p>
<p align="left">"Hello, I'm Sirius." He said in a rehearsed voice. <em>Always introduce oneself as you enter a room.</em> His mothers voice rang through his ears, like nails on a chalkboard. "Do you mind if I sit here? The trains packed." </p>
<p align="left">The boy, who had possibly the messiest mop of brown hair he had ever seen along with circular spectacles, smiled a toothy grin at him and stood up. "Of course! I'm James, by the way, James Potter. I'm waiting for my friend, Peter, the bloody git is always late, the train is going to leave soon!" The boy, <em>James Potter,</em> shook Sirius' hand before sitting back down, his mouth still curled into a smile.</p>
<p align="left">Sirius recognised the name. The Potters, he had been told throughout his entire life, were no better than a muggle born or half blood. Blood traitors, his mother always said. They may be purebloods through and through but their willingness to associate with muggles and muggle borns alike was shameful. Sirius worried that the moment James heard his last name he would make an excuse to leave, Sirius didn't want to be associated with the Blacks, he held no such views about muggles or half bloods. the way he saw it, if you managed to date back far enough, there had to be a muggle somewhere in the bloodline, the idea of being 'pureblood' wasn't only ridiculous, but probably didn't even exist. </p>
<p align="left">"I'm Sirius Black." He finally responded, to which James lifted his head away from his watch.</p>
<p align="left">"You're a black?" He asked innocently. </p>
<p align="left">"Yeah." Sirius responded, a slight amount of shame in his voice. </p>
<p align="left">With that, a small and stout boy ran into the compartment, sweaty and disgruntled as he looked at James, then to Sirius, slightly confused. </p>
<p align="left">"Blimey, I almost didn't make it, the trains leaving now. Who are you?" </p>
<p align="left">The tone of his last question was quite rude, technically, but Sirius didn't much care, this boys last name wasn't Black, so he looked past it.</p>
<p align="left">"This is Sirius Black, Pete, we all look very pretty today and the weather is simply splendid, now, all the small talk is out of the way, can you please sit down and get excited with me!" The boy was exasperated, looking as if he hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks, though Sirius doubted that that was the case.</p>
<p align="left">Peter gave Sirius an odd look before sitting down next to James and staring at him expectantly.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm going to be the king of this school." He said cockily, folding his arms across his chest. Peter nodded eagerly and Sirius stifled a laugh. "I'm going to be a Gryffindor, and by the time I leave in my seventh year, there won't be a student in that school who doesn't know my name." </p>
<p align="left">He was cocky, but not in an arrogant sort of way, at least that's how Sirius saw it, it's not like he'd been talking to this boy for long, but he could tell that he was kind, cocky, but kind and nice.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm going to be a Gryffindor, too." Sirius said surely.</p>
<p align="left">James frowned slightly, tilting his head like a puppy.</p>
<p align="left">"Aren't all the Blacks in Slytherin? Family tradition and all that?" He asked genuinely. </p>
<p align="left">"I'm not like the other Blacks. I'm no Slytherin, just you watch." Sirius said defensively.</p>
<p align="left">James and Peter nodded,exchanging an unsure look before continuing to chat excitedly about Hogwarts, what they'd heard about it and what they wanted to achieve in their first year. it felt good, Sirius thought, to speak to people his own age without his mother standing behind him telling him to stand up straight and correct his grammar. he liked these boys, they seemed fun.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">-----------------------</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Remus, was already regretting his choice of compartment, just 10 minutes into the train ride. He had sat in an empty one when he boarded the train early, settling in to do some reading, when just as the train pulled off, a group of third year girls came in and sat down, chatting animatedly amongst themselves about things he didn't much care about, like which of the boys in their year had grown over the summer and who is the fittest. He decided that he should quietly excuse himself when one of the girls' voices became very squeaky as she talked about the boy she had been owling over the summer. </p>
<p align="left">He walked along the train with his book in his hand, his index finger nestled in the page he had stopped reading on to avoid losing his place. He figured that he'd be best off going to the end of the train, maybe that would be filled with some of the quieter children. He reached the very last compartment, peeping in and seeing three boys chatting excitedly, one of them gesticulating wildly as he told what looked to be a very exaggerated story. Even though he had originally sought out a quieter compartment, something about this one had drawn to him, so he opened the door, and stared back as the boy with the glasses stopped talking and looked at him. </p>
<p align="left">"Uh, sorry, I was just looking for somewhere to sit, I'll go if-" Remus had sensed that he had interrupted a group of friends that didn't want to be disturbed, but his sentence was cut off by the same, bespectacled boy waving him off violently and speaking. </p>
<p align="left">"Nonsense, come in, mate. Are you a first year, too?" He asked. </p>
<p align="left">Remus took a seat tentatively next to a boy with raven black hair, grown down to his chin, his eyes lingering innocently on the said boy before he answered. </p>
<p align="left">"Erm, yes, I am." He folded the page of his book before setting it down on the seat between himself and the boy with black hair. He could have sworn he'd seen his face before, but he couldn't quite remember where.</p>
<p align="left">"Excellent! I'm James Potter, this here is Peter Pettigrew and that's Sirius Black." He smiled cheesily as he gestured to the other boys. </p>
<p align="left">
  <em>Sirius Black.</em>
</p>
<p align="left">Sirius watched as the boy scanned his face, a look of discomfort settling in. </p>
<p align="left">"Don't let the name scare you off, mate." </p>
<p align="left">"Yeah." James butted in. "Don't get me wrong, I've only known the bloke about 15 minutes but he's no Black. Not really."</p>
<p align="left">"James." Peter said in a warning voice, worried that Sirius would take offence to his comment. He had made it very clear that he didn't want to be associated with the Blacks, but after all, they're still his family, who knows what the heir of Black would do if he was angered.</p>
<p align="left">Sirius gave him a soft and gentle look before responding. </p>
<p align="left">"No, Peter, he's right. I'm not a Black. I'm going to be different. I'm not a pureblood worshipping arsehole, I'm just Sirius." </p>
<p align="left">Sirius looked at the boy, who was yet to introduce himself. He looked very nervous, his small hands fiddling with the sleeves of his wooly jumper. He wore brown pants that just grazed his ankles with a black, soft looking jumper and some battered black loafers. His hair was an ambery brown and his eyes matched. Sirius had never seen anyone with eyes the same colour as this boys, they almost seemed like the eyes of a majestic animal rather than of a human.</p>
<p align="left">"What's your name?" </p>
<p align="left">The boys eyes widened as he stammered out an apology, still fiddling with his jumper.</p>
<p align="left">"Oh, sorry, I- sorry, my name is Remus. Remus Lupin." </p>
<p align="left">Sirius smiled.</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>Remus. Suits him.</em>
</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">----------------------------</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">When the four of them stepped off of the train, laughing and chatting as if they'd known each other forever, Sirius felt content. It was when they looked up and saw a very, very large man standing on the platform, that silence fell upon not only them, but all the other first years, too. All of the upperclassmen continued to walk, as if nothing was different, nothing was strange. </p>
<p align="left">"Firs' years' this way, c'mon now, firs' years." The man yelled as he started walking off, lantern in hand. He had a long beard and hair grazing his hips, slightly greying. There was no telling how old he was. </p>
<p align="left">James, Sirius, Peter and Remus exchanged looks before following him hurriedly.</p>
<p align="left">The man lead them to a large lake, beside which were rows and rows of little black boats.</p>
<p align="left">"Righ'." He grunted, and a hush fell over the students. "I'm Hagrid, Rubeus Hagrid, keeper of keys an' grounds at Hogwarts. We're all gon' take a wee boat ride." He smiled. </p>
<p align="left">For a man so large and intimidating, he seemed gentle and kind. Sirius turned to James Potter, who was still staring, awestruck at Hagrid, his neck sore from looking so far up to get a view at the mans face, or rather, the small portion of his face that wasn't being covered by excessive amounts of hair. Suddenly, James snapped out of his trance and looked back at Sirius, the look on his face slightly concerned. </p>
<p align="left">"Mate, I know you say that you're no Black, and I believe you, I do, but-" He hesitated for a moment. "Well, what happens if you are sorted into Slytherin? What will you do?" </p>
<p align="left">Sirius was slightly taken aback, but he was quick to reply. </p>
<p align="left">"I'm going to tell the sorting hat that I'm not a Slytherin. I'm a Gryffindor, through and through." He crossed his arms, looking to James as if he was waiting for the other boy to object. James simply smiled weakly and nodded, silently worrying about how it would unfold if the sorting hat was placed upon Sirius' head and yelled the one word he didn't want to hear.</p>
<p align="left">When they arrived to the castle, every single one of the first years realised that even though they had just boated across a lake with a giant, intimidating looking man, he was not nearly as unsettling as the witch who stood waiting for them at the entrance to the great hall.</p>
<p align="left">"Minerva McGonagall." Remus said quietly enough so that only those standing right next to him had a chance of hearing. </p>
<p align="left">"How do you know?" Sirius asked. </p>
<p align="left">Remus' face turned a light shade of pink as he looked at Black and quickly muttered 'chocolate frogs, I guess.'</p>
<p align="left">The witch cleared her throat, drawing everyone's attention back to her. She stood tall with a tight grey bun and half moon glasses resting on her nose, an unimpressed look settling on her aging face.</p>
<p align="left">"Ok, I will not repeat myself so it would be greatly appreciated if everyone would listen up, thank you. There are four houses; Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. You will each be called up one by one during the sorting ceremony where the sorting hat will decide which house you belong to, you will then go to sit at the appropriate table, is that understood?" There was a quiet murmur of agreement before she nodded and opened the doors to the great hall.</p>
<p align="left">To a pureblood wizard, like Sirius or James, it was beautiful. The ceiling had been enchanted to look like the night sky, tranquil and quiet, the half moon sat nestled into a cluster of clouds. Pretty.</p>
<p align="left">To Remus Lupin, a halfblood who had never taken much notice to the magical world, having convinced himself that he would never truly be part of it, it was the most magnificent thing he had ever laid eyes on. He looked around and saw a muggle born girl with bright red hair staring with the same awestruck look on her face as himself.</p>
<p align="left">"Wonderful, isn't it? This is all so overwhelming. I'm Lily, by the way, Lily Evans. What's your name?" She smiled genuinely and stared at Remus, waiting for a reply. </p>
<p align="left">He was about to open his mouth when another boys voice interrupted what could have been the start of a conversation.</p>
<p align="left">"Alright Evans, how are you doing this fine day?" The confident voice of James Potter boomed as he ran his hand through his unruly hair.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm fine, thank you very much, though I was just <em>trying</em> to have a conversation with- erm, well, we were just getting to names, I suppose." </p>
<p align="left">"Remus." James said, wrapping his arm around the slightly smaller boys shoulders. "This is Remus Lupin. We met on the train, nice bloke, very smart. Think we'll be good friend, eh, Rem?" </p>
<p align="left">Remus blushed at the nickname, he had never had one of those before. He had never really had friends before at all, James' words were more than likely empty, it was the first day, they would all make new, more interesting friends once they'd settled in, and Remus would be left to his own devices again. He didn't mind, he was used to it. It had been that way since he was bitten at 4 years old. Life goes on, he supposed.</p>
<p align="left">Even so, he answered "Y-yeah, yeah definitely." </p>
<p align="left">"Well, nice to meet you Remus." The girl smiled. </p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">***</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">The sorting ceremony had been quite fun at the beginning, though after a while, Sirius Black had become agitated. </p>
<p align="left">He had assumed that they would be called alphabetically, but apparently not. He was very used to being one of the first people called at times like this, having a surname that begun with a B, however there had to have been at least 60 people sorted, the seconds felt as though they would never end and he just wanted to be up there, with the hat on his head. He wanted to see the look on Narcissa's face when the hat shouted anything but Slytherin. </p>
<p align="left">"Bellatrix Black." </p>
<p align="left">The students fell silent as Sirius' cousin walked arrogantly to the stool, on which she sat for less than a second before the hat shouted 'Slytherin!'</p>
<p align="left">"James Potter." </p>
<p align="left">James confident aura faded for a moment when his name was called, however he quickly regained it by the time he sat on the stool, facing the Great Hall. The hat sat on his head for a few moments before making a decision.</p>
<p align="left">"GRYFFINDOR!"</p>
<p align="left">He smiled and hopped off of the chair, walking happily to the respective table and sitting down, shaking hands with a sixth year as he made himself comfortable.</p>
<p align="left">"Sirius Black." </p>
<p align="left">As anxious as he had been to be sorted, Sirius froze for a moment when he heard his name. He was looking forward to this, but he had not anticipated how daunting it would be to be sat on a stool in front of everyone, the eyes of his cousins Narcissa and Bellatrix burning into him when the hat sat idle on his head for 10, 20, 30, 40 seconds. He felt as if he'd been sitting there forever, he'd be in fifth year by the time he was sorted. </p>
<p align="left">'Please not Slytherin.' He pleaded silently. As sure as he had acted that he was a Gryffindor through and through, he was worried that he would have to face the music and go sit down with his cousins, accepting his fate as the heir of Black.</p>
<p align="left">"Ah! You are not as easily placed as the other Blacks. You're intelligent, but rash, yes, very rash. Many options, but I've made my decision, bold as it may be...GRYFFINDOR!"</p>
<p align="left">Narcissa's face fell and Bellatrix let out an audible gasp, many other students following suit. Whispers were exchanged wildly as he made his way over to the Gryffindor table, taking a seat next to James as every pair of eyes in the hall stared at him.</p>
<p align="left">"Nice one mate! You made it" </p>
<p align="left">Sirius remembers the fleeting excitement as Remus and Peter were both sorted into Gryffindor alongside the two of them, small chats being exchanged about how lucky it was to have found friends so early, to all be sorted into the same house and blah blah blah, and as ecstatic as Sirius was about having broken the mould for the Blacks, and perhaps, one day, being seen as his own person rather than just the heir of Black, he felt sick. He was nervous, he hated the life he lived, but it was all he had ever known.</p>
