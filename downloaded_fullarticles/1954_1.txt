    <p>Hagrid had seen tonnes of cases like his. Of neglect. Of willful deprivation. Of abuse of any and all kinds. </p>
<p>Harry was so tiny, so skinny. There was a deadness in his lovely green eyes. A cynicism far too mature for  an eleven-year-old. </p>
<p>It was a matter of fact that kids like him slipped through the cracks far too often and far too long. </p>
<p>Most times Hagrid left the cases at work, never brought them home. But, here he was -- bringing his case into his very own house. </p>
<p>It wasn't a very grand place to live, in the scheme of things. Much less picturesque then the suburban house on Privet Drive. No manicured lawns here. </p>
<p>It was more . . . of cottage of sorts in a plot of land he inherited from his dad. It was right beside a small forest -- which suited Hagrid just fine. </p>
<p>He loved nature, he loved plants and he especially loved animals. There was even a chicken or two in his backyard and a rather nice -- if said so himself -- vegetable garden.  </p>
<p>Harry peered up at the dipulated cottage with the funny, lopsided roof. The paint was a peeling yellow -- Hagrid made a mental note to get that redone -- and it looked to be rather small. One floor and maybe a cellar. </p>
<p>There was a smattering of houses down the road -- most of them of similar or smaller stock. </p>
<p>"You live here?" the bespectacled young boy asked. </p>
<p>Hagrid made what he thought was friendly-enough smile. </p>
<p>"It's not much," he admited, "but it's 'ome!" </p>
<p>Harry nodded. He clutched his backpack straps. All of his worldly possessions were in the small, faded red backpack. </p>
<p>Maybe a few pairs of boxers, a shirt and shorts. Hagrid told him not to bother with the disturbingly over-large clothing Harry's terrible aunt and uncle forced him to wear. </p>
<p>He'd get Harry more fitting clothes and . . . every other necessity. </p>
<p>"Well, 'e should go in, eh?" he asked jovially. </p>
<p>Harry shrugged. </p>
<p>Hagrid took that as a yes and lumbered towards the three-stepped porch. He was large and tall. Much taller than Harry would ever get, he predicted. </p>
<p>He even had to stoop to keep from hitting his head on the doorframe. </p>
<p>Inside was hastily cleaned. The wooden floors were probably the cleanest they'd been in three months. It was an open floor plan -- well as open as a tiny little cottage could get -- and a kitchenette. The sofas were all mismatched and varying sizes. </p>
<p>Really the loveliest piece in the living area was his large, round dining table that held stacked papers and other knick knacks like a snowglobe. Thankfully there was also an old fireplace that the sofas were gathered around. </p>
<p>But, Harry hadn't a glimpse before three yapping pitbulls came throttling at him. </p>
<p>With a quickness so unlike him, Hagrid pulled Harry gently to the side. </p>
<p>"Stop!" he yelled. </p>
<p>The three ceased immediately, panting in unison. Harry blinked, surprisingly unphased by the "attack". </p>
<p>A twinkling laugh and then a man with a long white beard popped into the room from a door on the otherside of the home. It was an  old man with sparkling blue eyes and an exceedingly kind smile. His clothes were . . . he seemed to be dressed in a star-printed night robe and a set of pin-striped pair of pjamas underneath. Almost as if he had been sleeping.</p>
<p>Harry furrowed his thick black eyebrows at the sight. </p>
<p>"Ah, I'm quite sorry Hagrid -- I took a quick trip to the loo and must've forgotten to let them in yard," apolgized the amused man. </p>
<p>Hagrid laughed boisterously. </p>
<p>"Not to worry, not to worry," he reassured. </p>
<p>The old man shuffled nearer -- he was even wearing sheep slippers! This caught the boy's eyes, focusing them on the slippers. </p>
<p>"This is must be Mr. Harry Potter, is it?" asked the still unknown man. </p>
<p>Hagrid nodded enthusiastically. He firmly slapped the back of the boy's back, making him bolt up to stare directly at the other man in the home.</p>
<p>"Awh, 'orry 'arry," said Hagrid, realizing the strength of it. </p>
<p>Harry glanced up at him and shrugged. </p>
<p>This made the old man chuckle. He held out a wrinkled large hand. </p>
<p>"How do you do? My name is Albus Dumbledore," introducing himself. </p>
<p>Harry nodded in response and gingerly putting his small, boney pale hand with the man's. He shook the hand limply. </p>
<p>"Yeah, it's Harry," he mumbled in response. </p>
<p>Hagrid and Albus shared a quick glance. </p>
<p>Albus clapped his hands. </p>
<p>"Well it seems that my dog-sitting has finished. I'll be seeing you two soon, I'm sure?" he asked. </p>
<p>"'Course! Once me an' 'arry get all set, we'll ring you for dinner!" promised Hagrid. </p>
<p>Albus laughed, pleased at this. </p>
<p>"Alright, it was good meeting you Mr. Potter. You're in good hands," he told the inexpressive boy. </p>
<p>With that, he walked straight past them and out the door -- not changing into anything else. </p>
<p>They turned to watch him shut the door behind him. </p>
<p>"That's Dumbledore," Hagrid informed Harry, "'e's retired. Good man. Very good man." </p>
<p>He seemed to become lost momentarily in remembrance of sorts. </p>
<p>"Okay," was Harry's reply. </p>
<p>Hagrid looked down at him and smiled awkwardly. </p>
<p>"Well, I ought to show yer room, no?" </p>
<p>--- </p>
<p>Harry didn't really understand the scarily huge man with a scraggly, thick black beard and equally messy hair. </p>
<p>He was nice to him. For some reason he even seemed to . . . care. </p>
<p>Really, all Harry knew was that someone finally tipped off the child welfare people about the Durselys and now he was here. </p>
<p>His new guardian had let him accustomize to his new room. It wasn't exactly big -- certainly not as big as Dudley's but it was cozy. And not a broom closet. </p>
<p>The bed was a solid twin with mustard sheets. Not very appealing. Hagrid didn't seem to have much interior decorating sense. </p>
<p>There was a nice oak wardrobe, a small writing desk with a slim lamp, a wood chair to match and a drawer beside the bed with an old black rectangular digital clock. Beyond that, it was bare. </p>
<p>And it wasn't a broom closet. </p>
<p>He went up to the bed, took off his backpack and emptied it's contents on top. There were a couple of okay-quality underpants, a nice green t-shirt that matched his eyes and some make-shift denim shorts. The shorts in particular were a blessing in spite of once belonging to an obese child. </p>
<p>He thought about Dudley (even if he detested him) and wondered what the child welfare people did with him. They had been adamant about Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon being unfit parents, in more ways than their looks. </p>
<p>But Dudley was loved by them. Maybe he was left with them.</p>
<p>It didn't matter. </p>
<p>The rest of his stuff was a yellowing toothbrush, his glasses case and a picture book. It was about a little magic boy who went to a fantastical wizarding school. A little childish for eleven but it was sentimental. </p>
<p>A keepsake of the parents that must've loved him. </p>
<p>Would this Hagrid character be kind? He acted like it. Aunt Petunia acted all the time in front of the neighbours, convinced of him being a trouble-maker. </p>
<p>It didn't matter. </p>
<p>Nothing really matter, did it?</p>
