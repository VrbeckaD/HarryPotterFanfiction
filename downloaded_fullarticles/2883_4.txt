    <p>" I can't do this bloody potions homework." Albus groaned to his friend Scorpius. " It's too hard. Did Professor Campbell even go over this in class?"  Scorpius, who was lazing on a plump green chair, paid no heed to his friend. Albus groaned again and glanced around the Slytherin Common room. He and Scorpius were the last two awake.

       "Scorpiuuuuuuuuus. Help me with my potionnnnns homeworrrrrrk." Albus complained again. This time Scorpius glanced up. " I already completed my potions homework, and I took the same notes as you. Because I was paying attention. Just like you. Right?" Albus made a " oh shit" face and glanced down shamefully. Scorpius sighed through his nose. "There's a portrait of Professor Snape by the potions classroom. I'm sure your namesake will be happy to help tutor you in his second favorite subject." Scorpius muttered, finally setting his book down in an almost wistful expression.

       "Thank you so so much!" Albus exclaimed, almost spilling his inkwell when he jumped up," LET US GO FORTH!" Albus dragged Scorpius back to their bedroom. 

      " *Hush*, Albus! The other two are trying to sleep!" Scorpius whisper-shouted, horrified. " Meh. Screw them." Albus shot back. Walking briskly over to his trunk, Albus lifted the lid and rummaged around until he pulled out the instability cloak. Albus turned around, saw the exasperation etched onto the other boy's face, and smirked. " You stole James's in invisibility cloak. Again." " Yep!"</p>
