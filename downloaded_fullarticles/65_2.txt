All beginnings are different. Some beginnings are remembered as bad, some remembered as good</p><p>Rudolfa Lupin hated everything about herself. First of all, she hated her Godforsaken name, it was too girly and her parents thought it funny to make her name Wolf Wolf. She hated the red-white scars across her face, and the black-purple bite on her shoulder that revealed the monster inside her. She hated her smooth, round face. She hated her slim, curved body and her... chest. She just couldn't think of why she hated these things. She kind of just went with it most of the time, no matter how disgusted it made her feel and put it down to just being negative about herself.</p><p>She remembers the time she first arrived at Hogwarts, her light brown, shoulder length hair put into a neat ponytail and her school uniform (minus the discarded-onto-the-seat-next-to-her robe) was neat and un-crinkled. She sat in a compartment with her childhood friend, Lily Evans and they both read quietly to themselves, before being interrupted by the compartment door sliding open. Three boys stood there with excited, grinning faces. Those three boys were the beginning of a painfully good life.</p><p>She even remembers the sorting, which was probably one of her worst maybe weirdest experiences, but in the end it was also the beginning of her life at school.</p><p>"Lupin, Rudolfa!" Was called through the hall and said girl winced. She was all gangling limbs as she walked up to the stool and when she sat, her knees clashed together.</p><p>The sorting hat had wiggled around on her head, mumbling about bravery, skill but also a sense of danger and 'boy-like qualities'. In her head, Rudolfa had a silent argument with the hat, saying she wasn't boy-like at all. The hat did not listen, of course, and when it blurted out, "GRYFFINDOR" She couldn't believe her ears.</p><p>She froze for a moment, everything seemed to lay still, "me, a Gryffindor? But, I'm a monster," she thought to herself. But suddenly she had no more time to think, and the Gryffindor table had erupted into applaud and she had been nudged by Professor McGonagall over to the table.</p><p>The girl shook her head at herself and went over to the table, sitting beside Lily, who was smiling brightly at her, "and for a moment I thought you would leave me for a different house!"</p><p>Rudolfa averted her eyes, away from Lily after muttering, "oh, really?" Under her breath. Her face was turned to the boy on the other side of the table, one of the boys from earlier. He smiled at her. That was the beginning of a new feeling.</p><p>She remembers one of the most embarrassing moments in her life. The night she wasn't permitted into the girls common room.</p><p>After the sorting, her stomach was full of the feasts food and her brain was tired with sleep. She made her way into the common room, with the rest of her first year Gryffindors, listening to the instructions from the prefects.</p><p>Going down the corridor that went to the staircase leading to the girl's dormitory was interesting. Rudolfa stayed at the back of the line of girls, admiring the paintings and flowers hanging from the wall, all of which were being happily explained by Marlene McKinnon, a pretty girl she would be sharing a room with for the next seven years.</p><p>As they reached the bottom of the winding staircase, Rudolfa started to grin and felt slightly happy about herself for a sudden moment. Her first night at Hogwarts! Wow! She would soon be a proper witch, and she was excited for that.</p><p>But as she followed the girls up the stairs, the stair she was about to step onto and all the ones down to the floor became a slope, and the girl slipped backwards, sliding down the slide of what was once carpet-covered steps.</p><p>"Wh- what?" She had said to herself as Lily came rushing down the stairs to help her up, checking her body for any minor injury.</p><p>"We need to go get McGonagall," the redhead had said, a worried look on her face.</p><p>Not every beginning is good. Not every beginning is bad. For examle, the beginning of Rudolfa and Sirius' relationship, this beginning was quite a good one indeed.</p><p>Rudolfa was sat on one of the common rooms sofas. It was her second year in Hogwarts and her hatred for her body seemed to be getting worse. So she decided to sit sulking as she looked in the mirror that sat beside the fireplace, a disgusted look on her face.</p><p>The room was empty at the moment, it was past midnight and everyone was in their dorms asleep and she had no one to talk to but herself in the mirrors reflection.</p><p>She was sat in silence, listening to the small crackle of the fire, the low wisp of the wind and the quiet rustle of tree leaves, when she heard a small creaking noise. She turned to see Sirius stood in the doorway, looking wide-eyed into the room.</p><p>"Uhm, hello- Rudolfa, can i ask you something?" He said, his eyes growing wide as if a deer caught in headlights as he stepped into the room and sat beside the girl on the sofa, placing the glass cup he had in his hand on the table beside the red-orange sofa, "so, we've been friends for a while, yeah?" Rudolfa nodded, tilting her head in slight confusion, "yeah, I don't know what to sayso I'll get to the point. Will you be my girlfriend?"</p><p>Rudolfa froze. Not because of the question (because, Sirius Black asking her out? What an honor!) but because of the cringe she felt deep in her gut when Sirius said 'girlfriend'. Although her stomach squelched and churned in disgust, she smiled and nodded, "of course."</p><p>Then there's also a beginning to a new adventure. Not necessarily a physical adventure but an adventure inside the head. An adventure to find out your true identity.</p><p>"Lily, I need your help," Rudolfa said, rushing up to her best friend who was sat on a bench in the library, after pecking her boyfriend on the lips and saying a whispered goodbye to him.</p><p>Lily looked up from the book she was reading with Severus Snape and Rudolfa stepped back for a moment. She hated Snape with her whole bloody being, he was too toxic for Lily but she just didn't see it, "unless I'm interrupting your meeting with Snivellus." She hissed, holding her chin up subtly towards Severus.</p><p>"No, I'm leaving now anyway, Lupin." The boy then stood, slamming the book closed and throwing it down on the bench he was previously sat at before stomping away, mumbling under his breath about 'blood traitor women'.</p><p>Rudolfa stared after him and shook her head, "you need better friends," she said, sitting beside the gobsmacked Lily.</p><p>"You're literally my friend."</p><p>"I'm an exception." The amber-eyed girl retorted, smiling at the redhead.</p><p>She smiled back, rolling her eyes and gently punching Rudolfa's shoulder, "what's up, anyway?"</p><p>The other played awkwardly with her soft, calloused fingertips for a few moments before speaking, "you know when i told you about,, y'know.. hating my name and body-?" she looked up  when she heard a rustle to see Lily going through her small, brown school bag, and stopped speaking.</p><p>Lily pulled out a thick book of maybe 500 pages, one that looked to be made of bright colours like pink, blue and green but also dull shades of the same colours at the same time, giving it a sullen effect.</p><p>The redhead handed the book to the other and she took it, reading over the cover, "I found what you were describing from your experiences in this here book. It's a muggle book, as not many wizards discuss this topic often. But I hope it will be helpful." Lily grinned at her friend knowingly.</p><p>Rudolfa looked down at the boom titled, 'Dysphoria and Being Transgender: What Are They and What Effects Do They Have On A Person?'</p><p>Everyone remembers the best beginnings. If that beginning is the start of a friendship, life or love, it's always remembered. </p><p>Lily pushed Rudolfa over to the sofa the three marauders were sat. The rest of the common room was empty, as it was just before midnight, but Rudolfa had requested The Marauders meet her downstairs so she could talk to them.</p><p>Rudolfa seemed to be more interested in the falling snow outside, and the dull red shades of the Gryffindor-themes room and tried to not make eye contact with anyone.</p><p>"What if they don't accept me," the brown-haired girl muttered, walking slowly over to the group.</p><p>The redhead smiled, "they will."</p><p>Rudolfa was now stood in front of the three boys, her face was a light shade of pink-red and her arms were glued to the side of her body in nervousness, she felt very embarrassed and she was suddenly regretting her decision to talk to them.</p><p>"What would you like to tell us, Ru?" James asked, crossing his arms over his [flat] chest from where they were previously laid across the back of the sofa. Rudolfa couldn't help the pang of jealously that shot through her when she looked at the boys straight, not curved, bodies and flat, not large, chests.</p><p>She stood silently for a few seconds, "well, I wanted to tell you something important about me," she paused, suddenly feeling very sick. But she continued when Lily urged her on and the three boys stayed silent.</p><p>"My names no longer Rudolfa Jo Lupin, but is Remus John Lupin. I'm a boy, and i have been for the last fourteen years of this godforsaken, torturous life."</p><p>This was the beginning of Remus Lupins life and the end of Rudolfa's.</p>
