    <p>
  <span>The stars are flickers of hope that could be crushed at any moment. That's what he thought as he fell into the abyss, welcoming the arms of darkness. His plan had fallen apart and now no one would know why he truly had done what he had. How trying to help Thor become a better king had backfired and become him trying to prove he was worthy of being loved. No one would hear the pleading words of a broken child. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The stars mock with their brilliance and greatness. That was what Loki thought as he was cut into, beaten, broken, crushed, then shoved back together again and again. Darkness and the stars had thrown him into the most torturous of clutches, though luckily not before he'd forced his magic so deep into himself it would never be reached. He was hurt in every way imaginable till his mind was shattered, body in ruins, and too much of a empty husk, with a flicker of his magic pushing forward going unnoticed. He was pushed off the edge to fall back into darkness and to die, just a useless shell no one had ever wanted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The stars are beautiful. In a flicker of consciousness, emerald eyes, half opened, stared at the most beautiful night sky Loki had ever seen. All the right shades of blue, black, and purple mixed together with sparkling pinpoints of light, shining bright through the hole in a forest canopy. The god closed his eyes, content that if he was to die that that would be the last sight he'd ever see. As unconsciousness lulled him back into blissful darkness, fuzzy voices reached his ears for a moment and the scent of old shoes tickled his nose.</span>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was a miracle all the students were asleep when a man fell from the sky. Dumbledore had been staring out a window, preparing to head to bed, late like always, when a green ball of magic fell from the sky and into the forbidden forest. Dumbledore quickly woke and gathered the heads of houses and the five headed out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hagrid was waiting for them at the edge of the forest with Fang, “Firenze said there is a man in a clearing an’ to take you there. Though there'll be centaurs nearby. ‘Parently they knew this was comin’” Hagrid said, starting to lead the group into the forest. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore nodded, and was not concerned by the fact that the centaurs could've warned them that this was going to happen. The centaurs didn't all trust wizards or humans for that fact. Dumbledore was curious to know if this man wasn't human. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After five minutes of walking they arrived to the small clearing. It seemed to be encased in a bubble of magic. The clearing was surrounded by the tribe of centaurs, all watching the man that was laying on the ground, visibly injured even from where they were. Tendrils of green magic violently lashed out through the air of the clearing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We'll have to get him to Madam Pomfrey’s immediately,” Minerva said, taking a cautious step into the clearing. With Snape slightly ahead of the others, the magic began to calm down as the group of wizards moved towards the man. Snape stopped when he saw that the man had his eyes partially opened, but it seemed the man's consciousness was brief as he was soon very unconscious. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Up close the injuries the man had suffered proved to be extensive, and not injuries from falling, but injuries that indicated torture, “We need to move him now, carefully, while we have the chance,” Snape said, stepping back, “I will gather potions and meet everyone in the hospital wing. He turned to hurry back to the castle when Dumbledore stopped him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you alright Severus?” Dumbledore asked, concerned for his friend. Snape nodded once, “I'm fine,” He answered, pulling away and returning to the castle to gather potions. What he didn't say was that the brightness of the man's eyes had reminded him of Lily for a moment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The other three heads of house carefully immobilized the man and levitated him to the castle and straight to the hospital wing. Madame Pomfrey right away had a bed ready in the back and started assessing all the man's injuries. Every rib broken, internal damages, fractured and broken arms, one broken leg, tons of bruises, cuts, lash marks, and a neck that looked like it had been broken multiple times before being snapped back into place, leaving potentially permanent nerve damage and a peculiar case. The man should be dead, even with his magic holding him together at the moment, there were some injuries that couldn't be explained how he'd survived. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape quickly made his way to the bedside with an armful of potions. With Madame Pomfrey’s help the potions were organized by what was needed first and when doses would be given. Once everything was organized Snape used magic to get the first round of potions into the man's system. And by the look Dumbledore was giving he had a feeling he would be the one administering every dosage of potions for the time being. He supposed he'd just have to deal with it. </span>
</p><hr/>
<p>When Loki finally woke up, he couldn't move and he was uncomfortably warm. He panicked and refused to even try to open his eyes. He was terrified that being pushed back into the abyss, the forest, the night sky, had all been a dream, a hallucination meant to crush him further.</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki was startled when a cold wet cloth was placed on his forehead, “Relax dear,” A woman's voice said, “You have a nasty fever. And I wouldn't try moving, we had to immobilize you due to the extent of your injuries. Even if you are looking a little better than you were a few days ago,” The woman then stepped away, likely to talk to someone. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki slowly opened his eyes slowly, blinking as his eyes adjusted to the light. He was in some kind of hospital wing. It reminded him slightly of the healers wing at the palace. Maybe he was back on Asgard and Eir would come over and have him fixed up by the end of the week so his mother could comfort him and everything would be okay. It was wishful thinking. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape had come to give the man his evening dose of potions. He wasn't particularly concerned when Madame Pomfrey told him the man was awake at the moment. He might've been if they didn't know that the man's magic was healing him along with the potions. He approached the man's bedside and found that the man was staring at him with confused, emerald green eyes. They weren't quite like Lily’s in this light which was a good thing, “I see you're awake,” He commented, setting some potions down.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki watched a man with greasy looking black hair and black hair, carrying a bunch of potion bottles walk over to him. His hopeful wish that he was on Asgard was squished as he knew this man was most certainly not of Asgard and there would've been no reason to get someone not from Asgard to assist in his recovery. He averted his eyes and stared up at the ceiling. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snape frowned slightly then flicked his wand, causing the contents of the bottles to disappear, “I can read minds. If you allow me past your mental guards we could have a real conversation,” Snape took the lack of any kind of response as a no, “The injuries you were found with were extensive. The smallest of which have already healed. Your broken bones will all be healed in a week, two at most. However, your neck will take longer to heal and there may be permanent nerve damage.” He said before leaving with the empty bottles. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki felt sick, and not because he was actually sick. He knew exactly which injuries had been caused and when. It was no wonder these people had immobilized him, at least, if they were trying to help him with good intentions. Loki closed his eyes and unintentionally dozed off. </span>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Apparently, being this injured meant his magic was working overtime to heal him and he was sleeping for long periods of time. Because the next time Loki woke up it was 3, maybe 4 days later. This time he didn't wake up to a woman taking care of him, but to an old man sitting next to his bedside. The man reminded him of Odin for a moment, but he had softer eyes and a longer beard. It wasn't Odin. That was good. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah, you're awake. Good, good. I am Albus Dumbledore. How are you feeling?” Dumbledore asked. After hearing of their guest’s first waking up he’d been coming in from time to time, hoping to catch their guest while he was awake. Dumbledore didn’t seem surprised when he didn’t receive an answer on any kind, “Severus did tell me you have your mind well guarded and don’t seem keen on revealing any of of your thoughts. You need not fear us though. You are our guest and you are free to leave as soon as you are able to. Though, I would for one like to know more about who you are, and perhaps offer you a teaching position here. You have very unique magic.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki glanced at Dumbledore with the most confusion in his eyes that he could muster up. Teaching position? Did that mean he was at some kind of school? If so, a school that taught magic? If he was right and this was a school that taught magic maybe he could finally fit in somewhere. After all, practicing magic, seidr, was frowned upon as a women’s craft on Asgard. He only evaded most of the scorn because he was, had been a prince. He wasn’t anymore. They would never take him make and he was still in denial about his, other, heritage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah, yes. You must not know where you are. Welcome, to Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry,” Dumbledore smiled softly, “Here we teach young witches and wizards how to use their magic, and I do think that having you on our staff would be a wonderful benefit for the students,” He said, “I should let you rest now,” He got up slowly, “Please, think over my offer,” He said before leaving. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Loki stared up at the ceiling for a little while, contemplating what he had been told. He was at a school for magic, and someone in charge wanted him to teach. Teach what, he probably wouldn’t know unless he accepted the offer. But that was something to do at a later date. For now he’d go back to sleeping and let his body heal.</span>
