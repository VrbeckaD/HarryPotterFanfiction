    <p>A Song of Mortos and Peros</p><p>I don’t own Harry Potter. Enjoy. For those who wish to know Mortos means life and Peros means death.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted it all to be over. He wanted to stop fighting, running, and hiding. He wanted the pain to stop, the loss, the fear. He wanted Voldemort dead for killing those he loved, but he’d settle for their fight to be over whether with his death or the Dark Lord’s. He wanted to hurt those who hurt him. He wanted peace. He wanted death. He wanted revenge. As he clutched his father’s cloak in one hand and the snitch that held the stone Dumbledore had so ‘graciously’ gifted him in the other he stood stock still watching the emerald green streak of instant death barrel towards him knowing that even though he would never again draw breath he had won. He had found his peace, his death. He had gotten his revenge.<br/>
He closed his eyes as the light hit him in the chest his last thoughts putting a contented smile on his face. He’d only learned of Hermione and the Weasely’s betrayal at shell cottage after they had escaped Malfoy Manor. They had believed him to still be burying his self-less friend Dobby and he had heard them talking of dividing up his fortune, one that he hadn’t even known of, once he had killed Voldemort and was put in Azkaban. They had discussed it with both Bill and Fleur which told him that all of the Weasely’s were in on it. He couldn’t figure out what to do until they had gotten to the room of requirement looking for the diadem. Hermione and Ron both believed that it had been lost and destroyed in the sea of Fiendfyre that Goyle had so foolishly cast, but when he had swooped down to save Draco he had also reached out and snatched the little crown from its spot on the mannequin’s head and tucked it into the waistband of his pants under his shirt.</p><p>His first thought was to use it as blackmail to get Voldemort to leave him alone but then he learned of the Horcrux in his own body and refused to leave the vile soul piece where it was; that he had to die didn’t matter. In fact it was the perfect revenge. Sure the Weasely’s would have his money but who cared, they wouldn’t be able to kill Voldemort and wouldn’t live long enough to enjoy it, especially if he hid the last horcrux so that no one could find it.</p><p>It was petty, yet it was so perfect, and that’s exactly what he had done. He’d left the castle to go towards Voldemort under the invisibility cloak and had buried the diadem at the roots of a singular rowan tree at the edge of the Forbidden Forest before continuing on to the point he was at now after casting two time delayed messenger patronus’s, one to the survivors of Hogwarts detailing the betrayal of the Weasely’s and the other to Voldemort, with the message in Parseltongue detailing the tree he had buried the diadem so that the other could go and retrieve it. With his death his revenge on the entirety of the Wizarding World was complete.</p><p>The death eaters cheered as his body hit the ground, and once he was confirmed as dead, Hagrid was forced to carry his body to the school. Voldemort announced him as dead just as the first patronus made its way between the Death Eaters and the defenders of Hogwarts. The Weasely’s stood front and center as Harry Potter’s voice flowed from the spectral twelve point stag.</p><p>“When you hear this, I will be dead. This is my revenge. My revenge on the world that should have cherished me, that should have cared for me, that I should have grown up in but was instead kept apart from, belittled in, broken and pushed around. The world I was kept at arm’s length from so that I could be abused and controlled. For those who don’t know the prophecy including the Dark Lord I shall say it now; ‘The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.’ For those of you who haven’t figured it out, I was the child marked; I was the one who could defeat him. I walked to my death and now the Dark Lord can never be defeated. This is my revenge. My revenge against the Wizarding World and my revenge against those who pretended to be my friends and plotted my imprisonment so they could use a fortune I had never even realized I had, this is my revenge, my peace, my choice, my death,” and with those final words the patronus looked up to the sky and faded away.</p><p>The courtyard was silent, but the quiet was suddenly broken by maniacal laughter.<br/>
“I win, because of Harry Potter I win,” laughed Voldemort as he cast a wordless killing curse hitting Minerva McGonagall in the chest, and with that the battle began anew.<br/>
The battle didn’t last long, the fight of the Hogwarts warriors lost in the face of the Savior’s words and the end result was inevitable. Voldemort stood above the masses, malicious ruler that the callousness and stupidity of the Wizarding World had created.</p><p>Voldemort sat in the office of the Hogwarts headmaster alone as he reveled in his victory, marveling in the fact that it was all because of the boy who lived. Suddenly the room became much brighter as a familiar specter trotted in.</p><p>“Lord Voldemort by thissss point I have assssumed your victory. I have sssome information that I believe wissssh for none other to know, hence my ussse of our sssshared tounge. If Nagini hasss perissshed then you have only one lassst horcrux; one I persssonally hid for you. Under a rowan tree only a few feet from the edge of the forbidden forest, I buried the Diadem that the betrayerssss thought dessstroyed in a blazzze of fiendfyre, my only requessst of you isss to tell the betrayersss exactly how they failed assss they die if they are not already dead. Goodbye Lord Voldemort and congratulationsssss.”<br/>
Voldemort’s almost nonexistent eyebrows rose as he quickly stood from seat and hurried his way out of the castle and onto the grounds to where his thought to be greatest enemy had hidden the means of his assured life. Said enemy was not dead however merely standing in limbo berating an old man who was still spouting his ‘greater good’ spiel.</p><p>When Dumbledore demanded Harry go back and complete his destiny Harry told the man exactly what he had done before telling him to kindly ‘fuck off’. He jumped at the chuckles behind him and turned to see a thin man dark haired man dressed in a well-tailored black shirt and suit. His hair was long and pulled back behind his head held there in a black leather tie. The man’s eyes were deep and knowing and Harry felt them appraising him and finding him worthy or at least amusing. When they flicked to Dumbledore however they hardened and then the peculiar man spoke, his voice whispery and condescending and strangely enough Harry likened it to the movement of shadows across stone.</p><p>“Who do you think you are, too manipulate my Master?” the man asked.</p><p>“The boy is not your Master, I am,” Dumbledore said self-importantly, “I was the first to touch all three of the Hallows, not he, you must obey me,” Dumbledore continued. The man chuckled again, not the amused chuckle he had given when Harry had told Dumbledore to fuck off but one that spoke of much darker intentions.</p><p>“You have never been my Master,” the man said. “Did you truly think that I, Death, would allow objects that could control me to fall into just any mortal hands?” the newly titled Death said in his whispery voice.</p><p>“But the Hallows?” Dumbledore tried to say again.</p><p>“Tools for my chosen’s line nothing more,” Death said. “I chose my Master, although the term and role is vastly misunderstood. None can control me for I am Death and I am everywhere, but only one may evade my permanence and that one is not you,” Death said and with a small flick of his finger banished Dumbledore’s soul elsewhere. Harry inched backwards eyes on the man who called himself Death. The man turned towards him.</p><p>“You need not fear me, not you. You are mine to care for, mine to protect, mine to keep forevermore, why would I harm you?” Death said.</p><p>“I don’t understand,” Harry said carefully still holding himself in a tense manner. Death slowly walked towards Harry, his movements graceful and calculated. Harry flinched as one of Death’s hands came up to cup Harry’s face. Death’s skin was cold, papery and dry.</p><p>“I chose you,” Death said.</p><p>“You said that but I don’t understand what that means,” Harry said. Death flicked his other wrist conjuring a black leather chesterfield, before sitting on one end.</p><p>“Please sit, and ask your questions,” Death said with a soft smile that seemed out of place on his lips. Harry edged forward carefully and sat on the other end just barely on the edge of the cushion still wary of the being beside him. He sat tensely and fought to hide the shakes of his exhaustion. Both his body and his mind felt so tired.</p><p>“You said you chose me,” Harry said, and Death nodded. “How? Why?” Harry asked. Death closed his eyes with the soft smile still on his face as though he was reminiscing about something.</p><p>“I am Death, and Death is not something that can be held to obey the laws of time, among other things. I knew of who you were and I chose you from the beginning. As for why I chose you? You are different. You are favored by many beings in this world and even a few worlds beyond aside from me. Magic favors you, as do the three Fates, Nemesis the Greek form of the god of Revenge quite likes you, I imagine even more so now after that inspired piece of pettiness you left for your so called friends. After everything one like you has been through most would seek death, any other would seek to find me. You did so but unlike every other soul that has sought me on purpose your soul has not begun to fade. That is because it was never Death you were seeking, it was freedom,” Death said shifting closer to the middle of the couch.</p><p>Harry tensed but didn’t move from his position as Death reached out for him and pulled Harry further onto the couch and almost into Death’s lap. The skinny build of Death’s visage masked the beings strength as Harry’s weight was easily maneuvered with his one arm.</p><p>“You’re tired,” Death said pulling Harry to lie down over his lap. “We may be inbetween but you are still human, sleep, we can speak more when you wake.” Harry slowly relaxed as long, thin, fingers leisurely ran their way through Harry’s curly strands. In truth it didn’t actually take Harry long to give in and fall asleep.</p><p>When Harry woke up he was in the same position as when he fell asleep, Death’s fingers still running through Harry’s hair. Harry was surprised that the man, being, whatever; Death was, had stayed the entire time he was sleeping just running his hands through Harry’s hair.</p><p>“Do you feel better now?” Death asked as Harry slowly pushed himself up from Death’s lap. Harry rubbed at his eyes trying to chase away the bleariness.</p><p>“I, yes, thank-you,” Harry said a slight blush coloring his cheeks as he realized that he had really just slept on this being’s lap. Death chuckled when he saw the blush and Harry ducked his head.</p><p>“I was going to explain to you exactly what me choosing you means before your little nap,” Death said and Harry’s blush darkened further.</p><p>“Sorry,” Harry said.</p><p>“Oh don’t apologize; I didn’t mind,” Death said lifting his hand to brush his fingers along Harry’s jawbone before putting pressure on the underside of Harry’s jaw to tilt his face up to look into his own. “I chose you, that makes you mine. I have reapers that are mine of course but they are more like employees, ones I didn’t even get to choose. You, you, well,” Death let out a small huff of breath. “You are more like my son, I chose you, and I have made you mine.” Death continued. “And I take care of what is mine, always.”</p><p>“Does that mean I stay in this,” Harry looked around, “inbetween always?” Harry asked.</p><p>“You can if you wish but you don’t have too. There are only two universes I currently work directly on although I have access to many. You can’t actually die, but they are the only a few in which I could pull favors on to get you a physical body on, at least currently. On any others you could visit but you would be invisible and incorporeal; unfortunately your world is not one I am allowed to interfere with directly. My choosing of you was the only exception, I can collect souls from that world but I am not allowed to directly interfere with that world anymore. In fact had you died only a few months ago I would only have one world in which I could personally interfere with. A pissed off angel with a few daddy issues escaped his little cage and now I get to wander an earth with the other three horsemen humans seem to view as my equals. Although said pissed off little angel has a few chains on me currently, mere annoyances but something I am dealing with, as such I will have to spend much time in that world,” Death answered.</p><p>“Will I get to see my parents if I can’t die?” Harry asked. Death’s face actually softened a little.</p><p>“Your world doesn’t have a heaven or hell, when a person dies their soul is automatically wiped and placed back into the reincarnation cycle. Your mother, father, godfather and even the recently deceased Remus Lupin have already re-entered the cycle and been wiped clean. Despite my general dislike for most human beings in general I do apologize for the hurt this must cause,” Death said his voice soft as he caressed Harry’s cheekbone.</p><p>“I just wanted to be able to talk to them at least once. I just wanted to know my parents, who my mother and father really were, not just what they looked like or what other people thought they were, you know?” Harry said.</p><p>“I didn’t know them, as despite being close to you, my reapers still were the ones to handle their souls, but I can say that they must have been quite impressive to produce you Harry,” Death said.</p><p>“Thanks,” Harry said as his stomach growled. Death softly smiled.</p><p>“I suppose I best feed you, humans have so many needs, you will find that the longer you are mine the less your old human needs will bother you. Your soul will be changing; you’ll be something between one of my reapers and what you would know as an angel, and a bit of me,” Death said.</p><p>“I am feeling hungry. I haven’t eaten a proper meal since before we broke into Gringotts, and well,” Harry paused, “Well I don’t really know how long ago that was,” Harry finished.</p><p>“How do you feel about pizza?” Death asked.</p><p>“I’ve never actually had any,” Harry answered.</p><p>“Well that is something we are going to rectify,” Death answered. “I am needed in Chicago and well Chicago has absolutely fantastic pizza. There is a Winchester that I have to meet there,” Death said. “But first we have to get you into some better clothing.”</p><p>“Okay, um, well I don’t um, have any good clothes,” Harry said. “Especially not here.” Death chuckled.</p><p>“I take care of you remember? I’ve been anticipating you’re arrival for quite some time and bought you wardrobe that I believe would be fitting your style while still being acceptably formal for the necessary situations,” Death answered.</p><p>“You bought me clothing?” Harry said.</p><p>“Of course I did, allow me to take you to my home, our home. Well one of our homes,” Death said. “The world I have recently been allowed to walk on is going through the apocalypse. The house that you will most likely be regularly staying in is on that world since I have much work to do there. Of course however you will be allowed to do as you wish but I shall explain exactly how that world works before I allow you to go off on your own. You may not be able to die but there are many things that can hurt you there; despite your magic, especially because of your magic,” Death said rising from the couch and extending a hand to Harry. Harry took it and stood and Death pulled him close underneath his arm.</p><p>“Thankfully my way of travel is less uncomfortable than your magical apparition. That is another thing I’ll have to teach you,” Death said as they faded away from the inbetween and faded back into existence in a more than opulent bedroom.</p><p>“Oh wow this is your room?” Harry asked looking around. It was absolutely enormous. The room was done in black, various shades of grey, silver and royal purple. The space itself was as large as the Gryffindor common room but honestly held more to Harry’s tastes than the obnoxious red and gold that was the common room. Three of the four walls were painted a soothing purple with dark grey baseboards as accents. The fourth wall was completely glass. It was a window that overlooked the front lawn of what was obviously a large manor of some sort. Huge fir trees lined and framed the yard so the house couldn’t be seen from the road until one entered the lengthy drive. Harry continued taking in the room marveling at the luxurious design.</p><p>Along one wall were two tall ebony bookshelves lined with multiple books with judging by the titles were mostly about mythological and magical creatures, although there were some that were in languages he didn’t recognize, but seemed strangely familiar and only took a second before he could read the titles, beside that was a matching desk with a comfy looking, black leather, computer chair. Along the center of one of the wall was a four poster bed on a raised platform covered in plush purple and grey patterned carpeting while the rest of the floor was a light grey hardwood.</p><p>The four poster bed had a grey and purple gauzy fabric covering the roof and curtains, while the bedspread was black and royal purple with silky silver pillowcases and sheets. Matching silver and purple accent pillows sat on the black leather chesterfield and loveseat, as well as in the small seating nook between the two bookcases. Where the couches were was a beautiful entertainment system, with a large flat screen tv. The draperies were all royal purple, and Harry wanted to go over to touch them they looked so plush. There were two dark grey doors that were standing open and Harry could see the tiles of a bathroom in one and assumed that the other was a closet of some sort.</p><p>“No Harry, this is your bedroom. I do not require sleep and as such do not require a bedroom,” Death said patting Harry’s back. Harry looked over at the taller being in awe. “Eventually you won’t need them either but human habits, I’ve been told are often comforting and hard to break.”</p><p>“This,” Harry breathed out a small breath, “This is mine?” Harry asked looking around the room once more.</p><p>“Go ahead, you can take a closer look,” Death said giving Harry a small push towards the bed. Harry went with the momentum brushing the curtains away and touching the soft comforter, before sitting on the bed and sinking into the soft mattress.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Harry said “This is amazing,” Harry said slowly getting off the bed to move closer to the window and take in the view. The yard was flat and green with a small pond and a few brown ducks swam in the azure water.</p><p>“You have ducks?” Harry asked with a little bit of incredulousness.</p><p>“I like ducks,” Death defended. “I like them more than most humans at least.” Harry rolled his eyes before turning to walk across to the far side of the room where the two open doors were. The first one he went to was the bathroom. He flicked on the light and his eyebrows rose. The room was as large as Dudley’s second bedroom itself had been. For a bedroom that was small, for a bathroom it was quite large. There was an enormous bath that could have doubled as a medium sized hot tub as well as a large shower and a beautiful black marble counter and vanity area. The rugs were royal purple as were the towels that were monogramed in silver with his name.</p><p>“Bloody hell,” Harry whispered. “How are you so loaded?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Both angels and demons pay me to ferry souls to where they are supposed to go and my reapers well they don’t use physical money so I don’t exactly have to pay them, plus there are worlds were I am worshiped as a godly aspect and given offerings,” Death shrugged.</p><p>“I wouldn’t expect you to deal with actual money either,” Harry said.</p><p>“I don’t always. Sometimes I’m payed in favors or items that hold my interest, but I have accumulated many different forms of payment over the centuries. The Greeks often gave a gold coin to my reapers to ferry them to the soul stream, and the Egyptians of this world had themselves buried with their treasures hoping to bring them with them in their mortal deaths. I have many art pieces you can look through later and pick out what you wish in order to decorate your room, or if you’d like we could change the colors and redecorate entirely if you wish,” Death answered.</p><p>“No, no it’s perfect, this is all so much more than anything I’d ever thought I’d have,” Harry said.</p><p>“It’s much less than what you deserve, and if I thought you’d accept it I’d give you much more than this,” Death said. “Come, the closet is a walk-in. You need to pick out some clothes and take a shower. After I will tell you a bit about this world and then we will get some food,” Death continued moving out of the bathroom, Harry followed.</p><p>Harry was correct that the other room was a closet. Death flicked the light switch on as Harry entered behind him. When Harry saw the room he actually gasped. The walk in closet was almost half the size of his actual bedroom. There were shelves and cubbies on one side and rails and hangers on the other. Every cubby was filled with neatly folded pairs of pants, both dress slacks and various pairs of jeans and joggers. The shelves had various forms of footwear; dress shoes, boots, sneakers and other shoes. Hanging up were dress shirts, long sleeves, hoodies, sweaters and even t-shirts. Various accessories had their places around the closet. Scarves and belts hung on various hooks, watches, masculine necklaces, rings and cufflinks sat in their velvet lined boxes and several different glasses frames were set along one of the shelves with what looked like plain lenses inside them.</p><p>Harry frowned for a second and touched his face realizing he wasn’t wearing his glasses but he could see perfectly. He turned to look at Death.</p><p>“I can see,” Harry said.</p><p>“Yes, I took the liberty of fixing your superficial imperfections while you were sleeping, if you look at the back of your hand you’ll see I’ve removed all of your scars, including the famous one that once sat on your forehead,” Death answered. Harry raised his hand and looked at the back of it realizing Death was speaking the truth as the skin was smooth and scar less. “I have also taken the opportunity to reorganize your head, you may find learning things comes easier now, and that you know things you’ve never learned. Languages will be the most obvious, but this world is also filled with creatures and myths you have never heard of and I updated that information in your mind. I have also placed my own shields in your head so that your mind can not be broken into or tampered with. From what I recall you had little talent for mind arts, though perhaps we can change that. This way for now however no angel can tamper with your head nor can any demon possess you.”</p><p>“Thank-you,” Harry said nervous about why angels and demons might find reasons to possess or tamper but happy to know that he at least would have the knowledge necessary for this world and that he would be able to fit in and understand the people of any area of the world. It was something that would have been nice during his fourth year if he had had knowledge required to speak French or Russian or Bulgarian.</p><p>“I have told you, I take care of my own. You are mine and what you wanted was freedom, I’m giving you a new start, if you wanted you could even change your name,” Death said. Harry looked at Death for a moment.</p><p>“Hadrian,” Harry said in answer.</p><p>“Hadrian Potter it is then,” Death said.</p><p>“No, just Hadrian,” Hadrian said.</p><p>“Just Hadrian then, more dignified than Harry Potter,” Death said. Hadrian smiled and Death continued, “Well go ahead and pick out some clothing and take a shower. I’ll wait.” Hadrian gave a nod and began picking out an outfit while Death exited the closet to sit on one of the leather couches in the room.</p><p>He picked out a pair of black skinny jeans and a silver chain belt. A long sleeve basic grey shirt was paired with a darker grey cardigan. He paused for a minute looking over the other accessories before grabbing a black and green scarf, silver watch, and a pair of black, silver, and green high top sneakers. Carrying the clothing in a small pile in his arms he walked out of the closet and back into the bathroom. It had felt good to be able to pick out and decide to wear nice looking clothing for once.</p><p>Hadrian’s shower was exquisite, the water pressure was wondrous and the soothing scents of the various products Death had provided. Sandalwood and green apple paired well together, or at least Harry, no Hadrian thought so, and the towel he used to dry his hair and body was soft. The clothes he had picked out for himself fit him perfectly. It was strange wearing something that actually fit him and looked good. He walked out of the bathroom fully dressed and Death uncrossed his legs and stood from where he had been sitting on the couch.</p><p>“You clean up quite well,” Death said. Hadrian gave looked down at himself before looking back up at Death.</p><p>“Thank-you, I’ve never really had the opportunity to clean up before, all I had was my cousin’s hand me downs and they were usually pretty worn out by the time I got them,” Hadrian said adjusting the watch on his wrist, nervously.</p><p>“You will never go without with me. In fact you may find that there is nothing that you will want for I shall endeavor to give you everything,” Death said putting a hand on Hadrian’s shoulder as he moved up to him. “Now come, Carlos, my, sorry our, driver is waiting. I shall explain a little more about this world on the way. Also this is now yours,” Death said leading Hadrian out of the room passing the boy a black credit card.</p><p>Less than half an hour later their vehicle was being maneuvered by Carlos through Chicago rush hour traffic. Hadrian’s eyes were wide as his mind processed everything he had just been told.</p><p>“So in summary, this world has magic but not the way my world did. Angry ghosts and vengeful spirits, mythical creatures that didn’t even exist in the wizarding world, and even angels and demons are actually real,” Hadrian said.</p><p>“Yes, human’s known as hunters keep them in line,” Death said.</p><p>“And because I have magic, I need to be careful because I am the only naturally wizard in this world and Hunters will mistake me for a crazy demon dealing witch?” Hadrian asked almost rhetorically for clarification despite having already heard the answer more than once.</p><p>“Yes, that is true,” Death said.</p><p>“I don’t have a wand though I won’t be able to do that much magic anyway,” Hadrian said voice betraying his relief.</p><p>“Not exactly, see the Hallows were tools that always meant to be yours. When you died I infused them with your soul. You will be able to see any creature that would normally be invisible because of their existence on a different plane that the one we are moving on. That includes, reapers, hellhounds, the faces and wings of demons and angels, and even some spirits among other things curtesy of the resurrection stone. In other worlds that might include the true forms of gods, magic or possessing the sight. The cloak allows you to remain hidden should you wish from every creature and being, that includes me, although I have remedied that by marking you so that I can find you if you are ever in danger. The cloak shields you from being tracked by any creature and being but most especially from the angels and demons on this world who would be the most likely to try and use you. And last but not least the wand allows you to do magic at your will, wandlessly. You need neither spells nor a physical wand to do as you wish with your magical power, merely your will and your not insignificant imagination,” Death said.</p><p>“But if I do run afoul Hunters they can’t actually kill me?” Hadrian clarified.</p><p>“No but it will still hurt if they shoot or stab you,” Death said.</p><p>“While I have vast experiences with pain I will most definitely keep that in mind,” Hadrian said. “Now can you explain what you meant by apocalypse and Winchester? You never really said what you meant,” Hadrian asked. Death had just finished explaining when the car pulled up to the curb only a few storefronts away from a restaurant that advertised most especially their pizza.</p><p>“Let me get this straight, first you tell me to stay away from Hunters and now we are going to have pizza with one?” Hadrian asked.</p><p>“It is an unfortunate necessity, besides I told you to be wary of what Hunter’s might do to you, not to stay away from them. I could care less about what you do with them,” Death said.</p><p>“So if per say I wanted to help them you wouldn’t stop me?” Hadrian asked.</p><p>“No of course not, is that what you wish to do?” Death asked.</p><p>“Maybe to help stop the apocalypse, I haven’t been on this world very long but I kinda like my room and there are a lot of people whom I’m sure don’t deserve to die here. I’m not sure I want to work with the hunters though maybe I’ll hunt creatures and demons on my own,” Hadrian said.</p><p>“I forget how young you are,” Death said with a chuckle as their driver opened the door for them. “But you may do as you wish; either way souls will be brought to my realm to be sorted. Although I am planning on giving my ring to the eldest Winchester, I dislike even the barest minimum of control that whiney angel has over me,” Death continued as he followed Hadrian out of the car and onto the sidewalk.</p><p>Hadrian walked beside Death as they made their way down the street towards the pizza place. A man knocked into Hadrian and muttered at him to watch where he was going. Hadrian continued walking beside Death rubbing his shoulder, not even aware at the blip of anger the being beside him had felt or the man who had bumped him, who was now having a heart attack behind them. Hadrian entered the pizzeria behind Death and sat in the indicated chair beside the being.</p><p>“I’ll order for us both since you have never had pizza before,” Death said quickly perusing the menu before setting it down and waving down the waitress.</p><p>“Hello, what can I get for ya?” the perky blonde asked.</p><p>“A large pepperoni pie if you will, and a coke for me,” Death said before turning to Hadrian so he could order his drink.<br/>
“And a chocolate milk please,” Hadrian added quietly.</p><p>“Sure thing, bud, and I must say you are just the cutest,” the blonde waitress said. Beside Death Hadrian bristled and the waitress walked away to give the kitchen their order and fetch their drinks.</p><p>“Cutest?” Hadrian asked. “She made it sound as if I were a little kid. It’s not my fault I’m short,” Hadrian said before turning to Death. “You couldn’t have fixed that when you did my eyesight and all that other stuff?” Hadrian asked.</p><p>“I could have, I preferred not to. I quite like you this size, if I so wished when I give you a hug you would fit perfectly under my chin,” Death said as though it was obvious.</p><p>“Give me a hug?” Hadrian asked confused.</p><p>“What you believe I am unable to give out affection because I am Death?” Death asked.</p><p>“No I suppose not it is just unexpected. I mean I know you have given me so much but I didn’t think you’d do things like hug me. I thought that sleeping on your lap on the couch was a one off, never to happen again, kind of thing,” Hadrian answered. Death reached over to Hadrian’s chair beside him and pulled him into a hug.</p><p>“Satisfied?” Death asked Hadrian as the waitress returned with their drinks. Hadrian gave a nod and sipped the chocolate milk through the straw.</p><p>“It’s such a pleasant sight to see a boy show such obvious love to his father. Such a thing is becoming rarer and rarer these days,” the waitress said before walking to another table where the customers had flagged her down. Hadrian blushed and looked over at Death but couldn’t meet his eyes focusing instead on Death’s black clad shoulder.</p><p>“Seriously how young do I look?” Harry whispered.</p><p>“About fifteen little one, perhaps considering how well you pull off those clothes sixteen,” Death answered. Death patted at his head gently and they sat in comfortable silence as they waited for their pizza to arrive.</p><p>Hadrian had just taken the first bite of the pizza that had been set in front of them only moments ago when Death spoke.</p><p>“Thanks for returning that. Join me, Dean. The pizza's delicious. Sit down. Took you long enough to find us. I've been wanting to talk to you,” Death said. Hadrian glanced up at Death’s words that had obviously been directed at the man named Dean in front of them rather than him. The man in front of the table was tall, at least six feet making him about half a foot taller than Hadrian as well as somewhere in his early to mid-twenties. He had cropped short, dark blond hair and green eyes. Not green enough to truly rival Hadrian’s but greener than Hadrian had seen any other person have. He had a very light dusting of freckles across his cheeks and pouty light pink lips. He wore a pair of older looking jeans and a plaid shirt underneath a jacket and overtop of an old ACDC band shirt.</p><p>While Hadrian was looking over Dean, Dean was looking over him. Death was most obviously the taller thin man who had spoken to him but Dean had no idea who the kid with the powerful being was. Vivid emerald eyes even brighter and clearer than his own looked over him curiously. The kid was dressed in obviously expensive and well-made clothing that complimented his pale coloring. The boy had black hair just like Death, but was much shorter in stature although they shared the same lithe build. In fact beside both him and Death the boy looked positively tiny. His hair was in messy curls that honestly made him look as if he had just gotten out of bed after vigorous and pleasurable activities.  Dean swallowed and tried to clear those thoughts from his mind. Not only was the kid most likely underage or barely legal at the most, he was also sitting next to Death as though it was a normal thing for him to be doing and Dean did not want to be caught thinking those thoughts in case one or both decided to take offense to them.</p><p>“I got to say,” Dean finally answered slowly lowering himself into the chair Death had indicated for him to sit. “I have mixed feelings about that. S-so is this the part where...where you kill me?” Dean asked nervously pulling his eyes away from the boy and back to Death.</p><p>“You have an inflated sense of your importance. To a thing like me, things like you, well...” Death gave Dean a sort of cold but not mean smile. “Think how you'd feel if a bacterium sat at your table and started to get snarky. This is one little planet in one tiny solar system in a galaxy that's barely out of its diapers. I'm old, Dean, very old. So I invite you to contemplate how insignificant I find you,” Death continued before gesturing to the pizza that he and Hadrian had ordered on the table. “Eat,” Death looked over at Hadrian, “You too, you’re too skinny not to.” Hadrian snorted taking another bite as Dean cautiously took his own piece and bit into it.</p><p>“Mnot, that skinny,” Hadrian protested when he swallowed before taking a third bite. Death ignored him and Hadrian decided that he quite liked pizza.</p><p>“Good, isn't it?” Death asked both of them. Hadrian had his mouth filled, but nodded his agreeance as did Dean. Dean swallowed and Hadrian couldn’t help but follow the line of his throat as his brain thought not so clean things. Hadrian closed his eyes and quickly pictured Snape in his nightgown and his little problem went away. Death’s arm moved up to rest on the back of Hadrian’s seat and Hadrian glanced over at the being, who sent a knowing look his way. Hadrian ducked his head as he blushed.</p><p>“Well I gotta ask. How old are you?” Dean asked and Hadrian was happy that Death’s attention was once more on the other man. The one Hadrian told him was a famous Hunter, at least in certain circles.</p><p>“As old as God. Maybe older. Neither of us can remember anymore. Life, death, chicken, egg. Regardless,” Death paused as he dabbed at his mouth with a napkin. “In the end, I'll reap him, too. There is only one I will never reap,” Death said sending a soft look at Hadrian before turning his attention back to Dean. The Hunter caught the look but other than sending a suspicious look of his own at Hadrian, Dean said nothing, yet, focusing more on the first part of Death’s statement.</p><p>“God? You’ll reap God?” Dean asked incredulously.</p><p>“Oh, yes. God will die, too, Dean,” Death said.</p><p>“Well, this is above my pay grade,” Dean said sarcastically under his breath, although both Hadrian and Death heard him. Hadrian snorted and Dean sent him a small smirk that quickly disappeared under Death’s gaze.</p><p>“I suppose just a bit,” Death said and Hadrian fought off another small snort at the understatement.</p><p>“So, then why am I still breathing, sitting here with you? Uh...w-what do you want?” Dean asked steady voice wavering just slightly with the last question.</p><p>“The leash around my neck --off. Lucifer has me bound to him. Some unseemly little spell. He has me where he wants, when he wants at least in this universe. That's why I couldn't go to you. I had to wait for you to catch up. He made me his weapon. Hurricanes, floods, raising the dead. I'm more powerful than you can process, and I'm enslaved to a bratty child with a temper tantrum,” Death said and Hadrian raised an eyebrow. Death had said several times that the only reason he was able to physically walk the earth in this universe was because of whiney angel but Hadrian hadn’t thought he meant the devil himself.</p><p>“And you think...I can unbind you?” Dean asked disbelieving.</p><p>“There's your ridiculous bravado again. Of course you can't. But you can help me take the bullets out of Lucifer's gun. I understand you want this,” Death said slipping his ring off his finger and holding it up for Dean to see.</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said seeing no point in denial.</p><p>“I’m inclined to give it to you,” Death said.</p><p>“To give it to me?” Dean asked voice once more disbelieving.</p><p>“That’s what I said,” Death said.</p><p>“But what about,” Dean broke off making a gesture to everything around them.</p><p>“Chicago? It can stay I suppose, I do like the pizza. There are conditions,” Death said.</p><p>“Okay, like?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You have to do whatever it takes to put Lucifer in his cell,” Death said.</p><p>“Of course,” Dean answered, and Hadrian believed that he would be doing that whether or not he was given Death’s ring.</p><p>“Whatever it takes,” Death reiterated.</p><p>“That’s the plan,” Dean said and Hadrian could hear the hint of sarcastic duh, in his tone.</p><p>“No. No plan. Not yet. Your brother. He's the one that can stop Lucifer. The only one,”  Death said.</p><p>“What, you think,” Dean began saying before Death cut him off.</p><p>“I know. So, I need a promise. You're going to let your brother jump right into that fiery pit. Well, do I have your word?” Death asked and Hadrian’s eyes went wide. Death wanted this man to let his brother go to hell?</p><p>“Okay, yeah. Yes,” Dean said although his voice didn’t hold the same deep strength it had held before.</p><p>“That had better be "yes," Dean. You know you can't cheat Death. Now, would you like the instruction manual?” Death asked. Hadrian stayed silent. Mayhap usually he would try and help, try and save people. According to his traitorous friends he had a bit of a ‘saving people thing’ but it wasn’t really, it was more of a; I don’t want my loved ones to die or I don’t want myself to die. He could actually be quite petty and unmovable when he wished to be, as seen by the defenders of Hogwarts and Voldemort himself.</p><p>“Time to go Hadrian,” Death said and Hadrian nodded and set down his slice. “No, no, bring it with us, I’ll not be letting you starve son,” Death said his hand coming up to cup the nape of Hadrian’s neck. Harry picked his plate up paused for a second and grabbed two more pieces of pizza and placed them onto his plate before nodding to Death that he was ready.</p><p>Death’s shadow flashing as he called it was much smoother and less stomach wrenching than apperating, and Hadrian landed on his feet pizza in hand in the middle of a room he had never seen. It was a kitchen slash dining room area and he quickly set his plate on the bar top counter before settling himself on a stool to continue eating his pizza.</p><p>“So,” Hadrian said swallowing, “That was a Winchester.”</p><p>“Yes, annoying little blighter, but an adequate hunter,” Death said opening up the fridge and pouring himself and Hadrian a glass of water that had frozen raspberries, and mint leaves in it. Harry smiled and sipped at the chilled water as he continued eating his pizza.</p><p>“Little one, I know I wished to give you the life you deserve but I am having a bit of a conundrum. I could send a high ranking reaper to do the job, or I could send you and have you do the job and live your own life a little. But at the moment I cannot leave this world until Lucifer is contained once more. Not because I am bound here but because I must do my best to mitigate the events that are coming here.” Death said.</p><p>“What is the job?” Hadrian asked setting the crust from his last pizza slice down on his plate and taking a large drink to rinse the last of the sauce from his mouth. Death handed Hadrian a napkin to wipe his face as he answered Hadrian’s question.</p><p>“It’s not truly a job. You will always be my chosen and no other will ever supplant you but there are still some in various worlds I favor and give gifts too. I would like for either you or one of my reapers to watch one of my favored. Given that it’s a world I have almost completely unrestricted access too I would usually do it myself but in the circumstances,” Death shrugged, a seemingly strange movement for the formal looking man.</p><p>“So I’d just be watching?” Hadrian asked.</p><p>“Yes. See I love good stories and watching them unfold. I am as you know unable to make my own creations and watch them grow, therefore I pick my favorite souls in the vast multitudes of universes and give them my favor, before I watch their stories unfold. If I can’t watch it, you could and later you could show me the memories so I could see it for myself,” Death said. “Also in this world you would also have a physical body if I pull a few strings, and cash a few favors. You could interfere or not interfere however you want. Unlike other god’s and those in their direct, well I suppose you could call it employ you would have complete free will. You could play however you wished without the same consequences, they would face, you would be how we shall say, unrestricted? Plus it will get you out of the war that is coming to this world and I know you have no wish to become yet another soldier,” Death said. “If I sent a reaper they would have the same restrictions on them as any other god’s employee would have, you are the exception, the only exception. My little one, my chosen,” Death said as he moved back around the counter to pull Hadrian into a hug burying his face into Hadrian’s green apple scented curls.</p><p>Hadrian shuddered and leaned into the hug wrapping his arms around the entity known as Death.</p><p>“I can come back though right? I don’t have to do this forever, I can visit you?” Hadrian asked his psyche finally starting to crack under all the stress he had experienced in twenty-four hours letting the small child he truly was peek through.</p><p>“Of course little one, of course,” Death said pulling Hadrian even closer and lifting him of the stool. Hadrian had always been small, a product of his upbringing and his parent’s genes. His father according to Remus had been little more than five eight and his mother had been a rather short five four. Hadrian had managed to get to a height of five five, still short but respectable considering his childhood.</p><p>Hadrian fingers clenched into the back suit jacket Death wore as the being so easily picked him up. Hadrian wrapped his legs around Death’s waist and buried his head in Death’s chest as the being carried him with hidden strength, through the house and up the stairs to the room that Death had set up as Hadrian’s. Death set Harry down on the soft comforter and helped Harry strip from his shoes jeans, cardigan and accessories so that he lay clothed only in his underwear and shirt as Death pulled the comforter out from under him and tucked him in.</p><p>“Sleep well my little one,”’ Death said. “And do not fret it is not something you have to decide now, Hadrian.” Death ran his fingers through Hadrian’s curls and kissed his forehead.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Hadrian to fall asleep. Nightmares didn’t touch him as he slumbered on one of Death’s reapers in the guise of an older matronly woman staying to watch over. When he woke in the morn, it was too the sun rays cascading into the room to the floor to ceiling windows. He was wrapped up in the soft comforter, warm and comfortable and not at all wanting to be awake quite yet. Unfortunately he had both had a nap the day before on a certain entities lap and had seventeen years’ experience of waking up no later than eight and was not going to be falling back asleep anytime soon.</p><p>Finally he unwrapped himself from the blanket and actually rose from the bed. Hadrian turned on the shower on the coldest setting as he stripped away the last of his clothes that he had slept in away before hopping under the stream of water. With a loud squeak he quickly turned the nob to warm, now completely wide awake.</p><p>He scrubbed the gummies from his eyes and washed his face and body quickly before stepping out onto the plush mat set outside the shower and dried him off with the purple and silver monogramed towels. He hung the towel up and walked out of the bathroom into his room buck naked and made his way to his closet. That was a joy to think of  it as ‘his closet, his clothes, his new and never worn before clothes’.</p><p>He dressed quickly in a pair of loose grey sweats and a dark blue t-shirt. He left his feet bare as he padded back out into his room. Death was already waiting for him.</p><p>“Hadrian,” the entity said softly with fondness, “I trust you slept well?”</p><p>“I did thanks,” Hadrian said, his face red as he looked down towards his feet, embarrassed at his actions the day before.</p><p>“Oh my sweet little one,” Death said softly moving forward and bringing Harry into another hug. Harry had received more physical affection in the last two days than he had ever received in his life. “I do not care how you act, whether it is like a small child or like the eldest man, I will always care for you.”<br/>
“Thank-you,” Hadrian said leaning into the hug, arms wrapped around the entity. Death kissed Hadrian’s curly haired head.</p><p>“I have a proposition for you,” Death said. “In the inbetween time passes differently I’d like to have my reapers teach you how to defend yourself, with more than magic. You could spend years in the inbetween and only days would pass here in this world. It would be different in other worlds. For example your original world matched second to second. You and I both know I will never claim your soul, at least in the traditional sense, where you would remain permanently dead, but you can be hurt; I’d like to ensure that you feel as little pain as possible. I wish I could give you complete peace, but none can give you that, not with free will also. It would also serve to prepare you if you chose to go to the other world,”</p><p>“I’d like that,” Hadrian said pulling out of the hug.</p><p>“Very well I’ll arrange it. Shall we find you something to eat?” Death asked his hand on Hadrian’s lower back leading him out of the room and into the hall. They traversed the manor down to the kitchen and dining area. “Sit,” Death ordered directing Hadrian to sit upon one of the bar stools. The entity moved around the kitchen fluidly, pulling eggs and various vegetables out onto the counter. It didn’t take long for the being to have the vegetables chopped and diced and mixed into a bowl with the cracked eggs as he made Hadrian an omelet.</p><p>“I didn’t realize you knew how to cook, or even that you did cook,” Hadrian said.</p><p>“Everyone should know how to cook, and how to cook well. Those who don’t miss out on one of the many pleasures of the universes; good food,” Death answered as he poured the mix into the hot skillet he had already prepared with butter and shallots. It didn’t take long for the quick breakfast meal to be finished and plated up. Death slid over the plate across the bar counter to Hadrian with a soft smile playing on his lips. “Eat,” Death ordered kindly. Hadrian ate.</p><p>“This is delicious,” Hadrian said happily before filling his mouth with another bite. Hadrian’s plate was soon clean and Death took it from Harry and placed it in the sink.</p><p>“I am glad you enjoyed it,” Death said leading Hadrian once more by a hand on the small of the boy’s back. “Come, we shall go inbetween, and you shall begin your learning.” With little more than a slight darkening of the shadows they were gone.</p><p>Hadrian and Death didn’t return for three years, or at least what seemed to them, in fact it was three days in the world that held the Winchesters and Lucifer. Hadrian had grown close to Death, their relationship likening to one of father and son. Hadrian was still Death’s little one and had grown used to the way Death cared for him. His aversion to touch had long abated with the way constantly hugged or touched his back, and kissed his head. Their relationship wasn’t the only thing to change.</p><p>Harry had learned from reapers how to wield various weapons. It didn’t happen often that they were needed in such a capacity but reapers were soldiers just as much as angels. The reapers however were well versed in every form of death, and taught Harry far more than just how to be a soldier. He knew how to be a soldier. He had been a soldier. No they taught him far more. He could wield a short sword, with a shield though he preferred to use a long dagger in his off hand when he wielded his sword, or to wield a small sword alone. He could also wield a bow; it was actually his most favored weapon directly after his throwing knives. They taught him how to use stealth and words in equal amounts to avoid a fight. They taught him most often by showing him memories of the souls they’d collected from and having him practice. Not only that but the souls collected were from some of the men and women who knew how to play politics and word games with the best of them. The reapers had caught him up in what in his world was considered mundane education. Unfortunately that included Sex Ed.</p><p>Receiving Sex Ed from a reaper was the strangest thing. Due to Death integrating the hallows into his soul Hadrian could see the true form of the beings beneath whatever visage the reapers chose to wear for the lessons. Seeing a hooded skeletal being beneath the visage of a beautiful young lady did not make Sex Ed easy.  Thankfully that was only a few hours of his education before they were back on to other topics.</p><p>Death had had his reapers reteach Hadrian potions, and while Hadrian could never be called good, at potions, if he had specific instructions he could be more than acceptable. Because of the way his magic now acted, needing only his will and imagination rather than spells there wasn’t a lot of magic the reapers or Death could teach him; however they were able to teach him the basics in ancient runes, and several languages. They’d also helped him in the meditation portion of unlocking his inner animal; the actual change itself seemed to come easy, it was more a matter of finding the animal itself. Hadrian was a crow, a rather large one at that. In fact Death had first thought him a raven due to his size despite his connection with, well, Death. When Hadrian returned to his more humanoid form and they had gone through exactly what his animal form meant.</p><p>Obviously part of it came from his connection to Death, and the visible mark now on his soul. According to one of the Reapers one who preferred the guise of a young woman named Tessa, Crows were a symbol of luck, both good and bad, something he could certainly connect to his life. The Crow was also a symbol of a new phase of one’s life, considering where he was now it was only natural. Not to mention his flying abilities in human form easily transferred over into his crow form.</p><p>The reapers also taught him how to properly occlude, and in turn use legimency. This lead to teaching him the way most reapers communicated with one another and with Death himself; telepathy. Unlike potions Hadrian easily mastered the mind arts. It helped that the ones teaching him actually cared for him, and wished him to learn. As well the horcrux was no longer in him to sabotage from inside his own psyche.</p><p>There was an unfortunate or fortunate, depending on how one looked at it, side effect of him learning occumancy. Being able to bring forth the parts of him he had repressed, that Dumbledore had trained him to repress, had changed him somewhat from the complete Gryffindor soldier he’d been molded into. It was something would have happened eventually, although perhaps over a larger period of time but he had regressed somewhat in mentality. It was not as though he was physically a four year old child but there were times were he was mentally, well that was not to say mentally as in intelligence but more his behavior at times, although it was only periodic and rarely lasted long. Death thought it was also in part product to the fact that his childhood had been greatly destroyed by the abuses he had suffered. It was almost like as if he had a split personality but not quite that bad.</p><p>Death had decided after debating with Hadrian regressed, to revert Hadrian to the physical body of a nine-year old. Not quite as young as he was mentally at times but still closer than his seventeen year old body had been. They had decided it would be a cathartic way for Hadrian to redo his childhood. It had required him relearn how to use his now proportionally different body. However with the weapons practice and exercises that Death and his reapers ran him though he quickly became used to his new physical capabilities. Death had also indicated to Hadrian that he had altered the wardrobe he had purchased for Harry to fit his new body.</p><p>It would seem Death enjoyed Hadrian’s short stature and took pleasure in cuddling him in his smaller form. Although stiff and awkward in the beginning it didn’t take long for Hadrian to enjoy crawling into the entities lap and cuddling into the being in human male form and falling asleep. Death it would seem, very much enjoyed it when Hadrian did it as well. Hadrian, in the recesses of his own mind at least, believed that the reason Death so cared for him was because Death had never had anything to liken as his own child before. Reapers were his, but they were employees, he hadn’t made them, God had, and gifted them to Death. He hadn’t made Harry either but he had chosen him and that made all the difference.</p><p>Harry had agreed to travel to the universe Death had asked him about before they had gone into the inbetween. Death had given Harry the basics of the Tortallian Universe and an explanation into his favored soul there, Rebakah Cooper. Vocabulary of said universe was going to be a bit tricky but their common language at the least was his mother tongue; English, not to mention magic was a well-known entity in the Tortallian Universe.</p><p>“Pack what you’ll need little one,” Death said as they appeared back in Hadrian’s room. “I took the liberty of having my reapers supply you with pieces of clothing better suited to where you are going, as well if you don’t mind I would feel better if I aged you up to at least fifteen considering where you are going.”</p><p>“I think that would be wise, father,” Hadrian said. It only took a few seconds for Harry and his clothing to slowly grow. Hadrian’s physical appearance had both changed and remained the same in many contradictory ways. One who didn’t know his original name would never be able to recognize him but those who did would easily be able to tell who he was. His once perpetually messy mass of curls had been left to grow and now reached just passed his shoulders falling in beautiful ringlets that he often left loose. It no longer looked messy instead it looked as though he had put in a great deal of effort despite doing little more than running a brush through it after he washed it. When he was doing any kind of fighting or training he took great care in intricately braiding it up in a tight design so it was away from his face and not easily grasped and used against him.</p><p>The braided hairstyle had been taught to him by a reaper who preferred to use the guise of a young woman and had taken on the name of Tessa, She had tried to teach him multiple hairstyles but the braided one was the one he used most often when he didn’t let it lay loose. The hairs style pulled his hair tight to his crown in a series of three braids on either side of his head going all the way back to meet in an elaborate knot at the back of his head before forming a large braid to fall down the last of his back a silver strap of spikes threaded through it as a nasty surprise who thought to grab and pull.<br/>
His hair wasn’t the only difference about him. His muscle tone had bulked up a little, to give him a lithe build, better suiting his small form, making him deceptively delicate, but no longer skinny and starving. He also had a set of tattoo’s that symbolized his allegiance and relationship with Death or Black God as Death was known in the Tortallian universe. Right at the base of his throat a chrysanthemum was tattooed in dark purple, almost black ink, behind the back of his right ear was a small flock of three small ravens. In a fit of ironic mocking he’d also had the dark mark tattooed on his left forearm, the snakes scales done in great detail with various green shades from bright poisonous green to dark forest green, wrapped around and coming through the eye socket of the blanch white of the grinning skull. The eye socket that didn’t have the snake had green ink atop the black making it look slick and eerie like a dark glow. His last tattoo was on the outer side of his right pinky, a simple Greek theta symbol done in black ink.</p><p>He’d also received a few piercings, and while they had done to fit the whole aesthetic Hadrian had been set on achieving, Death had required a few protective runes on them before the being had placed small amounts of his essence into the piercings. Both of his ears were pierced in the lobe with small emeralds, no larger than half the size of his pinky nail. Both of them were spelled to protect him from accidents and injury. The top of his left ear had three hoops two carved from black obsidian, and spelled with tracking spells and spells that alerted Death as to his physical health so the being would always know where he was and his wellbeing. The third was gold and was spelled with something similar to a portkey allowing him to return to Death’s side if he wished too. His last piercing had been a bit of contention between Hadrian and Death. It was the first time Hadrian had truly realized how much of a father figure Death had truly become. After a series of arguments Death had relented and had allowed Hadrian to get his tongue pierced with a silver barbell. Death had spelled every spell himself ensuring there was no way it would ever become infected and spelling it to neutralize any poisons or harmful potions Hadrian may consume. An unfortunate or perhaps fortunate side effect was that alcohol no longer had any effect on him and Hadrian was unable to become drunk.</p><p>Needless to say with Hadrian’s build, weapons, tattoos, piercings, and affections for the black, silver and, darker colored pigments, he pulled off a very bad boy vibe. Hadrian did as he was bid, conjuring a large black wooden trunk and floating it ahead of him into the closet. It didn’t take long for him to pack it half full of various pieces of clothing, all in an older medieval style clothing style. He conjured several smaller wooden boxes, padding one with a few of his scarves before gently as to not tangle the chains, placed some of his jewelry inside and packed in the trunk on top of his cloths. Some of his weapons followed as he changed the clothing he was currently wearing to something more suitable for where he was going. His tee and skinny jeans were exchanged for a long dark green tunic and dark grey leggings. He used one of his longer grey scarves to tie it tight around his waist in a form of belt hanging his small sword in sheath from the scarf as well as his dagger. He transfigured one of the wizarding style robes hanging on the back of the closet door into a dark grey knee length cape that hung from one shoulder, strapping his bow and quiver on after.</p><p>He floated the trunk and the second still empty wooden box out of the closet into his room setting them down on the floor before re-entering the closet to grab his forgotten cloak laying it atop the rest of his things in the trunk when he returned. The second empty box he transfigured so it looked more like an antique writing case with sections to hold ink, quills, and paper. He set about packing several ink wells, and quills before placing two empty leather bound notebooks where the paper would usually sit and closing the box up and setting it atop his jewelry box in the trunk. He double checked the weapons that were already in the trunk, several long daggers, and throwing daggers as well as a short sword he didn’t use often preferring his small sword, and pulled out four throwing daggers leaving the other six in the trunk , strapping them in various places on his body.</p><p>“Could you get me a set of small leather armor?” Hadrian asked Death looking up at the being. “I would probably be wise considering.”</p><p>“Of course,” Death said, said items appearing, floating in the air in front of Hadrian seconds later. While Hadrian could have conjured the items himself he knew Death would likely include protective enchantments he would never think of in the armor. The leather was thin and malleable, which, would make it easy to move in, but Hadrian knew that it would easily protect him from the strike of a blade. Death had included a leather cowl and Hadrian could sense the obscuring spells that would protect him from being recognized when he wore it before he had even plucked it from the air to pack it in his trunk. Poison emerald eyes met dark ones when Hadrian closed his trunk, fully packed.</p><p>“I am ready father,” Hadrian said.</p><p>“Not so,” Death said as a black coin purse appeared in the air. Death plucked it from the air, passing it to Hadrian who placed it on his makeshift belt.</p><p>“It is spelled so it cannot be cut or stolen,” Death said “It also is expanded to hold as much coin as you wish to carry. Currently there is five hundred gold , about a hundred silver and a hundred copper, if you need an excess of that amount contact me, however I do hope you perhaps earn a little yourself, I do as you know need to keep an eye on this world and would not like to have to be funding some frivolous expedition because you got bitten by some random urge little one,” Death continued. “That said if you need me for anything do not hesitate to let me know.”<br/>
“I know father,” Hadrian said with slight exasperation. “I’m ready.” Death smiled a soft smile at Hadrian and kissed the top of Hadrian’s curls shadowing them into an alley Hadrian’s trunk landing beside them.</p><p>“This is where I leave you,” Death said. Hadrian smiled at the being as Death faded away into the shadows returning to the world he was needed. Time to join this world, Hadrian thought as he picked up his trunk, using his magic to make it lighter and stepped out from the alley onto the street.</p>
