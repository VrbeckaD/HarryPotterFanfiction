  <strong> <b>Severus Snape And The Smile Of Doom.</b> </strong>
</p>
<p>Severus knows the exact moment Potter lost his mind. He remembers the instant with such blush-worthy attention to detail that he’s been avoiding the brat since <em>it</em> happened.</p>
<p><em>It</em> happened in Hogwarts' Great Hall, right in the middle of breakfast, of all places. Potter had been stuffing himself with his usual enthusiasm while Severus stared at him with horrified fascination. <em>‘</em><em>Horrified? </em><em>Pull the other one</em><em>, my friend</em><em>.’</em> Severus huffs, ignoring his inner-voice’s irritating babbling in favor of remembering The Moment.</p>
<p>Potter had smiled at him. He’d looked him right in the eye and shot him an honest-to-Merlin sunny smile full of dimples, affection-warmed gaze, and bulging cheeks crammed full of cranberry scones. Despite his stubborn determination to do so, Severus can’t forget that unexpected sight. He recalls Potter’s amazing, toe-curling smile in impeccable detail. “It wasn't amazing. It was dreadful. Positively dreadful<em>.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p>‘<em>Dreadful</em><em>?  </em><em>Pft!  20 years a spy and you still suck at lying.</em> <em>That </em><em>smile</em> <em>touched</em> <em>you</em><em> more deeply than Morsmordre, mate.</em><em>’</em></p>
<p>“Shut the fuck up!” Severus growls, pinching the bridge of his nose with anxious fingers. He hates his inner-voice with soul-deep passion. It has only ever brought him useless things like guilt, self-awareness, and a veritable heap of pointless regrets over things he can’t change.</p>
<p>‘<em>You can’t change this, either. So why are you hiding in the staffroom like a frightened rabbit?  Potter smiled at you, you, idiot. He’s going to find you and smile at you some more, and you’ll take one look at him and melt at his feet like a-</em></p>
<p>“Salazar!  Why don’t you shut up already?” Severus hisses just as Potter walks in. The brat halts, eyes the empty room, shrugs, and then does <em>it</em> again.</p>
<p>“Your smiles won’t work on me, Potter. I’m immune.” Severus warns him.</p>
<p>Potter’s smile grows delighted. “I don’t think you are.”</p>
<p>“You’re wrong.”</p>
<p>“I’m not. And I’m willing to prove it.” Potter purrs, and Severus realizes he’s totally, utterly, screwed. <em>‘</em><em>Y</em><em>es, </em><em>p</em><em>lease.’</em></p>
<p>Severus is too busy going weak at the knees to remind his inner-voice to shut the hell up. And when Potter steps forwards and shuts <em>him</em> up instead, Severus realizes there’s no point. The stupid thing is always right anyway.<br/> </p></div>
