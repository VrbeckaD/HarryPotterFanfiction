    <p>It has always been James and Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Before there was James and Lily, or Sirius and Remus, there was James and Sirius. Two halves of one, chaotic, maddening whole. All through Hogwarts, they were inseparable, capable of conversing only through a look or the raise of an eyebrow, able to wheedle their way out of all trouble with a twin set of smiles. It surprised neither of them, then, that their connection was so effervescent in other ways too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The first time Sirius kissed James he knew he was gay, apparently. He’d known it since he was old enough to notice other people in that way, he said later. Some part of him had always watched that Kestral’s Seeker more than he watched the blonde Beater who caught the eye of every hot-blooded Wizard within fifty metres. They were in the Quidditch changing room, high on the adrenaline of a good practise, James in his first year of Captaincy, Sirius extraordinarily proud of his friend. They kissed until they were breathless, pressing against each other, neither of them knowing what to do with the sheer force of feeling racketing through them. The first time James kissed Sirius it was a day later, in the evening, after <em>so much </em>deliberation. He cornered Sirius in their bathroom once the others had gone to bed and whispered <em>I think I like blokes too, mate</em>. They came together that night, behind Sirius’ bed-curtains, rutting desperately and gasping with every new discovery of each other’s bodies.</p><p>Nothing and everything changed. James and Sirius were still one half of the best pranksters Hogwarts had ever seen, along with Remus and Peter. They laughed and joked and threw arms around each other during the day then at night scrambled to a messy climax together, laughing into each other’s mouths. They were each other’s first everything, twinned together through all of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>In October of Seventh Year, one night behind crimson drapes, high with the prospect of leaving Hogwarts for the wide-open world and some flat in Wizarding London, they had argued for the first time about each other. Sure, they had argued many times before, but never about each other, never about their <em>relationship. </em>Every time they tried it ended with blustered phrases and awkward flushes and, inevitably, kissing to avoid conversation. The kissing had come first this time, and James and Sirius lay in blissful after-glow with arms around each other when James brought up what had been on his mind for the better part of a week.</p><p>“I’m going to ask Lily to Hogsmeade tomorrow,” said James, his arm around Sirius’ shoulders.</p><p>“What? What about us?” Sirius had thrown his hands up, his voice turning pinched just like James always recognised from an argument. Usually, he could talk Sirius down but that night he hadn’t wanted to.</p><p>“There’ll still be us, Padfoot. I just… I love Lily.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You love her!?” Sirius shoved at James’ bare shoulder where they were entwined. “Fucking hell, Prongs.”</p><p>“I’ve been saying for years, haven’t I?!” James shouted back, glad for the silencing charms at that moment, straightening his glasses on his nose.</p><p>“I didn’t think you <em>meant</em> it! What about us?”</p><p>“What about us?! I love you too, Sirius, is that so fucking hard to understand?”</p><p>“Yeah! Because you won’t. She’ll take over, and it’s <em>always</em> been us, Prongs, and then you’ll live with her and get married and have kids because you can’t well fucking do that with me, can you?”</p><p>“Can still love you though. I can do both.”</p><p>Sirius turned away and pulled on his pyjama bottoms, the faint reddish light of their dormitory casting copper warmth over his alabaster skin. “Not the same, Jamie. I love you too, but it’s not the same.”</p><p>“Well what about you and Moony, huh?” James shot back. If there was one thing James Potter knew for sure it was how boundless his love for Sirius Black was, and to have the other boy question that hurt.</p><p>Sirius stilled. “What <em>about</em> me and Moony?”</p><p>“I know you fancy him. I see you looking. And I see him looking back.”</p><p>Sirius had given James a long, hard look. His grey eyes were cold and almost cruel and then he threw back the bedcovers and slipped across the dormitory to pull back Remus’ drapes without a second glance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James had flopped back onto his pillows with an exasperated sigh. He heard only muffled conversation and a few breathy little laughs, then what he suspected was the sound of kissing before the unnatural, empty silence of a silencing charm. <em>Fine,</em> James had thought, sniffing and trying to drop off to sleep. <em>If that’s what you want, Padfoot.</em></p><p>James had been dutiful and taken Lily on dates to the Three Broomsticks and weathered one awful afternoon at Madam Puddifoot’s because that’s what he thought she wanted but then she leaned over with a glint her in her green eyes and said <em>let’s get out of here, if I see another doily I’ll puke</em>. James loved Lily, of that he was sure, but he knew there was space in his heart for Sirius too.</p><p>One day James walked into the dormitory—there had only been a few weeks of school left and Quidditch practise was disgustingly warm in the June heat—and saw Sirius and Remus kissing, sprawled together on Remus’ bed, surrounded by books. Sirius’ shirt was unbuttoned, his hair mussed in the way that James recognised and the way that sent heat coiling through his insides. He had done the typical teenage boy thing of <em>Oh Merlin, you two! Decency please! </em>and covered his eyes whilst grabbing his towel and toiletry bag, but he’d caught Sirius’ eye and smiled a smile that he hoped said <em>I’m happy for you</em>. Just how happy he was for Sirius, and Remus, surprised James. Sirius and Remus were good together, and James wanted Sirius to be happy. He still <em>wanted</em> Sirius, but he wanted them both to be happy too.</p><p>Their separation didn't last long. James and Sirius were magnetic alone, but together? And towards each other? It was impossible to avoid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius cornered James after Muggle Studies on a Wednesday afternoon. He’d dragged them into an empty classroom, shoved James against the wall and kissed him hard on the mouth. “I want you back,” he’d whispered into James’ mouth, where he eagerly swallowed the words. “I can do both.”</p><p>Presently, James is once again pressed against a wall, Sirius’ toned body pressed against his. Everything about the pair slot together perfectly, the same height, the perfect amount of broadness to the shoulders to wrap arms around. They both tilted to the left when they kissed and never, ever, bumped foreheads. Perhaps that was what happened when you’ve been kissing another bloke for five years.</p><p>“Merlin, <em>shit</em>, Pads,” James hisses as Sirius kisses down the column of his throat and palms a hand over the line of his cock through his jeans.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, Prongs, come on.” Sirius grins luridly and pitches back to divest himself of his shirt before he pulls James’ over his head too.</p><p>Laughing, James straightens his glasses before pulling Sirius bodily back towards him and sliding his tongue between Sirius’ waiting lips. Sirius ruts against him for a heartbeat before James grins. “Not before you do.”</p><p>Sirius’ grin could cut glass. “We always play this game, Jamie.”</p><p>“You love it.” James undoes Sirius’ jeans and shoves his hand beneath the denim to stroke over his cock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Sirius’ voice is like molasses as he presses James back into the wall and nibbles along his jawline. “You always lose.”</p><p>“Liar.” James twists his wrist at the end of one delicious, long, slick stroke.</p><p>“80/20, then.” Sirius’ nimble fingers dance over the buttons of James’ jeans.</p><p>James snorts. “60/40.”</p><p>Sirius bites at James’ collarbone and pulls James’ jeans open. “Shut up and get naked, Prongs.”</p><p>James moans and lets Sirius pull him towards the bed. “Shut up and fuck me then, Padfoot.”</p><p>“I love you, you git.”</p><p>“Arse, I love you too.”</p><p>They’re in the spare room. <em>James and Lily’s spare room</em>. Never in their bedroom, never in the place where they have sex or sleep or wake up on Sunday mornings tangled together. James knows he should give this up. He knows he can’t have both, especially not with keeping it a secret from Lily. But James can’t choose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He loves Lily, he’s loved Lily Evans since he saw her, Fourth Year Duelling Club, deflect a Hex from a Slytherin and fire back the most terrifyingly punishing Jelly-Legs Jinx he’d ever seen, all without batting an eyelid. He loves their little flat together, their lives, their laughs and conversations and little quips and the glorious, <em>glorious</em> sex. James has lost count of the amount of Quidditch comparisons he’s made to Lily being a better broomstick rider than he is, despite the fact she corrects him every time and says <em>isn’t it flier?</em> whilst absolutely riding him into the mattress. He loves Lily, loves the engagement ring he's had since they finished Hogwarts, tucked at the back of his dresser. He loves Lily Evans, and will do for the rest of his bloody life.</p><p>But he loves Sirius too. He’s loved Sirius Black since they stepped into the Great Hall on September 1<sup>st</sup> 1971 and Sirius had whispered <em>here, didn’t realise we were part of a Fantastic Beasts reenactment. Chapter Four, Trolls and other Ogroids, including Mr. Forehead-for-</em><b><em>Miles </em></b><em>over there. </em>He loves drinking beer and dissecting the Kestral’s last—abysmal—performance together and getting a little too enthusiastic, he loves the way he can grin at Sirius and the other man knows <em>exactly</em> what that particular smile, the one with the canine puckering over his bottom lip, means. He loves their glorious, <em>glorious</em> sex, laughing into kisses and trading barbs and puns and wit so frighteningly sharp James might cut himself. He loves Sirius Black, has done and will do for his whole bloody life.</p><p>James straightens the bedsheets afterwards, still loose-limbed and limber and the hasty <em>Scourgify</em> has left a tackiness between his thighs where Sirius had fucked with abandon only five minutes earlier. Sirius pulls on his jeans and sits heavily on the end of the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We should stop this.”</p><p>It’s Sirius’ turn to say it this time. They trade places every time, dizzy with afterglow and tasting of each other’s kisses. The words hang heavy in the air between them.</p><p>James sighs and sits on the edge of the bed next to him. He tells Sirius what Sirius told him last week. “I don’t want to.”</p><p>Sirius’ head drops onto his shoulder. “Neither do I.”</p>
