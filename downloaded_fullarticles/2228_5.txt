    <p>
  <span>Remus went back to his London flat on Halloween night. The war was still going on, with no signs of stopping, and he was tired. He was always tired. He couldn’t think of a time in his life where he’d felt well-rested, not since he’d been five years old and he’d been turned. Things had gotten worse after he’d joined the Order, but he had no intent of leaving now. He couldn’t turn his back on the very people who had made his life worth something. He couldn’t turn his back on his extended family. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So Remus fought, and pretended to be like the other werewolves and he came home tired every night. This night was supposed to be no different than the others. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His flat was bare. There wasn’t anything on the walls, and there were only a few books leaned against the shelves. The couch had no cushions, and the only things in the pantry were a half a bag of rice and a few canned vegetables. It was a sad, barely lived in little one bedroom, but Remus had no intentions of changing it. Not while there was a war outside and he was spending more time away from his flat than in it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He dropped his coat down on the couch, toed his boots off and let them fall where they fell, and made his way to the bedroom. He was too tired to scrape together a dinner. There was food if he wanted it, leftovers from the last time he’d had the energy to do more than get take out, but Remus couldn’t be arsed to grab it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was too tired. He was always too tired. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus slipped off his socks and fell into bed. He switched the lamp off with his wand and placed it under his pillow before turning onto his back and closing his eyes. He never slept well, but he knew better than to keep himself awake. Laying alone in the dark was better than sitting awake in his living room and waiting for exhaustion to win him over. Exhaustion never won. Remus could be inches from passing out and still not pass out. His body was wired, always wired and ready to fight back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He squeezed his eyes shut. He, James, Sirius, Peter, and Lily had been fighting for nearly four years. They’d been fighting before then, in different ways, and at one point Sirius had joked about how they were all just child soldiers in their parents’ war. Remus, alone in his bed on Halloween, couldn’t help but agree. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Voldemort was dangerous, of course, but Remus was tired of fighting. He was tired of being thrown around and used as an example and a pawn and an attack dog. He was a werewolf before he was a human in the eyes of both sides, and he </span>
  <em>
    <span>hated it</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He’d spent his whole life trying to be more than the beast inside him, and for what?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus rubbed his face and willed his mind to shut the fuck up for once. He just wanted to sleep. He closed his eyes again, and thought about nothing but the sounds of London outside his window. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was startled awake and had his hand on his wand before he’d fully registered that something was off. Remus shifted his grip and slowly got out of bed. He couldn’t hear anyone, but the hairs on the back of his neck were standing on end and he </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew</span>
  </em>
  <span> something was awry. He didn’t know what, but he was worried enough to go investigate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pushed his bedroom door open. No one was in the living area. The lamp was still on, casting shadows across the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus walked across the room, to the front door. He was still holding his wand. If it was one of his Muggle neighbours, he hoped that they wouldn’t notice it. Or that they’d assume it was a kitchen knife and that he was overly paranoid from living alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He opened the door an inch, and then a few more when he saw who it was. Remus frowned, not letting go of his wand. “Sirius?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You need to take Harry,” Sirius said. He and Harry--James’ and Lily’s Harry--were wet, as though they’d walked from Godric’s Hollow all the way into London. Sirius’ grey eyes were hollow, ghosted over with fear and rage and other emotions Remus didn’t have the energy to put a name to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” Remus said. He didn’t open the door further. He was awake enough to be wary, not awake enough to be worried for Harry and Sirius’ immediate safety. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“James… and, and Lily--” Sirius cut himself off, shaking his head and letting droplets of water spray away from him. He held Harry out towards Remus. “Take him. I have to find Pete.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus opened the door the rest of the way. He wanted to ask Sirius to come in, to demand answers to unasked questions. Where were James and Lily? Were they, as Remus feared, dead? Had Voldemort--</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius pushed Harry into Remus’ arms before Remus could articulate any of his questions, and then he dropped down and became Padfoot and scampered off. Remus was left in the doorway of his flat, holding his dead friends’ son, and still half asleep. Remus swallowed the questions back down and looked at Harry. Harry was half asleep as well, moreso than Remus, and there were dried tears mixed in with the rainwater on his cheeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus reached up and wiped away some of the wetness as something settled uneasily in the depths of his stomach. “Harry, love, I’m so sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry curled his tiny fist around Remus’ shirt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can’t stay here,” Remus whispered into the night. Sirius was going to come back, but Remus didn’t know how long it would take for him to find Peter and make sure that Peter was safe. It was just him and Harry, with no answers because no questions were ever asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus shook his head. “We can’t stay here. I don’t… I don’t know who told him, but you… you’re still in danger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was talking to a baby. Harry had no idea what Remus was saying. Remus had no idea where he was supposed to go. He was afraid to go to any other wizard, even Dumbledore or someone else in the Order, because he didn’t know who he could trust at this moment. Sirius and Pete had been closest to Harry’s parents, and he didn’t know where either of them had gone off to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius… Remus’ brain finally woke up, and he gripped Harry tighter. Sirius had been the Potters’ Secret Keeper. Sirius was the only one who’d known where they were. Sirius… Sirius was the only one who could have gotten them killed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus looked down at Harry again, willing his arms to stop shaking and for the feeling of bile to go back down his throat. Sirius had gotten James and Lily killed. Remus didn’t know why he’d decided to leave Harry behind, but he had. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He took a deep, steadying breath and reminded himself that there was still somewhere Sirius didn’t know to look for him. He brushed Harry’s hair down. “I know where we need to go. I’ll keep you safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hope Howell Lupin was a force of nature. Remus had never let his friends meet his mum. He wasn’t embarrassed of her, no, but he was worried that they’d be overwhelmed. Hope, upon realising that Remus’ father couldn’t see his son as anything but a werewolf, had forced the man out of his home and taken it for herself and her son. Hope had engineered locks on the basement door that didn’t require spells but were still strong enough to keep Remus safe while he transformed. Hope had added a rainbow striped flag to the decor when Remus told her he fancied blokes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hope was, for all intents and purposes, the strongest person Remus had ever met. She was also the only person he knew he could trust with Harry Potter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He apparated into his mum’s kitchen at around four in the morning, and the feeling of familiar and magic and home overwhelmed him. He’d added layer after layer of protective magic to this place once he left Hogwarts. Remus knew his mum was strong, but he didn’t want to put her at risk. He wouldn’t have been able to live with himself if she’d been hurt in the war. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus looked around now, taking in a room he hadn’t seen since he’d been eighteen and had come home after graduation to tell Hope that he was joining the Order. She’d been proud and worried all at once, and she’d made Remus promise to get out alive. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Somehow, he had. Somehow, James and Lily hadn’t. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus swallowed back the tears that were threatening to spill over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry chose that moment to wake up and look at Remus with bright green eyes. Those eyes crinkled down into a look of confusion, and he let go of Remus’ shirt. “Moo’y?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s me,” Remus said, choking on the words. He was going to have to tell Harry about his parents. He was going to have to face reality and find out exactly what had happened to Harry’s parents as well. Remus didn’t want to do any of that. He wanted to find his mum and curl up under one of her many blankets and avoid the world for a while.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The lights flipped on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Remus?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked up, and the first tear of the night finally fell. His mum was standing in her bathrobe, holding a cricket bat in one hand while her other was on the light switch. The bat fell to the floor with a clatter and Hope crossed over to her son. Her face was creased over with worry as she took in him and Harry. “What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think You Know Who--” Remus’ voice gave up on him and he couldn’t get the words out. He looked down at Harry, whose green eyes were welling up with tears. “Harry’s parents. I--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, God,” Hope said. She reached out and slowly took Harry from Remus as Harry began to cry for real. Remus rubbed at his own face as his mum rocked Harry, speaking to him in a soft voice. Remus tried to focus on her and not on his own body. He felt the way he often did before a full moon, as though his insides were too much to contain and that he would either explode or fold in on himself. Everything ached, but there wasn’t a warm bath that could solve this ache. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mum,” Remus said. He blinked, hard, ignoring the wetness on his own cheeks. “We need somewhere safe, to stay until… until I know what to do next.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your room is still useable,” she said. She kissed the top of Harry’s head. “And I should be able to find your old crib in the attic. I’ll look tomorrow. Tonight, Harry can sleep in my bed and I’ll make sure he doesn’t roll too far away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Remus said. He didn’t mention that he wouldn’t be able to sleep any time soon. He figured his mum would come to that conclusion on her own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to wake you for breakfast?” she asked. Harry’s crying had calmed, and now he was just sniffling with his face buried against Hope’s shoulder. She was bouncing him. “Or should I let you sleep as much as you need? You look like you haven’t slept since we last spoke.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I feel it,” he said. He wiped the back of his hand across his face. “But… I’d like it if you woke me. I… we should figure out what we’re doing now that everything… now that everything’s gone tits up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hope nodded in agreement, and sent Remus back to his old room. Remus let himself be sent back. He couldn’t do much now. The shock of the past few hours was settling into his bones, and he needed to lay down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked up at the exposed beams on the ceiling above him as the sun tried to rise. James and Lily were most likely dead. Sirius had, to some extent, betrayed them. Sirius was a wild card now, and Remus couldn’t trust him to come back or to even be a friend. Remus didn’t know. There was so much that he didn’t know, and it was suffocating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t bring himself to think about Peter. If Sirius was the traitor, then Peter was surely dead by now. If Sirius was the traitor, then he had to be out there, trying to hunt Remus and Harry down, trying to finish what he’d started by letting Voldemort know the location of the Potters. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus squeezed his eyes shut as his heart twisted itself around his ribcage. He’d been too startled by Sirius’ presence tonight to think about why he’d come to Remus first. Remus had spent the better part of his adolescence being caught off guard by Sirius, and now… now he was at his mum’s home in Wales, with his dead friend’s son, wondering where his life was headed next. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had no idea what he was going to do tomorrow, or the day after that. He had no idea if the war was over, or if Sirius would find him again. All he had was Harry and his mum, and he had to keep them safe. He couldn’t protect anyone else, so he had to protect them.</span>
