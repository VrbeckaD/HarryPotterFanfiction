    <p>Grimmauld Place smells like memories, mildew and magic.</p><p>It is strange being back here after all this time.  </p><p>It has been a year and already the dust is so thick on the surfaces of cups, tables and random trinkets mostly saturated with Dark energy that Harry could draw a picture into it, a shadow of a smile playing along his mouth as he remembers a little boy drawing a birthday cake into the dusty floor of a lighthouse on a rock in the wild sea.</p><p>Hermione is clutching Ron’s hand, she too broken, a scar marring her forearm; his legs littered with the marks of memories, his eyes still haunted by the death of his brother.</p><p>They have each other and Harry is glad that they are still by his side.<br/>
He does try to express his feelings and his gratitude by carefully placing one hand onto Hermione’s shoulder because she is still sensitive to touch and hugging Ron who is almost a foot taller than him but still collapses into Harry’s embrace and stays there for several silent but treasured moments.</p><p>He carefully plucks a spider from his hair and sets it onto the windowsill where it spins its net.<br/>
Ron shudders behind him and Harry has to grin although it is a cracked, lopsided one that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. </p><p>Some things never change.</p><p>Memories of laughter and hugs linger here, memories of pain and darkness, of names burnt off a carpet and Harry has to blink because he still feels warm hands lingering on his shoulders, still hears barking laughter.</p><p>Hermione touches his arm, her fingers soft and shaking but reassuring and he pulls himself out of the guilt that threatened to swallow him whole. </p><p>Sometimes when it gets too much and the darkness in their minds is too cloying, they cuddle up together, all in one bed, Ron very gently holding Hermione and Hermione’s hand in Harry’s. It anchors and calms Harry more than he is willing to admit.</p><p>Cleaning up the house is therapeutic for Harry and it seems to be therapeutic for Ron and Hermione as well.</p><p>Ginny joins them, still fiery, still wonderful even though she seems thinner, the bags under her eyes still prominent. But she is willing to help, bringing Neville and artistic Dean and a very enthusiastic Seamus along.<br/>
And Luna. Sweet and gentle Luna with her long hair up in a very messy bun and radishes in her hair, fingers already marred with green and red paint.<br/>
Her hugs still feel the same, reassuring and slightly flighty, like her.</p><p>Ginny and her work like a charm, like clockwork while painting the walls with blossoming flowers as red as Ginny’s hair and Harry does not feel jealous. It’s just strange to let something go, something so easy and normal and something so warm and familiar.<br/>
But Ginny is smiling when Luna dabs a blob of green paint onto the tip of her nose and laughing harder than she has ever done with Harry and he is just happy she found someone better than him. Someone more suited.</p><p>Harry watches them all, Dean and Seamus jokingly dancing along to a slow song on the radio, laughing and smiling, close and fitting like two puzzle pieces, Ginny watching Luna with warmth in her eyes while they dust off a cabinet and Ron helping Hermione lift an especially heavy set of enchanted chandeliers, Neville heatedly arguing with the portrait of old Mrs. Black and making her shut up for the first time and suddenly a fierce warmth fills Harry, happiness roaring through him after all these dark moments he spent alone in his mind, trapped between shocked faces, screams, fire and pain. </p><p>But now there is love in his heart. It’s so much that it envelops him and threatens to keel him over. They didn’t have to come but they all did. For him and for themselves, for each other.</p><p>Sirius’ room is the hardest. They leave most of it untouched, especially the posters that cannot be removed. It still smells like him and Harry spends a night between the covers, burying his nose in the fading scent, his eyes burning with unshed tears. </p><p>He hasn’t cried since the end of the war. </p><p>It is as if his body is tired of crying, has out-cried itself.<br/>
Sometimes he wishes he could cry.<br/>
He feels broken and strange, hasn’t even cried at Fred’s funeral despite guilt and sadness clogging his throat, hasn’t cried when Tonks and Remus were buried side by side, Andromeda holding Teddy, almost clutching him as if she could lose him like she lost her daughter and her son-in-law.</p><p>Sleep does not come easy that night and when it does, it is almost morning, the sun touching his eyelids, prodding him awake. Crookshanks is lying beside him, purring sleepily.<br/>
Harry is for some reason his favourite human even preferred to Hermione which sometimes makes her roll her eyes in fond exasperation every time Crookshanks yet again tries to groom Harry’s hair into some semblance of order.</p><p>He gently shoves the tomcat from his lap, receiving a protesting noise for his efforts and stretches carefully; rooting through the bedside drawers for a brush when suddenly his fingers close around a small container of some kind. Carefully he fishes it out and stares at a bottle of purple nail polish, dried out but still glinting at him as if it’s winking, daring him to something.</p><p>He has only ever seen pictures of Sirius with black nail polish, expertly applied but this certain purple shade is something his godfather would have worn too, smiling a dazzling and devastating smile.<br/>
It’s dried out, completely unusable but Harry knows an expert in cosmetic charms, so he trudges down the stairs, bottle of nail polish clutched in his shaky fingers and something like hope and light in his butterfly heart.</p><p>Ginny is already awake, almost drowning in green pyjamas that are a bit too big for her slim frame and fiddling with the sleeves of a cardigan that is clearly Luna’s because Ginny does not own anything so whimsical.<br/>
Her smile is as shaky as Harry’s fingers but her eyes are as fierce as ever.<br/>
“Already awake too?” she asks him, her voice tinged with the remnants of sleep and warmth. </p><p>Harry nods and fixes her a cup of tea, setting the small bottle down onto the counter. It feels strange parting with it, as if the touch of his godfather still lingers.<br/>
“You know how they get sometimes. The nightmares. Tonight I dreamed of Sirius if I even dreamed at all. Sleep isn’t very easy,” he confesses and slides her favourite cup over to her, pouring himself a cup as well and cradling it with scarred, thin fingers, the warmth seeping into his hands. He loses himself in the warm, woodsy colour of the tea for a few moments before his eyes snap back to Ginny.<br/>
Sometimes he has these moments. Losing himself in small details and having trouble to find the way back.</p><p>She nods and picks up the bottle of nail polish, rotating it in the light.<br/>
“Where did you find this?” she asks and looks at him through the steady steam of the tea. “Sirius’ room?”</p>
