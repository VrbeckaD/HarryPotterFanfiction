    <p>“I have no interest in being one of your fanatics,” Newt said, eyeing the blue flames around Grindelwald as they moved to encircle Newt, too. </p><p>“No, but you have an interest in your creatures, don’t you?” The Dark Wizard murmured, circling Newt who was feeling decidedly more and more uncomfortable. Through the roar of the flames Newt could hear Theseus shouting for him, but it was too loud to clearly hear what the British Auror was saying. </p><p>“Think about it, Newton. In a world where we didn’t have to hide, they wouldn’t either,” Grindelwald stood right behind Newt now, his voice whispering in Newt’s ear. The Magizoologist tried not to shiver, having the Dark Wizard so close to him- and his voice was so soft and enchanting. </p><p>“I just want to protect them and educate others about them.” He replied, trying hard to look straight ahead and not be distracted. He didn’t notice when Grindelwald’s arm wrapped around his waist, pulling Newt flush against the German’s chest. </p><p>“Imagine, Newton- every resource at your disposal, laws in place to protect them. Your fantastic beasts flourishing with no poachers to hurt them. No Occamy eggs shattered for their silver, no Bowtruckles stolen for their lock-picking skills. An entire division of wizards and witches who care just as much as you out in the world with the only goal to maintain the beasts’ safety. </p><p>Newt’s heart was beating like a war drum in his chest, the warmth of the flames and the coolness of Grindelwald’s touch and voice was making his mind very fuzzy. </p><p>Grindelwald continued, pressing kisses to Newt’s neck as he did so,</p><p>“Let me give you that world, Newton. Stay at my side and it’ll be yours.” </p><p>The Magizoologist felt like he was swallowing tar as he replied softly, </p><p>“Okay.”</p>
