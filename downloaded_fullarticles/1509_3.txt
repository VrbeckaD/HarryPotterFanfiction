    <p>Sirius had been gone for four days. That in itself wasn’t unusual; he would often disappear for days at a time. But this was the first time he had gone without telling anyone where he was going.<br/> Remus wasn’t worrying. At least, that’s what he told James. James was definitely worrying, pacing up and down the small lounge in Remus and Sirius’ shared flat. <br/> "He can’t just be gone." James said, the worry evident in his voice. "Have you texted him?"<br/> "Sit down, James." Lily said, for what seemed like the thousandth time. She was sitting opposite Remus on the small sofa, nursing a glass of wine. She claimed to have earned it.<br/> James ignored her. "He can’t have <em>gone</em>." He repeated, more forcefully, as if believing it hard enough would make Sirius reappear in the small room, grinning and smoking one of his damn cigarettes.<br/> "He isn’t gone." Lily told him, trying to sound reassuring. "He goes on trips all the time."<br/> "But he doesn’t just leave without telling anyone! What if he gets hurt?"<br/> Remus really didn’t want to think about that possibly. "He won’t." He said, shortly. He loved James, he really did, but his presence was doing nothing for the worry gnawing at Remus’ stomach. <br/> James seemed to sense this and sat down beside Lily, only to jump up again less than five minutes later at a noise from the bedroom, knocking over a small table and tipping a small - and thankfully empty - glass onto the floor.<br/> Cat emerged from where she had been sleeping at the end of the bed and walked over to rest her head in Remus’ lap and look up at him with pleading eyes. <br/> She was a German Shepard, which Sirius had brought home one evening in the middle of a storm, her fur wet and matted. Remus had made him promise that she would go to a shelter first thing in the morning, and yet somehow, two years later, she was still living with them.<br/> "You miss him too, huh?" He asked her, scratching behind her ears in the way she liked.<br/> She wagged her tail weakly, but she was clearly pining. Sirius had always been her favourite.<br/> James sheepishly returned to his spot on the sofa. Remus couldn’t be angry with him. They were all just worried.<br/> "We should go to bed." Lily told them firmly. Remus wanted to fight with her, tell her that he was going to stay up until Sirius walked back in the front door, but she was right. They all needed sleep, not to mention a distraction. <br/> James opened his mouth to argue and then closed it again. <br/> The three of them quietly pulled out the sofa-bed and said their goodnights. Remus headed back to his room, sending a quick text to Peter to update him on the situation. The fifth member of their little group was off in America, and although he had offered to come back when Remus had texted him to tell him Sirius was gone, between him and James they had assured him that it was fine to stay.<br/> <em>kk :( </em>Came the reply, quickly followed by:<br/> <em>im sure he’ll b fine</em><br/> <em>make sure u get enough sleep xx</em><br/> Remus smiled briefly and replied with a simple <em>will do</em>, before plugging his phone in and falling on his face. <br/> The pillow still smelled faintly of Sirius’ hair products. <br/> Remus felt the bed creak a few minutes later as Cat crawled in. It was quite a small bed for two fully grown men and a large dog, but it still felt huge and empty in Sirius' absence.<br/> <em>He’s fine.</em> Remus told himself. <em>He’s just gone off on and forgotten to tell us where he is. It doesn’t mean anything.</em><br/> It was undoubtedly the most logical explanation, especially since Sirius was scatty at the best of times, but he had never done this before.<br/> He had left his phone at the apartment, too. That was unlikely to be a mistake. Sirius never forgot his phone.<br/> Remus drifted off into an uneasy sleep, his dreams filled with all sorts of terrible scenarios.<br/> When he woke up it was to the loud chime of his phone going off. He had left it off silent on the off chance that Sirius tried to contact him, or if Peter heard anything. <br/> He picked it up and winced as the bright light filled the room.<br/> There was one message on the screen, from an unknown number. It seemed to be a link to a YouTube video.</p>
<p>The smart thing to do would be to delete the message and block the number. It was probably a virus, and would do nothing for his phone.</p>
<p>It could be Sirius, though. It was a minute chance, but enough to make Remus pause to plug in his headphones, then hesitantly click on the video.</p>
<p><em>Misguided Ghosts [Guitar]</em> said the title. Remus watched the loading circle spin around and around, ignoring the tight feeling in his stomach.</p>
<p><em>For Remus</em> the video read, when it finally loaded. It was Sirius, then.</p>
<p>The feeling in Remus' stomach only tightened.</p>
<p>The video faded to black and the opening chords of the song started, followed by the soft, familiar sound of Sirius' voice singing the first lines of the song.</p>
<p>
  <em>I am going away for a while, but I'll be back don't try to follow me.</em>
</p>
<p>Remus' eyes started stinging only a few lines in, and by the time the final chords played he was crying hard enough that he could barely see the words that appeared on the screen. He frantically paused the video and wiped his eyes until the words swam into focus.</p>
<p>
  <em>I'm really sorry to leave with so little notice.</em>
</p>
<p>The words faded out and were replaced.</p>
<p>
  <em>I just need some time.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I love you.</em>
</p>
<p>Remus paused the video on the last screen and stared at it until his eyes were swimming with tears again and the words were out of focus.</p>
<p>He must have made some sort of noise, because there was a soft knock on the door and he looked up to see Lily standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” she asked quietly, stepping into the room.</p>
<p>Remus beckoned her towards him and offered her a headphone. She sat on the bed, displacing Cat, and put the headphone in.</p>
<p>Remus restarted the video and they watched it together until the end.</p>
<p>There was a silence. Neither of them seemed to be able to think of anything to say.</p>
<p>“What a <em>dick.</em>” Lily said finally.</p>
<p>Remus cracked a tiny smile. Lily was very good at knowing what to say. She'd always been one of his closest friends, even before she started dating James.</p>
<p>“I can't believe he’d just up and leave,” she continued, a furious edge to her voice, “leaving nothing but a <em>song.</em> Trust Sirius Black.”</p>
<p>At least someone was angry. Remus couldn't feel anything but numb. He knew that Sirius meant well, that he didn't mean to hurt anyone, but he certainly hadn't thought this through. That was just how Sirius was.</p>
