    <p>Two years after the war, and people slowly moved on with their lives.</p><p>Grief gave way to a dull but bearable ache, almost ignorable on some days, decidedly not on others, but most found ways to cope. To forget. To remember…but to live.</p><p>Life went on. Everyone played at normalcy.</p><p>Hermione Granger was grateful for this, mostly. She was grateful that the post-war media frenzy had finally died down, that the public had focused their attention on Ron and Harry as they began their Auror training and gave her space when she chose to return to Hogwarts for her seventh year.</p><p>She’d never been comfortable with the fame. The questions, the hero worship, the life under a microscope—it made her uneasy.</p><p>She was grateful for the unwavering support she received from Harry and Ron, when she finally broke down one day, sobbing and overwhelmed with the pressure, and by what she had come to realize was post-traumatic stress. They’d both held her and talked her down from the edge and reassured her that they’d do their best to bear the brunt of it. They didn’t crave the attention, but they didn’t mind it.</p><p>So the two of them jumped at every interview opportunity, every press conference, every chance to do something scandalous in public or anonymously pass along gossip fodder to Rita Skeeter in hopes of making it onto Page 5. And Hermione had learnt to laugh again, when she read about their ‘antics’ in the Daily Prophet.</p><p>
  <em>Trouble in Paradise: Golden Friendship on the Rocks? Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley Call it Quits, Ron Chooses Family over Friend</em>
</p><p>Hermione very well knew that Ginny and Harry were practically engaged and as happy as ever, and that nothing as ridiculous as a breakup would ruin Ron and Harry’s bond.</p><p>And the there was the headline Hermione would never forget as long as she lived:</p><p>
  <em>Brother Lover? Harry Potter Leaves a Weasley for a Weasley: Ron and Harry’s Scandalous Secret</em>
</p><p>(Harry and Ron had gone for drinks at the Leaky Cauldron and held hands the entire time. It was Ginny’s idea).</p><p>Hermione bought three copies and had them framed as Christmas presents.</p><p>She loved her boys.</p><p>After graduating Hogwarts with straight Outstandings, Hermione accepted an entry-level position at the Ministry and tried, just as everyone else had, to lead a normal life.</p><p>Some days were harder than others.</p><p>She hadn’t yet managed to track down her parents, and after spending a week living alone in her childhood home once she’d left school, Hermione realized she wasn’t ready to be on her own.</p><p>The dark brought back memories. The silence brought back death.</p><p>One night, as she turned off the lights and locked the front door on her way to bed, she bumped into a coat rack. A coat rack that, to her dark-fouled eyes and her trauma-addled brain was most definitely a death eater poised to attack.</p><p>So she made sure to attack first.</p><p>She flung spells at the thing until the wood was a flaming pile on her floor and until she could no longer breathe. Until she became a pile on the floor herself. Until she realized she was not okay.</p><p>She managed, somehow, to apparate to The Burrow in tact, landing in the middle of the living room floor a sobbing, hyperventilating mess. Molly’d dropped her knitting at the sight of her. Ron and Harry abandoned their chess game and Ginny slammed down her copy of the Daily Prophet.</p><p>
  <em>(Weasleys Wed: Inside Ron and Harry’s Secret Ceremony) </em>
</p><p>From that night forward they made sure Hermione never had to be alone.</p><p>She moved into The Burrow.</p><p>She woke up every morning to the smell of a mother’s cooking (even if it wasn’t her mother, it was something). She drank tea with Ginny and Floo’d to work with Ron and Harry. She read books by the fire as Molly knit silently beside her. And, to her surprise, she had long conversations about love and life with Fleur, whenever she and Bill came to visit.</p><p>Hermione came to wonder why she’d ever disliked the the woman in the first place. She was older enough to be wise and almost motherly, yet young enough to relate to in a way Hermione never could with the Weasley matriarch. She was a lot more gentle with her words than Ginny. And obviously, she was infinitely less dense than either Ron or Harry.</p><p>Hermione decided she’d probably been jealous. And maybe a little bit…confused. A veela could do that to a person, after all.</p><p>Fleur had laughed when Hermione tried to apologize for her hormone-fueled animosity.</p><p><em>“Tout ça, c'est du passé.</em> It’s in the past, Hermione. We are here now, yes?” She wrapped her arm around Hermione’s shoulder and placed a kiss atop her head.</p><p>“This is what matters.”</p><p>Hermione’s blush took a full ten minutes to die down. If Fleur noticed, she hadn’t mentioned it.</p><p>“Besides, is it not so silly?” She laughed her tinkling, beautiful laugh. “We may be sisters one day, yes?”</p><p>“Uhhh.”</p><p>Hermione flushed once more. Fleur raised an eyebrow.</p><p>If Hermione was overwhelmed by the public’s expectation for her to be perfect, she was doubly overwhelmed by her friends’ expectations regarding…this.</p><p>She’d used Hogwarts as an excuse, at first. Distance didn’t make for a good beginning to a relationship. When she’d moved to The Burrow it became more unavoidable: the touches, the sidelong glances, the knowing smirks from everyone around them. She’d finally told Ron one night that she wasn’t quite ready, that she hadn’t completely healed mentally or emotionally from the horrors they’d experienced, and he’d understood.</p><p>But he hadn’t <em>understood.</em> No one had.</p><p>They all knew she would heal, and that Ron would help her heal, and that once that had happened they would finally be together, because the were meant to be. It was expected. It was fated. They knew that Hermione just needed time, that she was just waiting until she was ready.</p><p>Except she wasn’t.</p><p>“I don’t love Ron,” she finally confessed for the first time out loud. Speaking it felt different. Liberating.</p><p>“I mean, I love him, but I don't—I’m not in love with him.”</p><p>Hermione held her breath when Fleur studied her for a long moment. Then blue eyes softened and warm arms drew her in.</p><p>“That’s okay.”</p><p>And those were the only words Hermione had ever wanted to hear, about everything. It was okay. She was okay. Everything would be okay.</p><p>She wasn’t broken. She wasn’t a terrible person. She just wasn’t in love with her best friend.</p><p>And that was okay. It would be okay.</p><p>Heartened by that talk, Hermione began to rebuild herself in earnest.</p><p>She walked taller, she smiled more, she gave herself permission love Ron exactly the way she did, reminding herself that there was nothing wrong with that, that she wasn’t leading him on. He was her brother, and so was Harry, and no matter what this initially did to their relationship, they would be there for each other in the end.</p><p>(Hermione hadn’t told him yet, though. Baby steps. All in good time.)</p><p>The days got easier. The sun shone brighter. Things began to feel routine and almost…normal.</p><p>Normal. It was a strange word to apply to this little life she had.</p><p>Hermione longed to be normal, most days. She tried her best to keep a low profile and lead the simplest of lives. She refused special treatment at the Ministry and trudged along at the bottom of the barrel, just like all the other interns in The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.</p><p>But on a day like this one, Hermione wanted to scream at the top of her lungs that she had saved the world.</p><p>She wanted to ask everyone if they knew who she was, if they knew what she’d done, if they knew what it took to do it. She wanted to tell the next person that wordlessly threw a stack of paperwork in her face that she was too good for this, that she wasn’t just Hermione Granger—she was<em> Hermione Granger!</em> The Golden Girl, The Brightest Witch of Her Age, one third of the Trio who did the impossible! <em>God Damn Hermione Fucking Straight O’s on Her NEWTS Killed a Snake Man And Looked Good Doing It Granger! </em></p><p>She wouldn’t, but she wanted to.</p><p>Because she wasn’t sure how much more of it she could take. The tedium, the monotony, the <em>disrespect</em>—the “Granger, can you distribute this memo?” “Granger, can you order our lunch?” “Granger, the boss needs his tea—and can you empty the trash while you’re at it?”</p><p>Hermione pinched the bridge of her nose as she opened the door to her cramped and windowless office, folder upon folder in her arms just waiting to be added to the looming pile on her desk; it was to be another thrilling afternoon of filing. Filing filing filing. Always filing. Transcribe this, proofread that, alphabetize, categorize—how about lobotomize? It would be an improvement. Her only excitement occurred when she got to <em>Incendio</em> case files no longer deemed relevant or necessary. What a thrilling life she led. What a trail she blazed. What a—</p><p>She smelt her before she saw her.</p><p>Pine trees, cinnamon, a deceptively delicate hint of rose—the distinct aroma crept up her nose before the door had even shut behind her. Hermione froze, eyes darting to every corner of the tiny room, knowing it wasn’t possible but sure it couldn’t be anyone else—</p><p>Until a dark figure suddenly moved at the outskirts of her vision.</p><p>It leapt at her, slamming her back against the door before she could react, snapping one pale, cold hand over her mouth and pinning her hands over her head with the other, sending her papers flying. Wild black curls obscured her vision as a velvety voice purred into her ear.</p><p>“Miss me, pet?”</p><p>A shiver shot up Hermione’s spine and she whimpered against the hands that held her hostage.</p><p>Invader pulled back to admire shivering prey.</p><p>White, glistening teeth smiled that cheshire smile. Pink tongue darted out to lick perfect, pouty lips. Inky curls framed that beautiful, angular face, and heavy lids blinked slowly over black, shining eyes.</p><p>Hermione was sure, in that moment, that no matter how hard she tried she would never be normal. Because normal people didn’t have secrets like this. Normal people didn't get held against doors by Bellatrix—</p><p>
  <em>”Black.” The witch had insisted on a balmy autumn night in the Forbidden Forest. “It’s Black. That asshole husband of mine is dead and if you’re about to kill me too I’d at least like to make sure the headlines are correct.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I said drop your wand, Lestrange!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“And I’m telling you I will, if you’ll just stop calling me that!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Fine—Black! Drop your wand.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>To Hermione’s surprise the dark witch did. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“See? That wasn’t so difficult, was it Mudblood?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione quickly pocketed the wand and lunged at her then, slamming the woman into the ground and shoving her own wand roughly against her throat. If war had done anything for Hermione, it’d made her more ruthless. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What are you doing here, you miserable bitch?” Ruthless, a little stronger, and a lot less discriminatory with her words. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Aww, the little Mudbaby has claws,” Bellatrix cackled, seemingly unbothered by Hermione gaining the upper hand. “I could ask you the same question. What are you doing out here at this time of night, hmm? I never took you for a rule-breaker.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione didn’t really know how to answer that; she wasn’t sure why she’d wandered into the woods in the first place, other than that the castle walls were stifling and she’d needed some space to think. She’d meant to go sit by the lake, maybe to watch the stars and maybe to cry a little, as she’d done many nights since returning to Hogwarts, but something had made her keep walking, until she’d ended up in the Forbidden Forest and run smack dab into the Dark Lord’s Last and Best Lieutenant herself. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione settled on saying nothing, choosing instead to glare at Bellatrix until the older witch rolled her eyes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Ugh, fine,” Bellatrix acquiesced. “If you must know, I came here because I’m apparently too much of a fucking coward to slit my own wrists. I’ve been trying for weeks now—you’d get a kick out of it if you saw me, I’m sure.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione’s grip faltered. “What?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I figured some beast in this forest could rip me apart and do the work for me—if you or whatever poor excuse for security is wandering around this bloody school didn’t find me first.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I will gladly kill you.” Hermione bit out, fervor renewed, shoving her wand harder into the woman’s neck. She felt Bellatrix’s heart begin to race beneath her tattered robes; she was surprised the witch had one of those. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Lovely. Get to it then.” And when Bellatrix closed her eyes to wait for the killing curse that would end her life, she looked oddly at peace. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But the curse never came. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix waited, and waited, and waited, until she finally let out a frustrated breath and opened her eyes once more to see Hermione staring down at her with an unreadable expression. The young witch’s weight still pinned her to the ground, the wand still dug forcefully into the base of her neck.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Don’t tell me you don’t have it in you, muddie.” Eyes narrowed in challenge. As if she was daring the girl to chug a pint rather than kill a person. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Still, Hermione didn’t move. Couldn’t.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> “C’mon, pet. Where’s that famous Gryffindor temper? Why don’t you look down at your arm for some inspiration?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When Hermione smacked Bellatrix square in the jaw, she drew blood. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The dark witch cackled gleefully. Again. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You evil fucking cow,” Hermione’s whispered viciously, “how dare you show your face here?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yes, yes, exactly. And you’ve got me right where you want me, all that fun stuff. I couldn’t have made it fucking easier for you. Now will you just do it? Kill me. I deserve it, don’t I? Imagine how fantastic you’ll feel.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I—I will!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Then do it!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I said I will! But—“ Hermione swallowed. “But not before you answer some questions.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix let out an agitated groan. “Are you fucking kidding me, Mudblood?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The only response she got was a hand shoved roughly against her windpipe while another tugged her up off the ground and forcefully shoved her down onto a mossy log. She watched Hermione in bewilderment as the Gryffindor plopped down unceremoniously next to her, and…</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And, well, that was how they found themselves sat upon that log for hours, discussing…everything. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione still held the witch at wandpoint. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“How did you survive?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I wasn’t there.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I Imperio’d Rodolphus and made him drink Polyjuice Potion.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I wanted him to die in the most humiliating way possible.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, I mean—why?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I knew we would lose.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“How?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Because the Dark Lord had never tortured me as thoroughly as when he found out what you’d taken from my vault. He was scared. I’d never seen him scared before. Are we done?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“If you’re so eager to die now why didn’t you just let yourself get killed in battle?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I thought I wanted freedom. I’d been smuggling information to McGonagall in exchange for her helping me disappear once it was all over.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What?!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"We were friends, a long time ago.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“WHAT?!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Yes.” Her voice sounded far away.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“She…offered me an escape, an out, when I was still a student. Before I officially took the Dark Mark. Said she could help me. But I didn’t want her help, until I did. And when I asked the old bat about it again she said she’d never taken it back, can you believe that? What an idiot. She told me the offer still stood. So I took it. And I promised her as long as she hid me and kept Narcissa and Draco out of prison, and—and as long she made sure Andromeda was financially secure, since her husband had died and her foolhardy fucking daughter was surely next to go—then I would do this one thing right.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>That had been…unexpected. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>All of it had. Hermione had been surprised at the witch’s candor, at the way she’d answered every question without any hesitation or animosity. Bellatrix hadn’t seemed proud of anything—though she hadn’t seemed entirely remorseful, either. She just seemed empty. Defeated. Alone. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione had to remind herself who she was talking to, lest she begin feel sympathetic. Because even if this woman wasn’t all bad, she was bad enough. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“And now?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lifeless black eyes met Hermione’s. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“The life I’m living is not freedom. And I never deserved freedom. I deserve death.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione should have known better. Should have simply agreed. Should have realized how insane it was to question why a war criminal, why a torturing maniac like Bellatrix Lestrange—Black—deserved to die. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What do you mean, why?” And Hermione thought Bellatrix more rational than herself, for a moment. “I’m Bellatrix fucking Black! I’ve done terrible things. I—“</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Tortured me.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yes. Just because I abandoned the cause in the end doesn’t mean I never believed in it. People rejoiced when they watched me die.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m not sure anyone rejoiced that day. We were too busy mourning.“</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“That’s just as well. No one mourned me. No one will mourn me now. No one even has to know, unless you want the glory. You could feed my body to the Giants and never speak of it to anyone, I don't really care.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I—“</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They both jumped as bushes next to them rustled. Hermione quickly aimed her wand in the direction of the noise and Bellatrix hastily snatched her’s from Hermione’s back pocket, poised to attack. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>(Hermione, later, would wonder why the witch had immediately gone on the defensive if she’d been so willing to die only seconds before).</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But it was only a deer. Nothing magical, nothing mythical. Just a lone foraging doe. It glanced over at them, as if considering the threat they posed, but kept walking. They watched as it continued on through the clearing, beyond the trees, until it was gone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For a moment they were just two people in the woods. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>How far away from the truth that was. How close. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The moment passed. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Right, then. It’s almost sunrise, I’m sure you’re tired, and although this has been a lovely chat,” Bellatrix managed with minimal sarcasm as she tossed her wand back onto the ground, “I’d quite like to die now.” She moved to Hermione, who was still watching the thicket the deer had disappeared into, and grabbed her wrist.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione jumped again at the witch’s touch, startled out of her reverie. Bellatrix’s hand was cold on her skin as she moved Hermione’s wand to point directly at her heart. Her grip was like iron. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Remember, it’s Black.” And she closed her eyes again. Waiting. Anticipating. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione sighed, not believing her own stupidity. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m not going to kill you, Bellatrix.” But she hadn’t pulled her wand away. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Please.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was odd to hear that word from Bellatrix, whose eyes were still screwed shut. Hermione would have laughed at how ridiculous it was, if the circumstances were different. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Please, Hermione.” Her name coming from that terrible mouth, from those quivering lips made her shiver. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>When Bellatrix opened her eyes again they were shining with—no, Hermione didn’t want to think about it. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’ve never said please in my life and now I’m saying it to a Mudblood, you must understand how serious I am.” It was a broken, breathless plea. “Please.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>She tugged on Hermione’s wrist until the Gryffindor was inches away from her face. Hermione peered into black eyes (or were they brown?) and realized she’d never seen Bellatrix look so sane. So human. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Kill me. Kill me, please—”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Tomorrow.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione didn't have a plan. But she knew killing Bellatrix wasn’t part of it; at least tonight. Because for the first time since the war had ended, she wasn’t scared. When faced with the most frightening iteration of terror and evil she could think of, the only thing she felt was a spark of thrill. Anger, maybe, and that was surely part of it. But she felt powerful and in control and almost manic in her daring and she wasn’t about to let that go. Not yet. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Meet me here tomorrow, and maybe I’ll kill you.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What the fuck are you playing at, Mudblood?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Goodnight, Bellatrix.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She wrenched her hand out of the woman’s grasp and headed to the castle without looking back. </em>
</p><p>That was how it started. The two of them, meeting nightly in the Forbidden Forest, a couple of confused and lonely souls inexplicably drawn to each other.</p><p>They talked. Sometimes they argued. Bellatrix continuously begged for death. Hermione never killed her.</p><p>And finally, one night, they fucked against a tree.</p><p>Hermione blamed the bottle of Firewhiskey they’d split. Emboldened by the warmth in her stomach and the fog in her brain, she’d leaned in to admire the birdskull pendant sitting just above the swell of Bellatrix’s breasts. She’d brushed it with her finger, intending to ask where it came from and what it stood for, and what was her whole hand doing there now? Why was it inching further down, why were digits disappearing beneath cloth, why was she suddenly very, very warm—why was Bellatrix not pulling away?</p><p>She didn’t remember much else after that, beyond lips on her and fingers in her and how they soothed the sting of bark scratching against her bare back.</p><p>The next night, though, when she was stone-cold sober, she’d wanted to do it again. So she did. They did.</p><p>And pretty soon Bellatrix was sneaking into the castle so that Hermione’s entire wardrobe wasn’t suspiciously covered in moss stains.</p><p>(That, and it was growing quite inconvenient for Hermione to become wet every time she accidentally snapped a twig underfoot).</p><p>Hermione gave herself permission, that year, to get things out of her system. To be reckless. To cope in the most unsavory of ways. It was exhilarating and dangerous and exactly what she’d needed—if she could survive a monster in her bed, she could survive anything.</p><p>But she knew it wasn’t sustainable in the long run.</p><p>
  <em>“How long do you intend to keep visiting me like this?” She asked one night, between bouts, twirling her fingers in luxurious black locks. Bellatrix sighed contentedly into her chest, where she’d been nestled comfortably, drifting in and out consciousness. She didn’t bother opening her eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“When do you intend on killing me?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione paused. Considering. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Tomorrow.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix yawned. “Then I’ll stop tomorrow.” </em>
</p><p>She didn't kill her. They didn't stop.</p><p>When she graduated, their arrangement had to change.</p><p>Hermione had a half a mind to call it off all together, to stop living her life as if time and consequences did not exist within the comforting illusion and soft-focus reality provided by castle walls, once she’d left them behind. She came close to it, worked herself up before every night they’d spent together, speech prepared and boundaries set until Bellatrix showed up like clockwork with the gall, with the audacity to simply exist as she did. Protests died on her lips at the first wiff of pine, the first sight of corseted curves, at all the effortless ways Bellatrix was Bellatrix, at the thrill that this woman dared to want her, at the sense memory of unspeakable things, and curiously, at the anticipation of the soft arms and not-so-unpleasant companionship in the afterglow.</p><p>And just as Hermione couldn’t bring herself to kill the woman, she couldn’t stop herself from being utterly destroyed by her.</p><p>They’d compromised and made plans to meet monthly in an abandoned cottage Bellatrix had hidden in for a time in the remote English countryside; any more often than that and people would become suspicious. They’d get caught. It was difficult enough for Hermione to sneak out of The Burrow with everyone watching her like a hawk, concerned she would break at any moment. Which was fair, because she often did.</p><p>But she never did with Bellatrix.</p><p>And that was the trouble.</p><p>Hermione never felt more fearless than when she was in the arms of the woman who’d once haunted her nightmares; she never felt further away from that crumbling shell of a girl who barely made it out of the war alive than when she was on her knees at the alter of the devil.</p><p>(On her knees, on her back, on a table, on the floor, against a tree every now and again for old time’s sake).</p><p>If Hermione was being honest with herself, she was keen to see what fewer encounters and more time apart would do, if it would make it easier for her to finally let go. She had thought limiting their meetings would shake her out of her stupor, would uncloud her mind, would make her see the woman for who she was and what she’d done—but instead it had the opposite effect. The more time she spent without Bellatrix the more she craved her; not just her body, but her company.</p><p>And that scared Hermione more than anything.</p><p>In a way, it had worked; she found the bravery she needed to end things in her cowardice. Because Gryffindor or not, Hermione wasn’t brave enough to face the implications of…whatever this was. The feelings. The want. All of it. It wouldn’t do her any good.</p><p>So, three months ago, she'd steeled her resolve and met Bellatrix for a final time. They fucked, they talked, they fucked some more, and when morning came Hermione told her unlikely bedmate that it was over. Bellatrix had taken it exceptionally well, which at the time was odd and unexpected, but now made perfect sense, as Bellatrix apparently either hadn’t understood or just refused to take anything Hermione said seriously, because here she was, in Hermione’s office, with her smell and her lips and her hands that did terrible and <em>wonderful</em> things—</p><p>One of which was still clamped over Hermione’s mouth.</p><p>Hermione suddenly came to her senses and struggled against it, determined not to fall victim to Bellatrix’s witchy wiles. She had made progress, she was learning to live without the woman (that was a lie, but she would repeat it to herself until it wasn’t), she’d even walked over some crunchy leaves the other day without immediately growing warm with the memory of Forbidden things—and now Bellatrix was ruining all of it.</p><p>No. No no no. That wouldn't do.</p><p>The older witch just smiled wickedly, enjoying the war of emotions that was surely playing out in Hermione’s eyes and taking her sweet time silencing the room. Hermione couldn’t help the bubbling warmth behind her belly, but she tried her damndest to ignore it.</p><p>When all the wards were in place and she was sure no one would hear the inevitable tongue lashing that was about to ensue, Bellatrix finally removed her hand.</p><p>Hermione didn't disappoint.</p><p>“What in the actual hell, Bellatrix?” She yelled once her mouth was finally free. “What the ever loving fuck are you thinking, showing up at the <em>Ministry—</em>“</p><p>But Bellatrix just kissed her.</p><p>It was hot, it was needy, it was insistent. It was everything Hermione had tried to forget it was.</p><p>For a moment she gave in, moaning and sucking on a pouty bottom lip, consumed by the desire to fall into the woman, forgetting why she’d ever thought there was anything wrong with this in the first place. She felt Bellatrix grin against her mouth in victory as the kiss was reciprocated, and the dark witch practically growled as she shoved her tongue past Hermione’s whimpering lips.</p><p>Bellatrix’s free hand found Hermione’s shirt collar and dragged her closer, the angle forcing her mouth open further. God, was it good. Had they always fit together so perfectly? Bellatrix had her pinned against the door and they were breast to breast, hip to hip without an inch of space between them. Their tongues slid together in the most luxurious of ways and Hermione moaned into the witch’s mouth again as she felt Bellatrix’s hand move purposefully down her body, squeezing briefly and almost painfully at her shoulder before sliding over her ribs, her waist, then resting possessively on her hip.</p><p>It was intoxicating, the way Bellatrix played her body like it was some type of instrument, the way she invaded her space and made it her own. Made it theirs. It was everything. And Hermione forgot to breathe.</p><p>And maybe Bellatrix did too, because when the both finally came up for air, the woman seemed equally as dazed and starved for oxygen.</p><p>They took a moment, looking each other in the eye as they caught their breath, bodies still pressed together against the door and Bellatrix still holding Hermione’s hands over her head. The woman’s eyes were dilated with lust as she licked her lips. It was all Hermione could do to not claim that mouth again, to not give in to the all encompassing assault on the senses that was the smell and feel and taste and sight of her—</p><p>No! <em>No. </em>This was not supposed to happen, she needed to be strong, to resist.</p><p>But <em>god damn<em> if Bellatrix didn’t know how to make an entrance. </em></em></p><p>Hermione let out an agitated breath. This woman would be the death of her. How appropriate, although the timing was off.</p><p>"Bellatrix,” she managed, breathless but determined, ignoring the tingles she felt in every spot the woman touched her (which felt like everywhere) with Herculean effort. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“You haven’t had two damn minutes alone in over week-and-a-half. It was my only option,” Bellatrix replied matter-of-factly, giving Hermione’s wrists a squeeze and leaning in even further, their noses practically touching.</p><p>Hermione blinked. “You’ve been watching me?”</p><p>“What was I supposed to do?” Bellatrix pouted. “You’ve stood me up twice now. I had to make sure you hadn’t, I don’t know, died or something stupid like that.” She leaned in for a kiss again, as if that was the end of the conversation.</p><p>But Hermione didn’t let her; she turned her cheek before Bellatrix could reach her lips, determined to secure a small victory in the battle against her troublesome desires. Unbothered, Bellatrix just took the opportunity to lick a trail along Hermione’s cheekbone and down to her jaw.</p><p>Victory became…less secure.</p><p>“I didn’t stand you up.” Hermione huffed, breathlessly. “I told you I couldn’t do this anymore.”</p><p>“Yes, well,” Bellatrix murmured against heated skin. “That was all talk.” She began to kiss down Hermione’s neck. “I know you, muddie. You want this.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter what I want—“</p><p>Hermione slammed her head back against the door and gasped as Bellatrix sucked at a particularly sensitive spot just above her shoulder.</p><p>“What were you saying?” the dark witch grinned up at her after a moment, hot breath tickling what was now a blooming hickey.</p><p>“I—I-can’t, Bellatrix.”</p><p>But the witch was already focused on her continued journey south, licking and nipping and sucking, paying particular attention to the girl’s clavicle…</p><p>“Bellatrix.”</p><p>…To the place on her chest where bare skin met shirt-collar...She ripped a button open—</p><p>“Bella!”</p><p>—and finally groaned in frustration at being interrupted again.</p><p>“What?” She looked up to give the girl a withering glare.</p><p>“How did you get in here?” And god damn it all, Hermione would get through this by focusing on semantics. It was how she got through most things. Besides, she really did want to know.</p><p>“Oh my god, it’s not important.”</p><p>“Uh—actually it is,” she insisted, “this is supposed to be the most magically secure place in the country, besides Hogwarts.”</p><p>"I got in there, too.” She let go of Hermione’s hands and tangled her fingers in the Gryffindor’s bushy curls, scraping her nails lightly against the girl’s scalp in an attempt to distract her. She played dirty.</p><p>“Yes, how?” Slightly breathy, but still insistent; Hermione could be proud of that at least.</p><p>“Will you shut up?” And Bellatrix tugged the girl forward by her hair and kissed her firmly, swallowing all sounds of protest.</p><p>NO! NO no no no no—yes, just one more time—NO—but yes—</p><p>“No!” Hermione yelped once she finally managed to pull away (again, Herculean effort). She grabbed Bellatrix’s shoulders and tried to push the witch off of her—which she immediately realized was a terrible plan. The woman just felt warm and soft beneath her palms and it took every ounce of strength Hermione had to not give into her right then. She flexed her fingers in frustration. Settled for lecture. Played her strengths.</p><p>“You’re being reckless! Most people here would kill you on sight.”</p><p>“Can’t kill a ghost, darling.”</p><p>“Bella—“</p><p>“And if they did I wouldn’t mind.”</p><p>“I would,” Hermione confessed before she could stop herself. Bellatrix’s eyes darkened. Fingers twisted in Hermione’s hair.</p><p>“Could’ve fooled me.”</p><p>There it was.</p><p>“What does it matter to you anyway? If I’d mind or not?”</p><p>“It doesn’t.” Bellatrix’s steady gaze faltered for the briefest of moments.</p><p>“Then why are you here?”</p><p>A Cheshire grin. “I don’t know. Why are you grabbing my ass like that?”</p><p>What?</p><p>Sure enough, Hermione realized all too late that her hands had betrayed her. They’d somehow made their way down Bellatrix’s body, obviously completely out of her control, and were now vigorously palming the dark witch’s backside, as if it was the only thing keeping her grounded in reality. Maybe it was.</p><p>“Because…”</p><p>Because she wanted this. Because much as she didn’t, she did. Because as much as she couldn’t, she had to. Because Bellatrix had come looking for her for whatever reason, and there was something really fucking hot about being wanted so bad.</p><p>She sighed a big, long sigh then, and looked up to curse whatever damnable being in the sky was watching over her now. If this was supposed to be a lesson in resisting temptation then she’d failed. She’d failed that night in the Forbidden Forest and she’d failed every night since—even on the nights when it was only her hands and her thoughts keeping her company.</p><p>Bellatrix was always on her mind. Bellatrix was always in her skin.</p><p>Bellatrix was in front of her now.</p><p>“Because it’s a good ass,” Hermione leaned in to murmur against lips, abandoning her resolve and all but admitting defeat.</p><p>Just one more time. This one, last time.</p><p>“Mmm?” Bellatrix grinned in triumph and pulled her closer, lips ghosting but not quite kissing. The energy radiating off her skin was electric.</p><p>“Did you miss it?” Their breath mingled.</p><p>Hermione blushed. She had. She really, really had. She’d missed everything about her. But she’d never give Bellatrix the satisfaction of saying that out loud. She settled instead on digging her fingers into the muscle beneath them, satisfied as Bellatrix’s breath hitched and eyes clouded for the briefest of moments.</p><p>"Mhm. That's what I thought, little one." And when Bellatrix closed the distance between them again, Hermione didn’t resist. She didn’t want to. She’d never wanted to.</p><p>Their mouths met and they began their dance in earnest, as if no time had passed at all.</p><p>And it was Bellatrix who moaned this time, as lips and hips began to move slowly against each other. Hermione’s hands were still on her ass as she pulled Bellatrix closer, grinding into her, while Bellatrix’s fingers tangled in Hermione’s hair again in an effort to keep the girl close. The coiling tension in her abdomen that Hermione’d been steadfastly ignoring suddenly set her entire body alight. Their kisses were desperate and frenzied and wet and so, so good and the mere sound of it made Hermione grow warmer between her legs. She needed more. She was in her office, against her door, in the arms of a monster and she needed more. She was pathetic. She was crazy. She didn’t care.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, Bellatrix shoved her thigh between them, and Hermione let out an embarrassingly loud sound at the newfound friction.</p><p>“Oh, pet, you really missed me,” Bellatrix pulled away and purred, no doubt feeling how soaked Hermione’s knickers were as she worked her thigh up beneath her skirt.</p><p>Again, Hermione found herself embarrassed at how easily and how completely her body responded to Bellatrix—and frustrated at how Bellatrix would play the unaffected pursuant, as if her thigh was not twitching with want as it rubbed up against her, as if the witch was not employing every ounce of her self control to keep from straddling Hermione’s thigh in return.</p><p>Hermione glared but couldn’t manage much more, as she was quite overwhelmed by said thigh, and her hips were already moving of their own accord. Her body kept no secrets.</p><p>“Tell me, darling,” Bellatrix challenged, grinding her thigh even harder up into Hermione’s heat. “Tell me how much you missed me.”</p><p>And Hermione would tell her. That was the game they played. That was the line drawn (and towed, on occasion, but never—not yet—crossed).</p><p>But if she was going down in such a humiliating pile of flames then sod it all to hell, she would take Bellatrix down with her.</p><p>Instead of answering, she slid a hand from where it had been laying claim to Bellatrix’s (firm, incredible, quite fucking perfect) ass and trailed it along the thigh resting between her legs, all the way up until it dipped past her panties and between her soaking lips. And God—she really was so absurdly wet. She let herself enjoy it for a moment, let her fingers graze her clit in exactly the way she wanted Bellatrix to, in exactly the way she knew Bellatrix would not do until she absolutely begged for it, in exactly the way she knew would make Bellatrix reel with possessive fury at being denied first.</p><p>She smirked. She moaned. And she stared straight at Bellatrix as she did so, watching how the witch’s curious black eyes narrowed in confusion, then how they widened in understanding and the predictable selfish indignation, and then…how pupils dilated with raw fucking want as Hermione removed her hand from between her legs to hold it between their mouths.</p><p>Her fingers glistened with her own desire. For Bellatrix. For them.</p><p>She reached forward to rub them on the woman’s bottom lip.</p><p>“This much,” she whispered.</p><p>And Bellatrix’s responding growl was deadly. The dark witch slammed her thigh up into wet heat, leaned in to claim Hermione’s fingers and groaned at the taste of her, never losing eye contact as her tongue worked to suck the digits dry, determined to one up her uncooperative charge. Hermione couldn’t stifle a moan of her own, couldn’t help the rocking of her hips against flexing muscles at the sight of wild eyes staring straight into her, at wicked mouth consuming her in a way that was suddenly not enough.</p><p>Bellatrix grabbed hold of Hermione's wrist, removed her hand, and kissed her squarely on the lips, forcing the girl to taste herself as mouth resumed its assault anew.</p><p>This was their battle; this was their way.</p><p>There was no stopping the storm of them.</p><p>There never was.</p>
