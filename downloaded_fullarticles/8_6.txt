    <p>“Okay, have fun with Grandma.” Remus bounced Teddy in his arms. His mam was hovering nearby. Sirius was waiting in the Uber for him, but he always had such a hard time leaving their baby with other people.</p><p>“Remus John, just go and have fun, will you?” Hope huffed, holding her hands out for Teddy.</p><p>“Right, right.” He handed Teddy over, settling him into her arms. “I love you. Have fun.” He kissed Teddy’s forehead then stepped back. Teddy gave a gurgle and a laugh in response, flapping his hands about. “Call me if you need anything.”</p><p>“Of course we will, now go!” Hope practically shooed Remus out of the door and shut it behind him before he could say another word.</p><p>He laughed, heading for the Uber that was parked out front. They were headed to the BDSM club for a drag show. Somehow, Sirius had never got him to one before, and they had jumped at the chance to go when the club had first advertised it. Lily was also going to be joining them, but they were going to meet her there.</p><p>Slipping into the car, Remus looked back at his mam’s house once more before closing the door. “Okay, let’s go then.”</p><p>Sirius grinned over at him, looking bemused. “Took you long enough.”</p><p>“Sorry, you know how I hate leaving Teddy anywhere.” Remus kissed them on the cheek.</p><p>“I know I know. I would be just as bad, only I figure your mam wouldn’t approve of the outfit.” Sirius gestured vaguely to themselves. They had a ripped band shirt on, with their favourite harness over top. They also had their skinniest, most ripped up jeans on, with a leather garter strapped around one thigh. “I’ve never had the <em> you’re not going out like that </em> speech before.”</p><p>“I mean, she might approve but I don’t want to discuss <em> why </em> you’re dressed like this.” Remus put a hand on their thigh, over the garter.</p><p>Sirius snickered. “Probably true, though I'd do anything to see you try and explain a BDSM club to your mam.”</p><p>“Oh Christ, god no.” He shook his head.</p><p>“Ha, I can dream.” They sighed wistfully, looking out of the window.</p><p>“Yes, dream all you want, princess, but it’s not happening.”</p><p>They grinned over at him. “At least I have tonight. I’m excited, I heard there’s a Drag King too.”</p><p>“That’s cool, I’m excited. I know you are to finally get me to a drag show.” Remus kissed their jaw then glanced out the window.</p><p>“I am. I can’t believe we haven’t gone until now.”</p><p>“I know, it took you long enough to make this happen.”</p><p>Sirius rolled their eyes, squeezing their hand on his knee. “Rude. You didn’t exactly volunteer, huh?”</p><p>Remus chuckled. “Well, it’s not that I’m against it, but I always found others things more interesting.”</p><p>“True I suppose. No escaping tonight though. I guarantee you’ll enjoy it.”</p><p>“I know I’ll enjoy it.” He gave their thigh a squeeze before watching the city pass by in the window.</p><p>Soon enough they were at the club. Marlene, Dorcas, and Lily were all waiting outside for them. James had refused to join them because he drew the line at sex clubs, apparently. It was an open night, and Remus had learned that the crowd was fairly tame on those nights, but he understood James’ hesitance.</p><p>“Hi you guys.” Remus hugged Lily. “Ready, Lils?”</p><p>“Ready. I haven’t seen a good show in years.” She hugged him back tightly, smiling.</p><p>“I feel obliged to shout <em> oi oi, troops </em>in Potter’s absence, but I think it’d make me queasy,” Marlene said, looking thoughtful as she pulled back from hugging Sirius.</p><p>“Please babe, don’t.” Dorcas scoffed. “Let’s go in, shall we?”</p><p>“Yes, let’s.” Remus laughed before he started to lead them in. “How is James doing tonight?”</p><p>“Oh he’s fine, he and Harry are having the time of their lives, I’m sure!” Lily waved a hand, grinning.</p><p>“No doubt.” He held the door open, swatting Sirius on the bottom when they walked through.</p><p>“Oi!” They shrieked, grinning though. Lily just shook her head and carried on, Marlene and Dorcas chuckling.</p><p>Remus laughed, taking their hand as they walked through. “Oi yourself.”</p><p>“You’re the one who slapped me,” Sirius retorted, kissing his knuckles as they walked in. It was definitely a more <em> normal </em> crowd than usual, but some of the regulars were there.</p><p>He snickered, leaning into them. “As if you didn’t want that.”</p><p>Sirius gave him a scandalised look. “<em> Remus. </em> What ever gave you that idea?”</p><p>“Ha!” He wrapped an arm around their waist as they looked for somewhere to sit.</p><p>“Ah! Here!! ‘Scuse me, ‘scuse me!” Marlene hustled her way through the crowd to a booth. </p><p>“Babe, relax.” Dorcas followed after her as the rest of the group did the same.</p><p>Sirius chuckled as they slid into the booth, Marlene on one side with a space next to them for Remus. “Marly, you are next-level tonight. Please don’t tell me Dorky has a remote of some kind.”</p><p>“Jesus, really?” Lily made a face as they settled into the booth.</p><p>“Dorky, do you?” Remus furrowed his brow.</p><p>“No! You all are <em> sick </em>.” She was smirking as she spoke.</p><p>“I would say I had no idea, but really, I do. I’m not James, thankfully. Poor thing is so oblivious.”</p><p>“Poor Prongs.” Remus snickered as a waitress came over to their table.</p><p>Dorcas cleared her throat, giving the table a pointed look before turning to her. “Hi love, a beer and a Pretty Pet, please?”</p><p>“Whiskey neat and cranberry and vodka, please and thanks. Lily?” He looked over to her.</p><p>“What on earth is a Pretty Pet?” She raised an eyebrow at Marlene.</p><p>“It’s pink and delicious, Lily. Taste like strawberries.”</p><p>Lily nodded. “Okay, I’ll try that.”</p><p>The waitress chuckled before noting down their order. “Coming right up.”</p><p>Remus put his arm around Sirius and kissed them on the cheek. “So, what do you think Lily?”</p><p>“This is definitely an interesting place,” Lily replied, grinning.</p><p>“It’s very tame tonight.” Dorcas chuckled. “Poor Potter would still have some type of freak out over it.”</p><p>Remus snorted a laugh, thinking about James at the club.</p><p>“Oh yeah, he’d die.” Sirius grinned, leaning their head on Remus’ shoulder as they looked around the room.</p><p>“When I was getting ready to go out, he refused to even talk about where I was going. He put his hands over Harry’s ears when he asked me a question about it.” She shook her head.</p><p>“Oh god.” Remus looked over at Sirius. “At least I don’t do that.”</p><p>Sirius laughed, throwing their head back. “You don’t, that’s true.”</p><p>“Remus, is this really your first show?” Lily questioned him as the waitress appeared with their drinks.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m a bad bi.” Remus nudged Sirius before reaching out for their drinks.</p><p>Marlene grinned, waggling her eyebrows in Remus’ direction. “Well, we’re going to pop your drag cherry, Moony.”</p><p>“I’m very excited. Sirius hasn’t shut up about it for days.”</p><p>Sirius rolled their eyes as they took a sip of their drink. “I have been talking a normal amount about upcoming plans thank you very much.”</p><p>“Sure, princess, normal amount,” he muttered before taking a sip of his drink.</p><p>They gave him the sweetest smile, squeezing their hand high up his thigh.</p><p>Lily raised an eyebrow. It occurred to Remus at that moment she probably never heard him call Sirius princess before. “Sure, Sirius. I believe that…”</p><p>Sirius wriggled in their seat, grinning at him. Dorcas chuckled, looking back to the stage. “Okay, I think we’re starting soon.”</p><p>Remus nodded as the lighting started to change. He relaxed into Sirius as Tom appeared on the stage to announce the first performer, Misty Harwich. This was going to be fun.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Sirius finished their drink, over the moon with how the night was going. It was fantastic, and having the best time. Remus seemed to really enjoy the performers. Sirius’ favourite was a Drag King called Prince Alarming, who performed I Believe in a Thing Called Love.</p><p>They had their arm around Remus’ waist, and head on his shoulder. “You having fun, Daddy?” They murmured in his ear.</p><p>“So much princess.” He kissed them on the cheek. “This is great. I really liked Misty Harwich, she was fantastic.”</p><p>“Mhmm. She was great. And Poppy, I loved her too. I want to steal some of her dance moves.”</p><p>“Yes! You really should. You seemed to really like Prince Alarming best.” He set his glass down.</p><p>“I did. He was fantastic, and so hot.”</p><p>Remus chuckled and agreed as Lily leaned over him. “I think I’m going to head home. This was so much fun but it seems like time to get going.” She grinned.</p><p>“Alright! We’re staying I think?” Marlene grinned, looking to Dorcas.</p><p>Sirius leaned over and hugged Lily. “Alright Lils, see you soon.”</p><p>“Are you good to drive?” Remus asked before hugging her as well.</p><p>“Ah no, I’m going to get an Uber Moony.”</p><p>Sirius kissed his shoulder. “Shall we stay?”</p><p>“All right, be safe, Lily.” He nodded as she said goodbye to the girls. “We can stay, sure, princess.”</p><p>“If you want. Or we can go home?”</p><p>“Let’s stay.”</p><p>Dorcas hugged Lily before letting her go through the crowd. “Let me know when you’re home Lily!”</p><p>“You two are <em> such </em> Doms.” Marlene stood up from her seat.</p><p>“I have no idea what you mean, pet,” Dorcas said, looking up at Marly. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“I was just stretching. Can I get you a drink?”</p><p>“Mm yes. A beer and a Pretty Pet, love.” She pulled her wallet out and handed Marlene some money.</p><p>“Do you need anything, princess?” Remus turned to Sirius.</p><p>“Mm, I don’t mind. Should we have another drink?”</p><p>Remus nodded before kissing them softly on the lips. “I’ll be right back.”</p><p>“Alright, love you.” Sirius smiled, watching him stand up. Dorcas watched Marlene walk away before looking back towards Sirius.</p><p>“Love you too.” Remus grinned before going off towards the bar with Marly.</p><p>“Good night, Sirius?”</p><p>“Mhmm. I really liked the performers. Prince Alarming especially.”</p><p>“He was brilliant.” She nodded. “How’s it feel to be out without the baby?”</p><p>“Wild. But wonderful? Obviously itching to have him back, but a nice night out is good.”</p><p>Dorcas smiled at them. “Yeah, I’m sure.”</p><p>Sirius grinned luridly. “Maybe we might take advantage of a baby-free night.”</p><p>“I’m sure you will.”</p><p>“And I feel like Marly will need a little reigning in tonight?” Sirius looked over to the bar where Marly was showing her bra to the bartender.</p><p>Dorcas peered over at her as well. “She’s off the wall today, just really excited about the show I think.” She waved a hand as Marly stripped her shirt off and handed it to Remus who rolled his eyes.</p><p>Sirius chuckled. “Yeah, she is, isn't she?”</p><p>Marlene bounced back over, throwing herself into the seat. “Dorky, I showed Tom my new nipple bar!”</p><p>“Oh yeah? What’d he say?” Dorcas put an arm around her before taking the drinks to set them on the table.</p><p>Remus joined them, Marlene’s shirt over his arm. “It’s a good thing I’m used to Marlene ripping her shirt off at a moment's notice.”</p><p>Sirius shuffled up, laughing. “It’s a regular occurrence.”</p><p>“He liked it! Duh.”</p><p>“Of course he did, pet.”</p><p>Remus sat next to Sirius, handing them their cranberry vodka. They snuggled right up to him, kissing his shoulder.</p><p>“Do you think anyone is scening tonight?”</p><p>“Probably.” He folded Marlene’s shirt and set it on the table. “Wanna go walk around and see what’s going on?”</p><p>“Can we?” Sirius grinned. They loved looking around and watching everything that was going on.</p><p>“Sure, princess, whatever you want.” He squeezed their thigh.</p><p>Marlene snorted from across the table. “Ugh, you two are so cute.”</p><p>“If I told Marlene <em>whatever</em> <em>you want</em>, we’d all be in trouble.”</p><p>Remus snickered. “The world would collapse if you told her that. Plus, Sirius knows it’s not <em> whatever </em> they want. It’s within reason, right princess?”</p><p>Sirius gave him the most innocent expression. “Of course Daddy.”</p><p>“Well, you don’t want to get punished.” He stood up and held out a hand.</p><p>“Absolutely not.” Sirius smiled over at Marlene, who knew full well how much of a brat they were, before taking Remus’ hand and letting him pull them up.</p><p>“Brats are weird,” Dorcas said with a laugh.</p><p>Sirius heard Marlene chuckle too. “Well luckily for you ma’am, I’m the most obedient pet in the world.”</p><p>“Really, that’s just boring,” Remus whispered as he led Sirius along.</p><p>“I know,” Sirius murmured, wrapping their arm around his waist. “Daddy likes me misbehaving.”</p><p>“To a point.”</p><p>They gave him a faux-innocent wide eyed look. “Oh yeah?”</p><p>He leaned in close, ghosting his lips over their jaw as his hand trailed down their side. “You know exactly, princess.”</p><p>Sirius shuddered, biting their lip. “Ah, don’t tickle me. Please.”</p><p>“You haven’t done anything wrong, right? So, I won’t.”</p><p>“No, I haven’t, I promise.”</p><p>Remus kissed them on the temple. “Good princess, let’s see what’s going on.”</p><p>“Maybe we’ll see something we like.”</p><p>“Maybe.” He grinned. “Are you having a good night so far?”</p><p>“Mhmm. I really loved the drag. Are you having a good time?”</p><p>He led them past the dance floor. “I’m having the best time, always do with you. The show was fantastic, we’ll have to go to another.”</p><p>“Yes, I’ve got you addicted now.” Sirius chuckled, leaning in to kiss his cheek.</p><p>Remus laughed, stopping as they came upon some rope suspension. “Mmm, yes.”</p><p>Sirius bit their lip, watching the way they tied the ropes. They didn’t do rope suspension often, as it was fairly strenuous, but Sirius loved it. As did Remus. “Oh… that is pretty.”</p><p>Remus nodded next to them, watching for a while. “Very pretty. I bet I could do that.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? I bet you could ask her for tips…”</p><p>“Yeah, let’s. Then maybe we could go home?” He smirked at Sirius.</p><p>Like they could ever resist that smirk. “Maybe.”</p>
