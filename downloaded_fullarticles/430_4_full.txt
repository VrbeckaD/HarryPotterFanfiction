    <p>Ginny Weasley was standing over a Death Eater's corpse. At some point during the battle she has lost count of how many lives she took, a part of her didn't care and she couldn't really deal with the other part; the part that wanted to throw up and cry in a corner somewhere. She's been keeping everything in check for over a year, not feeling anything, trying to survive, making sure that her friends stayed alive and trying to keep Hogwarts from burning to the ground.</p><p>Glancing up from the dead body she could see her best friend Neville in the distance fighting two of them, barely hanging on trying to duck and fire spells at both of them. She knew he could handle it, they made sure of it. They've been training, they were all ready but Ginny couldn't help but worry because Neville didn't want to cross the line. He didn't want to kill any of them, he believed they were misled. There's been arguments among the DA about the right and wrong of it all. And Ginny just wanted to save her loved ones no matter what she had to do.</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly. Fred. She couldn't save him, she felt suffocating sadness trying to overwhelm her but she had to push it down, she couldn't stop and process anything that was happening; she had to be all action and logic. She couldn't take a moment to think about the fact that she'd just seen Ron for the first time in a year and their reunion included witnessing their brother's death. They both knew they couldn't sit, cry, and deal with the trauma; they had to keep going. That was the hardest part; wanting to give up, wanting to just lie down and die but not being able to because people depended on you, because you had to be strong even though nothing seemed to matter anymore. And it was really messed up that all she wanted was to immediately hug Ron and thank the heavens he was okay but instead they had to watch their brother take his last breath. Ginny felt panic beginning to settle in again as she though of Fred, she knew she was about to lose herself in a dark bottomless pit if she didn't control her thoughts and emotions, she had to set everything aside once again, she had to keep fighting; she had to make sure his death meant something.</p><p>Behind the wall next to Neville she spotted a Death Eater sneaking up on him ready to fire a curse. Her body sprung into action as she sprinted towards him, jumping over bodies and leaping over bricks as she raised her wand with perfect aim.</p><p>"Reducto!"</p><p>The Death Eater went flying back from the force of the spell, a hole appearing in his chest where his heart used to be. Neville turned around at her voice, sweat dripping down his face. They nodded at each other once she reached him as they both started to fight the Death Eaters in front of them.</p><p>"Ginny! Neville!" They were both too busy fighting the two scumbags to turn towards Luna's voice, but Ginny knew something was wrong. Luna rarely, if ever, raised her voice. She let out a grunt in frustration as she fought; until finally disarming him and quickly using a stunning spell before turning to Luna she was covered in blood the color mixing morbidly with her dirty blonde hair.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>She could see Neville was still fighting his guy from her peripheral vision.</p><p>"I tried to stop them...but they got them- two second years! I was supposed to protect them...I tried Ginny."</p><p><em>Shit</em>. Knowing that Neville finally dealt with the Death Eater, she grabbed both his arm and Luna's and dragged them running until they crouched behind a big brick that has fallen from one of the towers.</p><p>"Who took them?" Ginny immediately asked.</p><p>"I don't know. They were wearing masks."</p><p>"What are we going to do? We can't leave in the middle of battle." Neville said looking at her, waiting for her agreement.</p><p>He was right. They were under their protection, but Ginny had to be logical here. They were most likely dead and it wasn't like the first time they had lost kids. People needed them here, it was war and their place was in the middle of it. For a minute Ginny couldn't believe her thoughts, she was knowingly giving up on two kids. She knew they were in danger and they might already be dead or they were trying to recruit them, she knew it wasn't the right thing to do. But it was the tactical and tough decision that she had to make.</p><p>"They're probably dead."</p><p>"Ginny!" Luna protested instantly. "I know it's not the smartest decision to look for them, but I was in charge of them Gin. I can't just-" She paused, voice breaking, before she looked her in the eyes. "I'll look for them. With or without you."</p><p><em>Damn it, Luna</em>. She thought to herself.</p><p>"Do you know where they took them?"</p><p>"Before I passed out, I saw them making their way to the Forbidden Forest." Her eyes suddenly glazed over and Ginny knew she was having one of her visions, or senses as she sometimes referred to them.</p><p>A figure suddenly dropped down next to them, it was Padma and she looked at them in panic.</p><p>"I can't find Parvati!" She cried. "I don't know what happened, I was fighting right next to her, and I turned around and she...oh god I-"</p><p>"Hey hey, Padma, take a breath." Neville raised a palm to her shoulder calmly. "We'll find her, okay? Just try and breathe."</p><p>Padma tried to nod but she was visibly shaking.</p><p>"Okay...right. She's fine. We'll find her." It really felt as if she was trying to convince herself, but in that moment it was as if they all had the same thought, shared the same feeling. It was that gut feeling that you get that told you something was wrong, someone was dead. And with that, Ginny has made a decision.</p><p>"Alright, Neville, you go with Padma and try to keep track of all DA members." She turned to Luna. "You're with me."</p><p>Padma sniffled. "Where are you going?"</p><p>"To look for two second years, they were taken."</p><p>"That's terrible, but Ginny, we need you here. Everyone needs to be here right now." Padma said, her shaking lessened slightly.</p><p>"Yeah, Ginny, I really hate to say this, but are we sure this is the best plan?"</p><p>"I can't let Luna go alone...and she's right. They are our responsibility." She hated how jaded they all became. They saw so many kids tortured and killed that it was in debate right then whether it was smart to leave and save them or not. Ginny felt so sick that for a second she thought she was actually going to throw up. They had to find them and they had to be alive. They just had to.</p><p>"Hell, I know- I know. Alright, I'm going with you then."</p><p>"No, you're not, the three of us can't go, you're needed here and Padma needs you-"</p><p>"I'll be fine." She interrupted with a shaking breath.</p><p>"Oh god, Ginny, I feel them. "Luna breathed from beside her, her eyes have gone so cloudy they were almost just white."No no no, they're in so much pain. We have to go now!" Luna raised a hand to her mouth trying to silent her sob as she finally came back to herself, eyes natural grey again.</p><p>"Okay, " Ginny looked quickly to Neville and Padma putting a hand on each of their shoulders. "Just stick together and we'll be back as soon as we can."</p><p>They all stood up and eyed each other in worry, it was not goodbye; they would meet again, they've been through way too much not to.</p><p>Neville stepped towards Ginny and Luna and threw his arms around them, holding them tight. "Be careful, <em>please</em>."</p><p>"You too." Luna mumbled.</p><p>"Uh...Nev, you should probably let go now." Ginny told him after a moment only half teasing, she didn't necessarily want to end the hug, but they were literally surrounded by chaos and people falling to their death. Ginny still made sure to smile at him when he finally pulled back.</p><p>She turned to Padma."I hope you find your sister."</p><p>"Me too. I will." She uttered with conviction.</p><p>"Be safe, alright?" They both nodded their heads in answer.</p><p>And with that Ginny and Luna took off, leaving Hogwarts grounds and marching straight into the Forbidden Forest.</p>
<hr/><p>Ginny and Luna were trying to to be as quiet as they can, they had to be stealthy, fast, and silent. Luna was leading the way based on what she was sensing and Ginny was trying to form a plan-any kind of plan that she can put into action once they find them. If they find them. They had to take their time and be strategic about whatever situation they might be walking into.</p><p>Ginny's steps came to a halt as she raised an arm to stop Luna in her tracks. She heard something just then or maybe she felt it.</p><p>"Did you hear that?"</p><p>"No, what do you hear?"</p><p>"Let's hope I'm just being paranoid." She answered as they started to walk again.</p><p>But Ginny knew she wasn't being paranoid. She felt something and then a wave of realization hit her. Voldemort was here. She could feel him. Ever since the diary she always had these moments as if she could feel him watching her, or sense that he was near. And right then it was stronger than ever. And if Voldemort were there, she wondered if Harry were too, Ginny felt a sharp pang of fear and dread for him that she had to quickly push deep down to focus on the mission. Even though she wasn't sure, she wanted to tell Luna to stop and go back and let her find the second years. Ginny wanted to stay so she could face Voldemort, finally confront him and help Harry defeat him, but she knew Luna wouldn't leave her.</p><p>"It's that way." Luna suddenly whispered, her voice so soft and airy, Ginny knew she was lost in her own mind, she didn't have to see her eyes to know they have probably gone white.</p><p>As they approached the area Luna pointed out, Ginny could hear voices laughing and then a second later there were screams. They were crying out in pain and Ginny felt her stomach hurt as she and Luna sped up until they were close enough to hide behind a tree and observe the scene.</p><p>Ginny quickly evaluated the situation. Only two Death Eaters, thankfully. Then her eyes zoned in on the two kids tied against the tree and she recognized them immediately. Isaac and Allison. When she looked them over, it felt as if all air left her body. Aside from the tears and sheer pain on their faces. Their clothes were ripped. Oh god no no no not that. Her mind was screaming at her to just run in and get them, her body was dying to go in for the kill; but they had to wait and assess their next course of action.</p><p>Before Ginny could turn around to Luna, a child emerged suddenly from behind one of the Death Eaters. She couldn't have been more than twelve and while she had the body of child, she didn't carry herself like one. She couldn't believe that these two pieces of shit let that kid watch. Ginny tried to take a better look As the little girl walked closer and she could somewhat see her face and eyes; they were calm, no fear whatsoever. She looked almost demonic.</p><p>"Well, that was a waste of my time." The girl looked at the two men with boredom. "Now that you've had your fun. Please go away, so I can enjoy killing them in peace."</p><p>Luna let out a small gasp from beside her, Ginny's eyes were wide in shock. She felt Luna take a step forward before she grabbed her and pulled her back with a shake of her head that told her they needed to think first. She knew that Voldemort and Death Eaters were recruiting kids, but she had never actually seen one. The two men looked at the child with respect, almost fear.</p><p>"You can, of course, have the kill, " One of them responded. "But we have orders to never leave your side, Akkila."</p><p>Akkila. Akkila Carrow. Ginny and Luna shared a look, of course they've heard of her and how ruthless she was but the rumours never mentioned she was a bloody twelve year old. Nobody knew why she never joined the Carrows at Hogwarts.</p><p>"I don't care what orders you've been given. When I tell you to leave. You leave." Her voice was ice cold and Ginny felt a shiver run through her.</p><p>"Okay so, you'll take the one on the right and I'll take the left." She whispered to Luna.</p><p>"And Akkila?"</p><p>"Stunning spells only." She didn't want to think about how awful and sinister that little girl was. They weren't going to kill her.</p><p>"Oh, Ginny."Luna sighed and when Ginny looked at her, her eyes were cloudy yet again.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"I don't think this going to end well."</p><p>
  <em>Damn it, Luna.</em>
</p><p>"Did you...see or feel something?"</p><p>Her gaze shot up to Ginny's. "It doesn't matter. We don't have a choice." Her voice was small and sad.</p><p>She didn't have time to dissect that statement.</p><p>"How dare you disobey me?"</p><p>Ginny and Luna turned back to watch Akkila raise her wand and with no hesitation she fired the Killing Curse.</p><p>She could see that Akkila was too far gone. And Ginny wasn't surprised given who she was and how she was raised, but that didn't stop the disgust and disbelief at the sight in front of her. There was only Akkila and one Death Eater left, getting rid of them was going to be easy.</p><p>"Gin."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Remember what I told you."</p><p><em>Really, Luna?</em> Ginny thought. <em>You expect me to remember everything you've ever told me?</em></p><p>"You have to give me more than that, L."</p><p>"You'll know."</p><p>Giving her a confused look. "I don't think we have time for riddles."</p><p>"We were in the library."</p><p>"Bloody hell! Which time!?" She whisper-shouted.</p><p>Luna looked at her then, something about her eyes made Ginny pause as she felt Luna's hand on her shoulder. "You know."</p><p>And it was as if she transferred the exact memory into Ginny's mind. She remembered exactly which time she was talking about. They had been sitting in the Library late one night studying; but Luna had felt bad all day even if she were trying not to show it. Some students had been calling her names and they were in the middle of pulling a very cruel prank, when Ginny had intervened for the third time that week. Ginny had stayed with her after it happened and had tried everything to cheer her up. She had cracked jokes and had told her a few hilarious Fred and George stories; but nothing'd worked. So Ginny had decided to just sit with her in silence, until she had suddenly spoken up.</p><p>
  <em>"You're the best friend anybody could ever ask for, Ginny Weasley." She had stated staring out of the Library's window.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ginny smiled. "Aw! You're a pretty great friend too, L."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Luna looked at her with a grin. "Oh! L ...I like that."</em>
</p><p>Ginny smiled softly at the memory, but looked at Luna in confusion. "Why that memory?"</p><p>It was a stupid question, deep down Ginny knew why. But there was no way she was going to let whatever was about to happen to actually happen.</p><p>"You're my best friend, Ginny."</p><p>"Luna-"</p><p>But she didn't get to finish. Luna sat up and looked down at her. "It's time."</p><p>Ginny nodded, standing up as well, making sure that all her daggers were in place and slowly they walked around the tree they were hiding behind. Without warning, Luna charged for Akkila aiming her wand.</p><p>"Stupefy!"</p><p>Ginny didn't wait to see if it hit the target, she ran towards the other Death Eater.</p><p>He deflected her attempt trying to stun him and fired back his own. She could hear Luna and Akkila sparring beside her. Curses were being fired in every direction.</p><p>"Expelliarmus!" He yelled, smirking at her because he knew she didn't expect him to use that spell. Ginny groaned in frustration when it hit her and she felt her wand flying out of her hand.</p><p>Acting quickly not waiting for her wand to reach him, she ran forward, her body slid across the ground once she was close enough she kicked her leg hard against his shin; successfully tripping him, his wand falling from his hand. Both of their wands were on the ground, Ginny immediately went for her wand, throwing her body towards it but he grabbed her ankle and dragged her back before flipping her around.</p><p>"Bitch!"</p><p>"Right back at ya." She growled, pulling her knee up and kicking him right in the balls. He glowered in pain, instantly releasing her.</p><p>Pushing him back, she moved to stand and he readily followed. Both leaving their wands behind, Ginny took a quick second to glance at Luna, she didn't need any help she was gracefully ducking and dodging as she shot a spell after spell at Akkila. She checked the two second years still tied to the tree and unconscious.</p><p>Pulling her attention back to her enemy, he was grinning before he advanced on her with a punch, she ducked, moving a step to the side twirling around until she was behind him. She raised her right knee and as hard as she could kicked him in the spine, he yelled out; dropping to his knees. Ginny quickly grabbed his hair and pulled; with her other hand extracted the dagger she kept on her right hip, lifting her arm back; she swung it back down around to his neck and slit his throat. Blood splattered onto her hand and the ground. She let his body go and it hit the ground with a thump.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>She turned around to see her friend tied to a huge tree the branches and roots wrapping themselves around her body tightly.</p><p>Ginny silently searched around for her wand, but sadly she wasn't that lucky. Akkila's head whipped around in her direction smiling maniacally.</p><p>"Oh no. You killed one of my own." She said monotonously. "I'll have to kill you now...well, I was going to kill you anyway."</p><p>Ginny has spotted her wand and as discreetly as possible she made a step towards it. But it was too late, Akkila's snake eyes caught it.</p><p>"Accio Wand!"</p><p>Both her wand and the dead Death Eater's flew right into her tiny hands.</p><p>"Look at that! I've got all of your wands." She pouted mockingly. "And I'm a twelve year old. This is embarrassing."</p><p>She pocketed two of the wands, leaving two; one in each hand.</p><p>"Listen, you don't want to do this, please." Ginny tried feebly; she knew it was no use but she didn't want to hurt her.</p><p>"But I do."</p><p>"You're very young and confused, it's not your fault...you just need help."</p><p>Akkila stared at Ginny incredulously. "Are you being serious? I'm about to kill both of you and this is your argument?"</p><p>"Listen, there's hope for you, you don't have to be like your family. You have a choice."</p><p>"Don't talk about my family." She snarled. "Don't talk to me like you know me."</p><p>"You're right, I don't. But I do know what it is like to feel like you can't control your life, to be used as just a pawn in someone else's plans."</p><p>"Oh, do you now?"</p><p>"Different circumstances, but yes. I bet everything's been decided for you since you came into this world; you never had a choice. But you have one now. You can make the right one."</p><p>Akkila laughed, the sound sadistic and unnatural. "You're funny, Weasley."</p><p>Ginny's shock must have shown on her face.</p><p>"Why are you so surprised? Of course I know who you are; after all, we were counting on you trying to find these weaklings." She tilted her head in Allison and Isaac's direction.</p><p>"You're deeply despised in my world. Your entire family, actually, is on my list of people I want to kill before the end of the night."</p><p>She went too far.</p><p>"Careful." Ginny's voice was deadly calm, but the warning was more than clear in her tone.</p><p>"Ooh, I'm so scared." She lifted her head to the sky. "Help me, Almighty God! Ginny Weasley; the girl who couldn't fight a <em>diary</em> is threatening <em>me</em>."</p><p>Ginny's heart was beating wildly in her chest, she was about to lose her temper. She didn't want to think about how that little brat acquired this information, she didn't want to think about Death Eaters having information on her and her family. She wanted to focus on her anger.</p><p>"You <em>should</em> be scared." Luna spoke suddenly, her voice cutting through the tension in the air.</p><p>Akkila's eyes never left Ginny as she responded to Luna." You know, I have no idea why you're still alive, Freak."</p><p>"Don't call her that."</p><p>"I'll do far more than just call her a Freak." She replied with a scoff, talking to Ginny as she took a step closer in Luna's direction, one of the wand pointed at her."I was going to make you kill her yourself, but I know for a fact that you know how to resist the Imperius curse. So...I'll just settle for you watching me have all the fun!"</p><p>"Crucio!"</p><p>Luna's screams instantly pierced their ears.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>But before Ginny could move the curse was flipped on her, she immediately fell writhing on the ground in excruciating pain; she's been through this enough times but it never got easier, nothing could ever prepare you for a pain that you can feel in every single bone in your body as if they were all breaking at the same time over and over again. It was as if somebody setting you on fire from the inside. Everything just burned. While she couldn't get used to it, Ginny has learned to try and push through it; she whimpered, trying to move her head.</p><p>"Please stop, don't...make me." She couldn't even hear her own voice through her sharp gasps, her lungs letting out a scream.</p><p>She couldn't think, she tried to move her body but she couldn't muster enough energy, the pain was blinding.</p><p>"Sadly, I'm not even sure if you can hear me right now, but I'm going to kill your friend."</p><p>Somehow Ginny got herself to look up, grunting loudly. Through her blurred vision, she could make out Akkila raising the other wand towards Luna; even though she couldn't focus on her, she could tell she was looking at her, trying to tell her it was okay.</p><p>Ginny wasn't going to lose anyone else, losing her brother and best friend on the same day was just not an option. There had to be a way, through her agony she prayed for a miracle, she prayed for a sliver of strength to get her to move.</p><p>Akkila's wand was at the ready.</p><p>Ginny was fighting her body, pushing through the pain. Achingly slow she tried to reach for her dagger.</p><p>Akkila was smiling at Luna in triumph.</p><p>"Ple-please don't!"</p><p>Ginny was groaning and grunting trying to cling onto the dagger once she was able to hold it.</p><p>"Avada-"</p><p>"NO!" She shrieked, swinging her arm back before throwing the dagger at Akkila with all the power she has left.</p><p>The pain suddenly stopped and Ginny gasped in relief, breathing harshly, she blinked, there were dots swimming in her vision, her heart was beating way too fast; it felt like she was about to pass out and maybe she did because a while later she began to feel her surroundings again.</p><p>"Ginny."</p><p>She tiredly lifted her head at her friend's voice; who was now kneeling beside her and sighed in relief. She was alive. The tree must have let her go after Akkila stopped.</p><p>"Wa - wait, is she...?"</p><p>Luna didn't meet her eyes. "Yes."</p><p>She tried to stand up, but her legs gave out from under her.</p><p>"Ginny, you need a minute, you were under the Cruciatus for a while."</p><p>"Help me to her."</p><p>She threw her arm around Luna's shoulder; while Luna wrapped hers around Ginny's waist. Together they stumbled their way over till they reached her body. She was scared to look down, she didn't want to see it, but she couldn't help it; she had to see for herself. Her eyes finally moved to the body, the dagger has struck her on the forehead; her eyes were staring up unseeing. She was dead.</p><p>She has just killed a kid.</p><p>She let go of Luna, moving quickly to a nearby tree and emptying her stomach. She didn't know how long she sat by the tree vomiting; she couldn't process what just happened, it was like remembering a memory that you didn't live. <em>I had no choice</em>. She kept repeating the words in her mind, hoping the words would calm her somehow, but she knew nothing would've helped her.<em> I had no choice</em>. <em>Breathe breathe breathe</em>. She couldn't even focus on the fact that her body was weeping in pain. She was mentally and physically drained. <em>Breathe breathe breathe.</em></p><p>"Ginny."</p><p>She directed her gaze in the voice's direction, it was Allison and beside her stood Isaac and Luna. They were okay, they were alive.<em> Focus on that</em>, She thought to herself.</p><p>Her mind has slowly started to clear, she took a deep breath, before sluggishly standing up. "We need to go back."</p><p>They all quietly agreed; making their way through the Forest. She appreciated the silence but it was too dark, she wished they could use Lumos but they couldn't risk someone seeing them.</p><p>That was when she felt it again. Voldemort.</p><p>As they kept walking, it intensified, she wondered why Luna didn't say anything. Did she even sense anything. Or was it just Ginny because she was connected to Voldemort somehow. Peering ahead she thought she saw a few figures in the distance; the shapes got clearer as they got closer.</p><p>"Do you guys see that?" Isaac asked from behind her.</p><p>But Ginny didn't respond, because the one thing that was flashing in her mind was that one of the figures was Harry, she was sure of it; with her heart in her throat she started walking faster, leaving the others behind.</p><p>"Ginny!" Luna tried to keep her voice low."Don't. Ginny!"</p><p>But she didn't stop, she started running forward, her mind racing until she could finally view the scene clearly. Her heart dropped as her eyes fell on Harry for the first time in over a year. His back was to her, facing Voldemort and his little minions; they were both just staring at each other. She felt Luna come up behind her and was aware enough to know that she has cast a Muffliato Charm around them. <em>What is Harry doing?</em> She thought. <em>What is happening?</em></p><p>And then her world crumbled.</p><p>She felt her her heart stop beating. It happened so fast - too fast.</p><p>"Avada Kedavra!"</p><p>She felt her mouth react before her mind could register as she wailed in agonizing devastation, the sound filling the space around them. Ginny felt a heavy weight crushing down her heart and squeezing it in a death grip as pure panic rose so sudden and fast, consuming every fiber of her body, paralyzing her as everything within her soul prayed for death, because she knew it would be a relief from this crippling pain that was washing over her, making her choke on her breath, struggling to breathe through the overwhelming tightness in her chest.</p><p>And then her body jumped into action with vengeance as she stepped forward but before she could take one step, Luna's arm caught her around the waist, pulling her back and holding her tight in place, as she put a hand on her mouth to silence her.</p><p>"Ginny, please, I was never that good at Muffliato. They might hear us."</p><p>Ginny was struggling so hard against Luna that she feared she might hurt her. She didn't know her friend was that strong, Luna never really liked to get overly physical with her training.</p><p>"Ginny, we are massively outnumbered. There's nothing you can do."</p><p>She managed to rip Luna's hand away, growling. "Let me go! I don't want to hurt you!"</p><p>She heard her gasp. "Oh wait. I can still sense his Aura."</p><p>Ginny wasn't in the right mind to digest the words. The only thing on her mind was getting to Voldemort and avenging Harry's death. Fred's. Avenging everyone's death.</p><p>With a grunt she elbowed Luna hard in the guts, hearing her yelp in pain and falling to the ground. Ginny didn't look back; she held her wand with determination. As she started moving toward her target, she heard Luna's voice from behind her.</p><p>"Petrificus Totalus!"</p><p>Ginny's entire body stiffened, as the Spell worked its way over her limbs, incapable of moving, she felt her body falling backwards, two arms catching her around the waist, trying to hold her up.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Ginny."</p><p>Her wide eyes looked onward to the scene that would be imprinted in her memory forever. Harry's dead body on the ground.</p><p><em>Harry.</em> The person that before a year ago was one of her best friends. She thought at some point that they were each other's closest friend, until one day he had disappeared with Ron and Hermione; and she felt betrayed and she was so mad at him, especially because she knew what he was doing, even if she didn't know the details at first, it wasn't difficult to guess what they were doing. But none of that mattered then, they ran out of time. They were never going to fight about it. She was never going to see him again, was never going to make him laugh or smile. She was never going to hear his voice again.</p><p>She watched as Hagrid; whom she didn't even notice was there, pick Harry's body off the ground and into his arms. She felt Luna slowly trying to move back, so she can rest Ginny's body on the ground.</p><p>She felt tears silently stream down her face as she caught a final glimpse of Harry; before her eyes were gazing up at the night sky.</p>
