          <div class="userstuff"><p>Things weren’t so different as a rat – not like Sirius who always said that things were easier to deal with as Padfoot, more primal, or James who stood up straighter after transforming back from Prongs like he knew where he stood in the world. Wormtail, though, is just Peter but smaller and more afraid.</p><p>Still, even as Wormtail, he knows that he isn’t meant to be using Moony as a distraction to get away; he should dart around the wolf’s legs and trip him up just enough that Padfoot could get to a safe distance before the claws made their mark. Moony needed time to settle down and recognise him, just like every other night.</p><p>But this wasn’t every night and Wormtail wasn’t small enough to make no difference anymore and he needed to run as fast as he can or he’ll be dead or worse –</p><p>Still, if he had been human right now he’d be crying.</p></div>
