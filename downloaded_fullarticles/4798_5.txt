    <p>It was at precisely 8:07 in the morning on the fifth of February, 1972 that the world of four boys stood completely still. At that precise moment, one Remus Lupin felt every drop of air being drawn out of his lungs by some higher power. One James Potter wanted to sink down and fall through the floorboards to the room below. One Sirius Black wished that his mouth had never had the ability to conjugate words. One Peter Pettigrew felt sick to his stomach and it wasn't just from being late to breakfast. </p><p>It was not until 8:09 that Remus Lupin regained the gift of speech and offered up one stuttering word: "alright."</p><p>Satisfied by this and scared to say more, Peter meekly nodded his head and excused himself to the dining hall. </p><p>"Is it...can we...now that you know that..we know-" James stuttered, still staring at the floor.<br/>
"-is there anything we can do to help?" Sirius finished for him, eyes pleading Remus for forgiveness. </p><p>"I...don't know. I'm used to managing on my own, of course. No one really ever helps." Remus' mind was still stumbling from the shock. He had hoped they would never find the truth, fearing the worst. Life had not been particularly kind to Remus. Yet they seemed genuine. </p><p>"Well, if there is anything we can do, please tell us." Sirius replied. "We're your friends, Remus."<br/>
James's eyes finally rose from the ground, wide and earnest. </p><p>"This doesn't change anything. You don't have to hide from us." Sirius finished.</p><p>Remus smiled wearily back in response. He knew too well not to take the statement with unbending trust. </p><p>"Thank you." He managed.</p><p>"Should we...head off to breakfast now?" James murmured. Remus nodded in response, and took the lead down the winding staircase, head swimming in an unfamiliar fog.</p>
