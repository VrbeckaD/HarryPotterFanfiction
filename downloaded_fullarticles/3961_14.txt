          <div class="userstuff"><p>Velma never changed back as much as she willed herself.  Her wand lay lost at the edge of the Forest.  She could not escape.  Her body wished for her to stay.  No other centaurs were allowed her except Magorian.</p><p> </p><p>The next night, she stood in the middle of the colony as Magorian had his way with her.  But this time it was different.  She had a human torso.  He caressed her breasts as he thrust deep into her.  Moaning in her ear.  She was pleasured by him.  Velma felt she was born to please Magorian.</p><p> </p><p>Weeks passed by and she was settled into her new family.  They taught her to defend herself with bows and arrows and spears.  They taught her to read the stars.  But they also taught her how to please them without intercourse.  Dumbledore came to find her and when he saw her, he knew he could do nothing.  Leaving the colony in peace.</p><p> </p><p>4 weeks into her new life, she felt very ill.  The younger males thought she was sick from being turned into a centaur but the star gazing centaurs smiled and touched her belly.  “A new life is inside you,” Bane declared.</p><p> </p><p>Each male came to her, kissed her and touched her precious belly.  Each of them glad that she came to them.  Magorian was the last and he kissed her passionately.  He was the leader and he had a higher claim on her.</p><p> </p><p>The months passed by quickly.  Velma’s stomach grew and so did her temper.  She became irritable and mostly uncomfortable.  The younger males cared for her more.  Fetching her food.</p><p> </p><p>She lay on her side, staring at the stars in their clearing.  Trying to read them but her body was distracting her.  She had been developing slight pains and she knew her time was imminent.  She did not wake any of the herd until she knew it was time for them to leave.  She insisted that only Magorian and Bane be present at the birth of the new foal.  She had been restless all evening, wanting to be alone.  She allowed Magorian to tie her tail to make it easier for when her time came.  A contraction grew inside her and she felt the water bag pushing from her slightly.  “Mag.”  She kicked him awake.</p><p> </p><p>He rose to his feet quickly and saw she was in obvious labour.  “Thank the stars.”  He proceeded to wake Bane and the rest of the colony.  Ordering everyone to leave.  If he heard or saw any of them, he would kill them.</p><p> </p><p>Velma stood to her feet and paced irritably.  “Ah Merlin!”  She groaned and lay back down on the soft ground.   She continued to do this for another hour until the water bag appeared.  She lay back down and with each contraction pushed the foal from her inch by inch.  With Bane’s help, she successfully birthed a son.  He was dark like his father.  Bane cleaned the boy and the boy was up on his feet very quickly.  Velma lay on the ground breathing heavily as the afterbirth was expelled from her body, which Bane caught to keep for dinner that night.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at her youngling and smiled as he laughed and danced around the fire.  Unsteady on his hooves but he was perfect.  She sat her torso up and called to him, “Apollo!”  She had named him when he first kicked her from her womb.</p><p> </p><p>The boy trotted over to her and lay by her torso.  His mouth latching onto her leaking breast.</p><p> </p><p>“Well done, Velma.”  Magorian bent down and kissed the woman.  “He is just as the stars predicted.”   Watching his son drink his fill from his mother’s breast.</p></div>
