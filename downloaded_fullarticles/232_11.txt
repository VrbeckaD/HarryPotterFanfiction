    <p>
  <span>Merula Snyde lay on the hard ground, blinking with confusion at the swirling purples and red in the sky above. Well she definitely wasn’t in the school anymore, well unless that one particular annoyance royally screwed something up again. She had to shake her head to cast off thoughts about that girl, then the witch sat up with a groan, suddenly very aware of how much her body was aching.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The surroundings were strange to say the least, twisted remnants of various buildings, some seemed recognizable to Merula as muggle landmarks, but others were just plain bizarre. The ground was covered by a deep purple moss. Standing, the young witch started to walk, but was immediately stopped when she noticed the figure in the distance, sitting at a table, pouring himself a glass of wine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Miss Snyde, you’ve finally arrived.” The man spoke when the witch closed the gap more, he swirled the wine, sniffed it and then took a light sip. “Ah, an excellent red indeed. Surprising, given its year, usually the flavour profile is weak in these but this is an excellent exception.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t know…” The girl spoke confused, mainly about why this guy was talking about wine, and not the insanity around them. “What...Who are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Call me Goro.” He said, taking another sip of his drink. “You must be confused as to where you are, Miss Snyde,” It was then Merula realized she hadn’t actually introduced herself, but just nodded at his statement, “Well this is a space between realms, most of the time they’re empty planes of nothingness, but sometimes they wind up like this. Dumping grounds for what’s left over when realms cease to be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s say I believe you, which I don’t, would that mean I was sent to the dump, and everything I know is gone?” Merula pretended she wasn’t panicking, though Goro could easily tell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, not yet anyway. You were pulled out of your realm, to save all of them. Odd it would choose a child, but nonetheless, you serve a purpose.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what if I don’t want to?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s only so much of this,” He gestured around “Nonsense here, so spending eternity here would be a bit boring.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The witch just grumbled at him about that, she didn’t even know what she was dealing with, but if she had no choice in the matter then that’s how it was going to be. “Fine then, I am the strongest witch there is, after all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you won’t be alone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could handle it myself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You would die. Horribly. A flipendo spell won’t stop an ancient evil.” The witch rolled her eyes, and grumbled something about knowing plenty more than that. “Anyway, the ones you’ll be needing to recruit will become clear as you meet them.” The man ignored Merula’s further attempts to protest, a portal appearing in the distance behind him. “That’s your way out of here, child, we shall meet again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next time Merula blinked, Goro, his wine and his table were gone. Not even a mark left to prove he was there. That was more than a little disconcerting, but Merula chose to continue on, hoping this was just some weird dream. Though she knew better, because if it was a dream she wouldn’t think to hope it wasn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Merula approaches the wildly swirling portal and reaches her hand out, several spectral hands grab her arm and pull her in...</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Elsewhere, Death arrived on a doomed world, only as its last key life was snuffed out, and, much to Death's annoyance, was met with War’s ridiculous cackling and boasting. The smaller horseman boasted of his greatness to no one in particular, so as Death reached him, he just had to comment. “Oh, congratulations, you murdered a bunch of children. Do you finally feel like a big man? You aren’t, in fact, have you gotten even shorter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>War howled with rage, much to Deaths amusement, energy building in the shorter horseman’s hand, ready to blast the taller one. But he’s met with an hourglass, if Death was capable of a grin he’d have one, said hourglass bore Wars true name on it. The short man stepping back blasting the energy he’d gather away. “You worthless coward! Fight me like a real man, damn it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If I had things my way, I wouldn’t even be here so why would I bother to fight you ever?” Death looked over, his finger moving close to the hourglass “Especially when I could just end you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Our master will destroy you, we are invaluable!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then why would he destroy me?” Death said, voice heavily showing off his annoyance as War’s rage grew more, the short man's face twisting with it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now, now, War.” Pestilence’s voice cut through the tension, as she appeared. Around her feet rot spread, mushrooms growing from the decaying flooring. “Trying to have a dick measuring with a skeleton is a sad look.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In life, Pestilence was a woman whose very existence was tied with plant life, in her current form, her body was dead but it hadn’t decayed like a human body should, instead she almost looked wilted. Tragically beautiful in a way, not giving the sense of repulsion that a corpse, even a fresh one, gave to an onlooker.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut it, woman.” The ball of currently impotent rage muttered at her, getting a sneer from the female horseman. “Now where the hell is Famine?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just as his name was spoken the disgusting creature that was Famine spilled out of a portal into the realm, sludge spreading out from him. It disgusted Death how much Famine had changed over the course of their mission, no longer even of humanoid shape, this thing was so perpetually starving it even consumed the armor it once wore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now that this realm is ready to collapse, please do the honours Death.” Pestilence’s gaze was fixed on the skeletal figure, who supposed he was easier to look at than Famine was, even before the change to be honest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have to anyway.” Said the skeleton as he held out an upturned hand, the realms ‘hourglass’ appearing in his hand, it wasn’t like the symbol of lifespans for individuals, it was raw power and energy taking a loose shape of a ball. “This world is weak, handing power and glory to those who are far from deserving of it, we grant it the death it needs so something greater may take its place.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Death placed a finger as best as was possible against the energy, the whole thing turning black, solidifying, then crumbling to dust. An impossible darkness fell that would leave only the four visible. And with a sigh, he finished the ritual. “So say the Horseman Of Apocalypse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This was definitely a primitive planet that the woman in colourful armour landed on, ‘landed certainly being a way to say ‘woke up at the beach, laying in what remained of her ships cockpit’ and, from the maps and scans she managed to salvage, there weren't many large livable land masses. Just a lot of small ones.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A little girl carrying a bag, ran behind her, cowering as soldiers appeared, they were holding guns. The woman almost growled, this was a child.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hand over the girl! She stole from the supplies of the World Government!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did she now?” The armoured woman looked down at the child, seeing the bag was full of fruit, not of the greatest quality either, and the child was rather thin “She’s just a hungry kid, let it slide.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“All criminals are to be punished to the full extent of the law!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Full extent, huh? For needing food?” Swiftly, Sabine Wren drew her blasters “How about I show you a real crime then?”</span>
