  <span>☠</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The screamers of the night had begun to practise their calls. Darkness filled the stone and iron lined cells as the moon began to rise. Night was when Azkaban came to life. A dementor drifted past Bellatrix Lestrange’s cell and turned to examine her smirking face. It instantly sucked the joy she felt from her body and she slinked back against the wall as it floated away. She’d grown addicted to the filling it gave her, despair. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She reached down and pulled on the shackle attached to her ankle, causing the chain to clink softly. She examined the scarification beneath the iron, what over a decade of being chained does to a person.  Bella crawled over to the opposite wall where her water supply was dripping down and pressed her tongue against the stones. She lapped up some water before dramatically dropping down to lay on her back. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A sharp pain suddenly began in her left forearm. She rolled up her striped sleeve to find her dark mark pulsing and inflamed. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“Dolohov!” She screamed. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“Bellatrix?” Antonin Dolohov shouted back from a nearby cell. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“Do you feel it too?” She cried out, getting to her feet. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“He’s come for us!” Dolohov cackled. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“He knows we are loyal!” Bella called out in her manic sing-song tone. She tenderly licked the tattoo on her arm. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>CRASH!</span>
  </em>
  <span> The building shook and Bella was thrown against the wall, cutting her forehead on stone. She barely noticed as one wall of her cell crumbled away, revealing the world outside. Looking down, she watched the shackle unlock from her leg and drop to the floor. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Her master must have the guards on his side.</span>
  </em>
  <span> She thought. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Laughing, she slowly made her way to the edge of her prison. The room she had spent the past fifteen years trapped inside of. The cell that had ripped what was left of her sanity away from her. Dolohov emerged beside her, but he wasn’t smiling. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Let’s get to the roof!” He shouted, pointing upwards. Bella instantly began to climb the broken stone walls on the outside of the prison. After years of weakness, her body found a new strength to propel her to the top of the tower. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once she reached the top she jumped up and down when she saw a handmade clay mug in the centre of the roof. It was one you would drink a large cup of tea out of and it had delicate flowers painted on it. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“What is it?” One of the escapees asked.</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“Idiot! It’s a portkey!” Bella rushed over to it. “Hurry up!” She lay down on her stomach and grabbed the handle of the mug. The nine other Death Eater’s rushed to join her, taking hold of the vessel. Once everyone was touching it, Bella felt the ground shift from underneath her. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“He’s come for us! We are worthy! You will not fail our lord!” Bella chanted and the men cheered in response as they began to taste their freedom. The darkness swirled around them as they tore through space and were teleported off the island of pain. </span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>&lt;--------------------{{</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The newly freed death eaters found themselves teleported outside a large gateway. Behind the sculpted metal bars was a path leading up to a grand mansion. Not as pretty as the Malfoy Manor, but far more menacing. Bellatrix recognised it as Riddle House. The home where their Lord came from.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Moments after their arrival, the ornate gates swung wide, inviting the loyalists to enter the estate. Bella led the pack, practically running to get inside, desperate to reunite with her master. As she approached the door it opened for her and she cackled as she made her way inside. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“My friends.” Voldemort hissed, pleasure obvious in his tone. “Welcome home.” The death eaters dropped to their knees to honor their king, the man who had saved them from their eternal hells. One by one he approached each one of his servants and gifted their wands back to them. He saved Bella for last; until it was just the two of them alone in the entrance hall. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He almost levitated over to her, trailing his cloak behind him. He bent down and placed a finger under Bellatrix’s chin, urging her to stand. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“You will be rewarded for your undying loyalty, Bellatrix.” Voldemort whispered. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“Had I been free I would have been at your side as you rose again, my Lord.” Bella replied, her body shivering with excitement. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“I know, my dear. You have been are my best lieutenant.” He conjured her wand into his hand and extended it out to her. “I heard what you did to the Longbottom’s.” Bella reached out and held her master’s hand in her own. She pressed her lips to the back of his hand to make him sure of her affections and he purred at her touch. She took her wand gladly and bowed as he kissed her on the forehead. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“Thank you, my lord.” She mouthed, her thirst for attention finally being met. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Now, go and get yourself cleaned up… you reek.” He moved away, yet, without showing any expression of disgust. “There is a room for you on the third floor at the far end.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She stared after him as he slipped away. Her wand finally in her hand again, she flicked it and bright golden sparks flew from it’s tip. She smiled gleefully and strutted out of the entrance hall and up the stairs. Her heart was racing as she found her way to her new home. She was finally free. It wasn’t till she was in front of a mirror that she lost her smile. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her face was hollowed out, her hair matted in clumps. She was unhealthily skinny and her teeth were ruined. Bella reached up and touched her face, barely recognising her own reflection. She examined every detail of her appearance, her anger growing by the second. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“What have they done to me?” She whispered under her breath. She was about to break the mirror when she was startled by a soft female voice behind her. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Bellatrix?” </span>
