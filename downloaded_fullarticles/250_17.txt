    <p>Harry hated summer break. While the other muggle kids were enjoying, for him it only mean more torturous time with the Dursleys. Durdley, his cousin, got bored and would find his fun using him like his personal punching bag, lucky since Kanda trained him a little bit he got faster in running away, unfortunately when the fat boy couldn’t get him he would complain to his parents making them punish Harry in many ways.</p><p>His only consolation was that he managed to  do some homework in secret by dawn when the sky was still dark, he would complete what he could while keeping very aware of all the noises around the house. He also celebrated he  convinced his uncle to let Hedwig out in the night he felt so bad the last time he had to keep her locked up, the owl seemed to have forgiven him. <br/>
Doing homework was also to make him forget a little bit about Kanda. Since the Akuma attacks ceased after they defeated Tom’s diary on the Chamber Dumbledore couldn’t convince the Ministry of Magic that Harry still needed the extra protection. The Exorcist were allowed to keep researching and deploy a few groups of Finders and Exorcists on some important magic locations but the Ministry of Magic didn’t want someone from the Vatican 24/7 with their chosen one. </p><p>Having going early to Hogwarts then meeting Kanda had been the best time of his life, of course he felt bad that people were dying because of the attacks, but he discovered of what it was to be cared and having someone that would scold him for doind stupid things, he felt protected around the Exorcist. He would let him talk all about the wizarding world without fear of being beaten or starved like what happened with the Durlseys, he also couldn’t act so excited about it with his friends without feeling stupid.</p><p>Harry scrubbed his eyes and focused again on his task quill gently scratching the parchment paper. Why did the school used quills and parchment paper he didn’t know. But for Harry it was nice how different the magic world was from the muggle world.<br/>
He heard someone going to the bathroom making his quill stop and the boy lying on his bed held his breath. If the Dursleys heard him he would definitely be locked  in the cupboard under the stairs. He was enjoying having a bedroom and was not eager to go back to the cramped space.</p><p>After the last year when Harry got back the Dursleys seemed more eager to expel the magic out of him. Dumbledore tried to send a letter explaining Harry’s important hole on the events of the last year but it was immediately destroyed and ignored. </p><p>What frustrated him was once again the lack of news from his friends. Ron tried to use the phone with disastrous consequences and probably the red haired boy told Hermione since she didn’t tried to call not wanting to get things worse for him. </p><p>He dozed off and noticed he was too tired to keep writing, he couldn’t risk spilling ink on the sheets and having the smuggled books locked away again so he carefully place it all beneath the loose floorboard under his bed. While placing his things he grabbed the small black orb that was a deactivated Golem. <br/>
“For extremes emergencies only.” Kanda said to him, Harry didn’t know what could be classified has “Extreme Emergencies” but he knew the Exorcist wouldn’t like to be called for nothing, so the golem kept deactivated through the rest of the summer. </p><p>He glanced at the clock and noticed he was 13 and once again his birthday passed like nothing. He felt himself longing for Hogwarts and his friends once more. </p><p>The boy was almost falling asleep when he heard a small noise out of his window. Perhaps the wind close it and Hedwig wanted to get back in, he grabbed his glasses and looked up to the window, three owls waited for him.<br/>
One owl looked worn out, he gently placed the owl inside Hedwig’s cage and grabbed the letter the bird was carrying, he smiled while reading the newspaper cutting, now he understood Ron lack of news, his family had won the Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw, the cutting come together with a letter from his friend and an Snekoscope. Sleep forgone Harry read the other letters.</p><p>Hedwig waited patiently to him grab her parcel from Hermione she sent him a Broomstick Servicing Kit still awed he continued reading the letter saying about how she was in France with her family and ended with:</p><p>
  <em>“I also noticed some Finders walking around, I hope no Akuma appears. Perhaps they were placed here just because there’s so much Magic history in France. If the situation was serious they would’ve sent the Exorcists right?</em><br/>
<em>Anyway I hope you enjoy your gift!”</em>
</p><p>Harry had to wrestle with Hagrid’s gift, the half giant mean well but had an odd sense of what was safe. He managed to hide the strange book creature under the floor after locking it with a belt.</p><p>Apparently his friends wanted to meet him in London on the last week of the Holidays but it was almost impossible. He knew their friends didn’t completely understand what was like to live with the Durdsleys. </p><p>He smiled when remembered how Kanda appeared on the ordinary 4 Privet Drive. The grumpy samurai intimidating his uncle and calling him <em>Walrus</em> face.</p><p>After hiding with care his gifts and cards he lay in bed to sleep, tomorrow he would think of something to make his uncle or aunt to sign the form. Still smiling he fell asleep.</p><p>The next day was disastrous.</p><p>Resuming the whole thing his “Aunt” Marge was now floating around somewhere in the sky, not that Harry cared. He was currently sitting on a low wall in the middle of the night tired after dragging his things. He grabbed the offlined Golem once again. Should he contact Kanda? What should he do? </p><p>Well, he was already expelled, no doubt. Perhaps Kanda would accept if he wanted to be a Finder? He activated the Golem.</p><p>-<em> Kid, where the hell are you?</em>- Came immediately the voice of the Exorcist.<br/>
-I…- Harry started but couldn’t manage to find the words, would Kanda be mad at him? What if he sent him back to the Dursleys?<br/>
-<em>Nevermind, don’t fucking move.</em>- the boy sat down on the curb hiding his head on his knees.</p><p>Few moments later he heard boots stepping on his direction. He looked up.</p><p>To his surprise it was Kanda standing right in front of him, usual scowl and sword. How did he reach him so fast?<br/>
-Kanda?- Harry blinked a few tears away, the exorcist scanned him and briefly looked at his trunk. He also noticed that the kid had dark shadows around his eyes and was still too thin for his like.</p><p>-Kid, why are you here?-he didn’t looked annoyed, Harry felt like a child being asked by a parent why he was not in bed yet, or at least he guessed how it would feel.</p><p>-I made my aunt float like a balloon after a fight.-answered while hidden his face on his arms once again making the last part coming out muffled but Kanda understood it. Harry suddenly looked up to him again.<br/>
-What are you doing here Kanda? How did you found me so fast?- curiosity shone in his eyes<br/>
-I was on my way to meet you when my Golem received yours signal. They can be tracked.- Harry eyed the Golems flying around each other.<br/>
-Why were you meeting me?- was he supposed to receive another letter? Like last year when Dobby intercepted all of his letters.</p><p>-I have new orders...- he started but something caught his attention, he turned to the dark part of the street with a hand on his sword handle grounding a combat position. Harry for a moment thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes on the shadows, he grabbed his wand and pointed in the direction of the eyes, a loud whistle made Kanda jump out of the way of a stupidly tall purple bus.<br/>
Kanda glared daggers at the offending bus, hand still on the sword handle. Stepping out of the bus come a man dressed like a bus assistant.</p><p>-Why would you call The Knight Bus and stay on it’s way?- the man with no sense of self preservation dared to question Kanda that was almost unsheathing his sword.<br/>
-We must go to London.- Harry cut in, Kanda gave a small “che” and paid their tickets. </p><p>Harry didn’t managed to ask what Kanda was going to say when they were interrupted. He was too busy on not falling while the bus did impossible turns, Kanda was standing like a boss just gracefully stepping out of the rolling beds way, the boy envied the Exorcist balance abilities.<br/>
When they finally arrived in Leaky Cauldron and were dropped on the streets Harry was exhausted.<br/>
-What was you saying before?- he managed to ask Kanda that looked at the deserted street for a moment.<br/>
-Another place. Come on, grab your things.- Harry grabbed his trunk and noticed for the first time Kanda was carrying a small case.</p><p>-I was sent to guard you once again.- he started when they arrived at the room, Kanda didn’t felt any spying spells and he knew his Innocence would affect magical items so the room was secured.<br/>
-There was a fugitive from Azkaban, someone they think to have connections with the bastard that killed your parents. Since the  Dark Order managed to prove the relation between Voldemort and the Earl, any business with the so called Dark Lord will also be treated has a Dark Order business. Also…-  Someone knocked on the door.</p><p>-Mr. Exorcist? The Minister is here.- Tom the Leaky Cauldron landlord announced.<br/>
-The Minister?- Harry asked puzzled.<br/>
-The Minister for Magic, he wanted to meet us when we arrived. - Kanda waved his gloved hand to him to follow. <br/>
The room Tom lead them to was was more decorated, behind the big wood desk Cornelius Fudge waited for them when they stepped in the man glanced at the activated Golem that was flying close to the Exorcist left shoulder, Harry’s was dormant in his pocket.<br/>
-Ah! Harry! Mr. Kanda! Glad you arrived so quickly.- the old man said with forced smile Tom arrived with an apron with a tray of tea and strange snacks.<br/>
-You had us worried for a moment Harry, running away from aunt and uncle’s house like that.- the old man sipped his tea giving another hesitant glance at the Golem.<br/>
-But no harm done Miss Dursley was deflated and her memories changed.- the man smiled happily. Harry fidget uncomfortably. <br/>
-If you are worried about your aunt and uncle no worries. They will accept you next summer, this year Mr. Kanda will be your guardian. - the last part came hesitant. Kanda that said nothing until now only deepened his scowl, Fudge gulped. Harry could only stare amazed at Kanda.<br/>
-Anyway...for the remaining holiday you will have a room here.Keep from going to the Muggle London Mr.Kanda can answer any more questions you may have. Have a nice Holiday Harry! - Fudge dismissed them far to quickly. The man was clearly uncomfortable with the presence of the Exorcist.</p><p>They returned to the room in silence. When they reached it Kanda deactivated his Golem and continued from where they were interrupted, the Exorcist handled him some papers.<br/>
-Since for now we don’t know how long it will take for hunting all the Earl influence with Voldemort on the wizarding world, I was assigned to be your guardian this year.- reading the document Harry couldn't believe it.</p><p>Kanda wasn’t expecting the hug. Immediately freezing but didn’t shoved him off, hands hovering not knowing what to do.The hug lasted for a second and Harry soon let go.<br/>
-This time it will be only me. But don’t think it will make any easier for you and your friends go around sneaking in cursed bathrooms! -<span> he continued like nothing happened and ended with a pointy glare, Harry nodded quickly.</span><br/>
-I’m not expelled?- Harry was confused, he always heard how the ministry would punish the minors that made magic outside school.<br/>
-No, he agreed it was a stupid acident. Besides…- Kanda side glanced at him with a small smirk on his lips.<br/>
-The bitch probably deserved that.- Harry snorted, now that he stopped to think about it, one oversized “Aunt” Marge balloon screaming on the sky while being chased by his out of shape uncle was <em>hilarious</em>. He let himself lough feeling relieved of being out of that hateful house and not being expelled.</p><p>One great grey owl hooted gently out of the window. Kanda let the owl and placed her parcel on the bed.</p><p>-They are for you.- Kanda said while gently petting the big bird. Harry looked at the cards and looked puzzled back at Kanda but the General was very disinterested.</p><p>They were cards wishing Happy Birthday and small gifts, from books to more art supplies. Harry felt so warm from the kindness of the people he never met. Happy tears escaped his eyes, sitting on the bed he scrubbed them. </p><p>
  <em>Hoo</em>
</p><p>In front of him the grey owl landed and hooted softly at him,this close the bird was even bigger but the eyes was intelligent and kind like Hedwig.<br/>
-Thank you.- the boy smiled and petted the owl that nipped his hand gently before flying to Kanda giving one proud “<em>Hoo”</em> and vanishing on the night.  </p><p>The next day Harry explored his new freedom. He woke up with Kanda already up and ready, his room being just next door with a secret passage between them. <br/>
He enjoyed eating whatever he wanted and while reading the latest news Tom arrive offering more food.<br/>
-It’s good you are here Mr. Potter. I may be relieved from door duty for now.- Harry looked puzzled at the landlord.<br/>
-It’s because Mr.Exorcist was banned from opening the wall to Diagon Alley. Strange things magic do when the Exorcists are around.- Looking like remembering some trauma the other left to tend another table. </p><p>Kanda didn’t looked annoyed at Harry for going into Diagon Alley almost everyday. The other wizards and witches would watch the Exorcist with awe and worry.The samurai mood looked better from the last time they were in Diagon alley when streets were full and the stores bursting. <br/>
Harry would always talk about the amazing things he found out about the wizarding world and Kanda would listen with little to almost middle interest.</p><p>Of course people started to noticed Kanda and Harry were always together but strangely none confronted them yet. Maybe the killing aura from the Exorcist prevented it. So the boy continued to enjoy the rest of the holidays without being trapped in awkward handshakes and small talk from strangers.</p><p>One strangest thing happened one day when Harry had to refill his money from his vault in Gringotts. The moment Kanda stepped in all the goblins stopped their rhytimatic stamping and stared at the Exorcist with fear. <br/>
-You go, I will wait in here.- Kanda said and placed himself close to the door. <br/>
When he returned Kanda was talking with a Finder.<br/>
-They still afraid from what happened last time.- the other laughed and Kanda gave his usual scowl.<br/>
-Hello Mr. Cruz.- Harry greeted remembering the Finder from the last year.<br/>
-Oh! Surprised you remember me boy. Hello how are you?- the man handled to Kanda a small bag with wizard money.<br/>
-I’m fine, happy to enjoy the rest of the Holidays, what happened the last time?- Cruz gave a loud laugh earning few annoyed glances from the goblins.<br/>
- There was an Akuma attack and the other Exorcist crashed inside the bank, he had to activate his Innocence and all the vaults lost their warding spells. You can imagine how the little guys were happy.- Cruz blinked at him with a playful smile. </p><p>Cruz walked with them for some time much for Kanda annoyance. The man was happy to share non confidential stories about the Exorcist.</p><p>-One day he returned from a long mission and immediately gathered his Finders Squad on the training grounds, it was a massacre, General Kanda made us exercise to the bone. - the man was good on telling stories.<br/>
-When the high ups questioned about it he only said “<em>I know those lazy bunch trained shit while I was away.”</em> - Cruz laughed and Harry couldn’t help but smile imagining Kanda said it with his murderous glare.<br/>
-In the end he was right though. We had only  leisured around. Our General know us so well.- the man made an exaggerated emotional face. </p><p>-I have to tell you kid. No one of the General Kanda squad have shit of self preservation.- Cruz and Harry grinned from ear to ear while Kanda controlled himself to not unscheat Mugen on the middle of the street.</p>
