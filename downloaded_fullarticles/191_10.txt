    <p>The war had many casualties from both sides, each believing that the cause that they were fighting for was the correct one. The one worth dying for. On one side stood Harry Potter the boy who lived and who represented all that was light and good. On the other side was Voldermort who stood for darkness and blood purity. Even now as Narcissa Malfoy sits in the ruins of Hogwarts surveying the damage she knows that even though good had won the war they would never be able to fully repair what was broken, physically yes but in every way that really mattered the scars would remain.</p>
<p>Narcissa felt the lump in her pocket and quickly curled her fingers around the object, before the battle Bellatrix had given it to her as a gift as insurance that her baby sister would be protected from any outcome. Say what you will about Bellatrix, she was loyal to the end to those she deemed worthy of her affection.</p>
<p>The object was one that many in the building would recognize, it was silver instead of gold and the sand in the hourglass was a deep shade of crimson instead of its usual light brown. To anybody else this would be just another time turner but on closer inspection it was much more than that, much more powerful and that power could take you back quite some time.</p>
<p>Many with this in their possession would attempt to go back to change the outcome of the war or save many of the lives lost. Not Narcissa, she would be going back to save her sister. And to do so she would give Bellatrix what she had always wanted, a child. She would go back 17 years, just before the attack on the Longbottoms and give her sister the gift she had always deserved.</p>
<p>"You're plotting aren't you?" Lucius said in a quiet whisper next to her.</p>
<p>"Lucius, I suggest you concentrate on your own predicament before accusing me of plotting," Narcissa hissed, pointedly glancing at the aurors surrounding them on all sides.</p>
<p>Lucius promptly quieted down leaving Narcissa the opportunity to search for the most important piece of the puzzle, the perfect child for Bellatrix. Longbottom was hopeless, Weasley would be too obvious, they needed someone who would fit into the family. Parkinson's family status was too high to risk it.</p>
<p>Just when Narcissa was starting to lose hope of finding the perfect child among the sea of incompetent students before her, her attention was caught by a mane of brown hair. The hair was tangled and messy much like her sisters shortly after her escape from Azkaban.</p>
<p>Granger was smart, strong, and magically competent. She may be a muggle but that may be to Narcissa’s benefit, no one magical would notice the child's disappearance and Bella wouldn't have to be made aware of her blood status.</p>
<p>"Yes, Granger would be perfect," were her final thoughts before slipping the time turner around her neck and turning it back 17 years. The last thing she saw was an outraged Lucius screaming in her direction.</p>
