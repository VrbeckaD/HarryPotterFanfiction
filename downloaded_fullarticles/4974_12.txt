    <p>
  <span>Harry wasn’t sure how he’d found himself at the bar in the first place, let alone outside in the snow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He buried his head further into his knees, fingers stiff and tingling with the cold. Too much- everything was too much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Almost leaping out of his skin when a gentle hand touched his shoulder, he felt a burst of warmth soar through his skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry?” a voice whispered, tightening their grip almost imperceptibly around his shoulder. “Is that you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry peered up blearily through his smudged glasses to see a blond smear. “Neville?”</span>
</p><p><span>A sigh</span> <span>cut through the icy air as Neville crouched beside him in the snow. A soft mitten brushed his forehead gently as the other man slipped an arm under his own. Together, they rose unsteadily to their feet with a creaking and crackling of snow beneath them.</span></p><p>
  <span>Neville half carried, half dragged Harry over to the nearest bench, a little chipped blue thing inside a covered bus stop. Neville began to rub Harry’s stiff hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” he asked softly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Broke up with ‘inny,” Harry slurred. “No one talk. Was dumb.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did you break up with her?” Neville asked, his hands stilling on top of Harry’s for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t- couldn’t,” he shuddered, pressing his head against Neville’s shoulder. The alcohol burned inside him, but the rest of him felt so cold...except for Neville’s hands on his. “I couldn’t give her what she wanted. I couldn’t. Please….Ginny….”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ginny’s not here,” Neville said. “How much did you drink, Harry?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dunno.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Want me to take you to my apartment? Make sure you dry out okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’ care.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Casting a Notice-Me-Not charm on the area, Neville hauled Harry onto his shoulder and Disapparated. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neville set Harry down on his couch and sat beside him. “You had to have been sitting in the snow for ages, Harry…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’ matter,” Harry muttered. “Sirius and Remus and Mum and Dad all dead and Gin’ don’ want me and Ron angry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I care,’ Neville said, cheeks reddening with something other than the fireplace. “Okay? I care about you, Harry Potter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sloppy, alcohol-laden lips suddenly smacked the side of Neville’s face before Harry flopped back down, curling under the blankets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Care ‘bout you too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heat rushed through Neville’s cheeks as he wrapped a blanket around Harry’s shaking shoulders and retreated to a chair. “Night, Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Night, Nev.” </span>
