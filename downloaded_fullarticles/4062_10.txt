    <p>“You’d better go if you don’t want to miss the train Al” Harry said to his son, It was his first year at Hogwarts. Albus nodded and reached Rose, who was waiting for him near the wagon.<br/>
They went on the train, and the doors closed after them while Rose started saying: “Now we have to chose where to sit.. You know our fathers met each other in this train, right? We have to find our best friends right now, but fortunately I think that everyone in this strain wants to be our friend”. She moved along the corridor followed by Albus, who was starting to be nervous under the pressure of what his cousin was saying.<br/>
“Let’s try this one.” said Rose. Albus  opened the door of a near compartment, inside it, sitting by the window, there was a thin pale boy with blonde hair who smiled kindly to Albus.<br/>
“Can we sit here?” asked Albus looking at the dark green eyes of the stranger.<br/>
“Yes, It’s just me” answered the boy waving his hand towards the empty seats.<br/>
“Good. So we can sit here.. for a while.. do you mind?” asked hesitantly Albus entering the room, followed by his cousin Rose.<br/>
“Yes, you’re welcome here”  smiled Scorpius standing up.<br/>
“Albus. Al. I’m Albus” said Albus introducing himself. “Hi, Scorpius. I mean I’m Scorpius. You’re Albus. My name is Scorpius” mumbled nervously the pale boy “And You are…?” he asked looking at Rose. “Rose.” She answered coldly standing still near the seat where Albus was already sat.<br/>
The silence filled the room for a moment, until Scorpius decided to offer some of his candies to the two new arrivals. “Thanks, my mother never let me eat sweets when I’m at home!” exclaimed happily Albus starting to eat. Albus sit in front of the new guy and they both looked at the people disappearing outside the window when the train started moving.<br/>
A nudge hit Albus in the back, but he was so focused on all the magic candies that Scorpius was giving to him that he barely noticed it.<br/>
“So which can I chose?..  ROSE! Stop hitting me!” snapped Albus impatiently. “I’m not hitting you Al..” answer Rose folding her arms, she was still standing near the empty seats.<br/>
“Yes, You are. And it hurts.” said Albus in an accusatory tone looking up at her.<br/>
She stood still without speaking for some seconds, and then Scorpius said: “Sorry, I know It’s my fault”. He looked down: “ I know who you are Albus, so I think that You should know who I am”.<br/>
Albus looked at him, confused.<br/>
“You are Albus Potter, and She’s Rose Granger Weasley...” Scorpius continued hesitantly “..and I am Scorpius Malfoy. My parents are Astoria and Draco Malfoy. Our parents didn’t really get along.”.<br/>
The shame that Scorpius felt saying those words was barely perceptible. He never imagined before that the first nice person he would meet in his way to Hogwarts would be Harry Potter’s son. His father had told him that Albus had his same age, but what a coincidence to meet him so soon!<br/>
But the worst thing was that they couldn’t be friends. “Surely He will go away ” thought Scorpius, “My only fault  is my name”.<br/>
“Your parents were Death Eaters! Saying that They didn’t get along is an euphemism!” snapped Rose offended.<br/>
“My dad was. My mum wasn’t.” answered back Scorpius raising his voice.<br/>
He already knew that the years at Hogwarts wouldn’t be easy for him, his father was a Death Eater after all, and so were his grandparents. Even if they weren’t sent to Azkaban at the end of the war where Voldemort was defeated, it doesn’t mean that they were totally innocent. This meant that all the students not muggle-born of Hogwarts would be scared of him; They probably wouldn’t either try  to listen to his words if he would try to explain that he was different from the other members of his family.<br/>
“There are also voices that He’s Voldemort’ s son, Al. “ continued Rose, staring  suspiciously at Scorpius “But I don’t think that they are true.. I mean, look at his nose!”. They laughed nervously, but fortunately that joke lightened up the mood a little bit.<br/>
“Well Albus, I think that It’s time to go now. We’ll find another compartment.” said Rose turning her back to Scorpius. Albus looked up at her, and then at Scorpius. The blond boy was looking down at his knees, hopelessly.<br/>
“You can go Rose.” answered Albus “I’ll stay here”.<br/>
“What? It’s your only chance, I won’t wait for you.” said Rose with a threatening tone.<br/>
Albus looked at her : “I’m not asking you to wait”.<br/>
Rose without hesitation took her trunk, and left the compartment slamming the door after her. </p>
<p>Scorpius was looking at Albus unbelievable of what just happened. He couldn’t understand the situation, why Harry Potter’s son was still here?<br/>
“I’m sorry for my cousin” said hesitantly Albus “So what were we talking about?”.<br/>
“I think.. Pepper Imps… they are my favorites” answered  Scorpius tying to put himself together. Still shocked He gave some of the candies to Albus, who smiled kindly to him.<br/>
Scorpius felt his cheeks blushing, He just noticed Albus’ bright green eyes, which were focused on the several  wrappers in his hands . The eyes were too light behind the dark hairs that hid his forehead, but they gave him a mysterious appearance.<br/>
Suddenly Albus looked up at Scorpius, who quickly took his eyes off him.<br/>
“Are you nervous about going to Hogwarts?” asked Albus without noticing Scorpius’ embarrassment.<br/>
“Yes, I am. My father told me that he didn’t like to go to Hogwarts, even if he didn’t want to tell my why..” answered Scorpius “.. and you? Are you nervous?”.<br/>
Albus quickly swallowed another candy before speaking : “Well my father told me that his years at Hogwarts were the best of his life, so I think It will be fun for us too!”, but then his look became worried “But I ‘m scared..if I won’t  be sorted in Gryffindor..”.<br/>
“In Gryffindor?” interrupted Scorpius “Oh right! Your father is Harry Potter so he obviously wants you to end up in his house. Well, I think I’ll be sorted in Slytherin because all members of my family belonged to that house instead.”.<br/>
They stopped eating for a moment and they looked at each other meaningfully. “Does It mean that we can’t be friends?..” asked timidly Scorpius.<br/>
“No.. Obviously not!”  answer determined Albus, “It doesn’t mean anything, there isn’t a rule that forbids to be friends with other house’s students.”.<br/>
Scorpius smiled hopefully, that guy was totally different from what he had expected.</p>
<p>The light of the sun was slowly fading away, while the earlier stars were starting to shine in the sky. Albus was looking outside the window, “We’re almost arrived”  He thought turning his head towards his new friend.<br/>
Scorpius was peacefully sleeping on his seat, his head laid against the cold glass of the window. His blond eyelashes cast a shadow on the fair skin of his face.  Albus thought that he had been very lucky to find such a good mate so soon, but he was worried about losing him after the Sorting Ceremony. What he had said before was just to comfort Scorpius, and probably to persuade himself too.<br/>
The train started to slow down, Albus stood up and grabbed his coat, then he moved closer to Scorpius, he  reached out and shook gently  Scorpius’ shoulder. Scorpius opened his eyes lazily, and looked up toward Albus. “The train is slowing down, we have to get ready” explained Albus.<br/>
Scorpius jumped up and looked at his dresses to check that everything was in the right place. They already changed their muggle clothes into their school uniforms, the only things missing were their ties.<br/>
The students crowded the corridors when the train stopped. Albus and Scorpius got off the train dragging their trunks and followed the massive shape of Hagrid, who was shouting “First yer here!  Follo’ me!”. Hagrid as usual led the first year students to the lake, where some boats were waiting for them. “Students on boats!” shouted Hagrid,  “Al! Rose! C’m with me” said happily looking at them. They followed Hagrid on a boat, while Scorpius was waiting uncertain “Ye can come too! Ye mus’ be Draco’s son, right?” asked Hagrid lending a hand to Scorpius, helping him to come aboard.<br/>
The wind  blew vigorously, forcing them to stay close together, while the boats slowly crossed the lake. After what seems hours the new students finally arrived to the castle of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Professor Longbottom received the new students and led them to the Great Hall, were Professor McGonagall was waiting with the Sorting Hat in her hands. The room was full of older students, who were waiting for the Sorting Ceremony to start.  She started to call new students’ names, one after another, while the Sorting Hat shouted the houses’ names.<br/>
When Rose was called and the hat was placed on her head he shouted “GRYFFINDOR!”, while cheers and clapping raised from the Gryffindor table. “Ron ad Hermione will be very proud of her” thought Albus, but he started to feel sick. He had to become a Gryffindor too, or his parents would be disappointed.<br/>
Scorpius noticed the sudden change of expression on Albus’ face, and understood what was in his mind. He came closer to Albus, trying to avoid the students around them and he whispered in Albus hear : “Don’t worry, It doesn’t matter in which house you’ll end up. Just be yourself and the hat will choose the right place for you”.<br/>
“Scorpius Malfoy “ called McGonagall. Scorpius suddenly ran toward her and she placed the hat on his head. After a second the hat announced “SLYTHERIN!”, and cheers grew from the Slytherin table.<br/>
Another pair of names were called before Albus turn, when Professor McGonagall called his name he slowly walked near the hat and then he waited to hear the hat’s decision.<br/>
Unexpectedly when the hat was placed on his head Albus heard a voice : “Mmm.. another Potter.. and one more difficult choice.. “. Albus realized with great surprise that the Sorting Hat was talking to him!<br/>
“I can see that there’s a conflict between your head and your heart Albus… but which one do I have to consider?” continued the hat. Albus looked around nervously, trying to find some help that could make the choice easier; His look went on the Gryffindor table first, where James was looking at him nervously and Rose was already chatting and giggling with other students. Then Albus looked at the Slytherin table and he saw Scorpius’ green eyes looking directly at him, hopefully.<br/>
“The decision is made” whispered the hat, “SLYTHERIN!”.<br/>
A mixture of applauses and whispers filled the Great Hall. Albus was confused, he felt guilty and shocked and demoralized, but at the same time he was relieved. “You have to go to your table” said firmly Professor McGonagall, patting kindly Albus’s shoulder.<br/>
He finally stood up, and walked quickly toward an empty seat near Scorpius, trying to avoid the students’ glances. “Yay Albus! Aren’t you happy? We are together!” Asked enthusiastically Scorpius, while Albus was looking at the empty plate in front of him. “Yes.. yes I think I am” answered uncertainly Albus looking up at Scorpius smiling face, “But at least we can still be friends” added smiling back at him.</p>
