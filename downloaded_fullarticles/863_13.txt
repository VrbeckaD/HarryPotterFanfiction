    <p>Lily Evans hated Christmas.</p>
<p>For most people, Christmas was a holiday best spent with friends and family. It was a time for spiced drinks and shopping, a time for partaking in nauseatingly cute traditions like carolling or seeing a pantomime.</p>
<p>Lily wasn't most people.</p>
<p>For one thing, she worked as a Healer in St Mungo's Magical Accidents and Emergencies Department, and they didn't close for the holidays. Or ever, really.</p>
<p>For another, she had friends, but no family — unless you counted her estranged sister, but they weren't on speaking terms. This meant that she spent Christmas one of two ways: either working in the MA&amp;E, or else alone in her flat, eating takeaway and watching the Queen's speech. The MA&amp;E was exhausting, but being alone on Christmas was just pathetic.</p>
<p>That was why, if she had to rank the holidays, Christmas would fall dead last.</p>
<p>There was one Christmas tradition she'd never managed to wriggle out of, however. And she was running late for it.</p>
<p>At the end of her shift at St Mungo's, she ducked into a changing room and pulled off her emerald robes, which were stained and damp with sweat. As she changed into a more-presentable jumper and skirt, she glanced at herself in the mirror, frowning at what she saw there. She looked as if she'd just worked for fourteen hours straight. Which, in fact, she had.</p>
<p>On days like this, she regretted not having joined the Order when she'd had the chance. She could have retired in her early twenties, a war hero, like half of the Order had done, instead of working gruelling shifts in the MA&amp;E.</p>
<p>She'd very nearly joined the Order, too, after graduating from Hogwarts. It had been a choice between the Order and Healing, and she'd chosen Healing, because —</p>
<p>Something soft and cold brushed against her leg. An ethereal silver cat curled its tail around her calf, giving her a rather scornful look.</p>
<p>The cat opened its mouth. "Where are you?" It asked. It sounded exactly like Marlene McKinnon, her best friend since Hogwarts. "We've been waiting over an hour in the bloody cold."</p>
<p>Over an hour? She'd expected them to go on without her after fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe she could still get out of this. It wasn't too late.</p>
<p>"Tell her she shouldn't have waited," Lily said to the Patronus. "Got held up at work, not sure if I'll make it..."</p>
<p>The cat paused, presumably relaying the message. After a moment, it addressed her again. "Lily Evans, you are a terrible liar. Get your overworked arse to Godric's Hollow as soon as you can. And don't even think about standing us up — we're not letting you rot in your apartment."</p>
<p>Damn. Well, it had been worth a shot.</p>
<p>Lily cast one last glance in the mirror and sighed. She hurried down to the ground floor of St Mungo's, which was still packed with witches and wizards who were waiting to be examined. How was that even possible? She'd spent the past fourteen hours Healing people, and still they kept coming. It never stopped.</p>
<p>She spun on her heel, Disapparating.</p>
<p>She reappeared on Godric's Hollow's main street. It was snowing, unlike in London. Also unlike London, the village was covered in holiday decorations. The brightly-lit shopfronts made her dizzy with their dazzling Christmas lights, and it sounded like twelve different carols were playing at once.</p>
<p>Lily pulled her coat tighter as she walked towards the village square, certain she'd have a headache before the night was over. The Prophet had declared Godric's Hollow to be wizarding Britain's most festive town for the seventh year in a row, and its inhabitants were clearly proud of this. They'd gone even more overboard with the decorations this year.</p>
<p><em>Be positive</em>, she told herself, snow crunching under her boots.<em> It could be worse</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the village square was free of enchanted ice sculptures, which was a pleasant surprise. Last year, the square had been home to a herd of icy reindeer that had pranced around and left piles of frozen dung everywhere.</p>
<p>"There you are," said a voice. Marlene McKinnon was sitting on a nearby bench, holding hands with Dorcas Meadowes, her girlfriend. They both looked quite comfortable, especially considering they had spent over an hour in the cold. Lily suspected either Warming Charms, or the flask Marlene carried under her robes.</p>
<p>"Sorry I'm late," she said. "It got busy right at the end of my shift — flying sleigh accident, of all things. Had to stay 'til that was sorted."</p>
<p>"We figured it was something like that," said Dorcas, smiling. She was taller than Marlene and had dark brown skin and a gap between her front teeth. Although she was wearing stylish furs above a set of festive Christmas robes, looking every inch a capable witch, Lily knew that the chestnut wand at Dorcas' hip was a fake. Despite being a Muggle, Dorcas had been part of the Order — it was where she had met Marlene — and had even fought Voldemort several times during the war.</p>
<p>"Ready to have a look at the lights, then?" asked Marlene. "The decorations this year are excellent, you should see the display the Abbots have put up…"</p>
<p>Lily smiled in spite of herself. Marlene and Dorcas had always made a point of including Lily in their holiday plans. She might not like Christmas, but she truly appreciated the gesture. Walking with them around Godric's Hollow, admiring the lights, was the only truly festive thing she ever did during the holidays.</p>
<p>Dorcas nudged her. "Did you notice what someone did to the statue?"</p>
<p>She gestured towards the statue in the middle of the square, which depicted a victorious Dumbledore standing over the body of Lord Voldemort. Someone had dressed Dumbledore to look like Father Christmas, complete with fluffy red robes and a long cap.</p>
<p>Lily smiled. "I've always thought Dumbledore looked like Santa Claus."</p>
<p>"Who?" asked Marlene.</p>
<p>Lily and Dorcas exchanged an incredulous look. "I've told you this a hundred times, Marly," said Dorcas. "He's the Muggle version of Father Christmas."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's right," said Marlene. "You Muggles always have such funny names for things, it's hard to keep them all straight…"</p>
<p>Dorcas rolled her eyes at Lily, then kissed Marlene affectionately on the cheek.</p>
<p>They turned down a lavishly-decorated street. Beautiful garlands wound up the streetlamps, and the houses were so covered in lights that it was hard to know where to look.</p>
<p>Lily could have spent an hour on this street alone, taking in all the details, had she been someone who actually enjoyed looking at Christmas lights. In truth, though, she was really only looking forward to seeing one house in particular. The Potters' house.</p>
<p>James Potter was her ex. 'Ex' was possibly too strong of a word for it; they'd dated five years ago, during their last year at Hogwarts. He'd been her first love, her Hogwarts sweetheart, and she had gotten over him, truly.</p>
<p>Except.</p>
<p>It was his fault she couldn't forget about entirely; well, him and his parents. The Potters — Fleamont, Euphemia, and their son, James — were well-known for putting up the best Christmas lights in the village. This was terrible, because she took far too much pleasure from admiring the decorations covering their little cottage, wondering which had been James' idea. Wondering if he'd Transfigured the strings of fairy lights himself, if he was adjusting well after the war, if he ever thought of her —</p>
<p>Lily stamped the snow under her feet harder than was strictly necessary, willing herself to stop thinking about him. For eleven months of the year, she barely gave James Potter a second thought. It was only during the last month, nettlesome December, when he seemed to take up space in her skull, an unwelcome guest.</p>
<p>She had no idea why she couldn't forget about him completely. They hadn't kept in touch after Hogwarts, and she hadn't seen him in years — not since just before the war's end.</p>
<p>He'd appeared in the MA&amp;E one night, his unruly hair long and matted, holding an unconscious and bleeding Sirius Black in his arms. It had taken half a dozen Healers to staunch the bleeding, and as soon as Sirius had been stabilized, James had grabbed him by the arm and Apparated both of them away.</p>
<p>The war had ended just a few months after that. She'd crossed paths with Sirius a few times since then — he owned a popular pub in Hogsmeade that Marlene liked to frequent — but she hadn't seen James. There were rumours that he and Sirius had been instrumental in ending the war, but she wasn't sure if that was true. Marlene and Dorcas were tight-lipped about their time in the Order.</p>
<p>"There's the Abbots'," commented Marlene, bringing Lily out of her thoughts. She pointed to one house whose roof was bowing under the sheer weight of its decorations. Garden gnomes dressed as Santa's elves ran about frantically, trying to swipe ornaments from the bushes in the garden.</p>
<p>Lily laughed at the sight of the gnomes. "I can't believe they haven't been fined by the Improper Use of Magic Office yet. I mean, what'll the Muggles think if they see a bunch of gnomes running around?"</p>
<p>"Nah, I doubt the Ministry cares," said Marlene. "The Minister for Magic's busy enjoying another year of peace. He's not going to bother himself about people with too much holiday cheer."</p>
<p>They passed the church and graveyard that stood on the outskirts of Godric's Hollow. There were fewer villagers strolling about here; music from carolers floated out of the church's stained glass windows, and a blanket of untouched snow lay over the graveyard.</p>
<p>Lily quickened her step. The Potters lived just beyond the church. Last Christmas, they had Transfigured their entire cottage into a gingerbread house, and this year's display was bound to be even better. James Potter, for all his faults, had always been indecently brilliant.</p>
<p>As they reached the Potters' house, Lily slowed her pace. She frowned, her excitement turning to confusion.</p>
<p>There were no Christmas lights illuminating the Potters' cottage. Overgrown vines crept up the sides of the house, and its interior was as dark and silent as the graveyard they had passed. It was as if the Potters had abandoned the cottage entirely.</p>
<p>"The Potters live here, right?" asked Lily. She tried to sound suitably uncertain, as if she didn't already know exactly who the house belonged to. "Did they move?"</p>
<p>Marlene and Dorcas exchanged a look. "You didn't hear?" asked Marlene.</p>
<p>"Hear what?" Maybe James had moved away. But even if he had left, wouldn't his parents still have put up Christmas decorations?</p>
<p>"It's just…" said Marlene. She hesitated. "James' parents passed away."</p>
<p>Lily's heart sank. "That's awful. What happened?"</p>
<p>"Dragon pox, I think," said Marlene.</p>
<p>Lily grimaced. They'd seen an influx of dragon pox at St Mungo's this winter, and it wasn't pretty. "That's terrible. Dragon pox in older wizards is… not good. Do you know how James is holding up?"</p>
<p>"Well, you know how he is," said Dorcas. Lily didn't, but she didn't interject. "It takes a lot to get him down. We had him round for dinner last month, though, and he seemed…sad. Not like his usual self."</p>
<p>Lily bit her lip and looked towards the darkened cottage. "Did he move?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," said Marlene. She put her hands on the front gate and squinted, trying to peer into the windows. "Sirius and Remus let him crash at their place for a while, but as far as I know, he's still living here, in Godric's Hollow. Probably not in the mood for Christmas lights, though."</p>
<p>"It's a pity, " said Dorcas. "James loved putting up decorations with his parents. Used to, anyway."</p>
<p>"Well, maybe he'll be up for it next year," said Marlene, though she sounded uncertain. Dorcas shook her head.</p>
<p>The night felt colder on their walk back to the centre of the village. Even the well-lit shopfronts seemed dimmer, less festive. "I should go," said Lily once they had returned to the square.</p>
<p>"Have a drink with us!" protested Marlene. "They're doing Christmas karaoke at the White Hart, it's a Muggle pub so you'll know all the words…"</p>
<p>Nothing sounded worse to Lily than the words 'karaoke' and 'Christmas' in the same sentence. "I wish I could," she said, trying to sound tempted, "but I have to work tomorrow."</p>
<p>"You work too much," said Dorcas. "It's nearly Christmas! You ought to take some time off, enjoy the holiday."</p>
<p>"I've had my fill of holiday enjoyment for one night," said Lily darkly. "For the year, even."</p>
<p>"One of these days, you'll admit you actually like Christmas," said Marlene.</p>
<p>"I don't. It's awful. The lights have given me a headache."</p>
<p>"And yet, you still come to Godric's Hollow with us every year," said Marlene. She brightened, a thought occurring to her. "I know. Sirius is having a group over for drinks on Christmas Eve, at the Haunted Hound. You should come!"</p>
<p>"I have to —"</p>
<p>"… <em>Don't</em> say work," said Marlene.</p>
<p>"I told Healer Shafiq I'd cover a shift for her —"</p>
<p>"Well, tell her something's come up," said Marlene. "I think Mary will be there. She's dating Peter now, did you know that?"</p>
<p>Lily blinked, surprised. "Peter… <em>Pettigrew</em>?"</p>
<p>"They're cute together," said Dorcas defensively. "You'll see. You haven't seen Mary for ages, right?"</p>
<p>Lily softened a little. "I haven't seen <em>anyone</em> from Hogwarts for ages."</p>
<p>"Then it's decided," said Marlene firmly. "You're coming to the Haunted Hound on Christmas Eve, even if I have to drag you there myself."</p>
<p>Lily kissed Marlene and Dorcas good-bye, promising she'd at least consider it, then Apparated home.</p>
<p>She lived in a small flat in the heart of London, within walking distance of St Mungo's. 'Small' was a bit of an exaggeration, really — her flat was barely bigger than a broom cupboard. She liked it that way, though.</p>
<p>She hung up her coat and made herself a cup of tea, which she sipped as she stared out her window. St Mungo's was visible from her flat; its hundreds of windows were still lit, flickering like lights on a Christmas tree. The hospital never slept.</p>
<p>Had James' parents come to St Mungo's when they realized they were ill? Did they go to the MA&amp;E, or had they been transferred directly to one of the wards?</p>
<p>She turned from the window. Her imagination wasn't doing her any favours; wondering about the Potters' fate wouldn't bring them back. She sat on the sofa and pointed her wand at the fireplace.</p>
<p>Crackling flames rose in the hearth, but they did nothing to ease the chill she felt. She knew what James must be going through. Both of her parents were dead, too. Her father had passed when she was just a little girl, so she didn't remember him all that well. Her mum, though…</p>
<p>It had been December when her mother passed away. Blasted, freezing, miserable December.</p>
<p>Lily glanced at a thick, leather-bound book that was sitting on her bookcase, sandwiched between Healing magazines and Muggle novels. The book seemed to be calling to her, begging her to open it.</p>
<p><em>Bad idea</em>, she thought. But she was feeling sentimental after seeing Marlene and Dorcas, and her resolve was weak. Against her better judgment, she pulled the book from the bookshelf and sat with it on the sofa.</p>
<p>It was a scrapbook she'd made during her last year of Hogwarts, before Lord Voldemort had fallen. She'd gotten a magical camera for her seventeenth birthday and had proceeded to document nearly every aspect of her life, fascinated by the moving photographs. Most of the pictures were of her friends — Marlene featured prominently, as did Mary — but there were a few photos of teachers, and the occasional artistic shot of the castle, as well.</p>
<p>She turned the page and paused. There it was. A photograph of her and James Potter, their arms around each other. They beamed at the camera, Head Boy and Girl badges pinned to their robes. The James Potter in the picture winked up at her, then kissed the Lily in the photograph on the cheek.</p>
<p>She shut the scrapbook. What was she doing, pining after James Potter? Why was she worried about him? He'd surely forgotten all about her. And even if he hadn't, he probably remembered her as the mad witch he'd dated at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Lily cringed to think of the way she'd treated him after her mum had died. Grief had made her wild with anger, irrational. She'd broken up with him over a vase of sunflowers, of all things.</p>
<p>After her mum's funeral, Lily had gotten it in her head that she needed a vase of sunflowers to remember her by — they'd been her mother's favourite. But sunflowers didn't grow in December, so she'd tried to Transfigure some, and James had said that wasn't how Transfiguration worked.</p>
<p>So she'd picked a row with him, because her mum had died and she was <em>furious</em> about it, but James didn't back down. He'd said she was being ridiculous, that he'd help her with the flowers if she'd just calm down, and she'd said she <em>was</em> calm, that the problem was <em>him</em>, that she couldn't stand him and never had.</p>
<p>It wasn't true, but she'd had quite a temper back then, and grief had only heightened her worst impulses. Their row had woken half of Gryffindor tower, and when they had finished they were no longer on speaking terms with each other.</p>
<p>It was a stupid reason to break up, looking back on it. James had only been trying to help. And she'd paid the consequences for letting her temper get the better of her; the other Gryffindors had sided with James in the break up, except for Marlene. The only time they would talk to her would be to invite her the Order meetings they attended.</p>
<p>She'd found the gesture meaningless, at the time: the Order had been James' thing, and she didn't think she'd be welcome, if she showed up. Her last term at Hogwarts had been very lonely.</p>
<p>Lily placed the scrapbook back on the shelf and extinguished the fire with a wave of her wand. It was getting late; she'd surely regret her trip down memory lane when she had to wake up for work in the morning. But she couldn't get the image of the Potters' cottage, dark and silent, out of her mind.</p>
<p><em>Maybe he's forgiven me for being so mental</em>, she thought as she crawled into bed.<em> Now that he's lost his parents too</em>.</p>
<p>That didn't make her feel better, though. It only made her sad.</p>
