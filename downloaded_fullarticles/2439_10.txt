          <div class="userstuff"><p>In your sixth year, you date an exchange student from Beauxbatons named Apolline. She’s half-veela and stunning, with a waterfall of white-blonde hair and a protuberance of cheekbones sharp enough to slice through your self-esteem. Looking at her head on is startling, in the same way that staring into the sun makes you dizzy and blurry-eyed.</p><p>The sex is good, but what starts off as a possessive edge morphs into full-blown craziness by Christmas, so you tell her you’re not one for relationships. She retaliates by gutting open your left kneecap with Remus’ silver dagger — you’re pretty sure he hasn’t cleaned it since cutting up sophorous beans in Potions — and you dispassionately wonder what else he’s used it for. You try and mend the wound yourself, but you’ve always been better at spells that blast things apart in lieu of putting them back together, so you limp up to the hospital wing to become Madam Pomfrey’s latest problem. </p><p>Remus and James come to visit you. Remus is convinced that combining Muggle Sciences with Arithmancy is going to change the state of the world, but so far all he’s managed to do is conjure up multidimensional pink soap bubbles that float around the room. You accidentally set one on fire when you sneeze. James hands you a slab of Honeyduke’s chocolate, and asks for your opinion on  seducing Lily Evans.</p><p>You tell him he needs to get laid to take his mind off Evans. You offer up Apolline along with the potential of kinky knife play, mostly as a joke. Remus is distracted long enough that the bubbles morph into gigantic, galloping golden horses.</p><p>“Fuck you, Sirius,” James says, with affection.</p><p>You lie in your hospital bed with your knee steadily leaking pus and watch the horse-bubbles canter around the room. You’re only sixteen years old, but Apolline isn’t the first girl to knife you. You used to think that you liked girls with darkness to them, because darkness was your birthright, because all you’d ever known was your mother blasting holes in the family tapestry, and your cousin Bellatrix, laughing maniacally while she made Muggles scream, peeling the skin away from their bones as effectively as if she were unwrapping a sweet wrapper. </p><p>Raised in a gigantic, musty mausoleum that stank of ancient, unforgivable curses, you were unused to bright things when you first came to Hogwarts. Even now, six years later, you’ve taken to conjuring pieces of tinted glasses to hover in front of your eyes and shield them from the glare when you watch James on the Quidditch pitch. Sometimes, you hex them to repeatedly chant <i>eat shit slytherin</i> whenever Mulciber approaches the goalposts, and you laugh like a maniac until Lily Evans punches you in the shoulder.</p><p>Days later, the bruises come in blue and delicate, spaced out near your scapula in the shape of her fingers.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>You goof off in the Astronomy Tower instead of applying yourself to classes, but you still ace your O.W.Ls because you’re something of an expert in matters of the cosmos.<p>Wizards have bones made from calcium, iron running through the blood in their veins and nitrogen in their brains. This feels especially true of your family. The Blacks have a habit of naming their children after stars — it’s just another quirky idiosyncrasy for which your family is known — along with rampant instability, Dark Magic association, and a deeply unhealthy obsession with Pure Blood status. </p><p>You are named after the Dog Star, the brightest star in the Canis Major constellation. Your brother Regulus Arcturus Black bears the names of two stars: Regulus, the brightest star in the Leo constellation, and Arcturus, of the Bootes constellation. Your cousin Bellatrix derives her name from one of the shoulder stars in the constellation Orion, which literally translates to <i>female warrior</i>. </p><p>You confront the aptness of this years later, on the day that she faces you down in the Department of Mysteries, wild-haired, teeth bared, the <i>Avada Kedavra</i> a latent snarl in the back of her throat.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>In your seventh year, James finally wears Lily down enough that she actually agrees to go on a date with him. When he staggers back into the dorm, nearly 24 hours later, you raise an eyebrow.<p>“Oi, Prongs. How was your little sex marathon?”</p><p>James collapses on the four-poster. You get a retelling of the date in bits and pieces that starts with her dorm decor (glow in the dark constellation stars) and ends with a long-winded segue extolling her bravery and goodness (Mulciber keeps trying to recruit her to the Death Eater cause; she’s repeatedly turned him down).</p><p>“I’m going to marry her, Sirius,” James tells you, his eyes glazed with exhaustion and post-coital bliss. “She just doesn’t know it yet.”</p><p>“Well, maybe don’t lead with that mate,” you respond bleakly, breath rasping. “Wouldn’t want to scare her away.”</p><p>For a minute, you worry James will see the cracked and hollow pieces of you, that he will ask jokingly, <i>why so serious, Sirius?</i> You were always shit at Occlumency, but you grew up in a deeply violent family, so you know all about compartmentalizing. On the exhale of your next breath, you stuff all the black and grasping things into the cavern of your chest, embedding them into the bones of your ribcage. They spear you, just a little. When you breathe in, all that buried emotion punctures your lungs gently, sadistically.</p><p>When you feel it’s safe to hazard a glance back at James, he’s fast asleep, sprawled across the bed and snoring lightly. You think of Lily, lying in her own bed and staring up at the cheap, plastic stars on her dorm ceiling. </p><p>You hate yourself for wondering whether any of her stars form the shape of the constellation for which you were named.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>The first time you ever really notice her is fifth year.<p>You and James have just taken the Defense Against the Dark Arts exam, and you’re celebrating the last of your O.W.Ls by hexing Snivellus. Everyone is down by the Great Lake. It’s June, so hot even the bugs are circling in slow arcs. The sky is cloudless; the surface of the lake clear and smooth and glittering under the sun’s glow. </p><p>Gideon Prewett is cheering while James washes out Snape’s mouth with <i>scourgify</i>. Snape isn’t well-liked, but for you, the enmity runs deeper. He’s the kind of son your mother would have been proud of: a mini Regulus, a Dark Arts lover, a Voldemort follower. He’s everything you tried to separate yourself from, everything you’re still afraid of becoming. You tell yourself James is your tether to goodness, to light — and what does it matter right now if James is acting like a bully, because it’s only Snivellus; after all, he deserves this —</p><p>“Expulso,” you add lazily to James’ incantations. </p><p>Snape is jolted backwards, his body haloed in blue light, his head cracking unnaturally against one of the huge birch trees ringing the Great Lake. Blood drips from his nose onto his school robes.</p><p>“Leave him the fuck alone, Black.”</p><p>Somehow, your surname sounds different in her mouth than it ever has before. You hear the sharp <i>ck</i> sound of the words <i>fuck</i> and <i>Black</i> and your mind turns obscene, picturing her doing those things, picturing her tongue flicking against her teeth. You imagine what she tastes like.</p><p>In the sunlight, Lily’s hair is such a dark red, it looks bloody. When you hesitate, her almond-shaped eyes narrow, cat-like, to slits. Her smile is a challenge, a single-sided serrated blade. </p><p>You’ve never known anyone to stand up for Snivellus before, especially when it means standing up to you and James.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>You dream about her for the first time that night. In your dream, she’s wearing the black lace lingerie and combat boots you saw in the Muggle porno last week. When she sees you, she whispers your name the same way she did at the lake, the sharp ck sound flicking her tongue against her teeth.<p>When she kisses you, all your overloaded nerves light up, making it feel less like a kiss and more of a moment of impact, like shattered glass or shrapnel should be floating around you in slow-motion. </p><p>Your hands shift to her jaw as you kiss her back. She tastes less sweet than you imagined she would. She tastes metallic and cool, like a Muggle weapon before being fired. It drives you crazy. She brackets your mouth with her thumbs, pulls your lips apart and bites down, canines sinking into your lower lip. </p><p>Last week, McGonagall transfigured a rabbit into a hedgehog and it made a noise between a moan and a snarl; this is what comes of our mouth now. You press your body to Lily’s. You put one hand on the curve of her hip, and the other on the slope of her neck. Underneath your palm, her bones feel slim and fragile. Blood and breath thrash between the two of you.</p><p>You wake up sweaty and frantic and guilty and achingly hard.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>Sometimes, you wonder whether Remus knows.<p>In the Great Hall, you watch James butter a piece of toast for Lily. She takes a bite, smearing her nose with butter. He licks it off, laughing, and she makes a face you’ve never seen before — scrunched up eyes, wrinkled nose — the expression of someone totally disarmed and at ease.</p><p>The moment wriggles its way through the steel barricades you’ve erected in your chest, worms its way up into the soft underbelly of your stupid, treacherous heart. You stab yourself in the hand with the prongs of your fork. You think no one notices, but when you look up, Remus is staring at you. You ask <i>what, Moony</i> and roll your eyes at him, but he only says, <i>you tell me, Sirius</i> in that solemn way of his. </p><p>You’re lucky because just then, Gideon Prewett gets a Howler and the whole Hall is suddenly full of his grandmother’s voice, ranting furiously about his appallingly low N.E.W.Ts. James is sufficiently distracted. Just as you twist in your seat to look over at Gideon, you see Snivellus’s face down at the Slytherin table, squashed in between Malfoy and McNair. </p><p>He’s staring at James’ hand curled loosely at Lily’s waist, and you know instinctively that his expression is mirrored on your face too, like you’re both bearing wounds inflicted by the same wand.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>In seventh year, Amycus Carrow hexes James so badly that he ends up in the hospital wing for a week. After swearing your revenge to an unconscious James, you trick Amycus away from his Slytherin cronies, land a nice <i>petrificus totalus</i> that fully immobilizes him, and sneak him up to the Astronomy Tower under cover of the Invisibility Cloak.<p>It’s windy when you push him right to the very edge of the parapet. A stone creaks ominously under Amycus’s weight. The wind screams in your ears and batters your chapped cheeks. You lick raw lips. Five hundred feet below you, the world beckons in a muted watercolor smear of color. </p><p>Amycus can’t do anything but mouth soundlessly, his pupils huge and distorted in his white face. </p><p>“Hey,” you choke out, “You ever touch James again, this is how I’ll kill you.”</p><p>For good measure, you leave him up there for a couple hours until the spell wears off.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>You have different surnames, but it doesn’t stop people from asking whether you and James are related.<p>Beyond the physical resemblance, the two of you have an intimate history of barreling headlong after each other, often to the other’s detriment. James can’t swim, but it didn’t stop him from leaping into the Great Lake after you when you played a joke on the merpeople that went awry. He’s shit at Care of Magical Creatures, but he still took on an acromantula so you could get away, after Malfoy lured you into the Forbidden Forest under false pretenses.</p><p>There isn’t anything you wouldn’t do for James, and that includes Lily Evans.</p><p><i>Cut James with a pocketknife</i>, your classmates like to say, <i>and Sirius will bleed</i>.</p><p>Your immutable sense of loyalty means that you could never suspect your friends. It’s why, after you hear about James and Lily’s deaths, you hunt Peter down like the dog you are. You feel like the two of them kept you closely anchored to the best parts of your humanity; without them, you are cut adrift, more Animagus than ever. For you, there is no reality in which Voldemort could have ever gone after your friends that didn’t end with you throwing your body in front of him, brandishing your wand for battle, screaming, <i>Lily, James — take Harry and run — I’ll hold him off.</i></p><p>You learn later: that’s what actually happened. Except it was James, and not you, who tried to hold off Voldemort. It was James who took the killing curse full in the face, and Lily who shielded Harry with her body, screaming <i>no, please, he’s just a baby, have mercy, please, take me instead —</i></p><p>You weren’t there, but you hear them screaming still, whenever you try to sleep.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>When Peter transforms, you’re standing at the corner of Regent Street. Blood paints the sidewalk red, drips down into the gutter, runs horizontally across the bodies sprawled at the intersection. People are screaming and the noise ricochets inside your skull like Filibuster’s fireworks, like the time you and James set off Whiz-Bangs in the Great Hall.<p>Your wand feels sticky, gripped in your sweaty palm. </p><p>By the time the Ministry arrives, you’re laughing, you’re fucking <i>laughing</i>, because the last thread of your sanity has been pulled loose, because you’re <i>glad</i> they’re here to take you away, because you’re not interested in living anymore, not if means living without the two people you’d loved more than anything in the world.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>Fifteen years later, you’re sitting with your godson at Grimmauld Place. Harry is absently brandishing a knife emblazoned with the Black family crest, digging the edges of it into the table. You can see the <i>p</i> of <i>toujours pur</i> where it hits the light and refracts it.<p>“Sirius,” he asks, “Will you tell me about my parents? What were they like?”</p><p>You’re happy to tell him about James, how he was the best friend anyone could ever ask for, how after your awful mother accused you of maraudering around with your no-good friends that you adopted the moniker of marauders as a badge of honor. You tell Harry about the tricks you used to play together, how James wasn’t just a friend to you, but a brother, realer and truer than Regulus.</p><p>“And my mother?” Harry asks. Set in his vivid, young face, his eyes are a bright green, and it makes you think of that long-ago day at the lake. </p><p>
  <i>Leave him the fuck alone, Black.</i>
</p><p><i>Pop</i> goes the knife into the table.</p><p>You swallow. You can’t bear to even tarnish James’ memory with the way you felt about Lily, so you lie and tell their son, <i>where I loved James like a brother, I loved Lily like a sister.</i></p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>This is what imminent death does: it simplifies things.<p>Bellatrix’s curse hits your chest in a spurt of green wildfire. <i>Female warrior,</i> you remember. You look at Harry’s agonized face and see Lily in his eyes, see James in everything else, hear both of them in your head.</p><p>
  <i>Padfoot, how we’ve missed you.</i>
</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-------</p>
</center>When you are in fifth year, some time after the lake incident, you get in a fight with Mulciber, who cuts you up with <i>sectumsempra.</i><p>He runs off, scared of the dark magic he unleashed in the heat of the moment, so you stagger up to the castle and run into Lily, who’s uncharacteristically alone. </p><p>“Black? Who did this to you?”</p><p>You collapse against her, blood leaking from the cut around your waist. No, not a cut. A slice. A chunk of you, removed.</p><p>“Mulciber,” you mutter. “Git.”</p><p>Lily puts her arm around you in support, helping you rise to your feet. “He is a git,” she agrees easily. Cool fingertips brush your wrist. Her nails are bitten short, little half-moon cuticles.  “Will you come with me? Let me take you to the hospital wing.”</p><p>As far as your mother is concerned, you are abandoned property, no longer a reflection of the great and noble House of Black. You are infinitely more Potter than you are Black, but you always thought your choices were to leave your house or stay with James. You didn’t realize there was a third option, this beautiful girl with her green eyes and her fingers on your wrist, asking <i>will you come with me?</i></p><p>You’re struck all over again by how she looks at you, how she tears into you, like she’s vivisecting your organs with her gaze. Your liver, your heart, your brain — they all belong to her, now. </p><p>(You still have a liver, right? You think so. Something has to process all the alcohol).</p><p>At your back, the sun is a cold, metallic disc and it limns Lily’s face in light. Your heart is beating high up in your throat. Her face is so close to your face that you can make out individual eyelashes, and the slight clump of mascara under her right eye.</p><p>Her lips are right next to your lips. You could do it. You could alter the course of your life forever by pressing your mouth to hers, just to gauge her reaction. You wonder whether she’d curl into you, like she’s doing now, or whether she’d turn away. </p><p>You could do it though, and the wanting buzzes dully in your skull, burns in the back of your throat, hot and strong and fiercer than Firewhisky.</p><p>You don’t, though.</p><p>Because James is the better man, by far.</p></div>
