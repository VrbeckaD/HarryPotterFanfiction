    <p>Draco Malfoy sat sheltered on his bed, the green curtains keeping him separate from the rest of the room.  He was pleased to be out of sight, knowing that his father would be less than pleased to see his current position – huddled under his blanket, a spare pillow clutched to his chest. Even in the dark, he knew his eyes were open too wide, his mouth set in a fierce, almost painful, frown. He found himself rocking slightly and had to force himself to stop.</p>
<p>School had only been in session for a few weeks, and already his fifth year was not going as planned. Watching the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Dolores Umbridge snipe against Potter and his group was a riot. However, her unfortunate teaching methods meant that he wasn't learning anything. Class after class of silently reading the text books. No practical demonstrations, no answers for questions. Any and all questions were given a slightly mocking reply of “Look in the book, dear. The answers are there.”</p>
<p>How could he be expected to do well on his OWLS if a professor refused to teach the material? They had already had four sub-par professors! Well, perhaps not Professor Lupin, but that man was definitely biased against Slytherins.</p>
<p>Draco snorted to himself. How is that a surprise? He thought. Almost all Hogwarts professors are.</p>
<p>No one was stepping in to stop Umbridge. It was as if the other teachers had simply washed their hands of the course and what happened in there. At least Professor Snape arranged for private tutoring within Slytherin. Draco just wasn't sure if it would be enough. </p>
<p>While the school situation was worrying, what had him more concerned was the activities of the Dark Lord. Amelia Brontly was marked over the summer – only a day or two after her sixteenth birthday.</p>
<p>She had shown it to the children of other Death Eaters, Draco included, as an attempt to make them jealous. Draco had made the appropriate noises, but in the privacy of his own mind he wasn't jealous.</p>
<p>He was terrified.</p>
<p>He would be sixteen at the end of the school year and he already knew his father wanted him marked as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It was easier before... well. It was easier before the Dark Lord came back. When all Draco had to do was not embarrass the family name and lord his wealth and breeding over those who were inferior.</p>
<p>Now, though. Now he's seen both his father and godfather clutch at their forearms, pain written across their faces. He thinks there have been times that his father returned to the manor covered in his own blood, baring scars from the curses the Dark Lord had hurled at him.</p>
<p>The meager proof he had was in the hushed conversations that stopped when he entered a room, the addition of potions to his father's breakfast, even the way the house elves seemed more solicitous towards the older Malfoy. His father was very strict with the house elves; they knew their places and rarely stepped out of them. But those mornings when Lucius walked a little slower or leaned on his cane a little harder – those were the mornings the house elves would be even quicker and quieter. </p>
<p>His father and Uncle Severus were among the Dark Lord's most faithful followers. Both had continued to search for ways to bring him back, long after others had given up. If the Dark Lord could torture them, what would he do to their children?</p>
<p>At the moment, Amelia is full of pride and eager to gloat about being allowed to attend Death Eater meetings. She has kept many of the older Slytherins enthralled with her stories of the few raids she was allowed to take part in. The younger students stare after her, a mixture of awe and fear in their eyes.</p>
<p>But Draco knows it will not last. Death Eaters get missions. Right now, Amelia's mission is to make being a Death Eater sound like the greatest thing since chocolate cake. All she has to do is convince a handful of students that the Dark Lord wants to help them. </p>
<p>She'll be questioned over Christmas break. They'll demand answers she may not be able to give. She'll receive the Dark Lord's disappointed look. A look Draco has been oh so fortunate to see, despite not being a Death Eater.</p>
<p>When they return in the new year, Amelia will start campaigning for converts more aggressively. She'll want at least five students to agree to get the mark once school has ended.</p>
<p>She won't bother with him. It's already assumed that he'll take the mark and his place by the Dark Lord's side, just as his father and grandfather had.</p>
<p>He just isn't sure that's what he wants.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*****</p>
</center> <p>Despite his house being the most hated in the school, it's amazing what they can get away with. For all the eyes that follow them through the hallways and classrooms, as long as there were no outward moves toward violence or hexes, no one cared.</p>
<p>Within the house, Draco has a unique position. His father's money and connection to the Dark Lord means he's accorded far more respect than he has probably ever deserved. His relationship with Professor Snape doesn't hurt either. </p>
<p>As long as Draco is smart and doesn't do anything to draw attention to himself, he can do as he pleases.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is difficult to not bait Potter. Sometimes, he has to in order to not bring attention to himself.</p>
<p>Everyone expects them to bicker and he's always played to an audience.</p>
<p>This week is going according to plan. He's had his spat with Potter, made a rude comment to Granger, and insulted the Weasel's family. His homework is done, with no detentions or loss of points so far. He can hide in the library researching.</p>
<p>At his table, he was surrounded by old newspapers. Once he had realized he wasn't sure if he wanted to follow the Dark Lord, he realized he needed more information. Information that he probably would not get from anyone who already wore the mark. He had briefly considered talking to those who opposed the Dark Lord, but quickly decided their suspicions meant he was unlikely to get what he wanted.</p>
<p>Nor could he get the information from The Prophet. All the newspapers around him were from either the Continent or the Americas. </p>
<p>Pulling out a piece of parchment, he idly checked the nib on his quill as he thought about what he wanted to look for. Having a list would make his research a little easier. He already knew the beliefs of the Death Eaters: Muggles bad, Purebloods good, all hail Lord Voldemort, the Ministry is stupid, Potter is stupid, etc. He knew that the Dark Lord's goal was to rule over the Wizarding World and to enforce all those wonderful beliefs.</p>
<p>He needed to look at names, he jotted that down quickly, dates and locations too. The Death Eaters went on raids, but what was the goal of those raids? They didn't need money or supplies. Was it only to make people afraid? How would that help in taking over the world?</p>
<p>Holding his quill up, Draco realized that beyond that, he didn't know what to look for. Perhaps, he decided, it would be better to just look.</p>
<p>A firm nod and he put his quill aside and picked up the oldest newspaper from the stack. This was from the seventies and published in France. A quiet word of thanks to his mother that it was a language he understood, he began to read.</p>
<p>Several hours later, he had read maybe half the newspapers he had collected. He had found the information he needed. He just had to decide what to do with it. A quick check told him he had a little less than an hour until supper. </p>
<p>He bundled up the newspapers and put away his parchment and quill. Another quick look to make sure he hadn't forgotten anything, and he headed towards Madam Pince's desk.</p>
<p>On his way there, he passed by the table used by Potter and his group. They were furiously whispering to each other, but stopped completely and stared at him as he passed.</p>
<p>Unobserved, he rolled his eyes and continued on his way. Once he turned at a bookshelf, he could hear them talking again.</p>
<p>At Madam Pince's desk, a polite request that she hold onto his newspaper collection so he could continue his research was met with a tight smile.</p>
<p>The librarian was hardly a nice woman; she preferred her books over just about everything else. Draco had learned early on that all she wanted was for students to be polite, quiet, and not damage anything in her domain. He did his best to follow those rules. Because of that, they got along as well as they possibly could.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*****</p>
</center><p>It was a week or so before Draco could return to his research. Madam Pince passed him his papers and he went off to his table.</p>
<p>Again, he passed Potter's table. This time, Potter had his head down on the table while Granger hissed at the Weasel. She stopped abruptly and glared at him as he passed.</p>
<p>As he arranged the table to his specification, he pondered why. Then he realized that not only were Quidditch try-outs this week for Gryffindor, he hadn't done anything remotely nasty towards the trio since the week before. Oh well, he'll have to fix that at breakfast.</p>
<p>But now, he thought, rubbing his hands together, more research.</p>
<p>He reached for the newspaper on the top, one from Germany. As he pulled it towards him, a bit of parchment fluttered out and landed on the table. Curious, he pulled it towards him.</p>
<p>The note was written by Madam Pince, a sight not many were able to see; but Draco had been on the woman's good side for years.</p>
<p>Try Special Editions of The Prophet from 1979-1982.</p>
<p>No signature, but the P was quite distinct. </p>
<p>He smiled slightly and put the note in his pocket. Looking for those editions will be for another day. For now, he had a stack of German newspapers to attempt to translate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*****</p>
</center><p>In the end, he spent a month researching the Dark Lord and Death Eaters in various newspapers from around the world.</p>
<p>It did not look good. It looked nothing like the glorious stories that his father told him at bedtime.</p>
<p>With the tip from Madam Pince, he was able to piece together a better picture of what it was like living through those times. The special editions contained more information, and often the only information, on the Dark Lord and his activities.</p>
<p>So much blood, death, and needless destruction. For what purpose? Gaining converts should not be done so violently, it just scares away anyone with potential.</p>
<p>He was deep in thought as he sat in the stands to watch the first Quidditch game of the year, Ravenclaw versus Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>Around him Slytherins booed and hissed both teams. None of them wanted Hufflepuff to win, but Hufflepuff would be an easier team for them to beat than Ravenclaw. To be fair, the Slytherins took turns berated the two teams.</p>
<p>Draco had enough piece of mind to follow Pansy's lead on cheering, but otherwise, he was too absorbed in his thoughts.</p>
<p>The game was over before Draco realized it. It wasn't until they were walking back to the dungeons that he learned Ravenclaw won. Luckily, his friends were busy tearing apart their offense and insulting their seeker to pay any attention to Draco's lack of attention.</p>
<p>Supper was a loud affair, the Hufflepuffs were cheerfully teasing the Ravenclaws, everyone else joined in teasing the Hufflepuffs.</p>
<p>It was one of the few times that the school felt as warm and welcoming as it claimed to.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*****</p>
</center> <p>That night, hidden within his bed, Draco pulled out his research. He had found that while Death Eaters were not required to kill someone in order to take the mark; they were encouraged to do some heavy damage, either to a muggle or muggle-born.</p>
<p>According to the list of names that he had put together, several pureblood families had been wiped out by the so-called pro-pureblood factions during the first war.</p>
<p>He still could not figure out why. The families didn't have money or heirlooms that would have been useful. All they had was a single vote in the Wizengamot. Taking out that vote could theoretically turn the tides of all future laws. However, buying the families off, threatening them, or blackmailing them could be acceptable and achieve the same result.</p>
<p>The more he read and learned, the more he realized he did not want to be a Death Eater. He did not want to follow a man who took pleasure in torturing his followers and murdering innocent people. </p>
<p>But how could Draco avoid it? His father was a Death Eater. His mother did as she was told. There were no other close relatives-</p>
<p>He froze.</p>
<p>There was one person that he could go to, although the response may not be in his favor. </p>
<p>His mother's cousin.</p>
<p>Sirius Black.</p>
