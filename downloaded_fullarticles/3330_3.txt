    <p>
  <span>There’s an odd stillness to the hall. It comes in the empty seats, the missing students, in the odd Slytherin with parents with certain names clutching their arm and the armed guard that escort them through the gates. It comes in the open knowledge that there is a Dark Lord rising.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Have you seen him,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the whispers ask, </span>
  <em>
    <span>he’s like a snake with red eyes and white skin and he’ll suck out your soul if you say his true name.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron wants to scoff at those rumours, but the truth is despite everything he can’t get the name past his lips. His parents kick him out of meetings when the Order comes around, citing he’s too young. He is, he knows he is, but the truth of the matter is that if he’s being kicked out for being too young, then there should be someone beside him who is younger and there just </span>
  <em>
    <span>isn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not anymore. Ginny is dead and Harry is gone, long assumed dead, and Ron skulks through the empty rooms of an escaped prisoner alone. There are certain things in people’s lives that change people. Breaking through a rockfall at thirteen and stumbling through into a chamber containing the corpse of a dead basilisk, a bloodied sword and the dead body of his little sister is one of those things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione drops down next to him, Neville on his other side and he greets them, feeling slightly less alone now he’s no longer at home or Order Headquarters among the ghosts. He tunes most of the mindless babble out, filtering for the important facts regarding the so called Lord’s rise to power.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(Somewhere Cedric Diggory’s skeleton lies in a graveyard and elsewhere there are pieces of a smashed prophecy orb, unheard until the end. As much as things change, some things just don’t.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m still hoping Dumbledore makes Snape the new Defence teacher,” Ron says, as Hermione goes through the change in staffing, “That way we’ll finally be rid of him.” Neville looks almost thrilled at the result and Hermione just hits him with her dessert spoon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s nobody up there,” she says, “Maybe Dumbledore’s doing it himself?” she sounds oddly helpful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No way,” Ron says, stuffing a spoon of crumble into his mouth, “He taught Transfiguration, didn’t ‘e?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He took down Grindelwald, though,” Hermione says, “And they say he duelled Voldemort to a standstill at the Ministry last summer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron shudders at the name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(Neither of them had been at the Ministry, because they’d been too busy overthrowing Umbridge to worry about what had been going on outside Hogwarts’ walls.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh,” Neville says, “He’s going to tell us now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore doesn’t even have to clap to get the hall to fall silent. Everyone is paying attention to him already as spoons drop and faces turn as he steps up to the podium. “Welcome back,” he says with a smile that is as grim as it is kind. “These are indeed trying times but it warms my heart to see everyone here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron will give the old man one thing, he does still know how to hold a crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I promise,” Dumbledore says, “That while under my roof I will do my utmost to keep the politics of the outside world out of your education. You are safe within this school. Outside it I cannot say the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Safe?” a Hufflepuff whispers, “Like Cedric Diggory was </span>
  <em>
    <span>safe</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Like Ginny Weasley was </span>
  <em>
    <span>safe</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron flinches.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Dumbledore hears he makes no sign of it, “Once again,” he says, cheerfully, “I must ask that you take note of Mr Filch’s list of Forbidden Items, which has expanded to include any product bought from Fred or George Weasley.” There are a chorus of groans accompanying this, “And please refrain from entering the Forbidden Forest. It is the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Forbidden </span>
  </em>
  <span>Forest for a reason.” There is a slight tittering of weak laughs. “I am also… </span>
  <em>
    <span>pleased--</span>
  </em>
  <span>” he doesn’t sound pleased, “To inform you that our Defence post has once again been filled. He appears to be a bit late--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door to the Great Hall slams open and every single student jumps, spinning around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah,” Dumbledore says, brightly, “May I introduce Tom Riddle, your new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron’s heart skips a beat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom Riddle.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tom Riddle? No, that’s not possible, he thinks, and the figure at the doorway isn’t white-skinned or red-eyed, in fact Ron would almost mistake him for a Hogwarts’ student himself except--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The new arrival just has a </span>
  <em>
    <span>presence</span>
  </em>
  <span> that demands to be focussed on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He's </span>
  <em>
    <span>teaching?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Dumbledore </span>
  <em>
    <span>let him?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“The </span>
  <em>
    <span>politician</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” a Ravenclaw whispers, but someone shakes their head, the name unfamiliar, strange to most except those who know who he really is except--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This young man - boy, practically - is clearly not. Dumbledore would never, especially after that little speech. Looking at their new teacher as he steps into the hall with the utmost confidence and grace Ron hates him instantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom Riddle is perfect. Lethal stride, confidence in every line of his body. His dark hair is neatly brushed through with a slight flick even this new staff member for all his perfect poise can't sort. His face is handsome, elegant, lips thin and a cruel look about them. He looks no older than a sixth year, and whispers break out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice of you to join us, To--” the headmaster chokes. Actually stumbles through saying the new arrival’s name and the hall just kind of stops when their gazes slide past Tom Riddle to the person nobody noticed before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He's shorter than Riddle, hair just as black but scattered and windswept. His gaze is ducked, so Ron doesn't notice at first, not until he's near enough to see the green eyes streaked unnaturally with gold and the lightning bolt scar across his forehead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore’s eyes stay fixed on Harry Potter for a long moment before tearing free to look at Riddle. Riddle just smirks, continuing his walk up to the staff table. Halfway up Harry peels off, and if he can feel the stares he makes no note of it, coming to a slow halt by Ron and Neville.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry is older. That’s the first thing Ron thinks about and he’s an idiot, of course Harry’s older. It’s been over three years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he’s still thin, his eyes still too-green, hair too-messy and there’s a roughness in him now that reminds Ron of an alley cat or of a near-starved wolf. A desperation. There is a pale pink scar curling up Harry’s cheek, more across his collarbone and eyes that dart around marking out escape routes and always aware of where Riddle is at all times.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron hasn't seen his best friend in three years. He’d thought Harry was dead. In his head he had planned what he’d do had Harry been alive, if he ever saw him again. They range from punching him to hexing him to accusations over Ginny's death.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>None of them involved him silently moving, offering up space on the bench for Harry to slip into. The whole hall is watching, but only Ron is close enough to see the tired eyes, the tense posture, the relief present when a space is offered up to him. Harry doesn't smile at him. He doesn't say anything. He ignores the world around him, right up until he doesn't, head snapping up to the staff table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lovely to be here, Professor,” Riddle says, smiling charmingly around at the hall, “I’m looking forward to this year. I’m sure it will be…” he takes his time picking a word, “Enlightening,” he settles on. Riddle is standing there, smirking, and Harry's gaze meets Riddle's for a moment, holding it steadily. There is no fear in them, Ron observes, no deference, just a blank, odd kind of understanding he can’t explain before Harry turns away, an odd burning anger and obedience hidden in his movements and expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And suddenly Ron knows without a doubt who Tom Riddle is, what he did, and why Dumbledore let him teach this year, even if the name hadn’t already given most of it away already.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron's never hoped more for the curse on the Defence position to work before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry knows full well what Stockholm Syndrome is. He knows he has probably got it in spades. He had been twelve, he hadn’t been stupid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Survival is a game Harry had almost forgotten how to play wearing red and gold and eating a full meal every night. Tom Riddle is another game, a new, terrifying, life-threatening game that he has to learn how to play all over again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For all his near death experiences in his short life he’s never come as close yet far away as he has in the past three years. For someone whose worst fear is Death, Tom walks side by side with it, it oozes off him, clings to him like the Dark Magic he loves so. Harry knows more than a bit has rubbed off on him; there’s really nothing to be done about that. He’s already wasted too much energy fighting and protesting it. Tom is Death walking and therefore Harry follows in Death’s shadow; it’s only appropriate, all things considered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even the certainty that Tom can’t take that last step to ridding himself of Harry doesn’t guarantee anything. Tom skirts the edge of the death, and therefore Harry must too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As much as he disliked the Dursley’s he always felt strangely grateful to them because the not-quite-Dark Lord honestly wasn’t much worse than growing up with them had been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom Riddle is not Voldemort, no matter what one such as Albus Dumbledore might be inclined to tell him. Voldemort had been a wraith, a mad man, and mad men do not care for the life and lies of a twelve-year old boy, only for his death. Tom Riddle had also been a wraith, and now he is less of one, but he is neither mad nor quite a man no matter how many murders he has under his belt and he does not want Harry dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom Riddle is not Voldemort, no matter what Tom himself will tell Harry. Voldemort is a name, a title he has carved out for himself for someone else to use. It’s tarnished and has lost the shiny newness Tom is still under the illusion it holds. Tom knows better now. Harry knows better now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, Tom Riddle is not Voldemort, and that makes him all the more terrifying, yet all the more human and that’s all Harry needs to find a foothold and stay standing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Don’t get him wrong - it wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>nice</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tom </span>
  </em>
  <span>isn’t nice. Harry knows what the Cruciatus feels like. Extensively. He knows and has experienced Tom’s wrath first hand. He’s got the scars to prove it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet he’s alive, still breathing (no matter how close he’ll stray Tom won’t cross that line into Death, can’t won’t Harry’s not sure what the line is, but he knows it’s Not An Option). He’s also had something akin to a Hogwarts education. Not a full one, and it’s oddly extensive in certain areas and non-existant in others, but it’s indisputable that slipping into the sixth year classroom he knows the material. He won’t stand out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except, of course, in all the ways that count.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron is pale next to him. They haven’t spoken. Harry hasn’t really spoken to anyone, and Minerva McGonagall squints at him, probably wondering how he’d even found the class given he has no timetable and most people are still convinced he’s dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid,” she says, and to her credit her voice only wavers a little bit, “Mr Potter, being dead does not excuse the fact that I require at least an Exceeds Expe--” she stops talking when he silently holds out the parchment envelope. It’s got the official Ministry stamp on it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wizards really are idiots, Harry thinks, and then wants to hit himself for sounding like Tom. ‘James Evans’ is not even inventive, but it’s his signature and they’re his OWL grades no matter how dubiously Tom and him obtained them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see,” Minerva looks impressed. Harry wonders if she’d be less impressed if she knew the consequence of not achieving perfect grades with Tom around. “I’ll sort out your schedule,” she says, “For now, you and Mr Weasley should have similar classes, and Miss Granger for Arithmancy and Runes. I’ll send up an Owl Order catalogue for your textbooks--” she peers at the book on his desk, “Well,” she says, “For a newer edition than a copy that looks fifty years old.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She drops the envelope back on his desk and proceeds to teaching. Gazes pin themselves to him and Harry flips open his book, checking the title, finding the page and grabbing a notebook. Notes are already sprawled out there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There isn’t much else to do, caged in with a moody teenager.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or, maybe caged is the wrong word, neither was trapped. Well, Harry was trapped, Tom certainly wasn’t. Not at least in the way most people would think.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you’re alive,” Malfoy sneers as he follows Ron and Hermione to lunch. Draco steps out sideways to block the corridor, his two goons flanking him. Harry eyes them up, unafraid. Not much scares him nowadays. His boggart had been a Dementor for months the first time Tom and he had run into one. The day he realised his value to others was weighed less by the person he was and more by the soul entanglements he held, it changed to a small, innocuous black book with a burning hole through it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ironically it’s the same thing Tom’s turns into.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(That’s all they are. Voldemort wants Harry dead because he’s an enemy and Tom dead because he’s a horcrux. Dumbledore wants Harry dead because he’s a horcrux and Tom dead because he’s an enemy.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(They’re too alike for their own good, even before being forced to spend so long in each other’s company).</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Surprise,” Harry’s voice is oddly flat, “I can’t die.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s so used to Riddle, to Tom’s snort and dry ‘funny’ so he can throw something equally dry and witty back; it throws him a little when Draco just swaggers forwards. “Did you think it made you special? Running away and getting dragged back by some low-life politician? A no-name mudblood pushing through policies on the sly? What were you, his </span>
  <em>
    <span>pet</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why </span>
  <em>
    <span>yes</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Harry thinks, sort of. Then something else occurs to him and his head tilts to one side, “You don’t know who he is, do you?” he says and no, he realises, they don’t. Ron does from the way he bristles, Hermione too clearly, and of course Dumbledore does, McGonagall suspects of course she was at school when he was a prefect and Hagrid but--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s not a common thing. And Tom had kept a low profile because the last thing he had wanted was to be dragged back to his main part sooner than he wanted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(As it was when the inevitable dragging happened it worked out all the worst for everyone involved, except perhaps Harry who had only been present for the aftermath, for the near dead Tom and the wounds bleeding ink and the boy he’d barely managed to keep in one piece.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(Turns out Voldemort can’t even work with himself.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Malfoy blinks, “He’s a small time politician. Got some connection, made a few choice moves… oh, and he’s highly wanted by the Dark Lord. Probably top of his list before you showed your face - stupid move, you should have stayed hidden, kept that scarred forehead of yours under whatever rock you had found and-- HEY!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>During his monologue Malfoy had been gesturing emphatically, stalking forwards until he is well within Harry’s personal space, and he’d probably been about to shove Harry backwards in a mockery of their old fights except Harry’s hand - reflexes even better than his previous Seeker-skills had been - snatches out, grabbing Malfoy’s wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His left wrist. And underneath Malfoy’s robe Harry can feel the Dark Mark there </span>
  <em>
    <span>burn</span>
  </em>
  <span> at the touch of his magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy snatches his hand back, and Harry lets him, watching at he stumbles away. “You know what I think, Malfoy?” Harry asks, softly, “I think that I will mean more to the Dark Lord than you ever will. You’re nothing to him. An inconsequential speck on his boot, a conveniently way to get back at Daddy for fucking up and getting caught. Do you think he’d waiting with bated breath for you to succeed?” Harry scoffs, “Of course not. He’s got bigger things to worry about and the day you inevitably fail? Well, then he’ll send in someone far more competent than you ever will be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’ grows gradually redder throughout Harry’s words. He grabs for his wand, expression turning ugly and that’s when surprisingly Ron moves, stepping between Harry and Draco.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Back off, Malfoy,” Ron says, and he reminds Harry of one of his older brothers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s not afraid of Draco Malfoy. He’d almost been looking forward to the fight, someone other than Tom for a change and after three years their arguments are old and the outcome expected. This had been new, exciting and adrenaline rushing through him. He rocks back on his heels, and he can’t help but look smug as Malfoy fumes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll kill you!” Draco blusters, “You and your new guardian, Potter, you’re both </span>
  <em>
    <span>dead</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Do you hear me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bugger off, Malfoy,” Ron snaps again, and Malfoy does, whirling around with a robe twirl that would make Snape proud. Hermione sidesteps him as he strides off down the corridor, looking mildly reproachfully at Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You shouldn’t have antagonised him,” she says, “You know he’s been </span>
  <em>
    <span>marked</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shrugs. He knows. He also knows that if some misfortune befalls him from Malfoy’s direction then at least Tom will make his end fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>miserable</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione stares at him, eyes darting around and then she takes a small step forwards, “I’m glad you’re alive,” she says. She looks like she wants to hug him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you’re not petrified,” he says, because that had long been his last memory of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looks conflicted, nodding and then glancing at Ron and - oh, Harry realises, can see the problem. He clears his throat, “Ron,” he says, turning to his other best friend. The lanky ginger looks even more unsure about how to approach this than Hermione, “Listen,” Harry says, searching for the words. His social skills have only gone downhill spending so much time around Tom, and Tom doesn’t do anything vaguely resembling apologies, “About Ginny--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron freezes, and he’s so pale Harry can’t even see his freckles. Hermione squeaks and then shoves a hand in front of her mouth to stifle herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” he says, because what else can he say. It’s all he can do and it means nothing, but his friend appears to take comfort from those words, from knowing what happened to his best friend and sister while he remained trapped on one side of the rock fall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron broke through to find nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s always the not knowing that kills them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In his head </span>
  <em>
    <span>his scar</span>
  </em>
  <span> there is a piece of Tom Riddle that is buried under his skin, in his very soul. It echoes through his magic, practically purrs in proximity to Riddle and it wraps tendrils of power around his throat, under his collar and chokes him to silence and Harry’s still trapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He never did escape the Chamber. Not really.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Least you’re not dead too,” Ron says, gruffly, “And Riddle, well, he’ll get what’s coming to him, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Harry says, a snake in a lion’s fur and like a true Slytherin he’s lying through his teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus Dumbledore stands in front of a dead boy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry is older, gaunter but there’s still that same stubborn Gryffindor strength he’d seen in the boy of eleven who had once again faced his enemy. The boy won’t meet Albus’ gaze; there is no chance to slip in and read any surface thoughts to give him an idea about what the boy is thinking. No doubt Tom taught the boy Occlumency anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No doubt Tom taught the boy a lot of things. He can only dread what.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet at his core it is still Harry Potter standing there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take a seat,” he says, feeling his age, “Lemon drop?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, thank you,” Harry politely declines. Dumbledore eyes him with silent horror. The boy is quiet. Polite. From what he’s heard about the boy’s first week back he’s been a dream student. Slipped right back into Hogwarts’ ranks like he never even left except - oh, no, the signs are plain to see. He’s spent three years under Tom’s influence and although he hides it well this is not the twelve year old boy who raced so recklessly into the Chamber all those years ago to save his best friend’s sister. “I imagine you’d like to know what happened?” Harry says, into the silence, “With the chamber?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry,” Albus feels the need to say, “My boy, I thought you were dead. We searched, I tried to track you down but we had </span>
  <em>
    <span>no idea</span>
  </em>
  <span>--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just a dead basilisk and the cold body of a little girl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Merlin, he hadn’t even known </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tom Riddle</span>
  </em>
  <span> was involved beyond his own suspicions. It wasn’t until he heard the name whispered about in political circles that he began to ruminate on what actually occurred.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I can’t tell you much. I believe you’ve hypothesised most of the events accurately already. Tom spoke with you this summer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Spoke. Albus supposes that’s one word for it. Harry reaches out to where the ring sits lifeless and drained on his desk, deft Seeker-fingers playing with it. With the dark hair and polite, aloof manner there is a moment Albus sees only Tom Riddle, sitting before him.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The boy speaks parseltongue</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thinks, followed by </span>
  <em>
    <span>no no no please</span>
  </em>
  <span> because that would be too much. Too horrifying to even consider, and it hadn’t been a problem, Harry had been dead except now he’s not--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lucky he saved you,” Harry’s green eyes flash to Dumbledore’s arm, to where the Withering Curse had been set on taking his life. He’d been so foolish. A foolish old man, filled with too many regrets. A foolish old man who had seen not a horcrux but the resurrection stone, and had reached for the past all too eagerly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had bitten at him like ice and fire and pain. He’d stumbled from the ruins of the shack, fully prepared to tear his way out and apparate to Severus’ side. The Potion’s genius would have something, anything--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s missing moments between putting it on his finger and the moment he comes back to himself, on his knees at the feet of a young, handsome school-aged version of Tom Riddle smirking over him. The ring glints between long pale fingers, the same way it glints between Harry’s now. The curse to his arm is shattered and Dumbledore lives. His wand lies metres from him, no doubt disarmed by Tom, and he tries not to think of the implications of that now, especially as he can tell already the Elder Wand is no longer as effective as it once had been.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“What do you want, Tom?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’d asked, still somewhat convinced he was dreaming.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Just an interview. For a job.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You already had one. I turned you away.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m afraid you haven’t interviewed </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>me</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span> yet.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>And he had thrown the ring down and it landed, black stone gleaming as it sunk into the soft grass at Dumbledore’s feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their interview had been a farce. Much like this interview with Harry is. The boy has nothing to say to him. Any trust Dumbledore had cultivated doesn’t exist anymore. He can already see the underlying loyalty to Tom Riddle, no matter how much the boy tries to hide it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s not really much to say,” Harry ponders, examining the ring that has sat on his desk since the moment he had offered Tom a job, “I followed Ginny down to the Chamber with Ron and Lockhart. Lockhart tried to obliviate us, but he was using Ron’s broken wand and the spell rebounded. There was a rockfall so I went on ahead. I found a dying Ginny and Tom in the Chamber. He set the basilisk on me. I killed it, but I became injured in the fight. Tom decided I was more use to him alive than dead. He left the school, using the pipes the basilisk had used. He took me with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry you had to go through that,” Dumbledore says, “I should never have left the school, Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There are only so many times Dumbledore can apologise. For leaving him. For believing him dead. For not searching harder, longer, further--</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’ll bring you a present,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Riddle had told him at their farce of an interview, </span>

    <span>“You let me work here and I’ll let you have something in the fight against my insane other half. Don’t be mistaken - it’s still mine - but while I’m here--”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus had thought Riddle was talking about a Horcrux. Another one, technically, since the ring was already sitting on the desk between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had never, would never have even considered that Tom Riddle would stride into the Great Hall followed by the shadow of Harry Potter, still alive, still breathing, still living--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t think living is the right word for the quiet, shade of a person that Harry has been. He eats, he responds to questions politely, he </span>
  <em>
    <span>exists </span>
  </em>
  <span>but--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He won’t answer any questions about his three years spent with a sociopath. Albus has barely seen the two interact beyond some pointed looks and glances.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s more going on here, and he suspects that the newly resurrected Lord Voldemort doesn’t agree with the policies and actions of his youngest soul piece. Albus’ suspicions are usually correct as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom Riddle is not a good person, Harry,” he says, but he thinks the boy knows that, “And you can be forgiven for what one needs to do in these sorts of situations to keep themselves alive and well--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think we should talk about something else, Professor,” Harry’s tone is sharp as he leans back, keeping hold of the ring. Dumbledore suspects he won’t get it back which means - damn, that’s all of the three hallows those two have now between them. “There’s nothing I can tell you about the past three years you need to know that you don’t already.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore smiles. He won’t push. Not now. The boy needs time to work things through on his own, and being among other people will be the best cure he can think of for spending extended periods of time in Tom Riddle’s presence. “Of course, Harry. Allow me at least to escort you down to dinner. I’m impressed with your OWL results - Minerva let me know of course. How are you finding your NEWT classes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He accompanies Harry down to dinner. Power moves are important, especially now and the whole school is still looking at Harry with curious glances. Except one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Riddle’s glare carries across the hall. Dumbledore can feel it burning him, much like the ring’s curse almost burnt him. He meets the boy’s gaze for a moment, and surprisingly the boy doesn’t hold it, eyes flickering sideways oddly. Odd because Tom doesn’t back down. Odd because Tom detests him, hates him, what could be more important than--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter sits down by his friends for dinner, giving his cursory scan of the hall, eyes flickering to where Tom sits and then relaxing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ah, Dumbledore thinks, pondering this new development. It’s not unexpected, at least not on Harry’s side. He can’t quite hide this newfound loyalty to Tom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Tom can’t quite hide his either.</span>
