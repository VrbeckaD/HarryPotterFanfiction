    <p>“Ye be a wizard, Harry!” boomed the overly large man. </p><p>“I be a what?” Harry of the Potters gasped, gaping up at the man who had just kicked in the door of their longhouse. Even for a Viking, the man was unbelievably tall and wide. He couldn’t even stand up straight – he’d had to walk to their fire hearth on his knees. </p><p>“Ye be a wizard, chosen of the gods,” the man repeated. He appeared to be beaming, although it was a bit hard to tell through the wild curls of his beard. </p><p>“N-no, he isn’t chosen,” his mother-sister, Petunia, gasped, clutching the fur bedcover to her chest in alarm. “We tried our best to make him unworthy . . .” </p><p>“Ye did WHAT?!” the man bellowed. In his shock and anger, he forgot himself, and leapt to his feet. There was an almighty crash, and Harry ducked away from the dust and straw that fell from the newly created hole in the longhouse ceiling. There came the sound of muttering from high above, and to the accompaniment of tearing sounds, and another shower of dust and debris, the stranger tore himself free from the ceiling and sank back down to his knees. “Nothing ye could do would make Harry of the Potters unworthy,” he said, sternly, waving a large finger in the face of Harry’s mother-sister. </p><p>“What is the oaf rambling on about, Pet?” Vernon, husband to Harry’s mother-sister, eyed his wife. “Ye told me your kin died when their longboat capsized.” </p><p>“Longboat capsized?!” The large man leapt to his feet again, and a second hole joined the first. At this rate, there wasn’t going to be any ceiling left on their longhouse at all. Again, the man sank to his knees, although he did look a bit as though he’d had too much mead this time. “How dare ye?” he slurred, glaring squint-eyed at Petunia. “As if . . . as if the Potters would succumb to a longboat accident!” </p><p>“Well, I wasn’t going to go around telling everybody that my sister was a chosen of the gods,” Petunia spat back – literally. The giant man flinched back from her saliva.</p>
