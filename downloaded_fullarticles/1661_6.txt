    <p>It was one of those rainy days in the beginning of the fall. Noelle was at her last year at Hogwarts. Not a particularly popular girl, though her looks were unmistakably in her favor. A blonde blue-eyed Slytherin girl with wavy hair and a freckled nose. Noelle was a good girl, aspiring to work at the ministry of Magic, and very likely to, considering her grades. Noelle was not particular popular among her fellow students, but not particular unpopular either. She got along with everybody, her friendships were often politically and calculating, after all, she was a Slytherin. Among the teachers Noelle was generally popular. She was flattering, borderline a teacher’s pet, but with a sincerity and an honesty that distinguished her and made her thought of as a well behaved and charming young woman.</p><p class="hLcpP">She had noticed him, pretty much ever since she started school - Well she had to, he was her teacher, but now having turned 18, she found it to be appropriate to pursue her crush. He was a bitter man, Severus, except of course when she caught him gazing at her, she would smile at him, and he would smile briefly, then look away, as if he had never admired her. It was obvious to her, that her occasional flatter and excuses to touch him, both amused and confused him, so this had almost turned into a game for her. Noelle was deeply in love with her professor, though she knew he was to proper to ever give in to her droplets of temptation and pursue her.</p><p class="hLcpP">You might think a woman like Noelle was a woman with many conquests behind her, but in fact she was not. She had been seeing Charlie Weasley from Gryffindor around their fourth year at Hogwarts, but when he had been picked as seeker for Gryffindors quidditch team, their relationship had had a natural ending, it had not been particularly popular for a Slytherin or a Gryffindor to fraternize with the enemy. It was just the same, the popularity had gone to her head, Noelle thought.</p><p class="hLcpP">This was the first time she had really been in love. She could be mistaken, but she thought to have seen passion in her teachers eyes from time to time.</p><p class="hLcpP">No, Severus was a decent man, not the kind of man who would break the rules, and especially not at the cost of his job, and perhaps it was this kind of honor, that attracted Noelle to this particular man, in spite of his age.</p><p class="hLcpP">She decided to have a go at it, after all, when the school year ended she would likely never see him again and that thought seemed almost unbearable to her. When her potions class had finished, she stayed behind. "Go ahead, I need to talk to the professor" She told her friends, and then she made her way to his office. Her heart was racing.</p><p class="hLcpP">"What brings you to my office miss Clearance" the professor said in a very disinterested manor, not even lifting his eyes from his writing.</p><p class="hLcpP">Noelle felt chills going down her spine, perhaps this had been a bad idea. "I guess, I was wondering if you could have a look at my potion, sir. Something is not quite right about it".</p><p class="hLcpP">He sent her a penetrating gaze, as if he expected to be set up for mischief, but then he got up from his chair and followed her back into the classroom to look at her cauldron.</p><p class="hLcpP">"What seems to be the matter miss Clearance". She put her hand on top of his, and for a second he jumped. "professor, I was wondering, if I could ask your personal opinion, on a matter"</p><p class="hLcpP">"I suppose that depends on the matter". His voice was cold and strict.</p><p class="hLcpP">"I - I am the matter"</p><p class="hLcpP">"You mean your academic performance". He sounded confused.</p><p class="hLcpP">"No" Noelle hesitated "I was wondering if..." Struggling with the words she leaned over, grabbed him on the back of his head and kissed him passionately.</p><p class="hLcpP">He gazed at Noelle in utter shock. She felt her head get hot red as she pulled away from him "I'm terribly sorry" she muttered "I see I have taken you off guard, I thought you might have taken an interest in me on a more personal level"</p><p class="hLcpP">"You are my student" he said in shortness of breath.</p><p class="hLcpP">"Well, if you should happen to… change your mind about me. I will be happy to hear, let us never speak of this again" She said in one short breath. Noelle ran out of the door, turned a corner and rested herself against the wall, thinking of the embarrassing display she had just made. She took a deep breath, pushed her palms into the wall, and then kept on with her daily activities, trying her hardest to forget what she had just done.</p><p class="hLcpP">But someone who could not forget, was Severus. petrified by Noelle’s word, he stood unable to move for several minutes. It had been years since he had last kissed a girl, little a girl almost half his age with such juvenile beauty. In truth he had noticed Noelle’s beauty, and her flirting gazes, but he had merely thought this to be the amusement of immature teenage girls, taking advantage of their newly found adulthood and the body that came with that - Perhaps in attempt to win a better grade. Perhaps this was it, was she making a fool of him? Would he find her laughing with her friends down the hallway, having won a contest of dare? Surely not.</p><p class="hLcpP">The next time he saw her, surely, he would get to the bottom of it. "miss Clearance, please stay to clean the tables" he commanded, and so Noelle stayed, in utter fear for what confrontation might lay ahead. Her hands were shaking as she wiped the table "professor, I am deeply sorry..." she began, but he silenced her with a hand "I will not be subjected to this game of yours, miss Clearance, I am your teacher, and should thus be treated with respect." Noelle looked at him with awe, and then stepped close to him. She grabbed his hand "Sir, if you in any way think my intentions have not been sincere, I do apologize. There is no game, sir. I am terribly embarrassed, but I promise you, my feelings - And my intentions, were never dishonest. I admire and respect you deeply. Make no mistake. I adore you" She whispered the last words.</p><p class="hLcpP">Struck by her words, an impulse arose in the 30-year-old man, as he leaned towards her and returned her passionate kiss. Shocked by his lack of self-control he threw himself back, turned on his heels and said in a loud clear voice "that would be all miss Clearance!" he walked quickly to his office and closed the door.</p><p class="hLcpP">For a while, nothing happened, except a glance and even a smile, which for Severus was a big thing, but mostly he seemed to avoid Noelle and the temptation that came with her, being overly polite and cold to her.</p><p class="hLcpP">Noelle was dissatisfied with this. His kiss had left her hungry for him. Therefore, she arrived early for potions on a Friday. It was one of those frosty and dark afternoons, at which the crypt almost seemed cozy. Her teacher was still in his office and suddenly she found herself knocking on the door "Yes" an irritated voice replied. Noelle snug into his office "I was hoping to find you early" she went beside him, and carefully stroke his cheek with the palm of her hand. "this has to end miss Clearance". She leaned forward and ran her fingers through his hair and unto his chest, then whispered into his ear "I will leave, if you ask me to leave" He closed his eyes, at her gentle touch. "No" he gasped and grabbed her wrist. In one quick motion, he pushed her body against the wall, framing it with his own. As he kissed her, he allowed his hands to feel her waist, and then move under her shirt. Her warm, soft skin was like aphrodisiac. The laces on her bra was tempting him. She moaned gently, and he took this as an invitation. He let his finger find her nipples hard from the goosebumps from his touch. As most young women, her breasts were young, soft and firm.</p><p class="hLcpP">Suddenly noises were heard from the classroom. Severus pulled away, but she quietly pulled him back in her arms and merged his fingers. She guided his hand to her thighs. He did not resist, and he was excited, she could tell. A loud bump from the classroom broke the silence. "We better stop" The professor whispered as Noelle let go of one him. She smiled at him and he smiled back, but still shocked by his own lack of self-restraint. Noelle buttoned her shirt, and quickly fixed her hair and clothes, to not make any suspicion "Thank you professor" she said as she opened the door to the classroom but sent him a smile only he could see. As soon as the door opened, professor Snape replied, "you are welcome miss Clearance" and his smirk to turn into a mask of frown.</p><p class="hLcpP"> </p><p class="hLcpP">
