There was nothing particularly remarkable about Kings Cross Station, nor the train within it. It had a dark grey finish had chipped, dull blue accents.</p><p><em>     Oh yes, 'extravagant', they said. Maybe with the amount of people, but that’s up for debate. </em>She thought, mentally sighing and tucking the curl back in place.</p><p>    She had a few things with her, only the necessities, or so it seemed. After receiving her letter from the fluffy black owl a week or so prior to the first of September<em> — </em> and sending her eager acceptance <em> — </em>she had shrunk down her books, grabbed her coin purse, stuffed her metal crest into her pocket before setting off to gather her school necessities. After which, she spent the next several days crossing her fingers that she wouldn't be late or, simply put, get herself lost. The sack that housed all this was a gift; from whom Misha had no idea, simply that it was just that: a gift. This sack was in no way remarkable except that it had an unusual ability to hold anything and everything that is set inside, all the while weighing nothing more than a few quill feathers. Though, don’t assume that meant things were hard to find from within it. On the contrary, all you would have to do is reach in while thinking of what you wanted.</p><p>  Taking out the worn slip of paper and her black crest from the pocket of her dark green peacoat, she examined the faded, red pen markings.</p><p>
  <em>     By Merlin’s name let me not be too late. </em>
</p><p>    She had fumbled with the note for years having it memorized a while ago; at this point, she would merely look at it purely for comfort rather than necessity.</p><p>    “Platform 9 3/4,” she mumbled to herself, stuffing the paper back into her pocket and smoothing her fingers of the crest’s edge, tracing the resin figure that protruded ever so slightly. “Get it together, Misha, there’s no one to help you here.”</p><p>    Taking a deep, smoak clogged breath, she gripped her crest tight and set off to find the impossible platform within the bubbling crowd.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>    Kings Cross Station was loud; expectedly so, but that didn’t make it any more pleasant than it already was. The atmosphere was humid and thick with the smell of sweat and coal and fried foods. Rather than get swept up in the two-way flow of passengers, Misha decidedly stuck closer to the pillars as she navigated her way through the area.</p><p>    “Platform Nine—Platform Ten. Well, I suppose it’s in the middle. If only there was a middle to be in.” she frowned. “Excuse me, Sir. where might I find a platform Nine and Three-Quarters?”</p><p>    The officer that turned to her was plump in the cheeks but slimmed down towards his feet. His handlebar moustache scrunched up with his bushy eyebrows as he grimaced in her general direction.</p><p>    “Listen, kid, you’re the fourth person to ask me that this morning. I don't understand what game you're playing, but keep me out of it, you hear? There is no platform Nine and Three-Quarters.” The grizzly man turned away before she could say anything in reply. Not that she knew what to say.</p><p>
  <em>     Fourth? Well, I suppose that’s likely. Maybe I just can't see it. Maybe I— </em>
</p><p>    Misha’s thoughts were halted by the soothing voice of a silver-haired man.</p><p>   “Come now, Tera, you've done this once before and you see your sisters do it every year. Platform nine and three-quarters, this way, come now.”</p><p>   The silver-haired man leads a young boy and two older girls quickly through the station stopping roughly around where Misha happened to have taken root. Each of them, excluding the man, had a trolley of items stacked high, and a pet.</p><p>
  <em>    So that’s what I forgot. </em>
</p><p>    Misha stepped silently closer to the family and inserted herself behind them as if to adopt them as her own.</p><p>    “If it worries you so, let your sisters go first.” The man with the kind voice turned and beckoned to the two taller girls behind him, both also bestowed with silver hair—theirs long and straightened, flattering their dark blue coats. In fact, they all had a rather uniform look. Each of them looked rather regal, all with light blue eyes, blue peacoat tailored to their forms, and silver hair.</p><p>    “Papa, we’ll owl you when we get there.” Each of the girls kissed the man on the cheek before walking swiftly through the brick wall and vanishing.</p><p>    The man turned to Misha.</p><p>    “I suppose you’re here for the same reason?” he said. The man’s eyes fell upon her with a welcoming smile.</p><p>    Misha’s mind was swamped, to say the least, from what she’d just seen.</p><p>
  <em>     That’s a first. </em>
</p><p>    She snapped her jaw shut, not even realizing it was open, to simply nod dumbly to the man. His smile failed to falter at her momentary lapse of brain function. The hold on her crest tightened before she dropped it back in her pocket.</p><p>    “I’m assuming it’s your first time. You seem no stranger to magic but that doesn’t mean you can't be surprised. Just move quickly—no need to run—towards the wall and you will find yourself on the other side, just follow the signs from then on.” Misha, shook herself out of her stupor to absorb the information. His words were kind and thoughtful, it would be rude not to.</p><p>    “T-thank you, Sir. You would be right.”</p><p>    “It’s no trouble. Tera, go with her. Go on, you’ll be fine. Owl me when you arrive.” he motioned to the brick wall. The kind, silver-haired man stepped back and nudged the boy towards it. Misha, with her eyes pinched shut, followed suit.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>    Misha opened her eyes with a gasp. All the sounds and smells came back to her at once, hitting hard, and disorienting her for a moment. Especially because it was different yet so similar. The smells changed from dirty and suffocating to crisp like after a rainstorm, and sweet like hot chocolate and candy canes. Everything was vibrant as if her world went from black and white to colour. The train was red like what you would imagine the perfect candy apple to look like, all framed with a shiny black and polished metal. Momentarily, Misha wondered if the people on the other side of the wall saw them disappear.</p><p>    “Hello, my name is Tera Lacour, that was my Father.” The boy's voice was soft and shy as if unsure and extremely nervous. Misha shook herself from her roaming speculations.</p><p>    “Misha Crow, and thank you, again. Are we to board the train?”</p><p>    “Yeah, and sooner rather than later or all the good compartments will be taken up. That or we'll be sharing with other people as overflow and that’s never fun.” his nose scrunched as if reliving a rather unpleasant memory.</p><p>    “Personal experience?”</p><p>    “You could say that. You want to sit with me?”</p><p>    Misha thought idly for a moment. “Sure.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>    The compartments were not large, per se, but they were roomy and could comfortably sit six to eight people relative to their size; perhaps even ten if a few didn't mind sitting on the floor. And there were many of them. Tera hoisted his trunk into the overhead compartment after gathering a few books and a small pouch of Chiko nuts from her bad, Misha followed suit.</p><p>    Lifting up the table from the wall, she items down to stare out the window for a moment before getting comfortable and settling in to read. Tera did the same, sending her a small smile before turning to his own book with a pleased sigh.</p>
