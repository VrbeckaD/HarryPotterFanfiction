    <p>They were only an hour into their sixth year, and Peter had already almost murdered a girl. To be fair to him, he was actually trying to flirt with her; she’d probably have preferred a nice, quick death, if he’d given her the choice. </p><p>He had been talking to Sarah McLeavy, a pretty girl from the year below who seemed too nice to tell him to bugger off outright, and James was struggling so hard not to laugh audibly that the potatoes he was eating were attempting a surprise reappearance through his nose. </p><p>“Shut up, shut up,” Sirius hissed, elbowing him as Peter took out his wand. “Don’t ruin this for me. I want to see how it ends.” </p><p>“It- it’s going to-” James attempted a stage whisper and seemed to realise that the potatoes were impeding him. He swallowed them. “It’s going to end with her in the hospital wing.” </p><p>Sirius laughed, and then caught Remus’s eye and bit his lip. Their friend was watching the whole scene unfold with an expression of great suffering. Somehow, that only served to make it funnier. </p><p>“If you’ll just watch here,” Peter was saying, brandishing his wand like a weapon, “I can turn your green beans into flowers.” </p><p>“Don’t try to turn her green beans into flowers, Peter,” Remus said gently, and James snorted into the glass of pumpkin juice he had just been sipping. </p><p>Peter reddened, but ignored them. Sarah was half-distracted, answering a friend on her other side, trying to get back to eating her dinner. He narrowed his eyes, gave a little flourish of his wand, and muttered something the others couldn’t hear; the beans on her plate transformed instantly into daisies, and Sirius looked at James and shrugged with a smirk, proven wrong. </p><p>“Peter-” Remus said with alarm, and when he turned back Sirius immediately understood why; Sarah had a forkful of flowers in one hand and was turning an alarming shade of red, clutching at her throat with her free hand. “She’s choking,” Remus said, getting up and fumbling for his own wand inside his robes. </p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t - I didn’t-” Peter was just as red as she was, but seemed frozen in place, unable to think or move or be even the slightest bit helpful. </p><p>“Out of my <em> way</em>,” Sirius was already on his feet and shoved Peter aside, knocking him from the bench entirely. “<em>Accio </em>daisies!” A thick wad of white petals flew through the air towards him, and at the last moment he directed them to the floor with a flick of his wand. Sarah McLeavy collapsed forward onto the table gasping for air and her friends flocked to her, exclaiming and putting their arms around her protectively. One of them glared over her shoulder at Peter, and he turned towards his friends, crimson and mortified.</p><p>“All things considered, I think that probably ranks in your top five chat-up lines, Wormtail,” Sirius said seriously. </p><p>“Oh, God. Oh, Christ. Can we leave? I think I have to leave.” </p><p>“I think that’s probably for the best,” Remus said, his tone rather pained. They all got to their feet, James stuffing bread rolls into his pockets before giving Peter a friendly thump on the shoulder. </p><p>“Well, I’m proud of you, mate. And if you do want to ask her out, I think she’s just about breathing again now.” He gave Peter a thumbs up.</p><p>“Hear that, Pettigrew? Breathing, and everything!” Sirius could hear Remus apologising behind them as they walked away, no longer attempting to control their laughter. </p><p>*</p><p>Sirius was smoking; and of course, if <em> Sirius </em> was smoking then <em> James </em>wanted to smoke. They’d seen a muggleborn seventh year light up behind a tree at Hogsmeade station and immediately gone to haggle for cigarettes while Remus stared at his shoes and tried to ignore Peter, who was anxiously pulling at his sleeve and whispering about how much trouble they were all going to get into. </p><p>As they lit their cigarettes with little wisps of fire, transported upstairs from the common room in James’s cupped hands, Remus expected there to be some sort of protection that detected smoke - the ceiling infused with an aguamenti charm, perhaps - but nothing happened.</p><p>“Good to know that if we set fire to the drapes we’ll be on our own,” he said crossly. </p><p>“It’s so relaxing when you talk, Moony,” James said, leaning back against the windowsill with his eyes closed and exhaling a lungful of smoke. “It’s like a warm hug.” He coughed a little, then cleared his throat and took another drag. </p><p>Sirius wasn’t coughing. You’d think he’d smoked a thousand times in his life, the way he looked so casual doing it, the cigarette dangling from his fingers as he ran the other hand through his long hair and gazed out of the window. </p><p>“They’re terribly bad for you, cigarettes,” Peter piped up from where he was sitting on his bed on the other side of the room, reading a well-thumbed copy of <em> Which Broomstick? </em>from last year. </p><p>“Oh, good. There’s two of them,” Sirius said darkly, and James laughed. Remus did not laugh. They’d been at school an evening and he was already sick of being cast as the killjoy; the <em> responsible </em>one. </p><p>“Give me one of those,” he said, leaning forward and tapping Sirius lightly on the knee. He looked mildly surprised, but carefully extracted another from the breast pocket of his shirt and handed it to Remus, who studied it, suddenly realising that he had no idea what he was supposed to do with it next. </p><p>“You’re holding it the wrong way,” James said, and Remus quickly turned it around and put it to his lips. </p><p>“Come here,” Sirius said, leaning towards him and then pausing to tuck his hair behind his ears when it came dangerously close to being set alight. He leaned in closer and Remus froze, utterly confused by the gesture, until Sirius pressed the lit end of his cigarette to the tip of Remus’s own and took a deep breath in. Remus did the same, and the embers burned white-hot for a moment before the paper caught and Sirius pulled away. His heart racing from whatever was in the damned cigarette, Remus shuffled back to lean against the four-poster and tried to work out if he felt sick or exhilarated. It was a bit of both. </p><p>“You’ve got that look on your face,” Sirius said to James, who immediately frowned back at him. </p><p>“There’s no look,” he said, and Sirius laughed. </p><p>“What does that look say to you, Remus?” </p><p>Remus grinned. “<em>Evans</em>.” </p><p>“Kindly fuck off,” James said, reaching out with one leg to give Remus a half-hearted sort of kick. </p><p>“You know if you need tips, Wormtail’s <em>really </em>got a knack with the ladies,” Sirius said, and they heard Peter sigh dramatically and throw the magazine down onto the bed. </p><p>“I didn’t know it would transfigure the beans in her mouth - I didn’t know she <em> had </em> beans in her mouth-”<br/>
<br/>
“Tell it to the Wizengamot, Peter,” James said, laughing at his own joke until he started coughing again. Remus was letting his own cigarette burn down while avoiding smoking too much of it; Sirius was sucking his down like a starving Dementor going after a soul. </p><p>“She was looking at you during the feast,” Remus said to James, who smiled despite himself. </p><p>“Everybody was looking at us. Peter was quite openly attempting murder,” Sirius said dismissively, and James’s smile wavered. </p><p>“She definitely was. She was talking to Mary Macdonald, but she kept looking down the table at you.” The smile was back. Sirius had to have all of James, all the time; he couldn’t bear the idea that he might disappear off with Lily Evans and ruin their little twosome. Not that Remus thought <em> that </em>likely to happen any time soon; Lily may have been looking at James at dinner, but unless he’d been greatly mistaken she’d rolled her eyes on more than one occasion. </p><p>“Oh <em> God</em>, I’ve got Potions first thing,” Peter said miserably; Remus looked over to see him bent over his schedule. </p><p>“Great, now I’m thinking about Potions,” Sirius said irritably. Remus reached into his pocket for his  own schedule and carefully unfolded it. </p><p>“Potions, Charms, free period and then Transfiguration,” he said, and Peter looked a little more hopeful. </p><p>“Same as me! And we’ll all be in Defence Against the Dark Arts together the day after next.” </p><p>“I have no idea how you can walk into <em>Transfiguration </em> with a straight face,” Sirius said. </p><p>“We’ve talked about this. They’re hardly going to give me a NEWT in Transfiguration even if I - I don’t know, transformed in front of them in the exam room. It’s involuntary.” </p><p>“Plus,” said James thoughtfully, “they wouldn’t be able to write down your marks once you’d bitten off their hands.” </p><p>“Damn it, I wish I could show them Padfoot,” Sirius said wistfully. “They’d be so impressed they’d probably hand us the keys to the castle.”<br/>
<br/>
“They’d be so impressed they’d send you to Azkaban,” Remus replied. </p><p>“Is there some sort of charm on that prefect badge that transforms the wearer into an utter prick, Lupin?” Sirius asked, but he was smiling; Remus bit back a smile in response. He was trying not to reward bad behaviour; Sirius was always chasing the reward. </p><p>“Are we going out tonight? I haven’t been keeping track,” James said, and Sirius looked at Remus. </p><p>“When’s full moon?” </p><p>“A week,” Remus said without missing a beat. “Next Wednesday.” </p><p>“Wednesday it is,” James said, as if there had ever been any choice in the matter. Remus shuddered without meaning to, already there in his mind, clawing at the walls of the shack; he saw Sirius glance over at him and looked down at his hands so he wouldn’t have to meet his eye. </p><p>“James, did you remember to pack the new <em> Hobgoblins </em>record?” Sirius asked quickly, and James immediately jumped to his feet to go and rummage in his trunk. </p><p>“Got it,” he said, holding it aloft in triumph. Sirius went to his own trunk and fetched a flask of questionably-procured firewhiskey, demanding that they all present their chipped tea mugs and pouring each of them a generous measure. Peter grumbled about it, but was loath to be left out entirely. </p><p>“To sixth year,” Sirius said, holding his obnoxiously scarlet mug up so they could all clink theirs against it and chorus “to sixth year!” in return. </p><p>“And to us,” James added, grinning around at them all. “May we make it to Christmas with the majority of our limbs intact.”</p>
