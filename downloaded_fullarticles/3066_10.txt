    <p>"Lily, it is too dangerous, nobody can know that we are his fathers, Hades is maybe the exception"</p>
<p>The three Gods stood watching the red head as she paced, hands rubbing her flat stomach, mascara running down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"I know, I know. J-just don't forget about him, about me, please" She moaned, a fresh set of tears flooding down her face. Muscular arms wrapped around her body pulling her close, slender hands rubbed her back soothingly and firm hands ran through her hair comfortingly.</p>
<p>"Never" They chorused, an unspoken promise reaching the ears of Lady Hecate and Lord Merlin themselves. </p>
<p>"You should tell Potter, he will need to be the ones to protect you, we cannot get involved or risk Zeus, Kronos and Riddles knowledge."</p>
<p>Hades mumbled, dark eyes meeting her own as she turned her head towards him.</p>
<p>"It's a boy. I can sense it" She smiled softly before her voice trembled</p>
<p>"I love you. All of you"</p>
<p>Her voice was a whisper but they all heard it, stepping back as the portkeye activated, leaving the three alone in the dark hotel room. Unknowing it was the last time they would ever see her alive.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>"J-james, I'm Pregnant"</p>
<p>The words had slipped from her mouth like the cup falling from his hand, his face lighting up in glee, only adding to guilt stirring in her stomach.</p>
<p>He could never know that baby wasn't his, he could never know because he would never understand. All demigods have mates, and in the month that they broke off their relation ship, she found hers. Only James started it back again, she was stuck, unable to tell him yet unable to love him like she did her mates. And he would never know she had sex with another man, let alone three.</p>
<p>He bounded towards the floo. beaming as he called his best friends through. Wolfstar came first - Her and Alice made that name - followed by Peter.</p>
<p>The son of Hermes locked eyes with her and a silent message passed between them.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>"JAMES POTTER YOU ARE NEVER COMING NEAR ME WITH A TEN FOOT BLOOD POLE!"</p>
<p>The trio outside winced. James gritted his teeth pacing as another scream tore through the doors. </p>
<p>Lily panted heavily, exhaustion settling in as a soft cry was heard and her son was placed in her arms. Tufts of dark hair forming on his head, killing curse eyes staring up at her, she noted with a smile, he had his Fathers nose.</p>
<p>James burst in, skidding to a stop beside her bed as she reluctantly held him up to her 'husband'. She could feel Peters gaze on her and nodded slightly, giving him the signal he needed to disappear. But, as the animagus hurried outside and into an alleyway, he was struck from behind.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>"Fight him Peter!!"</p>
<p>Lily cried out as James flew into the opposite wall with a crack. She watched the horror pass over his face and the mouthed plea for help to his father. But they both knew Hermes would not answer. With a low moan she stood frozen as the wand turned on her, a tear sliding down Peters face as he tried to jerk the wand away. The Killing curse missed her by an inch, glancing off the mirror and striking her in the back. She fell silently to the floor. Then the wand turned once more, but not towards the kids like Peter expected, instead he found his vision obscured by green, leaving only darkness behind as life left his body.</p>
<p>Sirius and Remus burst through the Living room door, watching Peters body fall, Voldemort stood casually behind, looking rather amused, their howls of rage and pain silenced as they smashed through the wall, not unlike their brother. The snake faced monster turned towards the play pen where one year old Charlotte Rosetta Petunia Potter lay, hazel eyes glaring up at him, little fists waving in the air. Emerald eyes peeked out from beneath some fallen debris as two year old Harry Potter tottered up, also glaring, stumbling forwards towards his sister, a healing scar broken, blood running down his neck. </p>
<p>As Charlotte let out a cry, Tom Riddle simply blasted her away, to fall next to her mother, unconscious. A strong hex on a baby would leave a lasting physical scar, one that dashed across her cheek. Then Scarlet eyes turned to meet Harry's, the one he thought the prophecy meant. The green curse struck effectively, slicing into the boys chest and sending him flying through the hole his godparents had made and deep into the rubble. Yet as he did so, it was as if a bomb had gone off, a wave of magic bursting from him and sending the Dark Lord flying, spirit tearing from his body, leaving ashes behind.</p>
<p>Not minutes later Albus Dumbledore turned up.</p>
<p>James mourned for his wife who lay limp in his arms. Remus and Sirius were curled protectively around Charlotte. Albus felt a darker magic pulse and quietly excused himself from the room, feeling through the bricks, pulling them aside to find the small two year old. Picking him up the old man's eyes widened as a familiar voice echoed through his head. </p>
<p>
  <em>"He is mine. Leave him. He will be safe"</em>
</p>
<p>Reluctantly Dumbledore obeyed the God, gently resting the boy on the grass and backing off into the house. Before however, the god could collect his son, someone else did. Harsh hands picking up the unconscious toddler and disappearing with a crack.</p>
<p>The said toddler was left outside Wools orphanage, hours away from his old home. And the old mans memories were wiped as he made his way back to his favourite former students. From that day, Lily and Harry Potter were pronounced dead. That day France had a devastating Earthquake. That day a volcano erupted in America with a mass of deaths. That day a plague was unleashed upon the world that would give many potion masters a hard time and many muggles dead.</p>
