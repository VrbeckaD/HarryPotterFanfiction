    <p>“So,” Hermione says after a slight drop in the conversation. “Are we… Are we going out tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Ron looks up, startled. Hermione's suggestion surprises him. (Although he'd be lying if he said he hadn't thought about it- he's just shocked she actually went ahead and asked.)</p>
<p>They're not dating. Not really. Sometimes he thinks they might as well be, with the way they act around each other, but then he remembers what a mess they were before and decides it's better this way. Easier.</p>
<p>For months now there's been an invisible line that they don't cross. They don't talk about it, they don't acknowledge it, they don't put a name on it- it's just there.</p>
<p>Ron's not sure, but something's telling him that a date on Valentine's day is dangerously close to crossing that line.</p>
<p>“Do you… want to?” He asks tentatively, thinking there's probably a better response he could give her.</p>
<p>He doesn't want to break things between them before they've even had a chance to build them back up.</p>
<p>Hermione bites her lip. “Sure.” She says it in an offhand manner but Ron knows her too well to take it at face value. Hermione’s gotten better at hiding her emotions from him, but he can still see through her mask- most of the time. It makes his chest hurt to remember a time when she didn’t have to put a mask on at all in front of him, a time when he had her complete and absolute trust. Still- things change, and it’s no secret that he doesn’t know her nearly as well as he used to- as well as he should.</p>
<p>“Good.” Ron says, and then, feeling that he's being too dismissive, “I’d like that, yeah.”</p>
<p>Hermione offers a sad sort of smile. He doesn’t think she means it to be sad but that’s what it looks like. There’s a vulnerability in her eyes that he hasn’t seen in a long time, and he knows he should be grateful that she’s willing to let him see it, but he can’t bring himself to be.</p>
<p>It’s strange, but it’s almost like he doesn’t want her trust. She spent too long putting herself back together for him to come and tear her apart again. It’s not fair, Ron reasons with himself. It’s not fair to her.</p>
<p><em>Then why are you still here?</em> Pipes up the other little voice he’s all too used to hearing- the one that feeds off of his selfishness. <em>It’s not like you didn’t get hurt either</em>, the voice argues, and Ron, who never really could stand up to his inner demons, has to admit that it's got a point.</p>
<p>Their relationship was a trainwreck from start to finish. Sure, they loved each other, and sure, the sex was amazing, but it came to a point where their being together just wasn’t helping anybody, least of all themselves. It was Hermione, who had whispered it whilst drunk one night on their sofa: ‘Maybe love just isn’t enough’. And Ron- Ron in his anger and his inebriated state- had agreed with her.</p>
<p>The next morning she was gone.</p>
<p>They're still friends of course. Ron can’t imagine them ever not being friends. But it's different now. It's a constant struggle to stay away from her- don’t get too close, don’t get too involved- whilst also being near her.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Ron thinks how he feels about Hermione is all or nothing. (Except he could never feel nothing for her, he's kidding himself if he thinks he could ever feel nothing for her). Being her friend, and just her friend, is like waiting to catch a train that’s never coming.<br/>
<br/>
Although if Ron is being completely honest with himself (which he only does alone, at night) he and Hermione really aren’t only just friends. Just friends don’t act like Ron and Hermione act towards each other. There isn’t really a label for how they act towards each other but ‘friends’ is definitely safer than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
“I was thinking, maybe <em>Via Verde</em>? You know that little italian place around the corner?” Hermione watches his reaction nervously.</p>
<p><em>Via Verde</em>. That had been their regular restaurant when they were dating. Ron notices the casual way in which she mentions the place, acting as if it doesn't bear any great significance to their relationship and decides to play along.</p>
<p>“Yeah. That sounds cool.” Truth is, he’s never been a big fan of italian food, but knowing of Hermione’s complete perchance for it, he’d never actually said anything.</p>
<p>Besides, there's always the pizza he can go for.</p>
<p>“Great.” Hermione smoothes down her skirt and flashes him that slightly unsure, yet determined smile. “Great. How’s 7 'o clock sound?”</p>
<p>Ron startles again. He had been under the impression that hers had been a spontaneous offer, born of not wanting to be alone on Valentine’s day, but Hermione seems to know exactly what she wants. Ron can't help but wonder if it means something.</p>
<p>His conscience is telling him not to push it, to accept it, distances be damned. But the other side, the more insistent side, needs to know just what her intentions are.</p>
<p>“Sounds great. Have you… You haven’t been planning this, have you?” The regret he feels for asking is imminent. He knows straight away that he should have just gone with it, smiled along like they always do with these kind of things.</p>
<p>He feels like he's walking all over their carefully constructed line, breaking boundaries, asking questions. They've been in a very strict rhythm lately, but now Ron has stepped out of time.</p>
<p>They don't talk about it- and they definitely never ask questions about it.</p>
<p>But Ron just did.</p>
<p>“No,” Maybe it's Ron, but she appears slightly offended by the insinuation, “I’ve been thinking about it, but I wouldn’t go as far as to say ‘planning’.” And then, as if it were completely necessary to remind him she adds, “We’re not dating.”</p>
<p>“I know that!” His tone comes out more indignant than he’d meant it to but Ron can’t exactly bring himself to care. “I wasn’t accusing you of…” but he trails off, unable to think of a satisfactory way to end that sentence.</p>
<p>Hermione raises her eyebrows like she expects him to go on. He sighs, “Look, we tried being, well, <em>‘us’</em> okay? And it didn’t work. I’m aware of that, trust me.”</p>
<p>Hermione purses her lips together. “Okay.”</p>
<p>“Okay?” Ron asks in confusion. What was 'okay' supposed to mean?</p>
<p>Now Hermione seems genuinely angry, "Yes, Ron- Okay. We didn't work, and we still don't. No one is debating that fact. Do you want to go out on Friday or not?"</p>
<p>Resisting the urge to push the point even further, Ron gathers all that is left of his pride and gives her a taut smile. "I would, yeah."</p>
<p>Hermione nods satisfactorily and there's a small moment of pause, like she's waiting for something. The moment passes as quickly as it came, and Hermione smiles at him in a way that almost seems to say '<em>sorry</em>'.</p>
<p>He smiles back, and before he knows it they're back to talking about work and the new weird sisters album, and a range of other things that doesn't require either of them to think about the past- or each other.</p>
<p>It marks the first day that they've actually addressed the issue that Ron has come to refer to in his head as 'it', although looking back, Ron realises that maybe not that much was actually said after all.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry asks him if he has any plans for Valentine's day the next day at work and Ron doesn't know why he hesitates so long before saying yes.</p>
<p>Harry frowns, "Yeah? Who is it then?"</p>
<p>Now Ron takes even longer to answer, because he really doesn't need Harry's judgement on top of his own. "Hermione."</p>
<p>Harry's shocked, Ron can see Harry's shocked, but true to form, his composure is regained almost instantly. "Really? You two are dating again?" There's a tone of incredulity to his voice that almost makes Ron cringe.</p>
<p>For a moment, Ron wants nothing more than to answer <em>'yes'</em> to Harry's question, but it passes instantly, leaving a trail of guilt in it's wake. "Err...No. No, it's not like that."</p>
<p>Harry raises an eyebrow and Ron can't tell if his best friend is angry or amused. He's not sure which one he'd prefer, but either way he can tell it's going to take some convincing.</p>
<p>"Honestly, it's not. We're just friends. We're just going out and having a meal. As friends. That's it."</p>
<p>Harry still looks skeptical, and Ron, well, Ron can't really blame him since he was also skeptical at first. (He still is skeptical if he were being truthful, but he pushes the niggling doubt to the back of his mind.)</p>
<p>"Where are you two going?" Harry asks, innocently enough, but Ron knows the insinuation is anything less than innocent.</p>
<p>"Err... The little Italian around the corner? You know, the place we-"</p>
<p>"The place you two used to go. When you were dating."</p>
<p>"Well... Yeah."</p>
<p>"But now you're going... just as friends?"</p>
<p>Ron's expression says everything Harry needs and he leans back against his desk in victory. Ron wants nothing more than to punch the smug expression from Harry's face, because really, what him and Hermione do or don't do is none of Harry's business anyway.</p>
<p>Ron is just about to open his mouth and tell him so when Harry speaks again: "Just remember what happened last time you and Hermione got too close okay?"</p>
<p>Harry's words aren't an insult, but Ron feels insulted all the same. "Haven't forgotten yet, mate."</p>
<p>Harry sighs and moves his hand to rub along his jaw, something he only does when frustrated or agitated. "Look, I just don't want either of you getting hurt again okay? And this- this whatever the hell it is you two have arranged for Friday- doesn't seem like the best way to prevent that."</p>
<p>"Bloody hell." Ron mutters, rolling his eyes. "Harry, listen. I know what I'm doing, and Hermione is nothing if not cautious. We'll be fine alright? Just friends, remember?"</p>
<p>But Harry remains thoroughly unconvinced throughout the day, telling Ron to '<em>be careful'</em> and <em>'don't fuck it up.'</em> Ron leaves the office feeling thoroughly disgruntled, because if he can't even convince Harry that him and Hermione are just friends, how on earth is he supposed to convince himself?</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's been awhile since their<em> 'date'</em> on Valentine's day, but Ron still feels an ache whenever he looks at her. There's really no reason for it, either, but perhaps that's the most frustrating thing of all.</p>
<p>Going out for a romantic meal on Valentine's day isn't something a lot of friends do, and Ron's well aware of that. But it's different with him and Hermione. (He's pretty sure it's always been different with them.)</p>
<p>Maybe it's because it reminded him so clearly of the time they'd been a couple. Sure, they were messed up, but they were alright, weren't they? They had a few good times, didn't they?</p>
<p><em>Sure they did</em>, he rationalises, <em>doesn't mean it outweighs the bad though.</em></p>
<p>Hermione smiles as she enters his flat. Hanging her coat up with Ron's on the stand, she flops down next to him on the sofa.</p>
<p>Ron chuckles gently, "Long day?"</p>
<p>Hermione makes a noise in the back of her throat that Ron takes to mean 'yes' and rests her head on the back of the sofa, exposing her neck as she does so. Ron can almost <em>feel</em> his ears heating up, so he turns away from her to cover it up.</p>
<p>"Er- shall I make tea?"</p>
<p>Hermione brings her head back up to look at him and nods slowly. "Tea would be nice. Thanks."</p>
<p>He goes about making tea, thinking as he does so, about how weird this all seems now.</p>
<p>It's been their routine for a while. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Hermione comes back to his flat after work and they talk. (About what, it doesn't really matter- it's just something they do.) Sometimes they'll play chess, or Hermione will read whilst Ron writes up his reports, but mostly they just talk.</p>
<p>Their friends and family find it weird, but for Ron, it's always felt completely natural.</p>
<p>He looks back to Hermione, sitting on his sofa, curled up with a pillow. She looks exhausted, and he thinks, like he does everytime she comes over, that she's working herself too hard. Not that it's his place to say of course. Not anymore.</p>
<p>They make a point of staying out of each other's business.</p>
<p>Ron misses the days when they could talk about anything without burden, but now so many topics feel like they carry the weight of the world, and Ron wouldn't even dare approach them.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he wishes they could just go back to being young and stupid and in love.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he misses loving Hermione.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he thinks about them getting back together.</p>
<p>Ron believes in love, and he also believes in all the things that his parents taught him- commitment and hard-work and bringing the best out in each other. Love is supposed to lead to all those things, but in the case of him and Hermione it only led to pain.</p>
<p>Maybe the version of their relationship that lives inside his head is a lot brighter than it was in real life. Maybe the Hermione and Ron he's created from mismatched memories have a lot less problems than their real life counterparts.</p>
<p>Nostalgia isn't really something he can trust.</p>
<p>The problem with this, of course, is that he doesn't know whether he misses being with Hermione, or if he just misses the idea of being with Hermione, the memories of being with her.</p>
<p>So in the end, Ron bottles up his rebellious emotions and brings Hermione her tea, hoping that maybe, just maybe, they'll be in the clear soon.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"How was your date?" Harry asks the following week when they're both back in the office.</p>
<p>"Piss off, will you?" Ron quips back with no real malice behind the words.</p>
<p>Harry just smirks at him, and whilst Ron loves Harry like one of his own brothers, sometimes he can't stand the git.</p>
<p>"Nothing happened." He says instead of telling Harry this, wondering why he felt the need to clarify it at all.</p>
<p>"Oh?" says Harry, and Ron can't tell whether that's genuine surprise on his face or just a display to get Ron to spill.</p>
<p>What Harry sometimes forgets is that Ron knows how interrogations work too. He attended all the same lectures Harry did, witnessed all the same examples, even questioned the same suspects; he knows the drill and he knows when his best friend is trying to get something out of him because if it.</p>
<p>So Ron ignores Harry's one word questions, focusing on the pile of paperwork in front of him.</p>
<p>Eventually Harry gives up; Ron hears him sigh and resign himself to the task of filling in a report of their latest mission. It's a while before either of them speak again.</p>
<p>"Just- if you ever need to talk about it, I, well, I'm here, alright?"</p>
<p>Ron looks up from where sentences are starting to blur together on his desk.</p>
<p>Him and Harry don't really have moments like this- it's not their style. Maybe it's the unspoken agreement that they'll always be there for each other, no matter what, but they almost never verbalise it.</p>
<p>It's pretty much a given that if he ever needed to talk, Harry would be more than willing to listen.</p>
<p>Which is why he only smiles, throat tight, and says, "Yeah, thanks."</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>It's his birthday, yet somehow Ron feels like he should be happier than he is. After all, turning twenty-three isn't something that happens everyday.</p>
<p>Something feels different this year though. He's not sure what, and he's certainly not sure why, but it's something.</p>
<p>Hermione maybe senses it too, because she doesn't stick around for long once she's dropped off his gift.</p>
<p>(She'd gotten him desk tidy that's shaped like a knight from a chess set for his office, and a model sized broomstick made out of chocolate.</p>
<p>"You mean I can <em>eat</em> this?" he'd said when she'd presented it to him, looking at the object in his hand with glee.</p>
<p>Her laughter still rings in his ears almost two hours later.)</p>
<p>Ron knows she feels uncomfortable around his family. Even though they've assured her many times that she's basically a daughter to them, he knows she still finds it awkward.</p>
<p>Her and Ginny are still best friends- that, at least, hasn't changed. Ron's not sure what the hell they talk about most of the time, but he's aware that Ginny, too, has tried to convince Hermione that she's always welcome in the Weasley household.</p>
<p>Ron understands though, really. He can't even imagine being in the same room as her parents now that he's not with Hermione. Makes his spine tingle just thinking about it, so he can't really blame her.</p>
<p>He just longs for the days when they used to spend his birthdays together, as a couple.</p>
<p>He tries to ignore the pang in his chest when she leans in to kiss him on the cheek. All too soon she's out of his door and Ron doesn't really know what to do with himself. They'd spent his last three birthdays as just the two of them, but Ron marks those particular memories off as 'no go territory' and tries to focus on the moment.</p>
<p>Ginny taps him on the shoulder, as if she knows where his mind's been moments prior. "Having fun?" she asks in that knowing way of hers, and it's all Ron can do not to let loose the expletives he's holding in. (After all, his mother is only an earshot away, and he doesn't feel like getting yelled at like a child on his twenty third birthday, thank you very much.)</p>
<p>Ginny shrugs and walks away, leaving Ron to ponder over his inner turmoil. He's surrounded by his family and friends. You should be happy, he tells himself. So what if she's not here? He surely can't have forgotten how to have a good time without her?</p>
<p>Reaching for another firewhiskey from the dining table in front of him, Ron decides that today is going to be a totally Hermione-free day. He's not even going to think about her, because this is his birthday, and if anything should be his and only his, it should be his birthday.</p>
<p>He feels slightly ashamed of himself for it though, Hermione hasn't done anything wrong, or, at least, nothing worthy enough to earn her a lockout from Ron's thoughts.</p>
<p>He shakes the thought away as it comes, trains his ears to pick out George's voice, and makes his way over to where the loudest area of the party will most likely be.</p>
<p>He's going to have a bloody good time tonight, whether Hermione's here with him or not.<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You're delirious."</p>
<p>"Ah, but am I?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"C'mon Hermione, you know I'm right. Admit it."</p>
<p>"I know you're delirious, I'll admit that."</p>
<p>Ron laughs, shaking his head and smiling across at Hermione who is sat opposite him.</p>
<p>They've been discussing his head of department, a tough bloke called Bawtry who likes making Ron run laps around the track when he forgets to hand in assignments.</p>
<p>"There's more chance of the Cannons winning a match than him retiring." Hermione says, ribbing at him.</p>
<p>"Oi! Leave the Cannons out of this, would you?" Ron feigns indignancy, although he isn't the least bit offended by her words.</p>
<p>Hermione laughs, bringing her mug of tea to her lips and sipping slowly. They're curled up like two cats on her sofa, knees touching, hands both nursing mugs of tea.</p>
<p>It feels unbelievably normal to just be with her like this, where there's no pressure and no strain. For a moment he can pretend that they're just two friends sat chatting and playfully teasing each other.</p>
<p>Only- they're not. Because when Hermione's leg rubs against his, there's nothing innocent in the gesture. Because when he teases her about going on more dates, there's a suggestive tone underneath. Because when it's time to get up and leave, there's a hug that lasts just a touch too long.</p>
<p>He wonders if this is what happens when two people try distinctively hard not to love each other.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being an Auror is exhausting. It's not just the job either, it's the memories that it seems to pull out of his mind, out of the boxes he's hidden them in.</p>
<p>There are cases, sometimes, too gruesome to remember, too sad to forget. And Ron doesn't know how he does it.</p>
<p>He's always wanted to be an Auror. Ever since his dad used to come home from work and tell him stories about the 'dark wizard catchers' that his eight year old self would listen to attentively, all wide eyed and and eager to hear more. He's always wanted to be an auror.</p>
<p>Only... Only now he's not so sure. It's strange because... He's never felt like he would want to do anything else, job-wise. Sure, he's thought about other things but nothing that's both realistic and within his abilities.</p>
<p>It's not like it's worth thinking about anyway. It's him and Harry, always has been, and until recently, Ron had assumed that it always would be. He can't do that to his best friend. They're a team, hardly ever a case goes by that they don't work on together.</p>
<p>At first it was easy to dismiss. A thought that crept into his mind when he was off guard, compromised; in the darkest hours of the night or after a particularly exhausting day.</p>
<p>But, like all thoughts you try to repress do- it grew. And grew and grew and grew. And Ron's not sure how much longer he can keep up this facade of being okay.</p>
<p>There's only one person who knows of the doubt that rests and feeds in the back of his mind, only one person he's trusted enough to tell.</p>
<p>Hermione.</p>
<p>His feet find their way to her door almost automatically, his hand performing the routine of knocking three times in quick succession.</p>
<p>It takes her a second, but when Hermione's face appears through the crack in the door he feels a little less alone. A little less lost.</p>
<p>"Ron, hi." she says, unlocking the door and letting him inside. "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>Ron's not sure he's capable of speaking the words he wants to say, so instead he just shrugs. Runs a hand through his hair. Shuffles from foot to foot.</p>
<p>Hermione's expression is understanding- too understanding for Ron's liking but even he has to admit that it helps.</p>
<p>"Bad day." He says, hating how raspy and weak his voice sounds.</p>
<p>Hermione nods, closes the short distance between them and takes his shaking hands in her own still ones. Slowly, she leads him to the couch and he sits down when she insists.</p>
<p>His hands are still shaking. Ron hates it when his hands shake. It only happens after particularly bad nightmares or tough cases, but once it starts it feels like it'll never stop. What's worse is he feels like he can't make it stop. He has no control over his own fucking hands and he hates it.</p>
<p>He feels the sofa dip as Hermione sits down next to him. "You're okay now." she says, and Ron tries to focus on her voice to distract himself.</p>
<p>He finds himself nodding along to her reassurances even though he doesn't believe any of them. It feels like there's too much air in his body. He needs to breathe.</p>
<p>"That's it Ron. Just breathe." Hermione's voice guides him, and her hands pull him closer to her until his head is resting on her shoulder.</p>
<p>when he feels moderately less like his heart is going to burst through his ribcage and out of his body, he draws back from her.</p>
<p>Hermione waits a second before she asks him, "Are you feeling better?"</p>
<p>Ron doesn't look at her face because he knows there will be pity displayed there. So he just nods and busies his hands by playing with the fastenings on his robes.</p>
<p>"I'll make us some tea, okay?"</p>
<p>Ron nods again, even though she doesn't really need the affirmation. She knows him well enough to know what calms him down. This is just another step in their routine.</p>
<p>She comes back with the tea and lays it in front of Ron. "Is there anything else I can do?" she asks softly, taking his hand in hers again.</p>
<p>Ron clears his throat before speaking, scared it'll come out croaky. "Yeah actually... Could you just- could you just, like, talk for a little while? Just your voice. That'd be... That'd be... Yeah."</p>
<p>He doesn't know why he asks really. She probably would have done anyway. They've done this enough times by now.</p>
<p>"Of course." Hermione replies, all tender and caring, just as Ron knew she'd be. "Anything."</p>
<p>Hermione begins speaking, telling him about her day at work (how her boss mixed up the cases so she accidentally got landed with the wrong task for most of the morning,) and the latest book she's reading (a dystopian thriller called <i>'The Hogfather'</i> which sounds rather absurd to Ron but Hermione seems to find thrilling,) and reminiscing on their Hogwarts days ('Remember that time Harry dared you to jump into the black lake and you almost did?')</p>
<p>Ron doesn't say much in reply. He's content listening to the beautiful hum of her voice as she speaks animatedly about her passions, only giving the occasional laugh or murmur of agreement.</p>
<p>But he thinks, right now, this moment is wonderfully simple. He knows he'll have to leave soon- go back home, go to bed, go back to work, repeat- but right now he can almost forget all of that.</p>
<p>Because that's what being with Hermione feels like. It's a different type of getting lost to the uncertainty of being in the Aurors. With Hermione, Ron would rather stay lost than to ever resurface again.</p>
<p>With Hermione, Ron almost feels okay.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Their first argument after they've broken up happens because of her job.</p>
<p>They've had disagreements, of course they have. It's hard to be around someone constantly and not have them get on your nerves from time to time.</p>
<p>But this is different.</p>
<p>Frankly, he doesn't think Hermione should be working as much as she does. It can't be good for her health, all the long hours she works.</p>
<p>And one day, when she comes into his flat, exhausted, (as usual,) he tells her. It's a simple statement really, "Maybe you should work shorter hours."</p>
<p>However, Hermione is immediately on the defensive, "I'm perfectly capable, Ron." she says, folding her arms. Which, frankly, he thinks is a lie.</p>
<p>It's like third year all over again, when she'd bitten off more than she could chew and instead of taking smaller bites, had insisted on chewing until she'd almost choked.</p>
<p>Only this time- it's unnecessary. Her boss is perfectly reasonable, Ron knows her boss and he's an alright sort of bloke. Definitely not the type to promote overworking.</p>
<p>He tells her so, but Hermione isn't having it. "I have to work hard if I want to advance," she states, "That's how it works. You put in the work, and you move up the ranks. Simple."</p>
<p>Ron has no idea why she's so ruffled, but he's starting to get tired of her patronising tone. Besides, Hermione has enough going for her without having to invest so much of her spare time to get in people's good books. "You'll overwork yourself," he warns, "Then you'll be no use to anyone."</p>
<p>As soon as he says it, he knows he's struck a nerve.</p>
<p>Hermione's body tenses, and he can almost see her brain whizzing as she changes tactics.</p>
<p>"At any rate, it's not really your concern." she bites with venom.</p>
<p>"Of course it's my concern. We're friends aren't we?"</p>
<p>Hermione makes a <em>'hmmmph'</em> sound and purses her lips. "Yes. But being my friend doesn't grant you control over my life."</p>
<p>Ron gapes, "What? I'm not trying to- Hermione, that's not what I said at all!"</p>
<p>"It was near enough."</p>
<p>"It really wasn't."</p>
<p>"You always do this! You're constantly telling me to take a break! I don't need a break, Ron! I'm fine!" Hermione's stood up now, and she's practically shaking with rage.</p>
<p>Ron's lost track of when things went from bad to worse to disaster level, but he's too mad to make sense of it at the minute.</p>
<p>"Hermione, you come to my apartment three times a week and you're fucking exhausted! The first thing you do is fall down on the couch, and you practically fall asleep within the hour! Sometimes I don't even know why you bother coming over when half the time you just treat it like a bloody bed!"</p>
<p>There's an awful silence. Then-</p>
<p>"Fine!" she shrieks, "Fine! You want me gone? I'll go!"</p>
<p>"That's not what I-"</p>
<p>"Well maybe you need to get better at saying what you mean then!" She yells at him, and Ron doesn't even have time to be impressed that she knew the rest of his sentence.</p>
<p>"Hermione, wait- just <em>listen</em>-"</p>
<p>"I don't want to listen to you anymore Ron!" Hermione interrupts then, "I'm sick of hearing it! It was bad enough when we were together, but now..." she shakes her head, as if dispelling the thought, and turns to leave.</p>
<p>He calls her name again just before she reaches the door, hoping she'll change her mind about leaving. It's a half hearted attempt, he's fully aware.</p>
<p>Part of him (and quite a big part) is perfectly happy to see her walk out of the door, because he feels drained from their arguing.</p>
<p>The thing is- she's right. This is why they'd stopped dating.</p>
<p>Why they're never going to go back to dating.</p>
<p>Ron groans and falls back against the couch, the noise from the TV blaring into the background and against his thoughts.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>There are three things Ron Weasley hates above all else. The first is spiders, the second is being compared to others, and the third is nosy buggers who pry into his personal life.</p>
<p>The reporter who ambushes him outside his brother's shop scores two out of three, and manages to sincerely piss him off.</p>
<p>"Mr Weasley, there are numerous rumours that Hermione Granger cheated on you with Harry Potter, can you confirm this? How does it make you feel to know your lover prefers your best friend? Has this brought a strain to your relationships?"</p>
<p>Ron stands there for a second, befuddled, before the anger sets in.</p>
<p>It's not the fact that the reporter reminds him too much of Rita Skeeter, or that she's asking too many questions, or that he's in a rush that really enrages him.</p>
<p>No, it's the fact that him and Hermione have been apart for eight months now.</p>
<p>"It's none of your bloody business!" He shouts at the reporter. He knows that Hermione or Harry would've handled the situation a lot more diplomatically than Ron did, (he can almost hear Hermione's voice in his head, "Really Ron, you shouldn't have lost your temper like that, it will only make things worse.") but he's not Harry or Hermione.</p>
<p>Right now, the only thing he is is enraged and in a sour mood.</p>
<p>The reporter takes a step back, like she fears he's going to start swinging punches. Ron imagines what he must look like, stood there drenched in the rain, with bags under his eyes from lack of sleep. He doesn't blame her for backing away.</p>
<p>"Look, Hermione didn't cheat on me, certainly not with Harry, and the three of us are close as can be. Okay? Go tell that to your bullshit sources."</p>
<p>The reporter blinks, raises her quill (probably to bombard him with queries again) but Ron is gone before she has a chance to open her mouth.</p>
<p>No doubt he'll be on the front page of <em>The Prophet</em> tomorrow.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>"So... What you're telling me is that you fucked things up with her again?"</p>
<p>Ron groans. He hadn't exactly been expecting support from Harry when he'd confessed details of their argument, but even so- he was beginning to regret ever telling Harry anything.</p>
<p>"No. Well, I mean, yes- but not like that. It was about her job, that's all. It's not because we, y'know, got back together or anything..." He trails off, unsure if this aids or hinders the point he's trying to make.</p>
<p>Harry shrugs. "Wouldn't bother me if you did. I just think you need to keep your distance because things like this always seem to happen just as you get too close."</p>
<p>Ron's about to retort, when his brain makes him stop. Harry has got a point. Distance is something him and Hermione have never really mastered.</p>
<p>"So..." he opts for instead, changing the topic altogether, "How are you and Ginny?"</p>
<p>As if Ron's just delivered some extremely bad news, Harry bristles. "Fine."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." he says resolutely. There's a pause in which Ron gives up trying to figure out the mess that is his sister's relationship with Harry. Harry, too, seems to reconsider, for he lets out a long breath before speaking once more, "Look, I'm not going to tell you we're both happy with each other right now, because we're not. It's complicated but we're working through it." He stops for a second, setting his jaw, "And if I'm not allowed to ask questions about you and Hermione, than you're not allowed to ask questions about me and Ginny."</p>
<p>The way Harry says it lets Ron know that it's not up for debate, and Ron raises his eyebrows. It's extremely aware that Harry sets boundaries of any kind, so he knows to take this seriously.</p>
<p>"Sure. Yeah. Okay. That seems... Reasonable."</p>
<p>Harry nods, satisfied.</p>
<p>Rearranging the order of papers on his desk just for something to fill the break in the conversation, Ron almost achingly feels the need to lighten the atmosphere. He's already fallen out with Hermione, he'll be damned if he lets this dispute turn out the same way.</p>
<p>Opening his mouth to speak, it becomes apparent that Harry also had the same idea when Ron is interrupted by his best mate's voice. "I know we're working late tonight but I could really use a fly after this shift. Fancy heading out?" Harry asks. He almost pulls off trying to sound nonchalant. Almost.</p>
<p>"Sounds great." says Ron, who has secretly been counting down the hours until he can leave his desk all day, "As long as you let me try with your nimbus, mine's absolute shite and practically falling apart."</p>
<p>Harry nods his head yes and Ron muses over the striking talent him and Harry share when it comes to avoiding difficult conversations.<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They don't exactly resolve their argument. Not exactly. It just sort of... fades away.</p>
<p>He's having a dream about flying his Dad's Ford Anglia to Australia and back when the phone rings.</p>
<p>Ron's used to his phone ringing in the middle of the night. The muggle device had been Hermione's idea, as an alternative to using the floo or apparating to the other's flat when they woke up with the terrors of the past.</p>
<p>"Ron?" her voice is raw and scratchy, desperate and scared.</p>
<p>All thoughts of last week's argument vanishes when he hears her, the panic in her voice snapping him to his senses.</p>
<p>"I'm here, Hermione. I'm right here." he says because sometimes that's enough.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>"Are you... Are you okay?"</p>
<p>"I'm fine. I'm completely fine."</p>
<p>He can hear her breaths coming out in bursts through the small receiver, "Good," she chokes out.</p>
<p>"Just breathe, okay? Hermione, listen to me, just focus on my voice. You're fine, everything's fine, it was just a dream."</p>
<p>Hermione mumbles in response, and Ron's heart breaks a little, just as it does every time she rings.</p>
<p>This has been their system for a few months now. It hadn't been a problem when they were dating, because Hermione was always an arm's reach away from him at any point during the night.</p>
<p>Despite the war ending over four years ago, the effects haven't completely worn off. (Ron supposes they probably never will, but then he hears his therapist's voice in the back of his mind 'Scars will heal with time,' and he guesses that could also be true. Either way, they're not done fighting. Not yet.)</p>
<p>It had been trial and error at first. Ron hadn't known whether he was speaking too loudly or too quietly, but after a few mishaps and an abundance of patience from Hermione, he'd gradually gotten the hang of it.</p>
<p>Hermione's end of the line is silent for a while. "Sorry for waking you." She says, as she always does.</p>
<p>"You don't have to apologise, it's fine." he replies, as he always does. "You know you've done the same for me."</p>
<p>He can almost feel the smile in her voice when she says, "Thank you, Ron."</p>
<p>"No problem. Are you okay now?"</p>
<p>"I think I will be."</p>
<p>"Good. Call me again if you need, okay?"</p>
<p>"I will, don't worry."</p>
<p>"Okay, great. Well then, goodnight, Hermione."</p>
<p>"Goodnight Ron."</p>
<p>He's just about to end the call when he hears her voice again, "Wait, Ron? Are you still there?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, er, yeah, I'm still here. Everything okay?"</p>
<p>"Everything's fine... I just- Thank you. Again."</p>
<p>Ron frowns, bemused. "It's fine, anytime. Anytime, Hermione."</p>
<p>"Goodnight then." she says, and her voice sounds quieter than usual.</p>
<p>"Goodnight."</p>
<p>Ron takes a while to go back to sleep after that.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It happens one night when they're both tipsy from celebrating her promotion to the department of magical law.</p>
<p>It's a small gathering really, just them, Harry, Ginny, and a few of Hermione's co-workers. Ron's on his second round of firewhiskey when Harry announces he's leaving.</p>
<p>"Sorry Hermione, but I'm exhausted and I don't think it'd be wise for me to drink any more seeing as I've got work tomorrow." he shrugs, looking apologetic in true Harry fashion.</p>
<p>Hermione smiles at him kindly. "It's completely fine Harry. I don't imagine we'll be here much longer anyway." She stands up to hug Harry goodbye, leaning to kiss him on the cheek as she does so. He leans down to whisper something in her ear which Hermione apparently finds amusing as she laughs and swats at his arm.</p>
<p>Harry sighs but Ron can tell it's in jest.</p>
<p>They leave one by one, until it's just Ron and Hermione at the counter.</p>
<p>"Er- I guess we should get off then?" Suggests Ron to her, and even he can hear the reluctance in his voice.</p>
<p>"Mmmmm." Hermione agrees, but she too doesn't sound all that keen on the idea.</p>
<p>"How much did you drink?" Ron asks, concerned about her ability to get home safely.</p>
<p>Hermione laughs and waves his worry aside with her hand, "Not that much, I still have work to do tomorrow you know."</p>
<p>"Really? You're planning on working tomorrow? Give yourself a break Hermione, fucking hell."</p>
<p>Shaking her head, Hermione returns to the cocktail she's sipping and smiles, "I can't slack off just because of a promotion, Ron."</p>
<p>Ron must still look incredulous, because Hermione puts her hand on his shoulder and leans in closer. "I did have a good time tonight, though. Thank you."</p>
<p>Ron nods as if it's normal for them to be in such close proximity, "Me too." he breathes in a whisper.</p>
<p>And then they're kissing. Hermione, the feel of her soft lips, her hands either side of his head, the taste of alcohol in his mouth. It's over far too quickly for Ron's liking, but he doesn't give them a chance to come to terms with what they're doing before he leans in again.</p>
<p>It's Hermione, and it feels right under the dim lighting in the pub, old hits playing on the jukebox. Granted, it's not how Ron's imagined this happening, but the difference location doesn't change the familiarity of the feeling.</p>
<p>Which may be why he readily agrees when she asks him back to her place.</p>
<p>This time, there really is no kidding himself. He had known exactly what Hermione's intentions were as soon as the words had left her mouth.</p>
<p>He wishes he could blame it on the alcohol, but the truth is that neither of them had more than two glasses to drink.</p>
<p>They apparate back to her flat in a hurry and there's no time wasted in trivial things such as making tea or conversation. Hermione's lips attach themselves to his as soon as his feet are planted on the ground, and he puts up no resistance, sinking into the feel of her.</p>
<p>Ron runs his hands down her body and she moans into his mouth, leading them both to the bedroom.</p>
<p>Ron revels in the familiarity of it. Despite the eight months since their breakup, everything about her, her taste, her touch, the feel of her, is so familiar and comforting, that it's only now Ron realises how long he's been deprived of such intimacy.</p>
<p>There are no words spoken that night. (Save for Ron's breathy whisper of '<em>Are you sure'</em>, Hermione's impatient reply, '<em>Of course I am</em>', and the whispered contraceptive charms.) Ron falls asleep to the sound of her gentle breaths beside him.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The first thing Ron sees when he wakes up is the sleeping form of Hermione laying next to him. He startles for a second, before the events of last night catch up to him. <em>Oh shit</em>, he thinks, and it's like a mantra repeated in his head: <em>shit shit shit shit shit shit shit.</em></p>
<p>It's all wrong. Apart from the expletives, Ron's primary thought is: <em>this is all wrong</em>.</p>
<p>What have they done? Ron watches Hermione's chest rise and fall with each soft breath and a wave of nostalgia hits him like a brick. This is how things used to be between them. <em>This is how things should be between us</em>, he thinks, and then promptly denies thinking.</p>
<p>And of course it's not, because this is all wrong. If there were a prize for how wrong something was, Ron would bet his entire life savings that this would win it.</p>
<p>Him and Hermione had slept together. They weren't dating, but they'd slept together. Ron tries to push the nagging voice that sounds an awful lot like his mother out of his head, preaching about promiscuity and indecency.</p>
<p>He drinks in her features, admiring the way she looks so peaceful in her sleep, and he hates himself. He hates himself because now he's gone and fucked things up between them and there is no way in hell she's ever going to want anything to do with him for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>He hates himself because he can only imagine the pain on her face and realises what they've done. He can hear her voice in his head now: <em>'This was all a mistake, a huge, huge mistake, and I'm sorry Ron but I don't think it's appropriate for us to be around each other anymore.'</em></p>
<p>Despite the fact that this was her idea, Ron's positive it will be a source of regret. He's full of guilt, and doubt, and grief because he already knows what has to happen.</p>
<p>He has to leave.</p>
<p>Looking at her face for a final time, committing every tiny detail to memory, Ron sits up as gently as he can. Hermione doesn't stir and Ron lets out the breath he's been holding, waiting.</p>
<p>His clothes are scattered about the room, so he casts a simple accio charm and gathers them up in his arms. He doesn't quite fancy walking out of her flat with his bits on display, so instead he changes in her tiny en-suite, making as little noise as possible so as not to wake her.</p>
<p>He debates apparating just there and then, or whether he should leave a note. After all, what kind of bloke shags his ex-girlfriend and then leaves the next morning with no explanation? Nevermind what's easy, Ron thinks as he roots around for a paper and pen. <em>You owe her this one, Weasley.</em></p>
<p>He scribbles some words down (he's never been good with words.) and turns to leave, but something makes him stop. Maybe it's the unfulfilled state of leaving without seeing her, or the longing he can already feel tightening his chest, but he makes his way back to her.</p>
<p>Leaning down ever so slowly, Ron brushes a kiss against her forehead lightly. It's stupid, and yeah, maybe it's a bit reckless, but Ron doesn't care. Hermione mumbles in her sleep, but she doesn't wake.</p>
<p>He tries not to think about how the syllable that rolled off of her slumbered lips was most definitely his name, instead whispering an apology into the silence of dawn and turning to leave.</p>
<p>He's always been good at leaving.</p>
