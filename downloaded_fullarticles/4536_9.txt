    <p>Early morning sunlight filtered through the heavy curtains that hung in front of Credence’s bedroom window. He stirred on the bed, stretching with a small squeak and the pop of several joints. The house was quiet, and even the ambient noise from outside seemed somehow dampened. Absently curious just how early it was, the young man slid out of bed and peered out of his bedroom down the hall.</p><p>No signs of life, but a quick glance across the hall to Mr. Graves’ room told him the older man wasn’t in there. Credence wandered down the hall towards the kitchen and found a quickly scrawled note. The man’s handwriting put Credence’s mediocre reading skills to the test, but the best he could glean, he’d had an early morning meeting, but would return as soon as possible, and would Credence care to join him for lunch? </p><p>It wasn’t like he had any other plans, Credence thought a little dryly. But, ever a proper gentleman, of course Mr. Graves would ask first. With a small chuckle and a shake of his head, Credence let the note fall back to the table. Even though it was a moderately sized apartment they shared, or more accurately that Mr. Graves allowed him to take up a small corner of, it felt downright cavernous when he was alone. Especially with the lingering fear now that Grindelwald was on the loose again. A sudden chill raced up his arms, and Credence rubbed at them absently through the thin linen of his nightshirt. He wished that Mr. Graves had lit a fire in the fireplace before leaving, but it looked like he’d been called out on short notice. Perhaps there was a development in Grindelwald’s escape?</p><p>Credence shook his head hard to dislodge the growing anxiety that gnawed at the back of his mind. “I need a distraction,” he said aloud. It was a trick he’d learned as a child; if he spoke out loud, heard himself, he was more likely to believe whatever he’d said, plus it helped chase away the monsters.</p><p>Or so he’d thought, at any rate.</p><p>Worrying at the inside of his cheek, Credence stared somewhat absently around the apartment, not sure what to do with himself. “A shower,” he finally decided. “I need one anyway, so why not now?” With a decisive nod, Credence pivoted on his bare foot and headed for the bathroom.</p><p>Like everything else in Mr. Graves’ home, it was tastefully opulent, a subtle nod to just how much money Mr. Graves had if you knew what to look for. Tile, burnished brass accents, high quality porcelain. Either through the mysteries of indoor plumbing, or some kind of magic, the floor was comfortably warm beneath his bare feet. Nothing that made his social standing obvious to the casual observer, as Credence had seen before; understated, tasteful. Intimidating in its own right. Still-too-thin fingers drifted slowly along the edge of the bright tile counter, savoring the smooth feeling against his skin. He looked up at himself in the mirror, a long, shimmering thing that reflected the image of himself down to his waist. </p><p>There had been no mirrors in the church where he’d grown up. Ma insisted that it would only promote vanity, so forbade them. And it wasn’t like Credence spent a lot of time in places that had mirrors either; as a result, he was unfamiliar with how his own body looked. He glanced nervously around, as if someone might be watching, before slowly stripping out of his nightshirt.</p><p>The first thing Credence noticed about himself was how pale he was. He thought for a brief moment that if he stood naked in the snow, he’d be nearly invisible. It made his black hair even more striking, now growing into a more even length with little curls that wrapped around the tips of his ears. On top of that, his skin was extremely thin; he could see the vein in his neck throbbing with his unexpectedly skipping pulse, a streak of blue beneath his skin. Though truth be told, everything about him was thin; despite having spent over a month living with Mr. Graves, he was still a little bony. His ribs were too prominent, his elbows too pointy, and his hip bones jutted awkwardly over the edge of his pants. Credence hooked his thumbs into the waistband as if to slide them down, but paused. Instead, fingers still holding onto the fabric, he swallowed hard and turned, keeping his eyes on the mirror as his back came into view.</p><p>His first real look at his back was startling. Credence closed his eyes with a sharp intake of breath, feeling his heart skip a beat. He had suspected it would be bad, but not nearly so bad as all that. After a moment, he opened his eyes again and looked closely. A vast network of scars littered his back, thickest across his shoulders. One hand drifted up his back at an angle, his fingers tracing the two thickest welts. Most of the scars had faded into memory as to how he’d come by them; those two, he remembered distinctly. The searing pain of the belt buckle was likely a sensation he’d never forget.</p><p>Tears welled up in his eyes, and he turned abruptly away from the sight of himself. His hands trembled a little, and he fought back the shame that threatened to choke him. Perhaps it was best that Mr. Graves seemed to be keeping his distance; how could he want to look at that, after all?</p><p>That didn’t stop the wanting, though.</p><p>Somewhat more aggressively than necessary. Credence shoved his pants down and turned back around to face the whole of himself in the mirror. He took a step back from the sink, revealing himself down to the mid thigh. The angle of his hips was more pronounced now that he was naked, casting deep shadows across his fair skin. A shock of dark curls surrounded the base of his shaft, which he belatedly realized was hardening, even as he watched. Once again looking around, as if afraid he was being watched by some unseen observer, he looked back at the mirror and watched himself as he wrapped one slim hand around himself. </p><p>It was rare that Credence allowed himself the luxury of self-pleasure. He hadn’t even intentionally tried it until after his first meeting with the man he thought was Mr. Graves. More than once, he’d woken to find himself hard and aching, or laying in some mystery wet spot, but those were few and far between; Ma made it out to be extremely shameful, so he did his best to stifle those urges, along with everything else. He’d gotten so good at it, even in his newfound freedom, he didn’t indulge often. Certainly never in front of a mirror. But on occasion, late at night when he was sure Mr. Graves was asleep, he would bury his face in his pillow to muffle the noises he made, and bring himself to climax as quickly as he could, picturing those deft fingers, those soft lips on him.</p><p>His eyes were wide with fascination as he watched his hand move up and down his velvety soft length, feeling the hot flesh grow and harden beneath his fingers. Goosebumps rippled over his skin, and a whispered moan snuck past his lips. He bit down hard on his cheek to silence himself, then remembered Mr. Graves mentioning something about sound-proofing, after he’d worried the neighbors had heard him in the throes of an ugly nightmare. Secure then in his privacy, Credence relaxed a little and let himself moan.</p><p>The sound was throaty, pure in its honest obscenity. He let the sound roll around in his mouth, echoing off the cold tiles. Pre-cum glimmered on the head of his reddening shaft, dribbling down to add an addictive slick to the sensation. Heat was building fast at the base of his spine, a coiled tension that grew the longer he touched himself. He wasn’t so unfamiliar with his own body that he didn’t recognize the signs of nearing orgasm, so he quickly released himself, gaze lingering briefly on how red and swollen he was before turning to the shower and flipping the water on as hot as he could stand.</p><p>After all, if he was going to make a mess, best to do it somewhere that clean up would be easy.</p><p>Taking a quick moment to snag the straight edge razor Mr. Graves had loaned him for the once-weekly shaves he had to do, Credence stepped into the shower and set the razor in the small alcove in the wall. Scalding water hit his skin and made him hiss. Hot showers were a new-found addiction of his; years spent with nothing more than a bowl of cold water and a sponge gave him a deep appreciation for the indulgence of it. Turning his back to the water, Credence tipped his head back and let the water slick his hair back. </p><p>With his head still back, he dropped his hand back down to his now-aching cock, gasping a little at the renewed contact. His other hand he propped on the wall for support, spreading his legs for better balance. Now slippery with water, Credence’s hand moved faster and easier, a new sensation that made his knees weak. His moans grew louder, muffled by the sound of the pouring water. He dropped his head down again, eyes half lidded as he watched himself. “Oh God…” he panted, licking his lips. Knowing he was alone, he felt emboldened and let his mind wander to a favorite fantasy of his; the two of them sprawled on Mr. Graves’ huge bed, Credence laying on his belly with the older man stretched across his back, buried deep inside of him. “Oh God, Graves…”</p><p>Holding that image in his mind, it didn’t take long for Credence to near his climax. Just as he crested, muscles tensing as he cried out Graves’ name, his hand slipped off the wall and dropped down to the shelf of the alcove. He sliced open the heel of his hand, the moan of pleasure sharply cut by a surprised shout. Something about the sting, the unexpectedness of it, intensified his orgasm. It dragged on longer, nearly bringing him to his knees as he felt the thick slick of his cum spill over his hand. Coffee dark eyes with pupils blown wide stared in open amazement at the cut of red across his hand, the stinging pain that heightened the deep throb of pleasure…</p><p>“Credence?!” The sound of the bathroom door opening quickly started him badly, and Credence pressed himself against the wall, staring at the frosted glass of the shower door that obscured the details of the silhouette he knew better than his own.</p><p>“M-Mr. Graves?!” he blurted back in shock, his softening cock still in one hand while the other dripped blood down into the water at his feet.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Mr. Graves’ voice was deep with concern, though he was at least considerate enough to stay in the doorway. He wasn’t totally sure, but he thought that the older wizard kept his face turned politely to the side, not looking at his own blurred silhouette through the glass.</p><p>“Y-yes. Yes, I’m fine,” Credence answered unsteadily. “I just…I just cut myself is all.” God above, how much had he heard? He felt a hot blush creep up his neck that he knew had nothing to do with the hot water.</p><p>“Oh. Oh, alright.” Mr. Graves took one step towards the shower, then froze. “Do you…” He seemed to be weighing his question, as if unsure how it might be taken. “Would you like me to take care of it for you?”</p><p>Credence closed both eyes and exhaled as slowly and as silently as he could manage. The sound of that deep voice was doing naughty things to him, stirring Credence to half-hardness again despite his recent release. The proximity, how easy it would be for them to just…</p><p>But no. That would never happen.</p><p>“Ah…n-no, Mr. Graves. I’m sure it will be fine. It’s just a small cut, the bleeding is slowing.” That much was true; the cut had been shallow, and was already beginning to clot.</p><p>Mr. Graves made an unconvinced noise in the back of his throat, and Credence could see him hesitate, but after a moment, he retreated back into the hall. “I’ll wait here until you finish, so I can look at it before I go back.”</p><p>“Why are you back?” Credence asked suddenly, realizing he hadn’t been expecting Mr. Graves home for several more hours.</p><p>There was a pause, then Mr. Graves sighed heavily. “There was an unconfirmed sighting of Grindelwald a few hours ago, just outside the city. I wanted to ensure that everything was alright here before beginning the search for him. It looks like we’ll have to postpone lunch this afternoon, I hope you don’t mind.” Credence’s blood froze in his veins, and he was quiet for long enough that Mr. Graves stepped back into the bathroom. “Credence?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” he snapped back, voice taut with anxiety. “Just…no, that’s fine, of course. Your work is important. Thank you for checking on me, Mr. Graves. I…I’ll be out in just a minute.” He didn’t want to talk about Grindelwald, not in such a vulnerable state, not so close to the man whose scent filled his nostrils and made his pulse pound. He did not want to color this intimate, sexual moment with that man’s name on his mind. </p><p>Mr. Graves seemed to sense he was no longer welcome, so nodded curtly and turned on his slick heel. “I’ll be in the kitchen, then,” he said, not quite brusque, but harsher than usual, even for him. The door clicked shut firmly behind him, and Credence let out a heavy breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. Too many conflicting emotions and sensations whirled through him, so instead of trying to sort them out, he finished his shower quickly, foregoing the shave. He dressed with the same alacrity, and met Mr. Graves in the kitchen.</p>
