          <div class="userstuff"><p>4 years. 4 years of waiting, hoping and bitter disappointment. For what? You may ask, I'll tell you: my Hogwarts Letter. Every day since my 11th birthday I have been desperately waiting for an owl to knock at my window and give me an old-fashioned, yellowish faded letter with a red wax seal on it. And every single year, I was greeted with disappointment when there was no owl to bring the post of my dreams. So here I am, 15 years of age and preparing for the next bitter pill. "Leo!".</p>
<p>My thoughts were interrupted by someone yelling my name, to be exact, my mom yelling my name up the stairs. °thank goodness, I didn't have my earphones on° I thought, she hates it more than anything when she has to say my name 50 times without me hearing it.</p>
<p>"What?" I yell back, the answer follows shortly "Lunch's ready!"-"Coming!".</p>
<p>I put my Computer away and made my way out of my blanket fort. Yes, you heard me correctly, a 15-year-old girl having a blanket ford. Judge me all you want, these things, are bloody amazing!</p>
<p>I walked out of my room, down the stairs, passed the kitchen and walked into the living room where our dining table stood. I looked curiously at the table. Fish fingers. My brown eyes light up. I freaking love this stuff, there even better with custard but my parents think it's disgusting sooo ... no custard and fish fingers for me. I walked to my chair, wanting to sit down, only to notice my lovely black cat named Little there. Seemingly having decided to use my chair as a sleeping spot. I looked at her "Really?!". My voice oozed with annoyance. Seriously don't get me wrong, I love this cat and I would give my life for her, but sometimes...</p>
<p>Sighing I took one more step forward, gently lifted her up and sat her down at her pile of blankets or Throne as I prefer to call it. Walking back again I finally sat down and waited for my parents.</p>
<p>My Father was the first to come in and sat down. "Where's Mom?" I asked looking to my left. My father shrugged "Outside, Smoking I think". I rolled my eyes. Cigarettes. The worst thing to be ever created and I hate it when my mom's smoking. Because every single one of those dammed things shortens her life about five minutes and as much she annoys me sometimes, I don't want her to die.</p>
<p>As she finally came back inside we started lunch and talked about nothing in particular.</p>
<p>Having finished, I beamed:" Very delicious". "Thank you" came the answer and a chuckle from my right "Will you cook tomorrow?". Thinking for a few seconds I asked "You're at home? or at Work?"-"Home". I pouted so no flesh for me and dad cause my mom's vegetarian. God knows why because come on flesh is the best thing in existence!</p>
<p>"Kay. I'm gonna look for something" with that I stood up and brought my plate to the dishwasher. Which is, by the way, the second greatest thing to be ever invented because I personally think washing the dishes by hand is just GROSS.</p>
<p>Having been invited to a Birthday Party of my father's best friend my parents said Goodbye about half an hour later. Not that I was really bothered by it because FREEDOM. Finally, I had the couch and the big TV for myself and no parents telling me I should spend more time outside and socialize. A shiver made his way through my body because simply the thought of it was terrible. Don't get me wrong I don't hate EVERYBODY just...most.</p>
<p>I started the PlayStation and played Mario Kart or at least I attempted to because trust me when I tell you I'm literally the worst in Mario Kart. I fall off the road every 15 seconds or drive in some sort of wall. 2 1/2 hours of cursing later I gave up and threw the controller with a loud "FUCK YOU" to the other side of the couch, well I wanted it to land there but since I don't really have a great aim it landed on the floor. "God dammit.." I signed and got up to get it.</p>
<p>There came a sound from our front door, to be more precise from our mail slot.</p>
<p>Assuming that it was simply some letters for my parents I made my way to the door but there was something that I hadn't really expected: A old-fashioned, yellowish faded letter with a red wax seal enriching it. I simply stood there for 2 minutes starring while my brain desperately tried to catch up on what was going on. Still being in a slight daze, I made the last few steps and picked up the letter. Turning it over it read in elegant cursive handwriting:</p>
<p>Miss L. O'Moore</p>
<p>The Room Upstairs</p>
<p>662 St. John's Road</p>
<p>Oxford</p>
<p>OX25 5KC</p>
<p>4 years. 4 Years of waiting, hoping and bitter disappointment. For what? You may ask, I'll tell you: This.</p></div>
