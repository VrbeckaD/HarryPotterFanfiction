          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Come on baby,” murmured Harry to a reluctant Scorpius. “You can stroke the Puffskein. I promise he’s not going to hurt you.” </p>
<p>Scorpius, however wasn’t <em>quite</em> as confident. He looked down at the custard yellow creature that was currently sat upon his Daddy’s lap and shuddered. A long thin pink tongue had emerged from the furry beast’s mouth and was slowly creeping over towards him. Was it going to <em>bite</em> him? </p>
<p>Scorpius couldn’t risk it. </p>
<p>He buried his head in the soft folds of his Daddy’s jumper, taking a big breath of his familiar scent. Daddy Harry always smelled like Treacle Tart and cut-grass, and that calmed his racing heart a little. Scorpius knew if he was with his Daddy then he was absolutely safe. </p>
<p>Daddy didn't move though. The Puffskein was making a tiny humming noise, and Daddy Harry laughed. “That means he <em>likes</em> you, baby. That’s the noise a Puff makes when they want to be your friend.”</p>
<p>Scorpius soon realised that his Daddy wasn’t going to budge. Very carefully, Scorpius wriggled free from his shoulder and peered at the fuzzy ball through narrowed eyes. He reached out a finger to pet the Puffskein, only to speedily retreat his arm when it licked him. </p>
<p>“Very good, sweetheart!” Daddy smiled, squeezing his arm lightly. “Try again. You <em>can</em> pet him.”</p>
<p>Draco watched from the other side of their baby. He kept quiet, not wanting to break the moment between Harry and their son. Draco knew, just as Harry did, that Scorpius would pet the magical beast eventually. Sometimes you just needed that little bit of extra courage. </p>
<p>Draco leaned back, wiggling his hips. His bump was growing, and felt more pronounced suddenly. Only two months now till the birth of their second baby. Draco wondered idly what life would be like with their new, bigger family. </p>
<p>As Draco watched, Scorpius tried once again. A plump baby hand gingerly stroked the Puffskein, and his beautiful blond baby giggled. “I’m doing it Daddies! Stroking a P’skein!” </p>
<p>Harry pressed a kiss into Scorpius’s soft white hair, the pride in his face evident and real. “You did, Scorp! Well done!”</p>
<p>Their life together would be wonderful, Draco decided.</p></div>
