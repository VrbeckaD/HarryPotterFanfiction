    <p align="center">Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger/Draco Malfoy</p><p align="center">-Having to be very quiet for fear of being heard-</p><p align="center">xXx</p><p>She shushed him softly, the faintest smirk tilting her lips. “Now, now love,” She whispered. “Remember, if you're not quiet we’ll be heard.”</p><p>He whimpered. A deep chuckled rumbled low on his other side, hands ghosting up his side along the flat plains of his abs. On the opposite side, kisses were laid along his neck and shoulder, nips from perfect white teeth mixed in. He dug his hands into the bedding beneath him, the nylon of his cot hissing as he moved ever so slightly.</p><p>“<em> Charlie </em>.” he breathed as strong, calloused hands trailed beneath the band of his sweatpants. His fingers traced his pubic bone before wrapping a large hand around his cock. His gasp was swallowed up by a sinful kiss, a playful nip distracting him long enough for Charlie to get his sleeping bag opened up.</p><p>“Hermione darling, give me a hand down here, won’t you.” Charlie whispered softly, a stark contrast to his rugged exterior. Hermione hummed, trailing her lips across Draco’s torso as she complied. Charlie slipped Darco’s sweatpants down his narrow hips, freeing his cock and Draco’s entire body tensed subconsciously as two sets of hands, one large and rough, one soft and petite, wrapped themselves around his cock.</p><p>Together they began a teasing dance, driving him mad as they took turns interchanging their hands and mouths. They worked together seamlessly to send him over the edge, leaving him a shaking, wanton mess as he struggled to remain silent for fear of being heard by the rest of the tent.</p><p>“I think we’ve wrecked him love.” Charlie whispered.</p><p>“Too bad we’re not done yet.” she added with a giggle.</p><p>Draco whimpered, his body going lax as they started again.</p>
