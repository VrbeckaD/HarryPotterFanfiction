    <p>Harry had no idea that it wasn't just the Locket affecting him as they searched for the Horcruxes. Yes, the Locket very obviously affected his friends but it was always both easier and harder for him to wear the Locket. It was something he never shared with Ron or Hermione, not that he noticed it much himself.</p><p>Yet someone else <i>did</i> notice. The Locket wasn't as aware as the Diary had been but it was aware enough to notice something was odd with the green-eyed young man. It was even eventually aware enough to reach out and touch the familiar double presence in Harry's scar. As a result the three fragments of soul shared their knowledge and came to a startling conclusion, Harry Potter needed to live. Locket became more vicious and magic hungry whenever it was carried by anyone but Harry. This helped to drive Ron away and very nearly destroyed Hermione. A whisper of caution from the Diary fragment eased the effects on the witch somewhat, pointing out her potential use and protecting her from insanity.</p><p>Ron's return displeased the three horcruxes but they allowed it when he rescued Harry from the frozen pond along with the sword. They noticed Snape nearby via the Dark Mark and wondered, eventually deciding that the man would guard Harry if they could arrange it. Their joint knowledge of his skill outweighed his snarky attitude and they could always ensure his loyalty with the right spell.</p><p>The three soul fragments refused to be carried by anyone but Harry after the sword was retrieved. They even went so far as to allow Ron to destroy Locket's physical form with only a token resistance before moving to Harry's scar, nestled in next to its brother fragments.</p><p>When the trio saw Snape being attacked Harry felt himself whisper a spell he had no knowledge of. The spy had been too weak to do anything but accept the bond that the magic placed. He was both furious and grateful that the magic flowing from the new bond kept him alive. He still had to fight to stay awake and deliver the message from Dumbledore required by one of his vows before succumbing to the healing magical coma.</p><p>The Cup had been stubborn but eventually saw their reasoning and refrained from harming any of the trio. It still disliked allowing its form to be destroyed by Basilisk Venom. Cup settled in Harry's Scar next to the other three as easily as Locket had.</p><p>Diadem was destroyed before Harry could get to it and was very shocked to find its self being shoved inside Harry's scar next to its brethren, much to all of their consternation. After a brief mental shuffle and then a sharing of memories all of them settled down.</p><p>When Harry went to die in the forest though the soul pieces had had enough. The emerald spell flew through the air and Harry found himself sprawled on the forest floor in such a way that no one thought he had planned it, narrowly missing the killing blow. Diary, being the largest and strongest was volunteered to merge with the Dark Lord and share what they had learned. The headache for both wizards was immense.</p><p>"Accio Potter!" Voldemort snapped out the moment the new information settled in his mind enough for him to understand the implications.</p><p>Harry was too confused to fight back and quickly found himself bound and kneeling at the feet of his enemy.</p><p>"It seems that Dumbledore's plans are not as cleaver as he thought them to be," Voldemort snarled.</p><p>"Why aren't I dead?" Harry asked, half afraid that the earlier comment was his answer.</p><p>"You. Are. <i>Mine!</i>" Voldemort snarled as he forced Harry into looking at him, directing the younger wizard's gaze with a firm grip anchored in messy hair.</p><p>"What?" Harry asked in obvious confusion.</p><p>"That old man was far too clever, hiding the fact that you have been mine since the night your parents died, ensuring that you were tortured so that you would see him as a savior. He did it all to make you follow him blindly, to shape you into a sacrifice so that you would offer yourself up for death at his whim. I understand now and I am claiming what was stolen from me. You will live and be trained properly but remember that defiance has a cost my little snake hidden in lion's skin," Voldemort informed him. He allowed their little audience to listen in shock even as he didn't bother to hide that he was clearly angry at Dumbledore's deception.</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Harry asked with apprehension even as his eyes betrayed the growing suspicion and frantic denial.</p><p>"The Dursleys," Voldemort said succinctly. Harry's shoulders slumped, admitting to himself that he had hoped their mistreatment of him had just been that they were crappy relatives.</p><p>"What happens now?" Harry rasped, to exhausted at this point to fight.</p><p>"We retrieve Severus so that he can survive to serve you properly, announce that we've come to an agreement, and go home to rest. Tomorrow a piece will be published in the paper that we are negotiating what happens next. That little headache you gave me forced me to realize we are destroying what we want to protect. Now that I have you its time to end the killing and start rebuilding. My custody of you is non-negotiable. Everything else can be discussed when we have all rested and healed. Who else do you want to represent Dumbledore's party at the negotiations? It most certainly won't be you," Voldemort explained ending with the almost gentle inquiry.</p><p>"McGonagall... I don't know who else," Harry muttered, the adrenaline crash kicking in with a vengeance.</p><p>"Sleep, I'll deal with the rest for now," Voldemort ordered, following it up with a sleep spell that finished what the adrenaline crash had started. Harry gratefully allowed unconsciousness to claim him.</p><p>Harry woke slowly, the sound of breathing from at least one other person, a comfort he hadn't realized that he had missed. The warmth of the blankets, the relief that he no longer had to fight on the run, the fact that not only was the Dark Lord being <i>reasonable</i> but had promised him a form of safety helped him simply be. He wasn't sure what the man had meant about Snape but it wasn't something he was as worried about since 1) he didn't hate the man anymore and 2) the retrieval meant he was <i>alive</i>. He was also <i>really</i> glad not to be tied up anymore and didn't want to risk a repeat just yet.</p><p>"So you are awake," Voldemort said softly from the darkness. A darkness Harry refused to try to break by actually opening his eyes. He could hear a second pair of lungs as they continued breathing even as the Dark Lord spoke telling him that at least one other person was in the room with the two of them.</p><p>"Hmm," Harry answered with a hum of warm sleepiness into the darkness.</p><p>Voldemort huffed in amusement but let him be. The sound of a turning page told Harry what the older wizard was doing. Hours were spent like that, with Harry drifting in and out of a half sleep while Voldemort read and the third person slept. A couple of times he heard the book be set aside in favor of potions being administered to Harry or spelled into the other person. The effects on his own body told him that they were healing potions, just as the breathing of the sleeper getting noticeably easier told him the same about the other potions.</p><p>"~Tom? Why are we keeping them?~" Nagini finally hissed into the quiet.</p><p>"~Because the old fool tricked me. Harry should have been protected and raised as my hatchling when he survived my attack. Unfortunately the old fool tricked everyone, even me, into believing that I am his rightful prey. I discovered in the forest that he carries a piece of me and is of us. It was one of the pieces he rescued that hurt my head and washed away enough of the bad magics that had been hurting me so that I knew I was destroying what was to be my nest. Most humans take care not to destroy their own nest because it puts present and future hatchlings at risk. The magics that had me hurting in my mind were telling me that everything in my territory and even my nest was an enemy trying to steal my territory. I know better now,~" Voldemort answered calmly. Nagini hissed in pleasure at the change in her wizard and accepted the explanation.</p><p>"~That doesn't explain why I am alive,~" Severus hissed out in a pained wheeze.</p><p>"You speak Parseltongue?" Voldemort asked curiously in as calm a tone as one could imagine.</p><p>"~I do,~" Harry hissed out, giving up on trying to sleep and reluctantly opening his eyes to low candle light glowing just beyond the curtains surrounding most of his comfy bed.</p><p>"~I... didn't before,~" Severus admitted with a reluctant hiss.</p><p>"Interesting. I can think of several ways this might have happened. Anything from side effects of Nagini's bite to an aspect of the antivenom to being transferred by the bond Potter unknowingly cast upon you to drawing it through the bond so that you might communicate in your damaged condition. Something to investigate later," Voldemort mused.</p><p>"What bond?" Harry asked suspiciously.</p><p>"As you were generally the closer of us when each Horcrux was destroyed most of them became a part of your scar, remaining separate within your scar. The ring was a special case as it merged with the piece that was already there since both were badly weakened from either protecting you or attempting to kill the old fool. The Diary piece moved back to me and merged with me in the forest clearing as an attempt to both inform me and protect you. Due to the fact that the Diary was a full half it also returned most of my sanity. Where as the return of a large portion of my magic from the merge cleared out a good number of long term spells and potions someone had slipped me," Voldemort informed them. "One of the Horcruxes chose to use your voice and magic to cast a binding spell on Severus so that a bond formed between the two of you, claiming him as your own. He was kept alive through the magic of the bond which in turn transitioned the bond so that it can not be simply broken."</p><p>"~I had no choice,~" Severus admitted miserably. "~He used an unbreakable vow that I am under to force my compliance in this. Even after his death the threat remained, ready to be carried out by one of the others or a specially tasked house elf.~"</p><p>"Shit," Harry summarized succinctly.</p><p>"Indeed," Voldemort agreed with dark amusement. "Can you speak further of the vow?"</p><p>"~No, there is something of a secrecy clause but it would not have allowed the bond with Potter if the two were in conflict,~" Severus pointed out unhappily.</p><p>"That could change. I did find the marks of at least one active Unbreakable Vow along with several discharged vows in my examination. I also saw how it interacted with your mark of service to me and the bond you now have with Potter. I am not happy about the way the strands of power fall but it is not as dangerous as it could have been now that I am aware of Potter's status," Voldemort said unhappily. Nagini hissed her agreement.</p><p>"~I am of the Dark but functionally my loyalty must be to Potter,~" Severus grudgingly admitted.</p><p>"Yes, such a bond does tend to do that, change one's practical loyalty," Voldemort agreed in clear aggravation. He did note that he likely had his answers about Severus' actual loyalty now but the answer came up as less important than it might have been before. Considering how insane he now knew he had been he didn't blame the man, especially since his actions were <i>more</i> loyal for all the initial traitorous appearance. The two Slytherins came to a silent understanding in that moment and just as silently moved on.</p><p>"Can we remove some of the risks? Can we get rid of some of the magics that could hurt him?" Harry asked in concern.</p><p>"I am unwilling to remove the Dark Mark on Severus at this time but I can and do recognize that a part of me has reassigned him to serve and protect you, that I have basically gifted him to you. He was already in my Inner Circle so I can just assign him anything to do with you. I was going to have to do something like that anyway since I <i>know</i> that you won't be willing to stay locked up in a tower or something and if I try it will likely backfire. As I have no wish to continue experiencing your blasted luck being used against me you get bodyguards. I will however concede that Severus is more your man than mine at the moment," Voldemort said consideringly.</p><p>"I'm not even gonna ask," Harry muttered, earning amusement in various forms from the others.</p><p>"You will have to learn how to get along with us but for now you both need rest. Sleep," Voldemort told them, backing it up with a mild sleep spell. They were asleep again before Nagini quit cackling.</p><p>Harry woke gasping with his own screams ringing in his ears.</p><p>"~What the devil was that?!~" Severus hissed the demand from his own bed.</p><p>"I would like to know the same and who exactly is this <i>Vernon</i>?" Voldemort asked icily as he re-entered the room with a worried Nagini on his heels.</p><p>"Sorry," Harry mumbled in a shame that was tinged with fading terror and pain. His gaze had immediately fallen to watch his hands twisting the blankets that barely covered him so he missed the looks go from shocked and icy to outright concern.</p><p>"~Explain!~" Severus hissed demandingly. He had decided he didn't want to try to out wait the younger man and that he would likely get more answers by demanding them before Harry had a chance to regain himself. Neither man though had expected the violent flinch that nearly sent Harry tumbling out of his bed before he caught himself on the edge of the mattress.</p><p>While the near tumble was a cause of concern what worried Nagini the most was the complete lack of sound aside from the barely audible apology. In her mind living things made sound, no matter how minimal, and lack of sound from normally noisy humans was a very bad, almost dangerous, sign.</p><p>Her rapid movement and striking launch landed her on the bed in easy reach of Harry. His moment of frozen surprise allowed her to wrap him in her coils, dragging him from the edge of the bed to be firmly placed in the center of both bed and coils.</p><p>"~You will tell us what frightened you so. You will cease attempting to hurt yourself. You will cease hiding things from us. My Tom can fix many things and is strong enough to hold enough territory for all four of us. You are of us, a part of our nest, and the new speaker is ours as well. A threat to you is a threat to the nest and threats to the nest find only poison and fang for their temerity!~" Nagini declared, bearing her fangs to show how she would deal with threats.</p><p>"That's new," Voldemort commented in quiet yet avid interest. Harry just stared at the oversized serpent in a mix of wariness and shock, waiting to feel fangs sink into his flesh.</p><p>Severus broke the surreal tableau with a snort of derisive amusement. Green eyes and tired body wilted in his gentle cage of coiled scales once again worrying the other two wizards before answering.</p><p>"It was just a nightmare. I usually put up silencing charms but..." Harry shrugged, trailing off rather than pointing out that his wand had been taken off of him in the forest. He figured that Voldemort had it and that he was never getting it back.</p><p>"Night terror more likely. I could somewhat understand if your shouts had been my name or some of my Death Eaters but this Vernon person? You haven't even told us who he is yet," Voldemort pointed out. He was obviously put out for not being the most terrifying thing that Harry's mind could come up with.</p><p>"It doesn't matter. Sorry I woke you. Just toss a silencing charm at my bed and we can all go back to sleep," Harry said shortly. For his pains in attempting to let everyone sleep quickly he was bodily pinned in place by Nagini with a whuff of air leaving his lungs.</p><p>"~Where is the threat and what did I tell you about hiding things from us?~" Nagini hissed in clear irritation as Harry fought to get his breath back while pinned under her heavy coils.</p><p>"Uncle Vernon is no longer anyone important," Harry said very carefully after regaining his breath. Nagini hissed in displeasure but didn't do anything to drag more information out of him... yet.</p><p>"Why on earth were you that terrified of the man?" Voldemort asked with suspicious narrowed ruby eyes. Then he paused, reviewed his statement before mentally diving in to the copies of Harry's memories that the Diary had retrieved from Harry and his scar. Twenty minutes later he resurfaced in the outside world, shaking in fury.</p><p>"~What is it?~" Severus hissed in wary concern.</p><p>"Tell him," Voldemort ordered sharply. Harry mutely refused.</p><p>"~Tom? What is it?~" Nagini asked in concern.</p><p>"When a piece of myself returned in the forest... it brought copies of his memories for me to look through at a later time. They begin the night he became of us, became mine. You will tell them or I will and I refuse to vouch for their safety in either case," Voldemort hissed in his fury.</p><p>"What about Dudley? Or my friends?" Harry asked desperately.</p><p>"Only if you tell them yourself, truthfully, and the female Weasely is not marrying you or in any way dating you. She has already failed my requirements for even trying. I will permit you to keep the twins, Longbottom, and Lovegood but Granger and Ronald still have tests to pass and things to make up for," Voldemort shot back.</p><p>"You won't hurt them?" Harry demanded warily.</p><p>"I will forgive any past transgressions, a clean slate if you will, for those who hadn't graduated before your fourth year. If they pass my requirements Granger and Ronald will be allowed to see you. They still have many things to make up for before I will trust them with you. The other Weasley family members will be required to take a vow as will your little club in lieu of other more restrictive punishments. Most of the Phoenix Order member's lives are forfeit but you earned them a swift death rather than extended torture or being fed to the Dementors. I will however grant part of the punishment of the Carrows to your club members and classmates," Voldemort responded. "<i>Provided</i>..."</p><p>"...I explain to Snape and Nagini," Harry finished softly.</p><p>Harry fought with himself before, with a bone weary sigh, he started to talk. He forced himself to explain first his bedroom at various points in his life. Next was his insane chore list in exacting detail. Then his desperate need to accept the home that Sirius had offered him at the end of third year. He even explained his begging of Dumbledore not to send him back each year until he finally gave up. Ultimately he spoke of Vernon and the Dursleys themselves, the Harry Hunting, the neglect, the beatings. By the time he was done forcing the explanations past numb lips it was nearing mid-afternoon. It only took him another twenty minutes to fall into an emotionally exhausted sleep.</p><p>"~If that old goat wasn't already dead I would make sure he had an agonizing death for this!~" Severus hissed furiously. "~I will need to track down <i>'Tuny</i> and her oh so <i>loving</i> family to give them my regards.~"</p><p>"He didn't tell you everything but rest assured that their... infractions will not remain unpunished. The only reason for any leniency is Dumbledore's obvious meddling in the situation. I will have to determine how much was his influence and how much was simply spite. The cousin... made peace with our brat and payed almost enough with his near Kiss from the Dementors just prior to Harry's fifth year. For that he will get a warning and a few years under surveillance. His parents on the other hand..." Voldemort mused with vicious malevolence.</p><p>"~I want to scare them before I eat them,~" Nagini hissed nastily, coiled protectively around Harry's sleeping form.</p><p>"We shall see, the remains may not be edible when we are done punishing them," Voldemort pointed out smugly. The two wizards eventually settled down into a serious plotting session while Harry slept.</p><p>The preparations for the trip to Gringotts passed without incident as the two captured wizards rested and healed, protected and contained in Voldemort's quarters. Nagini guarded them faithfully which was made easier as the two men didn't bother trying to escape. As such the only time she had to act was when one of the lower level idiots found his way into the room and tried to kill the two still healing men shortly before they left for Diagon Alley.</p><p>"~Stupid one,~" Nagini spat disdainfully.</p><p>"Nagini?" Harry asked tiredly.</p><p>"~All but the two of you and my Tom are forbidden from our nest. I let the squeaky creatures clean because Tom asked but I watch them carefully. This stupid one will be killed for trespassing in our nest or punished for his stupidity in entering,~" Nagini explained with a growly hiss. She stayed protectively between her two charges and the intruder collapsed near the door until Voldemort arrived to fetch them.</p><p>The corpse was vanished with barely a wave of the yew wand and hardly a glance when Voldemort arrived. Neither wizard said anything as they made their way to Diagon in silence.</p><p>The wary crowd that formed around them as they openly moved down the street was only noticed by Harry when he was suddenly yanked forwards by Voldemort's unexpected grip on his arm. A moment later they were stopped by a wall of people and he was firmly tucked protectively into the man's side. Harry watched the restless crowd get glared at by the Dark Lord through his bangs. He remained silent, honestly not knowing what to do or say at this point.</p><p>"Yes?" Voldemort drawled after the silence between both groups had stretched a sufficiently long time.</p><p>"Is that Potter?"</p><p>"What are you going to do with him?"</p><p>"Why is the Headmaster injured? Why isn't he at Hogwarts?"</p><p>The questions went on and on and on until a mass wave of a silencing spell ended the noise long enough for a response.</p><p>"The Headmaster is here because I wish it. Yes, this is Potter and you may all thank him for he bought your fresh slate. He also bought you all an end to the raids and unnecessary bloodshed by becoming my ward and submitting to living through a very personal set of nightmares. Several aggravating people who fought against me were set for execution but I allowed him to save some of them with certain restrictions. Don't bother trying to use him or those who will be bound to him against me it won't do you any good. The new laws and penalties will be clearly posted in due time. Until they are posted presume that the laws under the previous administration are still in effect and report even my Death Eaters for breaking them. Their sentences or fines may be suspended or dismissed until we have sorted out the mess that the laws are in but they are no more exempt from those final laws than any of the rest of you. Yet another thing Potter bought on behalf of all of you. It makes me wonder exactly how many life debts you all owe him by now," Voldemort informed the crowd mockingly.</p><p>The Dark Lord's announcement made, they rapidly moved forwards through the parting, forcibly silent crowd into the bank. A flaming red yet silent Harry was dragged along behind him. They were closely followed by a scowling yet subdued Snape whose white bandaged neck stood out starkly against his black hair and clothes. The spell released just as the bank's doors swung closed on the outside world behind them.</p><p>The goblins gave Harry suspicious and pointed looks but refrained from acting as he was quite obviously a prisoner of the Dark Lord. Without a word spoken the small group of wizards plus snake were lead to a conference room and served refreshments as the Dark Lord's account manager was fetched.</p><p>"~Would you quit pretending to cower! It is extremely irritating!~" Severus finally snapped in Parseltongue at the overly quiet teen.</p><p>"~I'm not cowering! I just... don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm <i>allowed</i> to do either. I... didn't think that I would survive. Yon Darkness has also made it abundantly clear that our deal requires me to not try and die so that he will die, which might not work any way. I mean I got treated better as a prisoner of war than by my own blood. Yes, there were other times he captured me and hurt me but he only ever tried to really hurt me that one time I pushed too far in the graveyard. All the other times would have been a quick clean kill... mostly. I just... got in the way a lot,~" Harry hissed back, obviously uncomfortable.</p><p>"~That you did,~" Voldemort chuckled evilly. "~It was something that was likely influenced by the magics binding us together and Dumbledore's meddling. I, however, greatly doubt that the old coot or anyone else could have anticipated some of what has happened. You do realize I will never allow you to escape me? That if you get free of me I will simply come after you again and again until I have you?~"</p><p>"~Yes, I understand,~" Harry hissed resignedly.</p><p>"How may Gringotts help you today?" Voldemort's account manager asked as he entered the room.</p><p>"We need to sort out a change in status for Potter and for Severus as well as discuss reparations for recent... damages," Voldemort explained. "I realize that legally my marked followers could count as slaves and..."</p><p>He proceeded to outline the situation that they now found themselves in as well as pertinent connecting issues such as Harry's remembered deal in regards to the Sword of Gryffindor, his Horcruxes, Snape's new bond situation, and Harry's unique situation which included the prophecy status.</p><p>"This is going to take some time to put to rights. We of Gringotts thank you for bringing the situation to our attention as well as clarifying the deaths of our people under your wand. This will allow them to be laid to rest as warriors. The prophecy aspect is a pain but it absolves both of you of recent offenses in the eyes of the goblin people provided you pay a fine of gold for the family of each slain goblin. No charges will be pressed in regards to the goblin blade as Mr. Potter upheld his end of the bargain and left it in goblin hands. There must have been some extra enchantment involved and as such please bring it in for examination should it resurface so that we may clarify the situation further. As the primary subjects of the prophecy, which has been very clearly meddled with, you have the right to claim certain rights and bequests under goblin law," the manager explained reasonably before switching to a much more disapproving tone. "We would really have preferred to have been informed about at least the prophecy as soon as reasonably possible and there was no need to <i>break in</i>."</p><p>"Considering the amount of damage I was doing in my unwell state the brat was right to break into your bank and go after one of my anchors. That said it wasn't entirely his fault as he was acting under Dumbledore's orders and had been trained to believe the old fool beyond anything else. I was only able to bring him to heel because he had been ordered to die by my wand and one of my own fail safes kicked in with an... unexpected reaction that I was required to investigate before continuing," Voldemort informed the goblins dryly. "I will of course arrange to pay for the damage my new charge has done to your bank and you may once more be assured that my... illness has been stabilized so that I will no longer react inappropriately."</p><p>"Insane more like," Harry muttered ruefully. He had learned exactly how brilliant the man actually was, having discovered over the course of his recent imprisonment via their daily discussions. He also now knew that had the man not created the horcruxes in the first place no one would have been able to stand against him.</p><p>"Brat," Severus muttered back in exasperation, their by play was ignored by the rest of the room. During the earlier discussion a goblin healer had arrived and forced him to drink what the goblins called a battle commander's voice draft. It had healed his vocal cords enough to once more be able to speak English.</p><p>"Why were we not simply asked? As Lord Black had he simply accepted his Lordships he would have had access to her personal vault as she was still considered a member of his house having never been disowned," the goblin pointed out.</p><p>"What Lordships? All I have is the one vault and I was going to have to make it really stretch until I could get a job... well before I was captured any way," Harry asked in outright puzzlement. This question momentarily froze the rest of the room in shock.</p><p>"You were not informed by your magical guardian?" the goblin asked slowly.</p><p>"What is a magical guardian?" Harry asked carefully. The immediate wall of scowls was <i>not</i> a good response. He quickly elaborated on his question. "I don't want to assume the meaning because logic doesn't really seem to apply to the Wizarding world. Besides, if it means anything even close to what I think it does then I still don't know what you are talking about."</p><p>"Did you ever even receive my attempts to talk or parlay?" Voldemort demanded in clear aggravation. Harry's blank look was answer enough for the rest of the room. "Master Goblin I believe I will be paying for a full health exam of my charge and testing on his knowledge in both worlds. I will also clearly have to rectify much of his knowledge. If the other students are anything like this the entire curriculum is going to need a massive overhaul. I will also have to set up a school for the muggleborns."</p><p>"You better get rid of forcing older students to use the Cruciartus on firsties too," Harry pointed out.</p><p>"When did that become standard punishment? Yes, the students need to know how to cast the spell and how to resist it as necessary but that is at least sixth year material if not seventh year. First years shouldn't be worrying about it getting cast on them for any reason," Voldemort scowled in obvious upset.</p><p>"It was a practice partly instituted by the Carrows. I altered it to reduce how often the students would actually be under the curse yet still look like it was a worse punishment. Potter's little Defense club made protecting the students both easier and harder, Longbottom especially. Harder to protect the members themselves with their defiance, easier to help them get the rest of the school mostly out of harms way and assist in hiding students from the Carrows," Severus admitted. He had really hated letting so many dangerous punishments stand but it was all he could do to keep the brats alive.</p><p>"As soon as we get to the school those punishments are going back to normal. Honestly, if its too dangerous to Legillimize a child under a certain age then one would think it obvious that a Crucio has a similar limitation! The reason I use it is because you are all adults, it drives the message home, and you all willingly gave me loyalty oaths!" Voldemort growled.</p><p>"In-<i>sane</i>," Harry sing-songed under his breath before snickering.</p><p>"Quiet you," Voldemort ordered, giving the brat a light smack that didn't really hurt. Nearly everyone noticed but didn't comment on the fact that he didn't argue against the accused insanity, instead he had just told Harry to be quiet.</p><p>"Just admit that you were insane and now you don't really want to have to find a different way to punish them," Harry jeered.</p><p>"Why did you think I want your twins alive? Why did you think I promised we could visit your little joint joke shop? From the trauma your father and Black put Severus through the results will be quite effective," Voldemort shot back evilly.</p><p>"You are setting the Weasley twins loose on them?" Harry asked in surprise.</p><p>"No, you are. I will be assigning the Lestrange brothers to learn from them and incorporate the punishments accordingly, matching them to the violator as needed," Voldemort shot back smugly. "Severus will spend at least once a week refining their technique and assisting them in brewing any necessary potions so that he can brew antidotes at need. His punishments, which teaching them is part of, are different then their future prank victims."</p><p>Severus wasted no time in starting to mutter dire threats and choice words under his breath. Harry was torn between admiring the creative new punishment regime or laughing his arse off over the chaos that would result when it  was actually instituted. Things were clearly never going to be the same again.</p>
