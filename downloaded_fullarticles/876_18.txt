          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in a pub in North America. Neville and Luna Longbottom are discussing their recent success in locating Snallygasters over butterbeers.</p><p>Neville said, "You were amazing out there."</p><p>Luna replied, "Not really, I just used my knowledge of them to help us befriend them."</p><p>Neville smirked. "You used Dirigible Plums to lure them near us, that's pretty amazing to me."</p><p>Luna added, "You were the one who took the photographs."</p><p>Neville smiled. "Let's agree that it was a team effort."</p><p>Luna nodded and grinned. "I don't think we've had this much fun since before the boys were born."</p><p>Neville told her, "I could hunt for magical creatures with you all day."</p><p>Luna corrected him, "Conserving not hunting, Nev."</p><p>Neville beamed, "I know, but you know what I mean."</p><p>Luna responded, "I could do it all day too. With or without the twins."</p><p>Neville glanced at the clock and muttered, "They're late."</p><p>Luna frowned. "I hope they didn't run into any Snallygasters on the way, those fangs are lethal."</p><p>The door to the bar opened and Lorcan and Lysander entered. They were grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>Lorcan asked, "Alright, mum and dad?"</p><p>Neville answered, "We're great, you?"</p><p>Lysander exclaimed, "Just wait till you hear what we got up to!"</p></div>
