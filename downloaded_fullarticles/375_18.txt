    <p>On the night of June 5th there was a thunderstorm, Narcissa and Lucius were sitting by the fire in the parlour. Lucius had not hit her since the start of the pregnancy favouring instead to make her look at him through a rough hand on the jaw and reminding her that he could end the child life in a second. He wouldn't of course he needed the heir, he needed a boy. </p><p>Narcissa sat with a book in one hand while the other lay at the swell of her stomach. She didn't care what gender her baby was she just hoped that it wouldn't have to suffer the same fate as her but alas that was a daydream. Maybe they could escape one day but she often shook that thought off quickly not wanting to have hope that Lucius could destroy. </p><p>At least she had a friend, Lucius would always call severus to clean up his mess. Severus was kind to her, he would lift her gently in his arms and place her in her soft bed before beginning the healing process. People always though it was Lucius that Severus was close with but it was not. However Narcissa did not like to trouble him so if she could she did most healing herself. Severus tried to convince her to let him deliver the baby but she refused wanting Severus to be away if Lucius were to get mad.</p><p>It was then that she heard a pop and felt fluid rush out of her and splash on the floor. She was going into labour. </p><p>"Lucius," her shakey whisper came as her hands clung into the arms of the chair she was say in. Lucius looked up to see his wife in distress and a large pool at her feet, he first felt the anger rise in him that the chair his wife was sat in was in ruin but it stopped once he realised what that meant. </p><p>He snapped his fingers calling a house elf to his side. A small frail creature with big eyes and ears appeared at his side.</p><p>"Linny take my wife to her bedroom for her to give birth while i call the healer," his voice was calm but had an edge of panic to it. The house elf nodded taking Narcissa by the hand helping her up. They could not Apparate as it could harm the baby. So they made their way slowly to Narcissa's room. </p><p>Narcissa smiled at the small elf. "thank you," her voice was shakey, she could feel the incoming of a contraction. Linny was her favourite elf, she tried to be kind to all the elves as long as her husband was not around. Linny looked up at her, a worried look in her eye</p><p>"Will you be alright Mrs Malfoy?"</p><p>"yes of course I will, and remember dear you can call me Narcissa." </p><p>The house elf eyes still held a worried look but smiled and nodded.</p><p>Linny helped Narcissa to lay down on the bed before clasping her hand between both of hers,</p><p>"Linny is just going to collect the towels now Mrs Narcissa." </p><p>Narcissa nodded as she winced at the contraction and felt the two hands slip away from her own.</p><p>Only a minute later did the healer and Lucius appeared. The healer was instantly beside Narcissa and getting to work. Lucius walked up to the chair beside the bed clasping Narcissa's hand between his own, playing his part as the husband he didn't even wince when Narcissa squeezed down on his hand. Narcissa squeezed her eyes shut and grit her teeth together at another contraction, she could push soon she thought to herself.</p><p>Finally the nurse said the word "push!" </p><p><br/>Narcissa pushed while breathing steadily in and out. Sweat dripped down her brow and her legs shook with effort. But then it was all over and she heard it the cry of her new born baby and the shout from the nurse, "It's a beautiful baby girl!"</p><p>Narcissa held her baby covered in soft pink blankets in her arms, smiling and cooing at her little girl. She truly was beautiful. Narcissa was happy but still felt dread in the bottom of her stomach, she could feel Lucius beside her and although he looked happy she could feel the rage radiating off of him.</p><p>Lucius bid the healer goodbye leading her to the exit before he came back the anger now evident on his face. </p><p>"You give me a girl women!" His voice bellowed and cause their daughter to wake up and let out a shrill cry. </p><p>"I'm sorry," Narcissa begged from the bed "we can try again!" </p><p>"No," came Lucius shout "I did not want you or this child in the first place it was a necessity!"  </p><p>Lucius walked up to where Narcissa lay, a storm on his face.</p><p>"And now i have to fix your mess!"</p><p>Lucius grabbed the child that was still crying and tore her away from Narcissa. </p><p>"No!" Narcissa cried tear running down her face pallid from exhaustion.</p><p>She broke down in her bed while Lucius walked away with her child, she could only hope that he would not hurt her.</p><p>Narcissa did not sleep that night.</p><p>The next morning Narcissa held her child now covered in blue blankets.</p><p>"You will follw the rules I set," Lucius said "and if you go out of line you will be punished."</p><p>Narcissa nodded looking down at her child a smile on her face but a sad look in her eyes, <br/>"And the healer?" She asked.</p><p>"Sworn to secrecy," Lucius replied.</p><p>"What will he be called?" She asked tears in her eyes.</p><p>"Draco Lucius Malfoy."</p><p> </p>
