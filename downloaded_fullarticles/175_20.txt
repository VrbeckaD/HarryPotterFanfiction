    <p>Templar Knight Cullen Stanton Rutherford marched alongside his superior as they made their way to the village of Lothering. It was a quaint little town, being generous, and only a week or so away from his own home village of Honnleath. He'd been there many times when his father insisted on seeking out new 'business ventures', whatever that meant, and he found it fine but... somehow lacking. Perhaps it was the lack of a very disturbing statue that had somehow integrated itself into the usual bluster his home possessed, or maybe it was because whenever he did travel, it had been alone with his father, his siblings an absent ache in his heart.</p><p>Knight-lieutenant Gryllis called a halt when they reached the village at last, and spoke to the Templar agent present near the edges, close to the Imperial Highway. Not for the first time, he wondered if this, his first apostate hunt, was going to go smoothly. The other older recruits at the tower had rendered him cautious about such trips - mainly through horror stories about how their first hunts ended in a far from peaceful fashion. </p><p>He didn't blame the mages. He'd seen how some of them were treated at the tower. In his experience, Templars came in three flavors: nice, stoic, or cruel.</p><p>The nice ones, like his friend Rory Carmichael or even Knight-lieutenant Gryllis himself, were the sort to treat mages no different than normal people. They shared meals with mages, spoke to mages sometimes, and sneaked treats from outside into the tower, like delicious dumplings available only in Denerim. Granted, they were a but off by the time they got to their intended, but something was better than nothing at all. </p><p>The stoic ones were usually ones to ignore mages entirely. Oh, they did their duties, of course, and did so diligently. They monitored mages to ensure none were corrupted, and they guarded the Tower well - both from the inside and outside. However, they tended to not make conversation when spoken to by a mage, only giving crisp and curt answers if absolutely necessary. They only socialized amongst the Templars, and chastised the nice ones for getting too friendly with their charges. Before he reached the tower, Cullen wanted to be one of them.</p><p>But the cruel ones changed his mind. Knight-commander Gregoir was a good man, even though he was the stoic sort, but still he was only one man. In the tower, guarding at least two hundred mages across five floors, the mages were outnumbered two-to-one. This allowed for several... unsavory incidents to occur before they could be stopped, but by then the damage was done.</p><p>Keegan, another new friend he made at the tower and one of the nice sort, told him that while some mages were evil, most turned to the forbidden when threatened. After all, who would not grasp at any available choice to survive, to remain unharmed? Mages were delicate - they were not trained as warriors to keep them docile; they were intellectuals, besides the few dim-witted ones at the tower, and their only weapon could be easily negated by the skills a Templar learned. </p><p>Maker, just the other day-</p><p>"Rutherford!"</p><p>Cullen snapped out of his thoughts and gave his frowning superior a sheepish look. "Sorry, Knight-lieutenant, I was distracted."</p><p>"Focus is a Templar's main weapon beyond the sword and shield, Rutherford." Gryllis scolded. "A distracted mind is easy to prey upon."</p><p>Cullen nodded contritely.</p><p>"Newbies." Gryllis muttered, before turning back to the agent. "Where is he?"</p><p>"The revered mother, bless her soul, wouldn't stand for the boy to be put in the cage outside of town while he was unconscious." The agent reported. "He's been in the Chantry ever since he was found."</p><p>"Very well. Peace, brother." Gryllis said in way if farewell, and proceeded onward with a gesture to Cullen. Said greenhorn nodded hastily to an amused agent and followed his superior into town.</p><p>"Since I am certain you weren't listening, I will repeat myself, but only this once." The man spoke curtly, clearly annoyed by Cullen's conduct. "There was a boy found in the forest a couple of weeks ago by hunters, asleep. They brought him to the Chantry to heal him, but the healer cannot seem to rouse him. We've been summoned, fearing that he's under the influence of foul magic."</p><p>Cullen nodded. Templars weren't only dispatched to retrieve mages outside the tower, after all. Matters suspected to be related to magic were often brought before their attention, as well. "What will we do, Knight-lieutenant?"</p><p>"We'll study the boy and cleanse any magic from his system." He said plainly. "However, I have never seen a mage powerful enough to cast a spell of Sleep over someone for half-way long. I suspect there is more at play here."</p><p>They entered the Chantry amidst much whispering and glances, both guarded and worried. Cullen wasn't surprised. Templars were respected, yes, but their presence belied the presence of magic in the vicinity, and mages outside the tower do very little to uphold a positive image of their kind. </p><p>"Greetings, revered Mother." Gryllis bowed his head in respect. "Knight-commander Gregoir dispatched me as soon as he received the missive."</p><p>The revered mother of the Lothering chantry, a kindly-looking woman with greying hair and a smattering if wrinkles, smiled when she saw them. Cullen absent wondered why most Chantry mothers reminded him of his grand-mother. "Ah, Knight-lieutenant Gryllis. It has been years. Will you be visiting your family before you leave?"</p><p>"Attachment distracts one from his duty." Gryllis parrotted, although there was an undertone of bitterness in his voice. "I apologize, revered Mother, but I would rather see my duty done and be away as soon as possible."</p><p>The mother frowned, then gestured towards what had to be the staff chambers. "As you wish. Although, your mother has recently taken ill, my dear, surely..."</p><p>"We will observe the boy and see if his ailment is magical in nature." Gryllis spoke, completely ignoring the mother's words. How odd - it was not commonplace for him to be so rude. Perhaps there was a bit of bad blood between his family and himself. If so, it would not be right for Cullen to speak in between. </p><p>The chambers was not empty. Only one bed was occupied, given the daylight hours, but there was also a Chantry sister by the bedside, cheerfully reading from a book. </p><p>"... but alas, it was not to be, for the maid was caught and beheaded by the king for bedding his son, in fear of someone so mediocre carrying his royal lineage onwards. Distraught by the news if the death of his love, the prince too gave himself to death, by dousing himself in oil and setting himself alight. That night, the king, too, lamented his actions, but the Maker forgave him not, for it was his doing."</p><p>Ah, 'A Collection of Tragic Love Tales', by Esmerelda Sighard. It was bound to be morbid, being in poor taste. The sister clearly needed better reading material.</p><p>"Sister Leliana." The mother seemed disapproving of her actions. "The boy cannot hear you while he sleeps. Reading to him is a kindness, true, but perhaps it is better afforded while we do not have a midday sermon to prepare for?"</p><p>"Revered Mother! I beg your pardon." The sister quickly stood, snapping her book shut. "Its just... he was frowning again, and Julia said he looked terrible that way, so..."</p><p>The mother sighed. "Very well. But now that you are done with what I am fairly certain is not the first chapter from that book for today, perhaps you should return to helping in the needful...?"</p><p>"Of course, mother, right away." She bowed to her, and then bowed to us as well - that's something Cullen hadn't seen before from someone who wasn't a mage, and walked away.</p><p>"She's a bit odd, that one. Sweet, but odd." The mother smiled fondly, but that turned upside down when she gazed upon the boy in the bed. "This is the boy we found in the bears' den to the North. Oddly enough, they seemed protective of him, or so the hunters tell me. He's been making expressions in his sleep, which led me to believe his ailment was of an arcane nature, further affirmed when every antidote the village healer could brew was dripped to him, but he remained as such."</p><p>Cullen took a moment to look at the boy in question. He looked well-past his child years, perhaps seventeen or eighteen summers. His hair was black, and stuck out every which way. He was pale, as if he had not seen any sunlight in a long time, as a lot of mages in the tower were. But...</p><p>Gryllis moved closer, brushing away the boy's hair to reveal a faded scar. It was only a white jagged line now, much resembling a lightning-bolt.  But for it be as light as it was, even with poultices, it must have been an old one. </p><p>Besides that too was... something. Templars couldn't sense Mages, the idea was ludicrous. There wouldn't be apostates anywhere if that were the case. However, they could sense magic itself, and...</p><p>"The boy is drenched with magic." Gryllis confirmed his thoughts. "Rutherford, what can you tell me from what you feel?"</p><p>Cullen closed his eyes and focused, trying to reach out and feel with his mind the way he was instructed. The Fade was positively writhing around the boy, as if...</p><p>"There is foul magic cast on him. It feels... wrong. Unusual." Cullen spoke, frowning in concentration. "And... beyond that... Holy Maker."</p><p>"Have there been any incidents around him? Maybe a series of unexplained accidents, or prevalence of negative thoughts?"</p><p>"None, Knight-lieutenant." The mother shook her head. "Poor dear has been as still as a tree, and as dormant as one. Besides the antidotes and water which has been dripped down his throat, he has only had milk. Perhaps his weakness allows the magic to linger longer?"</p><p>"Possibly." Gryllis scowled, his scarred visage twisting with the expression. "Blasted blood mages... pardon my language, mother."</p><p>"So it is indeed magic." The mother shook her head. "Why must the Maker's children turn on each other the gifts granted unto them, corrupted?"</p><p>"We should take him back to the tower. The First Enchanter ought to know how to break the spell." Gryllis thought, a metal-encased hand coming up to rub at his chin. "Yes... I believe that would be best. Blood magic corrupts whatever it touches - I wouldn't want the boy to walk away with even a hint of that stuff on him."</p><p>"Just... if he needs a home afterward, kindly point him in our direction." The mother smiled a soft smile, turning to gaze upon him with a matronly visage. "He has... an air about him, one of sadness and despair."</p><p>"That might be the blood magic." Gryllis cautioned. "Perhaps, see if you feel the same way if he returns before you decide to keep him on. Blood mages only deal with those of their kind, or some other unsavory characters."</p><p>"Do not discount the fact that he might be a victim himself, Knight-lieutenant." The mother frowned. "However... I see your meaning. Very well, shall I have a stretcher made ready?"</p><p>Gryllis pulled the blanket off him, observing his form, clothed in only smallclothes. There were no blemishes, only smooth skin, save for two spaces. On his right arm, near his bicep, there was some sort of circular scar, looking much closer to that day in time than the one on his forehead. And on his left hand, which lay on his chest, a sentence was carved in, 'I must not tell lies', but healed. </p><p>"There's no need." Gryllis muttered. "He's skinny enough."</p><p>Oh, that was what had been bothering Cullen. He looked too thin, bones jutting out almost everywhere and straining against skin. He looked worse than most beggars. Perhaps he was a runaway slave of some sort? The practice was punishable by law in Ferelden, but the unsavory types indulged, he knew.</p><p>"Cullen, carry him." Gryllis ordered, then paused. "Perhaps you should get some clothes on him, first. Who knows what the townsfolk would think if they saw you with a naked boy over your shoulder."</p><p>Cullen couldn't prove it, or had seen it, but he could swear the revered mother chortled. </p>
