    <p>The moment he steps out of his car, Percival knows this little vacation was a good idea. The first breath of clean, fresh air clears his mind. </p><p>He sighs deeply and turns to get his case out of the trunk.</p><p>"Percy! It's so good to see you!"</p><p>Newt doesn't look like he's aged a day. He seems to have grown into himself, but to Percival, he'll always be that awkward fifteen year old who spat water into Percival's lap during dinner. </p><p>"Newton, how are you?" He returns, lips twisting into a smirk.</p><p>He laughs when Newt frowns. "Okay, point well made. But seriously, it is good to see you." </p><p>Percival would make a point of hugging him, but for one, his hands are full, and for two, Newt isn't a hugging kind of guy.</p><p>"It's good to see you too, Newt. What have you been up to, then?" </p><p>As Percival lets the chatter wash over him, he feels the tension in his shoulders leave him, and he sighs softly. Newt barrels right on talking and Percival lets him, glad to have something to fill the empty space.</p><p>A few of Newt's Kneasles come running up to him, and he crouches to pet them with a warm chuckle, running his fingertips over their heads just to hear them purr. </p><p>He doesn't even realize Newt has left until he stands up and glances around for him.</p><p>"Just setting up your room." As usual, he has incredible timing for knowing when he needs to be places. "First door on your left, up the stairs. Make yourself at home." </p><p>As Percival walks up the stairs, he swears he's being watched. </p><p>It doesn't take him long at all to unpack, since he only really brought what he felt was strictly necessary. Once he had, though, he glanced out of the window for all of a second. </p><p>And made eye contact with someone down there in Newt's yard. When he looked again, they were gone. </p><p>Percival rubbed his eyes. "Maybe I need this more than I thought." He muttered to himself as he undid his tie.</p><p>--- </p><p>It's on the third day of his three-month long stay with Newt that they meet Him. </p><p>Newt had convinced him to go for a walk with him, get some fresh air. Although he grumbled that he <em>got plenty of fresh air, thank you, Newton, </em>he went anyway.</p><p> It was as they were approaching the river that they see him. Newt quiets his chatter about his creatures for long enough that it draws Percival out of his daydreaming. </p><p>"New--" </p><p>Newt shushes him quickly, and his jaw shuts with a quiet click. "Look, over there." </p><p>Crouching on the opposite bank is the most beautiful man Percival has ever seen. He dips his pale hands into the water and then brings them up to his hands to drink. His hair is dark, falling around his face in curled waves, and when he looks up and casts his gaze around for threats, they're the prettiest brown Percival has ever known. </p><p>"Who is that?" Percival breathes, so as not to disturb the delightful creature in front of him. </p><p>"That's Credence." Newt replies, equally quiet. "He's a Faerie - Changeling, actually, which is why he isn't with the Court." </p><p>That brings Percival flying back down to Earth. A Faerie. An actual Faerie is sat in front of him. Jesus. </p><p>The boy, for he can't be more than twenty, makes eye contact with Percival, and it sends flames rocketing down his spine. And then he bolts, faster than light. For a brief, terrifying moment, Percival's thighs twitch with the urge to give chase. </p><p>"Ah, he's a bit wary of strangers, I'm afraid. I'm sure you'll meet him eventually." Newt says, rising from his crouched position. It takes Percival a long moment to shake off the strange feeling that he's forgotten something very important somewhere. But he does manage to shake it off, and he wipes his forehead with his sleeve. "It does take a while to get used to, doesn't it? Don't worry, Percy, I'm sure you'll be just fine." </p><p>Famous last words, those. </p><p>---</p><p>On the fourth day, Percival decides to go out on his own. Newt and Tina wave him off with a "Be safe." It's a far cry from New York City, where he's lived pretty much his entire adult life, so he thinks he'll be alright. He takes his wand with him anyway. Just in case.</p><p>It's about half an hour in that he gets interrupted. It's a voice so beautiful, so wonderful, that he can't help but stop in his tracks. </p><p>"Hello." Says that voice, and Percival turns around before he's even thinking about it. "I saw you, before." </p><p>It takes him an awfully long time to respond, because standing there is that Faerie Newt had pointed out to him, the one that sends fire through his very bones. "Um. Yes, that's right." </p><p>"What's your name?" Says the Faerie, tilting his head, and Percival could never deny him anything. </p><p>"Percival Graves." </p><p>The Faerie smiles at him, and Percival feels weak at the knees. The smile turns into a grin. It's only then that Percival thinks he might have made a mistake. "Percival Graves? That's a lovely name. You can call me Credence." </p><p>The way he says it makes it sound like a gift, so Percival takes it as one. "Thank you, Credence." </p><p>He - <em>the Faerie</em>, Percival reminds himself - blinks at him curiously, and then offers his hand. "Will you walk with me, Percival Graves?" </p><p>And Percival, damn him, takes the offered hand blindly. </p><p>Famous last words, as they say. </p><p> </p>
