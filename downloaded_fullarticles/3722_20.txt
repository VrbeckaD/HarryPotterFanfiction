    <p>The Trix Icy, Darcy, and Stormy were dropped in The Omega Diemension, a planet made out of ice to serve the time of their crimes against Magix. Not long after they were dropped Icy freed herself and her sisters, they were running from the guardians of the prison, the Frost snakes. While running away from them they stumbled upon a man frozen in ice, the same ice the three sisters were trapped in before Icy broke out of it. In self-preservation, Icy used her ice magic to unfreeze the unknown man. The Trix then ran and hid behind the him, hoping that the serpent guardians would satisfy with him. Icy had planned for the guardians to turn the man into an ice sculpture instead of them. But her improvised plan didn't go as hoped. </p><p>When one of the guardians let out a beam of green energy, the man, who hadn't even opened his eyes yet, raised his hand and let out a beam of black-blue energy from it, destroying the attacking snake and then, without even turning around, raised his hands and pointed his fingers behind them and destroyed the other two snakes with that same black-blue beam. Icy, who had turned around to see the beam destroy the other snakes, turned back to the unknown man and said,</p><p>"Nice work, Goth Guy."</p><p>"Why thank you Madame" he said with slight sarcasm upon his tongue, while bowing slightly to the three witches and continuing to talk, "My name is Valtor, may I ask the name of the beautiful woman who released me from my prison?"</p><p>Icy a little flattered at his words answered, "I am Icy and these are my sisters Darcy and Stormy." Darcy and Stormy were giving the man appraising looks.</p><p>"Well then, I thank you Icy, for my release. Now if you will excuse me I must be off, I have to cash in an old promise. Have a productive day, ladies." But before the man, Valtor, Icy corrected herself, could leave she spoke up.</p><p>"Wait!" Icy said, Valtor turned around and gave Icy a look, her sisters also giving her a look, "Let us come with you, fair trade, we rescued you from your ice statue you get us off this planet? what do you say?"</p><p>Valtor thought about it for a moment before nodding at the three witches, "Fine, but in return you will help me collect what is meant to be mine."  He stated not asked, to which the witches just nodded. </p><p>He waved his hand, and a blue vortex appeared. He motioned for the three witches to pass through before him. When they did, he turned around and took one last look at his long time prison before disappearing into the blue vortex.</p>
