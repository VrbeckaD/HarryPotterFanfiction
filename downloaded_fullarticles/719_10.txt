    <p>Harry: NO!<br/>
A great big walrus of a man storms into the room pure fury in his watery blue eyes.<br/>
Vernon: WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME YOU LITTLE FREAK?!!!!<br/>
Harry: *calm as fuck* 1) I'm not a freak and 2) I said no.<br/>
Vernon: You will do as you are told!!<br/>
Harry: *sassily* Honey, who died and made you my guardian?<br/>
Vernon: What?!<br/>
Harry: To quote my friend Ron '<em>blllloooooodyyyyyy hell</em>'.<br/>
Vernon: Don't you use that language with me!<br/>
Harry: What? English? Okay then. French? Spanish? Italian? Parseltonge?<br/>
Vernon looks like he's about to explode into millions of tiny, livid pieces. Harry laughs.<br/>
Vernon: You will make dinner. We have a guest to entertain.<br/>
Harry: If I have to make dinner then I'm making what I want, when I want, how I want. It is my birthday after all.<br/>
Vernon: You were never like this before!<br/>
Harry: I know. Shame that.<br/>
Vernon: What made you change?!<br/>
Harry: My dad, my boyfriend, my boyfriend's dad, my potions professor and my transfigeration professor.<br/>
Vernon: BOYFRIEND?!!!!<br/>
Harry: Yeah. He asked me out in September. We came out to our parents over Christmas. We knew there wouldn't be any problems. Draco's father married his childhood sweetheart after Draco's mother ran off with the game keeper and they are gayer than me and that's saying something.<br/>
Vernon: You don't have parents!<br/>
Harry: Wanna bet.</p>
