    <p>“Ron, you spoiled everything!” Hermione shouted as she watched Ron and Harry retreat up the stairs, Harry looking concerned and a bit frightened.</p><p>As soon as they rounded the corner, her legs gave out, and she sat on the steps. Her eyes stung as tears she knew weren’t worth crying spilled out anyway. She threw off one of her shoes and massaged the aching heel of her foot with a sob.</p><p><i>Stupid,</i> she thought to herself as she tried to rub the pain away. She was so bloody stupid for thinking she could have one night where she felt special instead of endangered, stressed, or just plain inadequate. Even if she did her hair up, wore some silly little dress, and danced with a handsome guy, the world could never just let her have one night. Wiping her eyes with the back of her hand, she choked back another sob and told herself that she should have known better. She should have lowered her expectations.</p><p>Maybe she shouldn’t have even come at all.</p><p>“Wotcher, ‘Mione! Did you dance too much, or---”</p><p>Hermione glared up at the voice, trying to cover the pain in her eyes with pure anger. She must have failed, or maybe it was already too late. The Weasley twin standing just outside the entrance to the Great Hall stopped short in the middle of his sentence, his mouth agape. The mischief in his eyes faded into concern, and he approached her slowly.</p><p>“Are you… are you crying?” he asked when he was standing in front of her. Now that he was closer, she could see the faint scar above his eyebrow that showed her that he was Fred.</p><p>Covering her face, she turned her head to the side. “I’m fine. Go back to dancing.”</p><p>He stooped down to her level, reaching into his dress robes as he muttered, “You’re very clearly not fine. Was it Krum? Because I swear, if I get my hands on that Bulgarian bon-bon---”</p><p>“Can you Weasleys all just <i>shut up</i> about Viktor!” she burst out, feeling heat flood her cheeks again, the same way it had when she was yelling at Ron.  Fred flinched at her raised volume, and her anger left as soon as it came. She rubbed her face with a groan. “I’m sorry, Fred. I really am. You want to help, and I’m messing up with yet another person tonight.”</p><p>“It’s okay. You’re upset. I get it.” Frowning, he took out the handkerchief he must have been looking for in his robes and held it out to her.</p><p>She looked at it skeptically. “I’m not going to end up pulling a dozen other handkerchiefs tied to this one, am I?”</p><p>A spark of amusement lit up in his eyes, and he tilted his head as a slight smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. “What?”</p><p>Hermione found herself smiling a bit at his cluelessness. She shook her head and took the handkerchief, explaining, “Never mind, I guess it’s just a Muggle joke.”</p><p>Fred chuckled softly, shaking his head as if to say, <i>No wonder Dad’s so interested in Muggles - they’re absolutely bizarre.</i> The handkerchief he’d given her was soft against her skin, and it helped soothe her agitation.</p><p>Once she’d dried her eyes and her slight smile started fading, he asked, “So, what did Ron do?”</p><p>“I didn’t say anything about Ron,” she replied a bit too fast for her comfort, avoiding Fred’s gaze.</p><p>He moved to sit beside her with a laugh that felt devoid of real humor. “Ah, but you did say something about <i>you Weasleys,</i> and I know you’re not talking about Georgie or Ginny. You’re definitely not talking about any of my older brothers. Therefore, what did <i>Ron</i> do?” When she didn’t respond, he bumped her shoulder with his. “Did he say something about Krum?”</p><p>Shaking her head, she shoved his handkerchief back into his hands and put her shoe back on so she could stand up. “It’s nothing. I’m okay now.”</p><p>“Stop saying that when you’re obviously not,” he scoffed as he got up, and she realized how much taller than her he was. Even with her heels, he towered over her. He exhaled sharply when he saw her hesitation and put a hand on her shoulder comfortingly. “I know I’m not Ron or Harry, or even Ginny. But I <i>am</i> your friend, and I <i>do</i> want to help you feel better.”</p><p>Hermione bit her bottom lip as she thought about it. Both of the twins were infamous tricksters, but George was usually the gentle one of them. Fred tended to be more callous, needing his brother to pull him back. That was one of the ways Hermione had actually learned to discern them when she first met them, so she was surprised that it would be Fred trying to make her feel better. But she supposed that maybe she’d judged him too soon.</p><p>“He said that Viktor was only interested in me because I’m friends with Harry,” she admitted with a shattered voice. Her throat started hurting in the torturous way it always did when she was trying to hold back her crying. “That all Viktor wanted was to get an edge in the Tournament. And <i>that</i> was after he’d suggested that the reason Viktor spent time with me in the library was just because he wanted to snog me.”</p><p>She covered her mouth before she started sobbing again. But it was too late, the tears were starting to come back. Before she knew it, Fred’s arms were around her and she was trembling with every cry that tore itself from her throat. He rubbed her back until she was done, his fingers warm against the expanse of skin exposed by her dress.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said gently.</p><p>Hermione shook her head, saying against his chest, “It’s not your fault. And I know how he is sometimes. I wouldn’t have minded on any other night, but I wanted tonight to be nice. Ron just--- He---”</p><p>Closing her eyes, she buried her face as she lost the ability to speak coherently.</p><p>“He made you feel like you weren’t special,” Fred finished for her, surprisingly. He pulled back from the hug and lifted her chin to meet her eyes. “Look, Hermione, my brother is a fourteen-year old boy, which means he’s bound to be an idiot, especially where girls are concerned. But you? You’re brilliant and compassionate. Trust me, an older guy like Viktor has matured enough to see that and appreciate it. I promise, Ron might have been a menace tonight, but he’ll learn better - if he knows what’s good for him.”</p><p>“Thank you,” she said under her breath, trying for a smile. “Really. I must look a mess, but at least I feel a little better.”</p><p>“Good.” He swiped his thumb across her cheeks to rub away the tear tracks. “And if you happen to think that pulling a prank on Ickle Ronnikins would make you feel even better, Georgie and I will be eager to help.”</p><p>Hermione glanced over to the Great Hall. “Speaking of which, where is George? Aren’t you two usually joined at the hip?”</p><p>“He’s dancing with Angelina Johnson,” Fred grinned proudly, walking her to the entrance and pointing out his brother. “Finally.”</p><p>Confusion took the place of Hermione’s strife, and she asked, “Wait, didn’t <i>you</i> ask Angelina to the Ball?”</p><p>With a nervous laugh, he scratched the back of his neck and admitted, “As friends. See, George fancies her, but he’s a bit hesitant when it comes to making the first move. When I heard that the girl I was thinking of asking had already agreed to go with someone else, I decided I’d better prevent the same thing from happening to him. I got Alicia Spinnet in on my little plan, and now he and Angie are twirling the night away.”</p><p>When Hermione caught a glimpse of Fred’s beaming smile, her tears were all forgotten, and she was suddenly grinning along. “I think this is the only scheme of yours that I wholeheartedly approve of.”</p><p>His bright eyes landed on her. “Oh, come on, you didn’t <i>absolutely</i> love when George and I dropped live bugs on the Slytherin girls?”</p><p>“That’s a close second,” she admitted, trying to stop herself from grinning even wider at the memory of Pansy Parkinson’s shrieks. But there was still something that left her usual curiosity unsated. She nudged Fred with her elbow to get his attention again. “So, about that girl you really wanted to go to the Yule Ball with…”</p><p>The genuine joy in his eyes gave way to his usual smirk. “Shall I warn you ahead of time that I haven’t even told George about her, or would you ask who she is anyway?”</p><p>Her eyes widened at this surprising information, which only set about a new blaze of questions in her head. Why would he mention something in passing to her that he wouldn’t even talk to his brother about? Did he really care that much about making her feel better after Ron’s callousness? And what kind of girl was it that Fred felt he either couldn’t tell George or just didn’t want to?</p><p>Pushing those questions to the back of her mind, she said, “I would ask anyway. But you wouldn’t answer, right?”</p><p>“See? Told you, you’re brilliant,” he laughed, casually throwing his arm around her shoulders. “Mind if I walk you back to the common room?”</p><p>On instinct, her hand flew up to his wrist, about to take his arm off her shoulders the way she always did whenever he and George got a bit too familiar for her liking as they made jokes. But as soon as her fingers met his skin, she reminded herself that he wasn’t being malicious. Her hand relaxed on his forearm, and she rubbed her thumb across the sleeve of his dress robes.</p><p>“Actually, I think I’d like that."</p>
