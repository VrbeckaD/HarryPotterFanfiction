    <p> Professor Severus Snape grabbed a quill from his desk, strapped a katana on under his cloak, and pelted toward the Astronomy Tower, cursing with every step. Damn it to hell, somehow the Malfoy brat had managed to bring Death Eaters into the castle despite all Severus’ work against it. How? How had the little swot outsmarted him, a man brilliant enough to play the spy right under the Dark Lord’s non-existent nose? It defied all rea—</p><p>A blast overhead cut through Severus’ internal rant, and the man spat curses and bolted toward the Astronomy Tower staircase. Bellatrix’s insane cackling created a strange cacophony with the thuds of his boots against the creaking stairs and the distant sounds of battle. He shoved his fury aside—there would be time in the future to discover Draco’s plot, but only if he hurried. If the brat actually followed through with the Dark Lord’s plan, Merlin help them. The Order would perish without its head.</p><p>Severus kept a tally of his ‘allies’ as he climbed staircase after staircase. Dolohov, Rowle, the Lestrange brothers … this would get messy fast unless he could somehow deflect the plan before Draco finished it, or someone else finished Draco.</p><p>A shudder worked its way down Severus’ spine. He had little hope of preventing either outcome, not with the Death Eaters watching his every move. He could only pray that Potter showed more intelligence than his usual idiocy suggested and pulled off another miracle.</p><p>He had little hope of that, too. Even Potter’s infamous luck had to run out sometime.</p><p>The screams and booms faded to a muted thrum as Severus reached the final staircase before the balcony. A reddish-silver barrier shimmered before him, Selwyn and Gibbon holding it steady with a bored air while Bellatrix observed the happenings from the landing.</p><p>“About time you made it, Snape,” Gibbon said. “We ain’t got much time. Order’ll be here any minute.”</p><p>“Indeed.” Severus stepped through the barrier, his thoughts whirling and his heart beating against his ribs. “I assume Malfoy has yet to accomplish his task?”</p><p>“Aye,” said Selwyn. “Acting a fool, he is. Best you go and knock some sense into him.”</p><p>Bellatrix let out a mad cackle. “Itty bitty baby Malfoy is a fraidy-cat. Don’t worry now, dearie. Auntie Bella will play with you later, make you feel all better.”</p><p>Severus suppressed a shudder and scowled at the insane woman. Merlin, how he detested the bitch. Even Potter didn’t compare, but he buried that fact deep under his Occlumency shields. All would be in vain if the Dark Lord ever discovered his true leanings.</p><p>With a deep, bracing breath, he shoved all emotion under a cold facade and swept up the last few stairs, fingers wrapped around a spare quill in his pocket. Relieved he hadn’t misplaced it in his hurried ascent, he glided into the shadowed edge of the landing, his wand out and cloak billowing behind him.</p><p>At the top of the tower, Albus stood beside the far parapet, disarmed and greenish thanks to the sickly light of the Dark Mark hovering above. Greyback and the Carrows flanked a shaking Malfoy as he faced the Headmaster, the moonlight glinting off his eyes and suspicious silvery trails on his cheeks.</p><p>“Draco, you are not a murderer,” Albus pleaded in a low voice.</p><p>Draco fired back, “What would you know?” His voice broke somewhere in the middle. “You don’t know what he, what he’ll—”</p><p>A threatening bark from Greyback cut across Draco’s pathetic plea. “Shut it, idiot! We’ve already wasted enough time listening to your moaning. Get on with it!”</p><p>Amycus Carrow gave Draco a rough push with the end of his wand. “Do it, or I’ll do it for you. Then we’ll see how terrible your fate is, hmm?”</p><p>Draco closed his eyes and shivered, but aimed at Albus’ heart. “Av-Avada—”</p><p>From under Albus’ robes, a wand twitched into the old man’s hand, glowing green with spell light that froze Severus’ heart to his ribs. No. Severus couldn’t allow Albus to taint his soul like that. Not like his own. He had to act now, before Albus was forced to ruin them both.</p><p>Severus leapt forward and shot a curse from the dark, one Albus was well aware had only one antidote—the potion he had given Albus to carry earlier in the year just in case Severus had to ‘kill’ him for show. Albus gave a soft moan and thumped to the floor, unconscious and, if the Death Eaters took the chance of checking his vitals, apparently dead.</p><p>A barely audible gasp and slight shimmer from the fallen Headmaster’s side warned Severus of Potter’s presence. He suppressed a wince and hoped the idiot boy would obey his surreptitious signal to stay put. There was no answer, thankfully.</p><p>Greyback came out of his shock with a growl. “You bleeding idiot! The Malfoy brat was supposed to do him in!”</p><p>Severus put his practised sneer in place. “You know as well as I that you have to mean the Unforgivable curses, wolf. Malfoy’s pathetic attempt at the Avada wouldn’t have so much as bloodied the fool’s nose. We had orders—if Malfoy could not finish him, we would. He is dead now. What is your issue?”</p><p>The werewolf bared his teeth. “I was gonna finish him! Now you’ve gone and ruined it.”</p><p>Severus sneered. “Well, it seems as though you will need to find another way to ingratiate yourself upon our lord.” He swung his cloak around him and stalked to the stairs. “Come. They will find him sooner than we shall like, and we will be outnumbered and trapped if we are caught here. We must flee—quickly!”</p><p>“Don’t think this is over, Snape,” Greyback growled.</p><p>“Indeed? I await your pathetic and no doubt entertaining attempts at vengeance with bated breath.”</p><p>Greyback snarled and stormed past the spy, a pair of glaring Carrows following in their wake. Bellatrix grabbed Draco’s arm and whispered something in the boy’s ear that made him go even paler than before.</p><p>Severus frowned and grabbed Draco’s arm away from the madwoman. “I shall take him to the Dark Lord, Bellatrix. I completed his plans—it is my right of conquest to punish him how the Dark Lord and I see fit.”</p><p>Bellatrix gave another high-pitched laugh and grinned. “Wouldn’t be you for all the kingdoms, Drakie-wakie. Our dear Severus is quite … creative with his punishments.” Her jeering mirth rang all the way down the stairs as she made her escape.</p><p>Draco shuddered and struggled to hold back a sob.</p><p>Severus shot a scowl at the woman’s back and watched as they disappeared down the landing. When sufficient time had passed for them to have cleared the immediate area, Severus dragged Draco to the doorway and peered down through the shadows. A quick flick of his wand revealed the Death Eater barrier had been dissolved and there was no sign of the others. The spy breathed a relieved sigh—they were safe, for the moment.</p><p>“It’s all right, Malfoy. I won’t hurt you. And you can come out now, Potter.”</p><p>Beside him, Draco reeled back as if struck. “<em>Potter</em>!”</p><p>“Yeah, been here the whole time.” The messy-haired boy removed his invisibility cloak and gave Severus a grim look. “I didn’t hear you cast, sir. Was that the curse we discussed?”</p><p>Severus growled at the implication. “Of course it was, you idiot! Hurry now, he will need the antidote within fifteen minutes if he is to survive past the dawn.”</p><p>He marched a thunderstruck Draco to the parapet near Albus’ toppled form and shoved the spare quill in the boy’s hand. “Hide it well. It is a portkey, set to take you to Île Saint-Honorat off the southern coast of France. The activation word is ‘<em>fidelis</em>.’ Wait to activate it until I take you into the cells of Malfoy Manor—I will place you with your parents so they are able to escape with you. Give it a few moments after I leave, so my loyalties are not questioned.”</p><p>Malfoy’s jaw dropped. “Bloody hell! You really are a spy?”</p><p>“I am trusting you to keep that information secret, Draco. Occlude it well, or I shall use you as a test subject for poisons.”</p><p>Malfoy gulped. “Y-yes, sir.”</p><p>“Good.” Severus gave him a hard look. “Do not come back to Britain until this war is over, Draco, unless you learn the truth about your traitorous former master and decide to fight on the right side.”</p><p>Potter cried, “Oi! Who said anything about letting that slimy git on our side regardless?”</p><p>Severus gave him a frosty glare. “I did. Grow up, Potter. Your childish prejudice against Slytherins is quite as dangerous and misguided as Draco’s views of Muggleborns.”</p><p>Potter’s cheeks pinked and his eyes widened. “I, I … damn.”</p><p>Severus took Potter’s heartsick expression as proof that the boy might one day rise above his father’s prejudice. He could hope, at least.</p><p>“I’ve no intention of fighting with <em>Potter</em> anyway,” the Malfoy brat said with a lofty tone. “I have taste, unlike some I could mention.”</p><p>Severus dragged Malfoy to the parapet edge and jerked out his wand. “Then you had best stay out of Britain.”</p><p>He looked back over his shoulder and motioned to the Headmaster’s fallen form. “The antidote to that curse should still be in his breast pocket, Potter. If he is not carrying it, I have another in my office, second drawer from the top under a false bottom, in a red vial. The hidden panel will open with a password: ‘<em>veritas.</em>’ My office password is ‘<em>asphodel</em>.’ Do try and remember. I’ve no time to write it on your palm.”</p><p>Potter scoffed. “I’m not an idiot, <em>sir</em>.”</p><p>“Then hurry with the antidote. You have perhaps ten minutes to save the Headmaster’s life, not that I have high hopes with you in guardianship of it.”</p><p>With a terse nod, the boy leaned down to Albus and fumbled in the man’s pocket. “Ah. Yes, he has it. Come on, Professor Dumbledore. I have some medicine for you.”</p><p>“He can’t hear you, genius,” Malfoy snapped.</p><p>Potter glared at him, but continued with his work anyway. Severus jerked his eyes away as soon as he saw the vial against Albus’ paper-white lips.</p><p>“Come, Draco, we must go before the others suspect. Hold tightly to my neck.”</p><p>“Your <em>neck</em>? Why?”</p><p>Severus grabbed Draco around the waist and hugged the boy to his chest. “This is why,” and he leapt from the tower.</p><p>Draco let out a strangled gasp, but before the boy could shout, Severus’ spell took effect, and the two marked wizards soared into the sky.</p><p>Potter’s shocked cry rang in his ears. “Professor!” His messy head poked over the parapet and, in the light of the Dark Mark, his saucer-wide eyes glowed killing-curse green. “What the hell?”</p><p>Severus snarled, “Stop gaping, Potter,” and soared toward the gates. The gobsmacked boy shook himself and disappeared over the edge of the parapet once more.</p><p>Once Potter had gone, Draco gasped out, “Holy shite, Severus! Are you trying to scare me to death?”</p><p>“I had considered it.”</p><p>Draco shuddered and buried his face in Severus’ shoulder. “You, you wouldn’t have had to try hard. I was already almost there.”</p><p>Severus acknowledged his comment with a nod. “Murder is not as easy as you thought, is it?”</p><p>“No,” the boy breathed. “I, I couldn’t do it.”</p><p>“Be glad. After, it is even worse. There is a reason the Avada is the darkest magic. It tears your soul.” Severus closed his eyes and willed the old pain away, the burn across his chest that cut deeper each time the Dark Lord’s mad quest forced him to take another life. “I would not wish that fate on you.”</p><p>Unbidden, the image of Potter’s glowing eyes entered his mind, superimposed with Albus’s lit wand. Killing-curse green. An icy shard of worry niggled its way into his belly. Would Albus have truly killed Draco to spare his own life? He had surely known the boy’s curse would fail—Albus knew more magic than most master spellcrafters could ever hope to imagine. He understood every aspect of the Unforgivables, or Severus would start giving out compliments for free.</p><p>So why would Albus, the Lord of Light and defeater of the Dark Lord Grindelwald, have needed to kill a terrified teenager whom he knew couldn’t hurt him? Perhaps he might have been aiming for Bellatrix or Greyback, but the man had been staring at Draco the entire time. The question left him unsettled, though he hid his disquiet behind his Occlumency shields. It would not do to let Albus see his doubts, not at all. Nor his <em>other</em> colleagues.</p><p>A sharp voice brought him out of his musings.</p><p>“Oi, Severus! Hurry it up! Order’s here.”</p><p>Gibbon. Shame he hadn’t been killed yet, though it appeared at least Selwyn hadn’t made it away from the school unscathed. He allowed himself a small smirk for the Death Eater’s fate.</p><p>Then the ground met Severus’ feet, and he shoved his thoughts to the back of his mind. The time to resume his act had come.</p><p>“Let us go, then.”</p><p>He grabbed Draco’s arm, swung his cloak around him, and bolted into the night.</p>
