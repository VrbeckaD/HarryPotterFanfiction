    <p>He kicked the pebble under his foot and watched it tumble down the empty sidewalk. It was little ways past midnight and no one was on the streets, which was perfect. Severus liked walking when he needed to think, and with no interruptions, it was easier. Everything in his life was happening so quickly that he hardly had time to even comprehend what happened. Things all started going downhill for him back at Hogwarts, when he lost Lily’s friendship, then more and more things piled up. Practically being forced to join the Dark Lords supporters, the Death Eaters, was one. Tonight, another happened, which was why he was back at Cokeworth. He had visited his parents but really it seemed more like an attempt. They started fighting and he left at that, not wanting to be in the crossfire. Now he was walking the empty sidewalk, wondering about how he got here. He stopped near a dark alley, hoping he could use the place for a smoke. He leaned on the brick wall of one of the houses creating the alley and pulled out a package of cigarettes. He lit one and dragged on it, then pulled it from his mouth and sighed. ‘<em>It couldn’t get any worse.’ </em>He thought while pocketing the box. Then, it did get worse.</p><p>Suddenly he was shoved from behind and he toppled to the cement ground. He scrapped his hands bracing himself from hitting his face. He turned over on his back to face whatever this was, nothing normal could have shoved him from the wall, he was too close to it for someone to be able to squeeze through unnoticed. A shadow stood where he once was. “The hell?”</p><p>The shadow moved and began to form into an odd mass, and soon, the mass began to look human. A foot, then feet, approached him. The figure took the shape of a hunched over man, who looked to be in his late fifties or sixties. He stepped on and crushed Snape’s fallen cigarette as he neared. The soft light of the street lamp showed his features clearly. He was pale, had hardly any hair aside from a few white wisps, and was showing a crooked smile that revealed two large, white fangs at the top of his mouth.</p><p>“The Good Lord has truly blessed me, here I was, expecting to dry, but he sent me an offering to quench my <em>thirst.</em>” He whispered, though his voice was soft it carried easily and echoed in Severus’s head, almost like it was a working of magic. “Don’t worry, boy, I might not drain you completely. Heh ha-ha-ha” His laughter died after he coughed a couple of times. Severus was still on the ground facing him, petrified. This looked to be a vampire, but vampires couldn’t just, waltz out of shadowy walls. Well, at least to his and the rest of the wizarding worlds knowledge. Also, was the vampire sick? He coughed after just a small round of villainous laughter, which was odd. How could a vampire get sick? The old and possibly sick vampire was now standing beside him. Only then did Severus think to pull his wand out, but it was too late, he lost his chance. He attempted to reach his pocket with one of his hands, but then he was grabbed by the collar of his jacket and slammed forcefully on one of the brick walls of the alley with more strength than could be possible. The vampire seemed to have lost a lot of whatever was left of his supernatural strength because he was now panting.</p><p>“Don’t fret child, I only need a drink…” He leaned his head down to Snape’s neck and bit right where a vein was. Severus gasped, tears stung his eyes as a bitter pain consumed him. A coppery-metallic taste settled on his tongue, and white spots danced as his field of vision started to blur. He wanted to free himself, but he found nothing in himself to struggle. He felt that he was starting to sink, his head started to pang and he could hear his own heartbeat. His ears were ringing and his torso and arms started to feel a tingly numbing sensation. He felt like he should just collapse and give in, then a wave of strange determination swept through him, and he thrashed his arms, trying to free himself. The vampire only dug his claw-like nails into one of his shoulders and continued sucking his blood. He needed to get free, quickly, or he was going to die from being drained into a raisin.</p><p>He gave a sharp and strong kick and sent the vampire into the opposite wall of the tight alley. He could hardly see, but he could make out his form that was sagging up against the brick. A watery red liquid was spilling from the side of his forehead and his eyes were open, unmoving, unblinking. Severus slumped down to the ground and leaned against the wall, exhausted and feeling as though all of his energy was drained. He internally prayed that the vampire doesn’t get up again, staring at his form. He reached a hand to his neck and felt the drying blood and the liquid still gushing through the two puncture wounds. His eyelids began to droop, though he tried to stay awake for a bit, he eventually fell into a black, dreamless sleep of unconsciousness.</p><p align="center">~【∙∙·▫▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ~ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫▫·∙∙】~</p><p>He felt a warmth on the side of his face as he awoke. Consciousness returning, he could see the orange of light through his eyelids. He licked his dry lips, a coppery taste still lingered on his tongue.</p><p>“Hey, I think he’s wake’n up!” He heard a kid shout, then he could hear a few more muffled voices, probably agreeing. He pried his eyes open, then righted himself up against the wall with a groan. He looked at the group that consisted of four boys, who all looked to be ten or eleven.</p><p> “You alright Mister?” One of the boys, who sounded like the first voice he heard, asked. Memories of last night then came back and hit him like a deer would get hit by a truck: blood everywhere. He reached up and felt his neck, the dried blood was still there, but where the puncture marks from the fangs were, was now covered with the smooth skin scars typically were made of. <em>‘So, the mark was probably still visible? Grand, just grand.’</em></p><p>“I think I’m going to be alright.” He flat out lied, being honest he had no clue if he was or not. <em>‘Hopefully, the kids didn’t see the mark or my dark one. I don’t want to have to use my magic and obliterate a kid.’</em> He thought, since he was so energy drained he probably couldn’t pull it off anyway.</p><p>“That’s good, then.” The boy said. Another boy chimed in, “You sure? That looks like a lot of blood.”</p><p>Severus blinked hazily, then answered. “If I haven’t died then it’s not too much, and the wound has closed too.”</p><p>“Oh.” He got in response from the boys. He rubbed his neck again, in a still shock, pondering how in the world this has happened. The ran his fingers over the now healed wounds of the bite. <em>‘A bite, a vampire bite, I can’t believe it-’ </em>He realized something, then. He looked over to where the boys were standing talking to one another, then to where he last remembered seeing the vampire who bit him. There, by the wall, was a large pile of ash. Then yet another thing hit him. ‘If I’m a vampire now, then why have I not burned up in the sunlight too?’ Sunlight rarely shone this well in Cokeworth due to all the smog, but today, a bit of sky was peeking through. He sighed, it was Saturday, but just sitting here and thinking about what has happened to him isn’t a good idea. This group of kids are sweet, but their parents and other adults might not be.</p><p>“Hey, kids,” He called to the group, three faces, and their attention was turned back to him, “Are your parents anywhere close to around here?”</p><p>“Yes.” The one he hadn’t heard from yet said. “Yep.” The<em> ‘questioner’</em> answered. “Yeah, my house is that one.” The last pointed to the house that made the other wall of the alley. <em>‘Okay that’s good, I wasn’t wanting to deal with runaways or anything similar.’</em></p><p>“Kay, good, I wasn’t wanting to walk anyone back home.” He said to the trio. Like magic, almost, their faces changed.</p><p>“We could go back ourselves!” The <em>‘my house is that one’</em> kid argued.</p><p>“Yeah! We wouldn’t and <em>don’t</em> need any help.” The kid who woke him up joined in. The quieter one still kept quiet, though reading his face you could tell he shared thoughts to the others.</p><p>“I grew up here, kids, and the streets here haven’t changed. If I have to protect you, I will.” He told them, hoping he could be rid of the aggressive side of them, Lord in Heaven knows he wants nothing more of angered ten-year-old kids.</p><p>“What could <em>your</em> protection do? You couldn’t even protect yourself!” The talkative one pointed out. <em>‘Damn, brat’s right though, I didn’t protect myself.’</em></p><p>“<em>Okay</em>, fine, kids,” He rose to his feet slowly, body still feeling tingly. “I’m going to get going then.” He strode past them. “Stay out of too much trouble, understand?” He got a few exasperated groans from that. He walked down a few blocks then turned into another empty alley and appariated, thinking of going home.</p><p align="center">~【∙∙·▫▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ~ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫▫·∙∙】~</p><p>He expected to be at his flat when he appariated but was shocked as to what he saw before him.</p><p>An enormous gothic cathedral-like building rose over the surrounding trees, which was impressive, seeing how the trees were sequoia, giant ones at that. The base building was wide and rectangular, with the painted glass windows you could count three floors. Two towers were located at the back corners of the building, with crosses of equal height at the top of their roofs. Another tower was at the front, center of the base. It was bigger than both of the twin ones and had a large clock and bell near the top. The tower also had its own cross on its roof. At the bottom, large stairs lead up to an arching overhang connected to a smaller building. The small building looked to lead into the main tower.</p><p>Severus shut his jaw back together and gathered a bit of courage to approach the large building. He thought of going home when he appariated, but he came here instead of where he lived. He wondered if it was a slip up on his part, or if it was a result of last night’s events. He approached the large steps and got his answer soon enough. The overhang looked like an upside-down bat with its wings spread out, and the windows of the smaller building behind it look as if they were shaped to be its ears.</p><p>He climbed his way up the steps and passed under the echoey overhang, his footsteps ringing out as if he had muggle micro-phones at his feet. He reached the dark, large oak wood doors and reached out a fist to knock. To his surprise, the doors swung open without anyone there. He stepped inside and marveled at the grand interior of this gothic structure.</p><p>As what goes up must come down is a rule, so is what can open can close, and close did doors behind him do. He turned sharply around and tugged at the giant handles, but the wood never budged.</p><p>“Damnit!” He swore under his breath.</p><p align="center">~【∙∙·▫▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ~ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫ₒₒ▫ᵒᴼᵒ▫▫·∙∙】~</p>
