    <p>He had seen the dog, and took a step back, feeling his trunk there and stopped backing up, squaring himself up again. The dog made no move to attack him, but didn’t back away either. It reminded him of the posturing the snake did during the only Dueling Club meeting last year. He hadn’t yet spoken since the adrenaline left his system from fleeing Privet Drive.</p>
<p>“H-hey there.” He began shakily. “Come on out of there.” Harry said a bit more assuredly.</p>
<p>The dog stepped forward slowly his head had gone from posturing to low and it was obvious he was smelling Harry. Harry cancelled the spell with a quiet “<em>Nox</em>.” Still figuring that there was little point in worrying about excess magic. He took his broom out and began to perform the enchantments he had thought of previously. The feather-light charm was perhaps the easiest to perform then it dawned on him that he was still in plain view of any Muggle that could possibly want to see him.</p>
<p>Harry grabbed the now immensely light trunk and walked off to a bit more secluded spot, the invisibility cloak he had previously taken out of his trunk wrapped around him as he carried the trunk awkwardly to ensure it didn’t look to be just floating. The dog didn’t seem to be surprised when he disappeared. Instead, he followed Harry to a nearby park that had a small amount of woods that would allow him to hide what he was doing. When he reappeared the dog once again didn’t look surprised, he simply sat and softly barked at Harry.</p>
<p>Once the dog had gained his attention he slowly sat and then transformed back into the man he was born. His ragged clothing was not how he had intended to meet Harry, but the opportunity that had been provided was too much to pass up for Sirius Black, alleged murder, escaped from Azkaban.</p>
<p>“Harry please! Don’t do anything rash! I mean no harm!” The man said frantically while Harry appeared to be stunned.</p>
<p>“You’re an animagus!” Harry said incredulously. “Who are you?! Why are you spying on me, are you from the Ministry to take my wand?” Harry wasn’t thinking rationally, clearly this man had no viable form of employment, why would he be dressed in such rags if so?</p>
<p>Sirius Black barked out harsh laughter. “No Harry, I’m not from the ministry, although, I do think they’re likely to be looking for you, especially considering who they believe me to be.” Black had at that moment got a gleam in his eye, he had just remembered that he was likely the sole Heir of the Black family. “Kreacher!”</p>
<p>A loud pop and a ragged house elf appeared in front of the two wizards. “Kreacher is answering the call, but he does not know who could possibly compel his magic to answer.” Then a gasp of horror came from the elf, “The scum offspring of my poor mistress!” Kreacher got out before Black had ordered him quiet.</p>
<p>“Kreacher, enough! Take the both of us to Grimmauld Place immediately!” Black ordered in a harsh tone, happy that his gambit had worked. He could explain his sudden abduction to Harry hopefully.</p>
<p>Harry was looking at the scene before him and then all too late realized that he was being popped away from the area with his trunk and broomstick. The stone kitchen he appeared in seemed to have not been cleaned in any meaningful way ever. There was no dust but the room was filthy. Harry was immediately on guard and had his wand pointing at the ragged man once he got his bearings.</p>
<p>“Harry, please. <em>Listen</em>,” The man implored of Harry. His hands were up, and he made no motions of moving. Harry had no idea what to do, he was in an undisclosed location with a man who knew him, but Harry didn’t know. That was hardly uncommon though Harry thought. Harry lowered his wand slowly, keeping it clenched in his hand though.</p>
<p>The story the man told was one he could hardly believe. He more than once almost cursed the man into oblivion when he worded things vaguely which could imply the man’s guilt in his parent’s murder. Harry had no idea how he was going to sort through this load of dragon dung until the man asked if he knew what a Wizard’s Oath was. Harry had no clue, it wasn’t something they had covered in history of magic yet or in Charms.</p>
<p>“It’s essentially a magically certified oath. Magic has nasty consequences for anyone who breaks one.” Black explained the workings to Harry, who admitted to himself that it sounded plausible. Harry thought to himself, wishing he knew of their existence last year so he could have stopped everyone from believing that he was the Heir of Slytherin. When he thought of the prior year he immediately remembered Dobby. Who knew if he could hear Harry’s call now that he was a free elf, but Harry figured he could try.</p>
<p>“Dobby!” Harry called out with along with his magic and mind.</p>
<p>Sirius stood dumbfounded in the kitchen as another house elf appeared in the kitchen, this one was much younger and healthier than Kreacher and immediately looked at Harry and then to Sirius.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter sir! That is a very bad mans that is! That is Sirius Black!” Dobby’s high voice practically shrieked.</p>
<p>“I know Dobby, or well, I know he’s Sirius Black, but I can’t be sure he’s a bad man. Do you know if Wizard Oaths can be faked?” Harry asked the elf, surely having belonged to the Malfoys he would know for sure.</p>
<p>“No Harry Potter sirs. They can nots.” Dobby said and looked shocked as Harry handed his wand to Black, sure Dobby could protect him again, if needed.</p>
<p>“I, Sirius Black, do swear on my magic that everything I have told Harry Potter tonight is true regarding myself, his parents, Peter Pettigrew and my Innocence.” As Sirius spoke Magic reacted to his statement. The air around the two wizards glowed golden resonating the truth of the statement.</p>
<p>Harry immediately raged. For the last two years of his life he had dealt with not only the active threat of someone trying to kill him, but he had also slept in the same room as the person who is responsible for his orphan status. Harry began to shake with anger and had he had his wand he was sure he would have cast some nasty hexes, since he did not though, he was rewarded with another bout of accidental magic that exploded a nearby cupboard holding dishes. In the house a voice was heard yelling about who was in their house but Sirius didn’t look worried, therefore Harry did not either.</p>
<p>“There has to be a way to make him pay.” Harry said angrily. Sirius for his part was looking gleeful, someone believed in his innocence. Harry noticed this and turned his ire on the scraggly looking man, “What’s to be so happy about?”</p>
<p>“You believe me. You are the only person who I cared knew about my innocence. I’m so sorry I abandoned you. Now though, we can work out something to do about all of this.” Sirius had tears running freely from his eyes.</p>
<p>Possibilities of what to do were filling Harry’s mind at an alarming rate. Sirius quickly picked up on his trains of thought and before long, a plan was coming into fruition. Dobby for his part had gone out and with the little money Harry had got the wizards fed and added his own thoughts. By the end of the night Harry had a new appreciation for the elf he had both pitied and sometimes hated last year, now he found the creature to be more useful and wily than he once believed.</p>
<p>The duo had been sharing Harry’s wand as Sirius’s original had been snapped upon being sent to Azkaban. As they finished their planning Sirius transfigured two chairs into sleeping bags and together, they drift off. Tomorrow Harry would be leaving for Diagon Alley, as to not arise panic in the Wizarding World by means of Dobby the House Elf, soon to be known as the Savior of the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>
