    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Umbridge was watching her class, containing the Gryffindor and Slytherin fifth years, as they read her "Ministry Approved" textbook. She was confident in the knowledge that now; there was no way that they were going to rise up against the Ministry. That was everyone's (who was truly loyal to the Ministry at any rate) worst fear, an army of students being commanded by that doddering old fool, Dumbledore.</p>
<p>She took a particular pleasure in watching young Mr. Potter read through the book and write some notes down in a notebook with a scowl on his face. Nothing seemed to brighten her day more then to see the horrible little liar get taken down several pegs.</p>
<p>"<em>Ahh...being a teacher to small children is so wonderful</em>" she thought with a large smirk on her toad like lips.</p>
<p>If she had moved a little closer towards the young, raven haired lad she would have had the chance to read what the boy was writing. Unfortunately for her, she didn't know that it wasn't anything that spelt good news for her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the bell had rang to signal that it was the end of class, Harry, Hermione and Ron had wandered down to the Great Hall for lunch. Harry was still writing into his little black notebook as they walked and that, in itself, attracted Hermione's attention.</p>
<p>"Harry, what are you writing?" she said trying to peer into the small book. It wasn't often that Harry would write in that book, normally it was just one or two lines and she never got to see what it was he was writing.</p>
<p>Harry looked sideways at her and smiled. "Something that will completely eradicate that sorry excuse for fiction she insists that we read."</p>
<p>Slightly taken aback by his tone and manner of speaking, she stared at Harry. But then Hermione frowned.</p>
<p>"Harry, while it’s true that the book preaches non-practical use of magic, it is still reasonably sound, the Ministry would have checked out all the facts. The Department of Magical Education wouldn't let the book past them without it having at the very least 95% truth to it." she said shortly.</p>
<p>Harry smirked "One word, <em>Lockhart</em>." and with that he turned away from the Great Hall's staircase and traveled onto the direction in which the library was located. Hermione wanted to follow him, but Ron held her back.</p>
<p>"Leave him be, when he gets this way, you know it will be good." he said with a wicked grin on his face.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? He's never been this way! Every time he plans or thinks he knows what’s really going on, it turns out he's wrong. Name one time that he was right and I was wrong." said Hermione with a slightly snobby attitude.</p>
<p>"One word, <em>Lockhart</em>" said Ron with that same evil grin, as he took an embarrassed Hermione by the hand and led her to the Great Hall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thankfully it was only a half-day that day because Harry didn't reappear to them until dinner had already started. They even went to the library to find him and try as they might. It was to no avail. Madam Pince had shuffled them both out, with a strange smile on her face, telling the both of them that Harry didn't want to be disturbed. It was no secret that even she held some contempt for the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Especially after what she said about disposing of half of the books in the school library.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When he arrived in the Great Hall, he wasn't carrying anything except for a small white envelope and his little black book, the strange thing was, he wasn't alone. A tall, stern looking man came walking up behind him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Harry stopped he held up the small envelope, the man walked past him and snatched the envelope right out of his hand, without even stopping. Harry gave a small smile and placed both hands into his pocket, leaned back in a smug pose and smirked up to Umbridge, who didn't have any inkling of what was going on, but she did look quite frightened.</p>
<p>"Delores, how <em>nice</em> to see you again." said the man with an indifferent look upon his face.</p>
<p>Umbridge gulped. "H..Hello, R...R...Rivers. Nice to s..see you t..too."</p>
<p>"Do you have any idea, why I am here this evening?" said Rivers still looking indifferent, but ripping open the envelope and reading it quickly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She shook her head quickly. He looked down at his chest and slowly shook his head. While he held the bridge of his nose in his left hand, he put the letter in the pocket of his cloak and pulled out a copy of her textbook.</p>
<p>"Recognize this?" when she nodded quickly, he continued. "I received a message from a very concerned student that you were teaching, outdated, unproven and harmful material in class."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, outdated, unproven and harmful? That book was certified by the International Department of Magical Education!" she said indignantly.</p>
<p>"True, it WAS certified by my department. In <em>1921</em>. Since then the 'Theory of Glympdons Conjurtor' alone has caused many people who have tried to defend themselves with its so-called “aid” to suffer lifelong injuries. And that is the entire basis of the book! None of the other theories in it or any better. In fact, they are several times worse."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He then waved his wand over his head and every last copy of the Defense Against the Dark Art textbook was summoned to him. Then, in a flash of green smoke, they were gone.</p>
<p>"I'm going to be <em>very</em> nice and give you two weeks to get a better book for the students to learn from. If you don't have a better book, that teaches them BOTH theory AND practical, I will find a teacher that will. Oh yes, and I almost forgot, you have to run the books by me first. No going past me and authorizing them to the Minister. I can make damn sure that the people higher up on the food chain than him find out about your little stunts." He then turned on his heel and walked towards the door. He stopped when he reached Harry.</p>
<p>"Thanks for letting us know. God knows what kind of damage she could have done." Harry smiled in response. When Rivers left, Umbridge sent Harry a murderous look. Harry only smirked back and the teachers shared in the joy of bringing that old toad some well-deserved misery. The rest of the school stood up and applauded Mr. Potter, including even some of the Slytherins, and just to aggravate her, Harry took a bow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After dinner Umbridge left the Great Hall, slammed her office door shut behind her. She couldn't believe it, beaten by a lying, spoiled, mentally challenged, brat! She wasn't going to let this slide, though she didn't know how she was going to get even with that little beast. Then, that very same "beast" came in through the door to her office. Umbridge looked up, a little confused, but then she remembered that she had given him a week long detention, and this was the last of those joyful nights. Tonight she was going to do something <em>different</em>.</p>
<p>Harry knew picking a fight with Umbridge while he still had detention was a bad idea, but he knew that the International representative of Magical Education was only in England for a short time. He needed to oust the book soon, before she ruined everyone in fifth and seventh's years chances of getting respectable and realistic grades in the class.</p>
<p>He made to sit down, but she grabbed his arm and gave him a vicious smile. He had seen that kind of look in his Uncle Vernon's eyes and he knew that he was not going to go to bed tonight without physical conflict. But she wouldn't be that stupid to do something like that in a school. Not with Dumbledore's office a few floors away.</p>
<p>She walked over to a small picture of Filch's ragged cat, Mr. Norris and nodded at it. The mangy old cat then meowed and turned and hurried off. Filch then came into the room, grinning ear to ear and his grin grew bigger when he saw Harry looking between the two of them.</p>
<p>"Not going to do the normal lines then, I take it?" said Harry, looking at Filch with curiosity, yet edging slightly away from the two of them. The smiles on their faces were not pleasent and it gave him an uneasy feeling.</p>
<p>"Not in the slightest Mr. Potter. My little reminder doesn't seem to help you not to tell lies." she said, with that large sneer on her toad like face.</p>
<p>"Actually it does, that’s why I sent Mr. River's that owl." he smirked, wiping the grin off the horrible teacher's face. But then it came back in full force. She nodded towards Filch, who then brought out a....</p>
<p>"What's the whip for?" said Harry getting a little nervous now, but his voice didn't reveal it. Both sadists just smiled and moved forward, slowly. He backed up into the desk, and looked round quickly, there was no escape.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Three hours later he finally reached the seventh floor. He had to double over and get his breath to slow down quite a few times. His entire torso was on fire and his legs couldn't carry him anymore, after Filch and Umbridge both took the whip and other paraphenelia to him for the past three hours he had to hurry down to the school laundry room and wrap his bleeding chest, legs and back with one and a half sheets. It looked as if he gained the twenty pounds that Madame Pomfrey had always wanted him to. He tried to remember what had happened, but some of the parts were starting to get a little fuzzy and he felt himself getting colder and colder. He was getting very dizzy and he wasn't able to keep his eyes to stay focused. He had some healing potions in his trunk just for emergencies, now the only problem was getting to them, he was getting very tired.</p>
<p>Then a voice came from behind him, Harry slowly turned around and saw McGonagall come up the stairs. "Didn't you hear me Potter? I asked you what you were doing out so late, it’s about five minutes after curfew." she said sternly.</p>
<p>He was too tired to give her a complete answer, and his world was beginning to spin out of control. Harry opened his mouth to answer "Long detention" when he couldn't stand anymore and he started to fall over the railing of the moving staircase. Professor McGonagall screamed and made a grab for him as he tumbled over. She managed to grab his foot and magicked him back onto the stairs.</p>
<p>"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING BOY?! WHAT'S WRONG WITH....." she stopped short. She kneeled down quickly laid his head on her lap and felt his forehead; he was burning up with fever. She noticed the sheets under his robes and lifted the layers; she screamed a second time, only this one was louder.</p>
<p>The teachers, who were patrolling the top floors, came running up from all different directions and the Gryffindor students came running when they heard both screams. Students were standing above and teachers below the sobbing Transfigurations Professor. Dumbledore came hurrying to where the throng of people stood and saw Harry laying in his Head of House's lap. His face paled.</p>
<p>"Minerva?" said Flitwick cautiously. She looked wildly around, this scared her poor Gryffindors to no ends. They thought she had gone mad. Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Ginny, or Neville couldn't get to the front of line no matter how hard they tried. They couldn't see that it was Harry that she was crying about.</p>
<p>McGonagall was looking for Snape and when he came to the front, she pulled him done roughly to his knees and lifted the sheets, so little that only he could see. He was so taken aback that he fell off his feet and landed backwards into Dumbledore's knees.</p>
<p>"What is it? What is wrong?" he asked Snape. However, the Potions Master did not respond to him. He then scrambled back and started whipping out potions and administering them to the fevered boy. Once Harry was stable enough to be moved, they whisked him off to the Hospital Wing, it was there that the Weasely's and Hermione saw that the injured student was Harry, and they had to hold each other to stop themselves from falling down in shock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry's fever didn't break till a week later, the entire school (including a few of the Slytherins) were happy to see the young man come down to the Great Hall. But they were horrified to see that he had to lean on a cane and was followed by a harassed looking Madam Pomfrey.</p>
<p>"You should have stayed in bed Potter! You're still very weak from losing all that blood!"</p>
<p>"I feel fine; I was losing the feeling in my legs from all the laying around. This gets me the exercise that I need and besides," he added with a look towards the Gryffindor table. "I want to see Hermione and Ron. You never let them in to see me that I know of."</p>
<p>He hobbled over to Ron and Hermione and they both rushed to him and took him in their arms. Harry gritted his teeth, they had clutched at him too quickly and too tightly, but he allowed them to hold onto him as tight as they wanted. They exchanged no words but just held onto each other, and then Fred, George and Ginny came over and enshrouded Harry even further. After five minutes of just standing there hugging, they helped Harry to the table and began loading a plate for him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, I have a question for you." said Professor Dumbledore, who had happened to stand behind Harry. Harry looked up at him, for the first time that year their eyes met. Harry couldn't help but smile. Dumbledore sighed with relief, not sensing any redness in his eyes or hatred in his mind.</p>
<p>"Do you remember who had left you in that state that forced you to go to the Hospital Wing?"</p>
<p>Everyone in the Hall leaned forward, a few were eager to duel out some intense judgment to the person responsible. Even Malfoy fingered his wand in anticipation. He disliked Potter, but he really didn't HATE him. Not enough to actually wish him<em> that </em>kind of harm to happen to him. Maybe a bloody nose or black eye, but not something life threatening. Umbridge and Filch looked deadly pale and nervous; nobody noticed this, with the exception of Professor Snape. He made a mental note to tell Dumbledore his suspicions.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “I don't remember sir, I can only remember leaving the Great Hall to go to detention." It was the truth, he couldn't remember even being saved from certain death by McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Whom did you serve detention with that night?" asked Dumbledore quickly.</p>
<p>"Umbridge"</p>
<p>Students and teachers whipped around swiftly and stared. Umbridge composed herself quickly and stated. "He never made it to my detention that night. As a matter of fact, you owe me another one for not showing up, you now have to serve two more nights." she reverted back to her smug self. The students and staff stared at her in shock, but the dam finally broke.</p>
<p>"NO, HE MOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT!" screamed the staff. None more louder than Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>DUMBLEDORE, DON'T LET HER!! HE WAS INJURED! shouted the students.</p>
<p>IT WAS NO FAULT OF HIS OWN!" screamed the entire staff and student body.</p>
<p>Harry looked around dazed, unsure of what was going on. Dumbledore nodded gravely.</p>
<p>"I will not allow her to do so. Harry won't be serving detention for quite some time. I will also say that you, Harry, are not to attend classes until you are well." said Dumbledore reassuring the students and staff.</p>
<p>"I'm fine" said Harry tiredly.</p>
<p>"You save that particular statement for the periods of time that you are most gravely injured it seems." said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling, but with a sad smile upon his lips. "More of a reason for us who care deeply for you to have you, as they say in the Muggle world. 'sit this one out.' "</p>
<p>The entire school, besides Umbridge and Filch, nodded yes. Filch continued to shake fearfully, but Umbridge was furious. Just then, an owl came fluttering down to her and deposited a note, she opened it with her pink, kitten shaped letter opener and read it. Her eyes danced madly. She had him now! She had them both!</p>
