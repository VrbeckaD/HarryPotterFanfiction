    <p align="CENTER">To Rebuke a Weasley</p>
<p align="CENTER">After the dust had settled from The Second Wizarding War, it was decided that anyone who would like to return to Hogwarts for an eighth year in order to sit their NEWTS may do so. A separate wing was built for these students and each of the eight returning students were given a private room. Hermione Granger was the first student to confirm her return, naturally.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Harry and Ron thought long and hard about whether they should or not and eventually Harry coaxed Ron into returning. Though the Auror Corps said they would waive the need for NEWTS, Harry wanted to prove his worthiness. Ron initially argued that they had bloody well earned a free ride, but with the help of Hermione, Harry helped him realize that the NEWTS were an important milestone.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">The trio, along with a few other students and many members of the order, had spent the better part of the last year helping to repair Hogwarts before it's grand re-opening. Hermione had been glad to throw herself into the hard work. When she was focused on a project, she had no time to think about other things. She didn't want to think.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Even so, at night after a hard day's work, she couldn't sleep. Night terrors plagued her constantly and more than one night she thought to ask Madam Pomfrey or Professor Snape for a Dreamless Sleep potion, but always changed her mind before following through.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">She felt she would have to explain to the matron and her nightmares were personal. What she had gone through was personal. The reason she didn't go to Snape? Well she was sure he wouldn't ask for any explanation, but she didn't want his already crushing guilt to get any heavier.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">He had been inside her mind and she had felt his emotions. He had enough guilt and hurt and regret to weigh him down without her adding to it in any way. She knew how he felt about what he had to do and really it was any wonder he could even stand to be in the same room as her.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">The spell/potion combination had worn off about a week after the final battle and even now she felt a bit lonely. Having him there inside her mind had been comforting and with him gone she felt a bit hollow. She'd helped take care of him in the hospital wing just to be near him after the spell had worn off. He'd made a fuss at first, until she'd explained how she felt safer near him and how she missed him. He'd looked at her like she'd lost her mind, but not asked her to leave again.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">They'd grown closer over the months and now she felt as close to him as the boys. She would seek him out every day to check in with him or discuss the progress being made on the school and eventually he had started to seek her out as well. It was surreal when she realized that he had even become tentative friends with Ron and Harry.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">This was how she'd found herself marching down to his rooms to vent about Ron to her professor. He'd been pestering her for a date for a while now and she'd found ways to distract him up until this point. She'd been attracted to him before, but well that was before. He finally decided to confront her today and what he'd said to her had hurt her in a way that stole her breath.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Barely knocking before entering, she ran to Professor Snape and as he stood from his desk in alarm she threw her arms around him and sobbed. Patting her back awkwardly he asked, “What is it Miss Granger? What has happened?” She tried to answer, but her response was unintelligible from her crying. He managed to make out Ron's name and his only response was, “Ah, Weasley.”</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Severus had known about the pressure Mr. Weasley was putting on the girl to see him romantically, but hadn't known a way to dissuade the boy without giving away Miss Granger's secrets. The thought of her fighting off unwanted advances made him ill, but what could he say to Mr. Weasley of it. He'd not touched her against her will and from his point of view there was nothing untoward in asking for a date.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Severus sat Miss Granger down and began preparing tea as he thought the situation over. He didn't know why she had even ran to him. Surely she didn't expect to gain comfort from the man who had raped her? He really was surprised most days that she could stand to look at his ugly mug, much less consider him a friend.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">After handing her a cup filled with her favorite English Breakfast that he kept on hand solely for her visits, he sat across from her and waited for her to calm herself. Severus had just lifted his own cup of Earl Grey to his lips when she whispered, “He called me a frigid bitch.”</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">His cup rattled violently against the saucer as he set his cup down untouched. “Did he now?”, he asked much too calmly. Hermione looked up, startled to see him occluding for the first time since the war had ended. His face was a blank mask, but just subtly in his eyes she saw that old rage. She hadn't seen it in so long that she'd almost forgotten it ever existed.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Seeing him so rigidly angry made her want to take the words back. Back-peddling, she stammered, “Well you can't really blame him. I mean I am-” She was cut off by his hand being violently thrust forward. “Do. Not. Finish that sentence Miss Granger.”, he hissed angrily. Composing himself he continued in a much more reasonable tone, “You are not frigid. You have been traumatized by something no one should have to go through. Perhaps if you shared a bit with the boy.”</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">“I can't. You know that.”, she cried exasperatedly. “Even if I didn't tell him the who of it...” She trailed off before mumbling pitifully, “He'd never look at me without pity again.” Severus took a deep breath and ran a hand down his face. Finally he said, “I'll talk to the boy, shall I? I won't mention your ordeal, just that he should learn petulance and insults will get him nowhere with the fairer sex.” Hermione looked at him with such gratitude that it stole his breath.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Later that evening Severus followed Weasley and Potter out after dinner. Miss Granger had sat with Mr. Longbottom and Miss. LoveGood. Greeting Potter with a nod, he turned to Weasley. “A word Mr. Weasley”, he intoned imperiously with an arch of his brow. He turned not waiting for an answer and led Weasley to a deserted corridor.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Turning he saw that the imbecile looked nervous. Good. Without warning Severus rammed him against the stone wall and shoved his forearm against his throat. He then leaned in close and whispered in his ear, “Mr. Weasley I may not have enjoyed being a death eater, but I assure you I learned quite a bit while in Voldemort's employ. If you ever so much as think another disparaging remark about Miss Granger I. Will. Gut. You. Like the squealing little piglet that you are. Do you understand me?” At Weasley's panicked nodding, Severus stepped back and smoothed his robes. As he turned to go, he threw over his shoulder, “Have some pride man. If she doesn't want you there are sure to be other witches who do.”</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">No one heard from Ron for the rest of the night, but the next morning he asked to speak with Hermione privately. Though she was leery of what he might say to further damage her self-image she followed him out of the Great Hall and into the empty corridor. He scratched the back of his head and looked anywhere but at her as he said, “I was out of line yesterday. I knew it as soon as you ran off. Sending Snape after me wasn't necessary, but I understand why you did it. I deserved worse than the theatrics he used honestly.”</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Hermione wasn't sure if she were more surprised at his lack of anger or his quick apology, but she was relieved that their friendship hadn't ended because of her fear of intimacy. She exhaled the breath that she didn't realize she held and smiled at him. “Oh Ron, you're forgiven and I'm not sure what Professor Snape said to you, but I regretted telling him about yesterday when I saw how angry he got. I was a bit worried he'd get physical with you, so it's good to see you in one piece.”, She joked. As she began to walk away she didn't see him blanch at her mention of violence, nor the dark figure standing guard behind a pillar.</p>
