    <p>“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, “Will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come.  I say to you all, once again—in light of Lord Voldemort’s return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.  Lord Voldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great.  We can only fight it by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.  Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.”  [ GoF, Ch37 ]</p>
<p>Upon the stone dais, without benefit of support, stood a stone arch; an arch, from which, was draped the Veil of Death, within the Department of Mysteries, in the basement of the Ministry for Magic.  An unnatural invisible smoke, a smoke that any living soul would feel like fingernails scraping across a chalkboard, a smoke that offended every hair in the nostrils, drifted upward from the curtain, for beneath it, perched on the edge of death, was a simmering cauldron over black flame.  Floating in the foul smelling and boiling goo were a pair of gray eyes, both blinking and staring at a naked Hermione, as if pleading for a life fleeting away.  Hermione, bound, gagged, dripping droplets of pee between her legs, and tied to a stone column, only gave a look of scorn, of judgment against those eyes, before moving her eyes away. Also bound and naked, beside Hermione, was her best living friend, love interest to another good friend, Gia, who paid no attention to the eyes in the cauldron, but instead, at the snake like red eyes of the figure beside the cauldron, the one scooping out the green acid–like substance into a goblet.  He swirled the cup.</p>
<p>“Behold!” Voldemort exclaimed, “The Elixir of Immortality!”</p><hr/>

  <p>
    <b>Two years earlier…</b>
  </p>
</div><p>It started all so innocently, that hot summer after their fifth year, the heat of the day was just beginning. Instead of Harry going to the Dursleys, he had decided to tap his inheritance, treat his friends to a trip across Europe, to travel to Romania and back.</p>
<p>We start on this Monday morning, the first of July, in the county of Devon, just outside the village of St. Ottery, at a dilapidated and impossible building of the Burrow.  Outside this building, Crookshanks chased a rat around the pond.  Smoke billowed out of the kitchen window instead of the chimney; an open window framed Fred’s blackened, soot covered, face.  Bees buzzed as they went among the flowers and foliage of the garden.  Gnomes frolicked in the garden.  Dressed in emerald green robes, Professor McGonagall apparated and approached the front door.</p>
<p>However, in the uppermost bedroom, just below the attic, were four teenagers still asleep on the pair of beds.  A glow was illuminating the bedroom in spite of the best efforts of the faded <i>Chudley Canons</i> curtains to shield the occupants from the Sun that was in the sky and threatening to pass them by.  A breeze came through the window and moved the curtains, which let rays of light reach inside, their tendrils hitting the occasional metal.  Pigwidgeon’s cage was empty as the bird paid more attention to the start of the day than any of the four sleeping teenagers.  On one bed were Ron and Hermione; the other was Harry and Gia, a Muggle girl and Harry’s girlfriend.  <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>An uncomfortable tug, and Ron was the first to open his eyes.  Naked and on the bed, he pulled the sheet from Hermione, leaning on him from his left, covering them both; his firm tent pole remained even though Hermione’s fidgeting hand kept grabbing at his red curly pubic hair.</p>
<p>Snorts and moans came from the other bed in the room; as that couple turned, dragging their white sheet cover, until only Harry’s left leg was left to the imagination and Gia was behind him, as they too were naked.  Harry’s teeth chattered as he peed and drenched the bottom sheet, her left arm moved over his shoulder, her fingers stroked his ear, and he calmed down.  Above them, the rays of the early morning sun helped the myriad of <i>Chudley Canons</i> posters continue in their fading.</p>
<p>Creaks from the door, and it opened, rapidly, revealing Ginny, with her wet red hair and a towel in her hands that did nothing to hide her knickers nor her pussy behind the hole of her panties.  A quick glance at Harry and study of his soft todger, before Ginny’s eyes met Ron’s staring back, with her shrewd guess to the state beneath the sheets, which wouldn’t be a surprise as she had seen Rita Skeeter’s photograph, the one that had caught Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Gia all skinny dipping in a hot tub.</p>
<p>“Twat—” Ron started.</p>
<p>“Dickhead—” Ginny replied.</p>
<p>Hermione snorted, twitched, and rolled over; her hand had caught the sheet enough to pull it off of Ron.  Ginny’s eyes fell down to her brother’s display of sexual prowess; first at his scrotum covered testicles, then up the ridge of the shaft partially blocking the pubic hair up to where his foreskin met the slit of his glans supporting a small bead of clear liquid, a bit that wasn’t ever quite covered.  A grin spread across Ginny’s face.</p>
<p>“Bug off—no butchers—” Ron said.</p>
<p>“Dishy bollocks—” Ginny’s eyes darted at Harry’s loose todger before they returned to Ron.</p>
<p>“Not of your concern,” Ron said, “Scram—” He threw some old stained boxers at Ginny.</p>
<p>“Banging bobby!”  Ginny dashed in, tripped to the floor, stared from inches away at Harry’s stiffening penis, the erection springing out fast.</p>
<p>“You’ll pay!” Ron threatened, “We’re trying to sleep—fuck off you gormy—”</p>
<p>“It’s time to—” In a quick action, Ginny  snapped her towel, hitting Ron in the bollocks.</p>
<p>“Ow!” A quick recoil, then Ron sprang up, holding his bruised bollocks under his stiffy, darted as fast as he could after Ginny. “Beastly arse—you’re dead!”Ron used his hands against the walls, leapt stairs after stairs, his hard dick swaying, as he chased Ginny.</p>
<p>“He’s coming!” Ginny shouted.</p>
<p>“What—?!” Ron stammered as he came out into the living room.</p>
<p><span class="sound">Click!</span>
</p>
<p>Despite the floating spot from the bright flash of light, the entire room came into focus faster than Ron could respond.</p>
<p>“I was hoping for Harry,” Colin said, his camera sank down from his bare chest toward the elastic of his white briefs.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall, who was just talking to Arthur Weasley in his pin strip suit, turned toward Ron.  Her wits fought to balance etiquette with curiosity,the wits surrendered for a short moment as the brilliant fluffy golden rod pubic hair ensnared her instincts to examine the fully primed teenager, whose erection jutted outward and exposed the soft pink glans with its characteristic slit.  After a quick study of the faithful wingmen dangling loose underneath, her wits reconquered and her eyes rapidly moved up the pubic trail to the naval, across the bare chest to face blushing with embarrassment and trembling brilliant blue eyes.</p>
<p>“Showing your talent off?” Fred whispered at Ron.</p>
<p>While everybody else focused upon Ron and his rock hard erection on display, Ron spotted Fred parting the front of the bathrobe.  Only the right side, with only a fringe of pubic hair showing, only enough for the wand tip beside the hip to be clearly aimed at Ron.  Fred muttered and Ron felt the tremor in his shaft.  Colin’s camera snapped back up to the face, aimed as the relaxing spasms and urges traveled through Ron’s shank of flesh.  An eternity passed for Ron, but fast enough to be paralyzed from any recourse as he felt his boyish magma swell and surge along his column as it raced for the tip.</p>
<p><span class="sound">Click!</span>
</p>
<p>The lava passed the exit.</p>
<p><span class="sound">Click!</span>
</p>
<p>The camera kept taking pictures as the orgasm kept up, his pearly white juice squirted out from the magical pressure.</p>
<p><span class="sound">Click!</span>
</p>
<p>Encouraged to go the distance, the first and long shot of semen leapt the yard and half needed to cling on the billowing green robes of McGonagall.</p>
<p><span class="sound">Click!</span>
</p>
<p>Quivering continued, albeit with less force, and his ejaculation flowed.</p>
<p><span class="sound">Click!</span>
</p>
<p>The second surge traveled a foot.</p>
<p><span class="sound">Click!</span>
</p>
<p>While the magic was forcing every bit of sperm out, every bit of sperm to parade in the show, the force decreased and the stream of semen tapered off to become a stream that dribbled out of, and waterfall off of, his slit.  His scrotum contracted slightly to reveal a softer and more intricate skin.</p>
<p><span class="sound">Click!</span>
</p>
<p>Gryffindor courtesy finally hinted to Professor McGonagall to distract the attention away for her embattled student.</p>
<p>“The Hogwarts Board of Governors has elected to reward your efforts in freeing the school at the end of last term, please extend their gratitude to your friends,” Professor McGonagall said, “I have given your father the details of their generosity. I will look forward to seeing you in the fall.”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall turned around and went out the door.</p>
<p>“Oh,” George said, “She’ll definitely look forward to seeing you after this display—”</p>
<p>George, wearing only a sweat soaked Weird Sisters T–shirt that was too small to hide anything besides his naval, gripped his flaccid penis.</p>
<p>“Whatever’s left,” Ginny said, grinning.</p>
<p>Ron turned around for the stairs.</p>
<p>“Get his ass!” Ginny said.</p>
<p>Ron, with a bit still dribbling to contribute to the long strand off his softening dick, ran for the stairs, the pendulum swung.</p>
<p><span class="sound">Click!</span>
</p>
<p>“Ginevra—” Arthur said.</p>
<p>“Family photographs,” Ginny said with a fake tone of innocence.</p>
<p>Ron climbed the stairs.  He couldn’t believe it, ready to bang and spewing in front of Professor McGonagall, of all people!  With the thoughts of that and that camera, Ron reentered his bedroom, closed the door, and slid down it. He glanced around at the friendly faces.  First it was Hermione, with her busy brown hair, her brown blinking eyes, her knockers, the firm midriff, and the hair covered folds around her vagina denoting her femininity. Then Gia, with her blond hair and blue eyes, her voluptuous knockers that ensnared his other friend.   Finally, Harry, the scrawny figure whose skin was too tight for his bones, with the green eyes looking back at Ron.  All three returned the glances, kept their eyes on him, as he sat on his arse, back against the door, knees in the air and spread, his dick hung against the scrotum, the flap resting at the base of his crotch.</p>
<p>“Exciting—” Harry muttered.</p>
<p>“Shove it,” Ron snapped.  “That git…”</p>
<p>Ron glanced at the cracks of the floorboard, the ones that could occasionally show Ginny in the light he’d rather not see, when a quick thought came through his head.  Nobody in the room missed out as he let a short burst of liquid dribble out of his dick.</p>
<p>“Ron—” Hermione started.</p>
<p>“It’s his room,” Harry said, seeing the green tinge in his friend’s face.</p>
<p>With that, Ron’s morning rush started, the pee hit the floorboards, the liquid drained through the cracks.</p>
<p>“You ran after her like that,” Hermione said, “What’d you expect—”</p>
<p>“Cameras? Fred or George? McGonagall? Dad?” Ron said as his loose penis spurted and squirted out more piss, “Can’t believe—”</p>
<p>“I’d like a copy of those snaps,” Hermione said as she sat next to Ron, she cupped his scrotum.</p>
<p>“What—?!” Ron exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Wank for them—” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“He already did,” Hermione said as she felt Ron’s bollocks.</p>
<p>“You camp,” Ron snapped.</p>
<p>“Likely thinking about McGonagall—” Harry said.</p>
<p>Ron snorted. “No way! She was appreciative about our last adventure.” Elbows to the knees, he looked down. “Mum won’t find out, she can’t—”</p>
<p>“Being dead…” Harry started, he stopped, figuring it wasn’t good to talk about the recently deceased Mrs. Weasley.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Ron glared at Harry before the eyes got caught up in watching as leopard spots formed and danced on Harry’s skin.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” Gia said, “I could dig this.”</p>
<p>“Went on the pull ‘arry and—” Ron said.</p>
<p>“Watch it,” Hermione said, “She’s my friend too, so don’t demean Harry’s girlfriend—”</p>
<p>“Or what—” Ron demanded.</p>
<p>“Hey shirty,” Gia said, “Hermione’ll likely stop being yours. Swot your stuff if you need to understand what you’d be wanking solo.”</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Ron said, “Like always, Mr. and Mrs. Founders of your stupid unofficial fan club wanted your signed starkers photograph along with your perspective on shagging—that twerp diddled her boyfriend onto me!”</p>
<p>Ron blew off.</p>
<p>“We do need to get moving.” Gia grabbed Harry’s bum.</p>
<p>Harry groaned and got up. Gia sat up.</p>
<p>“One at a time for the khazi,” Ron said.</p>
<p>“That’s your Mum’s—” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“She may be dead,” Ron said, “but this is still her house—we need to abide.”</p>
<p>“Never cared before—” Harry said.</p>
<p>“I do now,” Ron stated.</p>
<p>Harry gave Gia a nudge; she grabbed a towel, waited for Ron to move aside, and went out.  Ron pushed to get up.</p>
<p>“They’re already—” Hermione started.</p>
<p>“It’s going to blow—” Ron said as he gripped his buttocks.</p>
<p>“You expect the khazi—”</p>
<p>“Rather I do it in here?” Ron stated.</p>
<p>Hermione kept the door open, though her eyes drifted and she watched through the floorboards as Ron started to sit on one of Ginny’s cauldrons.</p>
<p>‘Immature!’  Hermione shook her head as the first of Ron’s bowel movements landed.  ‘As private as Waterloo!’</p>
<p>Up the stairs came George, with his soaked white Weird Sisters T–shirt, he paused at the landing and saw Hermione looking back through the cracked door.</p>
<p>“May I?” George asked.</p>
<p>“Losing cause for any—” Hermione opened the door.</p>
<p>“Privacy is an illusion,” George said as he entered.  He closed the door and looked down at Hermione, his genitals hung right in front of her until he stepped back and leaned against the dresser.  He crossed his legs, where his T–shirt still failed to even hide the naval, and adjusted his scrotum.</p>
<p>“Ron and Harry—” Hermione warned from her sitting position.</p>
<p>George snorted and finger–combed his red pubic hair.</p>
<p>“Although we joke about it,” George said, “You’re family—any Weasley lying causes the penis to go blue —”</p>
<p>Hermione snorted.</p>
<p>“It’s true—it’s much harder to lie with the dick exposed,” George said, “As you can tell, it’s definitely not a foot long.”</p>
<p>Hermione laughed as George pulled a ruler alongside his penis, showed it to be less than three inches; his loose scrotum allowed his bollocks to dangle at four.</p>
<p>“Anyways, I was hoping to apologize to Ronald, we did sort of go overboard—”</p>
<p>“Did Professor McGonagall—”</p>
<p>George nodded.  “Full discharge with a sample.”</p>
<p>“No wonder Ron’s—”</p>
<p>“Not that it wasn’t hilarious to watch,” George said, “Ginny figured you sleeping starkers and wanted to lure Harry for a picture—I think she still has a crush—Ron came instead and Fred—need I say more?”</p>
<p>Hermione laughed.</p>
<p>George turned for the door and cracked it open; but then turned around.</p>
<p>“Oh—it is clothing optional,” George said.</p>
<p>“Oh really?” Hermione replied, not believing that Mrs. Weasley would have tolerated this.</p>
<p>“Mum didn’t object to Fred’s declaration this morning—”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>George took a glance at Hermione’s nipples and his snake started to slither upward.</p>
<p>“You are a beautiful witch—” George tumbled backward down the stairs.</p>
<p>“You…?!” Ron gave George a shove to assist the tumble; he closed the door.</p>
<p>“Ron!” Hermione scolded.</p>
<p>“Lemme see.”  Ron rested his chin on the fist he raised to it.  “Compliments while his todger—”</p>
<p>“He was explaining—” Hermione said as she stood.</p>
<p>“Really?!”  Ron leaned on the ledge in front of the window, the garden gnomes studied the dick.  “He’s fed other girls the same codswallop.”</p>
<p>“He wasn’t coming on—” Hermione wrapped her arms from behind him.</p>
<p>“He’s good,” Ron said, “I’m not letting him assault you—you’re better than that.”</p>
<p>“He mentioned clothing optional—”</p>
<p>“Mum couldn’t afford—I mean wasn’t fond of cooling charms,” Ron said, “On hot days, she tolerated—I mean let us be a bit free spirited—”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione said as her hands combed Ron’s pubic hair.</p>
<p>“Malfoy’s right, too many mouths to feed,” Ron said.</p>
<p>“You’re listening to him?” Hermione asked as her fingers twiddled his dangling todger, “Took your time earlier—”</p>
<p>“Whatever Fred’s charm was—” Ron smiled.  “Let’s just say it was effective, best dump ever.”</p>
<p>Hermione pumped on the dick as it started firming up under the sunshine of the window.</p>
<p>“Fred knew his curse,” Ron said, “It’s a bit dry—”</p>
<p>“Pity.”  Hermione let go of his column.</p>
<p>“Penises only get one shot at a time.”  Harry finished entering, Gia behind him.  “Though a second attempt is welcome.”</p>
<p>Hermione snorted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ginny laid where she always laid after being yelled at, on the landing of the stairs, the one right above the ceiling of the living room, behind the plant that her knickers and panties where strewn onto.  Conversations she was not supposed to hear had a knack of softening up the hardness of the pathetically carpeted wood.  However, the juice had already dried up when the loitering paid off.  For steps came down the stairs and she looked up, she caught a better look at the youth than she had in years — she had occasionally seen Harry come down in briefs, but this time he had outdone himself.</p>
<p>Unable to wick the heat away fast enough, Harry had dressed lighter than lightly, very light—stark naked.  Ginny quickly and quietly slipped her finger to press in between the folds of her labia; she pressed and activated the magic finger vibrator, a gift from Fred—a field test for a new gadget, that she had kept there.  Slit in view, Harry’s loose dick came downward with his steps, he walked through her fantasies.  Ron came down, fast, zoomed past Harry, which let Ginny get a good view of Harry’s bum with the backside of his scrotum dangling loosely underneath.  If it were not for the vibrator’s silencing charm, her moans from her orgasm would have been heard.</p>
<p>Downstairs, the kitchen table was already prepared much earlier; however, the food was being kept warm, by Dobby, who was on loan for that summer, for Professor Dumbledore thought it would help the Weasley family cope with the sudden and tragic loss of their matriarch, Molly Weasley, several weeks earlier.</p>
<p>Charlie was already sitting at the long table, no plate in front of him; instead, he was reading <span class="emtitle">Students Rid Hogwarts of Dark Squatters</span>
 in the prior day’s <span class="emtitle">Daily Prophet</span>
 that was up in his hands.  Fred was hunched over the sink, his hands were busy, when Harry and Ron came into the kitchen.  Charlie glanced over the paper’s edge at the naked wizards as neither Ron nor Harry had bothered to dress.  Charlie was appreciative of his habit that he was wearing boxers, out of habit in the Burrow, as it helped shield his growing sausage; he put the paper down toward his lap, to help conceal the growth beneath the cloth.</p>
<p>Bottle green eyes scanned the paper, not noticing Charlie’s surveying him back.  Charlie studied the loose and long penis dangling just across the table, a penis that was freshly urinated with its uncut tip and a slight rightward bent, the left testicle dangling loose and lower than the right, all free beneath the thick, dark, black pubic hair that had been kept trimmed under Gia’s watch.  Charlie felt the dry orgasm in his own erection, understood the excitement as he tried to memorize the vein pattern in Harry’s foreskin.</p>
<p>“At least you’ll be able to properly floss with your curly—” Fred said to Ron, as he pulled on his pubics.</p>
<p>“Shove it,” Ron said, “Like you’re up to anything good—”</p>
<p>“I don’t hear Mum complaining,” Fred said.</p>
<p>Harry snorted as he sat down, bollocks dangling off the edge of the chair.</p>
<p>“That’s because she can’t,” Charlie said.</p>
<p>“Dickhead had something to do—” Fred said.</p>
<p>“It’s not his fault,” Charlie said, “Impressive what they accomplished, single handedly vanquishing You–Know–Who and lot from Hogwarts—”</p>
<p>“Where’s George?” Ron asked.</p>
<p>“Getting ready to prank your room,” Fred said, smiling as he visibly massaged his dick into an erection.</p>
<p>Ron glared.</p>
<p>“Pass the syrup,” Harry said.</p>
<p>It flew down the table into Harry’s hand.</p>
<p>“Dobby happy to serve Harry Potter. Dobby hopes Harry Potter is pleased with meal.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Ta,” Harry said.</p>
<p>Dobby vanished.</p>
<p>“Mum dies and you take off—” Ginny exclaimed, coming into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Harry glanced up from his food; the girl was standing on her tippy toes, while glaring at Ron, but ensuring that her freshly shaved and waxed labia was slightly parted, giving Harry a closeup view.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you done enough—?!” Ron demanded.</p>
<p>“Family comes—” Ginny said.</p>
<p>“Shove it!” Ron snapped.</p>
<p>Harry took a second look at Ginny’s partition between her folds; inside, he could see the magical vibrator.  Her smile, when she looked at him, hinted that the vibrator was active.</p>
<p>“Ronald Weasley,” Arthur said, coming into the kitchen, “Mind your manners!”</p>
<p>Ginny crossed her arms, her ears went green, her face went red.   She glared at Ron, ignoring his exposure.</p>
<p>“This is family,” Arthur said, “However, if Ron wishes to spend his summer like this, that’s his decision to make.”</p>
<p>“You have to excuse her Ron,” Fred said as he motioned a masturbatory stroke of his dick, “She wanted more pictures—”</p>
<p>“Definitely not!” Ron exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Stay safe on the trip,” Arthur said, “All of you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Mr. Weasley,” Harry said.</p>
<p>Arthur Weasley returned to the living room, where he was keeping an eye on Edward Weasley, the latest addition, born to Molly and Arthur back in April. In the meanwhile, Fred took a quick step back from the sink.</p>
<p>“Trouble?” Ginny asked.</p>
<p>“See for yourself,” Fred said, grinning.</p>
<p>Ginny turned on the tap, and then fell. Out of the faucet, instead of water, streams of butterflies came out, swarming and filling up the room.</p>
<p>“Hello Mr. Finnigan,” came Arthur’s voice, “Come on in.”</p>
<p>Harry and Ron looked to see Seamus Finnigan coming through the door.  Seamus was wearing a loose yellow T–shirt that billowed over the tight pair of red briefs.  Seamus glanced at the red and the black sets of pubic hair.</p>
<p>“Late morning, eh?” Seamus said, looming over the table.</p>
<p>“Why should they stress themselves out?” Ginny said as she left the room.</p>
<p>“Happy couple,” Seamus said, his eyes followed Colin and Ginny climbing the stairs.</p>
<p>“Especially when they’re ambushing others,” Ron said.</p>
<p>Seamus snorted and glanced about.</p>
<p>“There is plenty of room,” Charlie said as he studied the crotch bulge of Seamus’ briefs, “And even more outside.”</p>
<p>“I’m already hot,” Seamus said.</p>
<p>Harry grabbed his cup of water, stood next to Seamus.  Seamus fidgeted for a moment before he reached his arms over and pulled off his shirt.</p>
<p>“Better?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Mind?” Seamus tugged at the hem of his briefs.</p>
<p>“You’re asking me?” Charlie said, “Do mind the heat though.”</p>
<p>Harry, however, had already gripped the fabric.</p>
<p>“Unless you visited just to whine about the heat—” Charlie started.</p>
<p>“Alright.”  Seamus dropped his briefs, blushed as his dick was now exposed.</p>
<p>“Now that the <span class="emtitle">Daily Prophet</span>
 caught your backside—” Seamus said as they left the Burrow.</p>
<p>Ron snorted.</p>
<p>“Any advice for us poorer bastards?” Seamus said, “Dean is absolutely livid.  Suppose Professor McGonagall came to see you about OWLs—”</p>
<p>“She saw a bit more—” Harry said, his hand pulled on his dick.</p>
<p>“Shut it!” Ron said, “I’ll kill—”</p>
<p>“How does Hermione like your double dating—” Seamus asked.</p>
<p>“We already have full OWLs—” Ron said.</p>
<p>“What—?!” Seamus exclaimed.</p>
<p>“We tested after the little affair…” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Bit campy—” Seamus said, doing a slow stroke of his erection.</p>
<p>Ron tackled Seamus, both falling into the mud of the pond.</p>
<p>“Sto—” Harry started.</p>
<p>Seamus grabbed Harry’s ankle, Harry fell in onto them.  Harry peed across Seamus’ chest.  Ron mudded up Harry’s butt crack.</p>
<p>“Trying a return?” Seamus asked.</p>
<p>“Payback,” Harry said as he muddied up Seamus’ genitals, covering them.  A circumcised erection slithered out, escaping the mud, leaving Seamus hard.</p>
<p>“Hold him,” Ron said, squatting over Seamus’ face.</p>
<p>“No, no!” Seamus exclaimed as sludge moved out of Ron’s ass, pooping.</p>
<p>“He likes it,” Harry said, massaging the fulcrum of Seamus’ cock.</p>
<p>“No I don’t,” Seamus said as his dick sputtered out its first volley, the white of the orgasm, spewing out semen.</p>
<p>“Yes he does,” Ron said.</p>
<p>“Disgusting,” Seamus said, “Harry’s next!”</p>
<p>Ron moved, pinned Harry to the ground as Seamus bared the anus.  They kept doing their ones and twos, until they were covered in mud and sitting in the green muck on the shore of the pond.  A bit later, after even more talking, Seamus stood.</p>
<p>“I would’ve loved to see Snape’s face with your Order of Merlin, First Class,” Seamus said. He then left.</p>
<p>Harry and Ron returned to the Burrow, where Gia met them both with a hose.</p><hr/>
<p></p><div class="scene"></div><p>Noigate<sup>3</sup> was a community south of London, where Hermione’s parents lived, where she called home during her days away from Hogwarts.    Inside one of these homes, the four teenagers, two at a time, stepped out of a fireplace, into the living room.  Harry and Gia went up the stairs, came back down a few moments later.  </p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes at the sight of Harry.  Harry had an open mesh white tank top, leaving his hairy arm pits exposed, and a band of skin where it failed to meet his yellow open mesh jockstrap, the contours and general shades of his genitals were showing.  Gia had the smallest of bikinis, quarter sized sand dollars covered the nipples, conformal strip of cloth hinted strongly at the erect clitoris beneath, while managing to keep the exact colors as a mystery.   Sandals were on both pairs of feet.</p>
<p>“Going out like that?” Hermione asked.</p>
<p>“Like these are any more comfortable,” Harry said, “It’s still icky!”</p>
<p>“Need to see my Dad,” Gia said, “We’ll be back some time later.”</p>
<p>Harry and Gia left Hermione’s house, and walked.  They passed through a number of neighborhoods, going through parks, over streams, along the paths, to cross the odd street here and there.</p>
<p>Some noticed their mesh clothes.</p>
<p>“You’re practically starkers,” Gia said, giggling after she glanced at Harry through a polished motorcar bumper.</p>
<p>Both knew it, both lying to each other that their garments left more to the imagination than they did.  Harry’s jockstrap mesh merely suspended his genitals, his black pubic hair, the scrotum, and the dick laying to the side were plainly visible, even the tip to his foreskin could readily be seen as bits were already pushing through; his butt crack visible to all behind him.  Gia’s two piece green mesh bikini was just as suggestive, nipples showing, the gap as her vagina was torqued partially open.</p>
<p>“Wish you were,” Harry said, his penis partially aroused, it moved a bit beneath the mesh.</p>
<p>They turned onto James Lane, the street of Gia’s family residence.  Only, there was no real house on the lot, the house that her father, Kevin Prescott, had inherited from her grandfather, as they could not have afforded that detached home otherwise.  Now, though, the house was missing, even as the birds among the trees did not know the difference.  For the house had been demolished, destroyed, by Death Eaters several months earlier.  In its place was a small RV parked in the driveway.</p>
<p>“What the—?!” Gia exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Hi Gia,” said a jogging man as he approached and came to a stop.</p>
<p>This man was Bob Johnson, the neighbor across the street. The remaining wisps of his hair were combed over attempting to masquerade his near baldness.</p>
<p>“Thought Dad was crashing at your—” Gia said.</p>
<p>“Had to kick him out,” Bob said, “Another relapse—it endangers us.”</p>
<p>Gia rolled her eyes. She had seen her father kick his drug habit off and on through the years. To her, he would drink on occasion, that had been forever, but the pot and beyond, those started with the death of her mother so many years ago.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome though,” Bob said.</p>
<p>“Going on a trip for the summer,” Gia said, “Might take you up come school.”</p>
<p>With a glance at the threat of an erection in Harry’s yellow mesh jock strap, Bob just grinned before he resumed jogging onto another lap.</p>
<p>“Brace yourself, Harry,” Gia said.</p>
<p>Harry and Gia approached the shaking RV.  She knew this meant Dad was drunk after getting fired for the umpteenth time, it wouldn’t have been the first time.  Gia reached for the door, but it swung hard and fast, just missing her.  In the doorway was Gia’s step–mum, Ane, shaking with a bottle in one hand and a cigarette in the other, she glared fiercely at Gia.  Harry stepped in front of Gia, attempting to shield, as Ane flicked a burning ember at Gia.  The ember melted the left strap of his mesh tank top, falling enough to leave his nipple exposed.</p>
<p>“Blimey! Another whore?!” Ane shouted, “You stink! Fucking accident! Think your Mum even wanted you? Old man wants a bang—”</p>
<p>Ane stumbled, lunged for Gia.  Harry reacted, moved Gia as he replaced her spot, moving her to the side.  Ane grabbed at Harry as she fell, her fingernails snagged his shirt first, pulling it down, and his jockstrap, sending the garments to the ground as she hit the pavement, leaving him naked.</p>
<p>“Fucking John!” Ane said, “He’s saving you for himself! What’d he offer? Place in the beggar queue?”</p>
<p>At first, Gia’s attention was drawn into the RV, where her Dad was busy banging some young meat.  As Harry turned, he stepped on a discarded needle, breaking it; his hand gripped Gia’s shoulder, turned her away.</p>
<p>“You don’t deserve that,” Harry said, “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Can we see Richard first?” Gia asked.</p>
<p>Harry reached down, grabbed his clothes, and used them as a shield in front of him.</p>
<p>“Um…” Harry muttered as they left.</p>
<p>“Just avoid a copper,” Gia said.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Harry muttered.</p>
<p>“If you weren’t comfortable—” Gia started.</p>
<p>“Giving it a try,” Harry said, “Dunno…exhilarating but a bit of nerves.”</p>
<p>“Shy?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“Silly?”</p>
<p>Harry snorted.</p>
<p>“You could put those back on,” Gia said.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head as they came to a park.  Despite there being some other younger kids there, they went in; stood next to a double wide swing.</p>
<p>“Why bother hiding?”</p>
<p>Both Harry and Gia turned, where one of her classmates was standing.  Richard was bare chested with blue plain boxer shorts.</p>
<p>“Um—” Harry stuttered.</p>
<p>“Like these did anything,” Gia said, grabbing the clothes in Harry’s hands, she pulled them away and dropped them.</p>
<p>“If we’re insisting,” Harry said, reaching for her bikini top.</p>
<p>Gia simply smiled as Harry pulled the little bits away from her, leaving her standing naked.  Harry blushed as his dick swelled, stiffening, into the hard erection facing her.</p>
<p>“You’re cute and handsome,” Gia said.</p>
<p>“Going domestic?” Richard asked.</p>
<p>“Let’s shout out that I’ve got a tent pole!” Harry snapped as he sat on the swing.</p>
<p>Eyes followed Harry, trained on him.</p>
<p>“Health and safety would likely give you an on–the–spot penalty for overdressing,” Richard said.</p>
<p>Gia snorted as she sat on Harry’s left, on the double wide swing.</p>
<p>“Besides I thought you enjoyed—” Richard said.</p>
<p>“Hiking—” Harry said as he started to pump the swing, “It wasn’t a show.”  Harry referred to a bit of nude hiking that he and Gia had experimented with the past spring.</p>
<p>Harry kept both hands on the rope.  Gia leaned into his left arm, her left gripped the rope while her right started to massage the dick.</p>
<p>“You do remember who my Mum is?  The Chief Constable around here?” Richard said, “I overheard her, as it’s too hot, they’re not going to bother about being…skimpy.  They’d rather not have the heat–related calls.  Don’t know how far—”</p>
<p>“Umm…”  Harry then realized that he had slowed down on the swing and a small crowd had formed, all watching as Gia stroked.  Harry hadn’t intended to demonstrate, but his todger had other plans.  He felt the surge as the eyes studied his shaft and loose scrotum, a scrotum that was freely hanging his balls over the edge of the seat, balls that condensed in preparation.   Grins were shown as the first shot flew forth, Harry’s orgasm launched the pearly white liquid into the air.  Gia kept her strokes as the liquid came out of his spring, the bead flowed out of his slit, cascaded down the groove, and waterfalled off the fulcrum on the underside.  The sand beneath them worked to absorb the evidence.  A copper, patrolling the playground in the distance, ignored the display and kept on moving.</p>
<p>“I suppose you have to rape somebody,” Richard said, “Until then—”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Harry stated, dryly.</p>
<p>Richard pulled his boxers back up as they started to drop.  Harry’s own dick reasserted itself, the glans soaked in the semen.</p>
<p>“I have to use—” Gia started.</p>
<p>“Can I watch?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Um…” Gia said, “I meant—”</p>
<p>Harry’s hand dropped to her shaved pubic and he felt into her vulva.  His erection returned.</p>
<p>“Harry…” Gia muttered.</p>
<p>“Just relax, alright?”  Harry parted her folds.  “Just relax.”</p>
<p>Gia calmed a bit and a stream came out, from a trickle to a jet.  Richard blushed a deep red as his firm flesh poked out of the front of the boxers, instincts overriding the sense of honor.  Harry ran his left hand into the golden trail, guiding the backwash onto himself.</p>
<p>“That’s disgusting,” Richard said.</p>
<p>“Fair play,” Gia said, “Besides, it interested you too.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Harry muttered.</p>
<p>“My place?” Richard asked.</p>
<p>Harry and Gia followed.</p>
<p>“Going to move on Jen?” Gia asked, “Have you asked?”</p>
<p>“Maybe…soon,” Richard said, taking the bait, “Still need to ask.”</p>
<p>“Ask her,” Gia said, “Ask before some other guy takes her.”</p>
<p>“Care for another hike this weekend?” Richard asked.</p>
<p>“We’ve got…plans,” Gia said.</p>
<p>“Bring Jen,” Harry suggested.</p>
<p>“What plans?” Richard asked.</p>
<p>“A trip, leaving for Europe tomorrow,” Gia said.</p>
<p>“Done with the packing?” Richard asked.</p>
<p>“Not quite,” Gia said.</p>
<p>“Pack in the morning,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Let’s get back,” Gia replied.</p>
<p>Harry sighed, they turned, went back for Hermione’s.</p><hr/>
<p></p><div class="scene"></div><p>It was late when Harry slipped into the bathtub in the upstairs bathroom; lavender from the burning candle on the shelf filled the room.  Harry laid back in the tub, laid below the bubbles.   It was slightly childish, but made Harry feel better as he soaked in the water.  Gia came in, closed the door.  Even without his glasses, Harry could make out her blonde hair.</p>
<p>“Could’ve done the hot tub,” Gia said.</p>
<p>“Thought it was going to be a shower,” Harry said, “Changed my mind.”</p>
<p>Gia brought over a small tray of bottles, set it on the edge of the tub.</p>
<p>“Well, this’ll make you tougher to spot,” Gia said, “It’d be a whole different you.”</p>
<p>“Is that what I think it is?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“You’re supposed to have black hair,” Gia said, “This’ll stop that, besides, I want to see it on you, please?  Pretty please.”</p>
<p>“I guess,” Harry said.</p>
<p>Gia pulled the plug, the water began to drain.</p>
<p>“It’ll take time to reheat,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“According to the directions, it can start out wet,” Gia said, “But, it’ll wash out if you’re in the water.”</p>
<p>Gia grabbed a brush from the first bottle, began to apply it to Harry’s hair, the blackness of it started to leach out.</p><hr/>
<p><sup>1</sup> Harry’s and Gia’s relationship was solidified in the prequel; she’s a muggle and a childhood friend of Hermione’s.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> This is pre–ootp, remember?  At the time, there was a rumor, and Mrs. Weasley was my guess to the fan who died.  Even though OotP has been released, I’m sticking with Mrs. Weasley for this story, so Sirius is currently alive.<br/>
<sup>3</sup> Canon, through HBP, simply describe Hermione as living in a suburb south of London, so I fabricated a name, Noigate, for it, and it’ll remain so for the purposes of this story.<br/>
