          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was a nice day, really.</p>
<p>Mid April, some sun, and barely any wind, something incredibly rare for London.</p>
<p>Rose was sitting in a bustling cafe, trying to organize her plans for the day.</p>
<p>
  <em> I need some more parchment, and I’m out of soap. I need owl feed. Maybe some robes while I’m here? I don’t need them but really, it’s time. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Detergent? Are we out? Why can’t Al ever handle any of this? </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Maybe some clothing? I am in muggle London right now, so I could do both. Probably do it first, so I don’t have to carry it. </em>
</p>
<p>She sat, soaking up the rare bit of sun coming through the windows and sipping a rapidly cooling latte.</p>
<p>
  <em> Damn, I’m homesick. Or maybe I miss Hogwarts? Should I sleep at home this weekend? </em>
</p>
<p>The bell dings, and someone walks in. Rose, looking through the window, used to the noise of the place, doesn’t notice.</p>
<p>She does when he drops into the chair across from her little table, though. </p>
<p>“Weasley, fancy seeing you here.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy! Oh god, hi.” She quickly snaps her head in his direction. “Wow it’s been so long. We graduated, what, a year ago?” </p>
<p>“Almost, yeah. How’ve you been?”</p>
<p>“Oh you know, pretty good. Work’s been decent, Al’s not the worst roommate in the world…”</p>
<p><em> He’s a good listener </em> , she remembers. <em> It’s nice to catch up again.  </em></p>
<p>And on the day passes, two friends chatting in a cafe in London.</p></div>
