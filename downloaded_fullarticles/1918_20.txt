    <p>Harry wanted to get away. He truly did. Inside his head, he was struggling, screaming, clawing at everything he could reach. But his body, his treacherous body lay still and allowed the horror to happen to him.</p><p>All Harry had wanted to do was to help someone less fortunate. Just like Hermione had always wanted him to.</p><p>"Hush, sweetheart," said the man as he slowly undid Harry's buttons. Harry was overcome with this overwhelming need to shut up. He could no longer even whimper. All he could do was cry silently.</p><p>"I don't like that look in your eye," said the man. "Smile for me, Harry." <em>No,</em> thought Harry. But again, his body didn't listen. His lips pulled up in a small smile. "Wider." And wider, Harry smiled. The man patted him on his cheek, praising him for being a good boy.</p><p>He was tall, this monster. And handsome. Very, very handsome. He shouldn't even need to do this. He could probably stand in a crowded street and ask who wanted to fuck him and twenty people would come up. Harry didn't even know his name. Why had this bastard been blessed with a permanent magick?</p><p>"Please stop," begged Harry as he was divested of his underwear.</p><p>"I told you to hush," said the man. "The only thing you should be saying is my name: Voldemort."</p><p>"Voldemort," said Harry, trying to convey just how much he did not want this. but Voldemort either did not understand or simply did not care. He rucked up Harry's shirt and pulled off his own robes. He wore only underwear beneath it and that was quickly gone, leaving Harry with an unobstructed view of his large, erect cock. It was huge. It wouldn't fit.</p><p>"We'll have to throw away that muggle crap, won't we?" said Voldemort. Because he didn't ask, Harry knew instantly. Voldemort never asked for anything and Harry nodded at his demand, unable to do anything else.</p><p>"Spread your legs, sweet," said Voldemort. "And enjoy it, yes?" How exactly was Harry supposed to enjoy any of this? Harry spread his legs and Voldemort immediately slotted himself between them. The monster muttered a spell which led to slick fingers finding Harry's hole, probing at it and slowly entering it.</p><p>To his utter horror, Harry realised that he <em>was</em> beginning to enjoy it. His own cock stirred in interest. It did not go unnoticed as Voldemort inserted another finger, smirking at Harry.</p><p>"Feels good, doesn't it?" said Voldemort. "Don't be so shocked. I <em>did </em>tell you to enjoy it." The terrifying realisation dawned on Harry that Voldemort could control how he bloody well felt.</p><p>Two fingers were followed by a third as Voldemort kept stretching Harry open. Harry gasped and moaned, pleasure coiling low in his belly. He didn't want this. He <em>didn't</em> feel good! He was being <em>raped </em>for Merlin's sake!</p><p>But his body refused to listen. His body liked what Voldemort was doing. The pain didn't matter. The humiliation didn't matter. The fact that Harry didn't <em>want</em> it, didn't matter. All that mattered was that Voldemort wanted him to want it.</p><p>Finally, after a while of stretching and moving his fingers inside Harry, Voldemort pulled them out. Involuntarily, Harry let out a whine which earned him a pleased pat on the thigh.</p><p>"No worries, love," said Voldemort. "I'll give you what you need. Just ask for it." He smiled, waiting patiently as Harry struggled to answer.</p><p>"I <em>need </em>you to go away," begged Harry. "Leave me and <em>never</em> come back!" Voldemort's face darkened at that. Harry flinched, expecting violence, expecting to be hit. A lifetime of living with the Dursleys had brought him up to expect that whenever he talked back.</p><p>But Voldemort wasn't Vernon Dursley. He did not slap Harry. He did not punch, did not bite, did not scream. He did much worse.</p><p>"No, Harry," said Voldemort. "You don't need me to go away. You need me to stay. You love me, remember?"</p><p>And helplessly, Harry began to feel something other than hate for this monster.</p><p align="center"><br/>

<strong>Months Later</strong>
</p><p><br/>
“You love me, don't you, Harry?" whispered Voldemort. They were curled up in bed, together as they had been since Voldemort had taken Harry for himself. Harry shivered as Voldemort trailed his fingers up his exposed thigh. Goosebumps erupted in their wake.</p><p>"I love you," said Harry and, in that moment, to his great regret, it was true. Harry did love Voldemort. He loved Voldemort with the entirety of his heart. He would die for this man. He would die if Voldemort ever left him. That was how Harry felt in this moment.</p><p>But Harry had timed it carefully and, in just a few more minutes, it would be twelve hours since Voldemort had last told Harry to love him. In a few more minutes, the effect of Voldemort’s magick would wear off and Harry might be free. He held his breath, hoping against hope, that Voldemort would forget to reiterate his command.</p><p>"I love you, too," said Voldemort, causing Harry's traitorous heart to skip a beat. He kissed Voldemort, rewarding him for the sweet words. Voldemort kissed back, eagerly. He pulled Harry’s thigh to wrap it around his own hip so they were so much closer together. “Merlin, I love you. Harry, I <em>love</em> you.” Harry didn’t answer. He brushed Voldemort’s fringe from his face, smoothing the curls gently. Just a few more moments. Just a bit more and Harry would hate the man again, would want to break his jaw again.</p><p>But, a minute before the twelve hours were over, Voldemort's wand vibrated and Voldemort smirked wide and cruel.</p><p>"Poor baby," chuckled Voldemort. He nuzzled Harry’s stricken expression. "You almost had it. It was so close, wasn’t it, darling? Hmm. You know what to do, my heart. Love me Harry, dear."</p><p>"No!" cried Harry. The tears began to fall, unbidden, as Voldemort's hold on his heart strengthened all over again. Voldemort cooed and brought Harry into his arms, soothing him through his sobs. Harry screamed and screamed. He tried to hit Voldemort, tried to push him away. But he was unable to use his full strength. He couldn’t risk hurting the man he loved. He couldn’t hurt Voldemort.</p><p>"What exactly are you trying to accomplish, love?" wondered Voldemort. He raised their joined hands and brought Harry's attention to the glinting gold bands on their ring fingers. "We're already married."</p><p>"I wanted to kill you," wept Harry, compelled to answer Voldemort's question. Voldemort nodded and hummed. He wasn't surprised, of course. That was Harry's answer every twelve hours of their entire marriage. Harry didn’t know why he kept asking. It was almost as if he expected a different answer. As if he hoped Harry would suddenly say that he wasn’t going to try anything and that he truly loved Voldemort.</p><p>"I should get you pregnant," mused Voldemort. He reached for the flesh of Harry’s inner thigh, pinching lightly, just the way he knew Harry loved. Harry gasped in desire. "That should get you to stop. What do you think, my heart?" He answered Harry's look of pure horror with a chuckle. "Tell the truth. What would you do if I got you with child?"</p><p>"I'd try even harder," answered Harry, truth spilling out of his mouth like a water gushing out of a leaking pipe. "I'd kill you in your sleep, even if you made me love you."</p><p>"Oooh," mocked Voldemort. He pushed himself down the bed till his head was resting right above Harry’s crotch. "I’m so scared. I'd just have to have one of my Death Eaters kill your baby if you even try." He punctuated the threat with a long lick to Harry’s inner thigh. He followed it with a suck that bordered on painful, but strayed just this side of pleasure.</p><p>Harry shuddered. He believed Voldemort, believed that the man wouldn't care that the child was his, too. There would be no escaping if Voldemort managed to get Harry with child. Harry would never do anything to harm their baby, no matter how much he hated the father. And Voldemort knew that.</p><p>"On that note," said Voldemort, grabbing Harry's shirt collar and ripping the whole thing from neck to belly, "let's get to it, shan't we?"</p><p>Harry tried to struggle but Voldemort immediately ordered him to be still and enjoy their love-making. He spread Harry’s legs and dove straight for the little puckered hole. He licked a stripe across Harry’s hole, slowly working the appendage into Harry. But Voldemort was impatient tonight. Very soon, his tongue was replaced by his fingers, stretching Harry hard and fast. It was painful but so good. Harry’s body loved it when his husband was a little rough, a little hurried.</p><p>"You love me," said Voldemort, settling back against the headboard. "You want this. Come here and ride me."</p><p>After catching his breath, Harry got up on his hands and knees and crawled up Voldemort's body, kissing a path from his bellybutton to his neck which he lavished in kisses that would most certainly bruise. Voldemort, oddly enough, liked to show off any hickey Harry gave him. He especially enjoyed the hickeys that were in places he could not hide. He also loved being told over and over again how much Harry loved him.</p><p>"I love you too, sweetheart," moaned Voldemort as Harry lowered himself on his cock. He gripped Harry’s hips so hard he was probably going to leave a bruise, a mark of possession to stoke his ego. "I love you, baby. So much."</p><p>"Voldemort," groaned Harry. He began to move, raising himself on his knees before allowing gravity to force Voldemort’s fat cock back into his tiny hole. Voldemort gasped against Harry's ear, drawing the lobe into his mouth to suck on it. He pulled Harry closer, trapping his cock between their bodies and giving it much needed friction.</p><p>"You want it deeper," gasped Voldemort. "You want it rougher. Tell me, Harry." Harry nodded, begged him to be rougher, to go deeper.</p><p>"Fuck me," begged Harry. It never failed to get Voldemort going when Harry took initiative and demanded things in bed. It made him wild and <em>mindless.</em> With a growl, Voldemort turned them around and bent Harry in half, his ankles almost touching his ears. The older man thrust hard and brutal, hammering at Harry’s prostate and making him scream in pleasure.</p><p><br/>
“Oh yes,” moaned Harry. “Oh, fuck <em>yes.</em> Right there, please. It’s so good. So <em>fucking</em> good.” Say what you will about Voldemort. He remained amazing at sex.</p><p>It didn't take much longer after that, for Harry to bring Voldemort to completion. He goaded his husband, whispered filthy things in his ears as he wrapped his long legs around Voldemort’s hips. Trapped between Harry’s strong legs, Voldemort’s thrusts became shallower and increasingly erratic. He was close, Harry could feel it. Finally, with an animal sound, Voldemort spilled inside Harry’s hole.</p><p><br/>
As they lay in the afterglow, Harry prayed that Voldemort’s seed didn’t take.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>
  <strong>A few weeks later.</strong>
</p><p>Harry patted his petticoats so they sat straight as he pulled the final piece of the stupidly elaborate robes in place. He had to wear them. Voldemort thought they were pretty and Harry wanted to be pretty for his husband. It was an important day for Voldemort and everything had to be perfect.</p><p>But Harry hated the stupid robes. If they could even be called robes. There were four parts to it. A tall-necked, long-sleeved top that ended at his midriff; a pair of fitted slacks; petticoats that were open at the front so the slacks were visible; and a giant overskirt that trailed behind him like a wedding gown's train. The whole thing was dark green and embroidered in silver thread.</p><p>Harry looked like some rich Asian woman's curtains had thrown up on him.</p><p>"Darling," greeted Voldemort as Harry made his way down the long, winding stairs. Harry knew exactly what effect the train made as he climbed down the stairs. It pleased Voldemort, obviously, if his grin was anything to go by.</p><p>"If you didn't make me love you," said Harry, with a tight smile, "I would break your neck for making me wear this."</p><p>"You look beautiful," assured Voldemort. He kissed Harry's cheek and took his hand, leading him through the throng of Death Eaters that were gathered in the mansion's ballroom.</p><p>(Yes. Voldemort lived in a mansion. What a shocker.)</p><p>The Death Eaters, Voldemort's personal army, were a bunch of wizards who believed in blood supremacy. Voldemort, Harry had learnt, did not particularly believe in blood supremacy. He only helped push the Death Eaters' agenda because they had all the power in wizarding society and, despite his permanent magick, Voldemort could not simply will the whole of wizarding Britain to accept him as their leader. His ability only worked on people within 200 metres of him.</p><p><br/>
When they finally reached Voldemort's throne (again, such a shocker) Harry took his place besides it and stood tall and straight, the way he knew his husband liked. He <em>wanted</em> to please the man. Voldemort had told him so that very morning.</p><p>"Well?" prompted Voldemort. "Will any of you bring the bastard forth? I tire of waiting." A nervous, mousey little man ran off. He was closely followed by a stately gentleman with blond hair that Voldemort had likely introduced to Harry several times. Harry never remembered any of their names, but that might have something to do with the fact that he was never quite in control of his own mind.</p><p>The mousey man and the gentleman came in, dragging behind them an old man in robes that somehow managed to be even worse than what Harry was wearing. They were purple and twinkling and Harry's eyes smarted from looking at them too long.</p><p>"I know, love," murmured Voldemort. "It hurts my eyes, too."</p><p>"Like you have any room to talk," Harry scowled, rearranging his bloody overskirt. That was the wrong thing to say. Voldemort's jaw tightened, anger clear in his expression.</p><p>"Did you just compare me to the old coot?" hissed Voldemort. "Take it back, my love. Tell me you're sorry."</p><p>"I'm sorry," blurted Harry before his mind had managed to catch up with his mouth. "I take it back."</p><p>Voldemort took a deep breath and looked away, but he was clearly still upset. He gestured for the Death Eaters to bring the garish man closer. Harry thought the old man looked familiar. He had something to do with Harry's old school, Hogwarts.</p><p>"Is that Dumbledore?" asked Harry.</p><p>"Yes, <em>darling,"</em> snapped Voldemort. "Now, keep your pretty mouth shut until I speak to you again." Harry's jaw closed with an audible click.</p><p>"That is a horrible thing you're doing," said Dumbledore, staring at Harry. “You’ll never be happy this way.” Dumbledore seemed to know exactly what Harry was going through. Harry wanted to say something to acknowledge the old man’s consideration for him. But he could not speak and, not knowing what else to do, Harry waved in greeting, trying to convey to his old headmaster that he should stop worrying about Harry and think more about himself. Dumbledore, ever polite, began to wave back but Voldemort shot up and grabbed Harry's arm. He turned Harry around and twisted the arm behind his back.</p><p>"Keep being friendly to him," warned Voldemort, "and I'll snap your fucking arm, my love. Do you hear me?"</p><p>"S-sorry," whimpered Harry. It hurt. His arm <em>really hurt.</em> Voldemort might not be as strong as Harry, himself, but he was still pretty strong. Harry reached for his shoulder with his free arm, trying to do something, <em>anything,</em> about the pain but Voldemort only twisted harder, causing Harry to cry out.</p><p>"Tell him how much you love me, sweetheart," ordered Voldemort. "He thinks I'm forcing you. He and his merry little band came to <em>save </em>you from me. Tell him you don't need to be saved."</p><p>"I love you," cried Harry. "I love you. I <em>love you</em> and I don't need to be saved!"</p><p>"See?" said Voldemort, letting go of Harry's arm and turning back to Dumbledore's troubled expression. "We're in love! We're in love and you tried to separate us. You know, bad things happen to people that come in between true love. Isn't that right, darling?"</p><p>"Yes," sobbed Harry, cradling his hurt arm.</p><p>"Well, this old man came between true love," said Voldemort, gesturing to Dumbledore. "Isn’t that just <em>rotten,</em> my love? What do we do about that? What to do? What to do? A-ha! I know! Harry, it's been a while since you've used your magick!"</p><p>"N-no," plead Harry, knowing exactly where this was going. "Please don't. Don't make me do this." Voldemort smiled one of his cruelest, coldest smiles. He stalked up to Harry and cupped his cheeks.</p><p>"Harry, love of my life," whispered Voldemort against Harry's lips, "torture and <em>kill</em> Albus Dumbledore for me."</p><p>"No," begged Harry even as his body moved forward, catching up to Voldemort's command faster than his mind. He walked up to Dumbledore, still crying. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."</p><p>"It's quite alright, dear boy," assured Dumbledore, forgiveness etched in his every feature. It made the whole ordeal so much worse.</p><p>"Get on with it," ordered Voldemort. The flippant bastard.</p><p>Harry grabbed one of Dumbledore's arms and snapped through the ulna and radial. The old man let out a small cry of pain and tears gathered at the corners of his eyes. But he did not try to defend himself. He remained where he was, even as Harry tore his other arm from his torso, ripped his fingernails off one by one, flayed the skin off his back.</p><p>All of this, Voldemort watched with child-like glee in his eyes, clapping when Harry did something especially cruel.</p><p>Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, Harry took Dumbledore's head between his hands.</p><p>"It's over," wept Harry, even though it was obvious Dumbledore no longer understood anything. "Rest." With that, he snapped Dumbledore's neck and killed him.</p><p>"My love," Voldemort sighed as he hugged Harry from behind. Harry could feel the hardness between the monster's legs. He was <em>aroused!</em> Harry was so utterly disgusted, he almost threw up right then and there.</p><p>He was disgusted.</p><p>He was disgusted.</p><p>Twelve hours were up. And Voldemort had forgotten.</p><p>Finally!</p><p>Harry glided his hand gently across Voldemort's arms, up to his shoulders. He turned around, wanting to see the look in the bastard's eye when he realised he was going to die.</p><p>Immediately, he knew something was wrong.</p><p>Voldemort was smirking knowingly. He took hold of both of Harry's wrists and pulled them off his neck. Harry attempted to break free but his magick was not working. Why?</p><p>"Sweetheart," said Voldemort, "how stupid do you think I am? There are runes sewn into your clothes. Your magick won't work if I don't want it to."</p><p>"No,” whined Harry. He’d been so close. How could this be happening to him? Again.</p><p><em>"Yes,"</em> hissed Voldemort, victoriously. He pressed their lips together. "Love me, Harry."</p>
