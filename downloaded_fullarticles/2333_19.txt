  <span>It’s probably nothing worth writing sonnets about but the way her hair falls and flies around her face never stops drawing his eyebrows together. Such a small thing and yet Severus cannot seem to prevent the fascination it pulls him in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wisps of it going wild this way or that, whirling with tense concentration as she stirs potions till the early hours of the morning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Strands of brown and lengths of auburn catching the soft light of Hogwarts’ open sky as they fall graceful as ever down her back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gentle waves that can't be tamed as they rise along with her, Hermione's eyes still a blur of sleep and receding shades of onirism.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was always the details that Severus relished most. The tiniest things that he would focus on long after everyone else's attention had turned elsewhere, if they’d even been interested at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Details and carefulness. Soft petals of a flower so rare and delicate even magic could impair its beauty and effect. A wrinkle and a rictus on the face of an old friend whose pockets had always overflowed with secrets, they could tell so much to whom cared enough to listen attentively.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione most often wore her hair bunned up high on her head nowadays. Had for a few years now. A quick, easy, child-proof knot of hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus knew how insecure she used to be about it - he'd known for as long as he'd known the child she’d been, the woman she was today. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew how free she was now. He knew just how much air she breathed in in the morning without a dark thought to obscure it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re sitting by the fireplace of their quarters, night has come again on the school and it’s quiet and Hermione’s neck bows forward as she’s absorbed by the book on her lap and Severus had every intention of imitating her, except he doesn’t, cannot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His advanced potions’ master journal lies open on his crossed legs and the reflection of the flames dances on the pages, it doesn’t hold his attention for a second. His wife’s hair is still attached to the back of her head, held up by pins and a healthy dose of magic but even then, it retains every last bit of its natural, vibrant energy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When his magazine swishes and flops on the floor, tired of waiting unseen, probably, Severus lets out an uncharacteristic snort. Hermione raises her eyes from her book and dives on to the bottom of her husband’s black ones. She always seems to do that, Severus always feels it so deeply when she’s looking at him with this intent consideration that’s all her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her brow is furrowed, confused, her eyes flash around his face because she too, knows that the slightest facial movement can give you the answers you need but Severus beats her to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He leans back, his legs uncrossing and his voice is soft with wonderment when he reaches his simple conclusion, “You are beautiful.”</span>
