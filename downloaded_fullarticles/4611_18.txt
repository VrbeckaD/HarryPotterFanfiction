    <p align="left">Draco took a one last look over her girlfriend for the past 2 years, Hermione Granger , crying form. He convinces himself that it was the right thing. He chooses his duty to his family over her, over <em>Hermione</em>.</p><p>He left her. At their aparment crying, no it wasn't their apartment anymore, now it was only her apartment.</p><p> </p><p>3 weeks after Hermione sold her apartment.</p><hr/><p> </p><p><br/> 3 months, Its been 3 months since he last saw her. She was crying at that time but now she was laughing at what Cedric is whispering to her. Jealousy came through him but he ignores it as soon at it came.</p><p>He didn't expect to see her at one of the Ministry balls this year. He taught she won't attend this party like the last year and the year before that. They didn't like attending one of this stupid balls when they were together, both of them think it was rather unimportant. How stupid he was in thinking that he won't see her here with Cedric Diggory nonetheless.</p><p>2 weeks before Blaise came up to him to say the he heard from the gossip that her ex-girlfriend Hermione Granger is seeing the Auror Cedric Diggory. He didn't belive it of course and he just laughed at him. He said to Blaise that it was impossible but on the inside he felt his stomach slightly clenched.</p><p><em>"And how can you be sure of that?"</em> Blaise had asked him. He said he just knew.</p><p><em>"I wouldn't be sure of it. "</em> Blaise countered <em>"She's beautiful and smart and successful and more importantly she's single."</em> he grinned at him. He glared at his bestfriend. It was Blaise turn to laugh.</p><p><em>"Don't worry mate, ex-girlfriends are off limits to friends.."</em> Blaise assured him. He knew Blaise had a thing for Hermione since their Seventh year in Hogwarts but he also trusted his bestfriend.</p><p>Blaise left afterwards and Draco's mind keeps wondering if the rumors were true.</p><p><em>That's impossible</em> he said to himself</p><p><em>Oh and how wrong he was</em>. He was still looking at her gigling at what Cedric was saying. He eyed Cedric's hand as it travel from her arms to her back while whispering something to her. She didn't flinched nor she did 'nt try to stop him. He looked away from the pair.</p><p> </p><p><em>God She's beautiful</em> he told himself as he takes another glance at her. She was wearing a blood red colored gown that compliments her beautiful fair skin. Her hair was straighten tonight beautifully that he almost did'nt recognize her earlier. She was wearing less make up but her radiant smile made up for the lack of it but then again, she didn't really needed it. She was a natural beauty, <em>everyone knew that.</em></p><p>Her gown was cut low enough to show ample amount cleavage that he knew Cedric was enjoying viewing right now.<br/> God he miss the feel of her smooth skin and how he would cupped one of her delectable breast to his hand and licked the other one. He miss her moans when he did that.</p><p><em>Did Cedric also do that to her? Did she moaned when Cedric licked her breast and pinched her nipples?</em> He asked himself.</p><p><em>Stop it Draco!</em> He berated himself <em>Stop thinking of her, you're getting married in 6 months!</em> He shook his head to clear his thoughts and focus his attention to his fiance, <em>Astoria Greengrass.</em></p><p><em>She was beautiful and she was a Pure Blood</em> his father said and <em>that's all</em>. He tries listening to Astoria and Daphne's conversation but of course she never fails to disappoint him. They were talking about nonsense. Nonsense like the dress they were wearing tonight and how ugly the other girls were wearing, but of course they avoid talking about Hermione. Both sisters knew her past relationship with Draco and they both knew that Hermione was simply the most beautiful tonight.</p><p>He took another shot of firewhiskey and convinced himself that everything is what it should be. <em>A Malfoy marrying a Pureblood. His duty before her, </em></p><hr/><p> </p><p><br/> He throws his glass of firewhiskey as he tries to look at the Daily Prophet again. He just arrived from Paris with Astoria this afternoon and he quickly locked himself in his study when they arrived in the Manor. He taught that the two weeks so-called honeymoon with Astoria was hell, but he was wrong. This article in the Daily Prophet showing a moving picture of a man kneeeling with a ring in his hands and a woman crying, nodding and agreeing , <em>was hell</em>.</p><p>He was shaking with anger and rage and his heart was beating wildly.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>"Hermione Granger engaged to Cedric Diggory"</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>He burned every issue of Daily Prophet in the Manor that night and he drunk himself to sleep in his study. The last thought leaving him was</p><p>
  <em>Its for my family..my duty..my fucking duty</em>
