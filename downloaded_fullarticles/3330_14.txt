          <div class="userstuff"><p>We didn’t talk much.</p><p>I didn’t care. I just wanted to satisfy this weird feeling.</p><p>Potter might have had the same motivation. I wouldn’t know. He didn’t share much either.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>After a quick make out session in the street, he apparated us in some dark room.</p><p>I couldn’t see much but my eyes adjusted soon.</p><p>He took off my shirt. I removed his t-shirt.</p><p>He kissed my neck, my chest and my stomach and then pulled down my trousers and pants.</p><p>He blew me right then. His hands on my ass.</p><p>After, I would be ashamed for the moans coming from my mouth. But at that time I didn’t care about anything but Potter on his knees.</p><p>I came way too early. But I was finally without any thought.</p><p>He took off his jeans. And then he was naked.</p><p>He pushed me on the bed and moved above me.</p><p>‘Can I fuck you?’ he whispered in my ear.</p><p>Yes. ‘If you want to.’</p><p>‘No. Do you want it?’</p><p>I couldn’t say it. ‘Fuck me,’ I looked him in the eyes. His gaze intense.</p><p>He turned me around then.</p><p>Few spells later and he was inside me.</p><p>I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t see.</p><p>It was glorious.</p><p>He was moving slowly at first. Hitting the right places of my body. He kissed my neck and my back and my shoulders.</p><p>He grabbed my hair and kissed me on the lips. His pace quickened.</p><p>He came and groaned.</p><p>I moaned.</p><p>We lied there just for a moment. Waiting for the panting to stop. Then he rolled over on his back. And I felt odd</p><p>I pushed myself off the bed and stretched.</p><p>I put my clothes on.</p><p>I didn’t look at him once. But I felt his stare on my back.</p><p>I didn’t say anything and neither did he.</p><p>I somehow got out of the house into the street and apparated home.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>I felt dirty. And not just from sweat still on my skin or his cum on my thighs.</p><p>I showered, yet didn’t feel clean.</p><p>I felt unsatiated.</p><p>I wanted to sleep.</p><p>When I closed my eyes, he was there. Still in my head. Naked. The echoes of the night replaying.</p><p>The lust was still there.</p><p>I was fucked.</p></div>
