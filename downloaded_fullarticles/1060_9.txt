    <p>Draco Malfoy was astonished. He had no words, his mouth agape. If anyone besides the Slytherins saw him in that pitful state he was in, they would be more startled than he was in that moment. He acknowledged he was overreacting,  but it was somehow a coping mechanism of his. If you act like the worst has happened to you, at the time the actual worst would come, it would be far easier to survive the inevitable impact. It was just so ..... unimaginably overwhelming for someone like him.  He could've shattered to pieces right then and there, in a place full of judging people. But he didn't,  he couldn't, not in front of these people. They may be turning a blind eye on some shocked expression, but they would definitely remember if the prince of Slytherin broke down in the middle of the common room, sobbing grossly. After all, he held deep pride for his name and had the responsibility of a legacy to protect.</p><p>               His day began as an ordinary day if you can name his ordinary days 'ordinary'. Just his monotonous routine, a cycle he got so used to over the past years, the only thing he had to follow was repeating a routine and everything would be safe and sound, nothing being able to take him by surprise or bring him out of his comfort zone.</p><p>              However, absolutely nothing followed the course of what he wanted. And who was to blame for that? Harry Potter.The Golden Boy. The Saviour. It was all his fault. Not really in a physical way, but he was constantly on his mind. And somehow, somehow Potter managed to interact with his very being and essence, always finding every way possible to disorder his tranquil life.   He comprehended he shouldn't accuse Potter of everything that he didn't fancy being responsible for, but he couldn't help it. It was Potter's blame that he couldn't pay attention in classes, even in the ones he shared with Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, everything reminding him of the wizard. Potter's blame that he was always stuck in a trance of daydreaming about soft dark locks, plump pink lips or deep captivating eyes that he would no doubt get lost in if given the chance. Potter's blame he stayed sleepless hours after hours with no end, having to hide the dark bags under his eyes with some foundation the next day.  But he had to accept, in his own, weird subconscious  ..... it wasn't truly that bad.</p><p>             The famous boy transforms his life in someway.... charming, even dare he say, beautiful. Potter fascinated him and he, HE, Draco Malfoy,  actually believed Harry Potter and his precious presence were incredible.  One would assert that these feelings expressed liking or even loving someone. He denied accepting that truth. A Malfoy mustn't fall in love with some random magical being. There's no way that can arise. He had a soulmate somewhere, waiting to be found and protected.</p><p> </p><p>              After a particularly stressful day,  Draco could eventually rest. His head was aching, a migraine rising. His brain was an indescribable mess of thoughts. He tried to sort all of them, to ease his mind of the constant worry. Today he got in two fights with the Golden Trio, lost five house points, fell victim to the merciless pranks of the Weasley twins AND fell off his broom in the lake after Quidditch practice. HIS attempts were disrupted by the post owls making an entrance in the Great Hall, where Draco was enjoying a quiet meal. His father's plain barn owl, used in case of very private or urgent matters, decided to land in the middle of his plate.It proceeded to drop a heavily enchanted looking letter, stealing a piece of bacon in the process, then taking out, as sudden as it's landing. Draco stared at the spot where the owl stood not even a minute ago, then picked the letter up, letting the spells on it to recognize his magical signature.</p><p>            He didn't acknowledge it yet, but later on, this letter will change his life significantly. He was surprised,  as he wasn't awaiting a message from his parents until that Sunday, so it was or early, or a matter of great importance, as the owl and the enchantment used suggested, and the most likely. In the top left corner, written with red ink, spelt 'READ IN PRIVATE'. He never intended reading the letter in the stuffed to the brim hall anyway. He didn't fancy Pansy or Blaise reading any of it.  He wasn't the brightest in his year, he acknowledged it, but he was sharp enough to know not to take any unnecessary foolish risks. After making certain no one saw the letter, he hid it in his warded robe pocket. He didn't require any questions from meddlesome 'friends', as that would draw a lot of undesired attention.  He ate his remaining food as fast as he could without seeming suspect to others. He hastily got up and started heading towards the dungeons. He used a longer route,  just to make sure he didn't cross paths with the wizards who weren't in the hall.</p><p>         Finally in the common room, after a stressful walk through the secret entrance and an awkward conversation with Nott, he sat down on a large armchair and after casting several spells to keep any nosy people at a fair distance of him, he carefully took the letter out of his robe. He knew he was in a rather public space to read a very private letter, but he trusted his wards and knew the other Slytherins were trustful enough for anyone to dare to sneak a glance at the message written on neat parchment.  He delicately pierced the sealed envelope and got the thick parchment out.  He could distinguish his mother's elegant calligraphy. </p><p> </p><p>                                                                                               [Start of the letter ]</p><p> </p><p>                      My dearest Draco,</p><p>          These are hard times for people like us, and you must take knowledge of the war stirring behind closed doors. Dumbledore is gaining men, the Order of Pheonix has never been so large. He is plotting something, causing us trouble and all. Tom already has defensive plans to keep us safe, and he is regaining his powers as the days are passing, but don't be reassured by that. We may have spies within the Order, but Dumbledore also does, that is your godfather. Be careful and always alert dear, it's important to keep yourself safe. Your father and I made an important decision, and it may upset you immensely, but it had to be done. Dumbledore is already after Death Eaters, trying to lessen our numbers before the war starts getting violent, giving himself more chances at winning. We had decided, at Tom's request, to go in hiding. This summer we will use a heavily warded muggle house. It's our safest option, not many magical beings living there and less of Dumbledore's pawns lurking around. It will be extremely hard for you, not using magic at all, I mean, I acknowledge that dearest. Some advice coming from Tom is to try to accept the facts, understand the grounds we're on and the reasons behind our actions. You really should do a bit of reading on muggles, just so your first contact with their world won't be too much of a shock for you. And please, I beg you Draco, don't hate us for this whole ordeal. You are the most important being in our lives, we can't afford losing you, or as Tom likes to say, "we can't have him winding up dead". He may be joking in this case, but it can happen Draco. Just, just be positive and try not to dwell over it.<br/>Now that the serious subject is over, how was your week? Do you get enough sleep? I believe that the O.W.L.s are getting nearer and nearer, am I right? Try your best with them! They're important for your future. Anyway, your father is a little concerned with you. You haven't told him anything about the Potter boy for the last month! Is there something wrong, dear? </p><p> </p><p>We love you, sweetie, be careful.</p><p>~With love, Your Mother</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                                           [End of the letter]</p><p> </p><p>           He reread the letter three times, slowly allowing it to sink down, attempting to hold in a panic attack. All of the magic he was used to would disappear. In a muggle house. Away from his content magic life, from the world he was raised and lived all his life in. He didn't want to tear all the bonds with the magical world ... He didn't desire to give up all of his happy memories with magic. He understood their purposes, but couldn't they arrange something else instead? Like continuing to live with Tom, a far more safer option. He didn't want to endure it. He stood there, curled up on the armchair, gawking at the doomed parchment. How could this piece of paper break his life like that? He wondered,  how long has he stood there, just staring? It was obvious that outside was dark, so maybe hours... or just minutes. Then he realised he nearly fell asleep there. Why was he abruptly so weak? Maybe the shock was to impute. He got up and stretched until a satisfying 'pop' has been heard, and made his way to change from his now sweaty robes. He tucked himself in bed, and let sleep gradually overcome him. He would've had an uneasy sleep if Potter hadn't entered his dream and made him smile unconsciously.</p>
