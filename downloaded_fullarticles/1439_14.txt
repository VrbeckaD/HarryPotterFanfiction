    <p><span>Reborn was making the executive decision to </span><em><span>murder,</span></em> <em><span>painfully and into tiny little pieces</span></em><span> the dumbass that was the CEDEF head. All information on the man’s </span><em><span>Tuna-fishy </span></em><span>was as false as those veneers Iemitsu tried to blind everyone with. The report was wrong from the start. Reborn was now forever wary on whatever else was put in the packet if the very first thing was so blatantly incorrect it was more like written fiction. </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Falsity #1: Tsunayoshi Sawada lived with his loving, doting but spacy mother (</span>
  <em>
    <span>she is just the best! Sooooooo cute but a little in the clouds, which is okay because I love her and my son anyway!!!</span>
  </em>
  <span>)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Reborn discovered this blatant travesty on information gathering when he staked out the Sawada household only to find no Tuna-fishy coming or leaving the whole week. The hitman had to double check his calendar to make sure it wasn’t summer yet. And yep, it was still June. There was still at least a month left in the Japanese first term. The wife didn’t seem to notice her son wasn’t home. She talked to herself, giggled, placed stuffed animals around the living room only to take them down and place them in different places all the while exclaiming that her </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tsu-kun</span>
  </em>
  <span> would like it better that way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once again, Reborn had to check his packet on the new Vongola heir to make sure the boy was, in fact, 15 years old. Maybe the almighty dopy lion of Vongola got the birthdate of his child wrong too. Who knows. The picture that came with his report was 9 years old so Reborn was going to get a more recent picture as soon as the woman left. Maybe that would clarify the child’s real age. Reborn was betting on the mother being correct seeing as she actually raised the idiota’s son. Getting a more updated picture would make it easier to track down his target too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dumbass CEDEF head making Reborn do extra work. Either give accurate data or let Reborn gather his own. Half-done work was one of those pet peeves that made the hitman more homicidal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The mother left an hour later still speaking to herself about Tsu-kun’s favorite foods and grocery shopping for ingredients. The hitman quickly entered and got to work. The quicker he did this, the quicker he could start torturing his student and the quicker he could get back to tracking the Checkered bitch down. He liked raising new generation Mafia heads but he still needed to become an adult again before whatever adverse affects Bitch Iron Hat </span>
  <em>
    <span>forgot </span>
  </em>
  <span>to disclose killed off the </span>
  <em>
    <span>I Sette Più Forti</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Except after scouring the house, there were no new pictures after 6 years old. No yearbooks, no graduation classes. Nothing. Even the boy’s room looked like there was still a six year old in the house. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So, old fashion recon it was. Reborn should have disregarded the pre-gathered information immediately after it was given but he’d been getting lazy lately. He almost always got Vongola information for missions now and Reborn was getting too comfortable. This would be a good opportunity to polish his skills again. Rustiness in this business had the unfortunate consequence of getting someone dead. Like dead, dead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Reborn left the home with more questions than information and a headache the size of Sicily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Next stop, the school. </span>
