    <p>The streets of the village were dark. No living soul wandered these streets at that hour. The winter was terrible that year. All the structures were covered in white, thick, and massive sheets of snow. That, in turn, illuminated the village in a strange eerie glow.</p><p>The man in the long purple robes was observing the setting. To a casual observer, he may be seemed to be taking in the sight of snow laden setting, but the loss of the everlasting twinkle in his blue eyes and his alert stance told a different story. The ongoing war had taken its toll on everybody. The man took a sideward glance at the chatter coming from a nearby place. Three broomsticks looked cozy and warm. The gentle flames in the fireplace seen through the gaps of the door were inviting. But Dumbledore's paces did not stop there; his destination was at the far end of the village.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore reached the dingy part of Hogsmeade. He was standing in front of a shady pub. Hog's head always had this mortifying look. Anybody who wanted to have a good private conversation wouldn't come here. There were too many eavesdroppers. Alas, Dumbledore wasn't hoping to have any kind of secret meeting thus it did not matter to him.</p><p>He gave a gentle nudge to the door that opened with quite a loud squeak. The owner gave a dirty look at the newcomer and went back to scrubbing the tables. Dumbledore smiled and swept his eyes through the room. There was no fire roaring in the fireplace to warm the place. There were flickering lamps burning in the corners of the room that provided the meager amount of light. There at one corner of the room in the front of one of the lamps, sat a lone figure that caught Dumbledore's attention. He strode through the dank benches to reach that person. Some people drew their hoods further down to conceal their faces and some of them arrogantly raised their eyebrows towards the approaching wizard. He ignored all of them and went to the person who was at the last table and sat across her.</p><p>"Sybill Trelawney," his voice was filled warmth when he addressed her.</p><p>"Professor Dumbledore, Sir," she answered in a high squeaky voice. She looked oddly dressed even for Hog's head. She was drowning in oversized jumpers and shawls. Her eyes looked engorged from her high-powered round glasses. Her unkempt hair was falling into her face.</p><p>"Ah Sybill, I trust you are doing well. Now, what can I do for you?" Dumbledore queried.</p><p>"I heard you have a vacancy for the Divination teacher's post," she said. Dumbledore nodded and gave a hand gesture to continue. "Right," she cleared her throat. "I think you cannot find a better teacher than I. The legendary Seer, Cassandra Trelawney's blood runs through my veins and my recent predictions have come true already," she stated with mustered confidence.</p><p>Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "Well, if you are talking about the Magpie's win from last Quidditch season, I hardly consider that as your prediction, my dear. I heard you made that prediction when the other team lost their seeker in the middle of the game and the Magpie's were ahead with a massive lead."</p><p>"N…no", Trelawney stuttered. She gulped and said, "No." "That would be incorrect. Surely, you must have heard about my other predictions and not one, mm hm, went wrong." She hastily took the glass in front of her and gulped the drink, more than half of it slipping into her shawls.</p><p>Dumbledore took pity on the person in front of him. He never had the inclination to continue the concept of Divination in his curriculum, but he thought it was polite to at least meet her. He was disappointed. The poor thing did not share the gift of her ancestor.</p><p>"I have nowhere to live Professor. I have lost everything and everyone," she said in a shaky voice. "I can prove myself if you give me a chance. My visions are vivid and my predictions are absolute. It would be beneficial to the school and its students. Through my sight, I will be able to prepare them better for their futures. In that way they will be able to look beyond and be always ready," she continued.</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled to himself. "I have no doubts about you, my dear, but you see," he abruptly stopped as the woman in front of him was suddenly pushed into a trance. Her eyes rolled up into her head and she started talking in a wheezy tone. The man in the half moon spectacles was startled at the new developments but recovered. As Dumbledore heard the word Dark Lord, he brandished his wand and put up a silencing charm, enveloping both of them in a special bubble.</p><p>
  <em>"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches… born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies… and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not… protected by two souls that accompanied him into this world… a brilliant one, same as his mother and a cunning one who is misguided… together they gave him a power, Dark Lord knows not…and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives… the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies…."</em>
</p><p>She immediately came out of the trance and looked into the shocked eyes of the headmaster. "Ah, Professor Dumbledore, as I was saying, I really don't have a place to stay. I would be very grateful if you consider my services," she concluded in her normal voice.</p><p>Dumbledore was spellbound but his face remained impassive. He could not believe his ears for a moment. That was a real prophecy and he believed its authenticity as he heard it firsthand. He would believe everything she said in her trance like state, as that is the indication of a true seer capability. A solution has been presented. It provided him a hope. Tom riddle could be challenged, crippled, and crushed. He has got a lot to think. But first things first, he had to handle the situation in front of him.</p><p>Dumbledore turned around and looked at the people around them. There was no doubt some of them were Voldemort's followers. There is every chance they have overheard parts of the prophecy before his shield went up. As if taken a clue a person at the far end stood up and rushed outside. Dumbledore groaned knowing that the prophecy was already on its way to the intended. He was disappointed at the unfortunate moment and chided himself for underestimating the potential of the candidate. Sybill Trelawney had indeed possessed the sight, even though she was unaware of it. He definitely regretted the location she had chosen to meet the headmaster.</p><p>He sighed and turned his face to the oblivious person in front of him. She had no idea, that she had just given hope to all of them who wants to fight against the tyranny of Lord Voldemort and in doing so put herself in a grave danger. Dumbledore had to make the decision. He was not sure how much of the Prophecy the messenger heard. They may come after her. She is in a vulnerable situation and he now held the responsibility of protecting her. The only inevitable solution he could foresee was to hire her for the said Divination post.</p><p>"Sybill, I indeed require your services. I am delighted to offer you a position in our esteemed staff. And may all the children be enlightened by your wisdom," Dumbledore told the excited lady in front of him.</p><p>She seemed ecstatic. "Thank you, thank you, Professor. I am so grateful. You have deemed my mind utterly rapturous. You can now be ensured that your students are going to glow in the rays of pure knowledge of the noble art of Divination."</p><p>"I am sure. Now please allow me to escort you to your quarters in our great school. I trust you are looking forward to a good night's sleep after this tiring day," Dumbledore spoke as he got up to lead the way out.</p><p>"Mmm, yes yes. I am very much looking forward to it. Headmaster, you are most kind," Trelawney followed Dumbledore, gathering all her things.</p><p>"That my dear Sybill, you have no idea," Dumbledore mused to himself entering into the cold night again. But when he faced the ice-cold weather now, some of the lost twinkles had re-entered his blue eyes.</p><p> </p>
