    <p>The audience roared when Marion Diaz finally caught the snitch. Ginny grinned, feeling the exhilaration in the air and did a couple loops on her broom. She was the second newest member of the Holyhead Harpies, and the youngest, so such displays of excitement were happily received. The team was well on its way to the Quidditch World Cup finals, and she couldn't wait for August, to finally participate in something she'd loved watching for so long.</p>
<p>Half the team was out celebrating still, and the other half trudged towards their rooms, eager to sleep so they could get up early and begin working out for the next match which was in a few days. Ginny stood in the shower and let the warm water run over her while she thought about what'd happened just a half hour earlier at the pub where Gwenog Jones had led the team and bar patrons in a toast celebrating the win.</p>
<p>"Another one for the books!" Gwenog roared, spilling fire whisky as she raised her glass. Everyone cheered as she downed it, then bent down to sloppily kiss Valmai Morgan, who didn't seem to mind. Ginny laughed and sipped her beer. She loved fire whisky of course, but as she planned on an early morning at the gym, she didn't want to get too plastered. Her roommate Rosemary White rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Ginny.</p>
<p>"I just don't get why Gwenog has to be so obvious is all," said Rosemary. She shrugged and finished her pumpkin juice. She preferred not to drink any alcoholic beverages when she had an early wake up call.</p>
<p>"Obvious?" asked Ginny. "What do you mean? She's just having a bit of fun."</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous, Ginny. I know you're young, but I didn't think you were naive. Valmai's her partner." Rosemary said the last sentence scornfully, and rolled her eyes again.</p>
<p>"Partner?" Ginny looked over at the corner where Gwenog and Valmai were getting quite cozy indeed. "I didn't know Gwenog even liked women."</p>
<p>"It's rather an open secret, but I am surprised that you proclaim to be such a big fan and didn't know this. Anyway, I wish she would keep it to herself. I'm gonna go, you coming or catching up later?" Rosemary stood up and barely waited for Ginny to say no before she strode off.</p>
<p>Ginny watched Gwenog and Valmai for a while as she finished drinking her butterbeer. She looked around at her teammates all happily celebrating, not caring. At one point, Gwenog broke away from Valmai to listen to something Alex Kidd whispered in her ear, grinned, and went happily back to snogging while Alex laughed. Ginny'd never known in all these years that her icon, Gwenog Jones, was involved with women. There were occasional rumors of course, especially the one floating around about her decking a man for proposing to her, but beyond that not much else.</p>
<p>"Well, it's not that surprising, I suppose," said Ginny to herself.</p>
<p>"What's not?" Alex Kidd had sat down across from Ginny without her noticing. She grinned.</p>
<p>Ginny felt her cheeks getting hot. The last thing she wanted was for another teammate to mock her naïveté. But she didn't think Alex was like Rosemary. "I just was thinking about Gwenog and Valmai."</p>
<p>Alex chuckled. "Oh were you now? I guess there's more to you than meets the eye, Red."</p>
<p>"What? No! I just idolized Gwenog for ages and hadn't known. Until now. I didn't realize everyone else knew but me, apparently. That's all." Ginny sunk back in her seat feeling embarrassed.</p>
<p>Alex leaned back too. "I am so sorry that Rosemary is your roommate. She is a fantastic Beater, I'll give her that, the best this team's seen in ages. But rather unpleasant to be around sometimes, isn't she? Don't listen to her. Gwenog hasn't been that open about it -- most of the team isn't, in fact. It's a funny world out there still, and we also like a bit of privacy still anyway about our lives. Our gay fans know who's who, and I think they've got some hopes about others."</p>
<p>"What about me?" Ginny asked.</p>
<p>Alex laughed. "Well, you dated Harry Potter, the most famous man in the world. How much more straight could you get?" Ginny frowned. "You are straight, aren't you, Red?"</p>
<p>Ginny opened her mouth to answer but didn't say anything. She looked at Gwenog and Valmai over in the corner. They seemed to be in their own world. She looked again at her other teammates, laughing and cheering. Then she looked back at Alex, who was no longer looking at her but at the barman, hoping to catch his eye for another drink. Her dark hair caught the light, shining, and her tan skin seemed to glow. Everything looked a bit hazy, all of a sudden, and Ginny felt a bit weird. "I should go," she said and stood up. "Thanks for the talk, Alex. I won't worry about Rosemary." And she walked off. Alex called after her, but she didn't hear what she said.</p>
<p>Ginny opened her eyes. She'd been in the shower for ages now, thinking over this more than she meant to. Alex had a point, didn't she? "Don't be ridiculous," she muttered to herself. She turned the water off and reached for her towel. On the way out, she nearly bumped into Alex Kidd, who laughed.</p>
<p>"Fancy bumping into you again tonight, Red! You ran off so fast. I thought maybe I scared you, but I see you're doing fine." Alex was in front of her, in her towel, waiting for Ginny to move. Ginny was also in her towel. She saw the team in their towels and sometimes less every day, so why did this suddenly seem different?</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm fine. I just was really tired and wanted to get to bed," she said unconvincingly. "So I should get going. Erm. Enjoy your shower."</p>
<p>Alex laughed again. "Don't you worry, Red. I will." Ginny blushed and hurried off to the room she shared with Rosemary.</p>
<p>Ginny tried to close the door quickly and quietly so the light wouldn't come into their room, but Rosemary still groaned and turned off. "Why are you so late?" she asked groggily.</p>
<p>"Sorry. Had a bit of a chat with Alex and wanted a quick shower before sleep." Ginny got into her bed, feeling her muscles ache as she relaxed under the covers. Soon they'll hurt even more tomorrow morning, she thought. A good sort of hurt.</p>
<p>"Alex? Ugh. The biggest lesbo of them all," Rosemary muttered, jolting Ginny out of her thoughts.</p>
<p>"What's your problem?" Ginny said. "She's nice." But Rosemary didn't hear her, because she'd already fallen back asleep. Ginny could hear snoring. "Quite nice, actually." She lay awake for a while, and eventually drifted off, thinking about what Alex's shiny hair would smell like when she was out of the shower.</p>
