    <p>“How can anyone with true character, with pride, love and hate, tolerate the offense of being put at the mercy of the ignorant?”</p>
<p>All of them opened their eyes with the rise of the sound.</p>
<p>Twelve people were seated in a circle around an archaic dark table, facing a light ball which held a silver flame that glowed faintly. They found themselves inside a gloomy hall. Shadows of various shades were thrown beneath the high-rising dome. Fog suffused the space beyond the table, leaving only one direction of gleaming white light in distance.</p>
<p>Each of them cried in surprise when they made out who were sitting beside them.</p>
<p>“Harry? What happened?”<br/>
“Sirius! Professor Snape! You are not dead?”<br/>
“Master! Master I have been waiting all this time for you!”<br/>
“What’s the matter? Dumbledore?”<br/>
“This is impossible! I killed you myself!”<br/>
“Maybe you should practice your Killing Curse for a few more years, boy.”<br/>
“Draco——”<br/>
“Father! He, You-Know-Who is still alive!”</p>
<p>“Quiet! Be quiet!” The uproar was drowned by a cold, solemn, resounding female voice. The light ball in the center of the table started to twinkle, drawing everyone’s attention to itself. “Don’t talk! And don’t move! Observe where you are!”</p>
<p>Everyone silenced for a moment, looking at each other.</p>
<p>On twelve identical black wooden chair, twelve interrelated people were seated.</p>
<p>Sitting with his back facing the white light in the darkness was Albus Dumbledore, a tall and spare figure with silvery hair and blue eyes. He was dressed in white robes with his half-moon spectacles on. In his unharmed right hand was a berry-esque wand which he slowly twirled. To his right sat a handsome young man with black hair. He was wearing a gloomy look on his face and was toying with a ring of dark stone, his black eyes turned deliberately on Dumbledore. Hermione Granger, dressed in black robes of the Ministry, was on this young man’s right side. She pressed her lips together, her brown hair being quite bushy. To her other side sat Sirius Black, gaunt and disheveled, fixing his light grey eyes with intensive hate on Bellatrix Lestrange, who was next to him. She didn’t return the glare, but was instead looking up with an expression of frantic obsession to the man on her right side. That’s Voldemort, his pale face resembling a snake’s, his eyes blood red.</p>
<p>Voldemort didn’t fuss about Bellatrix. A yew wand held tight in his spidery fingers, he appeared to be ready to release a spell any moment. However, the object he is pointing his wand at was not at all alarmed. Dressed in black robes, Gellert Grindelwald was brushing his grey hair aside inattentively. To Grindelwald’s right was Draco Malfoy who was trying hard not to give away looks of fear. His light blond hair clinging to his pallid face, he was turning sideways to Lucius Malfoy, as if asking for help. Lucius himself was rigid. He cast sidelong glance at Draco to console him, fumbled for his hand, but was prevented from doing so by an invisible screen in the air.</p>
<p>Seated on Lucius’s right side was an expressionless Severus Snape in black robes. He remained silent, resting his cold eyes on all present with an attitude of indifference. Rita Skeeter, wearing her beetle-patterned eyeglasses, was sitting by him. The shaking and trembling Skeeter today offered quite a contrast to her usual image of strutting around complacently in an air of self-content. To her right and Dumbledore’s left was Harry Potter, the Chosen One, his glasses and lightening scar making him easy to spot. He turned at Dumbledore, and then at Voldemort, then shifted towards Snape and Sirius, apparently troubled by mixed feelings but managed to retain cool reticence.</p>
<p>“Observe the people around you,” the light ball spoke, fire gleaming faintly under its crystal spherical surface. The echoing voice filled the hall, sending chills down everyone’s spine. “Once in the past, you had been enemies or friends. Once, you loved or killed each other. But all of this is bound to begin again.”</p>
