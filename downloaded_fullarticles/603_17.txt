    <p>If Little Whinging had been as particular about the state of their road maintenance as they had been about the precise length of grass on their homeowners' lawns, the world would have been very different.</p>
<p>Sadly, their priorities were misplaced.</p>
<p>And so it happened that one day, as a ten-year old Harry Potter looked back over his shoulder to smirk at the figures of Dudley and his gang receding into the distance, his toe bumped against a raised section of sidewalk. He had time to gasp. Perhaps if he had been thinking about something other than what Dudley and his crowd would do when they caught up to their favorite punching bag, he might have bothered to stretch his hands out to try and save himself. Perhaps even a burst of magic, a rare and precious miracle for a boy who had so little else to be happy about, might have broken his fall.</p>
<p>But Harry Potter just wasn't thinking. Right up until his skull smashed into the pavement, the only thoughts running through his mind were those of mindless panic.</p>
<p>And then there was only blissful darkness, and silence.</p>
<p>Piers Polkiss, weedy and small, slowed down as he approached the crumpled figure on the pavement. Cautiously, he edged forward until he could poke the body with the toe of his trainers. His small eyes narrowed even further when the boy failed to so much as twitch in response.</p>
<p>None of Dudley's friends were particularly clever boys. Still, dim-witted as Piers was, he recognized trouble when he saw it. "'E's not movin'," he called out as Dudley and Malcolm, huffing slightly, moved up to join them.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Malcolm's face twisted as he attempted to struggle through a sentence. "So what?"</p>
<p>Dudley was a little quicker on the uptake. "This isn't <i>my</i> fault!"</p>
<p>Piers shrugged one shoulder. Dudley's cousin still hadn't moved. The three boys stared nervously at each other, shifting from foot to foot. "He's <i>your</i> cousin, isn't he?" Piers pointed out.</p>
<p>Dudley raised his massive fists, swinging around to face his friend. "You're not going to rat on me, are you?"</p>
<p>"No, no," Piers said quickly, backing away. "What if he's dead, though? What're we goin' to do then?"</p>
<p>Dudley paled. "He's not dead! We were just having a bit of fun, that's all! You can't die from a fall like that!" He hesitated for a moment. "You can't, can you?"</p>
<p>"Wake up, you!" Malcolm yelled, aiming a kick at Harry's calf. His leg didn't even twitch, sliding limply forward to fall slack against the ground.</p>
<p>Dudley looked as if he was going to be sick. "I'll get my mum."</p>
<p>Piers leaned forward, peering at the smaller boy's face. Behind the mop of messy hair covering his forehead, Harry's eyes were closed. A strangely peaceful smile was frozen on his lips. "Better hurry," he said.</p>
<p>Dudley started running.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p><i>Boy,</i> a voice said, faint but insistent. <i>Boy!</i> Then, much louder: <i>BOY!</i></p>
<p>"I'm up, I'm up, stop shouting!" Harry jolted upright, wincing as a fresh burst of pain exploded in his head. Clutching his forehead with one hand, he looked around the empty room in confusion. He could have sworn that he'd heard Uncle Vernon-</p>
<p><i>I most certainly am NOT,</i> someone hissed, indignant and cold and sounding as if they were standing right behind him, whispering in his ear.</p>
<p>Harry froze. <i>Hello?</i> he thought tentatively.</p>
<p><i>Ah,</i> the voice said, sounding satisfied. <i>Good. You can hear me. This will make things much easier.</i></p>
<p>That settled it. He'd finally cracked, like the Dursleys had always said he would. They'd finally be justified in packing him off to a home, or an asylum, or just getting rid of him somewhere in London-</p>
<p><i>Stop your blathering and listen, boy,</i> the voice snarled. It was unpleasantly high-pitched, almost on the edge of being grating.</p>
<p>Harry frowned. He knew he wasn't very strong. But there was no way he was just going to sit there and let some figment of his imagination talk back to him. <i>My name isn't 'boy,'</i> he thought.</p>
<p><i>What?</i> He could almost picture a shadowy figure drawing back slightly, frowning. <i>I do not care. You will-</i></p>
<p><i>My name,</i> he thought, trying to convey the same sense of authority that his teachers had, <i>is Harry Potter.</i></p>
<p>Silence. Harry began to hope that he'd driven the voice away. Maybe he had a concussion? He remembered falling down, and he seemed to be in a hospital room. Maybe once the headache went away, the voice would, too.</p>
<p>His hopes were dashed when the voice spoke again. You <i>are Harry Potter</i>, it said. It sounded more cautious, this time.</p>
<p><i>That's what I just said,</i> he thought back. Great. It wasn't bad enough that he was stuck with a voice in his head. It just had to be a really <i>dim</i> voice, to boot.</p>
<p><i>Enough,</i> the voice hissed unpleasantly. <i>I will not be insulted by the likes of you. I WILL restore myself!</i> Harry cried out as the stabbing throb of pain in his forehead intensified, steadily growing until it felt as if someone was driving a fist through his skull. All he could think of was the pain - it wouldn't stop, it wouldn't stop, it wouldn't-</p>
<p>And then it vanished, instantly. Harry slumped forward, the air escaping his lungs in a sigh of relief. Gingerly, he lowered his hand from his forehead. Still nothing. The pain was gone.</p>
<p><i>Boy.</i> The voice was astonished, now. <i>What did you do?</i></p>
<p><i>My name's not 'boy,'</i> he repeated stubbornly. The voice ignored him, so Harry folded his arms and decided to ignore the voice back. He was quite happy to stare into space and enjoy the lack of pain for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The voice did not seem to be as patient as he was. With a distinct air of gritted teeth, it repeated its question. <i>Harry Potter. What did you do?</i></p>
<p>He thought about it for a second. That was a good point, actually. What *had* he done? <i>I dunno,</i> he thought back, doing his best to convey a mental shrug.</p>
<p><i>You don't know?</i> The voice's barely suppressed rage flared into incandescence. <i>How can you not know?</i></p>
<p>The novelty of having someone else to talk to was rapidly wearing off. <i>Well, I don't,</i> Harry thought, starting to feel annoyed. <i>You're rather rude, you know.</i></p>
<p><i>You impertinent brat,</i> the voice hissed. <i>Imagine that you, the most powerful wizard in the world, are trapped in a small, dark box for ten years. Unable to speak, to move, to even use any of your senses. And when you wake, you find yourself as a disembodied mind stuck inside an imbecilic child. Would you not feel inclined to be somewhat RUDE?</i></p>
<p>Harry didn't even know where to begin. It sounded like a trap, though. <i>I can't imagine being a wizard,</i> he thought cautiously.</p>
<p>The voice shrieked in frustration. <i>No, you idiot! I am the wizard! You - you are nothing!</i></p>
<p>Harry frowned. <i>I'm not talking to you any more.</i></p>
<p>The voice seemed momentarily surprised. <i>Good. Now, here is what you must do-</i></p>
<p><i>No,</i> Harry interrupted it. <i>You don't seem to like doing nothing, do you? Well, I'm *great* at doing nothing. I'm pretty used to it, actually. So I don't have to talk to you. Or listen to you. You can carry on ranting to yourself, or whatever. See how far it gets you.</i></p>
<p><i>How dare you,</i> the voice breathed. <i>I am the greatest wizard alive-</i></p>
<p><i>You're not alive,</i> Harry pointed out. <i>You're stuck inside a ten-year old boy's head. You don't really sound much like 'greatest wizard' material to me.</i> The voice screamed and railed some more, but Harry was used to such things. He picked up a tatty-looking brochure from the bedside table, wrinkling his nose as he stared at the cover. Colonoscopies and You: What You Need To Know!</p>
<p>Well, it would certainly be better than staring at the wall.</p>
<p>It was almost morning before the voice finally gave in. <i>Harry Potter,</i> it said smoothly. <i>I believe we got off on the wrong foot.</i></p>
<p>Harry set down the brochure he was holding and waited. He had to admit, it felt good to be able to lord it over someone else for a change.</p>
<p>
  <i>What do you say, Harry? I admit that I lost my temper. Why don't we start again?</i>
</p>
<p><i>All right,</i> Harry said cautiously. <i>Why don't you introduce yourself?</i></p>
<p><i>Very well. My name,</i> the voice said grandiosely, <i>is...Marvolo.</i></p>
<p>Harry was unable to contain a small snort. <i>Oh, come on.</i></p>
<p><i>Excuse me?</i> The voice was ice-cold.</p>
<p>
  <i>That's completely unfair. I gave you my real name. You're giving me a made-up one.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>What makes you think that it is 'made up', as you so eloquently put it?</i>
</p>
<p><i>What sort of a name is Marvolo?</i> Harry countered.</p>
<p><i>Marvolo is a perfectly respectable wizarding name, I'll have you know,</i> the voice said stiffly. <i>And may I point out that it is you who is now being rude?</i></p>
<p><i>Sorry,</i> Harry said immediately, conditioned to apologize even for things that he knew weren't his fault. <i>But...wizards don't really exist.</i></p>
<p><i>The alternative is that you are carrying on a conversation with a voice in your head,</i> said voice said dryly. <i>I suspect that you would prefer the other explanation.</i></p>
<p>It had a point. <i>Okay...Marvolo,</i> Harry said. <i>Nice to meet you. I think.</i></p>
<p><i>Likewise,</i> Marvolo purred. <i>Now, Harry, I seem to be in something of a predicament. You see, I appear to have been cursed by one of my enemies.</i></p>
<p><i>What a coincidence,</i> Harry thought sarcastically. <i>Me, too.</i></p>
<p><i>Ha. Ha. Ha.</i> Marvolo's laugh sounded as if it was emanating from a Halloween decoration. <i>I was hoping that you might be able to help me, Harry. You see, to restore my body, I need to borrow some of your magic. Don't worry, though. Once I am fully restored, I will make sure to reward you properly.</i></p>
<p><i>Yeah, no,</i> Harry said immediately.</p>
<p><i>Why not?</i> Marvolo seemed to be genuinely puzzled. <i>After all, you do not believe in magic. What use is it to you?</i></p>
<p><i>I'm not stupid, no matter what the Dursleys think.</i> Harry folded his arms. <i>You've done nothing but insult me, until you needed me to do something. And I'm pretty sure you were the one making my head hurt, before.</i></p>
<p><i>You're right.</i> Harry blinked in surprise. <i>I acted foolishly when I woke. I had not expected to be dealing with someone so...like myself.</i> Harry didn't really think that was a compliment, but it seemed to be intended as one. So that was progress, at least. <i>It would be improper of me to ask a favor without offering something in return.</i></p>
<p>"I don't want anything from you," he said out loud, alarmed.</p>
<p>
  <i>Come, now. There must be something you want.</i>
</p>
<p><i>I've read books about deals with vaguely evil voices, thanks,</i> Harry thought promptly. <i>I think I'm all right.</i></p>
<p><i>Harry, be reasonable-</i> Harry's attention was ripped away from Marvolo as the door burst open. A frazzled-looking nurse hurried in.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, you're awake!" She hurried over to the monitors by the side of the bed, frowning as she checked the display. "These must be broken...I can't imagine why...I'm so sorry." She looked at him anxiously. "You haven't been awake for too long, have you, love?"</p>
<p>"No," he lied. She seemed nice enough, and he didn't want to make her any more upset. </p>
<p>"Oh, good," she said, obviously relieved. "Your family will be pleased to hear you're awake, I'm sure."</p>
<p>"No, they won't," he said immediately, but regretted it at the look on her face. "Sorry. I was just joking."</p>
<p>"Of course." The nurse gave him a warm smile. "Well, we'll give them a call, and you'll be free to go once they come pick you up. All of your scans were completely normal. How are you feeling?"</p>
<p>""Fine," he said.</p>
<p>"I'll give them a call now," she said, apparently satisfied. "I'm surprised they're not here already!"</p>
<p>Harry wasn't. But he didn't say anything, even as she hurried out.</p>
<p>
  <i>I wish they cared about me.</i>
</p>
<p><i>I saw them bring you in, Harry Potter.</i> Marvolo's voice held disdain, but for once, it wasn't just for him. <i>Those filthy Muggles were carrying on and on about the inconvenience, about what their kind would think. They will *never* care about you.</i></p>
<p><i>But I want them to,</i> he thought sadly, unable to stop himself.</p>
<p><i>I can help with that, you know,</i> Marvolo whispered.</p>
<p>He tried not to give away how his heart soared at the thought. <i>You can?</i></p>
<p>
  <i>I can show you how to make them treat you better. I can teach you how to make them respect you, as they should.</i>
</p>
<p>It wasn't *quite* answering the question. But still, if there was a chance...<i>That doesn't sound like it's really worth the magic you say I've got,</i> he said cautiously.</p>
<p><i>I am sure that we can work something out,</i> Marvolo said smoothly.</p>
<p>Harry hesitated a moment, to keep up appearances, but he already knew what he was going to say. <i>What do I have to do?</i></p>
<p>In his head, Marvolo smiled.</p>
