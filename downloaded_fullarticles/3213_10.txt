    <p>"Narcissa," Lucius breathes out. He feels as if she isn't really there, that him standing before her is a lie, that she will disappear in an instance. Hesitantly, he reaches a hand forward and is surprised when it meets the soft skin of her hand. He looks at her hand, so pale, so delicate, so familiar, so reassuring. He looks up from her hand to her deep blue eyes, and he is drowning in an ocean with how blue they are. He would gladly drown too if it meant he could see them for the rest of his life. The seconds are minutes, are hours, are days, are months, are years. And all the same it's all too soon when he pulls back to reality.</p><p>Narcissa and he embrace. And Lucius holds her tightly, tighter than the first time, tighter than the last time. He holds his beloved Narcissa close, close, close, never daring to back away less he realize this is all a mistake, a lie, a fraud, an illusion, a hallucination. Lucius doesn't want to wake up in Azkaban, in his cell, reliving his worst memories over and over and over and over and-- And when Narcissa holds him close, and he actually feels her arms wrap around his waist and actually feels the pressure of Narcissa holding him close, Lucius breathes out a shaky breath. And as much as this is grounding and tells him this is real (This is real for Merlin's sake!), Lucius has to be sure.</p><p>"Is...," Lucius asks slowly and quietly but loud enough that Narcissa can hear him, his voice cracks from disuse, "is this real? Are you actually here? Am I out? Am I free?"</p><p>And Narcissa pulls back and looks into his eyes. And he can see the sadness in Narcissa's deep blues. And Lucius can feel it deep in his heart. That it hurts her on some level. Before he can speak the apology that is on the tip of his tongue, ready to roll free and ask for forgiveness.</p><p>"Yes," she tells him firmly, a hand placed on Lucius's pale cheek as he looks into her eyes, which are now firm and resolute. "You are here. I am here. We're outside of that awful prison. We're free. You're free, Lucius."</p><p>And he can't help but to believe it. She is surely telling the full and entire truth to him right now. But it still leaves him with one question that remains unanswered. And Lucius isn't sure if he wants the answer.</p><p>"But at what price?" he asks Narcissa, voice croaky and making his throat hurt when he speaks at all.</p><p>"You'll know soon. They'll explain in court."</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>Lucius can't leave his home without an Auror accompanying him, and he has to talk with them. They never agree to let him go. He is also required to have a Mind Healer see him multiple times a month for the next however many years it takes. Lucius isn't allowed a wand or any other object that was deemed dangerous in his hands by the Wizengamot. It's quite annoying really. Lucius can't cook because a knife isn't allowed. He can barely read anything without somebody examining it for hidden weapons. And one of the Aurors hit Lucius with a Stunner because he stood near the double doors that lead to the outdoors. Apparently, Lucius looked like he was planning to make a run for it.</p><p>He wasn't. Lucius was just looking at the doors in solemn sorrow. He can't leave his home. Sure, it's large and fancy and has all sorts of things to do in it. But sometimes all the space and emptiness is crushing. The only people Lucius ever sees are that Mind Healer he doesn't really like, the Aurors that he hates, and Narcissa who he loves dearly. Narcissa has always been there for Lucius, and he is grateful for that.</p><p>However, Lucius never sees Draco. His son who hadn't been born yet when he was captured and imprisoned in Azkaban for being a Death Eater. It had taken Lucius far too long to realize he had made a grave mistake. Lucius isn't sure how long it was before he realized he couldn't leave, before he realized there was no escape, before he realized he would never see proper daylight, never be happy, never see his wife again, never meet his son. And yet here Lucius is. Alive, well, and free. And he wonders to himself if it would be selfish of him, greedy of him, to want to see his son. How rude would it be to want to see his son when Lucius hadn't been there for Draco in all of these years? Surely Draco would hate him.</p><p>“Narcissa?” Lucius inquires quietly, half-hoping to be heard and half-hoping to be ignored. He is rather conflicted. He isn't sure which would be worst.</p><p>“Yes, dear?” Narcissa asks, looking up from her book. Her eyes draw him in, but he settles his stormy gray eyes on her lips, so deeply red and beautiful. Lucius fondly remembers how often in their school years when Narcissa would almost constantly be applying lipstick but still be able to make it seem intimidating to everyone. Everyone but him, of course. Lucius had found it endearing, and it wouldn't much do to be intimidated by his best friend. A best friend who had become his girlfriend, then his fiancée, and then his wife.</p><p>Lucius pauses to collect his thoughts and order them in a way that seems casual. However, this topic just isn't one that can be casual. He can feel it. The topic of their son has been skillfully avoided in a way that anyone else may not even know they even have a son. However, Lucius knows better.</p><p>“Where is he?”</p><p>“I don't know what you mean,” Narcissa lies seamlessly, casual and offhanded as if it were small talk. Lucius knows she's lying, and Narcissa knows that he knows.</p><p>“Narcissa, please,” Lucius begs, looking at her. However, Narcissa’s gaze is cast firmly down at her book, preventing their eyes from meeting.</p><p>“Truly. I'm just trying to read. I haven't an inkling who you speak of,” her voice doesn't waver, her fingers don't twitch, but Narcissa doesn't meet his gaze. His wife is an excellent liar, far more exceptional than anyone Lucius had ever met.</p><p>“Honestly, Narcissa. Is it really so bad that you can't tell me?” Lucius inquires harshly, his insistence that she tell him becoming annoyance that she won't. Lucius does his best to restrain for yelling.</p><p>Narcissa stays quiet, only flipping a page. Dread fills him as Lucius can only think of one such fate if she is reluctant to speak of it.</p>
