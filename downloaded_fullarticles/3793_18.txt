    <p>Her eyes didn’t remind me of anything. Her face never portrayed a dream unto human flesh, nor did she turn heads as she walked into a room. She was not attractive in any profound way, and to the naked eye, she was mediocre in every sense of the word.

I’ve watched them ripped from a woman’s throat in the heat of passion, I’ve witnessed them mumbled through tear-streaked faces; I’ve compiled the mental imagery of each and every time they were ever uttered my way.</p><p>But through all of the faces passing, she stood out the most. But why?</p><p>I haven’t the slightest.</p>
