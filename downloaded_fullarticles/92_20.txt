    <p>I'm kind of fan crazy over the idea of Top Harry Potter and have found that it's seriously lacking in that department, so I have decided to contribute to the amazing cause of giving Harry ample chance to raid some booty and build amazing relationships with every male character I've grown attached to and just wish would bottom on screen.</p>
<p>I'm not exactly a pioneer of television watching or an avid movie goer to be honest so if you all have any prompts you want fulfilled that I know nothing about I'll have to either watch the show or do some intense research.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The stories here will be as it says on the title, complete and utter Top Harry. I already have a couple pairing stories written out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Will include werewolf Harry, Master of Death Harry and other variations I want to squeeze him into. Mpreg or at least implied mpreg will be featured in some, I'm not too sure which level I want to push it to as of yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fandoms I am familiar with:</p>
<p>Harry Potter</p>
<p>Smallville</p>
<p>Teen Wolf</p>
<p>Vikings</p>
<p>Hawaii 5-O (2010)</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes</p>
<p>The Walking Dead</p>
<p>X-Men (with just a heavy focus on Logan tbh)</p>

<p>Marvel Universe</p>
<p>Venom</p>

<p>Feel free to drop me some prompts to help churn the old imagination pot.</p>
<p>I will update the relationship and character tags as the stories get added. The archive warnings may or may not change.</p>
