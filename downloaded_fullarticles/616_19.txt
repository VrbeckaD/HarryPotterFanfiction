          <div class="userstuff"><p>The first indication Connor Angel had that his interrogation of the<br/>newest batch of prisoners in the great wizarding war was *not* going<br/>to go according to plan was the chamber pot that bounced off his head<br/>as he strode masterfully through the dungeon door and the female<br/>voice that yelled in triumph, "SCORE!"</p><p>Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy hurriedly scrambled back out of the<br/>way as their friend stumbled backwards with a startled curse and then<br/>the boys ducked as the broken leg of what looked like a chair came<br/>hurtling out after Connor attached to a very, very annoyed brown<br/>haired girl who seemed to be intent on seeing just how hard she could<br/>stake their American friend with her impromptu weapon. "GET THEM!"<br/>The girl's voice was strident with purpose and fury and Blaise was<br/>astonished to realise that -- in sharp contrast to the prisoners he<br/>usually met � the rather skinny girl didn't seem to be at all alarmed<br/>to be the captives of the most feared dark wizard the world had ever<br/>seen. In fact -- from the rather feral grin on her face � she seemed<br/>to be quite enjoying herself.</p><p>Then Blaise was too busy trying to evade the blonde haired missile<br/>that had erupted through the dungeon door after the one currently<br/>doing her best to kill Connor and to process the fact that he himself<br/>seemed in imminent danger of getting a good smacking.</p><p>"MALFOY, YOU BASTARD!" Draco found himself gaping as he suddenly<br/>received an armful of spitting mad redhead, earnestly and single-<br/>mindedly trying to brain him with the chamber pot that had been<br/>discarded after it had bounced so dramatically off Connor's rather<br/>bruised forehead. "I'M GOING TO *KILL* YOU!"</p><p>Connor, meanwhile, found himself twisting and turning most<br/>ungracefully in a bid to avoid the original wielder of the chamber<br/>pot as she stabbed determinedly at his chest with her chair<br/>leg. "Murdering sons of bitches." Stab. "Sodding brown nosing dark<br/>wizarding lovers." Stab. "Arse licking poofy mommy's boy WANKERS!"<br/>Sta�"HEY!" The girl glared in outrage out of the eye that wasn't<br/>swollen and bruised in her face as Connor snatched the wood away from<br/>her and then delivered a lightening fast kick to his shin and a truly<br/>ferocious punch to his jaw. "Give that BACK!"</p><p>Connor glared back and resisted the urge to punch her other eye<br/>black. "You do know you're my prisoner, right? *I* give the orders<br/>around here, not you!"</p><p>The girl looked unimpressed and slapped him again, neatly dodging the<br/>grab he made for her with his free hand. "Bite me!" She turned into<br/>his body and slammed an elbow back into his mid-section with a<br/>grunt. "Twat."</p><p>Connor lost patience with the mad creature, dropped the chair leg and<br/>spun her around to swing one fist and clip her on the jaw before<br/>snatching her off her feet in a tight one arm hold as she crumpled in<br/>a dazed heap. "Crazy chick!"</p><p>"BASTARD!" The howl of rage from the girl that Draco had just managed<br/>to clumsily subdue echoed through the dim corridor outside the<br/>cell. "BLOODY, FUCKING�Mmmph!"</p><p>Draco smirked at Connor as he clamped a hand over the spectacularly<br/>foul mouth of the girl in his arms and tilted his head as he yanked<br/>her writhing body off the floor and braced her against his<br/>hip. "Feisty little bitches, aren't they?"</p><p>Connor snorted as he looked down at the limp body dangling over his<br/>arm, the clawing red-faced girl in Draco's hold and then finally at<br/>the girl hanging from Blaise Zabini's ears as she apparently tried to<br/>unscrew his head from his body with brute strength alone. "Blaise,<br/>just knock her out and get her back in the goddamned cell."</p><p>Blaise looked up from where he was staring into a pair of incensed<br/>blue eyes with a rather bemused expression and squeezed the two<br/>wrists he held in his hands wryly. "You may feel that approach works<br/>with women, Angel, I on the other hand deal with the opposite sex<br/>with a little more finesse." He cleared his throat and radiated<br/>goodwill as he looked down at his attacker once more. "My dear girl,<br/>all you are achieving at this particular moment is giving my poor<br/>ears some rather nasty little pinches with those ragged nails of<br/>yours. Now, I suggest you let go and go back into your cell like a<br/>good little prisoner and I'm sure with the minimum of fuss and<br/>threats we can bring this distasteful captive business to a swift<br/>conclusion and have you and your rabid little friends on your way to<br/>a much more suitable locale before nightfall."</p><p>The girl paused in her admittedly futile efforts, stared up at the<br/>man holding her wrists in an implacable grip, appeared to give some<br/>thought to his words and then brought her bony knee up to lodge<br/>firmly in Blaise's naively unprotected groin. "Actually I think I<br/>prefer the unlisted emasculate-the-smug-poncy-bastard option,<br/>thanks." She stepped back as Blaise let go of her wrists and folded<br/>in half with a satisfyingly stunned wheeze. "Yes, that's *definitely*<br/>the choice for me." Her knee came up again and met his face as he<br/>bent towards the floor. "You always were an insufferable git, Zabini."</p><p>Draco -- already fairly rattled by the sight of his friend so neatly<br/>dealt with � did a double take and recognition dawned as he got his<br/>first good look at the filthy female dervish that had *seriously* put<br/>a crimp in any plans for the continuation of the Zabini<br/>line. "*Lovegood*?!"</p><p>Luna Lovegood turned from where she was smiling gently at the sight<br/>of Blaise Zabini curled up on the floor and trying to cuddle his<br/>groin and his nose at the same time and looked serenely at Draco as<br/>though being taken prisoner and attacking former school mates<br/>happened to her every day of her life. "Hello, Malfoy." Her gentle<br/>smile widened as she reached under the rather bedraggled robes she<br/>wore and pulled out a chunky black metallic object. "Could you put<br/>Ginny down now please? I'd really hate to have to shoot you and these<br/>things really are *dreadfully* noisy."</p><p>Draco darted a bewildered look at Connor when the American cursed and<br/>backed up against the damp stone wall of the corridor and then looked<br/>back at Luna. "You'd hate to do *what*?"</p><p>Connor tightened his grip on the girl in his arms as she gave a low<br/>moan and started to show signs of coming out of her daze and glared<br/>belligerently at the baffled Draco. "I thought you said they were<br/>stripped of their weapons before they got tossed down here?"</p><p>Draco looked even more confused and eyed Luna in sudden<br/>wariness. "Well of course they were. First thing the Death Eaters did<br/>was take away their wands."</p><p>Connor rolled his eyes in annoyance. "And you didn't think it might<br/>be a good idea to take away the things that can blow a hole the size<br/>of a fucking *football* in your head at the same time?"</p><p>Draco frowned. "What's a football?"</p><p>Luna clucked her tongue in annoyance, kicked Blaise in the ribs when<br/>he started to show signs of reviving and waved her mystifying weapon<br/>through the air pointedly. "Look, as fascinating as this is, could we<br/>please just follow my demands and no one will be hurt." She had the<br/>grace to blush as both Connor and Draco darted extremely speaking<br/>looks at the male body lying at her feet. "Well, no more than they<br/>already have. Please release my friends."</p><p>Connor nodded at Draco as the wizard looked questioningly at him. "Do<br/>as she says." He took a petty satisfaction in dropping the girl he<br/>held against him on her skinny ass and grinned tauntingly at Luna as<br/>she scowled in condemnation at him. "Hey, just following orders�OOF!"</p><p>Luna smirked as she watched one deceptively fragile fist rocket up<br/>from the floor and make friends with Connor's groin. "Really? That's<br/>okay, looks like I'm starting a trend." She switched her still<br/>annoyingly calm gaze to Draco as Connor folded and joined Blaise on<br/>the floor with an inelegant honk. "I'm waiting, Malfoy."</p><p>Draco looked somewhat nervously down at his two friends on the floor<br/>and then down at the redhead clamped against his chest with sudden<br/>dark foreboding. "When you said Ginny, you didn't mean the littlest<br/>Weasel by any chance did you?"</p><p>Luna stopped looking serene and started looking positively<br/>gleeful. "Oh yes."</p><p>Draco closed his eyes. "Oh bugger." He forced himself to release the<br/>suddenly lax body he held and licked dry lips. "Look, Weasel, there's<br/>no need to�ugh!"</p><p>Ginny pulled her knee out of his groin and assisted Draco on his way<br/>to the floor with a sharp slap to the back of his head. "There bloody<br/>well *is*, Malfoy. There's *every* bloody need." She turned and<br/>grinned at her two companions. "Okay there, ladies? Dawn, you<br/>alright?"</p><p>Dawn Summers climbed to her feet and kicked Connor on general<br/>principles as she gingerly worked her jaw from side to side to assess<br/>the damage caused by his sucker punch. "Yeah, he hits like a girl."<br/>She kicked the Destroyer again as he wheezed in protest at this<br/>opinion of his legendary martial skills. "Doofus."</p><p>"We'd better get them back inside the cell in case anyone comes to<br/>check up on them." Luna stepped back and coolly sighted down the<br/>barrel of the gun as though she had been using it all her life. "Get<br/>them in here."</p><p>Ginny clapped her filthy hands together merrily and ruthlessly took<br/>the opportunity to get some equal opportunity kicking in as she<br/>treated all three men to a close up encounter with her small, eager<br/>feet. "You heard her, get moving, you pig swill!"</p><p>Dawn flashed an enquiring grin that lit up her dirt streaked face as<br/>she helpfully aided Connor in crawling on his hands and knees with a<br/>firm shove to his backside from her own foot. "Pig swill? That's a<br/>little medieval, isn't it?" She sauntered after three extremely sore<br/>evil doers and, going with the theme of the day so far, kicked it<br/>shut behind her as Ginny bent to relieve Draco and Blaise of their<br/>wands and then to frisk Connor for any muggle weapons as Luna covered<br/>her. "You're letting the dungeons get to you, sweetie."</p><p>Ginny sneered and backed away from the three men on the floor<br/>clutching two wands and several daggers in her hands. "Just think of<br/>me not so much as the damsel in distress, but more the damsel that<br/>distresses right back."</p><p>Connor finally stopped clutching his groin and glared up at his<br/>former captive through embarrassingly watery eyes. "Don't I know you?"</p><p>Dawn looked down and scowled most impressively considering her face<br/>was streaked with dirt and she still only had one working eye. "Your<br/>dad boinked my sister once."</p><p>Connor blinked. "What?"</p><p>"Dawn Summers, pleased to meetcha." Dawn nodded curtly and then<br/>flashed a radiant grin. "Well, not *really* pleased to meet you, more<br/>delirious about beating the *crap* out of you but you get the point.<br/>By the way, your dad is like *way* pissed with the whole working-for-<br/>the-dark-side thing you got going on here, broody Junior. Prepare for<br/>a *major* ass kicking when he catches up with you."</p><p>Connor blinked again, processed this new information and then<br/>muttered darkly, "This is exactly why I ditched you Californian<br/>freaks, you're all so fucking weird."</p><p>Dawn looked outraged. "*We're* weird? Who was it exactly who got in a<br/>little snit with his daddy and ran off to play with evil *incarnate*<br/>exactly? You *pussy*."</p><p>Blaise � keeping one careful eye on Luna and Ginny � tilted his head<br/>at Connor questioningly. "Is it me or is this day not going at all<br/>like we expected?" He flicked an appraising glance at Dawn and said<br/>sourly, "You do realise that you're our prisoners and that we hold<br/>your very lives in our stained and evil hands, ladies?"</p><p>Ginny, Luna and Dawn looked at each other, looked at Blaise and then �<br/>rather annoyingly � burst into highly amused giggles. "Yeah, like<br/>we'd let some second rate minion take *us* out!" Dawn chortled<br/>merrily as she leaned back against the wall and watched the three men<br/>climb to their feet and try and regain some of their somewhat<br/>tattered dignity. "Puh-lease. If anyone's going to be killing our<br/>asses then it's going to be head snake-boy himself." Dawn dissolved<br/>into giggles again at the wounded looks on the three male faces. "You<br/>three killing us�ha!"</p><p>Draco was feeling most put out and scowled his most menacing scowl as<br/>he said icily, "Actually, that's the plan. We were going to come in<br/>here, torture you horribly, make you beg for mercy and then�*will*<br/>you stop LAUGHING!"</p><p>Ginny waved a weak hand from where she slumped against the wall and<br/>moaned as her already slightly bruised ribs protested at the great<br/>whoops of laughter currently wracking her skinny body. "So�sorry.<br/>It's just so�so�"</p><p>Luna tried to bring her own mirth under control and only succeeded in<br/>snorting like a pig in a rather unattractive manner. "Rid�rid�<br/>ridiculous!" She snorted louder at the absolutely incensed expression<br/>on Blaise's face as he stood sulkily at Connor and Draco's side. "I<br/>mean, you three and the�"</p><p>"*Torturing*!" Nearly helpless now, Dawn bent slightly at the waist<br/>and wrapped her arms around her torso and stepped in when Luna ran<br/>out of air to speak and succumbed to a severe attack of the<br/>hiccups. "And the�the�begging for MERCY!"</p><p>Ginny toppled over and lost her grip on the recently captured wands<br/>as she collapsed on the floor. "US!" Tears streamed from her eyes as<br/>she whooped away on the grimy dungeon floor. "*Begging*!"</p><p>Draco scowled even harder and spat bitterly, "You know, you could at<br/>least *pretend* to be utterly terrified and in fear for your maidenly<br/>virtues."</p><p>The three girls paused briefly � hiccups from Luna notwithstanding �<br/>stared at their three opponents incredulously and then promptly fell<br/>about laughing again. Extremely loudly.</p><p>Connor ignored the wands lying on the floor, the extremely easy to re-<br/>capture daggers that Ginny was barely hanging onto and the gun that<br/>Luna was now dangling from one unsteady finger to lean back against<br/>his own wall and cross his arms over his chest somewhat<br/>petulantly. "Am I the only one starting to take this kinda<br/>personally?"</p><p>"No." Blaise was feeling decidedly snippy as he peered down at Luna's<br/>now scarlet face. "You'll do yourself an injury if you continue in<br/>this manner, Lovegood."</p><p>Draco tapped his foot in annoyance as Blaise's comment served no<br/>appreciable purpose in calming the hilarity in the room and he<br/>snapped, "There are a *multitude* of other Death Eaters upstairs, you<br/>know. We could quite easily shout for them and then you'd all be in<br/>very serious trouble."</p><p>Ginny's hand flapped pathetically in the air. "Merlin�don't." Draco<br/>looked momentarily gratified that his dire threat had worked where<br/>all the others had failed and then turned puce when Ginny continued<br/>to splutter, "You're going�to�to�*tell* on us?!"</p><p>Dawn whooped with renewed laughter and wiped her streaming eyes. "Oh<br/>God! That's so funny!" Her voice rose to a mocking whine. "I'm<br/>telling my evil masters you're being *mean* to me."</p><p>Luna fought valiantly past her hiccups to join in the mocking. "Sir,<br/>sir; the prisoners keep calling me bad names! Make them stop!"</p><p>Ginny nearly choked on her own tongue. "The warriors of the light are<br/>*cheating*, it's not *fair*!"</p><p>Thoroughly at a loss as to how they'd lost control of what should<br/>have been a fairly routine torture-the-helpless-prisoners-and-then-<br/>kill-them-horribly session, the three thoroughly bewildered targets<br/>of the mockery took refuge in dignified silence and waited as<br/>patiently as they could for the laughter to stop.</p><p>Plus � not that any of them would admit it � they were also<br/>reluctantly curious as to why the three captured females resolutely<br/>refused to show even a smidgeon of the proper fear that might be<br/>expected in their current predicament.</p><p>Eventually � tortuously � the giggles died away until the only sound<br/>in the cell was the rather harsh gasping for air from three<br/>overworked sets of lungs and the occasional stifled hiccup from Luna<br/>as she slumped in a heap against the wall and wiped the tears of<br/>amusement from her face. Blaise thought about glaring at her<br/>menacingly, ran the probable outcome through his head � more<br/>hysterical laughing and possibly more taunting � and instead settled<br/>for enquiring reasonably politely, "Are you quite done now?"</p><p>Luna bit her lip, tried to stifle another hiccup and nodded in the<br/>affirmative. "Yes." She hiccupped again and looked almost<br/>apologetic. "Sorry. All done."</p><p>Looking hopeful, Draco said warily, "I expect that was a nervous<br/>reaction, was it? The true horror and hopeless futility of your<br/>situation sunk in and you succumbed to an understandable fit of the<br/>hysterics."</p><p>Ginny bit her lip and swallowed another chortle. "Um, no. Not as<br/>such." She shrugged. "Sorry."</p><p>Connor took a much more direct approach. "You're all going to die.<br/>Painfully and slowly."</p><p>Dawn rolled her eyes, unimpressed. "No we're not." She settled<br/>herself more comfortably on the floor and flicked her long hair back<br/>out of her face. "We'll just get our breath back and then we'll get<br/>going. We promised a friend we'd be back by nightfall and he'll be<br/>really pissed if we're late."</p><p>Understandably, the three men were fairly taken aback at the calm<br/>pronouncement. Blaise coughed awkwardly. "Look, I hate to keep<br/>bringing this up, but you *do* realise that you're prisoners,<br/>correct? As in, you can't actually *leave* here."</p><p>Luna looked up from where she was rather mournfully contemplating the<br/>sorry state of her very first muggle manicure that she had gotten<br/>only that morning. "Yes, so you keep saying." She flashed Blaise a<br/>warm, understanding smile and continued in a reasonable voice, "But<br/>we really haven't got the time today and we really *do* have to meet<br/>someone tonight, what about we pop back in tomorrow about midday.<br/>Would that suit you any better?"</p><p>Boggle-eyed, Blaise stared at Luna and wheezed, "Pop back in? POP<br/>BACK IN?!" His hands flapped around at the ends of his arms with a<br/>little less than his usual grace and he practically howled, "This is<br/>the stronghold of LORD VOLDEMORT, you do *not* just POP IN whenever<br/>you feel like it!"</p><p>Luna blinked reproachfully. "Well you really should guard it a little<br/>better then. Honestly, we'd already strolled up three floors and<br/>tampered with your potions store before anyone even *noticed* we were<br/>here." She shook her head chidingly. "We are in the middle of a war<br/>here after all, Zabini."</p><p>Ginny watched with interest as Blaise made an alarming hissing noise<br/>and turned scarlet with rage. "Well done, Luna, I think you broke<br/>him." She smiled sunnily at the incoherent ex-prefect. "Excellent,<br/>one less slimy bastard to kill off come the day of reckoning then."<br/>She leaned over and slapped her friend on the knee encouragingly. "Go<br/>on, see if you can do the other two while you're at it."</p><p>Dawn grinned up at the silent Connor and winked saucily at him. "Hey,<br/>I'm up for it if they are."</p><p>Connor's eyebrows shot up so high they very nearly hit his<br/>hairline. "You think offering to *sleep* with us will make us let you<br/>go?"</p><p>Dawn's grin widened. "Nah, you're gonna let us go anyway, but you<br/>gotta admit it's a pretty tempting offer. We've seen the dogs you<br/>guys have floating around here pretending to be women, a little<br/>warrior of the light ass in the immediate future has to get your<br/>engines revving a little, right?"</p><p>Draco pressed a weary hand to his eyes and ignored Ginny's suddenly<br/>assessing look in his direction. "Right. Once more from the top. *We*<br/>are evil, *you* are not. *You* are prisoners, *we* are your captors.<br/>This does not bode well for future liaisons."</p><p>Dawn's grin melted into an unmistakable leer. "Ah, come on, think<br/>outside the box a little. Don't be so predictable. All the power you<br/>guys got between you and you can't think of *anything* better to do<br/>with it than to serve some skanky soon-to-be-dead guy?" She winked<br/>again at Connor and jumped to her feet in a sudden burst of<br/>energy. "We can be out of here and on our way to the light side of<br/>the force in under an hour. It'll be a hoot."</p><p>Draco looked terribly affronted and ignored the hoot comment. "I am<br/>*not* predictable."</p><p>Dawn rolled her eyes and bent to assist Ginny to her feet. "Yeah,<br/>sure. I've heard all about you, Dragon-boy. The big cheese in the<br/>snaky house at Hogwarts, heir apparent to the big-ooky Malfoy name<br/>and all around bad egg." The amused expression faded from her face<br/>and she tilted her head, suddenly serious. "Only it seems that every<br/>report we get about you from our intelligence network keeps telling<br/>us that you still talk the talk, but you're kinda slow on the draw<br/>when it comes to the whole rending of the innocent thing these days."<br/>Radiating approval, Dawn flashed a wide smile. "We *like* that in a<br/>guy. Big thumbs up from the side of good for the not bathing in the<br/>blood of virgins and sacrificing the helpless thing."</p><p>Blaise recovered from his near stroke with admirable speed and glared<br/>accusingly at Draco. "I *told* you someone was bound to notice all<br/>those bandages and healing potions being smuggled down to the<br/>dungeons one of these days, but did you listen? Oh no, not Draco<br/>bloody Malfoy. You just had to go and catch sodding humanity, didn't<br/>you?"</p><p>Luna smiled at his outraged face and interrupted smoothly. "Don't<br/>worry, Zabini, we were all *really* impressed with the way you helped<br/>Hannah Abbott escape from Flint last year when he caught her spying<br/>in Albania. She was singing your praises for weeks!"</p><p>Blaise's mouth shut with a snap and his eyes narrowed. "I did not,<br/>and I resent such an outrageous slut being cast upon my name! I'll<br/>have you know�" He shut up when he caught three knowing female smirks<br/>and folded his arms defensively across his chest as he avoided Connor<br/>and Draco's pointed looks. "Bugger. She said she wouldn't tell<br/>anyone."</p><p>Luna crossed the dungeon floor to pat soothingly at Blaise's<br/>arm. "She didn't tell everyone, just us." She smiled at Blaise's<br/>pessimistic look. "Promise. Everyone else still thinks you're a<br/>utterly heartless git."</p><p>"Hmm." Still unconvinced, Blaise allowed himself to be soothed by the<br/>rather ravishing female that Loony Luna Lovegood had grown up<br/>into. "Well, then. I suppose that's acceptable."</p><p>Connor glared in challenge at Dawn. "I don't do nice." He swept a<br/>condemning look over his two currently less-than-menacing<br/>associates. "*Or* mercy. I'm a complete ruthless bastard."</p><p>Dawn nodded in agreement. "I know, and that's *exactly* what our side<br/>needs." She paused and then remarked smugly, "Of course, it might be<br/>a *little* hard to convince the Ministry of that when they have the<br/>sworn testimony of twenty-three muggle children that the `growly man<br/>with the really strong arms' personally led them out of a blood<br/>sacrifice and then bought them all some sweets before dumping them at<br/>their local hospital and calling the police to make sure their<br/>families knew where they were."</p><p>Connor flushed to the roots of his hair. "I don't know what you're<br/>talking about."</p><p>Dawn smirked. "Whatever you say, Destructo-Boy."</p><p>Ginny laughed and crossed to the cell door, completely unconcerned by<br/>the fact that they still had to get past hordes of *definitely* evil<br/>wizards and witches upstairs and some rather nasty demons and other<br/>assorted evil-doers in the grounds. "Well, are you coming then?"</p><p>Blaise caught his wand as Luna retrieved it off the floor and flung<br/>it to him, made himself ignore the insistent niggle of interest as<br/>she flashed another one of her surprisingly seductive smiles and said<br/>grouchily, "Just don't expect me to start cosying up with bloody<br/>Potter and his adoring hordes. I may be a little more ambiguous about<br/>my loyalties these days, but I'm still a bloody Slytherin and damn<br/>proud of it!"</p><p>Luna tilted her head and said encouragingly, "Good for you!"</p><p>Draco caught his own wand as it flew through the air and bowed to the<br/>inevitable as he saw the astonishingly wicked glint in Ginny's smoky<br/>eyes. "My father is going to *kill* me."</p><p>Ginny grinned and said cheerily, "Not if Ron sees you first."</p><p>Dawn laughed at Draco's less than happy face as he followed Ginny<br/>from the cell and then turned to hold out a hand to Connor with an<br/>uncharacteristically understanding look on her face. "Come on. Time<br/>to go home."</p><p>Connor stared at her hand and then into her eyes. "Don't they say you<br/>can never go home again?"</p><p>Dawn paused and then took the step that Connor couldn't and caught<br/>his fingers with hers as she said, "Yeah, but I generally find<br/>that `they' are idiots. Let's go make them eat their words." She<br/>tilted her head and looked into his hesitant face mischievously. "And<br/>possibly their entrails too."</p><p>Connor stared down into her dirt-streaked face and muttered, "You're<br/>all crazy."</p><p>Dawn nodded and said with utter confidence and complete truth, "Yep,<br/>but you'll learn to love us." She tugged him out the door and looked<br/>back over her shoulder to add, "And you won't find a hotter piece of<br/>ass in any known dimension."</p><p>Connor stumbled, stared at said ass and then said the only reasonable<br/>thing he could under the circumstances. "So, seriously, just how mad<br/>*is* my dad?"</p></div>
