          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale starts in Romilda Vane's dorm room, she's talking to her girlfriend Alicia Spinnet.</p><p>Romilda asked, "So, why did you really sit next to me that day we met, Alice."</p><p>Alicia smirked. "It's rather silly when I think about it."</p><p>Romilda insisted, "Just tell me."</p><p>Alicia said, "I wasn't supposed to tell you this, but my friend Harry set me up."</p><p>Romilda laughed. "Harry Potter?"</p><p>Alicia nodded and smiled. "I was surprised too, Romey. Especially after the love potion chocolates."</p><p>Romilda retorted, "That never happened, remember? Those were just rumours."</p><p>Alicia muttered, "They were true though, weren't they?"</p><p>Romilda sighed. "Yeah, they were. I'm sorry."</p><p>Alicia reassured her, "It's ok, I kind of thought they were true, but I'm not annoyed. That was before we knew each other, so it's all in the past."</p><p>Romilda hugged her and promised, "I'll never lie to you again."</p></div>
