          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Here you go," Al said, handing Scorpius his ice cream.</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>It wasn't only the scorching heat of the day that made Scorpius crave for ice cream. He and Albus were out in the Muggle part of London and Scorpius had never tried Muggle ice cream before.<br/>
So now, he was holding his treat, licking the quickly melting ice cream.</p><p>"Huh." He frowned, as they walked down the street.</p><p>"What's up?"    </p><p>"It doesn't taste very melony."</p><p>Al snatched the dessert from his hand.</p><p>"Oi, I didn't say I wasn't going to eat it though!" Scorpius folded his arms, scowling at his friend. </p><p>"Mmm, melon actually tastes better than pineapple. You know what, you can have mine." Al shoved the ice cream to the blond, accidentally smearing some on his face. "Ooops... Sorry, Scor," he chuckled, seeing what he's done, then leaned in and licked the ice cream off Scorpius' chin, lips and nose.  </p><p>"Eat; before it melts." Al winked at him, placing his cone safely in the blond's hand, then turned and continued walking down the street. </p><p>Scorpius stood there for a moment, rooted to the spot, seriously considering smearing his ice cream all over his suddenly very hot face.</p></div>
