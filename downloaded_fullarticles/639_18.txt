    <p>The slow roll of the train as it rocked from side to side. The rails clacking, clicking, <em> shifting- </em></p><p>A constant vibration, but muted beneath her. The warmth of heating charms that were spread all around them until the compartments were uniform, but not stifling.</p><p>The train lulled Hermione into sleep. Deep, dreamless, and precisely what she needed after a nervous hour spent waiting on the platform. </p><p>Too many hours awake, too many moments where bile pulled and scratched at her oesophagus.</p><p>She needed this.</p><p>She <em>didn’t </em>need the splitting headache that greeted her when she woke up. The pulse and stab of a truly awful migraine announcing its presence-</p><p>
  <em> ‘Wait-’ </em>
</p><p>The train was stopped. Quiet. Slowly cooling off now that the charms were unnecessary, no students left to keep warm.</p><p>Besides her.</p><p>“Fuck-” Hermione lurched off the bench, nearly tripping and stumbling over the edges of her robe when it caught against the latch to the compartment.</p><p>
  <em> When had she changed? </em>
</p><p>No one was there to steady her as she slammed against the wall outside her chosen compartment. No one was there to see her stagger forward. Odd, that.</p><p>No one about. No one around. Empty, and quiet.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>Granted, if she managed to sleep through the others all leaving then this was her fault entirely. Nothing to worry about though; with all the others gone, none could feign closeness, point her out or whisper behind her back. None could wince and shoot pitiful eyes as she clutched at her head, leaked salt from her eyes, or stumbled over articulating what she meant. No one could feign closeness as she fought to prevent the aching pieces of her mind from collapsing back into some form of roaring nothingness. </p><p>This was… <em> bad. </em> Not bad enough for her to see Pomfrey, not nearly as bad as the migraines that the Time-Turner had forced her through-</p><p>But bad, nonetheless. A gnawing pit that hungered in the matter of her frontal lobe, something living and stalking about the edges of her consciousness with some form of active malevolence. </p><p>Similar to the Time-Turner, then. But not <em>as </em>bad. Not enough for her to seek help.</p><p><b> <em>Nothing</em> </b><em>was bad enough for her to seek help. </em> Even when it hurt.</p><p>Besides, it was nothing at all that a simple potion couldn’t fix right up. Or perhaps a night of rest within her own bed would do the trick. The one saving grace was that her hair remained pulled back, all neat and orderly despite the awkward position against the window that she had woken up to. That was a plus, however small.</p><p>But she was still late. Late for food, late for Minerva’s announcements, just…</p><p>Late.</p><p>But honestly, wasn’t that just how she preferred it? Her loneliness had gone from terror to boon, a soothing balm that she could spread beneath in the aftermath of-</p><p>Well.</p><p>
  <em> It. </em>
</p><p>The solitude was something hard-fast, something steady, something rock solid and immutable; something that would only be dictated or changed by her own choice. It was reassurance in the face of Harry, and then Ronald’s, departure from her life. Loneliness, her own form of salvation and penance-</p><p>-Hermione tripped out, one foot colliding with the other, nearly falling gracelessly onto the hard stone floor.</p><p>She was <em>inside </em>the Castle. Somehow.</p><p>She couldn’t quite remember when she had arrived; between the headache and her thoughts, that moment was lost to her. But she was here, and so that question could wait to another day, or never at all if she preferred. Clearly, she was distracted by multiple things, and the headache would not be ignored. Really, how on earth could one be expected to maintain their thoughts and active attention when their own mind seemed to have decided on revolution?</p><p>… When had the doorjambs gotten smaller? She could just about feel the stone arch as she passed beneath it and into a side hall, just low enough that it was obviously unusual. It appeared that Minerva had gone ahead with some further renovations over the summer holidays, probably some menial task that the older woman was using to keep the focus off of her own grief.</p><p>No matter. Or rather, nothing urgent about it. It could wait until Hermione had time to visit, perhaps tomorrow or the day after.</p><p>She was closing in on her room now, she was quite sure of it, even as her eyes squeezed shut under the total imbalance of pain thudding out across her skull. She could do this, right? Keep her eyes only half-open, only half paying attention, relying on memory alone. It certainly wasn’t that hard to navigate the complexity of the Castle. Yes, it had a tendency to rearrange itself according to some unknown whim, but no, there were patterns that one could pick up and memorize if they bothered to pay any attention to it all.</p><p>And Hermione had always been quite good at remaining observant.</p><p>---</p><p>Except in this instance, because against all odds she was somewhere else, again, without knowing what route she had taken. She couldn’t remember her steps, the walls, even giving out the password to the House Guardian.</p><p>She just… <em> arrived. </em></p><p>
  <em> ‘Was the walk always this quick?’ </em>
</p><p>Maybe… Maybe she had just not paid attention. Surely it could stand to reason that she was tired more than anything, dealing with this headache and the fog wrapping around her mind. No matter though, she was here, and so very ready for a nice few hours of rest. Hermione sighed, pushing the door inwards on hinges that thankfully remained silent.</p><p>That was one piece of good news, at least. The doors all being fixed, oiled, made just that little bit less annoying so that they wouldn’t stick of one opened it too fast-</p><p>-a hand reached out into the semi-darkness of the space, wrapping around Hermione’s wrist and all but pulling her inside the room until she collided with the owner. The door shut behind her with a muted slam; a charm or two in place to dull noise and sound, now that she realized it. <em> That </em>was why the hinges hadn’t made any noise when she had opened it, <em> that </em>was why she hadn’t even suspected anyone of being in her room. </p><p>With the door shut her only source of light was a fireplace barely burning in the corner of the space. It was small, barely more than lit embers, but enough to give her a general idea of where she was, and what was around her. </p><p>But not <em>who </em>was around her.</p><p>Instead, she could only take in that this person had decided to redecorate before pulling Hermione into the room. Instead of the twin-sized bed that she remembered from Prefect Orientation, there was instead an entire fourposter monstrosity placed up against one wall. Instead of her gold and red bedsheets, this new addition was decked in dark green, silken black, and the shimmering of silver that fell down as drapery. Where before she had owned a small bookshelf packed to the brim of titles both Mundane and Magical, there was now a vanity stocked with potions galore, and silvered cases for makeup.</p><p>Odd, that.</p><p>All of it, actually.</p><p>“What-”</p><p>The words were never able to properly leave her lips. They couldn’t, not really. Especially couldn’t, seeing as suddenly there was something placed in their way. Something warm, something soft; lips, as fresh as her own. A tongue that traced the outline of her lips, a quiet invitation that took inaction as acceptance, slipping into her mouth and suddenly forcing Hermione into what felt like a blissful calm. The hands that had been attached to her wrists were suddenly moving over her stomach, off to the sides, down to hold and squeeze against her hips and the tops of her thighs in soothing motions that brought a mewl to crawl up her throat.</p><p>Gods but this was all so - <em> wrong, sudden, </em> <b> <em>good</em> </b> - unexpected, but even as she wondered <em>why, </em> she returned the kiss. Battled tongue for tongue, breathed through her nose and damned if she couldn’t say she fought the desire to put a stop to it right then and there. A good choice, something in her complimented, when the body pushed forward yet again. This person, whoever it was, soon had Hermione with her back against the wall and palms flat to ground herself. She melted, heat on heat, so softly pressed and kept tight.</p><p>She grew bold after more seconds ticked by between them, pushing forwards and biting down upon a lip before suddenly sucking it into her mouth and roving her tongue across its plump surface.</p><p>
  <em> Foreign- </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Exciting- </em>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Different-</em> </b>
</p><p>Something in her seemed to wake, something that appreciated the sensuality and was now just telling Hermione to get on with it already, to enjoy herself and give in.</p><p align="right">
  <b> <em>“Harder-”</em> </b>
</p><p>The strangled edge of a moan managed to escape past her lips when the warmth of the interloper pulled away to take in air. It was the first instant that Hermione had to truly gaze upon this person, a chance to asses whoever this was.</p><p><em> Whatever </em>this was.</p><p>Hermione could easily say that she was no prude. She was also no stranger to the rather intimate manner of schoolyard courtship that ran amok on Hogwarts grounds. But up until this very point, she had held absolutely no awareness that someone was harbouring any feelings at all for her. Surely her early crushes had been few and far between; Harry, yes she knew he had a <em> thing </em>for her when they were younger. Ronald too had held feelings that he never learned to adequately express, even as he stepped away and waived off his seventh year in favour of service in the Auror Corps. Cho, maybe? Luna <em>might </em>have had a crush, once upon a time, but the younger girl was happily set up with Neville now, so it certainly wasn’t her.</p><p>And no other women had ever gone about searching for her in service to some pleasure or frivolities. She <em>should </em>know, after all. Mostly because she would have almost immediately taken them up after the odd offer or two.</p><p>So then who in the bloody Hell was-</p><p>-the woman before her rushed in again, the press of their bodies leading a flood of warmth to invade Hermione’s belly. She grunted, something soft but much more a moan than anything else, biting at her lip when those hands rose up to her midriff and began to roam. Something slick and warm began to coat the crux of Hermione’s thighs when the woman reached a hand underneath the hem of her dress shirt, fingernails dragging harsh marks across her skin until she could palm Hermione’s right breast.</p><p align="right">
  <b> <em>“More-”</em> </b>
</p><p>That odd sound rang out again, almost a voice, almost full words, so quiet and just barely there at the periphery of her awareness. It was a mystery, one she would quite like to solve.</p><p><em> After </em>she focused on the sinfully delicious feeling of warm fingers pinching down atop her nipple for all they were worth, an action now wringing pain - <em> pleasure </em> - from her throat. The gasp she meant to unleash was stifled by the woman joining their lips once again, teeth nipping and tongue pressing. Gods but it was-</p><p>One moment. One simple, barely noticed look.</p><p>Fleeting. But enough. </p><p>The vanity that was placed across from Hermione was nearly waist high and serviced with a short stool in place of a proper chair. The mirror itself was rectangular, taller up than sideways, and buttressed all around with a dark but patterned wood that appeared to be snakes intertwining with one another.</p><p>But the mirror in the centre, silver-backed and polished to a shine-</p><p>
  <em> Blonde. Blue eyes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘No fucking way.’ </em>
</p><p>The woman across from her-</p><p><em> Black hair, wild curls. Skin so white she </em><b><em>shined,</em> </b> <em> and eyes so dark they were voids- </em></p><p>
  <b> <em>Beautiful.</em> </b>
</p><p>---</p><p>“Narcissa?”</p><p align="right">
  <b> <em>“That’s us, you bloody imbecile.”</em> </b>
</p><p><em> ‘Oh? Is it really/ Because I wasn’t quite sure about it, but if </em> <b> <em>you’re</em> </b> <em> positive well then I guess that’s </em> <b> <em>us,</em> </b> <em> seeing as I could have sworn-’ </em></p><p>“...Cissa?” The woman who had her hand up Hermione’s shirt was beginning to look up at her - <em> them </em> - with something approaching suspicion, or perhaps something akin to mild confusion. Wonder maybe? Or worry?</p><p>The look was <em>something, </em> at any rate. And something that Hermione was most definitely not willing to unpack right then and there.</p><p>“Cissa? Can you hear me? Hello, anyone in there?” The hand that was up Hermione’s shirt came out, fingernails tip-tap-tapping against the soft skin covering her temple.</p><p>Hermione breathed in, steady and deep, trying to swallow back against the absolute desert that her throat and mouth had suddenly become. Gods she was <em> dry, </em> her tongue a useless lump of flesh so thick and heavy now that the woman - <b> <em>“Bellatrix.”</em> </b> - wasn’t supplying her with saliva.</p><p>“Oh! Um,” Hermione stumbled, attempting to ground her speech, “Oh, I’m… I’m fine! J-just a headache, that’s all.”</p><p>“Oh. Oh! Good, good.” The woman - <b> <em>“Bellatrix!”</em> </b> - stepped forward, pressing softly back into their space. A gentle kiss was placed upon Hermione’s lips, punctuated by the sharpness of a bite before she pulled back again, “I… Well, I just wanted you to know that I really, <em> really </em>enjoyed our time together over the summer. Thank you, for… Well, for not just hating me. I just want you to know that, okay? Merlin’s beard, I still can’t figure out how Cygnus didn’t catch onto us. Can you believe the old bastard actually left?!”</p><p>“Ha, yeah, that-” Hermione swallowed back, wondering just what in the ever-loving <em> Hell </em> this woman - <b> <em>“Bellatrix!!”</em> </b> - was on about. “-was close, wasn’t it?” She shot out a smirk, something unusual and probably stilted but surely even stilted was better than shock and confusion, right?</p><p><em> Bellatrix </em>smiled back at her - <em> them </em> - with clear love, adoration - <em> ‘Wait, </em> <b> <em>who?!’</em> </b> - in her eyes.</p><p>Gods. Hermione <em>knew </em>this woman! Or… Well, she knew <em>of </em>her at the least, and in this one instance that was just about as far as she was willing to take it.</p><p>Bellatrix.</p><p>Fucking.</p><p>Black.</p><p>The woman who had carved her <em>name </em>into her Husbands-</p><p>No, that thought was leading her nowhere but to a queasy stomach, and she would <em>not </em>be dealing with that right now. She most definitely did not need to be puking up all over her own robes-</p><p><em> Were they even </em> <b><em>her</em> </b> <em>robes?! </em></p><p>“Well then I’m glad you enjoyed yourself too, Cissa. Oh, and before you ask me, yes we’ll both need to be just a wee bit more circumspect now that we’re here an’ not home. Which I’m fine with, by the way.” Bellatrix stepped backwards, her face now worried and slightly frightened, “So long as you are, I mean. And we’ll both have to step up and see if we can get Andi back on our side at some point, preferably soon I’d suppose. She did look rather ticked off, didn’t she?”</p><p>Hermione froze up, mouth slightly agape and mind <em>blank. </em> One second, two, it just seemed to keep on going. She was unsure of herself, her voice, and whatever in Morgana’s Hell this girl was talking about.</p><p align="right">
  <b> <em>“Just fucking answer her already!”</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘That voice-’ </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <b> <em>“No, I am not a VOICE. I am Narcissa Black, and you are in. My. Body!”</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <em> ‘Oh no.’ </em>
</p><p>“Cissa?” Bellatrix waved a hand in front of Hermione’s face, staring at her quizzically with a lean to her head, “You’re doing it again, you know.” Bellatrix finished speaking and placed her hands back atop Hermione’s hips, rocking side to side and slowly palming down her midriff in soothing motions.</p><p>“Oh… Oh! I’m sorry Bellatrix, it’s just, it’s my- The headache again, my apologies. Andy, well, maybe she just wanted to join in, you know?” Hermione’s words were stuttered out in a half broken, half halting expression as her mind fought back against the roaring sensation now pounding against the back of her skull.</p><p>Narcissa.</p><p><em> Narcissa fucking Malfoy was in the back of </em> <b><em>her</em> </b> <em>skull. </em></p><p>Or, much closer to reality, <em> she </em>was in Narcissa’s. And somehow, someway, in charge of calling all the shots.</p><p>Bloody ridiculous, the lot of it.</p><p>Bellatrix seemed to have been appeased by her answer, the look upon her face suddenly turning into a lascivious smirk, body moving closer once again until she was pressed tight against Hermione’s skin. Their breath became stuttered loops, Hermione’s heart rate rocketing through the stratosphere when the other woman placed soft lips upon her neck, trailing soft nibbles and warm kisses up the column of her throat. Merlin’s beard, this was all getting very, very hard to ignore.</p><p>Especially seeing as Hermione seemed to have become unable to resist her own body’s responses.</p><p><em> Warmth; </em> a roiling pressure that filled out her limbs and set her heart aflame.</p><p><em> Soft; </em> a presence so inviting she could only just barely stop herself from reciprocating with treasured caresses.</p><p>She could just about melt into the strength of this woman-</p><p>
  <em> ‘No!’ </em>
</p><p>Hermione stilled herself with a monumental strain of effort, ready and willing to push the witch away so she could regain some semblance of normalcy amid this absolute insanity.</p><p>Bellatrix beat her to it though, pulling back with a smirk and bitten lip.</p><p>“Well! I think that means we should step up our plans for surprising her. Halloween should work well, not too soon but enough time to set things in motion. I’m sure we’ll come up with a rather inviting method, even if it manages to irk her to no end until then. And, if we’re right-”</p><p>Bellatrix leaned in again to press a chaste kiss upon Hermione’s lips, both of them shutting their eyes and soaking in the bliss of the action.</p><p>“-it’ll make it all just that much sweeter. Now!” Bellatrix pulled away yet again, a strangled whine caught within the confines of Hermione’s chest, “I’m off to bed. See you at breakfast, Cissa dear.”</p><p>And with that said, Bellatrix stepped past her in a flourish of robes and blown kisses, out the door and gone into the night.</p><p>“Oh bloody Merlin, what in the Hell is going on.”</p><p align="right">
  <b> <em>“No clue. But you better start talking, little witch.”</em> </b>
