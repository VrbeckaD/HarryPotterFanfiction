          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Potter," sneered Draco, "Look. I don't want to do this either, but if you don't <em>let me</em> teach you Occlumency then you're not getting to be an auror. And I won't get to go back to Hogwarts."</p><p>Harry snorted. "As if I haven't already helped you enough, Malfoy." His hand is still on his wand, wary. "For crying out loud, they have other Legilimens than you. I don't see why I even need to be taught this! The war is over."</p><p>"Maybe so, but the <em>Ministry insists.</em> The last thing <em>I </em>want to spend my summer doing is seeing your Oh So Wonderful thoughts, but here we are." Draco sat on the egde of Harry's sofa, looking haughtily around at the state of the home. "What is this place, a pig sty? Honestly, you'd think the Saviour of the Wizarding World would get more than this." Smirking, he turned his gaze back to Harry. "Let's just get this over with, alright?"</p><p>Harry's face twisted into a frown. "Uh," he fidgeted with his hands in his lap. "Uh, so, Snape tried to teach me this before. I'm not- not very good at it."</p><p>Malfoy looked disgusted.<em> "Lovely,"</em> he said, voice dripping with sarcasm. His plantinum blonde hair stayed plastered down even as he ran a hand over it. "Fuck, let's do the first lesson- and hopefully the last- now. I don't have all day you know, Potter. As I'm sure you don't, what with all your... <em>fans."</em></p><p>Harry growled. "Shut up!" </p><p>Malfoy's lip curled. "Alright, Potter. Clear your mind."</p><p>"Easier said than done," muttered Harry, but he tried anyway.</p><p>Draco's rolled his eyes dramtically. "Do you <em>have</em> to make a <em>face? </em>You look more constipated than usual."</p><p>Harry's eyes snapped open, and his concentration slipped. "What the fuck is your <em>prob-"</em></p><p><em>"Legilimens!" </em>yelled Draco, once he knew Potter was caught off guard. (After all, you never know when someone could cast that.)</p><p>Harry's eyes widened and he tried to remove his straggling thoughts from his head, but Draco had already succeeded.</p>

  <em>"Freak!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A small boy was curled up in a closet of some sort, a few poorly drawn pictures on the walls. A grate was on the door, and it slid open. A large face sneered through. "You thought about what you did, boy?" </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The boy's breathing quickened. "Uncle Vernon, I-"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No dinner," the man said. "If you're lucky, maybe at the end of the week. But next time you pull a stunt like this-"</em>
</p><p><em>"I didn't </em>do <em>anything!"</em> <em>protested the boy. "Please, I'm hungry! At least bring me some water."</em></p><p>
  <em>The man laughed. "Freaks don't need water. If you're really as powerful as you say, you should be able to get it yourself."</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>Draco pulled himself out of Harry's mind, head throbbing with unanswered questions. "What the <em>hell?"</em></p><p>Harry was backed into the wall, anxiously sliding to the floor. "Shit, shit, shit."</p><p>"Potter, who was that child?" asked Draco. He was angry. "I couldn't see who it was- you blocked out that much."</p><p>Potter breathed a sigh of relief, shoulders sagging. </p><p>"That just means you're <em>hiding</em> something," Draco snarled. He advanced towards Harry. "I thought you were the Golden Boy... I thought you were a <em>good person. </em>But abusing a child? Or, knowing a child is being abused and not doing anything about it?" Draco fumed, his face flushed bright red. </p><p>Harry's eyes were panicked. <em>"What? </em>No, I would never-"</p><p>Draco slammed his hand on the table. "Then who was it? We need to get that kid <em>out </em>of there, or something! The fact that you've waited this long... he could be <em>dead."</em></p><p>Harry's head dropped. "He's fine," he said quietly. "That boy... he's alive."</p><p>Malfoy laughed drily. "Maybe physically, sure. But mentally? Emotionally? Fucking hell, Potter, you disgust me! You never told <em>anyone-"</em></p><p>"MALFOY, SHUT UP!" roared Harry, falling back onto the floor. "SHUT UP! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! WHY WOULD I HIDE THAT FROM ANYONE IF-"</p><p>"Yeah," Draco screamed back, "Why the hell <em>would </em>you hide that? I'd like to know, Potter, I really wou-"</p><p>"-It's ME, alright, MALFOY?" shouted Harry, and then he froze, realizing what he'd said.</p><p>Draco's head whipped towards Potter. "What?" he said quietly.</p><p>"It- that boy, he's me, that's my memory, are you really that dense? You're a Legilimens, I would think you would have realized it was my memory..." Harry trailed off, hands beginning to shake."Oh, god," he mumured. He pulled himself to his feet. "I have to- I have to go."</p><p>He took a step, but stumbled, launching himself into the side of the desk.</p><p>"Bloody hell," began Draco, but his tone was no longer accusatory. "Sit down. You're going to hurt yourself."</p><p>"I have to go," he repeated. "You can't know about this- you can't-"</p><p>"Potter, just wait a moment, okay?" </p><p>Harry slid back down to the floor, too tired to fight anymore.</p><p>Hesitating, Draco sat down next to him. "What... was that?"</p><p>Harry let out a dry scoff. "My childhood, Malfoy. Not exactly the 'Saviour treatment' you expected, huh?"</p><p>Draco grimaced. "Yeah, I... whoa. Shit, I had no idea."</p><p>"Yeah, I know."</p><p>"I'm... er, sorry," he added. "I probably made that more stressful, with all the yelling- are you alright?"</p><p>Harry nodded, his pale face shining with tears. "I've been through worse, honestly. It's fine."</p><p>"It's not <em>fine," </em>argued Draco. "You were abused, Potter, I don't think you're <em>fine."</em></p><p>"It's been a long time, I'm over it."</p><p>"You just <em>broke down," </em>Malfoy reminded him. "How long has it been since you talked to someone about this?"</p><p>Harry glanced down at his shoes, one hand smoothing his raven hair down. "Never, I guess?"</p><p>Draco drew in a sharp breath. "Potter, you... you really should see someone."</p><p>"Why should you care?"</p><p>"Because I <em>owe you,</em> as you so kindly pointed out earlier. I can't not fulfill a life <em>debt </em>to the Great Harry-" Draco cut himself off. "-Er, I can't go back on my word. It's a pride thing."</p><p>Harry winced. "Well, I appreciate the thought, but seriously- we can just forget this ever happened. I'll tell the Ministry that I scared you off- you won't get in trouble, I'll make sure of that- and I was unable to learn Occlumency."</p><p>Draco shook his head. "No. I- does the Weaselette know?"</p><p>"Of course not."</p><p>"Weasley and Granger?"</p><p>"They know I had a bad relationship with my aunt and uncle, but they didn't know what <em>you </em>just saw."</p><p>Draco squeezed his eyes shut. "Potter, I can't just walk away from this. It's... that's not me. Maybe I would have three years ago, but... I need you to talk to someone about this, I need you to... I need you to tell <em>someone."</em></p><p>"Who would I even tell?" asked Harry softly, getting to his feet. "Ron and Hermione are going through enough, and Ginny's coping with Fred's death... this has no place in their lives right now."</p><p>Malfoy gritted his teeth. "Talk to me."</p><p>Harry looked startled. "Huh?"</p><p>"I <em>said</em>, talk to me. I have a therapist, I can give you their information. I just really think you should tell someone, Potter." He paused. "You know your parents would have wanted you to get help."</p><p>Harry staggered backwards as if he'd been hit. Draco steadied him by grabbing his upper arm gently.</p><p>"I'll even come with you, if you're worried about it," added Draco. </p><p>Harry straightened. "Alright, <em>fine,</em> I'll go."</p><p>They stood in silence for a moment, Draco heading towards the door.</p><p>Just as he was about to leave, Harry added "Malfoy? Why are you helping me?"</p><p>Draco stopped, hand lingering on the doorknob. "I told you. I owe you."</p></div>
