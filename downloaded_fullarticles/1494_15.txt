    <p>"Miss Hosterman!" said the teacher.Lynn looked up from where she was doodling and raised an eyebrow.<br/>
"Yes,ma'am?" she asked the teacher bravely.<br/>
"Mind telling me what our lesson for today is about?" the teacher asked,a disturbing smile on her face."Or were you too busy doodling?"<br/>
"Actually,our lesson is about Earth Science,ma'am." she replied.The teacher came forward and snatched the paper I was doodling from and crumpled it.<br/>
"Detention,Miss Hosterman." the teacher said grimly.Lynn rolled her eyes and the teacher continued with her lesson.Paying no attention to her,she tried to grab the paper from the teacher's desk.<br/>
Failed.<br/>
She produced a long object from her bag,wrapped in lavender silk,and revealed a wooden stick,with intricate markings and a smooth handle.<br/>
Carefully,silently,she pointed the wand and whispered the spell.<br/>
"Accio!"</p>
