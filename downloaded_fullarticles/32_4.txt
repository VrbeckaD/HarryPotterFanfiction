    <p>1.Hogwarts</p><p> </p><p>Nella wanted to get out of her home. All she ever wanted to go to school like all kids her age.<br/>
She wasn't ordinary, she had powers. She was an Elementar. It's a creature that possess powers of one element and witch/wizard powers.<br/>
Her family is very powerful. She was royalty, but never saw herself different than others. Nella wanted to go to Hogwarts, she even got the letter, but her parents wouldn't let her. She stayed at home with a private tutor.<br/>
One day, she had enough. She packed her things and snuck out of her house.<br/>
She had sent a letter to Albus Dumbledore, an old family friend, asking him to accept her this year. She also asked him not to say a word to her parents.<br/>
Dumbledore agreed, he even  arranged her school supplies.<br/>
All she needed to do was get on Hogwarts Express.<br/>
But before she did that, she needed to make up a fake last name and find some disguise.<br/>
Her hair was one thing that made her stand out and she didn't want that. Everyone would knew who she really is.<br/>
So, she bought herself a pair of glasses and a brown wig.<br/>
She boarded the Hogwarts Express.<br/>
Hopefully, her parents will think she's with her aunt visiting her relatives.</p><p>-------</p><p> </p><p>The train was full and Nella didn't know anyone. Everyone who passed her didn't even bother to look at her and she was grateful for that.<br/>All the cabins were full, except for one. In there were two boys with red hair, twins.<br/>Nella opened the door.</p><p>"Excuse me, everyone is full. May I sit here?"-she asked politely.<br/>
The twins smiled.</p><p>"Of course."-they said in unison.<br/>
She nodded.</p><p>"I have never seen you in Gryffindor. In which house are you?"-one of them asked.<br/>
She stared at them confused.</p><p>"We should probably introduce ourselves. I'm Fred Weasley."-the boy who asked her, said.</p><p>"And I'm George Weasley."-the other one said.</p><p>"We are twins."-they said together.<br/>
Nella laughed. </p><p>"I'm Nella Humphreys."-she lied.</p><p>"Nice to meet you, Nelly."-George said.<br/>
No one ever called her like that.</p><p>"So what house are you in?"-Fred asked again.</p><p>"I'm not in any house. I'm new, and starting third year."-she said.</p><p>"That's a shame. I thought you are with us."-George said.</p><p>"But, you will be with our brother Ron. He's a third year as well."-Fred said.</p><p>"Good luck with him."-they said.</p><p>"Why?"-she asked.</p><p>"Let's just say we are the best members of the Weasley family."-Fred said.<br/>
Nella laughed.</p><p>"You guys are amazing."-she said.</p><p>"Thank you."-the twins said.</p><p>"You are my first friends here."-she added.</p><p>"We are delighted to be your first friends."- George said.</p><p>"Don't get me wrong, I do have friends back home, but they are not like me."-Nella said.</p><p>"You are a Muggle born, aren't you?"-Fred asked.<br/>
Nella knew what Muggle born was, a person whose parents were not witch or wizard.<br/>
She nodded.</p><p>"Don't worry, you'll fit in Hogwarts."-Fred said.</p><p>"I'm just scared. I have been told there is this sorting ceremony and I'm the only third year taking it."-Nella said.</p><p>"We will be there cheering for you."-George said.</p><p>"Thank you, boys. That means a lot."-Nella said.<br/>
She got up and took some candies from her bag.</p><p>"Do you guys want some?"-she asked.</p><p>"Of course."-they said.<br/>
Just then, the compartments rattled. Lanterns flickered.<br/>
The train lurched, and began to slow down. </p><p>"What's happening? Are we there yet?"-Nella asked.</p><p>"No, something is wrong."-George said.<br/>
Fred nodded.</p><p>A black figure entered their cabinet. It was looking for something or someone. It looked like death.<br/>
The creature looked at Nella for a few seconds and left.</p><p>"Was that a Dementor?"-Nella asked.<br/>
The twins nodded. Nella sat between two brothers.<br/>
They put their hands on her shoulder.</p><p>"It's alright."-George said.</p><p>They finally stopped. They exited the train and there were carriages waiting for the students. Nella was with the twins. They arrived at the castle and she was blown away. Her home was big and beautiful, but this was breathtaking.</p><p>                                  -------
             
                                              

 The choir  was singing. They sang very beautifully. She wanted to join them.</p><p>"What should I do?"-Nella asked two Weasleys.</p><p>"Just wait until Dumbledore calls you out."-Fred said.</p><p>"You mean in front of everyone?"-Nella asked.</p><p>"Don't tell me you're scared?"-George asked.</p><p>"A little."-Nella said.<br/>
The boys laughed.</p><p>At the High Table, Lupin sat with Severus Snape, Minerva<br/>
McGonagall, Rubeus Hagrid and Albus Dumbledore. Argus Filch, Hogwarts' caretaker, stood grimly to the side as red-eyed Mrs. Norris switched her tail at his feet. As the choir's song concluded, Dumbledore rose, beaming over the sea of black hats.</p><p>"Welcome! Welcome to another year<br/>
at Hogwarts! I have a few things<br/>
to say, before we become befuddled<br/>
by our excellent feast."-Dumbledore said.</p><p>"Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to<br/>
welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who<br/>
has kindly consented to fill the<br/>
post of Defense Against the Dark<br/>
Arts. Good luck to you, Professor."-everyone clapped.</p><p>"Of course! That's why he knew to<br/>
give you the chocolate, Harry."-Nella heard a girl beside her said.</p><p>"As some of you may know, Professor<br/>
Kettleburn, our Care of Magical<br/>
Creatures teacher for many years,<br/>
has decided to retire in order to<br/>
spend more time with his remaining<br/>
limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted<br/>
to announce that his place will be<br/>
filled by none other than our own<br/>
Rubeus Hagrid!"-clapping continued.</p><p>Hagrid turned ruby red, rose, and nearly toppled the staff table, sending water goblets weaving.</p><p>"Finally, on a more disquieting<br/>
note, Hogwarts at the request<br/>
of the Ministry of Magic will,<br/>
until further notice, play host to<br/>
the Dementors of Azkaban. The Dementors will be stationed at<br/>
the entrances to the grounds. While<br/>
they are under strict orders not to<br/>
enter the castle itself, you will on<br/>
occasion see them as you go about<br/>
your daily activities. Under no circumstances are you to approach<br/>
them. It is not in the nature of<br/>
a Dementor to be forgiving."-Dumbledore said.</p><p>"And one last thing. We have a new student. She is starting third year, so she needs to be sorted into a house."-he added.<br/>
Minerva McGonagall came with a sorting hat.</p><p>"Nella Humphreys!"-she yelled.<br/>
Nella got up and everyone looked at her.</p><p>"Go on Nelly, you can do this!"-the twins shouted.<br/>
She was grateful to have them as her friends.<br/>
Nella sat on a stool and Professor McGonagall placed a hat on her head.</p><p>"This is interesting. You're a combination of every house. This is hard, very hard.<br/>
You're loyal like Hufflepuff, wise like Ravenclaw, but Sytherin and Gryffindor are much better choices for you.<br/>
You're very brave like a true Gryffindor yet you're a great leader material like a Sytherin. Better be...GRYFFINDOR!!"-the hat shouted.</p><p>Everyone clapped. George and Fred ran towards Nella and picked her up and twirled her around.</p><p>"The cute one is ours."-they said.</p><p>Nella couldn't be more happier.<br/>
She just hoped to make more friends. And she would have to tell them her secret.</p>
