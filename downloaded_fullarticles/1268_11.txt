<p align="left"> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t really care that this was the fifth time someone had come up to him. Or maybe people had been coming up to him all night? He wasn’t really sure. He failed not to be bitter about Ginny and this stupid fucking wedding. After all he’d had a crap life to start. At age two Harry Potter’s parents had died. It had been a car crash, he’d never learned the details, his Aunt had always made it known how much a burden he was. He had learned to stop questioning everything about his parents. And for some reason when he could find out the answers he still didn’t want to know. When he was ten his godfather visited, before having to go on a work trip. The idea that he wouldn’t have to live with his Aunt and her family was some type of hope Harry had never knew he wanted. Then his godfather got been locked up in Thailand for drugs. The press had a field day because apparently Sirius Black had been up in coming in the music world. Harry didn’t even get a chance to understand what was happening, his Aunt had blocked the solicitors and managers. By the time he was thirteen it had been a call during an appeals when Harry finally got to talk to him again. But it was that call that made Harry the man he was today. Because without that call he wouldn’t have found his parents other friends.</p>
<p>Harry found a family with Lupin and his wife. At first it had been weird, Lupin was obsessed  with training his service dogs and his wife worked with the police. Yet, going over their house every weekend was better then staying at home with his Aunt and her family. He found friends his own age- Ron and Hermione, Neville, Luna and Dean. It had felt overwhelming to have friends. Luna and Neville loved talking about nature, Luna lover animals while Neville love biology and plants. Ron was goofy and they’d play football with his family. Ron had six other sibling, and when the Lupins couldn’t see his for a weekend he’d go to the Weasley’s. Hermione of course was the practical one of their group, the leader who talked them out of trouble. And the one who helped Harry figure out his options when his Aunt and Uncle refused to help pay for uni.</p>
<p>Harry joined the army- a Potter first apparently. He figured after the army he could join the police force like Lupin’s wife Tonks. And then there was Ginny. Ron’s kid sister. Ginny, there were so many things about her to like. And now she had perky tits and a great ass. She got it when Cho, his first everything, dumped him. She got it when he would fight with his family. She got it when he was stuck between Ron and Hermione when they fought. She laughed with him when Ron dated Lavender, who no one really liked. She drove him to the airport for boot camp and promised to wait for him. Harry promised to write and they’d had their first kiss. She had been the light of his life. Harry had thought she would be his rock.  </p>
<p>“My sister, yeah?” Ron had asked. They’d been cheering her on at a football game. If Ginny’s team won then Harry got a blow job, if Ginny’s team lost he’d go down on her. She’d winked at him as she got out of bed. Harry had wanted to bend Ginny over and take her from behind, but he knew how important the game was to her. He’d kissed her instead and agreed to the bet.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Harry had replied. He waited for Ron to get upset but was surprised by his smile.</p>
<p>“Don’t fuck it up,” Ron told him. Harry nodded and they both turned back to the game. Ginny’s team winning in the end, Harry was only a little disappointed.</p>
<p>That had been that. The Weasleys had always thought of his as family and him dating Ginny had just seemed natural. Sure they fought now and then but they were happy. They moved in together, and it finally felt like home. Neville, Luna, Ron, Hermione and Dean would come over for hang outs and on Sunday they’d visit Ginny’s mum and dad for Sunday roast. Ginny changed clubs a couple of times before Harry came home with a scar across his face. His last deployment, because he’d served his country enough, Harry asked Ginny to marry him. Ginny said yes and they’d had the best sex ever.</p>
<p>He’d been deployed to Iraq under Moody. Then they were in Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and then Iraq again. The letters had felt like home, the sexy pictures a bonus. The other boys had someone waiting for them back home too. Even fucking Moody. They teased the each other about how tight their girl’s pussy was or what they’d do to them when they finally got home. They talked about kids and seeing green trees again. How shitty sand was, it was fucking everywhere, and when the Americans were going to finally pull their heads out of their asses. And then there was an IED and he came home.</p>
<p>Hermione had looked guilty and Ron sad. Ron had handed him the note. A fucking note in Ginny’s handwriting and the ring they’d bought together. Home to an empty fucking house. Half of the furniture gone. Hermione had driven him home from the airport- he’d thought Ginny wanted to surprise him or was at practice and couldn’t get out of it. Ginny had talked about the plans they’d make when he returned home for good. The house they’d move into, close enough to Ginny’s new club but not too far from London. Her last letter to him before he came home was about the blowjob she’d give him in the shower and how happy she was he was okay Harry; had been half hard thinking about her in the shower with him. He was excited to unpack, to study for the police exams and everything. But no, Ginny was gone, and no one had warned him.</p>
<p>“Mate…” Ron had began. Harry just stared blankly at him. He could feel the rage simmering inside himself.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Hermione began, “Ginny…well you being gone was hard on all of us and I think Ginny took it the hardest.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I thought…” Ron said but didn’t finish.</p>
<p>“Can you just go?” Harry asked. He wanted to be alone, to wallow in self-pity alone without people looking at him with pity.</p>
<p>“Harry…” Ron tried.</p>
<p>“She fucking knew. You fucking knew, didn’t you? Why the fuck would she keep writing me if she fucking knew? Why wouldn’t you have the balls to tell me your sister had dumped me for some tosser?” Harry asked. He couldn’t help the rage he felt.</p>
<p>“I…” Ron started then sighed. He looked lost but at that moment Harry didn’t give a flying fuck. He thought about the men he served with, some of them were back home now and they could go drinking together.</p>
<p>“Ron, we should go,” Hermione said.</p>
<p>Later Harry, after drinking and googling Ginny’s, name had wormed the information out of Hermione. Ginny had been traveling with the team- a hot sports writer liked interviewing her a little too much. Ginny hadn’t told anyone at first. Then she started introducing him as a friend from work to their group of friends. Ron had of course brought up Harry and Ginny was still wearing her ring. That changed when the IED happened, Harry hadn’t been seriously hurt but apparently that had been Ginny’s wake up call. She’d told Hermione first then Ron and then she just stopped wearing her ring. Everyone had noticed but didn’t know what to say. Hermione had had pity in her eyes when she told him. It didn’t help that two weeks after being home he got news about his godfather- he was being let out early due to health reasons. The unspoken word was cancer.</p>
<p>Ron had called and texted, but Harry ignored him. Ron was just another reminder of Ginny and the life he thought he’d have. Harry wasn’t sure what he wanted to do. He sold the ring- that the first thing to go. And then he’d gone to see her. Harry hadn’t been able to get out of the car, he just sat and watched Ginny. She had looked so happy, but then she’d looked so happy with him too. She lied to him for a year pretending everything was okay. Harry knew that if Ginny had told him she’d found someone else it’d hurt but he’d be okay. Or as okay as one could be after fighting a war for ten years. The guy looked like a pencil pusher. His hands had tightened around the steering wheel. He’d lost more than just Ginny; he’d lost a family. He couldn’t look at Ron without wanting to punch him in the face. Hermione always looked guilty around him. Luna was doing research at a Zoo in New York while Neville had moved to teach at some university up north. Dean was married and on baby number two.</p>
<p>Harry texted his army friends. They could drink to Moody and everyone else who they’d lost in the fight. He could tell them about Ginny and they would get it. Maybe they’d even have ideas about what he could do next, joining the police didn’t seem like a good idea. He thought about the Lupins and his godfather and how he could reach out to them. Seamus got back to him first. Remus and Tonks wanted him over for dinner one night and Sirius’ solicitor let him know what day he was due to fly back.</p>
<p>The pub was full of memorabilia from the Great War and World War II. Most of the regulars were other veterans, the owner Tom gave them their first glass free. Seamus arrived first followed by Cormac. Justin lumped in with Ernie and Terry behind them. They didn’t talk and sat in silence until Cormac asked about Ginny. Harry unloaded everything on them.</p>
<p>“Fuck that bitch!” Seamus said pushing another round his way.</p>
<p>“As Moody would say,” Justin began, “Constance vigilance!”</p>
<p>“To Moody!” Cormac said. He raised his pint and the rest followed.</p>
<p>“To that asshole Snape!” Ernie toasted.</p>
<p>Harry woke with a hangover but a better plan for what he wanted to do. Cormac let him know about an intelligence position with MI5. Harry liked the job, following the numbers, the people and learning about ISIS money fronts. It was easy to go to the gym and work out after looking at numbers and video feed all day. It was easier to forget about Ginny when he went out to the pub after work. Harry got to meet Teddy, the Lupin’s son. He was thankful for the Sunday dinners at the Lupin’s. It made saying no to the Weasley’s brunch much easier.  Harry was surprised by the insistence that he be Teddy’s godfather. He was also surprised how easy it was to keep Ron and Hermione at a distance. They always tried and Harry felt like a cunt half the time, but he wasn’t ready to see Ginny again. Sirius return helped keep him even more busy. His godfather was in failing health, but he’d probably make it. Life felt a little better. It was easier until Harry got Ginny’s fucking wedding invitation.</p>
<p>At first he was sure it was a joke. Harry called Ron for the first time in a year. Ron had seemed just as surprised and asked if he was going to go, Harry had no fucking clue. He texted Neville, Dean and Luna to see what they thought, if they were even going. Luna had emailed her usual animal video and facts along with the reply she was a bride’s maid. Hermione had emailed him that Ginny had wanted him to get closure. Dean seemed just as confused as he did. Neville had called and told Harry he was going but was baffled too. Ron was CCed into the email chain and asked Harry to go. He decided he would say yes but not go.</p>
<p>“I can book the hotel rooms?” Neville told the group chat. Hermione had gotten tired for trying to figure out the email chain and just added everyone on a group chat.</p>
<p>“That works for me,” Dean had agreed. Harry agreed too and Venmo him the money.</p>
<p>When Harry had shown up at the reception the whole Weasley family seemed to freeze. Ron looked pained and gave hm a nod while the rest of the family realized this was happening. Mr. Weasley hugged him followed by Fred and George. Mrs. Weasley had found Ginny and was whispering and pointing at him. Harry smiled, glad that he’d had a couple of shots before going to the reception. He wondered if the Weasley realized he wasn’t wearing his uniform- he couldn’t with the way things had ended with Ginny. Hermione was the first to greet him and the first to notice the smell of whiskey wafting off him. She tried to press a couple of crackers into his hand. Harry rolled his eyes and went straight for the bar. Dean noticed the stain; Harry didn’t remember how he got it. Neville lead him to his table all the way in the back, he didn’t know anyone but Neville as they put their stuff down. It was then he realized he was wearing trainers and not dress shoes.</p>
<p>Harry ordered himself another drink though, Hermione tried to stop him while Fred laughed. The meal, he only ate half, was okay. It was steak with garlic mash potatoes and French green beans, he bet Molly, Ginny’s mum, didn’t want people trying to have sex during the reception. The groom’s family kept staring at him when they thought he wasn’t watching. They all looked unhappy, the groom did too but Harry couldn’t be sure who was in fact the groom. The cake was carrot cake, not something Harry thought Ginny would have liked. He ate two pieces before realizing it also had coconut and raisins in it both of which he wasn’t a fan of. Then the speeches started happening. Mr. Weasley talked about Ginny being his little girl and Mrs. Weasley talked about how much Ginny had grown up. Harry couldn’t help a snort he left out during Ron speech which was how he found himself saying a few words, later Hermione would giggle about how he wrestled the microphone away from Ron.</p>
<p>“I use to date Ginny. We were happy, well I thought we were happy. But I must not have known her as well as I thought I did. When I got the invitation to the wedding I was surprised. I guess I’m that the bride and groom found each other. I hope their marriage last long and all that other bullshit. I hope Ginny doesn’t wake up in the middle of the night and realize it’s not working for her. Because marriage is hard. Harder then waiting for a boyfriend who’s off at war. That if you put in hard work you’ve got someone who will be a rock for you in your worst times, a person to cheer you on during your best. I guess we were on different levels of relationship! But if you’re happy then more power to you both!” Harry smiled because he could feel the tension in the air. He tossed back the champagne and watched as everyone else followed. Molly, Ginny’s mother, looked as if she was between crying and yelling. Fred looked ready to laugh.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Ron said. Harry raised his glass to Ron. His gift to the happy couple would be to drink them out of house and home. And then harry realized he hadn’t even brought a gift for he couple.</p>
<p>“That, ah, was a great speech.” Ron said before adding after a long awkward silence, “I didn’t think you were really coming.” Ron told him. He glanced to his right; Luna smiled at him. Harry decided then and there that tonight if he could still get an erection he was fucking Luna.</p>
<p>“I said I was,” Harry shrugged. Ron opened his mouth to say something but shook his head instead.</p>
<p>“Wonderful speech Harry,” Luna said.</p>
<p>“Thanks, you look beautiful,” Harry told her. Luna smiled before walking off.</p>
<p>“Harry!” Ginny smiled brightly.  Harry hadn’t actually thought about talking to Ginny tonight. He had wanted to wallow a little, judge her reception, get drunk and leave. Her smile was fake but maybe it wasn’t- maybe he didn’t know her as well as he thought.</p>
<p>“Ginny,” Harry replied. He failed to remember her husband’s name. Though he hadn’t really asked once they broke up either. He was tall and had dark hair and bright eyes. His hair was long, down to his shoulders that were broad- he looked like he should be fatter then he was.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you came. The speech was, ah, great. I don’t think you’ve met Michael yet?” Ginny said placing a hand on her husband’s arm. Harry tried not to scowl- he didn’t want to come off as that guy.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to finally meet you, I’ve heard so much about you. I thought I’d see you at the family brunch maybe?” Michael said. He seemed nervous, but Harry didn’t care.</p>
<p>“I’ve been busy working, government contracts you know how it is,” Harry shrugged. All three of them stared and Harry let the awkward silence go on. He hadn’t really said what he did for just job, just that he worked for the government. He wasn’t MI6 but MI5 was just as important.</p>
<p>“Yes, well when tax season hits it get mad doesn’t it,” Michael said. Harry wondered how good Michael was at his job if he thought Harry was an accountant.</p>
<p>“I’m sure,” Harry again shrugged. Ron coughed or tried to hide a laugh, Harry wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“We should probably say hi to the others,” Ginny said finally. She and Michael left leaving Harry with Ron.</p>
<p>“You should come to brunch. Mum miss you,” Ron told him after the couple left.</p>
<p>“Maybe, work does keeps me busy,” Harry told him. Ron frowned. Harry knew he had more to say. His friends always had more to say. They wanted to talk about everything. Was he interesting in going out on a date, she’s really nice. Or you’re going out to the pub again tonight? Or how are you dealing with being back home, do you need anything? Harry didn’t want to feel coddled.</p>
<p>“I get it, just remember your friends once in a while, yeah?” Ron asked. Harry bit back an angry retort about friendship and nodded instead. He thought about the IED and how he survived and coming home and finding out that nothing really mattered.</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know how he got back to the hotel. He had tried talking to Luna a couple of times, he was pretty sure he embarrassed himself, Hermione probably helped him because he vaguely remembered her talking to him. All he knew was that he was glad the wedding was on a Saturday. He could get some breakfast downstairs and then get back to London. Back to his empty flat, back to his problems and job. Back to trying to forget about Ginny and what could have been. He checked his email and mobile before heading for a shower. After a bloody mary and an English breakfast he left- he did text the group saying they should hangout again. He was glad they hadn’t added Ginny to the group chat.</p>
