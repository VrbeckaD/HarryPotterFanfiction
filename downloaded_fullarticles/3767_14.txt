          <div class="userstuff"><p>“You dimwitted fuck.”</p><p>“What the hell, Draco.”</p><p>“I told you not to tell Hermione what I was doing, you insensitive cunt.”</p><p>“It came out on accident, you prick. It’s not like I meant to tell her. Blaise and Ginny invited us all to the bar, and I had a bit too much alcohol and you know how I get.”</p><p>“Yeah, you get to be a loose lipped fucker, apparently.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Draco. I honestly didn’t mean too.”</p><p>“Whatever, thanks to you, she now knows.”</p><p>“I’m fairly certain she already knew, mate. You guys have talked about doing it before, I’m sure.”</p><p>“Of course, but that doesn’t downplay the fact that you fucked it all up, Theo.”</p><p>“She doesn’t know the details. All she knows is what you were doing.”</p><p>“Fuck, that’s true. Tell me one thing though, what did she do when you told her?”</p><p>“She was stunned for a minutes, then started crying hysterically muttering that she needed to see you over and over. That’s when Ginny started crying too.”</p><p>“Why the fuck was Ginny crying?”</p><p>“Some sort of girl code or some shit like that.”</p><p>“Was she upset with me?”</p><p>“I don’t understand female emotions or females in general.”</p><p>“I could have told you that, you utter shit head.”</p><p>“As I was saying, I don’t understand females, but my guess is that she was happy. ”</p><p>“Really, and why’s that?”</p><p>“After she stopped crying, she came up to me and slapped the actual shit out of me. She said and I quote ‘You cock sucking bastard, you just had to spoil the surprise. You had to open your mouth, huh?’”</p><p>“Can’t say I blame her.”</p><p>“At least you don’t have to stress about her saying yes or not, now.”</p><p>“Shut up, Theo.”</p></div>
