  <em>My dearest Credence,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I’m sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you. I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you. I’m sorry Grindlewald used you. I wish I could have done more. I should have fought harder; I shouldn’t have let him win. This is my fault. You deserved so much better. You went through more in your life than anyone should have to.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I hate that I couldn’t have removed you from your abusive environment sooner. You deserved to be loved. You deserved to live with people who cared about you. I really did love you Credence, more than you’ll ever know. When they told me that you were dead, I didn’t want to believe it. I still don’t. I could have helped you. I could have taught you. The Aurors overreacted. Ms. Goldstein and Mr. Scamander could have helped you. They could have taken care of you until I returned.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I hate that I couldn’t have done more for you. I hate that Grindlewald used you and shattered your trust and hope. My one regret is that I never got to tell you how much you meant to me- how much I loved you. I want nothing more than to make this up to you. I want nothing more than to make this right- to help you learn to trust me again.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I know Grindlewald took my face with the intention of using you to further his own cause. I hate that no one noticed I was missing sooner. I hate that this went on as long as it did. I don’t know how much longer I can work with these people. Ms. Goldstein told me that her and Mr. Scamander were able to help you and calm you down, but once the Aurors arrived, you were afraid and unable to control the obscurus. I don’t blame you. The Aurors didn’t know. They didn’t trust you. They weren’t willing to help you in the way Ms. Goldstein, Mr. Scamander and myself were. They saw you as a threat, and mistakenly saw the only solution as destroying you.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I know you’ll never read this, but I think this is more for my sanity than anything else. It also gives me an opportunity to tell you the things I was never able to. If there was anything I could have done differently to prevent this from happening, I would. I would have made sure Grindlewald had never taken my place, and that he had never touched you- never harmed you.   I would have taken you out of that toxic environment and stopped your suffering sooner. There is so much I regret, so much I should have done differently. You’re free of pain now, but not in the way that I ever would have wanted. You deserved so much more in your life. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Although you will never read this, I hope that you can recognize, wherever you are, that I do apologize, and I never thought any of this would happen. If you were still here, I would spend the rest of my life making this up to you. I’m sorry I couldn’t have helped you more than I was able to. You were a miracle Credence, I just wish others could have seen that. I love you Credence, and I miss you every day, and I hope that when we do see each other again, you can forgive me and let me make everything up to you.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Yours forever,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Percival Graves</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Graves was torn from his thoughts by a knock on his office door. He folded the letter up and put it in his top desk drawer before responding.</p>
<p>“Come in,” he said, just loudly enough for the person on the other side of the door to hear. The door opened, revealing Tina Goldstein.</p>
<p>“Sorry to bother you,” Tina said, walking in and closing the door behind her. She walked over to the desk and sat down in one of the leather chairs across the desk from him.</p>
<p>“Can I help you Ms. Goldstein?” he asked, looking up at her.</p>
<p>“Madame Picquery wanted me to come see how you were doing. This is only your second day back at work, and she’s worried about you.”</p>
<p>“She couldn’t have just come to see me herself?”</p>
<p>“She’s busy.”</p>
<p>“Busy? Or does she not trust me?”</p>
<p>It was no secret that the other Aurors around MACUSA were more cautious around him than they were before. Graves didn’t blame them. They probably thought he had been manipulated by Grindlewald and no longer had the best interests of the department in mind anymore.</p>
<p>“I- I’m not sure Mr. Graves.”</p>
<p>“You don’t trust me either Ms. Goldstein?”</p>
<p>“With all due respect Mr. Graves, no one knows what Grindlewald really did to you. The healers aren’t sure, and you’ve refused to say.”</p>
<p>“Can anyone blame me for not wanting to talk about it?”</p>
<p>“No sir, but a lot of Aurors think you’re hiding something.”</p>
<p>“Do you?”</p>
<p>“Do I what sir?”</p>
<p>“Think I’m hiding something?”</p>
<p>“No sir. I think you’re not talking about it because you want to forget about it.”</p>
<p>Graves sighed. She was right. He would do anything to be able to forget what Grindlewald had done to him- the torture to get information from him, the starvation, and the cruciatus curse. He wanted to forget the cruciatus curse the most. He wanted forget the pain.</p>
<p>“The only reason I was able to put up with as much as I did was because I wanted to protect Credence. My one regret is that I wasn’t able to do that. I know you and Mr. Scamander tried, but I guess there was nothing you could have done.”</p>
<p>“You did everything you could to help him, to protect him, and Newt and I did as well. In the end, I guess the Aurors just saw him as too much of a threat.”</p>
<p>“He’s dead because of me.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true Mr. Graves. The Aurors acted in a way they felt would be the most beneficial to both the wizarding and no-maj communities.”</p>
<p>“Did they really think the best way to do that would be killing a frightened young man who didn’t know what was happening?”</p>
<p>“They must have thought he did know. I do agree with you though, they should have given him a chance, tried to help him.”</p>
<p>“They had no idea what he was going through. They never took the time to learn.”</p>
<p>“I know you’re upset with how the Aurors dealt with Credence Mr. Graves, but what’s done is done, and at this point, there’s really nothing we can do.”</p>
<p>“Credence didn’t deserve this.”</p>
<p>“And I agree with you. I just wish we could have done more,” Tina said, standing up to leave. “I’m sorry, I don’t want to keep you any longer.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it Ms. Goldstein. I needed the distraction.”</p>
<p>“Let me know if there’s anything I can do to make your life easier while you readjust to work.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Ms. Goldstein.” Graves said, looking down at the massive pile of paperwork on his desk. “I may take you up on that offer,” he added, looking back up at her.</p>
<p>Tina smiled and walked over to the door and opening it, turning back to Graves before she left.</p>
<p>“Let me know, I don’t mind paperwork most of the time.”</p>
<p>Graves nodded. “Thank you Ms. Goldstein.”</p>
<p>Once Tina had left and closed the door behind her, Graves opened the drawer and pulled the letter back out. He opened it, looked over it one last time and folded it back up, sticking it in his coat pocket.</p>
<p>Graves picked up his wand and put it in his other pocket, then walked over to the door. He opened the door and walked into the hallway, closing the door behind him and making sure it was locked. Sighing, he walked up the stairs into the lobby of MACUSA. He didn’t want people to know what he was doing, <em>especially</em> not any of the Aurors who had been directly responsible for Credence’s death.</p>
<p>“Where are you going Mr. Graves?” Graves heard a voice behind him call.   Silently groaning, he turned around and sighed.</p>
<p>“Out Abernathy,” he snapped, sounding harsher than he intended to. “Sorry,” he added more softly when he noticed Abernathy tense up. “I’m still a bit on edge.”</p>
<p>“That’s alright, Mr. Graves. How long will you be out? I think Picquery wants to talk to you later.”</p>
<p>“Tina already came by to check on me for her, so unless something has come up in the past ten minutes, I think I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Abernathy nodded. “I’ll let you be on your way.”</p>
<p>Graves turned and left without another word. As irritating as Abernathy could be, he did have his moments. He walked quickly to avoid confrontation with any other MACUSA employee. Fortunately, because of the Grindlewald incident, people seemed to avoid him.</p>
<p><em>‘The only good thing to come out of this damn ordeal,’ </em>he thought to himself, walking out the front door and into the busy streets of New York.</p>
<p>The ceremony for Credence had been small, only Tina, Queenie, Newt and himself. They seemed to be the only ones who believed that the Aurors had acted prematurely. The cemetery was not too far from MACUSA headquarters, so he could easily walk. It was a nice day anyway, it would have been a shame to waste it.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the cemetery, he walked to the back where Credence was essentially buried. There was no body, so the group elected to bury a box with photos instead. When he arrived, Percival knelt down and conjured a bouquet of dark blue carnations to place on the grave. He took the letter out of his pocket and placed it gently next to the flowers.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Credence,” he whispered, staring at the ground. That was all he could think of to say. He didn’t think there was anything else he <em>could</em> say. Graves found it to be calming, kneeling next to what memories remained of the man he loved. Even though he had been taken off the Grindlewald case, he vowed to get revenge on the man who had taken Credence’s trust, built it up, then broke it with a few simple phrases. He had given Credence someone he could trust- someone who actually cared, then caused him to go back to feeling like no one had ever cared. It was that information that gave him the motivation to go back and fight, and the motivation to find and destroy Grindlewald, with or without MACUSAs help.</p>
