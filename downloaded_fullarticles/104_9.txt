  <strong>Marriage arranged, does it exist in these times? Is it legal? They were your thoughts on the way to the burrow, which was quick, in a matter of seconds your parents and you, were transported to the door of the same. At the door they were awaited by Molly Weasley, the same woman you knew since your birth and while you were growing up, they were neighbors of your parents and great friends from before your birth and until you had to move when you turned 7.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Molly greeted your parents effusively and invited them to come in, when she saw you wrapped in a big hug, “look at yourself y/n you have become a beautiful lady”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Thank you Mrs. Weasley”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Tell me Molly, but come in,” She said as she pushed you inside and into the living room of the already familiar burrow, there was Mr. Weasley who talked happily with your father, there was also a young man and a redhead girl younger than you.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Ron? Ginny? The two turned to see you and went to hug you</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Merlin I almost don’t recognize you,” said Ron</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“I don’t think you did it the last time I saw you, you were 4 years old, I think,” Ginny and you laughed while Ron just shrugged.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Y/n” Mr. Weasley approached to greet you “how much you grew, how was the trip?” You were going to respond when a voice interrupted</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“No, I will not do it, it is stupid, this can not be legal” there is, you thought, the person who at this moment ruined your existence, Merlin even his voice was irritating</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Fred, bring your brother right now”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“It’s what I try” Molly smiled nervously and turned her head back to the stairs “come down right now because if you make come up it won’t end well for you” at that moment a young, thin and tall redhead appeared in the middle of the room, which carried with him an exact copy of himself, the only thing that differentiated them was that the one who was trying to flee desperately, lacked his left ear, although his hair was a little long which hid it.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“I’m not getting married, it’s a barbaric act, you can’t force me to do it”</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Apparently they can and believe me I’m not happy with this” looking at him from top to bottom you turned your eyes, and seeing his face of discontent it was as if you couldn’t hate him more, “marry someone I don’t even know” when you said this everyone looked at you with a strange face, “Fred?” you asked, the twin? You assumed, who had released his brother and approached you nodding his head</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“You remember me” you turned your eyes smiling</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Is it one of your jokes?” You hugged him “we grew up together of course I remember you” to which he only nodded.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Well, I don’t want to marry a complete stranger and less you,” you felt your blood boil, if it wasn’t because your mom intervened you would probably have hit her stupid face</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“Why we don’t sit down and calm down a bit” your father nodded and while they sat down Molly was already conjuring cups with tea and cookies to the table in front of you.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>The thing was like that, a week ago when you turned 24 it was one of the best days of your life, after having worked for a good magic magazine in the USA you had finally got a job in one of the newspapers that you admired since you were a young girl, The Daily Prophet, of course you would have to move to England, away from your family and friends, but that was not a problem in order to achieve your dream, also in the magical world the other side of the world was just around the corner. Anyway, your day could not be more perfect after receiving the news you would have dinner with your parents, your little sister was in her penultimate year at Ilvermorny but you had received a package full of things for your birthday, it could not be more perfect, true? But when you arrived at your parents’ house you came across a story that changed your life 180 degrees.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Apparently when you were little your parents and the Weasleys had a very close relationship, they spent a lot of time together, which made you spend your life growing up with the Weasley brothers, your parents used to make dinners that included both families, apparently in a of them, your father and Mr. Weasley took a little too much firewhisky so they thought it was a good idea to make an unbreakable vow, an oath in which their families would join, an oath that included a marriage between George Weasley and you, when your mothers found out it was too late, so the deal was that when you turned 24 that it was shortly after he did, their lives would come together, you didn’t know what bothered you most of all, the fact that your father decided 20 years your future no matter if maybe there was someone for you at that time, not that there was but it could have happened, the fact that you could not change it, or that nobody could, was an oath, it was unwavering, or the fact that you could remember the Weasley brothers one of them some vaguely, but George’s name was not one of them. When you said this to your parents were too surprised, they said it was impossible, since you had been best friends since your birth.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>From what you could understand about George Weasley, he was a Weasley evidently, he had a twin, Fred whom you could remember, he was your age, he hated the idea of an arranged marriage, just seeing him bothered you, and just like you he had no idea of your existence until this day.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>While youe parents explained in detail to the other brothers and to you who already knew the basics, that you two had to marry, George looked at you as if he wanted to make your head explode with his gaze, and you were something, something that could be called stubborn or proud , so you did the same thing as him, hoping with all your strength that if you looked at him with determination, his head would explode into millions of pieces, something bloody but just seeing him generated annoyance in you.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“So the date was set that two months after the birthday of y/n the marriage would take place,” your mother said somewhat nervously, the oath that your father had taken with Mr. Weasley, did not seem funny as well to Molly. They bothered too much, but deep down it was something that they also wanted to happen, although not in that way. After a few moments when you realized what your mother had said, you shouted “two months ?!” that was something new, something that you had not been told and apparently George did not know either, because he just stood upset and He disappeared from the room. Fred got up sighing</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“He probably went to the apartment, I’ll try to talk to him,” he said as Molly looked at him pleadingly and just as his brother did disappeared. All eyes were on you</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>“I’m leaving, I have to look at the apartment I will live in” and without saying anything you got up and left the burrow, upset you appeared in Diagon alley, you had previously been there looking for places to live for your new job, although you already knew what from your marriage, you thought that if you ignored it too much it would disappear, maybe it was a joke, maybe a nightmare, but when you arrived at your new home and started unpacking your things, you knew it, everything was true and there was nothing you could do In less than two months you would get married.</strong>
