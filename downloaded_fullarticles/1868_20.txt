    <p>The night that Harry defeated Voldemort wasn't the only extraordinary thing that happened. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were in Dumbledore's office for a debriefing when Hermione jumped up and cried,</p><p>"Snape!"</p><p>"Hermione, what are you talking about? Snape's dead." Harry said, perplexed.</p><p>"I think you'll find that Severus is alive. He's being treated in the hospital wing." Dumbledore countered with that famous twinkle in his eye. Upon hearing his reply, the three simultaneously bolted from the office.</p><p>"He's alive." Minerva was in the hospital wing, and answered the silent question of her three students.</p><p>"Remus went down to the shrieking shack to come after you three. He found Severus on the floor, and brought him tot the hospital wing. Once Severus awakes he can fix himself." Hermione walked over to his bed. He looked younger, but there were puncture wounds where Nagini had bitten him. They would never go away.</p><p>"I managed to contain what poison there was, but since most of the horcruxes were gone Nagini wasn't as strong. Her death has weakened the poison as well." Madam Pomfrey said.</p><p>"Ugh!" Everyone turned around. Hermione who was right beside his bed looked down at him. Snape opened his eyes and frowned.</p><p>"20 points from Gryffindor." Then he was asleep again. The first one to break the silence was Ron.</p><p>"Hahaha! Did you hear him? '20 points from Gryffindor.' Hahaha, Well one things for sure, there's no brain damage." Minerva smiled at this.</p><p>"Come on you three, lets give him some room."</p><hr/><p>Â "Ugh!" I groaned and opened my eyes. Wait, that means that I wasn't dead. I blinked, Miss Granger was hovering over me. Great, I must be in hell I thought.</p><p>"20 points from Gryffindor."</p>
