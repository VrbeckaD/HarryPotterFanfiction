    <p><b>Day 1:</b> A World of Darkness</p><p>‘Have you heard?’ someone whispers. ‘Apparently the Scorpion King was found in the lake. We have no idea what he was doing there, but I heard he was acting like a mad man. Asking about Harry Potter and about his son.’</p><p>‘About his son?’ the other girl asks, her voice not as much of a whisper - loud enough for half of the library to hear it.</p><p>‘Yes. He was asking about Albus Potter.’  </p><p>The boy with the red brown hair jerks his head up, he pushes his glasses further up his nose. He looks at the two girls sitting at the table next to him, who are completely ignoring the sign telling them they’re supposed to be quiet in the library. He narrows his eyes as he tries to listen in on their conversation, but it’s being cut off by the librarian shushing them. He bites his bottom lip, repeating their words over and over again in his head. The Scorpion King was asking about Harry Potter. The Scorpion King was asking about Harry Potter’s son. Albus Potter. </p><p>He quickly pushes all of his books back into his bag, straightening his black coat as he stands up before hanging the bag from his shoulder. With his chin up in the air he walks past the tables. Students are staring at him, whispering his name as he walks past but he ignores them. His shoulders broad, his back straightened and his chin up in the air. Glaring down at everyone that dares to look at him. </p><p>‘For Voldemort and Valour,’ he says as he passes the Librarian, who repeats after him - left hand over right, wrist on wrist, closing hands and twist. His hands are still balled into fists as he walks out of the door. </p><p>He’s walking through the corridors, passing everyone with long and hard strides, giving them no time or reason to speak to him. The Scorpion King asking about Harry Potter and his son, Albus Potter, is the only thing he can think about. A flurry of blonde hair appears at the end of the hallway. </p><p>‘Malfoy!’ he shouts.</p><p>The tall, blonde boy in front of him turns around. His eyes and mouth open wide in surprise. His hand covering his mouth before taking a few steps closer. </p><p>‘James?’ His voice is high, filled with surprise and relief. </p><p>‘Don’t you dare come any closer. Why have you been asking about my little brother?’ James’ voice is cold and distant as he glares at Scorpius. </p><p>‘Listen James-’</p><p>‘Don’t call me James, Malfoy,’ James advances towards Scorpius, pulling himself to a stop when they’re nearly nose to nose. ‘We’re not friends and we have never been friends. Everyone knows that. I just want to know why you-’ he pokes Scorpius in the shoulder. ‘-have been asking about my father and little brother.’</p><p>Scorpius flinches, his hands fidgeting and his breathing becoming rapidly faster. </p><p>‘I’m-’ his voice fades away as he takes in a shaky breath. ‘I’m not who you think I am. I’m not from this world. Is Albus- Albus is he-’</p><p>‘What are you talking about?’ James grunts, growing more frustrated with every second passing that he’s around his boy. ‘Is this one of your games again? Because I’m not playing along. You may have everyone in this school wrapped around your finger. You may have everyone fooled, but not me. Don’t you dare come near my brother. You hear me?’</p><p>James hoists his bag up on his shoulder and makes a turn. He starts to walk away when a hand grabs his arm. In a quick movement he turns around, his wand pointed at Scorpius. Scorpius who is now- </p><p>‘Why are you on the floor?’ James groans, his wand still pointed at him. </p><p>Scorpius lets out a whining sound as he lowers the arm in front of his face. His eyes are wide, but no longer full of surprise, they’re filled with terror as he looks at James’ wand. His face is pale and his hands are shaking. James lowers his wand, looking at the boy on the ground. The Scorpion King never cowers away from a duel - or a normal fight for that matter. He doesn’t tremble when someone points his wand at him. James knows that all too well, as he and Scorpius Malfoy had gotten in quite a lot of arguments. </p><p>‘Please,’ he whispers. ‘Please, listen to me. I need to talk to you. I’m begging you.’</p><p>James sighs as he closes his eyes, rubbing his temple with his free hand. ‘Fine. Meet me in the Hall after dinner.’</p><p>‘Won’t anyone hear us?’ </p><p>James’ eyes flick open. ‘Stop asking questions, Malfoy. Just meet me in the Great Hall.’</p><p>He can see Scorpius swallow as he scrambles up from the ground. Footsteps approaching them when two students round the corner. Yann Fredericks and Karl Jenkins stop walking, looking from James to Scorpius. James quickly puts his wand back in his cloak, not wanting to attract any attention. </p><p>‘Hey, Scorpion King!’ Karl runs up to him as Yann puts his hand on Scorpius’ shoulder.</p><p>‘We’re still on right, tomorrow night?’ he asks, giving Scorpius a knowing look. A smirk on his face as he looks Scorpius up and down, his hand sliding down his arm.</p><p>Scorpius seems to shrink a little under his touch, confusion on his face, confusing James as well. He’s fiddling with the sleeves of his black coat as he looks from one of the guys to the other one. </p><p>‘Because we are ready to spill some proper mudblood guts!’ Karl groans, pretending like his own guts are spilling out of his stomach. </p><p>Scorpius nods slightly, an uncomfortable smile on his face that disappears as soon as the two students carry on. </p><p>‘Albus is he-’ Scorpius wants to ask James something but is interrupted by a female voice calling out his name. </p><p>Polly Chapman comes up to Scorpius. James clears his throat, catching Scorpius’ attention again. ‘I will see you right after dinner. Don’t be late or I’m gone.’</p>
<hr/><p>James is leaning against the wall in the Great Hall. His arms crossed in front of his chest as he looks through his glasses at everyone that passes him. Most of the students don’t pay attention to James. They used to bother him about his parents a lot, asking about their deaths because headmistress Umbridge forbid the students to speak about that and because it’s forbidden, of course everyone talks about it. It took James a while to get them to back off, to leave him alone. He glares at a student that meets his eyes, he nearly trips over his legs trying to get away from him as fast as he can. </p><p>Someone stumbles into the Hall and James watches Scorpius Malfoy walk up to him. He watches him. His face is pale, his hair’s a mess and there’s dark circles under his eyes. As their eyes meet James sees fear and insecurity in them, a fear he has never before seen in the Scorpion King’s eyes. His shoulders slump and he looks as if he wishes nothing more than for the ground to swallow him whole. To just disappear. Scorpius Malfoy looks like an entirely different person. But then again, the Scorpion King had tried to fool James more than once, which usually ended in them dueling. Though he won’t admit it, he had never won a duel against James. But then again James spent most of his time training, perfecting his dueling skills, trying to get better and better. The Scorpion King? He usually let others do his dirty work. </p><p>‘You look horrible,’ James says, his voice deep and low. Most people would describe it as threatening, most people usually make sure they get away from him as soon as possible when he speaks like that. </p><p>‘They have been checking me for hexes and curses all morning. I <em> feel </em> horrible,’ Scorpius mumbles, not looking up at James. ‘I feel like I might start throwing up any moment.’</p><p>‘Please do it the other way.’</p><p>For a moment they’re silent and none of them move. In the distance there’s people whining, begging for help - all coming from the dungeons. James has learned to ignore it for the most part, though he still feels a pang in his heart whenever he has to go down there, knowing there’s nothing he can do for the innocent people that are being locked up. He starts walking to the grand staircases. </p><p>‘Those screams,’ Scorpius’ voice is barely a whisper as he catches up to James as they walk through the hallway leading to what used to be the Gryffindor tower. ‘Those screams and these people begging for help. Who are they? Why- Why are they here?’</p><p>‘As if you don’t know,’ James huffs. </p><p>He sees the boy next to him cringe, his arms wrapped around his chest as he shivers. ‘I know, I heard that supposedly it was my idea. That I came up with this. But- But what <em> is this </em>?’ </p><p>James stops in his tracks, turning towards Scorpius. Standing so close to him that their noses almost touch when the blonde looks up to him. ‘What kind of game are you playing here, Malfoy?’ he hisses. ‘You know I’m not a fool and you’ve tried to play me more often than not. You know I’m not going to play along with your stupid games and I don’t have time for this nonsense. I don’t even know why I agreed to meet up in the first place. It was your idea to put these muggleborn students down there. To practice torture spells, hexes, every possible spell that can hurt a person. This was your idea and this is your fault.’ </p><p>James shakes his head as he takes in Scorpius one last time. His grey eyes looking into his, trying his best not to look away, to hold James’ glare. His hands fidget at his sides as his breathing seemed to quicken - turning into shallow breaths. James fears that if he doesn’t start to control his breathing now, he might pass out. </p><p>‘I-’ Scorpius takes a step back, his hand on his chest. ‘I don’t- This isn’t-’</p><p>James watches him as he leans against the wall with his hand as his other fumbles with the buttons on his black coat, trying to loosen them. </p><p>‘I can’t- I can’t breathe,’ he wheezes as his other hand joins in, trying to get his coat off. ‘I’m not the Scorpion King. This isn’t me. I’m not-’ </p><p>He loses his balance, his back slamming against the wall. James instinctively jumps forward, trying to catch him but Scorpius slides down the wall, to the floor. </p><p>‘Put your head between your knees,’ James commands him.</p><p>Scorpius nods slowly, putting his head between his knees. James gently puts his hands on Scorpius’ knees, squeezing it softly.</p><p>‘Now try and focus on something. Just one thing. Like my hand on your knee and breathe. Don’t stop breathing.’</p><p>For a moment they sit there. Both boys on the floor of the empty hallway as James waits for Scorpius to calm down and breathe normally. </p><p>‘I’m sorry,’ Scorpius whispers as he looks back up again. ‘I’m so sorry. For everything.’</p><p>‘What are you talking about?’ </p><p>‘All of this is my fault. This whole world. It’s my fault,’ he chokes on his words, trying to hold back his sobs as he buries his face in his hands.</p><p>James lets out a deep sigh. <em> What have you gotten yourself into James? </em> Is all he can think about before turning his attention back to the boy in front of him. ‘Okay, come on. Let’s go somewhere we can talk.’</p><p>He walks further into the hallway and looks behind him. Scorpius is still sitting on the ground, looking at James, doubt and fear in his eyes. </p><p>‘Listen, you were the one that wanted to talk to me,’ James says. ‘This is your only chance. If you don’t come now, I’m leaving.’</p><p>Scorpius scrambles up from the floor, quickly following behind James, not wanting to think about being on his own in the castle right now. They climb through what used to be a portrait hole, into a room. A room that’s torn apart, curtains ripped apart on the floor, wooden chairs and tables torn to pieces. It’s a mess. But the ray of sunlight that comes in through the stained window falls onto a crest. The crest with a lion on it. It’s the old Gryffindor common room.</p><p>‘We’re not supposed to be here, right?’ Scorpius asks softly. </p><p>‘We’re not supposed to be here,’ James confirms as he gestures for Scorpius to take place on one of the chairs that’s still standing.  </p><p>Scorpius sits down, his hands wringing in his lap as his left leg bounces up and down. His eyes are exploring the room as James crosses his arms in front of his chest. He looks down on Scorpius, his eyebrows raised, waiting for him to start talking. After a minute of waiting, Scorpius looks back up. </p><p>‘If you could change the world, would you?’ Scorpius asks. </p><p>James gives him a confused look, not sure what the blonde in front of him is talking about.</p><p>‘If you could change the world into one where there wasn’t this much darkness? A world where the death eaters never won and Voldemort never ruled. Would you do it?’</p><p>James presses his lips into a fine line, not sure what Scorpius is on about and not sure if this is a trap. If James answers and he does turn out to be playing a game with him, he could be in great trouble. </p><p>‘Your silence says enough,’ Scorpius whispers and he reaches his hand into his pocket. </p><p>James closes his hand around his wand, ready to pull it out, depending on what Scorpius is reaching for. A shiny trinket appears from his pocket and he holds it into his hands for James to see. </p><p>‘What if I was to tell you that there was another world. A world in which Voldemort was defeated at the Battle of Hogwarts, in which Harry Potter and Dumbledore’s Army won, how would you feel then-’</p><p>‘Why do you have a Time-Turner?’ James narrows his eyes as he looks at the Time-Turner in Scorpius’ hand. ‘And why does it look this odd?’</p><p>'You know about Time-Turners?'</p><p>'Why do you sound so surprised?' James grumbles as he looks up at Scorpius again.</p><p>‘I- I'm not-' Scorpius stumbles over his words, shrinking under James' cold gaze. 'I'll just answer your first question. Albus and I stole this from the Ministry of Magic, from the Minister for Magic. We used it to go back in time, to try and change it. To safe someone, but-’</p><p>‘You and Albus, as in my little brother Albus, stole a Time-Turner from the Minister for Magic? And you used it to go back in time? Do you know just how unbelievable this sounds?’ </p><p>Scorpius cringes in his chair, holding the Time-Turner tightly to his chest. ‘I know. I know it sounds unbelievable. But I’m going to need you to listen to me, please?’</p><p>A deep sigh escapes from James’ lips and he rolls his eyes. ‘Fine, go on.’</p><p>Scorpius tells James everything. About Albus telling Scorpius about the Triwizard Tournament, about Amos Diggory coming to visit them and begging Harry Potter to bring his son back. To how Albus convinced Scorpius to jump off the Hogwarts Express, how they broke into the Ministry of Magic and got the Time-Turner. How they went back in time a second time because they didn’t change what they intended to change. They didn’t save Cedric. Ending with how he ended up in this world, a World of Darkness.</p><p>‘So, let me get this clear. You two went back the first time and didn’t get the result you wanted? Though it did get you in quite some trouble, right?’ Scorpius nods at James. ‘So then you both thought it would be a brilliant idea to go back in time <em> another time </em> and with that you killed off pretty much all the people that were fighting against Voldemort and made sure he won?’</p><p>‘When you say it like that it does sound really, <em> really </em> bad,’ Scorpius mumbles, his face scrunched up in guilt and shame. </p><p>‘I need you to tell me some more, in detail. So you and Albus in this other world?’</p><p>‘Albus, he’s my best friend in this other world. Truly one of the kindest people I have ever met. We met the first day on the Hogwarts Express. See there’s this rumor going on in the Wizarding World that I’m supposedly- That I’m the son-’ Scorpius takes in a sharp breath.</p><p>‘That you’re the son of Voldemort.’</p><p>Scorpius looks up at James. ‘Yes, that- that rumor, yes. It's crazy isn't it? Me the son of Lord Voldemort? Ah!' He pulls a face but James shakes his head, shutting him down again. 'So that rumor is still the same in this world?’</p><p>James nods. ‘It is. It’s one of the reasons people fear you as much as they do.’</p><p>‘Great,’ Scorpius mumbles, focusing his attention on his hands again. ‘That’s wonderful. I mean I guess it’s a good thing they fear me here, because back in the other world people bully me. They write ‘Son of Voldemort’ on my trunk, shout the most horrible names at me. It’s horrible and-’</p><p>‘Malfoy, focus on the story please.’</p><p>‘Oh- Yes sorry. I guess we’ll skip the whole Albus and me becoming friends part as well then,’ Scorpius says before he tells James everything about when they went back to the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, how they disarmed Cedric. How they went back to the present and Albus had gotten hurt. How their father had told Albus to stay away from each other. To their fight in the library and them deciding to go back in time once more.</p><p>‘Then I lost Albus,’ Scorpius whispers. ‘I lost Albus in the lake before I went back in time. As soon as I realized he was not with me, I decided to do it on my own. I used the Engorgio charm on Cedric and humiliated him. We were certain that it would fix everything, that it would bring back whom we've lost and it would be alright. But then when I emerged from the lake it wasn't and I have no idea why the world turned so dark. How did all of this happen? How did Harry Potter not defeat Voldemort and how come he now rules?’ </p><p>James puffs his cheeks, taking in everything Scorpius had just told him, before releasing all air again. Scorpius looks at James, waiting for him to explain to him how this happened, ready to hang onto every word the older Potter brother will tell him. </p><p>'We're really not allowed to talk about my-,' James takes in a sharp breath as he looks around the common room once. 'My parents. Especially my dad. If we get caught-'</p><p>James stops talking and Scorpius swallows. 'What happens if we get caught?'</p><p>'It doesn't matter. Voldemort was able to survive because they did not destroy one of the horcruxes. They weren’t able to kill the last horcrux, the snake.’</p><p>‘But professor Longbottom was supposed to kill Nagini. Is he-’ Scorpius voice fades, shock and horror on his face thinking of his professor back in his own world. </p><p>‘Neville Longbottom? He died. He was killed by Cedric Diggory,’ James answers. </p><p>Scorpius gasps. ‘That’s it. Professor Longbottom was supposed to kill Nagini. That was the one horcrux they still needed to destroy for your father to kill Voldemort. For your father and the rest of the wizards that fought with him to survive and win the war,’ Scorpius runs a hand through his hair. ‘But how did your parents manage to survive?’</p><p>‘I don’t know much. The home that Albus and I ended up with had strict rules, no one could speak of the people that fought against Voldemort and his army. All I know is that a lot of people didn’t survive. My parents and a few of their friends managed to get out of there. I heard there was a man that sacrificed his life to save my father's life, he jumped in between him and Voldemort. He used to work at Hogwarts, his name was Hagrid.’</p><p>‘Hagrid is still alive in my world,’ Scorpius says. Thinking of the big man that makes him and Albus tea whenever they come visit. Hagrid has always been incredibly kind and welcoming towards the two boys, even when everyone else wasn’t. ‘He gave up his life for your father. That’s brave.’</p><p>‘I guess I owe my life to him. My parents went into hiding. Much like my father’s parents did when he was just a little baby. But the death eaters found them. They were killed and we ended up in a home for foster children.’</p><p>Scorpius gasps. ‘I’m so sorry. I need to fix this. I need to fix this for all of us. But I’m afraid I can’t do this on my own.’ He looks at James, his eyes pleading. ‘Please James. You seem to know the school very well. Please help me fix this? Imagine a world where Voldemort is defeated. Where he doesn’t rule.’</p><p>James rubs his face with his hands before crossing his arms on the table. Leaning forward as he stares at Scorpius. His eyes searching the boy’s face before looking into his grey eyes. </p><p>‘Why should I trust you, Malfoy? Give me one good reason why I should help you to try and fix all that you’ve just told me?’ James looks at Scorpius, challenging him, not sure whether he truly believes everything this boy has just told him. </p><p>‘Do it for Albus and for Lily Luna,’ Scorpius answers, his eyes never leaving James.</p><p>‘I don’t know a Lily Luna. Who is Lily Luna?’ </p><p>‘Lily Luna Potter is your little sister.’</p><p>‘I don’t have a little sister,’ James whispers, clenching his jaw. </p><p>‘Not in this world you don’t,’ Scorpius also leans forward onto the table, holding James’ gaze. ‘In the other world you do. Lily Luna Potter, she’s born after Albus. She’s the third Potter sibling. She looks a lot like your mother. Her hair’s as red as hers, her eyes as warm and brown, just like yours and Albus’. </p><p>She’s fierce, she knows exactly what she wants and she knows exactly how to get it. Both you and Albus have a really bad soft spot for her, you give her everything she wants. You can’t say no to her. But she’s got a big heart of gold. She can light up a whole room when she walks in. She’s kind, caring and loving. Her smile is so contagious that everyone smiles along with her. One time she stood up for me to a few seventh year students. She didn’t care they were twice as tall as her, that they could hex her in a heartbeat. She didn’t hesitate and called them out for their behavior. For a girl as small as she is, she’s got a big personality. I admire her for that. There should be more people like Lily Luna Potter. </p><p>But most of all, she adores you, James. She won’t leave the Great Hall at breakfast without giving you a hug, wishing you a wonderful day. You carry her on your shoulders on the warm summer days spent outside. You help her with her homework, though I feel like she could teach you more than you can teach her,’ Scorpius and James both chuckle softly. ‘She truly is a bright, young witch. Do it for her. Do it for Albus. Do it for your parents.’</p><p>James takes a deep breath. ‘I need some time to think about this, Malfoy. I-’</p><p>Two voices sound from the hallway and two boys stumble into the common room. James and Scorpius look up, James ready to grab his wand and use it when he sees who entered the room. </p><p>‘Albus, what are you doing here?’ </p><p>Albus stops in his tracks. Behind him Karl Jenkins bumps into him, his face flushed and a wide grin on his face. His face turns a brighter red when he sees James who narrows his eyes at him. He averts his eyes towards Albus, waiting for him to say something.</p><p>Next to him James hears Scorpius gasp for air. The blonde jumps up, nearly tripping over his own feet as he makes his way to Albus. James holds his breath as he watches the two boys. Scorpius reaches his hands out to the raven haired boy, not sure whether he wants to hug him or just touch him - to see if he’s real. To see if he’s really here. Before he can decide, Albus slaps his hand away. His normally warm and kind eyes now cold and distant as he looks at Scorpius.</p><p>‘What is your problem, Malfoy?’ his voice is venomous, his face scrunched up in anger. ‘Don’t touch me. Don’t you ever touch me.’</p><p>Scorpius flinches visibly, taking a big step back as if he’s just been hit in the face. James jumps up, quickly coming over to the other three boys. He glances at Scorpius who looks like he’s about to burst into tears - to Albus.</p><p>‘Albus,’ his voice is stern as he stands in front of Scorpius. ‘Take it easy.’</p><p>His eyes meet James’ and there’s anger in his face, so much anger. ‘Don’t tell <em> me </em>to take it easy, James. Not when all you’ve been doing is picking fights with everyone. And now you’re up here, where we’re not even allowed to be, and you’re together with Malfoy.’ He spits Scorpius’ last name as if it’s something dirty. </p><p>James puts his hand on Albus’ shoulder but his brother shrugs it off, taking a step away from him. </p><p>‘What the fuck, James?’ he hisses at his brother, his face red from the anger that’s surging through his veins. ‘His family killed our parents.’</p><p>James casts his eyes down, a sigh leaving his lips. He can hear Scorpius shift behind him. A few seconds pass before he looks back up again, at his little brother. Albus would never admit it, but James can see the hurt in his eyes. The hurt he still feels when thinking of his parents. Hurt that he can never show around anyone else. But James can see it, he always can for Albus is his little brother and he knows that look all too well. It’s the look he sees when he looks at himself in the mirror. </p><p>‘Albus, it’s not like that-’</p><p>‘I know James. It’s probably none of my business, right? It never is.’</p><p>Albus turns around, grabbing Karl’s hand before storming out of the room. James goes to follow him, but changes his mind when his brother yells at him to leave him alone. He takes off his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose with his thumb and index finger. </p><p>‘Are you okay?’ James mumbles as he puts his glasses back on his face. </p><p>He turns around, facing Scorpius - who looks paler than he usually does, almost as if he’s going to throw up any minute. Grey eyes stare into his, but there’s no sound when he opens his mouth. James frowns, if Scorpius hadn’t convinced him that he is not the Scorpion King yet, seeing how upset he is now definitely would. </p><p>‘That’s not Albus,’ Scorpius whispers, more to himself than to James. </p><p>The older Potter brother can’t help but feel sorry for him. He said Albus is his best friend in the other world, the best person he has ever met. To see him like this, hear him talk to him like that, must be hard. But he has no idea what to say or do to comfort the boy in front of him. Albus was right, Scorpius Malfoy’s family did kill his parents. <em> His parents </em>. And though the boy in front of him is from another world, he can’t help but think about it every time he looks at him.  </p><p>‘Who was it?’ Scorpius voice is barely a whisper. ‘Which one of my family members did it?’ </p><p>James bites down on his bottom lip before meeting Scorpius’ eyes again. ‘Your father.’</p><p><br/>
