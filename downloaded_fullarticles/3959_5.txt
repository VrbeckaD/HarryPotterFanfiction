  <span>Scratchy sheets. The overpowering smell of new paint. The moon shining through the new window and pooling on the freshly laid wood. Percy rolled over onto his side, not used to the hard, king size mattress. The only thing that was keeping the demigod from completely losing his mind was his wife sleeping next to him. A new house, a new baby sleeping next door, and a new job waiting for him in the morning. Annabeth, at this point, was one of the only things he was familiar with. He rolled out of bed, padding silently down the hall to the kitchen, and collapsed into a kitchen chair they had bought and put together yesterday.  How was he going to do this? How in Tartarus was he going to be able to juggle not only a new house and a new job, but a new </span>
  <em>
    <span>baby</span>
  </em>
  <span> as well? Percy buried his head in his hands. What if he ended up just like Poseidon, leaving both Adrian and Annabeth alone? Or worse yet, what if he ended up like Gabe?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He glanced up, not surprised to see his wife leaning against the door frame, concern etched into her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Percy? What’s going on?” She stepped forward, coming to sit next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grabs one of her hands and squeezes it tightly. “I’m just worried, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Worried about what? We have a beautiful house, great jobs, and I just had a baby. What is there to be concerned about?” She sounded genuinely curious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s just it though!” Percy stood up, his chair screeching against the wood slightly. He paced, rubbing his old camp necklace anxiously. “What if I’m a terrible father to Adrian? What if I end up like Poseidon?” He paused, and stared straight at Annabeth. What if I end up like </span>
  <em>
    <span>Gabe</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” He whispered, and Annabeth stood to join him, squeezing him in a tight hug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You really are a seaweed brain sometimes, you know that?” She pulled back slightly, just enough to stare her husband in the eyes. “I know you are going to make a fantastic father, Percy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nope.” Annabeth cut him off. “Don’t argue with me, you know I’m right. Adrian is going to be the luckiest little boy ever. Do you want to know how I know?” She paused and cupped his face with her hands, smiling. “Because you are one of the most compassionate people I know, and I know that you would never do anything to hurt those you care about. You could never be your father, and you could never be Gabe. You’re simply too good of a person.” Annabeth pulled him into another hug, and started to sway back and forth with him in a semblance of a slow dance. “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>care so much</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Percy.” She whispered into his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy was silent, instead allowing himself to be pulled into the dance. There was a brief paused, and Annabeth pulled away to turn on the radio. She returned, and placed her hand in his.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Now</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Mr. Jackson, show me how much you care.” He grinned and pushed out his hand, spinning her around and pulling the daughter of Athena; his best friend; and now his wife back into him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why of course, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mrs. Jackson</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” They rocked back and forth for what felt like hours, simply soaking up each other’s company.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were interrupted, however, when Adrian started to bawl from his room. They pulled apart, grinning at each other, and Annabeth shoved him lightly towards the baby’s room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve shown me your love more than enough, Percy. Go show our son.”</span>
