  <b>June 2009, Gringotts Bank</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s high heels tapped out a sharp rhythm as she made her way to one of the conference rooms in the depths of Gringotts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was going to be precisely on time for her 11AM meeting with a potential new client. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This morning she had put extra care into her appearance, making sure her hair was smoothed down in a neatly braided bun, putting on her fiercest red lipstick, and slipping on her sharpest </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t-fuck-with-me</span>
  </em>
  <span> heels. She had known that she was going to need an edge, and she had put on her proverbial armour to ensure that she would come out relatively unscathed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Normally she was less stomach-turningly anxious for meetings with potential new clients. After four years working at Gringotts as an investment manager, nine years of total professional experience, and her reputation from the war which still lingered, people were generally nervous to meet her, not the other way around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it wasn’t every day that her potential new client was her childhood bully, the boyfriend of her best friend, and the man who she had secretly been infatuated with for the past two years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So needless to say, she was terrified to hold a meeting with Draco Malfoy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She halted abruptly, realizing she had passed the right conference room, lost under her mountain of worry. She back-tracked, grateful the hallway was empty. She stopped in front of the correct door and took a fortifying breath. She was going to treat this like any other meeting and be done with it. He would just be another client, and that was it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door opened on smooth hinges and she stepped inside, head held high.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy was seated at the conference table, and stood when she entered. She put on her best bland-but-professional smile and walked towards him, hand outstretched. He took her hand and for a brief second she thought he was going to bend down and kiss it, but instead he just grasped it firmly, his thumb dragging down the back of her hand slowly, making goosebumps appear on her arms. SHe physically resisted the shiver that ran up her spine at the contact.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Great, this was off to a great start. Totally professional.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy, thank you for coming in.” Her voice was steady and she made her way to the seat at the conference table across from the one he had chosen. Already laid out on the desk were her marketing materials, her prospectus, and a lovely tea set that was refined but unfussy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy resumed his seat and examined her with an air of disinterest. “Well Granger, Potter sings your praises and the Weasley’s credit you with dragging their family out of poverty. Plus Nott and Flint both call you a miracle worker. So, needless to say, I’m intrigued.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione did not deny her success. It was true after all. “You’ve been dating him for two years and you still call him Potter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Malfoy looked a little chagrined and his lips quirked up slightly “old habits die hard, in public at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione raised her eyebrows skeptically. She had seen them together, and while Malfoy remained aloof, she was sure he called him Harry at home. She knew he did. That month she had stayed at Grimmauld Place last year still haunted her sometimes. They hadn’t been good at silencing charms and at night she remembered how ragged Malfoy sounded when he moaned out “Harry” and how the thump of the headboard against the wall would increase in pace in response.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked down biting her lip and hoping her face hadn’t turned red at the thought of that time. She smoothed her hand across the wood of the table in front of her, trying to dispel the memory.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you didn’t need to make an appointment. I would have been happy to do this in a more informal setting. You’re practically family now.” Her voice was light and she avoided eye contact, positive she was still blushing. She folded her hands demurely in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy’s mouth twisted slightly and his eyes flicked from her face to her hands. She was grateful that she had refreshed her manicure charms this morning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to see you in your element. The way Potter talks about you, you’ve single-handedly revolutionized the magical economy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione gave Malfoy half a grin. “Well, I wouldn’t say it was single-handedly. Percy Weasley and Justin Finch-Fletchley have been working with me since the beginning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was true, she had been making money hand over fist. It was also true that she had brought in new investment methods and vehicles to the magical world. And it was true that she had been the one who pushed, who got results, and who people were now desperately trying to emulate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had after all, introduced the hedge fund to the magical world. And the venture capital fund. And the private equity fund. And the derivative. And a whole host of other financial securities and organizations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Daily Prophet had begun referring to her as the Golden Girl, a play on her membership in the Golden Trio, and the fact that whatever she touched turned to galleons.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a far cry from when they had insinuated that she was a slag at 15. It helped that she now owned the majority of the Prophet’s bonds. Bonds that she could call due at any time because they had issued the debt without precise contract language. It wasn’t Hermione’s fault that the magical world was unprepared for sophisticated investors. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy answered with a grin of his own. “Well, now that I have control of my estate again, I knew that we needed the best. You’re the best.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His smile gave her butterflies in her stomach, as cheesy as that sounded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodded, she had heard from Harry that the Malfoy fortune had finally been released from conservatorship, after ten years of mismanagement by the Ministry. It had been done under the guise of “reparations” for the war. Reparations to whom she was not sure. She certainly hadn’t seen any of the money, and neither had anyone else who had been victimized by the Death Eaters and Voldemort during the war.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m happy to have you as a client. I see that my assistant provided you with our materials. And Harry has been a client since I started. Do you have any questions or concerns I can answer?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy nodded, and took out silver wire rimmed reading glasses from his breast pocket. He pulled over the offering documents, flipping them open to the “Risks of Investment” section. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, it mentions the risk of future potential regulation in the industry.” Malfoy looked at her from over his glasses with a raised eyebrow. The butterflies in her stomach briefly migrated to her chest. “But from what I’ve heard, you’re the one pushing for reform and regulation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I am.” Hermione busied herself making tea for the two of them, not bothering to ask how he took his tea. She knew. “When I started my fund I used tactics and methods that would be illegal in the Muggle world. I was the only person doing it and I trusted myself never to go too far. But now there are others trying to emulate my success. And they aren’t as ethical as I am. Also they aren’t as smart. Hence the need for reform.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Besides,” she said, placing a cup of tea in front of him, “I no longer need those tactics. We have enough capital, reputation, and new tricks that we can still make money and adhere to the norms of the global financial system.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fair enough.” Malfoy closed the booklet and took a sip of tea. “So what’s your current investment strategy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, we have begun purchasing, at a significant discount, the outstanding bond issuances of certain companies that, while profitable, are not paying their loans for one reason or another. We are then ensuring that they pay on schedule and in full. Out plan in a few months is to sell the bonds at a higher price than that which we bought them for. It should make a tidy gain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sounds ruthless.” Malfoy looked impressed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione shrugged. It was ruthless. But the companies she was targeting were ones that were owned by assholes and blood-purists, so she didn’t care all that much. “Maybe. But it’s very profitable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy examined her carefully. “How did you get into this. I know we’ve socialized in the past two years, but no one ever told me how you became this take-no-prisoners investor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pressed her lips together. She also often wondered how she became the person she was now. Before the war she had thought she would go into the Ministry and work for creature’s rights. After the war she was disillusioned with a government that had been so quick to turn on her, and had sought a different definition of success.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After the war I did my N.E.W.T.S. via correspondence and enrolled in Muggle University, the London School of Economics.” She didn’t say that her enrollment in Muggle Uni had been a desperate attempt to salvage her relationship with her parents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two months after the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione had brought her parents back from Australia. Retrieving their memories hadn’t been difficult, but regaining their trust had been. As penance she had foregone returning to Hogwarts and had enrolled in Uni, just like they had hoped she would before she was told she was a witch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After University I worked at a Muggle hedge fund, but I missed the Magical world. So I started my own fund that invested in both the Muggle and Magical world. I used my money from the Order of Merlin, and investments from Justin Finch-Fletchley, Harry, and Neville. Eventually the Weasleys invested with me, and then others began to as well. It was very successful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Very successful was an understatement. It had been astronomically successful. The Magical world had not experienced any of the financial system advances that the Muggle world had. And compared to the Magical world of other countries, like the U.S., Great Britain had an especially ancient financial system.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After a few years, Gringotts was interested in my work, and hired my firm as investment professionals for the bank. We work with select clients. I’ve been here for four years now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even after you broke in?” His tone was teasing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione grinned. “Yes, even after that. Goblins appreciate the ability to make money, enough to overlook actions done in the heat of war. Especially because they were very unhappy to learn about all of the dark objects that were being stored in their vaults. Apparently regular contact with dark objects has a negative impact on Goblin Magic, and the contracts that account holders have with Gringotts forbids storing dark items in the bank. So by bringing that to their attention, they were able to confiscate more dark items and fine those accounts. They really like their fines.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco laughed. The sound of it was delightful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was ready to invest before I walked in here, I’m sure you know that. I also know that you’ve been known to turn away some investors. Pansy is especially salty that you turned her down as a client. Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t make money for people who hate me, hate Muggle-borns. I know you don’t. Harry wouldn’t be with you if you did. His trust is enough for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco nodded, thoughtfully. “So what do you need from me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just your signature on a couple of documents and the amount you’d like to invest. Given the aggressive nature of the fund, investments are risky. Therefore there is a limit that I impose to the percentage of your total wealth I’ll accept as an investment, no more than 25%.” Hermione stood and laid out the papers she needed signed in front of Malfoy. She did her best not to lean in too close to him while she did it. Despite her best efforts she was still close enough to feel the warmth of his body and smell his cologne.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sensible. I’d like to invest 25% then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s eyebrows shot up, but he couldn't see her surprise as he was focused on signing the documents. She had expected a more conservative investment. That he would have some hesitations and not trust her fully. Apparently she had been wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s fine. Once we’re done in this meeting I’ll take your commitment amount from your accounts and begin investing it. You will receive quarterly profits, and your first quarter will be prorated, given that we are already two weeks into the quarter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s acceptable. Will I be able to withdraw my investment if I need the money for any reason?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” said Hermione, “it’s your money. If you choose in the future to invest in our venture capital fund or our private equity fund, that requires someone buy out your interest, but in the basic hedge fund you may withdraw at any time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy signed the last document with a flourish and looked up at Hermione expectantly. “Lovely. Harry is waiting in the lobby and we want to take you to lunch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione was flummoxed for a second. She had only been prepared for a business meeting. Not a personal meeting. This had not been on her agenda for the day. But she really couldn’t refuse. She had no other plans for lunch, and she could not in good conscious lie to Malfoy, to Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure, let me just grab my purse. And submit these papers for processing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione waved her wand over the signed forms. The forms duplicated. One copy of the paper disappeared with a soft pop, and the other copies gathered themself together in a neat pile, ready for Malfoy to collect for his own records. Malfoy grabbed his copy of the documents and placed them in the padfolio he had brought to the meeting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She left the conference room with Malfoy, assuring him she’d meet Harry and him in the lobby in under five minutes. The time crunch forced her to speed walk to her office. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She whipped around the corner closest to her office and nearly ran into Percy Weasley. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck. Sorry Perce.” She said, steadying herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s on fire?” HIs tone was mildly curious</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just had my meeting with Malfoy. And now I have lunch with Malfoy. And Harry. And I didn’t know.” Her voice climbed up as she spoke, so by the end of her sentence she practically squeaked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy grimaced sympathetically but didn’t say anything. He knew how much she clung to her schedule and hated unexpected changes to it. He also knew that her feelings about Malfoy and Harry were more complicated than she let on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He patted her on the back and made his way to his office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had never discussed it, but Percy had been at the Weasley family dinner where Harry had introduced Malfoy. He had seen something in her stiff smile and her too tight grip on her wine glass. After dinner he hustled her out of the Burrow and out to a Muggle pub where she got hammered. She didn’t remember much about that evening, but she did recall sobbing on Percy’s shoulder and mumbling something about “dumb boys” and “crushes” and “of course the ones I want don’t want me.” He had helped pour her into bed and had left a hangover potion on her bedside table. That had established Percy’s position as her closest friend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their bond had been solidified two months after she had gotten embarrassingly drunk, when Audrey had left Percy and it had been his turn to be carried home from the pub.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course Ron and Harry would always be her </span>
  <em>
    <span>best friends</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but she didn’t see either of them all that much anymore. Ron was busy. He helped George to run Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, played on a rec Quidditch league, and tended to the four children he had with Romilda Vane, of all people. Harry was busy too. He had been promoted to Head Auror, was on the boards of numerous charities, and had Malfoy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione had her work. She was also on some charity boards, but rarely found time to attend meetings. Her companionship was sparse. Crookshanks had passed a few years after the war, and she hadn’t been able to bring herself to get a new familiar. She still saw Harry and Ron, and all the Weasley’s, but they no longer were constantly in each other’s pockets and she saw them maybe once a month if she was lucky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t lonely. Well, she told herself she wasn’t lonely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had other friends. Well she had Percy and Justin, who she worked exceptionally long hours with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Between work, her reputation, and a general distaste for most men, she didn’t have any romantic prospects.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So yes, she was lonely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabbed her purse off of her desk and double checked that her wand was still in her pocket. She took a second to do the deep breathing technique she had learned when she was researching whether to invest in a chain of Muggle yoga studios. It didn’t really help her nerves so she just squared her shoulders and made her way down to the lobby. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She clenched her hands so tightly that her nails pressed deep half moon impressions into her palms. She generally was happy to see Harry and Malfoy, but she normally had a better opportunity to prepare for the emotional onslaught that their company provoked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She steeled herself for lunch with a man she was deeply sexually attracted to and his boyfriend, her best friend. Her best friend who had held her heart for over 17 years. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because the universe was unkind, it wasn’t enough for her to be sexually attracted to Malfoy. She also had to be in love with Harry. And neither of them wanted her.</span>
