    <p>Coming back to Hogwarts after the war had been hard for many of the students, none more so than the Malfoy heir, for whom the last few years had been seemingly unbearable. Everything had changed after the war, no longer afraid of the wrath of Lucius and Narcissa, they had taken the first real step for themselves, and thus, the blonde returned, Cassiopeia Malfoy. Severus’s portrait had been instrumental in providing the necessary potions to help in Cassiopeia’s transition, growing her hair out, and helping with providing her a modest amount of breast for her height and weight. The girl sighed as she stared at her new Hogwarts uniform, a proper skirt, and the same button-up, and heels she’d stolen from Pansy over the summer. She had painted her nails a bright red and practiced her makeup skills, feeling for the first time, fully herself.</p>
    <p>Cassie pulled her hair into a pony-tail and prepared to board the Hogwarts Express. Pansy had been the only one to see her, and she could not deny the nerves that ran through her as she apparated to Kings Cross that morning.</p>
    <p>“Cassie!” Pansy shouted, Cassie, turned smiling brightly at her friend, as Pansy came running up. “You look stunning as always,” she smiled kissing her best friend’s cheek.</p>
    <p>“I’m nervous as fuck,” Cassie said swallowing the growing lump in her throat.</p>
    <p>“Never let them forget darling, you are a Malfoy, and therefore better than any of them. Shall we then?” she asked holding her arm out for the blond. Cassie smiled taking Pansy’s arm and followed her through Platform 9 ¾. Cassie took a deep breath, gripping Pansy’s arm tight, as they made their way past a group of seventh years, several of whom were eying Cassie.</p>
    <p>“They’re staring,” she hissed.</p>
    <p>“You’re gorgeous darling,” Pansy informed her. “They tend to stare when you’re a beautiful woman.”</p>
    <p>Cassie laughed in spite of herself at that, following Pansy towards the train. Cassie froze mid-stride, there across the station was Harry Potter, looking better than he had any right too. Apparently, he’d decided not to shave over the course of the last three months giving him a scraggily beard that sent a shudder through Cassie.</p>
    <p>“Easy girl,” Pansy said with a smirk, following her friend’s eye line.</p>
    <p>“I can look,” Cassie said, tearing her eyes away from the dark haired man then.</p>
    <p>“Of course you can love, but just remember, he’s still Potter, so don’t expect too much.”</p>
    <p>Cassie sighed, “Don’t you worry. I plan to keep my head down,” she said following Pansy onto the train.</p>
    <p>Across the platform, Harry stared at the blonde, “Does Malfoy have a sister?” he asked, no one in particular.</p>
    <p>“Why do you ask?” Hermione asked. Harry shook his head, following his friends onto the train, finding himself unable to stop thinking about the blonde haired girl, who looked not unlike Malfoy, though considerably softer, and more nervous than Harry had <em>ever </em>seen Malfoy.</p>
    <p>“She was hot,” Ginny commented.</p>
    <p>“I saw her first,” Harry hissed. Ginny chuckled.</p>
    <p>“I thought you were into Malfoy,” Ginny said sing-song.</p>
    <p>“And I thought you were into Luna!”</p>
    <p>Ron and Hermione shared a look as the four found the only semi-empty compartment. It contained only the mysterious blonde and Pansy. The blonde was wearing Slytherin robes and reading a copy of Cosmo with 201 Tips to Please Your Man in large print on the front. Harry blushed, scratching the back of his neck as he stared at the blonde, she really did look a lot like Malfoy.</p>
    <p>“Is there some reason you’re in this compartment?” Pansy asked, crossing her arms over her chest, and trying not to look over at Hermione.</p>
    <p>“Only one that looked safe,” Ron said with a shrug.</p>
    <p>Cassie snorted.</p>
    <p>“You look oddly familiar,” Harry said after a moment. Cassie raised an eyebrow at Harry, her grey eyes boring into Harry’s. Pansy glared and Cassie smiled.</p>
    <p>“I’ve got this darling,” she said closing her magazine and tossing one leg over the other, adjusting her skirt so that it was smooth and nothing was showing. Harry had followed the movement with his eyes, swallowing hard.</p>
    <p>“Cassiopeia Malfoy,” she said holding out her hand to Harry. “Cassie for short,” Harry stared at her hand, he’d been personally acquainted with that hand many times over the last few years, mostly punching him in the face, yet this was completely different. Harry swallowed, shaking her hand.</p>
    <p>“Pleasure to meet you,” Harry said, leaning down to kiss Cassie’s hand. Cassie blushed scarlet.</p>
    <p>“The pleasure is all mine.”</p>
    <p>“It can be,” Ginny muttered under her breath. Cassie raised an eyebrow. Ron was staring at the two of them, incredulously, rolling his eyes as he turned to Pansy.</p>
    <p>“So, erm… whatever happened to your friend Zabini, I think his name was,” Pansy smirked, sharing a look with Cassie.</p>
    <p>“Spending the summer in Italy, he’ll be apparating in I expect sometime later in the week,” Cassie said.</p>
    <p>Ron nodded, “Cool, cool, you know. You all just seemed like, cool and whatever,” Hermione sighed.</p>
    <p>“Smooth Ronald,” she said under her breath, shaking her head.</p>
    <p>“Do you have a thing for my friend Weasley? Because you should know that he is kind of a slut. I love him dearly, but… I just, don’t want you to get hurt.” Ron eyed Cassie.</p>
    <p>“Alright I’m just going to say it, I like her better than the ferret.” Cassie rolled her eyes.</p>
    <p>“I like me better now too, Weasley,” she said. Harry licked his lips, staring at Cassie. She was fascinating and Harry was determined to get to know her better. </p>
