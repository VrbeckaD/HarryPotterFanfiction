          <div class="userstuff"><p align="center">(^^)<br/><strong>Receiving Your Dark Mark</strong><br/>(^^)</p><p>You have been selected for the honor of becoming a marked follower of the Dark Lord Voldemort.</p><p>The first thing you should be aware of concerning your impending Dark Mark is that this is no longer an option. Because you have been selected, your choices at this point are accept the great honor which is to be bestowed upon your body and soul or be ritualistically tortured before being killed in the most gruesomely painful way possible.</p><p>Now that we’ve established that this is not a choice, let’s discuss procedure. To receive your Dark Mark, you must remove at least one stain upon the existence of magic to prove that you have proper superior blood. This means that you must green-list a Muggle, Mudblood, or blood traitor. Again, it must be stressed that this is not a choice. You have been selected to receive the honor of the Dark Mark and now you must prove yourself worthy of it.</p><p>Once your cleansing has been confirmed, you will be brought before the Dark Lord himself. There will likely be a grand revelry to celebrate. Grand revelries are not anything resembling a social function. In fact, they more closely resemble the frantic feeding frenzy common among starving piranhas being introduced to a cow. A selection of Muggles (sometimes even the delicacy of a Mudblood) are rounded up like the worthless animals they are. Then the already marked Death Eaters are allowed to slaughter the beasts in however way fits their mood.</p><p>It is suggested that you do not come between Bellatrix Lestrange and any prey she has chosen. You will not enjoy the experience, and there is a high likelihood that you will not survive the experience. She’s both very bloodthirsty and very thorough in her methods of torture.</p><p>If you should survive the revelry to reach the point of initiation, you will be brought to kneel before the Dark Lord. He will kindly ask one last time if you wish to accept the honor of bearing his Mark. If you accept, he will burn the distinctive tattoo into the flesh of your left forearm before binding it to his own energy.</p><p>From that point on, your servitude will be lifelong. Any betrayal will cost your life (see above mentions of painful deaths).</p><p>Congratulations on your new life as an indentured servant (we don’t say “slaves”)!</p></div>
