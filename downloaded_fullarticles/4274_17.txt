          <div class="userstuff"><p>I wake up to the sun streaming on my face, grumbling and rolling over. The bed is cold and empty beside me. Suddenly a crash of metal falling against one another wakes me up the rest of the way. I get out of bed, the soreness reminding me of the night before, and head on over to the source of the sound. It’s not hard to do so, there’s a hushed stream of cursing with another language mixed into it, all in one very familiar voice. </p><p>I step into the Kitchen, only to stop immediately, and can’t help but laugh a bit at the sight in front of me.

I follow, chucking at the egg in his hair,</p><p>“ I am not funny.” He throws a playful glare over his shoulder, going around the corner. </p><p>I follow slowly, thinking about how life has changed since the tournament.
