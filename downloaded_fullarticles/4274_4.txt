    <h1>Chapter One: New Beginnings</h1><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>The stillness of the night was broken by the panting breaths of a young boy, running down the street. He dragged a large, old fashioned trunk behind him, and seemed intent not so much upon where he was going, but rather upon no longer being where he was running from.<br/>
The stress and exertion of the evening catching up to him, he collapsed against a low wall by a sign reading Magnolia Crescent. In the dim light of the street lamps, it could be seen that the boy could have been no older than twelve, maybe thirteen at a stretch, with eyes an unusual shade of green, and unruly black hair that was clearly impossible to keep tidy. His clothes hung off his frame, obviously several sizes too large, and there was a distinctly underfed look to him.<br/>
Regaining some of his breath, and beginning to take notice of his surroundings, the boy looked blankly at the stick in his hand, before rummaging in his trunk. Pausing, he looked up, and glanced around nervously, as though searching for a watcher sensed but unseen...</p><p> </p><p>Shaking his head, Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Saviour of the Wizarding World, and - at this moment - runaway, most likely expelled, underage wizard, bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more, his hand clenched around his wand.<br/>
He had sensed rather than heard it: someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he'd know whether it was just a stray cat or -- something else.<br/>
"Lumos," Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door gleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped.<br/>
As he fell, he briefly glimpsed a strangely familiar face, half in shadow, peering over the low wall across the street. His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he landed, hard, in the gutter</p><p> -- There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light --</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Later, sitting in his room in the Leaky Cauldron, Harry found himself staring out at the lightening sky. His snowy owl, Hedwig leaned into his hand blissfully as he stroked her. His own thoughts, however, were far from relaxed.<br/>
What on earth was going on? First the weird vanishing beast-thing at Magnolia Crescent, then that face - and he was sure he’d seen it before, somewhere - watching him, plus the extremely unsettling ride on the Knight Bus and the disturbing revelations about Sirius Black from the gossipy conductor, Stan. And to round it all out, Minister Fudge had been waiting for him when he reached the Leaky Cauldron, and had not only gone directly against the Ministries reaction to magic in the Dursley house the year prior, when he had been threatened with expulsion for the actions of a house elf, but seemed to be desperately trying to avoid going into any detail about anything important. He had waved off the underage magic, arranged for Aunt Marge to be obliviated, and wrangled the Dursleys into keeping him, then hustled Harry off to the rented room he now sat in, with an unprecedented three and a half weeks of complete freedom from the Dursleys and from most supervision, on the very threshold of Diagon Alley, ahead of him.<br/>
Head spinning with the excitement and confusion of the night, Harry took off his glasses and collapsed onto the bed, sliding immediately into a deep sleep.</p><p>It took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with fascinating wizarding shops, Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world. Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for a day's shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.<br/>
His daytime explorations took him to all the shops he had never had the chance to properly look around before, and without the pre-hogwarts shopping crowds, or the presence of Ron and Hermione dictating the next move, he found himself losing several hours to the back shelves of Flourish and Blotts, or poking around the most fascinating paraphernalia of Quincey’s Magical Junkshop, or Wiseacres Wizarding Equipment. He was sorely tempted by the solid gold Gobstones, and very nearly broke his resolve with the beautifully made perfect moving model of the galaxy in a globe, having to keep reminding himself that these were not items he absolutely required, and his money had to last him until he graduated from Hogwarts and secured a job.<br/>
He also spent his afternoons doing his homework in the bright sunlight, while eating ice cream at Fortesques. But even in his happiest moment of freedom, there remained the undercurrent of unease. Someone was watching him. He kept seeing the same face in the crowds, watching from behind a bookshelf, or reflected in a shop window. The flash of red hair at first made him think it was a Weasley, but they were in Egypt visiting Bill… and in any case, the Weasleys were his friends and would not have simply watched from a distance. A glint of green eyes in passing had him turning his head like an owl, but to no avail. </p><p>In the end, however, it was not his vigilance that brought the mysterious watcher to him, but his ignorance. Walking past the entrance to Knockturn Alley, and not paying enough attention to his surroundings, Harry collided with an old woman, wrapped in a heavy shawl with very little of her face showing. Even as he reeled back and she began to fall, quick as a snake one gnarled and warty old hand shot out and caught his wrist, keeping them both on their feet and pulling Harry closer to the now uncovered and suddenly very noticeable sharp teeth of what could only be a Hag. </p><p>“Rude little chilldren need to learn mannerss” she hissed, pulling a still dazed Harry into the shadows of Knockturn Alley. Her grip tightened, cutting off the circulation in his wrist, and her other hand moved towards his throat, claw-like nails poised to cut. </p><p>A whispered curse in what sounded like French was the only warning Harry had before the Hag was blasted across the alleyway and into the wall, losing her grip on him in the process. From the floor, Harry squinted up at his rescuer. Deep red hair framed a delicate marble face, and sparkling green eyes of a distinctive hue looked back at his own matching pair --</p><p>“... M.. Mum!?” </p><p>Smiling sadly, the woman leant over him, and gently tapped the side of his head with her finger. Harry’s eyes rolled back into his head, and he went limp as consciousness fled.</p>
