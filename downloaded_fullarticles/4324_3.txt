    <p>The grass had grown long in the autumn months, and it scratched at Hermione’s ankles as her and Ron walked around the yard at the Burrow. There was a crisp breeze, but the arm around her shoulder was helping to keep her warm. Despite having a flat in London, she often came over to stay with Harry and the Weasley’s as being alone was only nice for so long. Ron’s quiet voice broke the self-established silence.    </p><p>“What is our plan, Mione?” He led her over to the back steps and sat down.This was a question he asked frequently, yet he never seemed to get the answer that he wanted.    </p><p>“What do you mean, Ron,” she asked, leaning her head against his shoulder. Their relationship had been a bumpy one from the beginning, but when the war ended it was almost just expected that they had fallen in love and were a couple. For one reason or another, Ron felt like home to Hermione, so she had no reason to try and fight the rumors. Well, other than trying to keep their faces off the front page of every tabloid and paper in Wizarding Britain. Luckily in the past year, the attention had died down a bit.    </p><p>“You know, like… where do we go? Are we getting married? Have you thought about kids?” His answer came out all at once, like the pressure behind it had been building for longer than was probably healthy. Hermione sighed.    </p><p>“Ronald, you know I haven’t. I’m only 21 years old. I want a career. I just recieved my NEWTs, I want to put them to good use, make a change before I start worrying about bringing my own children into the world.”    </p><p>“Well how soon would you be willing to retire then?”    </p><p>“How soon would I what?” Hermione's voice got a notch louder as she turned to face him. His face was red. He knew he had said the wrong thing, but it was too late to back out now.    </p><p>“You know… how soon would you be willing to give it up to take care of our kids? Like Mum does.”    </p><p>“It was never my plan to give up a career to raise a family, Ron. It is very possible to do both, in fact. It never will be my plan to be a stay at home mother, because that’s not who I am. Nothing against your mum, Ron, but we are not the same. I couldn’t live the life she lives.”    </p><p>“You don’t have to work though, Hermione. You have money to spare, and I could take care of you easy between my war earnings and my job that I’ll get. You won’t want for anything. You can spend your time taking care of all of our children, and you and Gin can have play dates with the kids and…” He trailed off as he saw her tired expression.    </p><p>“Ron, how many times do I need to say it. I will not, barring extreme circumstances that not even Sybil Trelawney could try and predict, be a stay at home mother. I want more than that. I need more than that. The job isn’t for the money, it’s to make the world better, to help every person and creature that I could help. I don’t think you understand what I’m saying.”</p><p>“I just don’t get why you would want to go do a boring office job at the ministry everyday when you could be at home raising our kids, Mione. Would that be so horrible a job?”</p><p>“It’s not that, Ron. You don’t get it,” she stood up and made for the door. “Just let the subject rest, Ron. We can talk about it again some other time, after you’ve tried to understand where I’m coming from.”</p><p>His face was red and he looked like a young boy who had been told he wouldn’t be getting that new broom he wanted for Christmas. It was disheartening to see, and Hermione almost turned around to try and say something else, something kinder, but she couldn’t. She was upset herself. How could he expect her to simply be a stay at home mother. No, not bloody likely. She needed someone else to talk to, to sort out her feelings and frustrations.  </p><p>A door upstairs closed and there were footsteps on the stairs. A pair of long legs that ended in some baggy pajama shorts appeared, and soon the whole body, ending in bright red hair, was visible.</p><p>“Gin, thank Merlin, just who I wanted to talk to.” Ginny grinned at her as she walked into the kitchen. She shouldered open the fridge and grabbed a bottle of juice as Hermione slid into a seat at the table.</p><p>“What can I do you for, ‘Mione?” Bottle in hand, Ginny sat in the seat across the table and leaned forward presenting Hermione with her full attention.</p><p>“Ron… he thinks I should be a stay at home mother. Like, no ministry job, no studying, no more adventures, no pursuing my ambitions, nothing. Just get married, hatch some kids, and stay at home as a mother hen for all my life. I don’t get it,” she exclaimed. “Am I wrong in wanting to do those things? I mean I do love Ron, but I’m not sure that I want to have a family right now. Eventually, probably. But right now? We just ended a war, Gin. I don’t want to settle down and let the world stay as it is, as it was before. I don’t want to bring children into this world until it’s better and I want to be a part of the change and… and I’m rambling. Sorry.”</p><p>“You’re not rambling, you’re explaining. And stop apologizing so much, that isn’t going to get you anywhere in the ministry.”</p><p>“Wait, so you think I should go for it?” When Ginny nodded Hermione sat back, slightly more at ease now that she knew she had at least one person’s support.</p><p>“Listen, my brother can be rather pig-headed. It’s something we Weasleys all have in common. If you want to make a difference in the world then I think you should go for it. I don’t know how much you’ll be able to do, but I feel like if anyone could make a change, it’d be you. But I do think you need to listen to Ron. Explain yourself to him, tell him what you want, and then listen to his side. See if you guys can compromise.”</p><p>The girls shared a look and Ginny extended her hand for Hermione to take. Reaching out, Hermione placed her hand in Ginny’s and the younger girl squeezed it in support. Hermione looked down in thought before patting Ginny’s hand in return and pulling away.</p><p>“Thank you, Ginny. Honestly, talking to you is always so nice, it’s like a nice trip to the bookstore. You’ve inspired my courage, I think I’ll do it tonight.”</p><p>“Promise me you’ll let me know how it goes. I want to know everything, okay? Especially if I have to knock some sense into the stubborn arse myself.”</p><p>“I will Ginny, thank you again.” The girls hugged briefly before Ginny grabbed a second bottle of juice, for Harry she claimed, and bounded back up the stairs. Turning back towards the door, and her own boyfriend she took three deep breaths before calling his name. When she didn’t hear a response she walked back outside and found him standing in the garden, chucking gnomes as far as he could.</p><p>“Ron?” At her voice his head whipped around and he dropped the angry gnome swinging about in his hand. He looked winded and Hermione could tell he had been attempting to work off his frustrations. “Ron, how would you like to come back to my flat and order some unhealthy food and, I don’t know, watch a movie or something. And then we can have this talk that you’ve been trying to initiate for a few months now. I’ll buy.”</p><p>“You know what? That sounds great, Hermione. You can choose dinner this time, but I’m picking the movie. No more documentaries. Let me go tell Mum where we’re headed, you know how she is.” Hermione watched Ron jog into the house and mentally shook herself, preparing to have a discussion that had the potential to cement the future of their relationship.</p>
