    <p>"Barmy."</p><p>"Absolutely insane, that boy."</p><p>"Not right in the head."</p><p>Hadrian Peverell. He'd caused quite the stir when had he resurfaced at age eleven. Because, one, he was the sole heir to the thought to be extinct Peverell line and, two, he was mental.</p><p>Tom never gave him much thought beyond that, the boy was socially awkward and a Hufflepuff to boot. He had the notes, as he had with everyone who initially piqued his interest, and knew the bare bones. Half-blood, dead parents and pitifully average academics with the exception of defence. Professor Merrythought loved that boy, like one would love a particularly unfortunate kitten or puppy. Useless where it counts but at least he tries - <em>Snuffles finally went on a walk without a leash today! Isn't he clever?</em></p><p>Thus Hadrian Peverell was ultimately unimportant in the grand scheme of things, a speck on the elegant canvas painting that was Tom's future. He had bigger objectives to worry about, like amassing a dedicated following and learning beyond the Hogwarts curriculum, than sob stories with identity issues. </p><p>He was <em>Dumbledore's</em> charity case anyway. </p><p>At least, that was how it stood up until Christmas during fourth year. Over the short holiday, the little Peverell boy had vanished. And, if the rumour mill were to be believed, Dumbledore had requested and sanctioned indefinite leave, starting two days from now.</p><p>"Occlumency," Leander Lestrange proclaimed, proud like a cat presenting its owner with a dead mouse. "He is an occlumens." Interesting, but not entirely useful without further backing. </p><p>In light of recent events, Tom had called a meeting of sorts in the common room, searching for information on a topic almost everyone was intrigued by on some level. Gossip has been quite mundane lately. </p><p>"He was declared sane over Christmas, presumably before he disappeared," Abraxas Malfoy said. Of course, he would know the pertinent details and <em>, of course, </em> he would wait twenty minutes before revealing them. Tom would know, timing is very important. </p><p>"Oh?" Understating his curiosity was the best countermeasure, he must avoid conveying too much gratitude lest he feeds Abraxas' ego too much and give way to narcissistic obesity. He'd written the latter part of that rule in his diary.</p><p>"Yes, the specifics are confidential, however, there is talk of him being a rather tragically inclined seer, unable to separate what seems to be a rather horrific future from our arguably peaceful present." Every Slytherin within earshot (it was an open-mic, open-invite event) subtly leant forwards. "I imagine it would be quite... scarring to see that at such a young age."</p><p>Edwin Avery scoffed. A few others chuckled. But Tom knew they were only playing a part, Edwin's dear mother wouldn't lay a finger on her son, be that in an act of violence or affection. </p><p>Tom propped his chin on his hand, stretching languidly on the green armchair. He was the centrepiece to a mix-matched circle of chairs, cushions and reappropriated coffee tables. Casting an ambient orange glow on the faces that looked towards him, the fire flickered lazily behind him. He was sure he made for quite the imposing figure, even with the older students looking down on him. Theatrics, really, but it was good fun as well as meaningful. </p><p>"Do we know who killed his parents?" It wasn't a question of how they died, more the identity of the culprit. "The running theory was that Dumbledore felt guilty for the child's predicament, there must be an ulterior motive to this, after all, the boy is neither a Gryffindor nor any good at transfiguration, but did we receive any confirmation?"</p><p>"...No," Abraxas admitted, looking a little off-put by his own lack of knowledge. Understandable, they hadn't really paid much thought to the scrawny bespectacled boy up until a day or so ago. </p><p>"Unfortunately, it looks like we will simply have to wait for news of him," Tom conceded, there wasn't much to be done. </p><p>"Perhaps he'll return," Orion Black suggested, an empty bland comment, filler for conversation. But Tom would be a fool to take it at face value, Orion tended to be right with his speculations, as obscure and sporadic as they were.</p><p>True to Orion's words, Peverell did in fact return, two weeks later no less. Dragged in by Dumbledore up to the headmaster's office, hissing and struggling all the while with a certain ferocity that belonged to only the most desperate of creatures in the worst situations. Or so said the Ravenclaw prefect who was patrolling the right corridor at the right time, who told Crouch who told someone else who told another student and so on before Abraxas inevitably caught onto the end of the chain. </p><p>Tom was practically buzzing with excitement when he walked into his next defence class, try as he might to calm his outward appearance. At present, he was good at emphasising real emotions but still had to work on dampening his true feelings when they were so strong. Despite this, he had yet to truly slip negatively in front of a professor. </p><p>Peverell had returned to classes and fourth-year Slytherins shared Defense with the Hufflepuffs. </p><p>Usually, that was a detriment. Hufflepuffs were hard-working individuals and let it never be said that any Hufflepuff wasn't tenacious. But they lacked the impulse and energy that made the Gryffindors easy to rile up in a duel. Level headed for the most part until you threatened the pack. </p><p>However, it was the fifth period and he'd already heard about Peverell's previous classes. Apparently, he'd suddenly shot up academically, mutterings of his so-called insanity no longer holding him back. It sounded fake and terribly convenient but Tom was ready for the real deal nonetheless.</p><p>"Hadrian," Professor Merrythought greeted the boy as he entered, caution apparent in her tone. Whatever had transpired in the headmaster's office had certainly shaken her perception of him. Gone were the patronising smiles and familiar greetings. <em>He doesn't look any different,</em> Tom thought,<em> he has the same ratty long hair hiding his face and short hunched-</em> he wasn't hunched. </p><p>"Just Harry," the boy responded, flicking back his hair only for it to fall back and obscure his face again. With a huff, he tried again, and then once more, before giving up entirely. He seemed taller, an illusion created by a straight spine, and more assured in his gait and general movement. Still clumsy, Tom observed as his hip collided with the first desk he passed.  Merrythought looked perplexed, allowing herself a moment to watch him before taking the register. </p><p>The class started out as it normally would, professor Merrythought delving into the theory behind the shield charm and its practical uses: obviously, to shield against spells and, less obviously, to conjure an almost impregnable barrier when used in combination with <em>fianto duri</em> and <em>repello inimicum</em>. A mundanely average lesson up until the practical. </p><p>As expected, Tom had no real issues with performing <em>protego</em> but Peverell was having some kind of mental dispute with himself from the looks of his creased eyebrows and contemplating gaze aimed at his own wand. </p><p>"...Is there a problem, Peverell?" Merrythought had dropped the first name. Peverell didn't respond. "Hadrian?" Again, silence. "Harry?" That got a reaction.</p><p>"Oh, uh, yeah? Maybe? I'm not really sure, to be honest with you, professor." Peculiar.</p><p>"Well, just give it a shot."</p><p>If any student's attention hadn't been focused on Peverell, it sure was after he exclaimed "Protego!" and conjured a stark white shield, practically opaque from an outsider's perspective yet barely misted from Peverell's angle. It was a feat that the fourteen-year-old wasn't expected to perform so well, his previous inclination towards the subject notwithstanding. </p><p>Tom thought it was <em>brilliant</em>.</p><p>"Well done, Mr Peverell," Merrythought was downplaying her shock but her facial expression betrayed her. "Ten points to Hufflepuff." Peverell beamed. </p><p>"There's no way!" Edwin exclaimed once they returned to the common room, safe from the prying eyes and ears of the other houses searching for a chink in their unified front of control. "He was good, but he wasn't that good."</p><p>"Didn't he used to hate it when people shortened his name?" Leander mused, plopping down onto a sofa and taking up the length of it. "The puffs were quick to round up on anyone who used it and I swear I'd never seen him closer to crying than in those moments." </p><p>Rowan Mulciber crept over, unnervingly silent, and propped his crossed arms on the back of Leander's sofa. "Peverell doesn't cry, he mopes." Poor Leander hadn't noticed the hulking fifth-year approach and startled at his deep whisper with an aborted cry.</p><p>"Mulciber! You're too damn quiet," Leander exclaimed. Mulciber grinned.</p><p>"Whatever happened over Christmas, he's clearly changed. If it weren't for the awful hair and his small stature, I'm not confident I would've have recognised him on sight," Tom mused and his little circle of Slytherins hummed in agreement.</p><p>Hadrian "Harry" Peverell was a different sort of teen. Where he had once cowered and hid behind his hair, he flicked it back in vain as though it annoyed him. Where he had once minimised his presence by curling his back, he stood tall and strode with confidence. A little too much confidence given his still intact clumsy nature. Not to mention his sudden rise in spell proficiency. Was insanity really so inhibiting?</p><p>Probably, Peverell was a wreak and the whole school knew it. Or at least he used to be.</p><p>"He's like a different person," Orion chimed in right by his side, resulting in a small, but undignified all the same, jump from Tom. Similarly to Mulciber, Orion had a habit of quietly approaching but Mulciber did so to get under Leander's skin while Orion simply did because he was Orion, as far as Tom could tell. </p><p>Tom didn't trust Orion. He was all disquietened smiles and false platitudes and he simply knew too much supposedly without anyone telling him anything. Loathe he was to admit it, Orion was a true Slytherin. Except that his ambitions were vague and generally unknown. Leander wanted to take over the family business, Edwin wanted a place high up in the ministry and Tom wanted to change the wizarding world. Orion wanted to start a family. That couldn't be believed. </p><p>"I wonder where he was all this time," Leander drawled lazily, back to stretching out across the couch in spite of Mulciber's presence.</p><p>Tom wondered that too. </p><p>But the difference between Tom and Leander was that he would act on that wonder rather than proclaim such a statement in lieu of asking a question.</p>
