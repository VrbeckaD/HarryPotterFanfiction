    <p>Hermione sighed and meandered her way back to the plush settee, the priceless china cup sat steadily in her hand upon its matching saucer. She tilted her head back as the last sip of tea entered her mouth, steam still rose from the cup as it returned to its origin. Hermione knew no matter how much she wished to avoid the conversation, no matter how they all wished to avoid it, the event’s that will take place tomorrow would go down in history. If they had a future.</p><p>“I must say this is quite unprecedented,” the aristocratic blond punctured the silence that hung over the room, sipping his tea like the Lord he was, “No one, wishes to do this but sadly we must in the name of magical kind.”</p><p>“For the Ministry of Magic to even think people traveling to the past will save magic, it makes me wonder what potion are they on and where can I get in,” the war hero accentuated with wild gestures of his hands, swirling his hands in the air when a word escaped him, “I mean, they want people who have a history of wizarding blood in their family to go back and… practically breed with their own family.”</p><p>Hermione chuckled at the bickering between Harry and Draco, both arguing who it would be worse for, the one who didn’t know his family or the one who knew his too well. “Oh for Pete’s sake, boys. You two need to start packing anything you’re taking with you, remember they said only items that you asked to be made or crafted for yourselves,” Hermione lectured with a glare that held no strength, they could see the shaking in her legs show how nervous she was.</p><p>“Hermione, I really wish you were coming with us, I guess they won’t make an exception, will they?” Harry sulked, if he could somehow sneak her through time then he would. The ministry was being quite stubborn on the rules of what was to take place tomorrow, it was heavily enforced that only one family member was to travel, this caused trouble for large families like the Weasley’s, and they must have a history of at least 3 generations of wizarding blood.  </p><p>“Harry, with what we’ve gone through together, I would love to go with you but I’m muggleborn,” Hermione gazed unseeingly at the man, lost in memories, this was the last time she would be with the two yet she couldn’t bring herself to say goodbye, “For some reason my heart isn’t convinced this is the end for all of us.”</p><p>“I think you’re quite right,” Draco murmured, “This will not be the last time we’ll see each other, you’ll find a way to come to us, or we’ll find a way to bring you to us.”</p><p> “Yeah, you may be right, Draco,” Harry stood with a pureblood grace that Malfoy forced him to learn, under the reasoning that Harry would gain more political allies, but this time it would have to be used to gain respect from his own family, “I’m heading back to Grimmauld, it’s probably best I get an early night. Hermione, there will be a letter from me once I’m gone, I’ll leave it in Grimmauld’s library. It’s for your eyes only.”</p><p>Both Hermione and Draco understood the weighting of Harry’s words far too well, carefully Hermione left her reply as a simple nod of acknowledgment and pressed no further. Harry pulled Hermione to her feet and kissed her cheek before turning to Draco, who was leaning on the fireplace, they gave each other a stern nod; any thanks to Draco for his hospitality were swatted away as Harry was shooed out the room.  </p><p>“Do you think you’re going to be okay?”</p><p>“I should be asking you that, Draco.” Hermione pulled him in for a tight hug which neither wanted to leave, it was only in the aftermath of the war they began to confine in each other, not to long ago at all. It was the Malfoy Manor which Hermione ran to when trying to escape her toxic relationship with Ron. They both let out content sighs and drew apart, Hermione memorised Draco’s features in case she never saw the other again. A soft kiss to Hermione’s flushed cheeks, Draco chose to leave the room rather abruptly, calling back that he was heading to bed.</p><p>Hermione could only force out a sad smile as she watched him disappear into the depths of the manor, she knew that this was the last chance she would see the two guys. Hermione could not find any strength left in her soul, she would not be able to give them a final farewell, but they knew that better than most. Heading to the room Draco had set up for her in the guest wing, she let cold tears run down her face. She allowed her sudden loneliness to seep into her bones.</p><p>She was too tired. Too tired to keep fighting, to keep struggling. So damn tired.</p>
