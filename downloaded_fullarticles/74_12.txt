  <u> <strong>Ginny </strong> </u>
</p><p>For many years now, not long before 11am on the 1st of September on King's Cross' platform Nine and Three Quarters, travellers were likely to come across a gaggle of noisy redheads in the crowd, their hair shining like a beacon through the steam billowing from the Hogwarts Express. However, this year only two Weasleys stood amongst the bustling witches and wizards on the platform. The family had thought it safer to be as inconspicuous as possible and for Ginny to be accompanied by just her mother.</p><p>“You don’t have to go, you know. We'd understand."</p><p>“Mum, we've had this conversation a hundred times. I’ve <em>got</em> to go to Hogwarts this year! If I don’t go, everyone at home will be in even more danger than they already are!”</p><p>Ginny had grown so much over the last year that her mother no longer had to bend down to meet her eyes. Nevertheless, she inclined her head slightly, grasping Ginny's shoulders and fixing her with an earnest look.</p><p>“Yes, but we could deal with that if we needed to -”</p><p>“Mum, the train's leaving in a minute.” This wasn’t quite true but Ginny, as ever, found these kinds conversations with her mother difficult and was impatient to get it over with as quickly as possible. </p><p>“I know, I know. But please, <em>promise </em>me you won't do anything reckless. That you'll do everything you can to not get in trouble this term. To keep yourself <em>safe</em>,” her mother pleaded, tightening her grip on Ginny. The dull knot in her stomach, which had been there since the night of Bill and Fleur's wedding, twisted nauseatingly. Ginny desperately wanted to reassure her mother, but she didn’t know what awaited her during her sixth year at Hogwarts. She didn’t want to make promises that would be hard to keep.</p><p>“I'll try, Mum.” Ginny knew her response sounded unconvincing but it was the best she could do. Clearly, though, it wasn’t good enough for her mother.</p><p>“Ginny,” Mrs Weasley’s tired smile faded and her face became serious. “Do you remember  when we cleaned out Grimmauld Place, in the summer before your fourth year?”</p><p>“Yes.” Ginny would never forget it: the summer Harry had brought Cedric’s broken body back from that graveyard.</p><p>“And I cleared that Boggart out from the old chest in the drawing room?”</p><p>“Vaguely,” Ginny said, puzzled and inpatient. Why was her mum talking about this now?</p><p>“Well, I didn’t do such a good job – and the Boggart took the form of my worst fear,” her mother paused, as if bracing herself. “It was all of your brothers, Ginny, in turn. Dead. And your father. And Harry too. But you weren’t amongst them, because back then I knew I could keep you safe. My youngest, my only daughter. But if I were to come across a Boggart now Ginny, I know you'd be there amongst them too.”</p><p>Ginny was quiet as the understanding her mother’s words sank in. “What exactly are you trying to guilt trip me into, Mum?” The retort came out more sullenly than she intended.</p><p>“I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, Ginny. I'm trying to explain how much I worry, and why it’s so important that you promise me you’ll do all you can to keep yourself safe. I know you: you’re brave, you’re fierce, and I wouldn’t want you any other way. But those traits in these times, Ginny… they can get one into trouble.” There were tears swimming in her mother's eyes now, and Ginny felt the stinging of her own threatening to escape. Despite her better judgment, Ginny conceded to her mother's wishes.</p><p>'Okay. I promise,' she said quietly.</p><p>Her mum smiled and nodded, then she embraced her daughter so ferociously Ginny's breath was momentarily squeezed from her lungs. The Hogwarts Express let out a deafening roar, temporarily enveloping them in a wave of black smoke. It was a warning that it would depart in the next few minutes, prompting the mother and daughter to exchange quick goodbyes and for Ginny to hastily board the train, pulling her trunk behind her.</p><p>As the train pulled away Ginny walked down the aisle peering into compartments, trying to find a seat. She glimpsed a group of Slytherins in one and Draco Malfoy turned towards her, catching her eye and smirking. Ginny gifted him with one of her most disdainful, defiant glares, then looked away dismissively and continued walking. A group of her Quidditch friends called to her from another compartment, inviting her in to sit with them. Ginny gave them a strained smile and continued on down the train - the Quidditch clique were usually fun to be around but their boisterousness and loud chatter were the last things Ginny needed right now.</p><p>She <em>needed</em> to be around people that would understand the gravity, the seriousness of the situation they were in: returning to Hogwarts where a now confirmed Death Eater, the man who had killed Albus Dumbledore, was headmaster; in a time when Voldemort had taken control of the ministry in all but name, and by default, Hogwarts itself. So she was grateful and relieved when she came across a compartment that was empty except for Neville and Luna. They were sitting next to each other, apparently in the midst of earnest conversation. Relieved that she could be alone with them Ginny opened the door, causing Luna and Neville to break off their conversation and glance up. The three smiled at each other and exchanged greetings as Ginny sat down.</p><p>“I was just telling Neville what happened at your brother's wedding,” Luna said, her eyes wide and serious.</p><p>“Sounds grim,” Neville commented gravely.</p><p>“Yeah, it was, turned in to a massive shit storm of chaos and interrogations. But they finally gave up questioning those of us who hadn't apparated away,” Ginny said shortly. Over the summer there had been numerous conversations between the Weasleys and the Order that had dissected the events of her brother's wedding, and Ginny didn't want to talk about it again. Not right now, anyway.</p><p>“I'm guessing Harry and Hermione have gone into hiding. D'you know if they're okay?” Neville asked eagerly, then he glanced at the compartment door and back to Ginny. “And where's Ron?”</p><p>Ginny paused before answering. She knew it was important that as few people as possible knew of Ron's real whereabouts but Luna and Neville had shown their loyalty to Harry, Ron and Hermione countless times. She remembered how they had both come running unquestioningly at Harry's call for help at the end of last year and had fought the Death Eaters bravely in the Astronomy tower. She knew she was going to need people she could confide in this term otherwise she might go mad, so Ginny made a decision to trust them.</p><p>“We don’t know where Ron is,” Ginny admitted, and continued to tell Neville and Luna about the ghoul-and-spattergroit rouse, emphasising to them how important it was that no one else knew. “And Hermione's meant to be in Australia with her parents, but she's not. She, Harry and Ron disapparated at the wedding. We don’t know where any of them are.”</p><p>Ginny knew, from overhearing Lupin talking with her parents one night in August, that the three had been at Grimmauld Place at around that time, but she had no idea if they were still there. The looks on her two friends’ faces as Ginny told them her news were so solemn and earnest that she was reassured they were taking the situation with the gravity it deserved. She felt she could confide in them further, so she leaned in close to them and continued in a low voice. “Harry told me he had something to do, something about V-Voldemort," Ginny was still getting used to saying the dark wizard's real name out loud, but it was something she had been determined to do since her brother's wedding. "But they wouldn’t tell me what. The three of them had been planning it all summer. They were never going to come back, regardless of the attack at Bill's wedding.”</p><p>“What do you suppose it is they're trying to do?” Neville asked, and Ginny shook her head.</p><p>“No idea. I couldn’t get anything out of them all summer.”</p><p>The three friends sat in silence for a few minutes.</p><p>“I don't think a lot of people will be coming back this term,” Neville said eventually. “My Gran kept saying that even though they've made it compulsory to attend Hogwarts, it would be crazy for Muggle-borns to come.”</p><p>“I expect she's probably right,” Luna said, as she gazed out the window at the back gardens of terraced houses that were rushing past. The train was picking up speed as it headed into the London suburbs. “I think Hogwarts is going to be very different this year.”</p><p> </p>
