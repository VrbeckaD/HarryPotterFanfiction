Hagrid finished his stew and got up from the table. “Where are you heading?” Harry asked, looking confused.</p><p>Hagrid looked at Harry, also confused. “I’m heading out, what else would I be doing?” </p><p>“Nevermind,” said Harry, sipping his stew. </p><p>“I’ll be back within the hour,” said Hagrid, “Keep the fire going.”</p><p>Hagrid headed out.</p><p>Thirty minutes pass…</p><p>Harry was starting to fall asleep when he heard a loud rapping on the door.</p><p>“Who is it?” Harry hollered.</p><p>“It is I!” Dumblepool cried.</p><p>“Professor Dumblepool?!?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yes!” Dumblepool said, “Can you open the door? I have my hands full!”</p><p>“Sure thing, Headmaster!” Harry said, he got up and opened the door.</p><p>Headmaster Dumblepool stumbled inside and dropped the tub that contained some octopus monster things.</p><p>“What are those for, Professor?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Well,” said Dumblepool, “The seventh year students are going to have a graduation party, and I thought I would give them these things,” He said, gesturing to the octopus monster things.</p><p>“Why would they need them?” Harry asked, puzzled.</p><p>“Notice how long the tentacles are?” Dumblepool said, grinning, as he set them on the table.</p><p>Harry nodded his head.</p><p>Dumblepool wiggled his eyebrows.</p><p>Harry raised one eyebrow.</p><p>Dumblepool shook his eyebrows.</p><p>Harry made his eyebrows move like waves.</p><p>“I’m not sure I understand, Professor” Harry said, after a minute or two.</p><p>“Ah well,” Dumblepool sighed, “You’re probably too young to know anyway.”</p><p>“Anywho,” Dumblepool said, “I was hoping Hagrid would be able to look after them for me.”</p><p>Dumblepool looked around, “Where is Hagrid, by the way?” He looked under the bed.</p><p>“He headed out,” Harry shrugged.</p><p>“Dumblepool grinned, “That rascal, this is the fourth time this week.”</p><p>Dumblepool tipped his hat at Harry.</p><p>“Catch you around, Harry,” Dumblepool said, still grinning.</p><p>He ran out the door, chuckling.</p><p>Harry shrugged again, he put the octopus monster thing into Hagrid’s cauldron and fell asleep at the table.</p><p>He dreamed that he was at the seventh year graduation party that Dumblepool mentioned…</p><p>He woke up in a cold sweat...</p><p> </p><p>The End</p></div>
