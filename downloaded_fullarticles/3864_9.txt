<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     It had been two months since Remus Lupin had been unceremoniously and perhaps even illegally kicked out of his ex-boyfriend Alex’s place — two months since he’d found himself homeless with no money in the bank and no clue how he was supposed to afford lodgings in London by himself on a barista’s salary.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     It had been a month and a half since he’d moved into the Flat From Hell.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     But somehow it felt much longer than that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus had started developing theories (late night, can’t sleep, back-too-sore-internal-monologue-too bitter-type theories) about how time passes differently depending on one’s current situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much like how there were dog years and cat years, there were bored hours and Hell weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A bored hour equals six regular hours equals eighteen fun hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Hell week equals two normal hours and so on and so on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of his late-nightiest, bitterest, most philosophically miserable musings led him to the conclusion that the souls of the dead probably only spend a year or so in Hell (actual literal Hell, not Flat from Hell Hell, which is actual figurative Hell) but time just passes so slowly they confuse it with eternity.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     The flat itself had been Peter’s suggestion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been happy to convince Remus to move into this “great place not far from campus” with “cheap rent” because “the landlady’s a friend of my mum’s.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “And sure,” Peter had noted anxiously, “it isn't in the <em>best</em> neighborhood, but who could complain about the price?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Of course, by “great place not far from campus,” Peter meant one only a fifteen minute walk, three stops on the underground, and five minutes on a bus away from campus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By “cheap rent” he meant only two paychecks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By “friend of my mum’s,” he meant a grumpy lady his mother had gone to uni with who was desperate to get tenants in the shitty old building she was too cheap to have demolished.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And by “not the best neighborhood,” he meant a five block area so uniformly and openly depressing and the first time Remus went to see it he thought he’d walked onto a film set.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d gotten into the habit of playing “kick the needle” on his daily commute.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     So no, Remus couldn’t quite complain about the price.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, he thought as he crawled off of the old duvet he’d been using as a bed, he could bloody well complain about everything else.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Remus’s morning ablutions were conducted with a sense of unease.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pipes groaned and clicked as they processed his morning piss, and water sputtered from the faucet in weak and uneven spurts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus couldn’t help but imagine the entire building collapsing one day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One day he was going to pull the lever on the old yellowish toilet and the thing was going to fall through the floor and the floor beneath that and all the way down until it hit the bottom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then the whole building would fall apart around it and the pipes in Remus’s bathroom would be spurting water and piss and shit like fireworks across the neighborhood and Remus would just be there with his pants down and his cock in hand staring at the building that he destroyed that morning because he had to pee.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Fortunately, that didn’t happen (not that day, at least).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually the pipes went silent and the building still stood.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Remus sighed and closed his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even the stupid thought of his toilet blowing the building up made his heart race.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He ran through his breathing exercises quickly, and tried to recite the mental affirmations from The Books<em>.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Shortly after Remus’s mother learned that moving to London had not cured her son of his various neuroses and ills, mysterious packages from Amazon started appearing at his door step.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boxes contained books with titles like <em>Mindfulness Techniques for Depression, How to Cure Anxiety with Meditation </em>and <em>Chakra Healing for LGBT Youths.</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gift receipts inside featured messages from his mother like “Please just try the technique on page 67” and “My circle enjoyed this one, I think you should give it a go.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     He’d thought they would all be stupid, but some of the techniques were actually pretty interesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mindfulness especially.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been working to get into the habit of paying detailed attention to everything around him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was fascinating— when you paid a great deal of attention to all the tiny reasons why something is shit, the shitness feels less shitty and more magnificently shitty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And magnificent shitness is still magnificence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if it’s also shit.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Remus mindfully rummaged through his clothes heap and found something like an outfit in the confused tangle of jeans and socks and jumpers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulled his coat on with intention and left the flat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wind smacked him across the face as he walked out the building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He noted that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He trudged to the underground stop as old cans and used wrappers of every imaginable origin rolled around him like little urban tumbleweeds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He noted that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As he sat on a bus stop bench he tried to pay loving attention to the patterns at the edges of stickers people had tried to peel off of the lamp post.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     But then the bus arrived and Remus reached for his wallet and remembered that it was pay day and remembered his rent was due in a few days and remembered the payment on his credit card and remembered his bank account and anxiety spread across his body abruptly with a familiar but still unbearable tingling sensation and his mindfulness practice ended for the day then and there and the whole bus ride was spent crunching numbers and wincing.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     When he made it to work, the only light on in the coffee shop was the one illuminating Lily as she readied the till for the day.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “Morning, Remus,” she said as she opened the door for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus was met with the familiar scent of baking pastries and brewing coffee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His stomach growled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus closed his eyes and let the warm and calm envelop him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His heart was still beating too fast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was too young for heart attacks, he knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there were always exceptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he should start taking an aspirin everyday…</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “Morning,” he replied a little later than he probably should have, slipping by her on his way to make his usual tea (barely steeped at all, a dash of cream, three sugars).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had no real business working at a coffee shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t a morning person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then, he wasn’t really an afternoon or evening person, either.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “How was your day yesterday?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was one of those relentlessly chipper people who felt the need to impose her happiness on others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was almost aggressive, really: Remus was going to make small talk and he was going to like it, dammit.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Remus shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Dull.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Homework.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “You know…” she began slyly— no, not slyly, blatantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I still have this really cute friend I think you’d like…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Remus rolled his eyes as he dipped his tea bag into the hot water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Lily,” he said, not actually looking at her but instead watching the water turn from clear to brown, “how many times do I have to tell you?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all gay men fancy each other.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “Yeah,” Lily continued, “but I think you’d be good together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just one date, that’s all I’m asking.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Lily had been going on about this friend of hers since Remus had accidentally outed himself during his first week of work at the coffee shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the time he was still dating Alex, but Lily was absolutely certain that Remus was destined to be with her friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After Alex had kicked him out, she brought this mysterious friend of hers up with increasing frequency, but by then brushing the guy off had become a matter of principle, a lesson to his straight coworkers that just because two men are gay that doesn’t mean they should date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Besides, blind dates never ended well for Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last one he’d been on had resulted in him dating Alex.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     But Remus was starting to seriously consider taking her up on the offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, Lily was alright, her friend would probably be okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he was starting to get desperate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And lonely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so very, very horny.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it can be really hard to get laid when one is a skinny nerd with very little free time and scars all over one’s body from a car crash when one was young.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “And besides,” Lily went on, “you’d be doing me a favor too, he’s been sort of listless recently… he’s between jobs… he doesn’t really know what to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think he just needs a good man to sort him out.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     That was a negative, then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus didn’t know why (alright, he did know why— it was the woolen jumpers and the 3.9 GPA and the yes-darling-of-course-I’d-love-to-meet-your-mother haircut) but people always assumed that he was the sort of guy who would just fix everything and everyone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of his friends tried to set him up with their pet queer fuck ups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few dates later, and Remus would have a broken heart at best and a few missing pieces of furniture at worst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or he’d end up homeless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are breakups, Remus thought, and there are breakups where you end up homeless.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “Look, Lily…” Remus said, lifting the bag out of his mug. He swung it like a little pendulum and released.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He watched as it sailed through the air and into the bin. “I’m sure he’s lovely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m sure he’s a great guy with a wonderful personality and a pert arse and I’m sure I’d fall in love with him if I just gave him a chance…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “But,” Lily replied.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “But,” Remus confirmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tossed his stirring straw at the bin like a mini javelin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It hit the rim and did a little backflip as it fell to the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I’m just not interested right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I need to focus on my studies and… I don’t know… something.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s too early for me to make a compelling argument.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “So say yes,” Lily said, arms crossed.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “Here’s my counterpoint,” Remus replied, eyeing her as he picked the straw up off the floor and threw it away properly, “no.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Lily smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or smirked, maybe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With Lily the two were pretty much interchangeable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“One of these days, Lupin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of these days I’m going to have the pleasure of introducing you to the love of your life.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Remus was about to make a reply he was sure would be so snappy and clever he’d be spending the rest of the day repeating it in his head and chuckling to himself, but the bell on the door rang and he had to hold his tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were overpriced vehicles for caffeine and sugar to concoct.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The people of London needed their neurotoxins so they could deal with the other people of London.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The conversation got lost in the mess of syrups and espresso shots and whipped cream that followed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two o’clock came around and it was time for Remus to leave.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     As he hung his apron up and grabbed his coat, Lily said, “don’t forget, Lupin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know your soulmate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Say the word and I can probably have you in bed with an Adonis <em>tonight</em>.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     This was starting to get annoying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you fucking serious?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily gave him a strange look, then thew her head back and laughed so loudly that a few nearby customers stopped their conversation and looked at her in confusion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No,” she managed to choke out between bouts of laughter, “but you could be.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus didn’t have time to question her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was already running late.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Bye, Lily,” he said, leaving the laughing woman behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Crazy ginger…</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The rest of Remus’s day passed in a narratively irrelevant blur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A bus and two underground stops later, and he was at campus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Six hours and two bus rides later, he was at the grocery store.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thirty pounds and yet another bus after that, and Remus was back home.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Upon his arrival, Remus noticed four things:</span>
</p><ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">The door to his flat was open.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">The light was on.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">There was a man in his flat.</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">The man was very, very sexy.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He was wearing traditional (stereotypical? cliché?) burglar clothing: black trousers, a black turtleneck (rolled up at the forearms) and black gloves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Silky black hair reached down towards his broad shoulders. His features were delicate and well sculpted — aristocratic, a writer would probably say, except aristocrats weren’t usually that good looking — and his skin was luminous as it was flawless, like polished marble.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was also clearly shocked to see Remus as well.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You live here?” the burglar asked, incredulous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His voice was smooth and somehow even more sexy than his face. It was the sort of posh usually reserved for period dramas about giant manor houses and unfortunate daughter to son ratios— the sort of poshness that existed for the sole purpose of reminding everyone else just how posh they <em>weren’t</em>.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Rather than barking out the “who the fuck are you?!” or “I’m calling the police!” he was likely supposed to, Remus felt a lump develop in his throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He coughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh, sorry?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar glanced around the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’ve got… <em>nothing</em>.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked pensive for a moment then he smiled suddenly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus felt light headed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll be right back,” the burglar said, breezing past Remus, who hadn’t left the doorway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As he brushed by, Remus caught a whiff of expensive-smelling cologne.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fucker even <em>smelled</em> sexy.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      And with that he was gone, leaving nothing but confusion and a sharp musk in his wake.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Actually, Remus realized as he came to his senses and started to inspect his flat, he left everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing had changed about the place since Remus had gone to work that morning,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>from the laptop resting on the milk crate he’d been using as a chair to the cardboard box he was using as a table to the small heap of clothing in the corner to the stack of books by the old duvet he slept on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing had been touched.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus finally forced his legs to work and put his groceries down on the small chipped formica counter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What had just happened finally started to sink in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus thought he should have felt angry, or maybe violated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, someone had <em>broken into his flat</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, his cheeks felt hot and his stomach tightened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was humiliated.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Quite possibly the most attractive man Remus had ever seen, and he was a burglar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A burglar who thought he was so pathetic he didn’t even bother to take anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hell, he hadn’t even seemed scared when Remus walked in on him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Remus fucking <em>apologized.</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      <em>Wait… shit,</em> Remus thought as he put his groceries away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>Was I supposed to call the police</em>?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He somehow even fucked up getting burgled.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He pulled his phone of his pocket instinctually, but didn't move to make a call.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What was he supposed to say?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, hello, I’d like to report a crime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This pretty posh boy with eyes like storm clouds and a mouth like sin just appeared in my flat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t take anything, but he made me feel embarrassed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Actually, please send an ambulance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think I may die of humiliation.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus sank to the floor and let his head fall back against the fridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It made an audible thud.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What did one do in this situation?</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He glanced over at the pile of textbooks in the corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Study, he should just study.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      So Remus spent the next hour trying to replace thoughts of sexy burglars in tight black trousers with thoughts of 16th century battles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was starting to achieve something like success when he heard loud shuffling and shouting coming from the stairwell outside is flat.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>      “Pick up your end, you git!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>     “I was taking a rest, you just shoved me into the wall!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> <em><span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>“I’m not holding this thing on the middle of a fucking stairwell!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Move!”</em> </span> <span class="s1"> <em> <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span> </em> </span></p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>     “</em></span>
  <span class="s1"><em>Fine, fine”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>     “To the left!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, your other left!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>     “That’s my right”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>     “Well, it’s my left!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>     “Well, it’s my right!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <em>     “Prongs, I swear, if you don’t start moving I’m going to drop this thing on you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then you’re never going to get to go out with Evans and you’re going to go to the afterlife not knowing what she looks like naked.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>     "… your left, then?”</em> </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The conversation got steady louder because… well, they were themselves getting steadily louder, but also because they were moving towards Remus’s door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>thud right outside his flat and Remus’s doorbell rang.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sounded disturbingly innocent and normal when compared to the conversation that had proceeded it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus scrambled up to answer the door.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On the other side stood the sexy posh burglar and a tall man with messy hair and glasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In between them was a large leather sofa.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Hi,” the burglar said, a wide grin on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I brought you a sofa.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus stepped out of the way instinctually as the men picked the thing up and brought it into the flat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The man with glasses moved the cardboard box/milk crate system Remus had set up gently out of the way with his foot as they set it down in the middle of the room.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar wiped some sweat from his brow and looked over at Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His cheeks were slightly flushed from the effort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus tried really hard not to think of it as a post-sex face.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus couldn’t meet the man’s eye, so instead he looked down at the sofa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It dominated the room, standing taller than just about anything other than the fridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was clearly expensive, and actually looked like an antique.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Er… where did you get that?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar and the man with glasses exchanged a look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar smirked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nicked it from Buckingham palace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Queen hasn’t used it in years, don’t worry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You won’t get in trouble.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Ah,” Remus replied, “right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, if she’s not using it…”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He probably should have pressed the matter further.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, he definitely should have pressed the matter further.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he was afraid he wouldn’t like the answer and would have to do something about returning the thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it looked really comfy.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The man with glasses shot Remus a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We figured it was going to waste, so…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So,” Remus parroted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, uh, thank you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah, thank you worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would just stick with thank you.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The man with glasses turned to the burglar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m parked illegally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We should get the rest before I get a ticket.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      <em>The rest?</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good point.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He glanced up at Remus, his stupidly pretty grey eyes filled with mirth, “be right back.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus was left standing there dumbly and wondering why burglars wouldn’t be worried about getting in trouble over breaking into someone’s house, but would be worried about getting a parking ticket.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      But he didn’t have long to linger on the thought, because they had returned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar had a coffee table tucked under his arm, and the man with glasses held a television in one arm and a cardboard box in the other.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar placed the coffee table down in front of the sofa and the man with glasses set his things down beside it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Right,” the burglar said, “we’ve got to run.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I think I’ve got you a bed too… that’ll be a few days.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Before Remus could think of a reply beyond “uh, thanks?” the pair were gone, and Remus was left alone yet again with the smell of the burglar’s cologne.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus examined the box that had been set down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In it was a Playstation (the new one, he noted) along with a few controllers and some games.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He briefly considered setting up the system, but decided he was far too tired.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sat down on the sofa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was very soft, and accepted his weight readily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He ran his fingers over the smooth leather.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was very finely made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d never lived somewhere with something so nice in it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wherever it had come from, there was money.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lots of it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-/-</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Remus would have loved to tell people that that night he couldn’t sleep, that he was consumed by guilt and came up with a plan to return the sofa to its rightful owners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would have loved to say that he went right to his duvet and slept there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would have been lying.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The truth was, that night Remus Lupin slept better than he had in months, and when he woke up his back didn’t hurt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And when he went to work he was <em>chipper</em>— Remus Lupin was not a chipper man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had never been chipper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had initiated conversation with Lily that morning and she was so shocked she actually dropped the croissant she was putting out on display.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he went home that day, the television was on a stand and plugged in and there was a small table with some chairs by the kitchen area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Atop the table was a small bouquet of flowers in a Chinese-style vase.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A note on the table read: <em>From a back room in Parliament.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They won’t miss it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You aren’t in trouble. </em>in elegant script.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus felt strangely giddy because one, a beautiful man brought him flowers, however odd the delivery; two, he wouldn’t have to eat while sitting on a milk crate anymore; and three, the burglar came back.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Maybe Remus shouldn’t have been that excited about continuing a relationship that was comprised entirely of a beautiful man entering his home without permission and leaving him expensive and suspiciously sourced pieces of furniture, but he was.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The table was clearly an antique and appeared to be a particularly nice one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Intricately carved wood made up the back of the chairs and the table itself had a smooth and glossy top, shining from a hundred years of regular polishing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parliament, the note had said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus felt a slight jolt of anxiety in his stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Intellectually, he knew the situation was wrong, but he couldn’t bring himself to call the police.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, he decided to consult The Books.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Bibliomancy, his mother (who yes, is exactly as New Age-y as one would expect anyone who wrote <em>Remus</em> on her son’s birth certificate would be) had taught him years ago, was the art of divining information by opening a book to a random page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first thing you read is something you need to know.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Though Remus was an avowed skeptic (well, as much of a skeptic as someone riddled with anxiety can be — he’d once been able to convince himself that fairies did in fact exist and existed solely for the purpose of ensuring that he was never able to find a seat on the underground after a long shift at the coffee shop), he never quite lost the habit of consulting books when he needed some sort of guidance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since his mother had started sending him all the self help books, he’d taken to using them for bibliomancy.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He gathered The Books on his lap and closed his eyes, allowing his fingers to run along their spines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He felt a slight tingling warmth in his fingers as he moved over one (or at least he thought he did) and picked that one out.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      <em>The Little Book of Mindfulness</em> was a purple and gold number with small lotus blossom embellishments on the corners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus closed his eyes and opened the book at a random page.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      <em>Fear of the Unknown.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus felt a small jolt go down his spine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hated it when these things seemed relevant.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      <em>Humans have an inherent fear of what we do not know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In reality, this fear is not of the Unknown itself but rather what we think we know about the Unknown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surprises and mysteries have a natural allure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next time you encounter an Unknown, rather than try to solve it or avoid it, savor the fact that you do not know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Romanticize it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rather than trying to invent something in the void, breath into it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Know that it is okay to not know, and live in the space of not knowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Love the Unknown.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus closed the book and put it aside, rubbing the back of his neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered if the person who wrote the book was a mental health professional.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered if he ought to take the advice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered if he was crazy for wanting to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered if wondering if he was crazy was good for his mental health.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Eventually, the spirals of his thoughts drove him to bed (or, as it was, sofa) and he fell into a fitful sort of sleep.</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Wednesday, Remus came home to the burglar in his kitchen. There was a new island with two stools beside it in the middle of the kitchen, and the burglar was in the process of putting away a large assortment of small appliances.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Oh,” the burglar said with a smile, “you’re home.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      It was like this was the most normal thing in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like Remus lived with this man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like they were together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus liked it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus nodded towards the new things on his counter: a microwave, a blender, a new kettle, a food processor, a rack of frying pans, a set of cooking utensils.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Let me guess, from some posh restaurant in Soho.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar’s eyes widened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He apparently hadn’t expected Remus to make a joke. His lips (his plump, red, almost girlish lips) quirked up. “Yeah,” he replied shortly after, “want to know which one?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Nope,” Remus replied, popping the<em> p</em> and remembering the advice of the Books.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He approached the box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe if he acted cool enough the burglar would come to accept him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, though stealing was objectively bad there was still a prevailing idea in society that people who stole things were cool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar was wearing a t-shirt advertising a band Remus didn’t recognize and his hair was unironically pulled back into a manbun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was so stereotypically cool that his comfort with being stereotypical launched him into a whole new strata of coolness.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Good,” the burglar said, chuckling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So, how was your day?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> Remus blinked once in reply to the strangely normal question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh… good, actually,” he said, and it wasn’t until the words were out of his mouth that he realized like he sounded surprised, like he wasn’t the sort of person who normally had good days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which he guessed he was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He paused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yours?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Long,” the burglar replied with exaggerated exhaustion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I started by trying to break into this mansion, but I couldn’t get past the dogs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I went on a sprint through the city and ended up jumping into another manor where I saw this island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, the police followed me in, so I had to take it for a ride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has castors, you see,” Remus looked down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were, in fact, wheels on the bottom of the island, “so I took it out to the back garden and rode it down the hill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They followed me on foot, not being able to fit their cars into the garden, so I quickly lost them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, I then ended up on the street, where I was forced to proceed at a very rapid pace to avoid being hit by a car or bus or cyclist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually I was run off the road and crashed into the restaurant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The staff was taking a break so I took advantage of the situation and collected some fine kitchenware.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was rolling along the street when I came into your neighborhood and decided that you could use it more than me.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus blinked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sounds exhausting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So is that how this works?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you encounter something, you just take it and deposit it somewhere else?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried to keep the accusatory note out of his voice, and he wasn’t sure if he was successful.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar didn’t reply immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, he just made very prolonged, very uncomfortable eye contact with Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes were a dark sort of grey, Remus thought, like storm clouds rolling in just before it rains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mother of fuck, he needed to get laid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Things have been known to … find their way into my possession,” he finally said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus knew the burglar was being purposefully evasive, but decided not to push it further.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was going to try to follow the Book’s advice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To love the fact that he didn’t know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Infinite possibilities surrounded the elusive burglar, and Remus suspected the answer might not be something he wanted to know.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Right… so… thank you?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Don’t mention it,” the burglar said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Seriously,” he added, his lips quirking, “don’t.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He returned to setting up the new things in Remus’s kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you like Mexican food?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Not where Remus thought the conversation would go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes?” he replied, like he was asking permission.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Good!” the burglar said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulled a grocery bag up from the floor and set it on the island with a heavy thunk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Because I’ve been wanting to make guacamole for a while.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      And that was how, less than half an hour later, Remus and the burglar were sitting on the expensive old sofa watching a movie and eating nachos. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Oooh,” the burglar said at one point, grabbing Remus’s arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is my favorite part!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus tried to pay attention to the movie, but all he could focus on was the fact that the burglar was touching him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tiny little part of him that thought that maybe the whole thing was a giant hallucination was finally cast aside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar was touching him, he had physical form and could touch him and <em>oh my god he could touch him….</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus jumped when the burglar started laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar looked over at him, but his face fell when he realized that Remus wasn’t laughing as well.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I uh… I’ve been watching this movie since I was a kid, so I always just found it funny, you know… for nostalgia’s sake.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A slight, gratuitously attractive flush came to the burglar’s cheeks, and Remus realized that he was self-conscious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar, for all his posh-ness and cool-ness and manbun-ness, cared whether or not Remus thought that scene was funny.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus felt nervous tingles running hot and cold across his skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can we watch it again?” he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I was distracted.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The flush on the burglar’s face deepened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah,” he said, picking up the remote.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      When he put it down, he leaned forward to grab a nacho off the top and dip them in the guacamole, as the burglar moved back onto the sofa, he scooted ever so slightly closer to Remus.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus took some food of his own and did the same sneaky scoot over.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The scene rolled around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They both laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It <em>was</em> funny.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Neither acknowledged the closeness or how their legs fell together and were touching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither mentioned the strangeness of the situation.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      And half of Remus’s willpower was directed at trying not to get any closer to the burglar, while the other half was focused on trying to love not knowing.</span>

  <span class="s1">      The next day was Thursday, the day Remus met with his study group.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn't come home until late.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His heart sank when he got home and saw no strip of light under the door.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar had come and left.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a wardrobe in corner now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also looked like an antique: there were silk screens running across the two front panels on the wardrobe’s doors featuring images of cherry blossoms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus opened it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His clean clothing was neatly hung on new hangers or folded up in the drawers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His dirty clothing was in a wicker hamper at the side of the wardrobe.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus smiled, then felt his stomach drop as he remembered the fact that he didn’t really separate his dirty clothes from his clean clothes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He just used the sniff test to determine if they were available for use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He grabbed the sleeve of one of the shirts hanging up and took a whiff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He checked a garment in the hamper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dirty.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus groaned as his head treated him to a vibrant IMAX-quality mental movie of the burglar smelling all of his clothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was perhaps the strangest, strongest, and most indirect intimacy he’d ever shared with another person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He slumped onto the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was his life now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had burglars sorting his pants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had criminals sniffing his socks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A man who looked like an underwear model and talked like the unholy love child of a phone sex operator and a 19th century duke had smelled his sweat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was probably laughing about it with all of his posh burglar buddies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He bet there was a clubhouse somewhere where they all sipped expensive French liquor he’d never heard of and discussed in intimate, glaring, bracing, scabbing… everything-ing detail the precise nature of one Remus John Lupin’s underwear collection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The old grey-ish pair he was too cheap to throw out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Batman pair his mum had bought him last Christmas because she either didn’t understand that her twenty-three year old son didn’t want his mum buying him underwear anymore or because she understood perfectly and enjoyed the embarrassed look on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or, fuck, the joke pair Peter had also gotten him last Christmas that were covered in glow-in-the-dark pickles and said <em>Tickle My Pickle </em>all over in green text.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      A moment later, he realized that he’d missed something in his embarrassed mental tangent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a sticky note on the inside of the wardrobe’s door.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      <em>From a mansion in Kensington.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don’t worry, they won’t miss it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>P.S.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What brand of deodorant do you use?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s very nice.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus banged his head against the wardrobe, and a small avalanche of clothing came down on him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was quite some time before he moved from under the pile.</span>

  <span class="s1">     On Friday, the bed arrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus had opted out of drinks with some of his classmates to get home as early as possible, but the burglar wasn’t there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, there was a monstrosity of a bed in the corner where his lumpy old duvet had been.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The bed itself was not terribly big, but made up for its small size with ridiculous elaborateness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was four posters, with intricately carved wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gossamer curtains hung from the top.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It looked like something a fairy princess would sleep in, honestly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a thick new duvet on the bed and a deeply impractical assortment of pillows and cushions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus had never seen such a set up outside of one of those out-of-date decorator’s magazines he’d flipped through while waiting for a doctor’s appointment to begin.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      For all the disappointment, small bouts of giddiness fluttered around in his stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A real bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had been quite some time since Remus had last slept in a real bed.</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He hesitated for a moment because he didn’t want to disrupt the masterful way in which the bed was made, but eventually his impulse won out and Remus flung himself backwards onto the mattress.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Immediately, he realized he had made a mistake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bedding gave off a distinct scent— the cologne the burglar used. The burglar had been all over this bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus imagined what he must have looked like while making it, bending over and showing off his tight, round arse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He closed his eyes and giddy butterflies in his stomach gave way to heavier sensations further south.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar lying down among the sheets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar naked and bellow him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar reaching down for his cock…</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus slid his hand into his trousers at the thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He squeezed his hardening prick, imagining that his hand was that of the burglar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those elegant fingers wrapping around him…</span>

  <span class="s1">      He started stroking himself in earnest then, undoing his trousers and pulling his cock out, now fully hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He imagined the burglar on his knees in front of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sucking him, kissing up his length, letting Remus fuck his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He imagined the heat of his mouth, the burglar’s hands all over whatever he couldn’t get his lips on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He started thrusting up into his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar was amazing at giving head — as all fantasy partners are — and took everything Remus gave him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus imagined threading his fingers through that long black hair… was it as soft as it looked, he wondered?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could he make the burglar’s back arch if he pulled back on it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In his head, the burglar gasped as Remus tugged on his silky hair, lips swollen and wet.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus gasped as he came.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a moment of panic, he wondered if he got any jizz on the new duvet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fortunately, Remus saw, it appeared his old t-shirt had taken one for the team and was the only casualty of the impromptu wank he’d had atop a stolen bed to the scent of a criminal.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Later that night, Remus noticed a small crumple of paper on the floor by bin in the kitchen, tinged blue at the creases like it had been in the pocket of a new pair of jeans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He straightened the wad out, and found that it was two long slips of paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were both receipts from earlier that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first receipt (from an expensive department store Remus recognized by name but had never personally entered) listed pillows, sheets, cushions, curtains… bedding of all sorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The total came up to a few hundred quid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second was for a mattress, valued at well over a thousand pounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus stared over at the fairy princess bed as the realization slowly settled in.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar may have stolen the bed, but he’d bought everything on it.</span>

  <span class="s1">      It’s weird, how people become suddenly aware of where the line is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like Remus’s mother with bugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hope Lupin didn’t like large bugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Small bugs, fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Large bugs, <em>oh motherfucking no get that away from me fuck fuck fuck</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Remus could never tell exactly where the line is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One day, he asked her what separated a big bug from a small bug in her mind.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You know,” she’d said, “I couldn’t tell you without seeing one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I just about jump out of my skin and start throwing profanity around like it’s confetti, that’s how I know.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      For Remus, the line was apparently when the burglar started buying things from him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It didn’t mean he was no longer okay with the situation (weirdly, potentially accessory-to-burglary okay with the situation), it more opened a floodgate of questions he’d been ignoring for days, like the Book had told him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want to think about where those nice things had actually come from, but now the questions had arrived and they didn’t want to shut up. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Maybe the man was a criminal, but he apparently had a considerable amount of money at his disposal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he’d actually bought everything?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How much money had he spent on Remus’s flat?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What did he want in return?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wait, shit, was this a scam?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was Remus going to come home one day and have a bag thrown over his head?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was he going to be tossed in a shipping container and sold into slavery?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was he going to be working in a gulag this time next week?</span>

He was going to jail, there was no question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His mother and father were going to watch the news one day and his face would be right there and he was that pervert who had a wank on an antique stolen from the palace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe if he pled guilty, they’d let him request the death penalty.</span>

  <span class="s1">      Muscle memory guided his hands to all the right pumps and bottles, but his mind was very far away (somewhere near Pentonville).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if he did get arrested for all of the things in his house?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Despite what the notes said, someone must have noticed that the things were gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was going to get in trouble.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How would he even defend himself in court, “well you see, the burglar was very attractive and I hadn’t slept on anything comfortable in a very long time, so I just didn’t question where the items came from…”?</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus didn’t reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He studied the hand he had submerged in ice water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tingly pain of the burn was dancing its way across his skin.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You’re lucky you only spilled it on your hand, you could have gotten it all over yourself.”</span>

  <span class="s1">      “What has you so distracted?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve never seen you like this before.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily studied him from across the table in the break room.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus searched for the right words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finding there weren’t any, he went with the first ones he could come up with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There have been some… strange developments in my life recently.”</span>

  <span class="s1">     “Oh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She raised a perfectly manicured red brow.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yes,” Remus continued.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s been very confusing.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Confusing like how?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily’s eyes brightened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is it a boy?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus was frustrated and in pain, he wasn’t in the mood to gossip about the burglar with Lily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The person in question is male, yes, but it’s not ‘a boy,’ a boy, like you’re implying.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I was implying something?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She sounded very proud of herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus’s life wasn’t usually interesting or layered enough to merit implying anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a rare opportunity.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yes,” Remus gave her his best accusatory glare, which he knew was probably not very intimidating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt good anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You were implying that this male person my be in some way a potential romantic partner. <em> A boy</em>.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So who is he, if not <em>a boy</em>?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily asked, placing the same dramatic emphasis on the last two words as Remus had.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “He’s…” what was he?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’s just an acquaintance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I find him… confusing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>And beautiful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And sexy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I want to do unspeakable things to him on a sofa that may or may not belong to the Queen.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Riiiiiight,” Lily looked him up and down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, if you ever want a real date, I do have that friend I’ve been meaning to introduce you to.”</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus rolled his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Lily—“</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      She threw up her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know, I know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all gay men fancy each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I still think you’d like him.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus didn’t bother replying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had enough boy drama without having to worry about a blind date.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Shit, Remus thought, he was considering a criminal breaking into his house “boy drama.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What as next?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe if the cashier at the grocery store asked him about his day, he’d be stunned by his vibrant social life. If he found 5p on the ground, he’d probably be amazed by his new windfall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When did he get so pathetic?</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Maybe he’s always been pathetic, he thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he’s just noticing it more now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe he’d been slowly becoming increasingly more pathetic as time has wore on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered if there was a metric by which one could measure one’s own pathetic-ness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered if self monitoring was the best method to go about doing that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered if maybe it was better if it was measured by someone else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered who would be the best person to measure that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered if anyone would ever bother to do something like that.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had always been given to mental tangents, but usually they were about problems he’d invented in his own head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now that he had an actual strange thing happening, it was getting worse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had the burns to prove it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe it was time to do something sensible.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You’re spacing out again,” Lily said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thinking about your <em>acquaintance</em>?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “No,” Remus said, “I was wallowing in self pity.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily frowned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Remus —“</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus could sense a lecture coming on, no doubt a glorious lecture filled with empathy and loveliness about how Remus was a wonderful guy and brilliant and magnificent and angels sang when he entered the room and so he should never feel bad about himself because every gay man he walked by on the street probably creamed himself when they saw Remus and Alex was an idiot and there are plenty of pretty gay fish in the Queer Sea and he just needs to get out there and go on a date with her gay friend who by the way can play guitar and speaks French and has a beautiful body and she would have totally fucked him if he was straight but he’s gay so Remus should fuck him and they would be perfect together and it would be perfect Remus with her perfect friend and it would all be beautiful and Remus please stop getting down on yourself you’re such a great guy.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He was very much not in the mood for that lecture, so he pulled his hand out of the water and examined it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been on the wrong end of an espresso machine before, but this was definitely one of the more nasty burns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t going to be a pretty sight in a few hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The shift in temperature brought a whole new round of unpleasant tingling to the hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wiggled his fingers experimentally and gasped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Experiment a failure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Abort.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “How’s the hand?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Not great, but I should be fine in a moment.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily looked down at the hand in question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her lips were pursed in concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Maybe, but you’re done for the day.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus was about to protest, but Lily held her hand up, “don’t worry, as far as corporate is concerned, you worked your full shift.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See you Monday.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thanks, Lily.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily just gave him a warm grin and a nod in acknowledgment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Have fun with your <em>not boy</em> male person acquaintance thingy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And remember — my friend has a six pack.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yes, Lily,” Remus replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sure he’s lovely.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’m not kidding,” Lily replied as she straightened out her apron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Six pack,” she whispered, gesturing at her stomach.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus grumbled to himself as he tried to put his coat on without hurting himself (he failed).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck “loving the unknown” and the pretty burglar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This silliness needed to end.</span>

</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “What happened to your hand?!?!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar grabbed Remus’s wrist and started down the mess of red skin and blisters in stunningly attractive horror.</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus blinked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was not how his evening was supposed to go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was supposed to be angry, instead every single nerve in his body rejected its post and rushed towards the area where the burglar was touching him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had anyone ever had an orgasm from having their wrist held?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had he just discovered a new erogenous zone?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had sexual frustration actually changed his anatomy?</span>

<p class="p2">

  <span class="s1">      “Oh,” <em>I was too spaced out thinking about how I was going to go to jail because I’d wanked while thinking about you on a piece of furniture that may or may not have been from Buckingham palace so I spilled a venti sized cup of boiling water on my hand</em> was too lengthy and honest an explanation, so instead Remus just said, “I punched a dragon in the face.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar looked down at the burn, and then up at Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You punched a dragon in the face?”</span>

  <span class="s1">      Remus nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dragon was trying to mug me so I punched it in the face.”</span>

  <span class="s1">      “And it still got your gold?”</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus rolled his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t sure who he was more annoyed with: himself, for making up stories, or the burglar, for indulging them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Of course, it’s a dragon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know I may ooze masculinity from every pore, but even I have a difficult time when it comes to melee with a dragon.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Fair enough…” the burglar conceded, his lips quirking slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Though you’d think mugging people would be a pretty slow way to build up a horde.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It takes them a long time, yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But they’re dragons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’ve got time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Honestly that one probably won’t mug anyone for a year or two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they were around too often the government would probably do something.”</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar bit his lip to prevent himself from laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he released it it was all pretty and red and swollen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus wanted to lick it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t know what I would have done if I’d encountered that ruffian on my way home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have an irrational fear of lizards.”</span>

</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Remus remembered that he was alone in a room with a man with washboard abs and nothing on but a towel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So, sorry about the water pressure.”</span>

  <span class="s1">      The burglar seemed unfazed by the sudden change of topic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, you should be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any responsible tenant would have had the pipes and water heaters replaced years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How dare you let your land lady down like that?”</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      While most of Remus’s attention was still geared towards the V of the burglar’s hips and how the towel was slowly sinking down that V, the small part of him that was still capable of intelligent thought wondered how the burglar knew that the person who owned his building was a woman.</span>

  <span class="s1">      “It’s okay, I’m sure she forgives you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, I was mostly just stopping by to drop off some towels and other bathroom things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately I was attacked by zombies on my way over here — and not those boring gray hobbling zombies you see in some movies, I’m talking those really gross half decayed zombies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Super juicy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had to break out all of my advanced mixed martial arts skills to get by them and keep them off of the towels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knew London could get dangerous, but dragons and zombies in one day?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar liked to talk with his hands, and the rest of him moved with his arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The towel was slipping down at a gloriously alarming rate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus was trying very hard not to look at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So very hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What happened to the good old days, when all you had to do was watch out for goblins in the underground and try not to accidentally kick a fairy in Hyde Park?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar gripped the knot of the towel and quickly tightened it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus’s attention returned to the conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or whatever this exchange was.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Could just be the time of the month,” he commented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The full moon’s tomorrow.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Is it?” the burglar asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I guess that makes sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you generally keep track of the moon?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yeah,” Remus nodded, and decided not to elaborate further.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since his mom was the New Age type, and full moons had always been a “thing” in the Lupin household.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He still had a moon tracking app on his phone, though usually the only way he celebrated it was by buying himself more chocolate than normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a special occasion, after all.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Must be frightening,” the burglar noted, “I’ll bring you some silver tomorrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Keep the werewolves at bay.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Only if you take it from the British museum,” Remus insisted with a small smile on his lips.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar frowned slightly, like he didn’t understand what Remus had just said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh…” understanding flashed in his gray eyes, “yeah, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m sure they’ll have something nice.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He shifted awkwardly on his bare feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, I really ought to get dressed,” he finally said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      <em>Or you could just stay naked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you’re cold, I’ve got some very cozy blankets on my bed… </em>Remus fortunately clamped his mouth shut before his brain words became his mouth words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, right… didn’t even notice…” he mumbled noncommittally, his cheeks growing red.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar shot him a weak smile and ducked back into the bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he emerged, he was wearing a pair of distractingly tight black jeans and a flannel shirt rolled up to his forearms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus wondered how it was that seeing the forearms of a man who’d been half naked moments ago could be so damned erotic.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I guess I’ll see you later,” the burglar said as he walked out the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus stared dumbly at the old, cheap front door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t shake the feeling that he had said something wrong.</span>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      After running some errands Sunday, Remus came home to the burglar sitting on his sofa (<em>not my sofa</em>, he mentally corrected himself, <em>the sofa of Undisclosed Victim Number One from whose misfortune I am currently benefiting</em>) and eating toast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He raised one slice by way of greeting and Remus slipped happily into the seat by him, pushing down any feelings of apprehension and/or guilt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently he was back to “loving the unknown.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You’ve… ah…” Remus gestured at his mouth.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Hmm?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh,” the burglar said as he wiped his hand across his mouth, which only resulted in the Nutella that had been under his lip spreading slightly.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Uh, you didn’t quite get it,” Remus said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Could you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the burglar asked, leaning forward slightly.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      <em>You bet your beautiful sweet arse I could,</em> Remus thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He ran his thumb across the area under the burglar’s lips before he had time to get nervous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus and the burglar made semi-hot semi-awkward eye contact as Remus gathered the spread up, relishing in the feel of the burglar’s skin — both smooth and rough with a few days’ worth of stubble.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus glanced around for something to wipe his hand with, and, finding nothing, decided to just lick the spread off his thumb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar stared at him openly, mouth slightly ajar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus was so shocked to see a man so gorgeous look at him with such open lust that he fell into a sort of autopilot and his lips closed around the thumb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The familiar sweet taste of the spread made his mouth water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took him a moment to realize he was literally sucking his thumb, and he let his hand drop to his lap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar’s eyes didn’t leave his lips.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar leaned in slightly, and Remus’s heart started pounding in his ears.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Get away from my man you <em>bleeep</em>!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The two men jumped at the shout that had come from the television.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some loud daytime program where people yelled at each other about paternity tests was on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus watched dumbly as some fight between a wife and a babysitter broke out.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I brought you some silver,” the burglar said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Oh,” Remus replied, remembering their conversation the day before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because “thank you” was the only think he really could say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He glanced down at jar of Nutella on the coffee table, which had a knife he didn’t recognize sticking out of it. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “It’s part of a set,” the burglar explained, handing him the butter knife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The box is on the counter.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus examined the knife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It, like everything else the burglar had brought him, was of exceptionally fine quality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The silver of the handle flowed in a design reminiscent of ivy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the end of the handle was the letter <em>B</em>.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “It’s… beautiful,” Remus commented.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a gentle, fond sort of smile, the kind people usually reserve for old friends or young children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since Remus was neither, he wasn’t quite sure what to make of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His mind was too occupied with the fact that the burglar was about to kiss him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or, at least, he was moving in the way people generally did when they were about to kiss people in movies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that wasn’t possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if the burglar was gay (which… yeah, maybe) he couldn’t have been attracted to Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That just didn’t happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People like him simply didn’t shag people who were so desperate for attention that they allowed a burglar to hang around their house for the better part of a week and report nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t get his hopes up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He <em>could not </em>get his hopes up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He…</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      His hopes were up.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Dread sank down to the pit of Remus’s stomach.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So how’s your hand doing?” the burglar asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Huh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus’s neck snapped up so quickly and at such a strange angle that a bolt of pain stabbed into his neck’s side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He winced slightly.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Your hand,” the burglar repeated, jutting his chin towards the bandages on Remus’s hand.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Oh,” Remus studied the wrapping as if he’d never seen it before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It hurts like a bitch.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Is there anything you can do or take…?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar trailed off as Remus shook his head.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Not really,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m just sorta used to it… burns and scrapes and stuff,” he explained quickly in response to the concern on the burglar’s face, “I was a clumsy child.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar narrowed his eyes slightly, but seemed to decide against further questioning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The people on screen continued to go at each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus watched with a sort of disappointed apathy as some woman screamed at a fourteen year old dressed like a vampire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He generally avoided this sort of programming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had a sort of soul sucking property, he’d always thought.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I don’t really like this stuff,” the burglar said eventually.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was staring forward with glassy eyes, and Remus couldn’t tell if he was talking to him or himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But this time of day it’s this or soap operas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And after a while it’s almost addictive, like cheap sweets or oddly flavored crisps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t like it, but I can’t really stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it feels like it’s sucking out my soul.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar tore his eyes away from the screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Does that make sense?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I try to avoid them, but sometimes I get caught up on a day off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I start to care about who the father is and then there’s the day.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “There’s the day,” the burglar repeated to himself quietly. “So how do you like to spend your days off?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus hadn’t been expecting the question, so he gave the generic sort of answer: “reading, I guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe wandering around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since starting the master’s program days off haven’t really been much of a thing… you?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar’s lip quirked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t really look amused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Watching rubbish on the telly, apparently.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus nodded, and the conversation fizzled out again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two men on screen started exchanging blows at one point and they both leaned forward with a primitive kind of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus then made an executive decision and pressed the power button on the remote.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, the angle was wrong or he wasn’t using the right remote or the Universe just hated him and wanted to make everything he did just that much more difficult, because it took him a few tries and some fumbling to get the damned thing to turn off.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar was observing him with an affectionate sort of amusement, and Remus felt the heat in his cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he should grow it out like the burglar, then he could hide behind it like a curtain and let the whole world think whether or not he really had cheeks, never mind ones prone to sunburns or blushing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, that would be far better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could be like a cartoon character, like the emo kid in the back of a classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he’d dye it black, no one will question hiding behind a curtain of black hair, but everyone would question his own hair color at such a length.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was it just the emo thing that made it so it was only acceptable to have black hair covering your face? <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because that was hardly fair and…</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You okay over there?” the burglar asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Fine,” Remus squeaked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He cleared his throat, and repeated himself: “fine.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except when he did it his voice was deeper than normal so now he sounded like he did while his voice was still breaking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Remus had gone through puberty and it was <em>bloody awful</em> and he fucking <em>earned</em> his deep voice and dropped balls and old acne scars and good God the burglar was staring at him and he was thinking about acne and shit what to say — </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Do you like art?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar looked only slightly taken aback.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Sure… I guess?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus closed his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>Breathe.</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“More of a lit guy, to be honest.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’m more of a music guy, to be honest,” the amusement was clear in the burglar’s tone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus was glad he could make the man laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He just wished it was intentionally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But since you brought up art… do you prefer more classical styles or modern art?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <strong>     </strong>“Classical.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Modern art makes no sense to me, really,” he leaned back in the sofa, and perked up slightly as a story came to mind, “I have a friend in the arts program at my university, and she spent all of last semester working on a piece for a building on our campus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were having a competition among the students to see who could create the best piece.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They would buy the winner’s work.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus’s smiled as he forgot about the fact that the most uncomfortably attractive man he’d ever met was within bone-jumping distance and recounted an anecdote he’d told dozens of times over pints or coffee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You know what she came up with?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He paused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wanted to hear a response.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “A statue of a urinal with ‘Capitalism’ spray painted on the side?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the burglar suggested.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Nope,” Remus chuckled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Dots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a white canvas.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “What color were the dots?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus grinned at the blank screen in front of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could see their reflection: him, staring ahead with a rare smirk playing on his lips, and the burglar facing him, anticipating a punchline.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus paused for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a nice scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was mindful of it, or at least thought that he should be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  Even after all those books, h</span>e still wasn’t 100% sure what mindfulness was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“White.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She didn’t.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Oh, yes,” Remus replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She put a new layer of white paint on it every day for the whole semester, and by the time she submitted it, the dots were raised fairly highly off the canvas.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Huh,” the burglar said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s almost cool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did she win?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “No.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So who —” there was a ringing sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar took his phone out of his pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Shit,” he said, looking at the screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry, but I have to take this.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus nodded and tried not to let the disappointment show on his face.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Hello?” the burglar said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, I’m away right now, I — what?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are you serious?!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus glanced back at the sudden shift in tone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar looked very annoyed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, I know, I know, ha ha.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You think you’re the first person who ever made that joke?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right, I’m sorry, just — okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can it wait?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You close at… what time is it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right… I’ll, uh, I’ll be there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thank you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tuesday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll be right there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bye.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar slid his phone back into his pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry, but I need to run.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something’s just come up.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Okay, no problem,” Remus said, trying to put on his best okay-no-problem face.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar quickly cleaned off the silver knife he’d been using and grabbed the coat he’d left draped over the side of the couch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So what did the winner do?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’m sorry?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Your friend didn’t win, what was the winning submission?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The real answer was a rather boring abstract sculpture made of wrought iron, so Remus had long since invented a much better conclusion to the story, one he told everyone who hadn’t gone to his university: “Stripes.”</span>

  <span class="s1">     On Tuesday, Remus opened the door to a trail of rose petals leading around the corner to his bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a moment he got excited, only to then find that the burglar had written the words <em>you’re out of toilet paper</em> in petals on his bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t until he went to bed that evening (after carefully removing all of the petals) that he noticed the burglar had brought him a bedside table, which, like the chairs and table, was intricately carved from some sort of dark wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A beautiful old lamp with a stained glass shade sat on top of the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus clicked it on and then off before slipping under the covers, hit again like he was on every night by the scent of the burglar’s cologne.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He closed his eyes and his mind wandered, as it always did, to the burglar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unanswered questions flowed into vague sexual fantasies (loving the unknown indeed, he thought).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In moments, Remus was both confused and hard (an annoyingly regular combination over the last week or so).</span>

  <span class="s1">      Remus sighed, waiting for the humiliation to show up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It didn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he’d run out, he thought, though he doubted it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He grabbed the lube and a few tissues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tugged at himself quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A strange slideshow of the burglar’s face and body ran through his head, and even the thought of the burglar himself buying Remus wanking/fucking supplies made an appearance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus was quick and efficient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t long before he was done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He guiltily placed the wadded tissue on the no doubt priceless antique furniture and turned over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bed sent another cloud of cologne up in response and Remus groaned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was so fucked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-/-</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     Wednesday, the burglar brought him a bookcase.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had a similar pattern carved into it as the nightstand and coffee table, which added to the theory Remus was developing that all of the furniture came from the same house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He felt a little stab of guilt in his stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His righteous plans a few days ago to put an end to this silliness had been thwarted by the intervention of <em>those beautiful back muscles.</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He should have called the police long ago.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      But if he was being completely honest with himself, he really didn’t want to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want to get the beautiful and weirdly considerate man in trouble, and he didn’t want the furniture to go away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want the game to end and he didn’t want the weird bubble to pop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because that’s what it felt like, a weird bubble.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Loving the unknown” had given way to a weird pressure system in his mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he started to think about the larger implications of the burglar’s presence in his life, he could feel an almost physical pressure in his brain, like a bubble or something… he didn’t know what to call it, and he didn’t know whether he wanted to keep the questions unanswered or not.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      So for then he wasn’t going to do anything.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Because the bookshelf was stocked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus felt the pressure in his head turn into pressure behind his eyes as he looked at the beautiful sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The burglar had made him a personal library based off of the books he’d already had.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the new books were old leather-bound copies of books connected to some of Remus’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a beat up copy of <em>Jane Eyre</em> for an English class, and the burglar had given him a complete leather-bound set of the Brontë sisters’ work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of his current-events focused books were mixed in with newer books on relevant topics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The few novels he’d brought over from Alex’s sat old with their spines cracked next to brand new copies of the authors’ most recent work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Books from his mother were neatly lined up together and accompanied by several new books with titles like <em>Meditation Techniques for Students </em>and <em>Writing Therapy</em>. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were also a few other books that didn’t seem connected to any of Remus’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe they were favorites of the burglar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He stood there for the better part of an hour reading the descriptions on the backs of all of the books.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had been a very long time since he’d let himself buy any new books, and he hadn’t read for fun in a while.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He pulled one of the more interesting titles off of the shelf and headed towards the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His chest was tight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was quite possibly the nicest thing anyone had ever done for him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus stopped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There, resting on his nightstand was the tissue he’d used for “cleanup” the night before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wouldn’t have seemed so suspect, except this particular piece was resting right beside the plastic shell of the safety seal that had been on the lube bottle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus almost collapsed in despair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was actually going to die of embarrassment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would be the first person who’d ever done so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not just from a single isolated incident, no, from prolonged exposure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This would be his claim to fame.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would be featured in medical textbooks. Some university would pickle his head and put it in a jar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would be titled “The Man Who Just Discovered that the Sexiest Man He’s Ever Met in His Life Has Seen the Tissue He Came in while Giving Him a Large and Thoughtful Selection of Books that May or May Not Have Been Stolen,” and students were going to laugh at it and dare each other to touch it and he was never going to get his homework done and he was going to fail the class because the class was with McGonagall and she would never accept death as an excuse to not complete an assignment… and … and… and…</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus somehow managed to climb his way into bed as the thoughts continued their assault.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It still smelled like the burglar’s cologne, which was really just adding insult to injury, he thought.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He turned off the lights and stared at the ceiling for about twenty-six and a half hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At some point the cardiac arrest was going to kick in, he was sure… but eventually, sleep overtook him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he dreamed of beautiful burglars and antique beds and a world where he wasn’t a complete and utter disaster.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Later, he would thank his barista skills for teaching him how best to get caffeine into his body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been positively jittery all morning from the franken-coffee of espresso shots and Red Bull he’d downed when his shift started.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily was looking at him with genuine concern.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did something happen last night?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>she asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He fiddled with the loose bit of bandage on his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was going to have to change it soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bandages were annoying, but especially annoying when one’s job involved constant contact with steam and washing one’s hands fifty-fuck-illion or so times a day. “Nothing,” he replied, “I’ve just been sort of busy with a project.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Haven’t been sleeping well.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Have you seen the not-boy male person recently?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus’s stomach tightened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wished she wouldn’t ask about the burglar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d been bringing him up constantly since the burn incident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, I haven’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I wish you’d stop referring to him that way.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Well, you haven’t told me his name, so I can’t really refer to him as anything else, can I?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He felt his face grow hot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He decided to blame it on the milk steamer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I… I don’t know his name,” he mumbled.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Come again?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily looked up from the pastries she was stacking in a display.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I don’t know what his name is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I keep forgetting that I don’t know his name… I… I should know his name.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus’s skin was tingling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could feel the bubble of pressure reforming in his head and pressing against his skull as fresh anxiety coursed through his veins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t even know the burglar’s name.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “How do you know him, again?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I… I guess I don’t,” Remus said quietly.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Remus, are you okay?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He didn’t have a chance to reply because the bell on the door rang and the bubble popped.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Evans!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A vaguely familiar voice said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I told you I’d figure out what coffee shop you worked at!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The man with glasses who’d helped the burglar bring the sofa to Remus’s flat strutted into the shop.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily’s back tensed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“James Potter,” she said dramatically to the man with glasses, a strange sort of expression on her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So you’ve found me at last.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The man with glasses grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It took me a month, but I’ve done it!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know what this means?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily was about to reply, but then the man with glasses noticed Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Holy shit,” he said, laughing, “it’s <em>you</em>!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Huh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily looked confused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, have you two met?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Uh…” Remus said, cheeks hot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not exactly.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I never quite caught your name,” James said, leaning against the counter. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I never gave it,” Remus replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s Remus,” he said, holding out his hand, “Remus Lupin.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      James shook it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So you’ve also got one of those bullshit names,” he said, smirking.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily smacked his arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Be nice!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      James waggled his eyebrows at her, which looked strange since the rim of his glasses ran across them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It looked like they were popping in and out of existence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I will if you go out for that coffee date with me.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “James…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “It was the deal, remember?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I figure out which coffee shop you work in, you go out with me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had one of those self-satisfied smirks that Remus had always wanted to punch off the face of every posh git he’d ever gone to school with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And yet, on him it was somehow endearing.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Bets aren’t legally binding if you’re drunk!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily snapped, but she was smiling.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Ah, speaking of getting drunk,” James segued, “we’re going out for drinks tonight, you two should come,” he looked over at Remus, “there’s someone who I’d <em>love </em>for you to meet.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I.. uh… I don’t think…” Remus started mumbling, but Lily grabbed his arm.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Would you excuse us for a second?” she asked James as she pushed Remus towards the break room.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “What—” Remus started.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “<em>Please</em> go out to the pub with us,” Lily pleaded.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I… what?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Please go out with us, I don’t want to go alone, and I think you’d enjoy it.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Something clicked into place in Remus’s head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s <em>the </em>James, isn’t it?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The James you went to school with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The James who you find annoying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The James who's always asking you out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The James who plays football and has a nice bum and who you like but <em>not actually</em> but maybe a little bit… that James?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “What’s that about nice bums?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>came a voice from the counter.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily’s face flushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes,” she whispered urgently, “<em>that</em> James.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t want everyone to think that I’m going just because he asked me, if I bring you…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’m a buffer.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yeah…” Lily said, “and that guy I’m always telling you about will probably be there… the gay one, remember?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus rolled his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“For the millionth time, Lily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all gay men fancy each other.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yeah, but I think you’d like him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could you <em>please</em> just come?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just this one time.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“<em>Fine.</em>”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he was sort of nervous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if the burglar was there?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He knew James.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would it be like to see him outside of the flat?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if it turned out that the man really was just an elaborate hallucination?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if Remus was actually the one going around and stealing stuff?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if this was some weird gay version of <em>Fight Club</em>?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if… what if?</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Remus?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Huh?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You spaced out again,” Lily said, concerned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You okay?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yeah,” Remus said, “I’m okay.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t, but he wasn’t about to explain it to Lily.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Okay,” Lily said, not convinced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She glanced over at the clock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Your shift’s almost over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See you at eight, yeah?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      At 7:56 that evening, Remus’s felt that his stomach was somewhere around his throat as he waited for Lily a block away from the pub.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Is this completely necessary?” he asked as she ran over, wearing a skirt and a completely different shade of lipstick from the one she was wearing earlier that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus glanced down at his usual ensemble of shabby jeans and pilly jumper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was he underdressed?</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You look fine,” Lily said, answering his unasked question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And no, it isn’t but I don't want to see him before I’m… you know… prepared.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She linked her arm with his.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Aren’t you a bit worried about him seeing you come in with another bloke?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Huh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He knows you’re gay.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      That was interesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Does he, now?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Uh, yeah…” Lily said, “you may have come up in a conversation or two he was present for.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus didn’t get a chance to go down <em>that</em> particular line of questioning because they’d arrived at the pub, and suddenly there were much more important things on his mind.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “They’re probably in the back,” Lily said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They have a favorite table.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Right,” Remus said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus and Lily pushed their way through a crowd of patrons and made their way to the table.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      And there he was. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He was surrounded by other people, laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The scene was so perfect and natural that Remus felt a tightening in his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want to disturb them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also didn’t really want the last of the bubbles to pop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Lily was pushing him forward and he knew there was no going back now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried to swallow the lump in his throat but he failed.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Evans!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James shouted from his seat at the burglar’s right, “you came!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you brought your friend!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The burglar looked up at James’ exclamation and froze when he and Remus made eye contact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The color drained from his face.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yeah,” Lily said, putting her hand on Remus’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Everyone, this is Remus Lupin, my coworker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James invited us earlier today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus, this is Alice and Frank Longbottom, Marlene McKinnon, James Potter but you’ve already met him, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius Black, the burglar’s name was Sirius Black… and… wait— </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Peter?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hadn’t noticed the man in the corner.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Remus?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Peter asked, equally confused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I didn’t know you knew Lily.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I didn’t know <em>you </em>knew Lily!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Wait,” James interjected, “you know Lily <em>and</em> Peter and somehow we’ve never met?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How’d you manage that, mate?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I… uh…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Are you okay, Sirius?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frank asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You look pale… well, paler than usual.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Huh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius asked, “uh yeah,” he took a sip of his pint, “fine.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He glanced up at Remus.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus tried to smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t sure he succeeded.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So…” Lily began awkwardly, “do you two know each other?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Not really…” Remus said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’ve been trying to introduce the two of you for months now,” Lily continued.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus finally tore his eyes from Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wait, is this the gay friend you’ve been trying to set me up with?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius made a similar connection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“<em>This</em> is the cute coworker you’re always on my back about?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily made a guilty little shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh… yeah.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The entire table went silent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smugness radiated off of James in waves so thick Remus felt like he was choking on them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But maybe that was just the nerves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was really regretting the amount of caffeine he’d had that morning.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily made some realizations of her own… “wait… is this the non-boy male person you were talking about?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Uh… yeah?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus replied sheepishly.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “<em>Non-boy male person</em>?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius repeated, his voice almost inaudible over James’s laughter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What the hell are you two talking about in that little coffee shop of yours?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily smiled at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So where on earth did you two meet?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Neither Remus nor Sirius supplied her with a ready answer.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Wait,” Peter said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is <em>Remus</em> the man you've been going on about these last few weeks?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “The one with the pretty eyes and nice bum?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marlene chipped in, looking excitedly between a very red Remus and a very, <em>very</em> red Sirius. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “The one with the hair and the sexy West Country accent and all the books?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alice added.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Remus,” Sirius looked as though he was trying very hard to stay in control of his facial expression, “may I speak with you outside for a moment?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus tried to ignore the little thrill that ran through his body from hearing the burglar — Sirius — saying his name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Of course,” he said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius slipped off his barstool and took him gently by the elbow (the tingling elbow) outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a cool, damp sort of night (not that there really was another kind in London).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They ducked into an alleyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cars drove by, their headlights seeming to run in the water on the roads.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’m… sorry you had to hear all of that,” Sirius began awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My friends… they, er, they like to tease me, you know?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus cocked an eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been encouraged by the revelations inside the pub, so the overwhelming anxiety he had been feeling was now lightly seasoned with excitement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So you’re friends were making up all the stuff about the pretty eyes and the nice bum?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “They… uh… you see… er… no.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius leaned against the back of a nearby building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Jesus Christ,” he eventually said, banging his head against the brick wall, “do you mind if I smoke?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Not at all,” Remus replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course Sirius smoked, he thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus had a weird complex about smoking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the one hand, he knew it was super bad for you and disapproved of it on principle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the other hand, it was hot as hell.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius pulled a pack of cigarettes from the inside of his black leather jacket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The flash of his lighter briefly illuminated the beautiful lines of his face, but disappeared quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus watched the red ember at the end of the cigarette move from Sirius’s mouth to his side with a meditative sort of focus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The cloying, sickly scent of burning tobacco gave the situation a weird sort of feel, like everything was more grown up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Remus still felt like a lost school boy, almost queazy with the excitement of learning that his crush might just like him back.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So,” Sirius said after a long pause, “this is not quite how I wanted this to go.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Wanted what to go?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus asked dumbly.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You learning that I fancied you like mad.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Oh,” Remus said weakly, “that.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could barely hear his own voice over the choir of angles singing in his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius liked him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He fucking fancied him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He fucking god damn mother fucking honestly sure as shit fancied him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius took another drag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes were completely shadowed in the dark of the alleyway, but Remus gathered that the man was looking at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So… what now?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “That’s a… good question,” Remus said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s… er… nice to finally know your name.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius chuckled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s nice to know yours as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus Lupin,” he said, drawing the name out and doing unfair things to the other man’s trousers, “I like it, it suits you.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus felt his cheeks heat up, and he was happy for the darkness and the cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thanks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I like yours too… Sirius Black.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>James was right,” he mused, remembering the man’s comment earlier that day, “we do have bullshit names.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I prefer to think of them as unique.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are a million Jameses and Lilys and Peters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We may be the only Remus and Sirius.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus liked how he put that: <em>we</em> and <em>Remus and Sirius. </em> Like they were some sort of unit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re probably right,” he said. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Can we make a deal, Remus?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Uh, maybe?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What do you have in mind?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “We’ve been joking and sarcastic and strange for more than a week now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I know most of that’s been me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But… can we just agree to be really super honest from here on out?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No bullshit, no nothing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I want to get to know you.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus blinked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was terrified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The thought of having a conversation with Sirius that didn’t have a protective coating of bullshit made him want to vomit in the corner behind the bins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But almost in a good way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes,” he said at length, “I’d like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So… can I ask you a question?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Sure.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus took a deep breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did you actually steal that sofa?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius let out a little sound, somewhere between a choke and a laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It almost sounded like a dog barking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, Remus, I didn’t steal any of the things I gave you.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      It was almost painful, really, the feeling of all that pressure in his head being released.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bubbles popped left and right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So many questions were left unanswered, but the biggest one was out of the way and Remus felt like he was treading on safer ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t say anything, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He waited for Sirius to continue.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’ve wanted to tell you about it for a while now,” Sirius said after a brief pause. “but I never knew how to bring it up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t want to acknowledge the strangeness of the situation, you know?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like if I tried to explain anything about what was going on, you would suddenly realize how weird this all was and you’d tell me to leave and never come back, I mean, I was walking into your flat on a daily basis, while you weren’t even there!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      So Sirius was thinking of thing the same way he was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That almost made Remus feel proud, in a weird way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that did bring up one additional question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How did you get into my flat, anyway?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I locked the door every day.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Oh,” Sirius replied, somewhat surprised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I thought you knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have a key.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus blinked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How do you have a key to my flat?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Peter used to live there,” Sirius replied simply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A few months before you moved in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn't know he’d moved <em>out</em> until after that first night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Peter had been getting on my nerves so I nicked his keys one night when he was drunk and staying over at my place and went to what I assumed was still his flat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was going to… I don’t even really know what I was going to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just got it into my head that I was going to go to Peter’s and mess with his stuff or something.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I got really into it too— wore all black like some prick from a spy movie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, I got there and I was taken aback by how little stuff Peter had.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I heard someone behind me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can imagine my surprise when I turned around and instead of seeing… well, <em>Peter</em>, there’s… there’s <em>you</em>.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus didn’t know what he was supposed to be more surprised by: the story itself or the fact that Sirius said “you” in the reverent voice people usually saved to say “Freddy Mercury,” “David Beckham,” or “Beyoncé.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Okay,” Remus said, trying his best to take it in stride after a lifetime of being completely shit at taking things in stride, “so where did all of the stuff come from?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Well, that’s a long story, can we walk?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This alley sort of smells like piss.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius’s dropped his cigarette and smushed it under his boot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without the smoke overpowering Remus’s nose, he realized that the alley did, in fact, sort of smell like piss.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Uh, yeah,” Remus said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Of course.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius shrugged off of the wall and started to stroll along the street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was illuminated once more by the street lamps.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So…” he began, looking up at the murky clouds above, glowing slightly from the city’s light pollution, “a few months ago, my uncle died.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Oh,” Remus said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was unexpected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Don’t be,” Sirius replied, a rueful smile tugging at his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I barely knew the man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he was pretty much the only family member I could stand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My… my family is sort of horrible.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t think it would be a good idea for him to say anything.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My uncle died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, well, Uncle Alfie had never really gotten along with any other members of my shit family, so he left everything he had to me: a reasonably large amount of money, some stocks, and a completely furnished old house in a disgustingly posh part of London,” he lit another cigarette as they walked, smiling a little apologetically at Remus, “I smoke when I’m nervous,” he explained.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus didn’t know how to reply to that either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t usually make people nervous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe he did, but was just too nervous to notice.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So anyway,” Sirius started again after taking a deep drag, “I was landed with this huge house full of stuff and nothing to do with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t want to move in, but I also didn’t want to sell the whole estate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a rebellious part of me that wanted to dissolve the collection, break up the Black estate, you know?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My parents disinherited me, so I won’t get to do it with their things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just wanted to tear it apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s been cathartic, in a way.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus walked beside him in silence, absorbed in the story.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d never imagined this when he thought of the burglar’s background.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was both more and less dramatic than he’d imagined.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wondered why Sirius had been disinherited, but decided that was far to personal a question to ask of a man whose name he hadn’t known an hour ago.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “And then I met you and saw how little you had.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It just clicked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You needed furniture you didn't have, I had furniture I didn’t need.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I got James to help me bring you a sofa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it felt good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I decided that I wanted to bring you other things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt nice to have something to do.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus quirked his eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Something to do?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yeah,” Sirius replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I had this really shitty job that I hated and when Uncle Alfie died and I became… well not rich quite, but… I just quit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Haven’t been employed since.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bringing you furniture and buying you things and maybe seeing you sometimes was really fun and kept me going.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt like I was actually useful for the first time in a while, not just some lazy ex-aristocrat who gets to be useless because a man he’d met maybe five times died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was helping you and it was fun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And… and you know, you had those pretty eyes and that nice bum and that West Country accent and I just liked seeing you and joking with you and…” Sirius cleared his throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So… yeah… I like you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I wasn’t sure if you liked me, so I kind of started doing things… like spraying my cologne on your pillows.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I knew it!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus shouted before he could stop himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The couple walking just in front of him looked back, startled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus apologized, then turned back to Sirius and continued in a quieter voice: “I knew it was weird for those sheets to smell like you for so long!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Uh… yeah…”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius stared at the ground as they walked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus was so high on the utter strangeness and wonderfulness of his present situation that he didn’t think twice before bluntly reassuring Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t be embarrassed, do you have any idea how many times I wanked to that smell?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius stopped walking abruptly, and the couple in front of them seemed to speed up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Really?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus blushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The high was gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh… yeah… I mean not <em>every night</em> just most nights… and oh shit I can’t believe that I said that.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This has got to be the messiest way I’ve ever asked a bloke out in my life,” he said, chuckling.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You honestly want to go out with me?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The guy who wanked on a sofa he honestly thought may have come from Buckingham Palace?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Did you really?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And you thought of… me?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus bit his lip and nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can you blame me?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have you seen you?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yes,” Sirius replied, “I have seen me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve also seen you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And let’s just say that you’ve cost me half a box of Kleenex.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      That little piece of information went directly to Remus’s crotch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well… that’s… good to know.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius smirked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, since we’ve established our mastabratory habits, would you like to come back to my place?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-/-</span>
</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius’s flat was astoundingly cosy looking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was messy and somewhat cluttered, but there was an air of comfort and hominess that seemed to radiate from the very walls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were blankets strewn across the sofa, books and movies stacked everywhere, and even a guitar in the corner. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Not that Remus really noticed at first, because the moment the door was closed, they were kissing.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Or rather, they were trying to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The angle was slightly off and the movement was so sudden and jerky that their noses bumped rather painfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two men chuckled awkwardly then moved together in a slightly more coordinated effort.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      And then Remus was kissing the burglar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was kissing Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius who’s lips were so soft except for the small line of chapped skin where he tended to gnaw at his mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius who tasted like beer and smoke and something else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius who wrapped his arms around Remus’s waist and brought their bodies closer together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius who’s body was hard and strong and so, so perfect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who was a bit shorter than Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who’s hair was as soft as it looked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who ran his tongue along Remus’s lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who Remus gladly let in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who knew how to kiss.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Who really, really knew how to kiss.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius broke the kiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Bedroom?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Bedroom.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus replied.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      It was the most productive conversation they had ever had.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius led them into a small bedroom which was dominated by a large unmade bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two men tumbled down onto it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius was above Remus, and he supported himself on his arms as he kissed down Remus’s neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was undoing the top button of Remus’s shirt when Remus remembered something important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something he had to tell him…</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Wait,” Remus gasped.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius looked up at him, his silver eyes full of some strange mixture of lust and confusion, and maybe hurt?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry,” he said hoarsely, “am I going too fast?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Uh… no… it’s just… when I was a kid, I was in an accident.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are scars.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A lot of them… don’t want you to be surprised.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don’t want you to be disgusted, he added mentally.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you for telling me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>May I take your shirt off?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus was fairly sure he’d never been asked that question before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Also,” he said, remembering the other important thing, “I’m clean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I got tested last month and I… I haven’t since then.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius was working on his buttons, but he looked up at Remus when he replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m clean too.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then he had the buttons of Remus’s shirt undone and pushed the fabric off his shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus studied Sirius’s face as the other man took in the scarring on Remus’s torso.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d almost died in the accident, and the scars that remained were extensive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They curled and dashed and dipped in every direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They ran down his arms, across his chest, and all over his stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some lovers had called them fascinating, others had said they were beautiful, and others still had found them disturbing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He never quite knew what to expect.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He tried to read Sirius’s expression, but he found he couldn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“May I touch them?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius finally asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Uh, yeah… go ahead.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius traced a finger along the various different scars, his touch leaving a strange tingling sensation on Remus’s skin as it went.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It must have been a hell of an accident.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “It was,” Remus replied.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “The healing process must have been difficult.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “It was,” Remus agreed.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius kissed his chest, his stomach, his lower abdomen, down, down, down, until his lips were right above Remus’s trousers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He glanced up at Remus, his silver eyes asking a silent question.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus’s nodded, his lip caught between his teeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius undid Remus’s jeans and pulled them down his legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pressed his lips to the bulge in the front of Remus’s briefs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a moment he stayed there, nuzzling into the cloth covered cock, but eventually he pulled the waistband of the pants down and sent them flying somewhere into the room behind him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius sat back and raked his eyes over Remus’s body, his gaze eventually coming to rest on Remus’s cock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Gorgeous,” he whispered.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus felt his cheeks grow hot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t like direct scrutiny, even if the person liked what they saw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sat up and grabbed Sirius by his shirt, pulling their lips together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By all accounts, it shouldn’t have worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus was not a coordinated man and to pull a lover up towards one’s own face with that much precision required a certain amount of skill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fortunately, however, Remus seemed to manage it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius gave in to the kiss happily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nipped at Remus’s lips and opened his mouth with a gasp when Remus started palming his cock through his jeans.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus tried his luck in yet another maneuver: he tried to reverse their positions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was not so lucky that time around and the two ended up stumbling on the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus recovered quickly, however, and immediately started removing Sirius’s clothes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulled the man’s grey t-shirt over his head and kissed down the firm, toned chest and stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He eased his skinny jeans off and let out a little gasp of surprise when he was greeted immediately by a hard, thick cock.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You go commando?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus asked hoarsely.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Not all the time,” Sirius replied, somewhat breathless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Only when I’m wearing — ah!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus had run his tongue across the head of Sirius’s cock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He let out a little sigh at the pleasure of the weight of Sirius on his tongue and started licking at the head, which was already starting to release a small trail of salty pre-cum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius’s fingers went to his hair as Remus bobbed his head up and down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After a few tries, he managed to take Sirius’s entire length.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius let out a long, low moan as Remus swallowed around him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“<em>Fuck…</em>”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus sped up his ministrations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius’s hips thrust upwards instinctually, and Remus gagged on his length.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He immediately released Sirius with a <em>pop</em> and took in a few breaths.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “<em>Aaah</em> — sorry.” Sirius said, his cheeks flushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That doesn’t… I’m usually a bit more…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just took me by surprise is all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can fuck my face if you want.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius’s eyes darkened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He crashed their lips back together and flipped them with much more grace than Remus had managed. Sirius straddled Remus, their cocks rubbing together agonizingly with every move they made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius started kissing down Remus’s jaw and neck. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Much as I’d love to do that,” <em>kiss</em>, “I would much rather,” <em>kiss</em>, “come with that glorious cock in my arse,” <em>kiss.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The words were like sparks running across Remus’s skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think we can arrange that,” he said in a weak voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you have…?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius reached over into a bedside table, giving Remus a lovely view of his lovely backside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He fumbled around for a bit before tossing a bottle of lube and a condom at Remus.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Do you want me to prepare myself or do you want to do it?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus imagined what Sirius would look like readying himself for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A fresh shot of arousal went straight to his groin, but he knew now wasn’t the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll do it,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he’d let Sirius do it next time… if there was a next time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hoped to hell there would be hundreds of thousands of next times.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius smiled, and laid back on the bed, spreading his legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus was fairly sure the image of Sirius splayed out like that would be permanently burned into his retinas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every time he closed his eyes from then on, he would see Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And while he did appreciate the glorious image that it was, he figured there would be considerable downsides to going through life with a permanent erection.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius smirked that smirk unique to incredibly attractive people who know exactly how attractive they are.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you just going to sit there gawking, or are you going to fuck me?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      There are very few phrases that inspire immediate action whenever they are uttered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In that moment, Remus could only think of three: “fire”; “oh look, a rainbow”; and “fuck me.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus applied some lube to his fingers and pressed one into Sirius, who let his head fall back at the initial penetration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus sighed at the tightness around his finger and started moving it gently in and out of a very squirmy Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Definitely not the lay there and take it type, it appeared.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Another one,” Sirius rasped as he pushed himself down on Remus’s finger.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus complied immediately, and started curling his fingers as he looked for the…</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “<em>Agh!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></em>Fuck…”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius’s hips thrust up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Right <em>the fuck </em>there.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus figured it was about time for finger number three.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given the euphoric groan he received in response, Sirius was in agreement.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus started fucking Sirius with his fingers in earnest, sure to hit his prostate as often as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After a moment or two of fingering, Sirius had had enough.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “In me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus was not about to deny him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius pushed Remus down onto the mattress and pulled the condom from somewhere among the sheets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He rolled it down Remus’s shaft with certain fingers and straddled his hips.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus watched as Sirius sank down on his length, his eyes fluttering shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He bit his lip as he adjusted to Remus’s length.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus, who was trying to focus on anything other than the tight heat around him and how it made him feel like he was going to come in about three and a half seconds, ran his fingers along Sirius’s thighs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus wasn’t small, the half-pained expression on his face wasn’t new to him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’m sorry,” he blurted before he could stop himself.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius’s eyes opened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He chuckled, though it sounded a bit breathy and forced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did you just apologize for having a huge cock?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus slid his hands further back, clutching Sirius’s adorable, round arse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You know what I mean.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Instead of answering, Sirius started rolling his hips up and down and Remus about lost his mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took him a a few moments of bone-melting bliss before he realized he was doing absolutely nothing.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He reached down and wrapped a hand around Sirius’s stupidly pretty cock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He ran his thumb across the swollen red tip and Sirius let out a little mewing groan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His hips stuttered slightly as Remus started to stroke him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius changed his pace slightly and started grinding down on Remus’s cock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fuck,” he breathed as he found an angle he liked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He started circling his hips and Remus felt hot jolts of pleasure run across his body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He started jerking Sirius at a faster rate, and things started feeling like a race.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he should have tried to be more impressive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he should have started imagining dead kittens and maths lectures and Peter in drag, but more than a week of sexual frustration was coming to a head and Remus knew this was not going to be his best performance.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He grabbed Sirius’s hips and readjusted himself under him, setting his feet on the mattress and thrusting up into the tight heat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius let out an appreciative gasp and nearly fell on top of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He propped himself up on his arms inches from Remus’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It made the encounter all the more intimate— Remus driving up into Sirius as the two made eye contact, shared air, the space between them hot and damp and heavy with their gasps and moans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius’s cock was trapped between them.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius pressed a kiss to the side of Remus’s neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He started matching Remus’s pace.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Their hips met over and over, desperate and almost wild.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus started to loose his rhythm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His movements became erratic and he chased his release.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius came first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His cock erupted between them, warm and hot between their two bodies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus was barely even seconds behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The clenching around him was too much, and he held Sirius’s hips in a vice-like grip as he howled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius collapsed on top of them.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The two men laid together in a tangle of limbs, their breath heavy and their hearts racing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually Sirius eased Remus out of himself and got up to grab a towel from the bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They cleaned themselves in silence, then Sirius tossed the towel somewhere on the floor and nuzzled into the crook of Remus’s neck.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      In the quiet that followed, Remus realized there was something he had yet to say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you,” he whispered, his lips against Sirius’s neck.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “For what?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Everything.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’m so glad I broke into your flat,” Sirius laughed.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus couldn’t help the smile that broke out on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Me too.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">-/-</span>
</p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus woke to a surprisingly bright morning and an empty bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sheets were tangled tightly around his legs and the blankets had fallen to the floor over the course of the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He rubbed his eyes and rolled over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bed’s scent was an interesting and debauched blend of Sirius’s cologne, sweat, and sex.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He rather liked it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He untangled himself from the sheets and searched the floor for his clothes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything was rumpled and messy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t looking forward to the walk of shame he was going to have to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least he didn’t have to go to work that morning, he thought.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus walked out into the main room, smiling slightly when he heard the sound of a shower through the bathroom door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then he heard a shuffling behind him and turned to see what it was.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Lily?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      His manager was scrambling out of another door he hadn’t noticed the night before (not that he had been in a position to notice much).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was tugging at the outfit she’d worn to the pub.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Remus,” she’d said, trying to sound casual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good morning… I’m, er, I’m gonna be late for work… so…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      James came to lean against the doorframe Lily had just emerged from.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Morning Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you have to go to work as well?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Overnight James appeared to have evolved like a Pokemon and attained a whole new level of smugness.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Er, no,” Remus replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You may want to get going,” he said to Lily.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily jumped and nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She went over to give James a kiss goodbye when the bathroom door opened up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sent warm, steamy air and the sharp, deeply masculine scent of Sirius’s body wash wafting throughout the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus felt a stirring in his pants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was possible he was starting to be conditioned to get hard at the scent of Sirius Black.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That could be a problem, he thought.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “James, you little whore,” Sirius said fondly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a towel wrapped loosely around his waist as he leaned against the doorframe.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Could say the same for you,” James replied, gesturing at a red faced Remus.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily made a quick retreat with a simple, “bye,” and Sirius didn’t break eye contact with James.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “You, good sir, have some explaining to do,” Sirius said finally, “why didn’t you tell me he was going to be coming to the pub last night?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      James shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Because you not knowing was funnier.” </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius opened his mouth as if to reply, but shut it after a moment and shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fair enough.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius turned his attention over to Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Morning,” he said softly, standing on his tippy-toes so he could peck the slightly taller man on the lips, “did you sleep well?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      James walked away with a muttered, “I’ll make coffee.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yeah,” Remus replied with a smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No thanks to you, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did you know you’re a cover hog?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      James snorted from the kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius ripped off his towel off and threw it at James’s head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other man made a little shrieking noise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ahhh!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dick germs!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>Gedditoff</em>!!!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius turned to Remus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Breakfast?”</span>

  <span class="s1">-/-</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Breakfast” turned out to be doughnuts at a local bakery with cups of cheap coffee and hundreds of tiny, insignificant questions back and forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What’s your favorite color?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What music do you listen to?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where are you from?</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Slowly, naturally, they got to know each other.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Monday over a curry by Remus’s campus he told Sirius about how his parents never had much money and always emphasized how important education was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How he worked hard every year at school, how he’d been so obsessed with his A levels that one day he just broke down and cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How he approached his schooling with an almost warrior spirit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How he wanted to be a teacher.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Wednesday while shopping for groceries, Sirius made mumbled, awkward mentions of a childhood of nannies and tutors and cold, unaffectionate parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of how embarrassingly rich he had been.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of how his father always smelled like brandy.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Friday while washing dishes Remus told Sirius about coming out in a small town.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About everyone going quiet whenever he entered a room because of course the son of the eccentric academic researching some obscure bird unique to the region and some woo-woo Welsh lady turned out to be the town queer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About secret boyfriends and bullies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About cowards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About the boy who kissed him one night in the back of a car only to punch him in the back of the school the next day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About how “I’m moving to London when I graduate” started to sound less like a plan and more like a prayer.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Saturday over candles and expensive steak Sirius told Remus about secret, shameful thoughts in the dormitories of prep schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About stolen kisses in dark corridors and fumbled hand jobs under school uniforms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About fear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About slaps across the face and screaming and silent dinners.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Saturday over bar pretzels and pints, Remus learned about James and Sirius and Peter’s silly nicknames for each other: Prongs, Padfoot, and Wormtail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About a Christmas pageant in which they each portrayed a different animal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About the delicious irony of a boy named after the Dog Star pulling the “dog” slip of paper out of an old hat.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Friday over birthday cake Remus gave Sirius a collar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That evening, over the coffee table, the phrase “good boy” was simultaneously ruined and enshrined. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Saturday Remus came home to a leash draped across the back of the sofa.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Wednesday over pizza Sirius asked Remus if they were boyfriends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His lips tasted like pepperoni.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t until later, when they were lying naked on the bed and waiting for their hearts to slow down that Remus even remembered to say, “yes.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Tuesday night over wet pillows Remus whispered about boyfriends and being kicked out of his flat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About Alex.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About religious parents and threats about heirs and wills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About taking back months of kissing and fucking and <em>I love you</em>s because <em>Alex couldn’t possibly be gay</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About camping on Lily’s sofa and feeling about five inches tall.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On that same night over those same pillows Sirius told him of the same threats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of being written out the most Noble and Ancient of wills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of being burned off a family tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of leaving home at sixteen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of James Potter and real family and hope.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Saturday they got in their first fight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They yelled at each other until they couldn’t remember what they were yelling about anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They spent a sleepless in separate beds, ruminating over their guilt and fear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both realized that they’d never been with someone they’d wanted to be so gentle with before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By noon the next day all was forgiven.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     On a Friday at a laundromat Sirius mentioned a gay bar he’d been wanting to check out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later that night while covered in glitter and a spilled drink, Sirius revealed that he was never very good at dancing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus laughed with him, not at him, and revealed that the only time he was anything like graceful was after two or three fruity drinks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus felt a strange satisfaction he’d never really felt before when he walked away from a crowd of appreciative glances with his hand in the back pocket of one Sirius Black.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He squeezed his arse as they left, for good measure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>Let them be jealous, </em>he thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>I know I would be.</em></span>

  <span class="s1">      On a Wednesday Remus asked Sirius to come to his family Christmas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On another Wednesday Sirius met Mr. and Mrs. Lupin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On a Thursday they were kicked out of a local pub when Sirius punched the man who had been Remus’s first kiss in the face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By Saturday his parents were joking about it.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Friday Remus accidentally said “I love you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Moments later, Sirius said it back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On purpose. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Tuesday Sirius declared he was going to quit smoking the following year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On that Wednesday Remus promised to cut down on the chocolate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A bit, at least.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      As a Sunday turned into a Monday, surrounded by friends new and old-ish, Remus spent the very first moments of a new year doing his favorite thing: kissing Sirius Black.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      At 3 AM on a Sunday Remus held Sirius while he told him about a brother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One that had only been a series of fragments during that first breakfast (“One sibling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A younger brother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Regulus.”).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of falling outs and shouting and tears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of losing touch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of worry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of a single text (“I’m sorry”), a bathtub, and a razor.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Tuesday Remus looked at a display of red and pink heart shaped boxes and chewed his lip nervously.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Wednesday Remus came home to a trail of rose petals ending with a very naked Sirius Black on the fairy princes bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Happy Valentines Day.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On Thursday Remus was still finding rose petals in… places.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Tuesday Sirius handed Remus a glass of water and told him to just breathe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The exams will be over soon.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Monday over a broken plate and a business paper about Orion Black’s latest merger, Remus put his hands on the shoulders of a shaking Sirius Black and told him that maybe he didn’t have to stay angry forever.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Friday the sale of Sirius’s uncle’s house was finalized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus watched Sirius take the deepest breath he had since he’d quit cigarettes, then they smirked as the new owners ran their hand along a wall Sirius had fucked Remus against the night before (“to see the old place off,” Sirius had explained, already deep inside of his boyfriend and past the point of having to explain anything).</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Saturday Remus discovered that Sirius couldn’t actually play guitar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He just told everyone he could and they believed him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Monday night over a half empty bottle of whiskey and a half finished pack of cigarettes, Remus learned the exact date on which Regulus Black died.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Friday over Chinese Remus celebrated the end of a school year, and Sirius revealed that the last educational decision he’d ever made was to not go to Cambridge.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Monday Remus smiled a big smile when he found a small stack of applications on Sirius’s desk.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Thursday Remus came home to a nervous Sirius holding an acceptance letter.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      On a Friday, Remus glanced at a calendar and noticed something.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-/-</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “Any suggestions?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So to get this right, this isn’t the one year anniversary of you… dating, or something.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the one year anniversary of him breaking into your flat?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Yes,” Remus confirmed as he poured the latte into the cup, running the last of the foam along the center and forming a only slightly wonky flower.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I want to do something romantic.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Nothing says romance like a little B and E,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily muttered.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Shortly after Remus and Sirius started dating, Remus was forced to tell Lily the exact nature of their meeting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the year-minus-ten-days that had passed since then, Lily had yet to let Remus live down the fact that he’d allowed a criminal (or at least, someone he thought was a criminal) to waltz into and out of his house for a week and a half.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Remind me not to get stabbed in front of you,” she’d said.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’d like to think it makes our story unique,” Remus said with a little shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily rolled her eyes and Remus chuckled.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The fact that Remus, Sirius, Lily, and James all coupled up around the same time added an interesting element to their group dynamic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now that the one year mark was coming up, things were getting almost… competitive.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus eyed the diamond ring on Lily’s finger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she’d shown up to movie night with it a few days before, Remus had honestly been thrilled for her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that night as he and Sirius slept, he couldn’t help but wonder if it was time for them to make a similar commitment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What sort of timescale were they supposed to be operating on?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And how did it work with two blokes?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who was supposed to ask?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was he supposed to buy a ring?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What kind of engagement ring do you get a man?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was gay, he was supposed to have considered these things before….</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Remus!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’re doing it again.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Sorry.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus wiped the counter down with a rag. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So did you have anything in mind?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do, I mean.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “I don’t know,” Remus said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I was thinking maybe dinner or something, but I’m not sure. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It isn’t a normal anniversary, as you like to keep reminding me.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Maybe… maybe you could cook for him, you know, in your flat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where it all began.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Mmmm.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus hadn’t actually been to his flat in a few days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lavishly furnished as it was, it didn’t have the homey feel Sirius and James’s place did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, Remus was fairly sure more than half of his wardrobe was currently located in the drawer Sirius had cleared out for him in his bedroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He really ought to check back in at some point, if only to clear out whatever food was likely decomposing in the fridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe an evening back in the old place wasn’t such a bad idea.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Lily handed him a cup with some letters sharpied onto the side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And flowers are always a good idea.”</span>

</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     As Remus walked back to his flat, he sent Sirius a quick text.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>Dinner at my place?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll cook.</b></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      A moment later he got his reply: <b>Sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just got out of class so I’ll be there in a bit.</b></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus smiled, and a bright flash of color to the side caught his eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone was selling bouquets out of a little stand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus remembered Lily’s comment, and decided to buy a particularly colorful arrangement.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “You do something naughty?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the flower seller, a gruff looking middle aged woman, asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Er, no,” Remus replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s our anniversary.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Ah,” she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, she’ll love them.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      <em>Smile and nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smile and nod.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He’d almost forgotten how shitty the neighborhood was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>God, it must have been something like a week since he’d been there last.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d gotten into the habit of avoiding it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe it was time for him to move away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t have much money but maybe if he got a roommate… he and Sirius had been bandying the idea of moving in together about ever since Lily and James got engaged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe they could look at flats at some point.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He practically lived with him as it was.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus scaled the squeaky old stairs to his floor and knew immediately that something was wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The door was open.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Had Sirius gotten there before him?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He supposed it was possible, but a tight knot of dread formed in his stomach as he pulled his door the rest of the way open.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus dropped the bouquet.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Moments later, he heard footsteps behind him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Hey babe I don’t think it’s a good idea to leave your door open like that, and — Oh, shit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think you were robbed.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus looked over at his boyfriend in panic, then back at his empty flat. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “We need to call the police,” Sirius said, pulling his phone out of his pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a squishing sound as he stepped on something.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Aww,” Sirius cooed, “you bought me flowers?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-/-</span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">     “So do you think there’s any chance you’ll get your stuff back?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lily asked as she handed Remus his tea.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Probably not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I haven’t been there for a while and none of the neighbors said they noticed anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d never really talked to them before so I don’t know… maybe it was one of them…”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He still felt very jittery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He and Sirius had spent the afternoon talking to a few police officers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The officers themselves seemed rather unconvinced that someone living in a neighborhood like Remus’s would own so much expensive stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the real shock of the evening had come when Sirius helped him list off all of the things that had been stolen.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus had been too out of it to contribute much, so Sirius had made most of the report, “A large collection of antique furniture… a sofa, a bed and nightstand, a dining room set, a coffee table, a wardrobe, a bookshelf, a flatscreen TV and a Playstation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Several 19th century landscape oil paintings… oh,” he glanced at Remus before his eyes darted awkwardly away, “and a diamond ring.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus still hadn’t really gotten a chance to talk to Sirius about that, since somehow James and Lily had become aware of the situation before the police even left and were whisking their two friends across the city in a veritable whirlwind of protection and comfort.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus hadn’t spent more than ten minutes without a cup of tea in his hand since the whole debacle had started.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius was sitting beside him and rubbing his hand along his boyfriend’s back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus sort of collapsed into his side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius wrapped his arm around him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I’m sorry about your things,” Remus said for probably the hundredth time.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He could feel Sirius shrug around him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The paintings were insured anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m just glad you’re alright.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He glanced up at their friends, who were hovering over them, ready to strike with blankets or more tea at a moment’s notice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the coffee table between the two couples was a slightly trampled bouquet of flowers lovingly arranged in a vase.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “Let’s go to bed,” Sirius murmured into Remus’s hair.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      The two retreated into Sirius’s room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus took a sip of his tea and was thankful yet again that virtually all of his more personal possessions — his clothes and books and laptop — had been living in his boyfriend’s flat for quite some time.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “So,” Remus began.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The ring… I don’t remember having a ring.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius chuckled as he kicked his shoes off and fell backwards onto the mattress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I was wondering when you were going to bring that up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He splayed himself across the bed like a centerfold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Today’s our anniversary, you know… well…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “The anniversary of you breaking into my flat,” Remus replied with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why do you think I suggested dinner at my place?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I was actually going to suggest the same thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d stashed a ring in there a few weeks ago, because…” he trailed off.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus felt tingles running all over his skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Because?” he prompted.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Sirius looked at him for a moment, then said, “because I was going to ask you to marry me.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      He knew he was going to say that, but the words still sent a thrill through Remus’s body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Were you?” he asked with a small smirk.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      “I was,” Sirius replied, “and I am.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">      Remus let a silence fall between them and savored the moment, like The Books said he should.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tension.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The love.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their own little bubble, just the two of them and the unanswered question.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">     Remus downed the last of his tea and set the mug down, then joined Sirius on the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took a final breath, smiled, and let the bubble pop.</span>
