<p></p><div>
  <p>Black boots crunched over the foliage that had fallen throughout the warm summer. His coat went down to mid calf and was black like the rest of his outfit, but Draco Malfoy didn't put off the intimidating air that his father had.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Now that the war was over, many were lost. Children who were too young to fight now grew in to unstable adults, and many moved home because of the trauma they'd experienced. The state of the magical world was in healing, and for one wayward Slytherin who had lost his sense of direction like his fellow classmates, he was finally on a mission.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Rumor had it that Harry Potter had retreated in to these very woods, and if there was one person who was going to find him, it was going to be Draco. But if there was one thing Draco knew, it was that Harry was incredibly powerful. So finding him wouldn't only be a matter of how far he could walk in a day, but how well he could combat any spells Harry had laid out to keep his location hidden.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>As such, Draco had spent much of the day walking in what felt like a giant circle. Nearing a tree he'd left a marking on earlier, he sighed in frustration.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Harry Potter!" He shouted as he put a hand on his hip, brushing back the black coat he wore to expose his wand tucked safely in to a wand strap.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I know that you know I'm here," he said, and then he muttered to himself. "Probably used <em>muffliato</em>, I hate that spell."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>At that, and with no response, Draco took out his wand, and took a few moments to feel the 18" elm in his hands. It was familiar now, though he didn't hold it tightly as he stared at the forest. "Harry Potter, I know you're there. I'm not here to hurt you."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The wind rustled a few leaves, which drew Draco's gaze. But then it seemed he was still alone, and now he found himself spinning in circles. It had to be the <em>protego totalum</em>, and this spell was a specifically strong one.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"If you don't believe me, you can take my wand. I won't fight you," Draco said as he offered his wand in a random direction. To answer him, a few seconds later his wand flew out of his hand, and disappeared somewhere off to the right.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco turned, but then he found himself facing the exact opposite direction than he'd been in. He felt a bit annoyed, though understood why Harry would put up such a strong spell around his home.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Okay, you've got it now. I just came to talk." Still, there was silence. The sun trickled through the leaves of great oak tree overhead, and created a calming wash of light without the burn from the sun.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Just when Draco thought he might have lost his wand for good, and that this had been a fruitless venture, a hand reached out from behind him, and tugged him back.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco stumbled backwards a few steps, boots nearly tripping over a fallen branch of a tree, before he turned, and saw The Boy Who Lived. Despite the fact that he was backing away from Draco, he looked like the same Harry that Draco had known only a few years prior.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco lit up, because he'd almost forgotten how much he'd liked that face. And despite the fact that a wand was pointed at him by his arch enemy, Draco was relieved to see Harry, though his hair was long now, and tied up in a tight bun. He wore the typical jeans he'd only seen Harry in a few time before, as well as a sweater that looked a big ragged, though had a distinct "H" on the front. Draco wondered if that stood for Harry, or Hogwarts.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Off to the side, Draco also saw the path he must have passed and not seen because of the protection spells Harry had cast around his home. At the end of the path was a square shack with a crooked roof, and smoke rising from the chimney.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco couldn't help it as he smiled because he was so glad that he'd found Harry. But Harry looked angry, feet planted hard in a defensive stance. "What are you doing here, Malfoy?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Consider this a wellness check, Potter. Shacklebolt sent me, now can I have my wand back?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I don't believe you. Why would Shaklebolt send <em>you</em>?" he asked, and his knuckles slowly turned white from how tightly he held the 11" holly that was, by now, legendary.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I can't say," Draco said in all honesty, and shrugged. He let his hands remain at his sides as he tried not to seem like a threat. "Maybe because I was the only one who didn't have anything going on?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You're a liar, Malfoy," Harry responded, but didn't cast a spell in Malfoy's direction.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes, but I'm not lying about this. Now please, may I have my wand?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Several seconds of tension passed while Harry was unyielding in his stance. Draco used this moment to take in his entire visage, from his plaid button up to the slightly dirty jeans he wore that made it look like he'd been kneeling in the dirt. He looked better than before, more appealing with a bit of stubble on his top lip and those brilliant green eyes that shone like emeralds.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Then, Harry made a move and tossed Draco's wand to him. Draco walked over, and picked it up from where it landed in some leaves. "Thank you."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"A wellness check? What does the Minister think, that I went and off'ed myself?" Harry asked, as he slowly lowered his wand.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It's a probability. Plenty of us have done that," Draco said it as casually as if reciting a children's poem. But at this, Harry stepped back, like he was genuinely surprised by the statement.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Really?" Harry asked, befuddled.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yeah, its a sad state of affairs right now in the wizarding world. Aren't you going to offer me a cup of tea?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry huffed angrily, those green eyes peering out and untrusting behind thick rimmed glasses. But then Harry stuck his wand in to the little wand strap on his pants, and eased up on his anger. "Fine."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Brilliant," Draco said, and he followed Harry up the path to his home.</p>
</div>
