    <p>Kaname and Yuuki Kuran were standing in front of Zero Kiryu who was at their front door, he had come to speak to Yuuki.</p><p>"What are you doing here, Zero?" Yuuki said, looking confused.</p><p>Kaname had a frown on his face, Zero had a look of determination on his face. Kaname didn't know why the former level E vampire was here but he knew it could be nothing good, Zero had never visited Yuuki before at Kaname's and Yuuki's home.</p><p>"I came to take you back, I love you Yuuki" said Zero, his violet eyes staring straight into Yuuki's large dark hazel eyes.</p><p>Yuuki blinked in surprise her eyes widening, Kaname's eyes had narrowed with anger and there was a small amount of fear in them.</p><p>"Leave Kiryu! Yuuki is with me! " said Kaname in anger, pulling Yuuki closer to his side.</p><p>"She's only with you because I made it that way, Kuran! I was unfair to her, I didn't give her a choice!" said Zero, glaring at Kaname.</p><p>"Zero..." Yuuki said, staring at Zero her eyes slowly filling with happy tears.</p><p>Zero smiled at her, his gaze tender "I want you to choose Yuuki, between him and me. I want you to decide right now who you want to be with. " he said going towards her and caressing her face, wiping away her tears.</p><p>Kaname let a snarl to escape his throat, "Don't touch her Kiryu! How dare you force her to decide when you didn't give her a choice the first time!"</p><p>"Shut up Kuran! You have no say in this! It's up to her!" said Zero angrily.</p><p>Then Zero smiled at Yuuki again, "Yuuki, if you choose me I will help you with your vampire side and protect you from the vampire hunters, I promise. I can't stand been enemies with you anymore, Please leave Kaname Kuran and be with me" said Zero .</p><p>Yuuki had tears going down her face, a smile slowly appearing on her face and she was touching one of her hands over Zero's.</p><p>Yuuki with a hand took Zero's hand in hers and pulled herself away from her older brother's side and stood in front of him.</p><p>A sad smile appeared on her face as she stared at Kaname, whose eyes was filling with incredible sadness and disbelief at what was happening ...at what Zero Kiryu, Kaname's rival was causing to happen. Kaname didn't want to lose Yuuki, he didn't want his beloved girl to leave him, he loved her.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Onii – Sama, please forgive me. But you know that I love Zero more than you, so I am going to choose Zero, I'm sorry." said Yuuki with tears of mixed sadness and happiness running down her face.</p><p>"Yuuki, don't cry if you decide it then I will respect your decision. Just as long it is your choice" said Kaname, with a loving expression of sadness on his face.</p><p>Yuuki nodded sadly, and then gave Kaname a soft kiss on both of his cheeks before packing her belongings and leaving the house with Zero.</p><p>For a long while after that Kaname just stood there, he didn't know how long ...it could've been hours that he stood there but he didn't care enough to move at the moment .</p><p>'This is Kiryu's fault' he thought as he struggled to control his emotions.</p><p>Yes... what had happened was all of Zero's fault, he couldn't and wouldn't blame Yuuki for this.</p><p>"Yuuki ..."He said sadly in the middle of the silence.</p><p>He still loved her.</p><p>Inside he was feeling a mixture of feelings, anger and sadness being the two most prominent that he felt. His heart was breaking and shattering as he stood there, the sorrow he felt was almost agonizing as he thought that he would now have to live without his precious girl.</p><p>Eventually he moved from where he stood, he decided to go for a walk even though it was snowing outside. Kaname walked through the wintry night not really seeing where he was going, he didn't know where he was going, he just wanted to get out of the house for a while. Get away from the overwhelming toxicating scent of his Yuuki, who soon would from now on no longer be his but Zero's. It would probably be for the best for her, she loved Zero after all, and Kaname knew that but having that knowledge couldn't take away the pain that was consuming his heart.</p><p>His precious girl had chosen Kiryu over him, his well thought out plans had failed him. Even though he had protected her from everything that had ever dared to threaten her existence. In the end Yuuki, his beloved girl had chosen Kiryu over him. He saw this as Kiryu's fault that this had happened. She never would have left if it wasn't for Zero, she would still have continued to live with Kaname, she would still have continued to be Kaname's beloved Yuuki.</p><p>He walked on alone. Tears were slowly starting to fall down his deathly pale cheeks, which was very unusual for a pure-blooded vampire. Pureblood vampires were never supposed to cry, crying would be showing weakness, showing vulnerability. But still, Kaname Kuran was silently shedding tears of sorrow as he walked in the pure white snow with delicate flakes of snow falling down hard and fast across everywhere. He didn't care what others would think of him, didn't care that he was a pureblood and had an image to uphold to the world. Right now he was in deep pain, he had lost his precious girl to another guy and he didn't really think that anything or anyone could ever repair his broken heart.</p><p>For a long time Kaname walked in the dark, not caring where he went. After a while Kaname Kuran, the ancestor of the Kuran pureblood vampire clan surveyed his surroundings of the wintry night with eyes that were filled with sorrow. Kaname frowned, his vision slightly blurry from his tears, he had led himself towards the exit of the town. He had no idea that he had walked this far, Kaname turned around and started to walk back home.</p><p>Suddenly Kaname stopped in his tracks and saw through the falling of the snow, a man appear out of nowhere with a very loud cracking noise. The man was wearing a long brown travelling cloak, sneakers and blue jeans. Underneath the cloak he was wearing a dark blue collared button up long sleeved shirt, there also appeared to be a long sword attached to his back.</p><p>The man was of average height, pale, had black messy hair, was wearing black rimmed glasses, had green eyes and on his forehead there was a faded scar in the shape of a lightning bolt. Kaname stared at the man and soon realised that the man in front of him was a human and appeared to be in his early 20's. Through Kaname's pain he felt something stir inside him at the beautiful sight before him. The man in front of Kaname was very attractive for a male human, beautiful even and had the most beautiful eyes on a human that he had ever seen, bright green like emeralds.</p><p>Kaname heard the man swear quite colourfully as he saw the weather that was falling down on him. The man wrapped his cloak closer around him for some warmth.</p><p>Kaname wiped his tears away and stepped closer to get a closer look at this young man, fascinated and his eyes narrowed when his vampire senses picked up the presence of another vampire near the man. There was another vampire near the human and his blood red eyes were shining in the darkness of the wintry night as he licked his lips hungrily, a level E vampire that Kiryu hadn't hunted down yet.</p><p>The man hadn't noticed it yet but quite close to where he had appeared out of nowhere the vampire was slowly creeping towards him.</p><p>Kaname watched, Kaname wanted to protect this young man, there was something about him, Kaname wasn't sure what it was that he was feeling but knew that it didn't matter at the present moment. There was no time to think about it, the level E vampire was too close to the man, much too close.</p><p>"Hey, Kid" said the vampire who was close to the mysterious young human.</p><p>"What?" asked the human cautiously turning to face the vampire who was now invading his personal space.</p><p>The human's eyes widened and he tried to take a step back and pull out the long sword that was attached to his back but the vampire quickly grabbed hold of his right arm tightly and placed a hand over his mouth. The vampire had his fangs out and he pulled the human closer to his body. The human struggled but the grip on his arm was too tight and too strong. The vampire roughly lowered the cloak on the human's body low just enough so he could see a bit of a slender pale neck. And then within moments the level E vampire had his fangs mere inches from the human's flesh.</p><p>At the exact moment when the vampire had sunk his fangs into the human's neck Kaname had thrust his hand right through the vampire's chest, just like the night when he had saved Yuuki when she was very young. The Level E vampire was now dead, and Kaname tore his hand from the Level E and the level E vampire's body fell to the ground, the blood of the Level E vampire on the sleeve of Kaname's shirt.</p><p>Kaname then stepped across to the human, the human stared at him from the ground and Kaname rearranged his features into a kind gentle expression. The human was clutching his neck where the Level E vampire had bitten him, blood escaping from the wound on his neck. Still holding his hand to the wound on his neck the human shakily got to his feet and stared cautiously at Kaname.</p><p>"Thank you, sir for saving me from that level E vampire" the human said not taking his green eyes off of Kaname.</p><p>"You know that it was a vampire?" Kaname said softly.</p><p>Harry nodded, and said "Yes, I've come across vampires before and I'm sorry that you had to save me, I do know how to protect myself against them"</p><p>"Is that so? Well, I am glad that you are not helpless then, I will allow you to fight it off if there is a next time." said Kaname with a teasing smirk.</p><p>"What is your name?" asked Kaname, studying the human quietly.</p><p>"Harry, Sir" said the human now standing up straight.</p><p>"What are you doing out here at this time and at such conditions, Harry-kun?" Kaname asked.</p><p>"I was sent a letter to meet a Kaien Cross. You don't know where I can find him do you?" said Harry</p><p>"Yes I do, but I don't think it would a good idea to meet him in this weather and especially since you were just attacked by a Level E Vampire" said Kaname</p><p>Kaname stared at the beautiful creature standing before him and smiled at him, he couldn't help it, this human ...he was beautiful.</p><p>"My name is Kaname Kuran by the way, I have a house that is close to here, so if you want to you can stay there for the night and I will take you to Kaien Cross in the morning." Said Kaname</p><p>"Oh but I don't want to impose" said Harry looking a bit unsure.</p><p>"Oh, you wouldn't be, I assure you" Kaname said.</p><p>"Um, ok, then, er, Kaname-san" Harry said</p><p>"Follow and stay close to me, Harry-kun and please just call me Kaname" said Kaname</p><p>Harry nodded, he still had blood running down his neck; Kaname could both see and smell it. Harry did as he was told and followed Kaname through the wintry night towards Kaname's home.</p><p>They were both silent for a while, both watching each other, while walking towards their destination until Harry decided to speak.</p><p>"Can I ask you something Kaname?" asked Harry.</p><p>Kaname nodded, eyeing Harry with slight curiosity.</p><p>"Are you a pure blooded vampire?" said Harry</p><p>Kaname froze, he turned to face Harry completely who had stopped walking. On Harry's face was an expression of innocent curiosity, but Kaname could also see that Harry was regarding him with cautious eyes. Despite the look in Harry's eyes though, Kaname smiled, after all it would only make sense for Harry to be careful around vampires if he had to protect himself against them before.</p><p>"What makes you say that Harry –Kun? Even if you have come across vampires before, what makes you think that I am a pure blooded vampire?" said Kaname.</p><p>"I saw that your eyes were red, you have unbelievable strength and you are able to control your bloodlust. Level E vampires aren't that powerful and they have no self control, Level E vampires are like animals." said Harry</p><p>"And who did you learn this from Harry?" asked Kaname</p><p>At this question Harry cast his eyes down to his feet, "An old teacher told me" said Harry quietly</p><p>"Really and what is his name?" said Kaname</p><p>Harry looked up to Kaname, a half sad half angry look in his eyes "I'd rather not tell if you don't mind Kaname"</p><p>Kaname decided not to pry, he didn't want to upset Harry about someone who might have been important to him. "Harry-kun, forgive me for asking then. You do not have to tell me if you do not wish to." Kaname said</p><p>"Thank you" said Harry quietly</p><p>"No problem" said Kaname</p><p>Kaname saw that Harry was still regarding him with cautious eyes and though he understood the reason, he said "Are you afraid of vampires Harry-kun?"</p><p>Harry shook his head slowly, "No I'm not really afraid of them, I just don't trust them. Level E vampires have no self control and can lose it and attack you at any given moment and Pure-blooded vampires, they will turn any human just on impulse" said Harry quietly</p><p>Kaname studied Harry with dark brown eyes, "And did this old teacher of yours tell you about these things as well?"</p><p>"Yes, h...he did" said Harry</p><p>There was silence for just a moment, until Kaname said "Harry-kun I will not harm you, I am a pure blooded vampire who believes in peace among vampires and humans. I will not make you into a vampire on a whim"</p><p>They then started to walk again to Kaname's house.</p><p>When they both arrived at a large house, there was someone waiting for Kaname at the door. It was a messy blonde haired man whose appearance was of a man in his 20's. He had a worried look on his face and as soon as Kaname and Harry walked through the door. His blue eyes turned blood red and his eyes widened both at the sight of Harry clutching his hands to his neck and at Kaname, his right arm covered in blood.</p><p>"Kaname – Sama, should you really be bringing a human here? And what? ...what happened?" Asked the blonde haired vampire worriedly in a hushed voice.</p><p>Kaname ignored the blonde and said "Aidou, this is Harry, he will be staying here overnight because of the weather conditions and because of a level E vampire who unwisely attacked him. You will treat him courteously and you will not touch him."</p><p>"Yes, Kaname – Sama" said Aidou, understanding.</p><p>Kaname then introduced Aidou to Harry. "Harry-kun, this is Hanabusa Aidou, if he harms you in any way at all, please inform me and I will deal with it appropriately" said Kaname.</p><p>"Thank you, Kaname," said Harry</p><p>Kaname sent Hanabusa a warning glare which prevented any outbursts that the blonde vampire was going to say.</p><p>"Kaname, can I use your bathroom please?" asked Harry</p><p>"Of course, Harry-kun. There are some medical supplies in the bathroom .you can wash the blood off your neck from when that Level E vampire bit you" said Kaname.</p><p>Kaname turned to Hanabusa, "Aidou show Harry – kun the bathroom, please" said Kaname.</p><p>"Yes, Kaname – Sama, I will." said Hanabusa.</p><p>"Oh, and Aidou one more thing" said Kaname right before Hanabusa even began to walk his way towards the bathroom.</p><p>"Yes, Kaname – Sama?" asked Hanabusa</p><p>Kaname's tone of voice suddenly turned from polite and friendly to cold and menacing as he said, "Again Aidou, I remind you that if anything unfortunate happens to that human in your presence, there will be consequences."</p><p>Hanabusa gulped in fear, and then went to show Harry towards the bathroom.</p><p>Hanabusa led Harry to a bathroom which was situated on the second floor. The bathroom had black detailed tiles on the floor, white tiled walls, a shower, a toilet and a sink with a sort of cabinet above it.</p><p>On the other side of the cabinet there was a mirror. The cabinet had three shelves on it and had bathroom items such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, bandages, medicine and other types of health related type items.</p><p>"Here, clean yourself up" said Hanabusa with his arms folded across his chest and an expression of dislike and distrust on his face.</p><p>"Thank you" said Harry .</p><p>Hanabusa then left the bathroom and waited outside after shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Harry washed his wound and put a bandaid patch on it and then stared at his face in the mirror, touching a hand lightly to his concealed wound. He couldn't believe he had allowed himself to be attacked by a Level E vampire like that; he had been careless, he shouldn't have let his guard down after he had apparated. It was stupid, he had fought a war that had Level E vampires on Voldemort's side, and Harry had been trained in the war not only in ways to kill Voldemort but also in ways to kill vampires so he was slightly disappointed in himself. With a sigh he then fixed up his clothes from when the vampire had moved them trying to get to his neck and then he left the bathroom to where Hanabusa was.</p><p>Hanabusa shot a glare at him, his arms still crossed against his chest, "Are you finished? Kaname – sama is waiting for you" said the blonde in an impatient tone.</p><p>Harry nodded at Hanabusa and then followed the blonde vampire to where Kaname Kuran was waiting for him.</p>
