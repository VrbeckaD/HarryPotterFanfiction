  <strong>Chapter One - </strong>
  <strong>Marcus</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>They said he was stupid.</p><p> </p><p>They also said things like “ you used to be such a smart child” and “ what happened to you, you used to be so brilliant!”</p><p> </p><p>They would sometimes add phrases like “must be all the quidditch he plays”, “ too many bludgers to the head”, and his favourite; “ Well not every child learns at the same pace I suppose.”</p><p> </p><p>The truth was that he had gotten smarter in a different way.</p><p> </p><p>He’d gotten smarter at playing stupid.</p><p> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, though still hurtful, no one suspected a thing. No one ever questioned him.</p><p> </p><p>He had also gotten smarter at lying.</p><p> </p><p>About everything. It was almost second nature now, just like breathing and eating.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t start like that of course, it started innocently enough with pretending to stop reading and studying.</p><p> </p><p>He saw the disappointment in his mother’s eyes, the disapproval in his father’s, but all of this was better than the alternative. Better than what his parents had in mind for him.</p><p> </p><p>He had heard them one evening and knew he needed to do something.</p><p> </p><p>So he kept on failing. Barely finishing homework, never doing the assigned readings, and flunking exams.</p><p> </p><p>He could see the way the teachers looked at him too.</p><p> </p><p>A failure.</p><p> </p><p>But that again was better than the alternative.</p><p> </p><p>When it was official that he was returning to Hogwarts to redo his seventh year, it was worth what felt like hours of torture his father put his through.</p><p> </p><p>Hogwarts was a haven.</p><p>Hogwarts was safe</p><p>Hogwarts was time.</p><p> </p><p>Borrowed time, but still time for him to try and find a solution.</p><p> </p><p>He wasn’t a Slytherin for no reason, he was cunning and resourceful, and he had a whole year to figure out something. It should be enough.</p><p> </p><p>Please let it be enough.</p><p> </p><p>His father had made it quite clear what would happen to him if he didn’t succeed this time with reasonable grades.</p><p> </p><p>Although he constantly thought about it, above everything else he was happy to return to the pitch.</p><p> </p><p>To fly around, to play and hear the crowd roar around him as the wind hits his face and the adrenaline rushes in.</p><p> </p><p>Over the summer Professor Snape had assure him he would keep his position as captain if in exchange he would make an effort in his potion class, and this simple statement had been the small light he had hold on to for the duration of his stay with his parents.</p><p> </p><p>Quidditch, and just flying in general, had been his solace over the years at Flint Manor.</p><p> </p><p>When he was younger, he loved to imagine that if he flew high enough on his small broom he could touch the sky and escape among the stars. Now, years later, he would go out onto the large stretch of lawn on the estate ground and fly for hours, until the sun was settling down and he could barely see anything anymore. He would play imaginary games against invisible opponents, and plan new tactics for the upcoming season.</p><p> </p><p>He would avoid spending as much time as he possibly could with his parents, making an appearance only for the mandatory dinner. He would grab breakfast in his room, or a quick bite in the kitchen before disappearing for the day.</p><p> </p><p>He’d pack his school bag with some snacks and a book, grab his broom and fly to the pond at the edge of their estate. He would fly around there, read, or sometimes, on extremely hot days, just lounged around on the grass under the large weeping willow. It was a bit harder to escape on rainy days, but he would climb up to the dusty, unused attic of the east wing and spend the day there. He found the abandoned wooden door years ago, and had slowly started to bring things in to accommodate himself.</p><p> </p><p>Solitude never bothered him, being an only child got him used to it, but a small part of him would sometimes crawl up to the surface and wish he had someone to share in some of the burden. To talk to when things would get too heavy.</p><p> </p><p>He never was a social kid. He was shy by nature, even if today no one could tell, and it took his years to finally trust two students enough to call them friends.</p><p> </p><p>Adrian and Terence were probably what he would call his best friends. They were Slytherins, both pureblood and from rich and powerful families. By definition, they filled all the requirements for his parents to tolerate them. On summer days, he would invite them over and his parents would rarely oppose it, his father letting out an uncommitted “mmh” when he would ask them for permission.</p><p> </p><p>They would never discuss anything too heavy or compromising when they came over. Flint Manor had many ears too eager to speak.</p><p> </p><p>When they would come over, conversations were limited to quidditch, school and safe enough things they had read in <em>The Daily Prophet. </em>The important conversations were kept for their dorm.</p><p> </p><p>In the dead of night, when non of them could really sleep, they would talk in hushed voices about the future and what role their parents wanted them to play in the grand scheme of things. It took them all a long time to be honest with each other. They would dance around subject, saying ambiguous statements to see where the others stand on a certain issue. Terence, in the middle of a comfortable silence had been the one dropping the act and go straight to the point.</p><p> </p><p>“ I don’t really care about blood,” he had said.</p><p> </p><p>Marcus and Adrian had turned their head toward him in confusion. Adrian had asked what he meant by that.</p><p> </p><p>“ I just… You know, what our parents keeps on drilling in our minds since we can walk… It seems so fake… and wrong…”</p><p> </p><p>The silence had dragged on after that statement, heavy with the weight of their thoughts. Someone had finally said what he had been thinking, and he felt lighter in that moment then he ever did.</p><p> </p><p>“ Yeah… I get it… I feel like that too…” Adrian had said, looking over at him.</p><p> </p><p>He nodded, locking eyes with his two best friends. The weight lifted a bit more when they gave him a half smile back.</p><p> </p><p>He had never considered himself as a defender of wizard’s rights, but he truly couldn’t understand why his family, and other old ones, was so obsessed with blood purity. He couldn’t care less what lineage a wizard or witch was as long as they were half decent and not a complete idiot. That opinion he kept buried deep inside him when he was around his parents and their circle of friends.</p><p> </p><p>He still remembered as if it was yesterday, his flesh overrun by phantom pain every time he would thing too much about it. It was after he had come back from Hogwarts for Christmas on his first year. He had asked his mother what was so wring about people who had one or both parents as muggleborn. He had seen one very clever girl in his class who would nail all her spell and he father was a muggle. There was others too who were smart and weren’t pureblood, surely it had to count for something no?</p><p> </p><p>The sour look that contorted his mother’s delicate and stony feature told him right away he had said something wrong. The loud clang of silverware on porcelain plate from the other side of the long oak table simply confirmed it.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t sleep at all that night.</p><p> </p><p>In the darkness of his room, under the moon and stars weakly shining through he promised he wouldn’t let that happen again.</p><p> </p><p>In the dark of the night he made a pack to never become his parents.</p><p> </p><p>So from that day on he stopped being a good student. He stopped being himself. He came back to Hogwarts after Christmas and did the bare minimum. Pretended not to care about lessons or anything at all for that matter.</p><p> </p><p>They said he was a disappointment.</p><p> </p><p>“ What are we going to do with you Marcus…”</p><p> </p><p>“ You used to be a smart boy! You are ruining our name!”<br/> <br/> “ Such an embarrassment…”</p><p> </p><p>They said he would do nothing worthy of his life.</p><p> </p><p>And he took it all in. Never flinching, never surrendering.</p><p> </p><p>All the hate, the glares, the cold comments and abuse. All of it he shouldered it, and killed who he was for this new Marcus Flint. A Marcus Flint that didn’t care for school, that didn’t talk with anyone and sneered at them for getting too close. A sour, stereotypical Slytherin shell of himself.</p><p> </p><p>Adrian asked him once why he was going through so much trouble to be someone else. Him and Terence were the only ones who really had gotten to see his soft side as they called it. They’d been drinking by the great lake one night, a stolen bottle of Firewhiskey doing rounds between the three of them. They had sneaked out of the dungeons to a hidden spot they liked and were watching the stars mirroring on the water surface.</p><p> </p><p>The lie he keeps on telling himself now is that he was taken by surprise and slightly tipsy, which is why he had actually answered truthfully instead of telling him to fuck off. The truth was that it felt good to share with someone. If lifted the weights of his shoulders for a fraction of a second.</p><p> </p><p>He told them that he didn’t care about what they said and did to him. That it all didn’t matter because he would make that choice over and over again if he had to.</p><p> </p><p>Because it was way better than the alternative.</p><p> </p><p>Better than the plan his parents had for him.</p><p> </p><p>For he preferred to be called a dumb troll, a snake, a disappointment and failure, than join the ranks of purebloods stupidly waiting for You-Know-Who’s return. To become a Death Eater like his father had been, though no real proof had ever seen the light of day, to join in some unforgivable crime and hate group, and all for what?</p><p> </p><p>His parents said blood was everything.</p><p> </p><p>For Marcus, it was just another liquid. The fact that he was sharing some of it with his parents certainly didn’t define him. And he certainly wouldn’t let it.</p><p> </p><p>No matter the things they say.</p>
