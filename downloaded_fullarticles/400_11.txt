    <span>Chapter 1: Of introductions and moving out </span>
  </b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, here I am, a brand new resident in this really tiny place called Godric’s Hollow. Not my decision, I was pretty happy in my London’s big flat with my parents.  I may have forgotten to introduce myself, and skip to the whining part, sorry about that...! I’m Dorcas Meadowes, only child in a wizard family. I’m seventeen, and I can describe myself as average. Average tall (5 feet 4 inches), with average shape (genetic gave me good and bad, I’m thin, but I would like to have a little more at some specific places…) my skin is very pale, I have blue-grayish eyes (why not just blue or just gray?) some damn freckles around the nose and long wavy dark brown hair (my hair are as ambivalent than my eyes, not able to reach a decision between straight or curly, they decided to be both). This will be my final year at Hogwarts, school of witchcraft and wizardry. I am, like my dad was, a Gryffondor. My mom, more the brainy type, was a Ravenclaw. My mom and dad, Luvinia and Richard Meadowes, are famous Aurors in the wizarding world. All I know is that they are very engaged in the battle against Voldemort (in this family, we do not fear to use the name...) and his followers, who called themselves death-eaters. Very dangerous work indeed... That’s why they wanted to protect me, by sending me away at my grandmother’s house in Godric’s Hollow. They put the house under a protection spell years ago to protect her, and now me. I love her, I do, but I miss the city very much, there’s nothing to do here... But I do understand in what fucked up world I grew up... These are dark times for the wizarding world. Attacks are multiplying and everybody begins to fear for themselves and for the people they love. And the fact that my parents are working against dark and powerful wizards puts us all in danger. So, it’s the reason I’m here, in the countryside for the rest of the summer (a month).  </span>

  <span>I’ve just finished unpacking my stuff when I decided to write to Lily. Lily Evans, a brilliant muggle-born witch, my best friend since we met in our dormitory on our first night in Hogwart. We’re very different, she’s studious where I am lazy (we are both good though), I love Quidditch as much as she loves potions (I hate potions), she’s a stunning red-head and I’m an ordinary brown-haired girl. But I do think that our differences are what keeps our friendship interesting. </span>

  <em>Hi Lils, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s done, I’m relocated. I’ve already asked my gran if you can join me here and she agreed. Feel free to come as soon as your sister’s wedding is done. The good news is, she will be moving veeeery soon with this horrible man, good for you! Tell me when you’re planning to come, I’ll apparate at your house because you can’t apparate here without me, the house is hidden as I told you. I can’t wait! You know who happens to live nearby too? Your favorite. Well, since recently, I know you would have been displeased by this proximity, but we both know that it’s not entirely true anymore don’t we? Miss you so much, can’t wait to spend time with you soon.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Keep me posted, Red.  </em>
</p><p>

  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I fixed the letter to my owl named Colonel and opened the window. As I do, I saw my gran outside, having a hard time trying to get rid of those wicked garden gnomes. Well, if there is something we don’t have to deal with downtown London, it’s these little demons. But I have to say, I do enjoy this task a little bit, I can pass some frustrations on those. I’ll go help her. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span> Two very long and boring days later (I know, I can be very dramatic sometimes) I’m having breakfast with gran when my owl came back. I got up and went to open the window to let him in. I took the letter and looked at my gran. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>It’s from Lily. </span><span> </span>
</li>
</ul><p>
  <span>I opened the letter with anticipation. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>Hello Dor,  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Happily relocated I see! I assure you that I count the days until Tunia’s wedding, 8 days to go! It will be a nightmare, but after, she will be gone and I can’t say that I will miss her and Vernon that much. So, the wedding is august the 10th, I will come join you the 12th. I’m very excited about it, my summer was nothing but boring. And I do love the countryside, I won’t miss my boring suburban… I know that Potter lives there, he told me years ago. Don’t put your hopes too high, the fact that he doesn’t annoys me as much as before doesn’t mean I fancy him. We’re just trying to be friends, that’s all. He wrote to me last week can you believe it? And I answered him, even more unbelievable. I think he’s more mature, I don’t know what changed. And you? Still not ready to confess that you fancy Black? You wouldn’t be the first to, you know! You two never miss an occasion to fight, it is kinda cute.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>We’ll talk about this when we see each other SOON! </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’ll wait for you Monday the 12th at 11:00! Please be nice and don’t apparate directly in my room and give me a heart attack like last time?  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>See you soon, brunette. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lily xxx </em>
</p><p>
  <span>I turned to my gran with a smile.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>So, she’s coming soon, dear? She asked</span><span> </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Yes, next Monday. </span><span> </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>And how is she coming? Do I have to get a special permission to open the chimney? </span><span> </span>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<span>No, we keep it simple, I’ll apparate at her place and bring her back here. </span><span> </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Oh fine. What will you do today? I still have some work in the garden if you can help.</span><span> </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Of course.</span><span> </span>
</li>
</ul><p>
  <span>Since I have NOTHING BETTER to do anyway... </span>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Good, I can use the help, and after I’ll make you a fantastic pie as a reward! She said, getting up and patting my shoulder affectionately. </span><span> </span>
</li>
</ul><p>
  <span>Oh. The pies. One of the things who makes this situation very bearable. My gran is a marvelous cook. Everything she touches becomes a feast. She’s even better than Hogwarts's house elves, and it’s a big compliment. So, after cleaning the dishes, I grab a horrible big straw hat and follow gran in the garden. I rethink about Lily’s letter. I think I annoy her with Potter as much as she annoys me with Black. The difference is big though. Potter court her (very loudly I should add) since our second year. He’s never being subtle about it. He wants her, pretty bad, he’s joking and all, but I know he’s madly in love with her. I do know him a little. I play Quidditch since my fourth year as a chaser for Gryffindor’s team. And Potter is our seeker and our captain. So, I know him better since. Decent bloke. He’s part of a famous group of popular pranksters the same year as us girls. It’s a good thing we are good at Quidditch, because we lose the house cup every year because of them (remember, famous pranksters?). There’s James Potter, the leader, the famous seeker, he’s from an old and rich wizard family and he’s like me, good at school without even trying that much (I think he’s actually better than me). He’s attractive, even Lily can’t say otherwise. It’s not that he’s stunningly hot, he is good-looking, but it’s more his attitude that makes him attractive. He’s charismatic, smart, funny, and nice (with us fellow Gryffindors at least). And then, there’s Remus Lupin, a very great gal, also easy for the eyes and such a good person, generous and so nice, I like him a lot... He seems to have a very fragile health, but he’s also one of the most kind and brilliant wizards I know. He’s in team Lily for the studious thing, they spend a lot of time together studying in the library, but I’m not complaining, because she’s not always asking me to go with her because she has Remus. The third one is Peter Pettigrew, I don’t have much to say, he’s fine, but we don’t have much in common, between us, I often think that he just can’t believe his luck to be with the other three… He’s not that good in class, he doesn’t have much to say, but he’s nice. There’s something, though, he kinda gets on my nerves sometimes, but I try to be nice because he is nice with me so... And the last one, I kept him last, didn’t I? Sirius Black. First son in a wealthy and old pure-blood family whom my parents told me to be absolutely horrible, he’s like Potter’s brother he never had. I’ve heard a rumor that he’s actually living at the Potter’s, but never dare to ask. He’s very good at school, and insanely handsome. I mean, it shouldn’t be legal. I told you how Potter is charming and nice and all and that makes him attractive? Well, Black is very, very, very attractive, but could be a little more charming! He just seemed to care for nothing outside his friends and Quidditch. He’s moody, sometimes he’s nice and all, other times it feels like he’s closing himself and he’s colder. I never know when it will happen. He’s kind of an enigma, I wish I knew him better actually. But our contacts are superficial ones, we tease and joke, but nothing serious ever. He’s one of the team’s beater and since I’m in the team, I’m one of his favorite targets to annoy. We fight, a lot. Him and Potter seems to never take anything seriously, it’s equally fun and exasperating. Sirius is annoying and gorgeous, so, my way of hiding my uneasiness around him is to use my marvelous sense of repartee. Because he’s not shy. Not at all. A lot of girls turn around him in school. A lot. He doesn’t seem to care that much, though. He had a couple of girlfriends since I know him, but it never lasted more than a couple of weeks. I think he priories his close circle of friends and doesn’t let space for a girl (none of them seems to do, now that I think about it... But Potter would if Lily let him...). Lily thinks I fancy him. Do I? Don’t know, I never fancied anyone really, I don’t think the vampire lead singer of the music band </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Immortals</span>
  </em>
  <span> count…! (OH, MERLIN IS HE GORGEOUS). All in all, I think Lily is tired of me teasing her with Potter and teasing me with Black is her way of shutting me off. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a couple of hours, we left the garden to have lunch outside. it’s shiny, which is rare here.  When I was standing to help clean the table, I heard a very familiar laugh.</span>
