          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco blinked at Harry. “Really. I tell you <em>any fantasy, Potter</em>. I say, <em>go for it</em>. I say, <em>almost nothing’s off-limits</em>. And you want to choke me out and not let me come? I thought you were going to have me dress up as a Dementor and get my ass fucked.”</p><p>Harry stared right back. “You <em>what</em>?”</p><p>“Never mind,” Draco huffed. “Fine. Let’s do this.”</p><p>“Not so fast,” Harry said. “You forgot the most important part of it.” </p><p>Draco frowned. “What part? All of it’s unimportant.”</p><p>“The part,” Harry said, and Draco sucked in a sharp breath at the look on his face, “where it’s a <em>surprise.</em>”</p><p align="center">###</p><p>That had been the last they’d spoken about any of it for almost three weeks. </p><p>They also hadn’t had sex since the conversation, despite Draco’s advances, and honestly? Draco was getting annoyed. He was getting <em>pissed off</em>. </p><p>And he was getting <em>horny</em>. </p><p>He was wanking twice a day, easily, and it still wasn’t enough. Mostly because he’d gotten used to Harry sucking him off or fucking him at least every couple of days, and, for some unknown reason, one’s own hand was much less pleasurable. </p><p>Draco huffed, flipping to the next page in his book. Maybe he should go out and purchase some of that Muggle pornography for himself. If nothing else, he could amuse himself with how impractical their solutions to sex were. </p><p>A hand slapped over his mouth and fingers pinched his nose shut. Draco shouted and immediately regretted it as he lost most of his air in one fell swoop. </p><p>“That was stupid, Draco. Wasn’t it?”</p><p>Draco barely relaxed knowing it was Harry. Harry was probably twice as evil as anybody breaking into the house, anyway. </p><p>“I’ll let you get another breath in. But you’ll come within three breaths or you won’t come at all. And yes,” Harry let go of Draco’s nose, “that one counted.”</p><p>Draco breathed out all the air he could and sucked in another breath, as deeply as he could. The moment he started to hold it, Harry pinched down on his nose again. “Take your cock out and jerk yourself off.”</p><p>Draco wasn’t even <em>hard enough</em> yet! He couldn’t <em>come</em> on <em>command</em>. </p><p>Unlike <em>some</em> people. </p><p>He obeyed as quickly as he could, though, already getting dizzy from the lack of air, but refusing to tap out just yet. It had been three weeks—maybe if he came like Harry wanted, Harry’d fuck him again. </p><p>He tried to picture Harry, completely naked and hard, behind him, dripping, hoping Draco would come so he could fuck into him. </p><p>He hardened fast enough, but he started struggling against Harry’s hold despite himself and Harry let go of his nose so he could take another breath. </p><p>His last one to come with—or he wouldn’t be allowed to come at all. </p><p>Draco wanked himself as hard and fast as he could, but the friction <em>hurt</em>, and he couldn’t get close enough before he was getting too lightheaded again and Harry was letting go of his mouth and nose and stilling his hands—pinning them to the sofa instead. </p><p>“That’s unfortunate,” Harry murmured, and Draco could hear the smug smile in his voice. “Looks like you won’t be coming just yet, Draco.”</p><p>Draco shuddered, groaning as Harry’s grip tightened and then he let go altogether. </p><p>“We’ll try again… soon enough.”</p><p>Harry laughed as he left and Draco stared down at his lap. </p><p>
  <em>Well, then. </em>
