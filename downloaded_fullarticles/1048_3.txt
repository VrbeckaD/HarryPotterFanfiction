  <em> Merlin was a wizard born and raised within the muggle world, He aided in the war by King Arthur’s side until the man’s death. Soon after, Merlin moved to this magical realm, causing many others to follow the path he left behind. This was when our world was first introduced to those we now call, Muggle-borns. </em>
</p><p align="center">Mudblood’s<em> will bring </em> <b> <em>ruin</em> </b> <em> to the true meaning of witchcraft and wizardry. They carry over their misconceptions and false beliefs. </em><em>They call my house </em> <b> <em>dark</em></b><em>, full of creatures which devour the blood of others to live long lives! </em></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><em>Magic cannot be dark in nature, it is nature! We are powerful because we are not tainted with the blood of a mortal, not chained to the elements within our world.  </em><em>We live long lives, partially due to our practices? Yes, but our magic also subconsciously heals our internal being, in ways, theirs. do. </em> <b> <em>not</em> </b> <em> . </em></p><p align="center">
  <em> And because of our extensive lives, it's led to our extensive knowledge; we’ve built the foundation of which all wizards stand on today. </em>
  <em>My lineage has obtained the remarkable ability to communicate with dragons and other reptiles similar in nature. This talent, which can only be known by those of Slytherin blood, is what we call, Parseltongue. </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><em>     More each day I see the way they criticize us, our magic, and our creatures, merely due to their ignorance and fright. </em> <em>Those within Godric and Helga’s houses have started to refer to themselves as lighter, kinder, and more deserving than those within Rowena’s and my own. </em> <em>Life in the castle has started to turn more competitive and I fear that the support we’ve spent years of dedication trying to build, will crumble before my very eyes - taking the world’s magic along with it... </em></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><em>     Rowena has grown sick, leaving her thoughts more on her stray daughter these moments, rather than her own house. </em> <em>Godric and Helga won’t listen to reason, they choose to remain ignorant towards the damage the Mudbloods are causing us. </em> <em>I don’t want to leave our life’s work; but they're leaving me no choice, I’d rather not witness the downfall that’s sure to become of our establishment. </em></p><p align="center">
  <em>To my heir; I hope time bodes you well, and that you're not in a world governed by muggles -how dreadful a place that would surely be. </em>
