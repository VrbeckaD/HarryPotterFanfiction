    <p>The Incredible Babysitter Chapter 1</p><p>       Harry looked around his new home in Metroville and nodded happily. It hadn't been as hard as he'd feared, getting himself set up with a new identity and moving across the Pond. Well, not so much a new identity as getting the papers to prove he existed. He was still Harry Potter, a British immigrant, he was just supposedly born July 31, 1937.</p><p>       It had been a shock when the Veil spat him out in an alternate 1958. He knew it was an alternate universe since there was no Ministry of Magic, no Hogwarts, no Platform 9 3/4s and no Grimmauld Place. At least he had his mokeskin pouch on him when he tripped through the Veil of Death.</p><p>       No, really. He tripped. The damned reporters and Ministry had him walking them through the Department of Mysteries when one of the Ministry aids tripped and fell on the floor. Trying to avoid him, Harry had moved back and stepped on a jar of ink that had rolled across the floor and tipped backwards. Right through the Veil. That was it. Harry still felt slightly indignant over it. They all probably thought he was dead and had died in an incredibly lame way. He survived Voldemort, a Basilisk, over 100 Dementors and an ink jar is what takes him out. He could see the headlines now. "Savior Dead by Ink Jar!"</p><p>       When Harry had landed in the middle of an alleyway, he had immediately patted himself down. Happily, there were no missing or added bits that shouldn't be there and his mokeskin pouch that was charmed just like Hermione's purse. Money, potions, potion ingredients and equipment, clothes, his broom, and yes, reference books. Since he had the funds to do so, he had bought a copy of every book that he could get his hands on that wasn't already in the Black Library. There were still quite a few that he didn't own, but he thought he had the basics of at least everything that was taught at Hogwarts.</p><p>       When Harry had realized that there was no Wizarding World to be found, he had taken 150 of his Galleons and went to sell them. Not wanting to be targeted or put on any government's watch list, he had worn glamours and sold only a few at jewelry stores throughout England. In the end, he had about 43 thousand euros and he had it promptly converted to American dollars. He lost about a thousand in the exchange, but it was enough to get him started in America, especially considering the cost of living in this time period. A house, a car, furniture, some groceries. And an aeroplane ticket, can't forget that. Before he left, he snuck into the London Records Hall and, with the help of a Confundus, had his new papers in hand as well as a visa.</p><p>       It was the work of a few days to get a new home and car, but the Hotel he had checked into was comfortable, so he wasn't in a rush. He wanted his new home to be perfect since it was going to be his first real home. One that was all his. His to design, his to maintain, his to be himself in, his. When all was said and done, he was holding the keys to his new house and car and directing the movers on where to put his new furniture.</p><p>       His first few months there were relaxing and he applied to the Metroville University to try and have a normal school experience without anyone trying to kill him and so he'd be able to adapt better to his new life. His new neighbors were kind and the housewives on the street cooed over him and continuously tried to feed him and mother him after he mentioned at a barbeque he had attended that he was an orphan that had moved to America to start a new life, especially Karen McKeen from a few doors down. He was pretty sure her daughter Kari had a crush on him. Which was ok, he could just ignore it. Michael McKeen had offered to help him learn how to get around town. All in all, Harry was very pleased with his new life.</p><p>       In the first month or so, Harry had come across some surprising information. While this world may not have magic, it did have superheroes. Yes, superheroes. Intrigued, he dug a bit more to learn about them. Ostensibly, it was so that he wouldn't stand out for not knowing about these people who were such a prominent part of history here in America. Honestly, Harry was just excited. He had been able to sneak a comic or two into his cupboard when he was younger and he had been fascinated by them. And in this world, they were real. He was dismayed by the downward spiral they eventually took, with all the normals suing the supers until they went into hiding.</p><p>       The months passed and he celebrated the holidays with his new friends from Uni and rung in the new year with them, too. Then, in the spring of 1959, the Parrs moved in across the street.</p>
