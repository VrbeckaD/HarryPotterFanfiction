  <span>“Don’t you look pretty?” Neville smiled, and entered his bedroom and spotted Blaise on the bed wearing nothing but a bow somewhere unmentionable. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You know I do.” Blaise smirked, body stretched out to pose perfectly against the backdrop of blue satin sheets. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He wanted to climb in there with Blaise, especially after the day he’d had, however he was covered from head-to-toe in potting soil and  bites from thorny vines. Blaise could see Neville's hesitation, and shifted onto his knees. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey. Come here.” Blaise urged. Neville shook his head.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I should go wash up. I don’t want to get the sheets dirty.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We can wash the sheets Nev.” Blaise could tell this went a little deeper than dirt. “Did something happen?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Neville paused.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“There was talk today. About how you're just toying with me.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Something flashed in Blaise’s eyes. Something Neville had only seen once before, when someone had dared say something negative about Neville in front of Blaise. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I think you know better than that Nev… You know just how much I desire you.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Desire is one thing Blaise… Love, I mean that’s something else entirely.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you asking me if I love you?” Blaise crawled on the bed towards Neville on all fours. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve been laying in bed, wearing nothing but a bow, for the last three hours waiting for you to come home, because I knew it would make you laugh. If that’s not love, then I don’t know what is.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Neville rolled his eyes and pulled Blaise in for a kiss, smearing dirt across the both their faces. He liked Blaise's kind of love.</span>
