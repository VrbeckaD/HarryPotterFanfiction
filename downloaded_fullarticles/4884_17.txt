    <p>Adrian Greengrass is bored. He is tired of the submissives who keep throwing themselves at his feet, who claim to be "very devoted" but turn out quite disappointing. Nobody at Morgan's is interesting lately. But someone just might have caught his eye. Some called Polynices Scamander. </p><p>The Scamander family is indeed a distinguished one among the wizard world of London, though Adrain Greengrass does not see eye to eye with this one in particular. Polynices has the reputation to be the disgrace of his family. He is soft, muggle loving, and most importantly, a Hufflepuff. As a Scamander, all of which are undoubtedly noble Slytherins, this is not something to be treated lightly. In fact, his family did consider to disown him when he openly spoke against the Wizengamot about their legal system, saying it was “primal and uncivilized”. But they couldn’t. After all, Polynices is the only heir of the Scamander family, and he is outstanding. Headboy, best chaser in years, published Theory of Partial Transfiguration when he was still a senior in Hogwarts, Polynices Scamander is truly a legend at school. But as the heir of Greengrass, Adrian would not play with a Hufflepuff, however competent and well-rounded he might be, for, say, over a month. Anyway, there are plenty of subs for him to choose from. It is quite a surprise that Polynices would even show up at Morgana’s, let alone as a dom. He just doesn’t seem the part. He must be the sweet and doting kind of dom, Adrian supposes, and very indulgent with his subs. He’s a Hufflepuff, how tough could he be? Adrian would challenge him in a dual, as an old member of the club, and win, and Pol would have to sub for him tonight. This would be so much fun.</p><p>Domming Polynices Scamander would mean a lot to Adrian, for he has secretly competing with him as early as he was just a student at Hogwarts. The heir of Greengrass must have the best of everything, that includes rivals. During his time in Slytherin Quidditch team as seeker, the Hufflepuff team prevailed, he was outshined by that Scamander boy every time, even when he was the one who caught the snitch. After graduation, Scamander disappeared for years, rumour had it he went to a muggle University called Oxford, studying god knows what, and still remains in connection to his muggle associates. Adrian did wonder why Scamander wasn't sorted into Ravenclaw, since he aces all the courses, well, maybe not the divination course, but in the end, his Hufflepuff disposition shows much more strongly than his raven side. For all his scholarly enthusiasm, he still cares more about people than knowledge.</p><p>But Adrian is drawn to Polynices for a whole different reason, though he hates to admit, Polynices is very good looking. Except for his fine features, years of field research also shows prominently on his body, accompanied by his usual reassuring temperament, he is really comfortable to look at. And Adrian notices he looks even better closely, not breathtakingly handsome, but moderate and warm. He would make a perfect sub.</p><p>As Adrian idly planning his conquer of this badger, his sub for today is dutifully servicing him, giving a massage that is nothing less of a professional’s. But he’s had better. He is accustomed to receiving all sorts of services, as a benefit of being a popular dom in Morgana’s, and of course, as a Greengrass. He wonders what it would feel like if he could have Polynices in his collar and leash. Tonight is the best opportunity. Scamander is being introduced as the newest member of the club, he has the right to initial a challenge as a little present from senior doms. This is the moment.</p><p>“Mr Scamander, I wonder if you are interested in playing today. With me, specifically. You owe me one since that Quidditch final when you were a senior, I’m sure you remember, the one I could have caught the Snitch if you didn’t purposely aimed the Quaffle at my face?” </p><p>“Mr Greengrass. It’s been a while, years actually, I’m flattered you remember. Sorry if I caused any discomfort, but I was actually aiming for the goal. And yes, I am interested in a scene, but you are aware that we are both doms, or am I mistaken?”</p><p>“Yes I am aware. I have that handled. Mr Black here would be out mutual assistant tonight if you’d accept my challenge for a dual. I assume you already knew the club rules?”</p><p>“The newest member is amenable to a challenge from a senior member, the one who wins shall dominate the one who loses for a night. Yes I know that one. And I humbly accept your challenge. After you, Mr Greengrass.”</p><p>Adrian and Polynices are led to the dueling ring. Adrian is sure he would win, he has never lost at a dual before, and he is much too familiar with the small tricks of this place. There is just no chance that he lost. </p><p>He is so wrong. He lost. Hard.</p><p>“So, Mr Greengrass, shall we begin?”</p>
