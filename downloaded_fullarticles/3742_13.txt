  <strong>One-Shot</strong>
</p><p align="justify">“Your name is Harry!” The black-haired green-eyed male frowned and turned towards the brown-haired and grey-eyed stranger. “You have a lightning scar on your forehead…”</p><p align="justify">“It’s a birthmark.”</p><p align="justify">“A scar on your left arm of a massive snake’s bit. The wounds I must not tell lies on said arm’s back of hand.” The teen looked at the back of his own hand uncertain. “On your right you have a scar on the forearm of a skull with a snake leaving its mouth!”</p><p align="justify">Then teen frowned. <em>Those were too much close to the truth of his birthmarks.</em></p><p align="justify">“It’s not scars. I was born with them.” He snapped. “Who are you and what do you want?”</p><p align="justify">The man laughed hysterically, almost like <em>‘finally!’</em>.</p><p align="justify">“We met… once upon a life, Harry.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not Harry.”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t care what this life parents named you, you are Harry!” the stranger argued, aproaching.</p><p align="justify">The teen huffed and turned around to leave.</p><p align="justify">“Leave me alone!” He snapped when the stranger made a move to grab him.</p><p align="justify">“I located Hedwig.”</p><p align="justify">Of all things that could have been said… that one made him frown and look at the other confused.</p><p align="justify">“Why do I know that name?”</p><p align="justify">“She was your familiar. Your pet. She was also reborn.”</p><p align="justify">A hand was offered. The teen looked at it for a real long time and then took it, following the stranger into his car.</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="justify">Tom picked up the white puppy and pulled it over the bed, letting Hedwig join Harry in the mattress.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>To think that of all people he had found reborn had to be his archenemy… he had almost thought to have gone mad…</em>
</p><p align="justify">He looked back at the teenager hugging the dog close.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Harry didn’t remember his past… and yet he had followed a total stranger home and allowed him to use and reuse his body…</em>
</p><p align="justify">“Were… were we lovers?” Harry asked as he petted the eager pup.</p><p align="justify"><em>To think that the dog had found Tom first. Recognising him and not leaving him until Tom asked if she was Hedwig, to which it gave a dog version of </em>‘what took you so long?’ <em>look.</em></p><p align="justify">“No.”</p><p align="justify">“Then why?”</p><p align="justify">“Three decades waiting for someone… you were the first… excuse me: Hedwig was the first. She found me.”</p><p align="justify">Harry snorted, he actually did as Hedwig somehow looked proud of herself.</p><p align="justify">“It was lust of the moment.”</p><p align="justify">“Probably… but, Harry?” Harry looked back. “I never did It before. You are the only person I ever did it with in both my lives.” The teenager gaped back. “And I’m not the sharing type.”</p><p align="justify">“But…”</p><p align="justify">“You do it with me, you are stuck with me.”</p><p align="justify">Tom let him assimilate the information. Finally Harry glanced at the ceiling.</p><p align="justify">“Besides the fact I’m underage… there’s the fact that I always wanted to have kids…”</p><p align="justify">“We’ll adopt.” Tom offered.</p><p align="justify">“Social Services…”</p><p align="justify">“I’m rich.”</p><p align="justify">Harry shut up before he nodded.</p><p align="justify">“You have work?”</p><p align="justify">“I fear so.” Tom agreed as he dressed himself in complete black instead of the suit he had been wearing earlier.</p><p align="justify">Harry hummed.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll see you after work then.” He agreed.</p><p align="justify">Tom smiled back and approached to share a kiss.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll be looking forward to it, my Harry.”</p><p align="justify"><em>Even if he didn’t find anyone else… he had Harry back. Who obviously was in need of some pampering if he was this easy to bring home. </em>Tom left and entered his car. He had a job to do.<em> In the past life he was a serial killer… in this he was hired to kill people.</em></p><p align="justify">
