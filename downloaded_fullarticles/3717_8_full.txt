              <p>Grace Potter is the long lost twin sister of Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived. While only Lily Potter died the night the twins got the scar, Grace was separated from her brother shortly after and was raised by James's little sister, Olivia, a presumed dead dark witch. She grew up being raised surrounded by magic and the Dark Arts and has a knack towards using it. However, going to Hogwarts opens up opportunities for meeting new friends, learning new things, and even forming her ever desired friendship with her brother. Only the Dark Magic in her begins to eat away at her inner being, and she has to find a way to harness the rogue magic in her to avoid mutating into the next Dark Lord.</p>

    <p><span class="veryhardreadability">The hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley during the weeks before Hogwarts always caused Grace to groan out of frustration, especially during the rush hours of mid afternoon </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> The streets were always packed with wizards and witches, but after lunch they were even more so, to the point where Grace could reach out with her arm in any direction and hit at least one witch, wizard, or muggle parent of the muggleborn students </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> As a result of the </span> <span class="adverb"> overly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> crowded streets, Grace had a hard time focusing on finding the right shop she was trying to visit </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> It was so hard in fact, that she had felt tempted to wait in the last store she visited until the roads cleared, but she didn’t know how long that would take and she needed to meet up with her aunt </span>.</p><p></p><div class="">

    <p> <span class="hardreadability">She scanned the shops around her on both sides of the street, intent on spotting the wand shop Ollivanders, so she could get her wand </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> The shop itself was a few stores down on the left hand side of the road, situated between two larger, and much newer shops </span> . Its two barreled windows that flanked its door and its <span class="complexword"> overall </span> dull color made it easy to spot. Grace hurried to slip inside.</p>

    <p><span class="veryhardreadability">As the door closed behind her, she heard a faint sigh from the back and a scruffy old man with wispy white hair, whom she assumed was Mr. Ollivander, stepped out to meet her </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> His shoulders curved forward the slightest bit as he stood and his robes were by no means fancy, but he gave off a quirky, but </span> <span class="adverb"> grandfatherly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> feel </span>.</p>

    <p>“How many I help you, Young Lady?” He asked kindly, although his expression was knowing. <span class="hardreadability"> After all, this was a wand shop, and all he sold was wands, no one would her age would come here for any other purpose than to buy a wand for Hogwarts </span> . He <span class="qualifier"> just </span> wants to be polite, she told herself and flashed a warm smile towards the old man. <span class="veryhardreadability"> She wasn’t there against her will, in fact, she wanted to be there, so she might as well get it over with and not act like a little child </span> <span class="qualifier"> just </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> because her aunt wasn't there with her </span>.</p>

    <p>“I’m here to get my wand,” She replied. <span class="veryhardreadability"> Mr. Ollivander nodded and several enchanted measuring tapes flew out of his pockets and took note of the weirdest measurements </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> She didn’t know why the distance between her knee and ankle was necessary for choosing her wand, but she didn’t object to his methods </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> After all, the Ollivander family owned the oldest and most popular wand shop in Great Britain, and his wands were always effective, reliable, and of a fine quality </span>.</p>

    <p>“Hold out your wand-arm,” He instructed moments later and Grace held out her right hand. <span class="hardreadability"> He removed a wand from one of the many boxes that filled the room from floor to ceiling and placed it </span> <span class="adverb"> gingerly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> in her open hand </span>.</p>

When she tried it out, a bright flash of sparks jumped from the tip of the wand. It sent an odd feeling jolting up her arm, and she knew that she didn’t want it. Mr. Ollivander proceeded to take the wand from her hand and handed her another.</p>

    <p>Like the first one, the reaction was small and didn’t seem right. She tried wand after wand, getting a small response from most, but none from others.

    <p>He disappeared into the back of his shop for a few moments and returned with a couple of wand boxes. <span class="hardreadability"> The first one he had her try, which he described as cherry with a dragon heartstring core, glowed </span> <span class="adverb"> brightly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> when placed in her hand </span> . <span class="complexword"> However </span>, it grew very hot to the touch and she dropped it out of fear of burning the inside of her hand.</p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p><span class="hardreadability"> This earned an intrigued look from the wand maker and he shuffled through the boxes he had brought from the back </span> . He settled on an old and dusty box and pulled out the wand that <span class="passivevoice"> was kept </span> inside.</p>

    <p>This wand grabbed Grace’s attention as it was <span class="adverb"> elegantly </span> crafted. The tan-brown wood appeared to be an off shade of red and a <span class="adverb"> lightly </span> carved, cobweb design adorned the base of the wand. <span class="hardreadability"> It struck Grace as antique, something that she might read about in medieval stories or what she might catch a glimpse of inside of an old family’s home </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> Other than its old fashioned design, the wand was straight, smooth, and well polished, appearing to be of high quality </span>.</p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p><span class="adverb"> Carefully </span> , she held out her hand and when he placed it in her hand, she gasped.

    <p><span class="hardreadability"> He watched her wrist movements with a careful eye as she gripped her wand a little tighter and admired its design </span> .
