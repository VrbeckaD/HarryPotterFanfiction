    <p>The year had been full of surprises, and you had to admit, getting into summer was a relief. Though the entire train ride home your stomach had been lurching, your fourth year at Hogwarts had started amazingly. You had quickly heard that within the year Hogwarts and two other wizarding schools would be participating in the Triwizard Tournaments, a large tournament that hadn't been held within schools for many years. You were ecstatic, though when the drawing if the names came you, along with everyone else, we're surprised to hear that there were to be two champions from Hogwarts. Cedric Diggory and Harry Potter. Although it came as a shock, you were never against Harry for participating, he'd told most of everyone that he'd never put his name in the cup and you believed him. But you had never imagined him getting through every task, especially when he was up against teens that were years ahead of him in classes. When the last task had come up you had a suspicion that Harry might make it through, but when he stood there with a clear shot to victory you hadn't thought that he'd choose to win with Cedric. It was humble of him, you grinned to yourself in your seat from the stands as they both reached for the cup. The next thing you knew they had disappeared, people began to panic. Professors left there seats and rushed to the scene. After a while Harry had returned with a limp body in his arms, your heart thumped in your chest, no! It can't be! you had thought to yourself recognizing the handsome Hufflepuff. The crowd let out a large gasp and chaos began to break loose. The stands were filled with shrieking voices. That was the last thing that you had remembered from the horrific night. The next day rumors had began to spread that Harry Potter had witnessed the rebirth of the most feared wizard in history. Voldemort. Most didn't believe him, you knew however, Harry would never make up a tale such as that. A month had passed and Harry had stayed in the hospital wing. A few days before every student was let out for summer the dark haired boy was allowed to return to Gryffindor tower. At dinner Dumbledore had given a few words asking the students to leave Harry alone and to not ask questions about what had happened in the maze. Everyone listened, some students had even begun to avoid him. You felt bad for Harry, the only people you ever saw him talk to were Hermione and Ron, and even then there were times when he just sat silently. The entire event was quite traumatic for everyone, but it was the worst for Harry. Few students had begun celebrating the upcoming summer, most were quite melancholy, including you.</p><p>    The day had finally come for everyone to pack and board the Hogwarts express to get home. You had quickly packed your trunk and made sure your owl was in its cage before setting off towards the grounds. You were one of the last students to get onto the train so it was quite difficult to find a compartment for yourself. On your way down the corridor you ran into three heavily jinxed bodies at your feet, the well-known Slytherins were hardly recognizable. But none the less you knew who they were, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle lay at your feet. You stared down at them with a slight smirk, they'd had it coming for a while now. They all laid unconscious, you glanced into the compartment next to them and saw Harry, Hermione, Ron, and the Weasley twins. The dark haired boy looked back at you from his game and you smirked darting your eyes down at the limp boys, a sign of gratitude for their humiliation. Harry's face turned slightly pink and he smiled shyly back at you before one of the twins snickered at him and he quickly turned back to the game. </p><p>    You chuckled to yourself and stepped over the Slytherins on the ground, you suddenly felt a tight grip on your ankle and you whipped around letting out a small whimper of surprise. You look down to see Malfoy's steel eyes staring up at you, he said nothing but you knew he was demanding you to help him. You cocked your head in feign innocence, his eyes narrowed slightly before you ripped your foot away from his grip and you kicked your heel to his nose. He definitely deserved that, you reassure yourself before walking away. </p><p>    You were able to find a compartment with a few other students from your house. You sat down and stared out the window, recalling the year. It was a while before the train had begun to slow down, telling you that you were coming to King's Cross train station. The train came to a stop and you stood up grabbing your trunk and owl cage, being in the back of the train you were naturally one of the last students off the train. As you stepped onto the platform you searched the crowd for your mum, after a moment you heard your name being called.</p><p>    "(Y/n)! (Y/n), over here!" Your mother's voice mixed in with the rest of the commotion, but you were able to pinpoint her and began walking that way. You smiled slightly and wiggled through the crowd to your mother. Her dark hair hung to her shoulders and her bright eyes gleamed as she smiled at you. She was a wizard, and your father a muggle, making you a half-blood.</p><p>    "Mum! I'm so glad to be home! You won't believe everything that happened this year!" You hugged her tight. </p><p>“I sure can’t believe what I’ve been reading in the Daily Prophet!” She replied, wide eyed, “I know not to believe that nonsense, but Word on the street is that Harry Potter saw He who must not be named!” She whispered quickly.</p><p>“Calm down mum, I’ll tell you everything when we get home, ” you reassured her.</p><p>    "We best be going then!" She said helping you with your trunk. You picked up your owl's cage as it gave a short screech and followed your mother. </p><p>    Once you had arrived home you sighed. Your house was fairly small, after all it was just your mum making income. On the outside the paint was chipping and the sidings needed to be replaced, the inside was slightly better. Inside was an open room plan, a small kitchen was separated from the small family space by an island counter. Down a tight hall we’re two rooms on opposite sides of the hall. It was small and simple, but it was home. Only you and your mum lived there, your father had been killed during Voldemort's reign before you were born, so you'd never known him. Though your mother quite often told you, that you were much like him. You had his (e/c) eyes.</p><p>    "Well! Tell me everything!" Your mother set down your trunk and forced you to sit down.</p><p>    "It was quite an interesting year..." you continued to tell your mum about everything that had happened during the year.</p><p>After you had told your mother everything she decided to go and prepare some dinner. You brought your trunk upstairs to your room, it wasn't large or lavish. In fact it was quite a plain room. Just a bed next to a window that let in light and a dresser in the corner. </p><p>After unpacking you went back downstairs to hear quiet and short breaths coming from your mother. You stepped towards her, "mum? What's wrong?" </p><p>"I-it's nothing sweetie, "she waved with her hand and choked back her tears, showing a weary and forced smile.</p><p>"Mum... what is it?" You pressed, sitting next to her on the small sofa.</p><p>She said nothing, only slid a neatly written letter to you. You scanned the page and she spoke up, "they let me go, th-they fired me! I-I thought I was getting a raise, but they fired me. We were going to be able to go on a trip this summer, but now... I'll hardly have enough to pay for the house..." She choked out. </p><p>You finished reading the letter and set it down on the coffee table, "hey, we'll figure something out. “You said calmly, “we don't need to go on a trip this summer, “ you added with a smile. Your mother didn't reply and you continued,  "Hey, I'll get a job, you can get another job, we'll do this together." </p><p>She nodded slightly and you smiled.</p><p>“Good! We'll go into Diagon Alley tomorrow and see if anyone is hiring, “ you said cheerfully, hoping to lighten the mood, “the Ministry doesn't know they just fired their best worker!” you cheered, earning a small chuckle from your mother.</p><p>“C’mon, let's finish making dinner, I'm starved!" You said with a wide smile as you tossed the letter.</p><p>Your mother smiled and stood up joining you in the kitchen.</p>
