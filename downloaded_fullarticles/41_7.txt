    <p>One might think that with all she's been through, Hermione Granger would never be scared again. And you'd be right.</p><p>Well, mostly right.</p><p>Sure, she's scared, but that doesn't stop her from facing her fears head on. </p><p>In fact, Draco considers her as one of the bravest women he's ever known, but he'd never say that out loud. Not now anyway.</p><p>After the majority of Hogwarts was repaired, students once again flooded through the ancient door. Staff of the mighty school unanimously decided that Defense of the Dark Arts was a mandatory class for every year. Most of the students were okay with this, but Draco Malfoy was not.</p><p>Oh no no no, this meant more classes which meant more people. More judging eyes, and more sneers (now on the receiving end, Draco discovered that it really wasn't pleasant in the tiniest bit) and more Harry bloody Potter.</p><p>The 'eighths years', as everyone called them, got to stay in their original house's dormitories and common rooms, but it wasn't enough to avoid prying eyes. It seemed that Harry Potter was once again following him. 'Round ever corner Draco turned, Potter was there , and it didn't help that they had almost every single class together. </p><p>Defense was no exception. Actually, Defense was one of Draco's bigger classes. It held almost all the eighths years and a good amount of seventh years. Draco was lucky enough to get Weasley, Granger, and Potter in that class.</p><p>
  <em>Woohoo.</em>
</p><p>It wasn't much of a shock when the new Defense teacher settled on reteaching their previous lessons for the class instead of providing appropriate defense lessons, despite the many disputes from Potter and his goons. It had been a few weeks after Potter's fruitless argument against Martin Surly (the newest defense teacher) when the class received the news that they were to spend the next week or so 'disarming a treacherous boggart' as professor Surly explained. Draco nearly rolled his eyes. </p><p>Actually, he did. </p><p>But when it became time to actually start the assignment, everyone in the class became as quite as Draco. People stopped volunteering for demonstrations, they started watching the floor and pretending they weren't paying attention. Except for Granger and a couple of annoying seventh years who followed in het footsteps of perfection. So it wasn't exactly a surprise when she was the first volunteer to face the boggart, but it still raised a few gasps and whispers. </p><p>She strolled right up to the front of the room as professor Surely reminded the class of the charm to 'disarm' the 'hideous beast'. His smooth voice echo flawlessly as it intertwined with his crisp Scottish accent, " The Riddikulus charm is used to kept this beast at bay. It makes the creature take form of something the caster finds humorous, therefore distracting said person from the creatures frightening form. The wand motions to cast this brilliant spell is one that resembles a smile." He turned to draw a diagram on the chalkboard behind him as Hermione waited patiently by his desk, using her wand to write notes on the parchment paper that was sat on her desk next to Ron. Although the students already went over this exact lesson, Hermione refused to not take notes.</p><p>While the professor droned on, Draco took the time to study his features. He was a handsome bloke, more attractive than Lockhart Draco reckoned. He had a full head a nicely arranged hair that was a wondrous shade of honey brown, and his jaw was strong but soft. He also wore his robes in a dignified manner that made it look more appealing on him than any of the other professors. "- Now then, let us begin our demonstration. Keep in mind that each one of you will have to go against the boggart this week and I am prepared to postpone future lessons to make room for this one. Now, our lovely Miss Granger will be the first student this year to preform this spell for the Defense class, and seeing as she is a wondrous student please don't reframe from taking notes. In fact, I encourage it." He swiftly walked over to a cabinet, which stood at a menacing height. It had dark planked wood that mixed with dashes of blood red. It had sharp features that stuck out at absurd angles, making it look dangerous to just get close to it, and to top it off it was lined with black metal that caressed it's actuated design. </p><p>Professor Surly grasped the long, black handle and yanked the doors open, promptly releasing the boggart who immediately took shape of a scowling McGonagall holding up an O.W.L.S exam sheet that hosted an ugly 'T' marked in her paper thin handwriting. A flash of what seemed to be stress danced across Grangers face before she shook it off. Now with her determined expression, Granger swished her wand in the shape of a smile and dutifully said, " Riddikulus." Immediately, McGonagall turned into a cat with a witches hat and tutu. The cat was seated on a unicycle as it begun juggling balls of yarn. A smile inches it's way onto Grangers lips as the class broke out in laugher and congratulating hollers. Draco felt excited for Granger, but he knew his place so he turned his gaze to his fingers that twiddled with one another.</p><p>After Granger sat down, a couple of other students went. Most were seventh years so Draco would only glance up once in a while.</p><p>Some blonde Hufflepuff had Voldemort (not unlike many others) while a small, freckled boy had a terrifying clown. </p><p>The last kid of the class was Longbottom. As he approached the clown wearing a princess dress and crown, it transformed into a enormous snake that slithered up his legs. Right before the beast bit into the poor boy's thigh, he cast the spell. The snake fell to the floor, became a noodle and wiggled around. Longbottom certainly has changed from the scared, little boy he was in his youth to a real war hero. Yup, he was up the with the big dogs now (almost as well known as Potter...almost) Similar to Granger, everyone knew he feared something. </p><p>They both were human after all.</p><p>Although, you could hardly tell because he was so goddamn good at hiding it. Longbottom's smile was unlike anything Draco had seen before. Of course it's probably because he didn't care enough to pay it any mind before, but it was entrancing. He had two dimples that flashed on his cheeks as his pearly whites shined bright enough to blind a man.</p><p>Draco jerked his head back down to his parchment paper and finished sketching the snake that was there no less than a moment ago, scratching his quill against the paper in sharp, short lines. Draco was surprisingly a very talented artist, though he did not share his work. His notes were covered in doodles, all relating to the lesson naturally. </p><p>As Longbottom took his seat next to the Weaslet, professor Surly began cursing the boggart back into the cabinet while talking. " So, as you can see. Not only does this 'experiment' help with defense, but it also helps with self confidence which is a major tool in defense itself. The more confident one is in their decision, the more affective the spell will be. Before I dismiss you all, I want you lot to remember that each and every one of you will be required to face to boggart some time this week. It does count as a grade, but whether or not you are able to disarm the boggart is not how I'm grading. Now for tonight's work I want you to either write about the first boggart encounter or the discovery of the Riddikulus charm in three paragraphs. That will be due at the end of the week. Dismissed! Enjoy the rest of your day!"</p><p>As Draco began to collect his things and neatly place them in his leather bag, he saw Potter walk up to the professor from the corner of his eye. " So professor, I was thinking. Do I have to go against the boggart and all? Considering what I've done in the past year or so?" Draco noted that Potter didn't out right say 'because I defeated Voldemort', but still was trying to use that as an excuse to not do his class work. </p><p>Draco frowned at himself. <em>Of course he's allowed to use that excuse! He's Harry Freaking Potter! Savior of the wizarding world! The Golden Boy, perfect child! And me? I'm nobody, just a Death Eater who didn't have the guts...</em>

</p><p>Draco ears perked up at the professors response, " No. I understand that we all are in a great debt to you for your services, but you cannot go around excusing your self from things that inconvenience you. Work is work, and I expect <em>everyone</em> to complete this assignment. Including you, Mr. Potter. If you would like to consult me privately with complaints, I would suggest doing it after teaching hours so I can give you my full attention. Have a nice day." And with that, the man grabbed his wand and headed to the Great Hall off to steal a few treats from the kitchen no doubt. He has a little pastry almost every class Draco sees him.</p><p>Potter turned around noticing that Draco was still in the room. He gave a curt smile that was accompanied with a calculated nod and went to gather his own things. Finally Draco set off, satchel at his side, headed to his next class.</p>
