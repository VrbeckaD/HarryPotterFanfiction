    <p>Potters sometimes inherit unfortunate names. Still, things could be worse, Harrie thinks; she could be a Dursley. Let it not be said that Henrietta Lily Potter, daughter of James Fleamont Potter, granddaughter of Fleamont Henry Potter, for whom she is named, is a complainer. At least, not in earshot of her beloved and loving parents, who are only too happy to loudly recount the ‘thrilling’ tale of how James had one gotten into a fistfight in order to defend ‘his family’s noble name’ and accidently met Harrie’s mother.</p><p>There is little she can do in those situations but groan, bury her face in her hands, and mutter than at least she hadn’t pretended her middle name was Lancelot. But because her mum and dad are only doing it because it annoys her they come down with a temporary case of deafness. It’s the sort that sometimes afflicts Hermione’s parents, too. Harrie cannot be sure that Ron’s parents aren’t actually a little deaf – not after raising seven children, three of whom are Actual Terrors.</p><p>But because she is in Santorini and thus far, far away from her mum and dad, Harrie can complain however much she damn pleases, which is more than usual, more than is polite, but she’s a bottle of wine and three tequila shots in so who the fuck cares.</p><p>Not Pavarti or Lavender, that’s for fucking sure. She’s pretty sure they started making out with each other, cutting through some sexual tension she’s been pretty much oblivious to, but as happy as she guesses she is, she’s mostly a little pissed that she has no idea where they are, or when they’re going back to their resort.</p><p>She curves around dancers and takes a breather in the queue for the ladies – it’s late enough that half of the stalls have probably been ruined with someone’s sick by now. She hums and sways.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Some minutes later she’s back in front of the bar and too sloshed to give a damn about relatability. Her parents taught her better but goddamn if she’ll be drinking bottom shelf liquor at this point. Her godfather, at least, would be proud. Proudish. Probably.</p><p>The fucker who apparently needs to make sure his drink order is just so is taking too long, some tall dark bastard in a fancy suit. (It’s damn sure not Topshop.)</p><p>And, you know, excuse her if she sighs and taps her foot a little. And rolls her eyes when he turns around slowly to meet her impatience with an expressionless expression meant to convey how unamused or what the fuck ever and so she says</p><p>“Hi,” cool as you please and he asks</p><p>“Am I keeping you from something, miss?” and curls his lip just so. It’s too full for that face – too sensual. Luna’s an artist. She’s allowed to think shit like that. Harrie isn’t.</p><p>“My drink, probably” she says. “It’s that time of night – morning.”</p><p>The bartender looks a little ill, and glances between them as though they’re going to brawl or something stupid like that. Honestly.</p><p>Her confrontational suit narrows his eyes at her and speaks Greek (modern – not her sort) to the bartender and walks away without so much as a backwards glance at her.</p><p>Pity - she’s in a mood. Harrie’s too emotionally stable to date assholes but she’s not above sleeping with one on a Greek island.</p><p>“Hendricks, please” she says, “with only a little tonic water and” she stands on her tiptoes and braces herself on the counter to glance behind the bar, “um, three orange slices please.”</p><p>She makes a point of accepting it without complaint an in exchange for twenty euro, no change, thanks.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>After fishing out another twenty euro from her bra to pay the cab driver, Harrie stumbles into the lobby and takes off her shoes on the way to the elevator. A large, pale hand catches the door and it opens automatically. And who is it but her rude friend from Taboo?</p><p>She straightens so that when he arches a brow in her direction she looks at least a bit less sloshed than she is. She’s sobering up anyway – downside of a fantastic metabolism.</p><p>And because she’s not totally immature she keeps her mouth shut and scoots over. He glances at the list of buttons and inserts his keycard before pressing the button for the ‘executive floor’. Because of course.</p><p>It’s fine though, she doesn’t say anything. Until they start moving and he asks</p><p>“And did you get your drink, then?”</p><p>She turns to face him – and can’t quite read his expression.</p><p>“I did,” she allows. Waits a beat.</p><p>“If you’re looking for an apology,” she adds, “you’re going to be disappointed.”</p><p>He raises his eyebrows in surprise but gives a laugh at this.</p><p>“Not to worry” he says, “I’ve encountered enough stupidity today that the antics of a gap-year girl fail to rate.”</p><p>“I’m twenty-three,” she retorts, “and I never bothered with one anyway.”</p><p>“Chasing your wasted youth, then?” he suggests, as they stop on her floor.</p><p>“Don’t confuse our motives,” she says, sweet as can be.</p><p>He holds the elevator door for her as she steps off.</p><p>“Not a chance of that,” he promises. She turns back to look at him, secretly glad for the excuse. He regards her from under heavy-lidded eyes.</p><p>“What’s your name?” he asks, casual as can be.</p><p>“Why do you want to know?” she asks.</p><p>“Humour me,” he says, smiling, “and I’ll tell you.”</p><p>“Harrie,” she says. And when he raises a brow, she feels compelled to explain, though she usually just ignores people’s surprise. “It’s short for Henrietta.”</p><p>“Well, it suits you better, certainly,” he allows, still smiling. They pause. She wants to ask him why he asked for her name, but if he doesn’t answer it’s only going to make her feel stupid.</p><p>“And you are?”</p><p>“Tom, Tom Riddle.”</p><p>She narrows her eyes at him, allowing herself the full experience of that handsome face. The cheekbones, the lips, the cool blue eyes. She wavers.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>He’s kissing her neck and palming her breasts and it’s good, really good, and she’s sighing and fumbling with his buttons but something is just a little off, and she glances down at him, his mouth on her skin, moist and hot and his eyes half closed and it takes her a minute and some embarrassment and then she shoves at his shoulders (surprisingly solid) and half-snarls in frustration and disgust.</p><p>“You’re not even into this.”</p><p>He looks at her in surprise.</p><p>“What – no,” he denies, he lies, and he must see that she sees because he lapses into something approximating exasperation. She shoves him onto his back (he lets her – she’s not a fool) but he grabs her wrist before she can push off him entirely and he’s hard and a little less polished.</p><p>“You’re bored,” she accuses him, tugging her wrist away.</p><p>“Not now,” he tells her, eyeing her chest and rolling up to her face. Whatever her face shows he seems to watch avidly, greedily even, but he’s already killed her mood at least.</p><p>“Um,” she says, articulate, tugging her wrist away. His hand tightens and for just a second she is afraid and she shivers. Her nipples peak, because of course they do.</p><p>“Harrie,” he coaxes, voice low and intimate, and a little rough. He runs a hand up her thigh and it flexes on her hip</p><p>“Tom,” she mimics, half spitting his name. His mouth twists, and then the rest of his face follows. It is the only lush part of it, she thinks, the only soft bit, no sweet, full cheeks or plump places to soften that hard and sculpted thing, just the lips. He’s too pretty, she tells herself. She doesn’t like pretty boys. (She doesn’t like the Draco Malfoys or Blaise Zabinis of this world – this boy – man – she does like – at least physically).</p><p>He’s hungry now and she absolutely shudders, melts, is suddenly, horrifyingly wet when he lunges up and breathes into her neck again and rolls his hips against hers.</p><p>“Clever thing,” he mutters against her. He slaps her ass, lightly (she yelps) rolls her under him his left hand squeezing her right hip tight enough to hurt, rolling against her again, more sharply. She gasps.</p><p>It ends up being the best sex she’s ever had.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>The next morning she wakes earlier than she might have otherwise in an empty bed. As she blinks, slowly, she recalls the night before. Her mouth is dry.</p><p>She can hear the sink running in the bathroom. He was courteous enough to have kept the lights off and the blinds closed, but even so, the bright Mediterranean sun is creeping in from behind the heavy fabric. Harrie shivers, feeling a little dirty, but deliciously well-done.</p><p>Her phone had been in her bra and it ended up… on the floor. She’s feeling too lazy to get out of bed so she reaches for it awkwardly, which is of course when the door opens and she has to raise a hand to shield her eyes. Tom is silhouetted in the doorway, and waits a moment before responding to her artificially casual ‘morning’.</p><p>“Well, hello,” he says. It almost sounds like an innuendo.</p><p>She waits a beat, and then reaches again for her phone. Tries not to react when the sheet slips down and reveals her breasts. And then she sees that she has seventeen percent battery left, 4 missed calls from Parvati and remembers that she never let her or Lavender know where she went.</p><p>“Fuck,” she mutters, swiping it open.</p><p>“Something wrong?” he says, unconcerned.</p><p>“Just missed calls from my friend,” she tells him, typing out a message, and trying to control her flush. He isn’t wearing any clothes, any pants, and he’s walking closer.</p><p><strong>Soz!! Went home with a guy in the same hotel, up on top floor back in a bit. </strong>She hits send and checks the call log – all from the morning, to her relief.</p><p>“Hmm, I didn’t see you with anyone,” he says, sounding puzzled. She looks up at his face. You could hardly even tell that he hadn’t slept for more than a few hours.</p><p>“She and, um, my friend Lavender ended up getting together earlier on,” Harrie tells him.</p><p>He doesn’t make any sort of comment, and she likes that, and likes it even more when he leans down over her and puts his mint-clean mouth just above hers and mutters</p><p>“So they won’t mind if I keep you for another few hours, then.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>The sex is even better in the morning even if she’s actually quite sore by the end of it and he orders them a carafe of coffee and room service after, which they eat on his balcony wearing nothing but the hotel robes.</p><p>It’s all very indulgent, and especially nice because a small part of her expected him to kick her out of bed first thing in the morning. It’s fucking rude and it’s never happened to her yet but she thinks it would be embarrassing and hurtful all the same.</p><p>They talk idly, and she relaxes in his presence, loosening up like a cat in the sun. He’s here on business, but extended his stay to enjoy a bit of the summer. He doesn’t look older than thirty so she can’t imagine he’s climbed the corporate ladder. She doesn’t ask him what he does (she was raised better than that) but she speculates that he must have founded or inherited his own company.</p><p>“I’m a fifth year med student,” she explains, when asked. “Just on a holiday for the summer - after the last round of exams I needed the break.”</p><p>“And how long is that break going to last,” he asks, running his eyes over her. She shivers.</p><p>“A while,” she allows. “I only arrived two days ago and mmm,” he’s got a hand tangled up in her hair, wilder than ever after multiple bouts of enthusiastic sex, “my flight doesn’t leave for another week and a half or so.”</p><p>“Good,” he says, and she imagines she can hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>“Now, how do you feel about boating?” he asks. She cranes her neck back to look at him.</p><p>“I like it well enough,” she allows.</p><p>“A ringing endorsement, that.”</p><p>Harrie glances down again, “too much time spent with overenthusiastic, under-cautious friends,” she fibs. Fred and George might be maniacs but she doesn’t really regret the ridiculous voyage out to New Grimsby during one of their joint family holidays.</p><p>“If it’s any consolation,” he says, amused, “I won’t be sailing it myself. I’ve got a captain for that.”</p><p>Of course he’s got a fucking yacht, she thinks.  But then his mouth is on hers, and she decides she doesn’t care. She deserves to be a bit of a hedonist, and whatever he is doing to her definitely applies.  </p><p>It’s her justification when she agrees to meet him for dinner, and when she decides to wear silky, pretty thing that’s less casual than her usual attire. It’s what she tells herself when he greets her in a white shirt and dark trousers, looking like something out of a glamorous 50s movie, and when she accepts a flute of what she recognizes as very good champagne after they begin the short sail over.</p><p>It’s a summer fling, she tells herself, as he drapes himself around her back, deliciously close. What harm could it do?</p>
