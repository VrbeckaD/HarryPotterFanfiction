    <p>When Harry woke again the sun was beginning it’s fall toward the westward horizon. As he exited the cave mouth and looked out his eye was caught by the Thames, wending its way back inland.</p>
<p>“The Thames flows right through London.” Harry murmured, hope beginning to light in his eyes, “And I don’t seem to have any problems with breathing underwater.” He sent the tangle of <em> hope, can do this, will be okay, relief </em> down the bond, and received a burst of <em> curiousity </em> back. Harry smiled as he relayed his plan to his companion as best he could.</p>
<p>As he stepped back into the cave mouth his gaze fell on Dumbledore’s body and his emotion fell back to despair. He might survive the long swim back into London, but the Professor wouldn’t. <em> Concern, can help, </em> <em> will </em> <em> help </em>the feelings pulsing down the bond bolstered Harry. Dumbledore had said before they’d come here that because of vast scale of the Dark Magicks Voldemort cast on this place the Ministry trackers couldn’t recognise it, so he could use magic, even if only within the boundaries of the cavern.</p>
<p>He knelt by the Headmaster’s body, wand out, when he noticed a subtle shimmer in the air around Dumbledore’s form. Reaching a cautious hand out to touch he he watched it ripple under his fingers. “Specialis Revelio.” The bright flash of runic designs confirmed his suspicion that it was a ward - listening to Hermione prattle on about her classes was good for something it seemed.</p>
<p>“The ward let me through before, I wonder what it blocks.” Harry muttered as he rose. Brow furrowed in confusion, he walked to the cave mouth and picked up a handful of gritty sand. Crouching near Dumbledore’s feet he let it fall between his fingers, and watched as it trickled harmlessly down a curving barrier.</p>
<p>“Well, if it works on sand, let’s see if it will work on water.” Harry rushed down to the water’s edge, lifting a double handful of water out of the sea. Hoping he hadn’t been seen, he disappeared back into the cave mouth, he let the water splash over Dumbledore’s body. Like the sand, it hit a barrier and slid harmlessly to the ground.</p>
<p>Harry sent a quick burst down the emotional bond, <em> journey, swim, long time, large water, outside, </em>  and quickly received a clamouring reply. It seemed his companion had passed on his plan to the rest of the creatures in the lake. <em> Danger, will come, together, safe then, </em> “It’s seems we’ll have a swarm to shadow us on our journey.” Harry told the sky, laughing as he felt the <em> self satisfaction, gratitude, you’ll see, </em> <em> useful </em>.</p>
<p>It was surprisingly uncomplicated to transfer a small army of symbiotes from the lake in the cave to the sea outside. By the time the sun was beginning to dip below the horizon Harry was ready to begin the long journey into London.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The water of the Thames was murky, clouded with mud and sand. It was also full of detritus and debris - a lot a which was man made. Harry watched with amusement as the snake-like creatures took turns watching over him and Dumbledore’s body and prodding and poking at everything they could see.</p>
<p>The relayed <em> curiosity </em> and <em> wonder </em> that resonated through the bond was plain in their behaviour. ‘They probably haven’t ever left the cave.’ Harry thought, they knew of waters outside the one they inhabited, but their wariness of it showed their ignorance.</p>
<p>The contingent that corralled Dumbledore’s body were hypervigilant, hissing at anything that came into sight - even their own kind. They traded off one by one, always making sure that any weakness in the perimetre they had created was a short lived as possible</p>
