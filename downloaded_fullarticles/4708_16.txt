    <p>Hermione walked quickly through the store, trying her best to keep up with Draco, who couldn't seem to get to the Halloween aisles fast enough.</p><p>"Draco, where's the fire?" </p><p>"I believe the fire was in our bed last night, love," he tossed over his shoulder with a wink.</p><p>Hermione blushed furiously. "Why don't you say that a little louder, I don't think the whole store heard you!" </p><p>Draco laughed and entered the costume isle and immediately started browsing through the options.</p><p>"Just what is it you're looking for anyway?" Hermione asked when she finally managed to catch up with him.</p><p>"A costume," Draco answered with a smirk. Seriously, 'Mione, I'd thought you, Little Miss Mensa, would be able to figure that out."</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes at her smartarse husband and answered, "What kind of costume?"</p><p>"One you wear. Seriously, 'Mione, I think you're losing it."</p><p>"The only thing I'm losing is my patience," Hermione muttered. </p><p>Draco was too busy sorting through costumes to hear her. He pulled a ship captain uniform off the rack and held it up for her approval.</p><p>"What do think? Does this float your boat?"</p><p>Hermione bit back a groan at Draco's corny sense of humor and said, "I thought we were going to do a couples costume."</p><p>"You could go as my First Mate," he suggested. He handed her a sexy two-piece sailor outfit. "You could model this for me. There's a dressing room right over there.</p><p>Hermione pulled Draco towards her with one arm and kissed him soundly on the lips while taking the costume from him and put it back on the rack.</p><p>"I don't think so. Try again."</p><p>Undeterred by her objection, Draco continued looking and it wasn't long before he found another costume he liked.</p><p>"How about this one?" He held up a police officer's uniform for her inspection. "And look, it even comes with handcuffs!"</p><p>Draco put his hand on the small of Hermione's back and tried to guide her out of the aisle.</p><p>"Now, Mrs. Malfoy, I think we can find you something suitable in the lingerie department."</p><p>Hermione stopped walking. Draco tried to push her along, but she wouldn't budge.</p><p>"Is something wrong?" Draco asked.</p><p>"You've picked out our costumes for the last two years in a row. I think it's only right that I should get a turn."</p><p>"But..." Draco started to protest.</p><p>Before he could continue, Hermione silenced him with a kiss. She took the uniform and put it back on the rack. </p><p>"But what are you gonna pick out?"</p><p>"You'll see,"she answered with a smile.</p><p>It wasn't long  before Hermione returned with two costume bags. She handed one to Draco and laughed at his crestfallen expression.</p><p>"Raggedy Andy? Really? Out of all the costumes, you choose Raggedy Andy?" Draco complained.</p><p>"Yes." She stood on tiptoe and whispered in his ear, "If you're good, you'll get a treat later."  She kissed his cheek and walked away.</p><p>Maybe this won't be so bad after all.</p>
