    <p>Harry James Potter was twenty eight when the world ended. </p>
<p>No one knew how it had begun. Maybe it had been a terrorist attack gone wrong. Maybe it had been a lab experiment gone off the leash. Maybe it was just God and Nature deciding Humanity had ruled too long.</p>
<p>One thing was certain thought, the world ended. Humanity ended, and the Dead rose to claim it for themselves. </p>
<p>Magic is a wonderful power. It can make the impossible, possible. It can hide an entire world, a culture and all it inhabitants, just under the noses of the entire world. Magic made them strong, it made them unique, and it made them uniquely vulnerable to a muggle born plague. </p>
<p>Harry had started his early twenties training to be an auror. It had been his dream, his calling when he had been a teenager. After the War, everyone looked to him to be the Warrior, a leader to bring peace and make sure the evil of the world stayed in the shadows. Harry had applied, and trained, and after he'd finished his training, Harry declined a position on in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. <br/>Harry had spent most of his childhood under the cruel thumb of his uncle, and the rest under the watchful eye of his headmaster and nemesis, Voldemort. He had spent his life, since the death of his parents, preparing for the moment to defeat Voldemort. The wizarding world was free to grow into this new golden age of peace, and so was Harry. He would do what he wanted and fighting for a fickle people was not one of them. </p>
<p>Ginny Weasley was not impressed when he dropped out of Law Enforcement and switched to Interning at St. Mungo's. Arguments started, insults were thrown, and Harry decided dating someone who believed him to be a 'Spineless coward who lost his balls' to be an unwise decision. Ginny obviously was in love with his image of 'Hero' and not who Harry really was. </p>
<p>Harry wasn't too surprised when the Weasley's sided with Ginny, and by extension Hermione followed with her new husband. Turning their backs on him had hurt fiercely but Harry was hopeful they would come around. Learning to Heal people, to fix the damage caused by evil or accidents, appealed to Harry more then hunting down dark wizards. More then catching petty criminals. Harry always did have a saving people thing, and how could he save people more then healing them? </p>
<p>St. Mungo's is where Harry first saw the results of the end of the world. Fatalities were rare with Magical Medicine, but they did happen. A splinch cutting a heart in half here, an avada kedavra there, but magical deaths were nothing compared to the muggle population. </p>
<p>The first couple were treated like they were sick, isolated and re-evaluated. Perhaps they'd missed something the first time, diagnostic spells done wrong, for this seemingly dead person to reawaken. After a while, when even an avada kedavra victim rose from morgue, St. Mungo's treated them like inferi. Scorched Earth Policy. Every body was immediately incinerated. </p>
<p>At first, this seemed to stop the rising dead. Until the reports from the rest of the world came in. This wasn't just an isolated incident at St. Mungo's. It wasn't even just isolated in the United Kingdom. Everywhere, anywhere, in the world, The Dead Rose. Muggles were already becoming overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Governments were panicking, riots grew in major cities, large population areas were already starting to become swarmed with the dead. Society was breaking down and countermeasures were not working. How do you combat the fact that dying no longer meant the same thing? </p>
<p>The first priority of St. Mungo's was a cure. Capturing an infected individual was easy enough. Man power was put exclusively towards research while Interns and newer staff picked up the slack of patients. Harry had never worked such long hours and handled so any desperate and sick people. Bite wounds became a death sentence and his heart grew heavier and heavier the more he saw come in. People knew it was hopeless, but desperation and pain drove them. </p>
<p>Harry's heart broke even more when Ron and Hermione came in, the former covered in blood and cradling an arm, the latter seeking him out with desperate and hopeful eyes. It was a bite wound. Any and all Aurors had been called in to disrupt riots and try to instill order on the panicking population. This made it easy for the infected to hide in a crowd, for the condition to spread. Who could tell a screaming, panicking civilian from a moaning infected moving the same direction? </p>
<p>Hermione had a toddler at the Weasley home, a family to protect. Harry made sure she'd leave to take care of her family. Ron would be his responsibility. His old friend was feverish by the time he'd come in, happy to be healed by anyone, even Harry. </p>
<p>Harry made his friend comfortable, eased his pain and sent to him rest. Then, he avada kedavraed his first friend he ever made. The body was burning within the hour. It was the most heart wrenching, and eye opening, thing He'd ever done. This disease, this horror, was too wide spread. It wouldn't be long before even the most fortified places were over run. With the day, Diagon Alley was over run by muggles. No anti-muggle ward could keep the dead out, for they no longer saw with their eyes. They hunted by sound, by smell, and they were coming. </p>
<p>Many fled to Hogwarts. With its stone walls and rough terrain many could live without even touching an infected. It would have been the perfect place to hole up, if everyone inside remained peaceful and uninfected. Old hatreds bred fights, which bred injury and death, and Hogwarts fell from the inside. Children could not fight their parents and parents could not bare to harm their children. Magical Britain was doomed to die. </p>
<p>Harry never made it to Hogwarts. St. Mungo's did not last long enough to find a cure. It was too open, too vulnerable to attack. It was a hospital, not a fortress. He knew about muggle technology, about radio and cellphone and communication lines. Safe zones were being set up by the muggle military. Rumours were spreading about who had a cure, the name European Center for Disease Control was said many times. Some had flocked to the area in Sweden, hoping for sanctuary or a cure. It did not take long for the relatively new building to be over run. </p>
<p>Harry had high hopes for a cure, already on the run from the infected. Apparation was useful, though some had appeared in a supposed safe room and instead found it fulled with the Dead. His first stop was his home. Not even the dead could find a house protected under the Fidelius. A bottomless bag was quickly filled with anything he could need. Cookware, knives, spices and any nonperishable foods. Conjuring was nice and all but the food had very little nutritional value compared to the real thing. It would be as if eating air. </p>
<p>Anything that could be a weapon was taken. Guns were rare for the UK, let alone the magical world. A wand was a weapon in is own right, but easily lost and was no shield to the dead. Harry grabbed his old Auror kit, the heavy duty leather armor and dragon hide cloak would protect from the biting jaws of the Dead. </p>
<p>Harry did not dare try to apparate into an unknown area. Instead, he bundles up under the invisibility cloak and mounts his broom, unsure if the ECDC had any answers or if it would just lead to disappointment. His family.. His Friends.. He could only help them by finding a way to end this crisis. They could protect themselves, they were admirable fighters. </p>
<p>It turned out that the ECDC was a bust. </p>
<p>Even if the facility was still functional, the power had cut off and the area was swarming with the Dead. Military hadn't held out for long, the sheer amount of Dead overwhelming them. Flights were grounded, traffic clogged the streets, only the fact that Harry was atop a flying broomstick saved him from the Anarchy below. </p>
<p>Harry knew of another CDC, the one in The United States of America, but it would take a miracle to get there or maybe a touch of luck. Flying would take too long. Even if he could make it across on his broomstick, one oceanic storm and he'd be fish food. No, his only way there would have to be by boat. Finding one would be the hard part. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, it didn't take as long as he thought. Many more people had the same idea as him, plus the coast was covered with military craft. It was easy to slip on board in the chaos and, after proving his worth by healing some people with potions played off as medicine, he easily gained passage across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>It took longer then Harry anticipated to get to USA, there as some debate on what their destination should be, but eventually Harry convinced them to get as close to the coastline as they were comfortable with and let him off. He'd spun a story of finding his family in Atlanta, needing a ride across the ocean. Radio was already down, as well as cell reception. The ship was reluctant to let their 'Doctor' go but most understood his need. Many were foreign, trying to get back to home countries.  </p>
<p>Harry ended up in a place called Port Royal. He wasn't entirely up to speed on the map of USA and was relying heavily on the point me spell. Thankfully resources were still plentiful. The broomstick he carried with him was a godsend. Harry landed on the roofs of building that looked clear, looted the top floor, then moved on. Some buildings held the Dead but for the most part he was in and out before they realized he was there. </p>
<p>A quick point me spell and he was off flying over the country side. He found it easier keeping on track to follow roads. Lone cars were pit stops, keeping himself safe while he ate and gained a break from flying. Some had supplies in them, hunting gear and some bullets in one, adding to his bag. So far Harry had very little contact with the Dead. Avoidance was easier then a head to head confrontation. </p>
<p>Following a road labelled 278 lead him to a city called Augusta. Traffic on the multi-lane roads increased the closer he got, as well as the number of the infected. There was some high rising buildings in the distance, Harry currently flying over a residential zone. There were some very beautiful mansions and homes in the area, or, at least the ones that were left. Some seemed of have burned down, been used as shelters and been over run, or just neglected over time long before now. </p>
<p>Harry found a place to stay for the night, not wanting to travel in the dark. With no street lights or cars the street were black veins in dark forests, impossible to follow from the air with any confidence. Settling into a bedroom that looked like it used to belong to a little girl, Harry set up trap lines and settled into a blanket nest for a warm night. After scavenging more supplies from the surrounding houses, keeping away from the crowded city center, Harry continued his journey west. </p>
<p>Route 20 out of Augusta lead towards the direction his wand showed him. The multi-lane highway was littered with cars and the Dead. Many trucks were food trailers, which Harry quickly looted when he could, and many others offered sanctuary from the dead for a moment. A trailer carrying cars for some sort of dealership offered a dry place to stay when the rain started. It was boxed in between two other trucks, safe from tipping over. </p>
<p>The trip brought him close to the city Atlanta. Already he could see the city had fallen as well, despite the signs along the way stating that it was being turned into a safe zone. An end to end build up of vehicles were stalled moving away from the city while the road going in was clear. Harry didn't dare land anywhere, safe from prying eyes beneath his cloak, hovering over the dead city. A point me spell directed him north, moving close to the center of the city. </p>
<p>Flying over the high rise building, he kept a close eye for any clear buildings he may be able to loot, when he spotted a curious sight. There were a group of people on the roof, which wasn't that unusual, but they weren't moving like the dead. Hovering closer, remaining quiet, he saw that they were using tools and binoculars. One of them was hand cuffed to a pipe system in the center. </p>
<p>They were alive. The first he'd seen since leaving the ship. It gave him hope, maybe there would be people left when he finally found a cure. If he could fine one.</p>
