    <p>Draco didn't smoke. It was vulgar. </p><p>Or at least Draco didn't smoke until March, because it had been vulgar, previously, until March. </p><p>Released from his parents hold unexpectedly, he'd spiralled. Quite dramatically, too, if he might add. His mother had begged for him to come with them, of course, as soon as his father came out of Azkaban. He'd stoutly refused the offer. Even a portkey to France would be too much time trapped in a small space with Lucius these days. </p><p>For the most part, he was thankful to have the manor to himself. The only thing that had really changed was the House Elf Tax, but he had enough money to cover that. Provided he pretended to shake Potter's hand in solidarity - discretely washing it quite vigorously afterwards - and as long as he didn't overdo it at Ministry functions.</p><p>It was barely work. For all Potter grumbled though, it was as though he was doing a life sentence - and it wasn't him who had to cobble together retribution speeches for a stadium-wide audience at arse o' clock in the morning. </p><p>The House Elf Tax was one thing. What Draco never had enough money for, however, were friends. Not for lack of trying, but people just didn't want to associate with the Malfoy name when it was anywhere outside of Saint Potters personal interest. </p><p>He lit another cigarette, having barely let the first drop to the pavement as he ground the butt in with his heel, grimacing at the ash residue the wind insisted on imparting up the back of his shoe. </p><p>Not halfway through the second cigarette he started shivering. Smoke curled around his nostrils like dragons breath and it was only halfway between him trying to wrap his left hand around the tiny orange ember of fire that he realised he didn't actually have to stand outside in the draughty doorway of The Blind Phoenix. </p><hr/><p>There was an actual cigarette bin, Merlin knows why, on the inside porch. Draco busied himself with halfheartedly rubbing the back of his white (now grey) heel with his cloak, before giving up and dropping the cloak on top of someone else's on the only available hook. </p><p>Purple drapes hung just inside the second door, trying - and failing spectacularly - to give some modicum of privacy. Draco almost snorted. The Phoenix was known for a lot of things but it was definitely not their privacy.</p><p>He supposed some clubs used a modified fidellius charm, but they were reserved for the elite, so he wouldn't know anything about that. He supposed his parents might. He instantly wrinkled his nose at the idea of Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy sharing a bottle of Odgen's finest and complaining about the poor service despite having the best seat in the house. </p><p>The thought wasn't quite a memory. It was a warped version of what used to happen at restaurants. And balls. And weddings. He decided it was probably safer to start retching after he'd consumed some alcohol, instead of before. It was far too soon in the night for all that, regardless of how dark the club was. </p><p>He got the headache on the way to the bar. </p><p>Bass thrummed under his feet and up through his bones whilst glaring white strobe-lights blinked in and out of focus overhead. Draco assumed they were supposed to mimic some sort of shooting star but he couldn't tell, and he wasn't about to risk his perfectly good eyesight in order to find out. </p><p>"Maybe if I looked more like sodding Harry Potter the general public would like me better." He mumbled, slipping, quite literally into a bar stool. He was about to put his fingers up to request a drink when he felt someone shift into the seat beside him. </p><p>"Sorry." The voice strained over the sound of the music. "Did you say Harry Potter?" </p><p>"Oh for Sala-" Draco caught himself. No-one spoke to him outside of Potter's stupid charity fundraisers and speeches, he might as well bandy the bloke's name around for some purpose. "Yes, I did." </p><p>Draco turned to look at the man. Dark stubble grazed his jaw and his hair tickled at his neckline, where his shirt was. Draco studied the strands for a lingering moment before dragging his eyes up to the strangers face. </p><p>No glasses, he noted. </p><p>"You don't look like you're too fond of him, or me." The man laughed a little as Draco fought to school his features into something other than a frown. "Would you like a drink?"</p><p>Draco stared longingly at the shelves lined with single malt whisky and rich red wine. "Vodka. Please." </p><p>The man nodded understandingly and Draco looked away while he shuffled through his trouser pocket for his wallet, just in case. </p><p>"No need. Trey will put it on my tab." Oh. So he was arrogant too, just Draco's luck, someone who looked like Potter and acted like him. </p><p>It was infuriating how the man smiled with such ease. No one smiled like that after the war, not even Potter, regardless of his blase attitude. Draco bit his tongue instead, just for something to do. He'd been doing it a lot lately.</p><p>Draco took a long swig of his vodka almost as soon as it was put down on the beer mat. He pretended with all the aloofness of an angry swan that his sleeve wasn't dampening from the small puddle of un-mopped alcohol that had spilled onto the beer mat. Especially as he was ninety percent sure he hadn't spilled his own drink yet. </p><p>The man held out his hand. "I'm Lark." </p><hr/><p>Everything was fuzzy around the edges, if he squinted a bit he could almost, almost pretend Lark actually did wear glasses after all. </p><p>"Draco? Are you alright?" </p><p>Draco took another sip of his drink (the vodka had been replaced with something a lot more fruity and a lot more alcoholic over the course of the hour), forcing himself to behave as not-Harry bent towards him. </p><p>Draco waved him off. "Yes, yes. I'm fine." </p><p>"Oh, well. In that case, if you're up for it, you could come back to mine later?"</p><p>"Nonsense. The manors bigger." </p><p>"Oh." Lark went from looking shocked to bemused in the span of about ten seconds. "Oh!" Draco wondered, for the first time, how old he was. "Yeah, I'll- I'll do that then. Can I nip off to the Potions Room first though?"</p><p>The Potions Room was a small room off to their left, embossed with a black nameplate bearing the same name. Draco had hardly glanced at it, purposely sitting as far away from the place as humanly possible. </p><p>"Of course." Draco waved him away with a flourish of his hand. The man could do what he liked, he was the one who'd been throwing around his sickles all evening. </p><p>A splash of purple liquid fell onto Draco's shoe as he spun one hundred and eighty degrees in the bar stool to watch his companion leave. </p><p>Yes, he was definitely more appealing from behind. </p><hr/><p>"Someone's getting married."</p><p>"Huh?" Lark looped his arm around Draco as they pushed their way through the door, the warmth evaporating as soon as the heat and smoke was locked safely back inside the Pheonix.</p><p>Draco jerked his head in the direction of the newspaper that had been pasted onto a bulletin board with a poorly applied sticking charm. "In the prophet. Do you reckon we should?"</p><p>"Get married?" Lark quirked an eyebrow in Draco's direction but didn't oppose him.</p><p>"Yeah, why not?" Draco felt a flash of heat tingle down his spine as he lent into Lark, angling his body away from the wind. </p><p>"You're cute when you're drunk. I'll think about it in the morning when I'm... not." Lark bubbled, the laughter bursting out of him as they stumbled around the corner, the nearest multi-location Portkey emitting a familiar faint blue light. Above it probably read the words "Don't Drink &amp; Splinch!" But everything was spinning, so Draco couldn't really tell.</p><hr/><p>Weak sunlight didn't so much stream through the window as it did jump. By Draco's body clock, it was dark and then it wasn't, there hadn't been an early morning in between any of it. A weight shifted in the bed that certainly wasn't him and he almost yelled. </p><p>Instead, he turned over, carefully, steadying his breathing as he watched long, dark hair shift against his pillow. </p><p>Draco shut his eyes, trying to refocus the wavering images he'd managed to dredge up from last night... and if the hair was anything to go by..</p><p>"Morning, Potter." Draco mumbled, deciding it was probably best to hide his blush in the bed sheets if the man ever bloody woke.</p><p>"Hah. No chance." </p><p>Shit. Not Potter then.</p><p>Who was he? He had a stupid name. Was it a tree? Or a flower?</p><p>"You've also got a stupid name, for the record." God, Draco needed to learn to shut up. "I also don't plan on marrying you."</p><p>"Marrying me what the-" Draco cut himself off as he spied the clothes he'd kicked off earlier in the night. Apart from them being all over his room, a lone shoe sat snuggled in the corner. A lone shoe with a big, purple stain on the upper part of his shoe. </p><p>"I'd better be going anyway-" Draco was about to ask for the man-who-certainly-was-not-Potter's age, but before he could he was cut off by his voice - clearly he hadn't finished his little goodbye speech "-I'd better be getting back to the Mrs."</p><p>Granted. Not the best situation he could have gotten himself into. At least he was of age. Draco shivered, retching over the side of the bed once before zeroing in on the carpet. </p><p>It was pink.</p><p>This was his parents room. His parents bed. </p><p>Fuck.</p>
