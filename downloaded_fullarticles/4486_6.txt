    <p>Long before the menace known as the darkest wizard in history was finally killed by a boy of seventeen years, the shadows had been stirring.<br/>
</p><p>Ignored by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, who sought out allies in greedy, corrupt wizards and giants and dementors, they had bidden their time, waiting for the perfect moment to fully awaken and invade the world of the living.<br/>
</p><p>Little did they know that their awakening would be brought about during the time of a new generation of wizards, one who would be their bane and enemy. Yet when sacred blood had finally spilled, and the enchantments binding them and restraining their powers, it seemed like the time of the shadow creatures had finally come about.<br/>
</p><p>We will strike the weak first, and make our way to the strong. We will corrupt the innocent, and possess the good. The time of reckoning has come…<br/>
</p><p>Ω<br/>
</p><p>“Are you sure?” was the only thing the shadowed blond man could say.<br/>
</p><p>There were no other words, no other thoughts. Just pure shock, disbelief, and uncertainty. This couldn’t possibly be happening, could it? It was impossible. Preposterous. Especially about the location! No, there was nothing really to say. Not when you were an unmarried, single bitter man who had never really known love or family, and just found out that you had a long-lost son who lived in the East End of London.<br/>
</p><p>“Of course, sir. We would not have brought you here all this way if there was but a shadow of a doubt. Read the letter yourself once more, if you remain unconvinced. But I have heard reports of this child – and he is, according to eyewitnesses, a spitting image of you. What more proof or certainty do you need?”<br/>
</p><p>Unwilling to answer the older man, his face tightened with anger and many other more confusing emotions. He did not like people in general, especially people like the one standing beside him right now. He especially did not like people telling him something that tilted his world on his axis, and insisted on remaining close to him at all times. Draco Malfoy was not a people person at all, and this particular person, doing this particular task, was almost enough to send him over the edge.<br/>
</p><p>Deep breaths. Composure. Deep breaths. No feelings…<br/>
</p><p>Draco Malfoy was not a people person – but he did know how to mask his emotions, or at least fake them for a little while. This last thought sparked memories best forgotten, and his left arm twitched with phantom pain, so he turned his thoughts elsewhere. To his son.<br/>
</p><p>He had a son – a ten-year-old son, according to this overly pompous Ministry official. A son he had never known about, never particularly wanted. A son he was to meet today. Suddenly the office in the midst of Muggle London was cramped, claustrophobic, the walls closing in on him.<br/>
</p><p>“The letter?” he said, and remembering to be polite, added, “please?”<br/>
</p><p>It was a Hogwarts letter, much like the one he had received about sixteen years ago. The name on the envelope was one that Draco had wanted to name his son, if he should ever have one. Scorpius Malfoy. Somehow, the school had known the name, along with the student. The Quill of Acceptance and the Book of Admittance.<br/>
</p><p>There was no other way about it – he had a son, and for 11 years he had been raised as a Muggle. Life just had to keep getting worse, didn’t it.</p>
