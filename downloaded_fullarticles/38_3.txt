    <p>Karl took the hoodie by accident, originally.</p><p>He was on his way back to the Hufflepuff common room to retrieve his books for classes. He was glancing out the window as the sun shone through, and maybe he wasn’t exactly looking where he was going, but he slammed right into Albus and Scorpius.</p><p>Scorpius pouted a bit as he dropped his books. “Oh, fiddlesticks. I’m so sorry!” Scorpius quickly apologised, sighing as he looked up and saw Albus still trudging on forward. “Oh I uh… Albus! Wait up!” He called out, just looking back to Karl. “Again, so terribly sorry.” And with that, he was gone. </p><p>Karl just simply raised his eyebrow at the interaction and tried to shrug it off, frowning when he looked down to the ground and noticed a now lone green hoodie sitting on the ground. He cautiously picked it up before he spun back around to realise who it belonged to.</p><p>Albus and Scorpius were still in the near vicinity at that point. Karl could see Scorpius leaning in close to Albus, speaking quietly to each other. They had been like that since after all of the time turner nonsense, and at this point everyone was just leaving them be.</p><p>But it did make Karl feel weird, seeing Albus so down.</p><p>He bit his lip and shrugged. Maybe Albus didn’t need the hoodie right now, and that was why he dropped it in the first place. But Karl could return it to him in good time. And so that’s what he did.</p><p>Or at least, tried to do. He very much tried.</p><p>The first time Karl went in search of Albus was in the great hall. He had placed it in his quidditch bag, and was very cautious as he moved towards the Slytherin table with a big grin on his face. It was only a split second from when he looked down to his bag to retrieve the jumper, but by the time he looked back up, both Scorpius and Albus had vanished.</p><p>So the next time he tried was in herbology. But of course, Karl had a tendency to get distracted incredibly easily. When he set his eyes on Albus, he missed the mass of potted mandrakes that were sitting on his route. He tripped, catching his feet on their roots, causing them to be pulled. The sound of screams filled his ears and lulled him off to sleep. When he woke up, he was laid in the hospital wing. </p><p>In the jumper.</p><p>Yann just smiled their warm smile as they noticed Karl was awake. “Finally! We were worried sick. You really need to keep an eye on where you’re going, you know? You caused half of our year to pass out,” they stated. “But you were out a lot longer than the rest.”</p><p>Polly cleared her throat and chimed in. “Why were you up in the middle of class anyway? Surely you didn’t need the bathroom *that* badly.”</p><p>Karl let out a soft sigh. “I had something to give someone, but I don’t think it matters anymore. Have I missed the quidditch practice?”</p><p>“No. It’s not for another half an hour,” Polly stated. </p><p>“But it’s not recommended that you go flying out of bed this soon after passing out for six hours,” Yann chimed in, crossing her arms. “You need to just take a second. Go back to the common room and chill. Quidditch will be there next week.”</p><p>“Fine. I have some studying I need to do anyway. I’m going to go to the library.”</p><p>“Do you need help? You know we’re here… we can help with your notes, or we could read you the questions!” Yann suggested excitedly. </p><p>“I’m sure Karl will be okay on his own. We have some of our own studying to do anyway,” Polly stated with a small grin, just dragging Yann out of the hospital wing.</p><p>“I don’t need help anyway you know! I can do this stuff on my own!” Karl yelled after them, huffing as he brought himself to his feet.</p><p>He thanked Madame Pomfrey before he headed straight out to the library. It took him a few laps before he found the books he needed. He pulled out his notebook and got settled at the table, trying to focus as he struggled with the text.</p><p>The focus didn’t last for long, as it was interrupted by a rather quiet voice. “I’ve been looking for that everywhere, you know. And I’d like it back.”</p><p>The Hufflepuff glanced back over his shoulder and his eyes landed on the one and only, Albus Potter. Although, he looked quite different to the bright eyed Albus at the start of the year. His skin was pale, and the space under his eyes was filled with darkness. HIs robes hung off him rather loosely, and his face held little expression.</p><p>Karl took a moment to stare. He knew it was rude, but frankly he wasn’t even sure what to say. He probably looked like a thief in Albus’ eyes.</p><p>“Jenkins, I want my jumper back. That’s all. So if you just… take it off, then I can have it back. No issues,” he said quietly, taking a step closer.</p><p>“It was uh, rather careless of you to drop it in the first place, you know? If this jumper is that important then you should be much more careful in keeping a hold of it.”</p><p>Albus was quiet in that moment. He just glanced down at his feet, unsure of what to say. He could lie, but lying had originally sent him down the deep dark path that ruined him originally. So he took a deep breath, and he began to blurt out the truth.</p><p>“I’m having a hard time at the moment. A very… very hard time. Adjusting back to this has been hard. But… I would really appreciate having my jumper back? I won’t ask for anything else. I just want the jumper.”</p><p>Karl glanced up and down, and then he let words slip that he was sure he was going to regret.<br/>“Next time you want the jumper, you can come find me instead. I’ll see you around Albus.”</p><p>And with that, he picked up his books and left the library, leaving Albus alone in the dark corner of the library.</p>
