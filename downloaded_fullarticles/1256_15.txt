    <p>This just had to be a joke...<br/>
...right?</p>
<p>Blood red eyes reflected their inner confusion, as the owner stared blankly down at the parchment that they held within long, spidery fingers. The results of the latest test, was surprising, to say the least. Surprising...and suspicious.</p>

<p>Well, well, well.<br/>
Looks like the Potters weren't so light, after all.</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>They inwardly frowned, brows furrowing slightly in thought. When they took up their heritage (why they hadn’t done this before, they still weren’t sure), the one home that had drawn their attention had been a manor that had once belonged to their ancestor. Strangely enough, even after a thousand years, the building was in near perfect condition. Of course, it took a good amount of gold to satisfy the greedy goblins about getting the manor updated with current wards and modern needs. They looked back at the results, before realization dawned on them. There was a book that they remembered coming across during their youth. It was a book full of obscure potions that had been lost to time, but there was one potion in particular that had been very interesting. </p>
<p>The Abeo Potion.</p>
<p>Eyes shining brightly as they grinned, they hurried to their study; test results in hand. The room was quite cozy, with dark furniture, row after row of books (that was spent years in gathering, and a warm fire that blazed happily from the built-in fireplace. Humming softly, they started scrolling through their collection; before a seemingly nameless book caught their attention.</p>
<p>Smirking, they withdrew the book, revealing a worn book with yellowed pages that was held together by a dark green binding. There was no words to indicate the book’s subject, but they knew that this was the book that they had been looking for. They flipped through the pages, until about halfway through, the words <b>Abeo Potion</b>, flashed in bold, black script. The Abeo Potion had been thought up by the infamous Salazar Slytherin so long ago, and it had been proven to be a lifesaver for the old bloodlines. The Abeo Potion, once enjested, would awaken any creature blood within the host. Gradually, over time, the potion would transform the blood; making the host a true pureblood.</p>
<p>Looking the ingredients over, they gave a slight nod. It didn’t require much, though, some of the ingredients would be a bit tricky; but it would work. Their eyes glazed over slightly as they thought about Harry Potter, and a cruel smile graced their lips as they chuckled softly. Yes, with this, Potter would have no choice but to turn to <i>them</i> for safety. The so-called war was over before it could truly begin, and there was nothing for the Light Side to do but accept defeat.</p>
