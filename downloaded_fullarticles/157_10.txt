          <div class="userstuff"><p><em>I never should have let Hermione teach them about Muggle music, </em>Harry thought. He was certain he was going to spontaneously combust. How had a simple game of truth or dare turned so horribly, horribly wrong? He would get Seamus and Dean for this, he thought. <em>If I survive the night that is.</em></p>
<p>It was bad-a bloody-nough that Draco was wearing a see-through mesh crop top, and, Harry shuddered, skin-tight short shorts, but then he had chosen dare and Seamus and Dean had both grinned conspiratorially, looking over at Harry, and he <em>knew </em>he was done for.</p>
<p>“Give Harry a lap dance,” Seamus said.</p>
<p>“To Genie in a Bottle,” Dean added with a grin. It was a pop song from some new Muggle artist Harry had never heard of but that apparently Draco was obsessed with. Draco merely shrugged, and got to his feet, making his way over to Harry. Dean and Seamus both looked like they were about to get a show themselves, and Harry swallowed nervously, the music began to play from somewhere, and Draco began to dance.</p>
<p>Harry watched, eyes transfixed as so much pale flesh was suddenly on display as Draco gyrated his hips to and fro to the music, the lyrics did <em>nothing </em>to help the situation either. Harry felt his mouth go completely dry as Draco crawled into his lap then, rubbing his arse over Harry’s lap teasingly, and throwing his long hair about as he danced.</p>
<p>Harry was <em>certain </em>if this kept up, one of two things would happen.</p>
<p>He would snap and pull Draco into his lap and fuck the living shit out of him then and there, or he would come in his trousers. Draco swirled his hips, in front of Harry’s face, his arse just millimeters away. Harry stared intently at the pale expanse of legs that just seemed to go on forever.</p>
<p>“No touching, Harry,” Seamus reminded him, Harry looked down to find his hands were hovering just over Draco’s thigh. <em>Bugger, </em>he thought, all but sitting on his hands.</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t the only one transfixed by Draco’s performance either, most of the 8<sup>th</sup> years, boys and girls alike were watching in rapt fascination as Draco danced all around the group, no longer solely teasing Harry but in his own little world of the song.</p>
<p>It was all Harry could do not to let out a moan as Draco wiggled his arse about. The song ended, and the whole room was dead silent as Draco took a seat back where he had been sitting.</p>
<p>“Well, who the hell is gonna top that?” Seamus asked.</p>
<p>Harry raised his hand, which was instantly slapped down by Ron. Harry didn’t know what to do with himself, all he could think about was all that pale flesh that had been put so deliciously on display and how badly he wanted to drag his tongue across each and every inch of it. </p>
<p>The game continued on as normal, for everyone but Harry, he couldn’t stop staring at Draco, he had never realized how agile he was. How sensual his movements could be. </p>
<p>“Mate,” Ron hissed, slapping Harry’s shoulder with the back of his hand. “It’s you.” </p>
<p>Harry blinked, looking around the room. Seamus looked expectantly at Harry. He knew better than to take truth. “Dare,” he said. </p>
<p>Seamus grinned wide, “Kiss Malfoy,” he said. There were several hoots and wolf whistles at that. </p>
<p>“With tongue,” Dean added. </p>
<p>Harry’s eyes widened, he didn’t know why he was so surprised, he looked over at Draco who gave him a challenging look in return. <em>Typical Slytherin, </em>Harry thought. <em>Now or never Potter, </em>he said to himself, his heart racing in his chest as he got to his feet and made his way across the circle towards Draco. Draco stood too, he was considerably shorter than Harry, he realized. Leaning down, Harry cupped Draco’s face in his hands and pressed their lips together, slowly. Vaguely, he could hear the group hooting and hollering again, but he didn’t care, all he cared about was this moment, and Draco’s warm, soft lips against his own. He nibbled at Draco’s bottom lip, drawing out a soft moan from the blond that went straight to Harry’s cock. He growled, deepening the kiss and slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth. Their tongues battled against one another, teasing each other, as Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders. </p>
<p>Harry’s hands traveled of their own accord down to Draco’s arse, squeezing his soft, perfectly round cheeks in his gruff hands. Draco moaned, arching into Harry’s embrace. It was then, that Harry realized they were very much not alone, and he pulled away after a long moment, much to the obvious displeasure of his fellow 8th years who all booed at their stopping. </p>
<p>“Well that backfired on me spectacularly,” Seamus said. </p>
<p>Dean chuckled, and Harry blushed, without thinking, he took a seat in Draco’s spot and pulled Draco into his lap. If Draco minded this new seating arrangement, he made no mention of it. Nor did he seem particularly bothered by the fact that Harry had begun absentmindedly playing with his hair, pushing it to the side to press soft little kisses to Draco’s neck. Draco shivered beneath his touch and it was all Harry could do not to tease his fingers up and down Draco’s flesh. He just hoped it would be welcome. </p>
<p>“Don’t start something you don’t intend to finish Potter,” Draco hissed after a moment. </p>
<p>Harry smirked against Draco’s throat. “What makes you think I wouldn’t want to finish?” </p>
<p>Draco looked back at him, “Do you?” </p>
<p>Harry gave him a little thrust so Draco would feel his hard cock against his arse. Draco groaned, and Harry covered his mouth with his hand, casting a notice-me-not on them. “Feel that? It’s all for you baby,” he purred. </p>
<p>Draco whimpered behind his hand and Harry couldn’t help but grin as he continued to tease him all throughout the rest of the game. </p>
