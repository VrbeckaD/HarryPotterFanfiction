    <p>It was through a strange and unusual turn of events that Holly Potter came to be where she was now. Here being on vacation with her relatives in Japan.</p>
<p>After tripping over one of her numerous cats Holly's usual minder, old Mrs.Figg, had broken her leg and was unable to watch her. Through his work Uncle Vernon had received a free vacation to Japan, which the family couldn't afford to turn down due to their pride in their public image (the same reason they couldn't leave Holly alone to mind herself), so for once in her short and mostly miserable life the raven haired girl got to join them. It was clear that the Dursleys were unhappy with this, but quickly it gave her Uncle an idea - one that his wife was more than happy to agree with.</p>
<p>"Get up you lazy girl and gather your things!" Aunt Petunia yelled, a scowl on her horse-like face. The smaller than average bespectacled girl complied with the woman's demand, knowing better than to test her relatives' patience - lest she receive a (usually painful) punishment. </p>
<p>She'd packed her small ratty backpack (which was once Dudleys before he got a new one), filling it mainly with the few clothes she had (which were all Dudleys' hand me downs as well) and a few knickknacks she'd managed to gather along their journey. There were a collection of snacks and mints she swiped off the plane from the nice stewardess, along with a collection of books and lessons on tape to learn japanese (both writing and spoken) that the kindly old businessman sitting next to her on the plane offered her when he caught her struggling to teach herself from a worn english-japanese dictionary she'd pilfered from the local library when she heard about the Dursleys' trip a month ago. She felt a little bad about stealing, but given how mean the librarian there was to all the children who visit (but especially her) it didn't last long.</p>
<p>Holly doubts that Ms. Sharpe even noticed it's gone, given how hard it was for the girl to find it in the first place.</p>
<p>The raven haired girl even added a plush deer fawn that looked as though it was once a bright blue, but was now a pale blueish-grey, and a maroon hooded cloak with a silver crescent moon shaped clip to hold it closed that she'd swiped from a box of garbage on the walk to their hotel and hidden quickly to avoid her relatives taking it from her. The deer was cute and strangely nostalgic, Holly naming him Prongs - though she isn't sure why that name seemed so fitting. And the cloak looked a bit like a piece of an old halloween costume for a witch or vampire, both of which her Aunt would hate if she found out about it... So Holly made sure her relatives didn't find out about it.</p>
<p>"I've done what you asked Aunt Petunia." Holly said timidly as she put on her backpack, looking down at her feet under the woman's shrewd eyes. Sniffing the blonde slipped on her shoes "Come along then. You're going to camp for the rest of the holiday, so you don't ruin it for us with your freakishness!"</p>
<p>Going to camp? Her?! </p>
<p>Holly was excited, though she didn't show it as they took a taxi to their destination. She knew that if her relatives suspected she was looking forward to it they would change their minds, if only to spite her. And she so wanted to go to this camp!</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia looked oddly happy to see her leave as she got onto the bus, leaving as soon as the 10 year old had gotten on board. Awkwardly the raven moved to sit at the very back of the bus, brushing off the woman's behavior as being glad that she wouldn't be around for a while. The feeling was mutual. Taking out her books and tape player from the businessman Holly got to work on her japanese lessons. She had gotten a few pages into the book, leaving the tapes for the actual drive, when someone claimed the seat next to her.</p>
<p>It was a boy a little taller than herself with spiky red hair and dark eyes that seemed about her age. He was dressed in an orange button up and olive green shorts that looked baggy on him - but nowhere near as baggy as the dark grey t-shirt Holly was wearing like a dress. He flashed a quick smile at her, introducing himself as "Izumi Koushirou" and holding out a gloved hand. Shaking it the girl replied with a shy smile "Potter Holly." remembering that in Japanese culture you say your surname first. Introductions done the pair sat in silence, Koushirou doing something on the laptop he pulled out of his bag while Holly returned to teaching herself the boy's language.</p>
<p>Were they friends now? Is this how you make friends? Holly didn't know for sure, but she hoped so. </p>
<p>She's always wanted a friend.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>As he walked onto the bus Koushirou held in a groan. Most free seats he saw were taken by children significantly louder and rowdier than himself. Except for Taichi and that moody looking blonde next to him, but that would be a tight fit and he knew better than to trust the brunette near his laptop. Moving further down the aisle a raven black birds-nest caught his eye in the back corner, which as he grew closer he noticed belonged to a girl with big round glasses that was wearing a very unflattering t-shirt that looked like it belonged to a grown man once re-purposed into a dress.</p>
<p>While it was dark grey in color the redhead got the feeling that it used to be black once. </p>
<p>Sitting next to her on the seat Koushirou held out his hand and introduced himself, earning a reply of "Potter Holly" in a quiet but sweet voice. As he looked at her face the boy noticed her foreign features to match the English name, and the odd lightning-shaped scar on her brow, his favorite feature being her eyes. They were easily the most brilliant shade of green he'd ever seen.</p>
<p>While Potter returned to her book, putting on her headphones to listen to something as she did. Koushirou recognized the book as one that teaches foreigners Japanese and got an idea, pulling out his laptop. Opening the language program he installed to better teach himself for school the redhead started working on his English, hoping to bridge the gaps in him and his new friend's ability to speak to each other. The genius smiled as he glanced briefly at the shorter girl next to him. </p>
<p>Hopefully she wants to be his friend, she seems nice.</p>
<p>The rest of the journey to the campground, for these two at least, passed in relative silence.</p>
