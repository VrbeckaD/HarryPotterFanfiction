    <p>
  <span>He awoke under a huge tree. He blinked as he looked to the starry sky through the leaves and branches. He could make out the different constellations in the night sky. He moved his head to look around, and started blinking before looking back to the stars. The tree was in the middle of a clearing that was surrounded by forest. The gigantic beech tree he was lying beneath towered over all the other trees with low hanging branches that just barely brushed the ground, it seemed to create some sort of dome.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blinked again. The young boy had no idea how he had gotten there. The last thing remembers is walking home from school with his two best friends. He tried to sit up, only to gasp in pain as a burning sensation overcame his whole body. As he fell back on the ground, his memory returning as it flashed before his mind's eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His darker than night black hair fell over his face and fanned around his head. He stared through the branches above him with disbelieving, bright, ice blue eyes. He couldn't believe it. He couldn't believe that it had happened, at all. But he knew a way to prove whether or not it happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So he reached his hands over his head, ignoring the burning pain that came to him with each movement. He moved his hands through his onyx hair, becoming more hopeful as he moved black hair in and out of his vision. But his hope sank the moment pure white hair moved into his vision. The hair, whiter than freshly fallen snow, belonged to him and he knew it. It was proof that it had happened. That he hadn't just imagined it all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The small boy let his right arm drop to cover his eyes and his left arm back to his side. He started to sob lightly. Tears started to stream out from behind the boy's arm. Soft sobs began to fill the seemingly empty, and oddly silent, clearing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the child continued to cry, he didn't notice the animals that started to silently emerge from the forest. He didn't notice that some of them looked like the mythical beings that he had only read about in books. He didn't notice the animals and creatures look at each other in confusion and worry. He didn't notice a pure black wolf emerge from the crowd of creatures and start to slowly and silently walk towards him. He didn't notice that when the wolf was inside of the canopy of branches, that it leapt the rest of the away to him and land between the child and the tree trunk, on the opposite side which the wolf had been approaching from.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he did notice when a cold wet nose was pressed into his right palm. He jerked his hand away from the nose, effectively removing his lower right arm from his eyes. The boy gasped again from the pain of moving and his arm fell back to his side, away from the wolf that was watching him closely with crimson eyes. The boy looked to the wolf for the first time, panting lightly from crying and the pain. The wolf had fur the color of the night, and with each movement, a black wisp seemed to leave a trail behind him. The wolf was huge, much larger than a normal one. His eyes were the color of fresh blood, something that the young human knew well. The emotions portrayed in those eyes were astonishing. There was concern, worry, and anxiety shown in those human eyes on that canine face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy was mesmerised by the sight of the wolf. And the wolf was mesmerised by the sight of the boy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wolf had been watching the boy since his appearance in the clearing. He was just sunbathing when a ripping sound overcame the forest noise. The creatures of the forest had turned silent to look toward the ancient beech, trying and failing to see past the low hanging branches to see what had made the noise. The black wolf had been curious of the sound, so he crept up toward the old beech. As he passed the low branches, he was met with the sight of a toxic green hole hanging in mid-air a few inches above the ground, a dark brown man-wolf, and a humanoid creature carrying a human child in a blanket and a medium sized duffle bag. Because of the branches in his view, the wolf couldn't see the beings in detail, but noticed that it had a slight glow that two out of three of them possessed. The man-wolf was a dark brown color, stood on two legs with ease, and was wearing bright green human clothes. But the most striking feature of the man-wolf had to be the long, toxic green claws that it possessed. The humanoid being appeared very human-like, but obviously wasn't for the moving metal inside of it's chest and the other-worldly glow surrounding it. It had blue skin and wore purple human-clothes, and a purple cloak as well. It held a metal staff in one hand and was cradling a human child in the other with a bag over one shoulder. The child was obviously human, due to the lack of a glow and adnormal skin color. The two beings that had brought the child there were obviously conflicted. They stared at the child for a long moment, before placing the human child down before the truck of the old beech while unwrapping the huge black blanket from around the child, then making it into a nest around the small human body. The humanoid being placed the bag on the ground next to the cloth nest. The man-wolf had watched the child with sadness and regret as this happened. When the glowing man was done he turned to the man-wolf and put a hand on it's shoulder while nodding, before turning back to the green hole. The man-wolf's shoulders slumped as he turned back to the small child. The man-wolf suddenly jumped, going straight into the gaping, green hole in the sky. The glowing man stopped moving towards to hole right before entering. The man then looked right at the shadow wolf, startling it to stand up from it's crouch. The man placed a single finger to his lips, as if asking to be silent. Whether it was to not wake the child or to never tell anyone that they were there was a mystery. So the glowing man continued toward the green hole, and when he had disappeared it through, the hole closed slowly and disappeared with a popping sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wolf had been frozen for a moment, before breaking out of it as he heard some other forest creatures move closer to the old beech. There was no doubt that they wanted to find out what had happened. The wolf was almost tempted to let them, but not when he remembered the glowing man. The wolf had jumped into action immediately, making sure that no creature made it past the branches. When a centaur came and asked why, the wolf told him about what he had seen and the warning that the glowing man had given him. The centaur had agreed that they should heed the man's warning, and he rounded up some of the other forest beings to guard the beech. Some of the creatures had some trouble staying out of the know, but they eventually settled down when they were told what the shadow wolf had seen. It had gotten out while trying to get the other creatures of the forest to settle down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been well past sunset, when the boy had awakened. No one had moved when they first heard the rustle of the blanket that the human lied on. All the forest creatures had stilled. No creature made a sound as the human pup took in its surroundings. They had been confused when the pup started to mess with its midnight black head fur, exactly like the wolf's fur, if not darker. Then they all saw the unnatural white hair. The white as snow hair within the midnight black of the pup's fur. The human seemed to freeze, it's arms had dropped, left one at its side and the right over its eyes. Then it began to sob. It cried such sorrow and disbelief that every creature could feel it in the pup's voice and the air itself. They then knew that something had happened to the human child, something that the unnatural white hair now symbolized.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wolf hadn't hesitated to go to the human pup's side, unlike the other creatures and beings of the forest that didn't know what to do. He had acted on instinct, and had jumped over the pup to get a quick, full body glance of the pup, and had ended up on his left side. That had seemed to give the others an idea of what to do, and some of them left to go get things and some started to slowly creep up to the pup, not wanting to disturb him or the wolf. When the wolf had placed his nose in the pup's right hand, making the pup flinch at the sudden contact. When the wolf saw the pup's eyes, he was astonished at the pure power and emotion in them, and the way that they were the color of freshly melted ice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which is where you now find the human child and the black wolf now. Staring at each other in fascination and curiosity, forgetting the world around them. That is until a male centaur walked up to the blanket nest and kneeled down next to it. That shocked both of them out of their staring contest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The centaur gave a small and gentle smile before looking at the boy. He was panting, taking in short breaths and exhaling just as quickly. He frowned at this, and moved a hand to place it on the boy's chest. The human flinched away from the touch, and winced in pain. This caused the centaur's frown to deepen. Even the slightest move this child made caused him pain. The centaur looked to the shadow wolf, and saw the worry and concern in its gaze. He had seen it as well. The wolf looked to the centaur, and then nodded in agreement. They looked to the human, who was watching them in confusion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Young one, do not fear." The centaur spoke in a soft voice, catching the human child's attention. The child looked to the centaur with eyes full of pain, caution, and curiosity. The centaur was surprised at the emotions he saw, having expected to see fear in the child's eyes. The human child seemed to notice, as his lips seemed to twitch upwards. The centaur felt his own lips twitch, as the shadow wolf had an unrestrained canine grin on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You are in pain, are you not?" The centaur asked, not worried about getting a response. The small human responded in a hum, giving the impression that he could not speak through said pain or perhaps exhaustion. The centaur and shadow wolf frowned at that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am going to pick you up, and take you to where you can be healed. Is that alright?" The centaur asked, his voice still calm and soft, if not worried and concerned. The shadow wolf scoffed at the question, getting a glare from the centaur. The child watched the interaction with interest, having never seen a centaur or having seen a wolf act like the one before him now. He hummed again, grabbing the attention of the two beings standing over him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The centaur looked to the wolf, and the wolf looked to the centaur. The human child watched both as they exchange glances, a look of amusement passed over the human child's face, but was quickly overcome by a hiss of pain as the child tried to move his legs. That brought the mythical beings' attention back the human child that was withering in pain. They looked back to each as their eyes took a determined and concerned gleam, nodded to each other, and got down to work. The centaur mumbled something along the lines of 'maybe not', as he gained a thoughtful look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The centaur looked back to the crowd of forest creatures that had been creeping toward them at a very slow pace, but they all froze as the centaur looked at each and everyone of them. The centaur pointed in some directions and motioned for those that he had pointed to to come forward. None had hesitated to comply. Two centaurs, a younger male and middle aged female, came running up to him together with a few imps on their backs and heels, while some fairies, pixies, and doxies came flying after them. They all looked desperate, and concerned for the human child, willing to take any orders that the centaur and shadow wolf dealt out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the new creatures and beings came up to the boy, they had mixed reactions. The female and younger male centaur, as well as the fairies, were trying to cuddle the young human while fussing about injuries while the older male centaur and imps watched with ever growing amusement and irritation. The shadow wolf and the doxies just watched on in growing irritation at the scene. The small human just looked at them in wonder and embarrassment, not used to being fussed over and having never seen anything like the beings in front of him now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The original centaur sighed, wondering why he chose those two. "Alright, Stea, I want you to evaluate the child's injuries and heal them to the best of your ability." The female centaur nodded, and used her silver hunting knife to cut through the human child's clothes. "Cursor, I want you to go and get the human healer, bring her here. Tell her about what had happened, carry her on your back if you must and take the doxies. They should be able to carry any supplies that the healer feels necessary to bring along." The young centaur nodded and took off, followed by about two dozen doxies, headed towards the wizarding village at speeds that would make any parent proud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Komí̱ti̱s." He looked back to Stea, who was looking worriedly and horrified at the now bare chest of the child. Komí̱ti̱s moved closer to see what had made the seasoned healer so horrified, only to stop and drop to his knees in shock and horror at the sight of the young child's chest. "Oh, Asclepius, what happened to this child." He murmured, as Stea sent some of the fairies and imps to go get herbs and other things as she cut away the long sleeves of his rag like shirt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child's chest was like that of a soldier's, and as Komí̱ti̱s looked at the child's clothes, he knew that this was no ordinary child. What was left of his black long sleeve shirt laid in rags beneath him, thanks to Stea, and his black pants looked to be shredded in several places, and both were sticky from old and fresh blood from the lacerations all over the boy's body. The only pieces of cloth on the child that weren't in rags, were the child's fingerless, black leather gloves and the boy's black combat boots and socks, but those were too soaked in blood and scuffed. And the wounds that were on the young child's body were even worse. There were deep, very deep lacerations that crisscrossed the boy's chest as well as bullet wounds on both shoulders and one on the his upper right arm. And below all of those wounds you could still old scars underneath. This child had seen things that no one should have to see, no matter how young or old, human or not, mortal or not, no one should have to ever experience this much pain in their life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Komí̱ti̱s looked to the young human's eyes, and what he saw astounded him. The child's eyes, those warm ice blue eyes, were staring at him with an understanding and pleading look. The child knew exactly how bad his wounds were and he wanted to pain to stop, no matter the cost. If Komí̱ti̱s and Stea could do that, then he would let them, even if they killed him. Komí̱ti̱s heard a sound that sounded the mix of a growl and a wine, and turned to see the shadow wolf standing behind him. It was looking at the human child with eyes full of rage and denial. He could tell that the wolf hated the look on the human child's face, and he would admit that he hated it as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child was suprised to see and hear the anger in the wolf and centaur. He had not expected them to get angry at him for wanting the pain to end. Well, maybe he shouldn't be ready to die to end the immense pain he felt, but who could blame him? It literally felt like he was being electrocuted each and every time he moved! He just wanted to sleep, and not feel any more pain. That was all he wanted. Was that so wrong?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shadow wolf was angry. And rightly so. This human child was ready to give up his life to stop the pain. The wolf could tell that it wasn't just physical, but emotional pain that consumed the small pup as well. The wolf was angry at the human pup for being willing to die for his pain to cease. He was angry at whoever would even lay a single harmful touch on the pup. And he was angry that he couldn't do anything about it without taking the young pup's life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The centaurs and shadow wolf were shocked out of their thoughts as the small child started to close his eyes. Their worry and concern grew as they realized that if the child slept now, he may never wake up. They desperately tried to think of something to keep the child awake, anything. Stea brightened at a thought, catching Komí̱ti̱s' and the shadow wolf's attention. Stea moved forward a bit to the child's side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"My name is Stea. I am a healer for the centaur herd in this forest." The child's eyes opened a bit more to stare at the female centaur, having now a name for a face. Komí̱ti̱s and the shadow wolf knew what she was doing and silently praised her for her genius.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am Komí̱ti̱s, the leader of the centaur herd here in Shadow Wood." Komí̱ti̱s said, gaining the child's attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gestured to the shadow wolf beside him. "This is the Spirit of Shadow Wood, he is a shadow wolf." The child looked at the wolf, before raising an eyebrow. The question was obvious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Stea giggled a bit as Komí̱ti̱s chuckled, gaining the young human's attention. "No, he doesn't have a name. Well if he does he wouldn't tell us, no one really knows why." The shadow wolf huffed at that, gaining the child's attention again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child seemed to think for a bit, returning his gaze to the branches above them. "What is it, child?" Stea asked in a soft and kind voice, though there was an underlying note of concern there as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child's eyes crossed as he thought. This gained some chuckles and giggling from the humanoid beings crowding him, and an amused stare from the shadow wolf.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Na-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The beings were startled out of their amusement when they heard the sound. Looking at the small, injured child they noticed that he had a look of concentration on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Name."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They could hear the sound of hooves on the ground, and the yelling of the young centaur, Cursor, and the human healer coming closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Rav-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They could hear the whispers of the other creatures and beings all around them, but they couldn't bring themselves to care. The three of them were anticipating what the child was going to say next.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"-ven."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stared at the young human in amazement. Not even noticing Cursor or the human healer come under the low branches of the ancient beech tree. The child must be in excruciating amounts of pain right that second, just trying to say his name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Raven."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child's name was Raven.</span>
