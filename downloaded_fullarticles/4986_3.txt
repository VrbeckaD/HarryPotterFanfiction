    <p>Hidden under his invisibility cloak, Harry waited. The Maurader’s Map showed the wandering path that Draco Malfoy was taking as he ascended up various staircases toward the seventh floor, where Harry was waiting. Harry wondered briefly why Malfoy didn’t have his two cronies with him. It was definitely better for Harry that he didn’t, though. No need to Stupefy the gits to get Malfoy alone.</p><p>Finally, Malfoy rounded the corner to the seventh floor corridor. The Slytherin glanced around, making sure the coast was clear. Harry had figured out weeks ago that Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement, but he’d been unable to get in. He hoped that Draco would speak loud enough that Harry could find out what he was using the room for. He planned to follow Draco inside and spy on him. But Draco didn’t announce his intentions, instead muttering the words so quietly that Harry couldn’t hear him.</p><p>Realizing he’d lose his opportunity if Draco slipped inside the door, Harry threw caution to the wind. Letting the invisibility cloak slip to the floor, he called out to the distracted blond, his wand at the ready. “Hey Malfoy! Fancy seeing you here.”</p><p>Draco whirled around, his wand in his hand, pointing at Harry.</p><p>Instead of the surprise or fear Harry expected to see, Malfoy looked triumphant.</p><p>“What are you up to, Malfoy?” Harry asked, his heart speeding up in confusion.</p><p>“Potter, Potter, Potter,” Draco drawled. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”</p><p>“Cut the crap, Malfoy, I know what you’ve been doing,” Potter said.</p><p>“Do you now,” Malfoy replied. “If that’s so, why do you keep following me?” Draco took a step closer to Harry. “Think I didn’t notice?” Draco spat. “Think you got lucky, did you? Think you <em>caught </em>me at something?”</p><p>“I know you gave Katie that necklace,” Potter pronounced. “And I know…” Suddenly Harry felt the charge of electricity in the air as the spells hit him. His body went rigid, his arms clapping to his sides, his legs snapping together, his jaw ceasing up. He teetered for a moment, before Draco approached him, smiling viciously. A light push to his shoulder, and Harry was falling backwards, landing hard on the flagstones, the wind knocked out of him.</p><p>As he tried to catch his breath, Crabbe and Goyle came into view, guffawing.</p><p>“You were so focused on me, Potter, you forgot to keep an eye on your surroundings. A first year mistake,” Malfoy sneered. “It’s a wonder the Dark Lord hasn’t managed to kill you already.”</p><p>Potter could say nothing with the body bind controlling his voluntary muscles. He cursed himself; Malfoy didn’t need to remind him of his own stupidity.</p><p>“Well, well, well, what should we do about him?” Draco mused.</p><p>“Kill him,” Goyle suggested. “Save the Dark Lord the trouble.”</p><p>“We should torture him first,” Crabbe suggested, cracking his knuckles.</p><p>Harry felt a tinge of fear creep into the rage that filled him. They could do whatever that wanted to him and there wasn’t a thing he could do about it. And no one knew he was here, so unless a random person happened to wander into the corridor, he was at their mercy.</p><p>“Hmm…” Draco purred, walking around Harry’s prone body in a circle, his wand pointed at Harry. “I’ve been wanting someone to practice the Cruciatus curse on,” Malfoy said. “You know what that is, don’t you, Potter?”</p><p>Goyle laughed and Crabbe said, “Let me have a go, Malfoy.”</p><p>Malfoy raised a hand. “Patience, Crabbe.” He returned his attention to Potter. “The problem with the Cruciatus curse,” Draco murmured, “is that we have to stick around to administer it. I’d prefer something a bit more hands-off, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Harry’s heart raced as sweat beaded down his back. He knew that Malfoy had planned this, and knowing Malfoy, it wouldn’t be good. He struggled against the body bind, but it was useless.</p><p>As Draco continued to circle him, he added, “Something that will do some lasting damage all on its own.”</p><p>Crabbe and Goyle guffawed. </p><p>Harry wanted to groan.</p><p>“Something that will haunt him for the rest of his life,” Draco said.</p><p>Harry struggled harder against his invisible bindings.</p><p>“Potter!” Malfoy snapped, drawing Harry’s attention.</p><p>Harry met Draco’s gaze, portraying as much defiance in his stare as he could.</p><p>“Sweet Potter,” Draco murmured, crouching over and dragging the tip of his wand along Harry’s cheek as if it was a caress and not the clear threat that it was. “There is only person who’ll be able to help you after I’m done with you,” Malfoy purred. “Only one.”</p><p>The smirk Draco gave him made Harry’s skin crawl.</p><p>“Severus Snape,” Draco breathed, and then raised his wand.</p><p>“Libidine Cogere!”</p><p>Harry felt the spell hit him with the force of a freight train. His body bucked and fire seemed to race through his veins. Harry tried to scream, but the body bind prevented it. Through the haze of pain, Harry heard Malfoy say Snape’s name again, and some other words he couldn’t quite understand, and then his vision dimmed, his body relaxed, and he knew no more.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry awoke to the sensation of heat spiraling through his body. It wasn’t painful, but it wasn’t pleasant either. He sat up, rubbing at his arms. It felt like ants were crawling under his skin, trying to get out. He looked around the deserted corridor, realizing he was alone. At least Malfoy and his cronies had left. And Malfoy had obviously released the body bind. It could have been worse.</p><p>Harry struggled to his feet, trying to recall the details of what had happened. He hadn’t recognized the curse, wasn’t sure he could even remember it. It was something like “libi… cogee..” He hadn’t heard of it, or anything like it, before. And other than that anxious feeling coursing through his body, nothing else seemed amiss.</p><p>Gathering up his inivisibilty cloak, wand, and the Maurader’s map, he reflected on what else Malfoy had said. Something about only one person being able to help him, and that person being Severus Snape.</p><p>The moment Snape’s name entered his mind, Harry was overcome with a feeling so intense he nearly blacked out. He fell into the wall beside him, trying to breathe through the sensation. Every nerve in his body fired, and every cell in his body screamed for the man. Harry hissed out a breath, nearly coming in his pants. <em>What the fuck?</em></p><p>He took a step forward, then another. The friction of his trousers against his straining erection had him gasping. <em>No no no! This was not happening! </em>He tried to take another step. His mind threw up an image of Snape in his dark robes, his dark eyes filled with danger, his lips a thin line, and Harry cried out, his orgasm ripping through him, pleasure and pain all wrapped into one. Gasping, Harry rested his sweaty forehead against the wall. What had Malfoy done to him?  </p><p>
  <em>There is only person who’ll be able to help you after I’m done with you. Severus Snape.</em>
</p><p>Malfoy’s words came back to him and Harry moaned in despair. Just the thought of the man had Harry erect again. His body urged him forward, toward Snape, toward relief. This wasn’t sexual tension, this was an all-consuming, irrepressible, undeniable <em>need</em>. He tried to plant his feet, refuse to move, but his body had other ideas.</p><p>His cock continued to rub against his trousers and it was too much. Cursing, Harry waved his wand and vanished the clothes beneath his robe. Without the friction, he felt a tiny bit more in control. At least he might be able to make it to the dungeons without embarrassing himself further.</p><p>He made it two floors down, his body drenched in sweat, before he had to slip into a bathroom and release himself with his hand. The relief was only momentary, though. Whatever Malfoy had done, it was linked to Snape, and Harry doubted the curse would release him until he’d thoroughly embarrassed himself in front of the one man he loathed.</p><p>He washed his hands and looked into the mirror. His face was flushed and his breathing ragged. His lips were swollen and his pupils were too large. He looked wanton and depraved. He cursed and turned away from the mirror, wiping his sweaty palms on his robes. No wonder those two second years had shrieked and run at the sight of him when they’d crossed his path on the stairs.</p><p>Harry pulled his invisibility cloak out and threw it over himself. He made it down two more floors, his hand pressed hard against his erection beneath his cloak, trying to force back the need. How on earth was he going to make it to the dungeons?</p><p>Yet his body wouldn’t take no for an answer. His legs moved of their own accord, urging him forward. Tears sprang to his eyes as his need overwhelmed him, but he pushed on, trying to ignore it. Half-way down the staircase between the second and first floor, he came, unwillingly, crying out and biting his lip at the exquisite yet unwanted torture of it.</p><p>He slumped, invisible, against the railing, tears running down his face. Casting a cleaning spell on himself, and thankful that no one was around to hear him, he rushed down the stairs, begging his body to let him make it to Snape’s office before he completely lost it.</p><p>By the time he made it to the dungeons, he thought has losing his mind. He was sobbing and hobbling, pressing against his erection, feeling the cold air chill the sweat on his skin, causing him to shake. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to see him like this, but there was no use for it. He couldn’t deny the compulsion, couldn’t stop it, no matter how hard he tried. He cursed Malfoy repeatedly, but now Malfoy’s name came out punctuated by anguished sobs more than anger.</p><p>Harry neared Snape’s office, hoping and praying that the wizard was in. What if he wasn’t? A sound of despair broke from his throat, but a tiny rational bit of his mind—or was it the curse?—assured him that if the man was elsewhere in the castle, Harry’s body would have led him there instead.</p><p>Harry didn’t stop to knock, couldn’t stop. He turned the knob and stumbled over the threshold, his hand pressed hard against his cock, his sobs a broken moan. He lunged forward, grasping blindly for he knew not what—Release? Relief? Respite?</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Snape startled at the sound of his office door being flung open. He scanned the entryway but saw no one. Yet he could hear heavy breathing and footsteps and the sound of… sobbing?</p><p>“Who’s there?” he demanded, jumping to his feet and pulling out his wand.</p><p>He felt someone crash into him, arms wrapping around him, clawing at him, as cries surrounded him.</p><p>“What the…”</p><p>And then that sobbing mass was pushing against him, <em>rutting against him, </em>and crying out, <em>in pleasure???</em> Fingers dug into his back and the sound of harsh breathing echoed around him.</p><p>Shock and rage coursed through Snape as he grabbed at the invisible shoulders and shoved the intruder back, hard. He heard a thud and a whimper as the figure hit the ground, and then saw black shoes and bare ankles. Snape rushed forward and grasped at the fine fabric, pulling away the invisibility cloak to reveal the person beneath. Hairy bare legs ending in black shoes poked out from beneath a Hogwarts school robe. The rest of the figure was huddled on the floor, face hidden behind arms wrapped around a dark head of hair. The figure pulled his legs to his chest, rocking and keening on the cold stone floor.</p><p>Alarmed, Snape bent down, his wand still pointed at the wizard before him.</p><p>“State your name,” Snape declared.</p><p>The figure convulsed on the floor, curling into himself more, with a moan of pain, or was that <em>pleasure?</em>, renting the air. Snape noticed that one of the student’s hands had jerked away from its owner’s face to slide between its owners legs, pressing hard there.</p><p><em>What in the name of Merlin? </em>Snape thought.</p><p>“Look at me!” Snape demanded.</p><p>The huddled mass keened louder, rocking against his own hand. Sobbing.</p><p>Snape opened his mouth to say something when the figure sprung, head down, from the floor and launched himself at Snape. Caught by surprise, Snape was bowled over backwards, landing on his back on the flagstones. Snape’s wand flew from his hand as the figure sprawled on top of him. The student kissed frantically at his neck, rubbing against his thigh like a freaking dog in heat.</p><p>As Snape struggled to push the student off of him, turning his head away from the desperate kisses, he caught the words the student was saying, over and over.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I can’t stop it, I’m sorry, please, I’m sorry.”</p><p>And still narrow hips rubbed against his thigh as the student’s breathing increased. Finally, the student stiffened, cried out, and lay still, breathing heavily.</p><p> “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I can’t help it. I’m sorry.” The words were spoken desperately, between ragged, sobbing breaths.</p><p>Snape grabbed the wizard’s shoulders again, trying to push the student away from him, but the student buried his head in Snape’s neck, wrapped his arms around Snape, and held on for all he was worth.</p><p>“Get off me,” Snape commanded through gritted teeth.</p><p>“I can’t,” the voice cried. “You’ll kill me. “Oh Merlin, you’ll kill me. I’m so sorry. I can’t stop it, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Snape fell back, sweating. “Tell me your name.”</p><p>“I can’t,” the voice whined, occasionally bucking against him and he shuddered.</p><p>Snape heard a sudden noise at the door, a squeak and a gasp. He looked up to see two 7<sup>th</sup> year Ravenclaws standing in his open doorway, their mouths agape. He realized how he must look, laying on his office floor with a student on top of him, a student who was moaning and writhing, as if they were engaged in some lurid sexual behavior. Well, he reasoned, <em>one </em>of them was.</p><p>“McAllister, Sheive, get the Headmaster! And speak NOTHING of this to anyone else.” When the two didn’t move, he shouted, “Go! Now! And lock the damn door behind you!” After they’d scurried off, Snape tried once again to shift the wizard off of him. But the student just held on tighter and sobbed harder.</p><p>The student groaned and started moving against him more urgently.</p><p>“Stop that!” Snape bellowed, trying desperately to shift the rutting student off of him.</p><p>“I can’t,” the voice cried. “I can’t. I’m so sorry. I was cursed. I can’t stop it. I can’t help it.”</p><p>Snape stilled. <em>Cursed? </em>His mind whirred with all the spells he knew. Only one came to mind, a dark curse used by Death Eaters… but no… not here at Hogwarts… no student would know…</p><p>Then two things happened at once. The floo in his office came to life in a flurry of green flames as Albus Dumbledore stepped through. And the student on top of him dug clutched at Snape’s shoulders and jerked into him repeatedly, shouting out as his pleasured himself against Snape’s unwilling body.</p><p>Snape groaned, and <em>not </em>in pleasure, as the Headmaster came to stand over him, the student on top of him still shuddering with the tail end of his release.</p><p>“Severus!” the Headmaster gasped.</p><p>Snape locked eyes with Dumbledore’s shocked and angry ones.</p><p>“Albus,” Snape snapped, his gaze defiant, “this is not in the least what it looks like.” Snape had his hands on the student’s shoulders and was trying to push him off, but the student was like an octopus; his head buried in Snape’s neck, his arms wrapped tightly around Snape’s back.</p><p>“Now, please, get this student OFF of me!” Snape demanded</p><p>The headmaster’s eyes widened. “Who is it?”</p><p>“I. Don’t. Know.” Snape said, still shoving at the student. “He won’t tell me. And he won’t get off of me!”</p><p>The headmaster’s voice took on a commanding edge. “You will release Professor Snape at once, or I will be forced to make you release him.”</p><p>A loud sob sounded, but the student made no move to relocate himself.</p><p>“Very well,” Dumbledore said, and with a flick of his wand, the body atop Snape went rigid.</p><p>Snape quickly rolled the student off of him and scrambled away, grabbing his wand from where it had rolled under his desk. He stood, flinging his sweaty hair from his face, and straightening his disheveled robes as he gazed at the petrified student lying stiffly on his floor, tears streaming down his face as he keened and flung his head from side to side.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I can’t help it. I was cursed. Please. Help me.”</p>
