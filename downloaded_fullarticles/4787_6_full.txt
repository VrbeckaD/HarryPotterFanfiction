    <h2> </h2><p>
  <em>How they met:</em>
</p><p>
  <span>  Voldemort stared at the Potter cottage.  He approached the gate and entered.  James attacked him, and was killed.  Lily attempted to protect Harry, and also lost her life.  Then little Harry, although having the killing curse aimed at him, didn’t die.  Voldemort was torn apart that night, and the wizarding world rejoiced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>  Harry was shocked to see it was Quirrell who was attempting to steal the stone instead of Snape, like he and his friends had thought.  Quirrell stood before the Mirror of Erised, musing to himself about the stone.  He made Harry look into the mirror, and Harry watched as his reflection put the stone in his pocket.  He lied, hoping that Quirrell wouldn’t notice that he had the stone, but the same voice that told Quirrell to use Harry told him to remove the turban.  As the turban fell away, Quirrell turned revealing a chalk white face.  Harry was paralyzed as his emerald green eyes met crimson.  Voldemort asked Harry to join him, but he refused.  Quirrell attempted to kill him, and found he couldn’t touch Harry.  He shriveled into dust.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>  Harry walked into the Chamber a slight tremble to him movements.  He kept walking until a towering statue came into view, a figure with red hair resting at its feet.  Harry ran to Ginny, who laid unconscious on the floor.  Next to her was a diary.  Tom Riddle’s diary.  Harry attempted to wake Ginny when he heard a chuckle behind him.  Tom himself was there\.  He revealed himself to be a younger Voldemort.  Tom then called upon the basilisk and laughed at Harry’s futility.  Fawkes came bringing the sorting hat with him.  Harry faced off with the basilisk, and destroyed the diary.  He and Ron brought Ginny and Lockhart to the teachers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>  While Harry had avoided an encounter with Voldemort, his year had been anything but uneventful.  Chased by a serial killer, who turned out to not only be innocent of the accused crimes, but also Harry’s godfather.  Attacked by dementors for reasons he still didn’t understand.  Taught by a friend of his parents who turned out to be a werewolf.  An attack from Voldemort would be just another layer to an already complicated year.  The only thing he wished had happened differently was his godfather’s escape.  He wished Sirius had been cleared of his crimes, but he had forced to go on the run instead.  He didn’t want to go back to the Dursley's.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How they formed an alliance:</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry struggled against the headstone, trying desperately to get away.  His scar was burning, setting him on edge.  Wormtail continued with his madness not far away attempting to resurrect his master.  He moved over to a small bundle that sat near the gravestone not far away. He picked it up and dropped what appeared to be a shriveled up baby into the cauldron.  He then pointed his wand at the ground beneath Harry. “Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son.” A bone rose from the grave and was thrown into the cauldron bubbling in front of them.  “Flesh of the servant, willingly given, you will revive your master.”  Wormtail took a knife and reluctantly sliced off his hand, dropping it into the potion.  “Blood of the martyr, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your hope.”  Wormtail then turned to Harry the knife still in hand.  He made a shallow cut, enough to take Harry’s blood and added that to the cauldron.    There was a bright flash, and Harry froze at the sight that greeted him.  He watched as a man of reptilian features rose from the cauldron.  Wormtail was whimpering in pain off to the side, holding his stump of an arm.  Voldemort retrieved the robes that lay on the ground next to the pot.  He donned them and turned to face his “sworn enemy.”  He stalked toward Harry, and Harry began to struggle anew.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “This,” Voldemort’s voice held a soft hissing sound that was very much like a snakes, “is the Wizarding World’s saviour.  A child that could be apprehended by one of my most pathetic followers.”  At that moment Wormtail whined again, causing Voldemort to turn towards him.  Wormtail held out his stump of an arm, tears gliding down his face.  Voldemort waved his wand and a silver hand materialized.  Voldemort then turned back to Harry.  “Tell me Potter, why you fight; why you fight for those who repeatedly throw you to the dirt, only to pick you up when they need you?  Why fight for someone who hunts the only father figures you've had in your life?  What motivates you?  Is it foolish hope that your godfather would be cleared of his crimes, or that the werewolf you love so dearly will be able to live among us wizards?  People rarely change Potter, Dumbledore especially.  Why do you follow that old goat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>      “Because, we fight for the greater good,” Harry spat at him, glaring harshly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>      “Oh yes, the ‘greater good’ which sends young children back to abusive homes without so much as a thought towards their safety.”  Harry flinched and Voldemort gave a grim smile, “ surprised I know your secret Potter.  Anyone with eyes would be able to tell you are abused.  Your friends are aware, I assure you, yet instead of doing anything they stood to the side and let it happen.  You have told them of your displeasure of returning ‘home,’ but they continue to send you there for three years now.  They watch you suffer which is the same, if not worse, than committing the act itself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry deflated, all the fight robbed from him by words he knew to be true.  His friends were aware of the abuse, they’d seen the bruises and scars that marred his skin.  They’d noticed how thin he was, and how little he ate; how he flinched when anyone moved towards him, or acted too suddenly.  The boys he roomed with had heard the night terrors.  Despite all that they continued to send him back.  They didn’t protest Dumbledore’s decision, nor did they even seem sorry.  Harry felt tears carving a river down his cheeks, “If not for the greater good, then what do I fight for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Yourself,” Voldemort said simply, “forget those who broke you, and fight your own battles.  Don’t let the Old Goat lead you like a sheep to slaughter.  Fight back, retaliate, don’t listen to those who only see your title, and instead ally yourself with those you who support you.  You’re more slytherin than you know, Potter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “I won’t become one of your Death Munchers,” Harry said, some of the old fire alighting in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Then don’t, become neutral, gather up a group of people you trust and I will vow not to harm those that align themselves with you.  But know that if I make that vow, you must vow to stay neutral and not attack me or my Death Eaters.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “You promise to leave me and mine alone,” Harry said, still skeptical.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Only if you vow the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Deal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Deal.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>When Harry fought back:</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry quickly checked Sirius's pulse, and breathed a sigh of relief to find his godfather alive.  Spells were flying everywhere, greens and reds coming from both sides, that it made it almost impossible to determine who had fired the curse that downed him.  Him and Remus had almost been too late to stop him from falling into the Veil.  In that moment however Harry felt a deep burning hatred for the light side, for it hadn’t been one of the Death Eaters to hit Sirius, they were under a vow not to, but one of the flaming chickens.  Harry wasn’t sure who it was, but when he found out, they were in for a world of trouble.  No one messed with Harry’s family and got away with it.  It was in that moment that Harry snapped.  He was through with being neutral, and he wished for nothing more than to make those who abandoned him suffer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry looked up and locked eyes with Neville and Luna, who were keeping up the farce of fighting the Death Eaters, and gave a quick nod.  Both smiled as they turned to face the true enemy.  Harry and his group of friends had been considering joining the war as their own faction, and now the time had come.  Once Luna and Neville had engaged the Order of the Phoenix members Harry turned to Remus and smiled.  “Ready to join the war father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “I do believe I am son.  For Padfoot?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “For Padfoot.”  At that both Harry and Remus jumped up and started attacking the light side while also defending Sirius’s prone form.  The light was so shocked to see their saviour fighting against them, that many would have died if not for their hastily erected shield charms.  The Order attempted to keep up the fight, but eventually turned tail and ran.  Some foolish Death Eaters attempted to attack Harry and take the prophecy, but were shocked to find that  their spells were doing nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry, and everyone else who had been in the department of mysteries, flooded into the ministry’s atrium.  Voldemort waited for them there, but that wasn’t what shocked Harry.  What shocked Harry was Voldem- Tom’s appearance.  He still had slightly serpentine features in his eyes and pale skin, but besides that seem like any other pureblood lord.  Harry gawked for a moment before composing himself.  He approached Tom with confidence in his step.  He stopped before him and looked him in the eyes, “I want to renegotiate the terms of our vow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “And what do you wish to change, exactly,” Tom said eying him skeptically.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “We want to join the war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “And fight against me?”  Tom seemed as if he was on the edge of a breakdown which was something Harry could feel through the mental link.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “No, against the old fool, but as I said before, we don’t wish to be Death Eaters.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Then what do you offer as collateral?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “This,” Harry said, holding up the prophecy, “you can have this, I don’t care, but me and my friends join the war.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “You do not wish to know what the prophecy foretells?”</span>
</p><p>

  <em>
    <span>When Harry came of age:</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry woke early the morning of July 31st, stretching and yawning as shafts of sunlight lit up his room.  He looked around the elegant room he now called his own.  Not long after Harry had declared his participation in the war he had been abducted at King’s Cross station.  That had been almost two years ago, and Harry had been living comfortably in Riddle Manor ever since.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Only his associates knew his location, and they knew not to share with the Old Coot, who had been killed by Snape two months previous.  So far all of their work had been covert, leaving the light on eggshells regarding this new enemy.  They were slowly gathering information to discredit the light, and deal a major blow to their political stances.  They were also working toward offering sanctuary to those who didn’t want to get caught up in the war.  They led a more defensive stance in the war than the offensive that their opponents put up.  Many thought that Harry’s group was simply an offshoot of death eaters who didn’t wish to torture and kill, but still wished to participate in the war.  No one was aware that Harry Potter was the head of this new faction, nor did they know that his final goal was to tear the ministry down, in order to rebuild it anew.  In this endeavour he was joined by his adopted family and close friends, Remus, Sirius, Hermione, Ginny, the Twins, Luna, Neville, Bill, Charlie, and many others.  Ron hadn’t joined them, because he refused to trust the dark, but he had agreed to go neutral.  It had stung Harry a bit when his best mate refused to join him, but he had been quickly distracted by the war effort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  And today was his 17th birthday, the day he came of age.  Now he could use his magic without alerting the ministry, allowing them to put grander plans into action.  His first course of action was heading to Gringotts to get his accounts in order.  Once that was taken care of he and Sirius was going to evict the Order from Grimmauld Place.  This would leave the Order scrambling as most of them thought Sirius was dead and Harry had been kidnapped by the Dark Lord.  To see the two of them willingly working with the enemy would stump those who hadn't been in the department of mysteries, and shock those who had.  But before all of that, he had to celebrate his coming of age.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry got out of bed and walked towards his wardrobe.  He took out a simple white button up, and black slacks.  He quickly dressed and left to the dining room.  He was greeted by the few of his faction that were staying at Riddle Manor with him, Hermione, The Weasleys that supported him save for Bill and Charlie, Neville, and Luna.  They had all went into hiding when the Order started tracking down those who had been close to Harry.  Sirius and Remus had gotten a place of their own, and Bill and Charlie were working abroad with other wizarding communities.  Tom was away on business, but he had told Harry that he would be their for his coming of age party.  It had taken some time for everyone to get used to living with the Dark Lord, and some still felt uneasy such as Ginny.  She still held a bit of a grudge over what happened in the chamber, but she was slowly forgiving Tom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry and his group went to Magical Paris’s shopping district.  Fleur and Bill joined them in their little pre-celebration.  They had decided to follow wizarding tradition, and have a Coming of Age ceremony in which magic officially acknowledged the wizard or witch’s coming of age, and bestowed them with a little extra power.  The amount of power wasn’t based on blood purity, or status either, it was based on how well magic favored you.  Harry was participating in such a ritual, so as to boost his already powerful magic.  He wasn’t expecting to get much of a boost, but any little bit helped.  Preparations for tonight had already been made including getting an overseer for the ritual, and the tailoring of Harry’s robes.  After a quick lunch at a nice French restaurant, the group returned to the manor to get ready for the ritual.  Afterwards, they planned on throwing a birthday party.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry went to his room to don his ceremonial robes.  The robes were black, with silver runes lining the arms, shoulders, neck and bottom hem.  During the ceremony the runes would activate causing the robes to go from black and silver to white and gold.  The change was meant to symbolize magic's purification of his body and soul.  This ritual would also remove any blocks, compulsions, or potions in his system.  Not many families preformed the ritual anymore because not many people remembered it.  It took days of scouring the library with Hermione to even catch mentions of  it.  They had eventually found a book detailing how to perform the ritual, and after researching the shadier parts decided to put it into action.  They had to teach someone the incantation, so they could have an officiator.  They had decided to have Bill learn the incantation, so he could do the cleansing ritual that the goblins usually did.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry left his room and made his way to the gardens where the ceremony was taking place.  The ceremony had to happen outside at night because the moon’s light was a vital part of the ritual.  The soon-to-be recognized adult is required to hold a moonflower in his or her hands.  The flower had to be picked by a river during the full moon, or the ritual wouldn’t work.  The officiator then has to chant the incantation as the flower is raised towards the moon.  If everything was done right the flower would bloom, but if done wrong Harry and Bill could face serious consequences.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  All of Harry’s friends and family were in the garden, their heads bowed as Harry walked towards Bill.  Bill stood at the center of the garden, where the pathways met at a fountain.  Bill held the moonflower in his hand, and as Harry approached handed it to him.  The flower was white and looked a bit like a star.  Harry took the flower and held it lightly in his palms.  He looked up at Bill and nodded his head, signifying that he was ready.  Bill nodded back and began the chant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>     "Ave mater, si parce momento temporis </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>     Cognoscere volumus nocte una tuis fidelibus tirocinio </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>     Benedicere eos gratiam esse liberum et vincula eorum pati </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>     Mundant animam amet purus diei nati facere </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>     Rogamus autem vos, id est ad agnoscendum et accipiendi Magia mater pueri vestri fidelis”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>  Bill repeated the incantation as Harry raised his hands towards the Moon.  The flower started to react, and bloom unfurling to look more like the moon itself.  At first Harry felt nothing, but then he shuddered as a strange coolness washed over his body.  Shortly after the pain started to build, as blocks and compulsions were broken.  The pain continued to build till Harry felt ready to pass out.  Just as he was about to drop to the ground in a dead faint, the pain stopped as Bill stopped chanting.  Harry immediately fell to the ground, and his friends rushed to help him.  He was starting to feel crowded when Remus told everyone to back off and give him some space.  Remus helped him stand up, and carried him back inside.  Once there Remus sat Harry down and got him a glass of water.  Everyone stood around, hovering nervously.  Harry chuckled before assuring them that he was alright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “But what happened, is this something we need to worry about in the future,” Sirius asked in concern.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “No, if anything this should leave you less to worry about.  I do, however, think the amount of pain you went through is strange,” Bill said doing a quick medical scan over Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry had a hunch that most of the pain had been derived from Tom’s horcrux which was another deception hidden by Dumbledore.  Tom had discovered the small soul shard not long after Harry had started living with him.  It had been tainted with insanity and harmful dark magic, and Tom had found it a miracle that the only side effect of such instability was pain whenever he was near.  Harry had no idea if the soul had been destroyed completely or had been cleansed alongside him.  Tom would be able to confirm if it still existed or not, but as of the moment he had yet to return from whatever issue he had been dealing with that morning.  Now that everyone’s worries had been eased, Harry took a look around the ballroom where his birthday party was being held.  There were several tables and chairs set about, as red and gold streamers hung from the ceiling.  A large cake that was decorated to look like a quidditch field, tiny enchanted fliers included, sat at the center of the snack table with smaller finger foods and sweets surrounding it.  Harry’s friends and family were all in attendance along with a few of Tom’s inner circle.  Those who weren’t there, Tom and the rest of his inner circle, were going to arrive later as they had things that had to be done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  The party got underway, and everyone started to enjoy themselves and forget the scare from earlier.  Presents wouldn’t be opened until everyone had arrived, so everyone entertained themselves by sharing stories from their Hogwarts days, or childhoods.  Several approached Harry with birthday wishes, and teased him over his lack of a love life.  It was about an hour after the festivities had kicked off Tom and the few stragglers who had yet to make it arrived.  The moment Tom arrived Harry approached him, wanting to test the horcrux theory.  Living with Tom hadn’t been easy since every time Tom had gotten too close Harry’s scar had started to burn.  They had found that they could be within three feet of each other before Harry started to feel pain.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry could tell that Tom was slightly curious as to how the ritual went.  Tom stood waiting for Harry to stop, and was shocked when he kept going even after the three feet limit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Tom had been about to voice his doubts of such an action when Harry stopped in front of him, and hugged him tightly.  Tom stood rigid, and looked down at the boy who was snuggling into his chest.  It was no secret that Harry was touch starved, and while he was shy most times, there were the occasional times where Harry was willing to cuddle.  Tom however, hated physical affection and avoided it at all costs.  After two extremely uncomfortable minutes, Harry let go and Tom relaxed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “May I ask what that was for,” Tom asked with a slight glare.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “No pain,” Harry replied pointing to his scar.  Tom seemed interested by that tidbit of info, and after gaining Harry’s permission he searched with his magic to determine the state of his horcrux.  He was relieved to find the horcrux still intact and pleased to realize the dark taint surrounding it had been washed away.  Tom leaned over and placed a light kiss on Harry’s scar causing Harry’s face to light up in a blush.  It had been Tom’s intention to make Harry his when he had found out that the boy carried a shred of his soul.  He had feelings for the boy before then, but the discovery of his horcrux is what brought him to realize them.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Now that everyone had arrived they cut the cake, and got to opening the presents.  Remus and Sirius had went digging through their memories, and gifted Harry with a few of them that had his parents.  Hermione got him books on defence and charms.  Bill got him an earring that blocked most low level curses, hexes, and jinxs.  Charlie got him a book that went in depth about all the different dragon species, as well as dragonhide armour.  Luna had gotten him a book on courtship rituals which confused most people in the room.  Luna just patted Harry on the head with the same dreamy look as always.  Neville had gotten him Moonseed, a plant that looked like the crescent moon.  Neville said that it was the main ingredient in Moonseed poison which was able to put someone into a deep sleep through just skin contact.  Ginny had gotten him a broom repair kit, several books on quidditch, and a promise for a match at a later date.  The Twins had gifted him with several joke products that would never be sold in their stores.  Most of Tom’s inner circle got him sweets and candies.  Tom himself promised to give Harry his gift later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  It wasn’t much longer until people started heading home and turned in for the night.  Harry himself wanted to curl up in his bed and sleep until noon, but Tom held him back waiting for everyone to leave them alone.  Luna was the last to leave and she hugged Harry telling him to accept saying he would find true happiness that way, before leaving shutting the doors behind her.  Once she had gone, Tom approached Harry and brought him back out to the gardens.  Once there Tom turned to Harry, and held his hands placing something in the palm of Harry’s right hand.  Harry looked down at the item to see it was a snake bracelet.  It was made of a gold like material with rubies and emeralds inlaid about its circumference.  It looked as if it would wrap around the wrist two to three times while the head appeared to be a hinged mechanism.  Harry gently pried open the snake's mouth to see a tiny timepiece inlaid in its mouth.  Harry was admiring the beautiful piece of jewelry when he felt Tom lift his chin up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Both stared into each other’s eyes as Tom began to speak.  “Harry, are you aware of how wizarding courtships work?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “The interested party presents the intended with a gift and a declaration of their intentions.”  Sirius had been teaching Harry the basics to being a Lord, so he wasn’t left in the dark on his seventeenth birthday.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  “Correct, and I wish to state my intentions to court you Harry James Potter.  We may have started out as enemies, but we have recently become allies.  As of such, I could no longer ignore you, nor claim my feelings to be of hatred or spite.  I found myself attracted to you, my equal in all.  So much so that I found it hard to wait for this day to come.  I have been waiting to court you for awhile now my little snake.  I feared that someone else would come and steal you from me even though you have cut yourself off from the wizarding world.  Now that I can finally ask without condemnation, will you be mine my lion?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry was speechless, he’d never felt such love or devotion from one person before.  Yes, Sirius and Remus, as well as all of his other friends, loved him, but not like Tom does.  Harry felt tears in the corners of his eyes, he had started developing feelings for Tom during his stay at the manor.  The man had been nothing but kind and he didn’t set any restrictions on Harry allowing him to do as he wished.  Even though they had the three feet restriction before, Tom had never failed to notice Harry or include him in discussions whether they pertained to the war or not.  Harry smiled before hugging Tom.  He pulled back and looked Tom in the eyes, “I accept your courtship.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How they won the war:</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry climbed over the rubble that used to be the Ministry of Magic’s fountain.  All around wizards and witches were fighting, both sides trying to overtake the other.  Harry wore the armour and earring that the two eldest Weasley’s had given him.  His holly wand was clutched tightly in his right-hand looking for his boyfriend through the chaos.  He had been about to jump back into the fray when a stray severing charm cut into his left calf.  He cried out in pain and fell to his knees.  He turned to cast a healing charm when he noticed Mad-eye Moody climbing the rubble towards him.  He cast a blasting charm at him, but Moody threw up a strong shielding charm to protect himself from the blast.  The blasting charm had made the rubble pile unstable, but Moody kept climbing anyways.  Harry tried crawling backwards, but ended up tumbling part-way down the pile getting dirt and debri in the wound.  Harry tried to stand up, but stopped when he felt a presence above him.  Harry looked up slowly to see that Moody had caught up with him, and was now standing above him.  Harry could see the killing curse coming off his lips when a green light suddenly knocked Moody out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  Harry sat there staring at Moody’s lifeless corpse when he was suddenly enveloped in the strong arms of his boyfriend.  Tom picked him up and started ushering him towards the few others of their side that had been incapacitated and were being seen to by healers when a sudden blasting charm went off to their right.  Harry was knocked over and a particularly large piece of debri landed on his injured leg.  He cried out once again as Tom shot up and fired a curse towards the ones who harmed his intended.  If Harry had been able to he would have gotten up to help Tom, but at the moment he could barely even stand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>  All they needed was for the Ministry to surrender then Tom could capture the remaining order members.  The order itself was still going strong, but the Ministry was weakening.  The aurors refused to use the killing curse and as of such they were falling much faster.  It wouldn’t be long before those who were still putting up a fight left leaving the Ministry in the hands of the victor.  Already Tom and Harry could see that the aurors were fleeing starting with a small trickle then growing into a great wave of wizards that were apparating out of the atrium.  Now all that was left was taking care of the order then they’d have truly won the war.  Tom set some of his most trusted Death Eaters on the job of tracking the few order members that slipped away while he picked up Harry and brought him to the healers.  Tom already knew that the next couple of months would be chaotic.</span>
