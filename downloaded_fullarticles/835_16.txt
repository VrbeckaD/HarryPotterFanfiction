    <p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Draco Malfoy suspiciously eyed the small package on the table in the Slytherin Common Room. A few other eighth years had been awake, but since it was addressed to Draco, no one had dared to open it. Sitting down on the smooth green couch in front of the present, Draco looked at it from every angle. It had been carefully wrapped and whoever had sent it, wasn’t the person to use too much cello tape, but still enough so it stayed closed until someone would open it.</p><p>“Does it say who sent it?” Draco asked, taking out his wand to cast a spell on it to see whether or not some weird magic was radiating off of it. Nothing.</p><p>Frowning, he grabbed it and shook it slightly. No noises reached the outside of the gift. Pansy Parkinson sat down next to him, clearly overexcited over what this weird present might be.</p><p>“Well, open it!” she pressured him and almost seemed to want to take it out of his hands.</p><p>Draco smirked over her enthusiasm and decided to act on her wish. Carefully, he slid his finger between the overlapping green paper and loosened the cello tape, before unwrapping the whole box as cautiously as he could.</p><p>Inside, there was a box filled with bubble wraps, which he gave to Gregory Goyle, and under said thing he found a brown miniature house of sorts with an almost familiar magical signature all around it. As soon as he touched it to get it out of the box, a soft bell sounded and a gray miniature donkey with dark grey stripes over its back appeared in front of the house.</p><p>“Merlin’s beard, this is beautiful!”</p><p>Pansy seemed to be taken away by this thing. She was about to touch it, but Draco felt a lot of jealousy inside his stomach. This was <em>his</em> present!  So he grabbed it and held it away from Pansy’s presence. She seemed to realize that she shouldn’t do anything to it and so she stopped, but smiled at him.</p><p>“Do you know who sent it to you?” Blaise Zabini asked, as he sat down next to Draco, looking at the house – but not touching it.</p><p>Draco looked into the box again and found a letter. He cast another spell on it, however, whoever sent this present was a rather skilled witch (or wizard) as even though he felt a magical signature, the identity remained sealed.</p><p>He opened the letter and found a beautiful handwriting. Sighing, he showed it to Blaise and Pansy, who both shook their heads. This was magical writing, which you could not use to identify the person having written it.</p><p>However, that was another unintentional clue, the sender was giving Draco. This was a rather specific spell, which was only written in one book. If he could look at who took said book, he could possibly find out who did it.</p><p>Finally, he decided to read the rather short letter.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>Dear Draco Lucius Malfoy</p>
  <p>In the Muggle World, there are things called Advent Calendars: Every day closer to Christmas, you open a door, get a present or do something fun. As you may not have realized my interest in your person, I have decided to show my admiration for you through said Advent Calendar.</p>
  <p>Every day, you will receive another figure for this stable (which is showing the scenery of how baby Jesus was born).</p>
  <p>By the way, Draco: I know you will be trying to find out who sent this gift. But don’t worry: I have been working on this thing ever since I came back to Hogwarts. All the spells are on point and everything that could give away my person is destroyed. On the 24th, however, there will be a clue.</p>
  <p>I hope you’ll like it.</p>
  <p>-An Admirer</p>
