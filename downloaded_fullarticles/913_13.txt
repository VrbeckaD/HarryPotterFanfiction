    <p>Merula sat curled up, knees to the side, on her cushioned armchair, reading. Always reading, always learning. The hearth fire cackled beside her, enveloping her left half with a little-bit-too-much-but-still-lovely kind of warmth. Violet eyes swam across the page, fully engrossed in the contents of her parent's old books. Knowledge was power, after all.</p><p>Her mother sat across from her, wand in hand, eyes never leaving the Dark Mark. Bags had grown under her eyes, made all the more apparent by frayed hair and a pale complexion. A shattered reflection of the woman she used to be.</p><p>They had moved quite a number of times over the last two years. It was always a bother. Pack up, move here, barely settle, pack up again, move again. Again-and-again-and-again-and-again. It was isolating. Infuriating. Why couldn't they just pick a place and stay there? Any attempt at figuring out why was met with aversion.</p><p>But Merula wasn't stupid. Even at her age – ten and a half, so close to her letter! – she put two-and-two together:</p><p>Aurors.</p><p>It was always Aurors. </p><p>It had been Aurors in Canterbury. Aurors in Salisbury. Aurors in Chichester! Every time they'd found somewhere to call home, the Ministry's Aurors would get too close and they'd have to leave. It was all so tiresome. No wonder her mother was always on edge, constantly staring blankly at the faded tattoo on the underside of her forearm as if it would change.</p><p>The death of the Dark Lord – Voldemort, whatever… who even cares about a name? – changed her mother and father. Long gone were the days of snowflake making and broomstick flying. She missed those days.</p><p>A soundless curse escaped Merula's lips as she finally realized she'd been reading the same sentence over-and-over while lost in her train of thought. The heat prickled her skin as she changed positions. Knowledge is power and power is everything. With power, she'd never have to worry about the Aurors ever again.</p><p>BAM!</p><p>Both Merula and her mother snapped to attention, their eyes and bodies – and a faintly green-glowing wand – squared at the front door. There stood the bloody and breathless visage of the Snyde patriarch. His paleness matched that of his wife's now as his body slumped hard against the soft-white of the door, smearing it with a hand-print of deep crimson.</p><p>“They're here,” he managed to expel.</p><p>Reality crashed over the ten-and-a-half year-old. Her teeth clenched and her fists balled, her parent's book tumbling out of her lap. Again. Again, again, again, again, again. Again? Her anger coalesced amidst a melting pot of underdeveloped thoughts and feelings. Grief, fear, anxiety, sadness, confusion– a whirlwind that threatened to knock her off her feet.</p><p>“Merula!” </p><p>It was her mother.</p><p>The little witch blinked. Everything was happening so quickly. Why? Why must the world move so quickly?</p><p>“Merula, come. We must go.”</p><p>Listen to her, Merula. Get up! Move! The girl got up without a word and took her mother's hand. They strode towards the back door to find her father already there with one hand holding it open, his wild, bloodshot eyes canvassing the room behind them, wand at the ready. Could never be too careful with Aurors.</p><p>Another pang of anxiety twisted Merula's gut. They'd evaded the Ministry so many times before, but never like this: never with conflict… always just one step ahead of them. This was different. Uncertain. Her mother's hand squeezed tightly now, far more than any time before. This was different. Wrong. Her father's voice pierced the night– loud but muffled; a shout heard, but unintelligible. This was different. </p><p>This was it.</p><p>A wave of hot air billowed from behind the Snyde family as a force blasted Merula and her mother to the ground. Cindering splinters and shards of the front door cascaded across the living room. A foul ringing dulled Merula's senses. Her parent's words became muted, the world around her dulled. Powerless… this is powerlessness. It strangled her; voice straining, crying… pleading. Violet eyes twisted, desperately searching for confirmation. Every second stretched into infinity and Merula could do nothing but watch through the smoke and the sparks and the screams. </p><p>Powerless. </p><p>Tendrils of magic flashed overhead, illuminating the floor green-to-red-to-yellow-to-blue-- a rainbow of destruction. Merula crawled – crawled! How utterly useless – out into the open. Was the room always so small? She peered up at her parents slinging spells and chucking curses. With the world as slow as it was, Merula could make out the spittle and the dust and the smoke… and it terrified her.</p><p>No. No, no, no. No! NO! Mum, dad… stop! Stop fighting! They're just going to kill you.</p><p>Kill.</p><p>It was so… easy.</p><p>Merula simply stared into oblivion as the vivid, emerald bolt soared across the room towards the front door. It carried intent, she noted. Intent to destroy; to obliterate. To kill. And it did so with unabashed ease. A shroud in the doorway – shroud? Auror; enemy – slumped down like one of those silly Muggle dolls tossed to the side by a bored child. Good riddance.</p><p>Then sound returned to the Snydeling, and she could hear the wanton hatred emanating from the choke point that was her front door. The door itself had been blown off its hinges and several holes and impact craters littered the walls surrounding it. The skirmish, though small, was damaging, and Merula could see her father beginning to slow. From the way he moved and breathed, her father was losing the war of attrition… and everybody in the Snyde Family knew it.</p><p>There was no time for tears.</p><p>The back door burst open for the flank. More shrouds – more Aurors – flooded in, wands up, spells precise. Merula's father, exasperated, fell first. The magical rope slithered around his arms, torso, waist, and finally his legs. He was already toppling over before her mother could even turn to face the new threat, eyes wild with fury. She met with a powerful, concussive force and flew, spinning, across the room, slumping into a heap on the carpet as more Aurors made to secure her.</p><p>Merula froze, her parent's screams blood-curdling and brimming with vitriol. Even now, in spite of it all, they praised their dead Dark Lord. But they were her parents… and had to do something. Move, Merula! </p><p>Power. Control that power. She'd always been in control, her knowledge had forged that control over the years. Hardly any witches and wizards her age could do that, but she was special. The Most Powerful Witch. Now she had to throw it all away and lose control. Anger was power. Her untapped, unrestrained well of magic churned like a torrent. Yes… now this was what she sought. The house shook and all the Aurors paused, cautious. The debris of the previous battle – now the instruments of her fury – began to float with Merula as she rose to her feet. </p><p>Kill.</p><p>It would be so… easy…</p><p>But there was nothing. The rage was there at the tip of her fingers, so close… so tantalizingly and painstakingly close, yet out of reach. Merula felt her body become instantaneously rigid – arms to side, knees together – and she collapsed to the ground just like her father had before her. She dared to scream and struggle, but both her voice box and her limbs remained locked in place. Not even the tears would come. She failed… her was power a pin-prick; a mere inconvenience to the Aurors. So professional. It was sickening. What kind of person specialized in destroying families? From her peripheral vision, Merula watched in silent horror as her parents were dragged away in shackles. She watched them struggle and kick and yell like wild animals and wished so desperately she could do the same. </p><p>If only she could scream… from the bottom of her heart… at the top of her lungs. With all her soul.</p><p>Minutes stretched on into a seemingly endless oblivion-- a nightmare made real. The only things that kept the frozen, little witch company was her thoughts amidst the silence: the regret, the guilt, the pain, loneliness, sadness, despair, anxiety. It was all too much for her. The only way Merula could process it was to let it fester and coagulate into something she couldn't understand except for the fact that her parents were gone.</p><p>It's my fault. No, it's the Auror's fault!</p><p>The Dark Lor-- Voldemort's to blame. Mum and dad are to blame.</p><p>I was too weak. No, they were too weak!</p><p>The cycle of blame kept flowing at a fine churn, as though grinding wheat into flour. It hurt. Choked. Embittered. None of it made any sense to the ten-and-a-half-year-old, and yet… it somehow made total sense. </p><p>Eventually, movement came back to Merula and she returned to her chair by the fire which had long ago turned to cinders. Chin tucked into knees, her eyes hovered from the sprawled book to where her mother sat, then to the front door – now a gaping maw for moonlight – and finally to where her parents faced bitter defeat. </p><p>She was too tired now, and the tears wouldn't come.</p>
