    <p>Fred and George Weasley's shop in Diagon Alley couldn't have been more of a success if they had tried. Their sense of humor was channeled through the various toys, knick knacks, and pranking products and shined bright in such a dark time for the wizarding world. Evil had been infecting every place that had once been lively and joyous, Diagon Alley being no stranger to the virus. In fact, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes was the only shop that was still open .</p>
<p>Hogwarts students flooded through the shop during their last week of freedom. School supply lists had been checked off and all that was left was to buy a few laughs before the term began.</p>
<p>"How much for this?" Ron asked his twin brothers that stood on the staircase leading to the second floor of the shop.</p>
<p>"5 galleons," they answered in unison.</p>
<p>"Well, how much for me?" Ron asked, disappointment running across his face.</p>
<p>"5 galleons," the twins confirmed.</p>
<p>"But I'm your brother."</p>
<p>They both shrugged. "10 galleons."</p>
<p>Their sister Ginny and family friend Hermione Granger were looking through the various displays throughout the shop, weaving their way in and out of the people that were crowding the floor. Harry Potter was at the other end of the store, looking through the various items for sale, particularly the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.</p>
<p>As the twins stood on the landing between the first and second floor, George said to Fred, "Freddie, we actually did it."</p>
<p>"I know, Georgie, I know."</p>
<p>He gazed below and watched all of their eager patrons leave with bags full of goodies. Something peculiar caught his eye, though: a red headed girl kneeling down to help a young boy pick out a product. He watched as her face was nearly as excited as the boy's as she showed him several different things off of the shelf. He was nearly convinced that the boy was somehow related, a cousin or brother, until the boy's mother walked over and thanked the girl for helping her son. The two left, the giant grin apparent on the boy's face as he held his package with great elation.</p>
<p>"Georgie," he called to his brother.</p>
<p>George walked over from the other side of the landing and leaned against the railing next to Fred. "Yes?"</p>
<p>"You ever thought that we could use some help around here?"</p>
<p>"Thought never crossed my mind."</p>
<p>Fred watched the girl with some intensity, tracking her movement through the crowd. She was now at the register and paying her total.</p>
<p>"Should we start hiring? And  you have about 10 seconds to decide."</p>
<p>George looked down at the crowd trying to spot what Fred was seeing. "I swear to god, Fred, if this is a scheme to pick up a girl I swear I'll–"</p>
<p>"Promise it's not."</p>
<p>George rolled his eyes. "Fine. She better be good."</p>
<p>Fred's trademark grin to his brother was there and gone in a flash, Fred jogging as quickly and coolly down the stairs to intercept the girl as she walked from the register to the door.</p>
<p>The girl was lost in her own thoughts, thinking about how her brother would enjoy all of the pranks and knick knacks she had bought for him. In all honesty, she knew not everything in her bag was for him. What good was a pranking war if you supplied everything to the enemy? She always kept good things for herself. The excuse to her brother was that if he wanted good ammo, he should go with her to the shop.</p>
<p>His excuse for not going always led back to wanting to go with his friends. Not being seen with his older sister was another reason, though. He was in his "I don't want people to know we're related" stage.</p>
<p>As her mind was lost in thinking about her brother, she didn't realize that she was being blocked from leaving. She immediately crashed into someone, knocking her backwards so that she landed on the floor. A space had cleared as she fell, but as she regained her orientation, she saw the figure waving everyone off as to say it was okay. The hustle and bustle of the store continued as it had prior, not missing a beat.</p>
<p>"So sorry, ma'am," the figure apologized, a hand reaching out to help her.</p>
<p>She propped herself up and held her head, willing the pain to go away. "Shouldn't block people from where they're going like that."</p>
<p>"And maybe some people should pay attention to where they're walking. I was standing here for a good amount of time."</p>
<p>She looked up to see a fiery head of red hair attached to a very well dressed man. His smile was happy and somewhat apologetic, his hand still extended to assist her up. She took it reluctantly, the man bringing her to her feet and helping collect her items from the floor.</p>
<p>He looked over her items.</p>
<p>She wondered what was going through his mind as he inspected her haul.</p>
<p>"All this for you?" he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head. "My brother loves all of these products. He's gotten in trouble a few times at home because he's used them on our mum. Never stops him from buying them."</p>
<p>"Or you from buying them for him."</p>
<p>She shrugged with a smirk. "I see no difference."</p>
<p>The man chuckled. "The name's Fred Weasley."</p>
<p>The girl smiled as she offered her hand for a handshake. "Clarissa Caxton. This is your shop?"</p>
<p>Fred took the girl's hand and shook it gently, and nodded. "You like it?"</p>
<p>She nodded, starting to look overhead and around the shop. "I love it, almost as much as my brother does."</p>
<p>He nodded, joining in her gaze. "It's me and my brother's baby, I must say."</p>
<p>She brought her focus back to the man in front of her. "You and your brother have done a great thing by opening this place. I can't tell you how many of my brother's friends can't stop talking about the things they get here and how much fun they have."</p>
<p>Fred laughed in appreciation. "Seems like you're just as intrigued by all of this stuff. It's okay – it's not just for the young ones."</p>
<p>She laughed. "Oh yes, I know. I've always seen this shop as more for the…young at heart."</p>
<p>He  nodded in response. "Not to be creepy or anything, but I saw you helping out a young boy earlier. What was that about?"</p>
<p>She thought back a moment, trying to pin point what Fred was talking about. "Oh, the one who bought the Puking Pasties?"</p>
<p>Fred nodded with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Well, he was trying to find a good treat to give to his older brother. It was more of a 'he got me and I want to get him back' kind of purchase. His mom was a good sport about it. He couldn't decide what he wanted so I helped him out."</p>
<p>"Did you know him?"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "But I've been on the receiving end of some of these pranks, so I figured I'd give him a good recommendation."</p>
<p>He laughed. "You're not in any rush, are you?"</p>
<p>Clarissa shrugged. "I told mum I'd be home to help with dinner. Apparating makes the journey right quick, though."</p>
<p>"I don't want to keep you long. Let me walk you out."</p>
<p>Clarissa smiled in appreciation as Fred stepped aside so she could lead them out of the shop.</p>
<p>As they stepped out, the warmth and joy from inside, unfortunately, didn't follow. The run down look of the alley always made Clarissa feel sad. She remembered when she was a young student and how vibrant the alley had once been. Seeing places like Ollivander's run down and closed made her heart ache.</p>
<p>"It's a shame," she said, gazing down the alley.</p>
<p>"It'll be back eventually," Fred reassured, standing next to his newfound companion.</p>
<p>She nodded. "Well, Mr. Weasley, I appreciated this little chat." She looked up at him with a smile. "I'm sure this isn't the last you'll be seeing of me."</p>
<p>He smiled. "Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I have a proposal for you."</p>
<p>"So soon? My dear man, we've just met."</p>
<p>Fred laughed, a little heartier than he had realized, causing Clarissa to chuckle and break her serious character for a moment.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sure this will be a proposal you won't deny."</p>
