<p align="JUSTIFY">It was war, plain and simple. The exhaustion from it was there, but the strong will to win as well. Hermione woke up with a start, immediately alert and in tune with her environment. Long were gone the lazy lie-ins of the past when she could burrow under the covers at her leisure. Instead, she withdrew her wand from beneath the pillow where she had safely put it the previous evening, a habit that was now ingrained in her. She had never been better at casting Shielding Charms in the blink of an eye – even in a semi-conscious state – as she was now.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">No one had seen it coming. It had started small, slowly escalating to the outward conflict it was for almost a year now. She had tried to stop it, to make them see reason and put some sense into them, but there was so much words could do. Hermione had had to resolve to actions, but things had only gone worse from there. She was at her wits' end and had had enough of it. She could barely function as a human being anymore, always looking behind her shoulder and starting at every loud noise or unexpected movement. She thought that all they had fought for and against in the Second War had to allow them to live their lives peacefully – she had to be right. She had never been fond of camping, after all. It shouldn't have been in vain.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">That was without considering her choice of roommates after said War was over. What else could she have expected, renting a flat with three of her former Gryffindor friends and the same number of their old Slytherin nemesis ? Yet, after the dust had settled on the corpse of Lordy Voldypants, they had (almost) all made peace and buried the hatchet. After the celebrations, this newfound energy that filled them to the brim had to find a productive outlet. Therefore, they had all found a new purpose in their lives, embracing their renowned or unheard-of passions in this new era where all seemed possible. However, they had to face the harsh reality of the grown-up world : housing wasn't free, and bills had to be paid every month. That's how they had all joyfully come to the brilliant idea of becoming roommates instead of living separately by themselves, all working in the same madly expensive city named London.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Gryffindors now inhabiting 82 Jermyn Street did not consist of the infamous Golden Trio. Ron Weasley, bless his soul, had concocted an improved (read 'alcoholic') recipe of good old pumpkin juice during the festivities that followed the end of the War, making him obscenely rich after it was patented and allowing him escape to Bora Bora with his childhood sweetheart, Lavender Brown, now Weasley. Word was they were already on their way to produce a small army of red-heads of their own. Instead, it was Evil-Snake-Slayer Neville Longbottom who joined their merry band. Being of the opinion that he had had enough epic adventures to last him a lifetime, he had created his own company as an extraordinary landscape architect, allowing him to keep close to his beloved plants. Harry Potter, Him-Who-Lived-To-Die-To-Live-Again, was blissfully in love with Ginny Weasley, who was a chaser for the Tutshill Tornadoes and would soon launch her first collection as a broom designer. He himself was in training to become a Quidditch Referee, playing reserve seeker for the Falmouth Falcons in the meantime.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Their Slytherin additions included Draco Malfoy, now an apprentice Healer at St Mungo's who had been withdrawn his family inheritance following his father's trial and incarceration in now Dementor-free Azkaban. He was joined by Pansy Parkinson, a rising Real Estate agent for Gringott's, and Blaise Zabini, who was now a famous Hit Wizard.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Living together allowed them to afford a very nice duplex in center London, in which each had their own bedroom – except for Harry and Ginny – and shared an airy and large living space. They all lived happily for a couple of months, being close to their respective jobs while staying away from the Wizarding press by being located in Muggle London. They had however updated the flat with magic as soon as they had moved in, placing strong wards, connecting the Floo and sound-proofing each bedroom for the sake of everyone. In retrospect, it couldn't have stayed that way for long, Hermione thought. The rivalry was ingrained in them, especially but not only in the boys, and even if they had made peace, they still had to keep some friendly banter between them in order not to go barmy. Now, she was the one going slowly but certainly insane with the situation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It had all started with Neville. Yes, you would say, easy to lay the blame at Poor-Shy-Little-Neville's feet. Nonetheless, when he came back home with a new plant for a client's garden, said plant was not a cute and inoffensive little peony as they all thought. When Pansy had tried to water it, the flower revealed itself to have a strong mind of its own when it chomped half of her hair, dying the other one in a sickly yellow-green. Pansy had screeched as if Voldie-kins had come back in a swimsuit, waking those who had had a late shift and giving everyone in the house a splendid view of what would without a doubt be a must-have hairstyle in 2170.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After that, it was only a matter of days, during which Pansy had taken an emergency Portkey to Paris looking for a <em>coiffeur</em> that would be skilled enough to repair the damage, before she retaliated. She had charmed Neville's gardening tools to become bright pink and glittery for a week – he hadn't minded as much as was expected, and even secretly re-charmed some of them, as Hermione later discovered. Things had calmed down for a fortnight until Ginny was presented with new products from WWW to test. After Draco had inadvertently eaten an Extra Supra Hot Gelato instead of his regular vanilla ice cream specially reserved for the late munchkins – and once again screamed the whole house awake – things went straight to hell. Teams were formed, first the Slytherins who were persuaded that a conspiracy against them was brewing, then Harry and Ginny of course. Neville and Hermione desperately tried to stay out of it at first, but as mentioned before, they had no choice but to defend themselves.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The pranks shifted from the benign WWW candies (Harry) that everyone quickly learned to avoid to the unexpected Shrunk-hippogriff in the bedroom (Blaise). That one had taken them all four hours to clean up, after they were able to calm Neville down after he had woken up to the noise. Mind you, the pranks were never mean. They were all still getting along quite well with each other, forming close friendships. Hermione speculated that after the adrenaline of the War, they still needed something to keep them on their tiptoes. And at first, it was fun. She fondly remembered when Neville had redecorated Blaise's room as a magical forest complete with toadstools in retaliation, while performing the amazing feat of not waking the light-sleeping Hit Wizard. He was hard-pressed to change it back to its original state and kept the lounge part of his bedroom as Neville had made it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">But now, it was every second that they had to be ready. After waking to her books organized counter-alphabetically, Hermione had had enough and put her mind to strategy. Once she had re-ordered her books, and not before strongly warding her library until further notice, she hit hard where it hurt. Harry was her first target. He should have known better than to touch her sacred books and realized just that when his whistle made a very un-manly kitty meow on the Quidditch Pitch. After his trainer had rolled over in laughter at his expense for a good ten minutes – when trying to revert the charm, it only made a different cute animal sound – he vowed never to prank Hermione again. Well, never to target her books again at the very least. Still, she was in the game, and therefore as much a potential target of the overt Prank War as the other inhabitants of 82 Jermyn Street.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Lately, Hermione avoided the battlefield as much as humanly possible, seeking refuge where she could be remotely safe. Working as a Junior Graphic Designer for <em>The Quibbler</em>, which had been taken over by Luna Lovegood, and writing books for children in her spare time, she needed to be in a quiet and calm environment. The madhouse was clearly not a place where she could focus solely on her work at the moment and she had a deadline for this month's edition of <em>The Quibbler</em>. So, she changed from her pajamas to a comfy and warm long charcoal knitted dress, a leather jacket and a pair of knee-high heeled boots. Putting her hair in a messy bun and grabbing her purse, she side-stepped a discarded Fanged Frisbee and made for the door as fast and quietly as possible. It was only seven in the morning, and the others were either still at work (Draco and Blaise) or in bed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">She paid little attention to where she was heading until she realized upon apparating at Diagon Alley that it was very early and few shops were even lit, never mind open to costumers. She kept walking until she found herself almost at the end of the street. Wondering if she should be heading to Muggle London despite needing to perform magic for what she had to work on, her eyes fell on a new establishment at the very end of the alley, squeezed between a broomstick retailer and a small park with a magical play-area that was usually packed during the day. The building in question seemed to have opened not too long ago, Hermione thought as she had never seen it before and noticed the grey and taupe fresh paint. A sign that read 'Caffeinated Brews' was hanging above large glass windows. Through them, Hermione could see comfortable-looking sofas and chairs neatly organized around low wood tables decorated with candles of all sizes and types. The lights were on, and though she couldn't see anyone inside, the sign at the door clearly said it was open. Quickly making her mind, she pushed the door and entered the small coffee.</p>
