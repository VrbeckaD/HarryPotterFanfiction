    <p>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.</p><p>‘Hogwarts, dear?’ she said, when Harry started to speak. ‘Got the lot here – another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.’</p><p>In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool in the middle of having long, black robes pinned up. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped another long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length.</p><p>‘Hullo,’ said the boy, ‘Hogwarts too?’</p><p>‘Yes,’ said Harry, trying not to wobble so much on the stool. He didn’t want to embarrass himself at Hogwarts before he even got there.</p><p>‘My father’s next door buying my books and Mother’s up the street looking at wands,’ said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. ‘Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first-years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully Father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.’</p><p>Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley until he noticed Madam Malkin move a pin too far too the left and saw the boy flinch and pull the most un-Dudley-like face Harry had ever seen. The boy caught Harry’s eye and went red, turning his face away and trying to move on valiantly.</p><p>“Have <em>you </em>got your own broom?’ the boy asked.</p><p>‘No,’ said Harry.</p><p>‘Play Quidditch at all?’</p><p>‘No,’ Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.</p><p>‘<em>I </em>do – Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?’</p><p>‘No,’ said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. The way this boy spoke it seemed Harry wouldn’t get through five minutes at Hogwarts before they kicked him out.</p><p>‘Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been – imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?’</p><p>‘Mmm,’ said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting or at least stop feeling like a complete prat compared to the blonde boy.</p><p>‘I say, look at that man!’ said the boy suddenly, nodding towards the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice-creams to show he couldn’t come in.</p><p>‘That’s Hagrid,’ said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. ‘He works at Hogwarts.’</p><p>‘Oh,’ said the boy, ‘I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?’</p><p>‘He’s the gamekeeper,’ said Harry. He was liking this boy less and less.</p><p>‘Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of <em>savage </em>– lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed.’</p><p>‘I think he’s brilliant,’ said Harry coldly.</p><p>‘<em>Do </em>you?’ said the boy with a slight sneer. ‘Why is he with you? Where are your parents?’</p><p>‘They’re dead,’ said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.</p><p>‘Oh, sorry,’ said the other, not sounding sorry at all. He seemed distracted as he watched a man walk up beside the shop window. ‘But they were <em>our </em>kind, weren’t they?’</p><p>‘They were a witch and a wizard if that’s what you mean.’</p><p>‘I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?’</p><p>But before Harry could answer, the bell above the door to the shop rung as a tall, imposing man walked in. He was carrying a cane and had long white-blonde hair almost exactly like the boy next to Harry.</p><p>‘Draco, I told you to be done by now. You needn’t be wasting time being fitted for casual robes,’ the tall man admonished immediately and then turned abruptly to Madam Malkin, ‘Take these away,’ he said, dismissively shoving the blue and purple robes that had been piled next to the boy at Madam Malkin.</p><p>‘Father, please,’ the boy, Draco, said quietly, the drawl having completely left his voice. He was pointedly not looking at Harry. He seemed embarrassed. Harry couldn’t picture Draco actually bullying his father into buying him anything.</p><p>‘No Draco,’ the man’s voice was like ice. ‘Malfoy’s uphold tradition. You would look practically Muggleborn in that common fashion they sell to lesser stock.’ His lip curled at this as he glanced around the room, as though daring Madam Malkin to speak. As he did so, his cold stare finally found Harry.</p><p>‘And who do we have here,’ the man leered. Draco looked back at Harry finally and said quietly.</p><p>‘He’s another first year like me, father.’</p><p>‘Oh, dear,’ the father eyed the too large, torn jeans poking out the bottom of the robes draped on Harry. ‘This one really does dress like a <em>Muggle</em>.’ The man spat the last word out like a curse. ‘Come on Draco, your robes can be delivered. We won’t have you associating with mudbloods.’ The man swept around sharply, shoved a card at Madam Malkin, and then headed for the door, not deigning to look at Harry a moment longer.</p><p>Harry had no idea what mudblood meant but the man had said it with such hatred that he knew it had to be very bad.</p><p>‘Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,’ the boy said softly, before he stepped off his footstool and out of his robes. He seemed to take a moment, standing very still before turning to walk past Madam Malkin, raising his pointed chin in the air once again and attempting to resume his earlier bored demeanour.</p><p>‘Get out of the way, you oaf,’ Harry heard Draco’s father hiss at Hagrid as he stormed from the shop, Draco trailing behind. Harry caught Hagrid’s eye and wondered what on earth had just happened.</p><p>That’s you done, my dear,’ Madam Malkin said quietly and Harry shakily got down from the footstool as she started packing up his things.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice-cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).</p><p>‘What’s up?’ said Hagrid.</p><p>‘Nothing,’ Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed colour as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, ‘Hagrid what’s Quidditch?’</p><p>‘Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know – not knowin’ about Quidditch!’</p><p>‘Don’t make me feel worse,’ said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.</p><p>‘ – and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in –'</p><p>‘Yer not <em>from </em>a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh <em>were </em>– he’s grown up knowin’ yer name, and if his father is Lucius Malfoy, he would’ve heard it more than most! All wizardin’ folk know yeh  –  you saw ‘em in the Leaky Cauldron. Anyway, what do they know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles – look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!’</p><p>‘So what <em>is </em>Quidditch?’</p><p>‘It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like – like football in the Muggle world – everyone follows Quidditch – played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls – sorta hard ter explain the rules.’</p><p>‘And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?’</p><p>‘School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but –'</p><p>‘I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,’ said Harry gloomily.</p><p>‘Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,’ said Hagrid darkly. ‘There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one. That nasty piece o’ work Lucius Malfoy was as well.’</p><p>‘Vol – sorry – You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?’</p><p>‘Years an’ years ago,’ said Hagrid.</p><p>‘And Hagrid,’ Harry asked, ‘what’s a mudblood?’</p><p>‘He didn’!’ Hagrid growled. ‘That Lucius Malfoy has another thing comin’ to him – why, callin’ Harry Potter – <em>the</em> Harry Potter –‘</p><p>‘Uh – Hagrid,’ Harry said.</p><p>‘Right, sorry Harry,’ Hagrid tried to calm himself down, ‘it’s just a really foul name for someone who was Muggleborn.’</p><p>‘He said that word too,’ Harry said.</p><p>‘Ay, that’s someone with non-magic parents,’ Hagrid explained.</p><p>Hagrid grabbed Harry’s arm and suddenly looked very serious, ‘There are some wizards, Harry – like the Malfoys – who think they’re better than everyone else because they’re what people call pure-blood.’ Hagrid’s face grew darker still, ‘It’s utter tosh, Harry, it doesn’t make a bit o’ difference but some put a lot o' stock in it.’</p><p>‘Then why is it so important to them, Hagrid,’ Harry asked. The wizarding world was turning out to be very confusing.</p><p>‘It makes ‘em feel better about ‘emselves I suppose,’ Hagrid said shrugging. ‘It gives 'em an excuse to treat others badly.’ At this, Hagrid seemed to be thinking very deeply. Finally, he said, ‘I didn't go to school with Lucius, he was a few years behind me - thank goodness - but he's on the board o' governors, yeh know, and he’s never missed an opportunity to point out when someone ain’t - <em>pure</em>.’</p><p>Harry could tell that Hagrid had had run-ins with the Malfoys before - and, from the way Harry saw Hagrid's face darken, they couldn't have been pleasant. He was really worried now, ‘Hagrid, are the Malfoys dangerous?’</p><p>‘Lucius definitely is.’</p><p>‘Right,’ said Harry finally, ‘when I get to Hogwarts I’m steering clear of the lot of them. I thought Draco didn’t seem that bad but with a father like that –‘</p><p>‘What?’ Hagrid said suddenly, ‘no, I never said anythin’ about Draco.’</p><p>‘Hagrid, you just said his father’s dangerous!’ Harry exclaimed.</p><p>‘Exactly, Harry, I said his <em>father</em> !’</p><p>Harry just looked at Hagrid confused.</p><p>Hagrid took a deep breath. ‘It might be foolish, Harry, but I still think people can turn out different from family.’ Hagrid put his dust-bin lid sized hand gently on Harry’s shoulder. ‘Promise, me you’ll remember that, Harry. It ain’t only down to blood. Muggleborns prove that - <em>I</em> prove that.’</p><p>Harry just nodded, more uncertain than ever but feeling that he should trust Hagrid when he looked up and saw his eyes sparkling.</p><p>‘I promise.’</p><p>  </p><hr/><p> </p><p>A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said <em>Hogwarts Express, 11 o’clock</em>. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the ticket box had been, with the words <em>Platform Nine and Three-Quarters </em>on it. He had done it.</p><p>Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every colour wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to each other in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.</p><p>The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his trolley off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, ‘Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.’</p><p>‘Oh, <em>Neville</em>,’ he heard the old woman sigh.</p><p>A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.</p><p>‘Give us a look, Lee, go on.’</p><p>The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg.</p><p>Harry passed on through the crowd and spotted a bright patch of white-blond hair and saw the boy from Madam Malkins with his father and a woman that was presumably his mother, standing a few carriages away. Harry caught the boy’s eye through the crowd and gave a small smile. The boy’s lip twitched before he turned round to face his family.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>  </p><p>‘What’s your Quidditch team?’ Ron asked.</p><p>‘Er – I don’t know any,’ Harry confessed.</p><p>‘What!’ Ron looked dumbfounded. ‘Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world –'</p><p>And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’s been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy or Hermione Granger this time.</p><p>Three boys entered and Harry recognised the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from before, Draco Malfoy. He was looking at Harry with far more interest than he had shown back in Diagon Alley.</p><p>‘Is it true?’ he said. ‘They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?’</p><p>‘Yes,’ said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards.</p><p>‘Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,’ said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. ‘And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.’</p><p>Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.</p><p>‘Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles and more children than they can afford.’</p><p>His father again, Harry thought, he certainly seemed to try and act like him. But Harry remembered Draco’s tiny smile from earlier. He hoped Hagrid was right.</p><p>Draco Malfoy turned back to Harry.</p><p>‘You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.’</p><p>He held out his hand to shake Harry’s.</p><p>‘I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks,’ said Harry, he took a breath and stood up, ‘and I don’t think they’re either of you,’</p><p>Ron and Draco both gaped at him. Harry looked at the large boys flanking either side of Malfoy and screwed up whatever bravery he could find and walked towards him. He remembered what Hagrid had said. He remembered what he had promised him. He may be foolish but he stood his ground and took Draco’s hand.</p><p>Harry stared up defiantly at Draco, who’s gaze was confused but underneath it, Harry could almost see something more. Something a lot softer.</p><p>Ron had been watching the entire exchange in horror. ‘Harry are you mad? Do you know who he is? Draco Malfoy! And his father – '</p><p>‘Don’t say one word about my father, Weasley,’ Draco seethed. He was still looking at Harry and gripping his hand, rather tightly now.</p><p>‘Why should I stay, Potter, if you plan to associate with the son of a blood traitor?’ Malfoy sneered at Ron and finally let go of Harry’s hand.</p><p>‘Because neither of you are your fathers,’ Harry said simply. He was disappointed that Malfoy had reverted to his previous haughtiness, but he had a caught a flash of something that made him press on.</p><p>‘I would like to know both of you,’ Harry said simply and he promptly sat back down and started opening another pumpkin pasty.</p><p>Ron stared openly at him before slowly turning towards Malfoy. He sized up Crabbe and Goyle, took a step forward, seemed to think better of it, and then settled on locking eyes with Malfoy and giving him the slightest of nods. Draco looked back for a moment and then returned it. This seemed to satisfy them both and Ron sat back down, narrowly missing squashing Scabbers, and resumed devouring a half-eaten chocolate frog.</p><p>Draco looked at Harry once more and gave him an ever so slightly uncomfortable smile before saying. ‘Well, we best get back to our compartment. It looks like we’ll be arriving soon.’ He started ushering Crabbe and Goyle out, both of whom had flummoxed looks fixed upon their faces as they numbly filed down the passage.</p><p>‘See you around, Potter,’ Draco said finally before following them out the door.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>‘Bloody hell,’ Ron breathed. ‘You’ve met Malfoy before then?’</p><p>‘And his father,’ said Harry, and he explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.</p><p>‘I’ve heard of his family,’ said Ron darkly. ‘They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.’ Ron looked worriedly at Harry, ‘Are you sure you know what you’re doing? His entire family is dangerous.’</p><p>‘I have to give him a chance.’ Harry said, but Ron still looked unconvinced.</p><p>‘However horribly Draco acts, I think his father is worse.’ Harry said darkly, remembering how coldly Lucius had spoken towards Draco. Harry knew what that was like.</p><p>They both sat in silence for a while after that until they heard footsteps once again approaching their compartment.</p><p>‘What <em>has </em>been going on?’ said Hermione Granger, at the door once again.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?</p><p>When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted ‘GRYFFINDOR’, Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to ‘MacDougal, Morag’.</p><p>Draco Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and Harry saw Ron roll his eyes. Harry wondered if Malfoy would get his wish. As the hat was placed over Malfoy’s head, it opened its flap to speak immediately but promptly shut it again just as Draco looked over and locked eyes with Harry. It was only a second and then Draco was staring at the floor very intensely.</p><p>The hat took a long time after that, until it eventually screamed, ‘SLYTHERIN!’</p><p>As Malfoy went off to join Crabbe and Goyle, Ron gave Harry a very pointed look. Harry himself didn’t want to think what Malfoy being a Slytherin meant. He still hoped he was right, but Malfoy was definitely aiming to follow in his father’s footsteps.</p><p>Harry was so distracted that he hardly noticed that there weren’t many people left now.</p><p>‘Moon’ … ‘Nott’ … ‘Parkinson’ … then a pair of twin girls, ‘Patil’ and ‘Patil’ … then ‘Perks, Sally-Anne’ … and then, at last –</p><p>‘Potter, Harry!’</p><p>As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.</p><p>‘<em>Potter</em>, did she say?’</p><p>‘<em>The </em>Harry Potter?’</p><p>The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the Hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.</p><p>‘Hmm,’ said a small voice in his ear. ‘Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes – and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting … So where shall I put you?’</p><p>Harry gripped the edges of the stool and remembered Lucius Malfoy’s sneer, ‘Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.’</p><p>‘Not Slytherin, eh? Funny – the other one asked just the opposite.’</p><p>Harry had no clue what that meant, until he remembered Draco’s turn with the hat.</p><p>‘Oh, yes,’ said the hat. ‘So <em>loyal</em> that one, could have been Hufflepuff but in the end Slytherin was the best fit. You two are very similar you know. Are you sure you don’t want Slytherin?’</p><p>Harry gulped. He wasn’t Malfoy, he wasn’t going to be swayed.</p><p>‘You could be great you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that – no? Well, if you’re sure – better be GRYFFINDOR!’</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When they all jumped into their four-poster beds Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.</p><p>Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully – and there was Draco Malfoy, trying to help him pull the hat off – then Draco turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold – there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
