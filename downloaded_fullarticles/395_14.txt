    <p>Tina watched as Newt walked away from them with his old professor, following the scurrying niffler toward the imposing towers of Hogwarts castle.</p><p>“Well, Merlin knows how long they’ll be,” Theseus mumbled. “We’ve got to get back to the Ministry,” he announced with a nod toward Travers and the others, “if anyone has somewhere else they need to go, you’re welcome to come along. I can get you access to the floo network or a Ministry portkey.”</p><p>Kama and Nagini seemed to be engaged in a private conversation, before Nagini gave a nod and Kama turned to Theseus. “We would like to get back to Paris. There is much work to be done, and Nagini has agreed to assist. I’d like to speak more with Mr. Flamel.”</p><p>Theseus nodded. “I’ll see about getting you both named as Ministry informants, if you want. There’d be a vetting process, but it shouldn’t be too difficult to work out right now. We’ll be needing all the help we can get, and I’m willing to vouch for you both after last night. Being loosely attached to the Ministry would give you a small amount of protection, and would allow you to move more freely.”</p><p>Tina, suddenly anxious, looked toward where Newt and Dumbledore had gone, then back toward Theseus, before taking a breath and stepping forward to get his attention. “Mr. Scamander.” <em>It felt odd to call anyone other than Newt that.</em></p><p>“Miss Goldstein,” Theseus returned with a tilt of his chin and a slight, bemused, smile. “Did you need to contact MACUSA? I can put you in touch with someone there.” Tina’s eyes involuntarily flickered back to the direction Newt had gone, and Theseus seemed to notice. “Or,” he said, his smile becoming a bit too knowing for Tina’s liking, “you can wait here for my brother. Hogwarts should be most accommodating to you, and I suspect Newt would like to show his friends -” he nodded in Jacob’s direction as well - “around.”</p><p>Tina was torn between wanting to desperately cling to the gentle comfort and familiarity that Newt provided, and her sense of duty. Her hesitancy must’ve been plain on her face, because Theseus’ features softened more, and he tilted his head down as he raised his eyes to speak more gently to her - a gesture that was so <em>Newt</em> it took Tina by surprise. She hadn’t thought the brothers very similar, but she supposed any pair of siblings was bound to have characteristics in common, and to be fair she’d barely met Theseus. “Stay, if that’s what you want. All of this mess will still be here. I’ll be by Newt’s later to check in, since I assume he’ll take you there when you’re done here. We can talk official business then.”</p><p>She nodded and looked down at her feet, then back up at him. “Could I...ask you a favor?”</p><p>He tilted his head inquisitively and gave a nod.</p><p>“Could you let me know if you hear anything about my sister, Queenie? Or me, for that matter. You don’t have to go looking into anything, just...maybe keep an ear open? I’m not sure where I stand, officially.” Tina felt a bit like a coward, afraid to face her own government, but right now she wasn’t sure how much she cared for or trusted said government, and couldn’t guarantee that she could hold her tongue if faced with accusations and insinuations about her or Queenie. She’d end up demoted all over again.</p><p>“Of course,” he said softly, eyes full of understanding. Tina still wasn’t entirely sure how much she could trust him - being so ingrained in the Ministry as he was - but he was a tentative ally, and seemed to be a decent man, and she’d take any allies she could get. He was also Newt’s brother, and despite their “complicated relationship,” as Newt had put it, she could see there was love there. She didn’t think he’d deliberately do anything to hurt Newt’s friends in any way.</p><p>“Thank you, Mr. Scamander.”</p><p>He looked at her, tilting his head as if sizing her up. He opened his mouth, paused, and closed it again, as though he wanted to say something but couldn’t quite figure out what. His expression finally settled back to one of stony seriousness and he nodded yet again. “I’ll be in touch.”</p><p>Tina watched as everyone else disapperated, leaving only her and Jacob still standing on the viaduct.</p><p>“So,” Jacob said as he glanced around somewhat nervously, “what are we REALLY looking at here? Because all I see is a pile of rubble with warning signs to stay away, and I’m guessing that’s not where Newt just disappeared to.”</p><p>She smiled at the way their non-magical friend just went with everything they threw at him. Of course Hogwarts would have disillusionment and repulsion charms to keep no-maj hikers away. “This is Hogwarts, Jacob. It’s an impressive castle, but not as beautiful as Ilvermorny by half. C’mon, let’s go see what all the fuss is about.”</p><p>As they walked toward the castle, Tina found herself becoming a little unsure of exactly how to proceed. She trusted that Newt wouldn’t have just left them there if he hadn’t known they’d be able to get inside and would be well-received, but he may have also assumed Theseus or the other aurors would be with them still, and they’d know what to do.</p><p>Her worry, it turned out, was all for naught. As they approached the doors they swung open with a loud creak, revealing a stiff-postured house elf who regarded them with a calculating look.</p><p>“Miss Goldstein and Mr. Kowalski, I presume?”</p><p>Tina and Jacob looked at each other in surprise before turning back to the elf. “Uh...yeah,” Jacob replied as Tina whispered “yes.”</p><p>The elf bowed. “I am Podrey, at your service. Now, if you’ll please follow me, Master Dumbledore has instructed me to take his guests to the kitchens for a good breakfast and to warm up by the fire.”</p><p>At the word “breakfast” Tina felt her stomach clench - a reminder that she hadn’t eaten anything substantial since yesterday. The growl coming from Jacob’s stomach indicated he was in much the same situation.</p><p>“My stomach says lead the way, Mr. Podrey,” Jacob said cheerfully, though, Tina noted, his usual jovial tone had been nearly absent. It had been an exhausting twenty-four hours, or longer, for all of them.</p><p>As they walked through the doors Jacob suddenly stopped and stared, head darting all around. “Whoa!” he exhaled, “one minute I’m lookin’ at nothing, and the next there’s a castle all around me.”</p><p>Prodrey and Tina both aimed an amused smile at his shock and awe. “Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Mr. Kowalski. We don’t see many muggles here, but when we do they do seem to react in much a similar manner.”</p><p>They were led down several hallways and staircases (“be careful,” Podrey warned them, “they change”) to the cozy warmth of the kitchens, where they were ushered over to a small table by the fireplace and onto a bench. They’d barely sat down before a flurry of house elves deposited plate after steaming plate in front of them - piled high with eggs, bacon, several types of sausages, pastries, pancakes, toast, and beans.</p><p>“Beans?” Jacob asked. “For breakfast? Is that a wizard thing?”</p><p>Tina wrinkled her nose. “No, that’s definitely a <em>British</em> thing.” They both spooned some onto their plate though, neither of them wanting to appear rude to their hosts. She was suddenly famished, and she didn’t much care what she was eating, so long as it was food.</p><p>A tray of tea and coffee was also set before them, along with a small bottle of exotic-looking whiskey. Podrey cleared his throat as he explained, “Master Dumbledore thought that perhaps this morning you might require your coffee or tea to be a little more...fortified.”</p><p>Tina wanted the caffeine more than anything, and chose her coffee black. She watched with a pang of sadness as Jacob added a generous splash of whiskey to his. He really wasn’t holding up as well as he was pretending. “Mr. Dumbledore seems like a smart guy,” Jacob agreed before taking a small sip and sighing. “Tell him thanks for me.”</p><p>“You can tell him yourself, Mr, Kowalski,” came a voice from the doorway. They both looked up to see a kindly-looking wizard with a smile and a twinkle in his eye walking toward them, Newt trailing behind in his usual awkward shuffle. The man extended his hand and shook both of theirs. “Albus Dumbledore. Welcome to Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Dumbledore,” Tina said politely as she sipped her coffee.</p><p>“Just Dumbledore, please. And think nothing of it. Any friend of Newt’s is a friend of mine.” His smile turned almost devilish as he gave her a somewhat knowing look. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Goldstein. Newt’s told me very little about you with words, but his actions speak very highly of you.”</p><p>Newt’s eyes immediately flew to hers as he opened his mouth in a squeak of protest before finally settling his expression on one of fond exasperation as he glared at his old teacher.</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled before lowering his head and putting his hands in his pockets. When he raised his eyes again, his expression was suddenly somber. “But, honestly, breakfast is the least I could do. You’ve been through a very harrowing night, I’m told.”</p><p>None of them quite knew how to respond, each of them quietly looking away at nothing in particular. Dumbledore smiled again, but this time it was strained and didn’t meet his eyes. “Well. I’ll leave Newt with you. The first class of the day will be starting soon, and I’ve got to prepare. Stay as long as you’d like. Newt knows the way out, whenever you choose to leave. Please let the elves know if you need anything else.” And with a small salute of his fingers, he turned and left just as quietly as he’d appeared.</p><p>Newt sat down across from Tina and reached for a piece of toast. “Dumbledore isn’t sure if he can break the blood pact. He tried <em>literally</em> breaking it, or the pendant itself anyway, but that didn’t work. He’s going to consult with some of his friends to see if they might know of a way to weaken the magic enough to destroy it.” He grabbed a pot of marmalade and glanced up at her and Jacob. “Nobody else stayed?”</p><p>“No,” Tina confirmed softly, watching as Newt smeared his toast with marmalade. “Theseus wanted to get back to the Ministry, and the others went with him. Kama and Nagini are going back to Paris. They’ve decided to work together, and with us to find out what they can about Grindelwald’s plans. Theseus mentioned getting them listed as Ministry contacts.”</p><p>“And they agreed to that?” Newt asked in surprise, pausing mid-stroke of his knife over the toast.</p><p>Tina shrugged. “He said something about them being able to move around more freely. I suppose it makes sense. My guess is it’ll all be under the radar. Consultants, but nothing “official.” They’ll be spies, basically, but free to go where they please so long as they report anything noteworthy back. At least, that’s how MACUSA operates.”</p><p>Newt, having finished slathering his toast with a generous amount of marmalade, took a bite and made a blissful moaning sound that Tina’s heart was absolutely <em>not</em> suddenly beating faster at the sound of. “It still tastes the same,” he mumbled with his mouth still half full of toast. “Nowhere else on the planet has marmalade that tastes quite like the kind made at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Tina smiled at him as Jacob, who she had absolutely <em>not</em> forgotten was there, hummed in agreement around a mouthful of his own marmalade toast. “This is <em>really</em> good stuff.”</p><p>“Speaking of MACUSA,” Newt said, abruptly bringing the subject back around, “do you need to contact them?” He rubbed his fingers together where a bit of sticky marmalade had gotten on them, awkwardly avoiding her eyes.</p><p>“I asked your brother to keep an ear out for anything about me, or...Queenie.” Damn it, she was still struggling to say her sister’s name without choking up. Newt noticed, and his wonderfully gentle eyes turned to her as he gave a tiny sympathetic smile. “He said he’s going to check in with us tonight, at your house. If things seem okay, I’ll go to the ministry tomorrow and contact MACUSA. If not…” she frowned, and sighed. “Well I guess I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Jacob asked, not quite following the conversation.</p><p>“I mean,” Tina said, “that there’s a possibility MACUSA will treat Queenie - and by extension, possibly me - as a threat. If they know she went with Grindelwald, which I’m certain they do by now, she’ll be wanted. I’ll be, at the very least, wanted for questioning. I’m just not sure what they’ll do to me if they get suspicious and think I might be lying, or secretly also with Grindelwald.” She grimaced. “They definitely won’t be happy if they find out about her legilimency, which I’ve neglected to ever mention. I’ve always respected the law, but it’s hard to say what extreme measures MACUSA will take right now. They’ve already had Grindelwald impersonate an employee <em>twice</em>, and then escape. They’ll be extra cautious.”</p><p>“That’s…” Jacob sputtered, indignant, “I mean, Queenie’d never hurt anybody! <em>You’d</em> never hurt anybody!”</p><p>Tina sighed. “They’re scared, Jacob. Fear makes people think and do terrible things. And, in the name of following orders and upholding the law, other people will do terrible things without question.” She hadn’t forgotten how, under orders, people she’d considered friendly acquaintances had unquestioningly led her to her death. It was when she’d really began to, as Newt put it, go “middle-head,” though she supposed helping Credence the first time was what set her off in the first place.</p><p>Newt’s hand was hovering awkwardly over the table, as though he wanted to reach out for her but wasn’t sure exactly how to go about it, or if he even should. He finally seemed to settle on snatching another piece of toast instead. She looked up to find him watching her, expression sad but overwhelmingly, unmistakably affectionate. She smiled weakly in return.</p><p>Jacob grimaced at her words. “I’ve been to war, I’ve seen it happen. It’s just...you always want to believe it’s the other side - the bad guys - blindly doing awful things in the name of following orders. You never wanna believe it’s your own people.”</p><p>Tina nodded. “I don’t know what I’ll do if they aggressively try to bring me in for questioning. Maybe I can see if Theseus could grant me some sort of immunity through the Ministry as a consulting auror, or something like that. Make it sound like I’m needed here.”</p><p>“You <em>are</em> needed here,” Newt mumbled, low enough that she’d barely made out the words. His cheeks tinged pink when he looked up and realized she’d heard him. “After all,” he backpedaled, “your original objective was to find Credence and help him, and we still haven’t done that.”</p><p>“And now he’s with Grindelwald and the trail’s gone cold,” Tina pointed out with a sigh. “I don’t know if that’s reason enough to keep me here.”</p><p>“Well,” Newt curved his lips into a smile, but there was no happiness behind it, and he couldn’t quite meet her eyes. “As I said before - if it comes to it, we’ll find a way. I won’t let them treat you like a criminal, Tina. You...you’ve done nothing wrong.” He pulled his gaze up to hers, his eyes mossy steel, and her chest seized at the intensity in them. She could only stare back.</p><p>“Hear, hear!” Jacob shouted, raising his coffee mug in agreement as he was either oblivious to or choosing to ignore the tension simmering between his two companions. “They’re not takin’ you without a fight, Teen.”</p><p>It was the use of the familiar affectionate nickname that broke her, and she smiled as tears welled up in her eyes. It felt good to have others willing to fight with you and for you. It felt good to have <em>family.</em></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>They’d finished their breakfast and Newt hesitantly asked them if they’d like to go back to his house and rest, or if they’d like a quick tour of Hogwarts. Tina, sensing that Newt was inwardly buzzing with energy and longing to spend a little time steeped in nostalgia, agreed to be shown around. Jacob had smiled at them and said he preferred it there in the warm quiet kitchen where nothing moved out from under him. Despite his smile, his eyes held a deep melancholy as he poured a bit more whiskey into his cup, and Tina and Newt glanced at each other with mirrored looks of concern as they walked away from their friend.</p><p>“Do you think he’ll be okay alone?” Tina asked, glancing behind her and feeling vaguely guilty for leaving Jacob</p><p>“I think it might actually be what’s best for him right now,” Newt replied with a pained smile. “Jacob has a tendency to...pretend, I think...for the sake of everyone else. He needs some time to let himself be sad. I don’t think he’s quite processed the last couple of days yet.” He puffed out his breath and absently ruffled the hair at the back of his head. “I’m not sure any of us really have, to be honest. I feel like I’m still running on adrenaline and...denial, maybe.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Tina sighed in agreement. It was a good assessment of her own state.</p><p>Newt stopped in front of a stack of barrels and was inexplicably gazing fondly at them. Off Tina’s questioning look, he smiled. “This is the entrance to the Hufflepuff common room and dormitories.”</p><p>“A...barrel?” Tina asked, incredulous.</p><p>He grinned and nodded. “Round doors are sort of a Hufflepuff theme. You needed to tap out the rhythm of the name of the house founder on…” he trailed his finger along the barrels for a moment, seemingly mentally counting over and up until he stopped in front of one barrel in particular “...this one, and the door would be revealed.” With a sigh he stepped back and shoved his hands in his pockets, gazing at the barrel wistfully. “Best not try it though, might give the students a bit of a shock for us to pop in unannounced. Plus I’m not sure if they’ve changed the entrance procedure, and I’d hate for us to get doused in vinegar if we get it wrong.”</p><p>“Vinegar?” Tina turned to him, eyebrows raised.</p><p>“Yes,” he smiled, “to keep out intruders. Though all in all ours was the easiest house room to access, possibly due to the Hufflepuff reputation for friendship and hospitality. Gryffindor and Slytherin required passwords that changed frequently, and Ravenclaws had to solve a riddle before they could get into their common room, which always seemed a bit unnecessary and tedious to me, especially if you’d had a hard day and just wanted to go to bed.”</p><p>Tina couldn’t help the fond smile that crept across her face while listening to him go on about Hogwarts houses. He was enjoying the bit of nostalgia, and she couldn’t help but get caught up in his enthusiasm when he spoke fondly of his old school house. She also couldn’t resist a bit of teasing.</p><p>“Dousing someone in vinegar is a sign of friendship and hospitality?”</p><p>“I…” Newt’s mouth snapped shut, and Tina couldn’t help but grin. “It...could be worse?” he offered, and she laughed. It was weak and rusty, but it felt good.</p><p>“I wish I could show it to you right now,” Newt said, voice tinged with nostalgia and pride. “It’s so warm and bright and cozy. Full of plants and sunshine and the most comfortable chairs in the entire world. Much better than the other houses’ common rooms - why, Slytherin’s is in the dungeon, and it’s so cold and dark and damp, I could never understand how Leta - “</p><p>He froze suddenly at the mention of her name, his expression immediately shifting from fond memories to a very recent pain. He seemed to hunch in on himself, his hands still shoved deep into his pockets as he stared at the ground.</p><p>Tina took a step toward him, hands hanging awkwardly at her sides, unsure if she should offer up some comfort via touch, unsure of how welcome that would be. She was unsure of where exactly she stood with him. Last night in his suitcase they’d confessed to caring about one another, but it was all so new and raw, and physicality with other people had never been something she was very good at navigating. Nor was he, it seemed. In their exhaustion and grief they’d leaned on one another both literally and metaphorically, but in the light of day the casual comforting touch just didn’t seem to happen naturally. She didn’t know how to <em>do</em> this.</p><p>She settled for invading his space slightly, leaning her head down until she could catch his downturned eyes with hers. “It’s okay,” she told him, gently, knowing that it wasn’t, “do you want to leave? We can go if this is too much right now.”</p><p>“No,” he replied, flashing her a quick, slightly pained, smile before looking down at his feet again, “no, I...I think this is good actually. I think I need to do this. It hurts, but Leta is so much a <em>part</em> of this place for me--every corner I turn reminds me of her in some way--and I think it’s good to remember. I haven’t been back here since I was a student, and the memories are just a little...overwhelming.”</p><p>“Do you want to be alone?” Tina asked, fearing he’d say yes but knowing she’d give him whatever space he needed.</p><p>Newt’s eyes shot up to hers. “No!” he replied quickly, perhaps a little too loudly, as he took a shuffling step toward her and held her gaze earnestly. He appeared a little embarrassed by his outburst, and she could see the pink tinge on his cheeks as he lowered his voice. “No. There’s...there’s nobody else I’d rather do this with, Tina. It’s a bittersweet onslaught of memories, but I also want to share this place with someone. Um...with <em>you</em>. I want you here with me. I rather think I...<em>need</em> you here with me.” He looked away from her then, nervous or embarrassed about his admission, and it struck her that he was as unsure about all this as she was. She decided to do the brave thing and reached out for his hand, clasping it gently between both of hers.</p><p>Newt raised his eyes back up and this time held her gaze as his hand tightened around hers. The air was thick with emotion, and Tina was suddenly aware of how close they were standing, and of how warm his hand was in hers, and of just how beautiful the shifting green-blue-amber hues of his eyes were up close and when they were intently focused on her own.</p><p>The sound of approaching voices caused them to hurriedly drop hands and take a step away from each other, just as a small group of students in yellow scarves turned the corridor and came to a halt in front of them. Their chatter died as they took in the no-doubt-unexpected sight of two adults standing in front of their dormitory door. The boy in front of the group took one look at Newt and gasped.</p><p>“Blimey! You’re Newt Scamander!”</p><p>Newt looked startled, and, Tina noted, had immediately shifted back into his more awkward mannerisms - not quite looking at them and ducking his head to glance up through the fringe of his hair. “Um...yes?”</p><p>“I have your book!” another student cried out excitedly.</p><p>The first student rolled his eyes and turned back to look at the smaller boy who’d shouted. “EVERYONE’S got his book, genius!”</p><p>“I…” Newt shifted, clearly embarrassed, and Tina could see that he was struggling to keep up with the sudden unexpected bit of recognition. He looked at her, eyes pleading to somehow get him out of this, but she was at as much of a loss as he was.</p><p>“Newt bloody Scamander!” the boy exclaimed again, “here at Hogwarts! Only the most famous Hufflepuff since Helga herself, and I practically ran into him.”</p><p>Newt scoffed at the praise. “I <em>hardly</em> think…”</p><p>“Okay, okay, don’t scare the poor man.” A girl at the back of the group pushed her way forward and nodded toward the dormitory door. “Would you like to come in, Mr. Scamander? We just got back from breakfast and none of us have class for a bit.” She frowned, glancing at Tina and perhaps picking up on the charged atmosphere. “U-unless you’ve got somewhere else to be. We won’t keep you waiting. Just thought you might like to visit the common room, but...”</p><p>“Could we?” Newt asked as his eyes widened with hopeful enthusiasm. “It’s...been a long time.”</p><p>The students all smiled, and Tina soon found herself climbing through a round door and crawling up a short earthen passage (<em>like a badger</em>, she realized, remembering the mascot of Newt’s house) to another round door. The students (and Newt, she noticed fondly) scampered up the passage with ease, well-practised in navigating the entrance. Tina was a bit slower, and Newt paused in the doorway to extend a helping hand. Tina gratefully grasped his hand as their eyes met and they smiled shyly at one another. The moment - and the hand hold - was broken a second later as Newt moved to back through the doorway and smacked his head off of it as he tumbled through.</p><p>“Ow.” Newt rubbed his head and grinned sheepishly from where he sat sprawled on the floor as Tina bent her own tall frame through the doorway. “The last time I was here I was, um, a bit smaller.”</p><p>The students giggled and Tina flashed him an amused smile. It was her turn to extend a hand to help him to his feet, which he readily accepted. Aware they had an audience, Tina dropped his hand rather reluctantly and turned to take in the room.</p><p>Faded yellow brick walls and warm honey oak beams made up the structure of the space, with a pleasantly crackling fireplace on one side and round windows lining the top of the wall near the low ceiling. Early morning sunlight poured through the windows, casting the room in a warm glow. Potted plants hung from the ceiling, and more were set on stands and tables throughout the room. One particular vine had begun to creep along the wall toward another round door, but some thoughtful student had used a bit of twine to redirect it out of the doorway’s path. The whole place gave off a feeling of calm happiness and warmth, and Tina could see why Newt had felt so at home here. She glanced over to see him looking around with a peaceful smile, though the weight of bittersweet memories was visible in his tired eyes.</p><p>One of the students cleared her throat and approached them. “You can sit down and make yourself at home if you’d like, Mr. Scamander, and, uh, Miss…?”</p><p>Oh, right. They had no idea who she was. “Goldstein,” she supplied with a soft smile. “But call me Tina.”</p><p>The girl’s eyebrows shot up. “You’re American!”</p><p>Newt finally seemed to snap out of his dazed trip down memory lane. “Oh!” he exclaimed, sheepishly, “so sorry, where are my manners? You all know who I am, but we seem to have skipped right over introductions.” He turned his gaze to Tina, and she could see something in his eyes soften. “Tina is my friend from New York. I’m just...showing her around Hogwarts.” He left it at that, probably for the best. The students didn’t need to wonder why an auror from MACUSA was here. Her heart did a little flip-flop at his use of the word “friend,” but at the moment she wasn’t sure how else to describe their relationship. And for sure their uncertainty around each other didn’t need to be dredged up and put on display in front of a room of teenagers.</p><p>The room suddenly exploded in noise as all the kids began shouting.</p><p>“New York!”</p><p>“The buildings there are so tall!”</p><p>“Did you go to Ilvermorny?”</p><p>“What’s it like?”</p><p>“Do you have quidditch in America?”</p><p>“Are you and Mr. Scamander dating?”</p><p>That last question threw her for a loop, and without fully meaning to she found her eyes shooting to Newt, who looked equally thrown as his eyes widened and shot up to hers. She saw him go pale before crimson flushed into his cheeks, and she could feel her face warming from her own matching blush.</p><p>Thankfully, they were both saved by Pickett, who had poked his head out of Newt’s pocket to see what all the fuss was about, and began chattering excitedly when he recognized where they were.</p><p>The students immediately lost interest in Tina.</p><p>“Is that a bowtruckle?”</p><p>“Does it live in your pocket?”</p><p>“Can they really pick locks?”</p><p>Newt, looking immensely relieved by his little friend’s timing, grinned as he gently lifted PIckett out of his pocket. The bowtruckle chirped in alarm at being bombarded by shouting teens, and tried his best to hide behind Newt’s thumb.</p><p>“This is Pickett, and yes, he’s a bowtruckle. He’s got some attachment issues, which is why he prefers traveling in my pocket instead of staying with his branch on his tree. He’s feeling a little shy right now though, so if you’d please, could you all step back a little and give him some space?</p><p>The students immediately did as asked, and Tina smiled at the sudden change in Newt. It was like a switch was flipped, and the shy awkward man was transformed into a confident expert, easily speaking about magical creatures with passion.</p><p>Ignored for the moment, TIna sat down in a worn yellow overstuffed armchair that had been pushed close to the fireplace and watched with amusement as an impromptu magizoology lesson had begun. The students were interested and engaged, and Tina found herself wondering if he’d ever considered teaching. Probably not - it was far too routine for him, and probably a bit too much like an office job. But a pleasant feeling bubbled up in her chest at the sight of him lighting up as he talked about his favorite subject. Seeing him not only answer questions but seemingly taking great delight in talking about his creatures, asking his own questions to get the students thinking, and employing his own particular type of wit to make them smile was...well, it was downright charming. A fact which, TIna noted, hadn’t gone unnoticed by one girl in the group, who was smiling up at him in rapt attention. Something he said made her giggle and blush, and Tina grinned knowingly. Newt was bound to gain a following of admirers with his newfound fame, and she suspected that he’d be utterly oblivious to it all. She wondered if he had any idea that he was kinda...<em>cute.</em></p><p>Tina’s mind began to wander away from what Newt was saying as she took in more details of the room. The chair she was curled into really was as comfortable as Newt had advertised, as was the coziness of the room. One of the windows was cracked open a bit, and the chirps and calls of songbirds could be heard along with the softly whistling breeze. It was a pleasant mix of sounds when blended with Newt’s equally pleasant voice in the background, and she thought maybe she’d just close her eyes. Just for a moment.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open again at the sound of her name softly being called and the feel of a feather-light brush of fingers along her cheek. Newt was leaning over her, giving her the same sort of affectionate smile that she’d seen aimed at some of his favorite creatures (though Newt would deny he had favorites, and, really, comparing herself to beasts should probably feel insulting, instead of the exact opposite). Newt withdrew his touch and straightened when he saw that she was awake, and he glanced away, shoving his hands into his pockets as if to physically restrain himself from reaching for her again. Tina missed the gentle touch immediately. She wondered how to encourage him to give in to any impulses he had to be physically affectionate. How exactly did one convey that they were extremely open to having their space invaded? She sure as heck didn’t know.</p><p>“Did I fall asleep?” she asked, slightly surprised. She hadn’t felt that close to dropping off, but a look around the room told her they were now alone.</p><p>“Just a smidge,” Newt answered, teasing. She tried to shoot him a glare in return, but an enormous yawn hijacked her face’s attempt to look peeved. It only made his smile widen.</p><p>“We should go,” he said, eyes softening as he appeared to be taking in her sleep-rumpled appearance. “The students had to go to class, so we probably shouldn’t hang about the common room, and you’re exhausted. We can go collect Jacob and be on our way.”</p><p>Oh. When he said “go” he meant...<em>go.</em> “But you’ve barely got to look around!” Tina protested. “We can stay a while longer, I don’t mind.” The yawn punctuating the end of her sentence said otherwise, though, and Newt gave her a knowing look.</p><p>“We can come back sometime. There will be more meetings with Dumbledore, I’m sure. And,” he began, only to be interrupted by his own yawn, “to be honest I’m quite exhausted myself, all of a sudden. Um, as you can clearly see. We all need rest.”</p><p>Tina nodded, and followed him back out the round door and into the kitchens, where they found Jacob slumped over the table fast asleep and snoring. They shared a concerned glance at one another as they each took in the noticeable tear tracks on their friend’s face. It was almost a pity to wake him; he looked like he could use the rest.</p><p>“Jacob,” Newt called softly as he gently tapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>The light tap was all it took. Jacob sat up with a jolt and a loud broken-off snore. “I don’t wanna go to school today,” he mumbled, still half-asleep, “I think I’m sick.”</p><p>“That’d be the firewhiskey,” Newt replied nonchalantly, “and so sorry about school, but you’re currently in one.”</p><p>“Huh?” Jacob blinked blearily as he slowly came to full wakefulness. “Oh. Right.” he nodded as he took in his surroundings, then groaned at the motion. “Firewhiskey, huh? How long was I out? Sure don’t seem like it should be long enough to end up with a hangover.”</p><p>“Not if you’re a wizard, no, but you’re a muggle, and your physiology is -”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, different, I get it.” Jacob blinked a few more times, trying to clear his head. “Magic booze is off-limits.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Calling out thank yous to the house elves, they made their way out of the castle and apparated to Hogsmeade. From there they took the floo network to London (which Jacob was not a fan of, but he admitted was better than a portkey), and soon Tina found herself standing in front of the door to a small house that looked just like every other house in the row around it.</p><p>It wasn’t how she imagined Newt living, when she’d indulged in daydreams of what he looked like when he was writing his letters, or what he was up to at any given moment when thoughts of him came storming into her mind (which they did more and more frequently as of late). She knew he lived in London, but had pictured something unique, maybe a little quirky. A small apartment in an old building with a lot of character, maybe. An unassuming townhouse right in the middle of London didn’t seem to fit him at all.</p><p>Inside wasn’t much different, when he ushered them through the door. The furnishings were sparse, impersonal, and looked barely used. He pointed out the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom, and told them to make themselves at home.</p><p>“As sleep is the most pressing concern at the moment, Tina...I’d like to offer you the bedroom.” He averted his eyes as he said it, and Tina felt herself blushing despite knowing there was nothing at all inappropriate about the offer.</p><p>“And, Jacob -” Newt turned to find that their friend had already claimed the small sofa and was shifting around into a comfortable position.</p><p>“I’m good here,” Jacob waved them off with a yawn and closed his eyes. Newt waved his wand and a blanket unfolded itself and covered him gently. “Hey, thanks, buddy,” Jacob mumbled as he snugged the blanket under his chin and immediately fell asleep.</p><p>“So,” Tina glanced over at the narrow bed in the next room, “where will you sleep?”</p><p>Newt looked at his feet before glancing back up in her direction, a slightly sheepish smile on his face. “I usually sleep in the basement, with the creatures. I like being nearby, in case they need me, and...truthfully, I find it calming.”</p><p>Tina smiled. Of course. He’d mentioned that he has a hospital of sorts for beasts in his basement, and that probably explained why his house looked so unlived in. Newt was a wanderer, and carried with him the closest thing he likely felt to home. It only made sense that he’d want to sleep in the place most similar to his suitcase.</p><p>“I’d like to see it,” she said, smiling at him fondly. “Your basement, I mean.”</p><p>He looked at her, really looked at her, and the expression on his face could only be described as <em>pleased</em>. “Of course, Tina. But later. You need a good long nap.” He lifted his case from where he’d set it near his feet. “I’ve got to get a few of these fellows settled back in, and then I plan to sleep the rest of the day away and leave the lighter work to Bunty.”</p><p>“Bunty?”</p><p>“Oh. My assistant. I think I mentioned her in my letters?”</p><p>“Your last letter mentioned you’d hired an assistant, but you didn’t give a name.” <em>Or a gender,</em> Tina chastised herself for the brief pang of jealousy that she felt. Assuming things about other women in Newt’s life hadn’t worked out so well for her recently.</p><p>“Oh, well, she’s brilliant with the creatures. I don’t know what I’d do without her, with how busy I’ve been recently with the book.” He looked down in embarrassment at that - the bit of fame that came with the book’s success was clearly not something he had anticipated or desired.</p><p>Newt shuffled his feet and swayed a bit, still not quite looking at her. “Well. I’ll leave you to it. If, um...if you’d like something more comfortable to sleep in, there are pajamas in the wardrobe drawers there,” he nodded toward the furniture on the other side of the room. “And if you wake up first please help yourself to anything in the kitchen.” He looked up at her for a moment, flashed an awkward smile, and moved to walk away.</p><p>“Hey, Newt?” Tina called, unable to help the fond smile on her face. He turned, eyes wide in question. “Thanks.”</p><p>His face softened, but his eyes held hers. “Of course.”</p><p>They looked at each other silently for a long moment, before Newt abruptly turned and shuffled away. She smiled after him as she closed the bedroom door with a gentle creak.</p><p>Tina looked down at the clothes she was wearing - rumpled and dirty from several days of wear, a night in a Parisian sewer, and a pretty intense bit of fighting - and frowned. She could simply do a cleaning spell and then transfigure them into pajamas, but the thought of taking Newt up on his offer and putting on a pair of <em>his</em> pajamas was tempting. She bit her lip as she looked at the wardrobe in the room, faced with a decision, before finally deciding that her clothes could really use aired out in addition to a thorough scourgify. She stripped, hung her clothing over a chair in the room, and whispered every cleaning spell she knew as she pointed her wand at the fabric. Her underthings would have to go back on until she could get a fresh set. There’d been no time to retrieve her small bag of things from the little boarding house she’d booked a room at in Paris, so she’d have to send for them later. Until then she was stuck with the literal clothes on her back.</p><p>Well, those, and Newt’s pajamas, she supposed.</p><p>She walked over to the wardrobe and, curiosity getting the better of her, opened the doors. Several suits hung there, neatly pressed, along with a few button-up shirts. A familiar blue coat was also hanging, and Tina couldn’t help but reach out and fondly caress the worn wool. She’d assumed he’d replaced it with the gray one he’d been wearing, but apparently he’d not gotten rid of it completely. The color of the old coat suited him, and she missed it. Closing the doors, she moved on to the drawers. The top drawer must have swelled a little at some point and it rasped and squeaked as she carefully tugged it open. Inside was an assortment of socks. Unfolded, unmatched, loose socks just haphazardly thrown into the drawer, with a few pairs of sock garters shoved in one corner. They all seemed to be the same shade of brown. Tina smiled at the sight. How like Newt to not bother neatly matching and folding identical articles of clothing. He could be meticulously organized when it came to caring for his beasts - she’d seen food carefully stored and labeled in his suitcase, and notes about feeding schedules and quantities for each of them - but she’d also seen his cluttered workspace where things that were of lesser importance were simply strewn about. Socks, apparently, didn’t rank very high on the list of important things worth organizing.</p><p>The next drawer contained sloppily-folded underwear, both the short and long variety, but Tina quickly closed it in embarrassment. She hadn’t really thought much about Newt’s underclothes, and she wasn’t certain she was ready to let her mind wander into that terrain just yet.</p><p>The third drawer was deeper, and held folded sweaters in one half and casual trousers in shades of brown and tan and navy blue in the other. She realized, looking at his clothing, that she’d never seen Newt in anything more casual than a suit. Surely he didn’t wear them all the time? She ran her hand over the soft fabric of the trousers and imagined that this must be what he wore at home. Comfortable clothing for when he didn’t plan to go out.</p><p>Finally, in the bottom drawer she found a few identical pairs of pajamas. They were a deep blue with white pinstripes, and they looked brand new. She wondered if he ever actually wore them, or if he just fell asleep in whatever he’d been wearing that day. The latter seemed far more likely based on what she knew of Newt.</p><p>Thanks to her height, the pajamas fit well enough. Not too long in the legs or arms, though the top was a little loose once buttoned, and she had to pull the drawstring rather tight at the waist in order to keep them in place. The fabric was incredibly soft, undeniably genuine silk, and she was certain they must have been expensive. Nicer than any pajamas she’d ever owned, at any rate. She wondered if he’d purchased them himself, or if they’d been a gift. She’d heard his book was doing well - <em>very well</em> - but Newt wasn’t the sort to talk about financial matters, and she wasn’t the sort to ask. Silk pajamas that would rarely, if ever, be worn seemed an indulgence Newt was unlikely to invest in, though. Her money was on them being a gift.</p><p>Tina walked over to the small bed and sat down, bouncing a little to test the springs. The mattress creaked in protest, and she wondered just how long Newt had owned it. Pulling back the covers and climbing inside, she became certain that this bed was as old as she was. It was lumpy and definitely not the most comfortable thing she had ever slept on, but it also wasn’t the <em>least</em> comfortable place she’d ever slept, not by far. It’d do. She snuggled into the pillow and inhaled deeply, and tried to tamp down the disappointment she felt that the bed only very faintly smelled at all like Newt. <em>He did say he doesn’t usually sleep here</em>, she thought to herself, but the realization that she’d been hoping to feel some sort of connection to him by sleeping in his bed made her face feel flushed. Flustered by her lovesick foolishness, she quickly waved her wand at the room to darken it into some illusion of night time, and set her wand down on the bedside table.</p><p>She was asleep as soon as her eyes closed.</p>
