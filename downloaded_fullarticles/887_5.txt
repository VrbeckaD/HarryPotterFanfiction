    <p>Here are the warnings for this book.</p>
<p>• Mental Abuse For the most of the book</p>
<p>• Bullying.</p>
<p>• Depression</p>
<p>• Anxiety</p>
<p>• Eating disorders</p>
<p>• Self-Abusing</p>
<p>• Dark thoughts</p>
<p>• Mature things</p>
<p>• Hopelessness</p>
<p>• LGBTQ+ slurs.</p>
<p>If anyone is reading this and is against the LGBTQ+ community, I would strongly advise you not to read this because it will be filled with it. </p>
<p>Lexie is Lesbian and I'm making Luna Lesbo, too! This is because she doesn't have to be straight, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you will like this book.</p>
<p>First chapter will be up tomorrow.</p>
