Sirius became the new DADA professor which to Severus's shock caused to him drown in whiskey that same night but that was not the only. It was a regular order meeting at 12 Grindelwald where both Severus and the mutt erm sorry Sirius was at each other's heads would you think by now they would learn to shut the fuck.<br/>
Dumbledore stated " would you two quiet down, I want to introduce to you a new member of the Order of Pheniox. Um Severus you will be mad at me, I'm so sorry my boy" Severus stared at Albus like he has grown 2 heads and some how realized what Albus means. He shout " Are you Fucking kidding me? Are you senile ? You are eating way too much lemon drops, oh shit we screwed. Don't tell me she is going to be a staff member. The kids will be dead within an hour. The fuck is wrong with you" Molly interrupts mid rant "Severus you can't say those words the children are here."<br/>
A knock on the front door interrupts silence ensue. Dumbledore got up and walks to the front door and walks back to the kitchen only footsteps were heard. As he went to take back his seat he said " I would like to introduce you to Mira Saia." "Shut your trap old man I can introduce myself, anyways my name is Mira Saia , age you don't need to know that. Erm I love knifes, I'm terrible at conversation and I love liqour"<br/>
