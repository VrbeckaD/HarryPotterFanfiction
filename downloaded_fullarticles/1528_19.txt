    <p>"Ink Me Up" John chuckled. He had heard about this from Lestrade at their latest pub meet-up, Lestrade had been showing him the new tattoo he had got a week before. Lestrade had quite a few tattoos from over the years.<br/>
"I swear John I been to some professional tattoo parlours. They're always so expensive, like £500 for a medium sized tattoo. £270 for a full sleeve tattoo and a quality one at that at this place." Greg said incredulously. John shook his head "You're really selling him, aren't you? Anyway, what made you think 'stuff small tattoos, I'm getting a full sleeve'?"<br/>
"I don't know but he's good, like really good. You said you were thinking about getting a tattoo, weren't you?" Greg pressed<br/>
John sighed, he had been thinking about getting a tattoo and had mentioned it to Greg at the last pub meet-up, admittedly quite a few drinks into the evening. but he still was unsure, he wasn't sure why he was holding back, heck it wasn't that he didn't like tattoos. he liked the look of them and most of his boyfriends often were decorated with tattoos.<br/>
"I don't know Greg, I mean it's one thing to think about getting a tattoo and a whole other thing to actually get one. It's just... I don't know." John trailed off, he had thought about getting one since he was 18, the only thing holding back was an inability to commit and get it done.<br/>
"Actually Greg, what's the name of the place? I think I might go and pay this 'amazing' parlour a visit." John decided, it was time that he committed and got tattooed.<br/>
"I can do you one better, I have the address on my phone, I'll send it to you." </p>
<p>As John stood outside of the small shop on St Martins Ct, John felt a little thrill run up his spine. ‘Come on Watson, you’ve got this far.’ and with that in his mind, pushed open the door.<br/>
"I'll be out in a sec, I'm just finishing up back here!" came from behind some tasteful green folding screen doors. John was certain he recognised that voice but he couldn't put a face to the voice. Nevermind, all would be revealed in time.<br/>
"Alright, I don't have to tell you what to do about the skin, you know by now. Um... see you in a fortnight for the colour, take care and you're paying now or after the colour?" the unknown voice said cheerfully.<br/>
"After the colour" came the crisp reply.<br/>
Hang on, was that Mycroft? John couldn't believe his ears, Mycroft Holmes, 'the British Government' came here and had tattoos? Multiple ones, judging by the 'you know by now'.  no, it couldn't be, Mycroft was all prim and proper. he wouldn't have tattoos, and if he did, John doubted that he would go to a parlour like this one. And yet there he was, rolling down his sleeve to hide the fresh ink on his left forearm, umbrella leaning on the screen door. He only noticed John when he had properly buttoned his sleeve and was reaching for his jacket.<br/>
"Greetings Dr Watson" Mycroft said as if they had encountered each other on the stairs leading to 221B.<br/>
John was shocked, Mycroft Holmes had tattoos.</p>
<p>"Alright, mate. what can I do for ya?" came from behind the counter, it seemed that while John was getting his entire idea of Mycroft re-done, the artist had slipped behind the counter.  John turned his eyes on the artist, "Um... my friend recommended me to go here, I was hoping to get a tattoo done here."  Wait, the artist looked familiar...<br/>
"Harry Potter, as I live and breath."<br/>
"Yes, it's good to breath isn't it, otherwise you die and that's not fun, I can tell you. " came the cheery response "Wait, John, John Watson? oh, I thought you were dead somewhere in the desert, lying in the dust while the sun-scorched your dead body!" Harry said, looking like he would hug John any minute now.</p>
