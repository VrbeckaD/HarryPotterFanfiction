  <b>Chapter 1. Mistaken Identity</b>
</h1>
<p>Even before graduating from Hogwarts, Lillian Evans knows that she won’t be able to carry children of her own. Not only is she infertile, but her womb has also been badly damaged. It breaks her heart, knowing that she will never get to read or sing her own child to sleep at night. She’ll never hear the pitter-patter of little feet in the hallway. She’ll never see her child off to Hogwarts for the first time. She’ll never get the chance to play with her own child and pass on her knowledge. What's almost as bad is that she can’t give her fiancé, James Potter, an heir. </p>
<p>The Potter family is among one of the oldest pureblood and noble families left in Britain. Their lineage dates back to the Peverells. The very Peverells from which the legend of Death’s Hallows originates. The Potters are the last blood descendants of three of the four Hogwarts founders. Then there's the Black’s, James’s mother’s family. She's certain once they find out he’ll be disowned and lose his connection to the family magic. She finally brings herself to confide in James's weeks before graduation. He offers a solution.</p>
<p>“There may actually be a way,” James says hesitantly nodding decisively when he sees her hopeful smile. “It is considered a dark ritual.” he continues. </p>
<p>“Will they still be... ours?” Lily asks hesitantly. ‘Mine’ she wants to say.</p>
<p>“He’ll still have your DNA and magic if you add your blood but he will technically be considered a pureblood. The mother will have joint legal rights to him and the right to joint custody but he will still be ours. Well, he'll be ours in all the ways that count.” James admits. Upon seeing her confusion James elaborates. “The ritual brings out the latent family magic in each participant's blood. It’s an ancient pureblood ritual to ensure a Lord and Lady give birth to an eligible heir. We’ll have to find someone who shares Black or Potter family blood and magic to carry him to term for this to work.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes James, okay.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“And what about regular means?” her older sister, Petunia, asks when she happily announced her news during her next visit. “Science, Lily.” Petunia explains with a sneer and an eye-roll at her befuddlement. “I know they didn’t teach you much off in that magical boarding school of yours, but surely you’ve heard of the recent strides in the medical world? I know you were unfortunately born infertile, but you could at least carry the child yourself if you used this other woman’s eggs.” </p>
<p>“It wouldn't matter,” Lily says with a self-deprecating sigh as she adjusts her waist-length blood-red hair. “James is considered nobility in both worlds. He's in line to be the next Lord of his family.”</p>
<p>“What does that have to do with anything?” Petunia asks taking her turn to be befuddled. “He isn’t focusing you into this is he?” Petunia asks enraged on her behalf.</p>
<p>“No, no nothing like that,” Lily says before sighing and setting down her tea. “Some people... some people disagree with my upcoming marriage to James, Petunia,” Lily explains looking down at her lap. “Several of these individuals have taken it upon themselves to ensure I won't be able to provide him an heir.”</p>
<p>“You don't mean?” Petunia demands aghast as her hands automatically going to her abdomen in horror.</p>
<p>“Between the potions and spells I.. my womb- I can't get pregnant much less carry a child to term.” She chokes out. “James did everything he could to protect me even before we became official. It just- it wasn't enough.” She sobs “He’s never exactly been subtle and he’s known I was his soulmate since my sorting. Apparently someone overheard him mention his soulmark in connection to me. Well… being eleven and new to the magical world I just thought it was nerves.” she explains quickly wiping away the tears from her eyes with the tissues Petunia offers her.</p>
<p>“When?” Petunia asks aghast as she moves to sit closer.</p>
<p>“My healer, that's a magical doctor, she’s narrowed it down to my first night. It had to have been during my first welcoming feast.” Lily says with a clinical detachment “I didn't take anything from anyone and mum packed sandwiches for the train.”</p>
<p>“Who else knows?” Petunia asked worriedly.</p>
<p>“Just Severus, Remus, and Sirius. We’re trying to keep it a secret even within the family and Severus has been searching for a cure since I found out. I had him take me to a healer during my third year. I had to know and when I found out I had to tell someone.” she says with tears in her eyes</p>
<p>“Did Mum and Dad know?” Petunia asks hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Yes. I wanted to try to find a cure on my own before I told you. You're always trying to fix something for me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, a big sister's job is never done,” Petunia says with a wry smile.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Lady Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black is just recently married. Sadly the promised honeymoon period has been strained since discovering her husband Lord Rodolphus Lestrange is completely incapable of getting her with child. She loves her soulmate, she does. Rod is an extremely supportive, and loving husband. Their sex life is great. His investments alone make enough money to live lavishly for centuries. That's not even taking into account his job at the Department of Mysteries or the investments made by his ancestors. She is even given privileges and leeways that most noble ladies could only dream of. </p>
<p>So yes, her life is great, wonderful even. Rodolphus just forgot to mention he couldn't get her pregnant before they married. An oversight that cost him his arm in a duel. Let it never be said that the Black family woman can't hold their own in a fight. Thankfully he can attach his arm back. She is out shopping in the muggle world when she quite literally stumbled upon Potter’s fiancee, Lillian Evans. The squib woman with her quickly steadies them both before they can go toppling to the ground. Bellatrix quickly gives her sincerest apologies before turning to leave.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Evans calls after her causing her to stop and turn sharply. “Wait, you're- you're Heiress Bellatrix Black... right?”</p>
<p>“It’s Lady Bellatrix Lestrange now,” Bellatrix responds frowning confused. In all the years they've attended Hogwarts together the muggleborn hasn't spoken a word to her.</p>
<p>“Lillian Evans soon to be Lady Potter. Please, can you spare me a few minutes.” </p>
<p>“Why?” she asks suspiciously.</p>
<p>“We have a proposition for you.” the squib with Evans says as if that explains anything at all.</p>
<p>Bellatrix looks them both over before agreeing “Fine, but I’m not breaking the Statute of Secrecy and I have my honor as a Lady from two noble and ancient houses.”</p>
<p>“You can say no at any time.” Evans asures her before leading the way into a tea and coffee house. Evans puts up parseltongue secrecy wards the moment the waitress sits down their tea. Given that the only known speaker of parseltongue in the British Isles is widely believed to be The Dark Lord Voldemort, her interest is officially piqued. Previously she was considering simply drinking her tea and leaving.</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Rod! Rod!” Lady Bellatrix Lestrange sings once she has apparated back to Lestrange manor.</p>
<p>“Bella?” Lord Rodolphus Lestrange asks confused hesitantly holding a bouquet of roses and a box of goblin made jewelry. </p>
<p>“Oh, Rod, I have the most wonderful news!” Bellatrix squeals before beginning to twirl and dance.</p>
<p>“Bella, love. Can you come and sit down.” Rodolphus asked worriedly. “I fear you may have inhaled one of those muggles drugs again.”</p>
<p>“What? Why do you think that?” Bella asks plopping down on a chaise lounge confused and allowing him to run a scan over her magic, spirit, and physical body.</p>
<p>Lord Rodolphus Lestrange blinks confused when all three scans come up clean. “The scans are clean but you're happy. Why are you so happy?”</p>
<p>“Can't a soon to be mother be happy?” Bellatrix laughs causing Rodolphus to pale, his stomach twisting in horror and fear.</p>
<p>“What?” he chokes out looking to his wife imploringly. Has she cheated on him and on their honeymoon no less?</p>
<p>Bella, his hauntingly beautiful Bellatrix looked confused for a split second before understanding dawns on her face. “Oh, no, I would never!” Bellatrix gasps “Rod, I meant- Circe Rodolphus! I’ll never willingly cheat on you, Rodolphus, I swear it on my magic.” </p>
<p>Rodolphus relaxes as a golden glow overcomes them both.</p>
<p>“What is this about you becoming a mother then?”</p>
<p>“Lillian Evans, soon to be Lady Potter, and her older sister Petunia Dursley nee Evans approached me today, well technically I bumped into them,” Bellatrix says abashed before continuing. “We can't have an heir alone and apparently Evans and Potter are in a similar predicament. Evans was born infertile. To make matters worse, Molly Weasley nee Prewett sabotaged her womb during her first year at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“Merlin! Why hasn't she been sued?” Rodolphus exclaims horrified. “That's a crime worthy of being Kissed.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Bellatrix says unusually solem. “I had to explain it, but apparently the fact that the Weasley matriarch would be sure to get a death sentence didn't seem worth the publicity to Evans.”</p>
<p>“And this made you happy because?”</p>
<p>“Evans is going to talk to Potter but she asked me if I would be okay being their surrogate mother,” Bellatrix says with a shy smile to which Rodolphus responds by lifting Bella up and spinning her around smiling happily.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>There's a half-hearted argument with Lily, pitted against Sirius and James. Petunia, Severus, and Remus trade eye-rolls and commentary throughout the entire thing sitting behind a magical barrier drinking their tea. In the end, James and Sirius cave just as everyone knew they would. James is the one to contact Lady Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black and Lord Rodolphus Lestrange who agree to meet them at Grimmauld place the next day.</p>
<p>Sirius and Severus agree to be godfathers for the child and vow on their blood and magic to “Love and protect the heir Potter-Black even if we all end up dead or in Azkaban.” By the time he's born Heir Potter-Black’s name has long since been picked out. Heir Hadrian Jameson Regulus Potter-Black. Hadrian was chosen for the Potter family’s requirement to name heir’s after Kings and as a proper pureblood warrior name. Jameson to be shortened to James and to ensure the child's identity remains a secret until they’re ready. And the second middle name Regulus. Regulus was chosen for the child's lost Uncle who everyone bonded over, and to fulfill the Black family requirement of naming an heir after a star or a constellation. </p>
<p>The question of whose magic he takes after is answered mere hours after Bellatrix gives birth. Between his Grandmother Dorea, his Mother (aka Bellatrix) and the godfather ties to Sirius settling, little Hadrian has enough Black family blood and magic to change his entire appearance on a whim. “A little metamorph!” Sirius exclaims happily. Meanwhile Lily simply blinked back tears of happiness as her son changes his appearance to match her red hair, green eyes, and pale skin. </p>
<p>“Is that normal?” Petunia asks worriedly for her nephew while she holds her own son in her arms. Bellatrix had gone into labor during a simple visit for tea. It was quite a surprise for everyone present.</p>
<p>“If anything it's a sign he’ll be powerful and strong,” Bellatrix assures her proudly before giggling as her son hisses at the toy snake James reluctantly bought him. </p>
<p>“Seems like he has more of Lily's blood and magic then we first thought,” James says having long since gotten used to his wife’s bouts of parseltongue. He may not understand the snake language but it's a part of his wife's heritage and magic.</p>
<p>“You know,” Petunia says adjusting her son, Dudley, in her lap. “This reminds me a bit of the first time you saw a snake, Lily. You held an entire conversation before we realized what was happening.”</p>
<p>Hadrian Jameson Regulus Potter-Black becomes ‘Harry James Potter’ to the public. The last thing they need in this war is to bring Albus Dumbledore's hunt for the Hollows to their doorstep. The Peverell’s changed their surname to Potter for a reason. They don't want anyone to know just how dark their family really is. Despite all their preparations Lily and James take little Hadrian into hiding because, ritual and surrogacy or not, Hadrian was born to them at the end of July. With some reluctance, Peter Pettigrew is chosen as the Secret Keeper. They all have known Peter is a death eater since Bellatrix became Bella and Rodolphus became Rod.</p>
<p>Love is not actually the secret to how little Hadrian Potter-Black survives the killing curse. Albus Dumbledore would have killed his prophesied savior had he known the truth. There's a reason both Lillian and Hadrian can speak parseltongue and Voldemort's curse rebounded. Lords can't kill their Heirs, after all, magic prevents such atrocities. Hadrian is still left on the Dursleys doorstep in the dead of October’s last night by Albus Dumbledore. Meanwhile, all across Britain light wizards and witches celebrate the perceived defeat of the greatest Dark Lord since Grindelwald. The next morning Petunia Dursley nee Evans finds her nephew abandoned on her doorstep, and she screams.</p>
