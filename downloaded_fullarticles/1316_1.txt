<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus closed his eyes and counted to ten, trying to stave off the impulse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But something about twenty years a spy made it that he couldn't quite keep his goddamn mouth shut anymore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>(In more way than one.)</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Miss Granger?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn't really a question, because he knew it was her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There wasn't a lot of staff turnover at Hogwarts anymore, especially now that Defence Against the Dark Arts had been converted to Practical Defensive Magicks. And despite the distance he kept from his colleagues, he was familiar with the face of every human in the castle. In addition, he already knew (because he was on the hiring committee) that Hermione Granger had returned to teach, ten years after her graduation. So even though the figure ahead of him was... quite, </span>
  <em>
    <span>quite</span>
  </em>
  <span> soft... there was no one else this new person could be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Besides, her distinctive bushy curls were the same as always. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hearing him, the plump, abundant thighs ahead of him pivoted with a start - and he met the hazel eyes of his former student. She wore glasses now; that was another change. And there was a muted, far-away look in her eyes, even when she turned to address him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, hullo, </span>
  <em>
    <span>professor</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she spat with distaste and offence, and Severus mentally kicked himself. She certainly deserved the title of </span>
  <em>
    <span>professor </span>
  </em>
  <span>more than he did, since she’d gone on to a far higher level of education after Hogwarts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But, he tried to be smooth. Particularly since her large, heavenly breasts were visibly perky beneath her skin-tight cotton jumper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s been awhile,” he observed with some satisfaction, trying to ignore the predatory hunger that was rushing to his nethers. “Welcome to joining our staff, at long last. Though I must say - you could </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> have chosen a much more lucrative and rewarding career.” The sarcasm, he couldn’t help. If he was qualified to move out of Hogwarts in any way, he’d have done it long ago. But unfortunately, a master’s in potions and thirty years of pedagogical experience didn’t get a man very far these days… not when the Malfoys and their ilk ran the world outside of Hogwarts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph,” Hermione said, raising both eyebrows and staring him down.  It was a miracle how she was able to do that, when she couldn’t have been more than five feet two, in contrast to his full six and change. “I see the years have treated </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> well,” she observed with what was either a reluctant compliment or a faintly-cloaked zing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And it was true, either way. Severus was far too self-aware to play the fool whenever he met up with someone who he hadn’t seen in years. Time had, depending on your definition, either favored him with abundance or cursed him for his past sins. He preferred to think of it as the former, but in darker moments he felt the truth might be the latter. After all, gaining a good twenty-odd stone over the past decade had the perplexing effect of having both significant benefits and significant drawbacks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As they have </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” he responded with a practiced, nonchalant grin, feeling his chin sink into his soft submental fullness. He still wore high collars that produced a vicarlike effect. While once upon a time, the collars were just to conceal scars from his father’s belt on his upper back and neck, now it also hid the evidence of Nagini’s ghastly attack. At this point, to maintain the effect, he now had to wear gentler fabrics that didn’t chafe. There was too much jostling of excess flesh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She remained recognizable, though she was much changed from the last time he’d seen her, recoiling in wide-eyed horror in the Shrieking Shack while he bled nearly to death. For, despite his reciprocal jest, Professor Granger was not reciprocal in size: she </span>
  <em>
    <span>much</span>
  </em>
  <span> less rotund than him. Her belly, though soft and drooping past her hips, was more proportional to her frame, and it was complemented well by her wide shelf-like buttocks and heavy breasts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In contrast, despite his compact arse, he was literally as big around as he was tall, which he took perverse pride in declaring to any listeners willing to be astonished. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So, her larger body wasn’t truly </span>
  <em>
    <span>exceptional </span>
  </em>
  <span>in its size. She was within what could conceivably be thought of as </span>
  <em>
    <span>normal</span>
  </em>
  <span> fatness, the kind of fatness that while not negligible, was not remarkable. Whereas the sight of the obese Severus lumbering in one’s direction drew the eye with fascination and caught the breath with terror. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While he was making mental calculations regarding their relative differences in size, Hermione, for her part, laughed at the quip a little too readily. It was clear that she also considered her weight a sore spot. There was no other reason to have mental supplies of self-deprecating humor, constantly at the ready.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Though never mind that,” Severus entreated, deciding that he rather </span>
  <em>
    <span>liked </span>
  </em>
  <span>her. Not that he knew that much about her aside from what she’d done as a student, what she’d put on her resume for the hiring committee’s review, and what he could see of her now. It was, forgive the pun, a </span>
  <em>
    <span>gut </span>
  </em>
  <span>feeling. “It’s still a week until term starts, and I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>sick </span>
  </em>
  <span>of the milquetoast offerings at the Great Hall. How about we have dinner tonight, and catch up?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This took her genuinely by surprise. “I beg your pardon?” she asked, as if she couldn’t imagine his uttering a civil word to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dinner, tonight. Hogsmeade. I take it you’re not deaf?” All of a sudden, he began to realize how his offer might be perceived. “Not in any untoward way, I should add. Just as colleagues.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that all?” Of </span>
  <em>
    <span>course </span>
  </em>
  <span>she would beg the question. The girl always knew how to put him through his paces. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean,” Severus rumbled, trying to laugh off the obvious interest he knew he must be showing. It was doubly hilarious, in this moment, that he used to be a spy and master of inscrutability. His chubby face of the present made him </span>
  <em>
    <span>far </span>
  </em>
  <span>too easy to read. “I’m under no illusions that you might be interested in any other kind of invitation. I know I’ve grown about three times more hideous than I used to be.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, really?” Hermione asked, looking thoughtful. She scanned him up and down, as if she wasn’t entirely sure that she hated the sight of him. The tiny glimmer of hope in Severus’ heart suddenly blossomed into a flame. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then, she said, with such deceptive innocence: “I see no difference.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Knowing she had claimed victory in one fell swoop, she readjusted her book-bag on her shoulder and sauntered away, leaving Severus wounded and hating himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>……………… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus was the type who became </span>
  <em>
    <span>obsessed</span>
  </em>
  <span> with anything he couldn’t have. The first thirty-odd years of his life, he’d spent in abject petinance: slaving away at work, work, and more work; refusal of any kind of self-care including adequate food or sleep; denial of any possibility that he might benefit from a little love or kindness towards himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, Nagini bit him and the world turned upside down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’d survived the bite because he’d effectively vaccinated himself against the toxin. A few years before Voldemort’s defeat, Severus took great pains to obtain some droplets of venom from the snake, and he developed a compound that he could, with careful dosing, increase his tolerance for such an attack. This practice is known to us Muggles as mithridatism, and has been used throughout our history to avoid death by poisoning. In any case, it worked for Severus, as he expected it to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What he </span>
  <em>
    <span>had not </span>
  </em>
  <span>counted on, though, was losing so much weight over the years as he’d titrated up his doses. It was an elementary error and entirely embarrassing for an experienced potions master like himself. The doses he took, small though they were, made him chronically sick with irritable bowels and severe nausea. As a result, his already poor appetite doubled, and he became gaunter than ever. But for whatever reason, Severus never thought to resize his doses according to his change in body weight. This meant that proportionally, the toxicity of his doses had a greater effect than expected. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As a result, the healers said, he overtaxed his system - specifically (and oddly) his thyroid was the worst organic victim in his body. So after Nagini’s attack and his subsequent discontinuation of the toxin dosing regimen, he developed hypothyroidism. His metabolism was shot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This - combined with a sense of massive relief at being alive, and a renewed eagerness to enjoy all the fine things life could offer - spurred Severus’s appetite to overcompensate. Thus began his weight’s upward trajectory: not with a whimper, but a bang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He gained over thirty pounds the two weeks he was recovering in the hospital. Sixty over the next month. A hundred by the end of the summer. At which point, he was feeling a weight that was pleasant and healthy, and only slightly pudgy. Everyone agreed he was looking quite robust and hearty, quite in the pink of health. McGonagall was very pleased to see him retake his post as potions master while he ceded the headmastership to her capable hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But the problem was, he didn’t stop growing. Leading him to this point ten years later, where he had grown to the better part of a quarter-tonne, and he was sensitive about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not to mention, he was absolutely </span>
  <em>
    <span>mad </span>
  </em>
  <span>for food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>……………… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He went to dinner that night in Hogsmeade, petulant and irritable. Severus didn’t blame the younger professor one </span>
  <em>
    <span>bit </span>
  </em>
  <span>for that mean-spirited, petty comment. It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>he </span>
  </em>
  <span>who had been in the wrong, all those years ago, when he’d used those same words towards her, when she’d been hit by a curse that grew her front teeth. He hadn’t thought about that moment since it happened - there was far too much going on in his perpetually-persecuted mind at the time - but the moment she brought out those words! He remembered it like it was yesterday, and hung his head in shame. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he was seated at his favorite pub, in a quiet corner with a sturdy table and chair, he stirred his pint and thought bitterly about that former self of his. It wasn’t the first time he’d been caught unawares by the impact of some flippant arsehole comment he’d made. It was, however, the first time that it got in the way of his dick getting wet. Or, ahem, a prospective romantic interest? (Which very </span>
  <em>
    <span>idea </span>
  </em>
  <span>made him laugh.) </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t a big fan of men who put on a show of bravado for the women they liked, the James Potters of the world. But the only other way he knew to court a woman was in the Malfoy way: with expensive but understated gifts. This meant that Severus had remained a perpetual loner long after his obsession with Lily Evans had faded to a painful memory, since he didn’t have the kind of money to invest in a woman. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To be fair, there weren’t that many women in whom he actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>wanted </span>
  </em>
  <span>to invest, either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was something atypical about Severus, where he could almost successfully persuade himself that he didn’t need love or companionship. He could spend days on end without talking to anyone. He never felt that small-talk or frivolous socializing bettered his day. He rarely looked around and thought that his life might be improved with having another living being nearby. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Except! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, as he bitterly contemplated his ale, he was reconsidering this whole life-schema. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Truth be told, he’d been unconsciously questioning it for a while. He’d stopped attending weddings of students, whereas before he might attend if there were some interesting colleagues worth talking to, or if there was enough pressure from Minerva. He’d found his mother’s old wedding ring in storage and for some reason it was warming his sock drawer. He’d stopped in front of the Magical Menagerie’s window too many times, his eyes searching for a creature that might make his cold, empty flat a little cozier. He’d even been thinking about joining Poppy Pomfrey’s book club, though heaven knew what he’d find to </span>
  <em>
    <span>talk</span>
  </em>
  <span> about with all those fat old lesbians. (Probably a </span>
  <em>
    <span>lot</span>
  </em>
  <span> of things, he was scared to imagine!)  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Anyhow, as he was sitting there in the pub, wondering if he’d run out of time in his life to find that </span>
  <em>
    <span>thing </span>
  </em>
  <span>that made it all worth it...  he was delighted and surprised to see the older, stouter form of Hermione Granger marching in his direction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I decided that </span>
  <em>
    <span>petty</span>
  </em>
  <span> isn’t a good look for me,” she announced, huffing with her hurry, and she plopped herself down in the chair next to his. “I’m glad to find you in the second pub I’ve checked. I expect your invitation to dine is still open?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do I look busy?” Severus asked, trying to hide his astonishment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t really care if you do,” Hermione responded, and she waved down a waitress. “You’re the only adult in the castle with half a brain who doesn’t go to bed at eight o’clock sharp.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, you noticed that too?” he agreed, trying to hide a too-eager snicker. “What about Professor Longbottom?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I said </span>
  <em>
    <span>half </span>
  </em>
  <span>a brain, not a </span>
  <em>
    <span>quarter</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Hermione responded, rolling her eyes. “I adore him, but he doesn’t speak kvetch.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, in that case,” he said, and smirked as he heard her order two firewhiskeys on the rocks and the house special fry and chips. “That’s my native language.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oh yes, he </span>
  <em>
    <span>did </span>
  </em>
  <span>like her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Especially when she added, “You won’t make me eat alone, Snape,” and offered no opportunity for him to counter. He’d already had dinner, but before the waitress could mention that fact, Severus grandly agreed that he’d have what Hermione was having. He was a bit full, since he always ordered a double portion. But in the company of a pretty woman, he was eager for something to do with his mouth, so he wouldn’t put his foot in it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was already rare enough that, for some miraculous reason, a pretty and intelligent witch was sitting here chatting with him like it was the most natural thing to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What a strange course of events. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>………….. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “I’m just </span>
  <em>
    <span>sick </span>
  </em>
  <span>of it,” Hermione groaned, leaning back in her chair and stifling a hiccup. The brazen lack of shame she seemed to have? It made Severus’ mouth water with desire to kiss her, which was a very unusual experience for him. She’d cleaned her plate and vanquished her dessert too, and she was watching him pick at the </span>
  <em>
    <span>second </span>
  </em>
  <span>double-portion of fried fish he’d attempted this evening. All the chips were safely tucked away in his belly, and all that remained was the excessively-oily battered cod. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Believe me, I </span>
  <em>
    <span>do </span>
  </em>
  <span>understand,” Severus drawled, trying to avoid vocalizing the tight belch that was growing in his throat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I just… what business is it of </span>
  <em>
    <span>theirs </span>
  </em>
  <span>what my private </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking habits</span>
  </em>
  <span> are?” Hermione went on. “I was a fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>principal investigator</span>
  </em>
  <span>, not a… nun. But anyway, that’s why I left the ministry at long last. After all I had done for them, they call me out for disciplinary action for fucking… fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>nothing.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do agree. Though I’m no lawyer, this all sounds legally dubious,” Severus acknowledged, and he pushed his plate slightly towards the center of the table. “I think you might well have a case for wrongful disciplinary action. Though if you hadn’t quit in advance of termination, you’d probably have a stronger case.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With an aggravated sigh, she leaned forward. “I know - but what was I supposed to </span>
  <em>
    <span>do? </span>
  </em>
  <span>I didn’t want to be working with those buggers anymore, anyway, with what they put me through. Was I just supposed to sit there and </span>
  <em>
    <span>take it </span>
  </em>
  <span>while they looked for reasons to fire me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Severus said, looking down at the table thoughtfully. “But then again, I’m in no position to talk. I’ve had the same position for nearly thirty years, and too much of a coward to try and move on. Even when there wasn’t a </span>
  <em>
    <span>single</span>
  </em>
  <span> colleague who liked me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bollocks,” Hermione said, and looked at Severus with a lopsided smile. “You’re brilliant, and they’re fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>lucky </span>
  </em>
  <span>to have you. Even if you are a pain in the arse.” She hesitated, and then turned on some wide, imploring eyes. “On a side note - are you done with your fish?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s all yours,” he answered, and he hastily put a napkin to his mouth as the gas escaped of its own volition. “Clearly, I don’t need it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph,” Hermione grunted in gratitude, spearing the fish and putting it on her plate in a swift movement. The girl knew her way around a steak knife, Severus noticed with a rather inappropriate burst of attraction. It made him very susceptible to her next wily comment. “I must say, Snape - you didn’t manage to put away as much as I’d expect from a man of your… dimensions.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have a disgusting confession,” Severus responded, staring as Hermione raised a curious eyebrow. “This is my second supper of the night.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No!” Hermione exclaimed with a look of both fascination and revulsion. “I was </span>
  <em>
    <span>going</span>
  </em>
  <span> to say that you eat like a </span>
  <em>
    <span>bird</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that an insult to my masculinity, or my size?” Either way, he didn’t mind - he was feeling heady and hot with the microscopic attention to his appetite, and it made him feel like warm melted cheese inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take it however you want,” Hermione answered, a sly grin on her face. “But what’s the occasion for the indulgence?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A pretty woman giving me the time of night is an occasion, in my book,” Severus chuckled, resting a hand upon his over-taxed stomach and feeling its weight jostle beneath his fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione outright guffawed. “Sounds like you need a new book.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The mischievous smile in her eyes was one that suggested, she might be willing to help him write it. For better or for worse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>………….. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were both slightly tipsy as they strolled back to the castle - Severus less on alcohol and more on blooming infatuation. Hermione had drank a bit more than was best for her, and she cleaved tightly to his flabby arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you say,” Hermione said, sounding like she was proposing some adventure she expected him to reject. But her words trailed off as she seemed to get lost in the summer stars above them. She stopped, and he stopped, and they stared up into the night together, listening to each other breathing. Then, shaking her head, she went on, “What do you say to people who dislike you for superficial reasons?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This girl. Severus was too smitten; he adored her choice of words and the confidence with which she said them, tipsy or no. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re asking the wrong man, my dear,” his tongue rolled before he could stop himself from adding the informal address. “I’ve never been one to suffer fools gladly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Hermione said, and sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sensing that she wanted to talk, Severus gestured to a bench on the path ahead of them. Granted, he always needed a sit-down on this walk anyway - lugging around his four-hundred-pound-and-change body didn’t happen without a great deal of accommodation. He was quietly grateful for the opportunity to recuse himself from standing without embarrassment. They walked to it and settled there, and to his surprise he felt her hand wandering down his arm. She didn’t touch his fingers or palm, but she did grasp his wrist and the top of his hand, in almost a clinical way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was, actually, in a clinical way, he realized with a start. She was looking at her watch and taking his pulse. He tried to hide how labored his breathing was, and involuntarily sucked in his gut. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not terrible,” she assessed after a moment. “Not great, either. But for your size, not terrible.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” he muttered, more humiliated than he could express in words. “Always reassuring to get a miniature health exam after a date. Works wonders on my self-esteem.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her pause hit hard and cold. “Was this a date?” Hermione asked, looking at him with wide and surprised eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His face turned to stone then, and his heart prepared to ice over as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then her face broke, and she burst into giggles. “I </span>
  <em>
    <span>can’t </span>
  </em>
  <span>believe how gullible you are,” she practically squealed. “I didn’t mean that… I… I’m sorry, I’m drunk.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, this didn’t actually answer the question, but Severus seemed to gauge that the answer was closer to a </span>
  <em>
    <span>yes </span>
  </em>
  <span>than a </span>
  <em>
    <span>no. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’d take it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not drunk,” he responded, but with a sly, approving, grin, he added, “perhaps a bit punchy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She seemed to try and respond, but was interrupted by an eruption of giggles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor Granger,” Severus said carefully, not sure if they had passed the point where they could drop the formality. “To address your bigger question: I suppose the wise answer to people who dislike you for superficial reasons is to ignore them.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Those </span>
  <span>who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind," Hermione said with bated breath, staring up at the sky again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I suppose so,” Severus responded, feeling suddenly very old and very heavy. He wondered if she was referencing something. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A few quiet moments passed, and Severus closed his eyes to focus on his breathing. But something wasn’t right, and he recalibrated himself to the present to look at Hermione. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was shocked to see her face wet with tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It really brought it home to him then, how much she must have had to drink. He’d seen female students get weepy like this, at the turn of a hat, as he escorted them to the hospital wing after intervening in their drunken loitering in the astronomy tower after curfew. This situation was unsettling for many reasons. It was a reminder that she was quite a lot younger than him, and had once been his student. It was a reminder that she was a woman, and he was a man, and that perhaps he was pushing the bounds of acceptability by sitting with her right now, out of doors, possibly on a date.  It was a reminder that it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>late</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and it was a reminder that it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>dark</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and it was a reminder that she might not even feel safe with him. Or, worse - that she did feel safe with him, too safe… like he was some kind of enuch because of his being so morbidly obese. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a reminder that this woman was frail and sad, and it was a reminder that human emotions were a necessary component of relationships, and bloody </span>
  <em>
    <span>hell </span>
  </em>
  <span>it was a reminder that he </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> wasn’t good at this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Also, it was a reminder that whatever this evening was, it was coming close to its natural end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let me get you home,” he suggested, trying his best to sound warm. “This walk gets very cold, very quickly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you say so.” She seemed completely like a different person: that bright and sparkling confidence had faded away entirely, leaving behind a nervous, muted ghost of her former self. It was eerie, and Severus felt grossly ill-equipped to help. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Particularly when he stood up, and she stood up, and she buried his head in his shoulder, and she whimpered:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck </span>
  </em>
  <span>have I ended up like this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>………….. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus didn’t know how to answer, but he did escort her back to the castle as swiftly as he could. It was later than he expected, and by the time they got back to the staff entrance, the dew point had set in and they were both shivering. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His flat was closest, and he bundled them both inside before he had a chance to think better of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Have a splash from the decanter,” he bade her as he looked frantically around for a couple of blankets. “I’ll get us some warm things.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Trying to get me drunk, Snape?” Hermione joked, her good humor somewhat restored despite her chattering teeth. “Have it your way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He found a warm kettle and some not-too-dingy cups, and brought these and some digestives to the main room. Hermione had lit the fire and was bent before it, staring into the little flame with the undue fascination that comes with sleepiness. She sipped a three-finger glass of whiskey, but Severus didn’t remark on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To be honest, he was realizing how this situation looked on the surface, and he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>terrified</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He couldn’t ever remember having a woman in his rooms before, much less a </span>
  <em>
    <span>date</span>
  </em>
  <span>. His eyes glanced over the dusty corners, the forgotten cobwebs, the piles of books and leftover tea tray from this afternoon… it felt like a mess, and he wished he’d had a chance to prepare the space for it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a nice fire,” he complimented, feeling stupid and low as he observed her. “Once you’re… warmed up...do you know your way back to your flat from here?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think so,” Hermione said, and turned to look at him with glassy eyes. “I mean, if you object to me staying the night, I can go now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He felt his heart nearly stop. “You intend to… stay the night?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, you know.” Hermione laughed, but it was somewhat forced. “You ate a second dinner for me. I expect that’s what you’re hoping for.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Too shocked to speak, he settled down into his easy-chair with a thump. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What… what I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>hoping for </span>
  </em>
  <span>is none of your concern,” he said carefully, his breath tight and jagged. “What is it, Miss Granger, that </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>are hoping for?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The words settled heavily in the room between them, and Hermione appeared as startled as if she’d been smacked upside the head with a hardbound copy of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts, a History</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Hermione answered after some consideration, and she carefully put down the glass and buried her face in her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then instead of leaping into bed with a man you scarcely know,” Severus said, trying to sound as gentle as possible, but feeling the pangs of judgment emerge from his lips nonetheless, “let’s talk, and listen, and then I’ll take you down the hall to your chambers. There is no expectation, on my part, of anything in particular, other than a good conversation. That is the single best way to get the measure of a person.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So that’s a no to sex?” Hermione asked, turning her face upwards and glaring at him with a ferocity he hadn’t expected. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” He stared at her in response, trying to gauge what on </span>
  <em>
    <span>earth </span>
  </em>
  <span>she was on about. “Isn’t that… better?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not when I’ve been fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>dying of lonliness,</span>
  </em>
  <span> it’s not!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The intensity of her statement made him feel like he’d been slapped across the face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So,” Severus said, trying to ascertain the right course of action. “You would be insulted if I… did not bed you tonight?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione glared at him, but realized there was some incongruity within her thoughts. “I… yes. All right, Snape? Never mind. It’s ruined now. I… just forget it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked miserable, her face filled with shadows of rejection and pain, and she rose to her feet. “Ciao,” she said, throwing the blanket on the chair and making towards the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus hadn’t leaped up so fast from his chair in years. Before Hermione could escape, he pressed her with full force against the wall, almost hard enough to make her head hit. He trapped her on both sides with his arms, and he leaned his face towards hers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Granger,” he rumbled, like someone stirring purple coals, “I want to make one thing </span>
  <em>
    <span>intensely </span>
  </em>
  <span>clear.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her face, in its surprise, was bright and sincere, and her breathing was just as shallow and heaving as his. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want you to know,” Severus said with fierce purposefulness, “that I have </span>
  <em>
    <span>never</span>
  </em>
  <span>, </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever </span>
  </em>
  <span>wanted to ravish a woman more than I have wanted to ravish you tonight.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This seemed to amuse her, and she giggled at the sight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The only thing stopping me,” Severus breathed, leaning into her ear and whispering with fine, arching tones, “is that you’re a bit </span>
  <em>
    <span>too </span>
  </em>
  <span>drunk for me to take seriously. After all,” he went on, and stood back with firm, immovable certainty. “I remain puzzled. Why would the brightest witch of your generation want anything to do with this washed-up sad sack of a man?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The response was one he wasn’t expecting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You… you think I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>bright</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which question, unfortunately, validated all of his fears and confirmed </span>
  <em>
    <span>precisely </span>
  </em>
  <span>why he couldn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>possibly </span>
  </em>
  <span>ravish the beautiful but forlorn Professor Granger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
