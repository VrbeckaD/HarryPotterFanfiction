    <p>Trelawney spoke, "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches… born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies…" The man at the door heard no more. He left hurriedly to get to his master.</p><p>
  <em>Three Days Later</em>
</p><p>Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone. Then a blinding, jagged jet of light flew through the air. Snape dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hands.</p><p>"Don't kill me!"</p><p>"That was not my intention."</p><p>Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.</p><p>"Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?"</p><p>"No-- no message-- I'm here on my own account!"</p><p>Snape was wringing his hands: he looked a little mad with his straggling, black hair flying around him.</p><p>"I-- I come with a warning -- no, a request -- please --"</p><p>Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them silence fell on the spot where he and Snape face each other.</p><p>"What request could a Death Eater make of me?"</p><p>"The -- the prophecy … the prediction … Trelawney…"</p><p>"Ah, yes," said Dumbledore. "How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?"</p><p>"Everything -- everything I heard!" said Snape. "that is why-- it is for that reason -- he thinks it means Lily Evans!"</p><p>"The prophecy did not refer to a woman." said Dumbledore. "It spoke of a boy born at the end of July.--"</p><p>"You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down -- kill them all--"</p><p>"If she means so much to you," said Dumbledore, "Surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?"</p><p>"He wouldn't honor my request. He would still kill them all. Please, I am asking you to protect her, protect them all."</p><p>"And what will you give me in return, Severus?"</p><p>"In -- in return?" Snape gaped at Dumbledore, after a long moment he said, "Anything, I will give you anything."</p><p>
  <em>Six Months Later</em>
</p><p>It had been the right move. James hadn't believed it was a good idea. The man had been the last person to want to keep James Potter safe. James thought the bastard would betray them. He hadn't. Peter had. Severus had created a potion to transfer their magic to Harry's temporarily. He had agreed to be their secret keeper. Severus was the only one they could guarantee wasn't on Lord Voldemort's side. Here they were standing in Harry's room. A pile of ash on the floor, a one year old reaching up to a man in a white Death Eater mask. Giggling. Lily crying on the floor. James holding her.</p><p>"We did it! It worked James, it worked." She said to her husband as the Death Eater looked down at the baby. James hugged his wife tighter to him.</p><p>"S-- Se-- Sesus!" The baby said, still reaching up to the Death Eater. The man leaned down and lifted him up. The boy pulled the mask off of the man. Lily gasped.</p><p>"That is not my name, Brat!" James snorted.</p><p>"He's one year old. Give him a break! How does he always know it's you, Severus?" Lily asked.</p><p>"I do not know, but it seems he's a lot stronger than we suspected. The brat just survived the killing curse and rebounded it back at his attacker."</p><p>James snorted again, "or we are stronger than you thought."</p><p>"Not likely, Potter," Severus sneered.</p><p>
  <em>Four years later</em>
</p><p>"Come on, Sesus! Come play!" the five year old tugged on his robes.</p><p>"That is not my name!" Harry giggled.</p><p>"I am so sorry, Se-ver-us." Harry prolonged each syllable of Severus' name while mimicking his tone of voice.</p><p>"Brat." Severus' lip twitched. James laughed.</p><p>"Oh, leave the boy alone, Severus. He's only five," Lily announced as she entered the room with a tray of tea floating behind her. "Go play with him. He has a new toy he wants to show his Sesus." Lily grinned. James grumbled.</p><p>"I still can't believe you bought him that thing. He's going to blow the house up." James thought for a moment while looking at Severus as he picked up his son. "They are going to blow up the house." he deadpanned.</p><p>
  <em>Five years later</em>
</p><p>"Sesus! You made it!" Harry came flying down the stairs and jumped halfway down. Severus dropped his bag to catch Harry.</p><p>"That is not my name, Brat!" Severus waved his hand so his bag would follow him.</p><p>"Brat isn't mine either, but you still call me that," Harry quipped back.</p><p>Severus shook his head and changed the subject, "What if I hadn't caught you?"</p><p>"You always catch me." Harry wrapped his arms around the older man's neck, snuggled into Severus' arms, and kissed his cheek. "Are you staying to open presents in the morning?"</p><p>"Yes, your mother asked me to stay like I have every year."</p><p>"Good," Harry leaned up to Severus' ear, whispering, "I have a sure fire plan to catch Santa Clause this year." Snape laughed.</p><p>"What incompetent plan did you concoct this year?"</p><p>
  <em>Three years later</em>
</p><p>"Sesus!" Harry barged up the stairs past the Griffin and into the Headmaster's office.</p><p>"That is not my name!" Severus said absently. "What do you want, Brat?"</p><p>Harry laughed, "That's not my name either. I wanted to see you. Why didn't you tell me this summer that you were going to be the headmaster?"</p><p>Snape raised one eye-brow, "since when do I answer to you?”</p><p>Harry sat on the Headmasters desk, laying his head on Severus' shoulder, "since you love me!" Harry giggled. He kissed Severus' cheek. "I just wanted to say congratulations. See you in class." Harry rushed out the door as Severus just shook his head.</p><p>
  <em>Three years later</em>
</p><p>"Crap!" Harry's eye bulged out of their sockets. "Don't you know how to knock!?"</p><p>Severus laughed, "Please, Brat. I used to change your diapers."</p><p>"Don't remind me!" Harry turned the color of a tomato as he tugged a shirt over his head. "What did you want, Severus?"</p><p>"You didn’t show up for class today."</p><p>"What do you care? You aren't teaching." Harry snapped. "You haven't taught anything since you became Headmaster. Hell, I'm surprised you even noticed I was missing. You're always so busy now."</p><p>Severus sighed, "Lupin asked where you were when you didn't show up for Defense. I didn't even know you had skipped Potions. How many classes did you skip today? You know your mother is worried about you?"</p><p>"If you must know, all of them. Of course its not like you care, always for Mum, besides when did you and Remus become such best friends?" Harry growled and grabbed his jacket before shoving past Snape. "I wish you and Lupin would stay out of my life!" the boy slammed the door shut.</p><p>
  <em>Three hours later</em>
</p><p>"I'm sorry, Mum." Harry sniffed.</p><p>Lily shook her head, "It's okay darling. Dad and I were just worried about you."</p><p>"I don't know what's gotten into me lately," Harry took the tea his mother offered him.</p><p>"You're a teenager and you're jealous." Lily smiled.</p><p>"Jealous? Of what? That doesn't even make sense, Mum."</p><p>"Your Sesus, doesn't give you as much of his time as he used to. Have you thought of just telling him you want to spend more time with him? Ask him to help you with your classwork maybe?" Lily suggested.</p><p>"He's too busy," Harry shrugged. "It's okay. Um… I should get back to school before my friends send out a search party."</p><p>"Okay darling." Lily watched Harry walk to the front gate and Apparate away before she spoke again, this time to a seemingly empty door way. "You should make more time for him, Severus. Stop lurking and come in." The man in question rounded the corner to join them in the living room.</p><p>“I was just making sure he was safe. He would not have appreciated my presence.”</p><p>"I never thought I would say this, but-" James paused, "she's right. You should spend more time with him. He just misses you."</p><p>Severus nodded.</p><p>
  <em>One year later</em>
</p><p>"Hey, Severus, what am I missing?" Harry plopped his essay down in front of the Headmaster. Snape rolled his eyes.</p><p>"You always forget the aconite."</p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p>"Language young man," Severus reprimanded.</p><p>"Yes, Sesus!" Harry said. It dripped in sarcasm.</p><p>"You haven't called me that in years," Severus commented and watched Harry's face turn pink. The sixteen year old shrugged and changed the subject. "What are you doing?"</p><p>Snape closed the file he was working on and chuckled, "smooth, a surprise, Brat. Off to the train with you. I'll see you for your birthday."</p><p>"Okay, see you in a few weeks," Harry leaned in and kissed Severus' cheek before bounding out of the office. Severus smiled, touched his cheek and went back to the file titled. <b>Task One.</b></p>
