    <p>
  <span>Nine months, three weeks, four days. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s all it had taken for each and every one of their plans to go to pot. For the fragility of their meager resistance to be revealed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her trip to Knockturn ended up happening two weeks prior to the expected date, the timing moved forward as a necessity when Remus bungled his last bundle of dried Wolfsbane. The man was terribly inept for someone who’d needed the potion for most of his entire life and Hermione couldn’t tell if it was because he’d never needed to brew it himself or that he’d refused to do so. She leaned into it being the second option, the man was more than stubborn enough to dismiss knowing it out of some sort of resentment. In the end the reasoning didn’t matter. His meager skills resulted in three months worth of flowers being destroyed in a single afternoon, leaving Hermione scrambling to make up the difference.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The plant was often known to be finicky and hard to cultivate for even the most experienced of Herbalists. Being that all they had was one half trained student and a mountain of nearly illegible books, the task was nigh on impossible. Their only other option to obtain the plant was to snatch it up where it grew wild, a task that would also prove to be fairly impossible. All of the remaining known patches were guarded by Fenrir’s most experience pack-mates and watched at all hours by the guard dogs. Anyone who was foolish enough to go out looking for the flower were far more likely to end up joining his pack, or in the case of Order and Resistance members, end up dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All told, the task of obtaining the necessary ingredient to help Remus keep his wits about him was looking decidedly grim. It was decided that Knockturn Alley was their best bet by far after a loud and protracted shouting match between Harry and the retired Professor. And Hermione ended up being the one to draw the lucky straw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not to say that they weren’t all short straws. In theory it could have been anyone. In reality it was always going to be her. If only because she had the least to lose if something went wrong. No family to write back to, no family members coordinating supply networks from outside countries, no pureblood family members working as spies to pull strings and information from inside the WIzengamot. Nor was she the face of a generation, the reluctant hero clamoring to stoke the fires of the masses into fighting for their freedom. She was simply a bright, if resourceful, witch. Always friendly to those around her and living with nothing else to her name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so on that fateful night she’d found herself in Knockturn. It was the one place she’d always been told to avoid, now turned into one of the last remaining safe havens for the Resistance to purchase much-needed supplies. The multitude of winding back alley’s and hidden passages had become a balm to the Resistance clandestine activities since the economy of the space almost immediately switched over to service the Light after the Dark Lord had risen. Shops and proprietors of banned materials immediately jumped on the sudden need for smuggled goods. Post-War Britain suddenly needing a way to supply its underbelly in the wake of the regime change, Knockturn had been more than happy to oblige.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’d been through fifteen shops by the time that two hours had passed, two hundred galleons lighter and a pocket stuffed to bursting with dried plants. It was a lucky night. When she left to head back she followed the known back routes in an effort to reach a side entrance to Muggle London, hoping to be in and out before anyone could recognize her and alert the authorities. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luck, however, seemed to have other ideas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she wound her way deeper into the underbelly of Diagon the scar on her arm began throbbing and itching in a sure fire sign that something was amiss. Throwing her initial caution to the wind she picked up the pace, long black cloak flapping against her legs and hood battering about as she struggled to keep it securely over her head. A gust of wind blew down off the stormy tops of the buildings to collect and funnel through the alley she wandered, billowing her cloak out and ripping her hood away from her head. Hermione turned around as fast as she could, worried as she was at being recognized by anyone, body halting and feet planting securely. When she thought back on that moment she couldn’t decide it the action had saved her or doomed her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When her right foot landed onto the ground a bolt of green spellfire jettisoned out from behind an adjacent alley that remained shrouded in darkness, shooting past the space she would have occupied had she kept walking forward. It split through the air to ring out with intense speed before crashing in through a shop window to continue on into a wall. When it finally stopped an explosion blew out the ruptured shop, debris and shrapnel flying from the broken windows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She threw herself into a turn that dropped her stance and narrowed the target she made, wand dropping into her hand and reflexes ready for a fight. Instead of remaining still she began backing up slowly centimeter by centimeter, nearly covering a meter before the cackling began. It drove a wedge of fear and ice down into her belly while the hairs on the back of her arms and neck began standing to attention. Panic rose up to fill every cell in her body while her mind switched automatically from </span>
  <em>
    <span>fight</span>
  </em>
  <span> to </span>
  <em>
    <span>flight.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She pushed off with her leading food before diving backwards and turning into apparition at the same moment, only to feel a solid wall instead of the sideways tug that should have been there. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Anti-Apparition,’</span>
  </em>
  <span> she belatedly thought to herself, fear spiking another notch as her lifeline was ripped away. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Fuck.’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned back to face the direction of her attacker, her body backing up slowly as she covered the sides of the alley in quick glances. A thin shadow stepped apart from an alcove provided by a side street, green dress swishing at pale knees and dark hair bouncing as the figure leaned backwards to laugh. No one else stood by her side or behind her, a stroke of luck no matter the remaining circumstances.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With blazing speed Hermione managed to get the next shot off before Bellatrix could continue her initial assault, a green bolt of her own flying forward as fast as she could send it. All the while as she moved the scar on her arm was burning, acerbic and sharp, a tell tale sign that this was the real deal and not a polyjuiced enforcer as had been the case in the past. If she didn’t manage to land these shots then she was in for a world of trouble. With a sound like a door slamming the spell hit home, only to ricochet off with a flick of the woman’s wrist. The rebounding spell smashed down into the cobblestone near their feet before sending up a volley of dust and broken rubble. Hermione could only stand there in astonishment at the quick spellwork the woman wielded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, well, well. If it isn’t Potter’s icky little Mudpup,” the woman crooned out in infantile mockery, “What a catch for lil’ ol’ Bellatrix. Feisty too! But you’ll need to try harder than that, girlie,” Bellatrix shot forward as a flurry of spells were unleashed from her crooked wand, one right after the other in lightning succession that moved almost faster than Hermione could see. Without any conscious thought Hermione brought up a shield charm that bolted onto her free hand, holding it up and forward as if it was a true shield of old. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The resounding crack of spell on ward resounded throughout the small space, the numerous collisions numbing the arm Hermione blocked with. Each strike pushed her back slightly, feet skidding along with the momentum of the incoming curses. Bit by bit the dark witch’s spells ground into Hermione’s shield, eroding it and widening the already visible cracks. She knew she couldn’t continue on the defensive like this as Bellatrix’s reserves were large and untapped, while her own were low and shredded with emaciation brought on by months on the run. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thinking quickly she twisted slightly to get her wand aimed towards the middle point between the two witches. One, two, three, the red trails of light flew out from her wand to smash against the ground one right after the other until a nearly meter wide hole had been excavated. The buildings on either side of the alley shuddered and rocked when the surface below them weakened to the point of no longer to bear the load. Hermione used the distraction and cover to drop her shield and take off in the opposite direction. She could hear cursing once the dust had risen enough to obscure Bellatrix from her vision, deafened as she was by her own feet skidding out from beneath her as she lunged off to the side and into an open alleyway. Her lungs and throat burned as she inhaled as much air as she could to feed her rampant retreat, her strides lengthening as she fought to make a clean escape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One final dive to the right ended up landing her in a deserted little alcove barely wide enough for her to walk straight through as bricks on either side began pressing against her shoulders. She stood her ground in silence to hear for any sign of pursuit while her body began to shake with all the exertion of her escape. The past few months of little nutritious food, combined with constant movement as they sought to evade Voldemort’s regime, had combined to wear apart her endurance and health until it was a shade of what it had once been. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned to press her back up against the cold brick wall before slowly sitting down on the dirty cobblestones. She wrapped arms around her knees, wand still in hand and pointing out the way she’d come in, hunkering quietly as she could while she waited out the clock. Five minutes passed before she was able to convince herself that no one was coming after her, another five passed by while she waited for her painfully cramping muscles to come loose. Eventually though, she knew she’d need to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With her still numbed shield arm Hermione pushed herself up and off of the ground until she was in a kneeled position, head peeking down the alleyway as she checked one last time. When nothing strange met her attention she stood and headed further into the darkness, hopeful she’d escaped the boundaries of the anti-apparition wards. If she wasn’t then she’d need to continue on foot until she either found a way to Muggle London or reached a secure portkey. Neither of which were likely to be easy, and so her hopes went with the apparition. Settling her mind and envisioning where she needed to be, Hermione turned in with a rush of magic to apparate back to the safe house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rather, that had been her intention. The result was decidedly different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of ending up in a pub twenty kilometers away, Hermione found herself being yanked sideways before suddenly finding herself thrust onto the ground with a mighty heaving motion that stole her breath and nearly blinded her with nausea. The buildings surrounding her shook as she tried to right her head, body automatically tensing as she tried to determine whether she’d splinched herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thought you could get away, did you Muddy?” A voice above her started up, sickly sweet and all false innocence. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘No, no, no!’</span>
  </em>
  <span> The terror returned to bite its way through her doubled vision, stomach changing with a flip from nausea at ruined travel to the striking nausea of fear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We cooked it up special for you lot,” the voice spoke again before a body dropped to straddle her waist in imitation of their last meeting. “I’ll have to let Rookwood know that it works,” Bellatrix whispered out against Hermione’s ear, her whole body laying flat atop Hermione as though she could press her way through her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get, off, you bitch!” Hermione pushed with all her might, hips rising and chest heaving as she fought to dislodge the crazed Death Eater. Each movement brought a short staccato of laughter from the witch above her, the short stature of her attacker hiding a hidden strength.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tsk, tsk, little miss. That’s some rather rude language, don’t you think?” Bellatrix leaned down to speak directly against the shell of Hermione’s ear, warm breath ghosting her skin and cheek. “Considering how you’re just a lost little Mudpup, I’d think it’s only charitable of me to take you in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you!” Hermione focused all her movement and energy in an upwards buck, trying again to dislodge the woman. Bellatrix merely rode the movement out before coming back to settle around her waist and clamp strong thighs around Hermione’s torso.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sweetie it’s only the second date, I hardly think it’s time for something like that. It’s improper,” Bellatrix punctuated her words with a swift bite against the skin of Hermione’s neck, teeth digging in and a scream of pain erupting from the young witch’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah!! Get </span>
  <em>
    <span>off!!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The teeth released their sharp hold on Hermione’s skin, Bellatrix rearing back to swipe at her bloodied lips with long nailed fingers, pink tongue darting out to taste the pain she’d wrought. “Right now wouldn’t be the proper time Pet, much as I’d love to,” sharp fingers reached down to pinch at Hermione’s cheeks, “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> quite pretty, even filthy as you are. But I think I should let others know that you’re off limits.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A flash of crackling black sparks covered the witch’s hand as Bellatrix wove a silencing charm all throughout Hermione’s throat, leaving her wordless as she struggled to escape. A second spark of magic brought a shimmer of black mist to from between her fingers, the space coalescing into a hauntingly familiar knife. One final burst from the witch’s palm had iron chains pressing up out of the ground before heavy metal wound its way around Hermione’s arms and legs until she was pulled taut into a cross pose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With practiced ease Bellatrix traced the line of Hermione’s right arm with the knife, a mad glint to her eyes and sharp smile on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>mine,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Pet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Hermione finally awoke, freezing, shivering, bundled up with too many blankets and shoved to the corner of a borrowed living room, she wasn’t quite sure whether she was truly alive. Her mind burst forth into rapid thought and retrospection while her thoughts coalesced and focused on the words of her Grandfather, now long gone. He’d taken a liking to her when she was little, a tiny pip of nothingness, all frizzy hair and too many questions. She wasn’t sure how it had come about but one day she’d asked him about Hell, and how hot he thought it was. He’d taken her aside to sit her tiny form upon his knee, and spoken at great length on his belief that hell wasn’t warm. That it was ice and frozen tundra, a world without movement or light. It had been an odd conversation, what with Hermione being younger than eight and having no truly defined concept of Heaven or Hell, but his words had stuck with her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now as she woke up in that room with blankets piled up on top of her, while she shivered and shook from a phantom coldness that spread across her from skin to bone, she couldn’t help but wonder if that was where she was. If Bellatrix had finally finished the job.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ronald greedily shoving Vienna sausages into his mouth with a greasy hand and lack of table manners brusquely sent those thoughts flying away.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘I made it.’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She remained huddled there in quietude as her body continued rebuilding strength. Her head bobbed from side to side as she took in all the damage and her nerves fought through the mass of pain that had become her right arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘Mione,” Ronald spoke, obviously sighting her shifting back and forth, “Good ta’ see you’re awake.” His voice was muffled as he spoke around a mouthful of processed meat and his eyes barely glanced over her as he did so. She leaned up from her huddled position until her back was firmly pressed against the wall, covers sliding off of her to pool about her waist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long was I out?” Her voice was scratchy and broken from the result of who knew how many screams, sleep blurring her vision as she looked further around the empty room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eighteen hours. Neville was out for maybe twelve. Should be upstairs somewhere.” Ronald shifted in his seat as he spoke, the tin can of sausages placed gently onto the table in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did she do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” he turned to stare at the ground, long copper hair obscuring his face from Hermione’s vision, “She carved you up real good. Neville swore she was about to kill you when he finally showed up. Not sure how he got away honestly, odds should ‘ave swung the other way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Neville knows what he’s doing. I’ll have to thank him later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And apologize to Kingsley while you’re at it. He’s right pissed you needed rescuing in the first place,” he straightened up on the small couch he had to himself. “It was supposed to be routine, in an’ out. Why didn’t you apparate out first sign that things were amiss?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I tried,” she retorted, anger at his question bringing a flush to her chest and cheeks, “I couldn’t. They had the area blocked off with anti-apparition wards. When I got away I tried it again, but she managed to redirect it somehow. I ended up right next to her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How in the bloody blue blazes did she manage that? Apparition can’t be redirected.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” her reply was colored by anger, “I didn’t exactly get a chance to exchange notes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, course not, she just ended up leaving the one on you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whatever anger Hermione had been able to hold onto was ripped right away with his comment, the wind falling straight from her sails. She sighed and leaned back further into the wall before choosing a point across the room to lock her eyes onto.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did she write.” Hermione’s voice was quiet as she brought her left hand to the edge of her right sleeve to slowly pull the fabric up and reveal a bandage running from the tip of her wrist to the curve of her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll see it eventually,” Ronald replied, his voice subdued and apologetic, “Don’t dwell on it. We managed to staunch the bleeding. Gin wasn’t sure she could do it at first. Three blood replenishment potions, a full vial of dittany oil. Would have been more but Seamus was making rounds, took over once he saw how bad a shape you were in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione turned to look at him with the ghost of a smile on her face, grateful for whatever aid her comrades had been able to render. With a push of effort she stood up from the pile of blankets before stretching out her burning limbs, aches and pains inventoried all around her body. The scars seemed to burn the most, but that was par for the course. Cursed wounds never healed properly and it seemed Hermione’s new one wasn’t going to be an exception. With deft fingers she unlaced the wrappings on her arm, starting at the top and letting it unravel to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, ple-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” her harsh tone cut him off, “I need to see what she wrote.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bit by bit her arm was uncovered as the blood stained bandage gave way to the red gashes of Bellatrix’s knife.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>PROPERTY OF BELLATRIX</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The words were cut into her flesh with far neater writing than the slur on her other arm. The letters started right below her wrist to continue on in a curve up the inside of her forearm, the final word ending just below the top of her shoulder. The slice marks tingled and burned where the curse continued to reside, a constant hum of pain that she knew would eventually fade into the background.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix had staked her claim.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>Six months later</em>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mother!” Bellatrix shouted up the long stairwell in front of her, voice carrying out through the ancient hallways. “Mother, I’m coming up!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sharp boots pounded against the wooden stairs to wring out creaks and groans from the weakening wood. The sound practically thundered as she headed up through the tight space. When she reached the landing she breathed deeply and settled her mind, mentally preparing herself to face the old hag. Deep beneath her veins she could feel the incessant thrum of magic coming from the basement, easy to ignore but present nonetheless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Black Manor was a massive estate that stood nearly twice as large as her younger sister’s Manor. In her flagging years Druella Black née Rosier had chosen the topmost floor for herself. The space was dank and disused in the best of times but with only two elves remaining and the ancient woman far from her glory days, the space had only gotten worse. Druella was unlikely to care though, not with cancer rotting her guts and the darkness downstairs pulling at her fraying mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a press of her hand Bellatrix pushed open the doorway leading towards the parlor kept on this floor, ancient carpeting bunching beneath the door to jam her entrance. With a shove she opened the space up and let light fall from the hallway into the interior. It was dark as always, one fire only embers and the other out, all the remaining thin light of the room provided by two single sconces. The air was heavy with the sweet smell of rot and molded books, a consequence of the rooms on this floor being far more humid than the rest of the Manor. All around her were the last vestiges of her mother’s sanity; old books, clothing, paintings and portraits she adored, a long table filled to bursting with silver knickknacks that she’d picked up on her honeymoon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The mantle above the lit fireplace was filled from end to end with pictures of Bellatrix and her sisters, some older, some younger. All had been taken before Andromeda was disowned. With practiced steps Bellatrix approached the familial shrine as the ghost of a smile crossed her face. With a slight frown she set each picture with Andy face down upon the marble, unwilling and unable to deal with the looping visage of her wayward sister.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mother, where are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Pop!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix startled at the sound of an apparating house elf, the little creature hopping from foot to foot in a ruined bed sheet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mistress Bellatrix, the- the Lady Black is in the Library,” it said as it moved forward, almost touching her. Bellatrix deftly sidestepped the ancient looking elf to let it’s wrinkled hand grasp at empty air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Which library? Her personal one or the one downstairs? And why did neither of you greet me at the door,” her voice deepened into a growl, “You know the rules Tinker.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tinker is so sorry Mistress Bellatrix, b-b-but Tinker is, TInker was,” the elf bowed down to scrape its head against the floor while its voice turned to a mush of emotion and tears, “The Lady Black was pained and requested solitude, Tinker and Lopsy were made to wait outside, the Lady Black has barred entrance and will not respond!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That peaked Bellatrix’s interest in a rather morbid manner. That the woman had enough sense left to hide herself away was rather unusual. For the most part her flagging years had been characterized by a reluctance to leave her own mind, the call of Blood and darkened memories too great for her to escape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Show me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She followed the diminutive elf out of a second set of doors to emerge into a small and narrow hallway. Three doors lined either side, each heading into a room claimed by her mother. At the farthest end of the hallway stood the other remaining elf pounding harshly against the door with its undersized fists.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“M-Mistress Bellatrix, the Lady Black will not answer,” the elf called out when it caught sight of her, “She refuses to let us in!” Its frail body began shaking with fear at the sight of Bellatrix’s darkened eyes, backing up until it was standing flat to wall. Bellatrix could hardly stand the pitiable sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Out of my way you simpleton,” she pushed it aside as she passed, squaring her stance before banging against the doorframe with a closed fist. “Mother!?” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bang-Bang!</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Mother open this door immediately!” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bang-Bang!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>When no noise reached her ears Bellatrix stood back from the door, her hand clenching and magic crackling off her skin in a shower of red sparks. With a burst of speed she threw her clenched fist at the door, right above the handle, using the dual strength of her magic and momentum to smash the old wood into splinters and dust. Freed from its lock the door swung inward, Bellatrix pushing past it as she entered the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t nearly as large a space as the library on the first floor but it held far more valuable tomes. Each were priceless in their own right, grimoires and binds of banned literature and notes, old and rare beyond belief. Two corridors laid out in green carpeting split off from the entrance to run along the sides while the walls and center aisle were all filled bookcases with nary a spot to spare. Bellatrix strode forward into the space on the right, heading towards where the lanes converged onto a small sitting area with armchairs and desks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she reached the end she stopped in her tracks. She didn’t need magic to understand the sight presented before her. Druella was sitting up in an armchair with a photo album propped precariously upon her lap, blonde hair tied up in a loose bun that draped to the nape of her neck. She was thin and gaunt, her cheekbones harshly poking through the paper thin skin, her eyes closed and visage peaceful in death.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck.” Bellatrix wiped a hand down her face, cursing her luck to the empty air. Deep beneath her skin she could feel a darkness swelling as the last bits of Black magic passed from dead mother to daughter. </span>
</p>
