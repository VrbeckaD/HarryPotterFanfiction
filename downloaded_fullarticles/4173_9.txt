    <p>
  <span>Looking around the great hall with the metallic tang of blood in the air, Harry did his best not to retch at the sight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A macabre painting of scorch marks and mangled bodies. Harry zigzagged back and forth across the rubble strewn throughout the hall. Past death eaters such as the Carrow twins and Yaxley. He walked silently past the various teachers and order members who died alongside students. It was only when he gazed upon the twisted remains of Ron and Hermione with their inner organs on a horrifying display at the broken head table, did he retch. He collapsed feeling cold as ice. There was a ringing in his head and his hands shook but he felt nothing. Not relief that Voldemort was dead nor agony at the death of everyone else. A dripping noise echoed loudly through the hall. A parody of the lively sounds it used to hold. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry was jolted out of his numbness when a hand grabbed his shoulder. In a instant he was on his feet with his glowing wand tip pressed against a pale scruffy throat. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Calm down, prongslet. It’s me, Padfoot” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry slowly lowered his wand “They’re gone Padfoot, they’re all g-gone” he stuttered out. When he fell strong arms caught him and they sank to the floor together. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know, I know” Sirius choked out. Slowly he began to rock his godson back and forth as tears streamed down their faces. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I thought you were gone too”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Never, never pup” Sirius replied forcefully gripping Harry just a little tighter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius? Harry?” a shocked voice called out. They looked up to see a bloody and beaten looking Remus. One of his arms hang limply and his already tattered robes were almost falling off they were so torn. None of this stopped his near sprint towards them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What happened next none of them could predict. A mere few feet away them the remnants of spells best forgotten pooled together on top of the corpse of one Hermione Jean Granger. Well meaning and courageous Hermione who had time traveled more than any other witch or wizard ever had. Not that anybody, even herself knew. The entire time the trio of grieving males sat there the more powerful those ingredients became. You see the combination of freshly spilled magical blood and lingering spell residue caused something small. A tear. Small and purple, violet to be exact. Harry’s blood that had steadily been dripping joined the pool of Hermione’s and it </span>
  <em>
    <span>cracked.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The small tear ripped inself open wider and sucked the trio in with a violent screech.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The rest of the wizarding world came upon the ruins of Hogwarts and they grieved. So many had died. They never did find Harry Potter, The Man Who Conquered. All they knew is that he died and took The Great Dark Lord Voldemort with him.    </span>
