    <p>Jodie waited at the window after breakfast. Any minute now she’d get a reply from Albert. Since he’d moved in with the Taylor family, he’d told her how things are much better, and it’d grown easier to control the obscurus part of him. Just from how he talked about Mrs. Taylor, and the twins Priscilla and Amy, it seemed Alberts troubles were coming to an end. Jodie kept the letters too, since they also included affectionate notes. Ones a thirteen year old would write, like ‘I can’t wait to see you again’ and ‘thinking of you.’ Albert’s summer seemed like a dream.</p><p>As for Jodie, things were a little different.</p><p>Thanks to Gerard bringing them together to eliminate a nest of dementors, the more elite wizards and witches took notice of the Rosier family, which meant more business-related parties. It was nice for Jodie to see her housemates over the summer. In fact, she’d get to see Evony and Jasper at the party that very night. The parties didn’t feel the same like before she started at Hogwarts, she preferred the chaos her mates would get into; usually led by Prescott and Sebastian, and always involving food. Jodie missed the silliness of meeting up for exploding snap, usually resulting in the boys screaming in surprise when cards exploded.</p><p>Jodie finally spotted the owl swooping down, dropping the paper, and a yellow envelope. Jodie handed off the newspaper to her dad and took the letter to her room.</p><p>“Isn’t that just adorable, Kelland?” Mary asked. Jodie’s mother had been eager to let Albert stay when Jodie asked, but ultimately, it was better for Albert to stay with Professor Taylor’s family.</p><p>“I suppose… Mary, look at this,” said Kelland. Jodie closed her bedroom door. More than likely it was something strange in the Daily Prophet. But that was of little concern, not with a letter to be opened. Jodie split the envelope and read the little paper.</p><p> </p><p>“Dear Jodie,</p><p>I know you read this every week, but I’m so excited to see you again! Hogsmeade is wonderful, and the twins look like they might be magic too. Unfortunately not while we’re in school, but you’ll get to meet them when we have Hogsmeade visits. I just finished reading that book you recommended to me. I didn’t think Hale was going to do that! Crazy!</p><p>I wouldn’t know about fancy parties, the closest I’ve been to was the one Selwyn hosted, and that ended in half the school getting drunk. That was pretty funny. I hope the next one’s more fun.</p><p>-Albert.”</p><p> </p><p>Jodie held the letter close to her, and put it in the drawer with the others. The past summer felt longer than the previous one. There was a knock at the door. Mary’s usual cheer was gone, and she clutched the Daily Prophet in her hand.</p><p>“Mum? Did something happen?” Jodie asked. Mary sat next to Jodie and handed Jodie the paper. As Jodie opened to the front page, she understood the grim look on her mothers face.</p><p> </p><p align="center">Nikolai Valentine Escapes Azkaban</p><p align="center">Several Followers Escape in the Chaos</p><p> </p><p>“I know you didn’t want to go to all of the parties, but can you come with us, just to be safe?” Mary asked. Jodie nodded. Mary hugged Jodie tightly. “I’m sorry sweetie.”</p><p>“Mum, it’s fine. I’ll get to see friends, right?” Jodie asked.</p><p>“If they’re at the parties, yes,” said Mary. Jodie nodded. She’d see her housemates, and Jasper whenever he’d help serving.</p><p>Jodie stared down at the paper, Nikolai’s mugshot was on the front page, followed by the shots of the other escapees. He looked like an older version of Sebastian. Same white hair, same brown eyes, same pale skin. The difference was the look in his eyes. If Nikolai’s goal was to unsettle anyone who looked at the mugshot, he succeeded. Jodie closed the paper.</p><p>“I can take it,” said Mary.</p><p>Jodie handed back the paper and pulled out a piece of paper and a pen. She had to ask, get details, anything to check on Sebastian. He only mentioned his uncle had beef with him, but it was enough that Sebastian didn’t chance Albert staying with him. As far as Jodie knew, he lived with the Godfrey’s.</p><p>“What are you doing Jodie?” Mary asked.</p><p>“My friends, I want to see if they’re okay,” said Jodie. She quickly scrawled a letter to Sebastian, since it’d be faster that way. “Do you think we can get some kind of phone that works on Hogwarts grounds?”</p><p>“Jodie, you know electronics don’t work on the grounds,” said Mary. Jodie tapped her pen on her chin. She finished the letter and addressed it. “We’ve tried before, but it’s not the easiest thing to make.”</p><p>“Thanks. Maybe I can send you an artificer once I graduate,” said Jodie. She hurried out of her room to get to the family owl. She let the owl fly. Now that she was thinking, she considered asking Jeremy about what kind of work he was doing for electronics to work on the grounds. She passed Mary talking to Kelland on her way back to her room to pen another letter for when the owl returned.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>It had been a week since news of the breakout, and Jodie hadn’t seen much about it. She and her parents had just got back from a dinner party with the investors of the business Kelland ran selling magical products. Jodie was quick to dress and let her hair down. She glanced at the letter she’d read from Albert that morning, mostly letting her know he was just fine, and they’d be safer at school. Jodie left her room to sit at the window to wait for the family owl to turn in. The sky was clear for once, and since the home was outside of the city, the stars were the lights dotting the sky. Jodie noticed a flapping shape and quickly opened the window. The large owl glided through, dropping a letter and not even stopping. Jodie closed the window again and picked up the letter. She tore it open. It was from Sebastian and Prescott.</p><p>“Jodie, thanks for asking how we’re doing. So many aurors staying guard. It was hard to write this without them breathing on it. Be careful and be safe. Nikolai is a dangerous person, and his followers are no different. Do not hesitate against him. He won’t. I’ll explain more at school. Until then,” Jodie read aloud. She sat down again and sighed.</p><p>“And here I thought this year would be nice,” said Jodie.</p><p> </p><p>--</p><p> </p><p>Evony checked her outfit one more time. Even though she’d gone to parties of the wizarding elite dozens of times, things were changing. For one, Adam officially retired, meaning Jasper ran the household if her father was away. Tonight for example, he organized the food and drink, with extreme care considering previous parties they’d held.</p><p>A knock interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>“Miss Evony?” Jasper asked.</p><p>“Come in,” said Evony. She turned to the door. Jasper waited in the door way.</p><p>“You look great,” said Jasper. “Everyone’s waiting.”</p><p>“Right,” said Evony. “And you said Miss Evony again.”</p><p>Jasper smiled and took Evony’s arm. They walked to the ballroom, where most of the chatter was ongoing. He’d grown a little more confident, even with having to make some workarounds to ensure Jasper didn’t get stressed out. He clearly noticed something was wrong, but he hadn’t asked Evony about it just yet. So Evony hadn’t said anything. Not until she could figure out who wanted to get rid of Jasper.</p><p>Evony stopped short of the door.</p><p>“Evony? You okay?” Jasper asked.</p><p>Evony nodded. Jasper let go and opened the door for her. As Evony walked in she was greeted by the closest wizards and witches. She managed to make her way to her housemates, all well-dressed.</p><p>“Hey, it’s Evony,” said Oliver. Evony was met with a chorus of greetings from her fellow Slytherins, and Donley. Even with his bitter attitude, he’d managed to stay friends with the group. At least he could be civil at parties.</p><p>“We just saw Jasper, how’s he doing with running the house?” Leo asked.</p><p>“He’s alright. I ask him to take errands so he doesn’t overwork himself,” said Evony.</p><p>“Has he, you know,” said Oliver. He indicated Evony’s father.</p><p>“Nope. This oath’s enough,” said Evony. She scanned the crowd of wizards and witches mingling. Jasper was already back to serving drinks.</p><p>“I was hoping this year would be nice for all of us, except,” said Donley. The mood dulled a bit.</p><p>“Jeez, Donley! No need to dampen everything,” said Casper. “Hey look who else is here.” Casper gestured to the door. Since the chaos, and the recent breakout, Jodie had chosen to go to the parties her parents were invited to, and tonight was no exception.</p><p>“Jodie!”</p><p>“Evony, good to see you,” said Jodie. She’d finally stopped utilizing a high ponytail as her choice of hairstyle, but she still pinned back her curled hair. Her dress was nice, but Evony hadn’t expected that it’d show the black webbing of a scar on her shoulder. Jodie noticed Evony and the others looking. “Right. It chafes if I wear any of my old dresses on it.”</p><p>“Ouch,” said Casper.</p><p>“Say, how is Albert doing?” Donley asked. “Actually before you answer that. I’m sorry for last year. I didn’t help him, and I live with him at school.”</p><p>“Um, thanks. You should apologize to him though, not me,” said Jodie. Donley nodded.</p><p>“I’ll do that,” said Donley.</p><p>“There’s our Abbott!” Oliver said and squeezed him. Donley rolled his eyes as Leo, Casper, and Castillo squished him too.</p><p>“Evony, can I talk to you in private?” Alexandra asked.</p><p>“Sure,” said Evony. She followed Alexandra to where people had thinned out a little.</p><p>“Did your father tell you about dating yet?” Alexandra asked.</p><p>“Oh, right,” said Evony. That was the other thing that was changing. Tonight’s party was not only for the elites to get together, but it was meant for those Evony’s age and older to start looking for possible dating prospects. Eventually there would be a debutante ball for Evony and other girls to look into considerations.</p><p>“I know. Godric and Salazar didn’t have to do that,” said Alexandra. “Got anyone in mind yet? Oliver might be a smart match for you.”</p><p>“Maybe. What about you?” Evony asked.</p><p>“I think Donley wouldn’t be too bad. I’d say Henry’s an option, but you saw him last year,” said Alexandra.</p><p>“Do we really have to think about that?” Evony asked.</p><p>“Better to think ahead,” said Alexandra. She left Evony to speak with Godric, who’d just arrived to the party.</p><p>Evony looked at the party guests. Everyone looked happy, chipper, and eager to socialize. Her eyes rested on Jasper, happily chatting with guests while serving them. Even if the prospect was years off, the idea that Jasper might not be by her side left her feeling lonely already. She checked the mark under her sleeve. Still fresh, and still able to protect Jasper.</p>
