    <p class="p1">James Potter remembered.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>He remembered sitting in his dad’s car. Everything was quiet, minus the rain. James was thirteen. He didn’t know Sirius Black, yet. He had more friends than anyone at school but sometimes it felt like he had no friends at all. He thought a lot of them were really jealous of him. Well, before today they were. Maybe not now.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>They were still parked outside the school. The longer his dad was quiet the more nervous James got. His dad was disappointed and that was so much worse than if he was angry. James made a mistake. It wasn’t his first but it might’ve been his worst. He tricked a boy into drinking sour milk. The opportunity had just been too good.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>It wasn’t the first time James had got sour milk at this school. He’d learned to always smell them before drinking. James sniffed it then walked over to where Davey Greenwood was sitting alone with his food. No one liked Davey. He was weird and anti-social. Everyone thought he would grow up to be a serial killer or something like that. James thought for sure Davey wouldn’t take the milk. He was just hoping to insult him and get an opportunity to embarrass him. It didn’t work.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>Davey just said thanks when James offered him the milk. And he just drank it, chugging it back then almost instantly spitting it all back out onto his food. And then he got sick. Two other kids, a boy, and a girl ran over, angry at James. James just laughed. Served Davey right for being such a little creep. The boy got too close to his face and James snapped, hitting him in the jaw. The kid fell to the ground and James was instantly filled with regret. The boy didn’t fight back and teachers we’re suddenly surrounding him. He’d just messed up bad.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“Look, Dad, I know-“</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“James, stop. I know you know. And that’s what makes this so disappointing.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>Ah, there was the sting.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>His dad continued, “I’m going to have to pull you out of this school, James. If I don’t they’ll probably kick you out anyway.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>James nodded silently, avoiding his father’s eyes.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“Do you have anything to say, James?”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“I’m sorry.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“No, don’t be sorry to me. Be sorry to those boys.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“I am.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“Good.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>James knew he’d hear a lot more from his mother later. His dad turned on the engine, the wipers working frantically on the windshield as the rain poured down.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“Am I a bad person?”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>His father stopped and glared at him.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“Of course not. Don’t ever say that.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“But what I did was bad. Why would I do that if I wasn’t a bad person?”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“James, the biggest lie ever told is that the world is divided into good people and bad people. Everyone has shades of grey. A person can do a good deed then turn around and do a bad one.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>James didn’t feel much comfort from that but he continued to listen.</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“Still. The fact that you are worried about being bad shows that you aren’t. It shows that there’s hope. You can turn it around. There are people who don’t care about doing bad. They don’t think twice before stepping on people.”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“Do they ever do good?”</em>
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
    <em>“Yes. Absolutely. Shades of grey, son. No one is all bad.”</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><em>No one is all bad</em>. James Potter had been thinking about his father’s words a lot lately. They’ve always resonated with him. He’s believed his dad was right. But now James turns on the news and he isn’t so sure anymore. There’s a sourness in the air. James watched his infant child sleeping in a crib and wonders what world will be left for them.</p><p class="p1">“Babe,” Lily said, the sound of her bare feet on the hardwood floor of their home approaching him from behind.</p><p class="p1">James turned to her, smiling. She was wearing a big tee-shirt and probably nothing else. He leaned down and gave her a kiss, lifting her head up by the chin.</p><p class="p1">“Mmm. Good morning,” she said, giving him a hug.</p><p class="p1">James rubbed her back firmly, resting his chin on her shoulder.</p><p class="p1">“Good morning,” James replied.</p><p class="p1">“What have you been up to?” Lily asked, pulling away.</p><p class="p1">“Just thinking,” James said, crossing his arms.</p><p class="p1">“The election?” Lily asked, Flitwick the cat scurrying into the room, mewing and circling at Lily’s heels.</p><p class="p1">James scoffed as Lily bent down to pet Flitwick for a moment.</p><p class="p1">“The election, yeah. But it’s so much more than that. It’s honestly not him that scares me. It’s his supporters,” James said.</p><p class="p1">“Me too,” Lily said, letting Flitwick go and walking over to Harley’s crib.</p><p class="p1">“I always knew America was like this,” James said.</p><p class="p1">“Give America a chance to prove you wrong,” Lily said, sounding less sure than her words would indicate.</p><p class="p1">“I don’t have a choice. I don’t know what I’ll do if he fucking wins, though,” James said, sitting on the couch and holding his head.</p><p class="p1">“We’ll survive. Because we have to,” Lily said, coming over to sit down next to him.</p><p class="p1">James sighed.</p><p class="p1">“So, what are you doing today?” he asked.</p><p class="p1">“Today I’m going to start my VLOG. Sunshine with Lily,” she said happily.</p><p class="p1">“Well, it’s a good day for it,” Jame said, gesturing at all the sun beaming into the house.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah. Just need to get the loft all set up and wait for everyone to get out of the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remus will watch Harley while I record.”</p><p class="p1">“I’ve gotta get to work,” James said.</p><p class="p1">Work was good. His video game programming job wasn’t exactly the dream he imagined but it was easy to get lost in it and not have to think about anything real.</p><p class="p1">“All right,” Lily said and gave James a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">Working for Rita Skeeter was a bit like working for the devil, Sirius thought. Based on what Aurora had told him he thought it would be like their hit job on Lucius Malfoy that summer but instead it just felt… dirty. Her targets weren’t all bad people. Some of them were but she was indiscriminate, unafraid of punching down.</p><p class="p1">Sirius would probably just quit if he didn’t think he needed the money. Instead, he was following around the daughter of a Seattle council member, taking photos that Skeeter would warp into whatever she wanted.</p><p class="p1">“This is bad. I’m a bad person,” Sirius said, snapping another picture of her.</p><p class="p1">He was at least waiting for moments when she was doing things that were completely innocuous. That wouldn’t stop Skeeter but he couldn’t bear the idea of making things easy for her. At least this girl was twenty. When he first saw her picture he thought she was underage. He wouldn’t have done it then. Not that her being twenty made him feel any less disgusting.</p><p class="p1">His phone rang. He answered it, putting it to his ear.</p><p class="p1">“How’s it going?” Aurora Sinistra asked.</p><p class="p1">“I feel like Satan,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p1">“Just hang in there. We can get going within a couple of months,” Aurora said.</p><p class="p1">Their current plan was to start a website focused on taking down the powerful and the dangerous in Seattle but Sirius was beginning to have his doubts. Maybe this was the natural result of that type of thing. You start feeling like a hero but slowly become a villain.</p><p class="p1">The council member’s daughter disappeared. It was just as well.</p><p class="p1">“Where are you?” Sirius asked.</p><p class="p1">“Fourth and Pike. Veggie Grill,” Aurora said.</p><p class="p1">Sirius put his camera up and made his way up to Fourth Avenue. He could complain to Aurora in person. He found her seated in a booth, laptop open next to her food.</p><p class="p1">“Hey. Do you want something?” she asked.</p><p class="p1">“A clean soul and maybe some nachos,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p1">“Waitress! Can you get my friend some nachos and a clean soul if you have one?” Aurora called out.</p><p class="p1">“That’s not how you order here,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p1">“I know that! I ordered, didn’t I?” she said, gesturing at her food.</p><p class="p1">“Aurora, I can’t do this. This isn’t me,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p1">“Well, no one is going to make you eat vegan food, Sirius,” Aurora said, sticking a fry in her mouth with a smirk.</p><p class="p1">He gave her a look that hopefully made it clear he wasn’t in the mood for jest.</p><p class="p1">“Sorry. You’re right. I hate it too. I just wrote up an expose trashing some old granny for violating this weird old property law. It’s gross. But the money!” Aurora said.</p><p class="p1">“I don’t care. I can’t do it.”</p><p class="p1">“I’ll let you in on a little secret,” Aurora said, putting more fries in her mouth.</p><p class="p1">“I’m all ears,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p1">“I’m gathering intel on Rita Skeeter. I think she should be our first big hit. If we play this right we can destroy her from the inside,” Aurora said.</p><p class="p1">“I didn’t feel good about the Lucius stuff either but at least he was a terrible person. And I could only do it because I was thinking about my brother. I filmed him having sex with a woman I barely knew so I could stop my brother from going to jail,” Sirius said, thinking it wasn’t getting any less weird, no matter how many times he said it.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, that shit was crazy. I don’t think Rita would make you do anything like that, at least,” Aurora said.</p><p class="p1">“Don’t say that. You’ll give her ideas.”</p><p class="p1">“You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to. I know you still have some money. But I need it. Seattle is hella expensive,” Aurora said.</p><p class="p1">“I know. And, no, I won’t abandon you. Not yet. But at the end of the year I’m out either way,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p1">“All right. End of the year. By then we’ll have our website up and running. Shake on it,” Aurora said, sticking her hand out.</p><p class="p1">Sirius shook it and hoped it would be much sooner than the end of the year.</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">Lily sat crosslegged on the bed, fairy lights strung up on the railing behind her in the loft, phone recording on a tripod. Flitwick was lying on her vanity, faintly purring in the background.</p><p class="p1">“Hello, I’m Lily. Welcome to my VLOG, Sunshine with Lily,” she said, giving her biggest and brightest smile.</p><p class="p1">She was so used to being naked and sexual on camera that it had taken some practice to find the posture and attitude she wanted. To say nothing of her outfit. She really wanted her outfit to sell the hippie vibe she was going for. She ultimately chose a comfy maroon paisley dress and a headband that she thought looked a little silly.</p><p class="p1">“So, who am I? I’m twenty-two. I live in Seattle. I’m polyamorous, pansexual, and very sex-positive,” Lily said.</p><p class="p1">She had decided to leave out her past as a sex worker for now. She knew it would eventually come up but she didn’t want to let that overwhelm things.</p><p class="p1">“I’m all about living life to the fullest, expressing yourself and knowing who you are. I’m Pagan and I’m big on all things new age and magickal. I believe that all life is connected and sacred.”</p><p class="p1">There was something very odd about talking to no one and everyone this way. If no one ever watched her videos it could be substantially embarrassing.</p><p class="p1">“What am I doing with my life? Well, I live in a house with four other people. Some of them my partners and one of them is my child. Being a mother is a really important new part of my life,” Lily said, aware of the irony that Remus was currently sitting with Harley in the carriage house.</p><p class="p1">“I’m also an aspiring actor. I have recently started acting classes and it’s hard work but a lot of fun. Part of this VLOG will be taking you all through my experiences with that. I also want to share my life and help educate people on a variety of subjects, especially polyamory, which I think is very misunderstood.”</p><p class="p1">Lily had notes written up for an entire series of polyamory videos. She hoped enough people would watch the channel to make it worth it.</p><p class="p1">“Well, this has just been a little intro. If you’re interested in my videos make sure to like and subscribe and leave a comment down below. Bye!”</p><p class="p1">Lily held her smile for slightly longer than she thought she needed before pulling herself to her knees and turning off the camera with a sigh of relief. That intro was maybe too short but at least it was straight the point. She had plans for lots of content in the coming weeks, including interviews with all of her housemates and partners.</p><p class="p1">She connected her phone to her laptop and began uploading the video. While she waited for that to finish she went to check on Remus and Harley, Flitwick hopping off the vanity and following her to the backdoor where Lily was forced to shoo him off.</p><p class="p1">“Let me in, it’s the police,” Lily said half-heartedly, knocking on Remus and Sirius’s door.</p><p class="p1">The door opened and Remus had Harley in his arms. The baby was sleeping soundly.</p><p class="p1">“This child loves you, Remus,” Lily said, stepping inside the carriage house.</p><p class="p1">“Are you already done filming?” Remus asked.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah. Uploading the video now. Then I get to edit. Thank God I have a couple of years of experience editing porn,” Lily said.</p><p class="p1">“Thank God you have that outfit. You look like you’re headed to Coachella,” Remus said, taking a sit on the edge of his bed.</p><p class="p1">“Ha ha. Very funny. I would love to go to Coachella, though. You got me there,” Lily said, pointing at him like the meme.</p><p class="p1">“You should go next year,” Remus said.</p><p class="p1">“With who? You sure as hell won’t come,” Lily said, sitting next to Remus.</p><p class="p1">“Sirius, obviously. You two are pretty close now,” Remus said.</p><p class="p1">Sirius was getting pretty into her Pagan group lately. But she still wasn’t sure he’d be up for a festival on that level.</p><p class="p1">“Maybe. I also have the baby to think about. I’m Harley’s mother. I can’t just abandon them all the time,” Lily said.</p><p class="p1">“Lily, you’ve been poly all this time. You’ve always been about sharing. I don’t understand now why you are afraid of doing basic things that normal parents do. People with kids go on business trips or deal with family emergencies all the time. Life doesn’t end because you have a kid,” Remus said.</p><p class="p1">“I know. I just want to be a good mother,” Lily said, reaching over and brushing the fine hairs of Harley’s head.</p><p class="p1">“You already are. You have nothing to prove,” Remus said.</p><p class="p1">“Maybe. It’s not that I mind giving you all a chance to care for Harley. I just don’t want it to be a crutch even if we have this sort of kitchen table polyamory thing going on, “ Lily said.</p><p class="p1">“Kitchen table polyamory?”</p><p class="p1">“It’s a new term people are starting to use to refer to polycules where everyone is comfortable getting together. Some people keep their poly relationships separate.”</p><p class="p1">“Oh. Huh. None of us have really talked much about the poly stuff lately,” Remus said.</p><p class="p1">“No. It’s probably due for an update. But everyone is busy. Including you! That big book release coming up, you scoundrel,” Lily said, playfully tapping his shoulder with a fist.</p><p class="p1">“Lower your expectations. It’s cool but… I don’t know. I’m over it. And the cover is disappointing. Feels more and more like it has nothing to do with me,” Remus said.</p><p class="p1">“And then two months from now you’ll be on Jimmy Kimmel trying to explain why vampires like getting spanked,” Lily said.</p><p class="p1">“God, I hope not. If I became famous I might have to develop an addiction. Alcohol <em>and</em> cocaine just to be safe,” Remus said.</p><p class="p1">“Well, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that then. All right. I’m going to go edit video. You can bring Harley back into the living room if you want.”</p><p class="p1">“I might do that,” Remus said and Lily left with a tiny wave.</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">When James Potter got home he was immediately struck by the sound of strumming guitar strings and a gentle voice.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>How many roads must a man walk down</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Before you call him a man?</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>How many seas must a white dove sail</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Before she sleeps in the sand?</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>How many times must the cannonballs fly</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>Before they're forever banned?</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind</em> </span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> <em>The answer is blowin' in the wind</em> </span>
</p><p class="p4"> </p><p class="p5">Remus was practicing his guitar while Harley slept. James’s heart instantly melted.</p><p class="p5">“You’re getting pretty good,” James said.</p><p class="p5">Lily had gotten Remus the guitar at a garage sale last month because he had always wanted one. It seemed he had quite the skill for it.</p><p class="p5">“Thanks. It’s not that hard of a song, though,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">“What is it?” James asked, sitting down on the couch.</p><p class="p5">“Bob Dylan.”</p><p class="p5">“Ah. I knew it sounded sort of familiar.”</p><p class="p5">“It’s a folk standard,” Remus said, beginning to strum more chords.</p><p class="p5">“I don’t understand how you picked that up so fast,” James said.</p><p class="p5">“YouTube videos. And I’m not perfect. You just can’t tell my mistakes,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">James placed fingers on Remus’s chin, turning him to face him. His lips twitched a smile then they kissed, slow and sweet. They pulled away and James said, “You’re too perfect for mistakes.”</p><p class="p5">“I’m not but thanks for saying it,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">The front door bursts open.</p><p class="p5">“Christ on a sandwich, are you making out with my boyfriend?” Sirius said, throwing his hands into the air.</p><p class="p5">“Yeah, I am. What are you going to do about it?” James said.</p><p class="p5">“I’ll fuck your girlfriend,” Sirius said, crossing his arms defiantly.</p><p class="p5">“She’s sleeping,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">“I’ll fuck her when she’s not sleeping and if she wants to and also not in front of your child,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“How was your day?” Remus asked, breaking up the jest.</p><p class="p5">“Awful and I don’t want to talk about it. The things that Skeeter woman has me doing. Ugh,” Sirius said, slumping back on the couch.</p><p class="p5">“Boys, it sounds like we could all use some cold beverages to help us out,” James said, slapping them both on the backs then getting up to head to the kitchen.</p><p class="p5">“Hey,” Lily’s tired voice down out from the loft while James stepped over the cat on the way to the fridge.</p><p class="p5">“Hey, Lils,” Sirius called back to her.</p><p class="p5">The baby began crying as soon as James made it back with the beers. Lily came down and checked on Harley, quickly deciding to breastfeed.</p><p class="p5">“Everyone is having drinks tonight,” James said, handing out the beers to everyone but Lily.</p><p class="p5">“Not me,” Lily said.</p><p class="p5">“Are you really not going to drink or get stoned while you’re breastfeeding? Like ever?” Sirius asked.</p><p class="p5">“I suppose I could pump to bank breastmilk so that I could drink. Smoking pot is a complete no, though. It apparently stays in your body for far too long. It’s OK. I can give up pot for two more years to ensure my baby is healthy,” Lily said.</p><p class="p5">“You’re an amazing woman, Lily. Have I ever told you that?” James said, feeling so much love for her as she sat in the rocking chair, Harley held up to her breast.</p><p class="p5">“Only every day since you met me,” Lily said, turning to flash him a smile and a flash of her green eyes.</p><p class="p5">“So, did you hear what Trump said today,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“I don’t want to talk about Trump,” James said, almost snapping.</p><p class="p5">Sirius gave James a concerned glance.</p><p class="p5">“Are you all right?” Sirius asked.</p><p class="p5">James sipped his beer, tilting the bottle high.</p><p class="p5">“Yeah. There’s just so much of him. It’s all anyone talks about and he makes me so goddamn mad,” James said.</p><p class="p5">The truth was James did want to talk about Trump. He wanted to scream about him. But he didn’t like how he felt when he was angry. And he knew Lily wanted this to be a positive, warm space.</p><p class="p5">“Well, he scares me,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“His supporters scare me more,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">“Guys, Lily is breastfeeding,” James said, gesturing at her.</p><p class="p5">“It’s fine. I promise the baby has no idea what we are talking about,” Lily said.</p><p class="p5">“I just don’t want him to win,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“He’s <em>not</em> going to win. Let’s just put that to bed right now,” James said.</p><p class="p5">“I mean, he could,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“No, he <em>couldn’t</em>. End of subject. Let’s move on,” James said, downing the rest of his beer in one long gulp.</p><p class="p5">James could almost feel his blood pressure rising.</p><p class="p5">“I’m gonna change the baby’s diaper,” Lily said, getting up and heading over to the changing table, perhaps wanting to be free of the discomfort.</p><p class="p5">James got up to get himself another beer. Maybe another beer would make that boiling sensation at his core go away. He opened it then came back to the couch to sit down next to Sirius.</p><p class="p5">“Well, can we talk about Hillary?” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“Knock yourself out,” James said.</p><p class="p5">“Hey, you were Hillary’s guy!” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“I still am,” James said.</p><p class="p5">“I mean I’m gonna vote for her but I don’t really see the appeal,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“Sirius is a Bernie bro,” Remus said, teasing his boyfriend.</p><p class="p5">“I am not! Fuck those guys. Fuck anyone who is planning not to vote for Hillary out of spite or because they think she’s just as bad as Trump. Gain some fucking perspective,” Sirius complained.</p><p class="p5">“I’m gonna set up a swear jar. Everyone has to put in a quarter every time they say the T-word,” James grumbled.</p><p class="p5">“OK, OK. Enough is enough. I’m throwing down. I’m not gonna deal with another month of this shit,” Sirius said, standing and coming around the coffee table, his hands angrily in front of his face as if grasping for something.</p><p class="p5">James sighed and looked away.</p><p class="p5">“You’ve been a dick about Trump for like the last three fucking weeks, James. I’m sorry, but we can’t <em>not</em> talk about him,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“Haven’t you ever just wanted a safe space? Something nice where you didn’t have to think about how shitty the world is?” James said.</p><p class="p5">“Yes, of course. I also want to be able to come home and tell the people I love that I’m terrified. And I want them to tell me that they’re terrified too because knowing I’m not alone is the only fucking thing that’s getting me through this!” Sirius shouted.</p><p class="p5">“Don’t shout,” Lily called out and headed down the hall with the baby, probably to take Harley out to the carriage house.</p><p class="p5">“Well, I’m not terrified. I’m not. Sorry, Sirius. I’m mad. And every time I hear his fucking name or something he’s said I just get madder. And I don’t want to be mad because I can’t fucking <em>do</em> anything about it,” James said, getting to his feet.</p><p class="p5">“Yes, you can. You can get involved. There are tons of things you can do,” Sirius said.</p><p class="p5">“None of that shit is good enough. And it doesn’t matter because he’s not going to win!” James shouted.</p><p class="p5">“But he can! He fucking can!”</p><p class="p5">“No! He! Can’t!”</p><p class="p5">James got right in Sirius’s face. Sirius lifted his chin in defiance. He’s never backed down from James and James doesn’t expect he will now either.</p><p class="p5">“He can,” Sirius said calmly.</p><p class="p5">James huffed and said, “Fuck this.”</p><p class="p5">He set his beer down and walked to the door, grabbing his coat and heading out into the night. As soon as he got to the end of the driveway he heard the front door open, the sounds of running footsteps following behind him.</p><p class="p5">“Go away, Sirius,” James said.</p><p class="p5">“I’m not Sirius,” Remus said, appearing next to James, who was headed down to boardwalk by the beach, finding that if nothing else could calm him, the water would.</p><p class="p5">“Remus. Sorry,” James mumbled.</p><p class="p5">“It’s OK,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">“You’re not here to lecture me about Trump, are you?” James said.</p><p class="p5">“No. I guess I can see it both ways. I do get tired of hearing about him but I think it’s also good to know other people are feeling what I’m feeling,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">James sighed.</p><p class="p5">“The truth is that I’m weak and you’re all strong,” James said.</p><p class="p5">“That’s bullshit.”</p><p class="p5">“Hmm, maybe. But it’s how I feel. I feel like I’m going to fucking snap. I’m so afraid of letting go. I’ve never been this angry. It’s not who I want to be,” James said, hot tears falling down his cheeks.</p><p class="p5">“It’s OK to let go. You should feel your feelings. There’s nothing wrong with being angry,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">“I know. And there’s so much to be angry about. Jesus, Remus. Do you know how much bullshit I’ve put up with my entire life?” James said.</p><p class="p5">“I can only imagine. It was bad enough being a shy Korean kid,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">“So much shit that I just taught myself to grin and bear it. I don’t know where I got that. It wasn’t my parents. My mom never would’ve put up with half the shit I have. But I just always wanted to exist. Be seen as a man, not a black man. But that was stupid. Why the fuck shouldn’t I be who I am?” James said.</p><p class="p5">Remus didn’t reply.</p><p class="p5">“But that’s not really the point. The point is I’ve always tried to bury my anger. But now I feel like I can’t,” James said.</p><p class="p5">“Then maybe you shouldn’t,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">“If I can just get through this election. Trump will be gone and everything can go back to normal,” James said.</p><p class="p5">“But what if he’s not gone and please don’t yell at me,” Remus said, his words coming out almost too fast.</p><p class="p5">James gulped and said, “Then I don’t know what I’m going to do.”</p><p class="p5">“Me either. But at least we’ll have each other,” Remus said.</p><p class="p5">James cracked a smile, surprising himself.</p><p class="p5">“At least,” he admitted and they carried on.</p><p class="p5">Shortly they arrived at the boardwalk. Remus didn’t say anything else. They just stood there in silence. James closed his eyes, listening to the water and the wind, feeling the cool breeze pass over him. This was something he had learned from Lily. In that instant, it felt like everything would be all right and it was the first time he hadn’t thought about Trump all day.</p><p class="p6"> </p><p class="p6"> </p>
