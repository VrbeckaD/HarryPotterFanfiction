    <p>Lily Potter lay asleep atop her husband at 11:55pm on August 30th, as still as death under their blanket. Her breath hitching slightly, atop James's cold embrace with every subtle stroak of his finger across her face. </p><p>He breathes out a soft sigh 'damn she is beautiful in this moonlight, bursting full with our son, it should be any day now according to Poppy, I hope my cursed nature hasn't been past on to him but we will see as she was unfamiliar with the spell to test creature blood before birth, if it wasn't for our creature blood we could of used a licensed St Mongos healer though I'm glad we are able to put our trust in Poppy as she is the only person we can trust if Harry has our burden'.</p><p>He inhaled her scent briefly for a minute before turning sharply to shake her awake "Lily my sweet I believe the baby is coming!", she began to moan slightly in her sleep and then shot bolt up right screaming, she was going into labour, the blood pooled between her legs rapidly as she started to shake violently, fighting off the waves of painful contractions.</p><p>James jumped out of bed and quickly put a robe on before running to the floo room leaving her agonized cries in his wake, he grabbed a princh of floo powder and threw it into the flames "Headmasters Office, Hogwarts" he growled.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore was in the midst of finishing the last of his ministry paperwork and penning a note to Peter Pettigrew, feeling slightly tired however he was about to get up from his desk and turn in for the night, when a flash of the floo alerted him to something potentially grave, he quickly banished his piles of work for later use and steeped his fingers, focusing on the floo grate, all drowsiness evaporated when James appeared in his grate wearing a deep scowl 'has he figured my plans out already?' Dumbledore thought in irritation though proceeded to wear an indulgent grand-fatherly smile "James my boy! What can I do for you and Lily at this late hour?".</p><p>"Albus! Get Poppy over here now Lily is going into labour, it looks like she needs immediate care or she will suffer more than blood loss at this rate I think he is carrying our condition! Hurry!".</p><p>"I will inform her as soon as the floo is shut and I will also take the liberty of informing Severus, that we are in need of some blood replenishment potions, this is grave news if he has contracted the conditions, however I am confident Lily and her son will both live, we will be coming through the floo from the hospital wing shortly, please allow admittance your end and we will meet you in your bedroom within the next half hour, don't worry James the contractions will last a while yet just make sure she is rested and give her some blood replenishment potion before we arrive if you have it on hand, do not give her numbing agents that will effect the pregnancy!".</p><p>James nodded once though snarled at the mention of Snivullus being anywhere near his wife, and left as soon as he came, Dumbledore stood up from his desk, rubbed his temples muttering "The Chosen One isn't human? This could prove disastrous in the years to come but at least they are protected by the fidelius, well until Peter delivers the dark lord my little gift, I do hope Harry destroys him quickly when it happens.." he smirked darkly to himself as he moved towards the perch and tapped his pheonix lightly.</p><p>"Fawkes my friend you know what to do, rouse and alert Severus to come to the hospital wing I will write a note requesting the potions we need" he wrote a quick note, handed it to Fawkes and in a flash of flame Fawkes was gone leaving Dumbledore to walk towards the Hospital Wing and find Poppy.</p><p>Severus was still awake in his private quarters despite the late hour, making notes in his potions journal as he sipped his muled wine, occasionally muttering to himself about the incompetence of his students when the flash of flame interrupted his musings and drew his attention to Fawkes' sudden appearance in his study along with a note clutched in his talons.</p><p>'This is not going to be good, after the Dark Lord sent me to teach brats it has been one thing after another with this old goat, however he has protected Lily while the Dark Lord hunts her so I have to see this through' he thought dispassionately "What is it Fawkes?, I am busy if it is not urgent tell Albus I will answer him tomorrow" he sneered as the note dropped on to his desk. </p><p>After snatching it up to examine the rude request he gasped and rushed to his store room to find the appropriate potions, 'Lily is going to have an heir to the vile Potter line? if it has contracted that bastards' vampirism, I will butcher him for potions ingredients regardless of if I get sent to Azkaban for the deed, no child of her's should have to deal with the scrutiny despite it being a Potter' "I will be there momentarily Fawkes go back to the office if you must".</p><p>He made his way along the corridors to the hospital wing as swiftly as he could, knowing time was of the essence if their son had vampirism and destroyed her womb in his escape, causing her to bleed out in minutes, without a restorative she would not be saved and he couldn't allow a vampire brat to take her regardless of it not being asked to be born. </p><p>He knocked briskly on Poppy's office door knowing Albus was there already, the door opened quickly as he turned to face the occupants of a furious Poppy Pomfrey at her desk and the twinkling eyes of the headmaster in her patient chair.</p><p>"Serverus, did you bring the restorative potions? We have to go there now or she and that baby won't make it, if it is as we have been led to believe and is inhuman, regardless of his mothers genealogy also having dormant creature blood, she is still too human to give birth to something with vampirism, Albus tells me James has opened the floo connection to my grate so we must be swift" Poppy spoke in clinical irritation, Snape just sneered at her "Do you think me incompetent woman? Yes I brought it all as requested, she is dear to me".</p><p>Albus smiled "Come now Severus my boy there is no need for this, I have absolute faith in you and I also have faith in Poppy to oversee this strenuous pregnancy regardless of this minor complication", "Minor complication!?" Severus and Poppy shouted at him, who just waved it off as he threw the floo powder into the flames "Godricks Hollow, Potter Estate" Albus stated calmly and stepped into the flames before spinning off, leaving them to stare in disbelief at him before following suit.</p><p>As all floo occupants stumbled into the floo room, cries of Lily's agony could be heard down the hall, they took a brief glimpse of the floo room before a house elf greeted and introduced itself "Misters and Misses I am Paddy! My mistress needs you hurry! Poor master Harry is stuck!" It wailed and squeaked before it took their cloaks and popped away.</p><p>They ran into the master bedroom, Lily was deathly pale despite her tan laying on the bed, writhing and shivering in a pool of her own blood, if it wasn't for James and the blood replenishment, she would be dead already, Poppy surveyed the scene clinically.</p><p>'it seemed her uterus has burst internally as her son has tried to get out through the contractions', she thought as she rushed to Lily's side and tipped her chin back to swallow a vial handed to her by Severus, he then proceeded to point his wand at her legs and chant "Volmera Sumento" with each inflection the blood slowly flowed back into her body and sealed the vaginal wound.</p><p>Lily screamed even louder at this, the pain of the counter curse fixing the damage as fast as the contractions came was too much to bare, she feared her son will be still born and her dead if something didn't give soon, James just stood there watching in despair or at least as much as a natural vampire could show his human counterpart. </p><p>"Poppy start a C section it is the only way to save them both! Albus focus on spelling the blood from expelling, I will keep healing the current uterus damage and making the clean incision until the little fiend is out of her!" Severus shouted, James glared venemously at this but couldn't stop him or they would both die, all three quickly got to work.</p><p>Severus made a soft incision with a wordless Sectumsempra and Albus spelled it bloodless so Poppy could reach in and grab the baby out of uterus sack, she popped the sack quickly to grab hold of the baby when an inhuman shriek reached their ears and a powerful magical backlash rose through the room throwing the occupants into the wall with loud thuds, James was the first to recover and pick the baby out of her before sealing the wound and carrying his screaming son to his mother softly groaning on the bed.</p><p>Severus stumbled to his feet, clutching his head for a minute as did the others before pointing his wand at the child and whispering a light cleaning spell to wash the blood off the still screaming infant, on closer inspection they could make out Harry had small protruding black wings and a deathly pale complexion, confirming his vampiric inheritance however his small ears seem to carry and elven trait to them rather than pure vampire, Severus berated himself he should have known this boy would inherit both dominant genes of the two.. he was a Dhampire which although is miraculous and rare in magical breeding due to the Fae and Vampire covens not getting along, it will spark controversy regardless of his social standing, 'this will be bad' he thought.</p><p>Poppy ran some diagnostic spells on both the mother and child before reporting her findings "Lily you recieved extensive damage to your internals due to the nature of this birth however our quick action will only leave you more sore than average for a few weeks, I recommended plenty of rest and to take replenishment potions daily for up to next seven days as well as nutrient potions until the effects wear off as well as a pain relief potion immediately, if you experience any flu symptoms please floo me, as for the boy he is healthy and as we can see he has contracted your husbands' vampirism however he is in fact a Dhampire! a hybrid of Dark Elf and Vampire, he can eat normal foods as well as drink blood and he seems to be magically very powerful, now that he has calmed I can tell he also has hetrocromia an eye condition leading to multiple melanin distribution in the eyes causing multiple colours of the irises so far it is green and blue with a hint of red, we will have to monitor him closely for a few days, I do not recommend feeding him milk on first feed however as he needs blood to regrow his energy, I will contact saint mongos for a list of donors and we can get him blood packs tomorrow, tonight however he is best feeding from his father in order not to spread his vampirism" she looked sharply at James at this, who smiled meekly and nodded given he was caught doing that years ago in Hogwarts and the cycle may continue in this case.</p><p>Snape snorted in vague disgust at getting the reference though he was awed at the little fiend now snuggly in Lily's arms too enraptured to notice James's eyes narrow at the reaction 'this little brat will be the dark lords downfall all right, if he could throw even the old goat to the ground at infancy he will be a force to be reckon with in his majority, however this represents plenty of social complications although if he is truly a Dhampire the dark lord won't be able to kill him traditionally this could prove interesting if not for the dangers this presents to Lily herself' he glanced at Albus holding his twinkling stare and lowering his occlumency barriers slightly to give his unworded opinion to him, Albus just smiled and nodded before addressing the occupants of his congratulations and taking his leave.</p><p>James grew suspicious of those empty platitudes despite them thinking he was naive and blindly loyal, Dumbledore was being shifty as of late and he hoped he would leave soon this was his home and he was feeling very protective of his heir and wife right now, it seemed his tensing got his message across to Snape and Poppy as well as they left not soon after Dumbledore.</p><p>He couldn't allow the old man to play tricks with his family even if it was for the greater good, he wished nothing more than to rely on him as less as he could though it was still more or less their life in his hands being the only one strong enough to cast their estate into fidelius, he was starting to doubt even Peter was the correct choice if it weren't for Sirius's askance to change he wouldn't have.</p><p>"Peter has always been the weakest of us" he muttered lost in his agonized and protective thoughts only to be brought to the attention of Harry wriggling up his mothers arms, who seemed to strain with fighting back his strength after his birthing weakening her.</p><p>"Ah you little bugger, you already want feeding hmm? You can't have mommy, she's off limits because you can't yet control either thirst or your ability to pass on your condition, so come 'ere you!" He laughed and lunged at the wriggling little one tickling and picking him up, to which little Harry just giggled slightly and Lily smiled tiredly before falling back to sleep.</p><p>"You've knackered her out you know?" He sighed and bopped Harry on the nose with his finger gently for it, eliciting another soft giggle before taking his nail to his upper chest, making him bleed gently for Harry to latch on and have his first feed contently.</p><p>"It seems you will have your life cut out for you after all if you are following in my foot steps son but be aware you will one day have to fight for your privileges of simplicity".</p><p>James looked down at him and as their eyes meet, he could of sworn they repeatedly changed colours 'is my kid a metermorphamagus at well? Damn Tonks will have a run for her money if that is the case, what doesn't my boy have skill in? It already seems endless potential' he mused as he gently laid back down with them both under the covers and listen to both of them sleep with his little Harry in his arms.</p>
