    <p>The chime of the floo caused Harry to wake with a start. His first thought was “<em>When did I fall asleep? </em>” He’d meant to stay up all night, if he had to, to greet Draco when he got back. His next thought was that it was probably Draco trying to floo call the apartment. Harry pitched forward and tumbled off the couch, scrambling around furniture to get to the fireplace as fast as his sleep-heavy limbs could manage.</p>
<p>“Hello?” he asked as soon as he made the connection. But it wasn’t Draco’s face that appeared in the flames. It was some lady Harry didn’t recognize.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon Mr. Malfoy-Potter. I’m calling from Saint Mungo’s Hospital for the Treatment of Magical Mishaps and Maladies. You are listed as the emergency contact for a Mr. Draco Malfoy-Potter. Can you please tell me his date of birth, in order to validate your identity?”</p>
<p>Harry felt like his world had just <em>s h a t t e r e d </em>.</p>
<p>“I--it’s oh five, oh six, nineteen eighty,” he stuttered. The words seemed to come out of him on autopilot. His own voice sounded like it was coming from the other side of a tunnel.</p>
<p>“Very well. Mr. Malfoy-Potter was submitted for an emergency operation at oh six hundred this morning. The mediwitch presiding over the operation has just announced that he is stable, and released the specifics of his condition for review. If you would like to come to the eighth wing of the hospital within the next hour, a mediwizard will come to discuss with you the continuation of Mr. Malfoy-Potter’s care.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I’ll be there right away.” The floo call was ended from the other side. Harry continued to kneel in the center of the living room. Behind him was the couch where they had done so much living--cuddling, fucking, sleeping, eating, talking, paperwork, socializing with friends--in front of it on the table was the untouched take-out. There was still a record in the player. Harry’s novel sat uselessly beside the food.</p>
<p>Everything was useless, none of this could help Draco. Merlin--</p>
<p>How was he still upright? How was the apartment still in perfect order? How was the world not tilting and spinning and unsteady at this news? How was everything still the same?</p>
<p>Draco was now stable. <em> Which meant he hadn’t been </em>.</p>
<p>Still not sure how he was making his body work--feeling like he was still kneeling at the fireplace, but no, he was walking toward the bedroom--Harry changed clothes as fast as possible and scribbled a note to Ron. He tied the note onto his owl’s leg and sent her off. Ron would gather all of their friends, get the word out.</p>
<p>Harry flooed to the main lobby of Saint Mungo’s and then broke into a run toward the eighth wing.</p>
<hr/>
<p> It was a mix of diluted curses.</p>
<p>They all told Harry that Draco had performed beyond admirably. That there were few cursebreakers in history who could’ve survived the situation he was placed in.</p>
<p>
  <em> The goblins had prepared a set up of curses that should have been impossible to survive. </em>
</p>
<p>Fatal curses, binding curses, subtle curses to hit your back, secondary weaves to spring on you once you’d frantically untangled the web holding you in another curse’s line of fire, curses to turn you to stone, to ash, to drain the blood from you, to turn your bones to sap, to paralyze your muscles, a thousand different curses to attack the nervous system in a thousand different ways.</p>
<p>It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t a challenge. It wasn’t created to test someone’s skills.</p>
<p>It was a room set up to kill whoever walked in.</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t sure when he’d begun weeping. He couldn’t remember if it was while the mediwizard listed Draco’s injuries, or if he had held it together until the man had left.</p>
<p>At some point, Harry ended up crying on Ron’s shoulder while Luna held his hand and Hermione sat with Neville pouring over Draco’s charts.</p>
<p>About the time Harry was getting ahold of himself again, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley arrived with George, and Lee, and Percy, and Ginny, and soon after Blaise and Pansy and Greg and Theo appeared. Pansy and Harry started crying, and Ron was quietly updating the new arrivals, and Theo joined the huddle in the corner.</p>
<p>Dean and Seamus arrived some time later, and both Patil twins dropped by on their own time, and McLaggen stopped in before heading up to start his shift in wing eleven. Mrs. Weasley left and came back with food for them all. Fleur and Bill and Charlie had heard and found an international portkey and Draco still wasn’t ready to receive visitors.</p>
<p>After hours--far too many  h o u r s --the waiting room was silent. Half its occupants were asleep. No one was leaving, no one would leave while Harry was still clinging to whoever came close and staring out at the walls as if he expected them to suddenly crack and splinter.</p>
<p>For Harry, the longer he waited without being able to see Draco, the more it felt like he wouldn’t be there lying on a bed if Harry walked through those doors. It felt like Draco had disappeared, was gone, that there wouldn’t be a body and there wouldn’t be closure and Harry would look and look but he would always be split apart, feeling both like Draco should be sitting at home reading while also feeling like he had disapparated and never reached a destination.</p>
<p>(<em>feeling like Draco had fallen through a veil and never came out the other side</em>)</p>
<p>When the mediwizard reappeared to tell Harry that he and the backup emergency contact--Gregory--could go in the room now, Harry was s h a k i n g .</p>
<p>Greg held the door for him, eyed him as if he was just as worried about <em> Harry </em> as he was Draco. Greg walked in behind him as Harry took halting steps toward the bed and</p>
<p>
  <em> t h e r e  w a s  a  c u r t a i n  b l o c k i n g  t h e  b e d  f r o m  v i e w. </em>
</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know if he was about to faint or scream. There were tears running down his face, his heart was pounding out of his chest, and he felt as if all the happiness he’d ever felt was gone.</p>
<p>While he stood there in frozen terror, Greg edged around him and pulled the curtains away, clearing the view of the bed.</p>
<p>Instead of a scream what came out was a sob.</p>
<p>Faster than he had that morning when going for the floo, Harry scrambled forward until he was gripping the edge of the bed like a lifeline.</p>
<p>D r a c o  w a s  s t i l l  t h e r e. His chest was visibly rising, there was color to his cheeks, his hair was sweaty and matted to his head.</p>
<p>“Draco,” he choked. “Draco, my love.”</p>
<p>Greg put his hand on Harry’s shoulder, and from the way his hand shook, Greg wasn’t particularly okay either.</p>
<p>That was good. The world wasn’t okay. The world wasn’t continuing to spin on as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>A mediwitch appeared and offered Harry a chair. He could barely understand the words coming out of her mouth, couldn’t follow the hushed conversation she had with Greg, but he heard her say that he could hold Draco’s hand, that they could touch him, and that he should wake up in a couple hours.</p>
<p>Harry pulled his hands off of the bed and grabbed Draco’s limp hand, holding it as tightly as he could.</p>
<p>If he held on tightly enough, Draco would stay here</p>
<p>If he held on tightly enough, Draco would be fine.</p>
<p>If he held on tightly enough, Draco wouldn’t disappear.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When Harry woke up, he was alone in the room with Draco. Someone had pulled the curtains back closed, but that was okay. He didn’t mind the curtain as long as he was on the same side as Draco.</p>
<p>He was more in the bed with Draco than out of it. His death grip on Draco’s hand hadn’t loosened, but his entire body was now curled around it too.</p>
<p>His eyes closed. They felt swollen. His throat felt sore. He felt light-headed. His body felt like lead. He probably looked like shit.</p>
<p>“You look like shit, love."</p>
<p>The crack his neck made as it snapped up was louder than Draco’s voice had been, but…</p>
<p>“<em>Draco </em>.” Harry didn’t know if he should lurch forward and hold him as close as physically possible, or if he should climb out of the bed and back into the chair, so he ended up hovering uncertainly.</p>
<p>There was so much love and relief in Draco’s eyes that it hit Harry like a punch to the gut.</p>
<p>“I realized what they’d done as soon as I walked into the room.” They continued to stare into each other’s eyes. “My first thought was that I would never walk back out.”</p>
<p>Harry made a choking sound, but he didn’t break eye contact.</p>
<p>“But then, immediately after, I saw you, buttoning up my shirt this morning. And I knew that I <em> was </em> going to walk out of that room. I was going to walk out, and I was going to find you, and tell you that I love you <em> so damn much </em> that I--that I <em> had to </em>. I had to walk back out.”</p>
<p>He knew what to do now. Harry shot forward and hugged the man he loved, his partner in life. Draco’s arms were pinned between them, and it was terribly uncomfortable, but Draco began crying and that brought Harry to tears and they both pressed their foreheads together and cried.</p>
<p>
  <em> Together. </em>
</p>
<p>They were together, and that was all that mattered right now.</p>
