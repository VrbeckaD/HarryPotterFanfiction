    <p>This, you were quite certain, was the worst headache you had ever had.</p>
<p>You didn’t open your eyes but you could smell something harsh and unnatural, like a chemical used for cleaning. Whatever it was, it was overpowering and faintly lemony. There were faint noises coming from your right, but they were muffled and you guessed you must be in a room. Wincing, you began to slowly open your eyes and raise your head.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em>, your head hurt so terribly.</p>
<p>
  <em>Why?</em>
</p>
<p>The room around you was quite small, but there were no other beds. Cream colored curtains adorned the window so that the sun was mostly blocked from shining inside, and all of the sheets and blankets on the bed were so white they made you flinch. Eyes watering now from the pain in your head, they flicked down the bed and you recognized where you must be almost immediately.</p>
<p>You were in a hospital.</p>
<p>Letting out a soft cry of pain, you closed your eyes and fell back on the pillow again. Why were you in the hospital? What had happened to your head, to the rest of your aching body?</p>
<p>
  <em>Who are you?</em>
</p>
<p>Your head did another particularly nasty throb when you tried to remember the answer. But you couldn’t. You had no idea what the answer was.  But instead of feeling afraid, you mostly just felt dazed. And you wanted the pain in your head to go away, because your stomach was twirling in an unsettling manner.</p>
<p>As if on cue, you heard the door to the room click open. For a moment, the muffled noises of people in the corridor outside swelled to a greater volume, and then subsided as the door closed once more.</p>
<p>You opened your eyes.</p>
<p>Hovering now over your bedside stood a man, a very pale and tall man with white-blonde hair and a pair of white robes to match. His features were rather pointed but he was still on the handsome side; however, his face was not currently arranged into an expression which one could call friendly. It seemed resigned, almost, the way that his eyes – which you noticed were a lovely shade of gray – swept over you. And then you saw his expression twist when he noticed the way your eyes were barely open and watering, the way you cringed in pain from your head and your body.</p>
<p>“Please,” you whispered. “My head-”</p>
<p>It took the man about twenty seconds to wave his wand, summon a syringe, and inject it into your arm. At least, you’re quite sure that’s what he did. Either way, you were happy you didn’t have to drink it, because you weren’t sure you could have. Most of your vision was black at the moment because it hurt to open your eyes wider than a squint.</p>
<p>“For the pain,” he explained quietly. “Can you tell me exactly what’s hurting you?”</p>
<p>“Everything,” you whispered out. “Mostly my head.”</p>
<p>Already, however, the potion he had given you was having an effect. Slowly, you could start to open your eyes as you began feeling better, even though the strange haze that you had felt persisted. His face swam slowly into view as the pain subsided, too, and it was unreadable as he stared down at you. “How did I get here?” you mumbled. “Where am I?”</p>
<p>“You fell,” he said, his tone neutral almost to the point of indifference. “Quite a distance too, I might add. You were banged up pretty badly, and it’ll take a while for your body to gain full recovery -”</p>
<p>“Fell? Fell how?”</p>
<p>There was a very brief pause as his eyes swept over your face. “I do not know.”</p>
<p>“But-”</p>
<p>“You were found,” he continued, his voice rising over your protests, “on the street outside a building of flats, having fallen through glass and from a first floor window. As I said, that means significant damage to-”</p>
<p>“How would I have fallen out a window?” you demanded. The man shifted out of focus and then back in again and you felt suddenly very dizzy.</p>
<p>“Like I said,” he repeated softly, though you could hear an edge of impatience. You swung your eyes up to meet his, but he was now mulling over a piece of paperwork on a clipboard. “I don’t know. That’s something to discuss with the authorities once you’re feeling better. Not me.” He glanced up at you, tapping his pen on the paper. “Now, I need to fill out your patient file, Ms…?”</p>
<p>You just stared at him blankly. He sighed, and then said, with definite impatience now, “I need your name. For the patient file.”</p>
<p>The world swayed again, ever so slightly, but enough to make you a little nauseous all over again. “I don’t know,” you said weakly.</p>
<p>He blinked at you once. Twice. “You don’t know your name?”</p>
<p>You just shook your head quietly, biting your lip. The man came closer to you and waved his wand. You weren’t sure what he was doing, because you saw nothing happen physically – you only felt warm for a moment. But he seemed to have a reason for it, because he was scanning you intently. Finally, he pulled up a chair to the side of your bed. He didn’t bother to stop it from scraping across the tiled floor. “Is there anything you <em>do</em> know?”</p>
<p>“I’m magic,” you said almost immediately. How you knew, you weren’t sure. But you had known what he was doing with the wand and you had known it was, in fact, a wand in the first place, and you had known that it was potion he had been giving you; so you supposed that part of you, at least, hadn’t been erased. It had stayed naturally intact.</p>
<p>“That’s a good sign,” he mumbled, but he wasn’t really talking to you. He was scrawling something out on his clipboard again. It took so long that you began to itch with impatience.</p>
<p>“Will you at least tell me if I’ll ever remember again?” you snapped.</p>
<p>“It seems likely,” he said, glancing up at you before making notes again. But you thought you saw a very faint smile that indicated he was amused with your new, irritated tone.</p>
<p>Git. </p>
<p>He continued quietly, still barely looking at you, “You have suffered a blow to the head from your fall, but it’s not as bad as it could have been. You were very lucky. Usually with things like this, your memory will slowly return on its own. It’s important you don’t take on too much at once and we make it a more gradual process. Or that headache will start to look tame.” You winced, and his voice softened, his gaze flicking over you once, briefly. “So until you reach a better point, you’ll be under my care.”</p>
<p>“Bloody brilliant,” you muttered darkly.</p>
<p>That made him look up. “Is this a problem?”</p>
<p>“Your bedside manner could use some work,” you reply gruffly, pushing out your lip into a pout.</p>
<p>His lips pulled into a slight frown and his eyes burned into yours again. “By all means, request a Healer that will sugarcoat things for you,” he said roughly.</p>
<p>You recoiled as if you had been slapped, but quickly regained your fire. “What am I supposed to do then, lay here all day with no answers?”</p>
<p>“Until tomorrow, yes,” he answered curtly, raising an eyebrow at you. “You’ll sleep again after I give you this potion, here -” he gestured to another needle on the pristine counter top across the room - “- and tomorrow morning, St. Mungo’s will get the needed details from the authorities that have been checking into your accident. Tomorrow we’ll be able to tell you your name, age, and job, probably. We’ll introduce you to the small details that we know over a few days and after that, well…it’s mostly up to you.”</p>
<p>“Brilliant,” you repeated, with less hostility this time. Your head lurched violently again. Maybe sleep didn’t sound so bad, after all. “Who’re you, then?” Your words came out sounding halted and strange.</p>
<p>He seemed to have read your mind, for he walked over to the counter to take the potion and walked back over to your side. “My name is Draco Malfoy, and I’ll be your Healer,” he said, putting it into your arm with an expert swiftness. Almost immediately, your vision started getting fuzzy and you were finding it difficult to focus. You could just barely make out his hair, shockingly bright against the backdrop of a white ceiling.</p>
<p>Momentarily, your vision flooded with black dots, and then he was leaning over you again. Briefly, before you had to close yours, you saw his eyes extremely clearly - how they were gray, swirling storms hovering over you.</p>
<p><em>Malfoy</em>.</p>
<p>Something tickled your brain, but then the exhaustion took over and everything went completely dark.</p>
<p>“Sleep well,” he whispered.</p>
