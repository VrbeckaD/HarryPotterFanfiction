</p><p> </p><p>Hermione Jean Potter knew she should not be staring at Draco Malfoy. It was wrong; he was not the man she married a few short years ago. He worked with her husband, though the truth was, her husband showed very little interest in her nowadays. Harry was far too interested in Severus Snape, his ”right-hand man,” as he was called, to give her the time of day.</p><p> </p><p>Draco cast a spell in Ronald Weasley’s direction, which the other man dodged effortlessly before one was fired back at him. It also missed its mark completely. Malfoy laughed and then fired off another. They traded volleys back and forth, neither truly trying to hit the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Severus sat down beside her in the grass. His long hair was loosely braided back and his robes were nicer than usual. Visiting with Harry then, she thought. She didn't blame Severus; she was not foolish enough to believe that it was his idea to sleep with her husband. Why would anyone reject the advances of a man in such a high place of power? Harry Potter was functionally a king, though the correct term was commander.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Severus’s mother had been a pureblood witch from a similar class as most of the men and women in this courtyard. His father, like her own parents, had been a Muggle. Severus had been taken to Hogwarts at the age of nine. He was to have been a servant, but his sharp mind, skills with potions, charms, spells and spell creation had led him to a chance to become a knight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He waved his hand in front of her face. ”Mrs. Potter, I have asked you three times, what do you think the point of them trying not to hit each other is?”</p><p> </p><p>She shook her head. “The point is to come up with a spell that should be used to counter the other’s hex. It's a game they play regularly. If you don't do that when you practice, Severus, what do you do?”</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>
</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at her. “I tend to simply use a shield to defend myself, Mrs. Potter.” As if there was no other way to practice in his mind. As if it wasn't practicing if you were not trying to maim the other person.</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>
</p><p>She sighed loudly laid back in the grass. Severus was just, well, Severus. Nothing was ever going to change him. Maybe that was the reason her husband was so fond of him. Or maybe it was the fact they had grown up together. When he had been very young, before Hogwarts, he had been brought to the castle to serve the Potters. Muggleborns and children like Severus were usually taken from their families between five years old and eleven. Sometimes younger, though never older. Wizards felt Muggleborn children then got too attached to their families. She called bullshit. At any age, a child was attached to their parents. Unless that is you were abused and neglected as Severus had been. She knew a little about his background, and that made her not interested in learning anymore. His father had tried to ”beat the magic” out of him. Severus’s father, and those like him, were why they were at war with those who believed the Muggles were good and should be allowed to know about magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When he was seized by those of this court, Severus thanked them, as did his mother. Severus was functionally a ”playmate” servant for Harry. He was allowed to be like any other nine-year-old, though his ”job” was to entertain young Harry. They had become close friends during that time period. Harry’s father James had not liked it, but his mother Lily had been pleased about it. She also liked that Hermione and Severus had been born into the Muggle world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Now Severus was a knight, no different than Draco, Ron, Bill, or Sirius. But Severus also knew, as she did, their standings as Muggleborn people meant they had a shorter distance to fall from grace. So while she was not pleased with the idea of him sleeping with her husband, she understood why he did so. Severus liked his life as a knight and he didn't want to lose it, even if it meant being the third person in her marriage. Just as she would not seek to end her marriage on the grounds of cheating. It would result in her being kicked into the town, struggling to make a life for herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>
</p><p>That was also why she could never act on her feelings for one Draco Malfoy, much as she longed to do so. No matter how much it pained her to never act on the love that had bloomed for him since they were just children, back when she had lived in the cottage the Malfoys had raised them in. Back when she was just another Muggleborn, destined to marry a knight if she was lucky or become a shop keeper if she was not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>
</p><p>Sometimes Hermione wished she never would have caught the eye of James Potter when he sought to arrange a marriage to his son, without much of either of their opinions. He had not even mentioned it to his own wife that he was doing so.</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>
</p><p>But she only knew about Harry’s father from the stories she had been told, having only met him a few times before that fateful Halloween night three years ago. Before Harry became an orphan. Before he became their leader. Before the boy who had previously wanted nothing to do with her decided he had to follow his father’s wishes, even from the grave.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>
</p><p>That, you see, was how two people who never wanted to be married ended up married. That was why Severus Snape was not Mr. Potter, and she not Mrs. Malfoy. Same-sex relationships were allowed in their world, and even accepted by most. It just was harder to produce an heir that way. That took true love -- and power.</p><p> </p><p>In her humble opinion, James Potter had been an idiot. There was no love truer than that which started in childhood. And there were no two men living today that were more powerful than Harry and Severus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>
</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">                        </span>********************</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>
</p><p>Hermione was sitting at dinner, at her husband’s right hand, as always. Severus was on his left, dressed in robes of black that seemed to engulf him. Nearby sat Draco, the lines of his young face present, and tight. Surely a man in his early twenties should not have so many lines on his face?</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>
</p><p>They stared at each other, and she took in the way his pale hands lay rigidly on the oak wood table. His eyes rested on the bodice of her dress, and she remembered how low cut it was.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>
</p><p>His mother, Narcissa Malfoy, the women who had raised them both, gave each a dirty look. As someone who had spent her whole life at court, she felt they were playing with fire. She just hoped her child, her son, would not be the one to get burned.</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>
</p><p>Draco and Hermione did not speak regularly in public, which meant basically never. They were too fearful of what the commander might think, and of what he would do to them if he were to find out their thoughts. How he would punish them for their transgressions, which only took place in their minds. These thoughts were betrayals all the same. Or at least they were in the world they lived in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>
</p><p>Harry started to speak, and Hermione turned to face her husband, taking in his wild hair, which was neither wavy or curly. Black as night. Black as coal. His eyes were green, the same color as the killing curse. His skin was pale and clear. He looked like he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, and in a way, he did just that. He was the one who stood against the raids that ripped apart the houses on the edge of the community. He was the one who had the final say of where Muggleborns or half-bloods with one Muggle parent were placed.</p><p> </p><p>Did he regret doing so? He had never asked her what it had been like to be taken from her parents. She knew he only spoke to Severus about such things, not even realizing the former abused and neglected child's opinions on Muggles would be clouded by his father’s abuse. She thought about her own Muggle parents, her mother’s perfume, her father’s laugh. The happy smile he would give her mother. Both of them taking turns at telling her stories at night. As much as she had grown to love the Malfoys over the twelve years they had raised her, Narcissa would never be her mother. Lucius would never be her father. And thankfully, Draco would never be her brother.</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>
</p><p>Her parents were the people she had not seen since she was six years old, Anna and Mark Granger. Two people who would have loved their daughter more than anything, no matter the fact that she was magical. Not that her husband cared about her opinions. To him, she was just a stupid woman. Something that should keep her mouth shut, keep her legs spread, and give him sons to take his place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>
</p><p>She snapped out of her own thoughts and actually bothered to listen to her husband ramble on about the Muggleborns they had saved. Her husband was raised in this world, from the day he was born. She did not blame him for opinions. He had been indoctrinated from his own childhood, unlike her. She was able to remember the world outside of these castle walls and the villages which were clustered around it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The true cause of this horrid practice was Harry’s grandfather, Charles James Potter. He had known a time where Hogwarts was simply a school where magical children went to learn, Muggleborn and magic born alike. Back then, the two realms only brushed against one another when they had to and children like Severus may have been left with his abusive parents, but those like Hermione would have never been taken from hers. Instead of simply taking the children who were abused or neglected, Charles Potter had decided it was better to take them all, for the greater good.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>
</p><p>The greater good. She had grown to hate those words. The greater good did not mean good for all, or even good for some, it meant foisting what might help a few on all of them and calling it good. There was no good in removing children from perfectly good parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>
</p><p>Sometimes she wondered why Severus’s mother Eileen hadn’t just left Tobias, the Muggle. Surely the true greater good would be allowing people like her to leave an abusive man, and allowing children who were abused by both parents a place to go? Charles Potter’s plan had been based on one which could have saved many people, instead, he had warped it into the fractured form it was now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Truth was, no Muggleborns spoke out against the system, for fear of what could be done to them. Hermione was guilty of this herself. So that left one type of voice, the voices raised in approval.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And one of those loudest voices was clutching the hand of the very man in place to change the practice. Severus. It seemed he could not keep his hands off her husband, even in a public place. Suddenly she wanted to curse on the grave of James Potter. She wanted to never have run into him that day in the market.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>
</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">                      </span>************************</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was just Harry’s cover, the little doll he could show off at parties, his ”beard”--that term was sometimes thrown around by other women. The reason Hermione was not pregnant and had never been pregnant, was that her husband had only shared a bed with her once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>
</p><p>On their wedding night, he could not finish. She had offered to help him. She had even at one point wryly suggested Severus join them, anything to get their stupid but necessary heir conceived. But Harry insisted he was not gay, he was not sleeping with Severus! And how dare she suggest he needed a man to be able to get off!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He had slapped her across the face and chucked her out of his chambers that night. She went to her own rooms that night, right next to his. And then she heard the clicking of hard-soled leather boots on the stone floor. Severus, coming to comfort his lover.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>
</p><p>She wanted to hate them both. She wanted to out them. She wanted to do such horrible things to them. What stopped her was a photo on her husband’s desk of two black-haired little boys, smiling and hugging, one in rich heavy robes of velvet maroon, the other in robes of evergreen wool. Harry and Severus were being punished far more for the choices of the man who did not care about anyone’s feelings far more than she ever would.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>
</p><p>That night Hermione had given up on ever being someone’s mother. That night she imagined Draco had joined her in her room as she touched herself. That night she realized her marriage, no matter how much she tried, would ever be a one filled with love and happiness. That night she stopped hating Severus Snape and Harry Potter for the fact they were in love with one another. Because Harry was never going to admit that he was gay, even to the very woman he was married to saying she would accept that he was that way. Allow him to have his needs met and produce an heir.</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>
</p><p>But most of all she felt sorry for Severus because he was in love with a man who it seemed, for now, was incapable of admitting to anyone else he loved him. Severus and herself were just two creatures caught in the snare that was the Potter family. They were both going to suffer for the rest of their lives for the actions of James and Harry Potter. That night she realized she was in love with Draco Malfoy, and she was never going to get to be his wife, no matter how much she longed to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>
</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">                         </span>*******************</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>
</p><p>Narcissa Malfoy pulled Hermione’s corset tighter. “Breathe,” she hissed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>
</p><p>The woman who raised her helped her into her riding dress. Riding was Hermione’s only escape from her life, the life which was slowly choking the spirit out of her. She rarely spoke to anyone without them speaking to her first. She mostly lived in her mind. With her opinions, thoughts and beyond that in her books. Her precious books.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>
</p><p>Lucius had taught her to ride when she was seven after she had basically ignored him for a whole year. He had been the target for most of her temper tantrums. Her first pony was an old forest pony that had been Draco’s before he had moved on to larger horses. The old grey, named Dragon, was moody, touchy and opinionated, just like most ponies. However, he was the perfect first horse. He preferred to walk rather than trot and often he stopped moving at all. The angry little girl had more in common with that pony then she dared to admit. He also helped her see Lucius as something than the mean man who was a piss poor replacement for her Muggle father.</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>
</p><p>Narcissa turned her when she was finished helping her dress, ”Hermione, depression is unbecoming of your position. And as the years go on, you are only getting worse. I think you should see a mind healer.”</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>
</p><p>Hermione gave the stern-faced woman a dirty look. Narcissa of all people should know better. She married Lucius when she was barely seventeen. They had never spoken before their wedding. ”And what good will that do?” she hissed. ”Will that make my husband share my bed? Will that stop the court from wondering if I am infertile? He tossed me aside like a broken wand. Imagine being trapped in a marriage with a man who refuses to touch you, who barely looks at you. Tell me, would you be happy if that was the case?”</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>
</p><p>“No, I would not be.” Her pale blue eyes took in Hermione with her wild untamable curls, her narrow small frame, the wool navy blue riding dress, her brown soulful, but broken eyes. Hermione did not look the twenty-three she was. She looked decades older, with the haunted look that makeup and beautiful clothing could not hide.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>
</p><p>“I am going to ride with Father. Artemis is in desperate need to stretch her legs.” Hermione’s sorrowful tone cut through Narcissa like a knife. She stood there watching as the closest thing she had to a daughter left her dark room to go and find her temporary peace in the fields that surrounded the castle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>
</p><p>Narcissa could not save Hermione anymore than she could save her sisters Bellatrix and Andromeda, whose paths were quite different. Any more than she could have saved herself when her own father said she was to marry Lucius Malfoy. Lucius had thankfully turned out to be at least a decent husband. He was far from perfect, but he could have been far worse.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">                       </span>********************</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>
</p><p>Hermione breathed in the smell of the barn--the hay, the sweat, the leather, and the horses. It was like coming home, far more than her rooms or Harry’s in the castle, or even the Malfoys’ cottage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Terry,” she called. The old stablehand came from the tack room near the back of the barn. He smiled at her. He too was a Muggleborn or a half-blood like Snape. He did his job and mostly kept to himself. He had a wand and could use magic, but wasn't heavily trained in it. His clothing was functional, though plain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He smiled at her in greeting. “I will go fetch Artemis,” he said. Soon the mare was led in the barn from her small pasture. She was a fawn-colored bay, and er brown eyes were sharp and clinical. She was well over sixteen hands. Like her mistress, she had purposeful movements and she was built to cover the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>
</p><p>Terry ground tied the mare, leaving the leather lead on the ground near her large hooves before he grabbed her tack and went to work. Just then, Draco of all people walked into the barn. The sheer sight of him sent shivers down Hermione’s back. She had known him for nearly two decades, and yet until she could not have true-time with him, she never realized how much he meant to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>
</p><p>He smiled at her, his silver eyes beautiful, and he said, “Father is too busy to go riding with you so he sent me.” He went to retrieve and tack his own horse, who was named Lancelot and was a large black gelding who looked as if he was the horse upon which death would ride. The horse and man were exact opposite in coloring, but it simply looked right to Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>
</p><p>Just as Terry was about ready to help her mount Artemis, Sirius Black walked into the barn. He was dressed in a long frock coat of wool, leather boots, and his long wavy hair hung into his once possibly handsome face. His sneer ruined it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>
</p><p>“Well what do we have here?” he asked. His piercing blue-grey eyes judged her just as he always did. Everything she ever did would not be good enough for his precious Harry Potter, his godson. Everything she did under his scrutiny. Everything she did he took in waiting for her to cross an invisible line so he could toss her out. He was her greatest critic. His hatred for her was palpable in the very air surrounding him. He wished to one day tell her, “look how the mighty have fallen.''</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>
</p><p>She snarled at him, unwilling to be the proper lady Narcissa had so desperately trained her to be. “We are going on our ride. My husband knows I go on rides regularly. He even approves of it. Lucius, my father, normally is my chaperone, but he is busy today. So, he sent Draco. I am sure of the fact that his business is with Harry, so surely he knows that Draco was sent to join me on my ride.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">      </span>
</p><p>The smart look she gave him dared for him to question her or to push the issue. Terry helped her mount Artemis while Draco mounted Lancelot. She took the reins in her gloved hands.</p><p> </p><p>“You should not be riding if you are pregnant,” said Sirius. “You could cause harm to the future commander if you do.”</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>
</p><p>She turned to face him. “I am not pregnant Sirius, and there is no risk to the future commander because as of now there is none.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>
