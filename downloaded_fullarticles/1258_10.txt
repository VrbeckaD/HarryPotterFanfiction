          <div class="userstuff"><p>I bit my lip and looked over at Bill again. He was staring intensely at his ancient tunes textbook, just as he had been the last three times I had looked at him in as many minutes.</p><p>I went back to my own textbook on herbology, trying to focus on what it was saying about growing wormwood, however I couldn’t help but replay today’s events in my mind once again.</p><p>“Have I got something on my face?”</p><p>My boyfriend’s words made me jerk my head up to look at him.</p><p>“No... why?”</p><p>“You keep staring at me. Made me a bit paranoid I’d smudged ash on it or something when I lit the fire...”</p><p>I smiled at him.</p><p>Bill was officially on head boy duty this evening so had to sleep in the on duty head boy/girl room.<br/>
Not that either of us were complaining. The on duty bedroom had a large comfortable double bed. I’d been staying over every time he was on duty since I’d turned 16.</p><p>We’d said night to the others after dinner as always, and I’d considered it a personal victory that Tonks and Tulip had finally stopped sniggering as we headed off together. I knew Bill was similarly relieved that Charlie was now looking him in the face again when he wished him goodnight instead of  anywhere but.</p><p>Again, as always, we’d changed into our pjs and dug out our books to do a last bit of studying before bed. After all, O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s were approaching at a rate of knots.</p><p>“No, you’re fine. Sorry for staring.”</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine, seriously.”</p><p>I made to go back to my book, but Bill leaned over and kissed me. I suspect he intended for it to be a quick peck, but I opened my mouth, and before long we were having a good, full-on make out session.</p><p>Bill pulled me on to his lap and I started to grind down on to him.</p><p>He moaned into my mouth as I felt him harden under me.</p><p>I smiled as I started to undo his faded pyjama top (this set had once belonged to his father) and slowly kissed my way down his chest.</p><p>When I reached the waistband of his pyjama bottoms I gave them a tug down over his hips as I slipped off his lap onto my knees.</p><p>“MC... you don’t have to-“</p><p>He was cut off as I licked his cock from base to tip before taking it in my mouth.</p><p>I love watching his face as I go down on him and this time was no different. As I traced the letters of the alphabet around the tip (as I had learnt from one of the many muggle magazines Penny had had delivered from home), I worked the base with my hands.</p><p>My jaw had just started aching when I felt the familiar pulsing meaning he was about to come.</p><p>“Oh-oh-MC!”</p><p>I wiped my mouth and chin as I pulled away from his softened cock and quickly walked over to the small en-suite bathroom to spit and brush my teeth.</p><p>While I quite liked giving Bill blow jobs, I did not like the taste of his ejaculate.<br/>
When I came out of the bathroom, he had refastened his top, pulled up his bottoms and was leaning against the four poster double bed.</p><p>“Come here,” he said.</p><p>I did so, and as I approached the bed he pulled me into a one-armed hug and down so we both sitting on the bed.</p><p>“What’s up? And don’t say nothing-“ he continued as I opened my mouth to say just that. “I know you. You’ve been acting off all evening.”</p><p>I sighed.<br/>
“You heard what happened with Ismelda and Emily in the courtyard?”</p><p>He grimaced.<br/>
“Yeah. Poor Ismelda. No one deserves that.”<br/>

He then buried his face in his hands.<br/>
“And I can’t believe I ever fancied Emily Tyler...”</p><p>I couldn’t help but giggle.<br/>
“Yeah, bad call on your part. Luckily you came to your senses and started fancying someone better!” I teased.</p><p>“Who is incredibly modest!”</p><p>“One of my many charms!”</p><p>We both laughed.</p><p>“Anyway, what happened afterwards?”</p><p>I explained how Penny and I had tried to help Ismelda be more sociable and Ismelda’s attempts to tell Barnaby how she felt.<br/>
Bill was, as always, a good listener and he pulled another face as I described what had happened in the care of magical creatures clearing.</p><p>“Barnaby’s a great guy but...” he tailed off.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>He sighed. “What happened next?”</p><p>I continued the story talking about how Penny and I had managed to convince Ismelda not to give Barnaby the love potion she had gotten from Jae.</p><p>Bill sighed again.<br/>
“I’m going to put that little smuggler in detention! He should know better than to hand those out willy nilly!”</p><p>“Please Bill, let him off this time,” I pleaded. “Just watch him more closely. If you put him in detention, the whole school will find out why and poor Ismelda will be humiliated again...”</p><p>His face softened. “Fine. Next time though... anyway, I’m sorry, I interrupted you darling. Go on.”</p><p>“Well, Barnaby overheard everything.”</p><p>“Oh man...”</p><p>“So, he... um...” I tailed off.</p><p>“Declared his undying love for her then and there? Said he couldn’t stand her and that she was never to even come into his sight again?”</p><p>“Not... not exactly.”</p><p>“Well then what did he say?”</p><p>I stared at the floor.</p><p>“Spit it out babe,” he urged.</p><p>“HelistedallthewaysIvehelpedhimandbasicallysaidhehadacrushonme,” I blurted out quickly.</p><p>Unfortunately or maybe fortunately, Bill was quite used to how quickly I could talk and so understood perfectly.</p><p>“He revealed he had a crush on you?”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Well, I don’t blame him,” he said smiling. “You’re perfect.”</p><p>He leaned over and kissed me gently.</p><p>“Wait,” he said, pulling away. “Is this why you’ve been acting weird? Staring at me, giving me a blow job for no reason - not that I’m complaining far from it! -,” he added hastily.</p><p>“Yesss...” I replied hesitantly.</p><p>“That makes literally no sense, MC. Why would you do that??”</p><p>“I felt guilty!”</p><p>He looked at me as if I’d grown an extra head.<br/>

“But why??? Why would you feel guilty??? You’re not responsible for how someone else feels or acts!! You’re only responsible for how you act! And I know you’d have told Barnaby-“</p><p>“That he’s a lovely guy, I’m honoured that he thinks of me that way, but I’m dating and in love with you!” I interrupted. “I grabbed him after defence against the dark arts earlier and said so.”</p><p>“Well there we go. Why the guilt?”</p><p>I felt rather silly now. “Because...”</p><p>“Darling, I trust you. 100%. If a guy confesses that he fancies you, I’m just going to feel smug that I’m lucky enough to be with you.” He paused for a moment.<br/>
“Wait... you’re in love with me?” He raised an eyebrow at me.</p><p>“Nooo!!” I felt my face go bright red and I curled up into a ball on the bed.</p><p>I heard him laughing as he gently pulled me out of it.</p><p>“I hope you love me, MC, because I love you.”</p><p>I turned round to face him.<br/>
“You do?”</p><p>He smiled.<br/>
“Yes. Very much.”</p><p>I felt myself flush again, but for a totally different reason.</p><p>“I love my clever, kind, beautiful girlfriend, who loves me back and who has chosen to be with me,” he whispered into my ear.</p><p>“And now, because I don’t want her to leave me for someone else who has also realised how awesome she is, I’m going to make sure she knows how much I appreciate her.”</p><p>With that he gently started unbuttoning my nightdress and kissing his way down my neck and chest, perfectly mimicking what I had done earlier.</p><p>Though he did get rather distracted by my boobs, licking and sucking my nipples and aerolas so much I thought he was going to make me come through that alone before he continued kissing his way down my body.</p><p>Once he got to my pubic mound he gently pushed my legs open and kissed my clit before starting to lick very, very slowly.</p><p>With every lick I felt heat rushing through me, and I could feel myself getting wetter and wetter.<br/>
Bill continued to lick and tease my clit with his teeth as he opened me up with his fingers and slid one of his thumbs into me.</p><p>I started to pant as he gently started to circle his thumb inside me and suddenly I felt myself peak and explode.</p><p>As I lay there coming back to myself, I noticed Bill was refastening my nightdress.</p><p>“Don’t want you to get cold,” he said by way of explanation when I looked at him quizzically.</p><p>He pushed the last button into its hole then kissed me gently.</p><p>I kissed him back, tasting myself on his tongue.</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about me going anywhere, Bill,” I whispered.</p><p>“Good,” came the response as he kissed me again.</p></div>
