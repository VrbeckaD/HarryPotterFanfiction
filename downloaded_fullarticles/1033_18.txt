    <span>We have arrived at our destination. No matter what Granger said, it is not covered in snow here, and to think people call her the brightest witch of our age. The cottage is small with just 3 bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen with just all the necessities and a living room with a fireplace. Luckily as we're boyfriends Harry and I were given the biggest room as it was the farest away from the other rooms. Ronald was the one to give us it, as apparently he thinks we're some morons who can't go 5 days without sex. I truly do wonder if he and Ginevra are truly related as she is so much more sensible. </span>

    <span>This afternoon we went into the village. It consist of small, old houses, but all together it looks cozy. And there was a nice pub in the centre of the village. The woman that served us said she recognized me and that she knew you from school. I was told to give you her greetings so greetings from Anna. </span>

    <span>Before we all went to bed, we made a small campfire, or well, Luna and Ginevra made a campfire, while the rest of us roasted marshmallows. Once these were all gone we went all to bed, but not with a final reminder to use silencing charms from Ronald. </span>
