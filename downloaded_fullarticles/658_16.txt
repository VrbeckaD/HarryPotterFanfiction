    <p>This isn't what I expected. Actually, no, fuck that, this isn't <em>where I wanted to be.</em> I could take dying. Dying sounds real nice right now.</p>
<p>There is no definite or accurate description to tell you what kind pile of shit I'm in right now. But, for starters, it seems I'm stuck in a book.</p>
<p>That doesn't necessarily include glue. I mean I'm in the <em>world</em> dictated by a fucking <b><em>book.</em></b> Which is just great. Wonderful. An absolute delight. Really.</p>
<p>And to make matters worse, I'm not even sure I'm in the <em>canon</em> world. What do I mean? Here's some context.</p>
<p>For all the years I was stuck in an apartment surrounded by saltwater, I had books I could read. My brother (Who I labeled D because Dave is kind of like my estranged twin or something – wait, maybe <em>I'm</em> the estranged sibling...) left me some so I didn't really get bored per se, for a couple of years.<br/>Sometimes photographic memory can be a blessing and a curse. Good for gathering info quickly, but when enjoying something...not so much.</p>
<p>Anyway, like what I assume any normal person would, I have the complete set of the Harry Potter Series. Once I finished that I delved into it a lot, most of it for Roxy's sake since she was the one who liked it. I just used it as a distraction before I discovered the game and built Hal.</p>
<p>Okay, so I know Harry Potter, the world I'm stuck in. Good. Whether it was the <em>original </em>world or not, that I wasn't really sure of.</p>
<p>Oh, right. Before I subsequently forget this little detail, I'll write it here. Y'know. To help with my sanity.</p>
<p>I'm now Ron Weasley. Yeah, you heard right.<em> Ron Weasley.</em> That redheaded bloke who's good at chess but lets his goddamn arrogance get the better of him at times - but compared to me...</p>
<p>Well, he's probably the closest to a perfect fit for me, really, but that's kind of a moot point since I<em> am </em>him. In the flesh and bone.</p>
<p>As for where I am...? I don't really recognize this place, but it looks like a forest.</p>
<p>
  <em>Snap.</em>
</p>
<p>Wait. What was that?</p>
<p>(Future Edit: For reference, to whoever's reading this, I installed a speech/thought/sound-to-text function on my glasses. Isn't the game enabling me to make whatever the fuck I want via alchemiter wonderful? Yes, my Sylladex is still perfectly functioning. I'm still that dude who can destroy souls. Fear me, rawr rawr.)</p>
<p>
  <em>"He's around here somewhere. I felt his magic signature."</em>
</p>
<p>Well, thank god I watched the movies as well. That's Daniel Radcliffe's Harry Voice. I wonder if I should go and meet him, act like the idiot Ron is.</p>
<p>
  <em>"He's not getting away this time. We'll make ickle-Ronniekins pay, Harry, don't you worry."</em>
</p>
<p>Uh. Excuse me? No. What. Those are the twins, right? Gred and Forge?</p>
<p>And what the fuck's this about me paying? Did this world's Ron do something?</p>
<p>
  <em>"Tom says he's just around the corner, but I want you two to be careful."</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Roger that, boss!"</em>
</p>
<p>Woah woah woah. Hang on. That definitely sounds like I – Ron, did something. Also...Tom?</p>
<p>Like...Tom Riddle– oh. Oh <em>fuck.</em></p>
<p>This is a problem. Somehow I'm in...god, this sounds <em>really fucking idiotic,</em> but I'm most likely in one of those fanfictions where Dumbledore is <em>'the bad guy'</em> in the sense that he's bashed beyond any recognition, with HP/LV slash thrown into the mix if what I'm hearing is right. I could be wrong. But I'm willing to bet there's some Ron bashing in here too, good lord.</p>
<p>That would explain why they're looking for me?</p>
<p>How do I even get out of this?</p>
<p>...okay, I'm going to turn this thing off for a while. I need to not think about anything else other than escaping them, first and foremost.</p>
<p>I'll update you in a bit.</p>
