          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco scowls as he stumbles backward, silvery grey eyes locking onto the obstacle he had collided with in the halls. “Granger.”<br/>
He watches as she adjusts the books in her hands, blowing a curl out of her face before her chocolate brown eyes meet his, glaring back at him. “Malfoy.”<br/>
“I know it’s difficult,” He drawls, “But I thought you were competent enough to at <em>least</em> watch where you are walking. Or was I mistaken?”<br/>
“You shouldn’t talk about yourself like that,” Hermione replies with a false sweetness that drips from her lips, “It isn’t good for your mental state, or at least what’s left of it.”<br/>
Scowling, he tugs on his robes to straighten them; girls did not give him snippy comments in return. They were meant to fear him and turn away with heads bowed, or beg him to take them.<br/>
But Granger always was a bit different.</p>
<p>“Surprised to see you out of the library.” Draco sniffs, his right arm twitching a bit as the skin on his forearm tingles. “Thought that was where you permanently lived.”<br/>
Her eyebrows arch up in surprise, arms tightening around her books, “You know my whereabouts in the day?”<br/>
“No!” He snaps out quickly, crossing his own arms against his chest as the skin on his arm seems to burn a little more. But he was a Malfoy, and Malfoy’s did <em>not</em> display signs of weakness or pain. “It is simply general knowledge that you spend majority of your life in the library, Granger.”<br/>
Hermione stares over at him, her eyes peering into his curiously and making Draco want to shift uncomfortably. Instead, he stares back at her, waiting for some other comment to come.<br/>
But she doesn’t reply with a snarky word or two. Instead, her head tilts to the side and she blinks once, then twice.<br/>
Then she smiles.<br/>
“See you around, Malfoy.” Hermione says calmly, stepping around him and continuing down the hall.<br/>
It’s his turn to blink; first at the spot she’d been standing, and then at her retreating figure after spinning around to watch her go.<br/>
<em>What the fuck?</em> Draco thinks to himself. Because Granger did not smile at him. And did not insinuate that they would purposely see one another again.<br/>
Except before he can think further on it, the burning in his arm starts up again, and he rubs at his arm over his robes as he pivots on his heel and continues marching back towards the Slytherin common room.<br/>
Granger didn’t deserve another thought anyways.</p>
<p>“What’s got your knickers in a twist?” Theo comments as Draco falls heavily onto the couch beside him.<br/>
“Elegantly put as always, Theo.” Blaise comments with a light eye roll, tucking a bookmark in between the pages of his book and closing it lightly. “But he makes a good point. What’s the matter with you?”<br/>
“Nothing.” Draco scowls, rubbing at his arm once more. “What makes you think something is wrong?”<br/>
“Your face is more miserable than usual.” Theo answers with a shrug.<br/>
“And that’s saying something,” Blaise points over at Draco, “Considering how miserable you always look.”<br/>
“Cheers.” Draco mutters distractedly; the burning had increased and was proving to be more difficult to ignore or hide.<br/>
“Fine, if you won’t answer that question,” Theo shifts in his seat so he’s leaning against the armrest of the couch, hooking one knee up onto the cushion and resting his ankle on his opposite knee, “Answer this: do you have some sort of disease?”</p>
<p>That forces Draco’s attention back to his best mate, his eyes snapping over to Theo’s, “What?! I do not have a disease, you idiot! Why the fuck would you even say that?”<br/>
“Because of that.” Theo replies easily, pointing a finger towards where Draco’s hand is still rubbing his robe covered arm roughly.<br/>
“You have been scratching at it since you entered,” Blaise hums, “So what is it? Hopefully not something contagious.”<br/>
“I don’t bloody know what’s going on.” Draco barks out, “I just know that I ran into stupid Granger and then my arm started burning and it won’t stop!” He finishes his sentence with a dramatic flourish of shoving the sleeve of his robe up, displaying the skin of his forearm. The normally alabaster skin was red and irritated, no doubt from Draco’s ministrations, but there also seemed to be some sort of symbol appearing amongst the marred spot.<br/>
“What the fuck?” Draco mutters, his hand hovering over his forearm as he stares down at his skin.</p>
<p>“Well this is an interesting development.” Blaise says with a gleeful tone. Draco lifts his gaze from his arm to see the dark-skinned wizard had stood from his chair and was now standing over Draco, smirking down at him.<br/>
“What does that mean?”<br/>
Chuckling from his right causes Draco’s eyes to flicker over to Theo, who’s shaking his head and continuing to laugh quietly to himself.<br/>
“Will one of you idiots please explain what is so bloody entertaining?!”<br/>
“Wait.” Is all Blaise says, one finger tapping against Draco’s arm, and the blonde wizard’s eyes fall to the reddened skin.<br/>
The symbol was forming before his eyes, and in a matter of seconds, Draco was staring down at an elegant looking quill of about four inches long, stained into his skin like it had been there for many years now. Lifting his arm closer to inspect the detail of the newly appeared tattoo, he frowns deeply as he realizes there’s three letters written in cursive in the middle of the feather of the quill.<br/>
“H…J…G?”<br/>
Theo’s quiet laughter grows into a loud and raucous sound instead, and he’s half bent over himself as he slaps his leg. Blaise gives a softer laugh of his own, his dark brown eyes twinkling with mirth down at Draco.<br/>
But neither offer any further explanation.</p>
<p>“Dammit,” Draco growls, reaching over and punching Theo in the leg, and then he focuses in on Blaise, aiming to assault the other man, only for him to step away, still laughing softly. “Someone better fucking explain this bullshit right now! And tell me what is so god damn funny!”<br/>
“Mate,” Theo wipes at the corner of his eye, “You really don’t know?”<br/>
Draco’s teeth grind together, “Clearly not. So explain!”<br/>
“It’s your soulmate mark.”<br/>
“My…what?!”<br/>
“Your soulmate mark,” Blaise replies as Theo tips back against the armrest, lost in laughter once more. “Did your parents never tell you?”<br/>
“No.”<br/>
“When you encounter your soulmate at a certain age, usually when you are both on the way to accepting feelings for one another,” Blaise gestures vaguely to the air, “Then your soulmate mark appears. And within that mark, the initials of your soulmate appears as well.”</p>
<p>Draco gapes up at his friend; how did he not know of this? But now that he was hearing it, things began to click together. His father had a mark on his arm that Draco had only seen a handful of times, but within it was the initials of his mother, although when he was younger, the letters had meant nothing to Draco. Not helped by his father’s reluctance to discuss or display the mark.<br/>
“How do…” He swallows, eyes darting between his two friends, “Have you two?”<br/>
“Not me, no.” Blaise answers with a shake of his head, “I’m still waiting. But Theo…”</p>
<p>Grinning broadly, Theo pulls back his sleeve to display a geometrical design of a fox’s head splashed across his forearm.<br/>
Draco blinks over at it, “You said that it was a tattoo…”<br/>
“It technically is.” Theo shrugs, “But you assumed it was and I thought you knew the truth so I never said anything.”<br/>
“Who’s your soulmate?”<br/>
Blaise snorts, “Who do you think?”<br/>
“She doesn’t know it yet,” Theo says at Draco’s nod of understanding, eyes flickering to the initials on Theo’s arm, “But she’ll get there.”<br/>
“As for you though…” Blaise smirks down at Draco, “This is an interesting development.”<br/>
“You said that before!” Draco snaps, the anger at being left in the dark returning tenfold. How did his two best mates know his soulmates identity when he didn’t?!<br/>
“Seriously, Draco,” Theo snickers, “It’s really simple. Quill…H, J, G…your encounter…”<br/>
Draco stares blankly over at him, and then after Blaise clears his throat, up at him.<br/>
Sighing, Blaise gestures to Draco’s arm, “Your soulmate is Hermione Jean Granger.”</p>
<p>
  <em>Well. Shit.</em>
