    <p>"Yes, Severus, return to the old fool."</p><p>"My Lord." Severus bowed, turned and left the Death Eater meeting.</p><p>"I do wonder what he has under his robes." Harry's quiet voice echoed around the hall. Voldemort and the Death Eaters saw the dreamy look on Harry's face.</p><p>"Lucius, the Ministry?" Voldemort returned to the matter at hand but could tell some matchmaking was going to be in the works.</p><p>______________________________________________________________</p><p>"Detention, Potter." Severus didn't even glance at Harry's potion. He knew it was perfect, after all, he had spent the last two years secretly teaching Harry.</p><p>"What did he do?" Weasley's ground out, his tone and body already defensive.</p><p>"Unless you wish to join Mr. Filch tonight, though you might enjoy having a date, I would suggest you close your mouth."</p><p>"I'm not gay."</p><p>"Denial, not just a river in Egypt." Draco rather loudly commented. He had learned the expression from Harry, not that any but the snakes knew Harry wasn't Dumbledore's tool.</p><p>________________________________________________________________</p><p>Draco was waiting in the hall leading to Severus' office. "He's in a mood. Dumbledore is forcing him to keep Weasley in his class."</p><p>"Great, you have it?"</p><p>"Yes, and it should help." Draco pulled out the package. All the snakes knew that Harry wasn't able to go to Hogsmeade because Dumbledore was preventing him from leaving, trying to claim it was for Harry's safety.</p><p>"Thanks, Draco. Oh, Weasley, Weaslette, and Granger were heading to ROR. Something about getting me drunk and caught in bed with Weaslette. May I crash in your rooms?"</p><p>"Sure, and I believe we might have a way to keep them busy for the next few nights."</p><p>Harry grinned. Harry remembered the last time the trio had tried anything, Draco and their friends with Neville, Luna, Lavender, and a few others got Granger removed as Head Girl after she was caught for the fifth time bullying. Colin Cleevey took different pictures of her hitting people, and when they complained to McGonagall and Dumbledore, nothing was done. So the pictures found their way into Rita's skilled hands, and the Board stepped in and removed Granger. "Have Susan catch them this time."</p><p>"You read my mind." Draco was so thankful that the DA actually turned out to support Harry, not Dumbledore. They were all now junior Death Eaters and trained with Dumbledore's approval.</p><p>_____________________________________________________</p><p>"Lucius, I need you to write to Severus, he has to attend this year's ball."</p><p>"Sweetheart, you will have more sway than I will. He will just tell me no. Maybe, mention it to our Lord?"</p><p>"Yes, yes, that would be best. I will get him new robes. Did Harry mention a color he likes to see Severus wear?"</p><p>"No, I am not aware that Harry even knows we are matchmaking. I would suggest green as it would match Harry's eyes."</p><p>"Yes, that would be good. Severus has a green vest, so I could work with that." Narcissa went off, while Lucius let out a sigh of relief, he knew Severus would be attending the ball, but he didn't want to be the one to force it, as he knew Severus would make him pay. Last time, he dyed Lucius' hair bright pink.</p><p>__________________________________________________________</p><p>Lucius was making the rounds at the yearly Yule ball. He saw a variety of people already huddled in groups. He saw Harry keeping a careful eye on where Severus was, who the man spoke to, and if anyone touched Severus. Thankfully, no one had so far. "You might as well hit the man over the head and drag him to a cave."</p><p>"I'll use that as a last resort." Harry didn't face Lucius. "Who is that with him?"</p><p>"Clarence Higgins. Minor supporter. Works in the Department of Familiar Registration, no title, no real money."</p><p>"So if he disappeared?"</p><p>"Harry, no killing before you turn 18." Voldemort reminded the boy. "Besides, Severus mostly like wouldn't be able to tell you the man's name."</p><p>Harry let out a bit of a growl as said man pinched Severus' butt. Severus, however, had his wand out and now the man was a rock. Severus picked it up and placed it in the closest fireplace. "I have a fire to light."</p><p>"Harry." Voldemort escorted Harry out of the room.</p><p>Lucius watched Narcissa pick up the rock. He knew she was going to place in one of the guest bedrooms. He watched Severus move to speak to Rookwood.</p>
