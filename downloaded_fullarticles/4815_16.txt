          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Save the ashes.”</p><p>“What?” Harry’s ears were still ringing from the screams of the Howler that had just burnt itself out on his desk, and he’d just pulled his wand to vanish the mess.</p><p>“The ashes from the Howler,” Malfoy repeated with annoyance. “We can analyze them to determine who sent it.”</p><p>“We can? No one mentioned a spell for that in training.”</p><p>Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I thought you were raised by Muggles, Potter. Don’t you know about PDA testing?”</p><p>Harry tried to contain his amusement. “I don’t think you can test for that, Malfoy.

The ashes will contain her PDA.”</p><p>Harry lost his battle to refrain from laughing. “Oh! You mean <i>DNA</i>!”</p><p>Malfoy had the grace to look somewhat chagrined. “Whatever, Potter.

And I didn’t know you could get DNA off a Howler.”</p><p>Malfoy pursed his lips and nodded, but still looked displeased.</p><p>“Let me make it up to you? Come on, after work I’ll buy you a drink.”</p><p>“Alright,” Malfoy agreed, looking him up and down, “But only if you explain about PDA.”</p><p>And then the bastard <i>winked</i>.</p></div>
