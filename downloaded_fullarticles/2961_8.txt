    <p>You and Percy Weasley had been dating for a couple of years now and no one knew about it, in fact your relationship is so secret that your friends and family don’t know that you’re dating someone, this also included Percy’s friends and family. it wasn’t that you were both embarrassed of each other, in fact it was the opposite, it was something completely different than the way you both felt about each other; it’s the fact that you’re a Slytherin and he’s a Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Your houses were suppose to hate each other, they had a rivalry and they’ve always had a rivalry, or at least that’s what you could tell, whether it was different once before the rivalry had started you didn’t know. But right now when the two houses were suppose to hate each other you both didn’t want anything bad happening to each other. </p>
<p>So this meant secret meetings in a quiet corridor where people hardly venture, having secret dates when you could both manage to sneak away from everyone else and some times it was hard to do, some times the two of you wondered just how long you could keep your relationship a secret from everyone else.</p>
<p>Until you left Hogwarts? You could tell your parents about it once you left, that way the houses wont matter and you could both just be yourselves, or would it be until someone finds out about you both dating? You hoped not, you didn’t want any Slytherin tormenting Percy anymore than they usually do now and oh boy if they did they may just end up regretting it,  or would you break up with each other because of all the secrecy? That was always an option, one that you hated and hoped would also never happen.</p>
<p>“[Y/N]? Is everything alright?” Percy asked you, his hand gently squeezing yours as if to get your attention. You had both managed to sneak away from your friends long enough to sneak away so that you could both just spend some time together. You hadn’t really been lost in thought, you had been paying attention what he had been talking about, it was just that you were thinking of something.</p>
<p>You hummed in response and looked up at him with a soft smile, “everything is fine” you replied, giving his hand a gentle squeeze in return. “You seem distracted” he commented, you scrunched your nose up, pressing your lips together into a thin line, “I was listening, I promise” you responded, you felt bad, feeling as if he felt ignored. “You usually are” he laughed out as he moved his hand from yours and wrapped his arm around your waist, pulling you into his side</p>
<p>You carefully wrapped your arm around him, the two of you walking along the street until you came across a bench that you both sat on, you leaned into him, your head placed on his shoulder carefully as you crossed your right leg over your left, Percy gently placed his chin on top of your head and smiled, he like how content that he could be around you and that some times you didn’t need to talk and could just sit and be quiet for hours.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about?” He asked sounding as if he is genuinely curious as to what you’re thinking about, you gave a shrug of your shoulders “how Gryffindor is going to kick Slythriens ass at Quidditch again” you laughed out, “I thought you didn’t care about Quidditch” he said, thoughtfully almost sounding as if he forgot whether or not you did care for the ‘sport’.</p>
<p>“I don’t” you laughed, gently jabbing him in the side with your elbow, making him move his torso the best he could away from your elbow, “then why did you say you were?” He questioned, moving his chin from your head and pressed a quick kiss to the top of your head, you gave a shrug of your shoulders, “because I know that you like Quidditch?” You offered.</p>
<p>He hummed thoughtfully, his eyes still on you as they always were, taking in how how you looked and the way your hair fell over your shoulders and how it framed your face perfectly. “Mmh, I do like Quidditch, but I like you a lot more” he whispered out, his lips brushing against your hair.</p>
<p>“Is everyone as sweet as you?” You asked him without looking up, your eyes settled on a tree that had a squirrel running about beneath it. “Most of the people in his family, yes” two very familiar voices came from the left of you, causing you to jump away from him, Percy moved to the end of the bench as much as he possibly could without falling off, his arm falling from around you as he moved it away, dropping his hands to his lap as he looked over to where two of his brothers stood, the twins, of course it would be the twins who loved to tease people restlessly.</p>
<p>“What are you two doing here?” He asked his brothers, George and Fred exchanged a look, a grin come across their faces and you knew what was going to happen, “well, you seemed to go missing for a couple of hours nearly everyday. So we decided to follow you, see where you go an what you do.” Fred replied, George nodding his head in agreement with his brother “and now that we know you have a girlfriend, who’s really pretty by the way, we understand why you take a couple of hours off, especially for a date” George added on.</p>
<p>You stared at them quietly for the longest time, unsure on what to say. You didn’t know what to do even, do you get up an leave?Do you try explaining it to them? Do you break up now? You had no idea what to do and the only thing that you could muster up to say were a couple of throaty noises. Fred an George thankfully ignored it, looking at Percy expectantly, as if waiting for an answer from their brother, who had moved over to you once again, a hand going straight to your back to comfort you and to make you feel better, it didn’t work much but you still felt a little bit better.</p>
<p>When He didn’t reply as he too was still trying to figure out what to do or even say, Fred spoke up once more. “We should tell mum and dad about you having a girlfriend, they’d love to see her”, Percy’s face turned into a look of horror at the thought, he wasn’t even ready for his own brothers to know about him dating someone, let alone his parent’s knowing about it. “No!” Percy said a little too quickly for the twins liking.</p>
<p>This of course got them thinking as to why you two were keeping your relationship a secret. “Why? Are you embarrassed of her?” George asked, “maybe this is something other than dating?” Fred suggested, you frowned at them “what the hell?” You got out, making a face at them, you didn’t like the implication that Fred had just made with his latest suggestion and honestly? You felt a little bit offended about it but you knew how it looked so you tried your best to not get too offended by it.</p>
<p>“No, to both of those.” Percy said with a deep sigh, reaching a hand up to his face he pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>“Then why don’t want them knowing about her?” One of them asked, “because I’m a Slytherin and from what Percy has told me, no one in your family likes Slytherins” you told them with a huff as you crossed your arms over your chest, Percy sighed pulling you closer to himself, the twins looked at each other again and then back at you and Percy.</p>
<p>“We’re still going to include it in the letter” they said with a grin on their face, a grin that you wanted to so desperately slap off of their faces, but that just might make them hate Slytherins even more than they already do. “Fred, George, I am begging you to not tell them about this” he pleaded “for [Y/N]’s sake” he added on.</p>
<p>“Too late” George said with a wink.<br/>“We’re already going to tell them” Fred added.<br/>“Besides, it doesn’t matter about her house, mum will probably love her” they finished, you and Percy got up from the bench quickly as they both started walking away, you hated that they had followed you, you hated that your privacy was now going to be ruined as most of the school will most likely know as well.</p>
<p>You groaned as you turned around and stepped into Percy, dropping your forehead to his chest, “I feel like I am going to die” you grumbled put in a quiet voice, Percy wrapped his arms around you, placing his chin back onto the top of your head. “I’ll talk to my parents long before they tell them the news, get them settled on the idea” he reassured, gently rubbing his hands on your back.</p>
<p>“Well the secret is out” you breathed out, moving your head slowly so that your chin is on his chest and you’re looking up at him through your eye lashes. “At least we don’t have to keep it much of a secret now… And we could possibly tell other people?” He said, you have a nod of your head, pushing air out through your nose.</p>
<p>“One thing at a time. Your parents being the first thing to worry about…. And then mine” you told him, “one thing at a time” he said firmly.</p>
