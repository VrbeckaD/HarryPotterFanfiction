    <p> “You were lying when you said you hadn’t done this before, right?” Bucky asked staring at Clint.</p>
<p>“What makes you say that?” Clint blushed at the heated look he was receiving.</p>
<p>“Because there is no way you can be that good for your first time.” Steve answered.</p>
<p>“I swear this is my first time doing anything like this.” Clint looked between the two supersoldiers hoping they would believe him. He was <em>actually</em> being honest with them after all.</p>
<p>“Bullshit.” Bucky nearly growled, sending a small shiver up Clint’s spine.</p>
<p>“Layoff Buck, just because we were shit at it the first time doesn’t mean someone else is going to be.” Steve laid a calming hand on Bucky’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“I’m just a man of many hidden talents, some even I don’t know about.” Clint smiled over at Bucky, a sense of relief filling him when the ex-assassin smiled back at him. Unable to resist Clint added with a smirk, “Or maybe I’m just really good with my hands.”</p>
<p>Bucky snorted, “I’ll say.”</p>
<p>He looked back down at the perfectly spun clay pot Clint had created. It had been Steve’s idea to attend a beginner’s pottery class for their date. It was something fun, easy, with a laid-back atmosphere in place where they could just relax without having to worry about anyone pestering them. Buck and Steve had already taken a few classes and secretly hoped to impress Clint with their skills or use the excuse of helping him as a chance to get closer.</p>
<p>“Maybe when we get back to the tower you can show us exactly how talented your hands are.” Steve whispered into Clint’s ear, knowing Bucky’s supersoldier hearing would pick it up.</p>
<p>Both Steve and Bucky smiled wickedly at the flush that spread over Clint’s cheeks.</p>
