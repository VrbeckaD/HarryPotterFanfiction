    <p>Harry stretched out on his bed and caught sight of a nearby clock and saw it was almost midnight on his birthday. For once he was having a good summer, guess it helped that he no longer had to stay at the Durlsey's house. Granted the only reason he had to stay last year was for the number of Death Eaters who were still around despite their master's death during the Battle at the Ministry during his fifth year. But since the remaining Death Eaters decided to take their revenge on him during his sixth year leading to most of them getting either arrested or being killed in combat it was now safe for him not to have to replenish his mom's protection from the blood wards at his Aunt's place. Having been told by Ron and Hermione that on ones seventeenth birthday one would come into their second gender of an Alpha, Beta, or Omega, Harry watched as the seconds ticked down expecting if not an Alpha at least a Beta ranking. At midnight Harry thought he would feel some pain but when it came all he felt was a slight pulse in his stomach as well as his magic. After a moment to see if anything else would happen Harry began to relax until a letter appear before him.</p><p>
  <em> Mr. Potter,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> We at Gringotts would like to congratulate you on your presenting as an Omega we would like to arrange a meeting with you at your earliest convenience. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ragnok, British Gringotts Branch Manager </em>
</p><p>"Why is it always me?" Harry asked out loud for according to Ron male Omegas were rather rare with maybe one or two born in a generation. "Though I guess that does explain why me and Gin never worked out." Thankfully she remained friends with him after the pair had tried dating last year but it had never felt right to him for some reason but as a male omega his body would only really be able to react to other males. Harry decided no time like the present as he left Grimmald Place and Apparated to Diagon Alley thinking that since they sent the letter the bank must be open and as he thought about it he had never actually seen a hours of operation and he saw that it was open yet almost empty. Stepping up to one of the free tellers. "Hello Master Goblin I received a letter asking for a meeting," Harry said passing the letter to the Goblin.</p><p>"Ah Lord Potter we have been trying to reach you for years please follow me," the teller said hopping of his stool and beckoning Harry to follow him out of the hall. Leading Harry down several hallways and to a door made of pure diamond and knocked three times.</p><p>"What is it?" an angry voice cried out from the other side of the door.</p><p>"Lord Potter here to see you Master Ragnok," the teller Goblin said.</p><p>"Ah send him in at once," Ragnok said his voice shifting tone. The teller pushed open the door and ushered Harry inside who saw an important looking Goblin seated at a mahogany desk.</p><p>"Good evening or morning Master Ragnok," Harry said bowing low and exposing his neck as protocol dictated surprising the Goblin.</p><p>"Please stand Lord Potter we have much to discuss," Ragnok said pointing Harry to one of the seats before his desk. "Now it is normal that a Witch or Wizard go through an Inheritance test after they present their secondary gender but we have been trying to get in contact with you since you had started at Hogwarts due to your time outside of the Magical world."</p><p>"I have not heard of any of that," Harry said a little confused.</p><p>"We suspected as much but we could not get you alone as it seems after your second year you stopped coming to the bank yourself," Ragnok said. "Well we can talk about it later let us get to the test." Ragnok than pulled out a silver dagger with a golden hilt, a blank parchment and some bottle of potion. "The test is quite easy all you have to do is drink the potion than take the dagger and prick your thumb of your non-dominant hand and let the blood land on the parchment," the Goblin said pushing the potion to Harry. Wanting to find out how he was an Omega for he had always heard that Omegas could only be from Pureblooded families Harry downed the potion in one gulp wincing at the taste. Picking up the dagger in his right hand he pricked his left thumb and held it over the parchment. "Very good Lord Potter it should just take a couple of minutes for your results to be shown," Ragnok said when suddenly out of nowhere a letter appeared addressed to Harrison Potter. Understanding it was for him Harry reached forward and opened it up to read it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Dearest Harrison, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope you never get this letter, but I am writing it just in case. Right now as I write this you are asleep in your crib and that bitch Lily Evens is out meeting with Dumb-ass-door. I guess that last line is a shock but if their plan comes true you will have grown up thinking that Lily is the person who gave birth to you and that you are an only child. This is all a lie, I hope you have been told that at the age of 17 Magical people gain a second gender well I am an Omega and gave birth to you and your twin brother with my Alpha, your father Regulus Black. About a month ago your older brother Sev was taken from us leading your father to go find him when he was gone Lily and Dumb-ass arrived at our home and put me under the Imperius curse to make me think that I had married Lily and that she was your barer. They made one mistake as I overheard them planning to put you in the sights of the Dark Lord which could lead to your death. Putting you in danger let my Omega free which in turn released me from the curse. I am writing this letter in case I die and have put a spell on it so that it will appear when you go through an inheritance test at Gringotts. i had pulled some stings so that the Goblins would do this during your first visit unless something else has gone wrong. If you believe that Lily is your mom you might be surprised with the results of your test just know that after you were born both you and Sev were tested to see which gender you would receive when you got older. As the Potter line is known for producing Omega and the odd Beta you were chosen to by my heir while the Black line known for producing Alpha so your brother who will be an Alpha will be that family heir. Depending how much Dumb-ass had manipulated things you may not be on the best of terms with your godparents that me and your father selected for you. During out time at Hogwarts both Regulus and myself had two great friends so we decided to both give you a name from one of them and have a friend from each of us be your godparents. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love til the end my son, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>James Potter-Black </em>
</p><p>
  <em>P.S. If you are like me you are going to have a hard time finding your Alpha mate but do not worry it will work out in the end.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry just gasped in shock as he read the letter finding out the person he had assumed who was his dad was his barer his mother had kidnapped him not to mention that he had a twin brother and his godfather was in fact his uncle. "Lord Potter I suggest you look at your results now it might clear some stuff up,' Ragnok said passing over the now filled parchment.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Name</strong>: <em>Harrison Siri Potter-Black (Omega)</em></p><p><strong> Parents</strong>:</p>

</ul><p> </p><p>Once more Harry was stunned Neville was his brother and Sirius Black was not his Godfather rather it was Remus and Snape. "Um Master Ragnok is there a way to get rid of all these?" Harry he guessed Harrison now asked pointing to the portion on magical damage and potions he was under.</p><p>"Indeed we can Lord Potter in fact your barer had it worked out to pay not only for your but your brother's as well, so if you have anything to do I suggest you do it for the cleansing might take a few hours." Harry nodded as he wrote a letter to Neville, Remus and Snape to come to the bank.</p><p>"Can you deliver these and ask for them to arrive around the time I am out of the cleansing?" Harry asked handing the letters to the Bank Manager.</p><p>"It will be taken care of," Ragnok said taking the letters as he got out of the his seat and lead Harrison out of the room and down some more similar looking corridors until they reached a dark wood door covered in runes. "Just go inside it has been prepared for," Ragnok said ushering Harrison into the room and went to send the letters.</p><p>"Ah Lord Potter your coming has been planned for a long time," a Goblin said in a higher voice than others making Harrison think that it was a female that was dressed in a lime green robe. "If you can just put these one," she said passing out a set of pure white robes etched with ruins and pointed at a section that had been closed off for him to change in. Harry quickly striped out of his sleep close and put on the robe finding them just the right size. Harrison was then directed to lay on a slab of obsidian in the middle of the room as four other Goblins in lime green robes carrying bowls of what looked like ink followed by two humans who wore the badge of a Gringott's Curse-Breaker. "We are going to put you under now Lord Potter for even the most hardy Alpha has been driven mad during a cleansing of just one item and you have six," the female healer said placing one of her hands on his head and muttered a spell he did recognized before he knew no more.</p><p> </p><p>When Harrison regain consciousness he felt lighter than he had ever felt before. "Ah, Lord Potter you are awake your guest have just arrived and are waiting for you," Ragnok said helping the human out of the bed he had been in and guiding him to the door. As they walked a mirrored surface caught his eye and caused him to stop in plaice. It seems taking away the Blood Adoption had changed his looks gone were his Avada Kedavra green eyes and in their place were startling blue orbs and his normally rat nest of hair was now silky smooth and fell to his shoulders.</p><p>"Wow," was all he could say before he was forced to move forward at Ragnok's tugging at his arm. The pair came to a plain wood door and a goblin pushed it open to reveal Snape glaring across the room at Remus and Neville.</p><p>"I should have known this was all your doing Potter," Snape said with a sneer.</p><p>"Harry is everything alright?" Remus asked.</p><p>"Harry?" Neville said a little worried.</p><p>With the unblocking of his sibling bond Harrison felt a tug to his brother as he rushes into the room and cries out, "Sev."</p><p>"What?" all three males asked in shock as Harrison rushed forward and hugged Neville.</p><p>"This might clear things up a little," Ragnok said passing over both the letter and test results. As the three read the two parchments the Bank Manager readied not one but three Inheritance test for the group.</p><p>"That just raises more questions," Remus said stroking his chin "how come I do not recall James being an Omega mated to Regulus?"</p><p>"I think it might be beneficial for you to take the test as well," Ragnok said turning to both older men as the boy who considered himself Neville Longbottom had been expected to take one since he had just come of age. Getting no argument all three of them took the test as Harrison leaned into Neville's side. Soon all three results were finished and the group leaned in and read the results together started with "Neville".</p><p> </p><p><strong>Name</strong>: <em>Severus Remus Black-Potter (Alpha) </em></p><p><strong>Parents</strong>:</p>

</ul><p> </p><p>There was silence as the group takes in what they had just learned in their test. "Master Goblin I think it might be best if we all undergo a cleansing," Snape said.</p><p>"It can be arraigned though only young Severus Black-Potter has already been paid for it though for you two I am willing to give you a discount if you agree to let us use your results in our ongoing case against Albus Dumbledore.</p><p>"Done," both Remus and Snape said shaking his hand in agreement. "Before you go through with your cleansing do you have any thing you want done while you are getting cleansed?" Ragnok asked.</p><p>"Yes can you call for my mates and son?" Snape asked.</p><p>"It will be taken care of,"Ragnok said standing up and becoming the others to follow him. Ragnok lead the group back to the cleansing room and ushered "Neville" Snape and Lupin inside but stopped Harrison from joining him. "Your presence will negativity effect their cleansing you can wait for them in our halls of healing," Ragnok said leading Harry to the room next door. "As you wait you can read some of the tomes about male Omegas," Ragnok said passing over a couple of books. Harrison grabbed the top book and began reading as he waited. He was partial through the book, <u>A Male Omega's Role in the Modern Age</u> when the doors to the hall burst open and the three members of his godfather marched in.</p><p>"Potter what are you doing here I thought this was the room we would find Severus in," Lucius said with a sneer. Harrison, along with most of the Magical World had been shocked that Lucius had gotten off from going to Azkaban but it had turned out that the man had actually been working as a spy for the Ministry the entire time and had been responsible for the capture of the Death Eaters during their attack on Hogwarts at the end of the last school year.</p><p>"I am waiting for my Godparents and brother," Harrison said not looking up from his book.</p><p>"Sirius is dead Potter and you have no siblings," Draco said with a sneer locking his eyes with Harrison. Harrison looked at him straight in the eye without flinching a little surprised for in the book he had been reading it stated despite all the time that had passed an Omega male or female could not long hold the gaze with an Alpha. Harrison felt no need to look away as he stared back at Draco who according to Snape's test was an Alpha.</p><p>"It seems we were all mistaken about many things," Harrison said still not looking away from Draco. Before Draco could offer a retort the doors to the ward opened again and several Goblins came in carrying a passed out Sev, Snape, and Remus.</p><p>"Severus," Lucius called as he rushed forward to help get the man into a bed.</p><p>"Sev," Harrison said at the same time as he went to go help his brother.</p>
