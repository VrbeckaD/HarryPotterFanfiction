    <p>           Her mother had warned her of strangers: of the way they would beckon her with sweet words, promises of the unpromisable; of how they would lie and lie and <em> lie. </em> She had not forgotten; she had <em> ignored. </em> The days had become too much — they were too long and too short, she could not remember laughing in the past week, month, <em> year </em>— and she had given in, for the first, the last, and the bloody most regretted time.</p><p>The man had been lingering around darkened corners for days, watching and waiting, before attempting to start a conversation with her. He thought she had not noticed, but <em> oh</em>, was he wrong. Evans had seen the slight bulge in his sleeve, the tense line of his shoulders and the avaricious gleam in his eye. He was one of <em> them, </em>she knew, and was far more intelligent than the others.</p><p>Evans knew, but she did not <em> know. </em> And that would cost her <em> everything. </em></p><p>She was at the park when it happened, her usual place to mope and avoid her relatives. The creak of the swing chains had been the only noise until the gravel crunched beneath his boots.</p><p>“Hello,” he had said — genial, unsuspicious, a slight accent. She could not place it exactly; was it German, Russian? There were not many foreigners in Little Whinging, and when her mother had been alive —</p><p>“Do you need something?” she had asked, kicking her feet out to stop the swing. He smiled, then: bland and <em> false. </em></p><p>“Yes,” he replied, “I would like to offer you a deal. You seem… unhappy. What if I told you that I could change your life?”</p><p>“Change my life… Unhappy?”</p><p>Of course she was unhappy — her relatives hated her, they had even before they met her, before she was thrown on them because her mother had died and her father had left with her brother… left with her brother who was everything she was not, left her mother to suffer her illness on her own, raise her on her own. And her mother had left her with the Dursley’s, who hated everything magic and strange and <em> her. </em></p><p>“Yes,” she had said. “I’m unhappy. I want my life to change.” He had stuck out his left hand — <em> strange, </em>thought Evans, even though she knew the reason why — and she had taken it in her own to seal the deal.</p><p>And then he apparated her away, shot a <em> stupefy </em>at her, and conjured magic suppressing manacles around her wrists.</p><hr/><p>           She was paying the price for her wish, she knew. The cold stones biting into her back, the thin white robes, mere wisps of threadbare fabric, barely capable of keeping her skin from freezing to the floors, the walls, all of it: from floor to wall to ceiling — it was all the same winding pattern of repeating black slabs. It was worse than the cupboard her relatives used to force her into, before she had turned eleven and demanded a real room.</p><p>The cupboard had been cramped, with the shelves perched just above her head, the wood reeking of chemicals and dust. It had always been too cold and too dark. A closet to host a secret; a skeleton. She had been glad to be rid of the place, of the spiders that crept into her cot and the dust that blanketed her. This cell reminded her too intimately of the cupboard, of the midnight shivers and encroaching darkness. Though not as cramped or familiar, it was cold — frostbitten, foreboding; impersonal. Her throat prickled from the threat hanging heavy in the air, the miasma that threatened to choke her.</p><p>Black. It was all she remembered: since the moment she had grabbed his hand, after the first time they had opened the door to her cell, and now, when she tried to recall what had happened after she clawed at her shackles until her nail beds were burning and bleeding. There was still dried blood on her fingers, crusted and browning, but the injuries were gone. Evans took it for what it was: a warning.</p><p>She could be cooperative. She would be good. Then, <em> then… </em></p><p>She would <em> fight.</em></p><hr/><p>           Her eyes remained closed upon waking. There was shuffling, moaning, a draft in the air that spoke of a room larger than her diminutive cell. The stench of bodily fluids was gone, but the heavy tang of iron remained thick on her tongue. Another cry — keening, desperate. The rattle of chains and the drag of claws over metal.</p><p>The manacles were still clasped around her wrists, unforgivingly tight and so cold they burned. They were raised above her head, hung on some manner of hook, nearly too high for her feet stay steady on the ground. Evans dragged her toes across the floor, feeling the same biting chill, but stone smoother than her own cell’s had been.</p><p>No light flickered behind her eyelids. It was dark — dark enough that she suspected it was pitch black. She opened her eyes to the darkness, squinting, barely capable of distinguishing the silhouettes of cages amongst the endless reach of shadow. Metal rattled sharply. A deafening roar echoed throughout the chamber, fear dripping down her spine.</p><p>It ended as quick as it came.</p><p>The whines and the murmurs gradually returned, a solemn, undulating wave of voices on all sides. Shifting fabrics and clicking heels chased the edges of the darkness, and Evans sought out those few, nondescript noises. The buzz grew, anxiety and fear rising in great, heaving waves. Light flooded the chamber — barely brighter than one candle’s worth, faded orange and flickering — with a wall of shadows standing behind it. The iron door creaked, groaned, and the screams started.</p><p>Breath stuttered in Evans’ chest, stuck in her lungs, choked by her ribs. <em> They won’t find me here, </em>it whispered, burrowing into her sternum, beating against her chest. The screaming was feral, shrill, wrenched from their throats by their fear and forced into the light. The darkness clung to her, the wall hugging her back, numb and still against her hammering heart.</p><p>The shadows slunk into the chamber, chains rattling, spells whispered. Everything went black. The screaming, the wailing, the shriek of nails and claws and flesh dragging over stone. Her eyes were screwed shut, refusing to open. It was dark. The iron door slammed shut.</p><p>Evans shook, gasped; vomited.</p><p>The act brought back her senses — the smell was putrid, more acid than food, more on her flimsy gown than the floor beneath her feet. A grimace, bile between her toes. A shuddering wrack of her chest and aching arms. Trembling thighs pressed together for warmth.</p><p>No one else noticed her sick in the midst of the chamber; there was enough of it elsewhere, enough blood and tears and fluids to make her sick all over again. Evans swallowed, refusing to entertain the thought, to invite the sour on her tongue.</p><p>The binds, the cells, the sea of faceless voices wailing in the dark; <em> it is a terrible place, hidden behind winds cold and sharp enough to draw blood. The cold seeps into the stones, into the hearts of those who dare go there. </em></p><p>Evans remembered sleepless nights, hidden beneath her covers, her mother’s hushed and serious whispers haunting her thoughts. <em> It is Azkaban, but for the innocent; for wayward, stolen children. </em></p><p>The door hinges groaned. The light cast shadows, and the screams began again.</p><p>In the sallow light, the shadows moved: black cloaked figures raising their wands, taking motionless bodies, cages, creatures Evans did not recognize. They left again, leaving a quieter room, an emptier chamber.</p><p>
  <em> They will steal the warmth from your skin, the light from your eyes, your magic and your name. They will take every part of you, and they will put it on display. They will give you up like goods to be sold; copper for your body, silver for your magic, and gold for your soul. </em>
</p><p>Evans had promised to stay strong. To fight.</p><p>The anxiety pooled in her stomach, a wash of nauseous dread roiling like the waters of a bog. Her heart was doing strange, terrible things in her chest; familiar and heavy beats. It was never over. It was always the same, always the fear, always the —</p><p>Screams.</p><p>Time was immeasurable in this prolonged, nerve wracking wait. The darkness seemed endless, the silence punctuated only by the soft sobs of some nearby, tortured soul; and then the screaming, the flickering candle light, the shadows dragging away limp bodies. Then the silence and the wait and the hammering of her heart. The cold.</p><p>The silence.</p><p>The door opened once more; the light filtered across the unnaturally smooth stone again; the shadows approached like clockwork in this timeless, peaceless Hell. Their footsteps were mere glides across the floor. There were no screams to be heard, no chains or thumps or nails fighting for purchase.</p><p>Just her. Just Evans.</p><p>One held their wand aloft, and another reached for her binds. A flinch rattled the manacles; fingers clenched around a wand. They lowered her arms, tugged her forwards, world spinning. Her feet obeyed their silent commands, and distantly, somewhere deep beneath the surging waves of fear and despair and exhaustion, a need to fight sparked.</p><p>Yet the iron door fell shut with the finality of death.</p><p>
  <em> Only the darkest of wizards and witches leave Nurmengard. </em>
</p><hr/><p>           The gala was decadence and debauchery; a woman strung across a man’s lap, legs fanned out and heels flat against the floor. Checkerboard tiles that wrapped around tables, dragging velvet linens and Persian rugs. A wide-mouthed set of steps and auditorium seats. A crystal chandelier, dripping black wax, a cast shadow swinging in the hum.</p><p>Excited and trilling murmurs rising in waves. A sea of masks, porcelain and held aloft by gloved hands, satin and silk ties, charms and transfigurations. The crawl of her awareness along her spine, a reverse siphon of blood, the dread splattering at the crown of her skull.</p><p>Evans twitched, head bowed low. The sick that had clung to her gown was gone, though the grime remained: along her skin, the gown, the bile on her tongue. Her head lolled, falling forward, the checkered pattern rising to meet her but not quite reaching — legs quivering, stomach rolling, her feet refusing to find footing, but continuing to walk nonetheless. She was urged forwards, towards the crowd and the whispers and the <em> danger. </em>The grip on her arm wrenched her back, nearly sending her toppling over.</p><p>The crowd did not react to her, not as far as she could tell — their masks hid more than just their identities, and the intrigued, if not slightly bored hum continued seamlessly. It was then she noticed an aberration in the air, a gently swaying, unnaturally transparent curtain. It was likely working to obscure her from the crowd, though she was not certain; nevertheless, Evans felt more secure than if she were on display for them all to see and judge.</p><p>
  <em> “If I may have your attention.” </em>
</p><p>The voice came from every corner of the amphitheatre, like the slither of something viscous and toxic, rasping at the edges, the hiss of a rattlesnake’s tail. It was familiar as it was damning: it was that man’s voice, the one with many accents and yet none, the one she had thought she had seen through but had only been blinded by her own confidence in the end.</p><p>A quiet settled over the crowd, whole and unbroken. Not a breath tarnished the silence of the theatre, the black market dressed as a festivity. Only Evans’ heart could be heard, and that, too, seemed to almost stop in the face of the man’s voice.</p><p>
  <em> “A treat has been prepared for tonight. It is unlike anything you have seen before, of that I am sure: none here has ever been graced by a creature such as this — raw magic runs through its veins, and a power hides deep beneath its skin, begging to be unleashed.” </em>
</p><p>Hands roved over her skin, and Evans shuddered, choking on bile, the hands were <em> everywhere </em> — and they were pushing, tipping her forward, sending her to her knees under a blinding light —</p><p>
  <em> “I present to you —” </em>
</p><p>She did not want to hear it: the gasp that ran through the crowd, the excited murmurs, the breaths that overlapped one another; she did not want to see it: the greed in their eyes, the desire in their eyes, the <em> disgust in their eyes, what did she do, why did she deserve this, she must not cry, she must not ever cry — </em></p><p><em> “— a </em> Chosen One <em> .” </em></p><p>And then the chamber was positively exploding, shouts rising and echoing, people standing and pushing and staring at her like they were rabid wolves and she was <em> meat</em>, like a royal treasure bejewelled with diamonds and gold and everything anyone could ever want. <em> Why, why, why, </em>she thought, chanted, pleaded — why could they not look at her with disgust instead, turn their eyes away, turn her away —</p><p>Someone grabbed the back of her head, and Evans cried out, biting her lip, smothering her protests. She pressed her eyes shut, not allowing the tears to fall but simply dangle there, like acid in her eyes. The hand roughly pulled back her hair, revealing her birthmark for all to see — it looked more like a scar than a birthmark, bright red and jagged, her skin raised with irritation.</p><p><em> “The mark,” </em> he said. <em> “It is the mark of a Chosen One. See it and behold it — the rune of </em> Sowilo<em>, etched by magic across the skin; the crimson hair of a witch, eyes as green as Death!” </em></p><p>Evans wished dearly to shake her head, to deny it all, but the grip on her scalp was unyielding. It was ludicrous, building her up for her ultimate fall. She was no Chosen One, not whatever these people wanted. She was not, never had been, nothing special —</p><p>
  <em> “Now, now — surely you all can act with the poise and dignity of the purebloods you are?” </em>
</p><p>The blood was rushing from her head, her face feeling cold and pallid, eyelashes fanning against her cheeks. There was a pinch in her neck from how it was being held back, her arms still bound, filth plastered to her skin.</p><p>Ten thousand galleons. Twenty. Fifty. A hundred, from the back, the man in the fur cloak. One-fifty. Two hundred. Five hundred. Five hundred going once, twice —</p><p><em> “One million,” </em> was announced, a response to an unseen bidder. <em> “Going once, twice, sold. That is the end of the auction, ladies and gentlemen, do see yourselves out. Any stragglers left lingering in my halls will be given accommodations in the dungeons.” </em></p><p>A shot from behind. Darkness.</p><hr/><p>           In the space between awareness and slumber, Evans remembered a time when she was more than just Evans, the estranged niece of the Dursleys. Dirt beneath the soles of her feet and grass between her toes, the heady smell of pollen and summer and something undeniably <em> home. </em>She remembered the honey-rich hum of the bees, the sharp tang of pollen in the air, the way they would flit from flower to flower.</p><p>There were so very many flowers in their garden.</p><p>“Mum,” she said, stroking a satin-soft petal. “What is this flower called?”</p><p>“That’s a tiger lily, dear,” her mother, red hair red cheeks green eyes, replied. Her hands found hers and they were soft large dirty <em> warm. </em>“My sweet girl,” she said, voice lilting with love love love —</p><p>“Do you want to know a secret?”</p><p>(No no no no<em> nononononononono</em>)</p><p>“There are many powerful things in this world. And yet the most powerful of all,” she told her, “are names. Witches and wizards have three names: one shared by the family, one taken for themselves, and one given at birth; the title, the chosen name, and the <em> true name.</em>”</p><p>Something in her fluttered with anticipation.</p><p>“The title is the family name. I am Lady Potter, your father Lord Potter, and you Heir Potter. The chosen name is the name you pick for yourself. Others may use this name if you so allow, but you are never, ever, to give out your true name.”</p><p>Her eyes, green like like the leaves under the midday sun, never strayed from her own.</p><p>“Your true name is —”</p><hr/><p>           Evans gasped awake, the jolting sensation of a <em> reneverate </em>shocking her system into alertness. She looked around, judging her surroundings, then remembered where she was: Nurmengard, the place of every magical child’s nightmares. Except, the room she found herself in was luxurious. The walls were panelled with dark wood, the seats were cushioned with red velvet, and a mahogany desk was situated before her.</p><p>“Don’t mind it,” spoke her captor, pressing his fingers together in a steeple. “It’s a bit of a slow creature. Had a bit of a fight in it when I first procured it, but that was stamped out, of course.” He smiled, a thin line slicing across his face, cold eyes narrowed in something other than mirth but close to it.</p><p>She very nearly bared her teeth, the last vestiges of her memory-dream still lingering on her mind, an ember-spitting anger festering in her chest. It roared with the bleeding pride of a Potter, urging her to fight and not submit.</p><p>But her memories spoke of cramped spaces, disgusted glances, rattling chains and bile on her tongue.</p><p>She was no Potter.</p><p>She was <em> Evans, </em> and Evans <em> survived. </em></p><p>Evans’ eyes lowered, falling listlessly to the floorboards. There was a man at her side, or so she suspected — he was fully cloaked in swaths of black, his hood pulled over his face. He was much taller than any human ought to be, and there was a strange sensation wafting off him in waves.</p><p>It pulsated against her skin as though it were a living and breathing thing, her hairs standing on end.</p><p>The man’s arm rose, rising from the shadows of his cloak with foreboding solemnity. From her peripheral vision, Evans saw his pale hand reveal itself. It was inhuman: translucent, chalky white skin that shone blue; fingers that were more bone than finger, obscenely lean and —</p><p>Her chains fell off.</p><p>Evans startled (there was no acting needed for this traumatized, meek display) and shakily picked up the manacles. He had removed them with a wave of his hand, without wand or words.</p><p>Her captor hummed, his face showing no detectable surprise. “It’s yours now,” he said, rolling up a rather long parchment. “I bid you farewell, old friend.”</p><p>The monster (for what else could he be?) stood and loomed over her. Evans rose, keeping her head ducked low, and shuffled after him. It was humiliating to admit that part of it was no act — this man, monster, being was fearsome in both his appearance and demeanour.</p><p>And his magic…</p><p>They passed through the labyrinthine halls of Nurmengard, each as dreary and dark and indiscernible as the last. She kept her gaze on the repeating line of torches and far from the man-monster-something.</p><p>There was something about him — an aura, a feeling, a certain whisper from her intuition — that had her immediately assuming the worst of him. It could have been his monstrous appearance (though she was disinclined to make assumptions based on appearances) or the strange miasma that wafted off and around him.</p><p>It was likely everything at once: the man, monster, whatever — commanded an aura of dangerousness. His magic was near undetectable, like water spilling through her fingers, or the brush of smoke against skin. To use such powerful magics — wordless, wandless, intricate and demanding — without even the slightest spike in magic, that spoke of unimaginable control.</p><p>Even now, when she focused upon his core, she could scarcely make it out. There was something — something ineffable, almost familiar… something else… A feeling that was —</p><p>The fresh air did not unclog her senses. There was still a heavy weight upon her whole being, pushing down on her like molasses and murky waters and —</p><p>Something else. But <em> what </em>was it?</p><p>Her wrist was snatched by cold fingers, devoid of the warmth of life. His hold on her was light and barely there, but Evans knew that this shackle was inescapable. He apparated them both away, and it was the most unusual apparition Evans had ever felt.</p><p>There was no way to describe it other than fleeting: one moment she was outside Nurmengard, trapped in a feather-light vice; and the next, she was in a vastly different environment. Gone were the cold, the howling winds and trenches of snow; in their place was grass green with summer, bushes and hedges and leaning trees. The air was thick with magic, enough that she could almost taste it on her tongue — the naturalness, the untouched magic of the neighbouring woods.</p><p>The hand on her wrist disappeared as quickly as it had appeared, falling to the small of her back. It was, once again, an almost imperceptible touch; but its meaning weighed heavily on her. She was guided to the lone standing house — a manor, larger than her childhood home had been, and far grander.</p><p>It was styled in a late Victorian fashion. While it was average in appearance, if not a touch opulent, there was a heavy air about the home that spoke of far more insidious inner workings. If Evans could have her way, she would not enter that house even under threat.</p><p>But the ghostly touch on her lower back was no mere threat; it was a promise.</p><p>A man greeted them at the door. He was a dour sort, with black hair that laid flat, so much so that it stuck to his forehead and clung to his shoulders. She would have called it greasy at any other time, but the man’s dark eyes seemed to almost pierce her very soul. She feared he would hear the thought, even pressed deeply beneath her anxiety and weariness.</p><p>“My lord,” the man said, his head bowing. “The room you requested is ready.” Evans did not look up, so she did not see whether her newest captor had nodded or not, but she assumed he had for the servant-man opened the door and backed away.</p><p>The hand pushed her forward. Evans stumbled, not expecting the sudden show of forcefulness. “Take her to her appointed rooms,” he ordered, voice barely above a whisper. The servant-man nodded, reaching out to take her wrist. The skin beneath his grip was irritated and burned, but Evans did not flinch. She considered forcing one, but that was too much, too forced of a play and too easily seen through.</p><p>She spared a glance back. Her captor, the man that was anything but a man, was gone. He had disappeared without a trace, not a pop or whistle of wind to signal his leave. There was no doubt, though, that her every move was being watched.</p><p>The servant-man did not speak to her as he dragged her through the winding hallways. The wood floors creaked beneath their steps, his swift and light, hers fumbling and awkward. An itch built in her throat — there was dust swirling about their feet, stinging her eyes and coating her tongue, but the house itself was not in terrible shape.</p><p>They stopped at a door, grooves and borders carved into mahogany, tall, dark, and unblemished. The servant-man turned to look at her — or more accurately, <em> down </em> at her. His lips were pursed much like her aunt’s when she was particularly disapproving, but his held much more distaste. Evans nearly forgot herself, where she was and <em> who </em>she was, but kept her shoulders hunched and hands balled at her sides.</p><p>“I will be your… <em> caretaker</em>,” he said, sneering the last word. “I will not fill your head with unnecessary and untrue reassurances. I do not like children, and I especially detest <em> caring </em>for them. Do you understand?” She gave him a stiff nod. This man would test her control, of that she was certain.</p><p>“There is a wash-room off to the left of your room. Use it and leave your…” his eyes roved over the tattered slip she had been forced into, “<em>clothes </em> in the basket. There are garments left for you to change into on the rack. <em> Do not </em>leave your room.”</p><p>He opened the door. Evans very nearly gaped — the room was unlike anything she had imagined, unlike anything she had ever <em> experienced</em>. The walls were of the same pattern as the hallway, but instead of being the same dull grey, these were a pale salmon.</p><p>Two windows conjoined over the head of the bed, which was no smaller than a queen, and was dressed with what could have been any number of silks or velvets. Her body ached for a real bed, one that wasn’t the chamber floors of Nurmengard or the rickety cot of her cupboard.</p><p>It made her wary, though — more so than a prison cell would have.</p><p>“And <em> you </em> may refer to <em> me </em>as Professor Snape,” the man said, shutting the door with a startling finality. He had not slammed it, but it resonated nonetheless — like the iron doors of Nurmengard, the click of the lock falling into place behind her cupboard door. No matter how prettily they dressed it up, it would always be a cage; and she, the bird.</p><p>Despite her despairing thoughts, Evans stood there for longer than she would like to admit, simply admiring the room. For a cage, it was very nice. She did, eventually, gravitate towards the door on the left (the only other door) when her mind began to catch up to her body. Not only did she reek, but her skin itched — there was grime plastered to every inch of her body and her hair was an awful, tangled mess.</p><p>The bathroom was just as magnificent as the bedroom. Panel became tile as the bathroom stretched on, and the floors were long slabs of chiselled stone — quite warm, unlike chambers and cells and winter fortresses. She padded across the floors, her feet echoing with the drip of water.</p><p>Under a high, stained glass window was a claw-foot tub. It was filled to the brim with steaming, glistening water, sprigs of rosemary, pale lavender heads, and lemon balm leaves drifting about the surface.</p><p>After checking that she was suitably alone, Evans stripped her rags. She tossed them in the basket and sidled up to the edge of the tub, dipping one finger in. The water was comfortably hot, and she was uncomfortably dirty, so throwing caution to the wind she sunk into the bath.</p><p>Rich water lapped at her skin. It swam through her questing fingers, silken and glossy; and Evans stamped down on the urge to brood on what oils or even potions had been slipped into the bath. Instead, she allowed the tenseness to ooze from her taut muscles under the gentle caress of cleansing warmth. She might have nodded off if not for the sudden tap against the window, which had her immediately awake and covering her chest.</p><p>There was snickering outside her window, and little chirping titters. Evans, against her better judgement, let her curiosity get the better of her. She sat up straight and leaned towards the window, tapping the glass.</p><p>“Is somebody there?” she whispered. Again, she heard laughter, though it was strange and warbling. The rustle of leaves or the steady drip of dew over a lake. Something or someone tapped the window again. “Who’s out there? I’m in the bath!”</p><p>“We’re fairies!” came from behind the window. “We came to greet you. Would you let us in?”</p><p>Evans’ mother had told her stories of fairies. They were beautiful creatures, with bell-like laughter and iridescent wings. They were also very vain creatures, constantly preening and coveting their beauty, but ultimately harmless.</p><p>“I suppose so,” she conceded. “But how do I open this window? There’s no latch.”</p><p>“Use your magic, silly,” came through the glass. “Or do you not know how?”</p><p>Evans reared back, exclaiming, “Of course I know how! But it’s not that easy. I’ve no wand, and witches need wands to do magic.” Her thoughts drifted elsewhere, however, to those pale hands working magic without a wand. The fairy — or so she supposed it was — harrumphed.</p><p>“Put your hand against the window and wish it to open. These are magic windows; they should work as you wish them to.” There was not much fault in that line of thought: though she could not feel the magic emanating from it per say, there was a faint aura of magic in the air and about it. Perhaps it was not so far fetched as it seemed — she had been living without magic for seven years now, after all.</p><p>Evans pressed her palm to the centre of the window, where a beam of wood ran straight down, sectioning the pane of glass into even halves. Even thinner slices of wood criss-crossed each other to split the rest into nearly square quarters. She imagined how, in another place or different time, there might have been a latch worked into the wood at this very spot. Her finger ran down the centre beam, seeing with her mind’s eye the two halves of the window opening like shutters.</p><p>The window clicked, creaked.</p><p>“It worked!” she exclaimed, enraptured by the crease of light filtering between the two panes of window. The air was cool on her face, which was still red from the waters. The fairy flew in, a rapid pulse of beating, glittering wings — along with another, and another. “There’s three of you,” she remarked. It was an obvious observation, but a surprising one nonetheless.</p><p>The fairies tittered. One flew forward, her shimmering, opalescent dress bouncing excitedly despite the delicacy of her movements. “Merry meet little witch!” she greeted, giving a little curtsy. Then, with a playful smile tugging at her lips, she said rather than asked, “Or are you?” A laugh, eyes crinkled. She swept her arm out, smiling widely. “You may call me Astoria, and these are my friends.” The other two fairies nodded in sync.</p><p>“You may call me Hestia, and my sister Flora,” said the first of the two. Their features, fair and pointed, were similar but contrasting. Hestia, though seemingly more dour than her sister, was dressed in passionate, camellia reds. Flora, fairer and more sharp, wore a dress of twilight blue. “Fairy names are difficult for the tall folk to pronounce. We only ever share our true names with our beloveds, though. Is it not the same for your kind?”</p><p>“It is; or at least it is for magicals. Muggles — humans without magic — don’t really follow those customs anymore. They’ve forgotten the power behind names.”</p><p>“Foolish creatures,” said Flora. “But never-mind them; we’re here to speak of you! Where did you come from, and why might you have come here, if we may ask?”</p><p>“Oh,” she said, surprised yet again — it was not often that others took interest in her, and when they did, it was not for small, pleasant talk. “I’m not sure where I am now, but I was living in Surrey, England before. I was taken to somewhere very cold (I think it may have been Germany) and then brought here, though I don’t know where here is or why I was brought here.”</p><p>“I believe you are still in England, little witch,” said Hestia. “We do not call these lands the same names the tall folk do, but we have heard whispers. Never before have we heard of this ‘Germany’ though that may be due to its colder climate.”</p><p>“We don’t wander far from our home,” said Flora. “It is a beautiful place, warm and rich like honey, with emerald lakes and sapphire skies, and flowers plenty — both those known and not to you.”</p><p>“Would you like to see it?” whispered Astoria, as though sharing a precious secret. She blinked her wide, blue eyes and Evans could not help but focus on the darker outer ring and glimmering centre, bright periwinkle and cerulean. With great effort she turned her head away, and did not look back again.</p><p>“I can’t,” she said. “I’m trapped here.”</p><p>“That’s not true,” said Astoria. “You opened that window, even though you should not have been able to. You can leave if you so wish.”</p><p>She swung her head around to meet the fairy’s eyes again, ignoring all instincts begging her otherwise. “What do you mean, I shouldn’t have been able to?” she asked. “You said that —” the fairy put her hands over her mouth, coy yet delighted.</p><p>“I told you that so you would think you could do it. If I had told you otherwise, would you have had the confidence you did to open it? No,” she answered for her, “and that made all the difference. Magic depends on how much you believe, and you believed the window would open — so it did!”</p><p>“But that’s…” Her brow furrowed. Her parents had taught her differently, but who was she to disagree with evidence placed right before her? Perhaps they had planned to teach her, would have taught her, had they not —</p><p>“We must go now,” said Flora, tugging on her sister’s dress. Hestia nodded, looking to Astoria.</p><p>“If you would like to see our home, little witch, then meet us on the outskirts of the forest after moon-rise,” she told her. Evans nodded. She could escape, and perhaps be rid of cages all together, forever. “Merry part!” chorused the fairies as they took off. She closed the window behind them, it clicking shut and appearance returning to that of a solid wooden beam.</p><p>Eventually her fingers began to prune and the water cool. She stood up, letting the water run of her body in rivulets as she wrung out her hair. There was a towel by the bath she had not noticed before, and she began to dry off with it.</p><p>Just as the man, Snape, had promised, there were clothes hanging from the rack. Evans grimaced, taking in the dress with distaste. It was a royal blue, like the morning glories that grew along her mother’s trellis. It had a dark green sache going around the waist, ending in a bow at the back.</p><p>She pulled it on, knowing she had no other clothes to wear. It fit well enough, if a tad too loosely. The fabric was soft and not at all revealing. She shrugged on the matching green bodice, which was more of a waistcoat than anything. Out of the inner pocket, something slipped out and fell to the floor.</p><p>It landed with a metallic clunk. Evans bent down to pick it up, turning it over in her palm. It was a silver locket, with an <em>S</em> emblazoned on the front by tiny emeralds. No matter how she tried, she could not get it to open — not even when she plied her chipped fingernails between the silver faces and pulled with all her strength. Evans returned it to the inner pocket of her waistcoat, certain that it had not been meant for her, and would sooner break than open.</p><p>Upon entering her room, all thoughts of the locket vanished in the face of food. There was a tray set out, one with steaming rolls and a bowl of thick, richly smelling soup. The scent of broiled meat and greens wafted towards her, guiding her feet to it. Next to the food there was a goblet of pumpkin juice (it had been so long since she had last had it) and a folded napkin.</p><p>She did not dare eat without first checking it, despite how her stomach protested. Though she had no immediate way of inspecting it for tampering, she went through the motions of smelling and tasting small bits, rolling them over her tongue, waiting for a sign of something amiss.</p><p>There were no strange odours or misplaced tastes — not even a trace of magic lingering about the feast. The jagged-sharp pains in her stomach finally became too much, and Evans caved, snatching up a dinner roll and downing it in two bites. She lifted the soup bowl to her mouth and gulped the broth, nearly choking in her hastiness. Manners be damned, she was starving.</p><p>She realized she may have been a bit too vigorous with her food when her stomach began flip and clench painfully. Slowly, she drank from her goblet and allowed her stomach to settle. Crumbs and broth were wiped from her mouth and her dress brushed off.</p><p>What could have been an hour or six passed, when she finally gave into her restlessness. No one had come for her yet, and she was beginning to wonder whether they wanted her to come to them. The infuriating man, Snape, had told her to stay in her room, but what else was she to do?</p><p>Evans knew how to sneak around without getting caught. She had needed to, when she stayed with her relatives. They were a nasty bunch, and after the first few times being caught sneaking food, she had learned to avoid discovery at all costs.</p><p>The door was unlocked. Or perhaps she had unlocked it without knowing, like she had with the window. It was better off that she did not ponder on it too long, lest she give herself a headache; the door was open and that was all that mattered. Evans looked in one direction then the other, and not seeing anyone, took one step forward and shut the door behind her.</p><p>When Snape had lead her to her room, she had been secretly memorizing which floorboards creaked. He had probably thought she had been stepping on them on purpose to annoy him, which was not wrong, but she had had ulterior motives in mind at the time. She had done this at the Dursley’s, and by now it was an ingrained practice.</p><p>The entrance hall came into view, and Evans stiffened, hastily scrambling to hide behind the wall. A hypnotic, menacing, very noticeably sibilant muttering filled the room — soft but <em> there, </em>so very there that it settled in the pit of her stomach and twisted like an agitated snake.</p><p>Peering around the edge, her hair kept pulled back and head behind the cover of an antique vase, Evans scanned the room. Across from her, near the opening of an opposite hallway, a distinctly feminine figure passed by. Her footsteps were silent, covered completely by the trailing, seemingly unending train of her dress.</p><p>There was something off about the figure that left Evans feeling antsy, almost religiously casting her eye over her again and again. There was nothing to discern from her appearance except that she dressed with the elegance and overly lavish nature of a cultured, pureblooded heiress. But even this was put to question, for Evans’ father had preferred common wear to dress robes, and perhaps this woman — this unknown, mysterious, unquestionably dangerous figure — simply mirrored the opposite taste.</p><p>As though her single minded focus upon the other had somehow become a physical presence in the room, the figure stopped, head perking up. Evans’ breath stilled in her chest, tasting of stale dust and bitter fear.</p><p>From behind the other’s curtain of hair, pale white bangs shrouding her face and features, a string of hisses began to issue — long and breathy, a hypnotic charm laced between their endless syllables. And when her head turned towards where she hid, the curtain of hair not parting or shifting, Evans did not dare move.</p><p>Her eyes were screwed shut, refusing to open. It was dark. <em> The iron door slammed shut. </em></p><p>The hissing faded into a distant echo. Evans found herself crouched low, eyes plastered shut and heart hammering in her chest, completely and utterly alone. Silence hung about her like a guillotine above her head. The room came into focus, and there was no sign of the pale-haired figure, not a glimmer of a glimpse, not a whisper of a hiss.</p><p>Evans bolted for the door on shaky legs, jiggling the doorknob. It chinked raucously, the clatter of metal against metal, and gave resistance with each of her desperate twists. Not even when she prayed, begged, pleaded with it to open, it refused to comply. Evans gave breathy curse, sweat beading beneath her palms, across her brow. Footsteps sounded from the corridor she left, and without much thought she scurried for escape.</p><p>The other hallway was out of consideration — she did not want to tempt fate twice. There was no way she could leave the same way she came, for she would run into whoever was walking down it. The footsteps were growing closer, and she prepared herself for being caught.</p><p>It was then she noticed it: a wardrobe nestled between two side tables. She could fit in it if she squeezed, and desperation outweighed hesitancy. Evans threw open the wardrobe, pushed the hanging coat to the side, and scrambled in. Her blunted fingernails scraped against the doors, unable to find purchase against the flat wood, trying and failing to seal the crack between them.</p><p>She hissed when a splinter burrowed beneath her nail, and swore she could see those black eyes flicker to her. The doors were shut, and dust was burning her eyes, but she kept as quiet as possible. Through the crack of the wardrobe, she could see a speck of black gliding across hardwood floors. It stopped, her heart stopped, he stopped — and then she heard it: sniffing.</p><p>“Lavender,” hissed Snape, far too sibilant, far too near. Panic rose in her chest, beating like a sledgehammer against her ribs, the echo of an iron door, the latch of a lock falling into place. The walls were closing in on her, heart roaring in her ears, everything but his voice drowned out. “…Rosemary. Lemon balm,” he listed, her heart skipping a beat with each racing thought, his keen, intelligent mind certainly already aware.</p><p>Evans swallowed the scream in her throat, the bile on her tongue.</p><p>Snape wrenched open the wardrobe doors, the skin around his eyes pulled taut with suspicion. There was a coat hanging from the rack, some dust wafting down from the ceiling, and nothing else. “I was certain…” he muttered, closing the wardrobe and twisting on his heel.</p><p>A collection of inhales and exhales became clogged in her throat, clawing with red-hot nails against the inside of her lungs, the backs of her eyes. Evans desperately tried to swallow the air, caked with dust and dirt and must, but found it slipping just out of reach. Her heart was hammering, stuttering, shrill screams rising in her ears —</p><p>It was too small, too tight, there was no room to move, to breathe, her lungs were collapsing and she was falling and everything was too dark, too painful, too <em> cold… </em></p><p>She coughed, spluttered, spat out a glob of dirt and dust. Her lungs ceased their burning, and the cold retreated, and Evans wiped the grime from her dress. She had leaned back, pressed her weight against the wooden back of the wardrobe, and it had given way. She silently thanked her luck, for only her luck could grant her a timely escape by false backings in wardrobes and tumbles through secret tunnels.</p><p>Though she was likely in the basement, there was not much difference in the ceiling here from the main floor. Her father would have thought it ingenious craftsmanship, knowing him.</p><p>A single ray of light pierced the darkness, dust particles dancing in a draft, and Evans fumbled her way to it. Pushing on a slanted panel of wood, it opened easily enough, leading out into what was presumably the backyard. She clambered out of the cellar, shutting the doors behind her (the lock had broken with age, it seemed).</p><p>What had seemed to be sunlight, though, was in fact fairy light.</p><p>“There you are!” said Astoria. “I was starting to think you wouldn’t show. Oh, you’re so dirty. Allow me,” she said, putting her hands on Evans’ dress. The muck that had accumulated from hiding in the wardrobe and falling into the cellar vanished.</p><p>“Oh, er, thank you,” she said, a tad roughly. The fairies tittered, taking her hand.</p><p>“This way,” they said, leading her towards the forest. The lights began to appear in abundance, an atmosphere of faint, tinkling shimmers. Twigs crunched beneath her feet. Her toenails were stained black by the dirt, and her soles red from the numerous scrapes and barbs digging into her feet.</p><p>“Not much farther now,” Astoria assured, guiding her through a thick patch of bramble. Drowsiness was starting to blanket her, a soft, honeyed drizzle of tranquillity. She could still hear the fairies, chirruping and laughing like bells on the wind. It was nice, it was…</p><p>“Already trying to escape are you, Harry?”</p><p>She spun around so fast it was almost as if she had never been tired at all. “Don’t you <em> dare </em>call me that!” she screamed, fists clenching. The fairies scattered. “What do you want from me?”</p><p>The cloaked figure glided closer. “You have power within you,” he said, voice whisper-soft. His adoring tone caressed her skin, sending shivers down her spine. It was disgusting. “Promise… The capability to become great.”</p><p>“And?” she said. “Was that your plan? To get rid of me before I can become a threat to you?”</p><p>He began to laugh, his head tilted back. The cloak hood fell, revealing his face in all its horrific glory: pale, chalky skin, two slits for a nose, and a bald, scale scattered head. Evans grimaced, fighting off the urge to spit insults at his disfigured face. She was no longer a Potter.</p><p>“Get rid of you? No, I have much better plans than that. You have potential… but it’s raw as of yet. Yes… with the right guiding, you could be great. And under my tutelage, you will be better than great: you will become <em> unstoppable. </em> Don’t you see?”</p><p>“All I can see is that you’re raving mad,” she bit out, taking step back, a branch crunching underfoot. Strangely though, she did not feel it — had her foot gone numb from blood loss? No, she could feel the earth, the earth which had cracked.</p><p>Evans screamed, her world tilting, the tree canopies and the stars and the moon all entering her vision faster than she could comprehend. Something smoother than silk and <em> familiar </em> wrapped around her waist, on the tip of her tongue but <em> what was it? </em></p><p>“You should be more careful, Harry,” said the monster, his face startlingly close. “Lord Voldemort has plans for you, and as all endeavours I take under, they shall succeed.” A hand caressed her cheek, fingernails running teasingly over her flesh. “Don’t you wish to be great? To be powerful, feel magic coursing through you? To never feel weak or helpless again?</p><p>“I can teach you to guide magic with your touch, your very breath… Lord Voldemort can show you how to bend the world to your whims, to <em> speak </em> to magic. Magic is a gift, and it’s dying, <em> can you hear it? </em>”</p><p>Her lungs remained still, refusing to gasp for air. She could hear it, between the rustle of the leaves and the brush of the wind. The animals, if there ever were any, were silent. Beyond the silence, beyond the forest and the night and the world, she could hear the song of magic: sombre and lamenting.</p><p><em> Don’t trust him, </em> Harry whispered. <em> You know who he is. What he is. </em></p><p>“What are you getting at?” she said, the binds that saved her now tightening imperceptibly. Voldemort studied her face, eyes red like the blood he has spilt.</p><p>“Is it not obvious? I wish to teach you… make you my student, my apprentice. We could be great…”</p><p>Evans sneered, the steady crackle of her courage roaring to life. This man, monster, devil — he was the very thing she despised. “We could be great, and then what? I know who you are, <em> Voldemort, </em>and I know your agenda. You’re a liar and a manipulator — you want me as a weapon and nothing more!”</p><p>“Oh?” he whispered darkly. “Perhaps I can convince you yet. What do you know of my wants, my desires, truly?” He leaned in closer. “I crave war, blood on my hands, terror in the eyes of all who know of me? To rule over this world and all who live in it?”</p><p>Her heart was going to beat right out of her chest —</p><p>“Or do I want revolutionize this world? See it remade from the ground up, revive magic and spread the knowledge of power, true power — no good or evil — is that what I want? Because I think it is. I think it is my goal above all else.”</p><p>
  <em> “His goal, Harry, is not to save anyone but himself. He fears death, and will go to great lengths to avoid it. Pretty words and promises do not make a man; it is his actions and choices that do. Don’t let him fool you, my flower —” </em>
</p><p>He spun words like a spider did webs — intricately, beautifully, deadly. She was more stubborn than most though, Evans or Harry, it did not matter which, because she followed her morals, and her morals only. What he offered her was tempting to say the least, but it was too good to be true.</p><p>She spat in his face.</p><p>“Do you think I’m a fool?” she snarled. “I don’t believe a word you’re saying. You can’t make me cooperate so you’re better off killing me now. I won’t fall for your traps, Voldemort, nor will I ever!”</p><p>His eyes darkened, face twisting like some hideous caricature of an ivory statue, cracked and misshapen. Evans feared that rather than kill her he would instead leave her to live, only to be tortured to insanity and back.</p><p>“You are beyond foolish,” he said. “But you will learn with time… They all do, and you, Harry, you’re too important to let go.” His mouth curved into a facsimile of a smile. “I’ll enjoy breaking that spirit of yours,” he said, leaning back.</p><p>“Monster!” she screamed, snapping her teeth at him.</p><p>“How very much like an animal,” he said, almost as though he were inspecting a particularly intriguing creature. “Severus must have his hands full with you. Not that I care; he could be taken down a peg or two. Will you stop that or do I have to make you?” Evans attempted to swing her leg at him one last time, though the binds refused to let her, then stilled. Exhaustion was settling over her, swift and unkind. But she had gotten so far; it would be a waste to end this now.</p><p>“I’ll never let you <em> use </em> me —!” cage me like an animal, work me like a slave, take away <em> my name, who I am, </em>“— do you hear me?”</p><p>“Of course I hear you, blasted girl,” he said, backing away. “I’m sure Severus can hear you and everyone beyond that — but you <em> will </em>be my apprentice, my most prodigious student. You will rise above the others, beyond anyone that’s come before you.”</p><p>How could he continue to praise her after all this time? Was it part of his manipulations? She had never been astute at differentiating lies from truth, and he had convinced greater men than her with his silver tongue. Should she treat everything he said as a lie, or take his words at face value?</p><p>
  <em> Pretty words and promises do not make a man; it is his actions and choices that do. </em>
</p><p>It was then she made a decision — one Harry might not ever have entertained, and yet it was one Evans, the girl who lived in this moment, the girl who survived and conquered, found to be her only choice.</p><p>“... I will give you one chance,” she told him, watching his expression carefully. <em> It’s a mask, </em>whispered Harry, but Evans ignored her. A chance, she thought, “To prove yourself to me. I will let you… teach me, and will treat you as though I never knew you before today.”</p><p>“A blank slate?” he said, smiling nastily. “Lord Voldemort can work with that.”</p><p>“But,” she interjected, pleased to see the smile be wiped off his smug face. “If I am… unimpressed, so to say, with whom I come to know and learn under, then I will stop cooperating.” Evans studied his face: his expression was blank, but his eyes were alive — she could see him going through numerous decisions in his mind.</p><p>“Fine,” he agreed. “You will begin tomorrow under Severus’ tutelage —” she squawked in indignation “— learning herblore, potions, and healing. You promised to cooperate, and you best keep to your word.” He levelled her with a bland stare. “And do try not to run off again. The fae will lead you into their realm, where you’ll be trapped for the rest of eternity.”</p><p>Evans swallowed.</p><p>“Now return to your room before I decide you’re more trouble than you’re worth.”</p><p>
  <em> Don’t let him fool you, my flower — </em>
