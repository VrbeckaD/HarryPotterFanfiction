    <p> </p>
<p>Dominic Toretto and Brian O' Conner pushed their way through the crowd that was leaving the disreputable warehouse that was in deep down L.A., most referred to it as the L.A Hell District. It was a creepy run down area where the more illegal dealings happened. Tonight the warehouse held a fighting event, where opponents take turns beating on one another till only one man is left standing, and that man then takes home a large amount of cash. An underground fight club was neither man's typical scene, but it was a quiet night for street racing and Dom's sister, and Brian's Mrs, Mia had kicked them out of the house in a huff. Being six months pregnant had not only shortened her temper, but also her tolerance for any type of gear head speak. Neither man was afraid of much, they had been through countless death defying situations and never thought twice. Facing down angry mob bosses, being minutes away from being blown up, running from the law, and jumping from numerous things onto a speeding car was nothing in comparison to a pregnant furious Toretto woman. After the two walked out of the house (read ran) they drove around a bit, until they came upon a huge crowd leading underground. With nothing better to do they decided to follow the group, and ended up paying to see a bunch grown men beat the crap out of each other.</p>
<p>"Can't believe the small kid took it, he was just barley scraping by in his first fights," Brian commented as they walked to the car.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Dom grunted. "He was smart, sand bagging it until the end, no one thought of him as a real competitor."</p>
<p>Both men stopped after hearing the sounds of a fight happening in the alley they were passing by. Brian crept closer with Dom right behind him to get a better look at what was happening. A group of five huge guys where attacking a smaller man. One of the men was holding the smaller one down while the rest kicked and punched him. Dom and Brian were just about to step in when they saw the group stop. They decided to hang back, and only get involved if they were absolutely needed. The last thing either man wanted was to bring down some heat on their new peaceful life.</p>
<p>The biggest man in the group bent down and removed something from the beaten man's shirt pocket. "Not so tough now are you, you little bitch? I'll be taking this money, and don't let me see you around here again." The smaller man just laid on the ground, he was so still that Brian was unsure if he was conscious or even alive at that point. He was truly looked like a broken man, who had no fight left in him. He didn't even twitch when all five men spat on him before they turned and started heading towards their cars. Just when they were almost there the leader called out to one of his men, "oh take his bike too."</p>
<p>Neither Dom nor Brian had noticed the pitch black Victory Gunner parked behind the man sitting in the shadows, until they saw the thug walk in its direction. He wasn't anywhere near the bike before the small man stood back up, he had blood pouring down his face, and you could tell by the way he stood that one of his legs was badly damaged. His breathing was shallow, and Dom was pretty sure some of his ribs were broken by the way his hand hovered over them. However none of the pain that the guys were sure that he was feeling showed when he put himself into a fight stance and said, "you’re not taking my bike." When the two racers saw the group of thugs walk back towards the battered man, they decided enough was enough. The ran towards the group, and gave them the fight of their lives, it did surprise both of them to see the small guy not only still standing, but fighting with them. It wasn't long before all five men had enough and were running back to their cars to escape from the two guys who appeared from nowhere. Once they were gone the injured man fell on his knees in exhaustion and pain.</p>
<p>"Thanks," he rasped.</p>
<p>Dom and Brian walked over to the fallen guy, and got a good look at him for the first time. They couldn't see many distinct features thanks to the lack of light and the blood that stained the guys face, but the black hair and green eyes were enough for both men to know who kneeled before them.</p>
<p>Brian looked over at Dom and nodded in agreement. "You’re the kid who just won the fight in there aren't you?"</p>
<p>The green eyed man scowled, "I'm not a kid I'm 26, but yes I did win, just for those bastards to come and take my money." He said with a British accent.</p>
<p>Dom chuckled, "you’re a feisty one aren't you?"</p>
<p>The fighter looked up at Dom with a smart ass reply on the tip of his tongue, but it died as soon as he caught sight of the man. He had an intimidating, but rather good looking appearance, and it caught the smaller of the three men off guard. To make up for his momentarily lapse in speech the young man shook his head and grabbed his ribs. "I would give a smartarse reply to that, but the loss of blood must be affecting my brain."</p>
<p>"You should get to a hospital," Brian said matter of factly.</p>
<p>It was his turn to chuckle now. "That will not be happening, hospitals cost money, and just in case you missed my earlier statement those bastards took off with any money I had. I am also not the kind of free man that can go wondering into a hospital if you know what I mean." Dom and Brian looked at each other they knew all too well what he meant. "I'm fine anyways been in worse scrapes than this, and pulled through. I do thank you for the help however in running them off, money can be made, but that bike cannot be replaced."</p>
<p>"Sure bro," Brian said while looking skeptical about the young man being as fine as what he said he was. "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter, and you are?"</p>
<p>"I'm Brian O' Conner and this Dominic Toretto." Brian answered.</p>
<p>"Sounds familiar," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Yeah well we have had our fair share of new's coverage," grumbled Dom.</p>
<p>Harry stood up and hobbled his way over towards his bike, but collapsed before he got there. Both men helped Harry up and walked him over to the wall where they could sit him down.</p>
<p>"If you won't let us take you to a hospital at least let us drop you off with family," Brian said with concern lacing his voice. He didn't know what it was about this guy, but he felt the same brotherly connection that he had with Dom towards him.</p>
<p>Harry stared straight in front of him and answered, "Can't…I don't have one."</p>
<p>Dom winced at the cold tone and asked, "Friends?"</p>
<p>Harry laughed bitterly, "None of those either."</p>
<p>Brian couldn't help but start to feel pity for the man sitting against the wall. "How about we just take you to your home then." Both Brian and Dominic's stomachs dropped when they heard Harry laugh hysterically in an empty way.</p>
<p>"Ouch," he gasped out while grabbing his ribs, "hurts to laugh." He wiped at the blood on his face and looked straight at Brian. "You think someone with a family, friends, and a home would be here getting the shit beat out them to make a few bucks?" Brian saw Dom tense as he crossed his arms. "Look I really am fine, was planning on sleeping here tonight anyways."</p>
<p>Brian had opened his mouth to argue that the man was too injured to stay in a dark alley alone, but Dom beat him to it. "No, Brian go get the car, you'll come with us."</p>
<p>Harry was going to say it wasn't necessary, but one look at the man named Dominic, and he knew arguing would get him nowhere. "I'm not leaving my bike," he said a bit petulantly instead.</p>
<p>Dom kneeled down and looked Harry in the eyes. "I’ll drive it back to my place, I promise I'll take care of it, I know it's important to you."</p>
<p>Harry gave a jerky nod as Brian pulled up in a Chevrolet Chevelle SS. Brian and Dom both carefully loaded Harry into the front seat and took off. It wasn't far, but Brian could tell the car ride was excruciating for Harry. When they pulled up in the drive Dom got off the Gunner and made his way to help Brian maneuver Harry into the house. The whole team was staring in shock as they brought the injured man inside. Harry body was starting to give out from pain, and Dom and Brian had to practically carry him to the couch. Not that it was a huge effort, the man was extremely light for his age, Dom attributed it to street living.</p>
<p>Mia had already left the room and returned with the first aid kit, by the time Harry was sitting on the couch. Everyone on the team just continued to watch the event unfold they knew there was a time and place for questions, and now was not the time. Not when there was a man who looked like someone had tried to beat him to death on the verge of passing out on the couch.</p>
<p>Harry tried to speak to Dom about something, but sleep was trying to pull him under and it was all just a mess of slurred words that couldn't be understood. Dom bent down and whispered gently to Harry that everything was going to be okay that he should sleep to escape the pain. It was more gentle then any of the team thought he could be.</p>
<p>Dom's whispering seemed to be doing the trick, and Harry eyes were drooping shut until, one of the team members who was in the garage at the time of the three men's arrival walked into the room and took notice of the man on the couch.</p>
<p>"Harry??!!" Was echoed throughout the living room.</p>
<p>Harry lifted his head just enough to look at the person screaming his name, "oh hey Han," he said before passing out.</p>
