    <p>On the way to the main room, Draco heard awful sounds. He didn’t know what exactly he was about to walk into, but found himself privy to the sight of some of the more note-worthy snatchers dragging two young wizards into the hall. Having slammed them down onto the pristine marble floor (or it was at least once pristine, now blood-caked and marred by dark magic), the two young wizards writhed in discomfort. With plenty of wands drawn and pointed at the pair, they dare not move.</p><p>Upon entering, there was a commotion, Bellatrix approaching the pair and beginning to question them.</p><p>“Who are you, witch?” Bellatrix hissed toward the bushy-haired figured whom Draco recognized immediately.</p><p>“I think she’s the mudblood, that Hermione Granger, Miss.” One of the snatchers offered.</p><p>She laughed, an awful sound shattering nearby constitutions. The pair on the floor winced, as Bellatrix came closer, glaring down at the witch. “Are you sure…” She whispered, using her crooked wand to inspect closer.</p><p>“My name is Hannah Abbot!” Hermione bellowed, making Bellatrix take a step back. Her eyes shot to Draco.</p><p>“Nephew, come here, tell me who these two are. They are students, surely.”</p><p>One of the two was a loathsome looking fellow, with half-bloated features and an obviously faulty disfiguration glamour gone wrong. Upon approaching, Draco noticed immediately that it was Harry Potter, and his heart thumped loudly in his ears. His eyes darted to the witch, who was quite apparently a very fearful Hermione Granger. Without much time to think, he shook his head.</p><p>“No… This isn’t either of them… He doesn’t even have a scar on his face, and I don’t know her.” He insisted, shaking his head. Bellatrix suddenly shoved him closer to the witch’s face, nearly slamming their foreheads together.</p><p>“Are you <em>certain</em>?” She hissed into his ear, making him shiver in disgust at the sound.</p><p>Hermione’s stoic eyes began to faulter, especially at this proximity. His stark grey eyes were much more fear-filled than hers, though. With a swallow, he slowly shook his head once more, as if attempting to impress upon Hermione something urgent. “No. I do not know them.” He insists, nostrils flaring in his attempt to lie.</p><p>Hermione’s maintained contact with his eye, and there was a very real moment of connection when she understood what he was saying. She turned away from him, feigning a bit of a sob. “Just let us go!” Hermione cried out.</p><p>Bellatrix relinquished her grip on her nephew’s collar, and he retreated from the scene.</p><p>They were on their own, he had done his part, right? He could just step back and watch the events unfold. He could already see the glamour spells beginning to falter, and it wasn’t long before Hermione’s hair was beginning to return to normal brown, her freckles reappearing along the bridge of her nose.</p><p>What was worse, is Harry’s scar was growing redder as it reappeared.</p><p>Acting quickly, Draco made his way to the kitchen, harshly whispering a summons for a house elf.</p>
