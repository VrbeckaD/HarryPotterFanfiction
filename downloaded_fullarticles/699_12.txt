    <p>*March- 5th Year*</p>
<p>Hermione never thought that Draco Malfoy would be a smoker, yet here he was, standing at the base of Ravenclaw tower with a cancer stick between his lips. She approached him and gave him a warning, deciding to be lenient today. She didn’t feel like picking a fight and getting in trouble with the inquisition squad.</p>
<p>For once Draco didn’t sneer, he only smirked as the cig hung out of his mouth, he took an inhale, and then pulled it from his lips. “Oh, come off it, Granger. I just had a wonderful shag. Let me enjoy this one fag and then I’ll go inside. It’s not like the pink toad would give me detention anyway. She has a creepy obsession with me.”</p>
<p>Hermione must have had an obviously surprised look on her face because Draco actually laughed as he took another hit off his cigarette.</p>
<p>“What? Do you think I like dedicating ALL my free time to busting other students? I had other interests, like chasing all the pretty birds around the castle, reading big books, and doing homework. But nope, now I only have time for homework and inquisition squad. No more books, and this was the first time in months I had enough time to catch one of you pretty birds. Let me have my moment.” Draco mused, taking another drag.</p>
<p>Hermione felt her jaw drop. She was having a conversation with Draco that didn’t involve full blown insults, he essentially just called her pretty, and he just admitted that he didn’t like Umbridge. </p>
<p>“You want one Granger? You look like you could use a stress reliever?” Draco said, holding the pack out to her. “Running around with Potty all day, doing whatever the hell you idiots are doing, must be frustrating.”</p>
<p>Hermione stared at it for a second, then shook her head, “No thank you. If I went home with a smoking habit, I’d never hear the end of it. My parents are dentists, they fix people's teeth. Smokers almost always have the worst teeth and the worst breath. I hear about it all the time.”</p>
<p>Draco chuckled and put the pack away, “Wow, muggles are weird. A job where you fix teeth. Then again, they can’t make their problems go away with a flick of a wand. Well Granger, this has been a lovely chat, don’t tell anyone about it, and if you ever change your mind and need a cigarette, just come and find me. I’ll be nice to you.”</p>
<p>He tossed the but on the ground and smashed it with his foot. Hermione rolled her eyes, a smile playing on her lips, “You better not leave that there Malfoy. I’ll report you to McGonagall with the charge of littering.”</p>
<p>Draco laughed and picked up the butt, “Sure you will Granger. See you around.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*November 6th-Year*</p>
<p>Hermione was stressed, and she had no clue what to do. Harry was obsessed with the fucking potions book, Ron was obsessed with Lavender, and Ginny had homework. </p>
<p>Hermione felt completely and utterly alone. She hadn’t realized how dependent she was on her friends for her social life, that now when them off doing their own things, she had no one.</p>
<p>She checked the clock and saw that it was 1 am.</p>
<p>She stared at the wall and thought back over the last year, trying to find something she could do to destress. Her homework was done, her head hurt from staring at the words in a book, the prophet made her sad, and she just wanted a distraction.</p>
<p>For some reason her mind drifted to Malfoy and that cigarette that he offered her all those months ago. Now that she was thinking about it, he was looking worse for wear this year. Paler than normal.</p>
<p>And now that she was thinking about it, she really could use that cigarette, bad teeth be damned, she had magic now!</p>
<p>“Dobby!” she said to the empty common room.</p>
<p>The elf popped into the room with a loud crack. He was wearing mismatched socks and two hats on each of his ears, “Yes Miss Granger?”</p>
<p>“This is the weirdest question I will ever ask you, and you can’t tell Harry, just because he’ll commit me, but will you go see if Malfoy is awake? And if he is, tell him that I want to take him up on that cigarette.”</p>
<p>Dobby looked a bit surprised, “Okay Miss. I’ll do that. I think he is awake right now, he usually goes to bed at 3 on Friday nights. Has been that way for years. I’ll be back.”</p>
<p>Dobby disappeared with a pop and Hermione found herself staring at the wall for another five minutes until Dobby popped back into the room.</p>
<p>“Master Malfoy says that he is surprised that you are taking him up on a cigarette, but he said to meet him by the Ravenclaw Tower, like last time. Miss Granger, please be careful. Master Malfoy, he is going through a lot, and while he needs understanding, that does not mean he needs pardoning. Just, please be careful.” Dobby replied, wringing his hands.</p>
<p>Hermione smiled as she stood up, “I’ll be fine Dobby. I’ve hit him before, and I’ll hit him again if I have to.”</p>
<p>Dobby forced a smile and disappeared. </p>
<p>Hermione grabbed her coat and hat and ducked out of the portrait. The fat lady called out to her, “Where are the other two of your trio?”</p>
<p>“I’m on a solo trip tonight.”</p>
<p>The fat lady didn’t respond as Hermione scurried down the hall, listening for any teachers. She wasn’t on rounds tonight, and she didn’t want to explain herself, by herself. If her two bumbling fools were with her, then they would just have to drop the Voldemort card.</p>
<p>Not this time.</p>
<p>Hermione made her way out of the castle quickly and without incident. She made her way over to Ravenclaw tower and found Malfoy already standing there with a cigarette lit.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, Mr. Malfoy, very unbecoming of a prefect.” She teased, moving to stand next to him. </p>
<p>He handed her his pack and didn’t reply until she had a cigarette in her mouth and forgot that she was a witch.</p>
<p>“No lighter?” she asked.</p>
<p>Malfoy looked at her like she was dumb, “Granger, you’re a witch. Lighters are for muggles who don’t carry a pointy stick that channels magic.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s face turned ready as she took out her wand and lit the end of her cigarette. Malfoy laughed. Hermione took a drag and coughed. Malfoy laughed harder.</p>
<p>“First cigarette?” He asked.</p>
<p>Hermione nodded, “Yeah. But I’ve got nobody to talk to, and smoking is a socially acceptable way of dealing with stress.”</p>
<p>“Nobody to talk to? What about Potty the Boy Wonder and his cohort the Weasel, and his sister, the Weaslette?” Malfoy asked as he took a drag.</p>
<p>Hermione took a drag and watched the cigarette burn, “Well, Won-Won is obsessed with Lav-Lav, it’s disgusting. I can’t stand to be in the room with them. I feel like he’s being overly obsessed with her to get back at me for something, but I don’t know what that something is. And Harry is lost in his own little world of bullshitting his way through potions and stalking your boss Voldemort. And stalking you for that matter. Keep your eye on him for me. Harry’s not in a good place with Sirius dying and everything. As for Ginny, her and Harry having something going on I think? Either way, she has homework due. Why am I telling you this?”</p>
<p>Malfoy laughed, “Because you’re overly stressed and out of your comfort zone. For the first time, you are not needed by either of them, and it’s throwing you off your game. Why you sought me out, I don’t know. Why didn’t you go to Cormic or Anthony? Or hell, Blaise?”</p>
<p>She chuckled and took another drag, smoking was getting easier, “Why do you think Cormic sucked so bad at his try outs? He annoys me, so I might have interfered. As for Anthony, we’re not compatible, at all. People always want to put smart people together, so we leave everyone else alone, and the majority of the time, smart people just get on each other’s nerves and fight.”</p>
<p>“Hey! I get better marks than Goldstein, and you and I get on each other’s nerves for other reasons. Otherwise, I long to have an intelligent conversation.” Malfoy teased.</p>
<p>Hermione chuckled and took another drag, exhaling slowly and watching the smoke disperse into the air, “Yeah. How are things going for you and Lord Voldy?”</p>
<p>Malfoy groaned, “Well, you gave me your life story, might as well give you mine. He’s currently playing tea party at my house. I’m dreading Christmas and am hoping I catch something awful and am stuck in the infirmary for the entire break. I don’t want to face him.”</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, “Does this have to do with the mission that Harry keeps rambling about? He claims that you’ve been tasked with something.”</p>
<p>Malfoy took a drag and stared up at the stars, “I refuse to incriminate myself Granger, but yes. I’ve been given an impossible task, and the Dark Lord has set me up to fail. I don’t find this cause worthy of my time, and I don’t believe it, but there is no way out.”</p>
<p>“There’s always a way out. Just talk to Dumbledore. He’ll gladly put you in hiding.”</p>
<p>Malfoy chuckled, “It’s not that easy. The Dark Lord is holding my mother hostage. He has already threatened to kill her if I leave. My father, I’m indifferent to, he’s the one who got us into this mess. My mother is the last person that I care about in this world.”</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t realize what she was doing until her hand was on his left forearm and pushing up his coat sleeve to look at his dark mark.</p>
<p>Malfoy grunted but allowed it.</p>
<p>“So, Harry is right?” She said softly, her fingers delicately tracing the mark.</p>
<p>“Yep. Good Ole Potty is right. I’m the real bad guy this year.” Malfoy replied. He took out a new cigarette and lit it with the old one, before tossing that one to the ground and stomping it out.</p>
<p>She removed her hand from his arm and Malfoy pulled his sleeve back down. Hermione took another drag of her cigarette and looked at him.</p>
<p>“What caused the change? When did you stop believing in the cause?”</p>
<p>“When he killed Diggory the pure blood. I started getting disenchanted. My father had for years, bragged about killing the unworthy blood traitors and mudbloods, but the cause killed a pure blood, and I realized that this probably was not about blood purity and it was more about power. And then I saw how you were treated last year, and I saw those torturous punishments you underwent. Your hand was bleeding, and I saw how your blood was as red as mine, it wasn’t dirty.” Malfoy grabbed her hand and rubbed his thumb across the “I Will Not Be An Insufferable Know-It-All,” scar that she got from doing lines. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I got tripped up on power at one-point last year, and then I came crashing down. I hated working for her, but I liked the power the inquisition squad gave. I’m so sorry. I’m between a rock and a hard place, and I’m so fucking terrified. Whatever move I make, somebody is going to get hurt. At this point, I’m just trying to survive.”</p>
<p>She dropped her cigarette to the ground and with her now free hand, and cupped his face, feeling his angular jawline. “Draco,” she said softly.</p>
<p>He forced a chuckle, “You’re not going to slap me again, are you?”</p>
<p>Hermione rubbed her thumb against his jaw. Draco leaned into her touch and brought the hand that he was holding to his lips, and kissed her scar. </p>
<p>The next few seconds were a blur. Hermione found herself smashing her lips against Draco’s and him responding. He turned her, so she was pressed against the castle wall, and Draco’s hands were resting under her bottom, holding her off the ground against the wall.</p>
<p>Hermione’s fingers went through his silky hair, and Draco’s fingers tangled themselves in her semi-tamed mane of curls.</p>
<p>She tasted like vanilla and he tasted like peppermint and cigarettes. It wasn’t a bad taste in her opinion. </p>
<p>A few seconds later, they pulled away at the same time. Draco guided her to the ground before removing his hands from her form. She felt cold without him holding her, and Draco felt empty without her in his arms.</p>
<p>“Um, should we talk about that?” I said softly.</p>
<p>Draco looked down at his discarded, still lit cigarette. He crushed it with his foot, “Yes. We shouldn’t do that again, and we should mention it to anyone. Fuck, that is going to be hard to hide from the Dark Lord. He’s really good at occlumency. Fuck, I want to kiss you again though.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, “What?”</p>
<p>Draco snorted, “You’re beautiful, Granger. Yeah, you were a bucktooth freak when we were younger, but I was a slicked hair shit head. I was an asshole to you, I’ve always been an asshole to you, but you never cease to surprise me. You have been nice to me tonight, and I-“</p>
<p>Hermione grabbed him by the jacket lapels and pulled him down for another kiss. He was so much taller than her, almost a good foot. </p>
<p>He responded back quickly, and his hands were back around her body, pressing her back against the wall. </p>
<p>Draco’s lips left hers and went to her neck. She was delicious, tasting like vanilla and cookies. His hand drifted up her skirt, and was cupping her bottom, only her tights keeping his hands from her flesh. He was tempted to remove them though.</p>
<p>She moaned softly, and grabbed his hair at the roots, forcing his lips back to hers. His lips were soft, and he tasted amazing. She wanted more. </p>
<p>But this was a bad idea. A very bad, and a very stupid idea. It was so wrong, but felt so right.</p>
<p>Draco pulled back a few seconds later, huffing for breath. He kept his forehead against hers, his nose touching hers. His lips were mere inches from hers.</p>
<p>“Draco, you can tell me anything,” I whispered.</p>
<p>“I know I can, and I know you won’t tell Potty. But if I tell you, then you will be in danger.” He replied, his voice an octave lower than usual. </p>
<p>“I’m already in danger.” She replied, her hand cupping his cheek. </p>
<p>She pulled his face back to hers, kissing him.</p>
<p>They snogged for a few more minutes before pulling away for breath, Draco resting his forehead on hers, pressing soft kisses to the crown of her head.</p>
<p>“I’ve been tasked with Killing Dumbledore. The Dark Lord expects me to fail. If I fail, then my mother and I will probably be killed. This is your only warning. If you get involved with me, then you will be in extreme danger. I won’t care what happens to me, I will care what happens to you. Do you understand me?”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded carefully, “Yeah. I’m already in danger, so what’s another thing on my plate? He’s already after me, so it’s not that big of a deal to add some extra danger.”</p>
<p>“Got it.” He replied before kissing her again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*March 6th Year*</p>
<p>Meet me on the top of the astronomy tower at 2AM.<br/>-Draco M</p>
<p>He had given her no option to say no. Hermione knew that this meeting would be different. It wouldn’t be stolen kisses between cigarettes. Intense make out sessions, heightening the sexual frustration growing between them. It had been like for months, since they first kissed.</p>
<p>He had told her about some of his mission, but not all of it. Hermione kept her mouth shut. She knew it was approaching and this would be one of the last times she would see him in this new light. Then he would become the enemy once more.</p>
<p>Hermione borrowed Harry’s invisibility cloak after dinner and once her roommates were sound asleep around midnight thirty, Hermione go ready.</p>
<p>She had been prepping since Christmas for this moment, picking up some cute underthings with her muggle female cousin. </p>
<p>She pulled on the black lacy knickers and bra while under the covers and then slipped on a pair of pajama shorts and a tank top.</p>
<p>She swung the cloak around her form and headed down the stairs and out the portrait. The Fat Lady grumbled about being disturbed by another ghost, and Hermione ignored her.</p>
<p>Hermione was super early to the astronomy tower but that’s how she wanted it. She didn’t want to be late, and she wanted a few moments to herself to truly think about the implications of what she was about to do. She was about to sleep with the enemy, and it would be so so delicious.</p>
<p>The heightened fear of getting caught made it even more exciting, and the taboo just sent the excitement over the top.<br/>Though she was over thirty minutes early, Draco was already waiting for her, a cigarette in his mouth.</p>
<p>He had set the place up with lanterns that gave off a low glow, a small fire burning in each one. They were floating in the air. He had laid out some blankets on the floor with some pillows. He was leaning out the window, a cigarette in one hand and his free hand gripping the window sill.</p>
<p>Hermione shed the invisibility cloak and approached him softly. She stood behind him and wrapped her arms around his form, resting her check on his back.<br/>Draco smiled softly and relaxed at her touch.</p>
<p>“Did you have any trouble getting here?”</p>
<p>“None whatsoever, I borrowed Harry’s invisibility cloak. I walked easily by the prefects.”</p>
<p>“Good, I set a warding spell so prefects will forget to check the astronomy tower tonight and will just turn around. I set it so it would let you in.”</p>
<p>“That’s advance magic.”</p>
<p>“It was a part of my training to be a Death Eater. We have to learn wards.”</p>
<p>Hermione was silent but her arms tightened around Draco and she pressed her lips to the center of his back.</p>
<p>Draco took a drag of his cigarette before flicking it off the astronomy tower and breaking her embrace so he could turn and face her.</p>
<p>He looked down at her small form, and she looked up at him. Draco placed his hand under her chin and kissed her lips softly.</p>
<p>“I’m going to miss you,” he murmured against her lips.</p>
<p>“You’re leaving that soon?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this is my goodbye. Please don’t overthink it. I’m about to be under more scrutiny, I won’t be able to see you at all, so this is the last time. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Hermione sniffled as she teared up and a few tears escaped.</p>
<p>Draco hurried to wipe them and kiss her forehead.</p>
<p>“My love, please don’t cry. It’s for the best we end it tonight. But I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if I died with having had you.”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded in agreement and sniffled again, “And I wouldn’t forgive myself for the same thing.”</p>
<p>She stood on her toes and kissed Draco softly.</p>
<p>Draco groaned and deepened the kiss, his tongue probing at her mouth, begging for entrance. She obliged and their tongues were tangled in a battle for dominance.</p>
<p>His fingers tangled themselves in her hair as he cradled her face. Hermione’s arms were wrapped around his neck, her fingers placing with the strands of hair at the base of his neck.</p>
<p>Draco pulled away a few seconds later and pulled her to the makeshift blanket bed, sitting down and pulling her gently into his lap.</p>
<p>Hermione sat across his lap and kissed him with ease now that they were face to face. She didn’t have to stand on her toes.</p>
<p>Draco’s lips left hers and traveled down the exposed skin of her neck, placing soft kisses and sharp nips, careful not to leave any marks. The nips earned quiet moans and gasps from Hermione. Draco smirked against her skin as he peppered her right shoulder with kisses.</p>
<p>Hermione took a deep breath to steady herself before grabbing the hem of her tank top and pulling the garment over her head. </p>
<p>Draco groaned when he was her lacy bra and he hardened under her. She had prepared. She knew where this was going.</p>
<p>Draco kissed her collar bones as his hands slipped behind her back and undid her bra. He pulled it off her slim form and took her right nipple in his mouth, sucking and nipping at it gently. Hermione gasped and her eyes shot open wide as her head tilted back. This was all new to her, having never been with someone. But she had read up on it and knew how to keep it from hurting and what to expect.</p>
<p>Draco moved onto her left nipple and he circled it with his tongue.</p>
<p>He gently laid her on the blankets, her head resting comfortably on a pillow. He stood and pulled off his shirt, revealing his slip seeker’s body. He may have quit the team, but he still practiced for the unlikely future in which he could return to the sport.</p>
<p>He pulled off his sweats and pants, releasing his cock. Hermione’s eyes widened. It was average size, but still looked big to Hermione. </p>
<p>He climbed on top of her, balancing his weight on his forearms. He looked down into her chocolate eyes and groaned.</p>
<p>“Fuck, you’re beautiful.” He whispered before burying his face in her hair.</p>
<p>Hermione smiled and snuggled her face into his neck, kissing the crook softly. She peppered his neck with kisses, as far as she could reach.</p>
<p>Draco pulled away a few seconds later and pressed his lips against hers, hard this time. He poured his heart and soul into that kiss, releasing all his passion and love for her.</p>
<p>He released her lips and kissed his way down her body, stopping at her breasts to give them so attention before kissing his way to her navel where he swirled his tongue around her belly button and finally reaching the hem of her shorts.</p>
<p>Hermione was taking deep breaths to calm herself down. Her body was flushed from all the attention she was getting from him, and to be honest, she was nervous.</p>
<p>Draco slipped her fingers under the hem of her shorts and looked up at her, asking for permission with his eyes. Hermione gave a slight nod and draco pulled down her shorts, revealing her thin lacy knickers.</p>
<p>He groaned and kissed the inside of her thighs as he pushed them apart.</p>
<p>Hermione moaned softly.</p>
<p>He teased her thighs for a few minutes before pulling down her knickers and pulling them completely off. Draco buried his face in her quim and licked her slit before seperating her vaginal lips and attacking her engorged clit with his tongue.</p>
<p>She was already wet and ready for him. </p>
<p>“Fuck,” she whispered, her eyes rolling back and she threw her head back as Draco made quick work of her cunt.</p>
<p>He dipped a finger inside of her as his tongue worked on her clit, and began to slowly pump in and out of her wetness.</p>
<p>“Oh, Draco,” she whispered breathlessly.</p>
<p>Draco groaned at the sound of his name.</p>
<p>He continued to eat her out until Hermione hit her high and came. Her back arched as she released a high pitched scream. Her first orgasm by the hand of someone else.</p>
<p>“There are silencing spells right?” She asked quietly after catching her breath.</p>
<p>Draco chuckled and rested his chin on her pelvic bone, “Of course my love.”</p>
<p>“You keep calling me that. Is there a reason why?” She asked quietly, her eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Yes, because I’m madly and stupidly in love with you. In another world, you’d be mine. All mine. I’d never let you go. But that world doesn’t exist. But I don’t want to leave you without you knowing my true feelings. That would be a shame if I were to die without you knowing how I truly felt. Now, are you ready?”</p>
<p>Hermione blushed and nodded, “You don’t want me to suck you off?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t care less about a blow job right now, I just want to be buried inside of you, whispering sweet nothings into your ear.”</p>
<p>Hermione blushed a deep red that covered her body as Draco made his was back to her face where he kissed her softly. His right hand held her left arm above her head and his fingers entwined with hers.</p>
<p>He lined himself up at her entrance and entered her slowly. Hermione moaned softly. She was wet and aroused enough for him to not hurt.</p>
<p>It was everything she had hoped for and more.</p>
<p>Draco groaned and buried his face in her neck where he kissed the side of her neck softly.</p>
<p>“Fuck. You feel amazing ‘Mione.” he groaned into her neck.</p>
<p>“You feel wonderful inside me.” Hermione responded breathlessly.</p>
<p>Draco began to thrust inside of her.</p>
<p>She wasn’t his first tryst obviously, but she would be his favorite. One that he would always want to revisit. And she was more than a tryst. He wished he could make her his wife. But that would never happen. Not in this lifetime. Maybe the next one.</p>
<p>Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p>But this short time, with her in his arms, that is all that mattered for him. To have her close to him, loving him, holding him, that’s all that he cared for. If he could end the war tomorrow, he would. If he had the shot to kill the Dark Lord and protect her, he would.</p>
<p>Draco made love to her that night. Holding her and kissing her. Paying attention to every facial feature, making sure she was never uncomfortable. CHerishing every moan that spilled from her sweet, plump lips. </p>
<p>When they had finished, Hermione curled up into his side for a few minutes before Draco offered her a cigarette.</p>
<p>Cigarettes were always best after sex.</p>
<p>They stood by the window, naked as the day they were born, smoking and staring at the stars.</p>
<p>“I love you too,” Hermione admitted. “I love you more than books.”</p>
<p>Draco chuckled and kissed the side of her head. “Good. I wish I could be with you my love. I truly hope your side wins. If I don’t make it-”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk that way.” She commanded.</p>
<p>Draco ignored her command, “If I don’t make it, I want you to know, you’re the best that that has ever happened to me. I will never regret being with you. I will pray for your success. I don’t deserve you or your goodness, but I will take what I can get.”</p>
<p>Hermione flicked her cigarette out the window and buried herself into his arms, crying softly. </p>
<p>Fate was so twisted and cruel.</p>
<p>They made love once more that night before parting ways as the sky slowly started to brighten and the stars went out one by one. </p>
<p>Hermione hid under the cloak and left first, Draco insisted on staying to clean up and refused her help.</p>
<p>“I need a few minutes my love. I don’t want you to see me cry. And I know you’re about to cry and I need to let you.”</p>
<p>He was right. Hermione curled up in an alcove under the invisibility cloak and silently sobbed. The best that that ever happened to her was being snatched away. And there wasn’t a damn thing she could do about it.</p>
<p>Even if her side won, there was no guarantee that either of them would survive. And even if they both did, what sort of future would they have? He would be an outcast and she would be practically lynched if she went with him. There was no truly winning.</p>
<p>Everything she ever cared about was lost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco went on to kill Dumbledore a few months later. He released death eaters into the castle. He successfully killed Dumbledore and Hermione sobbed that night, for the innocence that they had both lost, for the love that would never blossom, and for all that they had lost.</p>
<p>Before she left Hogwarts for the last time, Hermione went to the base of Ravenclaw tower and had one last cigarette. She had a bottle of firewhisky at her lips and she drank to the future that would never be.</p>
<p>With the final inhale, she said her goodbyes to her old life and looked to the future with a fierce determination.</p>
<p>It was his wish that she win, and she would do her best to make it come true.</p>
