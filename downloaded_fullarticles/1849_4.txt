    <p>At age 17, Dean Winchester knew responsibilities.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, his father taught him great moral values (despite wanting revenge for the death of his wife).</p>
<p>So he was very torn with what he was hearing from next door in the vacation hotel at a saddle ranch.</p>
<p>At the moment, he had to babysit his 13 year old brother Sammy in the hotel room while his father went to investigate a newly built house about two miles from the hotel. It turns out that the workers and the owner of the house decided that the house should be built on sacred ground. That part of the ground was only sacred because of an Indian burial. Needless to say the elderly Indian spirit was not at peace when this happened. His remains were tossed somewhere in a rubble further away from the house, so John Winchester had his work cut out for him.</p>
<p>Dean didn't like the heat and Sam hated that he had to leave his previous school. But, they both had to admit that the past two days were filled with content fun of riding horses and having an all-you-can-eat buffet.</p>
<p>Dean glanced at his surroundings and sighed. His father assumed that the saddle ranch resort had a decent hotel and paid for his sons to have a fun vacation while he hunted an honored spirit.</p>
<p>Sure, the ponies were fun for Sam &amp; Dean, but the elder son preferred to live in a hotel that didn't look and feel like a <strong>motel</strong>.</p>
<p>Dean glanced at the time on his watch. It said 2:04AM.</p>
<p>He glanced over at Sam, who stared at the wall with worry. The younger Winchester sleepily turned to his brother while laying on his bed. "Dean, do you think the ghost managed to find us or hurt the next door neighbors?"</p>
<p>He shook his head in reply. "It's none of our business. Just go back to sleep, Sammy." </p>
<p>Sam nodded and yawned, drifting off back to sleep. <em>The kid has heard louder noises in actual motel rooms</em>, Dean thought to himself. His eyebrows furrowed in thought. <em>Although they're really noisy, they seem to be not as noisy when arguing... as if they're trying to low down the volume... why would they care about their relationship arguments being heard?</em></p>
<p>Curious, Dean got up from his own bed and moved towards the wall slowly. He leaned in and lightly pressed his ear against the icky yellow wallpaper.</p>
<p>"I'M A GROWN ASS ADULT! WHY CAN'T I GO OUT WITH MY FRIENDS?! THEY'RE HERE AT THE RANCH!"</p>
<p>"YOU WILL NOT GO OUT WITH MORRIGAN ANYMORE!"</p>
<p>"WHY NOT?! THIS IS RACISM! IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S NOT ASIAN!"</p>
<p>Dean's eyes widened at the sudden sound of objects crashing on a wall, like a small crate of...</p>
<p>"DAD, NO! PLEASE DON'T HURT ME! WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU GET A BOX OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS?!" </p>
<p><em>Those were Christmas lights?</em> Dean listened for more, because he could have sworn hearing an elderly woman's voice argue with an elderly man's voice. Soon enough, he heard the woman's voice, but she sounded... worse... than being possessed...</p>
<p>"I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!"</p>
<p>Yep, she sounded drugged...</p>
<p>"MOM, NO! WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?! PUT THE KNIFE AWAY!"</p>
<p>"Sweetie?" The man finally lowered his tone. "Please put down the knife..."</p>
<p>"NO! I WILL KILL YOU FOR DISTURBING MY SLEEP, BOTH OF YOU! I. AM. SICK!"</p>
<p>He moved to grab the doorknob of his room, but then he heard a frail soft voice echo through the walls.</p>
<p>"Mommy, stop it!"</p>
<p>There were several noises of struggle and sobbing from the voice he heard before, which he could now distinguish as a teenager.</p>
<p>"WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME LIVE?! I'M OLD ENOUGH TO FOLLOW MY OWN RULES! LISTEN TO ME AND TALK TO ME LIKE AN ADULT!"</p>
<p>There were more shouts to follow, which were now inaudible, then it decreased. Dean realized now he was listening in on family drama and slowly stepped away from the wall and the door. </p>
<p>The mother took too much medicine, since she's apparently ill, and resulted in a drugged state. She went ballistic for a moment with a knife and threatened her supposed husband and teenage daughter. The teenage daughter was being a bit of a brat, considering what time it is and how she mentioned she wanted to hang out with her friend or friends still... who was the one with a soft voice?</p>
<p>"Nikita, go throw the knife away. Hopefully CPS isn't around - last time I checked they were having a drink with the owner in the main cafeteria of the ranch resort," the father ordered someone and grumbled near the wall, where Dean could hear the words "How the hell is there a knife hidden in this place?"</p>
<p>When he heard the door open and close, Dean decided to peek out the window, without breaking the salt lines, to watch who the soft spoken voice was. His eyes widened in shock at a (thankfully unscarred) young girl who looked to be about 4 years old holding the (thankfully clean) knife carefully with a napkin and climbing down the stairs to throw the knife away in the trashcan. Dean also noticed how the little girl's clothing was more second-handed than his own and Sammy's clothes. Her clothes looked too loose on her body and were slightly torn at the seams.</p>
<p>She walked back to her hotel room with her family, and Dean slowly made sure the salt lines were still intact before moving back to his bed near the door.</p>
<p>He wanted so badly to report to CPS, but he couldn't.</p>
<p>He has nearly a year to go before he turns 18 - legal adult age.</p>
<p>If he reported to Child Protection Services now, he and Sammy would be torn away from their father and torn from each other in the foster care system.</p>
<p>He still had an obligation to protect Sammy.</p>
<p>He still loves his one-track minded father, who is stern and strict most of the time but he has decent intentions.</p>
<p>Dean wants and has to protect his family.</p>
<p>...he still wanted to protect the little girl from her family. He saw the rapidly aging look on her face as if she's already been through puberty except for her older sister. He could never forget her appearance... her black hair, tan skin, crescent moon-shaped eyes of a hazel color, and a small button nose.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The next day Dean was surprised to find his dad walking back into the hotel room. "Dad? Back so soon?"</p>
<p>John turned to his sons, who were both wide awake and freshly changed into new clothes for the day. "Yeah, I just got the refund for your trip. Sorry to cut the vacation short, but I finished the hunt and got another hunt in Seattle. Somethin' about a facility called Manticore..." He mumbled while helping Dean pack his duffel bag. "It's colder there around this time of year, so you don't have to sprout out freckles here and burn, Dean."</p>
<p>Dean's face brightened at the prospect of staying away from the hot scorching sun of the Californian desert. Sam, on the other hand, sulked.</p>
<p>"Dad, really? We're moving again? We just got here!"</p>
<p>"....did I also mention that we'll be staying there for at least 5 months, so you can stay in school undercover while Dean stays at home?"</p>
<p>Sam perked up at the mention of staying in school for a semester. Dean pouted at the idea of staying cooped up indoors and whined. "Oh come on!"</p>
<p>John raised an eyebrow at Dean as he finished packing Dean's stuff. Sam happily started packing his own duffel bag.</p>
<p>"Son, I also got a warning from Bobby in the call about the next hunt... they said someone appeared to look like a younger version of you running around, so I don't want to risk you getting caught by the police out of nowhere. I'll stay with you guys this time while hunting so I can keep feeding you while teaching you the basic school education stuff."</p>
<p>Sam cheered after hearing those words from his father. "I can be my own person for a whole semester in school! I won't have to be known as Dean's lame brother!" He cried out as he finished packing and ran out the door.</p>
<p>John chuckled and moved to follow Sam to the 1967 Chevrolet Impala, which was unlocked at the moment because he knew his son's eagerness for school, but was stopped by Dean. "Oh, dude, what's wrong?" He asked him.</p>
<p>Dean bit his lip and glanced at the wall, which went noticed by his father. "Late last night I heard a specific argument... adolescents were involved and I wanted to call their parents out on the CPS, but... Dad, I didn't want CPS to find us, too..." He trailed off and looked down sadly.</p>
<p>The eldest Winchester put the pieces together of his son's trails of thought and nodded in understanding. "Was it next door?" He pointed at the wall Dean was staring at moments ago. "I could play the inspection route for termites and see if they're still there or if the children got hurt. How many were there?"</p>
<p>"I figured there were two females, sir." He then proceeded to tell his father his witness statement of what happened.</p>
<p>John nodded and patted his back. "Go check on Sam while I go check out what's going on, okay?"</p>
<p>Dean sighed in relief and nodded, walking out the door with his duffel bag to the Impala. John took a deep breath and walked next door to knock. He waited for a moment before listening closely to the door. He waited again for a moment and then decided to break into the room with his toolkit. </p>
<p>He entered the room slowly after unlocking it with his tools and checked the area. It appeared as though the family checked out, but John could see where Dean heard the struggles of a possible physical argument between family on the wall near the corner of a bed.</p>
<p><em>A child was backed into a corner of her bed... she must have suffered abuse from her parents... </em>John thought to himself with a devastating hypothesis that most likely may have been true.</p>
<p>Later when he arrived at his car, he noticed Dean staring at the hotel door next to their previous door with a sad gaze in the passenger seat. Sam, on the other hand, already started studying in the backseat of the car. John chuckled and shook his head at Sam's antics, causing Dean to get distracted and notice Sam's nerdy hobby. Slowly the family soon forgot the family drama and moved on.</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <em> <strong>In 2005...</strong><br/> </em>
</p>
<p>"Dean."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"I fucked up."</p>
<p>Dean sighed and glanced at Sam while driving the Impala. "Sammy, I told you not to blame yourself for what happened to Jess."</p>
<p>"...it's not just Jess."</p>
<p>Dean slammed his foot on the breaks.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, Dean! What the fuck?!" Sam gasped in surprise as he adjusted his seat belt.</p>
<p>The eldest brother turned to him with a glint in his eye as he glared at him. "We already discussed this - no chic flicks! I know I wasn't the ideal brother you grew up with, but you didn't have to shut me out when you went to Stanford - "</p>
<p>"Dean! I don't mean that!"</p>
<p>"Then what the hell do you mean?!"</p>
<p>"I mean that I... I lied to Jess about getting an interview for Stanford law."</p>
<p>Dean stopped yelling after that and stared at Sam in confusion. "Didn't you study to be a lawyer?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but... the practice that I applied to interview for was to be a lawyer available for Child Protection Services. It was a new position offered and I didn't want to pass it up."</p>
<p>His elder brother stared at him in surprise. "Isn't that weird? After our childhood?"</p>
<p>Sam sighed and leaned against the seat. "I know, but recently I helped Jess out at the pediatric ward for charity week at Stanford... it was in September. There was a 13 year old girl who had a broken left arm and bruises on her face and arms. I hid at the front door of her room because her parents were standing at the foot of the bed, hissing threats at her and blaming her for her older sister's coma state. I checked up her records and her sister is 22 in the floor above the pediatric floor of the hospital. She was in a coma due to alcohol poisoning and a car crash, which should have killed her. It didn't because she was in the passenger seat."</p>
<p>Dean's eyes widened. "So the 13 year old drove? And her parents were pissed at <em>her</em> for saving her sister's<em> life</em>?!"</p>
<p>Sam sadly nodded. "When her parents left to see their eldest daughter, I went to talk with her. Her name's Nikita Yuson and I could tell her family has been abusing both her and her sister, though she told me her sister was like that sometimes, too. I wanted... I wanted to be <em>her</em> lawyer and call CPS for her, you know? I would have taken her in and Jess would have loved her..."</p>
<p>Dean contemplated on the information for a moment before nodding and turned to his younger brother. "So what does she look like? Is she still in California? I know we're on the other side of the country, but I can always give Dad a call so he could check it out." Sam scoffed when their father was mentioned. Dean frowned. "Hey, he cares, too! There was this one time when I was 17 and you were 13 yourself, and Dad took us to a saddle ranch resort where I witnessed by ear of bad parenting. I told Dad all about it and he went his way to check it out before we left, remember?"</p>
<p>Sam hesitantly nodded at the small memory. "I didn't think he'd do that for anyone."</p>
<p>"Well, the man does care about us and children, Sammy. He just has a hard way of showing it." Dean shook his head and sighed. "Anyway, I remember the girl being 4 years old and having tan skin, hazel eyes - her eyes were shaped like crescent moons, a button nose, and long black hair. I think she had a teenage sister and elderly-like parents, from the way the voices were like."</p>
<p>"...Asian descent, jet black hair?"</p>
<p>Dean contemplated more and nodded in agreement. "I guess she really was Asian."</p>
<p>Sam quickly whipped out his phone and went through his gallery photos. "I know chances of this are 1 in a million, but is this her?" He asked in wonder as he showed his brother his phone. The picture consisted of Sam smiling happily beside the same description of a girl Dean made, except she grew more in her early preteen stage but was still pretty small. In comparison to Sam's puppy smile, she only had a weak small one for the camera. Her face had a few bruises and she also had a cast for her left arm.</p>
<p>"...this is her."</p>
<p>"Are you sure, Dean?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm sure! I can't forget this face - shit, I'll call Dad about this. Hopefully he can help her in between hunts."</p>
