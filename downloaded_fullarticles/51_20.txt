    <p>A/N - Hello friends! Welcome to the sequel to The Serpent and the Badger! Don't hate me too much for this first chapter! It's all for the story! Enjoy! Let me know what you think of this first chapter!</p><p>--------------------</p><p>"I think we should break up." Scorpius had said one day in mid-July.</p><p>"What? Why?" Hugo questioned. This was definitely coming out of nowhere. Everything was going great between them. The only hitch in their relationship was the fact that his Dad was still absolutely against Hugo and Scorpius being together.</p><p>"We're at different places in life right now. You still have two years of school left. I'll be starting at the Ministry soon. We won't see eachother for most of the year." Scorpius explained.</p><p>"We can make it work." Hugo said confidently. Victoire and Teddy had made it work, though she had only one year left of school at the time.</p><p>Scorpius shook his head, "I don't feel right doing that to you."</p><p>"Doing what to me? Staying with me? Don't be ridiculous Scorpius. I love you!" Hugo said.</p><p>"Look, Hugo. This was your first relationship. You should be with someone else, someone who will also be at Hogwarts." Scorpius said.</p><p>"This is bollocks!" Hugo exclaimed, "I don't want to be with anyone else! I want to be with you!"</p><p>"You just don't know what it's like to be with other people. This will be for the best, you'll see." Scorpius said, the tone almost felt patronizing.</p><p>Hugo had never wanted to be with anyone else. It was always Scorpius for him, as long as he could remember. He had only ever wanted Scorpius. "You're being bloody ridiculous!"</p><p>Scorpius seemed to have already made up his mind. There was no convincing him otherwise. Hugo had tried. "I'm sorry, Hugo." Scorpius had said before walking out on him.</p><p>Hugo was in shock, he couldn't breathe. He couldn't believe this was happening right now. He never saw this coming, he supposed it was naive of him to think they wouldn't break up eventually. Could he really be blamed though? His parents had gotten together young and were still together, the concept of staying with your first love wasn't strange to him.</p><p>He didn't cry that first day because he hadn't fully processed what had transpired. Then the next morning it hit him. Scorpius had broken up with him. Hugo found he didn't want to leave his bed. So he stayed in bed, fighting back tears. Eventually the dam broke and everything came out. His dad had checked up on him several times that day. His mum had wanted to talk as soon as she had gotten home from work. Hugo didn't want to talk about it.</p><p>A few weeks had passed and Hugo barely left his room. He had gone to his Uncle Harry's birthday party and attempted to put on a happy face. Then once he had gotten home, he shut himself back in his room. He couldn't wait for this bloody summer to be over. He couldn't wait to take over as Quidditch Captain, that would certainly be a good distraction.</p><p>"Hugo! Open this bloody door before I open it myself!" Rose demanded from the other side of the door. </p><p>Hugo made no movement to get the door. He held out hope Rose would leave, but she was stubborn. She wouldn't leave. </p><p>"All right! I'm invoking the right of sibling invasion of privacy!" She announced before she mutttered an unlocking charm and opened the door. </p><p>Hugo said nothing to her, choosing to act as if she weren't there. He buried his face in his pillow. 
</p><p>"Come on, Hugh. Talk to me." Rose said, her tone soft. "You've isolated yourself for so long, you're looking really pale."</p><p>"Go away, Rose." He said, his voice muffled by the pillow.</p><p>"I'm sitting right here until you talk to me." Rose said indignantly plopping down on the side of his bed.</p><p>Five minutes passed and Rose still hadn't budged. If he wanted her to leave he had to talk to her. Hugo sighed into his pillow then sat up. "I just don't understand it, Rose. It just doesn't make any sense." </p><p>"Guys are idiots. It's time you learn that now." Rose said putting a hand on his shoulder. "I can kill him if you'd like." </p><p>Hugo chuckled, "I don't think you being in Azkaban would do anyone good."</p><p>They both sat there for awhile in silence, Hugo leaning his head on his sister's shoulder. </p><p>---------------</p><p>A/N - Sorry it's so short! Think of it as a sampler. I will be switching on and off from Scorpius and Hugo's pov.</p>
