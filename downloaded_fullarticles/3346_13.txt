          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was supposed to be a harmless prank, an act of revenge that (Y/n)’s boyfriend Draco and friends decided to pull. Getting back at the Weasley twins for turning (Y/n)'s hair pink. It’d been an accident, they were aiming for Draco, and neither of the twins seemed too happy about getting her.<br/>
“You won’t hurt them?” (Y/n) had asked.<br/>
“It’s adorable that you feel sorry for them,” Draco had teased, “But, no. Embarrassment, but no injury.”<br/>
So, when (Y/n) saw one of the twins tumbling down a flight of stairs after Draco’s little ‘prank’, she went pale. Draco, Crabbe and Goyle fled.<br/>
“Hey!” she yelled.<br/>
She ran after him and knelt next to the twin, wishing she could tell them apart.<br/>
“Fred?”<br/>
No response.<br/>
“George?”<br/>
“Mmm,” he opened his eyes slightly.<br/>
“You’re George,” she said, “Excellent. Can you understand me?”<br/>
“Mmm-hmm,” he opened his eyes all the way and tried to sit up but winced.<br/>
“What is it? What hurts?”<br/>
“Foot.”<br/>
She noticed that his right foot was bent, and his leg remained unmoved.<br/>
“I’m going to fix it,” she grabbed his foot and slowly straightened it, “Episky!”<br/>
He waved his foot back and forth, then smiled at her.<br/>
“You fixed it,” he noted, “Who taught you to fix bones?”<br/>
“Not important. We should get you to Madam Pomfrey. You could have a concussion.”<br/>
“Mmm-kay.”<br/>
“What are you doing with my brother?” Fred demanded as he rushed to George’s side.<br/>
“I...he…fell down the…and…” she stuttered<br/>
“She fixed my leg, Freddie,” George smiled.<br/>
Fred looked at her with recognition.<br/>
“Was this Malfoy’s idea?”<br/>
She nodded.<br/>
“This was for the pink hair, wasn’t it?”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“You know that was an accident?” Fred asked.<br/>
“Didn’t stop everyone from teasing me about it for a whole week,” she commented.<br/>
“That justifies throwing my brother down the stairs?” Fred yelled, “You could have killed him!”<br/>
“I didn’t know they would do this! They said it would be a nice little prank and you two wouldn’t get hurt! I made them promise not to hurt you!”<br/>
Fred’s expression softened as he helped George up.<br/>
“Where is Malfoy?”<br/>
“Draco and his friends ran off,” she answered, “Didn’t want to get in trouble, I suppose.”<br/>
“I’ll think of something,” Fred said, “You won’t get in trouble.”<br/>
“Really?”<br/>
“Yeah. Come on, George.”<br/>
“Thank you,” she said and ran off to the Slytherin room.<br/>
…<br/>
“You bloody idiot!” (Y/n) shouted, “You could’ve killed him!”<br/>
“Don’t exaggerate,” Draco scoffed, “The Weasel twins will be fine.”<br/>
“His name is George!” she replied, “You…you don’t even care, do you?”<br/>
He was silent.<br/>
“You don’t,” she confirmed, “We’re done.”<br/>
“(Y/n),” Draco pleaded.<br/>
“No! Now just go!”<br/>
“Fine,” Draco stated simply.<br/>
…<br/>
Turns out, the only reason Crabbe and Goyle were nice to (Y/n) was because of her relationship with Draco. She wondered if anyone in the Slytherin House truly cared after how they left her; robes torn, hair in a mess and tears running down her face. She ran out into the halls, not caring that it was dark and she’d get in trouble if she was caught.<br/>
“What are you doing here?”<br/>
She jumped and turned to face the voice. George. He had a bandage around his head.<br/>
“G…”<br/>
“I never got to thank you…” he began, “Are you okay?”<br/>
“Yes. No. No, I’m not.”<br/>
George hugged her as she began to cry again.<br/>
“What happened?” he asked.<br/>
“You don’t know me,” she noted, “You…you shouldn’t care.”<br/>
“Yet, here I am, caring. Tell me your name and we won’t be strangers anymore.”<br/>
“(Y/f/n),” she answered, “(F/n) (L/n).”<br/>
“Hello, (Y/n). I’m George Weasley. Will you tell me what’s happened?”<br/>
She explained what Crabbe and Goyle did.<br/>
“Shit,” George breathed, “I’m sorry.”<br/>
“They didn’t ACTUALLY…They just wanted to scare me.”<br/>
“What kind of stunts do they pull in the Slytherin House?” George asked, sounding disgusted.<br/>
“It’s not all of them,” she spoke, “Just…just a few.”<br/>
“But the rest don’t stop them?” George asked.<br/>
“No one but Draco. And they do it when Snape isn’t around.”<br/>
“Draco, he’s…”<br/>
“My boyfriend. WAS my boyfriend.”<br/>
“What do they do?”<br/>
“It’s a game to them,” she answered, “I make sure never to be in the common room alone, especially at night. Sometimes, they’ll grope me or steal my clothes when I’m taking a shower, or…”<br/>
“Do THIS?”<br/>
She nodded.<br/>
“What are you two doing out of your rooms?” someone demanded.<br/>
A curly haired ginger looked at (Y/n) and George. He wore a prefect badge.<br/>
“Percy, she’s just been…”<br/>
“I’ll go back to the Slytherin…”<br/>
“Wait,” Percy commanded.<br/>
“Perce, leave her alone,” George said.<br/>
“George, I have a duty as a…”<br/>
“Prefect,” George finished, “Yes, I know. We all do. You never shut up about it. But, (Y/n) here has just been…”<br/>
He stopped.<br/>
“I’m not a monster, George,” Percy said, “(Y/n), you won’t get in trouble, though I suggest you seek medical attention immediately.”<br/>
“I’ll take you,” George offered.<br/>
Percy eyed him for a moment, then nodded.<br/>
“Go,” he said, “Directly to Madame Pomfrey.”<br/>
…<br/>
“Sorry about our brother,” George said as he joined up with Fred.<br/>
“Are you going to tell me that he’s nice once you get to know him?” (Y/n) asked jokingly.<br/>
“No,” Fred chuckled.<br/>
The twins had taken her to Madam Pomfrey, who recorded the incident and collected Crabbe and Goyle’s fingerprints they left on your body.<br/>
“Would you two see her back to the Slytherin house?” Madam Pomfrey asked.<br/>
“Of course,” George answered.<br/>
…<br/>
The twins followed (Y/n) as she headed for the Slytherin House.<br/>
“So,” she said, “Tell me about yourselves.”<br/>
“What do you want to know?” George asked.<br/>
“Surely there’s more to you two than pranks.”<br/>
“Well, George here is a big softie.”<br/>
“Better than being a sadist,” George retorted.<br/>
“I am not a…” Fred defended, “Stop calling me that!”<br/>
“Guys,” she interrupted, laughing.<br/>
“THIS,” George pointed to her, “Is not our idea of a joke.”<br/>
“Exactly,” Fred agreed.<br/>
…<br/>
Crabbe and Goyle were kicked out of Hogwarts for the rest of the year. Fred and George laughed when they heard about it, when they found (Y/n) wandering the halls after hours again.<br/>
“Did something happen?” Fred asked.<br/>
“No,” she answered, “Do you guys sneak out on a regular basis?”<br/>
“We could ask you the same question,” George teased.<br/>
“Anyway, do you want to go explore,” Fred asked.<br/>
“Explore?”<br/>
“Yeah,” George said, “The castle has all sorts of secret tunnels.”<br/>
“Secret to everyone except us.”<br/>
“Umm,” she hesitated.<br/>
“You don’t have to,” George said, “If…I mean, you don’t even know us.”<br/>
“I’d like to.”<br/>
“Really?” Fred raised an eyebrow, “Because George here was just telling me about how…”<br/>
“Fred,” George warned.<br/>
“Telling you about what?” she asked.<br/>
“I’ve been…interested in you for a while,” George admitted, “But…Fred kept telling me that…because you were a Slytherin, I shouldn’t bother…Then, you helped me, not caring if you’d get in trouble or not…”<br/>
“You’re interested in me?”<br/>
“Yeah,” George said.<br/>
“So am I,” she replied, “In YOU, I mean.”<br/>
“Excellent,” George grabbed her hand.<br/>
“I...I think I will go exploring with you,” she said.</p></div>
