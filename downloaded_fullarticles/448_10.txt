    <p>He knew the instant the door opened that he was unwanted there. Behind the door stood Granger, glaring at him, as if he was the grim in person.</p><p>“What do you want, Malfoy?” Still the old Granger. He couldn’t forget the punch she threw at him in their third year. He was sure she considered it right now once again.</p><p>“Looking for Potter.” He said pointing at the official robe for the Ministry. “Official Ministry business.”</p><p>“Hermione, what are you doing out of…” Weasley had emerged from the depths of the house.</p><p>“Malfoy.”</p><p>“Weasel.”</p><p>The young ginger man told his wife to back to bed. When Granger turned around, Draco could see that she actually was really pregnant. That made a lot of sense since she wouldn’t just like that abandon her post at the Ministry.</p><p>He still wasn’t invited into the house, now he just had to face off with the Weasel.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Draco sighed and repeated that he was looking for Potter. “Have you seen him?”</p><p>Weasley shrugged his shoulders and pressed his lips together, before answering.</p><p>“Haven’t heard from him in a while. But that’s nothing new.” He said and crossed his arms over his chest. Draco looked at him a bit surprised as well as in disbelief. Potter wouldn’t talk to his best friends in a while? That seemed suspicious.</p><p>“Why? What do you want from him?” The Weasel now also seemed suspicious of him.</p><p>“As I said; official Ministry business. Can’t tell anyone.”</p><p>The man at the door raised one eyebrow and shook his head. “How come you became an Auror and everything? You never seemed keen to work for the Ministry.”</p><p>Draco could feel the anger in his body almost overwhelming him, but he kept it inside. This was why he didn’t want to accept the mission of finding Harry Potter. He had to go through people that only ever saw the worst in him and now he had to – once again – convince them that he had changed. But none of his former class mates would ever believe that.</p><p>“Look, I am here to do my job. I’m looking for Potter and I would like for you to give me any information you got concerning his whereabouts.” Draco was a bit proud of his neutral statement. Even if it seemed cold, but he only said what was true.</p><p>Weasley sighed and nodded. “Okay man. But our information is a bit outdated.” He stared at Draco for a while and turned back into his home. “Stay there. I’ll bring you everything I’ve got.”<br/>
Draco was surprised that this statement actually worked. Maybe it wasn’t just this, maybe Potters friends were a little worried about what had happened to him, so they were happy that someone was tracing his steps.</p><p>A few moments later and Weasley came out with a small folder. Draco frowned and wanted to grab it, when the man took it back.<br/>
“Please don’t tell Harry, that you’ve got this information from us. He’s trying to stay undetected and I would hate for him to find out that I gave him away.”<br/>
Draco nodded and took out a little notebook.</p><p>“When did you last talk to Potter and where was he by that time?”</p><p>Weasley played with the folder in his hands, but seemed to genuinely think about the question.</p><p>“We talked to him about two months ago; he said he was heading towards York. I’m pretty sure he’s going to go to Scotland.”</p><p>Draco stopped writing and looked at the red-haired man. “What do you mean ‘he’s going’? He can apparate!”</p><p>Weasley nodded. “He told us, that he was going by foot. Something about how he could think about things while he’s walking. I don’t know, man. I haven’t heard from him in ages.”</p><p>“Alright.” Draco put his notebook back into his robe and accepted the folder. Before he could leave, Weasley addressed him again: “Malfoy, if you find him, please let us know. We’re worried sick.”</p><p>Draco nodded and turned. So he was right; Granger and Weasley were actually worried about Potter and that was why they were happy to talk to him.<br/>
He thought about apparating to York and start asking questions around the smaller villages, but decided to stay at home one more day and look through the folder Weasley had given him.</p>
