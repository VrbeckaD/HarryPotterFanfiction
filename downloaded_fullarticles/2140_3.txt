<p>It was a dark, peaceful night in Little Whinging. Carbon copy houses lined Privet Drive, some yards were decorated, some were simple, but all were neat and tidy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One house was different from them all; Number four held an average and very normal family. A man and a wife whom had a son that looked just like his father. Except they had a secret, there was another boy who lived under their roof who was kept hidden during the day. During the evening though, the boy was sent out to do the gardening, the trimming, and, just as the sun was rising, the mowing. He took care of everything so that the house would look like a perfect picture out of Home &amp; Garden Magazine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry Potter was down on his hands and knees in the garden squinting to see the weeds that he was currently pulling. Since the end of his fifth year, his body had started to change, he had finally gotten his overdue growth spurt, stretching out to 5 ft, 10”. His scrawny undernourished frame had filled out, muscles hard-won from manual labour taut beneath his skin. His hair was still short, and jet black, shining like obsidian in the moonlight. His eyes green pools were more world-weary than the average almost 17-year-old. <br/>
<br/>
Harry looked at his old, worn out watch on his pale wristwatch and sighed, it was midnight already.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Happy birthday to me,” Harry mumbled as he returned to working on the garden.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pressure began to build between his shoulders as if someone was pushing and pulling the bones. The pressure gradually faded, being replaced by the twitching of his muscles. A second later he could feel muscles at the base of his spine twitching too. Harry shook the twitches off, assuming they were muscle spasms brought on by overworking his body with too little food. <br/>
<br/>
Moments later, Harry cried out as pain coursed through his back and legs. Howling in agony, it felt like his bones were tearing him apart from the inside, lengthening, reshaping, changing. Collapsing, need and pain washed over him, but it wasn’t his, he could sense three separate sources from himself.</p>
<p>His instincts screamed at him, he needed to find them, his mates, to claim them, make them his so no one could take them from him. His senses heightened, overwhelming his already taxed mind. It became too much for him, as blackness took over, right on top of his Aunt’s daisies.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><u>Malfoy Manor, Third Floor, Master Suite</u> <br/>
<br/>
Lucius Malfoy rolled onto his stomach in his sleep, groaning in pain as his grey triple tail extended, his ears elongated into long, furry points. His eyes shot open, the colour an unnatural molten silver. The elder Malfoy panted and stretched his back as the links in his mind flared open. They had finally unlocked. His Dominant mate had just received their inheritance. The man winced before growling loudly into the night as he tested the three new links attached to his mind, feeling relief when he got small tremors in response.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bed beside him shifted and a head of long blonde hair peaked over the covers at him. Narcissa jerked upright as she saw her husband’s state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Lucius, calm down. What’s wrong?” She murmured, tucking some hair that had fallen in her husband’s face behind his ear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt the bond between her and her husband break, and she knew what had occurred. Lucius had responded to his mate’s first transformation. Narcissa smiled softly as Lucius turned his head to her, his cat-like ears twitching in pain. He growled as he tried to sit up, but his muscles were too weak from the forced shift.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ll let you rest, I’ll be in my bridal suite if you need me.” Narcissa said softly, “Try to relax and go back to sleep. We still have to pick Draco up from the Zabini Manor tomorrow afternoon.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lucius couldn’t stop a contented purr from escaping his chest when he heard his son’s name. Slowly he settled down enough to slip back into sleep, mentally caressing the light thrum of the bonds that had recently formed.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><u>Zabini Manor, Fourth Floor, Fifth Door on the Right</u> <br/>
<br/>
Draco awoke from a deep sleep screaming. He was flat out on the bed, shoulder-length white hair splayed out on his pillow, back arching into a bridge. His change was forced, ears lengthened into snow-white furry points and a long fluffy white tail grew out from the base of his spine.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing his best friend scream Blaise awoke, his eyes instantly turning a feral red as he searched for what or who was hurting his brother in all but blood. No one hurt a vampire’s coven. When he looked at Draco his eyes calmed a little, shifting towards his natural golden brown. The blonde’s tail was bent at an odd angle underneath him, ripples of pain running down the slender frame.</p>
<p>Blaise jumped off his bed and knelt beside Draco just as Clara, his mother ran in. <br/>
<br/>
“What’s going on?” Clara exclaimed as she saw Draco panting and whimpering as Blaise rolled him over onto his stomach, freeing his tail.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t know,” Blaise gasped Draco’s shoulder attempting to waken him. “This has never happened before.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clara pulled out her wand and cast a diagnostic spell over the blonde, “Poor thing,” she said, “It looks like three bonds have awakened in his mind. We’ll just have to try and get him to sleep again. We can tell his parent’s what happened when they come for him tomorrow afternoon.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco was trapped in his own mind, awash with pain as the links flared to life. His mind bombarded with new information, sleep claimed him before he could focus on it too hard though.</p>
<p><u>Snape House, First Floor, Potions Laboratory</u> <br/>
<br/>
Severus Snape was standing in his lab quietly brewing when he collapsed on the floor. A pained whimper escaped his lips as he felt all the links in his mind throb before flaring wide open. The sudden onslaught of sensation and emotions caused his legs to shift, melting together as his pants tore and fell to the stone floor beneath him. He clung to the workbench, gently lowering himself to the ground as his dark magenta tail could no longer support him. He groaned as the dry air hit his scales. Mermen were not supposed to change out of water. <br/>
<br/>
He stripped off his shirt and apparated out of his lab and to his indoor, freshwater pool. A slight feeling of annoyance settled in his gut as his mind counted the seconds it took for his potion to spoil. Taking a deep breath in he let go of the aggravation and began to swim around the pool. After swimming for a few moments, the throbbing in his head and tail lessened and he realized exactly how tired he was after the transformation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus swam over to a large rock that lay just behind the magical waterfall coming from high up in the air of the room. Pulling himself up onto the rock he kept the delicate tail fin in the water while the rest of his body was sprawled out on the cool rock, mist from the waterfall dancing over his exposed scales. He lay his head on his arms before he closed his eyes and smiled; a faint purring filling his mind from one of the links. He fell asleep as he listened to all of his mates in his mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry woke with the morning sun, groaning at the bright light streaming through the daises. The muscles in his back and legs protested loudly as he forced himself to his knees and off the ground. He noticed that the muscles around his shoulder blades and lower back were particularly stiff as moved toward his Aunt and Uncle’s house. With his muscles screaming at him and an odd headache throbbing in his skull he forgot about the yard work he was supposed to finish the night before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the time he got to the large closet that his relatives had called his bedroom he had begun to feel twitching in his shoulders and lower back muscles; reminding him of the familiar sensations from the night before. He must have overworked himself and passed out. It had been unusually hot outside the night before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slumping onto his cot, he worked at convincing himself he was fine and that nothing odd had happened to him in the night. Suddenly, his entire back began twitching again, streaks of pain shooting through the muscles and down into his bones. Slipping forward onto his hands and knees, he gasped at the sensation of something snapping out of his shoulders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When his breath finally returned with a more bearable level of pain, he reached a hand back over his shoulder. His hand made contact with <em>something</em>. Fingers lightly travelled down the protrusions as his head whipped to the right, coming face to face with a large, leathery, black and green wing. Something shifted behind him as he knelt back, and he looked down by his hip. Below the bottom edge of another wing, he could see a tail that matched his wings. Dense black scales on the top, rich forest green underside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had wings and a tail. What in bloody hell?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He fought a surge of panic down and tried to remember what Hermione had told him about her research into wizarding culture. Something about an inheritance that occurred on a magicals 17<sup>th</sup>birthday. Some people had creature ancestors and the genes that had been passed on could be activated by their magical inheritance on their first adult birthday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He crawled to his school trunk at the foot of his bed, rummaging until he found a small hand mirror. He stared at his reflection in shock. His eyes were no longer a bright green, now they were a dark jade colour with swirls of silver and black. His face was more angular than before, black and dark green scales creeping over his forehead, cheekbones and jaw from his hairline. It was odd though; from the pictures of his parents, he didn’t remember either of them having a square chin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His hair hadn’t changed much. It was still short and spiky, the same shade of midnight black as before. His skin, on the other hand, had changed, it was now a rich golden brown instead of the previous creamy pink. Looking down at himself he could see he had bulked out, his muscles larger and more defined as well. More scales traced down his throat, fading out over his shoulders and chest. He noticed scales around his joints mostly, wrapping around his hands, feet and hips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hearing his Aunt begin to move around as she got ready for the day dragged him from his thoughts. He relaxed a little as he heard the shower start; he had time. His Aunt took long showers, and it was a Saturday, so his Uncle and cousin wouldn’t be up for a few hours. His poor attempt at working in the garden wouldn’t be discovered until then. His Aunt hated punishing him herself, leaving the dirty work for her husband.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An odd twinge of amusement filled him. He was worrying about being punished for not doing his chores when he had wings and a tail. It was absurd!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry knew he had to get rid of his new appendages before his relatives saw them; Merlin knew what they would do to him. As he considered how to get rid of them, his muscles began flexing painfully. A strange pulling sensation began around his shoulder blades and tail bone and he turned his head to watch his wings disappear into his back. A final twist proved that his tail had hidden itself too. Well, that solved that problem.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was brought out of his thoughts by a tapping at his window. A regal looking brown owl was sitting on the only remaining bar attached to his window. He went over and opened the window. It swooped in, dropped a letter, and swooped back out without waiting for a reply or a treat. Harry raised an eyebrow at the odd bird and shut the window before collecting the letter from the floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was the Gringotts seal, which he promptly cracked to open the letter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Dear Mister Potter,</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p align="center">

Please gather any relevant documentation and prepare to be portkeyed to Gringotts. Once arrived, request to see your account manager: Matterhorn.

</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="center">
  <em>Sincerely,</em>

</p>
<p>Harry was confused, since when did he have accounts at Gringotts? As far as he knew he only had the one vault that his parents had left him. Knowing he didn’t have much time and that this could be his only chance, he waved his wand, directing all his possessions into his trunk. Another wave and the trunk locked itself, before shrinking down and flying into his palm to be tucked into his pocket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the letter begin to glow. He reached out and grabbed his letter just in time to feel a tug behind his navel, and then he was gone from his Aunt and Uncle’s perfect house.</p>
