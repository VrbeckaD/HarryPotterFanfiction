    <p>"James! James! You need to get up now!"</p><p>For a minute, James can't work out where this voice is coming from, why someone is shaking his shoulder when it's the middle of the night. And then he lifts his head up, bleary-eyed and blind, as Peter pulls back the curtains and the morning sun streams through. There's a cacophony of swearing from the bed to his right, and even in his sleep-deprived state, James knows Sirius didn't receive any prior warning about the light.</p><p>"Peter, fuck off, you little-"</p><p>"We all need to get to breakfast! Remember?" Peter insists. "James, you need to get up!"</p><p>"I am, I am…promise…"</p><p>Last night James was a stag, but this morning he's even slower than a sloth. The nights after a full moon takes it out of them all, but last night was particularly bad. James has forgotten just how bad, until he comes to wash his face under the tap and feels his left cheek stinging. There's a throbbing in his shoulder too, something he's going to have to remember to heal before Quidditch practise tonight. James won't complain though. The one who had it worst was Remus, although at least he was allowed a proper lie-in in the hospital wing. What James wants, more than anything, as he pokes himself in the eye trying to convince his glasses to sit on his nose, is just to go back to bed. But he's seen the determined look on Peter's face and knows he won't allow it.</p><p>Last month after the full moon, James and Sirius were forced to sit next to the Slytherin table in Potions. Along with the blood traitor comments and taunts about the upcoming Gryffindor-Slytherin match, there was Snape, making oblique references to their frequent absences at breakfast after a full moon, as well as the conspicuous absence of Moony. James and Sirius received a week of detentions for putting Snape in the hospital wing, and then they suffered through an uncharacteristically angry Remus, who'd had to endure Snape all day once he got there. So they couldn't sneak off to the kitchens, as they wanted. It had been agreed they'd take it in turns to wake the others up, in the spirit of fairness. Except – and James knows this because Sirius whined so much about it yesterday – it's Sirius' turn, not Peter's. And yet it's Peter who woke him up this morning.</p><p>"So Padfoot, why didn't you get us up this morning? It was your turn," James says as he stumbles around, trying to spot his tie on the bedroom floor.</p><p>The glare Sirius gives him could have set his hair on fire, if James hadn't been so immune to it after six years. "Peter wanted to do it."</p><p>James says, aghast at the thought, "He volunteered for this?"</p><p>"It's not like I was going to argue with him, is it?" Sirius says through a yawn. "Merlin, let's just go to breakfast so he stops acting like a prick."</p><p>Now it's Peter's turn to glare and this time James can feel heat. He's not used to Peter getting arsey with them.</p><p>Sirius laughs at it, making Peter snap, "For Remus, remember?"</p><p>"Peter", says Sirius, "you are exceptionally twitchy this morning. Are you sure you don't still have the tail?" He starts laughing again, walking past James to the door. "Oh!" His voice changes suddenly. "Morning Evans. What d'you want?"</p><p>Both Peter and James' heads snap in the direction of the door. James' brain suddenly thinks I wish I'd tidied up. His body, however, has muscle memory. His hand jumps automatically to his hair, not that it needs it this morning. Pain snakes up his shoulder in protest, but the whole of James suddenly feels lighter, brighter, as if Evans' name alone casts a spell on him.</p><p>None of them fails to miss her happy reply, "I want to see James!"</p><p>James. James.</p><p>The sound of his name in her voice – his first name, no less – makes his heart jump into his throat.</p><p>Sirius ducks his head back through the door to give him a Look. It's something James can't read, partly due to sleep-deprivation, and partly because Sirius has never given his that Look before. But then Sirius doesn't have to clarify.</p><p>Evans pushes past him, following Sirius' gaze to James' face. "Oh!" She giggles and then blushes.</p><p>What is happening?</p><p>James is rooted to the floor. In fact, he's not entirely sure he's not still dreaming.</p><p>"Hi, James," she says softly, and then biting her lip as she looks at him, with a look he's never, ever seen on her face before. If he didn't know any better, he'd say it was…lovey.</p><p>"Erm…hi, Evans." he stumbles. He looks over her head to Sirius, but Sirius is just as perturbed as he is.</p><p>At the sound of his voice, Evans blushes red again. "Oh James," she breathes. "Call me Lily."</p><p>All right, he's dreaming. He's dreaming because there's no way in hell this is happening. He opens his mouth to say it, but his traitorous tongue comes out with only -</p><p>"Lily," he says, and suddenly he realises that her eyes have slid to his mouth.</p><p>Then she launches herself at him and kisses him hard.</p>
