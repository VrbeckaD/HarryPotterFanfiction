    <p>The piercing whistle of the Hogwarts Express signaled to any late student that the train would be leaving any second, and Pete Wentz was hurrying to quickly board the train. His chronic lateness was always a problem, and this was no exception. </p><p>Cedric Diggory, Luke Hemmings, Hayley Williams and Ashley Frangipane sat around a table together, quietly talking and laughing among themselves, grateful to finally be in their last year at Hogwarts. Dallon Weekes walked into the compartment and Cedric's eyes lit up, smiling at him as he called to his friend down the aisle. </p><p>"Dallon!" Dallon turned to see his friends calling him over and smiled back at them, ducking as a paper airplane from some first year flew over his head. He walked down the aisle towards them, joining his friends as they greeted each other after not seeing each other all summer.</p><p>Nearby, Brendon Urie sighed with his chin in his hand, watching the beautiful boy walk down next to him, his scent wafting through his nose and he frowned as Dallon sat down next to Ashley, who smiled and gave him a side hug from where he was sitting. God, Dallon smelled so good. Some sort of mix of a musky cologne with the fresh clean scent of laundry detergent, and it made Brendon feel a certain way he couldn't quite describe. </p><p>"You've got a bit of drool on your chin, Brendon." Spencer Smith nudged him and he rolled his eyes, scoffing and shoving his best friend. </p><p>"You guys don't understand," he mumbled. </p><p>"This is ridiculous, Brendon. You've been pining after him like a little schoolgirl for a year," Patrick Stump said, who sat across from Brendon, Spencer and Sarah Orzechowski on the other side of Spencer. Ryan Seaman sat beside Patrick, smirking at the conversation he knew was about to take place. </p><p>"You've gotta talk to him at some point," Spencer said. </p><p>"No I don't." Brendon crossed his arms. "He's tall, and gorgeous, smart, probably straight and definitely out of my league. If I even tried to talk him, he would probably just laugh at me and I don't think I can handle that kind of rejection. I'm fragile, okay?"</p><p>Patrick rolled his eyes and was about to reply, but suddenly Pete was behind him, slightly out of breath from running onto the train in time and wrapped his arms around Patrick, kissing his cheek and forehead. "Hey there baby, did you miss me all summer?" </p><p>Patrick's demeanor immediately changed and he hugged Pete back, staring lovingly into his eyes. "You know I did, Petey. I've been warming up this seat just for you." He scooted over to make room for Pete, who sat down immediately. Spencer and Sarah gagged at the two of them. Brendon rolled his eyes in disgust and Ryan wolf-whistled, being the only one who encouraged the two of them. </p><p>No, they weren't actually together. Sometime during Year 3, this had become a thing between Pete and Patrick, acting like a cringey couple just to annoy their friends. Ryan was the only one who was fine with it, actually finding it incredibly entertaining to watch how the rest of his friends reacted to it. </p><p>Brendon and his friends had finally reached their sixth year at Hogwarts, and although they still had another two years ahead, they were all looking forward to getting into their careers, as much fun as the school was for them. Brendon certainly wasn't looking forward to an entire year as a seventh year not being able to admire Dallon everyday when he'd be off pursuing his own wizarding career. </p><p>The entire train ride to Hogwarts, he wasn't paying much attention to the conversation between his friends. He was like always, watching Cedric and Dallon talking to each other down the aisle, neither of them seeming to be aware of the younger boy watching them. Their friend group was used to this. Brendon was always distracted by something; he was possibly one of the worst cases of ADHD any of them had ever seen. It seemed like the only thing that he could ever focus on was watching Dallon and daydreaming about him. </p><p>When they got to the school, about half of his friend group retreated to their own houses' table in the Great Hall. Brendon, Spencer, Ryan and their other friends Andy Hurley and Ashton Irwin were all in Hufflepuff, along with Cedric. Sarah and Patrick were in Dallon's house, Ravenclaw, with his other friends Luke and Ashley. Pete was the only Slytherin in their friend group, who took great pride in his house, and was always bragging that since he was the only Slytherin that he was therefore the most superior. Andy's friends Michael Clifford and Calum Hood were Slytherin as well, but Brendon's friends didn't hang out with them much. Then there was Joe Trohman, another one of Andy's friends, the only Gryffindor any of them even kind-of associated with much. </p><p>Except Harry Potter and Brendon, but that was a story for another time. </p><p>Brendon fidgeted through the sorting of the first years, uninterested. He didn't care much for younger students, finding them all pretty annoying. He ate a lot for dinner, like always, and walked back to the Hufflepuff common room slowly with his friends, thinking about Dallon as he did. He walked in with Cedric and immediately could smell the marijuana his friends were already smoking. Spencer was seated at one of the tables, a joint in his hand that he took a puff from before handing it to Brendon. He flopped onto one of the chairs, taking a hit from the joint as well before passing it to Cedric. </p><p>"Are you planning on going to that party that Pete invited us to?" Spencer asked as Brendon sighed and leaned back. </p><p>"I don't know. Dallon--"</p><p>"Will be there." Cedric smiled at him. "Dallon loves parties, I've told you this before. And the first one of the year, he definitely wouldn't miss." </p><p>"I know he's probably going to be there," Brendon replied, rolling his eyes. "It's just that I know if I go, Dallon will be there and I'll probably get drunk and do something I regret and make a complete fool of myself in front of him." </p><p>"I don't understand why you act like Dallon is some judgmental god-like being," Cedric said, standing up after taking one more hit from the joint. "He's one of the most laid back people I've ever met."</p><p>"I also heard Harry Potter will be there for some fucking reason," Spencer said, handing the joint to Brendon. Cedric raised his eyebrows at Brendon's blushing cheeks. </p><p>"Harry Potter at a Slytherin party? Not likely." Brendon stood up as well, attempting to put a quick end to the conversation. "Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be going to sleep now. For some fucking reason I got put in advanced potions and I have to prepare myself for the worst." </p><p>Brendon's worst class was definitely potions, so he had no idea why he was put into the advanced class. He didn't complain when he realized that Cedric and Dallon were also in this class, sitting together as he walked in. Dallon looked up from where he and Cedric were laughing about something, looking directly at Brendon. He thought he might drop dead, <em>Merlin, </em>Dallon had the most beautiful smile he had ever seen. Brendon quickly found a spot next to Pete near the back of the classroom, who looked far too excited to be there. Pete was actually not bad at potions, and Brendon didn't understand. Pete was probably the least intelligent of their entire friend group and was still way better than he was. Brendon was sure that if he had to stay in this class all year that he'd end up burning the entire school down. </p><p>Brendon sat in the library studying after his classes, attempting to focus but unable to do so as Dallon was putting books away, picking random ones up and flipping through them, occasionally sitting down with one and looking through it more thoroughly. He would glance back at Brendon every now and then, who pretended to not be looking until Dallon turned back to what he was doing. He just couldn't bring himself to talk to Dallon. He was too cool, too smart, and too popular for him. Everyone knew who Dallon was, everyone knew how smart he was and everyone knew how attractive he was. Not to mention he was always with Ashley. It only made sense that they were together. </p><p>Brendon decided to go to that stupid Slytherin party, since Spencer really wanted him to go. He sat with him in the Slytherin common room where a bunch of students were drinking, talking about how excited they were for Quidditch to begin, some Slytherins starting to get a little too risky with dares they were receiving, and a small group of Hufflepuffs sat in the corner passing a joint among themselves. He didn't see Dallon anywhere in sight, so he decided maybe getting a little drunk wouldn't be a terrible idea. </p><p>"Yeah!" Patrick cheered as Brendon took his third shot of the night, patting him on the back as he chased it with a cup of pumpkin juice being shoved into his hands. Brendon giggled as he felt the alcohol coursing through his blood, sitting down as he felt the effects really beginning to take action on his body. Patrick, Spencer, Ryan, Pete and Sarah were all sat together, most of them moderately drunk, amazed that Brendon was able to get so fucked up with such a small amount of alcohol in his system. </p><p>"You are even more of a lightweight than Sarah," Ryan laughed at Brendon trying to use a charm to create birds, which he was usually good at, but failing miserably in his drunken state and made flying fish instead, flopping around on the ground in front of them. Spencer, who was laughing at Brendon as well, used his wand to destroy the awful charm and made the fish burst into dust. </p><p>Brendon then saw Dallon and Cedric enter the room and greet their friends, Brendon's heart leaping to his throat. He hadn't realized just how much he was staring until Patrick waved a hand in front of his face. </p><p>"Brendon, you are probably one of the thirstiest bitches I know," Patrick said, Brendon finally looking away to see his entire group of friends now paying attention to their conversation. </p><p>"He just wants Dallon to fuck him," Pete said, patting Patrick's shoulder. "But I mean, who doesn't?" </p><p>"No way, Brendon would want to take things slow with Dallon," Sarah defended. "He can't even talk to him, how would he even be able to fuck him?" </p><p>"Yeah but he's a virgin, so he wants it really bad from Dallon," Patrick argued. </p><p>Spencer laughed loudly, and Brendon shot him a look but it was too late. "No he's not!" </p><p>"What?!" Everyone in the group looked shocked. </p><p>"With who?" Patrick asked.</p><p>"Last year, Harry Potter." Spencer crossed his arms. </p><p>"Okay, that's quite enough now." Brendon was drunk but he definitely wasn't drunk enough to have this conversation just yet. </p><p>"No way." Pete shook his head. "Brendon was obsessed with Dallon all last year." </p><p>"Yes, but you guys can't tell me you didn't see how Brendon acted with Harry last year," Spencer said. "It happened many times." </p><p>Brendon's mind flashed back to the year before, and how he would watch Harry closely whenever he was around, every class they had together, every time he'd see him in the Great Hall. And Hermione Granger, how annoying it was that she was always giving him warning looks like she would hex him if he ever got near Harry. But Harry knew, and he was the one who approached Brendon first, which ended in them hooking up in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom (ironic, they both knew). And a one time thing turned into a casual thing. And a casual thing turned into a regular thing. And then before Brendon knew it, they were hooking up multiple times a week for a solid few months before they both mutually agreed to end it seeing as they both had rather strong feelings for other people. They ended up becoming pretty decent friends because of it. </p><p>"I don't believe you," Pete said. "No way, there's no way you got Harry Potter to fuck you. That's like, every gay wizard's dream." </p><p>"Okay, yeah. We had a sort of friends-with-benefits thing going on for a couple months last year," Brendon admitted. "And it was brilliant, for the record, and no one knew about it which made it even better. Snape nearly caught us once though."</p><p>"Okay, I need details," Ryan said, scooting closer. "What was the best experience you had? Like, say the kinkiest?" </p><p>Brendon thought for a moment. "Well there was one time he bent me over the sink in Myrtle's bathroom." </p><p>"And all along everyone thought it was Myrtle moaning in there," Sarah interrupted. </p><p>"He likes pulling hair," Brendon added. "And hickeys, but not in visible spots. Like, on your thighs and chest." </p><p>"Hot," Ryan smiled and nodded, and Spencer rolled his eyes. </p><p>"It's really annoying being the only straight person in the group sometimes, you know. Where is Cedric when you need him?" </p><p>"Getting drunk with Dallon," Pete said. "What a shame, Brendon. If you weren't such a hoe then Dallon could have been your first time."</p><p>"Okay first of all, Harry Potter being my first time is quite an accomplishment if you ask me," Brendon defended. </p><p>"True." Pete nodded. "Do you think you could ask Harry to fuck me in the ass too?" </p><p>"And second of all, Dallon and I will never end up together," Brendon said, ignoring Pete's comment. "Like I've said before, he's way out of my league. I mean, look at him." </p><p>Dallon was laughing with Cedric and Hayley, a drink in his hand while he watched Draco Malfoy attempting to give Harry a lap dance. He looked incredibly uncomfortable and confused beyond explanation as he tried to move out from under the blonde boy. </p><p>"Looks like Draco is trying to steal your man," Patrick teased and Brendon rolled his eyes. He wasn't even watching Harry. He was watching Dallon and the smile on his face as he brought his drink to his lips and took a sip, laughing as Hayley danced all over Ashley, who was bright red but also laughing at her clearly intoxicated friend. Dallon looked over and made eye contact with Brendon, smiling bigger and giving a small wave. Brendon quickly looked away, staring at the ground in front of him. He looked behind him, a few people looking past him at the life of the party where Dallon and his friends were. Surely, he was waving at someone else. He sighed and stood up. </p><p>"I'm going to bed," he announced, stumbling a little before he walked quickly towards the exit of the Slytherin common room, watching out for teachers before he began walking back to the Hufflepuff common room.</p><p>"Brendon!" He heard Patrick behind him, and turned to see his close friend running to catch up with him. "Hey, let me walk you back. You're pretty messed up, mate." </p><p>Brendon didn't try to argue as he let Patrick walk him back to the common room, and helped him up the stairs to his dorm. He flopped down on his bed, Patrick helping him take his shoes off. </p><p>"Why does it have to be me?" Brendon asked as he rolled onto his side and Patrick took the glasses off of his face to set on the table next to his bed. "I don't understand why I couldn't have just fallen for some nice Hufflepuff guy who is a loser just like me." </p><p>"Because Brendon," Patrick sighed, sitting on the bed next to him. "That would be too easy. And besides, you've got an entire friend group of losers. Especially Pete and I." </p><p>"I like him so much, Patrick." Brendon suddenly felt the urge to cry. "And I'll never have a chance with him."</p><p>"I know." Patrick rubbed Brendon's arm while a few tears fell from his eyes, down his cheeks and onto his pillow. "I wouldn't say never, Brendon. You just have to get up the courage and go talk to him. Cedric's right, he really is a nice guy." </p><p>"Too bad I'm a fucking pussy," Brendon sniffed and wiped his tears away. </p><p>Patrick laughed softly. "Yeah you are. But hey, you have accomplished something great for being such a loser." </p><p>Brendon looked at Patrick skeptically.</p><p>"You had sex with Harry Potter many times. Kinky sex. In Myrtle's bathroom." </p><p>Brendon managed to smile. "Yeah, I did." </p>
