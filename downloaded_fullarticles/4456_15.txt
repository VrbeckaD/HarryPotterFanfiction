    <p>The aimless chatter and tinkling giggles falling from the lips of children that blossomed in the air of the parlour was a sound that made Marcus feel at home. Watching dainty little faces press up to the glass as their chubby fingers pointed desperately towards the flavour of ice cream they desired was a regular sight; Marcus knew his day wouldn’t be complete if he didn’t spend a total of thirty minutes running a cloth over the display case to clear off saliva or fingerprints. He knew that, if he had the time or desire, Marcus could set up a ‘Work Bingo’ where he ticked off events that occurred every day without fail. From young families rushing in, dressed in their shorts and sandals with a waterproof now covering their upper half, to escape the rain to a young child dropping their cone on the floor, there were endless scenarios that Marcus had become all too familiar with during his two years working at the parlour.</p><p>From a wizarding world war survivor to a Muggle retail worker, Marcus had found not only comfort but also happiness behind the counter of <em>Pine Cones Ice Cream Parlour</em>. Known locally as <em>Coney’s</em>, the parlour was owned, and previously run single-handedly, by dairy extraordinaire Mr Ernest Pine. Mr Pine had hand crafted all twenty of the original flavours sold in the parlour and prided himself in only using second-hand furniture purchased from the plethora of charity shops tucked in among the bustling high street to fill his shop. There were tables scattered within the parlour for families of all sizes, the most popular area being the strip by the wall of windows looking out to the North Shore and the lengthy promenade outlining the sandy beach. It was only as the parlour became more popular and Mr Pine came near retirement age that he began hiring external workers to help during the summer months.</p><p>Marcus was one of the four workers Mr Pine had recruited and, to his knowledge, the only wizard he’d unknowingly hired. Currently serving a cherub-faced girl behind the counter was Oscar Breves, the first to be brought in to the parlour; he boasted a blood relation to Mr Pine through being his grandson but consistently denied the notion that being family was the reason he was employed. His skin was pale cream in colour despite being showered in sun most of the days, the lack of pigment resulting in his shadowed blue eyes not being highlighted as much as they would if he were more sun-kissed. Oscar hadn’t a plan for his future, just went about his life day-by-day; the only sort of preparation he did for the days ahead was deciding what obnoxiously coloured Hawaiian shirt he would wear to work. Beside him in front of the free counter hastily stirring milk into a too-full cup of coffee was Valentina Cantú. Her russet-coloured skin, swimming with ethereal olive undertones, was darker than normal from the countless hours she spent in the sun collecting rocks and shells from the beaches. As a way to cure her occasional homesickness, having moved from Mexico to Wales to study at the University of Cardiff before dropping out after feeling as though she wasn’t challenged enough, Valentina frequented the sandy shores early in the dawn right until the latest dusk. She had a natural talent for making the perfect cup of tea, perfectly sweet while still inhibiting the deep flavour that any British person desired, a skill that the rest of the <em>Coney’s</em> cohort took advantage of during their breaks with her. Lastly, currently restocking the fridge to the side of the main ice cream case, stood Florence Whittaker. The name badge pinned to her navy pinafore read 'Flo’, the nickname she most commonly used and preferred. Flo arrived on the deadline for the job applications at <em>Coney’s</em> after leaving her wealthy London-based family following a dramatic argument surrounding her career choice. The Whittaker’s were well-known for their history of always having a neurosurgeon in every generation, the profession which had led to their prestige status within the country. Florence was the only child of her father’s generation and, much to his disappointment, she had an inkling for art and had chosen to pursue a career in a commission based path rather than the expected medicine. Her father had tried and tried to convince her to take up medicine but she withheld, using her money to purchase art supplies and time to teach herself the techniques she’d need to be successful. Her leaving the home was a predetermined fact right from when she was born, it just took fate some time to catch up before sending Flo on her way to wherever it best seemed fit.</p><p>As a foursome they worked well together; they were a close-knit group of friends of which Marcus was very grateful for. Moving from his home in an environment full of people like him to somewhere with a minute wizarding community was a terrifying task alone, having a group around him to keep him company as he adjusted to this new way of life was ideal. They were all pulled together by one defining feature: their lack of planning for the future. One hidden wizard isolated from the world where he belonged, one dawdling hipster exploiting his grandfather’s success, one university drop out struggling to feel fulfilled and one trust fund baby gone wrong, all four of them had found themselves in this corner of the universe based on their non-existent preparations for adulthood.</p><p>But, despite all that, <em>Pine Cones Ice Cream Parlour</em> was the perfect place for them all to reside. Settled right on the northern coast of Wales, <em>Coney’s</em> belonged to the corner spot of the high street in the little seaside town Llandudno. Enclosed by two mountainous forms called the Great and Little Orme, Llandudno was additionally sandwiched between two contrasting beaches, making it the perfect location for any stereotypical British holiday. The North Shore, viewable from the sit-down portion of <em>Coney’s</em>, revealed a perfectly curved sandy surface with an array of differently shaped, coloured and sized rocks hidden within and above the granules of sand. To the left hand side of the shore, parallel to the dominating presence of the Great Orme, proudly stood the Llandudno pier, reaching its spindly supports deep into the cerulean sea below. Two arcades defined the start and the end of the rickety pier and in between boasted a handful of independent, minuscule shops selling one of a kind knickknacks as well as several amusement park-like rides for younger children. Bordering the beach on the opposite side of the town was the Little Orme, a structure visibly smaller than its counterpart, but much more wild and adventurous for the tourists who enjoyed embracing the natural side of the country. Curving the path between the two Orme’s spread the coral-coloured bricks of the Promenade. Seemingly infinitely long in length for young rascals who <em>just</em> wanted an ice cream, the Promenade was home to several shelters looking out at the glittering sea as well as offering a public space for church groups, charity collectors and seagulls to interact with the public who year round crossed the length of the brickwork. The first line of buildings looking directly on to the beach consisted mainly of multi-coloured pastel hotels and bed and breakfasts; many of the structures had been there for longer than the location had been a working holiday town, a fact which appeared in the foreground of their advertising. The remaining few buildings were café’s, an occasional fish and chip shop and the nationally renowned <em>Coney’s Ice Cream Parlour</em>. Hidden on the opposite side of the town, unbeknownst to many who visited, was the West Shore beach. Much sandier than its companion, West Shore was the picture perfect image of a beach; families of sand dunes lined the gap between road and shore and the lonesome café serving warm snacks to the occasional visitors were the only notable landmarks surrounding the beach. It was a lot less popular but much more desirable in terms of practicality and being an ideal holiday location. Alas, much like the wonderful and necessary things in life, West Shore always welcomed less visitors than the North Shore, leaving the picturesque views of distant islands and risk-taking windsurfers only pleasing the occasional jellyfish that passed by the shallows.</p><p>Everything about the little town tucked away in a never ending list of seaside towns was idealistic and tranquil. The curling waves crashing on the rocky shores to the bubbling arcades situated throughout the town as well as along the pier were all pivotal in allowing the town to thrive in the way it did. If Marcus had to pick a single flaw with the place he now considered home, it would be the fact that there was nobody else his age aside from his co-workers and an occasional tag-along sibling accompanying a family holiday. The secluded location was perfect for families seeking a week’s refuge away from the hustle and bustle of daily life as well as elderly couples looking to retire; but, for the younger generations wanting to step on to the career ladder, sparse working opportunities presented themselves save agriculture, tourism and the emergency services. The second those in their early twenties could afford to, they sailed off into the sunset to either the capital, Cardiff, or further inland where they could prosper in a profession of their choice.</p><p>It’s why the four of them were really the only citizens of their age in the little town. With minimal aspiration to pursue a traditional career they had no reason to leave the seaside, especially when they had a stable job in <em>Coney’s</em> and each other to experience the world with. Marcus loved it, actually. Escaping to this perfect area of the world where there was a dwindling magic community allowed him to heal in the way he needed.</p><p>The feelings of the war still struck him raw when he found himself renting a little apartment above the only bakery along the high street. He may not have suffered the severities of the war in the way that most of his friends and acquaintances had, but he still witnessed all the death, the evil and the pain that shadowed their community. He heard of families being torn apart at the seams as their children were attacked at school, watched as everyone sheltered in fear to avoid the dark forces attempting the penetrate their innocence every day. Those sights and sounds would haunt any normal person; Marcus found it difficult to stay in that environment even after everything had cleared. He couldn’t walk out into the streets listening to an optimistic, young wizard babble about how excited they were to start school the following September. He couldn’t hold his wand in his hand without shaking, thinking about the spells he had previously cast at any faceless figure passing in front of him during the Battle.</p><p>So he packed up his bags, apparated to the middle of nowhere and found his way to the sandy shores he now called home. It was intimidating at first, gradually introducing himself to a new variation of people and finding his feet in the drastically different location, but he wouldn’t change what had happened for the world.</p><p>“Earth to Flint,” a smooth voice accompanied a gentle scratch to his scalp. Marcus blinked, waking himself from yet another daydream. “And he’s back. Where were you off to this time?”</p><p>“Back in Scotland again,” Marcus offered; it had become a running joke within the group, given how many times they caught Marcus lost in a trance, that he was dreaming of being somewhere else and every time he was interrupted he named somewhere in the world. Recently, though, he had found himself settled back in Scotland, back near Hogwarts, wishing for something he couldn’t quite put his finger on. “Sorry, Flo.”</p><p>“S'alright, gorgeous. You were staring so intently at the teapots I knew you’d work through your lunch break,” Flo smiled, violet painted lips curled into sympathetic yet friendly expression. “Valentina has already gone for hers. See you in an hour.”</p><p>“See you in an hour.” Said Marcus, gently pinching Flo’s perfectly freckled cheeks. He pulled off his candy floss coloured apron, the whole parlour had a pastel theme, and exchanged it for his jacket which he pulled on as he left the building and stepped into the bustling traffic of the high street. Despite knowing he could stay in the break room for his lunch, Marcus used this hour to absorb his daily intake of magic; there was a hidden wizarding teashop around the corner, tucked between the buildings in a style similar to the Leaky Cauldron. Although he never cast any enchantments anymore or regularly engaged with this part of this life, he enjoyed reading the Daily Prophet every day to keep up to date with everything happening in the secret part of his life.</p><p>Marcus gently shouldered the black door open, smiling as the suffocating smell of Butterbeer flooded his senses and his eyes flicked around the multi-coloured robes decorating the hooks near the entrance. If Marcus were to ever leap back into his old life and fully envelop himself back in the world of magic, the first place he would go to begin the transfer would be this very place: <em>The Common Welsh Green Tea Shop. </em>Behind the bar stood the owner and workers of the teashop flicking their wands back and forth to send the cups cascading into the sink to be washed and bewitching sugar cubes to drop correspondingly into drinks they were preparing. The shop consisted mainly of high tables surrounded by bar stools where the witches and wizards who were passing through monotonously sipped on their drinks and nibbled at the few delicacies the shop supplied. Every day they had a new stash of the current <em>Daily Prophet</em> edition, the height of which declined and rose as all individuals flicked through the pages cover to cover before returning it to the counter as they left. The slightly shabby-looking place echoed magic; from the signed photographs of famous witches and wizards hung on the walls to the nostalgic confectionery snacks piled up at the cashier, Bertie Botts to Chocolate Frogs to Pepper Imps, wherever Marcus looked he was hit with a wave of remembrance and slight sadness at all he left behind.</p><p>“The usual Mister Marcus?”</p><p>“Ah, my little Seeker,” Marcus smiled, stepping over to the counter where, proudly stood behind the crumb-covered surface, Rory Davies looked admirably up at him. “The usual, please.”</p><p>“The usual for Mister Marcus, Mumma!” Rory screeched, startling the customers emotionlessly delving into their lunch. “Are you still coming to practice tonight?”</p><p>“Of course I am, I’m the manager after all.” Chuckled Marcus, digging into his back pocket to find the funds for his meal; he juggled through a variety of Muggle coins to get as many Sickles as he needed, checking to make sure he wasn’t going to accidentally hand over a five pence piece or something else that wouldn’t be valid. Despite working in a Muggle area, Marcus still paid for his apartment rent and occasional food with traditional wizarding mint. When he first arrived and found an apartment he could afford, Marcus was lucky enough to be living somewhere with a half-blood landlord who helped him exchange galleons for pounds and vice versa. It sometimes became rather complicated when Marcus, usually late in the morning, dished a few sickles into the hand of a barista when paying for his coffee instead of pound coins, having to hastily explain it was foreign money. But, in the long run, it helped him keep on top of things and have a small something connecting him to his life back <em>home.</em></p><p>Using wizarding money also allowed him to collect more income by training the local youth Quidditch team in their regional league. Being the only mid-twenties wizard in the town and, conveniently, the only one who ever played on his school’s Quidditch team, Marcus became the perfect candidate for the role after their previous manager moved to inland to play professionally. The Llandudno Lobalug’s trained every weekday save Wednesdays with a league game played on the Sundays; it was a sweet little set up that Marcus deeply enjoyed getting involved with, the shrill excitement that radiated from his players reminded him of when he first started playing Quidditch at Hogwarts and even earlier when he was gifted his first broomstick. Going out every late afternoon without telling his friends where he was really going made things a little complicated sometimes, (there were only so many excuses he could bring up as to what he was doing for an hour and a half every day), but wandering away to the wizarding part of the town made the slight bending of the truth worth it.</p><p>Little Rory cheered at Marcus’ response, accidentally fist-bumping into the cup of tea that his ‘Mumma’, the glorious Julia, owner of the tea shop, had brought over for Marcus. “Rors, baby, please be careful. I know you really like Mister Marcus and Quidditch, but we don’t make loud noises inside the shop, do we?” She reminded, voice effortlessly soft and gentle as she reinforced behaviour expectations into her son. Marcus was extraordinarily grateful for the Davies family, more so than they would ever know. When he first arrived here and found the teashop by pure coincidence they welcomed him with comforting, open arms. Rory had toddled over to him at the door and coiled his arms around Marcus’ right leg, almost cementing himself to the traveller before he even had time to say hello. Julia had practically thrown a hot cup of chocolate into his hand and demanded he stay for the evening until his feet were firmly on the ground and he had a place to stay. Despite not being where the action of the war was necessarily taking place, the Davies family and the other wizarding families settled in this region had all witnessed their fair share of Muggleborns hiding in their little upstairs apartments to watching Death Eaters soar like a chilling black cloud through the air. Julia saw Marcus for what he was: a troubled, alone wizard looking for somewhere to start fresh.</p><p>“No, we don’t. Sorry, Mumma.” There was an essence of genuine apology somewhere in Rory’s voice, but as soon as he was handed a Dragon shaped cookie to keep him quiet he was a silenced, distant presence only worried about the sugary food he was given to eat.</p><p>“You look a little far off today, my love,” Julia confessed, voice over-powered slightly by the chunking cashier as she took Marcus’ money and processed it. “Almost as if there’s something on your mind.”</p><p>Marcus climbed up to his regular seat, one of the comfier bar stools adjacent to the counter; he had spent countless hours sat on the topaz-coloured stool conversing smoothly with Julia and other customers he had come to recognise. “Missing home a bit, I think. I haven’t been back in two years, have only communicated by weekly letters. But I know if I go back then I’ll want to move back completely and… I’m just not ready for it, I don’t think. Nor do I <em>really</em> want to leave this place. You know what it’s like, living in an urban wizarding area.”</p><p>“That’s why I moved here,” shrugged Julia, enchanting her milk pot and sugar cubes to finish her cup of tea so she could continue talking; the mug, after everything was mixed in to perfection, scooted over the counter towards her and turned so the grey, ceramic handle was facing her spindly fingertips. “If you’re in an urban area you’re usually working for the Ministry. If not, you’re in St Mungo’s, Hogwarts or retail somewhere like Diagon Alley. You have a good deal here, I think. And, if you’re missing family, why not bring them out here? I’ve got a spare room they could use.”</p><p>“Exactly, everyone I went to school with is a miserable Ministry employee nowadays. I sometimes catch their names in the <em>Prophet </em>and wonder why they got involved with it to begin with,” Marcus chuckled, casting a glance over to the pile of papers situated on the opposite side of the counter. “I’ll consider asking if they want to come out here for a weekend or something like that. It’ll just be weird seeing them after everything that happened before I left.”</p><p>“I understand that,” Julia sipped her tea, looking over the curved rim at a slightly pale looking Marcus. “Do you have any friends who play Quidditch professionally?”</p><p>Marcus cocked up one eyebrow, shaking his head in response. “No? I don’t have any Quidditch playing friends. Well, old friends. Why?” He queried, circling a piece of his biscuit into the Butterbeer syrup the shop had introduced a short while ago. The taste always took him right back to weekends out at Hogsmeade with fellow Slytherin’s during his Hogwarts days, wandering the cobbled streets with their green scarves woven around their necks to keep the cool away from their skin.</p><p>“Front page of the <em>Prophet.</em> There’s a relatively important European Tournament happening up in Cardiff the next few weeks. Some of the teams are stopping nearby. I just wondered whether anyone from your Hogwarts cohort would be coming around.” Julia explained, collecting Marcus’ plate and mug immediately after he had emptied the contents of both.</p><p>“Oh, well- no. None that I can recall. Should be good for this place, though, having constant passing traffic of wizards and witches coming to see this tournament.” Marcus said, stretching out his muscles as he stood from the stool. He would be the first to admit that this teashop was one of the happiest places he had ever found, but he would <em>also </em>be the first to admit that the chairs weren’t particularly good for one’s back.</p><p>“Indeed it shall,” Julia smiled. “See you later?”</p><p>“Later.” Agreed Marcus, tossing a wave in her direction and two little finger guns in the way of Rory behind the counter as he trickled back out the teashop onto the high street. By the time Marcus’ lunch hour finished it was prime time along the long streets of the town; families fluttered past window displays, parents carrying supermarket bags loaded with picnic foods while their children clattered beside them with fistfuls of buckets, spades and kites – all sorts of beachside items. Being prime time, as expected, <em>Coney’s </em>reached their peak amount of customers. All the little tables would be packed with families happily munching away at their cool food to combat the beating heat hitting their burnt skin, some even standing in the shaded spaces to avoid melting their treat outside the shop.</p><p>Marcus volunteered to take early lunch so he, and Valentina, could work through the rush of customers. After working with the public for two years Marcus liked to think he had gathered some decent communication and customer service skills that made this portion of the day less stressful. He would reiterate <em>less</em> because it was purely impossible to not have a miniscule aneurism while watching a toddler play dominos with the cans of lemonade he had just organised in the fridge, or seeing a child carelessly drip their ice cream over the floor he’d spent the morning viciously scrubbing at. Marcus would also like to boast the fact that he handled the stress the best out of the four of them working in the parlour; Oscar often had a terrible outburst to himself, scaring not only the customers but also his co-workers, Valentina decided to just ignore the stress and mess and allow it all to pile up inside her while Flo often treated the customers poorly who caused the issue in the first place. Marcus believed he was the best at concealing and controlling his emotions, falsely saying “it’s no worry at all” to the ever so apologetic parents as he swiped his mop around the floor for the twentieth time that day.</p><p>“Thank <em>God</em> you’re back,” Flo was, as usual, flailing her hands in an over-dramatic style as Marcus walked back into the parlous. Her left hand was clenching a dripping wet ice cream scoop while the right decorated splashes of different sauces and syrups she’d been billowing onto the customer’s purchases. “Please save me. A child in the back corner has dropped two, <em>two</em>, consecutive cones on the floor. If I don’t go on my break right now I will probably kick him out.”</p><p>“Where’s Oscar? Couldn’t he clean the mess?” Marcus asked, tying his apron back around the slim figure of his waist; he gently pried the ice cream scoop from between Flo’s strikingly white fingertips, additionally damping a cloth to wipe off the mess glistening over her skin.</p><p>“He’s been unloading stock the last thirty minutes. I wouldn’t be surprised if he has already gone for his break.” Flo sighed, gladly whipping off her apron with such a careless motion she almost missed the hooks.</p><p>“Scurry along, my dear. I’ll handle the fort,” Marcus smiled, pressing a dainty kiss to the back of Valentina’s curled hair as he joined her behind the counter. “What’s to do then, Val?”</p><p>“You’re so infuriating, Marc,” Valentina oozed, flashing him a less than pleased, sarcastic grin. “If you’re going to shorten my name, you know I prefer Lena. Just like you prefer no shortened version at all.”</p><p>“I just like to rile you up.”</p><p>“I know,” Valentina sighed, playfully poking Marcus’ side. “I’ve got a table order for a Honeycomb Sundae and tea for two, there’s a child in the corner who keeps dropping his ice cream on purpose to annoy Flo and I need a fresh tub of the banana before I run out.”</p><p>“Honeycomb, child and banana. Right, I’ve got this. Give me a shout if the counter gets a little busy.”</p><p>And with that Marcus scuttled to the cabinets where they had the bowls and glasses organised, picking out the oval-shaped one they used for the variety of sundaes the parlour offered. He chose the cleanest scoop he could find from the pot of always soaking ones under the display cabinet and set about collecting two scoops of honeycomb ice cream, one vanilla and one chocolate. Marcus symmetrically placed two flakes on either side of the tower of ice cream, finishing the <em>masterpiece </em>off with a gentle swirl of salted caramel sauce.</p><p>Marcus enjoyed this aspect of his work the most; getting lost in his own thoughts as he constructed the ice creams that brought happiness to so many people made his sometimes tedious working days’ worth it. Watching as the children gaped in shock as he brought over their slim, chocolate sundaes or their bear-shaped ice cream cones sent his heart aflutter as he recalled the times when <em>he</em> would react in such a way. The shop made him feel nostalgic, reminded him of all the happiness he experienced when he was younger and reinforced how he had now come full circle to be the one of the production end of the cycle. Learning how to make the perfect cappuccino for the worn out mother yearning for a moments relaxation, perfectly swirling the green and purple flavoured slush to create a mystical frosty drink for the teenagers who glumly accompanied their families; there were so many elements to the customer service work that he didn’t think he would be able to appreciate if he were working anywhere else.</p><p>Were he a part-time employee in <em>The Welsh Green Tea Shop</em>, Marcus didn’t think he would get the satisfaction of seeing the food he had created. He had watched a countless amount of times as Julia exploited domestic spells to stir her ingredients, boil her water and even stock the shelves full of the sugary sweets they were locally famed for. For Marcus, part of the experience was driving his fingers numb scooping freezing ice cream into acceptably pretty piles before presenting them to someone who would instantly devour his artistic efforts.</p><p>Marcus placed the sundae on a circular tray alongside one of their sunflower yellow kettles and two accompanying patterned teacups, folding their branded napkins into the signature triangular shape; he picked up the tray and tucked a cloth into the waistband of his apron as he then manoeuvred through the buzzing shop to the tables he required. In an almost ballet-like routine, Marcus daintily set the tray down on the table between a teenage couple, whisked up the wooden spoon table setters the used and finally smoothed his cloth over the puddle of ice cream building up beside the mischievous child.</p><p>“So sorry to bother you,” Marcus began, tautly pulling his lips to his best customer-friendly smile. “But I must request you watch your son, this is the second time myself and my colleague have had to come and clean ice cream off the floor. If he persists I may have to request you eat outside.”</p><p>The mother was flustered, the father embarrassed and the child still playfully batting his ice cream covered spoon all over the table as Marcus flew back to behind the counter. His work day consisted mainly of those sorts of interactions; he would apologise for any inconvenience made by addressing the inconveniences other customers were making, speaking in an angelic voice to request they alter the behaviour before finally laying down the conditions. Between these small conversations with customers, he would scoop some ice cream, clean some surfaces and wash some glasses. It became quite monotonous and repetitive, but it was Marcus’ daily routine, and he would much rather be doing this than involving himself in some Magical Law Enforcement which required he read seven thick textbooks cover to cover before getting the lowest paid job available. Besides, though rather repetitive in action, the presences who blessed the parlour were different every day.</p><p>One day there would be a well-established couple holidaying with their three teenage children, all of whom looked far from pleased to be seated around a tiny table in the cramped parlour. Another day would reveal a youthful couple pushing an elaborately coloured pram into the parlour, sharing a sundae to themselves while occasionally offering a minute spoonful to the child sleeping heavenly in her bed of roses and cushions. There were infinite possibilities to the personalities who would walk through the door into <em>Coney’s</em>, the only aspect of them that Marcus could be sure of was that they would be walking to the counter more than once during their holiday.</p><p>As every other day preceding this particular one where Marcus’ life would unknowingly change forever, the daylight hours flew by and it seemed that just as he had returned from lunch they were taking the latches off the doors and letting them fall to a close. Oscar had flipped around the ‘Come in, we’re open!’ sign to the opposite side, ‘Sorry, come back soon!’ while Flo and Valentina had done a final sweep with their dustpans and broomsticks. From the back windows Marcus could see the beach still full with tourists basking in the late afternoon sun, the rising tide glittering with a rainbow of lights pooling over the surface from the pier towering above the waves. Their work day might have just ended but, for the public as well as themselves, their day was really only just beginning. Marcus knew that Oscar would be going out with some family friends for an evening meal, an event he had been complaining about for what felt like a lifetime, whereas Florence and Valentina would be acting as each other’s partners for a customer’s wedding reception. They would be attending on behalf of all the <em>Coney’s</em> staff who had supplied an ice cream van before and after the ceremony; the invitation had been extended to all four of them but, having to lie through his teeth again, Marcus had to excuse himself for the sake of Quidditch practice.</p><p>“If either of you three call in sick tomorrow, I will come to your flats and curse you all.” Marcus chimed in alongside the melancholy sounds of the locks being secured by Oscar.</p><p>“Just because you’re a bore who rides off into the sunset <em>God knows where</em>, don’t be jealous, love.” Flo smiled, her lips pressing to Marcus’ cheek; the lipstick that had been wearing off from the constant stream of talking she did with customers left a perfectly round mark on his skin.</p><p>“I’m not jealous,” Marcus laughed. “Have fun. See you all tomorrow, nine o’clock <em>sharp</em>.” He exaggerated, giving all three of his friends a mock salute before heading in the opposite direction towards the small, wizarding part of the town.</p><p>The wizarding community here was notably smaller than any of the other places that Marcus had visited within his twenty-five years in the world, but it acted as a microcosm for the wizarding world as a whole. There was a wand repairs shop, a local pub, Quidditch stores and pet shops all brimming to the ceilings with magic. Behind the small estate of cottages where the majority of the community lived, save for the rare few such as Marcus himself and other Muggleborns, even stood a miniature Quidditch pitch where Marcus’ team trained and often held their matches.</p><p>It was always surprising to him how this area of the town was so undiscovered by the Muggle community swamping over three quarters of the land; granted, areas such as the Quidditch pitch were secluded and far off so that Muggles seldom came across the paths leading to it, but the streets lined with the shops weren’t too far away from regular hotels and holiday homes. The seclusion of the wizarding world would always greatly confuse the logical part of Marcus’ brain, but thinking too much about how blatantly obvious their side of the world was almost hurt his mind sometimes. He had to cut himself off before he delved particularly deep into the ins and outs of magical law; Marcus was proud to say he was a relatively intelligent person and had his academic skills, but investigating the foundations of his blood wasn’t something that particularly intrigued or excited him.</p><p>Marcus aimlessly sifted along the narrow roads of Llandudno towards the almost dirt path stretch taking him the backwards way to the Quidditch pitch. The perimeter of the half-sized pitch presented benches where parents and spectators could sit during practice and proper matches, as well as the top end of the oval shape being home to the broom and supplies cupboard. Originally controlled by magic, as was everything, Marcus had installed a typical lock to secure all of his growing supplies; he rarely ever used genuine magic nowadays, his wand was locked in a box in his wardrobe at home, and he liked knowing that everything he was working towards was only accessible by <em>him</em>. Perhaps he was becoming a paranoid coach who was allowing the power of running a relatively successful youth team get to his clouded brain. Whether it was that or just his maturity giving him a better way to protect his inventory, Marcus didn’t particularly care.</p><p>By the time Marcus had approached the broom and supplies cupboard, his whole team of little Quidditch players were stabilising themselves on their broomsticks and doing hover trials around the edge of the pitch. One of the first lessons Marcus taught any of his team members was the simple practice of what he called ‘hover trials’. They were to essentially correctly raise and mount their brooms, kick ever so slightly off the ground and do a complete circuit of the pitch five times, gradually increasing in speed, in order to improve their balance and their control of the broomstick. The majority of the team had purchased their own broomsticks after being placed a permanent player, the reserves, on the other hand, made use of the supply Marcus kept in the cupboard.</p><p>“Mister Marcus!” Rory was the first of the team to spot their beloved coach scooping up the broomsticks and the chest of equipment they would need for the evenings practice. “You’re finally here!”</p><p>“Of course I am, little guy. Am I late?” Marcus asked, glancing down to his watch. He was technically a minute late which, to the Quidditch players bouncing on the balls of their feet as they eagerly awaited the session, was the equivalent of being an hour late.</p><p>Marcus allowed little Rory to carry one of the broomsticks – he had asked to carry the chest but, given that even Marcus struggled to carry it, he decided against potentially wounding the child before he’d experienced life yet – as they rounded up all the suited and booted players.</p><p>“Alright, good evening, lads,” Marcus started, clapping his hands together to catch their attention. “First things first, since we all now have broomsticks, I want you to do three lots of hover trials. Around the pitch fifteen times while I set up. Anyone who knocks someone else off their broom has to do another five.”</p><p>One by one the little ones (Marcus said little when, realistically, all of the players were between seven and ten) tapped off the ground and began to gently direct their broom around the circumference of the pitch. Meanwhile, as he usually did, Marcus set off to the side of the pitch where Julia set up her ‘parents and carers’ coffee stand for the practice; the tight-knit community always stayed to watch the team practice for, aside from occasional birthday celebrations, this was the only time they ever all got to be together. Julia would bring the hot drinks, a gentle elderly lady who brought her grandson, her daughter was always away for work, carried in trays of freshly baked cookies and patisserie rolls and the remaining circle would take it in turns to bring napkins and paper plates. It was a sweet arrangement and, as he poured himself a too-strong cup of coffee into a paper cup, Marcus suddenly felt at home again.</p><p>“Marcus, my love,” unsurprisingly Julia was the first to beckon him over, flattening out a double page spread from the <em>Daily Prophet </em>as he approached the bench where she was sat. “You know how I mentioned that European Quidditch Tournament earlier?”</p><p>“Yes…” Marcus started, uncertain as to where this conversation would be heading. For all it was worth, Marcus deeply admired Julia and appreciated everything he had done for her, but she did request and suggest some very unusual things which, due to their close relationship, Marcus could never refuse. One time Marcus could never forget was when she suggested, in the name of fundraising for a local Floo network to be installed in her teashop, a Lobalug’s versus Marcus Quidditch game. It seemed like an interesting and fun idea until Marcus was continually pelted, for the entire game, by Bludgers and even knocked off his broom by<em> his own players</em>.</p><p>(Explaining the injuries to his co-workers the next day was difficult, especially since, to the extent of their knowledge, he didn’t really have anyone else to talk to or spend time with. He added the lie to the mental list of bent truths he had been forced to tell his friends in order to keep the reality a secret.)</p><p>“You know that fancy estate near Conwy, about ten minutes away, where the Muggle footballers sometimes stay?” Julia started, continuing without giving Marcus an opportunity to register the place she had been describing. “It turns out that’s where the Scottish team will be staying for the duration of the tournament. I think it would be sweet if we could get some of the players to come here and chat to the kids about pursuing Quidditch professionally. Don’t you think?”</p><p>Marcus pondered the request; for the first time ever Julia had seemed to propose something realistic and helpful and, the more Marcus thought about it, the better the idea seemed. The only visible downside was the fact that Marcus would be the individual nominated to go knocking on the prestigious door or writing an overly-friendly letter to request an ounce of the player’s free time. Nevertheless, putting all the negative aspects aside, having some of the team come and meet his talented crew seemed like the most amazing idea that would hopefully inspire them for their upcoming league matches.</p><p>“That’s a great idea, actually. The Scotland team… anyone notably famous playing for them?” Marcus asked, squinting as he leaned forward in an attempt to decipher the small print listing all the players.</p><p>“You might know this person, someone called Oli-”</p><p>Julia was cut off by the sound of scratching wood and nearby childish squawks as three of his team crashed into each other. Their tumbling dismounts over the grass almost seemed comical; one of them flipped front ways over his broom, resulting in a collision between himself and the player immediately ahead. As those two coiled together in some sort of magical entanglement while swooping to the ground, their brooms spun and clipped the back of a third players. Entwining together in a ball of jumpers and goggles, the three of them rested in a spherical lump on the floor, one with tears of joy in his eyes, another tears of pain and the third tears of shock. It was a sight that Marcus had witnessed far too many times, to the point where all he did was sigh and shake his head as he stalked over to the bundle of boys.</p><p>“Lads, what did I say?” Marcus sighed, ignoring the popping of his bones as he crouched to their level to assess the damage the collision had done to them all. “Up and do another five please, James. I’m not sure why this is funny to you. Off you go. Kyle, go get a cup of tea and sit out for a few minutes with your dad. You’ve no injuries, try and get back on the broom as soon as possible. Meanwhile, you come with me, Luca. You’ve got a bad graze and a couple of scrapes, I want to clean that all up before you get back in there.”</p><p>Marcus eased little Luca up, letting his injured Keeper hold tightly onto his hand as they both hobbled over to the benches. The moment he set Luca down on one of the wooden structures his mother had rushed over, words of reassurance and comfort dropping from her lips like honey as if her son had been involved in a much more serious incident.</p><p>“Snitch or Hungarian Horntail?” Marcus asked, holding up the two different patterned plasters in front of Luca. Between soft, blubbering tears Luca pointed towards the Snitch design; Marcus gently wiped a damp towel over his grazes, brushing his thumb over the area surrounding the cuts to check there was nothing inside the open wound. Marcus then peeled back the protective film of the plaster and gently placed its length over the graze, giving a gentle rub along the top to ensure it would stay securely on his skin. “There we are, then. You’re a proper little player now, aren’t you? Had your first injury and all that. My first injury was in my first game at Hogwarts. Some horrid little Hufflepuff knocked me off my broom five minutes in. I sprained my arm and missed the next two games. You’re never a true player until you’ve shed a couple of tears.”</p><p>Marcus directed a playful wink in the direction of Luca, ruffling up his muddied hair. He let him be after that, allowing his mother to take over the caring duties by dishing out countless supportive rubs and dainty kisses to the little grazes scattered over his skin. Marcus just sighed as he picked up his cup of coffee again, watching with mild admiration as the rest of his team finished up their first warm-up.</p><p>“You’re very good with kids.”</p><p>Marcus sighed, casting an emotionless look in the direction of Julia. “You say that every time I talk to a child.” He chuckled, scrunching up a napkin to toss in the direction of a rather smug-looking coffee drinker.</p><p>“I say it because it’s true, my love,” smiled Julia. “Rory adores you. He isn’t as friendly with some people as you’d think. He likes you because you’re good with kids, and you <em>know</em> that’s true. Why don’t you have any?”</p><p>Marcus stared blankly at Julia, head shaking slightly so that loose stands of hair came to cover his eyesight and slipped between his individual eyelashes. “Well first, and most important, I’m single. And have been since… the day I was born.”</p><p>“Details, details,” Julia waved her left hand nonchalantly in the air. “Okay then, Mister Pedantic, do you <em>want</em> any?”</p><p>“I’ve… never considered it before.” Marcus eased out, slower than usual as the concept of children ran through his mind. He never had looked that far into the future, hence why he was living in a town full of people who didn’t have plans for that far ahead. A self-deprecating part of him teased his thoughts with the notion that he’d never considered children because, honestly, who would ever want to settle with someone with such lacklustre desires in life? He couldn’t really offer financial stability beyond his little apartment and the occasional money he splurged on an <em>extra</em>-large coffee in the mornings, nor could he provide substantial enjoyment. Marcus liked to think he had a fair personality, but even <em>he</em> got bored of his own company sometimes; how on Earth was he supposed to expect someone else to spend every waking moment with him when his own mind shut off sometimes?</p><p>“You should consider it. Who knows, perhaps your one true love lies just around the figurative corner.” Julia joked, perfectly set eyebrows wiggling.</p><p>“The figurative corner?” Marcus queried.</p><p>“Yes,” replied Julia. “There’s nobody else your age around any corner in this town.”</p><p>Marcus let out a gentle snigger, head shaking as he smiled over at Julia. The concept of finding someone had left his mind the moment he arrived here and saw how diminished the twenty-something’s population seemed. But now, sadly, Julia had sent the thought right back to the centre of his mind; he wished it wasn’t there, being alone meant he never really craved affection or attention from anyone but, now that he was thinking about the possibility of the person of his dreams waltzing into his life again, he had a slight simmering hope that he would have the chance to settle down. Perhaps there was the chance that someone around the figurative corner would change his life for the better. Marcus cast one last look at the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, eyes tracing the photograph of the Scotland team sweeping through the air in an arrow formation. He turned and walked back to the pitch just as the team turned to the camera, faces all split into youthful smiles.</p><p> </p><p>Marcus’ kettle whistled as he groggily wiped the sleep nestled in the corner of his eyes; the blinding sliver of sun cast into the small room through the tiniest gap between his curtains, scattering a shower of light patches over his carpeted floor. Marcus’ apartment was a sparse two rooms big; there was a small lavatory set to the side by the entrance, meanwhile the main room displayed his bedroom, lounge and kitchen. The larger of the rooms had mainly an open plan layout, with the cracked, marble countertops of the kitchen snaking in a U-shape to separate the kitchen from the lounge. Separating the bedroom from the remaining space hung only a plaid-patterned curtain. The railing curved around the entire “room”, isolating his bed, wardrobe and cabinets from the public space. Nobody bar himself and Oscar ever really came up here, Marcus didn’t really understand why he went through the trouble to assemble the curtain in the first place, but he liked having a somewhat organised and private space for <em>just </em>himself.</p><p>He peered out the clouded window; Marcus’ view was perfect, he looked out over the rest of the high street and, if he stood on his tiptoes, he could see a line of the ocean over the rooftops of the buildings opposite his apartment. He lived above the only bakery in the town, meaning every morning as he opened his window to allow fresh air to slither into the murky area he was greeted with the settling scent of freshly baked bread and other assorted treats. When he was too tired to make breakfast, which ended up being most days, Marcus would stumble downstairs and pick up a croissant of sorts before heading to work. His living situation probably wasn’t as desirable as other people’s – for one he knew Draco Malfoy still lived in the Malfoy Manor and he was sure the Potter family would be residing in a gloriously large detached house by now – but for Marcus, it was home. Having a wonderful landlord looking after he and his apartment a mere five minute walk away from <em>Coney’s</em> was perfect for him; in a tainted and short-sighted way, Marcus’ life was indeed that: perfect.</p><p>Marcus’ plans to for the day were surprisingly somewhat different to every preceding day. Usually he would wake, go to work, then go for lunch, back to work and then Quidditch practice until dusk made it impossible for them to train safely. However today, thanks to a last minute idea shoved in his vision yesterday, he was taking the afternoon off work and going down to essentially harass the Scottish Quidditch team. Admittedly he was a <em>little</em> frightened, these were working professional players who would probably kick him away like a spec of dirt on their broomstick the second they saw him approach their area. Marcus greatly doubted that any of them would come to their tiny town’s pitch to give a five minute motivational speech to uninterested children who probably had no intention to pursue Quidditch past schooling age when they could be training for their own competition. Alas, Marcus knew he would be taking the intimidating plunge to talk to them, knowing that if he didn’t Julia would give him <em>that</em> look (a combination of pursed lips and narrowed eyebrows, somewhere in between disappointment and anger that reminded Marcus so much of his own mother he melted the second she pulled it).</p><p>After realising he was a little short on Muggle money Marcus had to accept defeat and make his own coffee and breakfast that morning. He didn’t know how he had come to this predicament, he decided to ignore all the nights out he and the group had every Friday evening, but it was only a few days until his pay day so he didn’t let this worry him too much. As long as his pockets jingled with a clattering variety of Muggle and wizarding change then he knew he would survive the day.</p><p>After the kettle died off and the steam stopped billowing out the top Marcus poured the contents into his travel mug, printed on to the centre of the mug was ‘You’re a Catch!’ (the mug had been a Quidditch-inspired Christmas present from his cousin), and stirred in far too many spoons of sugar. He pressed on the lid and took a judgemental sip, only leaving his apartment after being satisfied with how the drink tasted as it buzzed over his taste buds.</p><p>Though the walk to the ice cream parlour consisted of crossing one road and walking five minutes along perfectly stoned pavements, on days when he was particularly tired Marcus felt as though it was a marathon. He was just glad he lived in such a pretty town, for the sight of fresh flowers blooming in the flowerboxes hanging from all shop windows and the sweet sound of seagulls echoing between the crossroads kept him alive, brought him down to Earth and reminded him how lucky he was to have such a simple life. It was the little things that kept Marcus happy; as long as he got to squeak as a seagull swooped right at him every day, Marcus would be content.</p><p>When he finally arrived at the parlour it was about five minutes until the actual opening time but, as always, the doors were hung open as the rest of the staff set up the chairs, tables and made sure the parlour was as welcoming as it could possibly be. Each day one of them had to arrive half an hour early to unlock the doors and switch on the electricity and today it was Oscar’s turn since, according to a majority vote the day before, he would be the least ‘hungover’ to wake up early.</p><p>“Good morning, my dears,” Marcus chirped as he walked into the parlour, immediately switching his light blue jacket for his usual pastel coloured apron. “How was everyone’s evening?”</p><p>“Dead.” Called Oscar from the back room.</p><p>“Wasn’t too bad, actually. The majority of the night was spent telling people that no, myself and Valentina aren’t together,” Flo laughed, sorting out the ice cream and scoops behind the counter. “Apparently two girls can’t represent their workplace at an event without being pounded with questions about their relationship.”</p><p>“To be fair, Flo, it wasn’t a professional event. And we did spend the majority of the evening drinking a little too much and holding onto each other’s hands. As we all know,” piped up Valentina who had sauntered into sight with a broom in her hand. “I’m a rather emotional drunk. So, after having a few too many cocktails, I started crying as I told Flo how gorgeous she looked. Clearly that would give off the impression something was happening.”</p><p>“You’d make a cute couple,” Marcus offered, flicking the sign to ‘Come in, we’re open!’ that hung on the front door. “By the way, not sure if Mr Pine spread the word, I booked the afternoon off. I won’t be coming back after lunch, so, it’s just you three.”</p><p>“What? Why?” Flo was the first to question him, suspiciously peering over at him from the top of the display case.</p><p>“Doctor’s appointment followed by a dentist appointment. All of my healthcare has fallen on the same day.” Marcus improvised, a gentle shrug of his shoulders hopefully adding to the believability of his excuse.</p><p>“Why does my grandfather never let me take time off, even when I’m on the brink of <em>death</em>, but he lets you take half a day off with minimal notice?” Whined Oscar, who had now come into view with a variety of freshly washed tea cups to hang on the rack above their food preparation surface.</p><p>“I don’t know, Oscar, maybe it’s because I’m actually a good worker.”</p><p>“Harsh, my brother,” Oscar chuckled, hopping onto the counter to get a better view of the other three workers stood in the room. “We all still on for drinks this Saturday? This weekend can’t come quick enough, honestly.”</p><p>“Is that even a question?” Valentina asked, nodding in a manner so aggressive that her perfectly curled hair bounced and fell in front of her face. “Of course we all are. If any of you drop out I will-”</p><p>“Am I interrupting something?” A voice cut right through the middle of Valentina’s declaration. The unknown person’s accent was thick – Scottish? Marcus considered – and wove through their voice like thick treacle being oozed over a perfect slice of cake. There was a rather gruff tone to the person, but at the end of words the pitch rose ever so slightly, as if their voice still had late remnants of youthfulness cascading through their dialect. The voice was… familiar.</p><p>“Oh, no-!” Marcus looked up and turned to answer the evident customer, yet his voice failed him as he caught sight of who it was. He almost felt rather dizzy as he faced the shadowed figure stepping into the doorway; it took a while for the sunlight to hit them perfectly so all their facial features were visible but, when they did, Marcus felt like he needed to sit down. It was a cruel twist of fate, really, like someone had deliberately muddled with the formation of the universe to drop someone so pivotal from his past right in the centre of his present and his foreseeable future. With this figure rung back all the negative memories of the last time he <em>saw</em> this person, memories that he didn’t want and could have happily lived the remainder of his eventless life without.</p><p>If he could’ve picked one person he never expected to see walk into his ice cream parlour, it would have been Oliver <em>freaking </em>Wood. Stood with a rucksack hanging over his shoulders, calloused fingers clutching to the straps, he looked just as he did the last time Marcus had seen his face. His <em>face</em>; the dusting of freckles that scattered his skin had seemed to darken over time and his hair still retained its short, windswept look Marcus remembered from the countless Quidditch matches they played against each other. As Marcus’ eyes scanned the remainder of this <em>imposter</em> everything somewhat started to make sense. Underneath his red, velvet jacket sat a worn out t-shirt displaying the word ‘Scotland’ printed in a small font underneath an off centred, small flag of the country. Marcus had been briefly informed through a letter at some point that Oliver had gone into professional Quidditch, but nobody had told him that he played for his country now. It was a shock and Marcus knew he looked a fool just stood there staring at this new customer. Or, at least, he looked a fool to everyone but Oliver who was staring back at him with the same glimmer of confusion and a hint of apprehension swimming in his eyes.</p><p>“Marcus,” it was Valentina’s sharp voice who cut into his internal breakdown and brought him back to reality. He stared at Oliver still, but eventually eased his gaze to Valentina after Oliver’s eyes broke the contact first. His <em>eyes</em>, they still stared into his soul while providing an impenetrable shield to his own thoughts. “Are you okay? Do you know each other?”</p><p>“Not really!” Marcus snapped up, nervously wiping his suddenly damp hands over the material of his apron. He rushed around the counter, breathing deeply to compose himself, and faux nonchalantly set his arms on his hips as he addressed Oliver. “Sorry about that. How can I help you?”</p><p>Without even so much as glancing at the other three staff in the room he <em>knew</em> their eyes were burning the side of his head from a spike in interest and curiosity. There was a nervous silence filling the air, a complete contrast to the usual happiness and light heartedness that families brought, Oliver looking at Marcus again with an essence of uncertainty in his gaze.</p><p>“Um- I was just… I was wondering if you were open? I know it’s quite early, but I’ve had a long journey and I kind of really need a cup of coffee.” Oliver explained, taking a hesitant step towards the counter. They were suddenly so close, only the counter acting as a physical barrier between them. Marcus didn’t know <em>why</em> he was so overwhelmed by this; Oliver’s presence just reminded him of the war and how, as Marcus looked up at the arrowhead of broomsticks racing past, they last made eye contact between a shower of multi-coloured spells and echoing yells during the Battle of HogwartsHH.</p><p>Marcus jumped ever so slightly as Flo bumped into his side. Flo was usually the one who noticed when something was wrong and, luckily, interfered just at the right moment. There was something about the soothing hand now rubbing his wrist that told Marcus she knew there was an unsettling past between him and Oliver. “We are open. Welcome to <em>Pine Cones Ice Cream Parlour.</em> I’m assuming this is your first time here?”</p><p>Oliver nodded, fingers gently drumming the counter. “Yep, my first time in the country, actually. I’ve come from Scotland, see.” His free hand proudly gestured to the flag printed on his shirt.</p><p>“Scotland! Marcus here used to go to school up there. Small world,” Flo easily continued the conversation. “Anyway, welcome. We do serve coffee. We have just opened for the day, excuse the lack of menus and everything, but I’ll go pop to the back and get a mug for you. Oscar, Lena, we should go sort out the menus for the table, shouldn’t we?”</p><p>And, just like that, the three gatekeepers of the conversation had scuttled to the back of the parlour. The silence between Marcus and Oliver was almost deafening in a painfully metaphorical way. Marcus suddenly felt as small as a grain of sand on the beach a few yards away from the parlour; the way that Oliver was looking so inquisitively at him reimbursed the dusting of insecurity that had settled into Marcus’ skin.</p><p>“Do you want anything other than the coffee?” Was all Marcus could muster out and even that simple sentence was a bundle of shakes and hedges.</p><p>“You’re not going to try and start small talk are you, Flint?” The way Oliver uttered his surname figuratively sent him back seven or so years to when they were on their respective Quidditch teams, arguing over something or other in the changing rooms before a match. It struck him almost as hard as a Stunning spell would, except this made his heart ache as well as numbing his bones and his senses.</p><p>“I don’t know what else to say, Wood.”</p><p>“I mean, you could explain how you’ve ended up at the edge of the country in a tiny ice cream shop. I thought you’d be in London or something.” Oliver shrugged, examining the tubs of ice cream cluttering the display case to his right.</p><p>“I don’t understand why I owe you that sort of explanation, though. I’m here because I’m here. It’s where life brought me and it’s where I intend to stay.” Oliver’s head tilted to the side as if he wasn’t satisfied with the answer.</p><p>“Isn’t it a bit – empty?” Oliver inquired. “Also, since we’re here. Can I have a cone of that blue ice cream, please? It’s peaked my interest.”</p><p>“You want a cone of the bubble-gum ice cream? On a waffle cone, regular cone or teddy bear cone?” Marcus asked, waving a hand by the rack of exemplar cones atop of the display cabinet. “That’s why I like it here, I suppose. It’s empty. You’re the first person from my old life who I have ever come across.”</p><p>Oliver pondered for a moment, “teddy bear, please. And what do you mean by your old life? You can’t suddenly, I don’t know, change person completely.”</p><p>Marcus nodded, picking up one of the ice cream scoops and arranged two perfectly round spheres of the bubble-gum flavour into one of their teddy bear shaped cones. Usually exploited by children, the teddy bear cone had the regular triangular point at the bottom but, instead of a round top where the ice cream sat, there was a base with two little circular ears at the sides, decorated with a darker face to create the look of a teddy bear face painted on the cone. “I’m living life half as a Muggle and half as a wizard. I wouldn’t even say wizard, really. Half Muggle and half Squib. I don’t use my wand anymore, I don’t do any sort of magic. I know the magical community, but I never take advantage of that side. Everyone here thinks I’m just like them.”</p><p>“I never expected that from you,” Oliver started, rushing on after realising the slightly negative and reprimanding connotations to what he just said. “I mean, you know. You always loved magic, Marcus. I thought you’d be thrilled to finally get to work in a field that required it.”</p><p>“So did I. But,” Marcus handed the cone over to Oliver, only flinching slightly when their fingers brushed. He had half expected some cliché fireworks to erupt inside him, that was what usually happened in these situations (or, perhaps, given what he had just experienced, that was only an over-used descriptor in Muggle books and film), but it was just a little flinch from the contact with someone he hadn’t seen in a while. “Watching countless people be slaughtered by the means of magic does something to a person. Can’t even look at my wand without thinking about all the people who died at the hand of magic.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Oliver murmured, immediately taking a small, tentative lick of the ice cream. “Not bad. <em>Anyway</em>, but you didn’t cast any Killing Curses. Surely it shouldn’t bother you? People kill using knives but I bet you use a knife every day to butter bread.”</p><p>“It’s different, Oliver. Besides, this is a conversation too deep to be having with anyone at this time of morning, especially <em>you</em>. So, in order to seem polite, what are <em>you</em> doing in this little spike of the universe?” Marcus questioned, ringing the purchase through the till but dropped a couple of his own coins into the tray. They both knew Oliver had no Muggle money to pay for his food and drink, whenever that arrived. It was easier if they agreed through unspoken signals for Marcus to take care of the cost. Marcus momentarily forgot he was short on Muggle funds, a thought that wouldn’t strike him until later that night as he attempted to sleep.</p><p>“It’s never too early to talk about feelings, Marcus,” shrugged Oliver. “I’m here for the European Quidditch Championship, haven’t you read about it? Scotland are staying a little bit away in this expensive looking area by the sea. I’m on my way there but I think my Portkey was a little off. I needed somewhere to have a rest and this was the only place with open doors. It was meant to be a step in step out kind of thing, but I might come here more often knowing you work here.”</p><p>“Why would you do that?” Marcus asked, eyes narrowing and eyebrows curving into a displeased expression as he looked over to Oliver again. He couldn’t look at him for too long without getting a little out of breath; he would look and take in the person stood so close to him and become overwhelmed by the rush of emotions that swarmed in his mind. He was so, so scared to be this close to someone who reminded him of all the troubles that stuck to his mind but, at the same time, he felt so happy to talk to a familiar face again, to be brought back to the happiest years of his life at Hogwarts.</p><p>“It’s nice to see a friendly face, isn’t it? Someone from your past. And I know you’re here to forget about the past but I’m here for three weeks and you can guarantee you’ll be seeing plenty more of me.” Oliver explained, picking up one of the napkins to wipe the smeared blue ice cream dripping down his chin.</p><p>“I suppose it is…” Marcus agreed, swilling the ice cream scoop in the little bowl of water as a way to distract himself from the headache bubbling in the centre of his mind.</p><p>“So, I’ll see you aroun-?”</p><p>“Wait!” Marcus exclaimed, splashing some water over the floor from his rash actions. “Sorry, sorry. Didn’t mean to yell. It kind of happens sometimes when I get a little overwhelmed. Personal problems: I’m dealing with them. Basically, I coach the local Youth Quidditch team here. And yesterday one of the parents suggested I try and get some of the Scottish team to come and say hey to my kids and talk to them since they’re staying so close, and I was supposed to be coming to stalk you all later to request this but I know I’ll wimp out because you’re all a little intimidating. Essentially – would you possibly be able to come to my training session at some point this week to inspire some little Quidditch players? I promise my boys are all lovely.” He was a <em>little</em> out of breath and little embarrassed at the speed he just rushed his request off to Oliver. Marcus didn’t know <em>why</em> he was so intimated to be speaking to Oliver considering he was older than the boy and had held more authority over him for the better part of their lives. He was always, despite Oliver possibly not admitting it, the best Quidditch captain during their Hogwarts years and had led to many more match wins. But something about being in one of the places Marcus felt so comforting, talking to someone who made him feel so unsure, rattled a horrid feeling deep in his stomach to the point he felt like he could throw up.</p><p>Oliver’s lips had curved into a sympathetic, yet kind, smile, a slight gap in his upper and bottom lip allowing Marcus to see a hint of his teeth. “Of course I can,” his confirmation accompanied a gentle nodding of his head. “I’d love to, actually. I’ll get some of my teammates to come along. It’ll probably be a few days away, our first match is in two days, but it’ll be nice to come back here. I’ll force you to show me the wizarding part of this town afterwards. It’ll be fun.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Marcus exhaled a deep breath he’d been constricting for the best part of two minutes. His body thanked him for finally regaining composure by diluting the feeling of fear in his stomach. It was replaced by a blooming thankfulness and excitement at what this could do for him. He had no intention to necessarily get to know Oliver again, but having a face from the better part of his life so close by had the potential to reassure him. If Oliver could be so content and so perfect following the trauma he also experienced then why couldn’t Marcus? “That means a lot. Just pop back in when you have a date in mind. Don’t go out of your way or anything. If you’re too busy then you’re too busy, you know?”</p><p>“I won’t be too busy. I’ll come in soon, trust me,” Oliver dumped his used napkin in the bin as he turned from the counter, reconnecting the curves of his fingers with the straps of his rucksack. “It’s good to see you, Marcus. Really good. You’re looking well.”</p><p>“So are you.” Marcus murmured, out of earshot as Oliver had already plodded back out the parlour. He had looked side to side, checking that nobody was about, before shivering out of sight as he apparated to wherever the team were staying. Marcus slumped, knees buckling and arms cushioning his face as he freely plummeted to the surface of the counter.</p><p>He was already exhausted and his day had only been alight for an hour or so. The gentle shuffling of footsteps alerted him of the presence of his co-workers conveniently re-entering the main space of the parlour; a gentle clinking of ceramic touching ceramic told Marcus someone had brought him the cup of coffee that was probably intended for Oliver, and a series of gentle pats on the small of his back became a wave of soothing reassurance that he was still alive and still breathing.</p><p>“Who was that then?” It was Valentina who posed the question that Marcus knew everyone had been wondering since he zoned out earlier on. A deflated sigh fell from the lips of Marcus, head hesitantly rising as he looked between the three figures looking interrogatively at him.</p><p>“Old school friend.” He uttered, a sentence which was, for the first time, a whole truth.</p><p>“Did you date or something?”</p><p>Marcus scoffed, shaking his head as he shakily lifted the cup of coffee to his lips. “No. We used to be pretend rivals at the school sport. We were captains. It was all in the name of house rivalry.”</p><p>“Why were you so shocked to see him, then?” This time it was Oscar furthering the spoon of curiosity down his throat. Marcus had been expecting a flurry of questions from them but all he really wanted to do was take an early break and sink into a chair while he regained all sense of direction, time and emotion.</p><p>“I’ve been detached from that side of my life for so long, you guys know I don’t see my family or school friends, it’s just a bit surprising seeing someone walk into this place when it’s so far away from home. It’s like, for example, if your dad walked in here, Flo. He has no idea you work here, so him rolling up would be very shocking.” Marcus said, dipping his mug into the sink to clean it up for customer use the moment his lips had drained every ounce of coffee from it.</p><p>“Yeah, that makes sense. Glad you’re alright though, my love.” Flo reassured, her now magenta coloured lips pressing a kiss to his cheek.</p><p>Marcus just nodded, looking longingly out the window at the spot where Oliver had disappeared from. He couldn’t understand it at all, really, how the world had formed such a drastic coincidence that Oliver would be reintroduced into his life at this exact moment. Marcus was suddenly thrown back into the magical world he had for so long dreamt to escape, orbiting the centre of his universe again. He was confused as to how his and Oliver’s paths had crossed, how their lives had tumbled into each other resulting in their planets following the same orbit. It scared him slightly knowing he was <em>so </em>close to being tossed back into the life of spells and enchantments that had plagued his nightmares for longer than he wished to admit. It was <em>terrifying</em>, shaking him right to his bones that everything he had built up the past two years was suddenly at the risk of being obliterated by a person he had almost entirely wiped from his memory.</p><p>But still, to his surprise, Marcus couldn’t stop watching the space somewhat wishing that Oliver would come back and tell him everything was okay. That his family were happy, his old friends were living their lives filled with glee and success. He had for so long hidden from communication with his past in the fear that the ones he loved wouldn’t respond, that perhaps in some additional sick twist of fate everyone he knew and had grown up with had been removed from the world.</p><p>Oliver didn’t return, nor did he leave the mind of Marcus as he worked through the rest of the day with his mind preoccupied by the possibility of someone else shimmying through the door to invade his life again. Perhaps Harry Potter was taking an impromptu holiday to the seaside and was craving a banana split sundae, or Pansy Parkinson was visiting the area to reacquaint herself with her Welsh roots – she was Welsh, right? – and this was where she had brought her distant family. Marcus’ head shook, disappointed that he was letting himself slip back to his old ways.</p><p>He was going to be <em>fine</em>. Oliver was here for a few weeks and would drift out of his life just as he had barged back in again so suddenly. Marcus wouldn’t even realise he was gone or that he had ever arrived; he didn’t know why he was so panicked by the concept of having Oliver in his proximity again. It was mid-afternoon by the time Marcus had somewhat managed to shake the feeling of Oliver’s eyes digging into his soul from his mind again as he walked back into <em>Coney’s</em> after taking lunch back in his apartment.</p><p>“Uhm – Marcus?” Valentina questioned, mid-scoop. “Aren’t you supposed to be at a doctor’s appointment?”</p><p>Needless to say, Marcus hurried back out of the parlour before anyone else could question him. He was a mess, a puddle of Marcus-flavoured ice cream trailing around the floor like a dejected slug who had finished destroying a nutritional leaf and had to find somewhere else to hide. It was unenjoyable, but there was still a flicker in the back of his mind that teased him about the prospect of familiarising himself with Oliver again. One thing Marcus was sure of, though, was that this little gem by the side of the ocean was about to become much more interesting than it ever had been before.</p>
