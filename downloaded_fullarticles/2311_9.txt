    <p>Harry James Potter, son of Lily and James Potter, husband of Ginevra Potter nee Weasley, father of three children, one of which had his own experience that is comparable to his own, and an Auror for the British Ministry of Magic, was observing quite a peculiar scene. He was staring at what seemed to be a contraption made out of lights, mirrors, and crystals pointing towards an outline of a door with a muggle light detector above it. It had the handiwork of muggle brilliance at such subtle precision, and he felt that one small step would break and ruin such odd handiwork. But what made him worry was the format of the room itself.</p><p>The area was a roof of what looked to be a tower, and there was no door or stairs out of the area, and the contraption itself was placed on a hexagonal pattern. The contraption itself, which it waited for someone to activate, has been folded, waiting for something on the roof of the object, one that Harry Potter knew was the key to open the gates of the multiverse and therefore destroy all of the worlds. He checked his pockets, fishing out an off polygonal object, placing it on the roof, and it opened up to reveal intricate mirrors, and what looked like a light source.</p><p>He checked his head and took one last glance of the eyepiece he has fashioned for such a journey. It was modified from a two-lens eyepiece, making use of mirrors that led toward a single lens. He can still see the red tint of the lens as it was covered by another modification. It looked like a cylinder, with a movable lens within. The blue tint of the movable lens was a good one, for it revealed that using the lens to see invisible small hatches and hallways which he is able to Apparate, one his eyes adjusted, and he focused to the small path itself.</p><p>It was an odd feeling, being able to become as small as ant inside what of a light amplifying device, and it proved to be useful as he didn’t have to poke it with a small stick, nor use his wand to charm it to fix itself.</p><p>Back to the present, he went to fix the mirrors, setting as––</p><p>“Harry! Get up here, we have a problem!” the voice of his wife called out from nowhere.</p><p>The illusion of the roof faded into a simple basement as he Apparated out of his miniature castle and walked out of the basement.</p><p>Harry looked at her. “What is it, Ginny?” he looked over towards the front door and blinked. “Bloody hell.”</p><p>It was him. Somehow. But the difference was this Harry was wearing a torn jacket, a suspiciously-ripped shirt and pants, his glasses have cracks which both didn’t seem to mind.</p><p>Harry Potter looked at himself, who was wearing regular muggle outfit for the time; a sleeved buttoned up shirt, blue pants, and black shoes. His eyepiece was resting on his forehead.</p><p>Both men were staring at each other before the torn-clothed man stepped in. Harry approached him and raised his hair off his forehead, which the other one did the same, and both of them looked at the lightning-bolt shaped scar that served as the one and only proof that they were one and the same. Harry would stretch out his hand.</p><p>“Harry,” he greeted curtly.</p><p>The ragged man shook his hand. “Harry.”</p><p>Both of them entered the house and went to the living room, where Ginny had taken the chance to give the bad-looking Harry something decent. He immediately went over to replace his torn clothes with what looks like a simple shirt and pants</p><p>“So, Harry, if you are here, does that mean that those Spiders from the muggle movies were real and they had done it?” Ginny asked.</p><p>Harry smiled, musing that Ginny was the one to see the muggle movies in her spare time.</p><p>“Well, Mrs. Potter, that event is simply true, and while they have fixed it, the multiverse hasn’t had time to heal. That’s how I got here. I attempted to fix my universe from collapsing,” Harry explained, adjusting his broken glasses and cleaned it with his shirt, “and I was thrown off towards this universe. I noticed the similarities and I decided to head here.”</p><p>“What about the clothes?” Harry asked back to his double.</p><p>The one with the broken glasses chuckled. “I had to rip them to not get looked upon by the Ministry. Mind fixing my glasses for me?”</p><p>Harry fished his wand and looked at his glasses, before hesitating. “I think it would suit if you keep your glasses broken. Where’s your wand?”</p><p>Harry sighed, fishing them out of the ruined pants and placing it on the table. “I didn’t have the Elder wand to fix it again. I left it at Dumbledore’s.”</p><p>“Our Elder wand was in Dumbledore too. Glad we Potters think alike,” Harry joked.</p><p>Harry laughed while Ginny groaned before someone activated the doorbell.</p><p>“I’ll get it.” Harry went to open the door, and his jaw fell down as his eyes widened. He fixed his composure after he had noticed a lightning bolt scar on his forehead scales. “You know you can’t get in with your size, right?”</p><p>He crossed his huge arms. “Let’s go to Hogwarts. Me, you, the homeless.”</p><p>Harry looked back to see the other Harry approach them and looked back. “How did you know he was here?”</p><p>“I followed him,” the dragon replied.</p><p>That made sense.</p><p>“I can’t leave, I have something to do on the basement,” Harry replied. “Sorry guys.”</p><p>Before he could enter his house and return to his personal project, he gaped at a new set of newcomers. They looked normal, but he could recognize one of the Greengrass, Delacour, Patil, Luna, Hermione, and Tonks, an-other Muggle-looking woman and a woman with familiar green eyes. He decided to ask later as he entered his house and went back to the basement, unaware that all of them followed him. He would Apparate back into the roof with his eyepiece and continued the work. At least nobody knew where he was until the one with the broken glasses pointed to the miniature castle with the roof. All of them stared at what Harry was doing as he opened a portal within that outline and looked up. Harry sighed, before Apparating towards the basement again.</p><p>“Guys, give me and my workspace, please,” Harry begged.</p><p>“What were you doing on that miniature castle anyway?” Hermione asked, holding the hand of the green-eyed.</p><p>Harry took notice of her actions and dismissed it. “After watching a muggle movie about a multiverse and also playing some muggle games about magic and mystical crystals, I decided to test the theory and check if they can be true.” He looked at the castle. “And it turns out I can open doors to another universe.”</p><p>“You could get us home!” Patil told him. “I told you, Harriet had a good idea of coming here.”</p><p>“Wait, who’s Harriet?” Harry asked, before looking at the lady. “You?”</p><p>Harriet nodded before she shifted back into Harry and fixed his glasses on his nose. “Hello, Harry.”</p><p>“Okay…” Harry would pull out his muggle phone and call for someone. “Damn, really?” He pocketed it. “Alright, everyone. Looks like this is my fault. Didn’t you all arrive yesterday through a very… weird way?”</p><p>“Yeah,” all of them chorused, before looking at each other. “How did you know?”</p><p>“Ah… damn. Looks like I need to finish this Muggle-based machinery.”</p><p>He Apparated back to the miniature castle, while Hermione recognized what it was.</p><p>“That’s the Craftsman’s Manor, from the muggle game The Room Three!” She exclaimed, much to everyone’s odd looks. “It’s a puzzle game for the mobile muggle technology and muggle computers. Basically, there’s a big castle and the main character was stuck there until he solved specific puzzles.”</p><p>“Blimey, and he remade the whole thing,” Harriet realized, recognizing the game and the castle’s architecture as well.</p><p>The dragon and the first newcomer looked at themselves before to them. Their companions did the same thing.</p><p>Back in the miniature roof of the castle, the wind was strong enough as Harry took hold of the last piece to open the true gateway and placed it and unscrewed it open.</p><p>The doorway turned into something opaque, yet as fluid as the Veil.</p><p>Harry decided it would be time to shut down everything and Apparating out, flicking his wand to open up a new part of the basement and enlarge the machine from the miniature castle, which had reverted back to its folded state, the key and the two pieces located beside it. Harry looked at the fallen pieces and sighed. He would pick it up again and scan the other Harry Potters before something ticked his mind and he looked at his contraption again.</p><p>“Oh, bollocks,” Harry cursed. “This gray icosahedron key is tuned here.” He faced the others. “It seems that you have to get some stuff first to get you guys out.”</p><p>“Why?” Hermione asked, curious. “What exactly did you make?”</p><p>Harry gulped and tapped his key. “A wizard’s way to explore the multiverse, uh… Granger. It seems my fiddling of the multiverse’s seams has created me a way to safely create… ways to connect the worlds.”</p><p>“But that is…” the ginger-haired girl stuttered.</p><p>“Impossible, until you lot appeared here. As far as I’m concerned, you’re supposed to be married to somewhere in France under wealth and protection. You, Hermione, is married to my best friend Ron. And Ms. Greengrass’s sister is married to some nice nobleman, and the rest I don’t simply know,” Harry countered. “And then we have three Potters here. Explain that.”</p><p>To his expectation, nobody answered or countered anything. There was nothing to counter his wild explanation.</p><p>He was enjoying Hermione’s mortified reaction when he had said she was married to Ron. He didn’t expect him to cling to the female Harry, who turned back into his male form as his reactions reflected his looks. Harry mused that he married the knowledgeable, knowing that he himself used to read ahead and found such effect cute.</p>
