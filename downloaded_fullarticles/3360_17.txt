    <p>Since the first time he had seen her, Draco Malfoy had loved Hermione Granger. He loved her bookish personality, he fantasized about snagging his fingers in her bushy hair, and he often had to keep himself from laughing at something witty she had said. In the almost six years they had known each other he had never told her. He couldn't possibly, no one would approve. From the moment they had been sorted into practically opposite houses he knew he had no chance. He hid his feelings behind his cruelty to her and her friends.</p>
<p>There had been moments over the years where he'd come close to telling her. He'd visited her more than once at the infirmary when she was paralyzed second year, under the guise that he needed a potion for a headache. In fourth year she'd once caught his wrist to help his movements as he had trouble with the retrieving charm they were learning. At Flourish and Blotts before fifth year he caught a book up off the top shelf for her, where she couldn't reach. More than once he'd been the one to remind her that the library would be closing during a strenuous study sessions.</p>
<p>This was where they found themselves now; her sitting comfortably at a desk covered with books in the back, him standing closer than he probably needed to. He called out softly, "Hermione."</p>
<p>Her head shot up from the Transfiguration essay she had been revising, a stack of books falling to the floor at her abrupt movement. Draco stifled a smile as he bent to retrieve them for her. "Oh. Thank you Dra – Malfoy." She stoppedherself before speaking his first name as he had used hers.</p>
<p>"Do you, erm, need any help putting these away?" He rubbed the back of his neck in nervousness. She narrowed her eyes in suspicion. "The library's closing in a moment."</p>
<p>She nodded but declined his invitation. "I think I'll manage, but thank you anyway."</p>
<p>"Alright." Instead of leaving though, Draco stayed where he was as she returned the books to their shelves and left a few to take back to her common room.</p>
<p>"Can I help you with something?" She asked as she bent to grab her bag when he was suddenly next to her.</p>
<p>"Come with me." He whispered into her ear and she could only shiver. Draco left without checking to make sure she would follow. Hermione wasn't so sure she would. She'd had a crush on him for a year or so now, even though he could be so mean to her. There had been many moments when she had seen through this, so many moments when he was nice to her without reason. As when he had found her crying once in third year and he'd handed her a tissue but had left before she could even blow her nose. Or in first year when she had become lost in the dungeons after potions and he'd lead her out.</p>
<p>Hermione wanted to follow him but she couldn't trust herself not to tell him anything about her feelings. But soon her curiosity got the better of her and she ran to catch up with him.</p>
<p>She found him waiting outside an empty classroom which he slipped into after seeing her come around the corner. There was barely any hesitation before Hermione followed him inside. It was dark and she couldn't see much. "M – Malfoy?"</p>
<p>The door closed behind her and she quickly turned around to find Draco blocking her exit with a dark look. She knew she shouldn't have followed him, that this was trap she had foolishly fallen in to. Draco steeped toward her and she stepped back until she ran into a desk.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" She snapped, angry at herself for getting her hopes up. He only came closer, his eyes flitting between her eyes and her lips. The butterflies that usually inhabited her stomach when he looked at her turned into a herd of hippogriffs when he reached for her. Hermione tried to move away, afraid of what he might do, but found she was still caught by the desk.</p>
<p>Draco wasn't exactly sure what he was doing when he had asked Hermione to follow him to the old classroom, all he knew was that he needed her alone or he was going to go crazy. Well crazier than this task from the Dark Lord was making him. He had her pushed against a desk when he caught her hand and pressed it to his face before kissing each fingertip. He felt her breath shallow at his actions, he saw the confusion cross her face but also the joy and desire that took its place. His voice was low when he answered her. "I want you."</p>
<p>She shook her head but he pressed on before she could say anything. "I need you. I have to get away from here, come with me." He took her other hand and repeated his actions from earlier. He wanted any taste of her he could get. "Please."</p>
<p>"Don't think I'll give in to you," she whispered. One of her hands had found its way into his hair, his fingers still wrapped around her slight wrist, downplaying her words.</p>
<p>"Then I'll take you with me," Draco growled. Hermione's breath caught in her throat as she thought of what that would mean, his hands moving up her arms to her shoulders and then down her back. She felt his nose nuzzling into her neck, making it hard for her to think. She grabbed the front of his robes and tried to push him away. He gave her a pleading look.</p>
<p>"I can't go with you Draco," she muttered. He stiffened and turned away from her. She walked to him and took his hand but he refused to look at her. "But that doesn't mean I don't want to. I just … can't."</p>
<p>He turned back in to her, burying his face in her freshly scented hair, his arms curling around her waist. "I can't do this anymore, Hermione. Please. Just come with me."</p>
<p>"No." She shook her head and pulled away from his surprising warmth. She had always thought he would be cold. When he tried to delve back into her frizzy locks she stopped him with her hands on his face, making him look her in the eye. "Draco we cannot leave. We will not run. I understand why you want to but.."</p>
<p>He laughed at her, a cold chuckle. "You don't know the half of it."</p>
<p>Hermione sadly shook her head. "I know more than you think. I've been talking to Dumbledore about it since the start of the year and he told me about what Voldemort wanted you to do."</p>
<p>"He … He knows?" Draco gulped. If the Dark Lord heard about this, he'd be done with. Then again, if he ever learnt about Draco's feelings for this Muggleborn girl in front of him, he'd be just as finished. He put his hands over hers. "I love you."</p>
<p>Hermione forgot what she was going to say about talking with Dumbledore and Snape about Draco's strange actions that year. About how she was trying to find a way to get him out of this awful fate, because she was worried about him. But her mind went completely blank when he uttered those three words. "Wh – what?"</p>
<p>"I love you Hermione Granger. I always have, since our Sorting. But I can't stay here anymore, love. Come with me." Draco begged, close to coming to his knees. He realized he would do anything if only she would come with him. Hermione didn't know how much longer she could say no to him. She was starting to crumble. The way he was tracing lines over her arms wasn't helping either.</p>
<p>"I … I can't." Hermione cried, tears starting to fall. He wiped one from her cheek before pulling her to him. "I l-love you too."</p>
<p>He stepped back from her and this time, she knew she wouldn't be able to say no when he asked her to leave with him. He leaned forward until their noses touched, still looking her in the eyes, almost going cross-eyed. She was ready when his lips brushed hers gently, ready to instantly deepen the kiss. Her arms around his neck he trailed kisses up her jaw until he reached her ear. "Come with me."</p>
<p>She shivered with nerves and something like excitement. She nodded. "Yes."</p>
