    <p>MC was looking at the sea, feeling the warm breeze, and sun beams at the face. The summer break was almost over, but the few days spent with Ismelda, covered up all the tough stuff MC has been through at year 5. At last the portrait curse has been broken, and MC could use some relax, with beloved person.</p>
<p>Barnaby is a real friend, MC thought. He convinced his parents, to let them stay in their summer house near Brighton. It was quite small, but equipped enough to spend a few days there. The beds were close enough, so MC could hold Ismelda's hand during the sleep. Mornings were always fun, having breakfast together at the porch, then putting on swimsuits, and having fun at the beach. Evenings spend nearby the fireplace, with mugs of hot drinks, and dreaming about the future ... <br/> Ismelda has learnt how to trust MC. She has uncovered even more secrets, and started to feel safe in MC's arms. Her everyday facade was nowhere to be seen, while being close to MC, although a few times, she was really tempted to cast a curse on some random muggles sunbathing nearby their summer house. Even though she still liked her hairstyle, she sometimes let MC uncover her face fully, while they were kissing. Her eyes were shining like the newborn stars, when she was looking at MC ...</p>
<p>Unfortunately it was the last day of the summer break. MC stood up earlier, and took a look at the sea, before making the breakfast. Ismelda was much better at cooking than MC, but simple full English breakfast wasn't an impossible job to do. MC took a deep breath, and went back inside, heading for the kitchen. After a few minutes bacon was sizzling, mushrooms and eggs were frying, while MC was preparing the rest. Remembering to give Ismelda an extra black pudding, MC set up the toaster, and began to boil the water for the tea. Suddenly Ismelda appeared, dressed in her sleepwear. She was freshly awake, but with a smile present on her face. She approached MC, and gave a small kiss in a cheek.</p>
<p>- Hello darling ...<br/> - Hey honey. Just a minute, and everything will be ready.<br/> - Great. I'm starving ... But at the same time, I think I need to take a quick shower. I'm still in the middle of the dream.<br/> - Was it a dream about me ?<br/> - You wish !</p>
<p>They both laughed. MC knew right away that she was dreaming about something connected to them.</p>
<p>- Yeah, I should have known ... It was probably Barnaby ! Since we are at his parents house... I still remember how you tried to pick on him ...<br/> - Oh cut it off ! You know well, that I'm dreaming only about you darling ...</p>
<p>Ismelda has threw her arms around MC's neck, and shared a long kiss between them. MC didn’t wanted to stop it, so reached quickly to the stove, and turned it off, to avoid burning the breakfast. After a minute, MC ends the kiss, and looks at Ismelda.</p>
<p>- What’s the matter darling ? Don’t you like it ?<br/> - I like it ... But what about the breakfast ...<br/> - I guess we will have to eat the cold food ...</p>
<p>Ismelda sat on the countertop, and kissed MC again. The emotions won. Again.</p>
<p>After some time MC and Ismelda found their selves lying on the bed together. It was almost noon, but the couple seemed to not care about it, and enjoy their last summer day fully.</p>
<p>- Did I ever told you, that I love you ?<br/> - Like ... a hundred times by now ?</p>
<p>They both laughed again. Ismelda was getting really hungry, so she reached to the side, grabbed a chocolate box, and put it at MC's belly. After that she lied down, with her black hair all around the cushion.</p>
<p>- Feed me ...<br/> - Hey, hold on. What with the breakfast I made ?<br/> - I'll eat it too, don’t worry ...<br/> - Okay but ... It's not good to eat sweets first ...<br/> - Screw it ! It's our last day - and I'm going to spend it to the extent possible ! Besides ... We are still young. You will have enough time to teach me manners !</p>
<p>The duo laughed again. MC gave up, and began to fed Ismelda with chocolates. MC looked at the window, and began thinking about Hogwarts ... Tomorrow at this time, they will be at school again, with their friends ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the same time Tulip was sitting alone at her room, looking at the window. The surroundings of her family house was beautiful (if you want the better description just look at the Windows XP stock wallpaper). She spend her summer break alone, but thinking everyday about just one person. About MC.<br/> Since her first day at Hogwarts, Tulip thought about lots of things. She was interested in some boys, and liked a few girls too - Tonks was like her sister, with her prank loving. But since she got to know MC, she knew that she is dealing with someone special. Not only because MC is famous in wizardry world ... There are so many things appealing in MC, that Tulip was really puzzled sometimes. Yet she didn’t have the guts to tell so, even though there were numerous occasions. This year this has to change.</p>
<p>Tulip stood up, and approached the big mirror. She looked at the reflection - maybe I can change something in myself ? She looked at her face - no, that’s not it. I'm pretty after all, she thought to herself. At least this is what all the boys that have been dating her had said. Maybe change the hair dye ? Well, also no ... I like my hair red. I guess the easiest would be to change my clothes ... <br/> Tulip spend some time in her wardrobe, to look for something more intriguing. She end up with wearing high heels, and a dress - but not the one she wore for yule ball. This one was candy apple red, and quite short, exposing her long skinny legs. To top this, she decided to put on some makeup, and after she finished, she looked stunning. Yes, this will make it, Tulip thought to herself ... Now to only find a way, how to get closer to MC ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Brighton MC and Ismelda were already leaving. MC locked the place up, and suddenly the weather has changed. The wind was getting stronger, and it seemed like the rain is coming. Great, what a day for a trip ... But what was more important, was that Ismelda seemed worried.</p>
<p>- What's the matter honey ? Something happened ?<br/> - I don't like it ... I remember the day when ... You know ...</p>
<p>MC recalled the horrible story Ismelda went through.</p>
<p>- Yes, but it’s over now. You are no longer cursed.<br/> - I know, but ... This sudden change of weather always tells for something bad to happen. I'm just not sure what it is ...<br/> - Don't worry. It’s just the storm, that's it. Come on, we have a long travel ahead ...</p>
<p>MC and Ismelda left the summer house, and head for the train station in town. At the same time Tulip was still glaring at herself in the mirror with an evil grin. And yet at the same time one mirror at Hogwarts reflected something strange, even though there was nobody in this room ...</p>
