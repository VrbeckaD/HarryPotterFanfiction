    <p>The morning light streamed into the room, giving the first hint that the night had ones again been driven away. The light trailed over the countryside waking the birds, letting them chirp and chatter among themselves. A little over the hills a small girl wakes, hearing the birds and seeing the light enter her room.</p><p>Waking up, Hermione Granger looked up to her sealing, sucking in the warmth the first light had provided. It was for her the beginning of the most exiting summer. She was going on the first big vacation her family had planned since living memory. Before she had been born her parents used to close the dentistry, packed up and go travel the world for a few weeks relaxing and letting go for a bit. Now though with her being there her parents traded big travel to smaller trips, taking her to the seaside, visiting her grandparents.</p><p>But when Hermione graduated from her primary education, her parents though that it would be time that after eleven long years, they would take her on the big vacations of old. A month long vacations that would be just them far from home. After a long deliberations, asking themselves where Hermione would like to go, asking herself, they landed on France, It was where her parents took their first trip so it would be like a good start for Hermione to see the world through a different culture.</p><p>So, after planning the vacation it was just a matter of Hermione finishing her Primary Education. Which she did with flying colours, marking new records in her class and year. Her headmaster had given her a certificate telling her that she was an excellent student, an example to the student body. Hermione had always looked up to her and saw her as an example for how she would like to grow up.</p><p>When she took the certificate, her headmaster told her something that would leave a mark on her. Being kind will carry you farther than anything else. She took that advice and vowed to live by those words.</p><p>Waking up this morning Hermione, she just smiled. Knowing that this summer would be the best one in her life. Finishing school, taking a break from studying for her exams and just enjoying her time in the break before the new school would be arriving in two months.</p><p>Looking over to her clock she saw that it was just before half six in the morning, too early for her to rise and face the wold yet. She turned on her side with a smile looking forward to the summer, looking forward to seeing the world.</p>
