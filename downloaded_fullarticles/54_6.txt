    <p>
  <span>Hermione Granger's hand was warm and slightly wet because of all the nervousness as she was dragging Harry Potter through a river of wizards, who filled the streets of London with pure joy similar to madness. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement gave it all to try and suppress the crowd of wizards and witches, to stop them on their way to the center of the capital of Great Britain, but from time to time here and there there were fireworks that no muggle could ever have seen before. It was pointless at this point to even try and do something about “weird looking people in colorful robes” that were seen on every other TV channel and newspaper.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No one could stop people from celebrating the victory over the Dark Wizard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry could feel that Ron was hardly keeping up with their pace, he felt it when his friend caught his hood. He held on even more tightly to Hermione’s hand, the girl looked back at him with a happy yet exhausted look on her face. The crowd tried to bury Ron alive in the pile of bodies, so Harry used his free hand to pull his friend to the front, making it a bit easier to get through the crowd.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just a few minutes ago they had apparated to one of the expectedly silent corners of the Diagon Alley and had immediately been squeezed with bodies, loud music, dancing, and joy. They’d better hurry until someone noticed their presence and made it an even bigger deal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry could swear he heard Ron’s sigh of relief when they could finally notice the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. They were practically running those few meters when they heard one of the people noticing Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Potter!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s Harry Potter!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The voices got muffed behind the closed doors and Hermione’s spell. Some particularly nosy guys tried to peek through the windows, but she has closed the curtains as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Phew, we made it,” Ron exhaled, wiping real sweat off his forehead. “Where do those guys even get the power for partying? I found it hard to get up today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You always find it hard to get up, Ronald.” Hermione put her wand back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well yeah, you’re totally right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They looked around. The shop was covered with dust, all the surfaces flat or curved. The spiderweb was prominent, hanging between the ceiling and the ladders full of toys; the shelves full of various magical crap looked abandoned. Harry could feel a draining pull of anguish by merely looking at them, and it took him a moment to reign on his own emotions. He promised himself to fully indulge it later, though.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t a secret to any of them why the shop that used to flourish and fill people with laughter was now drowning in sorrow and dust. The reason was imprinted on the dusty wooden floor as footprints that were leading up to the brothers’ study. The brothers, who not so long ago were responsible for all the magic that this place had held. There was only one pair of footprints there now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron went eerily silent, and Harry noticed Hermione taking the boy’s hand. They headed towards the staircase. There was no sound in the shop but their steps and soft creaks of floorboards. Toys were hanging from the ceiling, twirling lightly at the movement of the air. Harry was closing their morose procession, and he could feel the anguish creeping and taking over him like a flood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They stopped at an indiscernible door on the upper plateau. The footprints were leading behind that door, into the study. Hermione clenched her fist and awkwardly lifted it to knock at the wood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“George?” There was no answer. Hermione waited a couple of seconds and knocked again. “George, it’s just us here. Can… Can we come in?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She seemed to be unsure what to do as she stepped aside and looked at Ron helplessly. He swallowed and reached for the doorknob. The lock gave in easily with a silent click, and the door opened with a creak. They peeked inside, feeling wary and alarmed with no visible reason. Harry caught a thought at the back of his mind, that there might be a vase or any other object to be thrown at them from the corner of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But it was much, much simpler. And much more grievous. George was sitting at his brother’s desk with his head dropped to his hands, surrounded by chaos. His own desk was knocked over, pressing over the books, weird-looking schemes and blueprints, cups and Merlin knows what else. The floor was covered with paper, broken bottles and their smithers, and broken toys.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The only place in the study that was untouched was Fred’s desk. It looked as if it was Fred himself who sat there, tired and resting his head on the blueprints, halfway through creating another barking rattle for babies with irresponsible parents.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s heart sank at this sight, and let the anguish in at last, not willing to wait for the evening to come to drown in sorrow. The losses were too great, the casualties too heavy for those who managed to survive. Potter tried to breathe, inhale then exhale, and couldn’t dare admit that he was waiting, too, for his chest to give up its last breath. He was positive that if soon enough there won’t be any kind of business to distract him and for him to fully immerse, he would end up here, next to George, breaking and bringing back together toys that once used to bring laughter and joy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione crouched to examine the glass scattered on the floor and picked up a tiny whirligig that was supposed to draw incredible traceries by spinning. She gave the toy a small spin only to make sure that it will never glimmer again. Then she stood up, hiding the toy into her pocket. Ron was making his way toward George, who gave no vital signs. The boy stepped carefully, trying not to break anything else. As if the mess could have been made somehow worse by sloppy steps.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Georgie? George, it’s me, Ron.” He shook his brother’s shoulders but got no reaction. Ron made a sullen grimace and reached somewhere under the desk to take out an empty bottle of firewhisky. “Bollocks, there are three of these down there. He couldn’t have downed them in one go, could he?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I hope not.” Harry approached the desk, too, and placed two fingers to George’s neck. “Pulse is normal, but if he has three bottles of firewhisky in him, it might not be for long.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bollocks,” Ron repeated, crouching and retrieving other bottles from under the desk. He placed them on the top. “What are we supposed to do then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione warily took some books and papers off the nearest chair and put them down to the floor, then sitting into the cleared space with her hands under her hips. It wasn’t chilling cold in the study, so Harry concluded that she was merely feeling uncomfortable, which was relatable. He felt a growing temptation to lie down on top of the pile of garbage and search for the unopened bottles of whiskey.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What did your mom say, Ron? Before you left.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“George didn’t appear back home for a couple of days, and we were kinda worried, but then this wild happiness burst out on the streets.” Ron scratched his nape. “Mom got frantic that he might get lost in the crowd. And he’s here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And he’s here.” Hermione echoed with a sigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry tried to concentrate. He looked at the framed moving photographs of the Weasley family and their friends that were hung on the walls. They were all red-haired, smiling and laughing, looking back at him. Covered with dust. Not real. The real George didn’t dare cast as much as a glimpse on them and was slowly drinking himself to death and banging his head against the desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, we can’t leave him here,” Harry said in a matter of fact voice, looking back at his friends. “We have to take him to the Burrow. To Mrs. Weasley. I don’t think Mungo can afford to take him in today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True,” Hermione mumbled as she got up from her seat. “First it would be great to heal all the broken legs after the parade.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I bet you can’t apparate from here,” Ron noticed. He assessed George as if trying to calculate the approximate weight of the guy. “We might have to levitate him downstairs first and apparate to the Burrow from the entrance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds like a plan to me,” Harry agreed. “Who’s gonna perform the charm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let me do it.” Hermione retrieved her wand, ready to cast the spell. She frowned, pointing her wand at George when Ron slightly lifted him from the chair. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Levicorpus!</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The body was hoisted up into the air, bent weirdly, moved by the witch’s stable hand. Hermione strolled towards the exit backward, with her hand still up, and Harry hurried to open the door for her. The four of them left the study. Ron looked over the mess one last time and closed the door shut behind them, leaving the photographs to smile into nothing from their dusty frames.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s hand was slightly trembling while she levitated George downstairs, his head thrown limply back, still unconscious. Harry noticed that he had huge violet eye bags, which were especially prominent next to the red hair even if it had lost its vibrancy. They were all used to George not having one ear, but for some reason, Harry had an uncomfortable feeling of a fresh wound from looking at it. Perhaps, it was because the body was numb and senseless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They wouldn’t know, but at that moment the three of them shared one feeling: loneliness. They descended the dusty creaking staircase, surrounded by toys that looked more like cocoons, dancing in the air to a mute tune of valse. They didn’t think of how their procession resembled the one of a funeral. Outside, under a clear blue sky, thousands and thousands of wizards were gathered all together to celebrate the victory over evil, the victory of light. Only in this wooden coffin in the very heart of overall happiness, there lay what was behind that victory. There, among gifts and laughter, three suffered loss. And everyone else who was mourning and burying their beloved ones in similar crypts, they suffered loss, too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The staircase was passed, Ron sneezed for the fourth time that day and Hermione lowered her wand. Harry caught George by his shoulders, careful not to let him fall. Ron embraced his brother from the other side. George’s head was still limp, his face hidden behind dirty hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll apparate with him,” Ron said stiffly. “From the porch. We have to be quick so that the locals won’t notice, otherwise, the gossip will follow us to the very Ireland.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then I’ll open the door, you leave.” Hermione immediately pointed at the entrance and opened the door with a spell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry and Ron dragged George closer to the exit, and Potter let go of the brothers, moving back to Hermione’s side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You ready?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yep. See you in the Burrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione opened one of the two parts of the gate just wide enough to let Ron step outside and disappear in the thin air at once. It seemed that no soul outside even noticed the door of the Weasleys’ Wizard Whizzes opening and closing right away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry and Hermione looked at each other confusedly. They stood still until the girl nervously looked round to check if they might be seen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We have to go, too,” she said calmly. “I don’t know the exact place Ronald apparated to, but if he accidentally landed into the swamp next to the Burrow it’s high time we think they both are half drowning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think he made it,” Harry shook his head and looked over the curtains. “You go now, I’ll handle the door.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She followed the same path Ron did a few moments ago and hesitated next to the door. She hugged herself and turned round to look at Harry. If he had seen such an expression on his friend’s face before he would have been seriously worried. But now, when they were standing in the middle of abandoned Fred and George’s shop, he was already far too familiar with the look. He had been seeing the same one every day in the mirror with a green copper frame that hung in his bathroom, back home at the Grimmauld Place. He had seen it on Molly Weasley’s face when she was looking through the window at the endless fields that surrounded the Burrow. He had seen it on Nevill’s face when the boy hugged his grandma — she was crying both happily and woefully. He had seen it on the Hogwarts’ professors’ faces when they were bringing the school’s walls back stone by stone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And he was seeing it now on Hermione’s face when she was staying before him and was probably utterly confused and unsure of what the future holds for them all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have to admit, I can’t even imagine what is going to happen to us all, Harry.” She confirmed his guess.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked blankly at his sneakers that were now drowned in dust and slowly nodded in agreement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Neither can I.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you think we’ll get it later?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry watched her as he tried to remember when was the last time they gathered all together. Not for their friends’ funeral, not for a charity evening to gather money for those who suffered from the war, not for the memorial. When was the last time the Burrow’s stuffy kitchen was filled with laughter and popping fireworks? For Harry, it felt like another life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Perhaps it was. Their lives have changed forever. Harry staggered towards the door and gave Hermione a tight hug. She drew out a shaky breath as if she was about to cry in his shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t promise you that it’ll be fine, Hermione,” he said, feeling his friend’s hair tickling his face. “But I do know that there’ll be a time when we all will feel better. We just need some time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Some time,” she echoed quietly and pulled back. Her eyes were red, but Harry showed no signs of noticing that. “You’re right. We’ve got to go now. Ron’s probably drowned in a swamp by now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry let go of his friend’s shoulders with a soft chuckle. He stepped aside, preparing himself to close the door after the girl leaves.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter opened the door with a light hand movement and closed it as soon as Hermione vanished at the porch in a whirlwind of apparation. He couldn’t dare move for a couple of seconds, watching the dust float in the air. His eyes caught the curtains that Hermione’s pulled to cover the windows. There were thin lines of sunlight going through them. He pulled one curtain aside and looked outside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There, in sunny daylight, vibrant robes filled the streets, magical confetti flickered through the air and music was loud and gleeful. Harry noticed a couple of familiar faces in the crowd and was glad no one can see him. He knew all too well, that in the next few months or even years he will have to shake multiple hands, hug mothers who have lost their relatives and watch the kids grow up without parents because they died in a war for peace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was watching the happy faces and colorful dragons and birds up in the air when he suddenly saw him. Draco Malfoy was at the other end of the street. He didn’t look like he was going to take part in a parade, on the contrary, he looked as if he was there by pure accident, merely apparated in an inconvenient place that’s all, just like Harry and his friends did not so long ago.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was wearing a simple black cloak, and a white collar was visible under it. His messy fair hair glistened under the sunlight from under the hood when he staggered forward. He clearly hadn’t been expecting such a large crowd of people to be there. Fortunately, none of them paid much attention to their surroundings. Draco had a familiar condescending look on his face, but at the same time he looked so exhausted, he might have not been sleeping even two hours per day for the last few weeks. Harry wouldn’t be surprised if that was the case, honestly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy leaned on a brick wall of a narrow street to the opposite of a shop. He must be hoping to wait until there are fewer people around. Harry could only guess what was the former Death Eater thinking about now, hiding awkwardly in a crowd of those who celebrated the victory against him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Why did he even apparate there? He risked being cursed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter stood there behind a window in an abandoned shop and watched his school rival standing with his eyes closed in a colorful gleeful mob of wizards. He felt a strange urge to approach him yet was too scared to actually do so. To scoop up people, who scurried back and forth, to cross the street, to overcome the anger in the other’s eyes, and to tell him, Draco, that he does not blame him for anything. To reach out and be ready for his hand to be bitten off with no second thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To say sorry and to get a punch in the face. Only Merlin knows how much Harry needed that punch right now. He didn’t know why. But his guts told him that it might help, might sober him up. The physical pain might overpower the mental one, but it was a path far too dangerous and slippery.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry acted on that pull without thinking. He moved to the exit of the Weasleys’ shop, opened the door and stepped out on the porch, indulging in the sunlight, the vibrancy of the streets, robes and the sky. He didn’t plan to apparate. He just froze there on the highest step of the staircase, a bit higher than all the people, and he looked to the further end of the street, where Draco Malfoy stood still against the red brick wall with his eyes closed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, the boy pulled his head from the wall and looked directly back at him. Potter thought, that if his legs really give up now and he falls onto the cold pavement and will never see the daylight ever again, he won’t even regret it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But he stood there, frozen, and stared back at Malfoy, who was equally frozen in place, and whose gaze was hard to catch behind tall wizarding hats.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry mustered up his courage at last and started to get through the bodies to the other end of the street, but after his first step another massive hat hid his aim for a few seconds, and then Potter saw the place empty. Malfoy has apparated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry blinked in confusion, startled, and stopped. That drew attention to his figure, and a few people looked at him excitedly and approached him with cheerful exclamations to shake his hand. Disoriented, Harry managed to wave to the people that surrounded him and apparated to the Burrow, where Hermione and the Weasleys were waiting for him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>These few moments lasted as long as a few hours, but then he found himself at the edge of the Burrow’s apparation zone, slightly dizzy. The Burrow stood there before his eyes, and its curvy roof seemed to touch the sky itself. There was some kind of fuss at the porch, and Harry rushed there through a green lawn. He tried to forget the Diagon Alley and the guy he saw there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the porch, there was Ron and Hermione, who used her wand to water the laughing boy. At a closer look, Harry could notice that Ron’s lower body (starting from his chest) was stained with mud and slush.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t believe it, Ronald, I merely can’t believe it!” Ron, soaked in water, laughed and tried to dodge another jet that Hermione sent towards him. He saw Harry and ran down from the porch to hide behind his friend, and Hermione, who didn’t expect it, doused Potter with water from head to toe. She gasped in surprise immediately, though. “Merlin, Harry, sorry! Ronald had apparated into the swamp after all and I was trying to wash him up,” she mumbled as she went downstairs as well. “George ended up in the bod, too, but the cold water woke him up, so Mrs. Weasley told him to go shower.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stood there on the lawn and tried to catch his breath. He resembled a fish on the shore a lot, which made Ron laugh hysterically behind his back until he almost fell. First seconds Harry was about to start remembering every Hagrid’s Blast-Ended Skrewt in utter confusion, but then he saw Hermione smile in that very cherished way. He hadn’t seen this smile in ages. Harry heard Ron falling onto the grass, still laughing, and he started smiling, too, raising his wand and casting a flow of water towards Hermione, who was still fully dry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She squeaked and hid her face with her hands, but didn’t let go of her wand. The revenge was quick to follow, and a whole waterfall fell onto Harry, making him almost slip on the grass and fall onto Ron.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They didn’t think of it while running around after one another, trying to make the wet and slippery green grass even more soaked in water. Later, when he was changing into dry clothes Ron gave him, Harry realized that for the first time in a long while they were genuinely happy and weren’t bothered by thoughts of what had happened and what is yet to come for them. They were the children, who survived the war and were granted an opportunity to live. They had to use it wisely.</span>
