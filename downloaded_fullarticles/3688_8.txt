    <p>"Sev?" Harry was looking out the narrow window. It was only about three centimeters wide but six centimeters in length to the courtyard. If you want to call a mass of flat stones surrounded by huge stone walls a courtyard. He was wondering what was going on.</p><p>"What?" Severus was rearranging their bedding. It was an everyday chore he set himself up to do.</p><p>"Dumbledore, it has to be with that color robe, and a group of people just arrived."</p><p>Severus walked over to the window and when Harry moved aside looked out. He knew Harry's eyesight wasn't as great because his glasses were sadly outdated. "It looks like Black, Lupin, Moody with some Aurors."</p><p>"No prisoner?"</p><p>"No, wonder what they are doing here?" Severus looked over at their wall, where he kept track of the days, did a quick count. "It isn't time for his yearly annoying visit."</p><p>"Well, should we get into our places in case?" Harry wasn't sure what was going on either.</p><p>"Most likely, we will need to hide the extra bedding and cover the markings." They quickly hid everything and pulled out the ratty blanket they had stolen from Lucius Malfoy when he had been incarcerated before he had been Kissed. They huddled together since they had to kill the warming charms they had placed in their cell. "I hate when they visit, takes forever to get everything back in place."</p><p>"Not to mention I hate being filthy."</p><p>"Agreed. I call the shower first." </p><p>"Can't we share? It will warm us both up." Harry nudged Severus.</p><p>Severus didn't get to reply as they heard voices coming. They stared into space and wait. Soon they saw Dumbledore, Black, Lupin, Moody with Shacklebolt at their door. Neither made any type of movement to show they know what is going on.</p><p>*You know why they are here?* They rarely used this method of communicating as it took a lot of energy since they used their energy to keep the cell habitable.</p><p>*No. I am trying Black but can't get a direct link.*</p><p>*Wonder what they want? This isn't Dumbles normal visit, he always comes alone.*</p><p>"Oh, Albus, I think we are too late." Black rushed into the room, pulling Harry away from Severus.</p><p>*Yuck, dog germs.* Harry remained motionless. He felt like he was being hugged to death. *Cause of death, hugged by a flea-bitten dog.*</p><p>"We need to get them out of here." Lupin moved to stand by Severus.</p><p>*This is interesting. They found out we are innocent, it appears Arthur Weasley found the paperwork in the sealed files of the Ministry. Arthur got elected as the new Minister. The sealed files showed that Fudge with Dolores Umbridge and Percy Weasley sent the Dementors that killed your cousin, aunt, and uncle. The dark magic they said we used was actually an old case file from the first war and they transferred my magical signature to the new case, added yours when you tried to defend yourself.* Severus could feel Harry's anger building and he was proud Harry kept it buried, even as they were being manhandled out of their cell.</p><p>"We need to get them to Hogwarts. I already arranged beds for them." Dumbledore explained.</p><p>"Who is going to explain what happened?" Moody was standing behind Severus as they were being escorted out of Azkaban.</p><p>"I believe that job falls to me. I am sure we can work on them forgiving us." Dumbledore led the way out of Azkaban.</p><p>One of the unnamed Aurors muttered to his partner. "I hope they aren't expecting to be forgiven. They put them in here for ten years."</p><p>_________________________________________________________</p><p>As soon as everyone left the Infirmary, Harry sat up. Severus did too. They got out of bed and pushed the beds together, laying back down. "Going to feel weird sleeping in this cheap bed." Harry already missed their bed.</p><p>"We will have to have Dobby or Kreacher get our bed." Severus answered. "Right now, I want a nap."</p><p>"They did throw off our schedule. I wonder if they figured out what happened to the Dark Wanker yet?" Harry asked.</p><p>Severus grinned. They weren't going to tell anyone what they did to the Dark Lord. Well, technically, Harry, but they did wonder if anyone would ever figure it out. Severus felt Harry pull him closer, as the blanket settled over them.</p><p>___________________________________________________________</p><p>"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?" Harry opened his eyes. Severus buried his head under the blanket. "GET AWAY FROM THAT DEATH EATER!" Black screamed.</p><p>"Sirius, calm down." Lupin grabbed Black as he started to pull out his wand. "We aren't here to cause problems."</p><p>"That Death Eater has his arms wrapped around my godson." Black tried to pull away from Lupin.</p><p>"I would say it's more like Potter has his arms wrapped around my godfather." Draco Malfoy stepped into view. "Harry, Severus." He knew they were together. How could they not be after ten years in that hell hole with only themselves for company.</p><p>"Back off dog breath, you aren't welcomed here. Hey, Draco, how's it hanging?" Harry asked. "Anything interesting happening in the magical world?"</p><p>"Draco." Severus peeked out from under the blanket. "I require my robes if you could bring me them. Coffee. Yes, a lot of coffee."</p><p>"I heard you two got cleared of charges, thought I would stop by and say hello. I already have arranged for clothing for both of you." Draco was one of the few who never believed Severus or Harry did anything they were charged with. When Lucius was in Azkaban and Draco visited, he would sneak down to their cell and give them the hidden endless pouch he had on him. The pouch contained furniture, books, food, clothes, but more importantly, a small conductor of magic that with a harmless ritual would attach itself to a person's core and allow them to do wandless magic.</p><p>"Thank you." Severus and Harry said at the same time.</p><p>"What did you do to my godson?" Black was forced to sit on one of the beds near them. Lupin had his hands on Black's shoulders, holding the man in place.</p><p>"Think you can open up your doors for a few days? We will need a place to crash until we get our finances straightened. I wonder if we can sue the Ministry?" Harry quietly asked, well he made it loud enough for the wolf to hear.</p><p>"Door is always opened for-"</p><p>"My godson isn't staying with a Malfoy." Black snapped out.</p><p>"You have no say." Harry snapped. "You also aren't anything to me."</p><p>Before the fighting could break out, Dumbledore strode into the Infirmary. "Ah, I see you are awake. Wonderful, wonderful. How is everyone doing?"</p><p>"Bloody marvelous. We got to be woken up by someone barking at us. How do you think we are doing?" Harry snapped.</p><p>"It's way too early for him." Severus muttered. "Especially without some coffee."</p><p>"My boys, I am very glad to see that Azkaban hasn't damaged you."</p><p>"Is he serious?" Harry asked.</p><p>"No, that is Sirius, he's nuts." Severus pointed to Dumbledore when he said nuts. "I have been telling you that for ten years. Though after ten years he could be certified nuts by now or maybe completely nuts. Based on him walking in here like they didn't do anything to us, I would say all three of them are certified nut cases. Draco, I think you are the only sane person here." Draco smirked.</p><p>"I have wonderful news for you. Severus, your job is available. Harry, I have drawn up a schedule for your classes." He ignored what was said.</p><p>"He is nuts. Sorry, old man, but we aren't staying here. You and your clucking fried chicken club can go to hell for all we care." *Severus, what do you think he did?* "We're leaving as soon as we can."</p><p>*Something we are going to hate.*</p><p>"It has already been settled. Harry, you need to complete your magical education as agreed upon when you set foot on Hogwarts grounds. Severus, as a contract that he agreed upon before he was placed in Azkaban and it needs to be completed."</p><p>Severus and Harry started laughing. "That contract is outdated, it was voided when I was tossed into Azkaban and you voided Harry's magical agreement when you snapped his wand. Remember that? When everyone in the Order stood there and watched the students burn our belongs as we were being led away by Aurors." Severus had been the first Order member to arrive at the Dursley house after the alarm had sounded. Harry had already cast his Patronus to get rid of the dementors when Severus found him.</p><p>Harry was staring at his relatives' shells. He was in shock. "I tried. I was out in the backyard weeding the flower beds." Severus pulled Harry into a hug and that is when the Order arrived. They saw Severus hugging Harry and assumed the worst. Black stunned him, they later learned, while Lupin stunned Harry. They ported them back to Hogwarts and kept them unconscious for two days. When they were revived, they weren't even asked anything, just escorted out of the Infirmary by the Aurors. No trial, no questions asked.</p><p>"I had the Minister reinstate the contracts." Dumbledore gave them a smile. "You need to be around your friends and those that care about you. We can't allow anger and bitterness to fester. You will resume classes on Monday. I have arranged for your old quarters to be opened and freshened up."</p><p>"Have you arranged for all of our belongs to be returned?" Harry snidely asked. "All of our clothes, books, personal items, my photo album? How about Hedwig?" It was Ron Weasley who killed Hedwig, he wasn't sure where his cloak or map where.</p><p>"My cauldrons? My potion journals? My wardrobe? My books? My personal items?" Severus added. The potion journals could never be replaced, they had all of his experiments, his notes, his ideas, and his failures in them.</p><p>Draco was watching them the three Order members as they squirmed under the assault of questions. "The Ministry is in the process of reinstating all vaults, I am sorry to say there is nothing we can do about what was destroyed."</p><p>"You can replace everything that was destroyed." Harry demanded.</p><p>"I am sure we can work out something. Now, I do believe Draco has already arranged for clothing?" Dumbledore looked at Draco for the first time.</p><p>"Yes, unlike you three, I actually care about them." Draco stated.</p><p>"How dare you? I love Harry." Black jerked away from Lupin.</p><p>"So much so, he sent me to Azkaban, knowing what it's like to be betrayed." Harry calmly stated.</p><p>"HARRY! You have to understand." Black started to whine.</p><p>"All of you, get out. I will not have you creating problems. I have allowed this to go on long enough." Poppy appeared. "Now, leave."</p><p>"I just need to say one more thing, please do not try to leave, we have passed a law that restricts you to Hogwarts for the greater good." Dumbledore didn't even wait for the news to settle before he was out of the Infirmary.</p><p>Harry was furious. "You two better leave now before I do something that will put me back in Azkaban, legally this time."</p><p>"Get out, now, now. I will now have you disturbing them any longer." Poppy pulled out her wand and forced Black and Lupin out of the ward.</p><p>"Draco, you know what to do." Severus stated.</p><p>"Already on it. I figured he would try something. Blaise, Theo, Pansy and the rest are just waiting for orders."</p><p>"Good, it's time we got rid of the greater good crowd." Harry muttered.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________</p><p>Monday arrived and Harry grinned at Severus. "You ready?"</p><p>"Yes, I am going to enjoy this." Severus smirked as they headed out to their respective classes.</p><p>Severus POV:</p><p>I arrived at my old classroom and waited for the students to arrive. It was my first year Gryffindor and Slytherin class. After I took attendance I wrote out the recipe on the board. "Now remember the banana peels are not to end up on the floor. Mash the bananas up really well. Now, the secret is you want to add just a dash of vanilla." I casually walked around the room. "The elves will use the acceptable ones for dinner tonight."</p><p>The students were eating some of the bananas, walnuts, and dates but I wasn't worried, there was plenty. The elves would bring me more if we needed them. "Now for your assignment, I want a paragraph of how important vanilla is. Write as big as you want, I am blind." I dismissed the first years and waited for the next group. His NEWT level students were next. I hoped they liked hot chocolate. Maybe Harry will be free for when my fifth-year students were going to make tacos.</p><p>Harry POV:</p><p>I sat down in the back row, staring out the window when I noticed someone stepped between me and the window. "Potter, why aren't you reading?" Professor McGonagall asked.</p><p>"I don't have a book." I looked around the room, wondering why I was sitting in a room full of six-year students. I really wanted to laugh but remembered they didn't know the truth. "Remember everyone burned all my stuff."</p><p>"You had four days to replace everything, why didn't you?"</p><p>"Couldn't, I am being held prisoner here. Severus and I can't leave." I loved watching her face as she restrained her emotions. The students were a bit surprised. Time to fuel the flames against Dumbledore and his Order.</p><p>"Professor Snape." She corrected me. Well, she was going to be like that. No banana bread for her. I leaned back in his chair, waiting. "You may borrow my copy and read the chapter."</p><p>"No thanks, I am busy watching that baby dragon flying around." I watched it as I made a fly by the window and all the students ran to the windows to watch. I skipped out of the class as she tried to regain control. *Hey, that transfiguration worked. Flying stuff dragon.* I grinned as I walked toward my next class as I heard Severus snort.</p><p>I arrived at the empty DADA classroom. *How is your class?*</p><p>*Wonderful, we are going to have enough banana bread for everyone. My next class is making tacos. I have been craving one.*</p><p>*I will be down after I fix this class.*</p><p>*Have fun.*</p><p>*You too.*</p><p>I was leaning back in my chair with my feet on the desk when the door opened and in walked the Muttley duo. *Merlin*</p><p>*What? What is wrong?* I could hear the panic in Severus' voice.</p><p>*The mutts are the professors.* I worked on calming myself down. I know they weren't listed as the instructors on my timetable.</p><p>"Harry!" Black almost rushed to me.</p><p>"Get away from me, Fleabag."</p><p>*What happened to Rickets or Brackets?* I heard Severus ask. I didn't remember the guy's name either.</p><p>*No idea but you know why they are here.* I kept trying to dodge Black as he kept trying to hug me, I was almost to the door when Lupin finally got control of Black.</p><p>"Sirius, sit down. Remember we talked about this." I heard him say to the mutt. I watched as they went to a corner and started whispering and saw Black making gestures toward me.</p><p>*Yes. Have fun with them. It's not like they will expel you."</p><p>I grinned. *Sev is that spell MoldieVoldie used on some of the recruits classified as dark?*</p><p>*Which one?*</p><p>*The one from our first session.*</p><p>I heard Severus laugh. *No, and it's one they used on me.*</p><p>*Well, I think I can be out of here within twenty minutes.*</p><p>*I will save some of the taco makings for you.*</p><p>I waited as the class started to fill up. Everyone was wondering what was going on as they didn't see their professor. Lupin moved to the front of the room. "Hello. I am Professor Lupin and this is my assistant, Professor Black. We are taking over as Professor Brackett needed to return to his family."</p><p>'I bet.' I thought to myself, more like he was ousted. I listened as the two of them began to explain the new spell we were going to be learning. A shield? What? That was taught to us in my fourth year, not sixth. I have had enough and discreetly wave my hand under the table and soon Black and Lupin are hanging upside down from the ceiling, dressed as ballerinas in pink tutus. The ballerinas and pink tutus were my own idea. MoldieVoldie hung up the recruits to test their pain levels, trust me, you don't want to know. Everyone started laughing and I slipped out to head to Sev's class. I arrived in time to brown the meat.</p>
