    <p>Dust was floating around in the beams of sunlight filtering in from the stained glass windows. Rows and rows of books, old and new sat on  wooden shelves. Thick carpets muffled the footsteps from browsing clients. A few rows down,  whispered conversations could be heard. It was soothing.</p><p>Harry came to the library to feel safe, nowadays. This one didn’t have a restricted section with screaming books, or a bad-tempered old witch watching his every step. No. The Ministry Library was everything he ever imagined a library to be when he was a young child and forbidden to go. It was a place of knowledge, of respect, of privacy.</p><p>And a place where Draco Malfoy went, too. Apparently. Harry had been casually leafing through a thick volume about Arithmancy when his old nemesis stood next to him. <br/>“Picking up new skills, Potter?” He whispered, and it was so odd, so strange to hear Malfoy whisper, that Harry forgot to get pissy. </p><p>“What are you doing here?” He asked, his voice just too loud for a whisper. Malfoy smirked at him, and pressed a finger against Harry’s lips. <br/>Before he could process the fact that Malfoy was touching him, the blond had already waved his wand -the very wand Harry had returned to him not a week ago- around them. Harry could feel the hush of a Muffliato and saw the shimmer of a disillusionment spell.<br/>“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?!”</p><p>“Settling a debt, Potter, what does it look like? Ever had your cock sucked in a library?”<br/>Harry swallowed, feeling Malfoy’s words go straight to his dick.<br/>“I - I haven’t,”He said hoarsely. <br/>“Would you like to?”<br/>Wordlessly, and rather incredulously, Harry nodded. He thought Malfoy was kidding, and decided to go with the joke.<br/>With that, Malfoy backed him against the shelf, dropped to his knees and deftly opened Harry’s fly. He wrapped long, cool fingers around Harry’s cock, giving it a few quick strokes which had immediate effect. Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Malfoy had already taken him between his lips, and  all Harry could do was to throw his head back and moan. The book on arithmancy dropped to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He’d never expected this, not in a million years, but holy fuck, it felt so good. Malfoy eagerly swallowed down his length, covering him with hot, slick saliva that caused electric sparks to dance along Harry’s spine. This couldn’t be right, could it? This wasn’t what they did together. Vaguely thinking about pushing Malfoy away, Harry pressed a palm against Malfoy’s forehead, feeling the blond’s fringe tickle  his fingers. And Malfoy moaned, causing a very much uncalled for but undeniably erotic sensation to shoot from Harry’s cock up to his brains. </p><p>He slumped against the bookshelf, the hand on Malfoy’s head taking hold of the blond locks and keeping him in place while his hips rocked up, fucking Malfoy’s mouth. Instead of protesting, or trying to pull away, Malfoy simply let out another one of those delicious moans, causing Harry to join in, shuddering with pleasure and closing his eyes. He felt Malfoy shift slightly and when he opened his eyes again to look, saw that Draco was palming his own crotch through his posh, pressed trousers. </p><p>Malfoy was enjoying this. <br/>Fuck, that made it even hotter.</p><p>Vaguely wondering where the git had learned to suck dick so well, Harry found himself enthralled by the sight of his cock emerging and disappearing between his thin, pink lips. It was a kind of magic in and of its own. Not even Ginny had managed to get him this worked up this fast. </p><p>No, that was a mistake.<br/>No thinking of Ginny right now.<br/>That was over.</p><p>Groaning softly, Harry shut his eyes again, focusing only on the sensations Malfoy was providing. It was  too easy to let his brain shut down, feeling the head of his cock thump against the back of Malfoy’s throat. It wouldn’t take long for him to come inside his former rival’s mouth. And damn, if that wasn’t the sexiest thing that had ever happened in his life.</p><p>Peeking through his lashes, he noticed that Malfoy’s cheeks had gained colour as he sucked, that his face was the picture of erotic indulgence. The hand between his legs was shamelessly rubbing now, and if Harry craned his neck enough, he could just see the outline of Malfoy’s erection through his trousers. </p><p>“Fuck yes, Malfoy, I want you to wank for me,” he said, voice slurring, watching as Malfoy’s eyes grew wide and the hand hesitated for the briefest moment before Malfoy apparently decided to throw all caution to the wind and ripped his own own fly open, taking his flushed cock out for Harry to see. </p><p>Drips of precome were dripping down the tip of his cock, and Harry yanked on Malfoy’s hair, moaning incoherently as he fucked hard into his hot, wet mouth. Merlin, Jesus and Apollo- this was brilliant!</p><p>They were both lost now, Harry breathing heavily and Malfoy moaning around his cock with each stroke. Malfoy’s free hand moved to cup Harry’s balls, fondling them almost tenderly. As if beckoning Harry to fuck his mouth even deeper. </p><p>He didn’t have to ask twice. </p><p>Holding Malfoy’s head firmly in place by his hair, Harry thrust all the way into his mouth once, twice and- “Yes, fuck!” came hard, his load shooting into Draco’s throat and spilling over his lips. The lewd moan Malfoy made caused him to open his eyes, watching as the blond sucked him dry and spilled his own load over the library floor. </p><p>It was all so filthy and utterly, devastatingly hot - Harry could hardly process that it’d really happened. </p><p>But here he was, still leaning against a shelf as his legs collapsed under him and Malfoy eagerly lapped him clean.<br/>“That was fantastic,” Harry heard himself whisper reverently. “I didn’t know you could do that.” </p><p>“So that’s my debt to you settled, then?” Malfoy asked, tucking Harry back in and wiping his mouth. His voice sounded raw, damaged by the brutal pounding his mouth had taken. <br/>“Uh.” Harry blushed, watching as Malfoy put his own dick away, casting a scourgify on the floor. <br/>“What debt?”<br/>“I’m glad we understand each other,” Malfoy said, getting up and straightening his clothes. <br/>“Have a lovely day, Potter.” <br/>“Wait, Malfoy, I-”<br/>Harry hurried to push himself up on shaky legs, staring at the other man, whose face was now the blank, cold mask he showed when impatient. Nothing like the flushed, aroused human Harry had seen just a minute ago. <br/>“Keep quiet, we’re in a library.” <br/>With that, Malfoy cancelled their privacy spells, raising a single eyebrow. Challenging Harry to speak. <br/>“Uhm. Can I… when… Can I see you again?”<br/>“Every day, Potter. Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. I figure you’re quite prone to get involved.”</p><p>With that, Malfoy walked away and disappeared behind the next shelf, leaving Harry behind to pick up his book and ponder, a strange little smile on his face. </p><p>This had been a very relaxing trip to the library indeed.</p>
