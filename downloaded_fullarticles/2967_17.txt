          <div class="userstuff"><p>Tina was still attempting to deal with the fact that she hadn't managed to save Newt from MACUSA's death cell. In his attempt to save her, he had gotten himself killed.  She had managed to save his suitcase though, all of his creatures were her responsibility now. She couldn't face them, to tell them that 'mummy' was gone, so she didn't but eventually they needed fed. She went to Queenie for help.  "The Occamys need fed."  Queenie looked at her sister sadly, "You're going to have to face them eventually, Teen."  "I know... it's just", Tina became flustered. "I'm sorry ... He used to do it all the time; he'd never let me ..."  "They're relying on you Tina, do you want me to come for moral support?"  "Yes...please", Tina managed to squeak out.</p></div>
