    <p>“I really don’t see why I have to go back.” </p><p>“You’ll regret it if you don’t.” Narcissa sounded exasperated and it gave Draco pause. The conversation rarely went further than that, but this time Draco decided to push a little bit further.</p><p>“Nobody else from my class is, though.” He looked at his mother in the mirror, adjusting his silver tie so that it was a little too tight. No need for comfort when he didn’t deserve it.</p><p>“There will be people from other houses that were in your year.” She didn’t look up from the piece of parchment placed delicately over her lap. He didn’t know what she was writing but he was in awe of the fact that she could do so without a hard surface underneath. He assumed magic was involved.</p><p>“Did you just give me permission to hang out with a ‘Puff? Or worse yet, Potter?” Although, that didn’t sound so terrible anymore; someone was better than no one.</p><p>“Draco.” Narcissa’s voice was a clear warning for his tone. He refrained from rolling his eyes, instead diverting his attention to the cuffs of the jacket he had on. </p><p>“I’m sorry, mother. Truthfully, I don’t mind going back,” Lie, “I just wish I didn’t have to wear this ghastly uniform. If you can even call it that.” He watched his face curl into something awful, a snarl on his lips and petulance in his eyes. The look quickly vanished, replaced by one of guilt that was not helped by his mother’s next words.</p><p>“Minerva didn’t want your houses to separate you all.” She sounded tired, as if she had had this conversation a million times over. That wasn’t fair, Draco thought as he recalled a distinct lack of communication over the past five months.</p><p>“The younger ones still get to wear their colours. And their robes.” He was guessing, of course. Truly he had no idea what was going to happen come September 1st. He had been too fearful to leave the Manor grounds since the war had ended. His father was locked up in some new type of Azkaban where they had muggle technology and highly trained aurors in place of dementors. His mother was on indefinite house arrest. They were not allowed to receive any mail, including a subscription to the Daily Prophet, and as such they had been left in the dark about much of the wizarding world. He didn’t even know if the castle was ready for students yet.</p><p>“The ‘younger ones’ aren’t eighth years who fought in a war. Besides, I think that it suits you.” She wasn’t even looking at him.</p><p>“Obviously you do, you’re my mother. Though don’t you think there’s something off about it?” He turned to the side, watching in the mirror as the material moved with his body precisely, rather than flowed like a robe.</p><p>“Well, darling, it is muggle attire.”</p><p>“What?” Despite the casualness of her voice Draco was sure his mother was joking. There’s no way that this could be allowed; years of tradition, shattered. And for what? Inclusivity?</p><p>“Yes, a blazer is a traditional muggle article of clothing.” Narcissa placed the parchment on a tray that a house elf was stood holding. She dismissed Blinky, who left the two blondes alone at once, ever obedient. Draco was sick of it.</p><p>“And you’re letting me wear it?” He purposefully did not watch the house elf limp out of the room.</p><p>“Your father has some reservations, but he values your education above anything else at the moment.” </p><p>“I know.” He did not mean to say this out loud, but he was not entirely unhappy that he did. His father still managed to have a vice grip on the goings on of the manor, despite being over a hundred miles away. It was command after command coming from Lucius. Not once did he ask Draco how he was. </p><p>“Draco.” Narcissa was stood behind him now, smoothing out the non-existent wrinkles in the shoulders of his blazer. What a stupid name. Blazer. <br/>
“What? You have to admit, mother, he has been rather off with me lately. It’s almost as if he’s disappointed in me. For what, I shall never seem to know seeing as I was only doing as he had instructed-” He’d opened this can of worms, he may as well use the bait.</p><p>“Draco, you know we’re not to speak of this.” Her voice turned cold once more as she interrupted him, and Draco was reminded that it was not only he who was affected by the events of the past two years. He felt his face pale a bit as he saw the facade in her eyes drop slightly before closing back up. He didn’t want to burden her with this.</p><p>He cleared his throat, “Who else am I meant to talk to about it?”</p><p>“Perhaps some of your classmates once you return to Hogwarts?” Draco scoffed at the insinuation he’d have friends.</p><p>“Yes, because it’s likely that Harry Potter would love to hear all about my experiences with the Dark Lord.” He rolled his eyes and moved to sit in the arm chair his mother had just vacated.</p><p>“You never know, darling.” Narcissa followed Draco’s movements in the mirror as he threw the blazer off and slumped into the plush emerald chair. He dropped his head into his hands and sighed. She thought that he had never looked so much like his father.</p><p>“In this case mother, I know for certain. He won’t bother to spare one glance in my direction, let alone have a conversation with me. Of course, this is assuming he’s there at all.” Draco would never admit it audibly, but he thought that somehow returning to Hogwarts would be worse if Potter were not there.</p><p>“I can’t imagine Minerva would let him do anything else.”</p><p>“Still, even if he wanted to talk to me, Weasley and Granger wouldn’t let him.” He must make a note to use their first names upon returning to the castle; it would do him no good to keep enemies when he has no friends.</p><p>“Then perhaps someone else? Someone less… Gryffindor?” Draco looked up as his mother sat across from him. It was clear that she was gearing up for a serious conversation, and he felt himself sit up straighter in the armchair.</p><p>“So, when you said, ‘other houses’ what you really meant was ‘anyone but a Gryffindor’?” His interest was piqued, that was for sure, but he was never one to turn down picking apart his mother’s words. It was a game they played when he was younger. She would say something, and he would have to work out the true meaning of it. It dawned on him that perhaps she was preparing him for when the Dark Lord returned and once again held power.</p><p>She was undeterred, “What about that Ravenclaw girl?” </p><p>“Who, Chang?” He didn’t even know his mother knew of her, and besides, “She was the year above.”</p><p>“No, the one who…” She trailed off, a slight frown present on her face. She turned to look out of the window behind them, appeared to be thinking very deeply. Draco did not wish to disturb her, but his curiosity got the better of him.</p><p>“Mother?”</p><p>“You didn’t know of this, Draco, and this is the only time I will ever say it so listen closely.” Her words were sudden, sharp, and Draco had no choice but to comply. He nodded, leaning toward his mother in anticipation, “There was a girl, taken from the Hogwarts express and brought here during the war. It was just before Christmas, but she escaped with Potter when you failed to identify him.” </p><p>“Who was she?” His stomach had turned to led and dropped to his feet. Clearly, she was a Ravenclaw, but Draco only knew of a few; cared about even less. Although ‘cared’ was a very strong word to be using. Still, his heart pounded.</p><p>“I can’t remember her name. I wasn’t allowed to know much, only that her father was printing terrible – albeit true – things about the Dark Lord and that she had to be held here as leverage to get him to stop.”</p><p>“Printing? Did he work for the Prophet? How did I not know of this?” Draco’s fear was increased by this knowledge. If the girl was who he thought it could be…</p><p>“Not the Prophet, an independent magazine. The Quizzlet or something.”</p><p>“…The Quibbler?” His hesitation, quiet voice, the picking at a loose thread, all went unnoticed by his mother who stood up to stare out of the window properly. There was an air to her voice now that told Draco that his mother held more regrets than she let on, and that the imprisonment of this girl was one of them.</p><p>“Yes, that’s it. I only saw the girl once, but she was wearing a Ravenclaw scarf. I remember because there was blood on it, the blue and red mixing together to create a purple that contrasted so greatly with her white hair.” At that piece of information, Draco was certain. There were many blonde Ravenclaws, but he had only ever known one to have hair as light as his.</p><p>“Luna Lovegood.” He was surprised that his voice didn’t crack, he certainly felt like it should have.</p><p>“Excuse me?” His mother had clearly been lost in a world of guilt; land that he was all too familiar with himself. </p><p>“Her name. I know her. I used to… everyone calls her ‘Looney’ because of me.” He rose again, too frustrated now to sit still. Standing in front of the mirror once more, he placed his hands on either side and scrutinised his face, “Crabbe and Goyle tormented her endlessly on my command. I even convinced some of the other Ravenclaws to help hide her belongings. We were ruthless, and for no reason. She was just… different. Oh, and she started hanging around Potter in fifth year which didn’t help matters.”</p><p>“Oh, Draco.” Narcissa moved away from the window to once more stand behind him at the mirror.</p><p>“Don’t, mother. I know now how terrible I was, there is no need for disappointment.” He held enough of it himself, he didn’t need hers to add to the mix.</p><p>“Okay, darling.” It was rare that she listened to him in this manner, and so he took her moving back to the armchair in silence as an invite to ask more questions.</p><p>“Why wasn’t I told?” He had too many lines on his face for someone who had only lived for nineteen years.</p><p>“They weren’t sure whether you knew her or not. They couldn’t risk it if you had had previously relations with her.” Previous relations, as if he would have risked such a thing when his father was so against it. Draco noted his mother’s phrasing – ‘they’ – she wants to be sure that he knows she played no part in the event.</p><p>“Why not just ask? I’m sure Aunt Bella would have found a way to do so without letting me know why. And was Severus aware of the situation? I’m sorry for all the questions, mother, but you must understand my confusion.”</p><p>“It’s okay, Draco. You’re correct in thinking that my sister found a way… but I refused to let her do so. It was too intrusive.”</p><p>“Legilimency.” His mother was always trying to protect him. She did not know of his ability to resist the spell.</p><p>“Precisely. As for Severus, I do not know. Like I said, I was not told much.” He could always count on her to tell him the truth. She is matter-of-fact, but in such a way that still warms you to her; makes you feel comfortable in a house of cold, dark marble.</p><p>“What do you know of her time here?” He needed to know what he was facing upon his return to Hogwarts. Will she be yet another person he can’t bear to even hear the name of? </p><p>“Very little. She was treated much better than Ollivander, I know that much. Though the same could be said for literally anyone. That poor man.” She sounded so remorseful. He never knew his mother to have such emotion.</p><p>“He didn’t deserve such treatment.” He watched as anger and guilt flared in his eyes once more. He was too tired to put up defenses, and he wondered how many people at Hogwarts would show forgiveness once they saw the turmoil he faced in his own head. Whatever forgiveness they did show would be undeserved.</p><p>“I know dear, but there was nothing we could have done.” Draco pushed himself off of the wall, turned away from the mirror. He looked his mother right in the eye as he said, already dreading the answer:</p><p>“You say she was treated better, but not to what extent. Mother, will she be able to even be in the same building as me?”</p><p>“Draco, you had nothing to do with it-”</p><p>“That matters not to someone who Harry Potter is friends with.” He started toward the door, intending to leave with a notion of drama – something that he was well aware he picked up from his father.</p><p>“What do you mean by that?” Her question stopped him just as his hand fell on the door handle. Surely, she understood by now? After all these years of his complaints?</p><p>“I mean that he’s been poisoning everyone’s minds against me ever since first year and that I’m sure Lovegood was no exception. Couple that with her imprisonment and I’m sure she detests me.” He spat the words out as if they were the draught of living death. He was angry because he knew it was true. Everything that Potter had said about him as true. He was a coward. He was vile, cruel, a villain if ever there was. </p><p>“Oh, darling, I’m sure that’s not true.” Narcissa didn’t sound very convinced, though she also didn’t sound as if she cared very much. Draco secretly hoped that she had merely decided that she had shown enough emotion for the evening and that she was in fact fearful of her sons return to the wizarding school just as much as he.</p><p>“How sure?” Draco tested her, and he hates himself for it. She is the only one he can truly trust and yet his mouth insists on trying to destroy this relationship as well.</p><p>“Would you like me to work out the math?” A smirk to try and lighten the mood. Narcissa could sense the anger, no, the fear building in her son and she wanted to put out the flame before it took his mind like it did Lucius’.</p><p>“This is not a joke, mother. I’m going to be completely friendless, I’m sure. Even if someone wanted to reach out, they wouldn’t dare.”</p><p>“And why not?” Her voice was cold again, knowing exactly what her son was about to say and hating the truth behind it.</p><p>“Because I’m a Malfoy.” And with that, he left the room.</p>
