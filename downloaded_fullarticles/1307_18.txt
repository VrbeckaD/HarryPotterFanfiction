    <p>Leta Lestrange had not been expecting to have a baby. She was also not expecting for her boyfriend to leave as soon as she had told him that she was pregnant. She hadn’t wanted to give up the baby though, and through hours of labour she had been greeted with a baby girl who she had named Bonnie.</p><p>She had mostly made it through on her own, with the occasional bit of help from her elder Half-Brother but, she had managed to get through it all alone. It was when Bonnie was six that Leta had to move, due to the building that she was in getting too expensive for her to stay in.</p><p>She had gotten a good job, assistant to some important office worker and she had found a school for her daughter nearby the flats that she was moving into.</p><p> </p><p>Leta was stood surrounded by boxes in the small, two-bedroom apartment that she had gotten for herself and Bonnie. She stood, hands on her hips and looked around, trying to figure out where she could start. The furniture had been moved in the day before, with the beds in their respective bedrooms and a couple of drawers and wardrobes, along with a sofa.</p><p>The rest of her furniture was in some of the bigger boxes.</p><p>“Mummy! Can I go and play?” Bonnie sounded from behind one of the boxes, dog plushie clenched in her hands.</p><p>“Yeah. Go and play, I’ll get things out of their boxes.” Leta opened one of them and started unpacking.</p><p> </p><p>What Leta hadn’t known was that the door to the apartment was still open, and Bonnie thinking that it was just more of the apartment ventured out.</p><p>The young girl walked along the corridors and down the stairs, paying no attention to the fact that she was no longer in the apartment with her mother. She had dropped her dog plushie on the way down the stairs though, and only realised when she had gotten into the main lobby of the building.</p><p> </p><p>Theseus Scamander was a hard worker. He had an important job and had always been someone that people had their eye on since school.</p><p>He lived in the same building as Leta did, and he had noticed things being moved in but, hadn’t had the chance to say hello yet. He had made a mental note to himself to do that later on.</p><p>He had been walking down the stairs when he came across a toy dog on one of them. The man leaned down and picked it up, he figured that a child must have dropped it and he had started to go over to Lost and Found when he felt a small hand tugging at his coat.</p><p>“You got my dog,” Bonnie spoke and looked up to the unfamiliar man.</p><p>“Ah this little guy is yours?” Theseus smiled kindly and handed over the toy dog to the girl. He frowned though, seeing that she was alone. “Where’s your mum?”</p><p>“Upstairs,” Bonnie shrugged slightly.</p><p>“Shall we go and find her? She’s probably worried about you.”</p><p>“Okay,” Bonnie nodded and started heading over to the stairs.</p><p> </p><p>Leta frowned when everything seemed a little too quiet in the apartment.</p><p>“Bonnie?” she called out, waiting for an answer.</p><p>When she didn’t hear anything, Leta went through both bedrooms, looking under the beds and in the wardrobes. She came back out and noticed that the front door was still open, and she felt her heart do a little jolt.</p><p>“Bonnie!?” she called out again and walked out of the apartment. “Come on baby, where are you?”</p><p>She headed down the stairs and let out a sigh of relief when she saw her daughter.</p><p>“There you are! I was so worried about you!” Leta came to the bottom of the stairs and enveloped her daughter in a tight hug.</p><p>“You must be her mother,” Theseus spoke and smiled at Leta.</p><p>“He helped find Floppy Dog,” Bonnie told her mother and held up the dog toy once Leta had stopped hugging her.</p><p>“Well, that was very kind. Thank you for finding her and finding the dog.”</p><p>“Floppy Dog!”</p><p>“Finding Floppy Dog sorry,” Leta smiled and ruffled Bonnie’s hair.</p><p>Theseus couldn’t help but smile fondly and looked between Leta and her daughter. There was a resemblance there, it was uncanny, so he was positive that this was the girl’s mother. Through the similarities and through her worry as well.</p><p>“Well, I wasn’t going to let her wander these halls alone. You gonna be a good girl and keep Floppy Dog safe? And not run away from your mum?” Theseus looked towards Bonnie with a little smile.</p><p>Bonnie nodded and moved to hide her face in her mum’s side, suddenly becoming quite shy. She wasn’t really used to speaking to men.</p><p>“Have you just moved in?” Theseus asked Leta, looking towards her.</p><p>“Yeah. We’re still unpacking at the moment, just moved in today,” she told him with a smile.</p><p>“Then you’re next to me. I would have come and knocked to say hello later but, I can say hello now,” he grinned and extended a hand for her to shake. “Theseus Scamander.”</p><p>“Leta. Leta Lestrange,” she answered and shook his hand. “And this little one is Bonnie,” she pointed down to her daughter. “It’s nice to meet you Theseus. I’m sure that we’ll be seeing more of each other seeing as we’re neighbours.”</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you two. Both of you. If you ever need any help, or need anything to borrow then feel free to knock,” he offered. “I’ll see you around, I really should be getting to work,” he pointed towards the door.</p><p>“Of course. I’ll see you around,” Leta nodded and watched him for a moment. “Thank you again for making sure that Bonnie didn’t get too far,” she told him and waved as she went back upstairs to the apartment with her daughter.</p>
