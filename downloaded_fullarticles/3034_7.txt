    <p>Ron sighed as he looked around the loft. It had been a long night: the rising sun was colouring the room with violets and pinks.</p><p>"It's good to be back home," he said. He wondered for how much longer it would be home.</p><p>Snape helped Ron to the couch and let him drop onto it. The Quietus had worn off so much faster than normal. He assumed that it responded to stress and the night had been wrought with it. He went to make a note of that on a pad, so he wouldn't forget it. So, forcing himself to be honest - at least with himself - it would give him something to do instead of asking Ron about his meeting with his siblings.</p><p>"Se..ver...rus."</p><p>Snape looked up. Ron only used his first name when he wanted to make a point. Snape was easier to get out.</p><p>"Can we go to bed and discuss this later?"</p><p>Snape nodded and went to turn down Ron's bed.</p><p>"No. Our bed. Unless you don't..."</p><p>Snape sat down on the edge of Ron's bed. "I'm not your family," he snapped, "finish your sentence."</p><p>Exhausted as he was, Ron found a smile appearing on his face. "Thank you." Then he lost it. "Unless you don't want me in it."</p><p>Snape cocked his head. "Is this about a pity-fuck again?"</p><p>Ron let his head drop back onto the couch. "Tonight I wasn't much help."</p><p>Snape nodded. He stood up and walked slowly over to the man watching him. "All too true. Why," his voice dripped with his old Potions instructor's sarcasm, "all you did was allow yourself to be offered as bait for a bunch of insane, sadistic bastards. To allow yourself to be tortured while we waited for the ringleader to show up. Why truly, Weasley, you contributed absolutely nothing to the evening's entertainment."</p><p>By then he had reached Ron and, grabbing him by the shoulders, he drew him off the couch and into his arms. Ron dropped his head onto Snape's shoulder and held on as tightly as he could.</p><p>"Bed," said Snape.</p><p>"Our bed," said Ron.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>It was evening when they woke. They ate and then went up to the workshop. Ron sat at his table and played solitaire while Snape checked on some experiments, made notes and generally behaved as if it were just a regular day.</p><p>Until Ron threw out, casually, "Did you ward the building against apparation?"</p><p>Snape looked up from his work. He sat straight and watched a moment as Ron placed a card on top of another. "Yes. How did you know?"</p><p>Ron looked up. "That's what I would have done." He placed his hands on the table, eyes on their tremors as though he were seeing them for the first time. "I love my family. But I am twenty-nine years old. I am not a child even if I can't control my body. Even if my mind doesn't work as it should. I left their care five years ago because they loved me. Too much."</p><p>He looked over at Snape. "I never would be sitting here playing cards if I had stayed with them. Leaving them forced me to depend on myself. I survived, not well I'll admit, but I did survive. And since finding you, it's more than survival. You force me to use my brain again. You support me but you expect me to do my share. It's more than allowing me to finish my sentences. You let me fail and then you expect me to try again. Which because you do, I do. You've given me hope. And love."</p><p>He looked back at his hands again. "I wonder what I've given you."</p><p>There was a long silence during which Ron wondered if his sister might not be right; that, to Snape, he was nothing more than an experiment, truly the guinea pig he called himself.</p><p>"Unlike you..."</p><p>Ron was startled when Snape spoke. He was no longer expecting an answer.</p><p>"...I am not loved by my family. They are bureaucrats. Rules and regulations and expectations are all that are important to them." He looked, a little sheepish. "Yes, I know. My behaviour at Hogwarts. What can I say other than I come by that naturally. And it made certain that no one would try to get friendly with me. Which was important at the time." He turned thoughtful. "The most rebellious my brothers...I have two older ones, by the way...my brothers got was my eldest drove a motorcycle from the Department of Transport one year and he allowed me to drive it against our father's wishes. Twice. He disliked it and used it only because, as a member of the Department, he had to be familiar with all their vehicles. I loved it. My father had forbidden him to let me use it as he felt it would only encourage my defiance."</p><p>There was a short pause while Snape was lost in memories. "My father," he finally said, "liked to be obeyed immediately, without question. I liked to question. And I was not blindfully obedient. When I was done at Hogwarts, he informed me that either I conformed to his expectations and his rules, continued on the career path which he had selected for me - which had nothing to do with Potions, a waste of time in his opinion - or I could forget about belonging to the family." He looked over at Ron. "I suppose, if I wanted, I could use that as an excuse for my being drawn to Voldemort. He convinced me he liked me as I was. At the least, he thought my abilities with potions were well worth encouraging."</p><p>Snape shrugged. "I understand that one of my brothers has attained some senior Ministry position and that the other is working his way to another. They have done our father proud. I, on the other hand, have proven, as my father predicted, to be worthless and an embarrassment to the family. That I became a Death Eater did not surprise him, at least according to my elder brother. We met once, years ago, before the War, and he informed me that I should be in Azkaban if it weren't for Dumbledore's interference. And that it would be good riddance when I did end up there."</p><p>"But, surely, when it became known that you'd been working for us?"</p><p>Snape shook his head. "That would have meant they would have had to acknowledge that they had been wrong about me, and that would...that will never happen."</p><p>He looked over at Ron. "So you want to know what I am getting out of this relationship. Well, companionship for one. I like having you around. Which, I must admit, surprises me. I have a solitary nature and thought you being around all the time would drive me insane. Instead, I find you easy to get along with. I enjoy having you with me here as I work. I like the talks we share at night. I like that I can share the Muggle things I have grown fond of with you. I find that, over the past months, my feelings for you have deepened. I admire you. Your courage overwhelms me at times. Like yesterday. I am in awe of your determination to deal with and if possible overcome the effects of the Subitomoves, even without the Quietus. And I like you. You've become very important to me."</p><p>Ron smiled. "I like you, too, Se...ver...rus. And I love you."</p><p>"An old git like me?"</p><p>Ron's grin crinkled his eyes. "I love the way you kiss."</p><p>Some of the tension left Snape's face. "I seem to be growing very fond of your kisses as well."</p><p>"As for my family," Ron hated to see the tension return to Snape's face, but they had to deal with it, "they will meddle, unfortunately," he sighed, "all with the best of intentions, until they understand that we are the only ones who make any decisions about this relationship."</p><p>That was easier said than done.</p><p>Ginny was not pleased that the warehouse had been warded against apparation. She was certain that Snape had done so that the family might not see what he did to Ron in order to control him. She was also certain that Snape was using the Quietus as a hold over Ron. Ron, after a stilted meeting with his father, agreed to meet with his parents and Ginny, in a private room at Miss Jones's library, especially warded for the occasion. Without Snape, also at his father's suggestion. Molly and Ginny had been certain that the location had been Snape's choice. Ron had in fact been the one to suggest it: he didn't trust Ginny's new powers as an Auror to keep him at home should they meet there.</p><p>"He was always so slimy when he was at Hogwarts and I doubt that he's changed. What other way does he have of keeping someone near him without some hold?"</p><p>Molly Weasley had been horrified when Ron had left the safety of his home for the world of Muggles, when he had left her care. That he preferred to stay - in spite of all her reasonings, her promises, and even her pleas - with Severus Snape, a man she did not trust further than she could spit, made her weep. Like Ginny, she was certain that Snape was using the Quietus to keep Ron as his...</p><p>"His what?" Ron finally snapped, "His slave? Merlin! Mother, is that what you're saying? What the bloody hell use could a Potions Master, a wizard with his powers, have for a trembling gimp like myself if not as a slave? A sex slave, I suppose?"</p><p>Arthur stepped in and tried to console his wife at the same time as deal with his daughter's mistrust and his son's anger. He succeeded at none.</p><p>Charlie and Bill had refused to side with their mother and sister. "It's Ron's life," Bill had written from Egypt. "It's his decision."</p><p>Charlie had been very frank with his father. "I've seen the two of them together. Snape may not be what you had in mind for Ron, but he's Ron's choice. I didn't see any signs that Ron is with Snape against his will. Or that he's been spelled to give that impression. Leave them alone if you can't accept them as a couple."</p><p>They tried.</p><p>Arthur and Molly accepted an invitation to the warehouse.</p><p>The evening was a disaster from their arrival in Dock Road. To begin with, the neighbourhood scandalized Molly. She was certain that Ron would be murdered if he remained with Muggles like the ones she had seen on their way to the warehouse. Ron had wanted to be able to speak clearly and so had taken a dose of Quietus. His mother was furious, certain that Ron's inability to move more than a hand was Snape's showing them the power he had over their son. It didn't matter what Ron said, she didn't believe him. Snape said absolutely nothing, just sat in his chair next to Ron, wearing his old Potions instructor's face, allowing her to accuse him of all sorts of sins and crimes, never once responding to them, until Ron got so upset that he began stuttering again.</p><p>At that point, Snape stood up, looking every inch the powerful wizard he was, and indicated that the Weasleys were visitors who had overstayed their welcome.</p><p>After that, Ginny was certain that Snape was using an Imperius Curse to control Ron. She went to her supervisor and demanded that Hermione use the powers of her office to call both men in so that Ron could be examined and Snape arrested.</p><p>Granger was reluctant to get involved. Still, when Ginny and her mother began investigating the procedure to bring charges of improper use of magic and kidnapping against Snape, she went to see the two men.</p><p>"I'm sorry," she said. "If they convince one of the Under-Ministers that they do indeed have grounds for this suit, you will both be summoned for examination."</p><p>Ron closed his eyes. "Why the hell can't they leave us alone?"</p><p>Hermione shared a look of commiseration with Snape. "It's because they love you. Because they feel helpless about what was done to you with the Subitomoves. Because Molly feels guilty that her love alone couldn't help you overcome the curse. That they all failed you somehow. Because...</p><p>"Because," interrupted Snape, "if it were anyone but me."</p><p>Hermione nodded her head. "I'm sorry. You played a supporter of Voldemort far too well, Professor. Many still think we were duped by you."</p><p>"That's one of the reasons I left Hogwarts and the wizarding world. I knew that once everyone got over the initial shock of the War, my role in it would be questioned, especially with Dumbledore dead, and I refused to have to defend myself constantly."</p><p>"Our Minister knows better. Aurors do know and are thankful for the dangerous work you undertook. We could not have won without you and the others who were willing to put their lives on the line for information. Unfortunately, personal prejudices are hard to overturn."</p><p>She shrugged. "I think that you should also know that they are trying to locate a Potions Master who would be able to replicate the Quietus. They feel that would eliminate the hold you have over Ron."</p><p>The two men looked at each other. Hermione had not paid all that much attention to them the night of the Crabbe Affair, as it was now called, but tonight she did.</p><p>She had spent six years sharing a House with Ron Weasley. At one time he had been, along with Harry, her best friend. She had known that he would have preferred Harry to care for him in a different manner. It hadn't been hard to figure that out: Ron had mooned too often over Harry their fifth year for her not to catch on. She'd been relieved when he and Neville had gotten together and the friendship of the trio had remained untried. Like Harry, she had covered for the two lovers: she had been astounded at the frequency of their encounters. "Every time they find a dark corner somewhere," she'd told Harry. "Don't they ever get enough?" Harry, she remembered, had only laughed.</p><p>And she'd mourned with Harry when their Ron had been forever changed by Draco Malfoy's disgusting spell. She had visited Ron at St. Mungo's and wept for hours after each visit. She had nevertheless been a consistent visitor while he'd been there, but when he'd been moved home, what with seventh year to get through, N.E.W.T.S, preparing for and then writing Auror entrance exams... Well, the friendship had waned.</p><p>Now, looking at the two men, she saw what Charlie had seen: there was love between the two of them. Real love. And understanding.</p><p>"If we come in voluntarily, would that appease the Ministry?"</p><p>Hermione nodded. She did however notice that neither man indicated that it would appease Molly or Ginny. She couldn't do anything about Molly, but after this, she was going to have a long talk with her subordinate, and if that didn't work, a transfer to some other department might be appropriate. Ginny was a good Auror, but this was affecting her work and her attitude.</p><p>"Ah, Professor, it is indeed a pleasure to meet you again. I'm only sorry it's under these circumstances."</p><p>Snape glared at the tall, rotund wizard coming through the door, a file in hand. He thought a moment and then nodded. "Howe. Angus Howe. You were in...in Ravenclaw. The first year I taught."</p><p>Howe beamed at being remembered. "You were the youngest Potions instructor in the history of the school. Brilliant. Nervous, like one of my father's high-strung horses. Angry. Not just at our not understanding," a smile lit his face again as he quoted, "`the subtle science and exact art that is potions making'."</p><p>Snape only said, "I understand that both Ron and I have satisfied all concerns to the Ministry's specifications. May I ask why I am here now?"</p><p>Howe nodded. "I'm the Aurors' Potions Master." He smiled. "See, you did have an influence on our lives. Now then, I'm a good Potions Master..."</p><p>"You'd have to be better than good," interrupted Snape, "to have this position."</p><p>Howe tried hard to look modest then burst into laughter. "I was called in to verify certain aspects of this situation, Pontefract being only one of them. I understand why you publish and work under a name other than your own. I'm sorry for it: you really should be getting the recognition you deserve."</p><p>"Rather than the one I have?"</p><p>Howe shrugged. "There's little I can do about that. You will have no trouble continuing to publish and work under either name, Professor. But I was also called in to verify the Quietus. You were very kind to provide us with a sample and a list of ingredients."</p><p>Snape snorted. There had been very little kindness in that: it had been the only way he could prove that he was not influencing Ron's behaviour.</p><p>"I'm quite in awe of this discovery. From wart removal to a...well, not a cure, but certainly a possible method of controlling this kind of degenerative nerve disease. Only you, Professor." Howe dropped the file with the formula on the desk. "I was wondering if I might offer a small contribution to the potion?"</p><p>Snape's eyebrow rose high. "As in?"</p><p>"You always warned us against emotion in preparing a potion. That one worked best removed from personal involvement."</p><p>Snape bared his teeth. If this was yet another attempt to separate him from Ron...</p><p>Howe understood. "Magnesium, Professor."</p><p>It took Snape by surprise. "Magnesium, Howe?"</p><p>Howe nodded. "You've got all the bugs worked out. The spasms are diminished to the point where they are negligible. Language ability is stable. You're only lacking muscular control. Oh, it's there, but only in a very minor form. Weasley says he can raise his hand, and grip a little, but that's as much as he can do. You need something to augment the control. Something to bind the potion to the nerves. Magnesium. Just a suggestion."</p><p>Howe watched as Snape's eyes glazed over. As he was lost in a world that both he and Howe shared.</p><p>Howe sat back and waited to see if his suggestion would meet with approval. As he had dared point out to the man who had imbued him with this passion he had for potions, sometimes one was too close to see what small thing was missing. Unlike Snape, he hadn't been working at the potion for months and could view it objectively. It was a little thing, but in an experiment as novel as this one was, it was something he could understand Snape, with his emotional involvement, might have missed.</p><p>And if there was one thing the examinations had made very clear to those conducting them, it was that Snape and Weasley were emotionally committed to each other. Without spells of any kind.</p><p>Snape shook his head, bringing himself back to this room, and turned to nod at the other Potions Master. "It might work."</p><p>Howe beamed again. "I hope so. Will you let me know if it does?"</p><p>Snape looked offended at the suggestion that he might not. "If it does, we will have to present it for publication."</p><p>"I would be honoured to be associated with such a potion, even in this minor way." Howe stood up, came around the desk, offering his hand. Snape stood and took it. "I was wondering if it might be possible for me to visit your workshop some time, Professor. There is a problem I am having with a potion of my own. I would appreciate an objective evaluation of it."</p><p>Snape nodded and accepted the offer of friendship. "You do know that it is not possible to apparate at the warehouse where we live. And that you will have to visit in Muggle clothing so as not to attract attention."</p><p>Howe beamed widely. "I have just the outfit. I picked it up when attending a conference in Hawaii. A shirt that my wife absolutely refuses to allow me to wear at home."</p>
