      <b>Choose Your Chains Wisely.</b>
    </span>
  </span>
</p>
<p>Despite popular opinion, Severus Snape doesn’t underestimate himself. He may rarely fight for it, but he’s perfectly capable of snatching invaluable treasure from anyone moronic enough to believe he isn’t 'proper' competition. <br/> <br/> Draco shouldn’t have pursued Harry. He’d known about Severus’ feelings and should have realized Severus wouldn’t let him trap the Gryffindor with the wrong chains. <br/> <br/> Today, as Severus twirls his newly-betrothed round the ballroom, the look he sends Draco’s way isn’t triumphant, but pleading: 'Don't turn into your father, boy. Don't assume having beauty makes you beautiful. Or that wealth equals worth. Don’t trade your heart for power.”<br/><br/><br/></p></div>
