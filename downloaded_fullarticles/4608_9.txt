Was it only a year ago that out 'It' girl mysteriously disappeared for quote 'boarding school' ? And just like that, she's back. And what about our Prince, he left a year ago without word and just as suddenly he's back, don't believe me ? See for yourselves. Lucky for us, Melanie91 and Helena92 send proof. Thanks for the photos, girls.</em>
</p><hr/><p>At Grand Central Station,walking through the station is a young man, he is carrying a red carry-on suitcase. He walks up the stairs towards the exit where he sees his and his sister's friend Serena, he walks up to her, taps her shoulder and when she turns and sees Fáelán she exclaims "oh my god, Fáelán" she hugs him before she lets go and asks "what are you doing here ?"</p><p>"well, I just got back in fact, I've been gone for a year, I was in Russia, Tibet, New Orleans, China, Dubai, Machu Picchu and Scandinavia, I needed the year away" he replies as they walk through the station, they stop to talk to the driver that had been sent for Serena who allows Fáelán to ride with them since they are heading to the same place not knowing that they are being watched by a guy with short hair, someone that they don't even know but knows them.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Spotted: Lonely Boy, Can't believe the love of his life has returned. If only they knew who he was. But everyone knows them. And everyone is talking. Wonder what Blair Waldorf thinks ? Sure Serena and her are BFFs and She's the Prince's sister but rumor has it that Blair's boyfriend, Nate, had a thing for one of them.</em>
</p><hr/><p>At a party, a girl in a bathroom, her phone goes off, she checks it to find a message on it saying 'Serena is back!' The girl leaves the bathroom, in search of her boyfriend, Nate. She bumps into her mother who says to her "Blair, if you're going to wear one of my designs, tell me, so we can at least get it properly fitted"</p><p>"thanks, mom, I'll keep that in mind" Blair replies, she then adds "great party" before she walks away to find her boyfriend.</p><p>She hears her mother say "she is my best advertisement"</p><p>She finds him talking with his father and a few other men, she walks up and says to Nate's father "excuse me, Captain" she then asks Nate "Nate, can I borrow you ?"</p><p>"uh, sure" he replies, he asks the men "can you excuse me for a sec ?" the men nod and Blair drags Nate away from the men, they hear someone call out "Nathaniel, Any interest in some fresh air ?" making a signal for a cigarette.</p><p>"when I get back ?" replies Nate.</p><p>"if he gets back" says Blair, she pulls Nate into one of the rooms. "what's going on ?" asks Nate.</p><p>"I wanna do this. It. Now" replies Blair pushing Nate onto the bed.</p><p>"Now ? I thought you wanted to wait"</p><p>"not anymore" she kisses him and starts to take off his clothes.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Better lock it down with Nate, B, clock's ticking.</em>
</p><hr/><p>Sitting on the couch at the party are three teenagers, the two girls checks her phone and one of them exclaims "God, you'll never believe what's on Gossip Girl"</p><p>"someone saw Serena and Fáelán getting off the train at Grand Central" says the other girl.</p><p>"good. Things were getting a little dull around here" says the guy holding up his glass on scotch.</p><hr/><p>Outside the building, getting out of the car are Fáelán and Serena, they had been talking in the car as they were being driven to their destination. Serena and Fáelán get out of the car, Serena says to the driver "thank you" as Fáelán says to the driver "thanks" The driver nods at them grabbing Fáelán's bag. They walk past the guy at the front gate, enter the building and walk up the stairs to the party that is happening, they enter the party, they see Fáelán's mother but Serena turns away. Fáelán's mother turns to them and exclaims "Fáelán" when she sees him before she hugs him, she then sees Serena, she asks "Serena Van Der Woodsen, is that you ?"</p><p>Serena turns, Fáelán's mother says to her "oh my god, you're back, it's so good to see you" she hugs Serena, she says to Fáelán and Serena "I'll be right back" and she walks away. Fáelán follows her and says "don't say anything about me being here, I want it to be a surprise"</p><p>Eleanor knocks on the door, she says through the door "Blair, it's Serena"</p><p>Fáelán hears Nate ask "Serena ?"</p><p>"Serena's at school, kiss me" Fáelán widens his eyes a bit.</p><p>"no, I just heard your mom say she's here" Nate tells Blair before he asks "don't you want to say 'hey' ?" as he gets off of the bed.</p><p>"yeah, totally" replies Blair sounding like she'd rather do the opposite. Fáelán just thinks to himself 'just wait until she sees me'</p><p>Fáelán hears the other guests gossiping, one woman says "I thought she was at boarding school"</p><p>"I heard she's pregnant" says another woman, Fáelán thinks of the irony of that comment as he thinks about why he had left.</p><p>"no, because she was in rehab" says a third woman.</p><p>"she looks good" says a man.</p><p>"oh my god, is that Fáelán ?" asks one woman.</p><p>"look at how long his hair is now" gasps another woman. Fáelán's hair is longer than Serena's hair with a few braids in it, his hair reaches half way down his back.</p><p>"he looks gorgeous" says a third woman to a man.</p><p>"agreed" says the man. Serena walks over to her mother who is saying to a woman "so I told him, 'forget it, I don't care if it's Murakami, it clashes with my sofa" the two chuckle a bit, Serena sees her mom, she gets her attention by saying "mom, mom" Lily Van Der Woodsen turns, Serena says "hey, hey, good to see you"</p><p>"oh, Serena darling" Lily says before hugging her daughter.</p><p>"um, so where is he ?" asks Serena, the question confuses Fáelán, Lily is silent and Serena asks "what ? they haven't let him out yet ?" sounding annoyed.</p><p>"no, let's not discuss that right now, I thought you might wanna see some of your friends" says Lily.</p><p>"I already saw Fáelán" Serena tells Lily who widens her eyes.</p><p>A door opens and Fáelán sees the back of Nate facing towards Serena, he walks towards her as another door opens, Blair turns to look at Nate, not really seeing Fáelán before she turns to see Serena and she says "hi, Serena, so good to see you"</p><p>"hi, how are you doing ?" asks Serena.</p><p>"come, we're about to have dinner" says Blair dragging Serena to the table. Fáelán decides that this is the time to reveal himself, he nods at his mother</p><p>"I'll set a places for you next to Blair and the one of the other side as well" says Fáelán's mother.</p><p>"why set two places for Serena, mother ?" asks Blair.</p><p>"because I'm not the only one whose back" replies Serena, she points to Fáelán, Blair turns to see who Serena is pointing at once she sees Fáelán she screams before she yells out "Fáelán, you're back" she runs and hugs him tightly, she says to Serena "come on, let's get to the table"</p><p>"yea, actually there's somewhere I have to go" Serena tells them.</p><p>"you're leaving ?" asks Blair sounding upset.</p><p>"no, you have to stay, I want to tell you more about my trip" Fáelán says to Serena.</p><p>"yeah, I just- I don't feel well, I just wanted to come by and says 'hi', I'll see you at school tomorrow" she then says to Fáelán "tell Blair about your trip, it sounds amazing"</p><p>"see you tomorrow" says Fáelán giving a wave. Blair smiles until Serena's back is turned and she walks over to Kati and Is with Fáelán following, she says "School, I guess she's back for good"</p><p>"didn't you know she's coming ?" asks Kati.</p><p>"of course I did, I just wanted it to be a surprise"</p><p>"speaking of surprises" says Fáelán, he reveals himself to the girls who both hug him to greet him before they get onto their phones. Fáelán thinks 'I've missed this, now, I wonder why Serena is back now, and why did she leave ?' which he voices once he and Blair are alone. Chuck Bass is watching them talk with a smirk on his face as he checks Fáelán out.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Word is that S bailed on B's party in under 90 seconds. And didn't even have one limoncello. Has our bad girl really gone good ? Or is it all just part of the act ? Why's she leave ? Why'd she return ? Send me all the detes. And who am I ? That's one secret I'll never tell. The only one. You know you love me. XOXO, Gossip Girl.</em>
