          <div class="userstuff"><p>This was a bad fight.<br/>Hagrid was very angry.<br/>"Stop being rude". Said Hagrid angrily<br/>"No." Said Harry Potter The Boy Who Lived pointing his nose up in a manner that was quite rude.<br/>I had never seen them so angry at each other, I looked at my friends. They looked at me. We knew this was a bad fight.<br/>Hagrid crossed his arms, "Well, I'll just do it first." He said, as if it made sense to everyone present.<br/>Hagrid ran away to his Hut and Harry Potter The Boy Who Lived walked away as well, but I don't know where.<br/>We ran after Hagrid because we are nice and care about him.<br/>We ran down the hill.<br/>It was very steep.<br/>When we got to the hut we saw a sign on the door it said 'I'm out on my perch at the moment, come back later'<br/>"Oh no" said Amy Pond from Doctor Who, "Hagrid is gone."<br/>"I saw that." I Said, looking at the sign, " I wonder where he is." I said, wondering out loud.<br/>"I know." Said a voice behind me.<br/>It was Gimli, my uncle. He was a dwarf and very grumpy (But not like the Snow White one)<br/>"What do you mean?" Said Ron, eating a sandwich.<br/>"I know where Hagrid is." Said Gimli, looking up, he is very short.<br/>"Where is he?" I said, asking a question and looking down, he is very short.<br/>"Follow meeeeeeee" Said gimli<br/>We arrived at Harry Potter The Boy Who Lived's room and it was empty.<br/>"He is not here." I Said looking at the empty room.<br/>"This is where his perch is" said Gimli looking up us.<br/>"Why would his perch be inside Harry Potter The Boy Who Lived's room?" I said inquisitively<br/>Gimli walked up to the window, "It's not inside", he said, opening the window.</p></div>
