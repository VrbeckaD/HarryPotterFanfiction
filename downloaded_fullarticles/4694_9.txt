    <p>
  <span>“Oh, goodness, this is so exciting!” Hermione squealed. “I feel like I’m eleven again. Don’t you Ron? Ron?” She asked, looking behind her to find her boyfriend was no longer there. “Oh- where’s he gone off to now?” She asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Whassit?” Ron asked, wandering over with half of a sandwich in his mouth. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s too crowded here, we’ve got to stick together if we want to find a seat,” Hermione said. She grabbed Ron’s hand and Harry’s forearm as they trudged through the crowd. The train station platform was buzzing with excitement. The normal amount of wizarding families had attended, but for whatever reason, they seemed to be mostly clumped around Harry and his friends. They were buzzing around like flies and taking unusually excessive amounts of pictures with Harry in the background. “Do you think they’ll have space for us on the train? I wonder what Hogwarts looks like now. Oh, I’m just so excited!” She squealed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry smiled and looked up at the train. He had never dreamed of going back to Hogwarts after the war. Yet, here he was. The acceptance letter had come in the mail a month ago, inviting him and all of the other previously-7th-year students back to the school for their 8th year. So they could complete their educations and all. Harry knew it would be hard, seeing all of those faces and all of the face who had been lost. No one would be the same. But he didn’t have anywhere else to go. So, home he went. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I see Dean and Seamus,” Ron said, swallowing the sandwich in one huge gulp. “Let’s go say ‘hi’.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“DON’T YOU DARE LEAVE YOUR MOTHER, RONALD!” Mrs. Weasley shouted, trailing behind them. “Oh, dear me, people are so pushy! I do wish your father had come with me to see you off, but you know him. Busy, busy, busy!” She chirped. “Where’s Ginny? Ginny!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right here, mum,” Ginny said from Harry’s side. Her small, warm hand grasped his. “Same place I was when you lost me three minutes ago.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mrs. Weasley. “I’m sorry dear, I just-” she spontaneously broke out into tears. “This is the last time I’ll be taking you kids here!” She cried. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron uncomfortably touched his mother’s shoulder. He was now so unbelievably tall and she so unbelievably short, that he nearly had to bend over to complete this action. “It’s alright, mum. Someday, you’ll be taking our kids here, won’t you?” He asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This only seemed to make her sob harder. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The train let out a high pitched, familiar whistle, signaling that it was time for them to say their final goodbyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bye, mum,” Ron said, kissing his mother’s head. “Take it easy, alright?” He asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, don’t pay too much attention to that clock,” Ginny said, referring to the clock that signalled the current whereabouts of her family.  It had never really recovered from the war and now stood as a constant reminder of the brother who would never come home again. “You know what Dad says. Don’t trust anything that can’t think for itself or whatever. We’ll write to you a bunch!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you so much for everything, Mrs. Weasley,” Hermione said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry gave her a hug. “Thank you,” he said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She shook her head. “Thank </span>
  <em>
    <span>you, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry, dear,” she said, wiping her nose on a handkerchief. “Well, I suppose I’m officially an empty nester now. See you all for Christmas.” She waved one last time as they boarded the train. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This year is going to be weird, huh?” Ginny asked as they boarded the train. “We’re going to be in the same year! We might have classes together!” She said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione pulled them into an empty compartment. “And maybe now that you two have been kicked off the Quidditch team, you’ll be able to study for them,” she said. Harry and Ron both deflated a bit. Seeing as they were eighth years, they would not be allowed to try out for Quidditch this year. It would be an unfair advantage, since Gryffindor would no doubt have the most eighth year students. Or something like that. McGonagall had explained it in her letter, but Harry had been too heartbroken to pay attention to it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t worry. I won’t mind if you fly around at practice for a bit,” Ginny, the new Gryffindor captain, said with a smirk. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The compartment door lurched open as Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood stuck their heads in. “Mind if we join you?” Neville asked, grinning. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not at all,” Harry said, sliding closer to Ginny to make room for them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello, everyone,” Luna said, as cheerily as ever. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Guys, I have some big news,” Neville said excitedly once they were situated. “Professor Sprout has invited me to be her apprentice herbology teacher this year! She said she’s been really proud of my work. I spent a few weeks this summer helping her regrow the greenhouses. They were completely destroyed, of course, but I believe they’ll be back to normal in a month or two.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione grinned. “That’s wonderful, Neville! Goodness, I haven’t got the faintest clue as to what I’m going to do when I leave Hogwarts. It all depends on who’s willing to take me, of course.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron scoffed. “You’ll be Minister of Magic before we ever graduate, Hermione,” he said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She blushed and leaned into his side. “Whatever happens, I think the worst is past us.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry supposed she was right. It was over now. He wouldn’t have to worry about Death Eaters or Voldemort or horcruxes or anything! For once, he could have a normal school year. How on Earth would he do that? He didn’t even know where to begin. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The rest of the train ride felt like every other train ride. Filled with buzzing excitement, catching up with Neville and Luna, and thinking of the year to come. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>--</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Welcome, students!” McGonagall said as they entered the Great Hall. If he hadn’t been there, Harry would not have known there had been a war. It looked the same as it had for years. Tables lined across the floor, banners hanging from the ceiling. He almost forgot the sight of the dead and wounded littering the floor and the walls crumbling. Almost. It took a moment before he noticed one extra table and one extra banner hanging from the wall. The banner was red, green, yellow, and blue with a dragon stretching over it. The table underneath was empty, and significantly smaller than the others. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s that table for?” Harry whispered to Ron, who shrugged. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They continued to file into the Great Hall and made their way to the Gryffindor table. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Would all eighth year students please seat themselves at the table beside the Slytherin table with the dragon banner overhead?” McGonagall asked in a way that made it seem more like a demand than a question.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There were murmurs of confusion as they wandered over. Harry dropped Ginny’s hand. “I’ll see you in the common room later,” he promised. She nodded and found a seat next to several girls in her year. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s this about?” Ron asked as he, Hermione, Harry, and Neville found seats at the table. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They must not have enough space for us at the other tables,” Hermione whispered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This seat taken?” Someone grumbled, gesturing the seat beside Harry. The person was tall and thin. He had let his platinum blonde hair grow out a bit, and now it was tied in a ponytail at the nape of his neck. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s heart stopped. “Malfoy,” he said, though it hadn’t come out nearly as bitter as he had expected. He was mostly surprised. Why had he chosen to return? Harry had read in the Daily Prophet that his father had been sentenced to life in Azkaban and his mother was moving to a residence in France while their manor was being renovated. Why had Draco returned instead of staying with his mother?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Potter,” Draco said. It was less of a snarl and more of an… acknowledgement. “May I sit here or not?” He asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Erm, sure, I suppose so,” Harry said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What is it? Surprised I’d show my face in this school?” Draco asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry frowned. “Your mother saved my life,” he said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You saved mine,” Draco said. He was thinking of what had happened in the room of requirement. Draco sighed. “Listen Potter. I don’t care if we’re friends this year or not, but I want you to know that I’m on your side. I’m not- I’m not my father.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This baffled Harry. “I know,” he said. “I never said you were.” Draco huffed and turned to face Blaise on the other side of the table. “Wait, Malfoy,” Harry said. Draco turned back around with a bored expression. “I- I- thank you. When we were caught by the snatchers, you didn’t tell them it was us, even though you knew. You were the reason the Elder Wand didn’t work for Voldemort. You- you kinda saved the world.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What the bloody hell are you talking about, Potter? What Elder Wand?” Draco asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry sighed. “Nothing. Just… thanks… I guess.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s frown faltered. “Whatever, Potter.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just as amiable as ever, I see,” Ron said in Harry’s ear. “If we have to eat with him all year, I might jump out of the owlery window.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Quiet, please!” McGonagall announced. The talking ceased at once. “Let the sorting begin. First years, once you are sorted, pleased join your peers at your respective tables. But first, the sorting hat’s annual poem,” she said. She picked up the old hat and held it up. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It took a deep breath and dust protruded out of the wrinkles in it’s felt. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>The war is won, </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>But the fight is not done. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Together we must grow. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>As one, we must show </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>That we are all on the same side.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Some of us have tired </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>To fight and have died, </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>But it’s for those who we have lost, </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>That we continue at all costs.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>We will continue to learn, </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>And we will continue to yearn </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>For better friends and closer peers than ever before,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” It recited. The Great Hall broke into some slightly mournful applause. They, too, remembered the sight of the death lined up in a single row down the center of the room. They remembered the makeshift hospital beds composed of fallen beams and rubble. They remembered the blood stains on the floor that had since been cleaned off. Just mere months ago, this place had been a graveyard and no one was likely to forget that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That was shorter than usual,” Hermione muttered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, it hasn’t had as much time to think about it as it usually has, right?” Ron asked. “I imagine the battle distracted it a bit from its regularly scheduled rhyming.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Let the sorting begin!” McGonagall shouted over the bustle of the students. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry chose this moment to let his mind wander. He didn’t know any of the kids being sorted this year, so it didn’t matter much to him what house they’d be in. He stared at the back of Malfoy’s head. What had he meant when he said he was on Harry’s side? There were no sides anymore. The war was over. Of course he wasn’t his father! Harry knew that. And what about the part about them being friends? Did Draco want to be friends with Harry? He hadn’t since first year, and Harry couldn’t imagine him wanting to again. Did Harry want to be friends with Draco? Draco had practically saved Harry’s life several times during the battle. Sure he had also almost killed him, but that didn’t matter now, did it? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just as the sorting was finished, Harry zoned back in. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Prefects, please guide the first years to your common rooms. Eighth years, please remain seated until further instructions,” McGonagall said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Ron asked. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Please </span>
  </em>
  <span>don’t tell me we aren’t going to the Gryffindor common room!” He whined. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco huffed and spun around. “That’s about it, Weasley. They don’t have room for us what with all of the first years. That’s why they’ve got us all over here,” he said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron frowned. “But- but the castle, Can’t it- can’t it-” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It can repair itself magically, but it can’t really grow new dormitories,” Hermione said. “Well… I suppose it could, but it can’t control where it grows them.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No! We’ve got to be in Gryffindor!” Ron said. “This is our last year!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you think the castle knows that?” Hermione asked. “It just knows it has more students than usual.” Her voice was heavily weighted with disappointment. This year was going to be different, for sure.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello, eighth years,” McGonagall said with a smile. She stood at the head of the table. Now, she looked like her old self, and less like the war general and headmistress she had been previously. “It’s so nice to see you all again. It really is. I have to admit, I was a bit surprised by the amount of you who expressed wanting to come back after… last year. I know many of you went through a lot. You watched your friends and families die, some of you were forced to torture and kill them yourselves. But I want you to know that won’t happen again. You all fought incredibly hard for this school, and now, the school is repaying you. I want you to know that if you ever need </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything, </span>
  </em>
  <span>just knock on my office door. I have decided to step down from Gryffindor Head of House so that I may be yours,” she said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait, professor!” Seamus shouted. “Does that mean all of us… are going to be one house?” He asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall bowed her head. “That is correct, Mr. Finnegan. The eighth years are our fifth Hogwarts house. You will be the first in an experiment on house unity. I never agreed with the house system, and now, you students will be testing my theory. This year, you all will be eating together, sleeping together, sharing a common room, and attending classes together.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The students all began to mingle angrily. No one seemed very happy with this idea in the least bit. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Shush, now!” McGonagall shouted. “This is exactly why we are doing it! You’ve grown to dislike students from  other houses, and why? Just because one student has been labeled brave and another smart, that doesn’t mean you can’t be compatible friends! I believe every single one of you is smart. You’re all brave, you’re all kind, and you’re all cunning. You all represent each of the four houses in your own unique way. And the only way for you all to learn who you really are and what it really means to be a Hogwarts student is for you to mix amongst yourself.” She paused. Now, the students were silent. “Now, because I will also be Headmistress as well as your Head of House, I will not be able to supervise you as closely as you have been in the past. You’re all of age now, so I can’t force you to do much. But, while you’re students here, you still have to obey the rules of the school. That said, some of the rules have been altered to better suit your newfound responsibility.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This idea everyone seemed to like. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Curfew will be pushed back to midnight, but if I see anyone, and I mean </span>
  <em>
    <span>anyone,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Harry could’ve sworn she was glaring at him, “out of bed past then, they will face severe consequences. You do not need permission slips to enter Hogsmeade and you may go when you please as long as it’s before curfew and there are no classes, but you must sign in and out using the sheet on the billboard in your common room. There will be no alcohol on school grounds. If I catch anyone with alcohol, they’ll face immediate expulsion. I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>exaggerating,” she said seriously. “If I find that you are unable to handle all of this, I’m not afraid to take it away.” There was a heavy silence. “Now, if you’ll follow me to your common room.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry, Ron, and Hermione all stood and began to follow. “Did you hear that? Harry, you won’t have to sneak into Hogsmeade anymore! And we’ll be able to go whenever we want!” Ron said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’ll hardly have time,” Hermione said. “It’s never too early to start studying for N.E.W.Ts.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right, those,” Ron said, his face dropping a little bit. “How do I know what to study for if I haven’t decided what I want to do yet?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall lead them around the school to the tower where the owlery was. Now, instead of two floors of emptiness, there seemed to be a multi-tiered dormitory. “The password is Dumbledore’s Goat, don’t forget it! Your common room is on the first floor, the girls dormitory is on the second floor, the boys are on the third floor, and the owlery is the fourth. Room assignments are posted on the bulletin board,” she announced. “Now, don’t stay up too late. I’ll see you all for transfiguration first block.” With that, she wandered down the hallway. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They all stood there for a moment. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, are we going to go in or what?” Pansy Parkinson sneered. Harry was not thrilled that she had decided to come back this year. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Seamus sighed and looked up at the portrait of some prince or another glaring down at him. “Dumbledore’s Goat,” he said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The portrait chuckled. “Indeed!” He said before swinging open. Slowly, the students began to file into the common room. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s first impression was that it was very different. Well, not quite. One corner was very familiar. There was a warm fireplace with two large armchairs and a couch around it. The wall was a hearty red and the head of a roaring lion hung above the fireplace. Another corner Harry vaguely recognized as the Slytherin corner. It was a lot darker with grey stone walls and a great stained glass snake. The corner behind the Slytherin one was the Hufflepuff corner, Harry assumed. There was another bright fireplace. In front of it, there was what looked like an arts-and-crafts table and a lot of bean-bag chairs. The walls were composed of several large windows, and a life-sized badger statue stood in the center of it. The corner beside it was the Ravenclaw corner. Harry couldn’t tell the color of the wall because it was covered by bookshelves aside from one long window down the center. Instead of chairs or couches, there were tables with headlamps over them for perfect studying. A great eagle hung down from the chandelier.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And then, there was the center of the room. Several armchairs and couches were arranged in a circle around a statue of a dragon that was about as tall as Harry’s hip. Behind it were two stair cases leading up to the dorms. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron was the first to speak. “Well this is… new,” he said. “You guys got beanbag chairs?” He asked Hannah Abbott. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And a craft table!” She said merrily. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Eugh, all of this natural lighting is hurting my eyes,” Blaise Zabini said, squinting at the windows. “Let’s check out the rooming assignments.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They all swarmed around the small bulletin board. Harry scanned the sheets for his name, but he was high-fived before he could. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re together!” Ron said. He was tall enough that he could peak over the heads of everyone else. “And we’re with… Zabini and Malfoy,” he snarled. “Stupid house unity. Looks like Hermione’s got Padma, Parvati, and… Pansy Parkinson. That’s rough. Padma and Parvati are nice, though.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy?” Harry asked. “Seriously?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah. But at least we’re together, right?” He asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded. Rooming with Malfoy? That was a whole new level of weird. “Let’s go up and claim beds before they do,” he said eagerly, </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right,” Ron said. “Let me just say goodnight to Hermione. Go on, I’ll be right up,” he said, flushing a bit. Harry knew it was awkward for Ron and Hermione, but he found their relationship funny and entertaining. They did something sweet and romantic, and then they would realize Harry was giggling at them. Every time Harry caught them, they would both flush intensely. Ron would try to play it off and Hermione would try to hide in whatever she had in her hands. Harry, quite frankly, was pretty happy for them. Besides, they had walked in on him and Ginny too many times to count. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He made his way over to the staircase on the right and began to climb. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bloody ridiculous,” Seamus said, running up the stairs so he could walk next to Harry. “Why have we got to be on the third floor? Why can’t the girls?” He asked. “I bet our dorms are going to smell like owl shit.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry laughed. “Who are you rooming with?” He asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dean and some blokes from Hufflepuff. This whole house unity thing is stupid, I bet they put us back in our respective houses before Christmas break,” Seamus snarled. “Dean thinks it will be fun, though. He thinks we’ll have some pretty great parties.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Harry said. “Hey, is Dean okay? He was on the run for most of last year, wasn’t he?” He asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Seamus shrugged. “He’s pretty good. He came by my place Easter break and my mum stuffed him like a turkey. He had to leave pretty quick though. I’ve talked to him about it a couple times and he seems fine. He found out his Dad had been killed by death eaters, though, and he lost a half-sister. He never really knew his father, but losing his sister kinda took a toll on him.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh,” Harry said softly. “I- I had no idea.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, well, I reckon we all lost someone,” Seamus said as they made it to the third floor. “This is mine. See ya, Harry,” he said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bye, Seamus,” Harry said as he disappeared into a room. Harry wandered down the hallway until he located his own bedroom. He pushed the door open to see four four-poster beds lined up against the wall. Two of them were shrouded in red curtains with red sheets and the other two were green. Harry located his trunk at the foot of the bed in between the other red one and a green one. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Potter,” Draco said as he walked into the room. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy,” Harry said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco frowned. “I believe you have something of mine that I would like back.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded and opened his trunk. “Your wand. I’ve got it right here,” he said. He had carefully placed it at the top of his trunk so it wouldn’t break. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thanks,” Draco said. He ran his fingers down it. “I’ve been using one I took from some Death Eater. Doesn’t really work the same,” he said. He looked up and his grey eyes met Harry’s green ones. “Thanks. For my wand. And for saving my life twice,” he said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry shrugged. “You saved mine a few times, so I think we’re settled. I hope… I hope we can be… I don’t want to hate you anymore, Malfoy.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The door opened, making both boys jump about three feet back. Harry leaned on his bed and Draco started looking for his trunk, as if nothing had happened. And nothing had. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Were all of those stairs really necessary?” Ron asked, panting as he came in. He wandered over to the other red bed, where his little owl sat in a cage on his trunk. “Hey there, Pig.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If I find any bird poop on my clothes, you’re done for, Weasley,” Malfoy sneered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was going to be a weird year indeed. </span>
</p>
