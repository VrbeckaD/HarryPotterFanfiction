          <div class="userstuff"><p>The town hall was alive, the music was flowing and bodies were swinging. The swing that the local parish attached to the ceiling was really working overtime, totally worth the Â£30 investment. All in all everything was going well.</p><p>Suddenly the doors opened, and a newcomer joined the festivities. It took them a few tries but eventually their wheels made it over the threshold. They wheeled onto the dance floor, ignoring the looks from the locals. Sure they were different, but they could dance just as well as any of them. Their judgement be damned, they were gonna dance their wheels off.</p><p>As they reached the center of the dance floor the music changed, and with this change so did the energy in the room. No one could resist the allure of the music, it was impossible. The opening notes of 'YMCA' pounded through the speakers, the locals lined and squared up, ready to dance their socks off. All to soon they were at the chorus, arms at the ready. The newcomer was also ready, however very quickly they realised it was impossible, they couldn't do it, a dalek cannot make an 'M' only and 'X'.</p><p>They dalek persisted though, not deterred, an 'X' instead of an 'M' would have to suffice. The rowdy crowd of locals sang along with to the song as did the dalek, using their changed version.<br/>
"YXCA" screamed the dalek. suddenly the dalek stilled and stopped, ignoring those still moving and singing around it. It started to mutter to itself, but gradually became more boisterious and loud.</p><p>"YXCA...YXCA..Y..X..C..A...xca...xca...XCA....EXTERMINATE!" The dalek screamed, spinning in circles as fast as its wheels allowed. It then stopped and killed everyone. Once done the dalek wheeled outta there, its wheels getting caught on the threshold again, into the night.</p><p>The end.</p></div>
