    <p>Harry decided not to go to dinner, wanting to be alone for a little while. His head was aching and he didn’t think he could cope with the noise of the Great Hall. He walked vaguely towards the Common Room, though wasn’t really intending to end up anywhere. He enjoyed the empty corridors, no grating voices or laughter or footsteps other than his own… Wait, not only his own. Another set, ahead of him. He sighed, irritated and hoping it wasn’t Filch. He’d been feeling so angry lately, frustrated and tense, all he wanted was 5 fucking minutes to himself.</p><p>Then none other than Draco Malfoy stepped around the corner just ahead, not 10 feet away. Instantly, a wave of hatred washed over Harry, making his skin hot and jaw tight, stopping in his tracks. He would have shouted at Draco, just for someone to take his rage out on, and who better, but Malfoy spotted him first. He turned to face Harry, smirking.</p><p>“Well, Potter, wandering the corridors during dinner? Tired of all your adoring public?” he sneered, his prefect badge shining on his black robes</p><p>“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” Harry demanded.</p><p>“My duty, Potter. Honestly, you really are stupid.” He said. His insults were barely there, but Harry was too angry to care, incensed just by Malfoy’s arrogant smirk and nonchalant stance.</p><p>“Right, Malfoy.” Harry growled, advancing on him. Malfoy looked shocked for a split second, then turned his head, searching for Crabbe or Goyle but, remembering he was alone, returned his wide grey eyes to Harry. The Potter grabbed the front of his robes and shoved his back into the stone wall, hard, making him gasp as the air was knocked from his lungs. He looked at Harry in confusion, seeing the rage in his green eyes.</p><p>“Potter-” Harry punched him in the stomach, cutting him off before he could insult him yet again. He grabbed Draco’s wand from the folds of his robes, shoving it into his own pocket so he couldn’t attack back.</p><p>“Shut up. I’m so fucking sick of you.” Harry growled. Still holding Draco against the wall, he looked around. The corridor was empty, everyone was at dinner in the Great Hall, but someone might be around. He thought for a moment, and remembered the boys’ bathroom around the corner. He didn’t know why but he wanted to be completely alone with Malfoy…</p><p>He looked at Draco, who looked a little dazed, and pulled him by his robes away from the wall and marched him down the corridor. A moment later, regaining his senses, Draco struggled against his grip.</p><p>“Let me go, Potter!” he shouted, kicking him. His foot found Harry’s kneecap, making him cry out and stumble. Draco wriggled from his distracted grip, and started darting away, but Harry had his wand in his hand before he got four paces away, his blood on fire with sudden coursing rage.</p><p>“Crucio.” He hissed, an impulse he’d never felt before taking over, the unknown wrath consuming him. Draco screamed, staggering another few steps before collapsing, curling in on himself on the stone floor, convulsing horribly. Harry stopped the spell as soon as he realised what he’d done, his own heart pounding and his stomach churning as Draco twitched and sobbed on the floor. How could he have done that?! Harry thought, disgusted with himself.</p><p>He put his wand away, and approached the Malfoy boy, who was trying to get up, away. He was panting harshly, his body trembling too badly for his arms and legs to support him. He collapsed again, making a small whimpering sound as Harry got closer. Harry stood over him for a moment, before kneeling beside him. He pushed Draco onto his back, pinning his wrists to the floor. Draco’s face was paler than usual, the blood completely drained away, and he looked terrified. There were tears in his eyes, weakly trying to get his arms out of Harry’s grip. Harry remembered when Bellatrix Lestrange had used the Cruciatus curse on him, how he’d felt like all his strength was gone, how helpless he’d felt, and the agony.</p><p>“L-let go of me…! You…you just...-?” Draco panted, his voice shaky and small. Harry stared at him, his own hands shaking, and blood rushing loudly in his ears. He felt something strange stirring in his chest though, a horrifying pleasure he’d never felt before.</p><p>“I…I’m sorry..! Oh my God- I never meant to…I didn’t mean to-” he stopped, hearing faint but approaching footsteps. He didn’t want anyone to know he’d hurt Malfoy this badly, it was practically unprovoked, and the punishment definitely didn’t fit the crime.</p><p>He grabbed Malfoy, picking him up. He was lighter than he’d expected, but his constant, albeit weak, struggles against Harry made him difficult to manoeuvre. He half carried, half dragged Draco to the boys’ bathroom, which was, thankfully, empty. He closed the door, then took Draco into a cubicle and locked it, sitting down on the toilet seat with Draco practically on his lap, his hand over Draco’s mouth. He listened intently, worried whoever it was would come into the toilets. They stayed there, both panting, Harry waiting. After enough time had passed and he was sure they were gone, he stood up and shoved Draco into the wall again.</p><p>What little colour he usually had was back in his pale face, and his eyes were clearing of the cloudiness caused by such extreme pain. He looked back at Harry, clearly exhausted and afraid. He’d never suspected Potter capable of such anger, now he was scared. Harry felt a pang in his chest. He liked that. The fear in Draco’s eyes as he watched him, like a trapped animal watches its hunter, waiting for a strike, helpless. He didn’t have his wand, and Harry outweighed him easily now, though Draco was slightly taller. He’d never noticed how skinny Malfoy was, scrawny and weak.</p><p>He felt another wave of rage, looking at how pathetic Draco was, but he also felt something else. His trousers were suddenly tight, and he was staring at the vulnerable, soft skin of Draco’s neck, thinking how delicious it looked. He dragged his eyes back up to the pale face, and found Draco was staring at him too, with a mixture of fear and utter confusion.</p><p>“P-Potter..-” Harry slammed him into the wall again, his anger spiking at his voice.</p><p>“I told you to shut up!” Harry bellowed, making Draco flinch. Harry pulled out his wand and whipped it in a circle above them. “Muffliato.” He hissed, and all other noise around them stopped – the dripping of the taps, the creaking of the old pipes. It was silent except their own breathing, their own hearts beating fast and loud in their own ears, and no one else could hear them. Draco looked profoundly terrified now, and he tried wriggling again but Harry put the tip of his wand to his throat and he froze. “Don’t even think about it. You know you can’t escape.” He hissed.</p><p>Draco stared at him, horror struck, then around like he wa trying to find an escape route. Slowly, he realised he was trapped, and seemed to shrink, his eyes going down as he pressed himself into the wall, even slumping slightly, defeated. It felt like a monster, something evil, stirring in his chest, waking up.</p><p>He noticed the pale skin of the other boy’s neck again, and pressed his lips against it. It was soft and cold, trembling. The thing inside Harry roared in pleasure, begging him for more, its hunger growing. He felt Draco go tense again, and he opened his mouth against his throat, licking it, tasting it. He brushed his teeth against it, then nibbled, then bit, hard.</p><p>Draco let out a strangled yelp, summoning enough strength to push Harry away. Harry, not expecting this, flew back into the other wall, tripping over his own robes. He looked up at Draco, who had one hand on his already bruising neck, and one hand reaching for the cubicle’s lock. Harry quickly pointed his wand at the door and said “Colloportus,” Draco’s hand snapping away from it skittishly.</p><p>Then Harry stood up, breathing hard, and slapped Draco hard across the face with the back of his hand. Draco fell into the newly locked door and didn’t have time to stand up properly before Harry was on him again, spinning him round and pressing his face into the cold metal wall. “How fucking dare you.” Harry snarled into his ear, feeling him tense with fear.</p><p>“H-Harry…please, let me go…” he begged softly, his voice shaking. He’d never heard Draco say his first name on its own before, only his full or last name in that sneering, mocking voice he was so fond of.</p><p>“Be quiet, you bitch.” He snarled, feeling another overwhelming wave of rage. He grabbed a handful of Draco’s soft white-blond hair and pulled his head back, pushing his other hand against his mouth. His could feel the heat of Draco’s mouth against his fingers, and his monster wanted to feel it more.</p><p>Tightening his other hand on his hair, Harry slowly parted Draco’s lips with his thumb, then his teeth, and his fingers were feeling his hot, wet tongue, the cushiony flesh of his cheeks and the hardness of his teeth. Draco made a startled, questioning sound, trying to turn his head to get the fingers out but Harry only pushed them deeper – not far enough to make him gag but enough for him to moan in discomfort, helplessly using his tongue in an effort to push them away, or block them from going further, too afraid of pain to bite down.</p><p>Harry liked the feeling. His trousers felt tight again, and his Monster had an idea. He pulled the fingers out Draco’s mouth, wiping his saliva on Draco’s robes, which he then pulled off him in one fluid motion, before turning him around again forcefully. Draco looked at him, hatred and fear in his eyes, his lips moist and pink.</p><p>“What do you want from me?” he asked, an air of his usual arrogance in his voice as he glared at Harry, apparently he’d had enough of this humiliation. Harry grinned, or at least his Monster did.</p><p>“Get down on your knees.” It ordered in Harry’s voice. It looked at Draco in satisfaction. He looked dishevelled and exhausted, his shirt and hair askew and his eyes tearful despite his best efforts. Draco seemed to understand what Harry’s Monster wanted from him, and pressed himself into the cubicle wall, shaking his head.</p><p>“No…never. Potter, you let me out of here right no-”</p><p>“Silencio.” Harry said with the flick of his wand. Draco kept saying the words, his lips moving but no sound coming out. He looked horrified, then tried again, his lips forming words, but he still couldn’t make a sound. Then Harry’s Monster grabbed the front of his robes and pulled him close, Harry’s own mouth whispering “Get on your knees.” In a harsh tone that made Draco seem to shrink and he obeyed, looking exceptionally beaten. The grey eyes stayed on the floor, his head down and to the side as if he were attempting to ignore his captor.</p><p>The Monster found the buckle on Harry’s belt, and began to undo it. As soon as he heard the clink of metal and rustle of fabric, Draco looked up, and was horrified to see Harry Potter’s erect cock standing proudly from his school trousers in front of his face. The Monster grabbed the blond’s hair again and tugged it hard until he moved forward and up, positioning him perfectly for what it wanted.</p><p>Draco was crying silently, his pale eyes looking anywhere but at what was in front of him, like if he ignored it, it would go away.</p><p>“Go on then.” Harry’s voice said cruelly, gripping the white hair tightly, but Draco ignored him besides a small wince. “Don’t make me Imperious you.” Harry warned. “I’ll have you begging Snape to fuck you in the middle of Potions.” Draco looked up at him, steely eyes wide with rage and fear. He knew he’d do it, the Monster he saw as Harry had already used the Cruciatus curse on him. His eyes stared up at him angrily, then darted to his wand, and he took a deep breath.</p><p>Harry and his Monster watched together as Draco Malfoy shifted closer on his knees, white hair ruffled and tears rolling from his storming eyes, and slowly reached up to take Harry’s cock in his hand. Harry’s head felt clouded, like he was sleeping walking. He had a vague sense that he couldn’t control his own body, his own thoughts, like he was dreaming. But he felt Draco touch him.</p><p>Harry let out a soft hiss at the contact, Draco’s hand was cold against his hot, hard cock. Draco stared at it in fear.</p><p>Virgin. The Monster hissed excitedly, and Harry felt himself nodding as he slid his fingers through the blond hair and tightening them around it, tugging him closer. Draco winced and obeyed, shuffling closer still across the damp bathroom floor.</p><p>“Open your mouth.” Harry’s voice said. He didn’t even recognise his own words anymore, they were the Monster’s now. Draco looked at him again, eyes wide and begging silently. Harry’s hand gave another tug on his hair, and Draco looked down again, biting his lip.</p><p>The Malfoy boy knelt up slowly, one hand hesitantly gripping the base of Harry’s erection while the other moved to rest on Harry’s bare thigh, his trousers having fallen down past his knees. He gave the erection a hesitant stroke, then another, before finally opening his mouth slowly. Harry grinned, tugging his hair more so his head would jerk forward, the Monster wanting to feel the warm lips.</p><p>Draco’s mouth made contact the head, a bead of precum sticking to his bottom lip when he instinctively moved away from it. Another harsh tug of hair stopped him, bringing him right back and forcing him to take more of the salty flesh into his mouth. Harry moaned along with his Monster, being a virgin himself, he’d never felt the heat of someone else on his cock. It felt good. He didn’t need the Monster to encourage Draco to use his tongue, knowing that would feel better. The grey eyes flicked up to his face, then back down, and he obeyed.</p><p>Harry watched him move away, and a small, shiny pink tongue slip out. Hesitantly, with fresh tears rolling down his cheeks, Draco licked his tongue over Harry’s slit. He tried to jerk away, disgusted, but the Monster held him still and close, pulling him closer.</p><p>“Put it in your mouth.” The Monster snarled, and Draco’s eyes closed as he obeyed, his thin pale eyebrows trembling in a frown as he let the hot stiffness into his mouth. Harry’s hips moved forward, the Monster holding Draco’s head still. Draco’s eyes widened in alarm, trying to push himself away from the intrusion. “Suck.” Harry stared down at him, watching him begin to suck, his eyes squeezed shut. Harry let out a shuddering moan as he felt the hot wetness around his cock, velvety tongue tentatively making contact with the underside. Draco let out a small, voiceless sob when the Monster pushed Harry further into his mouth, his hand opened and desperately trying to remove the hot, thick organ before it went down his throat.</p><p>The Monster purred at the distress in Malfoy’s face. It made Harry rock his hips, hand gripping the soft blond hair tighter so he couldn’t escape as the cock slid, in and out, between his lips. It was a wonderful sight, but not enough for Harry, or his Monster. The heat and wetness around him had sparked a need he’d only ever sated himself. Now he needed much, much more, and he knew his Monster did as well.</p><p>He pushed in all the way, his wand releasing the Silence Spell on Draco without Harry’s knowledge. Draco let out a muffled scream as the cock went down his throat, cutting off his air and making him choke, sending exquisite vibrations along the cock in his mouth. His fingernails dug into Harry’s thighs, struggling against the grip on his hair in vain. Harry moaned, staying there for a good few moments before pulling out completely. He released Draco’s hair and he collapsed, gasping for air and coughing desperately.</p><p>Harry chuckled the Monster’s chuckle, another heated wave of rage and lust filling him, his cock bobbing excitedly at Draco’s sobs. He grabbed the scruff of Draco’s neck, dragging him up and slamming him back into the cubicle wall, the metal rattling around them with the force. Harry ripped open Draco’s white shirt, revealing his chest, just as white, very slender and toned from Quidditch, with pale little nipples. Harry’s hand moved over his chest, feeling the ribs, slow but not tender. Still panting and coughing, Draco looked at him with utter terror in his eyes.</p><p>“Harry…please…” he whispered, his voice hoarse from the spell and intrusion, his pale face tear-stained and pink with emotion.</p><p>Harry watched himself smack Draco hard across the face, then turn him around and shove his face into the wall with one hand. Reaching around Malfoy’s narrow waist with his other, he found the boy’s belt buckle and undid it slowly. He felt Draco gasp and try to struggle, pushing away from the wall.</p><p>“Stop trying to fight me.” The Monster hissed, Harry’s voice high and chilling even to his own ears. Draco stopped at once, his whole body freezing, rigid with fear. Harry’s hand unbuckled Draco’s belt and undid his trousers, pushing them down along with his pants. The blond boy choked back a sob when he felt his shirt pushed up his back and the hot hardness press itself between his cheeks, his shoulders so tense they were shaking.</p><p>“Harry...don’t…-” he tried to beg again but the Monster grabbed his neck from behind, Harry’s fingers bruising the slender throat. “Please…!” Draco begged, but the Monster just laughed in Harry’s head. It moved Harry’s cock down to nestle between Draco’s thin thighs, rocking his hips again slowly, building up the sensation for himself. He could feel the heaviness of Draco’s balls as he pressed up against them, the warmth they held feeling wonderful.</p><p>“Lubrico.” The Monster hissed, pressing the tip of Harry’s wand into Draco’s tiny pale pink hole. Draco gasped as cold liquid spurted inside him, a completely foreign sensation, letting out a tiny whimper as the wand pushed further inside him. The hand around the back of his neck let go, and returned on his arse cheek, spreading it away for a better look at his hole. Then Harry dropped the wand into his pocket, and the Monster plunged two of his fingers inside the virgin hole instead, all the way to the last knuckle, and revelling in the muffled sob Draco let out as he bit down on his own arm. “No need to keep your voice in…” the Monster whispered, toying with Draco’s insides with Harry’s hand.</p><p>Harry watched them moving slickly in and out of Draco’s hole, marvelling distantly at the tightness and heat. It didn’t seem real, it was like a dream…a nightmare… It reminded him vaguely of Nagini attacking Mr Weasley…how Harry had felt her rage, watched the strikes through her eyes, but he was distanced from it all… He tried to stop his hand moving, concentrating with all his might, but nothing happened, like he was completely paralysed, fighting against a barrier he couldn’t see, only feeling it’s strong, cruel presence. Yet someone was using his body, moving his fingers, his hand, without his permission.</p><p>“No one knows we’re here, not even if they were pissing right next door…” the Monster said, disturbing the settling fog on Harry’s mind, watching his own hand patting the cubicle wall beside Draco’s head. “No one can hear you.”</p><p>Draco let out a sob at that, louder than before, true anguish in his voice. The Monster drank it in like water, eager for more, like it was dying of thirst. Harry was just beginning to enjoy fingering Malfoy, feeling like he was watching porn rather than participating, when the Monster decided to pull the fingers out. Draco’s legs were trembling, his fingers splayed out on the wall to keep himself upright. His shirt had fallen off one bony shoulder and his hair was a mess, looking deliciously interfered with.</p><p>The Monster wrapped Harry’s hands around the pointy hips and pulled them up to the right height for Harry, the blond’s long legs would have made it easier were they not so weak. Keeping him steady with one hand, the Monster gripped Harry’s cock rather too tightly and nudged it into Draco’s moistened hole.</p><p>Harry watched as the head of his own erect cock pressed into Malfoy’s arse, slowly disappearing. It was instantly too tight, Malfoy letting out another, louder moan of pain as his unwilling body was forcefully penetrated. Harry let out a shuddering gasp as he was enveloped in the impossibly tight, impossibly hot passage. The Monster felt his pleasure as well, gripping Draco’s hips in a bruising vice, and slammed Harry completely inside his protesting body.</p><p>This time, Draco screamed. His fingers scrabbled fruitlessly against the smooth cubicle wall, crying out for Harry to stop, begging him. The Monster thrashed gleefully inside Harry as he pulled out, revealing his slightly bloodied cock. Harry watched what he could see of Draco’s bony back shiver and tense as his insides were ripped apart, his head bowed low as he sobbed, the Monster beginning to fuck him with a strength Harry, himself, did not have. Draco collapsed at some point, unable to hold himself up on quaking legs. Harry watched him as he fell against the wall, but the Monster simply held him up as it continued the use Harry’s body to rape Draco Malfoy. Harry vaguely registered how utterly disgusted he was with himself, how much he hated what he was doing to Draco. The Malfoy looked so fragile like this, so thin and in pain… But he couldn’t stop. The Monster had full control now.</p><p>He barely felt himself climax, a slight clouding of his vision and sense of physical relief as the Monster pressed him balls deep inside Draco, pumping him full of Harry’s seed, laughing in Harry’s head. Harry watched himself slip wetly out of Draco, letting go of him. The blond fell to the bathroom floor, thick pink-tinted liquid oozing from his ravaged hole, letting out shuddering breaths. The Monster gave one last satisfied look down at what it had accomplished and went back to sleep, leaving Harry staring down at Draco, utter horror gripping his heart.</p><p>“Dr…Draco…?” Harry gasped, watching the blood and come pooling horrifically on the ground beneath him. Draco’s hands were still against the wall, his head down, his knees having buckled and brought him to an almost prayer-like position.</p><p>“Get away from me.” Draco hissed after a moment of deafening silence between them. Harry didn’t move, unable to understand what he was saying, what had happened. He had watched it all, watched himself do this through a frosted window, but yet he had no idea how. Harry reached out a shaking hand to touch Draco’s shoulder, but as soon as their skin touched, Draco flinched like he’d been burned and turned to look at him with the most hateful expression Harry had ever seen.</p><p>The look bore so much loathing and pain that Harry stumbled backwards. Tears were rolling down Draco’s cheeks, and there was blood on his lips where he’d bitten into his own flesh. “GET OUT!” he shouted, his voice thick with hatred and pain, his breath coming out in shuddering pants, like he’d half forgotten how the breathe. Harry rushed to release all of his spells, unlocking the door and returning sound to the world. The sound of people walking past on their way to their dorms, people laughing and talking to their friends.</p><p>Harry heard Draco let out an awful sob, his whole body shaking so violently it looked like he was having a fit, slowly pulling his rumpled shirt to cover himself. Harry wanted to cry.</p><p>“Draco…I’m sorry..! I’m so, so sorry! It w-wasn’t me… S-something was in my head, made me do those things…” his voice shaking with grief. “Please…l-let me help you… I’ll take you to the Hospital W-”</p><p>“Are you going to explain what you did?” Draco spat at him, his grey eyes cold as steel. “Explain that you did this to me…?” his voice cracked, turning away slowly. He took a deep breath and attempted to stand up, leaning fully into the cubicle door as he hauled his broken body upright. Harry watched with renewed horror at just how badly he’d hurt Malfoy: the thin trembling legs, the dark bruises shaped like Harry’s own hands on his jutting hips and slender throat and around his eye, the agony on Draco’s face as he tried to swallow it down with a tightened jaw and clenched fists. Ignoring Harry’s lingering presence, he tried to push himself off the wall, as if assessing his own strength, and almost immediately buckled. Harry leapt to catch him, but the flinch and look of terror in Malfoy’s face that his touch elicited was enough to make him want to never touch Malfoy again.</p><p>“Malfoy, I-”</p><p>“Give me my fucking wand.” he said, his voice low and deadly. He was leaning against the wall again, looking like he might slide back down to the floor. Harry did so immediately, handing over Draco’s wand, which he snatched in a shaking hand. “Never…come near me again…” he said, his face half hidden as he rested his head against the wall, tears dripping onto floor. Harry, defeated and ashamed, just nodded, and left the bathroom, Draco’s sobs following him all the way upstairs even after the door closed, ringing in his ears like a tolling bell.</p>
