  <b>Hey I'm Asta (Not real name) I joined the Harry Potter fandom this summer(2018) and I love it. I decided to start writing this book because I wanted to try something new. I'm a starting writer so I'm not really good at it. I would like feedback on anything I can do better. </b>
</p><p>
  <b>I will do request if I get any that is. I will do marauders Era, Hogwarts mystery, lightnig era, fantastic beast era. I'm not comfortable with the next gen just yet, as I have no idea how to write them yet.<br/></b>
</p><p>
  <b>Please send request, I don't have much inspiration at the moment.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>If you have a request please comment in the request chapter so I can have a clear view of all the requests. Or you can message me personally.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>I'll do fluff, smut, angst</b>
