    <p>-1-</p><p>-- Hermione --- </p><p>Her hair was plastered to her neck as the rain dripped down the back of her shirt. Hermione was just arriving at Hogwarts for her eighth and last year. Well technically last year should have been her last but the events of the war through off the whole learning thing so her class was forced to return. </p><p>The weather could have been better considering that it was storming. And every few seconds lightning would fork through the sky followed by the loud clap of thunder, shaking the ground. But all and all it was good to see the castle had been fixed up and was back to it regular glory. </p><p>"PLEASE SINGLE FILE INTO THE CASTLE!" boomed Hagrid giving the first years quite a fright. </p><p>Harry and Ron linked there arms through hers on eather side. 

So much for single file.</p><p>The Great Hall was decorated for the welcome back feast. The roof was a projection of what was happening outside. It reminded Hermione to much of the time that Harry had been struck by lightning while flying.</p><p>When lighting forked through the roof above them Ron ducked causing Harry and her to fall into a fit of laughter. </p><p>"What? It looks so real" Ron said trying to hide his embarrassment.<br/>
"You know you are the only one that I know that would hide from a roof" Harry said with a laugh.<br/>
"Hardy Har Har! If it looked like lightning was going to hit you you can't say you wouldn't duck" he said ticked off at him.</p><p>"Students!" Professor Mcgonagall called from the head of the staff table. She had become the new headmaster after what happened to Dumbledore.</p><p>"Now that our new students have been sorted I will announce the prefects for this year" She announced.</p><p>"From from Ravenclaw Luna Lovegood" There was cheers from the Ravenclaw table beside us.</p><p>"From Hufflepuff Jacob Heart" cheers erupted from the Hufflepuff table. ( I can't think of any one from some of the houses)</p><p>"From Gryffindor Hermione Granger" The table cheered and Harry and Ron embraced her in a group hug. </p><p>Once our table had quieted down she called "From Slytherin Draco Malfoy" the Slytherin table hollered and cheered "almost" as loud as us Gryffindors.</p><p>After alot of congrats from other Gryffindors they finished eating before heading to the Gryffindor dorms. </p><p>--- Draco ---</p><p>I was just as surprised as the other Slytherins when my name was called for prefect but I had learned long ago not to show emotion and not to question Mcgonagall so I kept my face blank. I was even more shocked by the amount of cheering that broke out because so far since I arrived at Hogwarts people have been less than friendly towards me and I dont blame them because of what happened last year. And trust me I wouldn't be here if my graduation wasn't on the line. </p><p>"Congrats man!" Blaise called over the cheers and applause. While the Gryffindors were probably going back to there dorms to read and sleep we Slytherins were heading back to party till the early hours of morning.</p><p>Man I would have a head ache tomorrow!</p>
