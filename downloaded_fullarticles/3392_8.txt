    <p>Christen's POV</p><p>"Bloody hell, Professor, please don't make me work with her," I scoffed annoyed. Professor Snape glared at me sternly.</p><p>"Five points from Gryffindor for the language and another five for refusing to work with your assigned partner. Now get to work!" He said as he stormed off. I huffed before turning to my new partner for the assignment. </p><p>Snape caught Alex and I fooling around when we were supposed to be working on our project and split us up. Alex was now paired with some Slytherin named Heath. </p><p>I looked over at my best friend. She looked exactly like I was feeling. Her face was scrunched up in annoyance while the brunette next to her smirked while saying something. Alex crossed her arms over her chest before turning and saying something quickly to the Heath girl. Heath only continued to smirk and reached out to tug on a loose piece of Alex's hair. Alex swatted her hand away. </p><p>"Well well well, look who my new partner is. Now I know I'll be getting a good grade," a voice drawled from behind me. </p><p>I stiffened before taking a deep breath and turning around. </p><p>There was only one way to describe Y/N Y/L/N. A bitch. She's the school's, and especially Slytherin's, queen bee and walks around like she owns the place because she's head girl. All the Professors love her, and most of the student body loves her for fear of being humiliated. </p><p>She once made a Hufflepuff cry for accidentally knocking over her bag after Transfiguration class. </p><p>"Y/L/N. Looks like I have to deal with your fatass for a while," I said as I looked over the girl.</p><p>"Looking at my ass are you now? I know it's a sight for sore eyes, but I didn't know you swung that way," she laughed out. I blushed crimson and angrily glared at her.</p><p>She might be a bitch, but it was no lie that the girl was gorgeous. With her shoulder-length Y/H/C and piercing grey eyes, she was a looker. Not to mention she probably had a fantastic body with all the Quidditch she plays.</p><p>"Fuck off Y/L/N. Let's just get this over with so I can get away from you."</p><p>"Fiesty. I like it. The class is almost over. Why don't you come by the head dorms after dinner tonight and we can work on it?"</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>"Wow, I was expecting more of a fight Pressy. You must be so excited to be invited to my room. Got something to tell me?" she smirked. I blushed again and was about to yell at her again, but Snape's voice calling the end of class stopped me. </p><p>She smirked and grabbed her things. </p><p>"See you tonight hot stuff." She winked before making her way over to Heath and walking out. </p><p>Alex stormed over to me. </p><p>"She's insufferable. She wouldn't stop flirting with me," Alex huffed.</p><p>"Same with me. Y/L/N invited me over to her dorm room to finish the project tonight."</p><p>Alex looked at me with wide eyes. </p><p>"And you're going?"</p><p>"Yeah. Might as well get it out of the way." Alex and I walked down the hall, avoiding walking into the many other students, to our Charms class.</p><p>"Be careful, okay? I don't trust those two. They're hot though."</p><p>"Alex!"</p><p>"What? It's true,"</p><p>Although I didn't want to admit it, she was right. That Heath girl was definitely attractive, and while she wasn't my type, she was Alex's. Y/L/N, on the other hand, would be beautiful if she wasn't such an ass. </p><p>"It'd be true if their personalities matched their looks."</p><p>"Agreed."</p><p>________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>"Y/L/N! Open the fucking door already!" I yelled through the large door. I have been standing here for 5 minutes with no response from the girl and I know she's in there because I saw her leave the dining hall a few minutes earlier.</p><p>"Calm your tits! I'm coming." I huffed and looked up from the papers in my arms as I saw the door opened. </p><p>My breath caught in my throat as I looked at the girl in front of me. She was just wearing a bra, and I swear her abs were made of rock. I looked up and down over her figure, taking in the low pants she was wearing and letting my eyes settle on her stomach. </p><p>I heard a cough, and I looked up to meet her smirking face. I growled before pushing past her into the room. </p><p>"Why the fuck did you take so long? And where's-"</p><p>"My shirt? Seems like you like me more when I'm less clothed," she said as she pushed me lightly against the door as it closed. My books fell from my hands, forgotten on the floor and I stared wide-eyed at the girl that was pressing up against me. </p><p>She moved her hands from mine against the wall to my neck. She slid them down my arms and made rubbed lightly. I cursed myself for taking off my robe and only wearing my blouse and pants. She continued her hand movements until her hands rested on my hips. </p><p>I gasped as she squeezed my hips lightly and leaned her head down until her nose grazed mine. She smirked again and squeezed once more. </p><p>"What's wrong, Pressy? Cat got your tongue?" she whispered into my face. I smelled the mint in her breath, and I assumed she just brushed her teeth. </p><p>She brought one hand up to rest on my cheek and brushed a piece of hair from my face. </p><p>"We- we should- really- work on the- the project now," I stuttered out as I tried to control my urge to melt into her hand.</p><p>'Fuck Christen. Control yourself. She's not hot. Fuck. Why am I lying to myself? She's a fucking goddess,' I thought as I once again glanced down at her abs. </p><p>'I just want to run my hands over those. Over a lot of things.'</p><p>"You don't have to hold back. I can tell what you want," she whispered into my ear. </p><p>She leaned down and took the lobe of my ear into her mouth. She nipped and sucked on the small digit. My breath caught, and I fought the urge to moan out. </p><p>"Y/L/N- we need- we need to work- on the- the project."</p><p>"Do we really? I can think of a different project."</p><p>"And what's that?" I don't know why I asked that. I felt her smirk against my ear and draw back to look into my eyes. </p><p>"Fucking you," she said. Before I knew what was happening, her lips were on mine.</p><p>My self-control was lost, and I allowed myself to get lost in the kiss. I was too turned on to realize I was about to have sex with someone I hated. </p><p>She was a magnificent kisser. She nipped and sucked in all the right places. Her tongue was doing wonders, and I let her keep control. </p><p>She broke the kiss to move her lips down my neck. She soon found my pulse point and started sucking lightly, nipping in between sucks. </p><p>She ran her hands up and down my sides, stopping to squeeze my hips and rest on my breasts. I finally moved my hands and gripped onto her back and neck as she continued to suck on my neck.</p><p>I felt her rest one hand on my hip, drawing small circles on the bone, while the other moved up to my blouse. </p><p>"God Press. You really don't know how fucking sexy you look in that blouse.  I saw you at potions and wanted to fuck you on the table right there," she moaned out, breaking only to say that before returning to kissing my neck.</p><p>"There's a table right behind you." She froze for a second, process what I was saying, before growling. </p><p>Her hand continued to unbutton the blouse before she got impatient. Growling, she broke from my neck and pulled back. She took the shirt between her hands and ripped it open, buttons flying everywhere. </p><p>I gasped and was about to say something before she kissed me again. After she broke the heated kiss, I said, "I fucking liked that blouse." </p><p>"I'll buy you a new one, Princess. Right now, I don't give a fuck about anything other than fucking you." </p><p>I gasped again as she moved her hands from palming my bra-clad breasts to my ass. She palmed and squeezed in all the right places, making me claw at her bare back. </p><p>"I'll be waiting for that blouse."</p><p>She smirked before picking me up quickly. Her hands rested on my ass, and I felt her squeeze as she looked up at me. </p><p>She moved one arm to rest under me and reached the other up to my hair. She pulled my hair from the hair tie, and it flowed down my shoulders. Her hand moved back down to my ass, and she looked back up at me again.</p><p>"A Slytherin never lies, Princess. Trust me, I'll fuck the living daylights out of you, and then I'll buy you 1000 more blouses. Just so I can rip them off of you," she growled into my ear. </p><p>I moaned out at the thought before letting myself get walked over to the table and rested down on top of it. </p><p>'A Slytherin never lies. Yeah fucking right,' I thought before getting distracted by the brunette for the night.</p>
