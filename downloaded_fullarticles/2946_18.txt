          <div class="userstuff"><p>As we all know, paintings in the wizarding world can move and talk. But many don't realise they have feelings too. This story is about a portrait who used to guard the Gryffindor common room, but was moved to a deserted classroom by a lovestruck student. This is the story of the Fat Lady and Ernie Macmillan's love.</p><p>The Fat Lady asked, "Has anyone caught wind it was you who moved me yet?"</p><p>Ernie smirked. "No one has a clue, Bernie."</p><p>The Fat Lady chuckled. "You're some boy, Ern."</p><p>Ernie bowed and smiled. "Why thank you."</p><p>The Fat Lady grinned. "I still can't believe you moved my picture just so we could talk in private."</p><p>Ernie added, "Don't forget and got away with it."</p><p>The Fat Lady replied, "All of that for a painting."</p><p>Ernie told her, "You're more than just a painting to me, Bernie."</p><p>The Fat Lady blushed and sighed. "I wish I wasn't a painting though, I want to touch you and kiss you just like any lover should be able to."</p><p>Ernie responded, "About that, I found a solution."</p><p>The Fat Lady insisted, "Go on."</p><p>Ernie produced a lifeless body of a teenage girl from thin air and explained, "Don't worry, I didn't kill her. She died in a car accident the other day, I just stole her corpse just after they buried it."</p><p>The Fat Lady gasped. "You did all that for me?"</p><p>Ernie nodded and prompted, "Try it out."</p><p>The Fat Lady walked out of her portrait to the left, where the corpse was.<br/>
Â <br/>

A tense silence filled the empty room until the corpse started breathing and her eyes fluttered open.</p><p>Ernie beamed, "It worked!</p><p>The Fat Lady in her new body giggled. "I can't believe it either."</p><p>Ernie pulled the Fat Lady into a passionate kiss.</p></div>
