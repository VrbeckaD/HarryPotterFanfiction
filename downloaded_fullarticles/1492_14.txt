    <p>Harry had just turned 14 and was looking forward to leaving the Dursley’s to go to the borrow and spend some time with his two best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He was about to start his chores when an owl just as majestic as his snowy flew into his room and perched on Hedwig’s cage making the snowy owl wake up from her nap, the owl was the total opposite of his with black feathers and white spots and navy eyes that just stood out. The only reason harry hasn’t started to pet the owl was because most have a temper and were not afraid to show it. The owl carried two letters that looked like it had the best ink written on the finest parchment available. This worried Harry because the only people he knew that could afford this type of paper where previous Death eaters or the ministry.</p>
<p>He took the letter from the regal bird and saw a wax seal with the symbol of Gringotts bank. This calmed him down a little until he realized there shouldn’t be any reason for Gringotts to write him on a personal level, he turned it over to see his address printed on the back-</p>

  <strong> Dear Mr. Potter-Black </strong>
</p>
<p>We of Gringotts would like to schedule a meeting with you about an emancipation that was requested for you by the behalf of your mother and father as well as reinstating you as head of the Most Noble and Most Ancient house of Potter and Heir Apparent of the Most Ancient and Noble house of Black. Please send your reply with either the owl that delivered this or your own.</p>
<p>Director of Gringotts</p>
<p>Sharptooth</p>
<p>The second letter while addressed to him was only left to him by his parents before they died to be given to him before his 14th birthday but knowing goblins they say no reason to wait another 2 weeks when they could get everything over with.</p>
<p>Harry,</p>
<p>Our baby boy as we write this letter watching as you chase padfoot around on your broom (your mom didn’t approve) we wish that you never have to read it but seeing how things have progressed we know that it’s necessary to write it but never forget that we love you.   </p>
<p>               On your 14th birthday right at the stroke of midnight you will come into a creature inheritance, while I have Imp blood I never manifested any of the characteristics but because your mother who we learned was from a line of squibs has Sylph blood they will make it more likely that you have an inheritance. We wanted to give you enough time to get use to the idea before it happened and not make you feel overwhelmed and freak out over it. So, on the night of July 31 at exactly 12:01 you will come into an inheritance, you will most likely have two mates and be the dominant partner in the triad. With all the serious things over with know harry that we love you from the moon and back and nothing will ever change that so live your life with love because we died not so you could suffer but, so you could live in peace for as long as it’s possible, never make anyone tell you different and give your uncles a good whack in the head because if there’s one thing I’m sure about its that you didn’t grow up with any of them and grew up with my sister. When you go to the bank there is a letter there for her please pass it to her and tell her I’m sorry for everything.</p>
<p>Your parents,</p>
<p>Lord James and Lady Lily Potter</p>
<p>While Harry was shocked about the inheritance he was sadder after what his parents said and upset that he would never hear them say those words to him. While he was also confused about why his mother would ever be sorry he knew that it would be for a good reason Looking over at where the owls sat he was shocked that they were resting against each other Hedwig was mostly a friendly bird but was quite territorial when it comes to her perch. After re-reading the letters again he started to write a short letter to the goblins.</p>
<p>Dear Sharptooth,</p>
<p>I will be able to visit the bank in two days after I have taken care of plans made earlier in the summer.</p>

<p>The morning after the letter Harry was wondering how he should bring up and explain his early departure from privet drive when he remembers that the letter said that he was emancipated so he had no actual reason to stay or even come back the next year. If he is truly emancipated that means Dumbledore no matter how hard he tries can’t make him come back to this hellhole because he would be an adult in the eyes of the law and magic. With this though he went down his ‘family’ that he was leaving to never return.</p>
<p>“Aunt petunia?” said Harry to his aunt after he realized that his uncle was still home “I’ll be leaving for my world tomorrow, but the good thing is that I won’t be coming back at all.” His aunt and uncle turned and looked at him as if Christmas was here early or when Dudley got his first A on a class work (work which I did for him).</p>
<p>“So, the other freaks are coming for you? Why so early?” Even though I heard disgust if I listened closely I could hear the concern voice, so I made up my mind to leave her a letter before I leave.</p>
<p>“I’m actually going to the wizarding bank to get my emancipation papers signed and my inheritance from my father’s family after all he was one of the richest men in both worlds.” After saying this Harry gave them a smirk that could rival that of the Weasley twins when they were pranking the Slytherins,</p>
<p>"What do you mean richest men in both worlds?” his uncle’s face was turning that awful shade of purple but harry was sure that he was going to break a rib from laughing at him.</p>
<p>“Exactly what I said he was rich so now I’m rich and going to get emancipated so I can actually get all the money. How did you think I got my stuff for school each year?”</p>
<p>“You can’t be emancipated without a guardian and were not signing anything, so you can’t get the money, but if you pay us say 1 million pounds then we might sigh them.” Harry just couldn’t hold it anymore he burst out laughing, he stayed like this for 5 minutes before he could get out a full sentence that shocked the Dursleys more than when they saw him on their doorstep almost 14 years ago.</p>
<p>“You think you have any say what happens to mean in the wizarding world? Your just muggles you don’t even have rights to me in my world, also my parents and godparents wrote in their will what would happen and, in my world, and magical wills are always carried out. So, you see I don’t need you for anything and you won’t be getting even I dollar from me.” The more harry talked the angrier his uncle got but Harry could barely care he just couldn’t get enough of those expressions.</p>
<p>“WE TOOK YOU IN AND THIS IS THE THANKS WE GET, WE FEED YOU- “ “Barely” “CLOTHED YOU-”</p>
<p>“After Dudley wore them,”</p>
<p>“AND GAVE YOU A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD- “</p>
<p>“In the cupboard under the stairs.”</p>
<p>“AND THIS IS THE THANKS WE GET I DON’T THINK SO. NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME BOY YOUR WORTHLESS PARENTS DIED AND WE AS THE GOOD PEOPLE WE ARE TOOK YOU IN YOU WILL PAY US OR ELSE.” Harry had a lot of patients but when it came to the Dursley’s he just couldn’t contain himself they just pissed him off so much.</p>
<p>“YOU DID NOTHING, BUT ABUSE AND USE ME AND YOU THINK YOU CAN ORDER ME AROUND YOU ARE NOTHING BUT PEST AND ARE NOT WORTHY OF BEING CALLED HUMAN BEINGS! IM LEAVING.” Harry turned around ready to go get his stuff when his uncle shouted a question at him that both confused and upset his for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>“WHAT ABOUT THEM?” when he turned he say something and it all clicked into place his mother’s apology all the times his aunt helped him and then the times she behaved like she cared for him it just clicked into place.</p>
<p>“Don’t you-</p>
