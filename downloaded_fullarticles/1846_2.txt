    <p>Harry Potter woke up to a searing pain coursing through his body. Wincing as he stretched his tired and aching body, Harry looked around confused, trying to remember where he was. Gritting his teeth, he moved to sit up in his bed. Suddenly, everything came back to him. Last night, he had been beaten to the point of unconsciousness by Vernon Dursley. </p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>Vernon had begun to beat Dudley that night. The beatings started earlier in the summer after overhearing Dudley tell harry he was gay. The summer had been filled with nights of Vernon beating his son under the pretense of “straightening him out.” The night had gone well at first, taking a turn for the worst with one careless comment. Dudley made a comment, forgetting his father’s stance on his sexuality, about an actor he found attractive. The man lost it; he grabbed Dudley by the collar and started pounding his fist against his son’s face. Harry tried to pull Vernon away, but couldn’t. Finally, Harry managed to get in between the two and took all the punches. Once his uncle realized he was no longer hitting his son, he started throwing harder punches. Vernon was screaming at Harry, blaming him for corrupting his son with his freakishness. </p>
<p>“If you’d died with your freak parents, my son wouldn’t have turned out to be a freak like you!” Vernon screamed.</p>
<p>Harry was used to hearing things like this, but that didn’t mean it hurt any less. Vernon stopped punching Harry. Holding still, hoping Vernon was tired and would leave like normal person, Harry sat and listened. The loud thudding of footsteps was never heard though, only the clinking of Vernon taking off his belt. Before he knew what was happening, a sharp searing pain went across Harry’s back and sides. </p>
<p>Vernon slammed the belt across Harry's back using the side with the buckle. The buckle would catch his skin and slash through it with each backward pull. Every now and then, Vernon stopped to yell more cruel words at his nephew.</p>
<p>“You got in the way of me helping my son,” Vernon yelled. “Now, I think that I’ll finally teach you a lesson you won’t forget! Thirty lashes ought to do it. I want you to count them out; if you stop, we’ll start over and continue to thirty.”</p>
<p>Harry had counted them all out correctly, and it angered Vernon into slashing Harry's already raw and bloody back him ten more times. When he finished, Harry was on the verge of passing  out from the pain and the blood loss. Harry was already weak because he hadn’t eaten since that morning when Petunia had been able to sneak him some breakfast. The beating had caused Harry to lose the tiny amount of strength he had as blood flowed freely from the large gashes that covered his back diagonally from hip to shoulder. Soon after Vernon left Harry on the kitchen floor, Harry was encased in a bright green light. His body writhed and thrashed about as Harry whimpered in pain, finally falling into unconsciousness.  </p>
<p>Dudley and Petunia had waited about 20 minutes to make sure Vernon had gone to sleep, then they helped Harry to his room. Aunt Petunia went to the cupboard that Harry once used to sleep in for the first aid kit like she had done so many nights before. When she got back to the room, Dudley had laid Harry out on his stomach on the bed. She gently cleaned the large gashes and wrapped his back.</p>
<p>Once all the cleaning and healing that the two could do was done, Petunia cleaned herself up and went to bed.  Dudley stayed with Harry to make sure he didn’t open any wounds in his sleep.After seeing Harry step in for him multiple times to defend him from his father, Dudley’s abuse stopped and the two had slowly gotten closer. As he sat watching Harry, he cried, apologizing and thanking him for stepping in between them yet again. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------- </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked over at Dudley's sleeping form and smiled gently. Harry felt a weight on his head he hadn’t noticed until he tried to look over at his desk. Shaking his head, trying to relieve some of the fogginess and weight on his head, Harry felt something soft brush his hands and face. Looking down, Harry noticed it was hair; his hair which had grown in his sleep. His unruly black locks now reached the middle of his back. Harry watched his chest rise and fall for a few breaths before looking at his desk. On his desk was a notebook with his homework, a quill and ink, and an old clock. The digital clock read 6:15 a.m. On the other side of the desk sat an empty cage. </p>
<p>“Hedwig must be not be back from her hunt yet,” Harry thought absently. Looking back to his cousin, Harry gently shook Dudley to wake him. </p>
<p>“Dud, you gotta get up and go to your room. If he catches you in here again, he'll lose it.” Dudley groaned and started to get up. </p>
<p>“You know, maybe we should talk to Mom about leaving sooner. Maybe we wait until Dad leaves for work, and start packing and just go. Do you think she'll do it this time?”</p>
<p>“I don't know, Dud. Maybe. Let's just work on breakfast first, okay?”</p>
<p>“Alright, Harry.” When the door closed behind Dudley, Harry got up to get dressed and go down stairs. Before Harry could open the door, however, a loud crack sounded in his room and then there was a green glow coming from the end of his bed. Once the glowing stopped, Harry quickly crossed the room to see what it was. Two letters sat on the end of his bed, one from Gringotts and one without a name. Harry read the blank one first, curious about who sent it. </p>
<p>Harry,</p>
<p>If you are reading this, your father and I are long gone, and you have reached your 15th birthday. I have written you this letter to tell you of truths about your life.  As you probably have figured out, yes, this is Lily, or as you have probably learned to call me, your mom, writing you. That is the first truth I would like to tell you. Harry, I am not your mother. I am your godmother. James, however, is your father.</p>
<p>And unlike most families, you have no mother. You were born to two fathers. I guess you could say James is your mother more than your father, as he is the one who carried you. Your other father is a bit of a sore subject. James has demanded I not tell you, as your father doesn't know you are his. James wishes for you to only learn of your other father if you wish to. To find out who he is, bring this letter to Gringotts with you and ask for a parentage test. He loved you greatly when you were with us. Do not hate this man for not keeping you; his memories of you have been taken from him. And that leads us to the second truth.</p>
<p>Voldemort did not kill James or myself. In fact, he tried to save us. If we have truly died, the man responsible is Dumbledore. That man is power hungry and always has been. We truly believed he was good until we discovered all the violence he had done and was still doing. James and I met with Tom Riddle ,or Voldemort, to see if this was true. What we found shocked us to our cores.</p>
<p>Tom Riddle was no willingly violent man. He actually hated it and used it only when absolutely unavoidable. He treated his followers equally and heard their opinions and complaints. And when we told him what Dumbledore said he was after and the means he had supposedly taken to get what he wanted, he was enraged. Tom asked us what we wanted from him. We just wanted the truth and he showed it to us; needless to say, we chose his side. </p>
<p>We took the Mark and worked as spies for the “dark side”. The more information we gave to the cause, the more Dumbledore got suspicious of us. Dumbledore began to use charms on us to gain our “loyalty” back and when those failed, he came after us and obviously, if you are reading this, our escape plan failed. </p>
<p>Finally, I believe that if we have failed and Dumbledore has killed us, then he may have harmed Tom and his followers. Dumbledore is a very powerful wizard and has great ability with compulsion charms and other spells used to control people. I would not put it past him to have wiped or bound the memories of Tom and his followers to make him seem evil. Please, after you finish this letter, be careful who you trust and stay away from Dumbledore. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Love, </p>
<p>Lily </p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.s. You should be getting a letter from Gringotts explaining your parentage and other blood related issues. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry finished the letter and stared at the paper in complete shock. At a loss for words, he glanced around the room. His emerald green eyes landed on the clock again. Harry had 15 minutes to get down stairs and start breakfast before Vernon would wake up. He quickly placed both letters under his pillow. As Harry walked out of his room, he looked in the mirror and noticed his hair wasn’t the only thing that had changed. Harry’s body itself had grown slimmer around the waist and his chest and face had gotten softer. Harry’s hips had widened out; to his dismay, he realized he now looked like a girl. His lips were full and a soft pink, his eyes rounder and his jaw line softened. With one last sigh, Harry attempted to tie up his hair, unsuccessfully, having never done this before. With pieces falling in his face, he gave up and rushed down the stairs.</p>
<p>When he got into the kitchen, his Aunt Petunia was already mixing together batter for pancakes. His Aunt stared at him in shock for a few minutes before finally speaking, “I thought you needed the rest so I started this for you…Harry, what happened to you? You look....”</p>
<p>“Thank you Aunt Petunia, but you know what he'll do to you if he catches you helping me again,” Harry cut her off softly, “I have no idea what happened, but can we please ignore it for now?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Harry, but you do look nice.”  Petunia subconsciously rubbed her cheek where a scar from Vernon beating her now laid. It was a permanent reminder never to lie to Vernon or help the little freak with his work. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'll finish up here and when Uncle Vernon leaves you, Dudley, and I need to talk.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Okay, Harry. How's your back?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It hurts, but I'll be fine. Thank you for treating it last night; it'd be a lot worse if you hadn't,” Harry sighed, avoiding Petunia’s eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'm going to go wake up Dudley so he can eat and get ready for our trip to London today,” said Petunia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Is that today?” Harry asked, “Oh god, can it wait for a while, so I can talk to you? Or maybe we could talk over lunch when we get there?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Let's talk over lunch,” Petunia said softly. “I really just want to get away from the house.”</p>
