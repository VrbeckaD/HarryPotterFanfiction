    <p align="center">Rise of Darkness</p><p align="center">Chapter 1</p><p align="center">Aftermath</p><p>Harry Potter, now recently married, was laying in bed, looking at his boyfriend, no, his husband Draco Malfoy. It was strange, to be so young, only fifteen, and having a husband. The memories of the night before floated through his mind. A wedding that neither wanted, having their relationship being used as pawns for the Dark Lord’s plan, and Harry’s outrage to all of it. It has been a long, eventful half year Harry thought, from that night in the graveyard to Lord Voldemort himself teaching, and later adopting him. It was his fall to the Dark Arts, his only route to his love, Draco Malfoy, at least that was he thought. And though Harry did not regret a thing he did, he knew that his work was far from done. Sighing, he turned on his bed to watch the older teen sleep across of him. “I refuse to accept their ideology,” Harry whispered. The ideology of the Dark Lord and his followers, a belief so full of hatred and bigotry that it made Harry sick. He will end it all, he will use all he has learned to destroy this ideology. He has to, not only to protect himself, but to protect his new family, his Dominant and love of his life.</p><p>But how? Frowning, Harry sat up slowly, so as not to wake Draco up. That would be the hard part, Harry figured. How he will have his revenge. Lost in thought, Harry did not hear movement from behind him, until he felt Draco’s hands on his shoulders. “You okay?” he asked.</p><p>“Huh? Yeah just lost in thought,” Harry said. “I feel I’ve made everything worse last night.”</p><p>“Maybe, but then again it is you, Harry,” Draco shrugged. “When ever will your life not be complicated?”</p><p>“When this is all over,” Harry answered seriously. Draco sighed and shook his head, “That was supposed to a joke, love,” he said. He moved so that he was sitting next to Harry and pulled him onto his lap.</p><p>“You’re thinking of how we’re going to kill your father’s followers, aren’t you?” Draco asked.</p><p>“Yeah but this doesn’t invo—”</p><p>“If you even think of finishing that sentence, I will make you regret it Harry,” Draco threatened. “We’re married now, I love you and you are my submissive! Under law and the Clause, you will do everything I tell you to. As such, you will involve me in this plan of yours.”</p><p>Harry moved to argue but Draco’s hand quickly moved to cover his mouth, pressing firmly. “Am I understood, <em>boy?</em>” he asked. “Nod for yes.”</p><p>“Good boy,” Draco smirked. He removed his hand and stood up, stretching in front of Harry. “I think we should figure out what we should do before we are forced back to our dreary reality in Britain,” he said. “And that is something I will not do on an empty stomach.” He snapped his fingers and two house-elves appeared. Draco turned to them and, much to Harry’s surprise, ordered them in perfect French. They disappeared with a loud crack like the crack of a whip and Draco turned to Harry. “Shall we get dressed, then?” he said.</p><p>Harry looked around, then down at himself, realizing that he was still in his wedding suit. “Yeah,” he said, “But I doubt you have clothes here that’ll fit me.”</p><p>“Then we’ll find the closest thing,” Draco said. “We only need something for today.” He stepped to Harry and reached towards his clothes. “May I?” he asked.</p><p>Harry nodded. Slowly, Draco started to undress Harry, a pile of his clothes growing on the floor next to them. Smaller than Draco, Harry stood wearing only his underwear, his nipples hard and the hints of muscles showing. Draco smiled and leaned down, kissing Harry’s neck and chest, leaving small bites and licks as he go. “Go shower,” he ordered, “I’ll look for clothes while you get clean.”</p><p>“You trying to say I smell, Malfoy?” Harry said with an uneasy smile. Draco glanced up and gave Harry’s chest a long lick, moving up past his neck until their lips met, Draco’s tongue shoving into Harry’s mouth and claiming dominance.</p><p>“Yes Malfoy,” Draco chuckled, “something like that.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes but smiled genuinely, “Okay then, Sir,” he said in a teasing tone, “I’ll go get clean for Master now.”</p><p>“Good boy,” Draco said, patting Harry’s butt. Harry chuckled and followed Draco to the bathroom. While Harry cleaned himself, Draco took his time looking through the clothes stored in his summer room, pulling out shirts and pants that looked like they might fit Harry. He found an old sweater that might look good on Harry, as well as a pair of pants that looked as though Harry would wear. Draco thought for a moment about underwear, and smirked to himself as he only pulled out an undershirt for Harry, but no underwear. For socks, he just chose a random pair. Harry stepped out moments later, a towel wrapped around his waist.  He looked at the clothes, which Draco has laid out on the bed, and frowned. “Where’s the underwear?” he asked.</p><p>“You don’t need it,” Draco said, moving to the bathroom. “Get dressed while I shower, food should be here soon,” he ordered. The door closed behind Draco, and Harry obeyed, dressing in the clothes Draco has chosen. He felt awkward that there was no underwear, but the pants did not itch or irritate him, so he guessed it was fine.</p><p>A couple minutes later, house-elves appeared and began to prepare a small table with two sets of plates, chairs, and food. As he approached the table, the house elves disappeared. Alone, Harry decided to sit down and wait for Draco. The blonde stepped out of the bathroom minutes later, already dressed surprisingly. He made his way to Harry, kissed his cheek, then sat down across of him. He looked down at the food then said, “This should be better than anything you can get in Britain, Harry.”</p><p>Harry just nodded, suddenly feeling ravenous. He took a bite of eggs and let out a moan, it was actually really good, not as good as Mrs. Weasley’s cooking, but he wasn’t going to tell Draco that. Both boys did not speak as they ate, lost in their own thoughts. It was only when their plates were first empty, did Draco said, “How did you plan first to do this?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Harry said, “The Killing Curse maybe?”</p><p>“Can you even use that spell?” Draco asked. “As in, can you even kill with it?”</p><p>“Once,” Harry said. “I was angry… very angry. I… I didn’t feel myself.”</p><p>“When,” Draco paused before asking cautiously, “when was it?”</p><p>“When Voldemort recruited me,” Harry said. “I killed Wormtail.”</p><p>Draco was silent for a moment, “So that is what happened to him,” he muttered to himself. He shook his head, “Its nothing,” he said. “Anyway Harry, I think it would be better if we use something more… reliable.”</p><p>“Like what?” Harry asked.</p><p>“A poison perhaps,” Draco suggested. “That way, we do not need to be anywhere near them when they die. They just need to have one tiny sip, and their deaths are imminent.”</p><p>Harry thought for a moment. “Draco!” he gasped, all but leaping over the table to hug his lover and now husband. “That’s a great idea!” he grinned. “But what poison to use? Voldemort taught me some, but they’re all instant and mostly traceable.”</p><p>Draco thought again, pulling Harry into his lap and petted his hair. “That,” he sighed, “I do not know precisely, however I have a feeling to know where to look.”</p><p>“Oh really?” Harry asked, “Where is there? Surely not Knockturn Alley, we’ll be recognized instantly.”</p><p>“No, no, there is a place here in France, the French version of Knockturn Alley, if you would,” Draco said. “It is called, <em>Ruelle Nocturne, </em>or in English, Nocturnal Alley, I know, bit of an obvious name, but not as obvious as Knockturn Alley and it’s pun.” He rolled his eyes and smiled at Harry. “Nobody will recognize us there. All they will see is a man and his husband.”</p><p>“Oh really?” Harry asked, getting a teasing tone, “and which one of us is the man?”</p><p>“I am of course,” Draco said, pinching Harry’s nipple through the shirt. “Now be a good husband and get ready, I have shoes of almost all sizes, find your size and put on the pair you like.” He gestured towards another door that Harry did not notice. He got up, jumping when Draco slapped his butt playfully, and gasped when he opened this new door. As Draco said, there was shoes of every size and style the Malfoys would deem acceptable to be seen in public in. Harry spent a few minutes looking for shoes that most closely resembled his old shoes but finding none he decided on what felt most comfortable.</p><p>When both were ready, Draco took Harry’s arm and led him out of the bedroom. The summer house was far bigger than Harry had ever imagine, however he did not have time to look around as Draco brought him to the nearest fireplace where a gold carrier held floo powder. “Hold onto me, boy,” Draco commanded, taking a fistful of floo powder and both stepping into the immense fireplace. Throwing it onto the floor, Draco yelled out clearly, <em>“Ruelle Nocturne!” </em>and as the green flames surged up, Harry felt the familiar spinning sensation of traveling through fireplaces.</p><p>When the spinning stopped, Harry saw that they were in a café. He stepped out and looked around as Draco brushed soot off their clothes. It was a lively place, tables full of witches and wizards huddled close to each other, their private conversations mulling together to a loud, singular noise that Harry couldn’t pick out from. He felt Draco take his hand and pull, “Come on,” he said, “business first.”</p><p>Harry nodded and allowed Draco to pull him out of the café, the blond nodding to a very handsome man on the way out. They stepped into a cloudy street with large shops pushed against one another, streetlamps still lit as witches and wizards dressed in heavy cloaks shouldered their way to and from the various shops. It somehow seemed a happier place than Knockturn Alley, in Harry’s opinion. The shops were all colorful instead of the moody greys and blacks that the shops in Knockturn Alley shared, and the people were talking with each other in quick French, instead of having the solemn, suspicious shifty-eyed silence and look that the wizards who frequent Knockturn Alley usually have. Even though he couldn’t read the names of the shops, Harry found his eyes wandering like the first time he entered Diagon Alley, looking at all the colorful shops.</p><p>They stopped at a perfectly normally looking bookstore, much to Harry’s surprise, and Draco held the door open for him. “Obviously I’ll do the talking,” he said. He glanced at Harry for a moment, “Hold still,” he commanded. Draco pressed his wand against Harry’s neck. He felt a thick leather wrapping around it, before resting comfortably. Smirking at it, Draco pocketed his wand, “There,” he said.</p><p>“A collar?” Harry asked curiously, “why?”</p><p>“The owner likes them,” Draco said, “he is.. much more manageable if he sees a person wearing one. Now, be a good boy and let me do all the talking.”</p><p>Harry shrugged an ‘ok’ and followed Draco further inside. It was darker on the inside. The walls were painted a dark green, with candles flickering on black sconces between bookshelf upon bookshelf of books. Hanging from the ceiling was a small lamp, shining oddly brightly. The books were all sectioned in French, and in front of them was an impressive display of dark objects that took Harry’s interest. A man’s voice shook him, as he looked up to see a burly man walk towards them. He was speaking French, and Harry was never so relieved to have Draco next to him as he did in that moment. The blonde took charge, replying in French, and pulled Harry to his side after a comment, showing a clear ownership with his body language. The man’s black eyes fell upon Harry’s face, lingering down to his collar when a smirk appeared. He made a comment to Draco, who shared a grin and patted Harry’s butt, “Go look around babe,” he said in English, “the potions books are over there.”</p><p>“What did you tell him?” Harry asked.</p><p>“I’ll explain later,” Draco said.</p><p>Harry gave Draco a look but relented. He went to the bookshelf Draco pointed him to and was amazed to see that the vast bookshelf had editions and copies of books in various languages. He could not remember seeing any book in Spanish or French or even Japanese in Flourish and Blotts in Diagon Alley. Without any real plan of organization, Harry browsed the bookshelf while Draco talked with the shop owner. Harry pulled out books every now and again, leafing through the contents but never finding a potion or poison that he liked. He did not know how lone he was looking through when Draco approached him.</p><p>“Found anything baby?” he asked.</p><p>“No,” Harry said.</p><p>“Well, good for us, I was able to sweat talk the owner,” Draco said, glancing back, “he somehow thinks we’re in our twenties, looking very youthful, and while it was disgusting, he just wanted to watch you browse his wares.”</p><p>Harry frowned, “And how is this good?” he asked.</p><p>“He had a secret collection,” Draco continued, “and after some talking, he showed it to me.” From his back, Draco pulled out an old looking book with a thick heavy black leather cover. The title was pressed on in a gold ink reading <em>Poisons Moste Evile</em>. “It’s a sister book to a book of a very similar name,” Draco said. “Barely any copies survive, and I was able to get this one for free.”</p><p>“Free?” Harry asked, “how?”</p><p>Draco gave Harry a sly, cheeky grin. “Short story, the manager made some very rude and lewd comments about you, my pet. Comments that only I should ever say about you. I’ve revealed my age and name and threatened to alert the French Aurors. Well, the Malfoy name carries weight even here, and fearing not to cross with that, and have his shop taken away, he gladly has given me this English version of the text for my silence about his unfortunate comments.”</p><p>“Draco,” Harry whispered, equally impressed and afraid. “I’m going to yell at you for using me like that later on… but for now, I’m very impressed.”</p><p>Draco kissed Harry and smiled, “You should be, my love. Your husband is very skilled with his tongue.” Harry raised an eyebrow at that, “Then I really should get to know this skill, Malfoy,” he said.</p><p>“You will, Harry Malfoy,” Draco purred. Holding the book to his side, he took Harry’s hand and pulled him out of the shop. Harry felt the weight of the collar still against his skin, and blushed as they were in public. “You never told me,” he said, “why the collar?”</p><p>“To show the bastard that you’re mine, simply,” Draco said. “And, because I always wanted to collar the great Harry Potter, just decided that back then was a good enough time.”</p><p>“Without asking me?” Harry asked.</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, “Of course I’m going to ask you when I do it permanently,” he said, “that time was just a trial. Why? Is it too tight? Too heavy?”</p><p>Harry blushed, “Actually,” he admitted, “it feels just right.” Draco smiled at that.</p><p>“Then there is no need to remove it then, my love,” he said. He moved his hand to carass the back of Harry’s neck. The smaller teen relaxed under Draco’s touch, and leaned towards him as they walked back to the café. Again, Draco did the talking, and soon Harry and him found themselves in a secluded table in the back of the café. Draco took out <em>Poisons Moste Evile </em>and looked up at Harry.</p><p>Harry stared back at him, confused. “What?”</p><p>“It’s your idea and mission, you should open the book and look for the poison we’re making,” Draco said.</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said. Draco pushed the book towards him, and Harry felt the book in his hands. It felt heavy, Harry found his hands trembling slightly. Not from fear, but from a sick excitement. He opened the cover slowly, doing his best to hide his smile. The pages felt good, they were old, yellowish, but still the words printed were in perfect condition. He was quickly absorbed in the book, leafing through the pages and skimming its contents. There were so many different potions and poisons. Poisons that killed instantly, that given various deadly illnesses, freezes the heart, fill the lungs with toxic… so many deadly poisons and each with a detailed picture description. Harry looked through them all, his excitement mixing with disgust. At some point a drink appeared next to Harry, which turned out to be hot chocolate.</p><p>Draco was silent as Harry skimmed the book, watching carefully and admiring the concentration. Harry only looked up when he was near the end of the book, his hand holding it open while the other held his cup. “Did you find something?” Draco asked.</p><p>“Maybe,” Harry said, “just listen.” He looked down at the book, as did Draco. There was a moving detailed drawing of a man holding his neck, gasping fruitlessly for breath, his face turning a vivid purple as his eyes bulged. “<em>’The Strangler, an assassin’s best friend. A rather useful poison, both traceless and tasteless, the Strangler will always meet its victims when they least expect it. A delay potion, The Strangler takes its victims three days after consumption, allowing the assassin to be far away for when the victim finally succumbs.’ </em>This would be great! If we can get them to drink this poison, we won’t have to worry about the others getting suspicious. It’ll just seem like old men dying.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah that’ll be great,” Draco agreed. He nodded and looked at the book, muttering the ingredients needed. “Many of these are very rare,” he said. “Belladonna I would expect, as with Hellebore and Hemlock, those I can get easily, we can get those from Snape’s personal stash. But the others… Blood lilies, venom from various snakes… this will take time to gather. However…” he continued to read the directions, “we should be able to make it. Especially if you and your friends were able to make Polyjuice Potion three years ago.”</p><p>Harry nodded in agreement and looked at the directions as well. It would take less time than the Polyjuice Potion to make, two weeks instead of a month, however one cauldron’s worth would be more than plenty for what they need. “Then, we should create a list then,” he said. “Of those we’re giving the poison to.”</p><p>“Yaxley,” Draco said without a pause, “that old man is just horrid. Ah.” He signaled a cute waiter and after some rapid French, the waiter gave Draco a quill. Draco took it and wrote Yaxley’s name on the side of the page, next to the choking picture. “He is one of You-Know-Who’s more fanatic supporters.”</p><p>Harry nodded and said, “And everyone who is Azkaban. Voldemort wants to free them soon… I know it’s going to be soon.”</p><p>Draco hesitated for a moment, “My aunt is one of them,” he said. “Bellatrix Lestrange.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“I never met her,” Draco said. He looked worried, “however my mother and her were close…”</p><p>“She’s also Sirius’ cousin,” Harry said, the memory suddenly popping in. “But I don’t think he’ll care about her death.”</p><p>Draco gave a short nod and with a sigh, wrote down the names Bellatrix Lestrange, Antonin Dolohov, Augustus Rookwood, Travers, Rabastan Lestrange, Rodolphus Lestrange, and Mulciber II. He looked up at Harry, waiting for the next name. “Parkinson,” Harry said, “her dad, as with Greengrass. Avery… Crabbe and Goyle are too stupid to be a threat, I think.”</p><p>“You’re right,” Draco nodded. “Just make them understand we’re stronger.” He wrote down the names, as well as two more. “The Carrow twins,” he said. “Mother and father told me horror stories about those two. They are sadistic and mad like the others. There is also Rowle, Thorfinn Rowle… and Gibbon… I cannot remember his first name.” Harry nodded and looked at the list, counting.</p><p>“Fifteen,” he said. “Fifteen victims. Strange, I would think there would be more.”</p><p>“There are those who are not specifically Death Eaters but support You-Know-Who’s cause,” Draco said. “Such as Fenrir Greyback.”</p><p>Harry frowned, “Who?”</p><p>“A werewolf,” Draco said. “During the first war, father told me stories of how he would steal kids, do …stuff to them and turn them. He’s savage, an animal given human form. It is a certainty that Voldemort will call on his aide during this war, just as he did with the giants.”</p><p>“Then we need to get rid of him as well,” Harry said. Draco agreed, writing down the name. “Sixteen,” he said.</p><p>“Snape,” Harry said.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“But he’s a Death Eater,” Harry argued.</p><p>“He works for Dumbledore as well,” Draco said. “Sixteen is enough Harry, no more.” And to emphasize his point, Draco closed the book and placed the quill down. Harry looked like he wanted to argue more but relented.</p><p>“Fine,” he said, “Not Snape.” He relaxed back in his chair. He glanced down at the book, his heart was beating fast. “Are you nervous?” he asked.</p><p>“Terribly,” Draco said, “I… I don’t know how I was able to write their names.”</p><p>“I think this is enough for now,” Harry said. “We can… we can get the ingredients together later. Use the Shadow-walkers when needed.”</p><p>“Agreed,” Draco nodded. “In the meantime, we should figure our your lie.”</p><p>“My lie?” Harry asked.</p><p>“That you will tell your godfather and friends,” Draco said. “You did disappear yesterday without a trace.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry blushed. “I… I forgotten about that.” He bit his bottom lip, “I’ll think of something. I’m good at that. Lying on the spot.”</p><p>“Then we should get back my love,” Draco said. He stood up and held out his hand for Harry. Harry accepted and smiled as he stood up, meeting Draco’s lips in a kiss. Draco’s hand moved to his ass and held with a tight grip as Harry got the book. Still holding onto Harry’s ass, Draco escorted him to the fireplace again, paying on their way out. A few moments later, they were back in the Malfoy summer house, and as soon as they stepped out, Draco pushed Harry against the wall, kissing him roughly as his hands squeezed and played with his ass through the clothes. Harry moaned and melted in the kiss.</p><p>Licking him as he moved away, Draco smirked “That should last you until we come back,” he said. “Be a good boy, Harry.”</p><p>“Yes Sir,” Harry smiled, his cheeks crimson. Draco took out his wand and the lights around them went out, the curtains on windows drawn and shadows overtook them. Draco led Harry towards the darkest shadow, the familiar red eyes greeting them. Being a good husband, he figure it was only best to escort his husband and submissive home. The red eyes of the shadow-walkers around them, Harry and Draco walked in silence, enjoying each other’s company. Harry laid his head on Draco’s shoulder as they walked.</p><p>Suddenly the red eyes vanished. Harry felt a hand around his throat. As he and Draco were pulled back through the shadows, and as light surrounded them, they were face to face with Lord Voldemort.</p>
