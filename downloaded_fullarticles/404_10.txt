    <p>The night is still and quiet when Harry shows up at Luna’s 17-and-a-halfth birthday party.</p><p>Harry stands, listless, shifting his weight from foot to foot on the Lovegood’s front doorstep as the dirigible plums glow in the night air. His eyes linger on a great scorched crack in the side of the house, just over the door. A scar from the death eater attack, still unmended.</p><p>He’s in more than just his pants and a ratty t-shirt for the first time in almost a week, in a dark green sweater which Hermione had chosen and the comfiest pair of jeans he owns that are at least semi-presentable.</p><p>The door creaks open, and light spills from within. A whiff of herbs and some fruit Harry can't quite place takes him back to his last time he was there, to the pungent, oversteeped tea Xenophilius poured with shaking hands before the death eaters came, and the animal panic in his eyes.</p><p>Harry feels dread set deep in his stomach. He swallows. Tries to tell himself, it’s over, you daft idiot. It ended and it's over.</p><p>“Harry? Is that you? It’s been a quite a while,” comes a slow, dreamy voice.</p><p>Once his eyes adjust, Harry finds himself looking down at Luna Lovegood in all her eccentric glory. Great, glossy black and purple feathers dangle from her ears and dust the top of a kaleidoscopic quilt dress that could charitably be described as unique.</p><p>“Happy birthday, Luna. Half-birthday. Sorry I’m late.”</p><p>“I don’t mind, Harry. That color looks rather nice on you, by the way. You look like a rather healthy mandrake.”</p><p>“Er, thanks?” Harry’s ears are hot, that old familiar I-shouldn’t-be-here-wasting-time-when-there’s-a-war-on feeling starting to burn in him. Like a phantom limb that won’t go away. Harry opts for an obvious question, the quickest path inside. He’s spent too much time standing on doorsteps, sweating. “Are Ron and Hermione here yet?”</p><p>“They got here a few minutes ago,” Luna says, stepping into the warm yellow glow. “Please, come in.”</p><p>Harry follows her in, taking in the crowded room. There are familiar faces and new ones — Neville ambles around, fingers brushing the tiny blunt spines of the aloes and succulents Luna has potted in little pink and green ceramics. A girl Harry doesn’t know with silver braids sits on the carpet, laughing with her arm around another girl who keeps her shy dark eyes low, and Lavender and Parvati are whispering into one another’s ear by a table laden with pink pastries.</p><p>Cho stands by the window, alone with her arms crossed over her chest and a steaming cup of black tea in one hand. She waves at Harry with her free hand, shoots Luna a little smile, and leans against the counter as if to say <em> I’ll be here</em>.</p><p>“I’m rather pleased at the turnout,” Luna says with a slow, almost shy smile that lights up her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah,” is all he can say as he scans the crowd, feeling a great sense of relief. The room does not smell how it did then — this is a house Luna lives in, once more. Harry smells fresh paint on the walls from the blue rabbits layered over the previous paint job and something buttery and sweet in the oven.</p><p>In truth, he hadn’t kept in touch with Luna - or anyone but Ron and Hermione, for that matter - after the end of the war. He was shocked when the owl came with the invitation, penned in eggshell, a page of Luna’s distinctive, loopy handwriting.</p><p><em> 17 and a half-th</em>, she wrote, <em> because the gurdyroots are coming along beautifully in the garden, shooting red winding sprouts above the soil, and I’m rather sick of pretending to be happy in the winter. Besides, it’s said that wrackspurts bestow good luck upon those who celebrate the halves of things. </em></p><p>“Oi! Harry!” says a voice, and suddenly there’s a heavy arm slung around his shoulders and Ron’s comforting grassy smell. “Saved a tart for you. Like animals, this lot.”</p><p>“I’m sure you had nothing to do with it, Ron.”</p><p>“‘Course not,” Ron says. “It was all Neville.”</p><p>“Lies,” calls a voice from across the room. Harry looks to see Hermione walking their way. "You're late," she says in a mock disapproving tone, but her smile turns earnest. "I'm glad you came, Harry."</p><p>"Yeah. Me too," Harry says, and he means it.</p><p>The next hour goes smoothly, more or less. Harry takes great pains to feign interest in Neville's latest area of herbological inquiry, plants that briefly and disastrously alter the shape of internal organs<em> juust </em>enough for things get really messy. He tries to act surprised when Seamus announces his plans to go into magical pyrotechnics.</p><p>Then, Harry accidentally sits beside Cho on a bench in the garden when he steps out for a little breath of warm summer air, perfumed with something spicy and floral from some bulbous, lantern-like deep plum flowers.</p><p>Neither of them talk about Cedric but he knows they are both thinking about Cedric. She asks if he's coming back to Hogwarts, he says, I don't know. Harry feels a small tenuous burning pride that his throat does not close up this time, he can breathe more or less.</p><p>He can even smile just a little bit when Cho lays a hand on his arm — short nails, painted some dark chipping color — and quickly retracts it.</p><p>The moment is strange. Something inside Harry, some ghost of his fifth year self maybe, expects something. A flash of light. A feeling of warmth in his stomach. He has been lonely.</p><p>It has been the loneliest summer yet, even free of the Dursleys and living with his best mates. It’s because <em> he </em>changed. Harry cannot bring himself to start Auror training, though the Ministry letters assure him they will take him without N.E.W.T.S.</p><p>But Harry has grown sullen and scared. And he is running out of excuses.</p><p>It isn’t just flashes of memory, faces in green light, distant screams. His trauma is written in the body. The scars on his hands— <em> I must not tell lies.</em> The way he takes food to his room to eat, remembering, seven years later, Dudley’s pink grasping hands. The long walks outside Grimmauld’s place at four in the am and the sudden shakes and the long periods without eating, without drinking, without bathing, without sleeping.</p><p>And - lonely or not, afraid or not - there is nothing. The touch kindles nothing in him. Cho is beautiful. The freckles on her nose and spattered over her cheeks and chin are the same as they were when he kissed her. But he is not the same Harry as the boy reflected, kaleidoscopic, in the room of requirement. And Cho isn't either. She holds her shoulders with a stubbornness that is new to Harry. She does not lean toward him. Her eyes are sharp, and she looks strong. Stronger than he feels.</p><p>Harry goes back inside. Grabs a drink. On his way, he runs into Ginny on the stairs, talking and laughing with a teammate from the Harpies, and at once everything he’s been avoiding rushes back. Ginny snorts when her friend, a tall girl in a muggle tracksuit, cracks a joke, and Harry aches with missing her. He misses her sense of humor and fierce independence. He misses the way the two of them could fill silences easily and laugh easily and how they competed over every little thing.</p><p>The feeling makes his intestines coil into a great big knot.</p><p>Harry waves hello tentatively, almost mechanically, when their eyes meet.</p><p>Ginny smiles back at him. It comes easy on her face, maybe because she’s drunk, he doesn’t know. She’s cut her hair short, close to her scalp. It makes it a little easier, that she looks different. Ginny pulls him aside and they chat about Ron’s lingering obsession with Victor Krum and the next Harpies Game, the proclivities of the players Ginny will be facing the next week. The conversations flows naturally. He walks away grinning.</p><p>Feeling warm, at ease, and a just a little buzzed after a swig or three of firewhiskey, Harry grabs a few of Xenophilius’s fig and beet danishes and sinks into an huge patchwork couch. He’s vaguely aware he should find Ron and Hermione, but he isn’t their child after all, no matter what they seem to think.  He’s allowed to sit alone on a couch and to walk around unchaperoned. Harry takes a big bite of the danish. </p><p>That’s when he sees him. A few feet away on an identical couch, Luna sits, butterbeer in hand. Lounging next to her, arm draped along the back of the couch, is Draco Malfoy.</p><p>His hair’s, well, cut kind of oddly. Harry thinks with some alarm that he must have done it himself, or asked Luna to do it maybe, or got his pointy head caught in some kind of machine. Malfoy’s swallowed in a white button up shirt that must be at least two sizes too big, and he holds a wine glass half-filled with some sort of indeterminate clear liquid and Luna and Malfoy are engrossed in their conversation. They don’t notice him sit, so Harry just gawks.</p><p>The two are close, speaking quietly enough he can’t make out their conversation.</p><p>Luna says something, and Malfoy’s face cracks into a grin. The expression is so alien to those cold, sharp features that for a moment, Harry wonders if he has a long-lost twin — the good one to Malfoy’s evil.</p><p>Then, without warning, Malfoy turns his head and catches Harry dead in the eye.</p><p>There is a pause. As if he expects something. Then Malfoy’s nose wrinkles. “What’s wrong with you, Potter?”</p><p>“I— I didn’t expect to see you here,” Harry says.</p><p>“Nor I <em> you</em>,” he drawls, and Harry is hit with a rush that feels like vertigo and leaves him immediately, acutely nostalgiac and irritated. “Last I heard, you were playing the hermit, hiding away from the world’s problems in your little flat with Granger and Weasley. Never to emerge.”</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes. Good to see some things don’t change. “Sod off, Malfoy,” he says.</p><p>Luna looks between them. “We haven’t had a chance to talk yet, the three of us,” she says. “This is lovely.”</p><p>“Not exactly the word I’d use.” Harry crosses his arms, scowling. He forgot how this git winds him up just by breathing.</p><p>Malfoy rolls his eyes. “I’m not judging you, Potter,” he says, and shrugs nonchalantly.</p><p>But not nonchalantly enough. It sloshes some of the liquid in his glass onto his white shirt. Malfoy doesn't notice or pretends not to. “Well, perhaps a little bit. Were I you, I might do the same, but I don’t exactly have the luxury. The Prophet’s going mad with you gone. They’ve lost their favorite target. Now they have to find someone else’s privacy to invade. Fucking vultures.” Malfoy takes another sip of his drink, lip curled.</p><p>“They’ve been rather horrible… ” Luna says. Her earrings flutter and release little puffs of charmed glitter when she shakes her head. “A man from the Prophet came to talk to my father about buying the rights to the Quibbler to make it a column in the paper. People lost faith in the Prophet, you know, during the war. They wanted to buy it back. But my father told them to bugger off.”</p><p>“Psh. Malfoy only cares because they run more articles on his family now.” Harry decides that talking <em> around </em>Malfoy is what will really get under his skin. He is not sure what he’s said is true, but it seems like it should be.</p><p>Harry hasn’t had the energy nor the fortitude to unroll the Prophet since the Battle, more or less. The times he has, it's like Ron’s bloody radio. Body counts out of context, never anything meaningful, never an attempt at any solution. It's depressing. Maddening.</p><p>Malfoy rolls his eyes. “I welcome any exposure of my family’s war crimes.” He waves his hand, lips curling. “But the press only ever cared about the tragic wife, the poor mislead boy, the descent of a Respected Pureblood Family into Dark Magic. Who<em>ever </em> could have predicted such a thing?”</p><p>Malfoy shakes his head, as Luna laughs, as if this is a reference to something they’ve spoken about privately. His eyes catch the glow of the string lights hung around the window. It makes him look manic. “They never really gave a shit about what we were <em> doing </em> —that whole genocide plot, it's not sexy, it doesn’t sell. All the politicians are doing it, I hear. But Potter... Potter's news whether or not he shows himself to the public.”</p><p>“I’m not —” Harry sighs. Through his teeth. He realizes Malfoy has turned it back around on him. He’s speaking to Luna while looking at Harry. “What do you care, anyway?” he says, sounding like he’s thirteen again.</p><p>“I don’t, really.” Malfoy shrugs, examining the pristine nails on the stem of the glass. “I’m just sick of it. If I have to see ‘Harry Potter: the Boy Who Hid’ once more as a headline, I will scream. Thank Merlin for the Quibbler.”</p><p>Harry snorts. A low blow, poking fun at Luna in her own home. How quintessentially Slytherin. “Didn’t mummy ever teach you to be nice to the host?”</p><p>“Once again, you wound me. I’ll have you know I <em> adore </em> the Quibbler.”</p><p>Harry snorts again, <em> Merlin, has his voice always been this bloody smug? </em>He keeps his hand away from his wand. With great effort. “Yeah? I’m sure you read it every morning with your tea.” He rolls his eyes. “Name one article.”</p><p>Malfoy shoots him a venomous look. Harry notices a new glint when he moves his head— Malfoy’s left ear is pierced through with a thin silver ring. “That editorial on the mating cycle of waffle-skinned gingrisks? Fascinating stuff. I’m certain <em> you </em>wouldn’t know.”</p><p>Harry starts to laugh, glad to have put Malfoy in his place, when Luna smiles again.</p><p>“I’m glad you liked it. I thought that one was interesting, too.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Thirty minutes later, they’re cross-legged on the floor, playing exploding snap. Harry hasn’t seen Ron or Hermione in a while. He doesn’t know how long.</p><p>Neville and Dean joined in a few hands ago. Neville is behind Luna in last place, though he seems happy just to be playing. Luna’s concentration is elsewhere. Cho sits just behind her, leaning on her a little bit, absorbed in some book with a red cover that the two of them are talking about in soft tones below the cries and yelps of the rest of them.</p><p>Dean’s competing with Malfoy at the top.</p><p>Dean is definitely a better player than Malfoy, but there’s no way Harry should be losing to this blonde prat - not fairly, at least.</p><p>Malfoy is cheating, and Harry’s not about to let him get away with it. Sure, he hasn’t actually caught him yet, but he knows. Malfoy seems to be the only sober person in the game, which is suspect enough, or perhaps he is really just that uptight. Whatever it is, Harry watches his hands closely, determined to be the one to catch him.</p><p>Malfoy plays with ferocious silent concentration. But when he gets a little too cocky, he lapses into trash talk, and then Dean, ever perceptive, gets a one-over on him.</p><p>But it is Harry’s turn to fuck up. He’s too busy watching and analyzing and trying to make sense of what the hell is going on. The cards explode in Harry’s face. The room reeks with alcohol and drying paint and burnt hair.</p><p>Malfoy sneers. “Having difficulties, Potter?”</p><p>Again, Harry barely stops himself from hexing him.</p><p>Dean wins the match, thank Merlin. Malfoy puts on a show of quiet dignity, but it’s clear his pride is bruised.</p><p>Harry gets up. He’s satisfied just to see a dent in Malfoy’s ego, if a bit bitter he wasn’t the one to put it there. But he can’t stay to gloat because all of a sudden he really, desperately needs to piss.</p><p>Harry roams the hallways, praying somehow he’ll stumble into the Lovegood’s bathroom, and when he rounds a corner, he almost collides into Ginny and the girl from earlier, the Harpy, snogging against the wall.</p><p>Ginny jerks back. Her hair is tangled. Her face is so red it blends with her hair and obliterates her freckles.</p><p>“Harry! I- uh,” she starts to say.</p><p>Harry says, “Oh.”</p><p>“Shit,” is all she seems to be able to say. The girl starts to laugh into her fist, a low pleasant rough laugh. She is unfazed by Harry’s gawking.</p><p>“Oh,” he says again, and starts to laugh. Holy shit, alright. It's okay, it doesn't hurt, they've been broken up for months now, and anyway, those months felt like years.</p><p>The situation is awkward and surreal and embarrassing, but Harry is drunk and giddy, glad just to be out of his flat, acting like some semblance of a normal human with normal human friends who do normal human things for the first time what seems like in ages.</p><p>Harry also feels a strange sort of relief, that he hasn’t broken her heart. Though that’s maybe an arrogant assumption if he stops to think about it. He had no idea that Ginny was… but what does it matter if they failed at being in love because of this, or on their own terms?</p><p>Harry thinks of their fumbling stiff kisses and Ginny’s sudden panicked looks when the topic of anything <em> more </em> floated to Harry’s lips, and it makes sense. Of course. Holy shit.</p><p>“No- Fuck, I’m sorry,” he says, still shaking with laughter. “Really fucking sorry, Gin. Er, I’m just gonna, go now, thanks.”</p><p>Ginny and the Harpy girl look at him like he’s lost his mind.</p><p><em> Have fun, </em> he almost says, but smacks himself, and stumbles into the bathroom.</p><p>They’re gone when he comes out, which is good and fine, and he’s alright, and happy.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry blinks and the windows are pitch dark. Dots of yellow light drift in the void, little torchbugs weaving through the Lovegood’s garden.</p><p>Most of the people left are too comfortable or too drunk to apparate home.</p><p>Dean’s still playing exploding snap, now one-on-one with Neville. Seamus is not playing but he leans with his arm slung across Dean’s narrow back, trying Dean’s concentration. Harry sees his mouth move from across the room, watches those sooty cheeks wrinkle into a smile as Dean doubles over laughing and his cards spill from his hand and onto the blue painted wood floor.</p><p>Neville’s winning the match, and a troll could play better than him. But Seamus and Dean are knackered, as is Harry.</p><p>He thinks Ron and Hermione are snogging somewhere as they are wont to do now and again when they decide to stop being Harry’s caregivers, or maybe they have gone home. Everything’s taken on a soft, fuzzy edge. He feels exceptionally warm. No anxiety, no guilt.</p><p>Well, maybe a little guilt. He can’t stop thinking about Malfoy. It’s not like sixth year, not really. He just needs to figure him out. Why the fuck is here? What’s his angle?</p><p>Harry hadn’t thought much about Malfoy since Narcissa wrote him, in her delicate spidery hand, to ask him to speak at their trial. Harry went all the way to the ministry, feeling duty-bound to the woman who saved him, trying desperately to cultivate a feeling of Reconciliation and Second Chances.</p><p>He walked halfway down that black gleaming brick hall before feeling sick to his stomach. Harry ducked into the first bathroom he could find and hid in the stall. He pressed his face against his knees on the toilet and thought of Hermione’s arm splayed out and her back pressed against the marble tile of the manor as Bellatrix's knife made butter of her skin. And of Lucius, and the sock, and the shallow sandy grave by the sea. Harry thought of Draco. Venomous and terrified. A heel applied against the cartilage of his nose, and the sharp bloom of pain.</p><p>And Harry went back into the Floo and left.</p><p>He heard Arthur talking about the outcome, the next morning. Lucius went back to his <em>imperio</em> excuse, and when that lost traction, he tried to argue that he was coerced into it by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, under pain of death, and that he cared deeply for society, and had funneled millions of galleons into philanthropy. Narcissa’s trial was shorter. She recanted, and offered the Ministry names.</p><p>Life in Azkaban, for Lucius. House arrest for Narcissa. A handsome fine the Malfoys could pay for by selling maybe one or two of their silver dining sets.</p><p>And nothing, not a single charge for Draco Malfoy.</p><p>He turned against his father, Arthur said, blowing a curtain of steam off his tea. Draco brought documents. Scrolls, parchments, stacks of papers. Unearthed fromhis father’s study, signed with his father’s name. His mother thought they were part of his defense. But Draco mounted no defense of his own.</p><p>You would not have believed the look on her face, Arthur told him. Narcissa went white as a sheet, her hands started to shake, and she could no longer look at her son.</p><p>It worked well for the two of them in the end. Lucius was the one they really wanted, anyway. Narcissa and Draco, they could be rehabilitated.</p><p>And now, in the free world, with his father at the mercy of dementors — a thought that gives Harry some spiteful satisfaction, and a great deal more confusion —  Malfoy is pouring through vinyls with Luna.</p><p>Hermione told him a while back that she had gotten into muggle music, even got a record player and started going to shops in the closest muggle town.</p><p>And apparently, Malfoy goes with her.</p><p>“Fuck the Beatles,” he’s saying, waggling a cardboard square in the air. “I can’t believe you spent honest-to-Merlin galleons on this thing, Luna, really. I should have been there to stop you.”</p><p>“I can't say that you're wrong, Draco, but… I do still think <em> I Want to Hold Your Hand </em> is really quite sweet.”</p><p>“Yes, focus-group approved. The empty saccharine pandering of capitalism. Insidious.” Malfoy tosses it on the floor. “Now this,” he says, thumping his first finger down on the spine of one still in the red plastic crate, “is music.” He sighs. “Aretha. No one like her.”</p><p>Luna laughs. She pulls another one up, low enough Harry can’t make out the cover even when he squints lopsidedly.</p><p>“Oh Luna. How could you show me this.”</p><p>“I know that it’s your favorite and that you’re too afraid to admit it, so I do love to taunt you with it.”</p><p>“Always so cruel. You’re a delight.”</p><p>Harry squints to catches a glimpse of the title from the shifting blur if the world, it’s almost certainly the soundtrack to <em> Mama Mia.</em> Or maybe Harry just wants it to be that. Either way, Malfoy shoves it back down into the cardboard box.</p><p>Harry feels like he's is in a fugue state.</p><p>The two of them continue to leaf through records and seem to be getting no closer to actually choosing. At some point, Malfoy says, “Luna, when <em> will </em> you let me shave your head,” to which she replies, “Leo isn’t in Sagittarius quite yet,” and Malfoy rolls his eyes.</p><p>“Wotcher, Harry?”</p><p>He jumps a little when Ron sits beside him — a delayed reaction. Ron has not gone home, Harry realizes slowly. His veins are slow with alcohol and confusion and some unplaceable feeling.</p><p>“Malfoy and Luna are friends now,” Harry says, stupidly.</p><p>“I can see that, mate.” Ron shakes his head. He says, like remarking on the weather, “Seems fucked, f’you ask me.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> At some point Harry gets tired of consciousness and having to puzzle through two hundred feelings at once. He gives in to the warmth and the alcohol-blur and he passes out on a pillow somewhere on the ground.</p><p>He dreams.</p><p>Of Sirius, this time. Harry watches as his godfather trudges up an unending set of stairs, flanked on either side by the trophies, the heads of house elves, and the painted scowls of dead vicious Black relatives.</p><p>Sirius is not alone in that house. Teddy Lupin, not yet one, and black-eyed, sits at the top of the stairs. The crown of his head is lit in a patch of dust-thick sunlight.</p><p>He claps his chubby hands 1-2, 1-2 as the lips of the house elves move together. <em>Cur-sed houses, cur-sed houses </em>— !</p><p>And Teddy laughs.</p><p>Harry wakes up panting. His forehead is wet and cold. It is very, very early morning.</p><p>He staggers to his feet to see the room flooded with pale hesitant light and bodies asleep beside one another, Cho curled up on the purple loveseat, Ron drooling on Hermione’s shoulder, Parvati by Lavender, Dean’s head on Seamus’s left thigh, his hand curled around his shin — </p><p>Malfoy, awake, returns Harry’s gaze.</p><p>Half of his face is bathed in pale light from the little round window window to the east. His back is rigid straight against the wall beside the slumped form of Luna, cocooned in a knit blanket at his side. His arms are wrapped tight around his chest.</p><p>Malfoy’s grey eyes follow Harry’s movement. They are alert but not sharp. They are worn. Exhausted. Afraid.</p><p>Harry has seen these same eyes, staring down at him at the manor as Malfoy stammered, <em> I don’t know, I couldn’t say for sure</em>.</p><p>Harry feels as if he should say something but he doesn’t know why or how or what. He doesn’t know what he already said in his sleep — <em>You mutter sometimes</em>, Ron had told him once, the morning after a bad one about Cedric, and he insisted on making Harry a big egg and sausage breakfast and treated Harry as if he were terminally ill the rest of the day. </p><p>There are no hints on Malfoy’s pointy drawn face or the translucent blue-purple skin below his eyes.</p><p>Harry realizes this is what he wants, this is why he’s being so stupid — he wants an answer. Why didn't he sleep last night, why is he friends with Luna, why did he turn again his father, and how has he wormed his way back into Harry’s life, and who gave him the right to do it?</p><p>Malfoy owes him this much. Surely.</p><p>They stare at one another. Harry’s head is fuzzy, unclear, pounding with the harbinger of a hangover, but his nerves hum. Harry feels for a second like he’s back in that restroom in sixth year.</p><p>His body responds, it readies itself to duck a hex.</p><p>But this time is different. Draco’s lips curl when he catches Harry’s hand inching toward his wand. Harry stops, lowers his hand, lets it hang at his side.</p><p>They’ve caught one another in a moment of vulnerability — again — and Harry doesn’t know what to do.</p><p>In the end, he settles for what he wishes he had done in sixth year. He turns. Walks away.</p><p>Malfoy lets him go without a word and Harry doesn’t look back.</p><p>Harry heads, ironically, to the bathroom. He grips the side of the sink and washes the sweat off his face and sits on the toilet and stays there skimming through <em> Unlikely Gnome Toe Uses</em>, a book he’s sure Xenophilius left beside the loo until he hears Hermione’s voice and knows someone else is awake.</p><p>They leave before breakfast at Harry’s urging and Hermione asks no questions, Ron offers no forced levity, and they drink hangover potions in the easy silence of family.</p><p>They are satisfied by his effort, at least. At least, for one night, he was enough.</p><p> </p>
