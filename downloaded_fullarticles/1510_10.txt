    <p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> Chapter 1:	Ponderings of a (Mad) Potter</p><p>Harry Potter, wasn’t stupid nor naive, despite what his ignorant relatives and the majority of Hogwarts thought, including his best friends, Ron and Hermione. Although, to be fair to Hermione, he suspected she was starting to put the clues together. </p><p>He wouldn’t have had survived his young life with the Dursleys, if so. He had simply learned to hide his intelligence after working out that any grades better than his pig in a wig cousin, Dudley, would get him a sound thrashing. He quickly learned as a young boy how to read the Dursleys often mercurial moods, either by body language or tone of voice, otherwise a smack to the head would be the least of his worries. He had early on in life learned to hide his feelings from his family and developed a façade of nonchalance. Merlin, knows that somehow the only intelligence the Dursley’s had ever shown was to lock onto him when he was feeling out of sorts.</p><p>Harry knew asking questions or just generally being underfoot when not completing the mile-long chore list his Aunt Petunia gave him, was a quick way to get stuffed in his cupboard without meals and caned. As such, he had soon learned that being out of the house, when not completing said chores was the ideal way not to die an early demise at the morbidly obese hands of his uncle and no, unfortunately, he wasn’t being dramatic. </p><p>Most that knew him would be shocked to find out that the library was where he could be found more often than naught. A place that Dudley and his band of budding psychopaths wouldn’t dare to trouble him. The library became a place of solace for him, a place where he didn’t have to pretend, and could just be.</p><p>It was here he truly grew up, in between the stacks of the Little Whinging Library, where he honed his intelligence and began learning the art of deductive reasoning via the readings of Sherlock Holmes, becoming more observant and perceptive day by day. He learned to quickly not limit his imagination, despite the Dursley’s stifling attempts to squash his intelligence, often trying to predict human behavior of the young college students whom were home on breaks. Harry often could get them to teach him a little something of what they were studying if he correctly piqued their curiosity. After all he had quite a wide variety of interests and he had long decided that any useful piece of knowledge would certainly help in the future.</p><p>Despite his fondness of Sherlock Holmes and the study of human nature around him, he found his true love in the dusty books featuring<br/>
myths of old, tales of fortune, adventure, and daring.   </p><p> He grew fascinated by the tales of ancient explorers, their quest for treasure, and of destinations far and wide. He promised himself that one day he would visit all the places in his books, once he was old enough and far away from the Dursleys. </p><p>The old librarian, Mrs. Stockton, at first wary of him since the Dursley would tell anyone who would listen about their hellion nephew they had graciously taken in out of the goodness of their hearts, soon grew fond of him due to his quiet demeanor and respect for books. She often told him to never lose the unquenchable thirst he seemed to have for knowledge nor his curiosity.</p><p>Thing is, he didn’t, that is to say, lose his thirst for knowledge or his curiosity. Why then did the majority of the wizarding world think he, Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived, was an average, if perhaps slightly above average jock at this magic shitick, you ask? Well it was quite simple really. When he had first found out about magic and rejoined the wizarding world he had a firm plan in mind. Seriously, he did, really! The plan was, he was going to quietly find out as much information as possible and blend in, until he understood his place in this new world. </p><p>Simple, right? </p><p>However, before he knew it he was being rushed up and down Diagon Alley by Hagrid, a remarkably large fellow, who while kind and had rescued him from the Dursley’s tender loving care, seemed particularly anal about what books he could and could not buy and what shops he went into. </p><p>Looking back that should have been a clue for his young self but to be fair he was too caught up, in well, the magic, of the situation to think of anything else.</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Finally, it was September 1st and the day he would leave for Hogwarts! Harry could hardly wait, he had diligently committed all of his books to memory and could not wait till he could start properly practicing magic.</p><p>Later after meeting the Weasley family on the muggle side of Charing Cross Station and learning how to cross the barrier of Platform 9 ¾, he wound up sharing a compartment on the Hogwarts Express with Ronald Weasley. A boy who he quickly deduced felt like he was constantly overshadowed by his large family and didn’t seem all that greatly academically inclined. None of that seemed to matter to him then though, because for the first time in his life he had a friend!</p><p>He would later go onto befriend Hermione Granger, whom was the exact opposite of Ron, in which she was an only child and a complete know it all. She also had a staggering i.e. unhealthy, amount of trust in anything she read in books and believed authority figures could do no wrong.</p><p> So, you see, it was just that his plan at some point had gotten completely away from him and before he knew it, a lifetime of carefully thought out actions to ensure his survival to adulthood had led him to somehow unwittingly create the facade of the quintessential Gryffindor; brave, brash, and more interested in quidditch than learning magic.</p><p>That isn’t to say he hadn’t been learning, not at all but instead of actually being able to try his best in classes now that he was free of Dudley’s perpetual mediocracy and the fists of Vernon Dursley, he once more had to hide his intelligence. Harry had taken to staying up many a night to sneak out of the dorms to take trips to the library. This feat made much simpler since receiving his father’s invisibility cloak the Christmas of his first year. </p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------_______________________________________</p><p>Harry, had long come to the realization that life simply wasn’t fair and if his first two years in the wizarding world and at Hogwarts had taught him anything, it was that no one was going to save him, so he would bloody well have to do that himself. Typical, really.</p><p> </p><p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
