    <p>Little Harrison Potter was born into the world with a scream. Yet it was not the wailing of a newborn that greeted him but the sheer terror of the midwife. For you see, little Harry was born with the words Avada Kadavra written in slicing silver down his spine. His father and mother cried when they saw his words, fervently hoping that their son would never meet his soul mate.</p>
<p> Not even two years later, the midwife had been killed. Harry’s parents murdered, and those foreboding words had turned as dark as the soul of the man to utter them. However, of all this Harry knew nothing. His aunt and uncle had spitefully told him that it was a mark of his freakiness. While his parents were drunken fools who died in an automobile accident. For you see muggles did not have enough magic within them to form soul marks. </p>
<p>So little Harry grew up hating those large bold black words written in a spiky hand adorning his spine. Grateful that they were easily hidden.</p>
<p>In his eleventh year everything changed for Harry. He was a wizard! He was famous. His parents were heroes! And on the first of September, a red headed boy changed his view of those spiky black words. </p>
<p>Harry was content to sit alone in the train car. While nervous for what was to come, he didn’t know enough of this new world to truly comprehend the enormous undertaking of what awaited him. </p>
<p>Ron Weasley was the first of many to enter his life. Ron burst into Harry’s carriage compartment, silver words adorning his smudged left hand, and started chatting about the wizarding world. Harry learned much in that first meeting.</p>
<p>Ron introduced him to the prejudices of the wizarding world, soul marks, and basic every day life. So Harry, content knowing that he was not alone saw his best friends get together with the words “oh your doing magic! Let's see it then” and “very well then”, and learned that it was considered improper to discuss the contents of one’s soul mark. Therefore, Harry lead a complicated life slaying basilisk’s and saving stones, but was blissfully ignorant of the significance of his dauntingly bold words until his fourth year Defense class. </p>
<p>That year burdened with the Triwizarding Tournament, isolated from his friends, and scared with the knowledge of who uttered his words and their meaning. Harry spent many restless and lonely nights researching soul mates, afraid of what his connection with Voldemort meant? Would he become a monster? Was he already one? </p>
<p>“Mr. Potter are you alright” Professor McGonagall asked, worried that her favorite student was crumbling under the pressure of the deadly Triwizarding Tournament. “You can always come to me with your problems you know that right?”</p>
<p>Harry gave a small smile. He knew he looked terrible. Ever since Professor Moody had demonstrated the Unforgivable curses in DADA three weeks ago he hadn't been sleeping well. Further exacerbated by his classmate’s frigid behaviors and skipped meals. It all haggard his already thin frame giving him an air of being deathly ill.</p>
<p>“Yes of course professor” he hesitated before adding “I know this is probably quite rude but… Have your words been spoken?”</p>
<p>The professor gave a large reminiscing smile “oh yes… It was many years ago and we have been happily married ever since.”</p>
<p>“Oh” Harry's voice had gone quite small “and… You never… doubted your words?” <br/>“Doubted? No I don't think anyone ever does. When I was your age my mother used to tell me stories about how her friends words turned out. Some were quite the tales”. McGonagall looked down at Harry arched her eyebrow and inquired “why are you worrying about this now? Shouldn't you be training for the Triwizarding Tournament?” </p>
<p>“Have you met her?” Then with a kind face if she's one of the Beuxbaton girls it's quite all right, I'm sure she will learn English and you French in a jiffy.”</p>
<p>A look of horror crossed Harry's face “no it's definitely not one of the Beauxbaton students”.<br/>“If it's one of the Durmstrang girls it's quite all right too you know. I'm sure she's not as cold as she seems, it's just an image.”</p>
<p>Once again Harry venomously denied her suspicion of who it might be, yet curiously did not deny that he had met them. For now, Professor McGonagall was thinking it just might be a boy. Looking at Harry objectively Professor McGonagall noticed that if he were a bit healthier he would be quite the beautiful boy, effeminate with his large stunning emerald eyes, petit frame and long dark crazy hair. </p>
<p>“Harry,” she started slowly “you do know that in the wizarding world we are quite open with sexuality” noticing his confusion she clarified “we accept gays. In fact, men can get pregnant.”! Harry intrigued but not liking the way the conversation was headed hurriedly ended it begging the need to study.</p>
<p>As the weeks passed by Professor McGonagall noticed that Harry’s health didn't seem to be improving at all, however she found herself swamped with work and before she realized it, the first task had arrived.</p>
