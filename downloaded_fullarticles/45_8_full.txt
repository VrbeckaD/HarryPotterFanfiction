The windows were a bit cracked, letting in a bit of the cool autumn air that she enjoyed, dancing between her curls.</p><p>They were even serving her favourite lunch today. Roast beef and potatoes on the side.</p><p>Nothing could ruin today.</p><p>Nothing could ever ruin such a—</p><p>“And that’s fifty points from Gryffindor,” drawled a sneering voice that could only belong to one person. “And I’m in a good mind to hex you with a week’s worth of being tongue tied.”</p><p>Draco Malfoy was standing in front of a terrified third-year Gryffindor student who was clutching his books to his chest. Malfoy, on the other hand, looked as cool as a cucumber, his eyes narrowed with malice and his lips pulled into a smirk.</p><p>“What the <em>hell</em> are you doing, Malfoy?” Hermione snapped, throwing her bag to the floor.</p><p>He looked at her, lowering his head a few centimeters, and she felt her blood flare with anger. It was such a patronizing gesture at how much taller he was than her that Hermione was in a mind to kick him in the shins.</p><p>“I’m performing my Head Boy duties.” His grey eyes were dripping with contempt and the malice was making way for his hatred for her to seep out. “Move along, Granger.”</p><p>Hermione glowered. “Fifty points? Hexing? Those are your Head Boy duties?”</p><p>He didn’t say anything, his stare never breaking.</p><p>Hermione nodded towards the third-year who was sweating bullets. “Go.”</p><p>He needn’t be told twice, picked up his bag and scampered away,</p><p>“<em>Locomoter Wibbly</em>,” Malfoy lazily said, pointing his wand at the student.</p><p>He gasped, immediately falling to the floor heavily, books falling everywhere as his legs were unable to hold him up.</p><p>“<em>Stop it</em>!” Hermione said furiously, pointing her wand and uttered the counter-jinx. “Leave!” She said to the student, and he didn’t even look back, catching his bag and books again and half-crawling, half-running into the next corridor.</p><p>“What the <em>fuck</em>?” she spat. “That is an abuse of power! What the hell is wrong with you? You are <em>at least</em> four years older than him! This is bullying. Let’s see Snape defend you with this. McGonagall will kill you.”</p><p>Malfoy’s smirk deepened. “Please, be my guest. We’ll see if your biased opinions of me will hold up when brought to McGonagall.”</p><p>Hermione snorted. “Um, have you not heard what I’ve just said? The fifty points and the hexing you just did in front of my eyes? Added to that the student is a Gryffindor, and we all know how you feel about us.”</p><p>Malfoy ran a hand through his hair. His robes shifted with the motion, his sweater pressed against his chest and Hermione commanded herself not to be distracted. She didn’t have the slightest idea if he knew about the thoughts that circled her mind during the dead of the night. Thoughts she never even uttered to herself.</p><p>That Draco Malfoy was the only person in this entire damn school who challenged her intellectually. That their unspoken battle of who gets the highest marks in their classes was something of a near thrill for her. That studying to beat him, to make him eat his words like crow, was a high she had always craved but only just discovered she did. That when they were paired up for that one Transfiguration homework, she couldn’t stop herself from watching the way his eyelashes, nearly colourless, were long, brushing against his cheeks. Those cheekbones of his that she wondered if were as sharp as his wit.</p><p>And not to mention, worst of all, the thought of that mouth of his hot against hers.</p><p>But those were dreams she attributed as nightmares.</p><p>Malfoy took a step forward towards her, and Hermione immediately went into defense mode, her hand flying to her wand and she pointed it directly under his chin.</p><p>“Stay back,” she snarled.</p><p>He lifted his chin, still smirking. “Would you believe me if I told you?”</p><p>Her brows furrowed with confusion. “I—”</p><p>“Think carefully, Granger,” he said, licking his lips, and Hermione’s traitorous gaze darted to them and back. “We could so very easily take this to the professors.”</p><p>She gripped her wand tightly. “Fine. Tell me.”</p><p>“Tsk, tsk,” he laughed, and a few blonde stray hairs fell across his eyes. “Would. You. <em>Believe</em>. Me?”</p><p>Hermione hated this. Here she was, <em>holding</em> her wand at him, and he acted as if he were the one with the upper hand.</p><p>But two could play at that game. There was always lying.</p><p>“Yes,” she replied tersely.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows as if he knew she meant the exact opposite. But even that was a lie. Hermione didn’t know whether she would believe him or not.</p><p>Malfoy nodded his head to the side. “Do you know where we are?”</p><p>She looked to where he was pointing. “The hallway by the second floor beside Charms class?”</p><p>“Very good,” he replied as if he were the teacher and she was a slow-learning student. “And what is also in this hallway?”</p><p>She racked her brains. A broom closet? A weird painting? Not the Room of Requirement because that was on the seventh floor.</p><p>Malfoy groaned. “Smartest girl in our class doesn’t really know everything, does she?” And before she could spit out a retort, he continued, “The girls’ bathroom. There’s a girls bathroom right from where I caught your brave Gryffindor.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widened and she lowered her wand with shock.</p><p>“He was peeping,” he said and took out his wand before swishing it at the wall where a small hole was revealed. “So much for honor and chivalry.”</p><p>“I—” Hermione began, but she had no idea what to say. He wasn’t lying. The hole was right there.</p><p>“How does it feel to know your house isn’t as decent as you thought it to be?” Malfoy said smugly.</p><p>Her eyes whipped back to him, temper snapping. “One bad person doesn’t immediately villain-fy the whole people.”</p><p>His lips parted open in triumph, and Hermione realized what she had said.</p><p>“But that doesn’t include <em>you</em>,” she said darkly. “You’re a bully and you hate Muggleborns. Not to mention the personal vendetta you have against Gryffindors. One incident of decency isn’t enough to erase all that.”</p><p>His sneer disappeared with each word she said until all that was left was anger. He closed the distance between them.</p><p>“Bully?” he repeated. “<em>Bully</em>?”</p><p>His eyes were made of storms, but Hermione wasn’t backing down.</p><p>“You always have the higher moral ground, don’t you, Granger?” he snapped. “Gryffindors keeping the bad Slytherins away. You, who could never do no harm. Break the rules as much as you want, and you get away with it thanks to Dumbledore. Don’t you dare preach from your pedestal when you only listen to one side of the story. Do you know how many first-year students I had to console after they were booed once the Sorting Hat placed them in Slytherin? Booed by <em>your</em> Gryffindors? By the <em>whole</em> school! You’ve painted us the enemy before we had a chance to even speak a word in our defense! So, get off your high broomstick, Granger!”</p><p>Hermione’s heart beat against her ribs in a painful way.</p><p>“I don’t have a problem with Slytherins,” she said in a low voice. “I have a problem with you.”</p><p>Malfoy snorted, turning away from her. “Sure, Granger.”</p><p>Her patience broke and she yanked his shoulder back. His eyes widened with surprise before catching the fury in her expression.</p><p>“<em>Mudblood</em>,” she hissed, pushing her hands against his chest until he was backed against the wall. “You’ve called me Mudblood over and over again. You’ve made fun of my teeth and jeered whenever Snape put me down. You’ve taken every chance you got to put my friends and I in trouble. You worked with <em>Umbridge</em>. When she was the <em>whole</em> school’s enemy. Your family’s drenched with the blood Voldemort spilled when he reigned. <em>You</em> didn’t let us be friends. <em>You</em> were the one who made me doubt whether I belonged at Hogwarts. I, who came from no magic. How was I supposed to know and untangle the intricate web of horrors and politics as an eleven-year old?”</p><p>Malfoy swallowed hard, his jaw clenched, a certain something flickering behind his eyes.</p><p>“So,” he said in a low voice after a few minutes of them staring into the other’s eyes. “We’ve both burned a bridge before it was built.”</p><p>His gaze dropped to her lips, lingering there for longer than they should.</p><p>And the next second, Hermione didn’t know how, her lips were crashed against his.</p><p>The kiss was something out of a deep dream she once had. One that she still felt the aftermaths of when she woke up, heart hammering, drenched in sweat.</p><p>His arms encircled around her, holding her closer to his body before turning her around so she was the one pressed to the wall.</p><p>Hermione gasped as Malfoy’s kisses turned deeper and rougher, his hands grasping at the sides of her neck. He dragged each kiss until she felt it beginning from her lips and ending at her tiptoes. Until she was desperately clinging to his jumper before sneaking her hands under it, coming in contact with his skin. He sighed in her mouth, and a thrill shot through her like firewhisky.</p><p>Malfoy broke away from her lips but didn’t stop. Rather, he scattered kisses and love bites along her jawline before dropping to her neck where he sucked, almost cruelly.</p><p>Hermione’s knees buckled, and she withdrew her hands away from exploring his chest, all the hard ridges of it, to hold on to his shoulders. He was invoking magic with the way his kisses were making her head lose all the train of thoughts. With the way she was curling her toes and tilting her head to the side so he could kiss even more.</p><p>But there was one thought still in her mind.</p><p>Hermione Granger, rational as always, even with Draco Malfoy’s hand trying to sneak under her shirt, knew they should not be doing this.</p><p>Not here.</p><p>“Stop,” she murmured weakly, thinking he wouldn’t hear her. But he did, and he sprang back three feet away, leaving her clothes rumpled, and body yearning for his touch.</p><p>His pale face was flushed, his lips redder than they ever have been, and his chest was heaving with each breath he took.</p><p>He inhaled deeply. “Granger, I’m sorry. I—I don’t know what got into me. Just—”</p><p>“Shut up,” she interrupted, banging her head lightly against the wall. “I’m trying to <em>think</em>.”</p><p>Her thoughts were as weightless as clouds.</p><p>Not here. They should not be doing this in the corridors. Where anyone could walk by. Even the ghosts would talk.</p><p>“Not here,” she said after a while.</p><p>He looked at her, confused, which only deepened when she picked up her schoolbag and grabbed his hand, dragging him along with her.</p><p>“Wha—” he cleared his throat. “Where are we going?”</p><p>“Prefect’s Common Room,” she said, looking ahead. “We can’t go back to yours nor mine. The Prefect’s one would be empty now. Besides there are multiple beds there and a few spells uttered and we’d have our privacy.”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t believe the words she was saying. But this has been a buildup of sexual tension since she slapped him during their third year, and it was all coming out now. Every part of her wanted him. No. <em>Needed</em> him.</p><p>When he didn’t say anything, she glanced back. “Are <em>you</em> okay with that?”</p><p>“<em>Ye</em>—” his voice broke and he nodded instead. </p><p>He was looking absolutely befuddled, his usually perfect hair sticking from all edges.</p><p>It’s a good look on him, Hermione mused.</p><p>The Prefect’s Common Room was situated on the fifth floor. Three floors up. And it was the longest walk Hermione had ever taken in her life. Especially with Malfoy’s hand in hers. They nearly ran into a group of fifth-year Ravenclaws before he tugged her behind a statue of a fox. But other than that, they encountered no one.</p><p>Soon enough, they were both breathing heavily, their palms sweating and standing in front of the Prefect’s Common Room where the painting of a woman dressed in furs and a top hat raised an eyebrow at them.</p><p>“Password?” she asked sultry.</p><p>“Cinnamon cakes,” they said in unison before looking at each other and glancing away just as quickly.</p><p>The door opened, and Hermione was pleased to find that she was right. The common room <em>was</em> empty. It was 1:30 pm on a Wednesday. Everyone was either outside, enjoying the scarce, warm sun or in the Great Hall shoveling food in their mouths.</p><p>Hermione had always liked the Prefect’s Common Room. It was quieter than the Gryffindor’s and second best only to the library. Here, she could sit reading for hours, looking out into the Great Lake and the mountains that covered the horizon. No one would bother her here. Certainly not Harry and Ron’s dumbassery.</p><p>The couches were the softest ones she ever sat on and there were places to sit by the large windows. A fireplace crackled quietly in the corner, the flames licking at a set of fresh logs. The colours of all four houses were draped from the ceiling showing unity, and there was a wide bookshelf that was stocked courtesy of her. And Malfoy.</p><p>On the other side, a small corridor lead to the various beds and couches Prefects and the Head Boys and Girls could use for some peace. Each one looked like a small room and the bed was wide enough to accommodate two people comfortably with a curtain for privacy. Hermione didn’t know if the students themselves had arranged it to be so or if the beds were like that from the start.</p><p>She turned towards Malfoy and almost jumped when she saw that he was staring at her.</p><p>“No one’s here,” she said haughtily. “I was right.”</p><p>He rolled his eyes.</p><p>“There’s a bed towards the end there. I use it sometimes to nap when there are parties in our common room,” she said, pulling him towards it. “It overlooks the Great Lake at a place where the sun sets and I—”</p><p>She stopped, her cheeks going pink, and when she looked at him, prepared to defend herself against any insults he’d throw at her, she saw that his expression was full of surprise.</p><p>“Never mind,” she muttered.</p><p>“No,” he said, one of the corners of his mouth lifting. It looked almost… endearing.</p><p>Hermione banished the thought from her mind immediately. This wasn’t something where feelings were going to be involved. This was an itch she was going to scratch. Nothing less. Nothing more.</p><p>The bed was covered in a white sheet and multiple throw pillows strewn over it. Hermione imagined Malfoy’s weight on top of her, sinking her into the soft mattress and she didn’t have to wonder for long when he spun her around and kissed her.</p><p>Her schoolbag fell to the ground and she toppled on the bed with him over her. Her hands busying around his necktie, pulling it off and him tugging on her shirt.</p><p>He had the presence of mind to break away from her lips and point his wand at the corridor.</p><p>“<em>Muffliato</em>,” he murmured before closing the curtain on them.</p><p>“Smart thinking,” she said, turning his face back to hers.</p><p>The red on his cheeks was mesmerizing but not as mesmerizing as the colour of his eyes. They looked like the sea after a storm. Like the sky in a frosty winter morning.</p><p>“One of us has to keep their wits about,” he said, smirking.</p><p>He swallowed her retort in a kiss, and she could almost laugh at how incredible it was that she could be so quickly pacified. By <em>Draco Malfoy’s lips</em>.</p><p>He explored the inside of her mouth with his tongue, lightly sucking on her lower lip and Hermione saw stars burst behind her eyes. This was better than anything she had ever felt in her life. Better than any kiss she experienced with Viktor Krum and others. But then again, she was just a fourteen-year-old girl back then with zero experiences. Now, seventeen-years-old and she had had a few shares of kisses. And she could safely say, from all the research she had conducted, Draco Malfoy knew how to kiss, and he knew how to kiss <em>well</em>.</p><p>His tie was on the floor, and soon enough, his jumper joined it, leaving him in his white shirt.</p><p>Hermione grumbled, pushing him off her and attacked the buttons on his shirt.</p><p>“Why are you wearing so many clothes?” she complained. “Today’s warm.”</p><p>Malfoy laughed. “I get cold. Easily.”</p><p>She blinked, her mind running through a list of what the cause could be. <em>Anemia, for one</em>, she thought. And she wouldn’t put it past him, seeing how pale he was.</p><p>But pale did not mean weak. Not in his vocabulary anyway.</p><p>He was still the Slytherin’s seeker, and his physique proved it just.</p><p>He looked like a Michelangelo sculpture come alive, and her eyes studied what her fingers felt when she was pressed against the wall. But now she could see the scars where Harry’s <em>Sectumsempra </em>slashed through him and she traced her fingers over them. They were entwined over his arms to his chest and one was licking at his neck.</p><p>When she glanced back up at his eyes, she saw suppressed mirth and cockiness. “Like what you see, Granger?”</p><p>She bit her tongue. “Are we going to talk or are we going to fuck?”</p><p>He startled, and then shook his head. “Are you feeding some sort of sick fantasy? Getting high over sleeping with your enemy?”</p><p>“Then why are <em>you</em> here?” she fired back. “You want this as much as I do.” She glanced down between them. “Or else you could take care of <em>that</em> by yourself.”</p><p>He clenched his jaw with annoyance before reaching up to tuck a curl of her hair behind her ear. The gesture was opposite to the expression on his face which only made Hermione feel more confused.</p><p>Then the look changed to that of a secret one and he leaned forward, planting his arms on either side of her, a slow grin tickling his lips. She fell back against the pillow, her heart thundering.</p><p>“If you want to fuck, Granger,” he said smoothly, his tone dropping a few octaves. “Then we’ll fuck.”</p><p>The words died in her throat when he pressed his lips against hers in a slow kiss, and his hands pulled at her tie and then shirt.</p><p>“Up,” he hummed against her mouth and she obliged. He threw it to the side and leaned back on his knees to take her in where she lay under him, wearing only her purple bra and school skirt.</p><p>“How many boys and girls are in this school who would only dream of having the illustrious Hermione Granger half-naked and looking so helpless under their touch?” he murmured.</p><p>“I’m not helpless,” she snarled, and the bed rumbled and creaked. “I beat you in wandless magic, don’t you forget that.”</p><p>“So you did.” He smirked and pressed his lips to the side of her neck where his hands started unhooking the clasps of her bra, his fingers skimming over her like a ghost of a touch. “Don’t kill me for doing this.”</p><p>Hermione squeezed her eyes shut and she felt the cool attack of air around her when the bra fell off the bed. She didn’t open her eyes even when she felt the burn of his stare on her chest. Not even when his hand enclosed around one of her breasts and she fisted the blanket. Not even then. Not even when, after a few seconds, he reached down and took it in his mouth.</p><p>She gasped, and his tongue teased her. Still she refused to open her eyes.</p><p>“Why are your eyes closed?” she heard him ask against her ear. “What are you so afraid from, Granger?”</p><p><em>You</em>, she wanted to say. <em>I don’t want to look at you and see the way you stare at me</em>.</p><p>But instead, she deadpanned, “I read an article that said the absence of one sense raises the intensity of others.”</p><p>He stilled on top of her for a few seconds before she felt his body shake with laughter that spilled out of his mouth.</p><p>“An article?” he repeated. “Fuck the article. Open your eyes.”</p><p>She shook her head. “Thank you, I’m quite all right here.”</p><p>He brushed his nose against hers. “Look at me,” he whispered and she heard him over the beat of her heart.  </p><p>Hermione swallowed hard and raised her arms to cover herself. From the chill, from him. She didn’t know.</p><p>His fingers brushed over her cheek. “What’s happening, Granger? Do you want to stop?”</p><p>She shook her head again.</p><p>“Then?”</p><p>She reached up blindly, making out the direction where his voice was coming from before clumsily cupping his cheeks between her hands and kissing him.</p><p>“You said we’ll fuck, we’re not fucking. Unless we have different meanings to it.”</p><p>She knew he was giving her a disbelieving look.</p><p>“Fine,” he said with a hint of finality. “Suit yourself.”</p><p>He went back to kissing her, and she went back to feeling and discovering every inch of him. His trousers were still on him, and that was something Hermione didn’t like, and so while he busied himself with her lips, she trailed her hands down until she slipped them under and touched him.</p><p>He gasped, a shudder running through his muscles, and she touched him once more, wanting to hear that sound from him again.</p><p>“Granger,” he choked out. “What are you doing?”</p><p>She smiled and lightly trailed her fingers along the length of him.</p><p>He moaned.</p><p>Draco Malfoy, pompous brat and the son of one of the elites, moaned because of her, Hermione Granger.</p><p>Now that was a sight she had to see.</p><p>She opened her eyes slowly only to see that his were closed, his face wholly unguarded. His signature smirk was gone, his lips slightly parted open, his hair falling over his eyes and there was none of the hate that soured his expression. He looked young. A boy of seventeen who was in bed with a girl.</p><p>And Hermione had to remind herself of all the reasons she hated Draco Malfoy.</p><p>She didn’t want to think about how he stopped calling Mudblood at the start of last year. That when one Slytherin did, Malfoy’s face looked like a storm. That when they both became Head Boy and Girl, they were finding less reasons to hate each other and more to become rivals. That she knew the reason Gryffindor won the last Quidditch match was because he kept looking at her and missed the snitch that was hovering right beside his head. That he was unearthing all the prejudice that had been planted in him since he was brought into this world, and even though it was messy and he relapsed at times, he was still moving forward. She didn’t want to think of Draco Malfoy changing and becoming better because that would mean she’d see him in a different light.</p><p>And then she remembered the way his eyes flickered with a certain emotion after she yelled at him.</p><p>It was regret.</p><p>An intense storm of regret eating away at his soul and Hermione realized that he didn’t feel himself worthy of forgiveness. Not even if he were to change every single cell in him.</p><p>“Hey,” she murmured, and he fluttered his eyes open.</p><p>He looked like he was in pain.</p><p>She removed her hand and he involuntarily groaned in protest.</p><p>“I’m still wearing my skirt,” she whispered.</p><p>The haze of pain cleared and his mischievousness jumped back out.</p><p>“We can’t have that now.” He pressed a long kiss to her lips. “And you’re looking at me.”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t explain why those five words hurt her heart in an achy kind of way.</p><p>He slid down, hooked his fingers in her waist and, in one motion, dragged it along with her undies, and they were thrown on the floor.</p><p>She was naked with Draco Malfoy studying every single curve and edge of her with his grey eyes. His mouth was dropped open, and it took every ounce of self-control for her not to grab the blanket and cover herself.</p><p>Instead, she watched him watch her, her arms raised above her head. His gaze trailed slowly from her legs to her thighs to her stomach and breasts above to her neck and finally her face and dark brown hair that was draped over the pillow.  </p><p>“You’re beautiful,” he breathed and immediately looked shocked with himself. </p><p>She was on fire. She knew she was. Because how else could she explain the rise in her body temperature that was about to reduce her to ash.</p><p>“If you don’t start fucking me, I’m going to scream,” she said and the intensity in the air lifted.</p><p>“I’m going to touch you first,” he replied, stretching himself beside her on the bed, his long fingers dancing along her ribcage and further down to between her thighs.</p><p>Hermione gasped but his mouth had already covered hers. He kissed her cries, taking them in his mouth as his fingers teased and stroked until she was constricting her legs and squirming under his touch. Her hands clawed at his back, dragging her nails deeply until she was sure she must have drawn blood. There was too much happening all at once, and all she wanted was to feel even more.</p><p>He was holding her on the edge, not letting her fall when she realized he was doing it intentionally.</p><p>“Malfoy,” she growled and flicked her wrist and he gasped, turning his head to the side before laughing.</p><p>“Did you just make the air slap me?”</p><p>She dug her nails in his forearms. “Faster.”</p><p>“You could have asked nice—<em>Ouch</em>! Fine!”</p><p>He sped up and she fell apart within minutes in hot, throaty gasps.</p><p>Every single muscle in her was as soft as a feather, ecstasy running through her veins. She glanced out of the window, watching the tufts of clouds and the snowy cap mountains, her mind, for the first time in weeks, feeling peaceful.</p><p>But still, she didn’t have him yet. Her body wasn’t satisfied with just his fingers. Not to mention her soul.</p><p>She turned towards him where he was propped on one hand while the other was drawing circles on her stomach to catch him staring at her, but he didn’t flinch. Didn’t look away.</p><p>“Weasely ever do this to you?” he asked, and Hermione groaned.</p><p>“Jealous?”</p><p>Malfoy snorted and rolled his eyes. “Yes, I’m very jealous of him, his stupidity and poverty. Honest, Granger, you couldn’t think of a smarter comeback?”</p><p>“I meant jealous that I would have done things with him.”</p><p>His sneer slipped.</p><p><em>Bingo</em>, she thought.</p><p>Malfoy looked beside them on the cover, his palm heavy on her stomach.</p><p>“Did you?” he asked, his voice low, refusing to look up.</p><p>“That’s my business.”</p><p>He bit his lip and then nodded. “That was out of line.”</p><p>“And still you’re talking and not”—she mimicked a rude gesture— “me.”</p><p>He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“I’m beginning to feel you’re all talk and no action,” she said, goading him. “What are you hiding in your trousers, Malfoy? A twig?”</p><p>His face crinkled with annoyance. “It is not a twig.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know that, do I?”</p><p>His palm splayed on her stomach slipped down to her waist and he tightened his hold.</p><p>“Oh, we’re fucking,” he said in a low voice. “I’m going to have you begging me for mercy. Yes, that’s something I’d like to hear from your lips. Hermione Granger asking Draco Malfoy to fuck her harder.”</p><p>Before she could protest, he kissed her and her body immediately began to respond. Her nerve cells awakened, each one on edge, waiting, waiting, waiting.</p><p>He kissed his way down to her throat and up to her ear where he lightly bit at the soft part of it.</p><p>“Have you?” she gasped when his teeth left a bruise on the side of her neck and she knew she’d have to wear a turtleneck tomorrow.</p><p>“Have I what?” he hummed along her collarbones, swinging his body over, and he was straddling her.</p><p>“Stuff. T-things,” she managed to say when his mouth found her breasts again. “With Pansy.”</p><p>He pressed a kiss in between her breasts and kneeled back up with a knowing smirk. His hair was a chaos of white-blonde waves sticking from all sides and her eyes trailed over down his chest to his Adonis belt that disappeared inside his trousers. He followed her gaze, and without skipping a beat, pulled them down, throwing them to the other side.</p><p>Her eyes widened and her mouth went dry.</p><p><em>Not a twig</em>, she thought to herself. <em>Not a twig at all</em>.</p><p>“Shut up,” she said before he could gloat at the look on her face.</p><p>He only smiled and leaned over her, his body covering hers and Hermione hummed with content. She kissed him, her tongue swiping over his, and felt his response against her thigh. Her hands, now free to touch every part, were brushing all over him. Over the strong muscles on his back and down to his Adonis belt.</p><p>The more she touched him all over, the more labored his breaths became, especially when her chest rubbed against his. He slipped his hand between them, making sure she was just as out of breath as he was.</p><p>Hermione gasped, her teeth sinking into the spot that joined his neck and shoulder.</p><p>“So you did,” she managed to say and he looked down at her.</p><p>“Does it bother you?” he whispered.</p><p>She chewed the inside of her cheek. “No.”</p><p>He grinned, curling one finger in her and she almost cried out. “You’re a liar,” he murmured.</p><p>Kneeling between her, Malfoy grabbed each side of her legs, and pulled her closer, teasing her, and she groaned.</p><p>“Tell me the truth, Granger,” he said softly. “Does it bother you what I did before with other girls? Have you dreamt about this moment? Me fucking you? Have you dreamt it on this bed?”</p><p>She gritted her teeth and tried to push into him, but he held her steady.</p><p>“If I’ve dreamt about it,” she whispered, “then so have you.”</p><p>He gripped her thighs tighter. “Then we both admit to this.”</p><p>She held his gaze for a few seconds. His eyes spoke multitudes of words, his tongue would never say.</p><p>“Yes,” she whispered, and a pin dropping would be deafening.</p><p>He nodded slowly before pushing into her and Hermione cried out. Pain, she had expected but it didn’t stop her from wincing, fisting the blankets. It was raw, almost blinding.</p><p>Malfoy shuddered, his eyes screwed shut with concentration, and his breaths were so throaty and deep that she thought he was about to collapse.</p><p>“That is,” she gasped, “if you don’t mind that I’ve never done this before.”</p><p>Malfoy froze, his grasp almost slipping. “<em>What</em>?”</p><p>“I’ve never had sex,” she repeated, staring at the ceiling before glancing at him.</p><p>He looked speechless, completely forgetting he was halfway inside her. “What—what about—”</p><p>She shook her head. “It never escalated beyond second base. It didn’t feel right. None of it felt right.”</p><p>She wrapped her legs around him and he slid in an inch. “Do it.”</p><p>“Merlin’s beard, Granger!” he finally exclaimed. “You could have warned me, and here I thought—”</p><p>She pressed her mouth into a thin line. The pain was there, and if he didn’t move, she was going to kill him.</p><p>“Do it,” she repeated, almost growled. “<em>Move</em>.”</p><p>“I’m hurting you,” he said, and when she didn’t say anything he repeated, “I am, aren’t I?”</p><p>“Because you’re not fucking moving!”</p><p>Still he didn’t. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p>“Why do you think, you dolt?”</p><p>He considered her for a second. “You thought I wouldn’t sleep with you… no… that’s not it… that I’d tease you about it.”</p><p>She closed her eyes.</p><p>“Then why tell me now?”</p><p>She swallowed hard. “I don’t know.”</p><p>But he still didn’t ask the question she didn’t want him to. Her chin trembled and she shook her head slightly.</p><p>
  <em>Why me?</em>
</p><p>He caught on, shuddering out a breath and, <em>finally</em>, moved. She gasped with each stroke he took, pushing deeper and nearly bolted up when his fingers came between them.</p><p>“You need to be more turned on,” he murmured. “Wetter.”</p><p>Whatever he was doing, it was working, and the pain was receding, merging into something more intense. A buildup of a pleasure she had long wanted—<em>craved</em>—from him.</p><p>When her moans rang loud, he stretched over her to kiss her, and he pushed even deeper until Hermione didn’t know if such a feeling of completeness existed or she was hallucinating it.</p><p>Their kisses turned sloppy, teeth scraping over lips.</p><p>“Am I hurting you?” he managed to say.</p><p>Hermione looked up at him, at the way his hair was plastered to his forehead, a sheen of sweat gleaming. His eyes had taken a dark grey colour, and when she squinted, she could see the blue in them. He was breathtaking in the way his cheeks were flushed with the exertion of fucking her.</p><p>She brushed his hair back, sliding her hands to clasp at his cheek.</p><p>“No,” she murmured.</p><p>“Can you take it?” he whispered.</p><p>She looked at him, confused.</p><p>“Me fucking you,” he said with a glint in his eyes.</p><p>“Isn’t that what you’re doing?”</p><p>He grinned. “Are you begging me?”</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. “No?”</p><p>“Then we’re not fucking yet.”</p><p>
  <em>Oh, if it’s a challenge he wanted, then it’s a challenge he’ll get. </em>
</p><p>“Go for it, ferret boy.”</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>“Just because I’m new to this,” she whispered, “doesn’t mean I’m not a fast learner. Or that I won’t turn the tables on you.”</p><p>He looked at her with wonderment before kissing her deeply. “This… <em>this</em>.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Your brilliance.”</p><p>Before she could splutter out in surprise, he pulled back, nearly all the way out, and her body instantly began to protest. But it didn’t have to for long, because he thrust against her again, and Hermione gasped.</p><p>He grabbed both of her hands in one grasp and pressed them over her head while supporting himself on the other. His lips kissed hers, tugged at her lower lip teasingly. His every thrust was slow, dragging the life out of her before injecting it back in.</p><p>He kept at this agonizing pace until there was nothing but a fire in her belly that only grew stronger and wilder. She was soon crying out and his grip tightened around her wrists in a way that Hermione knew they’d leave burn marks, but she didn’t care.</p><p>“How are you not—” she said before the last word died in her throat when he thrust deep in her.</p><p>“Spite,” he murmured but Hermione could read something entirely else on his face. He was minutes, if not seconds, from losing control. The sweat trickling down his cheeks were a dead giveaway for one. Not to mention how throaty his own breaths were.</p><p>And that gave her an idea.</p><p>She wiggled her wrists of his grasp and he let go before she slipped one hand between them, touching him and he tensed.</p><p>“Granger,” he growled.</p><p>“I thought spite was helping you?” she said sweetly, feigning innocence.</p><p>“You can be truly insufferable at times,” he said but there was no malice in his tone.</p><p>He took her hands again, pinned them on either side of her head and kissed her nose.</p><p>“I’m doing this for you, Granger,” he said. “I can easily fuck you and come within seconds, leaving you high and dry. But I want you to know that pleasure. Know it by <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart nearly leaped out of her chest and jumped from the window beside them.</p><p>His gaze was easy, the smile on his lips lazy and arrogant but she knew now it was a façade. She could read the worry underlying that smile of his. If he didn’t fuck her to completion, he would have lost. If he didn’t have her screaming his name, then what was the point of all of this? If he didn’t make her first time one that would have her sated for weeks to come, then he had no right to want her.</p><p>“Well, then,” she said.</p><p>“Good,” he murmured, satisfied. </p><p>He began slow again. So slow, she thought he wasn’t moving. But soon the fire was rekindled in her stomach and his kisses stoked it even more. He left his kisses along her neck, collarbones before taking her breast in his mouth again.</p><p>She cried out then, and he let go of her hands so she could wrap them around his neck, in his hair, pulling him closer. All the while, his thrusts didn’t stop. Building up and up until she was stretching her neck, blindly staring at the ceiling.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>!” she gasped when the fire began to coil in her stomach.</p><p>Suddenly, she heard voices that weren’t hers and Malfoy’s gasps and heavy breaths. Malfoy stopped, his eyes growing as wide as she knew hers were.</p><p>“<em>Shit</em>,” she exclaimed.</p><p>“It’s okay,” he said. “I used <em>Muffliatio</em>.”</p><p>“They’ll still know there’s someone here,” she hissed. “They’re not dumb.”</p><p>His nervousness dissolved to a wicked smile and he rocked against her, spiking a pleasure in her blood. She clamped her mouth shut but the moan still slipped out.</p><p>“Don’t—”</p><p>The voices came closer, and Malfoy only pushed in deeper. She shuddered when another wave of pleasure rippled against her</p><p>She couldn’t help it, she moaned louder and Malfoy immediately pressed his palm on her mouth. Her fingers scraped on his chest, toes curling.</p><p>“Is someone here?” someone asked, and Hermione couldn’t for the life of her put a name to a face or anything.</p><p>Malfoy flicked his wrist and called out, “It’s me. Taking a nap.”</p><p>Another thrust, and Hermione bit down on his fingers, but he didn’t wince. There was nothing but the thrill of having Hermione Granger under his mercy. How he was able to keep calm and cool with no strain in his voice as if he were just writing down an essay instead of being inside her, she didn’t know.</p><p>“Oh,” the voice said. The person, whoever they were, were just a few feet from behind the curtain. “All ri—wait, are you sleeping <em>naked</em>?”</p><p>Malfoy gave Hermione a wink. “I didn’t say I was napping alone.”</p><p>Her expression turned murderous, but she couldn’t say anything with his hand on her mouth and him meticulously grinding against her.</p><p>“Ew, gross.”</p><p>The voice faded away, and he finally removed his hand.</p><p>“<em>Fuck you</em>,” she spat.</p><p>“You already are.” He smirked.</p><p>She banged her fist against his broad chest. “I <em>hate</em> you.”</p><p>“<em>Aw</em>, I hate you too.”</p><p>She was still furious. If anyone were to catch them, catastrophe would befall. She wouldn’t hear the end of it, especially from the Gryffindors. They’d brand her a traitor, whereas Malfoy would be a hero by his peers. That he was able to take <em>the</em> Hermione Granger to bed and make her scream his name. They’d make jokes and songs and torment her until she landed herself in detention by doing something reckless, like cursing them. Hermione didn’t know if she’d find support from her friends. Maybe, Luna, but then again, Luna was a sweetheart to everyone.</p><p>This was a bad idea. What was she <em>thinking</em>? What proof did she have that he wouldn’t run out of here as soon as they were done and broadcast it to the entire school? That he’d send a Howler to Harry and Ron, detailing each freckle on her body and how she looked when he was inside her. What if all those times she thought he was becoming better were nothing more than her seeing what she wanted to see?</p><p>This was a <em>very</em> bad idea.</p><p>The thoughts turned even more vicious and her eyes pricked with tears, the hollow feeling in her stomach now feeling like a void, and her hands began to tremble against his chest.</p><p>He noticed the change in her, his eyes going wide with shock. “Granger, are you <em>crying</em>?”</p><p>She pressed a hand against her mouth because she knew if she tried to talk, she’d immediately cry. A hiccup escaped.</p><p>He stopped, and the next second, he slipped out of her. She winced despite herself, the nerves in her stomach tightening with a newfound fear.</p><p>She was stupid. <em>So</em> stupid. Guided only by what her lust-filled brain wanted. And now she went and gave her first time to someone who was her enemy.</p><p>Hermione was about to twist away, take her clothes and run to another bed to hide forever when he gathered her in his arms, holding her close to him.</p><p>That alone stopped the tears.</p><p>He tucked his face in the crook of her neck, his arms around her waist. “I’m sorry,” he said, his voice muffled. “I shouldn’t have done that. I just thought the thrill would be a turn on to you.”</p><p>Her arms were weak, and she was unable to wrap them around him.</p><p>“What happens here, stays here,” he continued, and she didn’t even have to act surprised that he knew exactly what was in her mind. His eyes caught more than he let on. “If you want to stop, we’re stopping right now. But if we continue, I swear to you, it dies with me. I’m not going to be standing on top of the Slytherin table in the Great Hall dancing a jig to it for the world to see.”</p><p>The image conjured in her mind of Malfoy performing a jig made her snort, and he leaned back to wipe her tears with his thumbs. He smiled.</p><p>“I’ll swear a Blood Oath,” he said. “I’ll tell you an embarrassing secret of mine as leverage.”</p><p>Her heart was getting lighter, and she blubbered out a laugh.</p><p>“It’s fine,” she said, taking a deep breath. “I could always turn it around and say how you bleated like a sheep when you came and that you loved to be called tulip to stay hard. I’m a <em>very</em> convincing storyteller.”</p><p>He bit his lower lip and then burst out laughing, the sound of it echoing over the ceiling, and his whole body shook. Hermione couldn’t help grinning. He looked so carefree. More than she had ever seen him in her life.</p><p>“All right,” he said after a while, wiping a tear from his eye.</p><p>He moved to get off the bed and she frowned, catching his arm. “Where are you going?”</p><p>He looked back at her. “I thought you wanted to stop.”</p><p>“Did I say that?”</p><p>He looked bewildered. “You were crying?”</p><p>“A very rational freak-out! Freak-out averted. Now, come back here and fuck me.”</p><p>She laid back on the bed, extending her arms over her head, and his gaze followed the way her chest moved.</p><p>“Hermione, we—” he stopped, and the breath was knocked out of her.</p><p>“Granger,” he corrected, hastily. “Trust me, no one wants this more than I do. God, I want it so bad. Do you know how long I have been dreaming about you? Years. Literal, years. This”—he gestured at her—“is <em>everything</em> I ever wanted.”</p><p>She turned to her side, moving closer to him and her hair fell over one shoulder. How did he know how to say these words? The raw emotion on his expression was too truthful for them to be lies.</p><p>“It’s what I want as well,” she whispered. “Truly.”</p><p>He swallowed hard, and Hermione slowly laced her fingers through his, admiring the difference in their skin. His deathly-pale white against her warm tanned one. She wondered if he burned in the sun. Like a vampire.</p><p>“If I want it, it doesn’t mean I’m soft for you now,” he said and looked up at her. Something flickered behind his stormy eyes. “I’m not in love with you. I just need to—”</p><p>“Get this out of your system, I know,” she finished the sentence for him. “I couldn’t have put it better myself.”</p><p>He regarded her silently, assessing the way her eyebrows were raised in defiance, daring him to contradict her.</p><p>“All right then,” he said and climbed back on top of her slowly. Every part of her screamed with elation and anticipation.</p><p>“<em>Muffliato</em>,” she murmured as he skimmed his nose along her cheekbones softly, one hand inching up her thigh until he reached his goal and dove two fingers in.</p><p>She gasped, closing her thighs on instinct but he parted them open again.</p><p>“You’re still wet,” he noticed, pleased. “Tell me, Granger, deep down, you enjoyed the thrill of being discovered, didn’t you?”</p><p>Thoughts… what were thoughts when he was touching her like that. How could she even move her mouth?</p><p>He flicked one finger and she moaned. “Tell me.”</p><p>She nodded. Knowing now he’d keep his mouth shut once they were done, she did like the thrill of it.</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>His fingers sped up until every part of her was constricting before he stopped just as suddenly.</p><p>“<em>Hey</em>!” she protested but he was already between her legs, grabbing hold of each one and wrapping them around his waist. “Oh, okay.”</p><p>“Is this what I have to do from now on to get you to spill your truths to me?” he asked teasingly and pushed inside.</p><p>Hermione’s hands dragged on the sheets, groaning. There it was again. That delicious ache in every cell in her. But still, he wasn’t all the way in, and she growled. He was taking his sweet time, savoring every moan and reaction from her.</p><p>“If you act like this, then I’ll spill your guts instead,” she answered.</p><p>He chuckled. “Bossiness looks good on you, Granger. It’s a very sexy vibe.”</p><p>How many times have people, even her friends, called her that? Thrown it at her like an insult. With time, she had learned not to listen to them.</p><p>But she was listening now.</p><p>He leaned over her, ever so slowly, until they were skin on skin, lips breaths away from one another. And he was finally deep in her.</p><p>“I’m very thorough,” he whispered, brushing away a few stray hairs from her forehead.</p><p>He moved slowly like each one was studied intensely beforehand. Like he knew that each specific stroke would have a certain effect on her.</p><p>The fire grew, and soon enough, she was covered in sweat with Malfoy kissing the life into her. She memorized his thrusts before she raised her hips to meet his, and he smiled against her lips.</p><p>“O for Outstanding,” he murmured and she laughed.</p><p>But the laughter disappeared when he alternated between slow and fast. Bringing her just to the edge and back. He knew what to do and he knew how to do it well, and Hermione wouldn’t have been surprised if they stayed hours here with him teasing her like this.</p><p>She clutched on to his shoulders, nails going through the same scratches she made earlier and he buried his head in the crook of her neck, kissing her. Her breaths were shallow and hot and uneven, and she had never felt more undone in her life.</p><p>“Malfoy,” she moaned against his ear and he stiffened, shudders running through him and her.</p><p>Suddenly, he sat back up, his face blushing a furious red, and Hermione felt confused. All of this. Fingering her. Being inside her. Fucking her. Those were all normal to him but her moaning his name had him looking like a virgin boy.</p><p>“Well, well, <em>well</em>,” she said. “Is this what <em>I</em> have to do next time to get you to stop acting like a jackass?”</p><p>He covered his face with one hand, trying to regulate his breaths. The scars on his skin stretched with each flex of his muscles.</p><p>And Hermione knew exactly how she’d make him lose control.</p><p>Though it was time sensitive.</p><p>She squirmed under him, sighing. “I’m feeling neglected.”</p><p>He shook his head, his ears still a scarlet red. It was such a contrast beside his white blonde hair.</p><p>He smiled and took each one of her legs to support them over his shoulders and she slid down, her heart galloping.</p><p>“I promised you we’ll fuck, Granger,” he said, his voice low and throaty.</p><p>And he did.</p><p>Her gasps spilled out of her lips before she could stop them, the angle of the way he was pushing into her creating a different, deeper sensation. His fingers were digging into her thighs, holding her into place, making him and only him control the depth and speed of his movements.</p><p>He teased her long and hard until she was sure her soul was about to leave her body. Until she knew she was going to die from the frustration of it all. It wasn’t Voldemort or a Death Eater who would kill her in the upcoming war, it was Draco Malfoy and the way he made her feel sensations she didn’t were humanely possible.</p><p>“<em>What are you doing</em>?” she eventually screamed.</p><p>“Beg,” he whispered between thrusts.</p><p>She tried reaching for him, but she couldn’t move with the way he was holding her. Frustrated, she snarled and banged her fist on the mattress.</p><p>“Beg me to fuck you harder,” he said, his eyes shining like a madman and his tongue darted out licking his lips. “<em>Beg</em> me.”</p><p>God, she was going to rip that smirk off his face as soon as she could move.</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” she said and then gasped when he thrust again.</p><p>“We can do this all day, Granger,” he said like a teacher lecturing their student.</p><p><em>Beg</em>, her body screamed at her, <em>just beg and let us fall</em>.</p><p><em>So I can see the smugness in his eyes every time I look at him? Knowing what we’re both thinking about? I’d rather die, </em>her mind screamed back.</p><p>He pulled all the way out and slowly pushed in and she fisted the sheets, her eyes blind now. Every part of her was as tight as an arrow, every part waiting for that release that he so selfishly was keeping away.</p><p>But two could play at that game.</p><p>She sighed, stretching her neck over the sweat-drenched pillow and she knew his stare was caught on the shape of her breasts. She took every flame burning through her and reveled in them before half-opening her eyes to gaze at him through hooded lids.</p><p>“I want you,” she purred, “to <em>fuck</em> me harder.”</p><p>His mouth dropped open before a victorious grin decorated his face. But she wasn’t done.</p><p>She moaned louder, raising her arms over her head, and she felt him strain inside her. No matter his experiences, he was still a boy. He was still turned on and deep inside a girl.</p><p>Still, he was true to his word and picked up his speed. When she felt the fire nearly burn her out completely, when she knew she was breaths away from falling over, she moaned, “<em>Draco</em>.”</p><p>His reaction was instant. A gasp ripped from his throat, his grip on her thighs wavering and his thrusts became erratic, and with a smug grin, Hermione knew it was a tie.</p><p>He growled, letting go of her legs and crashed his lips on hers. Her laugh vanished when he slid his fingers between them, and Hermione began to feel her legs stiffen.</p><p>The kisses were careless as he pushed in deeper and harder until her toes curled. His breaths were hot against her ear, his hands laced between hers and pressing them to the sheets.</p><p>It didn’t take long after that for her to fall apart and she did so with his name on her lips.</p><p>“<em>Draco</em>.”</p><p>He moaned, kissing away her soft cries and his pleasure washed over him in heavy waves. His arms trembled, no longer able to hold him up and he collapsed on top of her.</p><p>His breaths were harsh, his heartbeat thundering over her chest, and his skin was slick with sweat but Hermione didn’t care. She wrapped her arms around him, her legs intertwined with his and took a few moments to gather herself. She wouldn’t have minded it in the least if they stayed here, unmoving, rumpled in each other for the rest of the day. The rest of the week, even.</p><p><em>No</em>, she thought dreamily. <em>Month</em>.</p><p>He still hadn’t moved and so she gently stroked back his hair, admiring how silky it felt between her fingers. The shampoos and hair conditioners he used must be outrageously expensive. While her hair had a life of its own, and she’d grown to love how unpredictable it was, his was the embodiment of the word perfect. Even now with it flying everywhere from how much she rummaged through it during their sex.</p><p>Sex.</p><p>Hermione could have laughed to herself.</p><p>This was not how she thought her day would go when she woke up this morning. She didn’t expect to have a warm glow in her chest.</p><p>Eventually, he detached himself from her, laying down on his side, facing her and his eyes were half-closed. The grey in them now a frosty blue. He reached up to trail his fingers down her cheek.</p><p>“How was it?” he murmured.  </p><p>She sighed under his touch. “Horrible.”</p><p>His eyes shot open. “<em>What</em>?”</p><p>He looked so alarmed, Hermione couldn’t help not laughing.</p><p>“You didn’t let me finish.” Her fingers danced on his chest. “At first, it was horrible with the pain but then it got good.”</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. “<em>Good</em>? That’s <em>it</em>?”</p><p>A mischievous smile played on her lips. “Do you want me to praise your fucking skills?”</p><p>He frowned. “Would it kill you to do so?”</p><p>She shrugged, not wanting to let go of the fuzzy, warm feeling. Not wanting to open that curtain and walk out of the common room. Not yet.</p><p>“I mean,” she drawled, glancing back at the window. The sun was reaching the mountains, meaning it was afternoon.</p><p>What did she have on her agenda today? Nothing, really. Just reading up on the History of Demonology.</p><p>She turned back to him and he was still looking at her questioningly. She tried to pinpoint the moment he had changed from an annoying, little twerp to annoyingly, handsome, tall boy with a body she wanted to spend hours tracing her lips with.</p><p>“Spit it out, Granger!” he said when she’d be silent for too long.</p><p>“I don’t think I’m ready to leave,” she whispered, the truth falling from her lips before she could stop it.</p><p>He looked taken aback.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to rectify herself. “This… between us, I’m not crazy, right? This doesn’t happen. Because I’ve never—”</p><p>“Felt anything like this with anyone,” he finished for her.</p><p>She swallowed hard. “Yes,” she whispered.</p><p>His hands reached up to cup her cheeks, and she leaned into his touch, closing her eyes briefly.</p><p>“But I hate you,” he said, the words sounding unconvincing and meaningless.</p><p>“And I hate you,” she replied, matching his tone.</p><p>They blinked at each other, coming to the same conclusion.  </p><p>“Does that mean we’re going to—” he said.</p><p>Her breath caught on its way out. “I guess it does.”</p><p>“No one can ever know,” they said in unison, and stared at each other in amazement.</p><p>He chuckled and she smiled.</p><p>Closing the distance between them, he kissed her softly. It was sweet, full of promise to what their future private moments would entail.</p><p>“Does that mean I’ll get to hear you call me Draco from now on?” he murmured, and she wiggled close to him.</p><p>“You really like that?” she asked, surprised. “Of all things? I thought daddy would be the one to make you weak in the knees. Or Lord Malfoy, Ruler of All.”</p><p>He looked amused and tilted her chin up. “We’ll circle back to that in a bit, but I like you calling me Draco because you’ve spent the last six years or so saying Malfoy with contempt. Draco is a fresh start.”</p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>She took in a deep breath. “Then it’s only fair you call me Hermione. But <em>not</em> in front of the others!”</p><p>“I’m not stupid, Hermione,” he said, rolling his eyes. Her name rolled off his tongue like it always belonged there. “If anyone’s going to blow our cover, it’s going to be you.”</p><p>She looked highly affronted.</p><p>“But let’s not think of that,” he said, grabbing her waist and dragged her on top of him. She let out a squeal. “There’s so much I want to do with you.”</p><p>Her heart thudded louder. “So much?”</p><p>His pomposity was returning in the tilt of his lips and the jutting of his chin. He ran one long finger along her lips and down her throat, tracing the veins. “Oh yes. I still didn’t taste you. Still didn’t take you from every possible position. Fuck you against the wall. Fuck you in all the hidden places in Hogwarts. We’re going to keep a tally. Also you didn’t scream my name loud enough.”</p><p>She shuddered at the icy fire burning in his eyes, and just as suddenly, he flipped them over, so she was under him.</p><p>“And, yes,” he murmured, his breath hot on her neck. “I’d like you to call me daddy.”</p><p>She snorted and felt his laugh vibrating over skin.</p><p><em>This may be a very bad idea</em>, Hermione thought when his lips found hers again, but at this moment, she couldn’t possibly know why.</p><p><em>No</em>, she thought when he glanced down at her and she could see him. The real him without any masks or sneers. He was so beautiful that her heart hurt. Beautiful in the way he held her in his eyes. <em>It’s not a bad idea. </em></p><p>
  <em>It’s a terrible fucking idea. </em>
