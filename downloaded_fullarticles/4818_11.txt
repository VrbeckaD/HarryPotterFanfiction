    <p>June 1997</p>
<p>My love was roused with strength in your light clear,<br/>
The glints of fire across your eyes and sword,<br/>
Showed gentle courage which could ease my fear,<br/>
This sacrifice was shown for no reward.</p>
<p>Spells flashed across the room at your commands,<br/>
Your leadership inspired the people's trust,<br/>
With silver glowed your wand: a stag there stands,<br/>
Your hart shined victory will be a must.</p>
<p>Rivers of tears down-streamed as moonlight glares,<br/>
You watched the corpse shine green from evil Mark,<br/>
As they, their wands, lit-up to see hope flares,<br/>
You rose, with me, and there resolve stood stark.</p>
<p>And thus, I have in darkness loved you best,<br/>
Where I, your pain, would cradle to my breast.</p>
