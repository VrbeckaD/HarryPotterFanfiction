  <em> ‘To my dearest M.,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I know my previous letters were bordering on nonsensical and I wish to apologize to you. You have been the only person who I can rely on during this serious matter. Your continued support has been much appreciated, as well as greatly needed. My nerves have been frayed from the stress and day-to-day horrors that has befallen the manor. It seems that any day could be the day where I finally lose the last of my heart to the hands of some unspeakable monster from a land far from my own. This brings me to our previous conversation. You have children, all of the marrying age. My child is in desperate need of a political marriage. It is for his safety. I do wish you to consider my request. I cannot lose him. They have taken so much from me already. The Ministry has already sent files to the manor of suitors that have agreed to marry my son. The chosen ones are horrid, my dear. I could never allow them to come near my son, but I fear I may not have a choice for much longer before my son is forced into a marriage with a man that sees him nothing as a prisoner to have their way with and to punish for the sins of the father. It is not only that. I have begun receiving threats of harm and even death to my son in regard of the war and his involvement. I fear that he will always be suspected for dark magic, even as he has long been acquitted for these claims. I beg you, my dearest and closest friend. Please, consider my request. My husband may never return from Azkaban. I can no longer protect my son on my own. I need you and your family’s help.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Yours,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>N. </em>
</p>
<p>Molly Weasley of the Weasley family read the letter and then reread the letter. The marks of dried tears were evident, smearing parts of the ink, while still staying legible enough to be read. The owl had brought it just moments ago and it pained Molly to know that her friend, as troubled as their relationship had grown, was hurting as much as she was and that her family had fallen to such horrible atrocities after the war had ended.</p>
<p>“Mum, what’s wrong?” Ginny, her only birthed daughter, asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing, dear,” Molly replied with a forced smile, quickly patting away her tears and folding up the letter.</p>
<p>Ginny dropped her questions, only for the fact that her mother was not ready to voice any answers.</p>
<p>“Now, let’s take those scones out of the oven before they begin to burn and then we can start waking up the rest of the household,” she smiled. </p>
<p>The boys and their significant others had populated the Weasley household once again. Her youngest son, Ron and lovely Hermione; her only daughter, Ginny and dearest Harry; her oldest child, Bill and beautiful Fleur, and then the bachelors; Percy, who seemed to have no time for a life outside of family and his work; George, who still ran Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, but had less and less of a hand in the day-to-day running of the shop now that a full staff had been hired. Molly’s son had lost his smile after the war and he had become more reclusive because of it. Then there was Charlie Weasley, the oldest of the remaining bachelors. He was still living on the reserve in Romania, but had taken time off to see the family and was staying at the house for a few weeks.</p>
<p>“I’ll start knocking on doors,” Ginny informed her mother, running to the stairs like she used to as a small child when her and her mother would wake up earlier than the rest in order to fire up the oven and stove, as they had done every morning for breakfast. </p>
<p>Ginny and Harry were happy together, as was Ron and Hermione at the best of times. Bill and Fleur were right for each other, while Percy may never bring himself to find time for a spouse. George had already told her that he was uninterested in any relationship that was not familial or that of a friendship. Charlie, he was the only other option. Molly was not ignorant to her son and his preferences, nor was she ignorant to the shenanigans he had gotten up to in the past, which had inspired Fred and George, no doubt. She would bring him aside and speak with him. She would do this for her friend. She could only try, despite knowing the cost it would be for her son.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>His sister’s persistent knocking woke George from his slumber. Annoying as ever, he thought, but perhaps more annoying now that she had shacked up with Harry. Harry was a good friend to him, though, and always part of the family, it seemed. He should feel happier for his sister. She had chosen a good guy, at least.<p>Sitting up out of bed, George yawned and stretched, hearing the satisfying cracking noises his body made. Felt good to stretch. He knew better than to dally all morning, though. He’d have lost his other ear from all his mother’s yammering for not hurrying his butt out of bed and into the kitchen for breakfast. He looked over to the other half of the room, no longer used, gave out a sigh, and then got out of bed.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>Ginny’s knocking startled Charlie awake, causing him to fall out of bed. The banging he had made was enough to have his sister open up the door to peek in to see if he was alright.<p>“Good job, you oaf,” she giggled after seeing he was still alive and kicking.</p>
<p>“Let’s see how you fare next time I wake you up loudly from a nice sleep,” he retorted.</p>
<p>“That’ll never happen,” she said.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah?” he asked, getting himself untangled from the covers and finding his footing, “and why’s that?”</p>
<p>“You’d never wake up before me, Char. In fact, you wouldn’t wake up for breakfast if it wasn’t for someone forcing you awake.”</p>
<p>“Touché, little sister,” he admitted with a soft chuckle.</p>
<p>“Now hurry up, mum’s waiting and she has been a little off since she got a letter earlier,” Ginny told him, lowering her voice for that last part.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Charlie asked, concerned.</p>
<p>“Not sure,” Ginny frowned. “Mum won’t say anything about it.”</p>
<p>Charlie felt his heart constrict at the thought of what could have been said in the letter for his mother to not want to talk about it. After all, they were a pretty open family when it came to most anything.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>Bill and Fleur were awake already when Ginny had knocked. They were getting dressed after they had enjoyed themselves hours before.<p>“Bill, we must hurry,” Fleur told her husband. “I do not wish to be late for your mother’s, urm, meal.”</p>
<p>“Breakfast will still be there, my love, it is not going anywhere,” except maybe onto Ron’s plate if we do take too long, his mind supplied. “Actually, we better be down there before the others if we want a good seat,” he told his beautiful wife, quickly slipping on his pajama pants.</p>
<p>“Oui!”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>Harry had heard the door to Ginny’s bedroom open and then felt his fiancée begin to nudge his shoulder lightly. “Babe?” he mumbled, receiving a kiss on the lips as a response.<p>“Wake up, dear,” she said. “Breakfast is ready.”</p>
<p>Harry’s stomach responded to the word ‘breakfast’ and promptly growled, telling him he had better listen to what it wanted. He reached for his glasses and got out of bed.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>“Come on, Ronald,” Hermione told her husband. “It’s time to wake up.”<p>“Five more minutes,” he mumbled, sleepily.</p>
<p>“No, I think you’ve had enough sleep. Besides, you know just how good your mother makes her scones.”</p>
<p>“Scones?” he whined, cracking open his eyes to see his wife hovering over him.</p>
<p>“Yes, babe. They are so fluffy and warm and best when they are fresh from the oven.”</p>
<p>“They are,” he agreed, still tired.</p>
<p>“So let’s go,” Hermione said, pulling her husband out of bed. The smell of the scones had begun seeping into the room, which woke Hermione, although she was content to cuddle longer with her husband in bed before she heard Ginny making the rounds to wake up the others.</p>
<p>The two had opened the door, just as Ginny lifted her fist to knock against it.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>Percy had not needed his little sister’s help on waking up. Ginny was greeted to an empty room after multiple knocks on his door. He had managed to get downstairs without her knowledge at some point, probably when she went into her and Harry’s room. Regardless, that was all of them and she was able to join them all downstairs.<center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>Breakfast went as usual. Arthur Weasley appeared after work near the beginning of the meal to join them for a quick bite, greeted everyone, and then popped off to bed for a nap. Harry and Ron talked about their jobs while Hermione and Ginny talked about the rights for magical creatures to themselves. Percy’s bed head was the source of George’s occasional jokes, jokes which had become a rare occurrence as the days passed. Charlie and Bill discussed life on the reserve, dragons, and the future with each other, all while Molly discussed recipes with Fleur, who still struggled with some of Molly’s vocabulary.<p>“I guess what I’m getting at is that I’m worried about you spending all your time on the reserve. It’s gotta be hard on your body and mind,” Bill said. “From my stand point, it seems like you work all hours of the day and night, only stopping to eat and sleep. I’m just worried for you.”</p>
<p>Charlie gave Bill a small smile. “It is hard work, but the dragons need me,” he told him, as if that calmed all of Bill’s fears. It didn’t.</p>
<p>“We need you, too,” Bill told him, caring as he always was. “Do you think you could ever take a few less hours? Just to give yourself a break?”</p>
<p>“I’m taking a break now,” Charlie replied with a grin.</p>
<p>“Your first break since the war, is it?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call the war a break,” Charlie muttered, remembering the long journeys he had taken the dragons on in order to help with the fight, as well as the fear of losing one of his dragons, witnessing the loss of his precious friends, and losing his dear brother.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant,” Bill muttered, sullenly.</p>
<p>“Bill, amore,” Fleur said, putting her hand on Bill’s own clenched one.</p>
<p>Bill took in a deep breath and let it our slowly, realizing he was getting worked up. He didn’t want to say something he would regret or that would upset the entire family. It was at the tip of his tongue. He had almost said it. <em> I don’t want to lose another brother. </em></p>
<p>“Charlie, may I speak to you, dear?” Molly asked, pulling her son outside and into the garden.</p>
<p>“Wonder what they’re talkin’ ‘bout,” Ron piped in with a full mouth and food on his chin.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>“Mum, I swear I’ll pull back on a few work hours,” Charlie began once they were out of ear shot from the rest of the Weasley clan.<p>“It’s not that, dear,” Molloy told her son. “Well, not just that.”</p>
<p>“It’s not?” Charlie asked, confused until he saw his mother pull out a letter. A letter that Ginny had mentioned when she went to wake him. “Mum? What is it?”</p>
<p>Molly gave her son a sad smile as she opened the letter. “I need to ask you something,” she told him.</p>
<p>“Anythin’,” he told her, putting his large hand on her shoulder in a way of comfort.</p>
<p>“Well, I have a friend that has been sending me letters. They are mostly in secret, due to the circumstances.”</p>
<p>“Mum, are you in trouble?” Charlie asked, jumping to conclusions.</p>
<p>“No, no, nothing like that,” she assured. “It’s nothing about me.”</p>
<p>“Then what is it?”</p>
<p>She paused, trying to approach the subject with her son in a way that would be easier than just getting into the meat of things, but decided this would be easiest. “I think it may be about you,” she admitted.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>Ron, Bill, Harry, and Ginny crowded around the small kitchen window that looked out into the garden, trying to figure what was going on with their mother and the eldest boy of the family, while the others sat at the table, continuing to eat and wait for any news. Was she trying to finally convince him to move back to Britain? Had she gotten fed up with his excruciating work hours as Bill had? Or was it something else that they had not thought of yet or even known of?<p>“Mum got a letter today,” Ginny told them, her voice soft and her expression that of worry for her mother and brother.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>“Narcissa and I have been friends since school,” Molly told her son.<p>“What does that have to do with me?” he asked confused.</p>
<p>“I’m getting to that,” she told him with a whack on the shoulder with the letter. “She has recently begun writing to me about her son. He has been threatened by the Ministry and the wizarding community for the past few months. The Ministry has plans to marry him off to some foreign ambassador, Ministry head, or another older fart and probably corrupt bastard to keep him in line.”</p>
<p>“How is that even a possibility? Forced marriages are illegal,” Charlie said.</p>
<p>“It’s only possible in their case because Narcissa’s son was working with, well, his father and You-Know-Who,” she said, still feeling the evil in the name. “They believe that marrying him to someone in a position of political power with elevate the Ministry’s power against the remaining dark magic wielders and make an example out of Narcissa’s son. She is worried for him and contacted me. He was forced into working for You-Know-Who, that’s the only reason he’s not in Azkaban.”</p>
<p>“Mum, what are you asking me?” Charlie asked beginning to understanding what his mum was getting at with the explanation.</p>
<p>“Charlie, if you marry her son, just as a political marriage, it would save him.”</p>
<p>“Who is he?”</p>
<p>Molly Weasley took a breath and looked her son in the eye. “Draco Malfoy needs our help, Charlie. He needs your help.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>“Wait, somethin’ is happenin’, “Ron said, watching his mother tell Charlie something that was, by Charlie’s reaction of open mouth and wide eyed at her, very shocking, indeed.<p>“Mum speaks so that her lips can’t be read,” Bill explained, “we have no idea what she’s saying.”</p>
<p>“So we can’t ever eavesdrop,” Percy added.</p>
<p>“Hopefully everything is okay,” Hermione said, receiving a half hug of support from Fleur.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>“Well?” Molly asked, seeing as her son had not given her a reply or anything to her answer of naming Narcissa’s son.<p>“I,” Charlie began, “I-I just,” he began pacing. “I need to think,” he told her before plopping down on a large stone.</p>
<p>“It is asking a lot,” Molly said, feeling guilty to put this on her son’s shoulders, but knowing she had to do <em> something </em> for her dearest friend.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it is,” her son said, massaging his temple with his finger tips.</p>
<p>“Draco doesn’t have much longer,” Molly whispered, mostly to herself.</p>
<p>Charlie let out a sigh, “I...will agree to meet with him,” he decided. “Somewhere open and public, we can go to Diagon Alley. Walk around, talk a bit,” he said before adding, “Get to know each other.”</p>
<p>“Charlie,” Molly said, crouching down to guy her son, graciously. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a yes.” Charlie hugged her back. “Why the Weasley family, mum? Why me?”</p>
<p>“We are still considered a pure blood family, so the Ministry can’t stop it. Besides, this family did a good deal in the war and the reputation helps. Couldn’t stop us if they tried,” she winked and smiled. “Dear, I chose to ask you because you are kind hearted and always willing to help, but I know this is asking a lot. You agreed to meet him and that is more than I believe most of your siblings would agree to. You also fancy blokes,” she softly laughed, “so that helps.”</p>
<p>Charlie scoffed at his mother’s answer, amused and maybe a bit happy to know his mum thought of him as a kind person. “Not sure if I can argue with that,” he told her. He wasn’t going to admit to his mother that he did find the Malfoy boy, aged the same as his youngest brother and Harry, quite attractive, even if he was a bit uncomfortable with the age difference. “I’m going to have to keep my past opinions of him put there by Ron away from our meet up, aren’t I?” he asked his mum, already knowing the answer.</p>
<p>“I suppose you will if you want to put in a real effort,” she said, combing his hair with her fingers, something she did when he was little. Hell, it was something she still did from time to time, if he was being truthful. </p>
<p>“Tell his mother to have him meet me at Florean’s the day after tomorrow at noon,” he requested, officially making the decision in his head that he would put real effort into this, if not for the sake of Draco, a man he had little to no interaction with other than stories from his brothers and from the papers, than he would do this for his mother, because she cared. She really did.</p>
<p>“I’ll write her now,” Molly told him, pulling him up with her as they returned to the house, ignoring the curious looks from the other household members.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> *** </p>
</center>Bill had been the Weasley sibling to corner Charlie for questions, knowing he would be the best one to get some answers out of him, as they all knew there would be nothing given away from their mother. “Alright, spit it out,” he began after he followed Charlie into Charlie’s room and closed the door behind him.<p>“Spit what out?” Charlie asked innocently, “I have nothing in my mouth and I doubt you would want anything that I would have up in there. The human mouth is riddled with bacteria, you know. It’s disgusting.”</p>
<p>“What?” the scarred brother asked, “No, I want to know what you and mum were talking about.” They all wanted to know, which is why Bill was voted to be the one to find out.</p>
<p>“Oh, dearest brother of mine, you will have to try harder than that to get answers out of me,” Charlie smirked.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Bill crossed his arms and sat onto Charlie’s bed.</p>
<p>Charlie sat next to him, watching his younger brother work out a plan in his head.</p>
<p>“How about a game of questions?” Bill asked. “You get one and then I get one.”</p>
<p>“Hm, that doesn’t seem fair.” Charlie replied.</p>
<p>“No holds barred,” Bill added, sweetening the pot.</p>
<p>“Deal,” Charlie replied with a sly smile and casted a silencing spell on the room, knowing the others were just outside the door, hoping to hear them.</p>
<p>“Let’s begin,” Charlie said, thinking up his first question.</p>
