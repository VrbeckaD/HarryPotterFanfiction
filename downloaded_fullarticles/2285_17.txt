  <em>Summary: Imagine meeting Chester Davies again a few years after graduation</em>

</p><p>My former Prefect is sitting on a leather armchair in <em>Flourish &amp; Blotts</em>, head bent over a heavy book. I study him for a moment, watching the way he runs his finger over the text to keep from losing his place. I’ve seen him do this very thing hundreds of times before, but never outside of Hogwarts. My pulse is racing as I approach him.</p><p>“Hi, Chester.”</p><p>When he looks up, I notice that he still has dark circles under his eyes. He’s relatively unchanged; his cheekbones are perhaps a bit more defined – but he has the same hairstyle – and the same wide smile that shows off his dimples.</p><p>“(Name)! Wow it’s been ages! How have you been?”</p><p>“Not bad, and yourself?”</p><p>He closes the book. “I’m managing. It’s busy at the ministry, so I don’t get a lot of free time.”</p><p>“And not enough sleep apparently,” I tease.</p><p>“Yeah, I’ve been staying up late researching for a case. I guess old habits die hard.”</p><p>“You work in the Magical Law department?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Chester stands up. “Hey, I think you’ve grown taller.”</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest. “I should hope so; I was a child the last time you saw me.”</p><p>“Remind me how old you are again?”</p><p>“Twenty,” I reply. “And you’re, what, twenty-four?”</p><p>He nods. “My birthday was at the end of August.”</p><p>“Let me take you somewhere for a belated celebration. We can catch up.”</p><p>“Sure, that sounds great. I just need to pay for this first.”</p><p>I gaze out the front window while he’s at the register. It’s raining and my jacket doesn’t have a hood. “It’s really coming down out there,” I say as he stands beside me.</p><p>“No worries, I have an umbrella.” Chester pats his jacket pocket. “Extendable charm. I like to be prepared.”</p><p>I smile. “That’s so like you… always responsible and a step ahead of everyone.”</p><p>“Ah, well, I’ve always had to be since I’m the eldest.” Chester raises the umbrella over our heads once we’re outside. “Sorry, we’ll have to get a bit closer,” he says, putting his arm around me.</p><p>That same fluttery feeling I used to get around him when I was twelve makes an appearance again. “Uh, so where do you want to eat?” I ask, trying to ignore the fact that I still have a crush on him after all these years.</p><p>“<em>The Leaky Cauldron</em> is fine with me.”</p><p>We find a free table in the back of the warm pub. Chester sheds his jacket, pushes up the sleeves of his sweater, and brushes the hair from his eyes. It’s unfair how effortlessly attractive he is.</p><p>“So how’s the curse-breaking business?” he asks, snapping me out of my daze.</p><p>“Oh, umm, I’m not doing that anymore.”</p><p>His brow furrows. “Really? Did something happen?”</p><p>“Yeah… I nearly died a few months ago.”</p><p>His eyes widen. “Merlin’s beard, that’s terrible! Is there any lasting damage?”</p><p>“No, but I was in a coma for almost a week. It made me realize just how tired of danger I am. I need some peace in my life.”</p><p>He nods. “I don’t blame you. Are you job hunting? I can put in a good word for you at the ministry if you like.”</p><p>“I appreciate the offer, but I’m planning on opening a book café in Muggle London. I have enough money saved up from curse-breaking.”</p><p>“Sounds like a great idea. Let me know once it’s open so I can be your first customer.”</p><p>I smile at him. “I definitely will.”</p><p>A waiter comes by to take our order. We continue to catch up and I casually ask him if he’s seeing anyone.</p><p>Chester shakes his head. “I’m way too busy for dating. I was in a relationship last year, but it didn’t last for very long. I guess I was a pretty neglectful boyfriend… always bringing my work home and cancelling dates. She was right to break up with me.”</p><p>“I’m sorry. Are you still upset about it?”</p><p>“Not at all, we weren’t exactly serious.” He smiles at me. “So what about you? Is there anyone in your life at the moment?”</p><p>“Nope. I never had enough free time to date. I’d like to now – if I happen to meet someone that is.” But I know I’ve already met him. The only problem is whether or not he could ever feel the same way.</p><p align="center">

  <strong> <em>2 months later: mid-November</em> </strong>
</p><p>It’s eight in the morning and I’m walking around my bookshop, admiring all the hard work I’ve put into it. The walls have been painted a dark blue and I had an electric fireplace installed to give it a cozy feeling. All the furniture was bought second-hand. My favorite piece is a mustard yellow sofa from the 1970s.</p><p>I switch on the coffee pot before going over to the display window to plug in the fairy lights. That’s when I spot Chester crossing the street. He’s holding a small potted evergreen in his arms. I meet him at the door.</p><p>“Congratulations, (Name)! I thought you could do with a Christmas tree. I hope you don’t have one already.”</p><p>“No, I don’t,” I reply, taking it from him. “Thank you for bringing such a thoughtful gift.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re welcome. This place looks great,” he says, unwinding the Ravenclaw scarf from his neck. I find it endearing that he still wears our house colors. “Did Rowan help you with the book inventory?”</p><p>“Yes, we traveled to shops all over the United Kingdom. It was a lot of fun.”</p><p>“I’m sure it was… I would love to do something like that.”</p><p>“You can come with me on my next buying trip,” I offer.</p><p>Chester flashes me a grin. “Thanks, I’ll look forward to it.”</p><p>My heart skips a beat. He really has no idea just how dangerous those dimples are. “Umm, why don’t you sit down on the sofa? I’ll get your coffee. Do you still take it black with three sugars?”</p><p>“Ah, yes I do! I’m surprised you still remember that.”</p><p>“I have a good memory.” <em>Especially when it concerns you,</em> I add silently as I walk towards the café. I set the mini-tree down on the counter and start preparing our drinks.</p><p>“I really appreciate you getting up early on your day off,” I say, sitting beside him. “I know how much you like to sleep in.”</p><p>“Some things are worth getting up for.” He takes a sip of coffee. “So have you hired any part-timers yet?”</p><p>“Yes. One of them will be in at noon.”</p><p>“And how’s your flat upstairs? Are you all unpacked?”</p><p>“Not quite, but it’s coming along. I’m planning a housewarming party at the beginning of December. I hope you’ll be free.”</p><p>“I usually am. I don’t have much of a social life outside of work.”</p><p>“Maybe you will now that I’m here.” I cringe at how flirtatious that sounds, but Chester doesn’t seem to pick up on it.</p><p>“Hmm, I suppose I could let you drag me out every now and then…”</p><p>We continue talking until the grand opening at nine. I’m surprised to see two customers already waiting outside. “Hello, thanks so much for coming! Beverages are only a dollar today and all books are 20% off the list price.”</p><p>A few more people come in after that and I’m beyond thrilled when someone buys a bagful of books. Rowan arrives just after ten – all smiles and boundless enthusiasm. My best friend sits down to chat with our former Prefect while I assist some customers. Everyone says how much they love the shop and I feel far more gratified now than I did when I was breaking curses.</p><p>Chester gives me a hug before he leaves, pressing his smooth cheek against mine. I can smell his aftershave: a clean, fresh scent that reminds me of the woods right after it rains.</p><p>He pulls back, brown eyes sparkling. “I’m proud of you, (Name). I hope you don’t mind me visiting on my lunch breaks.”</p><p>“No, I’d like that,” I say.</p><p>He lets go of me. “It’s a promise then. I’ll see you on Monday!”</p><p>I smile. “Bye, Chester – thanks again.”</p><p>He gives me a wave and I watch his retreating back, feeling a bit lonely now that he’s gone. <em>But it’s not as though he could stay all morning, </em>I remind myself.</p><p>“Still got it bad, huh?” Rowan asks.</p><p>I let out a sigh. “Yeah… I know it’s pathetic.”</p><p>“On the contrary – you actually have a chance this time around.”</p><p>“What makes you say that?”</p><p>Rowan pushes up their glasses. “Because he told me how impressed he is with all you’ve accomplished. Gaining his respect is half the battle.”</p><p>I chew on my bottom lip. “I don’t know… he might always see me as that trouble-making kid I used to be.”</p><p>“Oh, but he doesn’t! Chester said he can’t believe how mature you’ve become. He’s definitely seeing you in a different way.”</p><p>I drape my arm around my best friend’s shoulder. “Thanks for the pep talk, Rowan. I guess I need to be more positive.”</p><p>“Of course you do – this is your new beginning after all.”</p><p>I smile. “That’s true.” Surely the universe has good things in store for me.</p>
