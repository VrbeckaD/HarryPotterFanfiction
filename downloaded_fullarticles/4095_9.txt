    <p>“M-my Lord, I-I… I have news.”</p><p>            Behind Pettigrew’s quivering mass sat Lord Voldemort in his throne, twirling his yew and phoenix feather wand in his right palm. He had on his glamour. His skin was bone white, and it looked like there were faint impressions of shiny scales. His lips were thin and practically non-existent. The Dark Lord was bald and his eyes had no pupils;they were glowing ruby red and staring coldly. He looked terrifying. It was the main meeting room for his elite, in front of Voldemort was a long ebony table, with serpents embellishing the legs. He was preparing for a meeting with only his most trusted. He told his Death Eaters not to disturb him unless it was extremely important. Narrowing his eyes, the Dark Lord spoke, "Good or bad?” in his high and sibilant voice.</p><p> Peter mumbled and continued looking at the ground. Getting frustrated, Voldemort rolled his eyes and threw a crucio at him for his insolence. Luckily for Wormtail, he let if off quickly. </p><p>      ”Tell me now Wormtail, or I will not be so merciful.” His voice was a deadly whisper. showing just how irritated he was. He obviously had no qualms crucioing Pettigrew, but he wanted him coherent. It was obviously important if it couldn’t wait until after the meeting. </p><p>       Wormtail spoke, trembling and stuttering at every word. It was obviously was not expected by Voldemort, because a look of surprise clouded his serpent-like features before he regained his mask.</p><p>     ”Look me in the eye.” Slowly looking from the ground, Wormtail trembled as he met the ruby eyes of the Dark Lord. Pettigrew’s eyes got glazed as his conscious got shoved into his mind. Using non-verbal legilimency, Voldemort started filing through it. At his forefront is terror, with a tinge of apprehension. His thoughts were whizzing around the chaotic mess which was Pettigrew’s mindscape. It was filled with blobs of memories that weren’t in any way ordered which only further disorganized it. He obviously didn’t know or used occlumency. The Dark Lord continued studying his mindscape until he found the memory which Wormtail wanted him to find, as the unidentifiable shape glowed a faint silvery light. He grabbed it and felt a sensation that was comparable to a pensieve. He then saw Wormtail entering a house, very plain and not very impressive. When the door opened, Mrs. Potter smiled and beckoned him to come inside. Voldemort sneered at her, such a waste of magical talent. She obviously was blinded by the so called “radiancy” of Albus Dumbledore.  On a wall in the hallway leading into the house stood a calendar, stating it was October 22th judging by the lines through every date before it. When Peter went into the house James Potter smiled. The cheeky grin dropped when he glanced at the baby in a worn-down crib that's in the corner of the room; bawling. He glared murderously at the child and ignored him, Memory-Wormtail squinted his eyes in thought, "Why is James ignoring his child?"</p><p> Voldemort’s gaze grew calculating when he looked at the features of the child. The hair was artfully messy and the color was a midnight black. His nose and cheekbones were very prominent and aristocratic and his lips were full and plump. However, the most catching feature is his eyes, which are the same shade as Avada Kedavra; quite different from Lily’s emerald ones. It seems to have taken all the good features from both of them; it is quite a beautiful baby. "Why were they treating him like trash?" echoed through Wormtail’s memory, and the Dark Lord heard it as well.</p><p>   Peter’s quizzical face must of registered in James’ mind. He made a huff and glanced at Lily; who looked just as disgusted at the baby, if not wary. She made a small, and barely-noticable shake of the head. It was like she was saying yes. After the silent conversation was over they started directing Peter onto the couch. After all, Dumbledore said that Peter was trustworthy for the fidelius, why not this? It looked like Pettigrew was about to get a lecture. Lily sighed and glanced pleadingly at James as she sat down. He seemed to have taken notice and cleared his throat, "Um, Wormy, whatever you do don’t freak out.”</p><p>   Peter’s face gained even more wrinkles as he tried to figure out what was so important. A sudden thought took center stage in his mind, "Did he find out I was a spy and a Death Eater?" Wormtail’s face grew pale and he inhaled a shaky breath. "Okay? Jamie you are seriously freaking me out,” he questioned in what he hoped was a mildly unnerved voice.</p><p>      Taking a deep breath James got out, "Lily, do the spell,” Looking as if she was about to be sick, she went up to the baby tentatively; though not for the baby’s sake. Quickly grabbing him she strode to the floor in front of the couch. She held him up an arm’s length away as if it was the most putrid thing she has ever seen. She sat him down, not being gentle and Harry started to cry. To Peter’s surprise, she pointed the wand at the sobbing baby and spoke the most recognized incantation in the wizarding world, "Amor anima revelare.” It was in a harsh whisper, as if it was a curse word. James and Lily turned away grimacing as the cursive writing of Tom Marvolo Riddle rose from little Harry. Memory-Peter stood in shock at the name, as he knew who the person was. Dumbledore was very happy to tell the Order Members that the infamous blood-supremacist Voldemort was a half-blood. </p><p>      Voldemort stared at the lettering, half in awe and half in righteous anger; HOW DARE THEY TREAT HIS SOULMATE LIKE THAT! I COULD VERY WELL TORTURE THEM TO AN INCH OF THEIR LIFE AND WHEN THEY BEG FOR DEATH I WILL DENY THEM THAT MERCY! </p><p>     His mind started rambling at all the torture methods he could use on the Potter parents. He was so far gone in his own uncharacteristically shown rage that he didn’t realize he was out of the memory and back into Wormtail’s mindscape. There were very few things that could break his mask, and hurting what was HIS definitely was one of them. The Dark Lord left his mind and his magic started swirling menacingly in the air. He definitely needed an outlet or there was a chance he could hurt himself.</p><p>       Pettigrew started cowering in fear when magic started to build up in the room. It was like the air was becoming more viscous and hard to move through. The murderous intent was very easy to feel; it was like the magic was broadcasting the Dark Lord’s emotions. Waves of anger, tinged with indignantation collided with Wormtail’s puny magic, which was trying to fight off the bombardment. Voldemort tilted his head and regarded him with a glint in his eye that screamed, danger. In one fell swoop, Pettigrew started crying and Slytherin’s heir put the cruciatus curse on the rat. Glaring, Voldemort revelled in the tortured screams emanating from Wormtail. Blood started to dribble out of his mouth when he bit his tongue to try to contain the screams; it was no use, just like trying to beg for mercy.</p><p>     “Tell me where they live!” he spat through gritted teeth. Wormtail obviously did not hear, as he was still laying boneless on the floor, panting in pain. When he did not move, Voldemort sneered at him for his insolence. His followers were getting more stupid as time went on. The oppressive magic crackled in the air. In a flash, the magic swarmed and enclosed part of Wormtail’s magical core.</p><p>        In witches and wizards, your magic is just as important as blood. It transported magical energy through  as everyone knows that magic and electricity do not mix. When part your magical energy gets your body. Magical energy is basically what neurons use instead of electricity in muggles, it basically causes the cells in your body to “malfunction” and die. As your cells are dying, they cause immense pain and everywhere gets damaged just as fast. It is the opposite to the Cruciatus curse, which forces foreign magic into your core. The nerves are overloaded and the excess magic causes waves of pain. Even though they cause the same amount of pain, the type of pain is different. The Cruciatus causes waves of sharp pains which travels from the head downwards: branching out. Closing part of your core stops magical flow everywhere simultaneously and it feels like a drowning pain which intensifies the longer you are denied. During this, you are twitching uncontrollably and you feel the irrational need to stop casting magic; even though you aren’t. You do not need to close a lot of it to cause pain, and the amount of magic needed is extremely taxing; luckily, though perhaps unluckily for Pettigrew, Voldemort had it in spades. However, it is impossible to kill someone with this method. It would require someone with the magical prowess and stamina of someone like Merlin to kill someone with this method. </p><p>      Before Voldemort got close to being magically-exhausted, he let go. He was so consumed in rage he didn’t notice the hoarse screaming of Wormtail; which was still emanating from him even after the ordeal. He was writhing in obvious desperation, as the pain still hasn’t abated, "Where do the Potter’s live!” he snarled, pointing his wand at Wormtail. His eyes met the Dark Lord’s darting back in forth like a cornered cat.</p><p>       He bowed quickly, "At Godric's Hollow, mi-lord,” he stammered. </p><p>   “Leave me.” Slytherin’s heir ordered. It was obvious he was not in the best of moods and Peter wanted to leave fast, he didn’t want to be tortured any more. Wormtail practically apperated from the spot, though still wracking in little shakes. Voldemort stared vacantly at the spot of blood on the floor. As if he was still disbelieving, he cast the spell on himself. He had done it before, in his Hogwarts days and a few times after that. It was extremely rare to have one, and it doesn’t show who it is unless they had been born yet. Unsurprisingly, the words "Harry James Potter" rose up from the ground in front of him.</p><p>      After a few minutes of staring, the Dark Lord shook himself out of his thoughts and whispered into the nothingness, "I’m coming for you, soulmate.” And with that, he evaporated the lettering and continued as if nothing had happened; though when the meeting did come, it was obvious he was distracted. </p><p>      In Godric’s Hollow, Harry Potter awoke from the dream; crying and unaware that the supposed dream was actually a vision from his soulmate. His mother cast a silencing charm on the crib so her and James don’t have to deal with the crying. She sneered as she walked away in her nightgown back to their room.</p>
