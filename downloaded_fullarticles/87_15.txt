    <p>
  <span>There were very clear rules against this. She wasn’t supposed to be here, hadn’t been granted access or the right to walk and touch all that lay around her. She knew it. She knew it in her bones like she knew she </span>
  <em>
    <span>needed</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be here. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Stay out,’</span>
  </em>
  <span> they said. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Forbidden,’</span>
  </em>
  <span> they’d called it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And she had ignored all the signs. Ignored the warning. Ignored the imploring looks and rising tones, fought against even as she turned away from all the signs and ropes that barred her passage. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>This was wrong.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She went in regardless. She </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew</span>
  </em>
  <span> that the knowledge she sought out was forbidden to the vast population. A normal applicant would be screened or interviewed or shoved out through barrage of tests until they were given permission. Even some of the Professors had never once been granted access to this magnificence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Black tomes. Named for their design as well as their origin, as well as the magic kept within them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had been told </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘No,’</span>
  </em>
  <span> to the point of exhaustion. All of </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span> and all of </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> were locked away from her. She happily waved them all the finger and walked in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>No one could manage to catch her here. No one on staff would know, none of her friends would find out, not even a student would see her entering or exiting. She bided her time before making the attempt, and while she could say the wait was worth it…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was impatient.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Three years had passed since she had graduated from this school and two more wherein she combed through each and every magical library that she could get access to. She wasn’t proud of those years, couldn’t look back on them with anything less than abhorrence. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She’d earned this trip, whether her supposed betters thought so or not. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There were two Restricted sections in the Hogwarts Library. One the general public and students could use, provided that they had obtained a letter of assurance from a certified Professor, and another. One that was made to hold things back, to keep knowledge bound up that the Unspeakables hadn’t a need to keep. Nothing particularly dangerous on their own; the books were clean of curses and enchantments that could have hurt someone, and the Ministry had long ago made copies to keep housed within the bowels of the institution.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But these were the first editions. The only originals. Kept safe only on the surety of Hogwarts wards and enchantments. When she had been but a student she had wondered at these shelves. Looked at them with wonder from her place on the other side of a silver chain. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had thought her teacher's praise of the space to be nothing more than a boast to lure in stragglers to the Library. Get them with the pearl of truth, give them a glimpse of the forbidden, until eventually, they were enamoured or comfortable enough to come inside with regularity.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The greatest library since Alexandria.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The foremost collection of first edition tomes in the world. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had assumed all the words to be lies. She was sure that it was over-exaggeration meant to keep children and simpletons fawning over the place. Unfortunately, she hadn’t learned the truth until she left.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That was just as well. She wouldn’t have made a single step past that chain in her younger years.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But she was here now. She was here and she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>ready, </span>
  </em>
  <span>willing to suffer whatever came. Arms filled up with ill-gotten tomes. Protective enchantments that she had snapped with skill and precision. Protection was a flimsy lock. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Off to madness she went, and burn all the rest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione had known things, before. She knew more, now. Knew became known, became the past. Became a foundation for </span>
  <em>
    <span>more.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gods why had she ever opened those tomes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her eyelids burned. Her heart rate plummetted. She had seen things of wonder, had viewed with animosity as terror strode from ether to teach her more. Had tasted ichor, swallowed gold, let the flood in her throat become a fount which seemed unending.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had held within her trembling palms the coldly beating heart of a foreign star, and then sent it back. Bad decisions had turned to good, had turned </span>
  <em>
    <span>mad.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Bad good, good bad, and all of it was something more than nothing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Was fulfilling.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bones of her chest ached with it all. Her stomach, once so full and settled, now ached for </span>
  <em>
    <span>more. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She woke to find her skull stuffed up with cotton and harsh symbols. Bits of light and the silvered remnants of glyphs. Pressed into her vision was the afterimage of God. Gods. Goddesses. Ancient things that called themselves such once worship rose upon the Earth. Blackened things, maddened things, things they called </span>
  <em>
    <span>hope </span>
  </em>
  <span>and </span>
  <em>
    <span>hate</span>
  </em>
  <span> with equal measure.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She brought forth her own madness just the same. Felt it change her skin, her mind and heart. Felt the stirrings of something else move in where once a girl had stood. All her edges rounded down until the inside was fit for consumption. Filled with sound. A thunderstorm that found a home within her blood, a cacophony in her heart.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was no choice but to let the magic take root. She was learned enough to prevent it. But she had known that. Knew it could, knew that it would, predicted and prepared for it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And all of that for nothing. She was not strong enough, not sure enough, </span>
  <em>
    <span>she was simply not </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>enough.</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Around and around and </span>
  <em>
    <span>down</span>
  </em>
  <span> she fell. None of it would have ever been enough. Her heart pained her, forced her to cry out and beg for more with whimpers and whispers that fell on uncaring ears.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What had she wanted? What had she truly needed? What was there for her but to plead for a higher ending. More of what? More of </span>
  <em>
    <span>that.</span>
  </em>
  <span> More </span>
  <em>
    <span>all.</span>
  </em>
  <span> More </span>
  <em>
    <span>magic.</span>
  </em>
  <span> More of that pitiful thing, that living thing, that being which breathed and spoke in words she could not understand except to know that she </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> understand it, somewhere where rationality no longer lay. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had held that star. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Was </span>
  </em>
  <span>that star. Had wandered far and wide in search of memories not her own, theories she had never developed, the knowledge that first seemed harsh but later became a comfort.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That thing inside her head said, </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Go, go now, go </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>far</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span>.’</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She ran.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Bellatrix first learned that someone, somewhere, was looking for her it came with a simple note of surprise and something closely akin to suspicion. It was unusual. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Different.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Exciting and somewhat alarming, all in the same moment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was never the sister that people would come searching for. That was for Andy, or Cissa, or even for her cousins. Hells, even </span>
  <em>
    <span>they</span>
  </em>
  <span> didn’t seek her out, not now. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But when she was told that a little witch was waiting on her doorstep, she flinched. Kreacher wasn’t liable to muddle words. He wouldn’t lie, or fib, or make up some story to get her moving. The aged Elf was capable of many things but turning against his Mistress was something he could never do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And when she reached the stoop she saw for herself that the Elf was correct. A little witch stood there in a misbegotten assemblage; what looked at first glance to be a Hogwarts robe soon seemed to instead be something more. Or less. Just dregs and patches and all the things that said </span>
  <em>
    <span>poor.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All the things that said, </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Don’t notice me, look away.’</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Small, young, and by far much too inconspicuous to be anything at all but exceedingly suspicious. Bellatrix might not have been young, or old, but neither was she naive or losing her touch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And her wariness was proven right. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The moment the girl stepped into the foyer, Bellatrix knew it. A flash of light penetrated her eyes while something else threaded itself through her heart with a rush of magic. It felt like a ritual, or perhaps it was an embrace.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Like calling to like.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Except it shouldn’t have been. She had stowed that tome away and been certain that no one would ever find it amid all the others. And it appeared that she was wrong.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There before her stood a woman of rather indeterminable age. She was younger, or perhaps only just so. A decade, perhaps? More? She couldn’t tell for sure. The eyes of her visitor gave away nothing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Revealed nothing, for nothing was what they were. Blackened sclera, a golden iris, a depth much like the ocean that surrounded their little Isle. There were horns atop her heard, curving things that seemed to peak from brunette hair and then wrap around her skull, points like daggers and material as ebony as the night.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was haunting. Magic touched, magic starved, much more a beast than a woman.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A girl no longer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The amusement of the situation finally hit home. Bellatrix hadn’t seen something half so interesting since her own mismanaged Ascension. Or perhaps since Albus decided it was his life’s work to hatch an Obscurial from an orphaned boy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So who might you be Pet?” Bellatrix’s words were whispers, gentle and serene. Barely a voice at all really. She ran a fingernail across the jagged tips of horns, along the pale curve of a cheek and the plump lip that followed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She waited. And waited. And waited a moment more while the she-devil standing before her remained just as silent as the grave.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>Something</span>
  </em>
  <span> must have been decided upon in that interval, for the woman grew more on edge the longer that time passed them by. Her lips, her eyes, her whole body trembling before she finally spoke?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do I do?” The pools of black opened further, pools that Bellatrix felt drawn to despite the inherent danger that they represented. This one was untrained, unwilling. Unknowing in resolve and left to fend for herself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had so little of the resources that Bellatrix used, no safeguards or anything else of the like. To have been dragged so low by Lady Magic, to have let herself </span>
  <em>
    <span>become</span>
  </em>
  <span> what it wanted above all else was a madness that she understood intimately. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A madness that </span>
  <em>
    <span>she</span>
  </em>
  <span> had surpassed when it became evident that it was to be her final outcome. Though the woman appeared to have </span>
  <em>
    <span>some</span>
  </em>
  <span> semblance of control. She had been making rounds, looking for her for who knew how long. Had even arrived on her doorstep with a glamour instead of a shivering mess that would have been scooped up by the Ministry the minute she showed a horn in public.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Perhaps she could be saved.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix smiled as prettily as she could, “I’ll show you. Now, come along Pet.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She turned on her heels with neither an expectation that the stranger would follow her nor the presumption that she would leave. It would be - </span>
  <em>
    <span>if Magic willed it </span>
  </em>
  <span>- or it wouldn’t.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Simple as that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix’s fire burned her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rampantly consuming, unstoppable, filling each and every crook or cranny with enviable smoke that was now free to rise above it all. What flesh remained burnt out, a wick without any oil and all of it smothered beneath the heady gaze of infinity. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione was exhausted when they finished. Bellatrix was ecstatic. In gratitude, she was summarily put to bed with nothing to hold onto except her constantly shifting memories and the sparking static of Bellatrix’s magic. The she-devil kept to her word. She was a woman of design, a woman so very much more like her than she had first intuited.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Beyond</span>
  </em>
  <span> the knowledge that they had both made the rash decision to call out to the darker side of magic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Something was now wriggling beneath Hermione’s chest. Something welling up and seeking to subsume, to control all that which Hermione had unleashed. The magic that flowed down to her fingertips was as gentle as a stream or brook, neither too warm nor cold but something wholly comforting and in-between.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix had toyed with creatures and evils and </span>
  <em>
    <span>magic</span>
  </em>
  <span> that had slumbered undisturbed for millennia. She hadn’t been snubbed quite so harshly as Hermione, but still, she had taken her licks. Came through the eye of that storm with a mastery over her own body and magic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Where Bellatrix had made covenants and pacts and deals with all her devils, Hermione had unknowingly become hers. She’d given it far too much reign upon her life, let loose the cork and drank the poison down. Bellatrix admonished her lack of foresight, rightly so, and Hermione promised to never let something like that happen again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She promised to learn.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Be </span>
  <em>
    <span>better.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her body had paid its dues. Her mind, not quite so much. And she wouldn’t, so long as Bellatrix was there to help her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Help which, by and large, was easy enough to obtain. The woman had seemed to hold no needs or desires except to </span>
  <em>
    <span>know</span>
  </em>
  <span> and to</span>
  <em>
    <span> grow</span>
  </em>
  <span> beyond herself. Further </span>
  <em>
    <span>into</span>
  </em>
  <span> herself. To hold and sculpt and writhe with another who was like </span>
  <em>
    <span>her.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>No matter how exhaustive she was. No matter how belligerent and filled with spikes as like as thorns she was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione had rankled at the brusqueness of the offer but in the end, could not turn it down. There would be no salvaging what remained of her mind or body should she turn down that offer. There would be no one to save her should she fail to grasp that proffered hand, no matter the other hand holding a dagger.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She knew she had to be willing to die, and be used, to obtain the knowledge and control that she desired. She was not willing to burn away from this world without leaving it marked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix would be the one to help her with that. She could purge the control of the fabled Goddess roosting within her chest, and leave her in a controlled image of madness instead. She could give her strength, give her power, give her everything that she dreamed of while still remaining whole enough to reap the benefits. There would have to be concessions of course.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix did not work for coin but neither did she work for free.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And Hermione could live with those concessions. Who wouldn’t? They were a much better choice than being stubborn and exploding into a fiery mound of ash, or fading from this reality to the next.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A collar was locked around her neck. Thick and rigid, the whole length of it fashioned from Goblin silver and finished with a gentle clasp that sat along the nape of her neck. Always cold. Always there.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Simple enough, despite the demeaning look. And in the end, she could not help but admit that she enjoyed the visage in her mirror.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She would be a </span>
  <em>
    <span>servant</span>
  </em>
  <span> just as much as she would be an </span>
  <em>
    <span>apprentice.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Someone who had bought something so grand that nothing but everlasting servitude could ever repay it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But she kept her eyes, and she kept her tongue, even while it blackened and forked. She could switch, would have to whenever leaving the Manor, but within its walls she was safe.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She kept even the nails, rough and black and deviously sharp.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She kept it all, as Bellatrix kept her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She learned it all, as Bellatrix taught her.</span>
</p>
