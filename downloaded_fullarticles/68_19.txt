    <p>May, 1998</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Potter.” A refined, feminine voice came from behind him, and he turned to see the very tired, very dirty, very unexpected face of Narcissa Malfoy. </p><p>“Mrs Malfoy?” The Battle had ended only hours before, and he was so tired. Bone-deep, achingly tired, and he couldn’t even muster up the energy to be surprised at being approached by the woman. </p><p>“I... You... That is... Thank you.” Harry got the distinct feeling the woman was not accustomed to being at a loss for words. </p><p>“Er... I mean... You’re welcome. And thank you. I couldn’t have... I mean you didn’t... “ Harry wasn’t feeling particularly verbose at the moment, and all he really wanted was a nap. Like a year-long, sleep-like-the-dead nap. And instead he was having a very uncomfortable half-conversation with his childhood nemesis’s mother, who was probably the only reason he was currently alive. So he supposed the nap would have to wait. </p><p>“I did it for Draco.” Narcissa’s blue eyes went back to where Draco and Lucius sat, removed from everyone else. </p><p>“I know.” Harry wasn’t sure if that was the end of it until her hand shot out, grasping his tightly. Again, her warm hands seemed to be at odds with her normally icy demeanor. A squeeze, and the tall woman withdrew. </p><p>Harry watched as she sat beside Draco, wrapping her arms tightly around him. Even Lucius reached out, slipping an arm around her slender frame. Harry felt a pang of longing for his own mother. How he wished he’d gotten the time, the chance to know her. After seeing Severus’ memories, he felt her loss even more acutely. </p><p>Harry turned away, leaving the Malfoy family to their own joy, grief, relief, and regret. </p><p align="center">***</p><p>Autumn, 1998</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Potter.” The refined voice was now painfully familiar after weeks of sitting in a courtroom with her. </p><p>“Mrs Malfoy.” He turned back to see Narcissa Malfoy, her blond hair swept up in a tasteful, modest updo. Her dress, though finely made, was equally modest. In the trials, the woman and her family had been laid bare, but it had been Harry’s testimony that had them walking free. </p><p>Lucius was ordered two years of house arrest, and they would be paying excessive amounts of galleons in reparations, but they were free. Harry wasn’t sure why he was so relieved, but he couldn’t bear to think of Draco or Narcissa in Azkaban. Lucius... he was on the fence about. But he wasn’t taking to Lucius. </p><p>“Thank you, Mr Potter. Once again.”  </p><p>This time he was the one to reach out, taking her hand and squeezing it gently. Again he watched her return to Lucius and Draco, and the aching pang he felt for his own mother took his breath away. </p><p>Once more, he turned away from the Malfoy family. </p><p align="center">***</p><p>November, 1998</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Potter.” Several months of Auror training meant that he’d seen her coming, not that she was easy to miss. </p><p>“Mrs Malfoy.” He turned to find her with the closest thing to a gentle expression he’d ever seen on the woman’s face. If he wasn’t mistaken, she looked almost pleased to see him. Based on the surge he’d felt at catching a glimpse of the tall blonde, he was just as pleased to see her. How strange. </p><p>“I wanted to extend my congratulations. I heard you recently passed your examinations for the Auror office.” She glanced around as she said it, her blue eyes darting past him to take in their surroundings. Diagon Alley was busier than it had been, though still not as crowded as Harry remembered it being before the war. </p><p>“Thank you, Mrs Malfoy.” The news hadn’t hit the papers yet, so she was obviously keeping tabs on him, probably a contact within the Ministry. Her blue eyes landed back on him. </p><p>“Please, call me Narcissa.” Her blue eyes were momentarily unguarded, and he softened. </p><p>“Narcissa, then.” She smiled, a small smile, true, but it was the first real smile he’d seen from the woman. </p><p>“It was nice to see you under better circumstances, Mr Potter.” She glanced around the crowded street, obviously ill at ease. </p><p>“Harry. It’s just Harry.” Another small smile before she cast another glance around. </p><p>“Harry.” He smiled himself, but it wavered at her anxiety. </p><p>“Would you like to get a cup of tea?” he offered, not sure what else to say. </p><p>“Thank you, Harry. But Lucius will be expecting me home. Perhaps another time?” He hadn’t been expecting his hope that she would accept, nor the genuine offer of a rain check, but he nodded. </p><p>“I’d like that.” </p><p>She reached for his hand, squeezing it gently before stepping back and aparating with a soft “pop.” </p><p>Harry had far from forgotten his encounter with the elegant woman, but was still surprised when an eagle owl tapped on his window the next Wednesday, an invitation to Sunday afternoon tea clutched in its beak. He’d eagerly accepted, and then kicked himself. What the hell was he supposed to do or say at a pureblood tea party? </p><p>Hermione and by extension, her newfound friend in Pansy Parkinson were the answer. The very loud, obnoxiously giggly answer. Maybe he shouldn’t have asked. </p><p>“Mama Malfoy invited you for tea?” Pansy looked entirely too delighted, sitting across the table at a small cafe not far from the Ministry Thursday afternoon.  </p><p>“Well technically I invited her but she... What is so funny?” Harry looked exasperatedly over the table at the Slytherin girl, who was wiping tears of laughter from her eyes. </p><p>“Draco is going to be furious!”</p><p>Harry’s stomach sank. Of course Draco would furious. He would also probably be there. It was his house. It was entirely possible Lucius would be there too. He was still on house arrest and still unable to leave the Manor. Dammit. He should have thought of this before accepting. </p><p>“Oh don’t look so put out. He wouldn’t dare say a word against her. We call her Mama Bear for a reason.” She sobered. “Though if you tell her we call her that, I’ll hex your bollocks off.”</p><p>Harry just held his hands up in surrender. “Look. I just need to know what to wear and say without looking like an idiot.”</p><p>Pansy raised one dark eyebrow and narrowed her eyes. “You’ve never worried about that before. Or did you forget asking if Senior Councilman Phillips if his wife was his daughter?”</p><p>Harry groaned. “And you think I want a repeat of that? You know what? Oh no. Something came up. I guess I’m going to have to cancel. Shame.” </p><p>Pansy rolled her eyes. “You’re just as dramatic as Draco.” She held her hand up to stop his protests. “I need to see your closet. Tomorrow, six o’clock. And don’t you dare cancel on Mrs Malfoy.” </p><p align="center">***</p><p>And that’s how Harry found himself standing in the doorway of his own bedroom, with Hermione sprawled over his bed with a book and Pansy bloody Parkinson rummaging through his possessions on a Friday night. </p><p>“Honestly Potter, don’t you know what a tailoring charm is?” Pansy held up a light blue oxford that he never wore. “Try this on.”</p><p>He huffed, taking the shirt and starting to retreat when Hermione piped up. </p><p>“Harry it’s just a shirt. I’ve seen you in far less and Pansy won’t bite.”</p><p>He grumbled a bit but stripped off his t-shirt anyway, trying to ignore the appreciative glances from Pansy. </p><p>“When did you get hot, Potter?” Pansy was staring openly now, her eyes raking suggestively over his bare chest. </p><p>“About the same time he figured out that you and I have the wrong anatomy for his fancy,” Hermione quipped in a bored tone over her book. “Harry you missed a button.”</p><p>He glowered at her, but fixed the off-set buttons. Pansy approached, tugging on the fabric here and there before whispering a few incantations. The fabric folded and stitched itself until it fit him perfectly. </p><p>“Much better. You actually don’t look like a slob.” Harry was relatively certain that it sounded even more condescending in her honeyed tone, but she was helping, so he stayed quiet. </p><p>“Your trousers actually fit quite well, so you’re fine there. I think if you wear the blue with these robes,” she tossed him a dark grey set, “you’ll be just fine.” </p><p>He pulled the robes on, turning to look at himself in the full-length mirror. </p><p>“She’s right. You look much better,” the enchanted mirror crooned at him. He glared at his own reflection. </p><p>“‘Mione?” She nodded with a small, worried smile. He knew that look. “What’s wrong?” </p><p>“I just... I don’t understand. Why?” </p><p>“Why do I care how I look?” His eyebrows pulled together. She’d been nagging him to dress better and tuck his shirt in since their second year at Hogwarts. </p><p>“Why are you going to Malfoy Manor?” This time he didn’t miss her right hand clutching at her left forearm. Oh. </p><p>“If I’m honest, I’d really rather not. But I do want to talk to Narcissa, and this might be my only opportunity.”</p><p>Pansy looked uncomfortable, a sight that was extremely odd to Harry. He’d thought the girl was virtually unshakable and indestructible. </p><p>“I just don’t understand why you can’t invite her here, or even meet her in public.” Hermione was sitting straight up, ready for a fight. </p><p>“Right because meeting at The Leaky Cauldron will put her right at ease for a conversation about her actions that nearly landed her entire family in Azkaban.”  Harry planted his feet, irritated now. </p><p>“They’re getting death threats,” Pansy said quietly, her pleading tone just as uncharacteristic as her discomfort had been. “From both sides.” </p><p>Hermione looked slightly abashed at that, and slumped back slightly. </p><p>“Look, ‘Mione. I just want to talk to her. If doing it on her turf is the cost, so be it. You and Ron know where I’ll be if it comes down to it, but I’m not afraid of her. Lucius wouldn’t dare touch me, he barely escaped Azkaban. And Draco...”</p><p>“Won’t be there anyway.” Pansy spoke up again, some of her confidence back. “He’s in France, finishing his NEWTs on an accelerated program with a personal tutor.” She paused. “He won’t be back til April.” Hermione still looked unconvinced, but sighed. </p><p>“I’m sending in the calvary if you’re so much as a minute late,” she huffed. </p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Fine.” </p>
