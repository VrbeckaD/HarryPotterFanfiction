    <p>Harry was not a strong person. Nor was he brave like everyone said. When the war had ended and he had killed Tom Riddle, he decided to leave the wizarding world.</p><p>He had enough. Not when so many died for him, he couldn’t handle it all. From holding funerals for his schoolmates and friends, making sure Ron’s family was okay after Fred’s death, to making sure everyone had a chance to recover from the war. It drowned him deep, so he looked for a way out. </p><p>His late friend, Ron had noticed that pretty early in his life and told him that he was a ‘doormat’ and shouldn’t let anyone run over him. He remembered how Ron would act like his mother and drag him down to the grand hall and eat breakfast, making sure he had enough to eat or distracted him enough to make him think instead of complying with any demands that Hermione made. He remembered how they got into fights often. One time ,one of the fights made Hermione cry, because all she did was complained and pushed Harry into stressful situations and Ron was not having it.</p><p>Power was intoxicating, he could see why people like Dumbledore and Tom Riddle succumbed to it. Harry knew it. He always had power, the money, the magic aptitude, and he had the prestige to make it all happen. But he didn’t know he had it and he was a fool for not realizing so as many paid for it. His conscience did not allow for such rest when he realized that. Not when he had held Cedric’s Body when Tom Riddle was resurrected, not when Colin’s body was found, camera and wand in hand to fight by his side. Not when he had to bury them all.</p><p>He ran from that world with his wand and clothes on his back and delved back into the Muggle World, traveling where he seen fit. He made it a goal to become a healer, one of the greatest so that no one would be able to die on his watch. He went through cities one by one, from Europe, to Asia, to America themselves. He met so many who didn’t know him and it felt relieving be just Harry, someone who had the strength to help. But soon enough he got himself entangled with something he had to quickly get out at first.</p><p>The Society of the Underworld was subtle and hidden enough that even the civilians treated them like they where myths. Stories of the past where crime was so rampant and chaotic. But Harry especially knew better, with his luck, trouble came to him. He had heard rumors of himself at that time, a strange kid who was able to heal even the most grievous of wounds and could save anyone from the brink of death. The acquaintance he made urged him to join a syndicate but he refused. When a nudge became a push, he got up and left again. Never seen again till two years later. </p><hr/><p> When he returned back into the wizarding world, all was not alright. Times had flew by and people were dying. No one knew what was happening and they hid like they had. Barely unrecognizable, he had to do something. So he plunged into his wealth, taking all of it, spending it on every book he could get, something to at least to do <em>something</em> about it. </p><p>But to no avail, he couldn’t save them all and in despair as he sat holding onto both Andromeda’s and her husband hands as they slowly died from the god forsaken disease that ate away their whole core, he was given custody of Teddy and a tray of gold coins that were not Galleons but a currency he used to use during the year he had disappeared. Andromeda told him that one of their relatives was a squib, living in America, somewhere in New York. They told him to run far, far away from the dying world that was slowly collapsing. To the last of his blood.</p><p>Chocked tears as he took Teddy from the now burning home of Andromeda and Ted’s beloved home.</p><p>And like a child, he cried as he walked away from his childhood.</p><hr/><p>Months passed by and he searched through New York, he had finally found the one that Andromeda has talked about. The son of their late uncle, Winston. They talked in the glass office that was of Winston’s, of what had happen and how he needed a place to stay to raise Teddy. In turn, Harry became an unofficial member of the staff at the New York Continental Branch. A loophole, Winston said, his amused gaze shared with one of his more trusted staff, Charon. He didn’t know what they meant but he had so much to be more concerned with that he decided to put on the side.</p><p>It was strange to say the least, he had no define role. He did whatever was needed at the time when no other could. Teddy was a hit with the women of the staff, always offering to babysit when he could not watch him. Meanwhile the men offered to teach him so he wouldn’t be bored with just filtering around being a self imposed secretary to Winston. Winston had been amused, but let it be as it seemed to change up routine, reminding himself that routine kills.</p><p>He never left the hotel for that year and next and eventually , he noticed there was someone who’s name kept coming up.</p><p>
  <em>John Wick.</em>
</p><hr/><p>Harry was running. Running into a direction opposite from the hotel, towards the maze of alleways that the injured man he found laying against the walls. Past the cars, the pedestrians(bumping into them, he gave quick apologies), the lights from cars and street lights and buildings till he reached the man dress in a dark suit heavily injured and sitting against the walls. The man held a gun at him but Harry was not deterred by it or by the many bodies slewed across the alleyway (Nothing held him back, not when he went through hell and back that was war).</p><p>He knelt down in front of him checking for what needed to be treated first. The blood seeping from the ribs told him of a deep stab wounds probably puncturing a lung and the wet shallow breathing told him he might not have time left if it was left unattended. </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Hey, I’m going to help. Just tell me where they hit you.” Harry looked at him, eyes stern learned from watching the late Madam Pomfrey. The man gazed at him with his dark eyes </span>before lowering his gun to his side and reveals the wounds. Harry thanked who ever was watching from above and got closer before inspecting the wound and considered his chances. The man needed help, but it would mean the possibility of being hunted again. He had no time to consider it, so he placed his hands over the wound and gather his magic. His hand glowed an eerie gold as he willed the wound to heal and close. The man hissed a bit and grunted as he stares at him as he healed the deep wound with curiosity, Harry shook his head and step away. </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry stood up, pulling the man’s arm, dragging him up from the ground, “Come on, let’s go where you want to go.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man had decided guided him into a series of alleyways (surprisingly still strong from such injuries and in a short amount of time from recovering) avoiding the main streets till they reached the same hotel that Harry had lived in for two years. Harry looked slightly surprise before deciding not to question as such, considering that the man he help was most likely part of the Underworld. They both enter the empty lobby of the Continental NYC, his cousin Winston waiting for him with staff awaiting to attend him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">”Winston.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">”Harry. Teddy is with Charon. I’ll handle this.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Winston gave a nearly noticeable small smile and gestured to the upper lounge where indeed Teddy gripping onto the rails, looking down, all anxious for his papa to return home. Charon stood by making sure Teddy didn’t slip through the rails.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry tries to ignore the weighted stare from the man as he goes upstairs and hug his distraught son. Harry knows that trouble will most likely come to find him again. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Just in a form he didn’t expect.</span>
