    <p>In the center of the room stood a large tree of vibrant green. A garland of icicles spiraled from bottom to top, suspended by floating gold thread. Colorful bobbles and twisty glass ornaments sparkled from the boughs and miniature brooms were charmed to fly in lazy zig zags and loops around the tree. With its size and sparkle, it made an impressive, festive, sight. Snape paid it a glance out of the corner of his eye as he made a brisk line to the bar. Black was left to follow a few paces behind.</p><p>When he reached the counter where Snape had come to stop, he brushed something off his coat and said a little out of breath, "trying to lose me?"</p><p>Snape raised an eyebrow, he hadn't thought that Black, with his abundance of energy, would be left a bit breathless by a fast-paced walk. "That would be impossible as we were headed to the same location. I wanted to get here quickly and finish this hour."</p><p>"Finish? The hour doesn't start until we're actually seated at the bar having a drink," Sirius said smugly. "Trying to weasel out of what we agreed to I see."</p><p>Snape didn't answer, just gave a sneer and rolled his eyes to the mounted clock on the wall. 4:30pm.</p><p>"Very well, Black." He turned one of the stools so he could pull himself into it and raised his eyebrow at the other who hadn't moved.</p><p>Eagerly, Sirius scrambled into the stool to Snape's right and gave Snape a glance before seeming to be satisfied.</p><p>He gave a wave to the bartender and said to Snape, "pick what you want."</p><p>Snape was sorely tempted to pick one of the most expensive liquors and then leave it untouched. However, he begrudgingly decided to pus the urge to the side and said, "butterbeer."</p><p>"Anything special in it?" The tender asked.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Sirius chimed, "Course not. You might slip up and have some fun for once." Snape clenched his fist and braced for the hour.</p><p>The tender turned to Sirius, "and for you sir?"</p><p>"Same as him accept add some fire whiskey. Got to start this new semester off on the wrong foot."</p><p>The tender gave a polite chuckle before going to fetch their drinks. This left the two men to sit quietly, listening to the chatter of the place. When about a minute passed (a very long minute) Sirius turned his upper body so to rest his elbow on the counter and chin in hand, facing Snape.</p><p>"So, what are you planning for the new semester?"</p><p>Snape could already feel a headache start, "I thought you said we didn't have to talk?"</p><p>"Yeah, but doesn't mean we can't. Come on, Severus, let me get to know you a bit, eh?" Thick, frothing, butterbeer was placed before them. Sirius snatched his up and began to take several eager gulps.</p><p>Half his mug was gone before he dropped his back to the counter and licked at the "mustache" he'd gotten.</p><p>"Thirsty?" Snape took up the handle of his mug and brought it to his lips slowly. He gave a delicate sip and enjoyed the instant warmth the creamy, sweet, drink brought.</p><p>Sirius lowered his gaze with a sheepish expression.</p><p>"Sorry. Ever since escaping Azkaban, the war, and then officially being free, I'm just trying to make up for lost time. Enjoy well-earned comforts <em>uninhibited."</em> There was an odd affliction to Black's words. A lightly husked, conspirial, lit that was barely perceivable and that Snape wasn't sure existed. Was Sirius leaning towards him?</p><p>"What are your creature comforts Severus?"</p><p>Snape took another small sip, keeping is body facing forward but turning his head toward's the other, "I thought you said we didn't have to talk?"</p><p>"We don't <em>have</em> to. But an hour's a long time to sit here. Might be nice to just get to know each other?"</p><p>Snape scoffed, "what could we possibly need to know about each other?"</p><p>"Well," Sirius gave another deep swig of his drink, "what's your favorite color?"</p><p>Snape blinked, "that's the question that has been burning up inside of you all this time? What's Snape's favorite color?"</p><p>Did Sirius waggle his eyebrows? "It's a start." He polished off his drink and ordered another.</p><p>"Do try not to get intoxicated Black, I have little interest in having to drag or levitate your drunken ass back to the castle."</p><p>Sirius barked out a laugh, "so shots are out?"</p><p>Snape pushed down a grin, "Indeed."</p><p>When the new drink arrived and Sirius paid, they drank slowly and said nothing for another five minutes before Sirius heard a clear, but soft, "Silver. My favorite color is silver."</p><p>"Mm, very nice."</p><p>"You?" If he was stuck here for another 45 minutes, might as well grin and bare awkward chatter.</p><p>"Purple."</p><p>Unexpectedly, an image of Sirius in his purple vest flashed in Snape's memory.</p><p>"It suits you."</p><p>Sirius blinked, "was that a compliment?"</p><p>"Don't read too much into it. You have such little going for you that I figured to throw you a bone."</p><p>Sirius laughed a bit longer and harder than earlier, "nice job with the dog reference. And you mean, aside from my good looks, I have little going for me?" Sirius winked and Snape rolled his eyes. Surprising he didn't feel affronted by Sirius' overt, jovial, flirtation.</p><p>"Egotistical arse."</p><p>Sirius shrugged and went to take off his coat. He wore some muggle shirt with a graphic on it that he didn't recognize. It was form fitting. Sirius, now settled into a comfortable life, had gained a much more healthy body. His arms actually had some muscle.</p><p>"Been working out. Push ups, sit ups, morning jogs." Snape jolted, he hadn't realized he'd been staring.</p><p>"I see. Perhaps this is why you're some of the students' favorite teacher." He didn't ask. Objectively, Sirius Black was handsome. To a number of his students, he was a handsome, charming, older man. Snape couldn't help occasionally hearing the inane chatter in the halls. Naturally, he had no such following and found it rather odd that any student would find any of the teachers appealing. Of course, if it had to be one, it would be Black.</p><p>"That and I don't deduct points for sneezing wrong." Sirius teased. He took another sip from his second drink before asking, "you hungry? I personally could go for some wings and prezels, but I'll settle for some of the stew. Hey, there's an idea. One of these weekends we should get to a muggle pub. I'll treat you to some good old-fashioned greasy junk."</p><p>"Clogging my arteries is not an ideal weekend."</p><p>"Neither was an hour at the pub with me yet we haven't tried to kill each other."</p><p>Snape took another sip, "There is still a half hour. Give it time," that time, he did allow a little upturn of his lips. It usually was difficult for the two of them to be in the same room with one another. Only within the last few months were they able to tolerate one another, and within the last week, with Black's strange advances of kindness, were they able to talk to one another.</p><p>Sirius ordered both of them a portion of rich beef stew and while they were waiting for it to come, Sirius leaned back in his chair.</p><p>"You know, we should actually talk about the whole trying to kill each other thing."</p><p>Snape felt his fingers tighten on the handle of his mug, "I'd rather we didn't."</p><p>"I'd rather we did. But rather than taint this outing, I'll save it for another. When we're actually prepared to talk about it."</p><p>Snape gave that a thought, "<em>another</em>? You expect <em>more</em> outings?"</p><p>"Of course. Told you, want to get to know you. Mend bridges and all that."</p><p>"I'm..." for the first time in a long time Snape was lost for words, "I'm not sure they can be." It was a testament to the relaxing effects of butterbeer, to his own tired mind after such a difficult life, that he slipped and let himself be open like this. Let alone doing it in front of Sirius Black.</p><p>Sirius finished his second butterbeer and said quietly, "They could be."</p><p>Their stew arrived and they ate without so much as looking at each other.</p><p>When they were finished, food was paid for, Sirius asked, "so, I know your favorite color, but what is your favorite...desert?"</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Really. Molly's been teaching me about cooking and baking. I'm not half bad."</p><p>"And you want to make me something?"</p><p>"Maybe. Promise I'll only put half the typical dose of poison."</p><p>"No thank you, Black. I...appreciate the offer, but I am more than satisfied with your recent gifts."</p><p>Sirius pouted and Snape could swear it was almost puppy-like, "I <em>want</em> to make you something Sev."</p><p>"It's Sev now, is it? I don't remember giving you permission to be so informal with me."</p><p>"Sorry, Severus." Sirius batted his eyes at him.</p><p>"I'm still not calling you anything other than Black."</p><p>"You will eventually. I can be convincing." He glanced up at the wall, "look at that, an hour and ten minutes. A record for us." Sirius rose and pulled on his jacket, "next time let's go for two." He gave a little wave and proceeded to leave a rather dumbfounded Snape behind.</p><p>Â </p>
