    <p>Dear former students of Hogwarts,</p><p>I would like to invite you and your families to attend Hogwarts for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Second Wizarding War, on the thirtieth of May at 11 a.m.</p><p>In the memory of this event a friendly Quidditch match will be held between the biggest rivals of Hogwarts; Slytherin and Gryffindor, at 2 p.m. the same day. The list of players will be given to the captains of the team, whom i have chosen.</p><p>Moreover, there will be an opening of a War Memorial for the martyrs and war veterans, followed by a masquerade ball. Your presence at this event is mandatory.</p><p>I am looking forward to seeing you all.</p><p>Yours faithfully,</p><p>Minerva McGonagall</p><p>Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</p><p>.....</p><p>A nervous looking Draco Malfoy stood on the front doorstep of the Goyle Mansion, waiting for the door to be opened. After fifteen long minutes of waiting, the door was finally opened, revealing a bulky Gregory Goyle. Draco followed him inside hesitantly and found himself in the drawing room, where the rest of the Quidditch Team sat. looking warily at him. After the War, he had lost contact with his friends as he had wanted to start all over again. Now, ten years later, here he was, in one of his former friend's house, with the rest of his other former friends.</p><p>"So, let's discuss our tactics." Draco said in a businesslike voice, as he sat down at the head of the table where the others sat and unscrolled the game plan on the table. For some unknown reason McGonagall had made him the Captain of the Slytherin team, and he had been shocked about it. The last thing he wanted was to socialize with them once again. But, here he was doing the same thing he had vowed himself not to do. "But first, we've to know which positions you'll all play."</p><p>The rest of the members looked at one another. They had been relieved when Draco had written to them after a longtime telling that he had been made Captain of their team and that they were also a part of it. However, they were surprised when Draco had told them that they can't meet at the Malfoy Manor (like they used to do when they were kids) and that they have to arrange their little meeting at one of their homes. In the end, all of them had agreed to host the meeting at Goyle Mansion. Their hopes of coming on good terms with Draco again, had shattered as they heard the formalness of his tone when he had spoken to them. They felt like they were acquaintances with him, not friends.</p><p>"We've already come up with some plans and have noted down our positions, as well. Here," Blaise said lightly as he passed a parchment towards Draco, who took it and examined it carefully. "I hope this is fine with you."</p><p>"Let's see." Draco said, scanning through the names. "Chasers; Blaise, Theo and Marcus, Beaters; Goyle and Montague, Keeper; Warrington and Seeker; Me. That will do. So, as the match is in two days time, we've little time to practice. I want all of you to be in good spirits and no matter what we have to beat Gryffindor this time.</p><p>"If possible, I request from you all to take leave from work as we could have a fair amount of time to practice then. What do you think?" Draco looked around the faces of everyone expectantly.</p><p>"I think that's a good idea." Theo agreed after a moment of pondering over his own thoughts. "We really do need to win this time. When do we start practicing?"</p><p>"If you've no problem, let's begin now." Draco said, even though he really wanted to go home and be with his family. Three quarters of an hour had passed and he already had started missing them.</p><p>"Now is fine." Everyone agreed and all of them sat out to the back garden to start off their practice.</p><p>.....</p><p>"Why with the slytherins, though?" Ron complained for the umpteenth time as Harry went over their game plan.</p><p>"For  the hundredth time, because we are the biggest rivals!" Ginny snapped at her brother. Sure enough, ever since they started the meeting at number twelve Grimmauld place, her brother had been getting on her nerves. "And if you complain one more time, I'll hex you into oblivion."</p><p>Everyone chuckled as they watched the sister-brother confrontation. It had been two hours and all of them had decided to play the position they had played when they were  in Hogwarts. Alicia, Katie and Demelza as chasers, (Angelina had kindly declined the offer as she was pregnant with her and George Weasly's second child. Instead of her Alicia was taking the position after a lot of begging as she lives abroad with her husband, Oliver Wood, who was now in a training camp with his team in the states. Ginny also being pregnant with her and Harry's third child had to decline the offer and instead of her Demelza was taken into the team), George and Jimmy peakes as Beaters, Ron as keeper and lastly, Harry as the seeker. To no one's surprise he was the captain of the Gryffindor team.</p><p>"Where's my partner in lawbreaking, Jamie?" George looked around and said, "I haven't seen him since I arrived. Is he hiding in his bedroom with Al?"</p><p>"He and Al are with Mum." Ginny said grumpily. "I don't want James to be left alone while we are all here. Merlin knows what he'll be up to if I leave him just for one second even. Always up to some mischief or the other. He's only three but now even he's a mastermind in playing pranks. Maybe naming him 'James Sirius' Potter was a big mistake. He is I'm sure just like his grandfather James and his best friend Sirius.</p><p>"On the other hand, thank Merlin, Al is an angel. I named him 'Albus Severus' Potter. He surely is disciplined. He's barely two and I always find him with a book." Ginny finished her ranting with a sigh.</p><p>"Al sounds like Hermoine." George mumbled to himself thoughtlessly, but everyone heard.</p><p>"I'm happy for that." Harry and Ginny said together and laughed.</p><p>"It makes him more tolerant."</p><p>"Hello! We're talking about Quidditch here!" Ron said heatedly."Not about Hermoine insufferable know-it-all Granger."</p><p>"Ron!" Harry said warningly.</p><p>"What?!" Ron exclaimed. "She abandoned us when we needed her most. So don't talk about her infront of me."</p><p>"She did not leave us!" Ginny shouted at her brother. "She was there for us when we were broken. She took care of us. She helped us get over the grief of losing our loved ones. She made us whole again. But, how did we repay her? When she did so much for us, did we pay attention to her? Did we even for once ask her how she felt? No. We never did. We were too selfish to understand her. We healed but she didn't. She was broken. And what did we do? We left her. We didn't even try to reach for her. We deserve this. We've to accept that we no longer are a part of her life. That's the simple truth. Because, we hurt her."</p><p>Harry put a consoling arm around his wife, who was now in tears.</p><p>"We didn't hurt her." Ron snapped at her. "She did. Eight long years. Did she write to us? No. Did she attend your wedding? Or George's? Or mine? No. Did she come home when we became parents? No. Then why should you defend her, when all she did was hurt you? Why?"</p><p>"Because she was there for all of us during the worst times of our lives. And she never knew that we'd married and become parents, because when she WROTE us we never did reply." Ginny said through tears.</p><p>"We're here to talk about Quidditch and nothing else." Harry said quickly, coming for his wife's rescue, knowing that her moods were rather unpredictable during her pregnancy. "Now that we have come up with strategies, let's start our practice. The woods near the Burrow will be a good place."</p><p>"Yeah," George piped in."I would love to wipe off the smirk from old Draco's face." And off they went to practice, wanting to flatten the Slytherin team, more than ever.</p>
