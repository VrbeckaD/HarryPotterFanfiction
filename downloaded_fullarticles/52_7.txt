    <p>
  <span>Hermione sat down in Ron’s desk chair. Harry was off at Quidditch practice, so it was just the two of them- her and Ron- for the time being. A very small part of her was nervous about this– after all, it had not been long at all since they had all bonded together on Halloween. And without Harry there, things felt </span>
  <em>
    <span>off</span>
  </em>
  <span>, like a piece of their puzzle was missing. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>This wouldn’t do, of course. Harry and Ron were </span>
  <em>
    <span>both</span>
  </em>
  <span> her friends. Hermione just needed to spend more time with Ron so that they were more comfortable together. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Today she was prepared with a plan. A plan to make her friendship with Ron </span>
  <em>
    <span>better</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So Harry is going to be gone for a while,” Hermione said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yup,” Ron agreed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And we’re all done with our homework,” Hermione continued, a small glow of accomplishment filling her chest. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Er…yes…” said Ron, looking away and fidgeting.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you want to play any games, then?” Hermione asked, her heart beginning to pound a little as she got to the point. “Like, maybe, we could play house?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As she suggested it, she watched Ron’s expression, her fingers crossed behind her back, hoping he wouldn’t scoff and roll his eyes as so many boys she had known would. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron heaved a sigh and Hermione’s heart dropped– sure that he was about to mock her–</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright,” he said, “but I get to be the dad.” He crossed his arms at this, his features set in a mulish expression.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh–” Hermione said, startled. “Yes, of course you can be the dad! I’ll be the mom, obviously, so we just need a baby.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione already knew who she wanted to be the baby, but she thought it would make Ron feel more included and interested in the game if she asked for his input. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron glanced over at Harry’s bed. “What if, what about Harry?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione beamed. “I was thinking the same thing! Only, we can’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>tell</span>
  </em>
  <span> him.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron nodded, the motion emphatic. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It hit Hermione, then, that her plan had gone off without a hitch. She had always wanted friends to play house with, but the other students at her primary school had never </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually</span>
  </em>
  <span> wanted her to play with them. Whenever she would try to join their games, they’d either ignore her completely or they’d make her be the family ferret. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Over the years, Hermione had managed to mostly squash her desire to play house– to have friends to play house with– until she had gotten to know Harry. Something about Harry had awoken the urge again. So when Hermione had been making her plan to bond with Ron, the idea struck to do it by playing house with him. And now that her plan had succeeded, she would have to record this in her journal, because it wouldn’t do to forget about it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait– but Harry’s not here now,” Ron said, frowning. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s alright! We can just get started now and, you know, keep going later, once Harry’s back.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Uh, okay.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’ll just be that much more fun this way!” Hermione rushed to explain. “Because Harry is </span>
  <em>
    <span>real</span>
  </em>
  <span> and he’s the perfect baby for playing house and–” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Right,” Ron interrupted, “so Harry’s the baby and, and he’s off at school. What now?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione shoved herself off the chair and bounced over to Harry’s wardrobe. “I’ve noticed,” she said, opening the wardrobe, “that our son is in dire need of a new wardrobe. Now we don’t have the budget to just replace everything, but I thought we could learn how to mend clothing–” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That’ll take ages!” Ron protested. “And, uh, don’t I have work to get to? Because I’m the dad?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, you think that because you’re the dad, you’re the one who has the job?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, yes,” Ron said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Women have jobs too, you know. But in this case neither of us have a job,” Hermione said, prim, as she started to pull Harry’s clothes out of his wardrobe. “We’re both stay-at-home parents. That’s why we have to mend Harry’s clothes, rather than just getting him all new ones.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So neither of us have a job?” Ron asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione nodded, scrunching her face slightly at the state of the clothes she was removing from Harry’s wardrobe. They seemed even worse, somehow, now that Harry wasn’t wearing them.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Huh. I guess that’s kinda nice– to not have to work and all.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, we do have work,” Hermione said. “It’s making sure our son is well taken care of.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione had finished pulling all of Harry’s clothes from the wardrobe and had sat down to sort the rest. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron sat down next to her and gestured at the piles. “Alright, I get it. So what do these mean?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione pointed at the first pile. “Garbage.” Then the next, “Salvageable, but needs a lot of work. That pile just needs mending. That one needs to be resized. And,” she picked up the single shirt that constituted the last pile, “this one needs no work at all.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron took the shirt from her. “This is it?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Then Ron picked up a sorry excuse for a pair of trousers from the garbage pile. “You know, we could probably use this stuff to help mend this stuff,” he said, gesturing at the ‘mend-only pile’. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione tilted her head to the side. “Oh, I hadn’t thought of that. That’s–” she swallowed, shoving down the shock that had been about to color her tone. “That’s a really good idea.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A smile crossed Ron’s face. “I can occasionally have those.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione took the single shirt back, then started packing the rest of Harry’s clothes into a bag she’d brought just for this purpose. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait, what’s Harry going to wear while we’re still working on fixing the rest of his clothes?” Ron asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>This was the second trickiest part of Hermione’s plan. The first was, of course, had been getting Ron to agree to play house in the first place. “Well,” she began delicately, “I was thinking you could lend him some of your clothes. Just for a little while!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh,” Ron said. “Oh, okay. That works.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione turned to look at him. “And– and you’re okay with that?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron shrugged, uncomfortable. “I am used to it, aren’t I? With five older brothers, you kinda have to be.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And besides,” Hermione added, more confident now that he had agreed, “it shouldn’t be too long that Harry’s borrowing your clothes, and it’s only on the weekend that he’ll need them anyways.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron nodded. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione finished packing Harry’s clothes into her bag. Then she got up and went over to Ron’s wardrobe. “I am going to pick out some of your clothes to put in Harry’s wardrobe.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron came over to help, and in no time at all, they had a small pile of usable clothes stowed away for Harry to wear. They wouldn’t fit perfectly, but they would fit better than the rags she and Ron were going to fix. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Then Hermione started to make Harry’s bed. “So I was thinking,” she began. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You seem to do that a lot,” Ron said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ha ha,” Hermione said, mocking. “Anyways, I was thinking that maybe you could help comb Harry’s hair. And, and at meals, we can make sure Harry’s eating well, because it’s so important for our baby to eat well. And maybe we could tuck him in sometimes?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And you think we could do all that without Ha– without our son noticing?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course we can. If he says anything, we can just tell him that this is what friends do!” Hermione said. “It’ll be fun!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron seemed to think this over for a moment. “I guess he wouldn’t really know any better, would he? And– it’s not like we’d be playing a </span>
  <em>
    <span>mean</span>
  </em>
  <span> game without telling him…” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s right! It </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> a nice game!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“D’you think we have time to get started on figuring out how to fix his clothes before he gets back?” Ron asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione pulled out her wand and cast </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tempus.</span>
  </em>
  <span> She thought for a moment before nodding. “Yes, I do think we have time. This </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>going to involve research in the library, but since we </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> stay-at-home parents, we have plenty of time to get it done.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron sighed as Hermione collected her bag and headed for the door. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“The things I do for our son,” Ron said, exasperated. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ron,” Harry said, holding up one of the shirts Ron and Hermione had put in his wardrobe, “where are my clothes?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Er–” Ron began. He should have made sure Hermione was going to be here for this moment, but after they’d finished up in the library, she’d gone up to bed. “They– they were taken away for cleaning while you were at Quidditch practice, and– and Hermione and I saw, so we went ahead and gave you some of my clothes to borrow.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But– what about my clothes? I– those are my only clothes!” Harry said, absently wringing Ron’s shirt in his hands. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’ll be okay, Harry,” Ron said. He got up and put his hand on Harry’s shoulder, reassuring. “Your clothes will be back– better than ever!– in no time.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry still looked uncertain. “And you’re sure you don’t mind me borrowing your clothes?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron looked at Harry, incredulous. “Of course not, mate. I put my clothes there, didn’t I?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry continued to stand there, shoulder tense under Ron’s palm. They stood there in silence for several long, empty moments until Ron felt him slowly relax. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, thank you,” Harry said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron released Harry’s shoulder. Harry smoothed out the shirt he’d been clutching and replaced it in his wardrobe. Then he collected an outfit and headed into the showers. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron sighed with relief, glad that Harry had bought the story. Hermione wouldn’t like it much if Ron gave the game up so soon. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When he heard the shower shut off, Ron remembered one of the other things Hermione wanted to do to play house. So he went and dug around in his drawers for his comb. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He gave Harry a few minutes, just to be sure that Harry would be dressed and everything, then hurried into the loo. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey, Harry,” Ron said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ron!” exclaimed Harry, startled. “What are you doing?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron had the fleeting thought that he ought to try and think of a more subtle way to put this, and then he tossed the thought out. “I’m going to help you comb your hair.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry had resumed the process of doing up the buttons on the pajama top that Ron had lent him. At Ron’s statement, he stopped once more, and gave Ron an odd look. “You’re going to… comb my hair?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Er– you know that’s a lost cause, right?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron shrugged. “Just let it happen, Harry.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, let me finish buttoning up my top, though,” Harry said as he hurried through the last couple of buttons. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron stepped closer to Harry, then gently turned him around so that they were facing each other. Ron’s hand was still clenched around the comb, but surveying the mess that was Harry’s hair, he stowed it in his pocket. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Giving up already?” asked Harry, quirking a sideways smile. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Ron said, and then he attacked. He ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, somewhat systematically trying to impose some order on the recalcitrant locks of hair. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s not going to work!” Harry protested. He tried to shrink away from Ron’s ministrations, but he failed once his back hit the bathroom sink. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ron shushed him, brow furrowed in concentration. “I’ve got this,” Ron said, distracted. And he did, thanks to years of practice performing this very same function for Ginny in the various games of dress-up and house that she coerced him into playing. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Once Harry’s hair became less resistant to Ron’s fingers, Ron pulled out his comb again. Harry was short enough– not much taller than Ginny, really– that Ron didn’t even need to force him into a seat to comb his hair. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Just like when he brushed Ginny’s hair, Ron started by getting all the ends detangled, then moved on to the roots. Once Ron had pulled out the comb, Harry had stopped fighting, but for a bit of grumbling. And the first time Ron managed to run the comb through from root to end without it catching, Harry fell silent, eyes wide. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When Ron was finished, he rinsed the comb off in the sink, then ran it through his own hair. “See,” he said, “no big deal.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry was looking at him with a shell-shocked expression on his face. “How did you do that?” he asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You met Ginny– she loves making me do stuff like that,” Ron said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, thank you,” Harry said, his expression of shock shifting to one of gratitude. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re welcome.” </span>
