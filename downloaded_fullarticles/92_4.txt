    <p>“So, you just did what now?”</p>
<p>Harry smiled, and it was a wanton smile, just dripping with secrets. “I just Obliviated you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, good.” Ginny felt relieved. “So it worked.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, erm… I did it just the way you said.” Harry’s wand was still in his hand, Ginny noticed, so he must’ve done it recently. Not that she could remember.</p>
<p>“And what did I say, exactly?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, God.” Harry looked crestfallen. “Did I erase too much? How much do you remember?”</p>
<p>“I remember lunch,” Ginny said thoughtfully, trying to grasp at details. “I ate a sandwich, I think. That’s about it.”</p>
<p>“I did too much,” Harry groaned. “Now we can’t go through with it…”</p>
<p>“Wait, go through with what?”</p>
<p>“And you practically <em> begged </em>me to do it…”</p>
<p>“Do <em> what? </em>” Ginny was starting to get annoyed. “Dammit Potter, tell me.”</p>
<p>Harry let out a shaky smile. “Well, alright. If you insist.” Harry reached behind him and pulled out a book emblazoned with the words <em> Fingers, Smells, and Shivering Spells: How To Please Your Witch. </em> A thoroughly embarrassing title, but he didn’t even blush, flipping to a page marked by a little bookmark with a flower sketched on the end. <em> My bookmark, </em>Ginny realized. </p>
<p>Memory slammed into her with the force of a sledgehammer. “Wait, I know that book!” she exclaimed. A crystal-clear picture appeared in front of her eyes: she was sitting at her kitchen table, sipping at her morning tea, reading through the inscriptions and letting her right hand drop ever lower beneath her skirts…</p>
<p>Ginny flushed. <em> Oh. </em> She could tell she was going to like whatever her past self had picked out for her.</p>
<p>Harry looked up. “Merlin, I haven’t seen you blush like that in years,” he said, laughing.</p>
<p>Ginny hit him lightly. “Shut up,” she replied, but it was true.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Harry began, tracing the words on the page with one long, smooth finger--</p>
<p>
  <em> (how it would feel to have that inside me…) </em>
</p>
<p>--and reading them aloud. <em> “Unum Mandatum, </em> ” he read. “A spell that, if applied with a firm <em> Obliviate, </em> can be most pleasing to a witch that likes to beg for her pleasure.” A red heat began to climb up his neck, but he carried on. “Pick a word, any word that you can count on yourself not saying in common conversation. Then, simply sit your lover down, rub the assorted list of oils listed below on her sensitive spots, and utter the spell, thinking of your word. Begin to pleasure her until she reaches her apex, and then whisper your Command Word into her ear. Wait a few minutes, then Obliviate. Wait until your witch has come back into her senses, and the spell is truly ready to -- pardon my Muggle saying -- work its magic.”</p>
<p>“What, then?” Ginny asked, mystified. “What does it do to me?” But she had a warm, stirring feeling in her gut that told her she already knew.</p>
<p>Harry put the book aside. “You can’t orgasm until I say this word to you,” he said bluntly.</p>
<p>“What?” Ginny gaped. She flushed again. “No <em> way </em> -- You don’t have that much control over me, Potter, you only <em> wish </em> you did. Just watch, I’ll do it just fine on my own.” Indignant, Ginny flipped a strand of red hair over her shoulder. The <em> nerve </em>of him, even to suggest it-!</p>
<p>Harry’s eyebrows lifted. He appeared to be trying very hard not to laugh.</p>
<p>Ginny changed out of her robes quickly. She went to her drawer and pulled out her vibrator, the slim blue one with the slick sides. It was a reliable choice; it had never failed her before. And she knew her body better than anyone, at least better than her lovely, yet stupid, <em> stupid </em> husband. She pushed it in gently, sighing as the first jolts of pleasure swept through her. <em> Yessss, </em> she knew better… It hummed inside her, and she pushed it in further, first slowly, then, as that singing feeling of friction built up she grabbed it and shoved it in, rough, back and forth, the way she would want to be fucked, hot and rough and messy, and <em> Bloody hell, she was going to-- </em></p>
<p>And then she didn’t.</p>
<p>She stopped, confused, and shoved it up again.</p>
<p>A burst of pleasure; and then nothing.</p>
<p>
  <em> What in the world-- </em>
</p>
<p>Harry’s laugh tore through her consternation. “I told you,” he gloated, but Ginny was far from giving up.</p>
<p>“Blasted--” she hit the vibrator once with her palm, like she was trying to kickstart an engine. “--<em> thing…” </em> She grit her teeth. She’d been so close, it was <em> infuriating. </em> Sighing, she pulled it out in surrender.</p>
<p>Harry stared down at her, smirking, the goddamned prick.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Harry had a better success rate than the vibrator, which was wont to list sometimes in the wrong directions. As much as it pained her to admit it, she was not going to prove herself wrong. She would orgasm. Without him saying his stupid word.</p>
<p>“Take your clothes off,” she snapped, and she was already wet, <em> yes, </em>this was going to work splendidly. He was so beautiful underneath his clothes, all smooth, rolling muscle and his dick was round and plump and hard enough for her to sink her teeth into, not that she would actually do it.</p>
<p>Harry mounted her with grinning enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare say the word,” Ginny snarled in his ear. She bit into it, hard, and Harry let out a moan of pain and pleasure. “Don’t you dare say it, I’m going to orgasm without it, I <em> will </em>and then you’ll be wrong.”</p>
<p>“Keep telling yourself that,” Harry smiled, then thrusted hard and deep into her, his ugly smirk contorted into a grimace of want. Harry felt so good inside her and Ginny seized on that, moving with the <em> pulse pulse pulse </em>of his smooth, perfect dick sliding into the darkest recesses of her body and her mind, carrying her away into--</p>
<p>Ginny blinked. </p>
<p>“Dammit!” she swore.</p>
<p>Harry pulled himself off of her with some effort. He collapsed on the ground, his hand pumping furiously away at his erection, and he groaned and Ginny watched with growing envy as he released and bits of semen shined like jewels against that plump perfect thing.</p>
<p>But even as Harry sat there, panting his way out of ecstasy, he still had that stupid fucking grin on his face. “I told you. You’re <em> mine. </em>”</p>
