          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus and Minerva were sitting in the staffroom, everyone else had retired for the night; only the dying fire of the orange glow of embers that crackled softly behind them could be heard. They sat opposite each other, both leaning forward over a chessboard. They have played a couple of games, both winning and losing a game.</p><p> </p><p>"So, what do you think of the new DADA teacher?' asks Minerva, as she moved her castle to take Snape's pawn.</p><p> </p><p>Severus snorted "He's a bloody moron! He was a moron at school and he'll be a bigger moron now. The kids will learn fuck all. How will HE help them in defending themselves.' He rambled, as he observed the board to consider his next move.</p><p> </p><p>'Why, be careful, Severus, it almost sounds like you care.' She said, which he chose to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>'Why on earth Dumbledore hired HIM I do not know. What's wrong with that man? Who's next, a werewolf?" he replied taking her just placed castle, with his Bishop. "How we will put up with Lockhart for a year I don't know," he said with a roll of his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Severus, "It will be entertaining, nonetheless. We can have a bit of fun of our own," a mischievous smile formed on her face.</p><p> </p><p>She stood suddenly to leave 'Where do you think you're going? Get back here and finish what you started. ' Severus frowned, pointing at the board. 'Don't be running away now that you're losing.'</p><p>'Severus, I'm going to the kitchens.' she rolled her eyes at him; she could easily call the house-elves but sometimes she just liked the walk to the kitchen, that and to see if any Hufflepuffs were sneaking out down there. 'Do you want anything?' she asked.</p><p> </p><p>'I'll have a Firewhisky' he replied softly, as he sat back in the worn high-backed armchair.</p><p> </p><p>She got to the door about to leave, looked back and said 'What if they don't have it?'</p><p> </p><p>'Then go somewhere that does.' Oozing sarcasm, with a smirk curved on his lips.</p><p> </p><p>Minerva left, slowing shaking her head.</p></div>
