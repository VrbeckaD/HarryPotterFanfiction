  <em> Oh no, we can’t slow down, we can’t hold back </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Though you know, we wish we could </em>

</p><p> </p><p>The music swam lazily to the surface through the static, drifting through the roar of the motorcycle. Wide open desert surrounded the couple for miles, stretching on, orange and red, ad infinitum. It was a nice change of scenery after years stuck in the endless dark in England.</p><p>Coming to America had been the best decision Harry and Draco had made since Voldemort had gained power in England. After the Battle of Hogwarts, when only a handful had stood surrounded by the dead, Voldemort had seized power of both Wizarding and Muggle England.</p><p>Six years, they’d stayed and fought. Six years of continuous war, hiding and fighting, and dodging spells and bullets alike. When they’d realized Voldemort couldn’t be defeated, that he would eventually absorb the rest of the Isles, even the Boy Who Lived had fled.</p><p>Not much was left for him in England anymore.</p><p>He’d watched too many people he loved die. Once Voldemort had taken over Ireland, Harry and Draco had called it quits and caught the next plane out of the country with charmed papers to get through customs. Sirius’ motorcycle had made it easily to the States in Harry’s bag, undetectably small in his bag, warded against muggle tech.</p><p>So now here they were, racing across the Midwest to nowhere.</p><p>Draco shifted closer to Harry, their leather jackets creaking together. The blond’s sunglasses dug into Harry’s back in a comforting kind of way.</p><p> </p><p>
