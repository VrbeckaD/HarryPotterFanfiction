    <p>… Lily and James at Hogwarts, checking for the baby.<br/>"You're about five months along, honey. I can even tell you the gender, if you would like to know.",said a nice woman known as Poppy Pomfrey, Medi-witch of Hogwarts.</p><p>James and Lily looked at each other and said together:"We want it to be a surprise."</p><p>Pomfrey nodded with a small smile and said:"Well, I can assure you, your child is very healthy."</p><p>James and Lily smiled, already getting ready to go back to their house.<br/>31st July 1980 in Godric's Hollow, West-Country, England/Great Britain<br/>"Alright honey, you're doing great. If I say push, you've got to push. OK?",said Pomfrey.</p><p>"You'll be alright, My Lovely flower. I know it.",said James with such trust and love.</p><p>Sadly, a pregnant woman that's in labor, often isn't really nice and Lili yelled at her husband:"YOU ARE NEVER GETTING BACK INTO OUR FUCKING BED EVER AGAIN, JAMES POTTER. I WILL FUCKING MAKE SURE OF THAT, MISTER!"</p><p>"Yes Ma'am!",said *coughSqueakedcough* James to his wife.</p><p>"PUSH!",yelled Pomfrey suddenly and Lily did as she was told.</p><p>"I see the head! Just one more push in three… two… one… NOW!",said Pomfrey to Lily and James.</p><p>Lily did as she was told and was greeted with a baby's crying and Pomfrey telling her:"Congratulations. You have a baby girl."</p><p>But before they could celebrate, Lily screamed again and yelled:"THIS IS ALL YOUR DAMN, IDIOTIC, FUCKING FAULT, POTTER. IF I WASN'T HAVING FUCKING CONTRAPTIONS RIGHT NOW, I WOULD'VE FUCKING CASTRATED YOU HERE, RIGHT ON THAT DAMN SPOT! OF COURSE, I'M PREGNANT WITH FUCKING TWINS!"</p><p>"D-Dear, p-please. I didn't know t-that would happen. T-the P-P-Potters never h-had more t-t-than one child.",said James while stuttering a little in fear.<br/>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br/>Two hours later…<br/>"Lily, congratulations. You have a boy.",said Pomfrey with a smile.</p><p>James relaxed a little when his wife relaxed too and thought it was a good time to kiss, only to hear Lily yell:"YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! ANOTHER ONE?!"</p><p>At those words, James fainted from shock, only hearing his wife yell:"YOU'RE FAINTING?! HOW ABOUT ME? I CARRIED THOSE THREE FOR SEVEN MONTHS IDIOT! YOU DAMN WHIMP!"<br/>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br/>Another two hours later…<br/>"And again. Concgratulations with your third child, a girl!",said Pomfrey, while really hoping she was the last child.</p><p>Lily relaxed again but this time, James and Pomfrey waited for another hour before they were sure that another baby wouldn't come and Pomfrey even made a scan and said:"Well, it looks like you just gave birth to triplets. What would their name be?"</p><p>"Our first surprise will be named Lisa Euphemia Potter. Our next surprise, Hadrian James Potter and our third surprise will be known as Samantha Dorea Potter.<br/>Halloween 31st October 1981 Age: 1 1/2<br/>Once upon a Halloween night, there was a family of five, two adults and three children, in a small house. The oldest child was a girl with the name, Lisa Euphemia Potter, after her grandmother on their father's side. Then, the second oldest was a boy with the name, Harry James Potter and lastly, the youngest, Samantha Dorea Potter. It was peaceful for a long while until someone burst into their home. The man/creature had a face like a snake and no nose. He's also known as Lord Voldemort or as his followers call him, Dark Lord!</p><p>"LILY! GET THE KIDS TO SAFETY!",yelled their father, also known as James Potter while trying to hold Voldemort busy.</p><p>Their mother, Lily Evans-Potter ran upstairs to the three cribs and barricaded the room. She took her and James daughters, Lisa and Samantha out of their crib and laid them to their only son, Harry. There was suddenly a loud boom and a scream from James and then, it was silent. Just as Lily had laid Lisa and Samantha in Harry's crib, the door exploded open and woke the two girls up. Harry was the whole time awake and just looked bored at Voldemort.</p><p>"Get out of the way, you foolish woman.",said Voldemort to Lily.</p><p>Lili stood in front of the crib and pleaded:"Please, spare my children and take me."</p><p>Voldemort glared and said:"Last chance Mudblood. Get away from the crib or suffer the consequences."</p><p>"I will stay right here and protect my children.",said Lily with her Gryffindore courage, figuring out that begging doesn't work for Voldemort.</p><p>Voldemort sighed and said:"Very well. AVADA KEDAVRA!"</p><p>Lily fell on the ground, dead in an instance but Voldemort heard a giggle from the crib and saw how the two girls were just playing with each other. Voldemort got ticked off that two small babies didn't fear him and went to kill them with the Avada Kedavra spell, only to hit Harry. But Harry didn't die, the spell bounced off of him and back to Voldemort. Voldemort screamed in pain for a second until he vanquished into dust, leaving as evidence his clothes and a lightning scar on Harry's head.</p><p>On that moment came Harry's godfather (and their suregate uncle) inside, only to walk back downstairs and chasing the rat who sold their friends to Voldemort, Peter Pettigrew. But what he didn't know, was that after he chased Pettigrew, he would be framed for murdering 13 muggles, other word for non-magical people, and the murder of Peter Pettigrew himself. And, of course, the traitor who helped the murderer of James and Lili Potter.<br/>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br/>Some hours later...<br/>"I really don't think you should bring those three children to these muggles. They are one of the worst kind. I have watched them all day and can tell you, that they aren't able to be good for them.",said an older lady, also known as Minevra McGonagall, Head of the Gryffindore house.</p><p>The older man's, famous as Albus Dumbledore or Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, eyes twinkled for a moment and said:"Hush dear, no need to worry. I'm certain that they aren't that bad. You'll see."</p><p>"Where are they anyway?",asked McGonagall.</p><p>"They are getting here with Hagrid and his Motorcycle.",said Albus Dumbledore calmly.</p><p>McGonagall looked ready to rip him to pieces and asked in a restrained whisper:"You let Hagrid handle the children with his Motorcycle?! I think, I'm going to need to lie down later."</p><p>"No need to worry, my dear. The children are save with Hagrid. You'll see. Ah! And there he is.",said Dumbledore with a smile and his twinkling eyes.</p><p>McGonagall looked irrigated and thought:'Someday, I'm going to hit him with a curse for those twinkling eyes of his.'</p><p>At that moment, Hagrid landed with his Motorcycle and Dumbledore asked him if everything went OK. Hagrid nodded and told him how Lisa was the whole time asleep with Harry and Samantha was squealing and just wouldn't go to sleep. McGonagall frowned and asked Hagrid how long they slept. Hagrid told McGonagall that Samantha slept until three o'clock while Harry and Lisa slept almost two and a half hours.</p><p>Now, it was Dumbledore's turn to frowned in concern and told them how the attack happened a little over one hour past midnight and that two hours sleep isn't much for a baby. Samantha chose that moment to giggle and clap her hand, succeeding in waking Harry and Lisa up. Dumbledore hushed Samantha and gave her a bottle with some sleep potion in the milk.</p><p>Then, he laid Samantha in the middle of the basket with Harry on Samantha's right and Lisa on Samantha's left. After that, he settled the three children down by the front door of Privet Drive 4, Little Whining, Surrey but he forgot to place a warming charm. The three children begun to cry, but Dumbledore just laid an envelope on the three kids and went to hide with McGonagall and Hagrid, who was crying.</p><p>Dumbledore gave Hagrid a tissue and said:"Don't cry. This isn't farewell. You will see them in ten years again."</p><p>"Y-you're right *hiccup* Albus. B-but still. I don't *hiccup* like goodbyes.",said Hagrid but begun to settle again after wailing for a moment.</p><p>Dumbledore suggested to disappear before the door opened and McGonagall apparated just like Dumbledore near the school while Hagrid went with his Motorcycle. After a few minutes, the door opened, only for their Aunt, Petunia Dursley nee Evans, to scream for her husband to come downstairs. There were some cursing and muttering but their Uncle, Vernon Dursley, still went downstairs and was shocked when he saw three little babies, a boy and two girls, in a basket with a letter.</p><p>"What's the meaning of this, Pet?",asked Uncle Vernon to his wife.</p><p>Aunt Petunia got pale and said:"My freak of a sister and her husband got themselves killed and the Headmaster of their old school brought the children of those freaks to us and asked us to raise them like our own. Oh! What can we do, Vern?"</p><p>"We're getting rid of them, right now.".said Uncle Vernon angrily.</p><p>"We can't. This man, Dumbledore wrote that we are protected from the other freaks in their freak world if they stay here.",said Aunt Petunia.</p><p>Uncle Vernon picked up the basket and said:"Then we'll just have to beat their freakishness out of them and show them that we normal people are better than them."</p>
