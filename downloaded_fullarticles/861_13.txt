    <p>There had been no shortage of rumors regarding the De Vrieses long before the fifth of November, nineteen ninety-three.</p><p>Some were of the more pleasant kind, such as the wildly well known tale of their ancestors being the private jewelers of the royal Dutch family and the wealth it would hence bring to the household for years to come. Another, more popular, speculation was of there being a considerable amount of Veela blood mixed within their lineage, as that would be the only way to explain the family's incomprehensible beauty. Why, there was even one regarding the De Vries estate and how it was first built along the Bruges waterfront as a summer home for a wealthy socialite during the latter half of the eighteenth century.</p><p>Other talk, however, was not as kindly. One such example was the story of how a pair of Aurors had visited the family's aforementioned estate one snowy Christmas Eve. A handful of noisy neighbors had claimed to witness two uniformed Aurors knocking on the family's front door during the late hours of the night. By the time they had been spotted leaving the home it was already Christmas Day. One of those neighbors, a mousy housewife who lived across the way, claimed that she had heard from her husband, who had heard it from one of his coworkers, that there was a list somewhere in the Ministry of Magic with each member of the household on it. And apparently that coworker heard from a friend of his wife who heard from the teenage daughter of one of her friends at their weekly game of Bridge that Mr. De Vries had boarded up his study without any known reason and banned any of the family from entering for their own safety.</p><p>There were many rumors. Countless, even. Yet, like most rumors, specific talked tended to come in and out of fashion. One week's discussion of the terrible fight overheard within the confines of the family's home took only took another set of tea to transition into a lengthy talk about how Mrs. De Vries had gotten her nose enchanted to be smaller when she was in her youth.</p><p>There was, however, one topic that never seemed to die from any conversation surrounding the family. And that was of what happened to the De Vries children. Or, rather, what <em>may </em>have happened to the De Vries children as no one truly knew.</p><p>Six children were born to the household in total; Lijsbet, Eline, Diederik, Joost, Anais, and Elmo. Each were born just and kind, with heads of golden curls and eyes a similar shade of freshly made chocolate frogs. Those whom had known them could only recall pleasant meetings with the children. An afternoon tea with the eldest girls, playdates with the other children in the neighborhood, trick-or-treating adventures during Halloween; memories that one could not take a frown to. Those whom had been fortunate enough to call them friends, as well, had neither an unpleasant or upsetting thing to say. Many could recall seeing the eldest five bustling around the glistening halls of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. Elder students can remember seeing the eldest, Lijsbet, trying her mightiest to shuffle around her siblings around towards their next classes before they would all but vanish the moment her back was turned. The girls were the first to run. The ever stunning Eline would glide towards her typical bay side window, batting her eyes with a silent siren's call only for flocks of boys to come running to her side to beg for one, just one, afternoon with her at their side. They'd beg and grovel like lovesick schoolboys until little Anais would cause some ruckus from down the hall. Evel Knievel, her classmates called her. There was nary a stunt that she would not pull, including, but not limited to, sledding down the grand staircase on a wintery evening when she had been cooped up in the castle on account of a cold or attempting to Apparate despite being far too young to do so successfully. Only the twins, Diederik and Joost, ever made it to their classes and even then it was on their own terms. Individually, the boys were exceptionally bright for their age. Together, they were ingenious. There was hardly a spell or hex or rune that they could not fail to execute to perfection, even ones that were difficult even for the professors to accomplish.</p><p>Such brilliant children, all of them. Even little Elmo whom, despite being far too young to attend wizarding school, showed serious promise with his uncanny habit of levitating his toys in his crib. They were wonderful, people would say. Truly, absolutely wonderful children.</p><p>And then, just like their faces in a memory, they vanished.</p><p>On the chilled morning of September the first, nineteen ninety-two, there was no sign of their golden heads at the Bruxelles Central. Neither were they spotted on the train nor even at the academy when all the students were finally settled.</p><p>At first, friends of the children had simply assumed that the five had simple just overstayed their trip to Britain where the newly graduated Lijsbet had begun her new, rumored, Ministry of Magic position. The remaining four would return. When a week had passed, a gaggle of pining boys had swore that their lovely Eline would be back before the Halloween ball. They knew her, they all claimed, and knew that she would never leave them partnerless at their final Halloween ball at the academy. When Halloween ball came and went, the all of the Third Year class had taken bets on if Anais would fly into their classroom on a Hippogriff or stolen broomstick. But she would be back before Christmas, they all swore. When Christmas passed, a group of students during their first outing into the Pyrenees mountains muttered about how the twins would be back in classes before they knew it. They'd never miss the prep classes for the O.W.L.s. Never.</p><p>When New Years rolled around there were no more promises of their return. No one began looking to save the children's' desks nor seats at the dinner table. Their empty beds were taken. There were no more owls sent to them by hopeful chums late at night.</p><p>The De Vries children had simply vanished, it seemed. Not their school friends, their parents, nor even the noisy neighbors whom had so much to say about them could answer what had happened to all six of the children.</p><p>That was until the fifth of November, nineteen ninety-three.</p>
