    <p>A wand is, typically, made of three essential parts; the handle, the shaft, and the core.</p><p>The materials a wand is crafted from, however, also determine how well a wand resonates with a witch or wizard’s core. Wand Makers match based on a cores orientation; light, grey, or dark. This means that any of hundreds of magicals could match a Maker’s wand. A crafter, on the other hand, matches the magical themselves. A Crafter’s wand fits the magical so well that the wand refuses to work for anyone other than its owner.</p><p>Within these pages is a compendium of a Crafters possible materials. Their meanings, orientation, abilities, and the unique nature of each material that truly sets them apart from any other.</p>
