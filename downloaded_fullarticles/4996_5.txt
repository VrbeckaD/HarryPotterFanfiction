    <p>
  <span>Pandora Black was a rather average girl. Or, she was average until she was 11 years old. The only thing she was eager for was her birthday, several months away, when she looked outside. The most peculiar thing, she noticed a man In a long robe standing by her mother's car. Kelly Riter wasn't her real mother. When Pandora was three years old, Kelly and Howard Riter adopted her and she's lived with them since. She never met her real parents that she remembers. She imagined they were amazing people and died, which is why she was adopted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man waved, walking up to the door, when he knocked, she ran to the door, pulling it open. Handed a letter, she looked at it. “Is Mrs. Kelly Riter in?” </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>Ms. P. Black. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>The First Room on the Left</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>17 Quay St.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instantly, she took it to the living room. “Mum! Look.” Her mother, a gentle woman with dark blue eyes, opposing to Pandora's silvery blue ones, took the letter and looked at it. When the man walked in as well, she stood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It's quite alright. I'm a representative of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ms. Pandora Black here, has the chance to go and learn all she can about her gifts.” Her mother handed the letter back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It's addressed to you, hunny. Open it.” so she did, peeling off the wax seal with the strange insignia. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Out loud, she read, “Dear Ms. Black, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy headmistress.” When she was done, she looked up at her mother. “I'm a witch?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, that sure would explain a lot of things.” When she was four years old, Pandora was too hot, and thought that it would be rather fun if she was at a waterpark, but her family is rather poor, so they could not go, but somehow, the hose broke and she began to play in the spraying water. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>I got it last week.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Her father explained.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the second page was a list of things that she needed to classes. “First-year students will require: Three sets of plain work robes (black), One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear, One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar), One winter cloak (black, with silver fastenings), Please note that all pupil's clothes should carry name tags. This is a lot of stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Keep reading, Sweetheart.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Course books. All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk, A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling, A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch, One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore, Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander, The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Other equipment: 1 wand, 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2), 1 set glass or crystal phials, 1 telescope, 1 set brass scales, Students may also bring, if they desire, an owl OR a cat OR a toad. Yours sincerely, Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked up at her mother again, who was crying. “Oh, mum, if it makes you sad, i don't have to go.” Kelly leaned down, wrapping her in a tight hug. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is an amazing opportunity for you. I'm so happy. Let's get you your equipment, alright?” She nodded enthusiastically. She couldn't wait to be a witch.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“Wands first, mum!” She said as she was escorted to Diagon Alley. As she looked through every window, she marveled, but didn't touch. She knew not to touch. They walked first, into the place known as Ollivander’s. The willowy looking man walked up to her. He didn't even spare a moment's look at her before he nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know what you need.” and he left, returning with a long box. He opened it. “Ebony, unicorn hair core, 10 inches.” she picked it up and she felt flighty and warm and it made her chuckle. She looked at the crisp dark wood that seemed to be meant for her hand. “Very sure witches and wizards use Ebony. for that wand to chose you, you have to be very sure of yourself, and very headstrong.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And the unicorn hair?” He looked at her, eyes wide. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not many people ask that. It means you have very consistent magic.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Mr.” She said as she walked out. She met her parents and they instantly went to the robe shop, then the book shop, then to buy the cauldron. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm sorry, Pandora, but we don't have enough for an animal right now.” Pandora took a deep breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That's okay. I'd end up forgetting about it.” she knew that was a lie, but she didn't want to feel upset. Today was a special day.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>On the train, she walked to the first open seat. “My name is Pandora Black. Can I sit with you?” She asked the people. They all looked at her in shock, and one of them quickly started to speak. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We're.... waiting for someone.” and they closed the door quickly. She tried again, with the same results. Is everyone so rude? After trying several more times she ended up sitting alone, curled up with her knees to her chest. It wasn't as fun as she thought it would be. With a great sigh, she put her face to her knees and began to cry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pandora didn't know how long she sat there with her knees to her face, but when the door opened, she didn't look up. “Please go away.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm sorry. I'm only looking for a toad. A boy named Neville lost it.” she looked up to the girl in front of her. She had large bushy hair, big teeth, and freckles. When she noticed that Pandora was crying, she sat down. “My name is Hermione Granger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pandora Black.” When she didn't react, Pandora sighed and wanted to hug her. “What kind of family did you get raised in? Saints?” Hermione laughed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My parents are dentists.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So not magic, then?” She asked. “Mine aren't either. My mum owns a business and my dad works on cars.” she liked Hermione. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“Black, Pandora.” The witch called. When she heard that there were different houses, then heard about each, she hoped that she would like the people in the house she picked. When she stepped up to the stool and the hat was placed on her head, she waited. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Hm. Very wise, great ideals, very straight minded, you're overshadowed by a past you don't even know, but you won't let it get to you. You want to have a fulfilling life as a new witch, it looks like RAVENCLAW!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> The table dressed in blue cheered and she skipped her way to the table, sitting next to people she didn't know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After everyone was sorted, the man with the great big beard, Albus Dumbledore, said a few warnings, and they ate. Pandora had never eaten so much in her entire life and she was thoroughly stuffed by the time the feast ended. He spoke again and they walked up to a painting, which began to speak. It asked a riddle. The password was a riddle. As she climbed into bed, Pandora wished that she would just make one friend. Everyone seemed to be avoiding her and she hated it.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>In Transfiguration, she was alone on a bench fit for three people. It was disheartening to be there, but she didn't complain or cry anymore. She couldn't. Through the door, two boys ran in. One of them was a short boy, too skinny to be healthy with dark skin and the most peculiar green eyes. The other boy was pale and stocky with </span>
  <em>
    <span>orange</span>
  </em>
  <span> hair. When the darker boy finally sat beside her, after getting talked to by the teacher, he just looked at her and smiled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm..” she stopped. She didn't want to lose another possibility of friendship. “I'm Pandora Black.” He nodded and smiled again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm Harry Potter.” When she didn't respond with familiarity, his eyes widened, then became softer. They shook hands and went on the rest of the class. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pandora quickly found that Potions was her least favorite class. Professor Snape billowed around, and when her chair disappeared, she yelped. “Ten points from Slytherin, Black, for causing a distraction.” She mouthed incoherently, but didn't argue, picking up the chair next to her. When she accidentally grabbed the wrong ingredient, then tried to exchange them, he took more points. Astronomy was her favorite. She always loved the nighttime and something about the stars always caught her attention. “They are pretty aren't they?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked over to see a girl whose skin didn't stick out against the night with sharp brown eyes. “Always have been.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Padma Patil”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pandora Black.” Padma reeled back, but Pandora grabbed her arm. “Please, don't. I don't know why everyone hates me, I don't know what I did, but I just really need a friend. Whatever you think I did, I didn't do. I was raised by muggles my life. I didn't even know wizards existed until this year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don't know about the Black family?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My mom told was talking about them a couple of years ago. They were terrible people. Very mean to anyone who wasn't a pureblood. Most of them were in Slytherin and they supported You-know-who.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who?” Padma motioned for Pandora to lean closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don't say his name. It's V- Voldemort.” She visibly shook. “Apparently, he's this really powerful wizard who no one could stand up against. But somehow, when he fought a baby, he was defeated. No one knows what happened.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What baby?”</span><br/>
<span>“Harry Potter. That's why they call him the Boy-Who-Lived. He's the only one who didn't die when confronted by you-know-who.</span>
