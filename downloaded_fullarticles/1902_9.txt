<p>Face claim for Liana Potter is Nikola Selezinko. I know she looks older than 14 but I feel like a creep searching for pics of teens. I just imagine her cheekbones and jaw looking a bit more like Cillian Murphy's.</p>

    <p>Sirius sat there, leaning against the northern wall, staring at the floor. For eleven years he had been in this cell, <span class="adverb"> barely </span> living, blaming himself for the death of his friends. For eleven years he gave no thought to anything else, <span class="qualifier"> just </span> dwelling on what he had done wrongs. But that changed yesterday. Yesterday he had over heard the guards. Their conversation knocked sense back into Sirius. The men spoke <span class="adverb"> softly </span>, but not soft enough. During their rounds they gossiped about Liana Phoebe Potter.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>The two guards shared with one another the rumors and whispers they had heard. '<em>Murder</em>' one breathed out. '<em>Blood money</em>' the other murmured. But the two guards agreed on one thing, '<em>Marriage</em>'. The two continued gossiping, ignorant of Sirius Black listening. It took a moment but once Sirius understood what he was hearing, rage and despair consumed the man. Sirius howled and screamed, more animal than man at that moment. His actions startling the guards and setting off other prisoners.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Fudge! That worthless sorry excuse for a man. The same one that sentenced him to this hell hole. That man, was planning on destroying his little flower's life. Fudge no doubt encouraged and spurred on by money and lies. He had plotted to have Liana married, penniless, and under his control. Sirius howled at the thought or someone touching his Liana, his god daughter.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>The hours passed <span class="adverb"> slowly </span>, and with the fading light Sirius plotted.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Two days after his outburst, Sirius made history by escaping Azkaban.</p>
    <p> </p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>The first place Sirius headed was to his family's home in London, not to Liana like many thought he would. In his family home Sirius feasted, he ate until he was sick and ate more. Sirius took potions that he forced Kreacher to buy, desperate to fix his damaged body. And between all this Sirius wrote letters. He wrote to his father's old friend, Mr. Smith. A 'generic' and <span class="adverb"> highly </span> trusted 'solicitor' that dealt with less than legal matters. He also wrote to Mr.Smith's associate Mr. Davis. The man was squib of noble blood and a solicitor who <span class="adverb"> mostly </span> practiced muggle law. <span class="adverb"> Lastly </span> he sent a letter to Gringotts and Petunia.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Over the next three months, Sirius raced towards his goals. Mr. Davis would clear Sirius' name in the muggle world. They would pressure Petunia into giving Sirius guardianship over Liana. Next Sirius worked with Bloodclaw. Together they put the Potter and Black accounts into order. The goblins, unlike the ministry, still recognized Sirius as Liana's magical guardian. To them blood was stronger than some paperwork. With any left over time Sirius would meet with Mr. Smith. They worked on proving his innocence. Something that would be near impossible. Or it would be if Sirius had never seen a picture of a certain rat with Ron Weasley.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Sirius took a risk and wrote to Remus. He wrote everything down. Peter's betrayal, the rat hiding, the whispers and rumors he had heard while in prison. It took time and pleading but Remus believed him. Remus told Sirius he had agreed to teach at Hogwarts. While there he would capture Peter and speak with Liana. It would take time and patience but Remus would help Sirius.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Remus started by getting to know Liana. He tutored her after class, they focused on the Patronus. During practice he talked with Liana about her parents and godfather. <span class="adverb"> Slowly </span> introducing the idea that Sirius was innocent. To his surprise it took very little to convince Liana. When Sirius wrote to her for the first time he asked about it. </p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Her response startled both men. When she was younger Liana had found her mother's belongings in the attic. Lily's journal one of them, her last entry was the night before she died. The journal was a goldmine of information. Through it Liana had learned of magic, her parents, and the secrets they kept. Remus and Sirius <span class="complexword"> on the other hand </span> were in disbelief after they read through Lily's journal.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>For one clear as day, there was a passage naming Peter as their secret keeper. It was the next part that tore Sirius apart. Dumbledore was the one to cast the spell, which meant he knew Sirius was innocent. The man could have come forward and cleared Sirius, shown that he never betrayed anyone. But the major blow to both men was the truth about Liana. The Potters had blood adopt her. Both men couldn't care less about that, what hurt them was being kept in the dark. But that wasn't the only surprise for them.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Liana also shared the paperwork she had found in her mother's journal. One of the papers was Liana's original birth certificate. The paper confused the two males. '<em> Leonora Polly Shelby, born 31 July, 1905 </em>'. Luckily their confusion ended after they read more of Lily's journal. Lily and James had adopted Liana from a wizarding adoption agency.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>An agency that had been under investigation during the war. An investigation that was lead by James. During a raid James had seen Liana and had fallen in love, so the Potters adopted her. And a few months after that James had shut down the agency. It was during the adoption process that James had discovered the truth. </p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>The agency was stealing and smuggling children. Paperwork showed that for certain amounts of cash they would 'find' babies or children. Files showed that the children left <span class="passivevoice"> were given </span> to others for dark and twisted rituals or potions. The workers used an illegal variation of a time turner, it allowed travel between two points in time. They would take children from poor families- through lies, false paperwork, or force. The agency took almost a 100 children from different times, starting in 1801.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>The Potters didn't know what to do. They had already blood adopted Liana, so she was their blood child. But they also felt terrible, another family was missing a child. The worst thing was, that family would never know what had happened to her. <span class="adverb"> Ultimately </span> the Potter couple decided to do nothing. Liana's previous family was almost a hundred years in the past. The only way to contact them was through a illegal variation of the time turner.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Liana shared with Sirius and Remus that as a child she <span class="passivevoice"> was devastated </span>. A family and unconditional family was once again out of her reach. She told them it was like losing her parents twice. Her words saddened the two men. They knew they had failed Liana. Both men felt even worse once she shared what her life was like with the Dursleys.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>She told them of the harsh words and punishments. She told them of her cupboard under the stairs and of her scars. The two were furious, they wanted to do something. But that anger dwindled when they realized <em> they couldn't do anything </em>. It was then that Sirius made a promise to himself. He swore that Liana would have the chance to meet her family. He would make sure she had everything she wanted.</p>
    <p> </p>

</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>It was six months into Liana's third year when Sirius received good news. Mr. Davis was able to prove Sirius' innocence in the muggle world. As soon as Sirius received the news he went to Petunia Dursley, she would give him custody of Liana. Otherwise they would have problems. It took very little for Petunia to sign the papers. Sirius was manic with happiness, something Remus and Liana learned to be wary of.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>In his state Sirius went on a spree, he made a small dent in the black account. The man went everywhere, eager to explore and see how the world had changed. He bought anything and everything, so long as it caught his eye. But he also focused on spoiling Liana and Remus. A month after the announcement, Sirius sent them each a package with a note. '<em>Sorry, not sorry</em>' and a shrunken 3 layer trunk filled with gifts. Things Sirius thought they would like or things they had mentioned once or twice.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Over the next few months the good news continued. Remus finally captured Peter, he found him hiding in Hagrid's hut. The rat was in an enchanted cage in Remus' office. Remus took great joy in threatening the rat. Mr. Smith was able to secure a private meeting with Amelia Bones. He was sure that with Bones' help, Peter, and Lily's journal Sirius would be a free man by year's end.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Sirius, Remus, and Liana were ecstatic and emboldened. Over the next month they would avoid dementors and meet in the Shrieking Shack. Sirius and Liana could finally spend time bonding and talking face to face. During their talks the two men learned so much about Liana. They listened to her talk about her fears, hopes, dreams, and everything <span class="complexword"> in between </span>. The men told Liana about the Potter family, stories about her parents, and more.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>"When I left the Dursleys I was so hopeful. I imagined this place would be home, people would accept me, and I'd have a place to belong. But I found none of those things. Everyone was expecting me to be brave, strong, and exactly like the Potters." Liana sniffled, but continued telling them how she felt.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>"When I didn't do something or act like they expected they treated me <span class="adverb"> differently </span>. They acted cold and judging. Some of the students and professors even lecture or berate me about acting the 'proper way'. At some point I stopped trying to be me, and instead I behaved like the Liana Potter they wanted." Sirius wrapped his arm around his god daughter, she looked so small and vulnerable.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>"After all no one wants a hero that is quiet and shy. No one wants a hero that likes sewing or knitting or pretty things. <em>A Hero</em> , isn't  terrified of facing Voldemort or a basilisk. They don't think my dreams of family and children are heroic or exciting. But that's me- quiet and shy Liana, who <span class="qualifier"> just </span> wants to <span class="passivevoice"> be loved </span>."</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>The only sound for a few seconds was Liana's soft crying. Remus reached out and stroked her hair. "Yes those things may not be exciting. But it doesn't mean you aren't strong or heroic or brave. It's fine if you're shy and quiet, and it's fine if you're scared. Everyone gets scared, Liana. Sirius and I will love you no matter what, and will support what ever dream or hobbies you have. And if people want or demand that you change, they aren't people you need in your life. Liana, be you, Sirius and I will deal with the rest."</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>The end of Remus' short speech had Liana sobbing. No one had ever said they loved her, nor had anyone ever told her it was okay to be her. Everyone wanted her to be different. The Dursleys' wanted her to be quiet, downtrodden, and normal. Hermione wanted her to be fierce, independent, and a revolutionary. On and on it went, she was never enough. But, these two men had accepted her and everything about her.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Sirius and Remus sat with Liana until she stopped crying. Trying to cheer her up they spoke about their plans. Plans for the future, what they would do as a family. Like traveling the world, or going on great adventures. Sirius' ideas and plans become more grand, spurred on by Liana's laughter. <span class="hardreadability"> When he paused for breath, Liana </span> <span class="adverb"> shyly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> asked if all three of them could find information on her Shelby family </span>. Remus gave her a soft smile, "Of course."</p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Unfortunately life doesn't always goes as planned. Sirius hadn't heard from Mr. Smith since his meeting with Bones two days ago. He was pacing with stress- where was Smith, had they made a deal, was there going to be a trial? His questions <span class="passivevoice"> were answered </span> when he opened the morning paper. ' <em>Francis Smith and Amelia Bones, Traitors!</em>'</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Sirius froze in fear and shock, what had happened. He <span class="adverb"> frantically </span> read through the article. Their meeting <span class="passivevoice"> was reported </span> to Fudge by a ' <em> anonymous </em> ' source. When the minister went to talk with Bones he '<em>overheard</em>' her conversation. He had heard the two talking about freeing and helping Sirius Black. <em>'Something only a Death Eater or supporter of Voldemort would do'.</em></p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Bones and Smith fought the arrest. During the fight Bones' office had gone up in flames. <em> <span class="adverb"> Accidentally </span> </em> destroying evidence, paper work, and a family pet. Fudge had them arrested and tried in a private trial. They <span class="passivevoice"> were found </span> guilty and sentenced to a Dementor's kiss that night. To stop any worry and fear the Minister promised two things. One was the Aurors cracking down on other You-Know-Who supporters. The other was an immediate increase in the amount of people looking for Black.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>"No! No no no no!" Sirius raged, <em> he was so close </em> <em>!</em> SO CLOSE! He screamed, overturning the table in his anger. His feelings were so strong and fierce that his magic slipped out and destroyed part of the room. The outburst helped Sirius calm down, he clenched his fists and breathed slow and deep. His mind was racing, <span class="adverb"> frantically </span> thinking. He couldn't run to the Muggle world. His freedom and guardianship over Liana in the muggle world meant nothing to wizards.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>If his god daughter tried to live with him, she would <span class="passivevoice"> be hunted </span> down. They would never be able to live in peace. It was on his third going over of the situation that Sirius <span class="passivevoice"> was struck </span> , <em>the time turners!</em> He had gone through private channels and businesses, all for the two illegal turners in his room. Sirius tore out of the room, he <span class="adverb"> frantically </span> summoned everything he could think of. Shoving it all into his trunk, and shrinking it. As he was shoving the time turners into his pocket, Sirius felt the wards shudder.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Once again he flew through the house. Reaching the basement <span class="qualifier"> just </span> as the wards shattered. He pushed furniture around trying to get to the tunnel he knew was there. The door above him creaked as it <span class="passivevoice"> was hit </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> Cursing Sirius finally found the tunnel, rushing he transformed, and ran through the darkness </span>.</p>

    <p>The Black family had owned the land the townhouse was on for centuries. But the townhouse was a <span class="adverb">relatively</span> new addition. Every Black born after the townhouse <span class="passivevoice">was built</span> <span class="passivevoice">were shown</span> the tunnel in the basement. It was a last resort for the family, a last ditch effort, a way for them to escape. As Sirius ran through the tunnels he thanked his paranoid relatives. He slowed to a stop in the cavernous room, panting he look for the small marking that would tell him where he needed to go. Moving <span class="adverb">quickly</span> he passed several tunnels, near the bottom of the sixth one he saw it. A small etching of a circle, this was the tunnel that opened near the Leaky Cauldron. Once again Sirius sprinted into the dark.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>By the time he emerged from the underground labyrinth it was dark. Sirius was careful to avoid people and attention as he entered the Leaky Cauldron. He willed his magic to hide him, as he walked to the entrance of the Alley no one paid him attention. Seeing the brick wall open helped calm Sirius, he paused for a moment before rushing off to the bank. Months ago he had spoke to Bloodclaw about what to do if this happened. He had told the goblin to empty every account in the Black and Potter name. Something that would take time. But he was sure the goblin started the process upon reading the newspaper that morning.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>And Sirius was right. Upon entering the goblin's office he saw <span class="complexword"> numerous </span> goblins. Each one carrying bags of the Black and Potter fortune to enchanted trunks. Sirius approached Bloodclaw and waited for the busy goblin to acknowledge him. "Ah, Black. <span class="qualifier"> Just </span> in time. As you requested months ago, I started emptying the vaults when I saw the paper. It is a shame. Gringotts is... <em> disappointed </em> , at losing your business." <span class="hardreadability"> Bloodclaw gave the man a bloodthirsty smile, "As you know we will be charging <em>extra</em> for the inconvenience caused </span>. The vaults should be empty by midnight." Sirius nodded and looked at the clock- four more hours.</p>
  </div>
</div><div class="">
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Sirius dropped a few coins in front of Bloodclaw, "I need an owl sent to Remus Lupin." The goblin looked at him before nodding, Sirius moved <span class="adverb"> hastily </span> . He grabbed a quill and extra parchment on the desk. <em> 'Wards broken, grabbing money, meet at shack with flower. Midnight </em> <em>.'</em> He handed the note to Bloodclaw who waved over a younger goblin, "Have an owl deliver this to Remus Lupin."</p>

    <p>Remus held Liana close as they crept through the castle. They were under the Invisibility Cloak and magic helped to muffle their steps. But Remus was cautious, and took extra care to avoid any patrols. Fudge had sent extra Aurors and Dementors to Hogwarts that morning. They along with the professors had been patrolling the castle and it's grounds. He thought it would be easier once they were outside, but he was wrong. There were <span class="complexword"> multiple </span> groups of Dementors and Aurors walking the grounds.</p>

He spent the next few minutes watching how the groups moved. He <span class="adverb"> quickly </span> noticed a pattern, and moved. <span class="adverb"> Cautiously </span> they made their way to the Whomping Willow, and entered the tunnel hidden in it's roots.</p>

    <p>Remus was hyper vigilant the whole time. <span class="adverb"> Slightly </span> letting his guard down when they entered the shack. They stood in silence, waiting. He drew his wand and twisted when the floors to his right creaked. But relaxed and smiled when he saw the faint outline of Padfoot. Liana whipped off her cloak and threw herself at him. She buried her face in his fur, "Sirius what are we going to do? All our evidence is gone and there's a nation wide man hunt for you. <em>Everything we wanted-</em>" Both men could hear her voice waver, but Liana held back her tears.</p>

    <p>Liana was still hugging Sirius as he transformed back. He pulled the time turners from his pocket. He put the larger one around his neck and the smaller one around Liana. "We're going to be a real family Liana. We promised you. But <span class="qualifier"> maybe </span> <em> some time </em> <em>away</em> is our best option." Remus groaned at Sirius' joke. "Now my flower, these are different from normal time turners. They move you back by decades. So, when I tell you to, I need you to turn it ten times. Notice the size difference.

    <p>Sirius stiffened and looked around, a tense silence had fallen over the shack. A deep despair fills the air as frost <span class="adverb"> rapidly </span> covers their surrounds. Remus and Sirius shove Liana into the corner and shield her from view. Sirius screams at her as the wall in front of them explodes into splinters. "Now Flower! Use it now, ten turns!" Remus turns to her as Sirius throws up a shield, "We'll be right behind you." Liana stops at ten turns and the world around her spins violently.</p>
