    <p>“Now I know, I know this is dark, but there’s a difference between wanting to die and just not wanting to be alive, there’s a fundamental difference. And that difference is, of course - say it with me now?” He paused, feeling the heat of the stage lights and the silent anticipation of the crowd. With a wave of his arm on each syllable, he graciously drew them all in.</p><p>“Or-gan-i-<i>za</i>-tion, yes that’s right, you’ve got it!”</p><p>The audience laughed nervously.</p><p>“Oh don’t be shy, you’re all terribly smart people, I can’t pull any punches with you. I mean literally, I can’t pull any punches with you. Look at me: I look like what would happen if someone genuinely managed to frighten a piece of spaghetti.” He paused for a brief chuckle, then did his wide eyes and ‘frightened spaghetti arms’ that always took the chuckle to a laugh.</p><p>“Right? You had no fucking idea what ‘frightened spaghetti’ looked like until just now, did you? Well congratulations, this is it. As my ex used to say, ‘take it all in’.” Using his lean, pale limbs to his advantage, he struck his ‘proud frightened spaghetti’ pose that always got a bigger laugh, then strutted wobbly about, making noises somewhere between confident and terrified. He looked at the man in the front row who’d made the mistake of heckling him near the beginning of his set. </p><p>“Don’t worry David, your wife described the last meal you made for her as, and I quote, ‘very brave’, so well done.” He held his gaze with David as the bigger laughs shifted gear into whoops and applause.</p><p>“But enough about us, sweet David, we’ve been so rude to everyone else. Let’s get back to death!” The laughter washed over him like buoyant salt water, and as he ran his fingers through his blond hair and smiled at the audience, he knew they were ready to go wherever he took them.</p><p>—</p><p>“So it’s the flobberworm mucus and not the lavender that gives Angel’s Trumpet Draught its distinct hue,” Draco said, barely remembering to gesture at the slide behind him before trying to wave on to the next one. “Now, as you can see - ” </p><p>The slide didn’t move. “Now as…” He tried again. “As you can - ” The slide remained steadfast. “As you can see…” From the back of the classroom Slughorn nodded and smiled encouragingly, and Draco did his best not to sink dramatically as possible into the ground.</p><p><i>I hate this</i>, he thought, looking at the projector. <i>This is stupid and I hate this.</i></p><p>Since Slughorn had taken over Snape’s former position as Potions Master, Draco had found his investment in the class to be…well, 'waning’ was a kind term. First it was Slughorn’s inexplicable non-devotion to the Slytherins despite being an alumnus of the great house; then it was Potter’s even more inexplicable brewing abilities, which had caught Slughorn’s eye to the point Draco could barely receive the attention he most <i>assuredly</i> deserved; and now, now that he did have Slughorn’s undivided attention, now it was this, the ultimate denigration. Now, it was class presentations.</p><p>Never mind he certainly didn’t need to deliver information in front of the student body as that’s what, oh, say, <i>having professors</i> were bloody well for, but how was he expected to know how to work a projector? Yes, Slughorn had offered a tutorial, but so what? That was only once, and that was weeks ago, and it wasn’t Draco’s fault he had quite a bit much more on his <i>mind.</i></p><p>“Now as you can <i>see</i>,” Draco ground out as he waved his wand with a curt fury at the projector, which immediately lurched forward three slides, setting rippling laughter across the Gryffindor quotient of the room. Cheeks burning and curses rumbling in his throat, Draco began to physically wrestle with the projector.</p><p>“Ah, Mr. Malfoy, that’s a delicate piece of equipment,” Slughorn said, barely hiding his own smile. “Do you require assistance?”</p><p>“No, <i>thank</i> you Professor, I can handle this on my own."</p><p>“He’ll have to now that Father can't hear about this in Azkaban,” Seamus said under his breath to Harry. </p><p>Of course, Seamus’ version of ‘under his breath’ was akin to the everyman’s ‘obvious stage whisper’, and of course, the dungeons were made entirely of stone, so of course, the laughter had died down just in time for Seamus’ words to echo across the room like a ringing bell. Draco froze, and so did the temperature of the class.</p><p>There was an awfully long moment of quiet. Draco tensed his hands on the projector.</p><p>“Mr. Finnigan, that was uncalled for and deeply inappropriate,” Slughorn said with practiced calm. “Five points from - ”</p><p>In a swift movement, Draco crashed the projector to the ground, stalked to his desk, and shoved his books in his bag.</p><p>“Mr. Malfoy!”</p><p>“Not to worry Professor,” Draco said through clenched teeth, making sure to accidentally smack the nearest Gryffindor as he swung his bag on his shoulder, “my <i>family</i> will be happy to pay you for the projector’s repairs. And as I’m sure this will necessitate detention, please, do owl me at your earliest convenience.”</p><p>With that, Draco Malfoy opened the door of Potions class, strode out purposefully, and slammed it behind him. A heavy silence blanketed the room. Just as Professor Slughorn was about to speak, the door opened again.</p><p>“And by the way?” Draco spat, “No one knows if Angel’s Trumpet Draught is a poison or an anti-venom, which is <i>incredibly</i> stupid, because <i>why</i> make something if we don’t know how it works?!”</p><p>The door slammed again. Slughorn made his way to the front of the class and gingerly picked up the remains of his projector.</p><p>“My dear students, would that Mr. Malfoy was still here. For not only would I tell him he’s lost his house 20 points - ” the Slytherins groaned “- but I’d answer his question.”</p><p>“So you know how Angel’s Trumpet Draught works?” asked Blaise.</p><p>“Oh no, absolutely not!” replied Slughorn. “You see, we make what we don’t understand in order to eventually understand that which we choose to make.” </p><p>Harry looked at Ron. Ron looked at Hermione. Hermione looked at Ron and Harry. With a sigh, Hermione raised her hand.</p><p>“Yes, Miss Granger?”</p><p>“Do you mean that in an epistemological sense?”</p><p>“As far as I know I do! Could you kindly define that for us, Miss Granger?”</p><p>“Essentially it’s…well, how do we know what we know? If we don’t know something, but we don’t know we don’t know it, how can we hope to understand what it is we <i>do</i> know when the parameters of what we <i>don’t</i> know are incomplete?”</p><p>He smiled at Hermione, placed the broken projector on a high shelf, and gave it a gentle pat. “How indeed. Five points to Gryffindor, which brings today’s tally for your house to a respectable zero. Well! I suppose class presentations are off for the time being, shall we play a round of Exploding Snap? Oh, by the by Mr. Finnigan, your detention is this Saturday.”</p><p>—</p><p>“So here’s the thing about my family,” he said, taking a swig from his water bottle, “here’s the thing. A lot of families care if you’re, I dunno, say, <i>gay.</i>” He gestured to the rainbow emblazoned on his jumper. “But not my family, no. My family cares if I’m <i>classy</i>. So! Gay, as we all know, can either be very classy or…” He pressed the rainbow on his jumper. It lit up, and when he held the microphone to it, a midi compression of A Little Respect by Erasure started playing. He slid his chin down until his mouth met the microphone. </p><p>“Very <i>gayyyyy</i>.” He allowed the song to play for as long as they laughed.</p><p>“But the thing is, despite being from a little place called England - you might have heard of us, we ruined the world? - despite being from England, I’m easily ‘Southern Gothic classy’. I come from money, but I also come from mystery, or as us British Southern Gothics call it, ‘a Kate Bush song’.” He drained the last of his water bottle and winked at a familiar face in the audience. “I told you we were gonna get back to death, didn’t I, David? Welcome to 9:45 pm in the Garden of Good and Evil, brother.”</p><p>—</p><p>Draco wasn’t sure if it was his personal desperation or the several physical kicks that opened the doors to the Room of Requirement, but either way, there it was and there he was. He picked his way through to the Vanishing Cabinet and ran his hand over its smooth varnish, pausing his grip on the handle of the door.</p><p>—</p><p>“My friends and lovers, I’ve been Draco Malfoy, thank you so much for tonight!” he said to rapturous applause. “Let me know if you have a restaurant, I'll give you a decent Yelp review!” He took another bow and made his way stage right.</p><p>—</p><p>“Okay,” Draco said in front of the cabinet. He took in a deep breath. “Alright.”</p><p>—</p><p>“Brilliant show!”</p><p>“Thanks love,” Draco said as he rounded the corner to his dressing room. “Mind picking me up a - oh sweet gentle <i>Jesus</i> what is that?”</p><p>“Um,” his assistant said as they both saw the imposing black box at the same time, “I guess it’s...a dressing room?”</p><p>“In a dressing room?”</p><p>“I guess?”</p><p>“It’s a dressing room within a dressing room?”</p><p>“…I - ”</p><p>“You’ve made me go full meta?”</p><p>“I - ”  </p><p>“My God.”</p><p>“Um - ”</p><p>
  <i>“Thank you.”</i>
</p><p>“Oh!” </p><p>He hugged his assistant more tightly than most in his life.</p><p><i>“Oh,”</i> the assistant said, and hugged back.</p><p>“Leave me for now,” he said, transfixed by the cabinet before him. “I’ll find you when you I need you.”</p><p>“…are you sure?” the assistant asked, “Because you have a habit of disappearing for no reason - ”</p><p>“I have my reasons, I just don’t explain them to you,” he said absently, stroking the cabinet.</p><p>“Right. Of course. It’s just that my whole job is to know where you are - ”</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>“You don’t know my name?”</p><p>Draco balked. “Of course I know your name! Do you know my name?”</p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p>“Obviously! So, I'm just...you know, because, <i>obviously</i>, so...that's why your name is...?"</p><p>"Linda.”</p><p>“Linda!”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He stroked the cabinet again. “Linda. I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>“Of course you will,” Linda muttered as she made her way out.</p><p>“Okay,” he said, looking at what was essentially an obelisk with doors. He ran his fingers through his blond hair. “Alright.”</p><p>—</p><p>Okay.</p><p>—</p><p>Alright.</p><p>—</p><p>Through a miracle of space and time, they stepped through the doors at exactly the same moment.</p>
