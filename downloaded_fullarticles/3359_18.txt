          <div class="userstuff"><p><span>Although h</span>e didn‘<span>t approach me publicly, he had the audacity to come to my house.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>***</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I had one of those days when I wasn’t doing anything. Just lying in bed, reading. It was almost evening and I only ate breakfast.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I felt the wards moving and breaking. I thought they came to get me and take me back to Azkaban. I didn’t care.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When I opened the door, he was there, wand in hand.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>My jaw set immediately.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Hello Malfoy.’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Potter,’ I sneered. ‘What are you doing here?’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>I wanted to talk.’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>You could’ve sent an owl, not break my wards.’ Not that I would answer.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>I didn’t break anything. </span><span>Or didn’t mean to anyway.’ He put his wand away.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Yeah, right. Like I believe you.’ I glared at him. ‘I want you gone.’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was shuffling his feet. ‘Can I come in?’ he asked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was thick as ever. ‘Did you not here me just now? Get out of my property.’</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Look, I really just want to talk.’ His arms were spread wide. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Could I kill him right now without repercussion? Doubtful.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Well talk then.’ I folded my arms across my chest.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>It’s kinda cold here. Can’t I seriously come inside?’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I started to get cold too. I was barefoot and with a robe over my pyjamas. It was snowing.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>No.’ I rather suffer than to let him in.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Fine,’ his jaw tensed. ‘All I wanted to say is I’m sorry.’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>What for?’ For existing? </span><span>For coming? For insulting me? For being The Git Who lived?</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>For the things I said at that dinner. I didn’t know that you donated.’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Yes. Because money make me automatically a good person. ‘Sure.’</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>I shouldn’t have said those stuff. I was just weirded out I saw you there, that’s all.’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Yes. And that just gave you the right to attack me. ‘Sure.’</span>
</p>
<p>‘<span>Hermione gave me shit about it. Said I should</span><span>n’t have done it.</span> <span>That I should</span><span> apologise. So… ‘</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Like I give a shit. ‘Sure.’ </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He snapped. ‘Do you even listen to me?’</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was very satisfying seeing him annoyed. I wasn’t even trying so hard. He had a patience </span>
  <span>of a spoiled brat. ‘Sure.’</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Jesus!’ he threw his hands up in annoyance. ‘Are you gonna say anything else beside ‘sure’?’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Sure,’ he glared at me with flared nostrils. ‘You said your apologies, however pathetic. </span><span>D</span><span>oesn’t mean I have to accept them.’</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>It’s a decent thing to do.’ He growled.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>It’s also a decent thing not to attack someone without reason.’ </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>I just apologised!’ he yelled. His words echoed.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>I didn’t ask you to.’ It was getting tiresome. I put my hand on the door to close them. He pushed into it. I gritted my teeth. I am not going to kill him. I am not going to kill him.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I want to kill him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>We’re not in school any more, Malfoy. We could at least be decent with each other.’ He said in a low voice.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Decent? I was nothing but decent. I never even looked at him. If that is not decent between us, then I don’t know what is.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Yet you’re the one behaving like child.’ </span><span>I said and started pushing against the door again. I should’ve eaten something. He was suddenly inside, his ha</span><span>n</span><span>d fisted in my robe.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>You’re so fucking insufferable!’ He looked like he was going to curse me. Or kill me. At least I wouldn’t have to look at him any more. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I did the only reasonable thing. I laughed in his face. ‘Says the most insufferable prat in the world.’</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I saw his jaw set even tighter. ‘</span>
  <span>I wanna punch you in the face,’ he said. I felt his spit land on my lip. I licked my lips. Gross.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He looked down. Then back up in my eyes. ‘I want to kill you,’ I sneered back.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>We were glaring at each other. We were uncomfortably close. I got enough.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Get out,’ I pushed into his chest. He took a step back and shook his head.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<span>Sorry, I...’ I didn’t let him finish. Suddenly clear of mind I sent him flying out of the door right on the wet ground. I grinned and shut the door. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I was livid. Shame I couldn’t really punch him or anything. No doubt he would run and call for my imprisonment.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I hated him. I hated that I hated him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I didn’t want to feel anything towards him. I wanted to never see him again. To never think about him again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I wanted to leave this country. These people. I hated I couldn’t.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>***</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I didn’t know </span>
  <span>at the time, but</span>
  <span> much worse </span>
  <span>things</span>
  <span> than hatred would come. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I wish I knew. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I wish it never happened.</span>
