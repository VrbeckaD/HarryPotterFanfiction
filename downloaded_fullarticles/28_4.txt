  <span>Draco growled as he sat down on the sofa in the common room. Pansy flickered her eyes toward him and raised a perfect eyebrow. She kicked his shin when he continued to ignore her and grumble under his breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s the matter with you?” she asked him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He merely continued grumbling, this time crossing his arms over his chest. She could hear him mumble sentences that were clearly mocking someone. With a sigh, realising that she wouldn’t have any answers from him, she turned back to Daphne and continued their conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just think it’s funny that he can–”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy smiled at Daphne, letting her know that their conversation would have to be postponed. There would only be one reason why Draco could get like this. There could only be one </span>
  <em>
    <span>person</span>
  </em>
  <span> who Draco could be referring to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t you start from the beginning?” she asked, hopefully getting an answer to her question this time around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco huffed and raised his arms in indignation. He checked that they were among trusted people and started his tirade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was just walking around, making my way here when I bumped into the nuisance that is Potter. He didn’t move out of the way, which he should’ve done. It’s obvious I needed to be somewhere important – unlike him. I </span>
  <em>
    <span>obviously</span>
  </em>
  <span> got angry, as you do. I may have said some choice words, but he didn’t move. Saying that the corridor was wide enough for both of us. If that was the case, </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> could have moved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy nodded, sharing looks with Daphne. Daphne was not in Draco’s line of sight, so she was free to roll her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyways, I said ‘fuck you’ and you know what the little shit did? He fucking winked and told me ‘maybe later’. Pansy… </span>
  <em>
    <span>What the fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy stifled a laugh, Draco was clearly flustered and had no idea how to respond to Potter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What Draco failed to disclose was that he spent a few seconds stuttering and turning pink while Potter walked the opposite direction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy knew that he only needed a little push to get to where he wanted— inside Potter’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>wherever</span>
  </em>
  <span>— so she appealed to her Slytherin side, lighting up when an idea sparked in her mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Clearly he’s just trying to unsettle you. He’s using this new technique to hassle you. Why don’t you play it at his game and see how it goes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco gaped at her before he started to grin, “Pansy, you bloody genius!” He stood up and made his way to his room. His smile turned conniving, oblivious to the two girls trying to keep their laughter in.</span>
