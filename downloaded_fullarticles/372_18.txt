    <p>Harry looked up as the doors to the Great Hall swung open, a lone figure striding forward towards his own place at the head of the hall. </p><p>As the figure approached Harry slowly began to make out recognisable features; a broad nose, brown eyes, pale complexion, mussed red hair, patchy beard.</p><p>“Potter” the man growled as he stopped several metres away.</p><p>“They’re dead?” Harry asked, almost lazily.</p><p>“Yes” the man said, a warbling chuckle to his voice.</p><p>“Was it you?”</p><p>“Yes”.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because it’s my right!” the man practically hissed.</p><p>“No” Harry said, his hand itching to lash out. “No. This is your right”.</p><p>And with an almost invisible flick of his wrist, a green light burst from the wand hidden in his sleeve. The beam smashing into the man’s chest before he could so much as raise his own wand.</p><p>“I’m truly sorry Ron” Harry said as he rose to his feet. “You didn’t deserve what those monsters turned you into”.</p><p>The floor around Ron’s now still body began to glow green, and from Harry’s vantage point from the raised platform he could make out that it formed a glowing circle, with lines criss crossing this way and that, each making contact with Ron’s body.</p><p>As Harry descended the steps, he reached into a pocket of his tattered robes and pulled out a battered Timeturner. Stepping into the glowing circle, he reached out his hand and dropped the Timeturner onto Ron’s chest, letting it sit there.</p><p>Raising his wand tip to point at the palm of his other hand, Harry whispered a spell, not even flinching as blood spurted from a sudden gash in his palm. Holding out the hand, he allowed the blood to pour onto the Timeturner.</p><p>“Finally” Harry groaned, as the green light roared, bathing the room in it’s ethereal light.</p><p>“Have either of you seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost his”.</p>
