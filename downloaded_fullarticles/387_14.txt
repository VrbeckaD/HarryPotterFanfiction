</p><p align="justify">When he picked the Daily Prophet and deposited one Knut in the barn owl’s pouch he considered taking it back and shove the journal and the loathsome owl out of his home with a hex coursing behind its tail. The last thing he wanted to see on this day was Potter’s face smiling to the camera as flashes went by. It was obvious people would consider him the big hero of the wizarding world, no matter his or everyone else’s sacrifices. Moreover, surely the boy would make the front page covered in compliments and idolatry, forget all the times the same journal accused and damned him. The headlines talked about the end of the second war anniversary, it was only then that Severus remembered yesterday completed three years, it would obviously appear in today's news.</p><p align="justify">Three years free of spying, free of trying to manoeuvre that minefield without getting himself killed. He wouldn’t miss it, wouldn’t miss Hogwarts, nor the Dark Lord sadistic ways of showing power. Severus was… Contented with the way things were right now. Between the free time to brew a few of the more complex potions for St. Mungus, and Hogwarts, a service he’s very well paid for and also brewing potions on a daily basis to his own apothecary at Diagon Alley he would say happiness was found. A nice facade at his store brought many clients, which of course, had no idea it was an ex-death eater who brewed and sold those potions for a higher than average price (a perfect quality brewing guaranteeing that). Everything was more than enough to suffice his monthly expenses and, obviously, a welcoming face attending the clients got him free of any social interaction.</p><p align="justify">Very rarely he went out in the light of the day. When it happened, it was mostly only to buy certain ingredients impossible to obtain through the mail. Severus couldn’t care less about the nasty looks he received while walking the streets, most of the time he agreed with the post-war-clean-fingered public opinion. He should have died, Potter was insane for having him acquitted of the wizengamot trials and blasted be Granger for saving him that night when he took Nagini’s bite. He never expected her to have the whole St. Mungus in that bottomless purse of hers, or maybe he did expect but wouldn’t expect the girl to waste it over him. Dittany, Wiggenweld potion, blood replenishes, the antivenin for Nagini’s poison, which she acquired with Healer Smethwyck Merlin knows how, and, ‘for reassurance that you’ll be fine sir,’ she still shoved a bezoar down his throat. He had his life finally free of the whole mess of war but now owing to the damn know-it-all a life debt.</p><p align="justify">He pursed his lips looking again to the smiling face of Harry Potter, Granger and Ronald by his side, holding hands. The golden trio, a perfect couple and a third wheel, Severus snickered watching Potter blink too many times due to the flashes. He could almost see through the black and white of the paper his absurdly green eyes. After the war, everyone expected that eventually, one morning, an owl would bring a whole edition of the Prophet talking about Potter’s marriage with the Weasley girl. He thought the boy would be eager to build a family of his own after everything. Then, Severus recalled, the last month edition who contained a whole page stating that Potter was still the most desired bachelor of wizarding Britain. While sipping his tea, he concluded that he definitely didn’t care and flipped through the pages deciding to play the dumb crosswords.</p><p align="justify">It was in <em>the serpent most common in North America which it’s natural habitat is at the water</em> when he heard a knock at the back door. Frowning while casting a tempus realizing he had at least half an hour before Snyde showed up, Severus went downstairs to answer it. Probably it was some potions ingredient order, they came more often than not and they would always happily leave after a tip and a quick Obliviate who made them forget they just made a delivery to Severus Snape of all people.</p><p align="justify">He didn’t pull any faces while opening the door to no one less than Hermione Granger, Snape groaned internally. Seeing them in the newspaper at least once every three months was more than enough. Since he would never exchange pleasantries with the girl, he stepped aside and allowed her in. It was the most warming welcome that would <em>ever</em> be offered by him. He hated life debts and he was itching to kick her out.</p><p align="justify"> ‘I’m very curious about how you found me Miss Granger’ He said after getting tired of her snooping the potions shelves. She stopped and looked at him. Being much more accustomed to the hate, spiting, and curses behind his back, the soft and kind eyes she threw didn’t fit with what he was used to, it felt wrong and misplaced.</p><p align="justify">‘Weasley’ she said showing the gold wedding ring on her finger. <em>Of course</em>, even as a part of the golden trio Severus should expect that her and Weasley lives would be much less interesting to the media than Potter’s. Saying nothing, he just closed the door behind his back, hoping she would apparate far away just from the daggers he was throwing with his eyes. She looked at the shelves again and sighed pulling the stool behind the counter and taking a seat. <em>Yes, do make yourself at home, please. Do you want my lab too? Maybe my lifetime profit? Since I owe you my forsaken life you can take everything can’t you?</em> He pressed his teeth hard. In all honesty, his desire to curse the girl out was very consuming but his sense of duty was too ingrained in him to actually do anything. And so she sat and he allowed her.</p><p align="justify">‘I need a favour sir’ Severus rolled his eyes, trust a Gryffindor to be too honourable to charge a life debt asking for a favour instead of actually charging it. He crossed his arms waiting for the girl to elaborate further, it’s not like he had any say in the matter. ‘It’s Harry’</p><p align="justify">He wanted to scream and lock himself for a whole week at his potions lab. Maybe go back in time and ask Nagini to bite him earlier so he could die before the blasted trio arrived to save the day. <em>No,</em> he spent too many bloody years living in the function of Potter. He wouldn’t go back to do everything again just because of Granger… Weasley, whatever. She probably saw through his cold forefront.</p><p align="justify">‘I would never have asked it of you if I wasn’t really desperate. Both, Ron and me… He won’t talk to anyone, says he doesn’t want to risk it leaking to the Prophet, but I don’t think it’s only because of that. He’s been closed off even from us. Two months ago we threw a party at the Burrow to celebrate Ron’s birthday and he didn’t even show up’ Snape wanted to laugh, it was quite amusing to imagine the precious everyone else’s golden boy skipping his side quick Weasley party as if it was nothing. Because it was <em>oh, so painful </em>having people who cherished his presence and though it to be important in family gatherings.</p><p align="justify">‘I still fail to care Weasley’ Being able to put as much disgust at the Weasley name as the Granger one she had the audacity to smile at him.</p><p align="justify">‘I don’t think you don’t care, sir. You care about Harry, you really do. He told us you know… About, everything. Your friendship with his mom and how Dumbledore plotted his own death’ He could curse her even while owing a life debt, his hands itched, pity his morals were too high. ‘He’s been taking muggle medicine since after the war... He entered the Auror program with Ron but left it barely after a year and lately he’s been getting worse and worse'</p><p align="justify">An edition of the prophet of a few years ago flared in his mind, it was questioning what Potter would do after giving up the Auror training, they still hadn’t answered what the brat was dabbing into now.</p><p align="justify">‘In fact. I-do-not-care. But since I owe you a life debt, feel free to charge it or leave me be Weasley.’ Her expression hardened and she moved in the stool trying to make herself more comfortable.</p><p align="justify">‘Very well, since you’re the only one I believe he’ll talk to right now or that can help him without getting this leaked. I Hermione Jean Weasley charge you Severus Snape of the life debt you owe me. You shall help Harry James Potter to recover of his addiction and sadness and if you hurt him in any possible way, mentally, physically and emotionally this contract is cancelled and you’ll be back to owe me’ Snape kept listening with his arms crossed, he wanted to smile but didn’t.</p><p align="justify">Trust a Slytherin to bend the <em>oh, so high</em> Gryffindor honour in the name of a greater good. He would never risk helping the girl without she explicitly states she would free him of this stupid debt, and Severus knew very well that she would free him in Potter’s behalf. They always did everything for that boy, Snape thought to be quite unbelievable how daft the boy was for not recognizing the valuable friends he had.</p><p align="justify">‘Very well, now that you got what you wanted. Enlighten me, Weasley, what exactly you expect me to do for the golden boy’ He uncrossed his arms while placing emphasis at the <em>exactly, </em>maybe he could find a loophole and get out of this mess more easily. He would never state that he was the one who got what he wanted, a debt-free life, not before he was certain it was fulfilled and paid for. Severus started walking through his shelves looking for what he wanted while waiting for the girl to formulate her words.</p><p align="justify">‘As I said, he is sad, he’s been closing off and has been taking muggle medicine, antidepressants I think, but no matter how much I tell him to stop he won’t. Sir, these medicines are dangerous. They can be addictive and have a series of side effects. He’s living in a muggle apartment in London and lately started refusing to use magic, I and Ron are very busy but we go to see him every time we can and there are days he barely gets up’ Clearly it was symptoms of depression. Severus wondered how the so loved Potter managed to get himself trapped in such a state. He handled some vials of Draught of peace to the girl and she only stared at it.</p><p align="justify">‘Tell him to take these and lower the dosages of the muggle medicine in half until he gets used to taking lower dosages’ She pursed her lips.</p><p align="justify">‘You won’t get off of this, not this easily. If I wanted a fucking draught of peace I’d have come over and bought it. No, you go there, you give it to him and explain what he should do, and you fucking talk to him. He got you free, he defended you, he worried about your wellbeing, he was the one who… Never mind.’ She stopped her annoying rambling taking a deep breath. ‘My point is that he keeps saying we don’t understand, that I and Ron will never understand. I have a hunch that he thinks you will, that he might talk to you.’ Potter<em> was the one who what?</em> That picked his curiosity. He was itching to ask but he would never give any type of advantage to the girl, Severus put the vials of the draughts in the counter while leaning over it and looking at her.</p><p align="justify">‘And here I am thinking you are at least on the average side of intelligence but still, you have the audacity to think that Potter would ever want to talk to me of all people. Don’t make such jokes Weasley. It makes you look delusional like that Lovegood friend of yours’ Standing on his feet again she looked more exasperated by the second. Severus knew he could be hard to deal with if he wasn’t in the mood, and he rarely was anyway, and seeing her suffer to refute him didn’t even make a scratch at his pity department.</p><p align="justify">‘He will talk and I’m not making jokes, much less asking you to do it. I’m demanding’ She got up of the stool pulling a piece of paper out of her purse. ‘This is his address, be there today. Ron and I will be busy with my work and his Auror training and I’m worried about leaving him alone for too long. Keep him company, please’. The last word sounded much like begging but she left through the same door she came without looking back.</p><p align="justify">Snape stood there looking at the piece of paper as if it would bite him, ‘well... That went hugely unforeseen' he muttered under his breath. Eventually, Severus sighed picking up the piece of paper just when an apparition pop of Snyde's arrival sounded right behind him. Giving him a grumpy good morning and stating they should brew more pepperup potions by a request of St. Mungus. He just shoved Potter’s address deep inside his pocket stating that she could have the lab free to herself this afternoon to do her experimentations. His statement cracked a smile on her face. Snape retired to his lab and spent the morning brewing the pepperups requested.</p><p align="justify">Severus finished everything he could by eleven and a half and getting out of the lab, he went upstairs to prepare something to eat. The stairs creak under his feet made him remember that he had promised himself to fix the house a few months back, not really sure why he should do it if the majority of his time was wasted by down the lab. Severus hummed deep in thought while hearing his stomach grumbling, he was starving since he skipped his breakfast because the annoying Weasley interrupted it.</p><p align="justify">While preparing lunch he couldn’t avoid those vague memories of Spinner’s end. Even though his childhood weren’t the nicest, his mother always cooked garlic spaghetti in special days, in consequence<em> very</em> rarely, because there was nothing much ‘special’ in his childhood, it was nothing but a cheap enough food that she could pretend it to be ‘special' instead of ordinary like their lives truly were. Severus munched through his spaghetti with sheer hate over himself. He hated life debts.</p><p align="justify"> He stopped his motions with the fork midway, the Daily Prophet was staring at him across the four-seat table. Stretching his left arm and grabbing it, Severus flipped a few pages back and there it was, on the first page, Potter’s smiling face, a row of perfect lined white teeth. He frowned, this picture did not make sense with what the know-it-all came to tell and <em>demand</em> of him. Tossing the stupid journal aside and resuming his eating while munching his food with more anger, he decided on kicking the brat's butt out of his bed and getting him smiling to everyone else like that horrible picture in less than a week and so, <em>finally</em>, he would be free. No life debts, owing nothing to nobody, except for a little bit of peace to himself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Severus showed up at the address the Weasley gave him at one and a half, deeply hoping Potter would be elsewhere. He considered ringing the bell but he was disconcertedly confused with how to do it, there was nothing but numbers from 0 to 9 there, he looked at the paper, reading apartment number 448 in neat handwriting that he marked too many times with the bitterest of criticism while still a professor at Hogwarts. Afraid to embarrass himself ringing the wrong bell he opted to cast a quick Alohomora and the gate unlocked just as fast as he pulled his wand up his sleeve.</p><p align="justify">It looked like a nice place, very clean like muggles always were and the gardens were nicely cut, full of flowers. There was a lot of grass on both sides of the path he walked on. There was a lift at the side of the corridor and according to Weasley he lived at the 8<sup>th</sup> floor, he got inside pressing the button taking a deep breath while watching the door close and take him up, it’s not like he had a way out of this whole situation anyway.</p><p align="justify">When he arrived at Potter’s door he adjusted his robes and stared at the number facing him. 448, a quick check at the paper told him he was at the right place. He still had little hope she had written the address wrong. That would give him a little bit of extra time before having to deal with Potter. He dismissed knocking and cast Alohomora again not expecting the door to open. Surely Potter wouldn’t be that thick? The door opened. He cursed under his breath, honestly, the boy really had a death wish, not even do a simple warding at his own home? Here he was thinking even stupidity had a limit, and wrong he was again.</p><p align="justify">He opened the door to get inside and darkness greeted him. The curtains were all pulled closed, the silence inside was almost deafening, and at first sight, it looked like no one lived in the place. With a little bit of looking around, he saw a sneaker tossed close to the door, a take-out box forgotten at the coffee table and he counted three empty glasses forgotten over things, one at the counter, another at the coffee table and one at the floor next to the couch. Severus rolled his eyes, it seemed the boy was sloppy even with his home.</p><p align="justify">‘Mione?’ The voice was tiny and muffled. It twisted something inside him, it didn’t make sense to the image he had in his head of the war hero. ‘…thought you wouldn’t come today’ Snape took a breath and walked silently and slowly to the corridor where Potter’s voice was coming from. Turning a look to the first door at the right he faced a very dark bedroom, a small lump below mountains of blankets told him someone was under them. Snape considered for a brief second to scold the boy, it was one bloody and a half already.</p><p align="justify">‘Not Hermione’ He stated simply, watching Potter fumbling with the blankets and finally sitting to look at him just like a deer caught in headlights. ‘Get up Potter, we have some talking to do’ He left to the living room.</p><p align="justify">Looking around he sighed, he took his wand waving the curtains open and allowing some light to enter the room, the glasses and the take out box floated to the kitchen. He heard feet dragging in the corridor and watched Potter walking slowly towards him while squeezing his eyes, unaccustomed to the light, his glasses hanging crooked at the tip of his nose. He was wearing navy blue shorts that looked too big for him, his clothes had always looked big since he can remember Potter, Severus wondered for a second if the boy should start shopping at the kid’s section. He was still the scrawny, fragile thing he remembered teaching potions to, it seemed that would never change, not even after the darkest Wizard of all times downfall. Thinking about it and looking at Potter now, it was rather unbelievable that he was the one who ended such war.</p><p align="justify">But right now he also looked somehow worse than the time he killed the bastard. He couldn’t point a finger, probably because it was more than one thing combined, he looked unhealthily skinny, too pale and way too tired for someone who was sleeping until a few minutes ago. His shirt was white and ragged at the collar, Severus couldn’t believe that James Potter son had so much disinterest for his own appearance, he always considered them painfully alike. However, he remembered James to be too concerned with his looks all the time, vanity was a big thing for him.</p><p align="justify">He watched Potter stare as if processing what was happening. Severus wanted to roll his eyes in his skull and curse his own life. He made a vow to protect the boy and fulfilled it, people shouldn’t also expect of him to fix his broken pieces. That was to expect too much out of him. As if waking up from a haze the boy shook his head slightly and walked to the kitchen. The only thing separating it from the living room was a counter with two wooden stools. The small flowerpot decorating the counter had a tiny plant that looked more agonized than himself in this ambient. He walked and sat at the stool waving the wand and recovering the poor plant, it probably wasn’t seeing much water, or light. He looked around, there were a few shelves with some pictures, most of them were of the Weasley and the annoying girl who <em>demanded</em> him to be here. He looked at the brat who was fumbling with a teapot, his hands were shaking and the boy looked close of a collapse.</p><p align="justify">With an annoyed grunt, Severus got up and walked to the kitchen. Potter stopped dead in his tracks while Severus picked up the teapot off his hands. ‘Sit, I’ll make the tea. You could never brew at my classes, therefore, I don’t expect you to make anything decent in a kitchen’ He would <em>never</em> admit having hoped to crack a smile in Potter’s face or an irritated pull of eyebrows, <em>anything</em> but this dull non-existent reaction. Potter sat without complaint while Severus filled the teapot with water, in silence. After he lit the fire and put it to boil he turned around leaning on the sink, crossing his arms he stared, analysing the boy. They stayed like that for several minutes while he considered to just use legilimency on him to see what was passing inside his peanut brain, but Potter opened his mouth and he sat the idea aside, for now.</p><p align="justify">‘Mione sent you didn’t she?’ He was looking at his own hands. Severus didn’t answer. ‘It’s alright, I’m alright. I’m sorry she bothered you, sir’ Severus let out a snarl.</p><p align="justify">‘Don’t lie to my face boy. You’re a rag. It’s almost two in the afternoon and you were sleeping as if it was midnight. Do not underestimate me, telling nonsense like these. I’m smarter than that and you know it’ He expected the boy to cringe or burst out crying with how fragile he looked. He did none, actually, he did nothing. His own hands were still more interesting than Severus’ face and in all fairness, Severus didn’t like his face either. If it was even possible, Harry slumped even more on his seat, he scratched his eyes crooking his glasses again and not bothering to fix it. This image of defeat didn’t sit well in Severus’ stomach. ‘Are you even listening?’</p><p align="justify">‘It’s just the pills sir... I’ll be fine’ Severus snarled once more, the few steps he took to the counter were done in pure rage. He kept his arms crossed not trusting them to not fly to Potter’s throat and shake him to reality. The boy finally looked at him, green eyes clouded as if he had taken a whole vial of Veritaserum.</p><p align="justify">‘What pills?’ He said after taking a deep breath, scream with Potter wouldn’t do, he remembered what Granger demanded of him. He shouldn’t harm him in <em>any</em> way. Potter quietly got up and walked off disappearing in the corridor. He pressed his eyes with the point of his fingers, feeling tiredness creeping over him. He didn’t even know how to deal with his own emotions, imagine others. He was a practical creature, he didn’t like to dwell on feelings, he would just shove them deep and lock the door. He had zero ideas how to be emotionally comforting and that was what Granger demanded of him, blasted be that girl. He could clean the place, leave calming potions regularly, hell, he could even give realistic bits of advice to Potter but he couldn’t hug the boy while he cried his eyes out or just… Be there for him. He honestly didn’t know how to do that.</p><p align="justify">He came back with a flask in his hand placing it on the counter, Severus could see where Hermione came from, she would expect a potioneer’s advice over addiction to be more helpful than any other, especially if the healers in St. Mungus couldn’t be trusted to not leak something like this to the Prophet. Yet, at the same time, Severus had no idea about muggle medicines, only that they were nasty stuff, toxic and hard to get out. He picked up the flask approaching it to his face it read Xanax at the label. He turned it in front of his eyes, it looked like candy,  Severus opened it and sniffed, it had no smell at all. He saw Potter smile at him, it wasn’t much of a smile but it was almost.</p><p align="justify">‘They’re pills sir, you swallow them with water, or juice, or milk, or any liquid, they don’t taste and don’t smell’ Severus deposited it back on the counter. ‘I’m taking Prozac too, but I ran out this week’ Potter’s hand were still trembling. The water started boiling and Severus turned around to turn it off.</p><p align="justify">‘And why didn’t simply take calming draughts?’ He put the hot water in the cups and placed the teabags in it to infuse. He turned around placing on the counter a vial of Draught of peace, Potter stared at it.</p><p align="justify">‘Is this Draught of peace?’ Severus nodded firmly. Harry reached for it. ‘Uh, Thanks sir’ A long silence stretched between them. Severus didn’t know what to say and Potter looked like he was far away.</p><p align="justify">‘Will you leave this muggle poison?’ green eyes focused again at him.</p><p align="justify">‘Uh… I… No, potions don’t work. I’ve tried, they… stopped working. Thin elbows were placed on the counter to serve as a pillow to Potter’s head. Severus sighed picking up the two teacups placing one in front of the boy.</p><p align="justify">‘Do you’ He bit his tongue, he had no idea how to do this. ‘That’s because you’ve built a tolerance to them’ The boy nodded without voicing anything. ‘And now you’re taking these things and look at you boy, you’re barely functional’ He got his head off his arms but was still slouched over the stool.</p><p align="justify">‘You don’t get it?’ He looked honestly confused. ‘I thought you were the one who could understand... I tried sir, for at least a year, every time I went to sleep he was there, Tom, lurking in my head, promising blood, and then I’d remember everyone, Tonks, Remus, Fred, Lavender, Collin, Mad-eye, Dobby, Dumbledore...’ Severus closed his eyes on the last one, it felt like a punch to his gut. ‘They’re all there, it was my fault, wasn’t it? How much you had to sacrifice for me, and all of them, the order, what they did, I didn’t… After the pensieve and your memories I expected to die, I didn’t make plans in case I survived, I just… I hoped to die, sir. Because, you know… Magic was… the best thing I’ve ever had but I think it’s cursed, I think I’m cursed.’</p><p align="justify">‘Nonsense. Why would you think you’re cursed?’ Harry’s eyes were dead.</p><p align="justify">‘Everyone dies. Everyone leaves. I thought I had Sirius but no… I thought, I thought I could pull it off with the Weasley’s help and I did for a while but then Fred’s death ruined everything, it destroyed them too, and then Ginny…’ The boy gave a tiny shrug. ‘It’s my fault. She’s happier now that I left them, they’re happier. I just… I think I ruin everything I touch sir… I ruined the Dursleys too didn’t I?’ He looked at Snape, his eyes were clear like water but so broken that Snape felt at loss of what to do. How the Weasley expected him to fix someone this ruined?</p><p align="justify">‘Drink your tea’ It was all he could say to the boy, he picked the cup and took a small sip. He wasn’t hoping to spend time with the kid but he clearly needed help. He could say he’d do it in the name of Albus’s death, he could say it was because of that damned life debt. But his indignation when Albus told him Potter had to die replayed in the back of his head, it stopped being in the name of his dearest friend Lily very long ago. Albus twinkling eyes when he asked if he got attached to the boy shined in the back of his eyelids. He picked the medicine shoving It deep in his pocket, Potter just looked. ‘I’m confiscating these’ His eyes shined in desperation.</p><p align="justify">‘No, no, no, no, Sir, you don’t understand I need… I need it, I can’t… I can’t function without it, I can’t sleep I…’</p><p align="justify">‘You’re already not functioning Potter!’ He lost his temper, he didn’t need a tantrum right now. He sighed ruining his fingers through his hair. ‘This is how this is going to work, I will regulate the dosages of this thing. You need a break, you can’t live your life through a haze of medications. So I will give them to you regularly so you won’t abuse it, If you start having trouble to sleep I’ll administer calming draughts to you, small dosages that won’t get you addicted in anything else. It will take a while, obviously, but you need to step out of this loop’ Potter said nothing.</p><p align="justify">‘You’re only helping me because ‘Mione charged her life debt’ Severus nodded seeing no point in denying.</p><p align="justify">‘And use my help wisely, it won’t happen again since she had only one life debt to charge. You have painfully faithful friends Potter, I would never waste a life debt on you’ Harry scoffed.</p><p align="justify">‘You and I both then, I don’t have faithful friends. I have stupid ones. Give me my pills and leave me be. Please sir’ The last sentence was so tiny and fragile that almost looked like the boy was begging, it caught Snape off guard.</p><p align="justify">‘I can’t afford your refusal, my life debt is to Weasley’ Harry sighed looking suddenly much older than twenty.</p><p align="justify">‘You can, you came, you did everything you could to help, I’m the one who doesn’t want to be helped. Your life debt is paid’ Anger flared in the green eyes and Severus wasn’t certain of how to deal with that too. He was so out of his comfort zone that it was disconcerting. Potter waved his hand and suddenly the blasted flask of muggle poison appeared in his hand. Severus tapped his pocket. Damned be this boy. ‘You can go now sir’</p><p align="justify">‘No, I can not’ If he wanted to throw a fit Severus would always be a good match. He waved his own hand and the flask was banished to the countertop of his rooms above his apothecary. Harry did nothing, he just got up dragging his feet back to his bedroom. Severus followed him watching him throw himself among the blankets. ‘How many of these do you take per day?’</p><p align="justify">‘Two’ His voice was muffled and low again. ‘And one of Prozac but I don’t like it, makes me feel funny’</p><p align="justify">‘Elaborate it Potter’ He crossed his arms leaning at the doorframe. The boy moved under the covers, Severus could see nothing but a lump now.</p><p align="justify">‘I feel like I’m not myself… Like… I’m out of my body, like… Floating but not floating like… Like I can see everything from above as it was a different person. Like, if I move my arm it’s not me moving it I’m just sitting watching someone else move it you know? I have this when I take only the Alprazolam but When I take the Fluoxetine it’s worse... It’s normal though’ He shrugged, Snape had no idea how to answer.</p><p align="justify">‘It’s not normal Potter!’ He wanted to shake the boy to reality.</p><p align="justify">‘It is. It’s called depersonalization, a fancy name for a shitty feeling. These things have this side kicks’ Severus sighed, he’d need to research on muggle medicine now, how they worked, what they did, and he’d need to make a throughout research if these medicines would react with his potions. He needed his lab but he honestly didn’t trust Potter to be alone. Granger told him not to leave him alone either.</p><p align="justify">‘Get up we’re leaving’ Potter sat, it looked like it took all his strength to do it.</p><p align="justify">‘Leaving where?’ And now Potter looked too young. Way too young to be going through all this shit.</p><p align="justify">‘My lab, I have searching to do. Put some decent clothes and come on’ He left, giving room to the boy. It took at least twenty minutes for the door to open, that was the vanity that he thought it was inherited from James. But Potter came out wearing an old pair of jeans, too battered to even look purposefully destroyed, a washed out shirt peeking out of a thick wool pullover too big for his frame. Severus commented nothing on the boy’s appearance, he extended his arm locking the apartment with his wand and casting a few quick warding spells over the place.</p><p align="justify">Potter touched his pulse, his grasp so light it could almost go unnoticed. Severus apparated directly to his lab.</p><p align="justify">‘And here I was thinking I really had the lab free of you for a whole day’ Snyde said without tearing the look off of her concocting.</p><p align="justify">‘Did you lock the store before coming in?’ Potter let go of his arm.</p><p align="justify">‘Of course, I’m not stupid’ She said turning around, she stretched her neck looking behind Snape and seeing no one less than Harry Potter. She arched one eyebrow sending questioning looks to her boss. ‘Wow, finally we can put one of those stickers at our vitrine, Harry Potter has been here’ Severus snorted, and Harry gave her a smile. ‘I’m Merula Snyde. A pleasure to meet the saviour of the Wizarding world, I personally loved how you ended Voldemort, I’ll be sure to get far away from you when you use an Expelliarmus. My parents were all for the pure-blood thing, they’re in Azkaban, first war thing. I grew out of it, It’s stupid anyway so thank you, sir, for your service. I’m a fan, I also love Quidditch, pity you’re a Gryffindor but well… not everything is perfect’ She was frantically shaking Harry’s hand and Snape was thorn between snort at the girls rambling or curse her.</p><p align="justify">Potter looked lost but eventually, he cracked a tiny smile 'Please call me Harry, nice to meet you too' Snape grunted, Harry-so-fucking-polite-Potter was annoying to an unending extent. Snyde smiled back and noticing his bad mood made a quick exit to her own cauldron, at least the girl had some brain in her.</p><p align="justify">‘You can go upstairs and rest if you want. I'll take a while on my research. Is there any book that explains how this medicine of yours function?’ Harry looked very small from Snape’s point of view.</p><p align="justify">'Uh, yeah when you buy them they come with an info leaflet' Snape arched an eyebrow. ‘I threw it away' The sentence sounded very alike the excuses Potter used to get out of his detentions.</p><p align="justify">‘Because you’re an imbecile' Merula snorted from her seat, Severus didn’t bother to glare at her. 'Where am I supposed to get one of these now?’ Potter patted his pockets retrieving a wallet. He pulled a few pieces of paper.</p><p align="justify">‘This is the prescription for them. And some cash, go buy them and you’ll have your package leaflet with everything you need to know' Snape sighed picking what Potter was giving to him, muggle money was fragile, nothing but paper. He had vain memories of his father drinking to oblivion using these pieces of paper, he apparated to a discreet area of muggle London without saying anything.</p><p align="justify">When he got back it was only Merula in the lab, he <em>didn’t </em>worry for a single second. <strike></strike></p><p align="justify"><strong><em><strike>‘</strike></em></strong>Golden-war-hero-boy is at your rooms, he went upstairs as soon as you left. I think he’s sleeping, he looks like shit. What’s going on? Thought you dreaded him' She looked up of her notes glaring at Severus.<strike></strike></p><p align="justify">'Keep your nosy face where it belongs. I still can fire you' She had the audacity to laugh.</p><p align="justify">‘Yeah, because anyone you hire will deal just fine with your moodiness. You need to shag Snape, maybe it will lift your humour' She smiled slyly. ‘In fact... The golden boy is at your bed right now, be a little shrewd and use your Slytherin resourcefulness' Snape grabbed her own notes hitting her own head with it.</p><p align="justify">She laughed, she knew he wouldn’t hurt her, maybe say something potentially hurtful one time or another but she knew not to take it to heart because Snape hardly said things intending to hurt those he appreciated. Most of the time, when he worried about someone, the hurtful things he said where the deep truth with the intents of help. Merula pitied the man for his incapability of sugarcoating his words, it put a strain of all of his relationships as most people don’t know how to deal with his salty personality.</p><p align="justify">‘If you make another comment remotely like that you will find your butt in the streets' He left upstairs, leaving Merula still smiling slyly. Right, because all of the sacrifices he made to Harry Potter were <em>only</em> to pay debts, no attachment to the Gryffindor <em>at all.</em></p><p align="justify">Snape still felt like cursing the girl, as if he would ever do anything like that to a scrawny barely functional kid. He stepped in his rooms, it was more like a flat honestly. He opened the door at the end of the stairs facing a small squared kitchen a four-seat table was at his right, a wall at the right with a window illuminating a small sink and a stove at the left of it. At the other wall in front of him, across his small rooms was a half-open door leading to his bedroom.</p><p align="justify">Snape went there stepping in darkness, he did say Potter could rest. He was laying on the right side of the bed, blankets covering his small frame and he looked very tiny on it, there was a bedside table at the left, the side he slept every day, the book-ingredients for master potions- he was reading the previous night was still the same way he left. Severus cursed under his breath, the flask of the goddamn pills was tossed over the book, open. He felt like strangling Potter or at least screaming at his face.</p><p align="justify">He sighed scratching his forehead and shifting his weight from one leg to another. How this wrecked boy could be the same one smiling to the papers just yesterday? He walked to the bedside table, the old wooden floor cracking under his weight. He picked up the flask shoving in his pocket while making a mental note to leave it where Potter couldn’t find. He left closing the door behind his back and heading to his lab again.</p><p align="justify">Merula said nothing else when he showed up again and Severus was grateful for her lack of wordiness. He sat in front of his cauldron opening the box of Prozac and Xanax he bought pulling the leaflets Potter mentioned.</p><p align="justify">The letters were tiny and Severus used an Engorgio charm on it. More than half an hour later and he was still reading de side effects both of these medications had. Merula finished her notes and went back to reopen the apothecary at three. Nausea, fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, confusion, low blood pressure, memory problems, decreased coordination. He remembered Potter’s trembling hands while reading the last one. The list was huge, it also talked about dependency and that it couldn’t be taken with alcohol. It had more side effects than any potion he had ever seen and he couldn’t grasp the fact that Potter would take something like this on his own will.</p><p align="justify">The draught of peace also had calming effects but it barely scratched the surface of what these medicines did. Not that it was more or less effective but, definitely, the muggle pills acted in a deeper level and also a more harming one. He scratched his primary idea of administering potions to lessen the withdrawal symptoms. He could not risk mixing any potion with this, not if he wanted to see Potter wide awake and well. He picked the Prozac box looking at it, he had questions to Potter but the boy probably was still sound asleep so he decided he’d brew random potions to fill up his shelves. He remembered Merula mentioning the previous day a request of Felix Felicis and he decided to do that, the sooner he started, the sooner the six-month stewing would be over.</p><p align="justify">The rest of the afternoon was spent on brewing the potion. Merula came to the lab around six telling she’d wrapped up the day and left, it was nearly eight when he was about to put everything in a stasis spell and rest for a while that he heard the crack on his stairs and Potter showed at the door of his lab. He was shivering and had Snape’s favourite blanket wrapped up tightly around his shoulders.</p><p align="justify">'I've read the leaflets. I still fail to see how you took these things without any concern for your well-being. It is more damaging than beneficial' He finally waved his wand putting everything on stasis.</p><p align="justify">'It's not. Believe me, sir, they do me good... They did... I don’t know anymore' green eyes stared deeply in pure black ones. Severus pulled a chair by his side and trembling Potter sat. ‘Uh... I...’ Harry laughed in an honest way, one that Severus thought the boy didn’t have in him anymore 'Do you remember... Uh... Roony Wazlib?’ His eyes were suddenly shining and for once he looked exactly like a twenty-year-old.</p><p align="justify">'Roonil' Severus corrected him, a small side smile at his face. ‘I also remember the detention and how you said it was unfair' The boy frowned.</p><p align="justify">‘No sir... It wasn’t. I... Malfoy too. I hurt him right? Uh... Sectumsempre right?’ Severus frowned.</p><p align="justify">'Sectumsempra Potter and Malfoy had it coming that day. I imagined Slughorn to be more intelligent than leaving such a book around his shelves for random students to pick it up. Where is it now anyway? Harry looked lost in his own thoughts.</p><p align="justify">‘Uh... I... I think it was destroyed, sir... I left... The room of requirement. Yes, I left there and then the Fiendfyre probably burned it' Severus nodded, of course, he didn’t like to hear his favourite book and all his notes and such knowledge was destroyed. But on the other hand, it was better left destroyed than in the hands of another kid who would try to use dark spells against his enemies again. He stared at the boy, his speech was slouchy and he seemed to be having memory problems too. Severus didn’t like it.</p><p align="justify">‘Are you hungry?’ Potter shook his head. ‘If you’re barely presentable right now and worrying so much your side-kicks tell me how come you seemed so happy on yesterday’s Daily prophet picture?’ The million dollar question was out now.</p><p align="justify">‘What? What picture?’ Potter looked at him as if he’d grown another head.</p><p align="justify">‘The three-year anniversary picture Potter'</p><p align="justify">‘I didn’t leave home yesterday' He shrugged as if it was not a big deal. Severus hummed deep in thought.</p><p align="justify">‘Then how come your picture ended up at the papers alongside the perfect couple?’ Potter just shrugged. 'Polyjuice?’</p><p align="justify">'Mione does know how to make it' He looked pale, his hands didn’t stop trembling. ‘I think I should go home, sir. Uh... I... You bought the pills right?’</p><p align="justify">'I told you I read the leaflets the moment you came in so obviously I bought them Potter' Harry said nothing to his rashness.</p><p align="justify">'Can I have them?’</p><p align="justify">‘No’ They didn’t argue over it any further. 'Tell me the hours of the day you take them'</p><p align="justify">‘Uh... Whenever? Like... When I feel bad I take Prozac and when I start to get edgy I take Xanax and when I want to sleep too' Severus could punch something right now.</p><p align="justify">'Thought you said you took them twice a day' Foggy green eyes blinked at him as if trying to process what he said.</p><p align="justify">'Uh... Yeah... Twice that’s right at night and mornings' Snape arched one eyebrow.</p><p align="justify">‘And whenever too?’ Potter’s shoulder slumped.</p><p align="justify">'Whenever It’s really really bad days sir. Most of the times taking twice knock me out enough'</p><p align="justify">‘Very well, I thought about associating it with potions to avoid withdrawal but I won’t do such a thing. These medicines are dangerous on their own. I’ll lower the dosages slowly. Right now you’ll take a full pill at night and three-quarters of one at mornings alright?’ Potter nodded.</p><p align="justify">‘And the Prozac?’</p><p align="justify">'One in the afternoons, we’ll take you off the Alprazolam first, we’ll worry about the Prozac later' Potter tensioned on the chair.</p><p align="justify">'Uh... I tried that sir... I get edgy. Alprazolam’s the only thing that gets me to calm down.’</p><p align="justify">'We'll take a trial, Potter, if it’s not working we try another way'</p><p align="justify">'But sir...’</p><p align="justify">‘ENOUGH! Thanks to your little friend I’m trapped with your junkie ass now, we’ll do this and we’ll do it my way, wanting it or not you hear me? I don’t care how tragic life is Potter, I told you this once in occlumency lessons and I tell you again. Life-is-NOT-fair. I’d never help you if it wasn’t for your friends, don’t think for a second that I’m doing this out of the goodness of my heart. For once, get your head out of your own ass and start realising you have friends that are worried about you and want to actually help you before there’s not much left of your brain!’ Severus saw the green eyes shine with tears, it made him wonder if he fucked up royally or if he made Potter see what was in front of his nose. ‘You’ll be staying here tonight, I’ll keep an eye on you'</p><p align="justify">He picked the Xanax bottle in his pocket and opened it extending one to the boy. Potter picked it up and left quietly the green eyes looked lost again when he looked Severus one last time before leaving. The stairs creaking were the only indication that he was going upstairs instead of out of his life.</p><p align="justify">Severus looked at his potion in stasis and realized he’d rather brew for a few more hours before going up and to deal with the boy with this thought it n his mind he removed the stasis of his cauldron and kept brewing until ten.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His kitchen looked almost normal when he finally came up, almost being the keyword. His heart missed a beat when he looked over his table and saw the bottle of Firewhisky he kept in his cupboard. It still had approximately a quarter inside it and he remembered exactly that the last time he tasted the amber liquid the bottle was half empty. Snape cursed among his breath, hurrying to his bedroom. Potter was thrown across his bed, his body half covered with the same blanket he was hugging earlier in his lab. The vial of draught of peace he gave him at his apartment was empty, thrown on the bedside table and Snape worried the boy might be dead, he couldn’t see him breathing from his point of view.</p><p align="justify">He stepped closer making a quick check on his vitals. His heart rate was extremely low and so was his breathing but he was alright. He pulled a chair from his kitchen next door using an Accio and sat at the bedside watching Potter just in case of an emergency. Guilty swallowing him while he looked at the closed eyelids, he shouldn’t have been so rough on his words earlier. But he couldn’t grasp how daft the boy was being, just because of a few harsh and honest words he didn’t expect to nurture death wishes on the brat.</p><p align="justify">Deciding to think on the next morning about which course of action would prove more effective, he got up transfiguring the chair he sat just now in a mattress while finally coming to the conclusion that he should write a list of life debts Potter owed him. He’d charge all of them making him scrub dirty and nasty cauldrons for the rest of his miserable life. Too tired to bother himself to take a bath he cast cleaning charms over himself and the half-alive boy sleeping on his bed. With his skin prickling of the recent cleansing, Severus drifted off to sleep.</p>
