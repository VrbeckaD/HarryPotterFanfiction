    <p>Dean woke up on a Saturday morning to the sun filtering into his bedroom right onto his boyfriend's face. Dean thought that this was the most beautiful sight in the world. He had big plans for the day so he got up and went to the bathroom to shower. </p><p> </p><p>   Seamus woke up to the sound of the shower turning on. He had taken a shower last night like he usually did as he usually was absolutely not a morning person but today he was excited because he also had huge plans for today. He got dressed, combed his ever unruly hair, and went to the kitchen to try and make breakfast which was quite a task for the boy who blew up or burned everything that involved even the slightest bit of heat.</p><p> </p><p>   Dean got out of the shower and got dressed before walking into the kitchen. Seamus was sitting on the floor rummaging through the cabinets, very obviously looking for something. "Whatcha lookin for Sea?" Dean asked with an amused look on his face.</p><p> </p><p>    Seamus closed the cabinet and leaned back with a small huff. "I am <em>looking </em> for the pans, but I can't find them. You'd think that I would be able to find some pans in my own apartment!" He said, clearly agitated</p><p> </p><p>    Dean smiled slightly before sitting down next to Seamus and wrapping his arms around his waist. "Well maybe, just maybe, if you didn't blow up everything that you tryed to cook, you would cook more, and know where the pans were. But don't worry about it. I'll make breakfast today." He kissed his boyfriend on the cheek and stood up, holding his hand out to Seamus.</p><p> </p><p>    Seamus sighed with defeat and took Dean's hand. He stood up and pulled Dean into a quick kiss. They both smiled and Seamus walked into the living room to read a book that he was in the middle of about transfiguration.</p><p> </p><p>    Dean turned around and grabbed a pan from one of the cabinets that his unusually short boyfriend couldn't reach. He made a few pancakes for each of them.</p><p>Seamus smiled up at Dean as he came into the room with breakfast. He took his plate and ate his pancakes. "So, don't forget that we have to meet Ginny, Hermione, and the rest at diagon alley today." He said casually.</p><p> </p><p>    Dean nodded slightly. "We haven't seen them since Ron and Hermione's wedding. It'll be nice to see the old gang. Also Ginny and Hermione of course." </p><p> </p><p>    Seamus finished his food and took both Dean's and his plates into the kitchen to wash them. He grabbed a small box hidden  in a low cupboard and went back to the living room. "You ready to go Dean?" He asked with a smile.</p><p>Dean stood up from the couch. "Yeah, I just have to grab something from the bedroom." He ran to a drawer in his bedroom and also grabbed a small box. He walked back to where Seamus was waiting. "Shall we?" he asked.</p><p> </p><p>    Seamus smiled and took Dean's arm. "We shall." And they aperated to diagon alley.</p>
