    <p>Poachers. Smugglers. Horrible people that Newt did not like at all. A ship lined up neatly at an old dock, but there were only two crates the men were fighting over. Both looked nondescript, but one was stamped with a local destination and the other was stamped with the letters NY. The local one, Newt knew it was the horned serpent stolen from the local village. Their guardian that kept them safe and they kept fed with tribute.</p><p>The other crate was a mystery.</p><p>Nonetheless, Newt knew it more than likely housed some innocent creature that needed his help. Newt was here to help, and he would. His help came in the form of a quick duel that had both men bound and ready to be picked up when Newt called them in to the local law enforcement. Pity them, said enforcers were very strict about their new poaching laws.</p><p>With them out of the way, Newt turned his attention to the crates. The mystery one had him curious to see what else these men had been smuggling. Upon examination, he discovered the crate was not going to NY, but had come from NY. NY… what city could NY be?</p><p>Shaking his head, Newt waved his wand to open the crate… and was promptly tackled to the ground. </p><p>Whatever it was, it was humanoid, but it was pitch black. It’s skin was like black leather, and its eyes were devoid of pupil or iris. It had hair, or so Newt thought… but its limbs were long and spindly like spider legs.</p><p>He stared, staying still… waiting to see what the creature would do. </p><p>It blinked… then opened its mouth wide.</p><p>Wider.</p><p>And wider.</p><p>Its lower jaw opened until it was down in what Newt would have guessed was the chest cavity. Something long and just as black slithered out of the gaping maw, leaking black oil onto Newt and the ground. </p><p>Its tongue.</p><p>But before Newt could do anything else, the creature was gone, disappearing into the night. Newt slowly got up, wiping the oil from his shirt and vest. It wasn’t exactly oil, but it had the same consistency. </p><p>Whatever it was, it came from that beast, and Newt had never seen a beast like it before. He was excited. Maybe he would see it again. Maybe he’d be able to study it. Add it to his book.</p><p>But for now, Newt had to return the serpent in the other crate. </p><p>The village was grateful to Newt for returning their guardian. The snake quickly slithered off to it’s home, curling around its tributes and settling down. The village elder, a man named Dow, approached with his translator and kissed Newt’s hand.</p><p>“We thank you for what you have done,” his translator, Jaril, said. “We are in your debt, Scamander. Please allow us to repay your kindness.”</p><p>“No need,” Newt smiled and dusted off his coat. “Always a pleasure to help a beast.” He paused and looked thoughtful. “Actually, maybe you can help me. The poachers had another beast in a crate and I’ve never seen it before. It looked like a human, but it was so spindly and kind of stretched out. It had black skin and these blank eyes and an enormous mouth.”</p><p>Jaril’s eyes went wide as he translated it to Dow. Dow frowned and spoke solemnly as if he were speaking of the dead.</p><p>“They are called The Unclothed,” said Jaril. “People who had their skin stolen. They wander in darkness and shadow until they reclaim their skin. It is the only way for them to become human again. If they never get their skin… they are lost to this world.”</p><p>Newt’s eyes went wide as well. He’d never heard of anything like this. Was it a beast? A curse? What was that thing he saw in the crate? How did it get here?</p><p>“The Unclothed…” he said softly. “How horrible…”</p><p>“Scamander, the sun is going down. Please accept shelter with us through the night. We shall have a meal in your honor before you leave in the morning,” said Jaril. He gestured at one of the houses, smiling warmly.</p><p>Newt nodded. It was too late to leave now. Too dangerous. He followed Jaril to his room to get ready for bed.</p>
