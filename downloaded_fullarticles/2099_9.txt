    <p>Masamune Takano stared at the note that he held in his shaking hands with growing anger and heartbreak the longer he held onto it, Ritsu Onodera and himself had been living together and had been dating for 2 years now. He was confused as he had really thought that the relationship was going well but now Ritsu had left him, abandoned him once again.</p><p>He read the note for what seemed like the hundredth time, it read:</p><p>Takano,</p><p>I'm sorry to do this especially with everything we've been through together but I'm not sure I really feel the same way as you do anymore. I've already resigned at Marukawa and packed everything I own, and am leaving this apartment. Also, I have changed my mobile number and email so please do not try to contact me. Thank you for being so patient with me over the years, I really appreciate it, I know it must've been very difficult dealing with someone so jaded and stupid.</p><p>Ritsu Onodera</p><p>Tears of both anger and anguish ran down Masamune's face, he wished Ritsu had bothered to talk to him about this instead in a stupid note. He had no say about this situation ...just like last time, Ritsu just left him behind without a proper goodbye...</p><p>Angry with Ritsu he crumpled up the note in the trash, took a beer from the fridge and started drinking away his pain.</p><p>'Damn it Ritsu ...We could have worked it out, I'm sure of it' he thought bitterly to himself miserably as he sat down on his couch.</p><p>He thought about maybe calling up Yokozawa to talk to him about this but ...he couldn't, Yokozawa had been against the relationship from the very beginning.</p><p>In silence, he sat down on the couch, with tears streaming down his face and his mind replaying memories of Ritsu over and over again in his head. He sat there all evening drinking, until he fell asleep in front of the TV.</p><p>The next day he didn't really do anything productive...he was tired and feeling miserable without Ritsu with him. He wasn't looking forward to going to work tomorrow, his fellow employees at Marukawa Publishing were sure to say something. He knew for certain that Yokozawa would ...he knew that Yokozawa would be angry about it and angry at Ritsu Onodera. He really didn't want to hear anyone badmouth his now ex-boyfriend just yet.</p><p>Yokozawa had tried calling him today... Takano just let it ring, as he lay on his bed staring blankly at the ceiling above him. He couldn't deal with his friend right now ...he just couldn't.</p><p>He spent the rest the day thinking about Ritsu and the memories they shared together in this apartment and for what seemed like the hundredth time that day he cried. Cried for what he lost and for what he was never going to have again.</p><p>Takano narrowed his now puffy and sore eyes with slight anger , he hated feeling this way ...he felt so miserable and full of regret and memories he wished he now could just forget. He let out bitter laughter escape his lips, laughter that soon turned into sobs of anguish.</p><p>"Why..." "Why did you leave me again? " He couldn't help but sob out, tears running down his cheeks, one after another.</p><p>"What am I supposed to do now without him?"</p><p>After a while the heartbroken man fell asleep, crying to himself on his bed, feeling a mixture of fear, anger and misery. Sincerely dreading the next day where he would have to go to work and pretend that everything was normal.</p><p>The next day Takano reluctantly got himself out of bed and headed for the shower, he looked really terrible. He hadn't gotten enough sleep and his eyes were still very sore and red from crying for most of the time since Ritsu had left the apartment. In the shower he let the water wash away his tears and he closed his eyes for a moment, trying not to think of Ritsu.</p><p>After getting out of the shower he dried himself off, washed his face and got dressed in some clothes, then after having breakfast he brushed his teeth and headed off to work.</p><p>As he sat down at his desk he avoided looking anyone in the eye and set to his work. During work he was in such a depressed disposition that nobody dared speak to him , he seemed to be quick to yell and lash out at people and ignored anyone who mentioned Ritsu's name or tried to ask why he wasn't there anymore .</p><p>Takano didn't want to talk about Ritsu to anybody , it was much too soon and he had harbored a love for the stubborn brunette for far too long that it was far too painful to even think about at the current moment .</p><p>At the end of the day it was a relief to get home , but when he arrived home he saw Yokozawa waiting for him .</p><p>"Hello Yokozawa" muttered Takano .</p><p>Yokozawa frowned , " Masamune ...I called you yesterday , you never answered ."</p><p>"I know...I was preoccupied...I"m sorry." Takano said softly .</p><p>"Masamune? ...Masamune ..are you alright?"</p><p>Takano couldn't really say anything , his eyes widened slightly when Yokozawa then wrapped his arms around him .</p><p>"It's alright Masamune ...I'm here for you , do you want to talk about it? "</p><p>Takano shook his head , "No , not really , I don't want to talk about what happened at the moment but you can come in if you want."</p><p>Yokozawa gave a nod and let go of the other man , "Okay"</p><p>The two men then entered the apartment room and they talked for a while until Takano told his friend to leave.</p><p>A year later Takano was still devastated about Ritsu leaving him , though he still did his best to act as if everything was normal and do his job . He didn't cry about it anymore though , but sometimes he would drink alcohol to forget his pain . One day when he was returning from work and was opening up his door he saw another man do the same at the room where Ritsu used to live in .</p><p>The man at Ritsu's old room was of average height , messy black hair , green eyes behind a pair of black glasses and had a very slender body .</p><p>Takano couldn't help but stare at his new neighbour , in a way the man was very attractive . He watched the man for a few minutes until the man entered the apartment room . A couple of days later he knocked on the door of his neighbour , after giving some serious thought about it he decided he would pay his neighbour a visit . Takano wanted to move on from Ritsu , he wanted the pain to go away and for him to not feel so alone . He heard footsteps getting closer until the door opened.</p><p>Suddenly in front of him stood the dark haired man beautiful green eyes . Takano forced a smile onto his face , "Hello I live just next door to you and I thought I would just introduce myself to you. My name is Masamune Takano"</p><p>The other man blinked in surprise for a quick moment staring intently at Takano , "Um ...My name is Harry Potter , it is very nice to meet you Takano -san" the green eyed man said .</p><p>Harry had a very thoughtful expression his face on his for a brief moment before he invited Takano inside .</p><p>Thanking Harry he entered , Harry closing the door behind them . Takano looked around himself , the house was a bit of a mess with boxes still full and it appeared that Harry still needed to buy some furniture .</p><p>"Do you want some help unpacking?" , Takano asked .</p><p>Harry shook his head, "No , it's alright I'm fine doing it myself" , he smiled at Takano . "Do you want a drink Takano-san?"</p><p>Takano nodded and asked for a coffee , though he didn't really care what he drunk , he had been staring at Harry .</p><p>Harry's eyes were very beautiful , his complexion a bit pale , hair that made Takano want to run his fingers through and lips that were just begging to be kissed . Takano wondered if this man was dating anyone .</p><p>Takano sat down on the couch while Harry made the both of them coffees . Once the drinks were made Harry joined Takano on the couch , sitting next to the other man and put both mugs of coffee on a coffee table that was in front of the couch .</p><p>"Thank you" , he said quietly . Takano then began to start a conversation with Harry , "So did you just move here?"</p><p>Harry nodded, "Yeah , from England ...How's my Japanese?"</p><p>Takano he took a sip of the coffee , "It's actually very good", He put down his drink for a moment . "If you ever need any help with anything just ask me , I just live next door to you"</p><p>Harry stared at Takano, "Thank you." He looked unsure , "But wouldn't I be a bother?"</p><p>Takano shook his head , "No , I would be more than happy to help you."</p><p>Harry smiled . He stared at Takano , the man had short black hair , his brown eyes were gazing at Harry intently , his full attention upon Harry . Takano was tall , even when sitting . Harry couldn't help but blush as he stared at Masamune Takano .</p><p>Takano noticed the blush rising on Harry's cheeks as the other short black haired male stared at him and Takano allowed a smile to grace his face .</p><p>'He's so cute when he blushes..."</p><p>Weeks later Harry was all settled in at his apartment room and despite his tiring job as an editor Takano had made good on his offer to help Harry out whenever his neighbour required assistance with anything , though it wasn't often that Harry asked for help . Takano quickly discovered that Harry found it difficult to do so . The first time Harry had knocked on his door for some help he had looked so cute , blushing lightly with embarrassment .</p><p>Takano found that he really enjoyed being around Harry and he had developed feelings for his neighbour . Takano decided to himself that he would make the other man his ... He didn't want to be alone anymore and he would make the other male fall head over heels in love with him .</p>
