    <p>The flames danced in the grate.  Marcus relaxed back in his chair and sipped his wine, a pleasant full-bodied red, which bore no obvious relation to the syrupy toxic brews of his youth despite their common ancestor in the vine.  He reached down and ran his large hand through the dark hair of the younger man who leant comfortably against his knee.</p><p>“So, do you want to know about me or the Clan?”</p><p>“Both, if it please you, but now? You. How did you come to a remote Highland glen? I know you are no Scot, but I cannot place your accent.”</p><p>“Very well.  Biography it is.” He glanced down at his companion who settled more deeply against him, his left hand resting gently on Marcus’ right ankle while the right hand cradled his own glass of wine. “Aren’t you going to take notes?”</p><p>“I have no need of notes.” There is mild irritation and a hint of sarcasm in the tone. “I have a lot of practice at remembering a narrative.” He pauses. “I can just imagine the Dark Lord’s face, if I stopped him mid-rant and asked if I could ‘take notes’.” The twist of his lips could have been called a smile but the tension in his neck and shoulders was a clear demonstration of regret at the turn the conversation was taking.  Not to mention the thought of the pain of what the Dark Lord would have done in response to the interruption.</p><p>Marcus’ hand resumed its gentle ministrations, leeching away the anxiety once more while he wrestled down the instinct to rebuke the comparison to the blot on the universe that was Voldemort.</p><p>“Besides, I can always review the memory if I need to.” A grudging concession.</p><p>“You’re just too comfortable to move.” The tone is gentle and teasing.</p><p>“There is that.”</p><p>“How well do you know your history?”</p><p>“Magical or muggle? Hogwarts’ curriculum is worse than useless, but I have read a little over the years.”</p><p>“The history of Western civilization from the Roman Emperors to Punk – I have lived it all in both worlds.”</p><p>In the comfortable silence, the fire crackled, hissed then settled once more while the grandfather clock in the corner followed tick with tock in a stately hypnotic cadence.</p><p>Marcus took another sip of his wine.  Trying to work out where to start.  There were members of the Raven clan that had been at his side for centuries, but for his early history he had no point of reference except himself. Britannicus has been the only other surviving Roman he was aware of and he hadn’t been seen since before Victoria came to the throne.</p><p>“The Rome of the Emperors was a hard place to live and an easy place to die….”</p>
