</p><p>A green robed Quidditch player zoomed past where seven year old Lily Weasley was stood in the stands and she jumped up and down with her hands in the air when she caught sight of ‘Weasley’ written across the back of it. With the Quaffle tucked tightly under her arm, Lydia Weasley bent closer to her broomstick, dodged a Bludger and then threw the Quaffle with alarming speed. It easily sailed through the middle goalpost and the stadium erupted with cheers.</p><p>“That's 50 - 30 to the Holyhead Harpies after a quite magnificent goal from Lydia Weasley!” Announced Ludo Bagman’s voice, “It's a shame this is her last season,”</p><p>Admittedly, Lily did not quite understand the rules of Quidditch but she enjoyed it anyway. She enjoyed watching her mum in her element, her brothers grinning so broadly and the absence of sadness from her father's eyes. George was always funny and never mean, but sometimes Lily thought that he looked a little bit too sad. Whenever she asked him why he looked so sad, he would kiss her cheek and tell her that he just missed his brother, but that was nothing that she should should be worrying about.</p><p>She also liked spending so much time with the rest of her family. There were many names to remember and she still got all the ones with red hair mixed up, but Grandma Weasley sometimes called Uncle Percy the wrong name and always called Uncle Ron George. It was always funny to see Aunt Hermione so laid back as well. Aunt Hermione was a very successful person (or so she was told, she found being a grown up very boring) and was always serious. That was until she went to a Quidditch match, anyway. Lily looked over to her and laughed for she was whooping louder than anyone else and waving her Holyhead Harpies flag so fast that it was just a blur. Uncle Ron and Uncle Harry were too busy laughing at her to take any notice of what was happening on the pitch and missed the Golden Snitch capture that won the Harpies their game.</p><p>“Come on,” George said, over the sounds of the cheering, “Let's go and wait for her,”</p><p>They waited outside the changing rooms for what felt like hours. Uncle Draco had his coat pulled tightly around him against the December chill and was muttering angrily about how cold he was.</p><p>“You're just bitter because the Harpies are going to win the league again!” Teddy said, his hair suitably the colour of the Harpies robes.</p><p>“I'm bitter because your mother takes a whole Quidditch season to come out of the changing rooms,” Draco muttered, “thank Merlin Ginny wasn't playing today or we’d never get home,”</p><p>Lily poked him in the side and giggled, “Moody!”</p><p>“I am,” he agreed, “it's why everyone loves me,”</p><p>“Define ‘everyone’?” Uncle Ron said.</p><p>Uncle Draco's reply was cut short by the changing room door opened and Lydia walking out. Lily launched herself at her mother, all whilst screaming about how she was the best player in the whole wide world.</p><p>“I'm actually quite sure there's a Chinese player who’s like statistically proven to be the best player in the whole wide world,” Lydia said, kissing her head.</p><p>“Are you incapable of taking a compliment?” George asked, “you played a good game,”</p><p>“Could have scored that first one,”</p><p>“We could also discuss this in the warmth of a pub,” Draco said loudly, “or at least somewhere that isn't so cold that I can feel my eyes freezing,”</p><p>Lydia stared at Draco and then looked down at Lily and whispered, “your Uncle Draco has always been the moodiest man in the world. He used to dramatically sigh every time something went slightly wrong in school,”</p><p>---</p><p>Lily sat and stared at the pumpkin that she had carved with Teddy earlier that morning. It wasn't very good, but neither of them had actually had a lot of practice. Halloween wasn't really something that they celebrated at home. Though, it was something she would be able to celebrate in a year. She looked over at the fridge and at the picture that was pinned to it: it was one of her mum, Uncle Harry, Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione at Hogwarts. They looked funny in their uniforms and Lily was sure that she could see her dad in the background with Uncle Fred.</p><p>“Good pumpkin,” George said, walking into the kitchen, “Where do you want to put it?”</p><p>“I don't know,” she shrugged, “wherever you usually put pumpkins. Where do you usually put pumpkins?”</p><p>“Well,” he said, “the ones at Hogwarts float above the tables in the Great Hall so-” he flicked his wand at the Pumpkin flew upwards, floating above the kitchen table, “it's a lot more fancy at Hogwarts but you get the gist,”</p><p>Lily sat with her head resting on her chin and stared up at it. Fred was probably at the Halloween Feast now and was more than likely enjoying himself a lot more than she was. Halloween was her least favourite day in the whole entire world because they never did anything, and Lily was determined to find out why.</p><p>“I'm going to pick some food up, I'll be back in ten minutes,” George said to her, kissing the top of her head and leaving the room, keys in hand.</p><p>She slid off the chair and walked into the living room where Lydia was. She was sat on the couch and flicking through a magazine, not looking very enthralled by the whole thing. She never looked very enthralled by anything on this day.</p><p>“Are you sure you don't want to go to Aunt Hermione's and Uncle Ron's?” Lydia asked her, “it's going to be a lot more exciting than being here,”</p><p>Lily nodded, “No, I'm okay here,”</p><p>“I'm going to be going out later with your Uncle Harry,” Lydia said, “but I'll be back before you go to-”</p><p>“Can I come?</p><p>Lydia smiled at her, “You'd find it very boring,”</p><p>“You go out every Halloween with Uncle Harry and I never come,” Lily persisted, “Can I not come this year?”</p><p>“Maybe when you're older,” she said, absentmindedly.</p><p>“Why do you hate Halloween so much?”</p><p>“I don't,” Lydia answered, “it's just...” She sighed, “it's the anniversary of my parents deaths today, sweetheart. It's not the happiest of days,”</p><p>Lily frowned and looked down at her hands for a moment, mulling all of this over.</p><p>“How did they die?”</p><p>Lydia put her magazine down and turned to her, “They died protecting me and Harry against an evil wizard. It was a very long time ago. We were only a year old,”</p><p>“The man...the man who did it...” Lily said, her eyes wide with fear.</p><p>“Is dead, Lily,” Lydia promised, “He can't hurt anyone ever again. You don't need to worry about a thing,”</p><p>“How? How did he die?”</p><p>“Your Uncle Harry and I had to fight a war. It's a very long story and one for another time,”</p><p>Lily nodded and curled up against her mother, staring out of the window, “We’re safe, aren't we?”</p><p>Lydia put her arm around her, “Very, very safe. Nothing is ever going to hurt you, Lily. Your dad and I would never let that happen,”</p><p>“Can I come with you and Uncle Harry tonight?”</p><p>There was silence for a few moments and then Lydia shrugged, “I don't see why not,”</p><p>Godric's Hollow was full of Trick or Treaters, all in funny costumes. Lily couldn't help but giggle when two teenagers dressed as a witch and wizard walked past them because that wasn't what true witches and wizards looked like. Uncle Harry pointed out that they were Muggles and, at one point, he and Lydia had probably thought that witches and wizards looked like that. Lily thought that she might like a dress covered in cobwebs just to see the look on Grandma Molly's face when she saw her wearing it.</p><p>They fell into silence as they walked into the cemetery and Lily automatically moved closer to her mother. It was dark and there seemed to be an underlying tension that made Lily very uncomfortable. Uncle Harry paused for a moment at a grave that bore a peculiar rune that looked like an eye. He stared at it, shook his head and then moved on. Lydia squeezed his hand slightly and followed him until they reached the a marble headstone that seemed to glow through the darkness.</p><p>Tentatively, Lily moved closer to it so that she could read.</p><p>

</p><p>She could not remove her eyes from the name ‘Lily Potter,’. She was just beginning to understand that her mum and dad had not chose her name because it was pretty, but because there was a whole person behind it. Lily clung onto her mother's hand tighter and looked away as Harry put flowers down.</p><p>“Why does grandad have four dates?” Lily asked.</p><p>“He came back,” Uncle Harry replied, speaking very softly, “it's a very long and confusing story, love. We’ll tell you another time,”</p><p>Lily wondered if Fred knew more than she did because he was older and was determined to find out.</p><p>When Christmas rolled around and Fred came home, Lily wasted no time in hounding her brother. She burst into his bedroom and dived on top of him, punching him until he woke up. The annoying thing about thirteen year old boys was that all they did was sleep! He was as bad as Teddy who she could still hear snoring even though his bedroom was the furthest away from Fred's.</p><p>“What?” He murmured, “I'm trying to sleep, Lily,”</p><p>“Do you know why grandad came back?”</p><p>“Grandad Arthur? Came back from where?”</p><p>“No, stupid, Grandad James!”</p><p>He actually opened his eyes at this at this and then shrugged, “I don't know. Mum and dad just say it's a story for another time,” when he rolled over and started snoring again, Lily groaned and sat at the edge of his bed, thinking.</p><p>Teddy had already told her that he didn't know anymore than her about what happened to their grandparents and Fred seemed annoyingly uninterested. As she left his bedroom, she tripped over his trunk and saw his school robes and books all hanging out of it. When she got to Hogwarts, she thought, she would be able to find everything out. After all, Aunt Hermione still spoke about the library and how amazing it all was.</p><p>---</p><p>Something that none of Lily's family members had told her was that the Great Hall was really quite cold. Her eyes flickered from the Gryffindor table where Ruby were sat and over to the Ravenclaw table where Fred was sat with Rose. Fred grinned at her and she turned back to face the front. Next to her, Hugo was jumping from one foot to the other out of nerves. Lily wasn't sure what was scarier: being the son of the Minister for Magic or being the daughter of the Girl who Lived. Perhaps they were equally terrible.</p><p>Someone tugged at her robes and turned around to a Gryffindor student who was smirking at her.</p><p>“You're the other Potter-Weasley kid, aren't you?” He whispered, “you well look like your mum!”</p><p>“Leave her alone, Boone!” Ruby hissed down the table.</p><p>“I'm just saying she looks like her mum!” He shot back at Ruby.</p><p>“And you look like a baboons arse but you don't hear us going on about it,” Ruby snapped.</p><p>Lily bit back a laugh and turned to face the front again. She could see Uncle Harry staring at them with his brows furrowed, as though he knew something was going on. Ruby just waved at him and grinned. He stared at his daughter with narrowed eyes for a few moments and then looked away. Ruby winked at Lily and then put a finger to her lips as Hugo's name was called.</p><p>The Sorting Hat was silent for a few moments before shouting, “RAVENCLAW!” And, looking quite relieved, Hugo ran to join his sister who was clapping the loudest of all the other Ravenclaws. Lily wasn't sure how much longer she could take this. Being sorted into Gryffindor would be the best bet for her. She couldn't deal with the drama of being sorted into Slytherin and, as much as she loved her oldest brother, Hufflepuff was definitely too...yellow.</p><p>“Weasley, Lily,”</p><p>There was an outbreak of muttering as Lily pushed through the crowd and walked up to the three-legged stool. She smiled gingerly at Harry who was holding the mirror up and, although she couldn't see, Lily was quite sure that her parents were probably on the other side watching. Well, her parents and the rest of the family that is.</p><p>Professor Flitwick gently dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head and the hall disappeared from sight. At first, the Hat said nothing and Lily's heart dropped to her stomach - was there no house suitable for her? Were they about to send her packing? She could think of anything more embarrassing than being rejected by the Hat in front of the whole school.</p><p>“I've been in a mind like yours before...” The Hat said suddenly, making Lily jump, “Yes..quite interesting what she went on to become but...no? You're not like your mother? Well, we’ll see about that....SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>Professor Flitwick whipped the Hat off her head and nudged her in the direction of the Slytherin table who were all cheering. Lily glanced behind her at Uncle Harry who was laughing hysterically with Neville. It was almost as though everyone but Lily knew that she was going to be sorted into Slytherin. As though it was all one big inside joke.</p><p>“Welcome to Slytherin!” The prefect said when Lily sat down, “don't look so worried. We’re the best house, no matter what those ridiculous Gryffindors say,”</p><p>Even Lily couldn't help but grin.</p><p>As the year rushed passed them, Lily realised that she wasn't really good at anything but Potions and Hugo asked too many questions. When Professor Flitwick explained levitation charm and told them why it was used, his hand went straight into the air just to ask why.</p><p>“But why do we have to use <em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>? Does the Locomotion Charm not do that? That's the spell my dad uses to move products in the shop.I don't think he's ever used <em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>!”</p><p>When Uncle Harry began teaching them the best way to carry out the Full Body-Bind Curse, Hugo's hand was in the air before Harry had even finished writing the words on the board.</p><p>“Yes, Hugo?” He asked.</p><p>“The Body Bind curse, it freezes people, right?”</p><p>“That's the general idea, yes,” Harry said.</p><p>“Then why don't people just use that all the time? It's the best way to win a duel, isn't it?”</p><p>Harry started at him for a moment, “Well...I, ugh, duelling is very complicated Hugo. It's not always as simple as that but, yes, I suppose it is rather effective to use in duelling...”</p><p>“So, I should just use that if I'm ever duelling someone?”</p><p>“No, you should have more than one spell in your-”</p><p>“Dad always says that the only spell you used is <em>Expelliarmus</em>,”</p><p>“And it always got me out of tricky spots that you'll never be in, mate,” Harry said, “but, back to the lesson....”</p><p>Lily enjoyed Hogwarts, she really did, but she just wished that people would stop confusing her with her mother. Sometimes Professor Flitwick would call her Lydia instead of Lily and random people would stop her in the corridors just to tell her how much she looked like her mother, as if this was something she wasn't aware of! And, even more annoying, they would stop her to tell her that Lydia was their favourite ever Quidditch player and then try and engage her in a conversation about Quidditch.</p><p>“I don't know that much about Quidditch,” she would say.</p><p>“Your mum was the captain of the Holyhead Harpies,”</p><p>“I know! I just don't know that much about it! Hugo's mum is the Minister for Magic but you don't expect him to know everything that she does, do you?”</p><p>Whenever she got into a near argument with someone who would probably be able to easily curse her, one of her cousins or Fred would always swoop in at the last minute and calm the situation down. This on infuriated Lily further - she didn't need protecting! She was doing perfectly fine on her own!</p><p>She was so fed up of being constantly compared to her mother, in fact, that she lost interest in trying to find out more about her past. She just wanted to focus on herself. And she felt like the more she found out about her mother, the more she would realise that she would never quite live up to her standard. She pretended not to notice how her teachers always looked slightly disappointed when they handed her essays back, because they were never as good as Lydia's. She acted as though she didn't notice how Uncle Harry would quietly sigh to himself when she couldn't cast a spell quite as powerfully as Lydia wild have been able to, or how Professor McGonagall looked ever so slightly confused when she realised that where Lydia always had something sarcastic to say to someone being unnecessarily rude, Lily could do nothing but stammer out a “S-Shut up!”.</p><p>This was why Lily liked Potions. In Potions, she was never compared to Lydia because Lydia was bad at Potions. Professor Slughorn chortling away at how she was like Lily Evans stung ever so slightly, but no one knew enough about Lily Evans to really know what this comparison meant. Indeed, when Lily was in the Potions dungeons, she was able to get lost in the fumes rising from her potions and was able to be herself. In there, she wasn't ‘the other Potter-Weasley kid,’ or the only daughter of Lydia Potter, she was just Lily. Just Lily who was ridiculously good at potions and had made it to the top of the class after the first lesson.</p><p>Of course, she never said any of her worries out loud. She didn't want to upset her mum or worry her dad. Fred, Rose and Ruby were busy panicking about their OWLs, Teddy was busy fighting for Werewolf rights at the Ministry along with Lydia and Aunt Hermione and Hugo would ask too many questions. She could probably speak to Professor Slughorn, but he would most definitely tell Uncle Harry and Lily didn't really want to speak to her Uncle. She loved him very much but he would probably go straight to her parents.</p><p>The only person she did tell was her best friend, Hannah. One night in the Slytherin common room, the older students were being loud and it was the perfect time for a quiet conversation that no one would listen on.</p><p>“Maybe you should dye your hair so that you don't look so much like your mum,” was the only bit of advice Hannah could offer, but even she retracted that very quickly. “Actually, don't do that, that's a bit stupid. People will get bored of talking about her eventually,”</p><p>And so, rather stupidly, Lily bottled everything up.</p><p> </p>
