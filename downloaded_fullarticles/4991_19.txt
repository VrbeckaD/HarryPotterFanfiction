    <p>Preface</p><p>It was moments like this that made Harry have trouble believing just how spoiled Dudley was. In the moments when Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had trouble believing the extent of their son's greed, Harry always hopes that they'll finally tell him to suck it up and wait but once again, Dudley gets his way and as usual, it was up to Harry to make sure Dudley got his candy. Oh, how Harry longed to be back at Hogwarts where he was treated like a person and not some kind of slave.</p><p>It was the day after Christmas and eleven-year-old Harry Potter was trudging up the street with the chocolates Dudley absolutely had to have right at that moment. Aunt Petunia never denied Dudley anything out of fear of the wild tantrums the boy would pull and today.</p><p>They almost said no but they could see his cheeks puffing up with anger and they saw his eyes twitch towards the Christmas tree. Harry knew they'd do anything to prevent Dudley from picking up the tree and throwing it around. Of course, Harry knew that Dudley wouldn't have the strength or energy to actually pick up the tree but he could know it over and smash Aunt Petunia's priceless ornaments.</p><p>Harry had wondered briefly why they wanted him home for Christmas but their motives became clear because Harry was treated like a live-in butler. The minute he'd arrived home, he'd been presented a list of chores and duties and when he was expected to have them done.</p><p>The icing on the cake was when the Dursleys started carrying around bells that they rang whenever they wanted Harry's attention.</p><p>Tonight, when Duddley had thrown a fit about his chocolates, Mr Dursley finally caved and sent Harry to pick up a few boxes of the sweets; just enough to keep Dudley content for the night. Any rational adult would have driven to pick up the chocolates instead of sending an eleven-year-old out to retrieve them at two o'clock in the morning, but the Dursleys were, by no definition of the word, rational. Not even Harry was used to being awakened in the middle of the night to retrieve sweets.</p><p>Harry was walking past a patch of woods when he heard whimpering coming from a bush. Harry rolled his eyes and began walking towards the bush. No doubt Mrs Scott's stupid dog was caught in the bush again. As he got closer he could tell it was definitely a canine but it wasn't Mrs Scott's... This was without a doubt the ugliest dog Harry had ever seen in his life and it was indeed stuck.</p><p>Harry reached in and freed the unusually bony and muscular dog which repaid the favour by jumping up sinking its massive teeth into Harry's arm. Harry let out a cry of pain so shrill that the dog jumped and released Harry's arm. For a minute before Harry blacked out completely, he could have sworn he saw the dog walk on two feet like a human...</p><p>***** ***** *****</p><p>It had been a week since that dog bit Harry and his shoulder was still itchy. Upon arriving home (with Dudley's sweets) Harry was rushed off to an evening nurse for a rabies shot... "We aren't going to risk Dudley catching rabies because the freak got bit by a wild dog," Petunia had said before yelling at Harry not to get blood on the car seats.</p><p>Since then Harry has been experiencing some mild side effects from the shot. Harry often found himself light-headed, irritable, moody and tired. Harry actually slept the whole train ride back to Hogwarts; which was fine with Hermione because this gave her the opportunity to do some "light" reading for Lupin's class. She tried to get Harry engaged with a book but he muttered something about needing five more minutes and proceeded to fall deeper into sleep and remained that way until they arrived at Hogwarts.</p><p>Remus Lupin was ready for the second term to begin. He took a deep breath and took in the smells of the wonderful food; his enhanced senses made experiences like meals times more interesting. But he was most excited to see Harry coming back to class. His late best friends son had turned out to be the perfect combination of Lily and James; Lily's brains and James personality.</p><p>He watched as Harry filed into the feast tagging after Hermione and he felt a wave of concern wash over him. Harry was a bit flushed and looked just about ready to curl up on the floor for a nap rather than to tuck in for a feast. Harry had most likely caught some type of infection from the muggles. He wondered briefly if they were going to have an outbreak on their hands but diminished the thought. He could see Poppy watching Harry with her usual sharp eyes and knew she'd be right over there if she believed it was serious.</p><p>The next two weeks flew by and before Harry knew it he was settled back into his routine and back to spending time with Ron, Hermione, Hagrid and Lupin. Harry loved spending time with Lupin because of how much Lupin knew about his dad and in these past couple weeks they seemed to be bonding really well.</p><p>Unfortunately, it took Harry about a week to recover upon arriving at Hogwarts. But despite the fact that Harry's dizzy spells had since passed, along with the constant feverish sensation, he still felt tense and irritable and it has since started to get worse. He found himself confused and a little nervous by his irritability and mood lately. He wished he knew what was wrong but he didn't. Maybe he was finally going mad from spending one too many days with the Dursleys.</p><p>Even Lupin noticed the small boy becoming defensive and easily set off by little things and had since tried talking to Harry about whatever was bothering him but had come up with nothing that could explain his unusual mood.</p><p>With the full moon approaching in six days, Lupin had to bite back frustration as Harry would argue with Malfoy over things that even Ron found insignificant and not worth getting upset about. The only conclusion Lupin could Logically come up with was on-set puberty but there was a part of him that felt that wasn't right and he needed to find out what was wrong with his best friends boy.</p>
