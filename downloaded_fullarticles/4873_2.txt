    <p>Harry
frowned. He was certain he had left it hanging over the end of
his bed. He knelt down and looked under the bed just in case but
there was nothing, not even dust bunnies thanks to the diligent house
elves.</p><p>“<span><span>Neville,
have you seen my hoodie? The red one I was wearing yesterday?”
Harry asked.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>He’s
down in the common room,” Neville said, not bothering to look
up from his little windowsill garden.</span></span></p><p>
Harry’s
brow furrowed in confusion, “What?”</p><p>“<span><span>Malfoy’s
down in the common room,” Neville said absently. He glanced up
at Harry’s prolonged silence and shrugged, “Who else
would take it?”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Thanks,”
Harry said hurriedly, heading out of the room and down the hallway to
the common room.</span></span></p><p>
Sure
enough, there was a red-clad figure laying on one of the couches by
the fire. He was slumped down so his neck was at an awkward angle
he’d come to regret later, hood pulled up and hiding most of
his ridiculous blond hair, sleeves pulled down over his fingers. He
had a book balanced on his chest about three inches from his face.
Harry rather suspected that Draco was in dire need of a pair of
reading glasses but would rather die than admit it.</p><p>
Harry
walked over, stopping in front of the couch to demand, “Give it
back.”</p><p>“<span><span>No,”
Draco said flatly turning a page and squinting at the tiny type.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
sighed and scrubbed his hand through his hair, “Come on, all
the rest are being washed.”</p><p>“<span><span>I
know,” Draco said smugly.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>You’re
the worst, why are you like this?” Harry groaned.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
twitched an eyebrow up, “Have you met my father?”</p><p>
Harry
frowned and grabbed the bottom of the hoodie Draco was wearing.</p><p>“<span><span>What
are you doing!” Draco sputtered, his book falling on his chest
as he grabbed Harry’s wrists, pushing back down.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Taking.
my. hoodie. back,” Harry said through gritted teeth.</span></span></p><p>
He
pushed up harder and Draco pulled down. The book slid to the floor
with a thump. Harry climbed onto the couch, a knee between Draco’s
legs. The hoodie along with Draco’s shirt rode up his chest as
they struggled. Draco raised his free foot and braced it on Harry’s
shoulder to shove him back and Harry furiously leant against it.
Until Draco’s foot slipped and Harry tumbled onto Draco in a
heap that left them both breathless.</p><p>“<span><span>Fuck,”
Draco groaned, “Are you made of lead, Potter?”</span></span></p><p>
Harry
tried not to laugh, he really did, but Draco’s pouty frown
pushed him over the edge and he started laughing so hard he had to
hold onto the couch to keep from falling off.</p><p>
Draco
rather unsuccessfully fought down a smile, “Arsehole.”</p><p>
Sitting
at a small table nearby Ron groaned, “<i>Merlin</i>, they’re
doing it again.”</p><p>
Hermione
smiled fondly, her chin propped on her hand, “I think it’s
cute.”</p><p>“<span><span>This
is torture. I’m going to the library,” Ron said, shoving
his parchment in his bag, “They don’t even realise, how
do they </span></span><i><span>not
realise</span></i><span><span>?”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I’ll
come with you,” Hermione smiled, twirling her wand and sending
all her books and parchments neatly into her bag, “They’ll
figure it out eventually.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>And
then they’ll be </span></span><i><span>worse</span></i><span><span>!”
Ron grabbed his bag, “You know they will be!”</span></span></p><p>
Hermione
smiled and took Ron’s arm, “You’ll be fine, I
promise.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<span><span>Potter. </span></span><i><span>Potter. </span></i><span><span>Potter!”</span></span></p><p>
Harry
looked up from his plate across the table at Draco with a frown,
“<i>What</i>? I’m right here, you don’t have
to shout, you twat.”</p><p>“<span><span>Then
answer the first time,” Draco sniffed.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
rolled his eyes, “What do you want?”</p><p>“<span><span>Do
you want my potatoes?” He pushed his plate halfway across the
table.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
frowned at them, “What’s wrong with them?”</p><p>“<span><span>There’s
nothing </span></span><i><span>wrong</span></i><span><span> with
them. </span></span><i><span>You</span></i><span><span> ate
some of them, you daft wanker.”</span></span></p><p>
Harry
made a face at him, “What’s wrong with <i>yours</i> then?”</p><p>“<span><span>Merlin
save me,” Draco muttered, briefly pressing his fingers to his
forehead. “I just don’t want them.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Don’t
you like the roasted potatoes?” Harry asked.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>No.”
Draco said flatly, “Now do you want them or not.”</span></span></p><p>
Ron
leant over and pointed at Draco with his fork, “Liar. I’ve
seen you eating them.”</p><p>“<span><span>On
occasion,” Draco said stiffly.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>They’re
one of your favourites,” Ron went on mercilessly.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
glared at him, “Well today they’re not.”</p><p>“<span><span>They’re
Harry’s favourites too,” Ron said.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>So?”
Draco said.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>They’re
the first dish to run out,” Ron said with mounting frustration,
“You could just be </span></span><i><span>honest</span></i><span><span> and
say you got them for him.”</span></span></p><p>
Draco
gave him a cold look and then turned away like Ron had ceased to
exist. He picked up his plate and dumped the potatoes onto Harry’s
plate and then stood up. “It’s not my fault you’re
too scrawny,” he said and marched off.</p><p>“<span><span>Hey!
I am not!” Harry yelled after, standing as well. He went to
follow and hesitated, glancing at his plate and quickly shovelling
down the potatoes before running after him.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
slowly dropped his forehead onto the table with a thump, “They’re
going to be the death of me… If I don’t strangle them
with my bare hands first.”</p><p>
Hermione
patted his back sympathetically, “Well, you tried.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<span><span>I
thought the eighth year game was finished?” Hermione asked as
she came down to the front of the stands and sat next to Ron on a
bench.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
nodded, slightly leant forward as he watched the two figures hanging
motionless above them, “Yeah… we played without seekers,
first to three hundred. Afterwards, those two stayed to play a seeker
game.”</p><p>
Hermione
craned her neck up, “Malfoy and Harry?”</p><p>“<span><span>Harry’s
caught it twice. Malfoy was pissed and tried to leave but Harry
talked him into one more game.” Ron never took his eyes away
from them as they slowly circled above.</span></span></p><p>
Then
Draco dived, his eyes locked on a shining golden movement below.
Harry followed instinctively, with a curling sweeping turn that
brought him closer, pushing his own dive deeper for more speed,
closing the distance between them. Draco glanced back and then
flattened himself to his broom with a scowl of determination. Harry
was nearly at his side as they raced along the pitch, both of them
fixated on the little golden ball. The snitch veered right, away from
Harry, and Draco turned with it, his whole body stretching out into
the turn, lunging out and- he stopped, slowly pulling his hand
towards him, only the snitch’s little golden fluttering wings
visible from his fist.</p><p>“<span><span>He
did it!” Hermione cried.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
cupped his hands around his mouth, “Good on ya, Malfoy!!”</p><p>
Draco
looked over at them briefly, eyes wide with shock, and then back down
at the snitch in his hand.</p><p>
Harry
flew over, nearly knocking them both off their brooms as he threw his
arms around Draco in a boisterous hug, “Merlin! That was
amazing!”</p><p>
Ron
blindly reached out for Hermione’s hand, grasping it tightly.</p><p>
Hermione’s
eyes widened, “Do you see-?”</p><p>
Ron
nodded, his voice croaked out, “He’s blushing. Malfoy’s
blushing. I think he’s finally realised”</p><p>
Hermione
squeezed Ron’s hand and they glanced at each other for just a
second before their eyes were torn back to the scene in front of
them.</p><p>
Draco’s
cheeks were flushed pink. His expression warred between confusion and
embarrassment and that was being overtaken by a realisation that made
his whole face turn red. He ducked out of Harry’s grip
with a desperate half-heartedly complaint of, “Get off me,
Potter,” and quickly descended onto the pitch, practically
throwing himself off his broom and nearly running back towards the
castle.</p><p>
Ron
and Hermione leant over the railing. Harry landed as well, looking
utterly confused. He called after Draco as he ran to try and catch up
but Draco ignored him.</p><p>“<span><span>Thank
Merlin, one of them has finally figured it out,” Ron said with
a sigh of relief.</span></span></p><p>
Hermione
smiled briefly, “Yeah but… it’s <i>Malfoy</i>.”</p><p>
Ron
grimaced, “and he’s a coward.”</p><p>“<span><span>And
Harry’s awful when it comes to romantic stuff. He may never
realise it, not if Malfoy’s trying to hide it,” Hermione
added.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
stood, keeping hold of Hermione’s hand as they made their way
out of the stand, “At least there’s hope now.”</p><p>“<span><span>Maybe
we can help things along?” Hermione suggested.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
glanced over and grinned, “I mean, we pretty much have to with
those two.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Draco
frowned at his wand. The defensive shield they were practising was
one of the most difficult and most powerful. Draco managed to cast it
about one out of five times and he had no idea what he was doing
wrong. He couldn’t possibly be more annoyed.</p><p>“<span><span>Oi,
Malfoy, you having trouble with this shielding spell?” Weasley
asked.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
was wrong, he could be more annoyed. “I’m <i>fine</i>,
Weasley,” he said, straightening his back and pretending he was
perfectly confident. He didn’t want help, especially from a
giant carrot of a human being.</p><p>
Weasley
cupped his hands around his mouth and <i>shouted</i> across
the room, “Harry! Over here!”</p><p>
Draco
felt his cheeks start to flush and glared furiously at Weasley,
hissing under his breath, “What are you doing?!”</p><p>
Weasley
gave him a jolly grin that was absolutely the most infuriating thing
he had ever seen.</p><p>“<span><span>What
is it?” Potter asked as he edged around Seamus and Dean.</span></span></p><p>
Weasley
threw an easy arm over Potter’s shoulders and steered him over
to Draco, “Our good friend, Ferret-face here, could use a
little help, can’t quite get the hang of this spell.” He
smiled like a jackal, smacked Potter on the shoulder hard enough to
make him stumble and then hurried back to Granger.</p><p>
Draco
very much wanted to strangle Weasley with his own tie.</p><p>“<span><span>You’re
having trouble?” Potter asked.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
frowned, “No, of course not.” He nervously adjusted his
grip and carefully cast the shielding spell. Nothing happened.</p><p>
Out
of the corner of his eye, he saw Potter tilt his head slightly to the
side.</p><p>
Draco
gritted his teeth and quickly tried again. The shield poured from his
wand in a haze of blue light at circled him in a sphere. He smirked
triumphantly, “There, see? I can cast it perfectly fine.”</p><p>
Potter
was still looking at him in that curious puppy sort of way that made
Draco want to blush.</p><p>“<span><span>Can
you do it again?” Potter asked.</span></span></p><p>
He
did not know if he could do it again. He really, really wanted to. He
was fairly certain he’d die of embarrassment if he couldn’t.
Draco practically held his breath as he tried the spell again. His
wand made a rather horrifying fizzling sound and spat out a few blue
sparks. Draco felt his face go hot.</p><p>“<span><span>I
see,” Potter said in a rather amicable teachery sort of way
that indicated he hadn’t realised in the slightest how utterly
mortified Draco was at that moment.</span></span></p><p>
Then
before Draco could say something, blame it on a headache or a
stumbled syllable, Potter moved behind him, wrapped his hand around
Draco’s wand hand.</p><p>
He
gently held onto the back of Draco’s hand, moving his wand in
the small sharp movements the spell required, “I noticed that
this spell works best if its cast as quickly as possible, so all the
movements have to be very compact but still precise. Like this-”</p><p>
Draco
could feel Potter’s chest pressed to the back of his shoulder,
their arms pressed perfectly together all the way down to his perfect
gentle hold on Draco’s hand. He couldn’t focus on a
single word coming out of Potter’s mouth, he couldn’t see
his wand move, just the seam where their two hands met. Draco’s
face felt so hot he couldn’t stand it.</p><p>
He
pulled away from Potter and practically ran out the door, mumbling
something about being sick.</p><p>
Hermione
bit her lip, watching the furrow on Harry’s brow as he turned
on his heel to watch Draco leave. “It was a good try,”
she murmured out of the corner of her mouth, touching Ron’s
forearm briefly, “I think we need a different tactic.”</p><p>
Ron
frowned, “What do you think then?”</p><p>“<span><span>I
have an idea, just let me talk to Harry, okay?” she said.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
nodded, “Alright.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<span><span>Have
either of you talked to Harry lately?” Neville paused to ask on
his way out of the common room, his arms full of a faintly quivering
fern.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
and Hermione looked up from the homework at Neville and then
exchanged a <i>look</i>.</p><p>“<span><span>What’s
up?” Ron asked, “Seemed alright the last time I saw him.”</span></span></p><p>
Neville
nodded back towards the dorms, “He’s up there, pacing. I
had to leave because he was agitating Matilda.” he looked down
at his fern with a furrowed brow.</p><p>
Ron
looked over at Hermione, “It’s time?”</p><p>
Hermione
nodded. “I’ll talk to him,” she said, carefully
marking her place in her book and putting it away.</p><p>
Neville
watched all this, his head cocked slightly to the side, “Need
any help?” he offered hesitantly.</p><p>“<span><span>I’ve
got it,” Hermione said confidently.</span></span></p><p>
Neville
shrugged, “Well, I’m gonna head to the greenhouses so
Matilda can socialise. It should calm her down.” He gave them a
wave as he left.</p><p>“<span><span>You
sure you don’t need any help?” Ron asked Hermione.</span></span></p><p>
Hermione
shook her head, giving Ron a faint fond smile, “Later. This is
just to push things in the right direction. It won’t take
long.” She pushed her hair back, set her shoulders and marched
up the boy’s dorm.</p><p>
Inside,
Harry was indeed wearing a hole in the rug, walking back and forth,
staring at the floor blankly as he gnawed on a ragged thumbnail.</p><p>“<span><span>Hello,
Harry,” Hermione said, making her way to Ron bed in the middle
of Harry’s pacing circuit and sat on the edge.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
stopped pacing, his head jerking up, “Hermione? Err, Hi?”</p><p>“<span><span>Trouble?”
Hermione asked.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Uh,
well,” Harry sighed, his brow furrowing again, “I- No?”</span></span></p><p>
Hermione
waited patiently.</p><p>“<span><span>Maybe?”
Harry said, a touch helplessly, pushing his hand through his hair, “I
think I’ve done something wrong but I don’t know what.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>What
happened?” she asked.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>It’s
Draco,” His hand, having done its duty to make Harry’s
hair stand nearly straight up, smacked back down to his side, “He’s
been avoiding me. Won’t talk to me. He hasn’t even been
stealing my jumpers. I must have </span></span><i><span>done</span></i><span><span> something,
or </span></span><i><span>missed</span></i><span><span> something…”
he frowned and went back to chewing on his thumbnail.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>He
fancies you,” Hermione said.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
froze, his eyes going wide, “Wha-?”</p><p>
Hermione
barely resisted rolling her eyes, “<i>He fancies you</i>,”
she repeated, taking care to emphasise each word.</p><p>“<span><span>He
can’t- That doesn’t- There’s no way!” Harry
sputtered.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Seems
obvious to me. Ron as well. You’ve never been very good at
noticing when someone likes you. Or-” she said pointedly, “when
you’ve developed a crush yourself.”</span></span></p><p>
Harry
stared at her mutely.</p><p>
Hermione
stood and primly straightened her robes, “So, of course,
Malfoy’s going to avoid you. He’s probably scared. You’ve
only ever fancied girls before so he doesn’t even have hope
that you might like him back.”</p><p>“<span><span>There’s
no way…” Harry repeated numbly, still staring blankly at
where Hermione had been sitting as she made her way back down to the
common room.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
turned his chair as she walked over, “Did it work?”</p><p>
Hermione
sighed, sliding back into her chair, “ “Hard to say. At
the very least he’ll be interpreting the information he gets
through the correct lens.”</p><p>“<span><span>What?”
Ron’s brow furrowed.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I
mean,” Hermione said, “when he sees Malfoy being smitten,
he’ll </span></span><i><span>know </span></i><span><span>instead
of being confused and utterly </span></span><i><span>wrong</span></i><span><span>.
Then he just has to work out his own emotions.”</span></span></p><p>
Ron
groaned.</p><p>“<span><span>I
know, but there’s really no way to hurry it along. ”
Hermione patted him on the shoulder and took her book out again.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>They
just need to spend more time around one another,” Ron said,
forcing himself upright and grabbing a blank piece of parchment and
his quill, “That’s all.”</span></span></p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<span><span>So
I was thinking, for the eighth year quidditch teams, we could
see if any other sixth or fifth year players wanted to join, just to
fill out the roster,” Ron said, gesturing animatedly with his
hands as they made their into the great hall for lunch.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
brow furrowed as they sat, “But we have enough players-”</p><p>“<span><span>Enough
people who can </span></span><i><span>fly</span></i><span><span>.”
Ron said loading up his plate, “Just because Zabini knows how
to use a broomstick doesn’t mean he has any talent, or interest
for that matter, in being a chaser.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I
suppose…” Harry conceded, his brow furrowing further. He
glanced around, trying to figure out what seemed off.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>So-”
Ron paused to shovel some sort of green bean concoction into his
mouth- “wif a few fifh years and sifs years we can-”</span></span></p><p>
Hermione
sighed and leant in front of Harry to say, “Ron please finish
your food, then talk. No one wants to see the process.”</p><p>
Ron
made a vague <i>mph</i> sound as he dutifully closed his
mouth.</p><p>“<span><span>That’s
it-!” Harry pointed to Ron and Hermione on either side of him,
“the two of you aren’t sitting together!”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Like
I want to be stuck listening to Ron go on about quidditch, I mean
really,” Hermione said shortly, already digging a massive book
from her bag and charming it float in front of her so she could read
as she ate.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
shrugged and gestured for Harry to get some food. He still felt a
prickle of unease at the back of his mind but he did his best to
ignore it and began filling his plate.</p><p>“<span><span>Malfoy!”
Hermione called out, waving her hand like she did when she wanted to
be called on by a professor.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
froze, staring blankly at his plate, his ears straining to hear what
they were saying.</p><p>“<span><span>Yes,
Granger?”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Have
you read Killgow’s Art of Potioneering?”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I
have,” Draco said warily.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Excellent,”
Hermione said, and as Harry glanced over, saw her grab Draco’s
arm and pull him into the seat beside her, “I have some
theories-”</span></span></p><p>
She
disappeared into potion theory, talking about compound reactions and
differential magic effects, all of which Harry would have needed
years worth of private tutoring to even know half of what she was
saying. Draco was following her with nods and interjections, moving
to a different page of Hermione’s book with a flick of his wand
to highlight whatever point he was making.</p><p>
It
wasn’t until Draco glanced over at Harry and caught him staring
that Harry realised he <i>was </i>staring and quickly
looked back at his plate. He felt his cheeks grow hot and silently
cursed himself. He ate a few bites of food to give himself something
to do so that he wouldn’t be tempted to glance over again.</p><p>
It
was all Hermione’s fault.</p><p>
Every
since she had said <i>that</i> Harry couldn’t stop
thinking about it.</p><p>
Before
he had been planning to talk with Draco, to try and figure out what
he had done wrong. Now he didn’t know what to do.</p><p>
Ron
leant forward, suddenly entering Harry’s line of vision and
making him jump. He called over to Hermione, “Hey, Mione, I was
wondering if you’d look over my charms paper before I turn it
in.”</p><p>
Hermione
pulled herself away from her discussion with Draco and frowned at
Ron, “You should have asked earlier. How are you going to fix
anything <i>right</i>before class?”</p><p>
Ron
shrugged guiltily, “You could, check my spelling? If I’ve
put something stupid in I could scratch it out.”</p><p>
She
sighed, “Fine.” Hermione stood and with a deft swish of
her wand, Her plate leapfrogged over Harry’s and his slid
underneath, her book dutifully moving back over her plate, now in
front of him. “Trade places with me, Harry?” she said,
already moving in a way that suggested her words were more or less a
formality.</p><p>
Harry
hesitated, shooting a desperate glare at his best friends as he
realised the source of all his unease was this- <i>whatever </i>they
had planned. He reluctantly moved down a seat next to Draco.</p><p>
Draco
who was eating, or moving his food around on his plate in a very
focused manner. He didn’t even look over as Harry took his new
place.</p><p>
Harry
grabbed up a bread roll, very slowly cutting it in half and then
smearing too much butter on it before setting it down on his plate,
feeling too nervous to actually eat it. “Done much flying?”
he asked, just to break the unbearable tension.</p><p>“<span><span>No.”
Draco said stiffly, “Studying, mostly.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Oh.
Right.” Harry said faintly.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>We
have exams coming up, as I’m sure you’re aware,”
Draco said without any inflection whatsoever.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Yeah…”
he absently started to pull his roll apart with his fingers, “Never
too early to get a start on those.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>They </span></span><i><span>are</span></i><span><span> the
most important exams of our lives.”</span></span></p><p>
Harry
nodded, as he glanced over, he noticed that Draco hadn’t eaten
what little he had put on his plate, all of which looked worse than
the bread roll mess on Harry’s plate. At least he had
eaten <i>something </i>when he was trying not to stare.
Harry looked at Draco himself and noticed faint shadows under his
eyes and worried that he was looking thinner than before.</p><p>“<span><span>Would
you like the tea pot?” Harry asked, knowing that even in his
worst moods, Draco always at least had tea.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
looked over and for just a second their eyes met, before Draco turned
away, squeezing his eyes shut like he was in pain. “It’s
fine. No tea. I’m fine.” He stood up and grabbed his bag,
“Not really hungry anyway.”</p><p>
Harry
watched him leave, a tiny squeezing pain lodging itself in his chest.
“Has he been eating much?” he turned and looked at Ron
and Hermione who were watching him intently, no charms paper in
sight, “Do you know? He looks thin.”</p><p>
Ron
shook his head and added a shrug.</p><p>
Hermione
said, “I don’t know but I haven’t exactly been
watching Malfoy’s eating habits.”</p><p>“<span><span>Not
very well,” A light airy voice piped up from Hermione’s
other side. Luna leaned into view, “I think Draco’s
worried about something.”</span></span></p><p>
Harry
grabbed his bag and stood up, “I’m just gonna go to the
kitchens. Maybe I can convince the house elves to send him
something…”  he hurried off, his friends watching
him go.</p><p>“<span><span>He
hardly ate anything himself,” Ron said.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I
think your plan sucked.” Ginny draped her arms around Luna’s
waist and rested her chin on Luna’s shoulder.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
frowned and said testily, “What do you know about anything.”</p><p>“<span><span>Anyone
can see what you two are up to,” Ginny said.</span></span></p><p>
Luna
smiled, “I think it’s sweet. Harry and Draco will be so
happy once they’re together.”</p><p>“<span><span>If
you can manage a plan that isn’t utter rubbish,” Ginny
said, raising an eyebrow.</span></span></p><p>
Ron’s
frown deepened into a glower, “It’s not like it’s
going to work out all at once, is it? It’s like a chess game
and in chess, how you move your pawns is just as important as how you
move your queen!”</p><p>
Ginny
opened her mouth to retort but before she could say anything, Luna
reached over and gently tugged on Ginny’s earlobe which had the
strange effect of making her blush and go entirely silent. Luna
turned back to Ron and Hermione, “What Ginny means is that we
would like to help.”</p><p>“<span><span>We
have an idea,” Ginny added.</span></span></p><p>
Luna
nodded, “It’s quite good.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<span><span>Ready?”
Ginny murmured under her breath.</span></span></p><p>
Luna
nodded with a bright smile.</p><p>
Ginny
glanced over at Draco sitting in a chair nearby in the eighth year
common room, reading a rather massive book held rather close to his
face.  He was one of four people in the common room at the time.
No one gave the two seventh years much notice, they tended to come
around the eighth year dorms quite often.</p><p>
Luna
elbowed her gently with a <i>don’t give it all away </i>look.
Ginny helped her set up the ladder they had found and propped it
against the wall.</p><p>
Floating
up against the ceiling were a dozen brightly coloured christmas
baubles. Both Ginny and Luna looked up at them. Ginny put her hands
on her hips, doing her best to hide her impatience.</p><p>
Luna
put her arm through Ginny’s holding it loosely, “Do you
think we should transfigure a net maybe?”</p><p>
Ginny
shrugged but started looking around for something handy to
transfigure.</p><p>
They
both turned when they heard footsteps approaching from the dorms.</p><p>
Ginny
fought down her grin.</p><p>
Luna
smiled as she always did and waved, “Hullo, Harry.”</p><p>
Harry
waved back a little awkwardly, “Uh, Hermione said you needed
help?”</p><p>
Luna
nodded and pointed up towards the ceiling, “I accidentally
charmed my favourite baubles to float.”</p><p>
They
all craned their necks up to look at the peacefully drifting
ornaments.</p><p>“<span><span>Couldn’t
you just fly up on a broom?” Harry asked.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Surprisingly,
brooms don’t work here.” Ginny sighed and added a little
sarcastically, “Can’t imagine why the Headmistress
wouldn’t want students flying around their common rooms.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>And
you can’t just levitate them down,” Harry added.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Oh
no,” Luna said with concern, “They’re very
fragile.”</span></span></p><p>
Ginny
went over to the firebox and grabbed a piece of kindling,
transfiguring it into a butterfly net as she walked back to them, “I
was going to get them down myself but Luna said I couldn’t.”
She thrust the net into Harry’s hands.</p><p>“<span><span>You
have a game tomorrow,” Luna said, “It’s better to
be safe. Besides, Harry’s much better at being injured.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Thanks,”
Harry said ruefully. He looked the ladder over with distrust. He
asked Ginny, “You’ll hold the ladder?”</span></span></p><p>
Ginny
nodded. Still holding her wand thoughtfully, she cast a lighten
weight charm over Harry, “Just in case. I’ll be able to
catch you,” she grinned and winked</p><p>“<span><span>My
hero,” Harry muttered, carefully climbing the faintly squeaking
ladder until he was near the top of the high ceiling. He held on with
one hand, his jaw clenched, as he stretched the net out and very
carefully caught a bauble and pulled it down to himself. He removed
the floating charm and took a few steps down to hand Luna a bauble.
He repeated this eight more times, looking a little annoyed at he
gave Luna the tenth one.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Why
did you charm these to float in the first place, Luna?” Harry
asked.</span></span></p><p>
Luna
carefully took the blue glass orb and put it away in a fancy wooden
box, “I wanted to make them dance,” she said
matter-of-factly.</p><p>
Harry
rolled his eyes, “Right, of course.” he huffed a sigh and
climbed up for the eleventh, scooped it up and swung the net down to
let Luna pull it out herself, while he leaned against the top rung.</p><p>“<span><span>Thank
you for helping, Harry,” Luna said, holding the green bauble
between two hands.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
shrugged, lifting the net up to catch the last one. It had drifted
the furthest and in order to get the net close enough he had to lean
out and off to the side, holding onto the very bottom of the net’s
long pole.</p><p>
There
was the tinkling sound of something glass falling onto the floor.</p><p>“<span><span>Oh-!”
Luna reached after the green ornament even as it quickly rolled out
of reach.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I’ve
got it,” Ginny said, and let go of the ladder.</span></span></p><p>
Without
Ginny to hold the ladder in place, it immediately began to tilt.
Harry jerked back trying to grab on to the top rung with both hands,
his sudden weight shift made the ladder bounce off the wall filling
the air with the sound of creaking wood scraping across stone.</p><p>“<span><span>Watch
out!” Ginny yelled.</span></span></p><p>
And
there was- if Harry had been of a mind to look for it- a slight push,
that sent the ladder plummeting over too fast to be caught by a
levitation spell.</p><p>
Draco
who had been reading, was now standing, his book thrown to the side,
his wand falling from his hand as he reached up, grabbing hold of
Harry as he fell towards him. Even with a lightening spell, they both
ended up on the floor with the wind knocked out of them. The ladder
bounced off Harry’s back and slid to the floor with a clatter.</p><p>
Harry
groaned, pushing himself up into a sitting position with careful
stiff movements.</p><p>
Draco
stared fixedly at the ceiling, a little frown and a faint flush on
his face, “At your leisure, Potter.”</p><p>
Ginny
and Luna glanced at each other, sharing a look of relief that
everything had worked out.</p><p>
Harry
nodded as he shoved the ladder over and got off Draco, kneeling
beside him and rubbing his forehead as he offered Draco a hand to
help him sit up.</p><p>
Draco
hesitated and then took Harry’s hand with a sigh, “Did
you hit your head?”</p><p>
Harry
shook his head, “I’m fine,” he was looking Draco
over, “Are you okay?”</p><p>“<span><span>Other
than being squashed by an oaf, yes,” Draco said.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>
Draco
huffed and looked around, retrieving his book from where he had
dropped it.</p><p>“<span><span>You
caught me,” Harry said softly.</span></span></p><p>
The
tops of Draco’s cheeks pinked, “So? Was I supposed to let
you knock yourself unconscious?” he said it dismissively,
turning away and pushing himself to his feet.</p><p>“<span><span>Thank
you,” Harry said just as quietly, looking slightly stunned.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
spared him a single nervous glance before sitting back in his chair
and opening his book in front of his face so his expression was
hidden, “You should get some bruise cream from Pomfrey.”</p><p>“<span><span>I-
yeah,” Harry said pushing himself to his feet and making his
way toward the common room door. He paused to ask Ginny, “Do
you still need help or-?”</span></span></p><p>
Ginny
furrowed her brow, dropping down and then jumping up into the air to
grab hold of the bottom of the net, still floating half off the
ground. She pulled it down and took the purple bauble out, “Nope,
we’ve got it. Sorry about letting go of the ladder.”</p><p>
Luna
pulled herself out from under a couch with the green ornament, “You
were wonderful Harry! You fell so gracefully, like a wounded duck.”</p><p>“<span><span>Yeah,
sure,” Harry said, wincing slightly as he pulled open the
common room door and made his way out into the hall.</span></span></p><p>
Luna
tilted her head to one side, curling a strand of blond hair around
her finger, “Do you suppose Harry was hurt worse than he said?”</p><p>
Ginny
looked over at Luna’s expression, reading it only as she could,
before adding a bit loudly, “Hard to say. You know Harry, he
never complains.”</p><p>
There
was a muffled swear behind them and then Draco pushed past looking
furiously annoyed as he followed Harry outside.</p><p>
Ginny
grinned and cast a patronus. No sooner had it disappeared down the
dorm hallway than Ron and Hermione came running out.</p><p>“<span><span>How’d
it go?” Ron asked.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Did
it work?” Hermione said at nearly the same time.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I
think it went very well,” Luna said airily.</span></span></p><p>
Ginny
nodded and told them everything that happened.</p><p>
Ron
and Hermione exchanged a worried look.</p><p>“<span><span>Is
Harry hurt?” Hermione asked.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Nah,”
Ginny said with a flip of her hand, “bruised a bit, sure, but
that’s it. I cast a lighten weight charm on him, he practically
bounced.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>And
Draco will look after him,” Luna said.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>It
was </span></span><i><span>adorable</span></i><span><span> really,”
a voice said sarcastically from behind them.</span></span></p><p>
The
group turned to where Blaise, Pansy and Theo were all sitting on one
of the longer couches.</p><p>
Pansy
frowned and kicked Blaise lightly on the ankle, “It <i>was </i>cute.”</p><p>“<span><span>Yes,
Pansy,” Blaise said dryly, “You know what I mean.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Just
tell them,” Theo said distractedly, his quill skittering across
a foot of parchment that was nearly filled with his sharp small
handwriting.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>We
were wondering if you’d consider a different sort of tactic,”
Pansy said.</span></span></p><p>
Blaise
smirked faintly, “A more Slytherin sort of plan.”</p><p>“<span><span>A
whot-?” Ron said.</span></span></p><p>
Hermione
said carefully, “What are you talking about?”</p><p>
Pansy
rolled her eyes dramatically, “Getting Draco together with your
Boy wonder, of course.”</p><p>“<span><span>It’s
terribly obvious what you’re doing,” Blaise said.</span></span></p><p>
Theo
hummed in agreement, “Not subtle at all.”</p><p>“<span><span>The
Hufflepuffs have probably figured it out by now,” Pansy said.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>And…”
Hermione quirked an eyebrow with a lopsided smile, “you want to
help?”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>We
want to see Draco happy too,” Pansy said, a little affronted.</span></span></p><p>
Theo
carefully wiped his quill off, picked up the parchment and held it
out to them, “And we your need assistance to pull it off.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<span><span>What
do you want, Pansy?” Draco asked bitterly, pulling his cloak
around himself more tightly as a bitingly cold wind gust of wind
swept of over them on the Hogwarts grounds.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Nothing
wrong with a little fresh air, is there?” Pansy said primly.</span></span></p><p>
Draco’s
expression darkened, “You hate fresh air <i>and</i> pointless
exercise. If you’re going to lie to me at least try to be a
little more clever about it.”</p><p>
Pansy
was quiet for a moment, the only sound was the faint crunch of the
thin layer of snow, frozen hard overnight, melting in places under a
brilliant late winter sun that seemed to be promising an early
spring.</p><p>“<span><span>You’re
in a shit mood. I wanted to help,” Pansy said, “and you
happen to like long, pointless, moody walks.”</span></span></p><p>
That
seemed closer to the truth although Draco could tell Pansy was still
hiding something. Blaise was the only one who could lie to his face
and get away with it.</p><p>“<span><span>They’re
not moody,” Draco retorted, on principle.</span></span></p><p>
Pansy
snorted inelegantly, “Whatever you say, sunshine.”</p><p>
They
followed the path along the bank of the lake, to the edge of the
forest and back again. Right before they were meant to head back into
the castle, Pansy veered off, walking out onto the small dock that,
as far as anyone knew, was only used for the first years boats on the
very first day of every school year.</p><p>“<span><span>What
are you doing?” Draco grumbled but followed her out onto the
creaking wood, ducking his head into his scarf as the wind whipped
across the black lake.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>It’s
our last year,” Pansy said quietly.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
rolled his eyes, “Sentimentality doesn’t suit you.”</p><p>“<span><span>I
didn’t say I would miss it,” she said sharply before her
expression softened, “Just, a lot has happened here. It’s
strange to think we won’t be coming back.”</span></span></p><p>
Draco’s
nose wrinkled but he kept his mouth shut, not particularly wanting to
encourage Pansy one way or another into any sort of conversation that
would increase the amount of time it would take to get back to the
warm castle.</p><p>“<span><span>I
don’t want to have any regrets,” Pansy was saying,
turning to him, “You know, Draco?”</span></span></p><p>
He
raised an eyebrow, “If you’re done reminiscing like a
soppy Hufflepuff?”</p><p>
She
frowned at him, “Oh, just use a warming charm  if you’re
cold, you ninny.”</p><p>“<span><span>Or
we could just leave,” he said pointedly, none-the-less taking
out his wand to replace the waning warming charm he had cast before
they left. He turned the tip of his wand to himself, the words of the
spell on were on his lips when his feet slid out from under him.</span></span></p><p>
He
had one breathless moment of utter terror as he fell backwards where
the world seemed to be holding its breath. He hit the water. He
hadn’t the time or thought to hold his breath and the
bitingly cold water over his head filled his mind with panic. His
feet touched the bottom and he pushed to the surface and took a deep
gasping breath. The water was only chest deep.</p><p>
It
was so cold it hurt.</p><p>
Draco’s
fear and panic was instantly replaced with pure and utter fury.</p><p>
Someone
was running up the dock and he expected to see Blaise or Theo,
laughing their tits off. It was neither. In fact, Pansy seemed to be
conspicuously missing and Potter was running up. Another plot.</p><p>“<span><span>Are
you alright?” Potter asked breathlessly and held out his hand
to pull Draco up onto the dock.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Do
I look alright to you?” he snapped, slapping Potter’s
hand away and walking slowly up to the shore.</span></span></p><p>
Potter
brow creased with worry, “I could help you out.”</p><p>“<span><span>Then
you’ll be wet as well and I’m entirely certain that’s
just what they want,” Draco said. He didn’t bother
stopping at the shore, just aimed himself at the castle doors. He was
already shivering so badly his whole body seemed at risk of shaking
itself apart.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>They?”
Potter asked, walking along side him.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Your
wand is missing?” Draco asked, taking note of the fact that
his wand had been taken or was on the bottom of the lake.</span></span></p><p>
Potter
patted down his jacket, then unzipped it to check his inner pockets
with growing urgency, “It’s- It’s gone!” He
turned on his heel, staring back the way he had come, trying to
decide whether to go back and look. It took him only a second to
catch back up with Draco.</p><p>“<span><span>You
wouldn’t have found it anyway,” Draco said shortly.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Later,”
Potter said stubbornly, “It’s more important to get you
dry again.”</span></span></p><p>
Draco
felt his chest tighten into an ache and had to close his eyes for a
moment. Never before in his life had he ever imagined kindness could
be so painful. “You w-wouldn’t have found because it’s
not there,” Draco said, “Whoever you were with- Weasley
probably- t-took it when you weren’t looking.</p><p>“<span><span>How
did you know I was with Ron?” Potter hurried a few steps ahead
to hold the door open for him and then quickly closed it behind them,
“Why would he-?” he asked, his brow furrowing.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
peeled off his scarf and dropped it on the floor of the hallway.</p><p>
Potter
reached down to retrieve it.</p><p>“<span><span>Don’t
bother,” Draco said slowly unbuttoning his cloak with shaking
hands, “The elves w-will get them. It’s their job.”
His cloak slumped to the ground in a wet soggy heap.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>We
should get back to the dorm, find some warm clothes.”</span></span></p><p>
Draco
was trying to get the smaller buttons on his robes undone but was
shivering so badly he couldn’t keep hold to manoeuvre them
through the small holes.</p><p>
Potter
stepped closer, “Here-” he pushed Draco’s hands out
of the way and began undoing the buttons at Draco’s throat.</p><p>
Draco
shuddered but not from the cold. “The dorms will be locked. The
common room is probably empty.” There would be a roaring fire
and a small couch set in front of it though. He frowned as he became
more and more certain. It was just the sort of romantic garbage Pansy
was likely to think up. Blaise would have gone along with it because
he’d think it was hilarious and Theo would help just because he
liked making elaborate plans.</p><p>
Draco
pushed Potter’s hand away as soon as he was done. Draco turned
his back as he pulled his wet robes off and left them in the pile by
the door. His button up and slacks clung to him like a second skin.
He was still unbearably cold.</p><p>“<span><span>Why
would they lock the dorms?” Potter asked.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
sighed, clasping his arms around himself as he made his way up the
stairs. Really it was no wonder Potter had barely managed one
romance. Anyone with half a brain would guess the plot by now at
least.</p><p>
Potter
followed him, “If the dorms are locked, then where are you
going?”</p><p>“<span><span>Hospital
wing,” Draco said shortly.</span></span></p><p>
Potter
didn’t respond.</p><p>
When
Draco dared to glance back at him, he looked torn and confused. It
made Draco’s heart ache all the more. Draco looked away and
kept his eyes fixed in front of himself and on his destination. He
refused to indulge in hopeless fantasy and impossible dreams.</p><p>“<span><span>Oh
dear, what happened to you?” Pomfrey asked as soon as he
stepped inside.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I
was pushed into the lake,” Draco said. The batty woman
immediately looked at Potter. “Not him,” Draco said
impatiently, “It was a former friend I plan to poison in her
sleep.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>There
will be none of that, Mr Malfoy,” Pomfrey tutted, taking out
her wand and casting a drying spell and then a warming spell over him
in quick succession. “Stay put, I want to get you a pepper-up,
just in case,” she said as she hurried back to her potion
stores.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
left out a breath of relief and absently brushed his hair back with
his fingertips. The water had left it wavy.</p><p>“<span><span>Does
your hair normally do that?” Potter asked in a strangely quiet
voice.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>When
it’s wet and dries wrong. It’s atrocious.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>It’s
nice,” Potter said.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
felt himself start to flush and turned his head away so no one could
see, “You would think that, agent of chaos that you are.”</p><p>
Pomfrey
bustled back and pressed  a small vial into his hand, “Here
you are dear.”</p><p>
Draco
quickly took the potion with a grimace and handed the empty vial
back, “Now, seeing as I was nearly killed and greatly
traumatized, I shall be staying here overnight.”</p><p>“<span><span>The
water wasn’t even that deep,” Potter said, with a faint
smile of disbelief.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
glared at him, “Shut up, Potter.”</p><p>
Pomfrey
sighed and shook her head briefly, “If you must, Mr Malfoy.”</p><p>
Draco
inclined his head to her, “Thank you.”</p><p>“<span><span>Only
because I know there’s no getting rid of you once you’ve
got the idea in your head and I’m not in the mood for your
dramatics today,” she said with a patronizing smile, “I’ll
get you some pyjamas, pick whatever bed you like.”</span></span></p><p>
The
springs squeaked as Draco sat on the nearest bed and began undoing
the laces on his boots.</p><p>“<span><span>You’re
really going to stay here?” Potter asked, shifting his weight
uneasily.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Yes.”
Draco said stiffly, pulling off one boot and set it neatly on the
floor.</span></span></p><p>
Potter
shifted his weight again. He was picking at his cuticles. “I
just…. I want to apologize,” he said tentatively.</p><p>
Draco
paused from pulling off his other boot and shot Potter an icy glare,
“For <i>what</i>?”</p><p>“<span><span>I
don’t know, anything? Everything?” he shrugged, looking
upset, “I just want things to go back to normal between us, you
know?”</span></span></p><p>
Draco
dropped his other boot. It hit the floor with a thud that filled the
whole room. The twisting pain in Draco’s heart felt like it had
been pierced with ice. “There’s no normal to go back to,”
he said flatly.</p><p>“<span><span>What?”
Potter asked, his eyes going wide.</span></span></p><p>
Draco
clenched his teeth and turned his head away, picking up his boot and
carefully setting it beside the other in a neat pair. “Leave me
alone, Potter. Can you do that?” he said softly, “Just
stay away from me. Tell your friends to stay away as well, and mine
if you see them.”</p><p>“<span><span>Draco-”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Don’t,”
he cut Potter off, his eyes beginning to ache with growing tears even
as he tried to blink them back, “I’m tired of this. Of
all this.” He squeezed his eyes shut and waited until he heard
Potter walk away, the door shutting behind him.</span></span></p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<span><span>Do
you suppose they’re okay?” Hermione asked nervously.</span></span></p><p>
Blaise
leaned back against the headboard of Draco’s bed, turning the
page of his magazine, “No one’s going to die from falling
in three feet of water,” he said languidly.</p><p>
Pansy
was laying across his legs looking completely at ease despite the
fact that it couldn’t have been comfortable, “It wouldn’t
have even been an issue if we had gone with my first plan,” she
said..</p><p>
Ron
frowned and shifted uneasily on his own bed, letting himself lean
against Hermione’s shoulder, “We’re <i>not</i> locking
them in a closet.”</p><p>“<span><span>Absolutely
not,” Hermione echoed.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Oh,
but it’s </span></span><i><span>so</span></i><span><span> good,”
Pansy pouted, dropped her head back so she could look at Ron and
Hermione upside down, “It always works in my books.”</span></span></p><p>
Blaise
rolled his eyes without looking up.</p><p>
Hermione
sighed and bit her lip, looking over her shoulder at the door for
about the twentieth time.</p><p>“<span><span>Good
grief, how many romance novels do you read, anyway?” Ron asked.</span></span></p><p>
Pansy
shot him a sour look that didn’t quite work upside-down, “None
of your business, Weasley.”</p><p>“<span><span>Do
you think three bottles of fire whiskey was enough for a party?”
Theo asked, looking up from the homework he was working on, “I
still think four or five would have been a better amount.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>We’re
just trying to distract them for an hour or so,” Blaise said
absently, “We don’t need the whole dormitory utterly
blitzed.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Next
time,” Pansy said, sitting up with an excited grin, “We
ought to lock them in a bedroom, with only one bed.” She raised
her eyebrows expectantly and let them fall when it didn’t get
the reaction she had been hoping for.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
had gone red, “I don’t think- I mean that’s a bit-”
he broke off and cleared his throat, pointedly looking away at a
window.</p><p>
Pansy
tsked, “You’re such a prude. Besides-” she drew out
the word mockingly, “-I was only thinking about a little
cuddling, waking up wrapped in each other’s arms, that sort of
thing.” She smirked, “Seems like you’re being the
pervert here.</p><p>“<span><span>I
am not!” Ron shot back, even redder still. “I don’t
read romance novels, how was I supposed to know!”</span></span></p><p>
Hermione
said, “This isn’t a romance novel and in my experience
boys are horny all the time. So they might very well- you know- in
that situation.”</p><p>
Pansy
shrugged, “Well if they get together, they’re going to
fuck anyway.”</p><p>
Ron
choked and fell into a coughing fit.</p><p>“<span><span>Such
a prude,” Pansy said pointedly.</span></span></p><p>
Blaise
smirked faintly, looking over the top of the magazine, “We all
know you’re a virgin, Pansy.”</p><p>
Pansy
blushed faintly and smacked Blaise’s thigh, “Shut up,
Blaise! At least I can talk about sex without turning into a
raspberry!”</p><p>
Blaise
looked over at Ron, “I’d say he’s more like a
tomato.”</p><p>
Pansy
curled her lip, “I don’t like tomatoes.”</p><p>
Blaise
shrugged.</p><p>
Ron
glared at the both of them.</p><p>
Hermione
cast a tempus, “It’s been nearly two hours. That’s
long enough isn’t it?”</p><p>
They
all looked at one another.</p><p>
Finally,
Hermione just got up. She went to the door and pulling the chair away
that they had jammed under the handle and pulled it open. She gasped
faintly and stepped back as Harry, who had been sitting against the
wall opposite, stood up.</p><p>
Harry
stepped into the room, looking over the five of them.</p><p>
Pansy
scrambled off the bed, “Where’s Draco?”</p><p>
Blaise
dropped his magazine and sat up.</p><p>
Harry
walked over to Ron and holding his hand out, “My wand.”</p><p>
Ron
quickly pulled Harry’s wand out of his robes and handed it over
sheepishly, “You, uh, dropped it?”</p><p>“<span><span>No,
I didn’t,” Harry said a little bitterly, “It was
you lot behind everything, wasn’t it? The lake and ladder and
getting us to sit next to each other.”</span></span></p><p>
There
was silence.</p><p>“<span><span>We
were just trying to help,” Hermione said quietly.</span></span></p><p>
Blaise
stepped around the beds, “Where’s Draco?”</p><p>“<span><span>The
hospital wing,” Harry said and added sharply before they could
talk over him, “he’s </span></span><i><span>fine</span></i><span><span>.
He just didn’t want to see any of us.”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Us?”
Ron straightened, “Not you too?”</span></span></p><p>
Harry’s
expression crumbled and he looked away, “I know how he feels.”
He sat heavily on the edge of his bed, kicking off his shoes. “No
more schemes,” he dragged his gaze up to look at each of them
in turn, “No more plans, no more <i>helping,</i>” he
finished bitterly. He pointed his wand at the heavy brocade curtains
around his bed and they snapped closed around him, followed by the
unnatural stillness of a silencing spell.</p><p>
Hermione
bit her lip, “Ron-”</p><p>
Ron
stood and went over to her, wrapping Hermione up in a hug.</p><p>“<span><span>Fuck,”
Blaise said quietly.</span></span></p><p>
Pansy
balled her hands into fists. “This isn’t how it was
supposed to go at all!” She sniffled and ran from the room,
wiping her eyes.</p><p>
Blaise
glanced at Ron and Hermione and then quickly followed Pansy.</p><p>
Theo
gathered up his homework with a sighed and trailed after them, saying
just before he left, “Well, it was fun while it lasted.”</p><p>“<span><span>We’ve
ruined it haven’t we?” Hermione said, her voice muffled
in Ron’s shirt.</span></span></p><p>
Ron
squeezed her a little tighter.</p><p><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
</p><p>Harry
sighed and looked through his trunk again, in case he had missed
something the first three times he had looked but no such luck. All
his hoodies were gone. He stood, letting his trunk fall closed with a
clunk and went over to his bed, pulling up the sheets and looking
underneath. He hadn’t worn any of them for ages not since
things had started to go bad with Draco. He winced at the thought and
the ache lodged firmly in his chest tightened.</p><p>“<span><span>Lost
something?”</span></span></p><p>
Harry
looked over at Neville, “My hoodies.” he frowned faintly,
“but it’s fine. I’ll just wear one of my knit
jumpers.”</p><p>
Neville
tipped his wand up, the fine mist that had been spraying over his
plants stopped. He murmured and incantation and looped his wand over
the little collection of plant, encasing them in a bubble like a
miniature greenhouse. “Why not just steal one of Malfoy’s?”
he suggested, “He’s always stealing yours after all.”</p><p>
Harry
grimaced, looking over at Draco’s empty bed, “No. We’re
not… on good terms.”</p><p>
Neville’s
eyebrows rose slightly in surprise, “You two had a fight? Well,
I’m sure you’ll work it out.” He looked over his
plants again and gave a little nod before turning away, “Do you
want anything from the kitchens?”</p><p>
Harry
shook his head, smiling weakly, “No thanks.”</p><p>
Neville
left and Harry realized he was still staring at Draco’s bed and
pulled his eyes away. He stopped though when he noticed a green
jumper laying over the end of Draco’s bed. It was darker than
Slytherin green and was finely woven, unlike his jumpers from Molly.</p><p>
Harry
nervously edged over to Draco’s bed and ran his fingers over
the jumper. He had never felt something so soft. He glanced around
the empty dorm before picking it up and holding it out in front of
him. He just- He really…</p><p>
Harry
pulled his tee-shirt over his head and dropped it on the floor,
pulling the green jumped on, careful not to stretch it. It was just
for a second, he told himself, just to see how it felt. He ignored
how hard his heart was pounding. It was soft and warm, he ran his
hands down the front and shivered. Harry pulled the collar of the
jumper up and dipped his nose into the soft cashmere, it smelled like
Draco.</p><p>
Out
of the corner of his eye, he saw his reflection in the large windows
along the wall and turned. He stared at himself and couldn’t
help remembering all those time Draco would steal his hoodies,
stretching out the sleeves to pull them down to cover his hands,
pulling the hood over his head when he was sulking.</p><p>
The
pain lodged in Harry’s chest that had been growing for weeks,
squeezed with an ache that brought tears to the edge of his vision.
He knew what it was now. The name of this feeling.</p><p>
Harry
squeezed his eyes shut, “I like him.”</p><p>
It
was only a whisper but it seemed to fill the room.</p><p>
The
door shot open and Draco stormed in, “- whoever you are, going
through <i>my</i> things, I’m going to hex your head
so far up-” he froze at the sight of Harry.</p><p>
And
Harry flushed feeling entirely caught out, embarrassed and nervous.</p><p>
Draco
swallowed hard, taking Harry in from top to bottom.</p><p>“<span><span>I-
I just-” the words caught in Harry’s throat.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>That’s
my jumper,” Draco said, sounding a little dazed.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
grasped the hem, “Sorry. I’ll take it off.”</p><p>
Draco
crossed the space between them in a few long strides, grabbing
Harry’s wrist with a little shake of his head.</p><p>
Harry
held still, Draco’s hand like a burning brand on his skin.</p><p>
Draco
studied him a small painful furrow between his brows. “You look
like you’re mine…” he murmured softly.</p><p>
Harry’s
breathing hitched.</p><p>
Draco
jerked his hand away with a start, shaking his head like he was
waking from a dream. “I- I was-” he stopped and took a
step back, then another, his body twisting towards the door.</p><p>“<span><span>Don’t
go!” Harry burst out, darting forward to grab Draco’s
arm, “Please, I-”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I
can’t do this,” Draco said, his voice taking on a frantic
edge, “I can’t be your friend anymore, I can’t-
It’ll kill me,” his voice cracked and he tried to step
away, pull his arm free.</span></span></p><p>
Harry
grasped after him, catching Draco’s hand and pulling him back.
He wove their fingers together, “What about-”</p><p>“<i><span>Harry</span></i><span><span>,”
Draco pleaded. His hand was starting to shake and Harry only held
onto it tighter.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>What
about more than friends?” Harry said, “What if-”</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>I
don’t want your pity,” Draco bit out, his eyes sharp and
clear even as his breathing came out ragged and short, just short of
gasping.</span></span></p><p>
Harry’s
grip loosened and Draco jerked his hand back, quickly retreating a
few steps and rubbing his hand like it burned. He kept Harry’s
gaze for just a second and then spun to the door.</p><p>“<span><span>I
like you,” Harry said.</span></span></p><p>
The
door handle rattled faintly under Draco’s hand but he made no
move to turn it or move at all. Harry’s words had seemed to
have frozen him in place.</p><p>
Harry
took a quick deep breath to try and catch up in this race his heart
was running, “I know I’m slow. I should have figured it
out ages ago but I have now and I-” he swallowed, breathless
and light headed all over again.</p><p>
Draco
dared to look at him, his eyes shining with unshed tears even as he
clenched his jaw defiantly.</p><p>
Harry
looked down at himself, clad in green, a green the same shade as his
eyes. He clutched at the delicate fabric as he looked up at Draco, “I
am yours, Draco.”</p><p>
Draco’s
hand fell off the handle and his whole body wavered like he might
fall down.</p><p>“<span><span>And
maybe-” Harry said faintly, “-you might be mine?”</span></span></p><p>
Draco
jaw clenched, “You are <i>slow</i>, and <i>stupid,</i> and
utterly <i>ridiculous</i>.”</p><p>
Harry
had to keep himself from smiling but didn’t quite succeed,
“Yeah.”</p><p>“<i><span>And </span></i><span><span>full
of yourself,” Draco added.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Draco-”
Harry wavered forward and then was moving forward and Draco met him
halfway, wrapping him up in his arms.</span></span></p><p>
He
slid his hand over Draco’s back, the other clutched his
shoulder. He could feel Draco brush a tentative hand over the nape of
his neck, his cheek pressing tight to his hair like he was something
precious Draco thought he had lost forever.</p><p>
Draco
pulled back just enough to cup Harry’s cheek, turning his head
to pressing their lips together. Harry clutched him a little bit
tighter, eyes fluttering shut as he kissed back until his knees felt
weak.</p><p>
Draco
pulled back, murmuring against his lips, “Of course I’m
yours, moron.”</p><p>
Harry
reached up and brushed the tears from the corners of Draco’s
eyes. Draco closed his eyes, leaning into Harry’s touch.</p><p>“<span><span>Why
are you wearing my jumper anyway?” Draco asked, stiffly
pretending he hadn’t had his tears brushed away.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Well,”
Harry hesitated, taking the opportunity to kiss the corner of Draco’s
mouth, who turned his head to pull Harry into a full, proper kiss. “I
couldn’t…” he kissed him again, biting Draco’s
bottom lip gently, “find any of my hoodies so…”</span></span></p><p>
A
faint flush rose on the tops of Draco’s cheeks.</p><p>
Harry’s
brow furrowed slightly, “What?”</p><p>“<span><span>I
might have stolen them,” Draco confessed.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Why?”
Harry asked.</span></span></p><p>“<span><span>Longbottom
suggested that I ought to, to get you back for…” he
trailed off.</span></span></p><p>
Harry’s
eyes widened, “Neville was the one that suggested I take your
jumper! And this one was one laying out on the end of your bed-”</p><p>“<span><span>I
never leave my clothes lying about,” Draco said, “<i>And</i> Longbottom
was the one that told me someone was going through my clothes.”</span></span></p><p>
The
both hurried to the door and yanked it open, more shocked than
surprised to see Neville leaning against the door frame.</p><p>“<span><span>I
thought you were going to the kitchens,” Harry said lamely.</span></span></p><p>
Neville
smiled and pushed himself up, “Yeah, I just thought I’d
make sure you two weren’t interrupted.” He looked down
where Draco was still holding onto Harry’s waist and Harry had
grabbed hold of Draco’s arm, “I think I’ll bring
back something sweet, to celebrate.” He gave them a cheerful
wave and left.</p><p>
Harry
and Draco looked at one another, their expressions of astonishment
turning to grins as they leaned against one another and laughed.</p><p>❤ <span><span>-The
End- ❤</span></span></p><p><br/>
