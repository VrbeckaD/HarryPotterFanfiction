    <p>“This was a bad idea,” Draco sighs as he follows Harry and they step out onto Diagon Alley. As the magical gateway at the back of the Leaky Cauldron slowly seals behind them, Draco ponders if there is still time to disapparate.</p><p>Harry turns his head and smirks. “I thoroughly disagree, I’m dying to show you off. You, Draco Malfoy, are way too handsome, too gorgeous, and too sexy to keep you hidden away behind closed doors any longer,” he says and Draco can’t help but roll his eyes at Harry’s mawkish declaration. <em>Insane, that what you are</em>, he thinks and when Harry gives him a pointed look that screams <em>I-know-what-you’re-thinking-stop-it</em>, he wonders when exactly he has turned into such a pushover. Lately, he is all too content to let Harry make all decisions and take the lead in most aspects of their lives.</p><p>“You’ll regret this,” Draco suspires, though he isn’t sure why. It’s not like they made the decision to publicise their relationship on a whim. They did talk about it. A lot. But Draco still feels apprehensive and knows it’s only a matter of time before people start noticing that Harry Potter, <em>The Saviour</em> himself, has come to Diagon Alley. Once they do, they will also notice that the person standing next to him is none other than Draco Malfoy. When that happens, the photographers will start to swarm around them, snapping one photograph after another while <em>The Prophet’s</em> reporters will start firing questions at Harry, demanding to know why he is standing next to a former Death Eater.</p><p>“<em>I will not</em>,” Harry says resolutely and then does something that instantly silences Draco’s thoughts and fills him with a strong sense of security. Harry takes his hand, wraps his fingers around them and as their palms press together and Harry squeezes gently and possessively, Draco feels protected and cared for. He suddenly feels entirely confident that they’ve made the right choice and he is sure that Harry knows exactly what they are doing. And if he doesn’t, they’ll figure it out somehow.</p>
