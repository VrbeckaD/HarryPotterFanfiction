    <p>The breeze blew through the forest as the creature scuttled by. It's poofy tail was lowered to the ground as it ran across the forest floor. Clawed paws gouged faint lines into the dirt as it scrambled home.</p>
<p>TWANG!</p>
<p>A faint whistle of air rushed past as the arrow was released from it's perch upon the bow.</p>
<p>THUNK!</p>
<p>The squirrel dropped onto the floor of the forest after being shot in the head with an arrow. The camouflaged man briskly stepped out from behind the oak tree and into the clearing. </p>
<p>The man crouched gripping the animal's corpse in his calloused covered hands. He grabbed the arrow's shaft and yanked the arrowhead from the dead squirrel's own head. He flicked away the squirrel's blood and brain matter onto the sparsely grass covered dirt.</p>
<p>His name was Daryl Dixon and he was 33 years old. </p>
<p>He had an older brother called Merle, who left to join the army, and an abusive father, who spent majority of his time drunk, high or betting with his bar mates.</p>
<p>Daryl spent most of his time hiding away in the forest. The only place he really had to himself and nature. The forest was his hideaway from his family and the plants and animals were his only friends when his mother died from Will.</p>
<p>The forest was his sanctuary. </p>
<p>His home.</p>
