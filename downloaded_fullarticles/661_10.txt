    <p>She’s lived this life for a long time. Unseeing.</p>
<p>They tell her it’s a mercy she lived past infancy, that she is blessed by Dumbledore. It feels like a curse. She was born sickly and although she survived, she lost her sight.</p>
<p>Her parents are loving. They’re the best parents Hermione could have asked for. They raised her knowing she’d never see and the difficulties that come with such in this world.</p>
<p>Hermione learns things most wouldn’t have to. She memorizes the pathways around their village. She learns to avoid main roads as the caravans won’t much care about one girl in the way. She always stays behind people’s voices in case a fire or other hazard lay ahead of them. She mainly stays with people she knows. It used to be she would stay with her parents whenever they left the house but as she gets older they aren’t around as much. Her father travels to nearby villages to help heal them while her mother is busy seeing to their own village.</p>
<p>As they accompanied her less and less, it got more dangerous. She trips and runs into people more often. She can’t hold it against them as they are working to support her but it makes matters more tedious.</p>
<p>Despite this, she also finds herself enjoying her freedom a bit more. It is restful not having people constantly hover over her. The rest of the village is sure to not let her stray into anything too dangerous.</p>
<p>She goes to school in the largest village nearby as all children her age do. They initially rejected her presence until her mother showed up and argued that Hermione would understand everything said and she wasn’t to be left out. The school acquiesced.</p>
<p>Hermione would always be grateful to her mother for this. This is where she went from surviving to living. She treasures the moments away from home, even if she has to learn about gods and goddesses. Her disdain for the gods persists throughout her childhood and into adulthood. Everyone she meets will tell her how blessed she is by Dumbledore’s grace and it only makes her hate grow. </p>
<p>Instead, she pursues literature and poetry. She can’t read it herself but the teachers and other students read it aloud in class.</p>
<p>She can’t work an art like architecture nor can she work a laborious job like farming. Her options are limited and her future is unknown.</p>
<p>Unknown to her, her salvation will come in the form of a peculiar girl.</p>
<p>Before her though, Hermione meets Harry and Ron during her first year at the school.</p>
<p>“How do you always know the right answer?” A voice groans miserably from next to her. She is walking through a hallway towards the carriage that takes the children home when the voice pipes up.</p>
<p>Hermione shrugs. “It’s not that hard.” The teacher gives the answers, it’s just a matter of remembering. A different boy makes a derisive snort but doesn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Could you help me? I’m terrible with dates.” The first boy asks beseechingly. “Ron’s not much help either.” He adds pointedly.</p>
<p>“Hey!” The second boy, Ron, replies defensively.</p>
<p>She can feel her irritation spike. “I won’t do your work.”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to, just help us out so we don’t fail.” The first boy reassures her. “Oh, I’m Harry.”</p>
<p>“Hermione.” She introduces herself. She considers the fact that they might try and bully her into doing their work. Her teachers give her leeway over her work so long as she demonstrates she understands the lesson, she wouldn’t even be able to do their work without being caught. Work aside, she wants friends. She hasn’t really ever had friends. Until her father’s more recent absence her parents had barely left her alone. She decides she wanted to try friends, see if they could work. “I’ll help.”</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione. It’s them for years. </p>
<p>She falls into place with them so easily. They don’t understand why she is so passionate about learning. They can’t understand what it is to be unable to see, unable to see beauty but hear the way poets saw it. She clings to written and spoken words with a desperate manner.</p>
<p>Although it is always the three of them, others follow. A group forms. Ginny, Fred, George, Neville, Dean, Seamus, and eventually, Luna.</p>
<p>The first time Luna and Hermione really talk is during an excursion into the forests.</p>
<p>They are prone to wanting to explore the forests near their villages. They have a sense of adventure most of the locals had lost generations ago. Most of the families are concerned with keeping the people fed and happy and didn’t seek much beyond that. Life moves in cycles of work and rest for most. However, the group of friends that slowly falls together wants more than that.</p>
<p>Her friends are very good about her limits. They know when she needs help and not to stray too far from her due to the terrain but manage to do so without hovering as her parents do. Sometimes they want to go further then she can and she tends to stay behind. Neville usually stays with her, not wanting to go along with whatever the others are so adamant about. However, this time Neville is sick and decided not to go with them which leads to the conundrum of who’d stay behind with her.</p>
<p>The situation leads to her being entirely exasperated. “I’ll be fine by myself, you don’t need to worry.”</p>
<p>“No, we can’t leave you behind. There’s wolves.” Ron answers, squeezing her shoulder.</p>
<p>“I doubt that’ll be an issue.” Hermione rolls her eyes at their worries.</p>
<p>“You’d never leave one of us behind.” Harry adds.</p>
<p>“He’s right, that too.” Ron agrees quickly.</p>
<p>“I’ll stay.” Luna speaks definitively.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to do that.” She doesn’t want someone to stay behind who doesn’t want to and Luna has always gone with the others. Moments like these, where the focus is on her, makes her skin feel thin and nervous sweat gathers. She hates attention on herself for the most part and is happy to let one of the others soak up it up. Harry’s brief hugs and Ron’s jokes that make her feel like she belongs are enough. She doesn’t need the group looking at her, talking about her. Especially when it is about this.</p>
<p>“I want to. The spirits are very loud today.” Luna hums and sits down on a log next to her. </p>
<p>That is the other reason.</p>
<p>She’s avoided Luna up until now due to her belief in gods, goddesses, and everything in between. Several of her friends made the mistake of commenting on how she was blessed but all of them know by now her distaste for such things and never speak of it near her. They also likely know it is why she avoids Luna out of all their friends as she is the biggest believer.</p>
<p>“It’s settled!” Harry claps his hands before rubbing them together. Hermione figures he is anxious over what she’ll say to Luna who he is quite fond of. She does try her best not to be rude but sometimes Luna’s absolute faith can make her grit her teeth worse than a stubbed toe. Harry has also been trying to maneuver the two of them closer for months and is using this as another opportunity.</p>
<p>With barely another word Hermione is left sputtering as the others take off to climb the rather steep hill, leaving her with Luna.</p>
<p>“You don’t quite like me.” Luna says more than asks. Hermione starts sputtering again for an entirely different reason. She is going to get Harry back for this.</p>
<p>“It’s not that!” Hermione rushes. She scratches at her wrist trying to think of a diplomatic way to put it without unintentionally hurting the girl.</p>
<p>Luna lightly taps her hand before taking it in her own. “It’s okay.” She assures her. “I don’t think you’re blessed.” Luna tells her.</p>
<p>“Thank you?” Hermione is completely perplexed by the direction of the conversation.</p>
<p>“You’re not me, I don’t want to change you..” Luna clarifies and Hermione gets what she’s trying to say. She’s so used to people pressuring her into belief, devotion, sacrifice. She’s been told she’d make the perfect priestess to Dumbledore. An example of his mercy.</p>
<p>“Do you often see spirits?” Hermione ventures. Even the devout often don’t claim to see things at least not in her experience.</p>
<p>“Sometimes.” Luna replies easily.</p>
<p>“Right now?” She asks in clarification.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Hermione tries not to be unsettled by that. She fails.</p>
<p>They sit there in silence waiting for the others to return and neither feel the need to speak. When the others come back, they walk as loud as a stampede. Words are shouted and interspersed with loud laughs.</p>
<p>“Good to see you two got along.” Ron’s relieved voice comes from in front of her. Harry isn't the only one nervous over leaving them together it seems.</p>
<p>“Of course we did.” Luna’s sure voice answers.</p>
<p>They head back towards their villages together. When they reach a crossroads where they usually split up she feels Luna loop their arms together. “I’m going with you if you don’t mind.” She whispers as if they are sharing a secret.</p>
<p>“Of course not.” Hermione assures her. She isn’t sure what Luna’s recent interest in her is about but she is curious.</p>
<p>“We’ll see you tomorrow in class.” Ron’s confused voice bids in farewell. Harry gives her a hug before taking off after Fred who’d messed up his hair.</p>
<p>Luna and her turn towards Hermione’s village and set off. Luna lives in the same village as Neville, Dean, and Seamus. The walk to Hermione’s village isn’t long but the sun will be set before they reach the village. With this in mind Hermijbe knows she can’t let Luna walk home alone. “You should stay the night.” Hermione offers. She’d be wracked with worry until she saw Luna in class tomorrow otherwise.</p>
<p>“I’ve always wondered if I’d sleep differently.” Luna replies and Hermione takes that as a yes.</p>
<p>Her parents are still not home when they get there. She knows her mother will be in later that night but her father will not. He’s home even rarer than her. Hermione asks Luna if she would like anything to eat despite being ready for bed herself but Luna declines much to Hermione’s relief. Luna doesn’t speak again until they are lying side by side on the bed.</p>
<p>“You like learning?” Luna finally breaks the silence.</p>
<p>“Yes.” She swallows tightly. Few seem to share her interest, often she’d find her focus on studies would ostracize her if she was not careful. Even Ron, despite being one of her closest friends, has a limit to how much of school talk he can handle.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you write?” Luna asks and Hermione flinches. It is rather obvious why and she isn’t sure why Luna would ask.</p>
<p>“You know why.” Hermione snaps harshly.</p>
<p>“I don’t.” Luna’s slightly confused voice answers.</p>
<p>“You need to see to read and write Luna.”</p>
<p>“Not if you make the letters thick enough.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Let’s try it.” Luna decides quickly bursting out of bed.</p>
<p>The first time they try candle wax. Luna pours wax into letters and has Hermione feel them and learn to associate the feel and shape to the correlating letter. </p>
<p>It changes everything.</p>
<p>Soon it goes from Hermione only really spending her time with Harry and Ron to spending time with Luna and Ginny as well. They help her learn the alphabet in writing and help find different ways of creating a method that is thick enough to feel but won’t burn through paper or be obnoxiously large block lettering.</p>
<p>Her schooling goes even better after this discovery and her pursuit of higher knowledge becomes a likelihood. She wants to be a scholar, it is all she has ever wanted, but had thought it impossible before. If she could not record it, her knowledge didn’t matter to others even if she could hear and say it. She has a way now, a method she works on perfecting and her teachers are supportive of her direction.</p>
<p>It is in their last year that the others bring it up. Travel. They’d always been explorative children and young adults, they want to continue this. They want to board a ship and see the world before settling into their chosen professions. Originally, Hermione has no interest in this.</p>
<p>It would be Harry who changes her mind, it’s always Harry who can talk her into going along with their stupid ideas. Everyone assumes it is Ron, Dean even teases it’s because she is soft on Ron, but it is always Harry. His boyish easy going charm works from the very first time he asked for her help. </p>
<p>He reaches out for her and she can’t help but grab on.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be the same without you, ‘Mione.” Harry pleads and not for the first time.</p>
<p>“I want to focus on becoming a teacher, Harry.” She replies kinder then she had to Ron who had tried needling her a few minutes prior.</p>
<p>“Think of the experience! The things you could write and tell your students about! It would legitimize you to the other teachers.” Harry adds a sense of logic.</p>
<p>He finds his opening when she hesitates at that and for months will keep poking and prodding at how much it would benefit her. They don’t leave after school ends as they need to plot a course and stock up on supplies. It is a year after they finish school that they leave.</p>
<p>Eventually the final push she needs to join them comes from absence. Her father requests that she come along with him to another village to help a young girl who like her, could not see. She had been gone for a few weeks and by the time she returns, she sorely missed her friends. It isn’t even the longest she’s been away from them but it is a clear sign she’d regret not joining them.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t see Neville for months! Years! Think of how much you’d miss him.” Ron is trying his daily attempt with a new flair.</p>
<p>“I’ll go.” Hermione rolls her eyes at her friend’s antic.</p>
<p>“What! I’ve had better arguments than that.” Harry’s voice cuts into Ron’s cheers absolutely affronted. At Neville’s wounded sound Harry apologizes. “Of course she’d miss you but still.”</p>
<p>“I’d miss all of you.” Hermione admits. Usually she refrains from such open sentiments, preferring to show it through action instead, but she needs them to know.</p>
<p>“Aww!” Comes from multiple directions before she is swarmed in arms and hugs. She bursts out laughing and tries batting them away to no avail. She lets herself fall back against the weight of all them.</p>
<p>“Idiots!” She can’t stop laughing, happy with her decision. She really would miss them.</p>
<p>Her parents take her decision better than she’d expected. They are worried about her but are used to her living her own life. Her teachers, as Harry had said, are ecstatic. They believe the life experience and journey will make her credible and give her material to write about.</p>
<p>The complication comes from Luna and Ginny.</p>
<p>She’s been expecting the two of them to go with them. It was never in the plan that they wouldn’t go. When they tell everyone that they are staying behind, they are all blindsided. Like with Hermione, the others start their attempts of getting them to change their minds.</p>
<p>Hermione herself doesn’t understand why they aren’t going until one afternoon a few weeks before their departure. The group is in a clearing in the forest that they frequent. It is going to be their final adventure out in the forests together as they will be too busy preparing to all meet up again. She laid away from everyone just resting after the long hike it took to get here when she hears Luna and Ginny’s soft voices. They’re trading tender affections like they’ve all heard Neville and Hannah trade. It clicks with a clarity she is embarrassed took her so long. She spends nearly as much time with Luna and Ginny as she does Harry and Ron and she hadn’t a clue.</p>
<p>“You absolute asses.” Hermione scoffs at the two.</p>
<p>“I did say Sappho was my favorite.” Luna’s tinkling laugh filters over to Hermione.</p>
<p>“You could have said something!” Hermione protests.</p>
<p>“We’ve been together for over a year.” Ginny says. “If none of you figured it out by now you had no hope.” She adds bemused.</p>
<p>“Asses.” Hermione mutters. A creep of red climbs her neck in embarrassment, she really should have seen it. “You two are perfect together.” Hermione admits.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Luna kisses her cheek happily.</p>
<p>On the day of their departure, Luna and Ginny hug them all for a long moment. Ginny warns her brothers to be safe and not do anything stupid.</p>
<p>“I’ll miss you the most.” Luna hugs her tighter then she ever has.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re supposed to have a favorite.” Hermione laughs in the other woman’s ear.</p>
<p>“The water will protect you.” Luna declares with such steel that Hermione can’t question it. Luna tucks a lock of her hair behind her ear before stepping away.</p>
<p>“Go on you lot, I expect gifts when you return.” Ginny sends them away. Her voice chokes up but she is eager to move them along. Ginny and Luna remain behind as the ship leaves harbor, ready to start their lives together.</p>
<p>They board the Deathly Hallow under the command of Captain Lockhart and leave their homes.</p>
<p>They will never see it again.</p>
<p>The first few weeks wreak havoc on Hermione. She is constantly sick, easily the worst out of the group of her friends. The crew are seasoned sailors and have little issue with their stomachs like them. She has issues acclimating to the sway of the ship and keeping her balance as well as the change in diet. Slowly, she acclimates.</p>
<p>The scent of fish and sea water is always present. It floods her senses until all she can smell is salt. Her quarters which she shares with her friends smell of wet wood and dirty feet. They slowly learn how to help with the ship. Everyone finds a different way to pitch in and help. It is hard work but she’s never been happier in her life. She knows the sentiment is shared amongst her friends as they’d never laughed more. The sense of adventure and wonder of what they’d discover drives them forward every day.</p>
<p>The day it happens had been like any other. </p>
<p>Captain Lockhart tells them tall tales they all had to bite their tongues over. Jokes pass between them, often at the expense of their captain, and the monotonous efforts of daily life aboard a ship continues on.</p>
<p>When they first hear it, it is as if the entire crew stops moving. She too, is a prisoner of her own body. Arrested at the first note. Voices so beautiful it grasps onto a person’s very being and holds them hostage. Begs them to listen, to hear their pain.</p>
<p>Loneliness is the only thing she can hear. A sadness so deep she couldn’t find the bottom so long as she lived.</p>
<p>That, however, is not what the rest of the crew hears. Maybe they heard the same melancholy lyrics as she had and interpreted it differently. Disregarded it.</p>
<p>
  <b>“Let this madness end.”</b>
  <br/>
  <b>“Set us free.”</b>
</p>
<p>It has been taken to be an invitation rather than a shout to the wind. A plea to any higher force to cut the chains that bind these women to their suffering.</p>
<p>At once everyone comes to life, they snap into action as if it’s one shared thought, to reach the voices. Captain Lockhart shouts manic orders, the ship taking a hard turn that thrusts Hermione into the railing. The song continues, growing louder and stronger the closer they approach. The storm that lay ahead is so interwoven into the voices that the thunder signals the next verse.</p>
<p>“What are we doing?” Hermione shouts at Harry who hasn’t moved away from her yet. After Captain Lockhart’s first shout, Ron had rocketed to do as he said.</p>
<p>“Helping them!” Harry replies simply.</p>
<p>“We can’t go straight into a storm for them!” Hermione argues as the wind picks up dangerously. The water batters against her, now covering the ship in a new coating of rain.</p>
<p>“What storm?” Harry asks confusedly.</p>
<p>“The storm we’re in the bloody middle of!” Hermione yells back frantically. The ship is violently rocking side to side. The thunder closer, nearly overhead. The voices eerily fill the gaps between the shouts and groans of stressed wood.</p>
<p>“There’s no storm ‘Mione, don’t worry.” Harry tries to reassure her.</p>
<p>“Harry please!” She begs him to see it, to feel it. A crash explodes nearby sending up a new array of shouts.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back, I have to help!” Harry barely explains before shooting off to help.</p>
<p>“Harry!” She shouts uselessly at him. The storm is brutalizing their ship and no one is stopping it. No one is turning it around or preparing for a storm. All she can hear is the rain slapping against the ship and thunder, so much thunder, and those echoing lyrics.</p>
<p>She is the only one who can see the storm and hadn’t the first clue how to save them.</p>
<p>With the most violent lurch yet, the spell is broken. The song stops, the voices quiet. The thunder storm continues to beat down onto them with no remorse. With shouts and screams they all become aware of their impending doom. The groaning of stressed wood becomes cracks of breaking wood. They crash against something and it causes the entire ship to shake knocking Hermione to the floor. It’s tearing itself apart she realizes. The ship is breaking and there is nothing any of them can do.</p>
<p>A loud crack sounds near her and she hears Harry screaming her name. She stands as best she can on the drowning ship and half crawls half runs towards Harry.</p>
<p>“Hermione stop!” He yells frantically and she freezes. “There’s a divide between us, you need to jump!” He shouts quickly. His voice stands out against the screams of terror and the destruction of their ship. She can hear him so clearly it is as if he were the only one there. The rest of the crew’s voices faded as did the rest of the noise.</p>
<p>“I can’t jump Harry.” Hermione’s voice tremors. She doesn’t know when to jump, how far it is, where he is exactly, or if she can make it. She can’t make the jump.</p>
<p>“Yes you can! I’ll catch you, I swear it. Just run towards my voice and jump when I say.” Harry assures her. She can’t make the jump. It is impossible, she will fall to her death. “Trust me.” He begs.</p>
<p>He is the one standing there, he’s always been there for her. He is able to stand against a storm and demand her life in return. She has always trusted him. She’ll have to do it one more time. She takes a few hasty steps back and runs. She runs towards his encouragements and for once in her life, prays. If there is any higher power in this world she begs them to deliver her to safety. To protect her friends who she knew not of their fate.</p>
<p>“Jump!” Harry calls out and so she jumps.</p>
<p>She falls through the air towards him. She doesn’t know how far it is before, during, or after the jump. It feels like a moment, it feels like a year. Suspended in a directed free fall with only a hope and a friend. Flying against the wall of rain, both with and against the chaotic winds. He reaches out for her and she can’t help but grab on.</p>
<p>“Told you I’d catch you.” He cheekily comments. Hand clasped around her forearm, tight and unrelenting. She feels herself exhale in stark relief. She made it.</p>
<p>It is as he begins to pull her up that another crack shoots through the air. This time it is behind Harry, another splitting of the ship that rocks the ship and tosses its crew around. Harry is knocked back, away from Hermione. She feels his grip loosen as he falls away, torn apart. She desperately tries grabbing onto his shirt, his hands, the ledge, anything to keep from falling. It is to no avail. As she feels her fingertips graze over his, both unable to keep their hold, she knows she is going to fall.</p>
<p>The free fall is longer and it is shorter. A plummet to unknown danger, one that is certainly her death. She can hear Harry urgently screaming her name. It is a deep sorrowful sound. As broken as their grasp on one another. </p>
<p>When she hits the water, it is as if she slaps into stone. The current wastes no time in tossing her around worse than even onboard. Trapping her underneath the water and slamming her against rubble. Her head is slammed against something hard, so hard it feels as if it snapped her skull in half before she blessedly loses consciousness.</p>
<p>She can hear the singing return before the blackness overtakes her. It is a pitiful, mourning sound. A song of guilt and apology.</p>
<p>She is lost in a blackness.</p>
