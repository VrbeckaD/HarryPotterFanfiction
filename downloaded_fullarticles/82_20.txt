<p>                                                                                          A New World</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry had just woken up in a new world. He was currently 17. He remembered everything that happened in the world he originated from. Voldemort had killed Ron Weasley, Luna Lovegood, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Fred Weasley, George Weasley, Bill Weasley, Charlie Weasley, his girlfriend Ginny Weasley, Nymphadora Tonks, Remus Lupin, his transfiguration teacher Professor McGonagall, Severus Snape, Arthur Weasley, Molly Weasley Albus Dumbledore, and Hagrid,  He was forced to see Voldemort kill all of them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was close to all of them. Ron, Fred, Neville, Fred, George, Bill, and Charlie were like brothers to him. Luna, Tonks, and Hermione were like sisters for him. Remus and Hagrid were like uncles for him. Dumbledore was a grandfather figure for him while Professor McGonagall was like a grandmother figure. Severus and Arthur were father figures for him. Molly was a mother figure for him. And Ginny Weasley was the love of his life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After they were all dead, Voldemort not only took over the Wizarding World in Britain but then all the Wizarding Worlds. And eventually all of the muggle-areas. He ruled the entire world. Harry had run away. A year after Voldemort took over the world, Fate gave Harry a choice to go to a different world. Harry wanted to overthrow Voldemort but Fate unfortunately told him that wasn’t possible. It was a very hard choice for Harry but in the end, he wanted to leave his world. While Harry would no longer in his original world, Harry was deeply traumatized. For a moment, Harry thought about committing suicide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry found himself in a medium-sized town. There was no place for Harry to stay. It was currently night-time. Harry found a spot on the road and decided to sleep there. When Harry layed on the spot he was on, it took a while for him to fall asleep but, after a while, he fell asleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Harry fell asleep, he started to have flashbacks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Flashback </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> “You’re a fool Harry Potter,” Voldemort said coldly. “And you will see me kill everyone you care about. Right after that, he casted the killing curse on every person he kidnapped. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Right then, Harry’s pupils turned scarlet red for a few seconds and turned back to normal. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After that, nothing happened in Harry’s sleep. </p>
