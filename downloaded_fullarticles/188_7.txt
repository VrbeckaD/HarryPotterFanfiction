    <p>CHAPTER 1<br/>September 1<br/>"He's covered in blood ! Why is he always covered in blood ?!" Ginny said as Harry entered the Great Hall and sat down at the Gryffindor table."Mate , you just missed the sorting " Ron said as he stuffed more food in his mouth.<br/>"Oh and Harry ,Muggle Studies is going to be mandatory from this year. And also ..." Hermione stopped speaking abruptly and ,"Harry , HARRY?".<br/>"Umm .. yeah 'Mione I'm sorry what were you saying?"<br/>"Harry, are you alright ?"Hermione asked with genuine concern.<br/>"Yeah,mate, we haven't seen you since you left us on the train." Ron said.<br/>"It's Malfoy, I think he is up to something."Harry said as he started eating the food he had piled up in his plate.<br/>"Oh Harry this is the first time since our first year that we can enjoy school without being preoccupied. Think about how much the two of you can concentrate on your studies."Hermione said with her face beaming at the mention of school work which made Ron groan " Come on , Hermione we still haven't even got our schedule. "Ron rolled his eyes."And mate, when is ferret not up to something ?"<br/>"But honestly Harry his father was imprisoned for life just 2 months ago. I really don't think he is scheming . And look at the bright side, without You-know-who we can finally relax." Hermione said with a  smile and Harry decided to let this go for now.<br/>"As you say ,'Moine" , Harry shrugged. The three best  friends ate their food and left for Gryffindor.<br/>________________</p>
<p>"Draco, where have you been ? Here Theo's holding a seat for you." Pansy said, indicating the empty chair next to Theo.Draco just shrugged and sat next to the shorter boy."Pans , I had things to do."<br/>" Oh yeah , Potter walked in moments ago with blood on his nose. Are you telling me you had nothing to do with that?" Blaise said with a knowing look on his face.<br/>"Blaise, drop it. Anyways , what did I miss?"<br/>"Well, the sorting ceremony ,10 new Slytherins and Ravenclaws, 9 Puffs and I think 12 Gryffindors." Theo filled Draco in about the new Slytherins while Draco pretended to listen to him nodding here and there.<br/>"And who is taking defense this year?"  he asked, faking interest.<br/>"The same professor from third year. The werewolf. " Pansy said, lowering her voice a little bit. Draco didn't notice the subtle change and just shrugged. "You have nothing to say about that ?" Blaise inquired.<br/>" The werewolf guy never really got under my skin , besides he was level-headed for a Gryffindor." The three Slytherins nodded in agreement " But the old man did give us a big shock  though " Theo said with a serious look on his face.<br/>"And what would that be ?" Draco asked, bored.<br/>"Draco , from this year Muggle Studies will be compulsory for all students." <br/>"What !?! But they can't do that ! Pans if this is some kind of joke then I swear to Salazar I will end you." Draco looked at his three best friends incredulously. <br/>"Draco we wouldn't joke about something like this." Theo's reassurance did absolutely nothing to calm him down and Blaise asked, "what are you gonna do about it now ?"<br/>"Draco, maybe this will help us with the matters we were discussing on the train" Pansy reasoned and Blaise nodded in agreement. "Okay, what am I missing here ?" Theo asked. Blaise and Pansy told him that the three of them had discussed leaving the Gryffindors alone and also stop using racist words like mudblood. Draco half listened to the recap of their previous conversation as he watched Theo agree with their sentiments. The four Slytherins decided by the end of the feast that it's best to leave the golden trio alone and also reevaluate their own beliefs.</p>
