I show not your face but your's heart desire." Remus whispered as he watched James move to stand before the mirror. James smiled as he moved to stand before mirror, he expected to see the House Cup in his arm along with Lily Evans on his other.</p><p>"Prongs?"</p><p>"Severus." James whispered as he dropped to his knees, his hand reaching out almost like rubbing someone cheek. "Ohh severus." James whispered.

"Moony?"</p><p>"Sirius who are you talking too?" Remus asked. Sirius head snapped to the left to see Remus still in his same position before snapping back to the mirror. The mirror Remus was now standing beside the mirror Sirius as they held hands. They looked happy as mirror Remus turned his head to call out to someone.
