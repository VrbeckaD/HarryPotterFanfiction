    <p><em> October 31st, 1981 </em> <em><br/> </em> <em> Voldemort </em></p><p>The evening air was cool, but he did not feel the breeze against his face. Before him lay the cottage, stripped at last of its protective enchantments by one those within had believed a friend. Of such great use had that friendship proven in the end, though not to the Potters. For the Potters, it would be their end.</p><p>He raised his hand; at the gesture, the gate in the hedge swung open. Inside the stacked stone house, the lights were still burning, and a single jack-o-lantern rested on the stoop. As he tread noiselessly up the gravel walk, his feet hardly seemed to touch the ground. The cloak billowing around his shoulders could have rendered him a ghost, and it was like a ghost that he paused but a moment at the front door.</p><p>Quicker than a thought, his wand was between his slender fingers, the polished yew as deadly as its master. The lock sprang with less than a touch, and the door creaked open. To the side, the stairs - the child was in a nursery on the second floor. He would end the boy, and in so doing, end the only one with the power to oppose him. Before he could mount the first step, however, he found his way blocked.</p><p>“Lily!”</p><p>A man had appeared before him, running from the living room. He was tall and gangly, with a shock of untidy black hair and round spectacles.</p><p>“Take Harry and go!” James Potter continued, shouting up the stairwell. “It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off -”</p><p>Potter raised his fists as though he might land a blow, but the yew was quicker. A brilliant green light lit up the entry hall, and the man fell dead to the floor; fool that he was, he had not even drawn his wand. The Dark Lord barely spared him another glance as he ascended the staircase; it was always a shame to end the life of a Pureblood, but Potter had sealed his fate when he chose to marry the Mudblood woman.</p><p>At the top of the stairs was the nursery. The door was ajar, and sure enough, as he pushed it wide, there stood the red-headed mother bent over the crib. At his approach, she spun around wildly, shielding the crib with her arms.</p><p>“Stand aside, you silly girl,” Voldemort hissed, displeased at having to address one so beneath him.</p><p>“Not Harry, please no - take me, kill me instead!”</p><p>In the end, it was only the boy who mattered; the boy must be destroyed at any cost. Still, killing the woman struck a chord of dis-ease through him for reasons he could not place.</p><p>“This is my last warning,” said Voldemort, striding forward.</p><p>Lily Potter did not move, even as she trembled. Her emerald eyes were brimming with unshed tears. “Not Harry! Please, have mercy... Have mercy... Please - I'll do anything...”</p><p>He did not have time for this. Raising his wand once more, the same verdant light flooded the nursery, and Lily Potter collapsed, as dead as her husband. At last, nothing stood between him and the child.</p><p>Inside the crib was nestled a baby boy, scarcely more than a year of age. The babe had the same dark hair as the father, and the same green eyes as the mother. There could be no doubt that this was the brat of which the prophecy had spoken.</p><p>For the third time, Voldemort lifted his wand. The Killing Curse, when it came, flashed like lightning before his eyes.</p><p>Fortune chose that moment to conspire against him, for the green light did not seem to take. Instead, it filled the room, growing brighter and brighter until he was forced to turn away from it.</p><p>There was an explosion; around him, he was dimly aware of the roof caving in, but it was nothing compared to what was happening inside his chest. He felt as though he were being rent into pieces. The pain was unbearable, like nothing he had ever experienced before. And then, for a long while, everything went black.</p><p>When he came back to himself, he was a man no longer. Rather, he was shreds of consciousness, barely a shade, less than the meanest ghost. Voldemort hovered near where the cottage rafters once had been; in his incorporeal state, he could see plainly that two walls had been ripped away by the blast, the whole corner of the dwelling blown to smithereens. The debris, of course, had entirely missed the crib. Even now, its tiny occupant was being scooped up by a bumbling giant of a man to be taken to safety.</p><p>If Voldemort had been able to vent his frustration, he would have. The boy lived, it seemed, and his body had been destroyed instead, what was left of it lying broken upon the floorboards. There was a perplexing magic at play, one he did not understand.</p><p>Better to leave while he was able, for no doubt the Aurors would soon arrive. There were dark corners of the world where he could hide himself, until such time as one of his faithful Death Eaters came to restore him to body. In the meanwhile, his horcruxes would sustain him; that secret remained safe. And the very moment he returned to power, he swore to it that Harry Potter would die.</p><hr/><p><em>December 25th, 1981 <br/> </em> <em>Vidocq</em></p><p>It was Christmas Day, and he was spending it at the cheapest inn money could buy. Vidocq paced the dirty floor in mounting agitation, his wand clutched tight in one hand and a glass of firewhisky in the other.</p><p>His trial the day before had gone as well as he could have hoped - he was free, after all, and not sharing Gisquet’s dismal fate in Azkaban Prison. Still, there remained an injustice that cut like a knife; namely, that while he had been made to wither away in the Conciergerie for months before his case was tried, that damned convict, Jean Valjean, had walked out of court back in March, a free man.</p><p>And what rankled worse than that, worse than having the entire wizarding government of France fawn over an old jailbird, was the knowledge that Javert yet lived; Javert, who had made it his personal mission to ensure that Vidocq would never advance among the Aurors; Javert, who would string him up as soon as look at him; Javert, who had taken Vidocq’s new-found power as Gisquet’s lieutenant and ripped it away, leaving him with nothing.</p><p>Pausing in front of the small iron stove, Vidocq took a deep swig of the firewhisky as he sought to control himself. True to its name, the drink seared his throat and cleared his head. Much as he might wish to find the Auror and make him suffer, it was too great a risk. Vidocq had regained his liberty by claiming the effects of the Imperius Curse; if he were caught seeking his rightful vengeance, the court would know at once he was a liar.</p><p>Perhaps the wisest course of action was to quit Paris for a time. He could travel North and disappear. Javert was going nowhere, and when everyone had put the war behind them, Vidocq could return, to take what was his. The city of London held a certain appeal, and his English was passable.</p><p>Tugging the bell-pull, Vidocq waited impatiently near the door. A maid came quickly, and when she knocked, Vidocq admitted her with his most charming smile.</p><p>“I was wondering, Mademoiselle, if you might be able to tell me where to buy a train ticket...”</p><hr/><p><em>January 27th, 1982 <br/> </em> <em>Javert</em></p><p>“It is quite impossible, Monsieur,” said the Inspecteur.</p><p>He was standing in Chabouillet’s office, or more properly, Chabouillet’s new office. It had come about the month prior that the man was appointed Préfet de Préfecture for good, a title which he had held temporarily ever since Henri Gisquet was consigned to life imprisonment for high treason. As such, the once-Secrétaire had taken up Gisquet’s old room, supplanting the leather desk chair with his own. Otherwise, the name on the door changed, and little else did.</p><p>“Why is it impossible, Javert?” Chabouillet asked calmly. He was seated behind his desk, hands folded on the worksurface.</p><p>“Why, I! I am hardly worthy,” Javert sputtered, surprised that his superior could not see where the trouble was. “There are other men of better record, more deserving of -”</p><p>“And what men might those be?” the Préfet interrupted, looking unfazed. “Inspecteur, there is no man or woman among the Aurors of a longer or more spotless record than your own. I have been promoted, and so in turn, someone else must be elevated to the rank of Secrétaire - I would have that man be you.”</p><p>The Auror bowed humbly at the waist. “Monsieur le Préfet, you do me a great honor to even suggest it, but you must see such a thing would be inappropriate. As your protégé, perhaps it is only natural you should wish me to advance, but my record is not so spotless as you claim. There was the case of Jean Valjean, which went unsolved for nearly a decade before -”</p><p>“Yes,” Chabouillet interjected with a faint smile. “But I think that case was rather singular in a lot of respects, don’t you?”</p><p>Javert felt himself color. It was true, his investigations rarely concluded with his telling off the entire Grand Chambre du Parlement and demanding a criminal’s release, although he had no compunctions about what he had done. His flush was only heightened by the knowledge that he now shared Valjean’s bed more nights than he did not, but Chabouillet did not know that.</p><p>“You cannot sway me on this,” said the new Préfet. “I will have you report to me as Secrétaire, and you may as well accustom yourself to the idea. You can move your things to the office down the hall at your earliest convenience.”</p><p>Bowing again, Javert murmured, “Thank you, Monsieur.” The notion still did not sit right with him - a man of his background was never meant to attain so high a station - but the thought of disputing such a matter with his superior was abhorrent.</p><p>Nodding his approval, Chabouillet drew a stack of files toward him. “As you will be vacating the position of Inspecteur, there will be opportunity for other promotions as well. I daresay I can leave that to you to oversee, can I not, Monsieur le Secrétaire?”</p><p>There was a glimmer of a challenge in the Préfet’s eyes, as though he expected Javert to continue arguing. Javert held his gaze. “Of course, Monsieur. I shall endeavor to make the right decision.”</p><p>He turned to go, but was stopped once more by the sound of Chabouillet’s voice. “Do not think I haven’t noticed, Javert.”</p><p>The Auror stiffened. “Monsieur?” he asked over his shoulder.</p><p>The faint smile had returned again to Chabouillet’s face. “Your justice is tempered more evenly of late. Whatever this change in you is, it has made you wiser. You have always been a good Auror - I think now you are exactly the man we need to lead as Secrétaire.”</p><p>Javert swallowed and inclined his head. If there were a change in him, then the blame had to be laid at the feet of Jean Valjean. This, too, Chabouillet did not know, though perhaps the man could guess. It would not take a great many deductions. Suddenly eager to be alone, Javert hastened out into the corridor.</p><p>He had been force-fed mercy, and such a thing had worked his soul as a hammer worked hot iron. What shape his relationship to law and order had assumed, the Auror tried not to think about often. He would make one decision at a time, weighing the options against an uncertain conscience, and he would have to pray that served him well enough.</p><hr/><p><em>December 8th, 1983 <br/> </em> <em>Valjean</em></p><p>“Cosette!”</p><p>Valjean poked his head out the back door of No. 55, the Rue Plumet, looking around for some sign of his daughter. Though winter’s icy grip had again claimed Paris, it did little to dissuade the girl from running around outside; indeed, Cosette loved to play in the snow. In this instance, however, it seemed she had disappeared to some other part of the house.</p><p>For a moment, Valjean’s gaze lingered on a patch of brick wall, ostensibly no different than the rest of the masonry ensconcing the garden. In truth, the patch was enchanted. A carefully-cast illusion concealed a secret tunnel, which if traversed brought one out to the street a block and a half hence.</p><p>Cosette had been fascinated by this magic, but she was not to play near it, not after she had fallen asleep inside of the tunnel the summer past. Valjean had spent several frantic hours searching for her, and had sent more than one owl to Javert at the Palais, before the girl at last wandered out groggily. No, Cosette knew better than to choose that as her hiding place. The tunnel was, her father told her, only to be used in the event of an emergency. He had not elaborated on just what sort of emergency that might be.</p><p>Ducking back inside the kitchen, Valjean turned away from the <em> salon</em>, from which issued the murmur of amiable conversation, and towards the staircase. Taking to the steps, he strained his ears for the patter of little feet; as he reached the upper level, a creak in the ceiling gave Valjean pause.</p><p>Comprehension was immediate. He passed by Cosette’s bedroom - empty, it was the first place he had checked - and Javert’s quarters, which were more often a study than a place to sleep. His own bedroom and the bath were to the right, and then at the end of the hall, above the linen closet, was a trapdoor to the attic.</p><p>Tugging once on the pull released a narrow ladder. Valjean could scarcely fit his broad shoulders through the opening at the top, but when he did, he was looking around inside of what had once been an inhabited garret. The past owner had left the furniture, draped in sheets to keep off the dust, and a few old chests and crates. Two dormer windows admitted the December sun, and playing in the middle of the floor was Cosette with her favorite doll.</p><p>Cosette looked up as her father’s head appeared over the trapdoor.</p><p>“Papa!” she exclaimed. “Is it time? Are they arrived?”</p><p>Valjean’s face broke into a smile as it so often did when he beheld his little girl. “They are indeed, my treasure. Thérèse, and her boys as well. Toussaint and Javert are keeping them company.”</p><p>“Auntie!” Cosette said with delight. “Do you think she has brought me a gift?”</p><p>Valjean laughed, taking a step down on the ladder as Cosette hurried over, doll clutched tight to her chest. “It is your birthday, I should expect she has brought you a gift. But she cannot give it to you if you are hiding up in the attic.”</p><p>He descended, and Cosette was quick to follow, brushing dust and cobwebs from her skirt.</p><p>“I wasn’t hiding, Papa,” the girl informed him. “The attic is a perfect mansion for Mademoiselle Catherine. She is excited for the party, too. See how fine her dress is?” She held up her doll for Valjean to inspect, continuing to chatter in such a vein as the pair made their way down to the <em> salon</em>.</p><p>Valjean allowed his daughter to run ahead of him, eager as she was to greet her guests. Instead of following, he leaned a moment against the wide door frame, taking in the sight of presents on the coffee table and the sound of happy laughter. Thérèse was there next to the window; when Cosette entered, she wrapped the girl up in a hug, having to bend forward only a little. Cosette was growing taller by the day, and Thérèse was not great in stature to begin with.</p><p>Beside them both stood Toussaint. She was an older, matronly woman whom Valjean had hired to help around the house. A Squib, one born without magical talent to magical parents, and having a bit of a stammer, Toussaint was a respected addition to the household. She laundered the bedsheets, de-gnomed the garden on Saturdays, and cooked the meals. For Cosette’s birthday, she had made a cake.</p><p>All that being the case, Valjean did not value Toussaint’s presence insomuch for her housekeeping, which Valjean could readily have managed on his own, as for her loyalty. She was fiercely fond of her employers, and could be counted on to set to any task without question. It was evidence of this that she had not once remarked upon Javert’s bed being rarely slept in, despite him having moved his rooms entirely to the Rue Plumet.</p><p>This last caused Valjean’s eyes to flicker to the fireplace, where the man himself sat in his favorite armchair. Javert was watching Thérèse’s three sons, who were roughhousing on the settee. His expression suggested he was not entirely certain what to do about the presence of more than one child in the house, and so he simply observed their antics with vague consternation.</p><p>The Auror must have felt Valjean’s scrutiny, for he looked up and they met eyes. Javert smiled in the way he reserved solely for his partner, lopsided and just a little shy, and Valjean found himself grinning in return. All at once, he was filled with a serene joy. Cosette was ten years of age, and the world was as it should be.</p><hr/><p><em>June 18th, 1985 <br/> </em> <em>Valjean</em></p><p>Valjean reclined on the settee, an open book resting in his lap. He had been reading, but in the summer heat, it had grown very tempting just to close his eyes and doze...</p><p>The morning’s peace was shattered by the front door flying open with bang, and his daughter’s voice calling, “Papa! Papa!” as she ran into the room.</p><p>Startled back to wakefulness, Valjean turned over his shoulder to the girl, who was positively bouncing on the balls of her feet in excitement. “What is it, dearest?” he asked, rising.</p><p>“The apple tree!” she said, pointing in the direction of the specimen Valjean knew to grow in the corner of the front yard. “It’s - Oh!” Trying to contain herself, Cosette grabbed her father’s hand. “You must come see, Papa!”</p><p>Good-naturedly, Valjean let himself be dragged towards the door, though it was still clear as mud to him what his daughter was carrying on about.</p><p>“I was sitting by the rhododendrons when I had the queerest feeling,” Cosette explained as they came out onto the front stoop. To their right was the tree in question, its leaves casting an inviting pool of shade across that part of the garden. In spring, it budded with pale pink blossoms, and in fall, it produced sour apples the size of a child’s fist.</p><p>“You know, of course, Papa, that I am to go away to school soon,” the girl went on, and Valjean quickly shoved aside the pang he felt at the reminder. “And I was thinking to myself that I shall need a wand, shan’t I? I was wondering if my own might come from the mighty oak like yours, or the ironwood like Uncle Javert’s, when it seemed to me the tree told me I could have one of its branches!”</p><p>“The tree spoke to you?” asked Valjean, working to keep the incredulity from his voice.</p><p>“Don’t be silly, Papa, trees can’t talk,” Cosette laughed. “It was just a feeling. But then I looked up and I saw the most <em> perfect </em>branch - Oh, come, Papa, come see!”</p><p>She tugged harder on his hand, and chuckling in spite of himself, Valjean was led to the foot of the tree.</p><p>Cosette pointed up at a branch. “Just here, look.”</p><p>Stepping closer yet, Valjean could feel the press of smooth bark through his waistcoat as he craned his neck back. The branch in question was just within his reach; it was supple, with the gentlest of bows along its length. He had to admit, it looked promising.</p><p>“You have a sharp eye,” he told the girl. Cosette beamed, though her expression turned to confusion when Valjean planted a foot in the yoke made by two conjoining trunks and hoisted himself upwards.</p><p>“What’re you doing?” she asked, peering up at him.</p><p>Grunting, Valjean pushed a bough out of the way before he got a face-full of leaves and inspected the bark carefully. “A sure tell that a tree is wand-worthy will be the presence of bowtruckles - I am looking to see if there are any living here.”</p><p>In the greenish light filtering through the leaves, it was difficult to pick out the tiny creatures, but years of experience had taught Valjean the signs. A motion caught his eye, as of a stem bending in the wind, except that it was moving against the direction of the other gently swaying branches. Deftly, Valjean plucked a minute creature from its berth and clambered back down. Between his thumb and forefinger, the bowtruckle trilled in irritation, but Valjean held it gently and it eventually ceased its protest.</p><p>Back on the ground, he held it for Cosette to see. The girl leaned close in awe; the bowtruckle looked something like a walking stick, with skin of bark and arms like twigs.</p><p>“They are tree guardians,” Valjean said. “We must be respectful if we wish to cut down your branch. Run inside - you know my potions kit above the sink? Bring me back the boline and a scoop of woodlice.”</p><p>As the girl ran back toward the house, Valjean deposited the bowtruckle on the apple tree, where it stuck its tongue out at him before scurrying back up among the leaves. In no time at all, Cosette returned, carrying a measuring cup of tiny insects and a white handled knife. She handed both to her father, who climbed aloft once more.</p><p>Valjean carefully cradled the measuring cup in a bed of leaves; immediately, three bowtruckles shimmied down from the tree’s crown to greedily devour the offering. While they were distracted, Valjean took the boline and in one smooth slice, removed the applewood branch his daughter was so fond of.</p><p>Cosette clapped gleefully as Valjean jumped down into the grass.</p><p>“Papa, it is wonderful!” she cried, taking it from his hands and waving it about as though it were a wand already.</p><p>Valjean allowed himself a moment of self-pity before he stifled it again. In less than three months’ time, Cosette was going away to the Académie de Magie Beauxbatons, and though he could not have been prouder when her letter of acceptance arrived, it saddened him to know his little girl would be spending much of the year at the boarding school. Nevertheless, the happiness on her face more than made up for the ache in his chest, and as he drew her back inside, Valjean resolved that he would speak to Javert that night about what could be done to turn her branch into a proper wand.</p><p>Javert showed less reluctance to the idea than Valjean had anticipated.</p><p>“So long as she knows it may not choose her,” the Auror said bracingly. “Custom wands are a tricky business that way.”</p><p>“She seems quite confident of it,” Valjean replied, “but I will remind her.”</p><p>Nodding, Javert told him, “It is running on time for me to meet with my contacts in the Ministry of Magic anyhow. I shall request leave from Chabouillet, and we can travel to London. There is a wandmaker there of quality - if anyone can craft Cosette a suitable instrument, it is he.”</p><p>So it was decided that the three would travel to London. Toussaint carefully packed their suitcases for the week-long journey; she would see to the house in their absence. The Préfet was all too happy to give Javert the week to handle the Préfecture’s international affairs, and thusly by the end of June, Cosette stood staring wide-eyed at the hustle and bustle of London’s own Diagon Alley.</p><p>“Keep an eye on your purse,” Javert muttered. “Crowds like these breed pickpockets.”</p><p>Valjean did not reply. The babble of unfamiliar accents surrounded him, and his halting, unpracticed speech made him stand out in a way he never did in Paris. Even Cosette spoke English with better grace, having learned some of it in her Muggle schooling. Everywhere he looked, witches and wizards were buying, selling, and bargaining on the mercantile high street. Just beside them was a display of animals, including a live, golden toad the size of a cauldron.</p><p>“Papa, can we look at the books?” Cosette asked, pointing down the street to a large shop. The sign above it was emblazoned with two quills and the name, <em> Flourish and Blotts</em>. In the window were stacks upon stacks of volumes, available in every conceivable size and color.</p><p>Valjean smiled, some of his nerves dissipating at the promise of a bookstore. “Later, my dear,” he said. “First, we must find Ollivanders.”</p><p>Pulling a dog-eared letter from inside his coat, Javert squinted at the writing. Under his breath, he muttered, “The South end...” and then more loudly, “We need to go to the left.” With that, the Auror took hold of Cosette’s hand, and drew her in the direction he indicated.</p><p>Pushing through the crowds was less trying than Valjean had feared. It was early yet in the summer, and so the stores were not beset by all the students of Hogwarts trying to purchase their school things. They passed an apothecary, an ice cream parlor, and places to find robes, brooms, sweets... The number of options made Valjean’s head swim.</p><p>At long last, Javert came to a stop in front of a narrow, unassuming building. Peeling gold letters over the door proclaimed <em> Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands Since 382 B.C. </em> In the window, a simple elm rod lay on a dusty purple cushion. That part of the street was very quiet, and Valjean felt a prickling along his arms as the hairs stood on end.</p><p>“This is the place?” he asked.</p><p>“It certainly seems to be,” the Auror said. “Though I must say I expected something grander.”</p><p>“It is mysterious,” Cosette declared. “They make wands here, Papa?”</p><p>Valjean pulled open the front door, and a little bell tinkled inside. “Let us go in and ask, shall we?”</p><p>The interior of the shop was as dusty as the window display. There was no furniture, except for a spindly chair in the corner. Otherwise, every available inch was occupied by floor to ceiling stacks of long, thin boxes. For a few minutes, all was silent. Just as Valjean was about to suggest the proprietor was not in, however, an old man came out of the stacks as suddenly as if he had Apparated. He seemed to take the measure of his visitors, pale eyes lingering especially on Cosette.</p><p><em> “Good day,” </em> he said in English. His voice was so soft, one had almost to strain to hear it. <em> “You gentlemen have the look of wizards, but I do not believe I have had the honor of your patronage before. What may I do for you?” </em></p><p>Javert cleared his throat. <em> “It is true we have not met, sir,” </em> he replied. His speech was almost unaccented, and Valjean felt certain that was why, at least in part, Chabouillet was willing to let his subordinate handle meetings with foreign authorities. <em> “But it is also true we have corresponded. You would not have cause to remember, but several years ago, I sent you an owl. My name is Javert, of -” </em></p><p>“Ah, yes!” the proprietor exclaimed, switching to French immediately. “I remember quite well - such a fascinating letter it was. Monsieur Javert, a pleasure to have you in my shop at last.” Turning to Valjean, he bowed and added, “Garrick Ollivander, at your service.”</p><p>Valjean breathed an inward sigh of relief that he would not have to look the fool tripping over the harsh consonants of the English language. “Jean Valjean,” he introduced himself. “And my daughter, Cosette.”</p><p>Cosette curtsied, uncharacteristically shy.</p><p>Ollivander gave Cosette another appraising look. “I daresay your daughter is approaching school age. Could it be that you are seeking a wand for her? If so, you have made the right choice, traveling all the way to London. My family’s wands are the best in the business, a claim I can make with all due modesty.”</p><p>Inclining his head, Valjean said, “Monsieur, it is as you have guessed. However, we have a request to make beyond your usual services.”</p><p>Ollivander clasped his hands in front of him and said intently, “By all means, let us hear it.”</p><p>Valjean put a hand on Cosette’s shoulder. “Why don’t you tell him?” he murmured.</p><p>Approaching the wandmaker, Cosette brought forth the branch from the garden at the Rue Plumet. She thrust it into Ollivander’s hands, all traces of shyness disappearing as she asked, “Can you make me a wand out of this, Monsieur?”</p><p>Ollivander’s face lit up. “Well, well, a custom order - that is a challenge I have not enjoyed in several years. And you know, the last man who tried it wanted one of ash - not suited to him at all, not at all.”</p><p>“Can you do it?” Javert asked curtly.</p><p>“Let me see now,” Ollivander hummed, examining the branch carefully. “Smooth and supple. This is a fine piece of applewood. Wherever did you get it?”</p><p>“From the tree in our garden,” Cosette answered promptly. “It wanted me to take it - and there were bowtruckles! - and Papa says that even though it is my branch, it might not want to be my wand. Is that true?” She said all this in one long breath, but Ollivander seemed unperturbed.</p><p>“That is always a risk with a specialty piece. The wand chooses the wizard, and until it is made there is no saying for certain how it will choose. However...” He withdrew a measuring tape and took a few notes, before again looking over the branch. “I think applewood will favor you, Mademoiselle.”</p><p>“And if it doesn’t?” Javert interjected. “Are we to pay you for your labor and still leave empty-handed if the wand does not partner with her?”</p><p>Though it was Javert who asked, it was Valjean to whom Ollivander addressed his answer. “This is a quality piece of wand wood you have brought me. I shall not have to source the material for myself. Therefore, let us say this - I will craft the wand for the girl. If it bonds with her, you may purchase it at my usual price. If it does not, then I shall keep it to sell to another, and your daughter may purchase a different wand from me for the same amount.”</p><p>“That is fair, yes,” said Valjean.</p><p>“Now,” Ollivander hummed, kneeling so that he could measure the length of Cosette’s arms. “I think unicorn hair will be the thing, yes, and perhaps a finished length of... twelve and a half inches?” He took another measurement. “No, twelve and three-quarters.”</p><p>With a decisive nod, he rose again to his feet. “You are staying the week?” he asked. Javert tipped his head, and he continued, “Excellent. I shall have it finished by Friday. You may come at noon to pick it up.”</p><p>Cosette returned to her father’s side, a hopeful question on her lips about ice cream. Valjean replied that, yes, they could go and visit Florean’s, even as he noticed Javert exchanging words with Ollivander too quiet for him to overhear.</p><p>As they left the shop, Valjean turned to Javert and asked, “What was that about?”</p><p>“Mmm?” said the Auror. “Oh, nothing. An academic matter.”</p><p>“Ah.” Valjean said nothing further, but it was with a pensive air that he directed them back toward the ice cream parlor.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Javert</em>
</p><p>The week passed by in a blur. Javert spent most of his days at the Ministry of Magic in meeting after meeting. It was important work, but tedious, and he was always pleased to return to their rented rooms at The Leaky Cauldron to hear what adventures Valjean and Cosette had found their way into. When Friday came, he gladly made his excuses at the lunch hour and met the other two back at Ollivanders.</p><p>The dusty interior was unchanged, but the proprietor was in a great state of animation.</p><p>“Ah, Messieurs,” he said when they entered. “You are right on time. And the young lady as well, excellent.”</p><p>From behind the counter, he withdrew a narrow, pine-colored box. This he held out to Cosette, who hurried forward to claim it. She removed the lid, and at once gasped in amazement. Resting on a bed of velvet was the wand. Stripped of its bark, the applewood was snow white, and carved into the handle was a creeping vine with heart-shaped leaves.</p><p>“It is beautiful,” she whispered.</p><p>Ollivander looked pleased with himself. “Try it, Mademoiselle, and let us see what happens.”</p><p>Nervous on the girl’s behalf, Javert found himself blurting, “Do not be disappointed if it does not work. We will make certain you get one that -”</p><p>Cosette’s fingers closed around the handle and she lifted it from its place. “Oh! It’s all warm and tingly,” she said. “Is that a good thing?”</p><p>If it were possible, Ollivander’s expression turned even more smug. “It has paired perfectly,” he declared. “A fine success.”</p><p>Valjean went to Cosette’s side at once, cooing over the expert workmanship. Their mutual elation was plain to the eye, and Javert felt his chest warm. As the pair admired the design from every angle, the Auror looked to the wandmaker and motioned in the direction of the back room.</p><p>Ollivander caught his meaning. “A moment of your time, Monsieur Javert, that is all this will take,” he said.</p><p>Javert followed him into the back. When they re-emerged several minutes later, Valjean was on his feet and looking at him curiously. Javert shook his head slightly as Ollivander went to the register, and the Auror surreptitiously returned his own wand to his inside pocket.</p><p>Tearing a receipt from a pad of paper, the wandmaker said, “Seven Galleons, if you please, Monsieur.”</p><p>Valjean counted out seven of the weighty gold coins, and then, their mission concluded, Valjean and Javert exited to the street, Cosette between them.</p><p>“I should like to look around in the second-hand bookshop again, Papa,” Cosette was saying.</p><p>“Of course, dear,” Valjean replied. “We do not have to check out until four, so unless Javert minds - Javert?” he broke off in alarm, for the Auror had frozen where he stood on the high street, staring into the crowd. “Javert, are you well?”</p><p>The Auror shook himself, though he continued to scan the passersby mistrustfully. “My eyes are playing tricks,” he said, nearly growling the words. From the look on Valjean’s face, his tone was not reassuring in the slightest.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Javert went on, “Yes, we can go to the bookshop. But perhaps then we ought to check out.” With what he hoped was a neutral expression, he added, “I should like to be home sooner rather than later.”</p><p>Eyeing the street one more time, the Auror made note of a back way, narrower, that led down and around a corner; a fading sign on the wall read <em> Knockturn Alley</em>. The figure he had seen - thought he had seen - was gone. There was no need for the hammer of his pulse in his throat, though it was difficult to convince himself of that. Valjean, too, still had a worried cast to his face.</p><p>“What is it?” Valjean asked quietly as they began to walk.</p><p>“It’s nothing, Jean,” said Javert. “It is as I said - I was seeing things.”</p><p>He must have been. It was the only reasonable explanation; anything else was too coincidental. And yet, Javert was still glad to check out of their rooms early, not quite able to shake the feeling that for an instant, he had seen the face of Vidocq staring back at him through the crowd.</p><hr/><p><em>September 1st, 1985 <br/> </em> <em>Valjean</em></p><p>The view of the Pyrenees was lovely, there was no denying that. Valjean stood in the midst of the expansive lawn, watching something that was not a bird circle high above the mountain peaks. At his back was the château which was Beauxbatons; doubtless Cosette was by now well into her tour of the school with those who would become her classmates.</p><p>Valjean sighed. He missed her already, and he had not even left the grounds. Around him, formal gardens flourished in what by rights should have been rocky, inhospitable soil, magic making up for what Mother Nature did not provide. The flowerbeds were lushly cultivated, and Valjean knew how much care must go into their maintenance. Some plants he recognized on sight, but others were rarer things, or were outright fantastical. It pleased him to know the school had an appreciation for horticulture, for Cosette did so love their garden.</p><p><em> Cosette... </em> he thought forlornly.</p><p>Valjean’s musings were interrupted by a shadow behind him. He turned, just as Javert went to lay his hand on the crook of Valjean’s arm.</p><p>“Her luggage has all been taken care of,” the Auror said. “And they will sit for lunch when they have finished their tour. We should go and get lunch ourselves - it is drawing on noon.”</p><p>“Lunch, yes.” Valjean looked again into the distance. Along the winding path was an elaborate golden fountain, but he did not see it. “Do you think she will be happy here?”</p><p>The hand on his arm squeezed briefly. “She will love it,” Javert promised. “Just wait until you get the first owl - you’ll see. She will shower praise on everyone and everything. The school is just as impressive as I remember.”</p><p>A small smile curved Valjean’s lips at that. He had almost forgotten that his partner had once called that place home, too. Perhaps it would not be so bad to leave Cosette there.</p><p>“Madame Maxime is a worthy headmistress,” the Auror continued. “Cosette will learn well.” He gave Valjean a knowing look. “And it is not so very long as all that until the winter holiday.”</p><p>“You are right, as always,” Valjean replied. “I shall have to adjust, that is all.”</p><p>“We could stay another night in the village, if you wish,” Javert suggested. “The lavender fields are to your liking, I can tell.”</p><p>Valjean’s smile turned a touch wry at that. “And if Cosette should send a letter in the morning?”</p><p>Javert laughed. “Then it shall arrive sooner in the village than in Paris, yes. You still do not miss a trick.”</p><p>Valjean gently removed his arm from Javert’s grip, twining their fingers together instead.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said.</p><hr/><p>

  <em> My classes continue to progress well. Charms is very interesting, but I find Transfiguration curious. We are learning to turn snails into teapots, and I am not yet certain what sort of practical application this possesses; if we were to rid the garden of snails in such a way, we would wind up with far too many teapots for our family to ever need. Perhaps if we needed a single teapot only... But then, where would one get the snail? It is a conundrum. </em>

A mottling of purple bruises spread out from his temple, and it was against these that Valjean was dabbing a cotton cloth. The Auror hissed again as the cloth brushed an especially tender spot.</p><p>“Are you certain that’s Murtlap Essence you have on there?” Javert grimaced.</p><p>“Quite certain,” said Valjean. “It is the bruises making it hurt. Won’t you say what happened?”</p><p>The Auror let out a slow breath. “I suppose, though in truth it is my pride which smarts the most. There was a dragon smuggler - I was tailing him, when he ducked into an old warehouse and caught me by surprise.”</p><p>Valjean made a sympathetic noise as the bruises disappeared little by little under his ministrations. “A dragon smuggler, you say?”</p><p>“Mmm. We confiscated three juvenile Welsh Greens. They’ll be transferred tomorrow to the appropriate preserve, but that is not my division.”</p><p>“You must be more careful,” Valjean murmured, bending forward to plant a kiss on the Auror’s forehead. “I love you too much to give you up because some smuggler decided to throw you into a wall.”</p><p>Javert snorted. “I have a few scrapes, I am not on my deathbed,” he said back, but he turned himself around on his knees until he could properly fit his lips to his Valjean’s. Valjean hummed, cradling the Auror’s unbruised cheek in his palm.</p><p>What began as a sweet, chaste gesture took on a different gravity when Javert rested his hand lightly on the inside of Valjean’s thigh.</p><p>A thrill ran down Valjean’s spine. His mouth opened against his partner’s, an invitation which Javert returned, until a guilty thought caused him to pause.</p><p>“Javert,” he admonished, pulling back by a hair’s breadth. “It is the middle of the afternoon - Toussaint could walk in with Cosette at any minute -”</p><p>Javert tilted his head up, catching Valjean’s mouth again, just once, before he got to his feet. “Save it for later, then,” he said, not quite smirking.</p><p>Valjean felt his face warm, but he held the Auror’s gaze as the man deliberately backed out of the room.</p><p>He could still feel the heat of Javert’s hand on his thigh.</p><hr/><p><em>August 17th, 1988 <br/> </em> <em>Cosette</em></p><p>Cosette trailed happily after her father, looking at the open-air stalls with a keen sensibility. Her fourth year at Beauxbatons was soon to be starting, and there were a number of items she was after. Not least of these was a new wardrobe; she had grown a full head taller since the previous summer, and the skirt of her uniform was barely seemly where it rested above her knee.</p><p>Around her was a vibrant marketplace. Its entry concealed at what was to all appearances the end of an alleyway, the market was a venue where wizards from all over the world could peddle their wares in Paris. There were stands offering strange fruits, magical timepieces, and any number of baubles and trinkets. Beyond the stands were rows of shops; they would visit those later.</p><p>Cosette paused, looking over a selection of potion ingredients that ranged from the commonplace to the bizarre. Ahead of her, her father had stopped to talk to a bookseller he often visited. There would be a new volume in their library that night, Cosette was sure of it. Several stalls behind her was Javert, browsing through moonometers, though he was not actually looking at them; his eyes watched the street. In another life, Cosette might have found the man intimidating, but things being what they were, she was grateful for his vigilance. There was nothing to fear in a crowd with him in it.</p><p>An oddity among the caterpillars and aconite flowers attracted Cosette’s attention. Inside a small wooden box were three egg-shaped globes, smoky in color but glowing red in the center. She reached out wonderingly.</p><p>“Ah, Mademoiselle, methinks you too young to be needin’ one of those,” said a grizzled little witch, appearing from behind the wooden stand.</p><p>Cosette quickly withdrew her hand. “Oh! Apologies, Madame - what are they?”</p><p>“Ashwinder eggs - very useful in love potions,” the witch explained, giving the girl a saucy wink.</p><p>Blushing, Cosette was about to respond when a commotion down the street distracted her. She whirled around to see Javert reach out and grab a man’s arm. They were arguing, and then the man pulled away, running in Cosette’s direction. Cosette saw Javert draw his wand - her Uncle was an Auror, so that man must have broken the law! - and then the man was reaching into his robes for a wand of his own.</p><p>Cosette acted without thinking. Her applewood was in her hand before she knew it, and she leveled it at the oncoming figure.</p><p>“<em>I</em><em>mpedimenta</em>,” she said clearly, and watched with satisfaction as the man ran straight into the invisible barrier in the air. Winded, he fell over backwards.</p><p>Cosette’s burst of adrenaline was overcome by alarm as the man sat up. In her thoughtlessness, she would have turned his attention to herself, and him a criminal! Who knew what he might do? But by now, people were staring, and Javert had moved quicker than the eye could follow to where the man had fallen.</p><p>There was a hand on Cosette’s shoulder, and she looked up. It was her father, staring wide-eyed between her and the scene.</p><p>“Cosette,” he said, pulling her close. “What on earth -?”</p><p>“Well,” Javert rumbled, looking down at the man at his feet. The man’s shoulders were slumped in defeat, and he stared at the Auror’s boots even as Javert flashed the badge of his station. “I would have caught you myself, had not my niece been quicker on the draw.”</p><p>The look he gave Cosette at that was a mixture of pride and censure, and Cosette fidgeted. Realizing she still held her wand, she hastily stuffed it back into her pocket.</p><p>“Let’s see it, then,” Javert went on. “I know perfectly well you took something off of that stand you did not pay for, there is no point in denying it.”</p><p>The man on the ground bit his lip. Then, with a painstaking slowness, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a package of chocolate frogs.</p><p>“They were for my son,” the man muttered. “Can’t afford them anymore, not since Élise passed. Isn’t it wrong for a boy to never have a treat, even just once in a while?”</p><p>A look passed between her father and uncle that Cosette did not understand. At last, it was her uncle who lowered his gaze.</p><p>“Return the chocolates to the vendor,” Javert said. “And then be on your way.”</p><p>The man stood up uncertainly, brushing the dirt from his trousers. “I can go, Monsieur?” he asked.</p><p>“You may,” Javert assented, “but do not let me catch you engaged in such activities again, you understand?”</p><p>The man nodded vigorously and began to edge around them. That might have been the end of it, had not Cosette, who was thinking very hard about something, then spoken up.</p><p>“Monsieur?” she asked of the departing stranger. The man stopped warily. Digging in her pocket, Cosette pulled out a handful of bronze Knuts. “Please buy the chocolates for your son, I should like him to have them.”</p><p>Surprise flickered across the man’s face, and then the wariness returned. He said nothing, but he looked a moment at Javert.</p><p>Cosette turned to her uncle. “It is alright, isn’t it?” she asked.</p><p>Javert looked rather as though he meant to say something else, but what he actually said was, “It is your allowance, do what you will with it.”</p><p>Cosette smiled broadly, and pressed the coins into the disbelieving man’s hand. He disappeared in the direction of the sweets vendor, and Cosette felt her father pull her into one of his bear hugs.</p><p>“You scared me half to death,” he said. “But that was well done, my dear.”</p><p>Beside them, Javert shook his head. “You mustn’t interfere in my work like that. He might have hurt you!” Then he hesitated, and under his breath, added, “But yes - it was a thing very well done.”</p><hr/><p><em>November 10th, 1989 <br/> </em> <em>Valjean</em></p><p><em> Dear Papa, </em> <em><br/> </em> <em> This year is just flying by! It will soon be the winter holiday, and I shall see you again. I miss you - how are things on the Rue Plumet? Marius says his grandfather is taking him on a skiing trip over winter break. I think it sounds terribly exciting, but Marius would rather stay at school. His friend Enjolras has had a falling-out with his family and is not going home for Christmas. Several of the others are staying with him, ‘in solidarity’, they called it, and Marius was hoping to join them. Sweet, isn’t he? </em></p><p>
  <em> And I must tell you, Papa! It seems incredible I should already be thinking of such things, but I had a meeting with Monsieur Beaulieu today regarding my career path! He said he is very pleased by my marks, and wondered if I knew already what I wished to do after school. I confess, I had not thought about it in the slightest, but the moment he asked, I got to thinking. Joly and Combeferre aspire to be Healers, but I do not think I would enjoy that job. Marius is thinking of law, and Feuilly will probably be a craftsman like his father. Then there is Muschettia - I do not know what she plans to do, but I am certain it will be spectacular! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> All that said, nothing I was thinking of felt quite right, and I could tell Monsieur Beaulieu was starting to wonder if something was wrong. That is when I thought of you, Papa, and of Uncle Javert. He keeps us both safe, and the other good people of Paris. I told Monsieur Beaulieu I should like to be an Auror. He told me I must do very well on my BUSE examinations first, so I suppose I will have a lot of studying to do come spring. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Do let me know what you think, won’t you? </em>
</p><p><em> Love always, </em> <em><br/> </em> <em> Cosette </em></p><p>Javert set the letter down on the table in front of Valjean when he had read it.</p><p>“Is this why you’ve not eaten today?” he asked.</p><p>Valjean exhaled heavily and looked aside, out the window. Trust Javert to always cut to the heart of a matter.</p><p>“It might be,” he said evasively.</p><p>Rather than reply, Javert merely took the chair opposite and looked at him. Internally, Valjean winced. If Javert were not pressing for answers, if he was sitting and waiting patiently for Valjean to speak, then he had worried him. He did not want to worry Javert.</p><p>“It is just...” Valjean began. “It is a dangerous field. She could be hurt, or worse.”</p><p>Javert blinked. “Oh.” His fingers twitched where they rested on the tabletop. “I thought perhaps... you did not approve of her choice.”</p><p>Valjean looked up at that; Javert did not quite meet his eyes.</p><p>“She wants to protect people,” Valjean said softly. “As you do.” Javert started. “But you cannot deny that it is dangerous - I worry every morning when you leave the house that something will happen.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>“Of course I do.” Valjean looked at him helplessly. “I love you, Javert, how could I not?”</p><p>A flustered array of emotions crossed the Auror’s face all at once. For a moment, Valjean thought his partner might finally give voice to the sentiment he knew he returned, but as they usually did, the words stuck in Javert’s throat. It was endearing, really, the power their shared affection still had to render him speechless.</p><p>“You are a sentimental old man,” Javert said instead, shaking his head. “Cosette will be fine. If she has the skills to be recruited, well, then, she knows how to handle herself. And besides, she has to get through examinations, first.”</p><p>Valjean’s eyes crinkled in appreciation. “Yes,” he said. “Thank you, Javert.”</p><hr/><p><em>July 7th, 1990 <br/> </em> <em>Valjean</em></p><p>Of course Cosette excelled at her examinations. Valjean read again over the results his daughter had thrust so eagerly into his hands.</p><p><em> Brevet Universel de Sorcellerie Élémentaire</em>, said the heading on the score card. <em> Universal Degree of Elementary Sorcery</em>. Below, each course was listed along with the grade; Cosette had earned an “O” for “Outstanding” in every subject.</p><p>Lowering the page, Valjean glowed with paternal delight. “You’ve done incredibly, my treasure.”</p><p>Cosette hugged him around the middle. She was properly a young lady, encroaching on him in height, and would be seventeen in December. “Father, I cannot believe it! I can take all the ASPIC-level classes I need to be an Auror now!”</p><p>Valjean’s smile slipped for a moment. “Cosette, dear,” he said carefully. “Are you certain there is no other -”</p><p>“Well, well,” said Javert, entering from across the <em> salon</em>. “I hear congratulations are in order.”</p><p>“Thank you, Uncle,” Cosette grinned, spinning to embrace him as well. Javert appeared less confounded by this than he once would have been, and patted her on the shoulder.</p><p>“An ‘Outstanding’ in every class, wasn’t it?” asked Javert, raising an eyebrow at Valjean.</p><p>Mutely, Valjean nodded and extended the score card, which had arrived by owl that morning.</p><p>“This is very good,” said the Auror as he read it over. “Indeed, I could not have done better myself.”</p><p>Javert’s pride was obvious whenever it was brought up that Cosette wished to follow in his footsteps, and Valjean could not begrudge his partner that, nor could he begrudge Cosette her talents, or her altruism.</p><p>Even so, the smile on his daughter’s face only did a little to ease the fear he felt at the thought of the dangerous path she wished to tread, and the knowledge that it would bring her closer to his own past than he had ever wanted for her.</p><hr/><p><em>October 15th, 1990 <br/> </em> <em>Valjean</em></p><p>Valjean gasped and tucked his head against Javert’s shoulder where he sat beside him on the bench.</p><p>“Tell me when it’s over,” he implored.</p><p>“This pass, or the entire game?” asked Javert, his amusement evident.</p><p>They were seated among the screaming spectators watching Beauxbatons’ second Quidditch game of the season. It was the first year Cosette had made the team; she played Keeper, a position to which she was well-suited in Javert’s opinion. Valjean was inclined to agree, but as he had sat through most of the first match with his eyes shut, it was harder for him to say. At the rate the second match was progressing, he was likely to spend it much the same way.</p><p>“She is just so high <em> up</em>,” Valjean whined against the Auror’s coat. “What if she should <em> fall?</em>” This was followed by, “What just happened?” as a cheer went up from the crowd.</p><p>His question was answered for him by the boy providing commentary, whose name was Bossuet or some such; dimly, Valjean recognized the name as belonging to one of Cosette’s friends.</p><p>Magically amplified, Bossuet's voice drifted across the stadium. “That’s Chaser Fleur Delacour with the Quaffle, scoring another ten points for Bellefeuille. The standing is thirty points Bellefeuille, twenty points Ombrélune.”</p><p>“They’re coming back Cosette’s way,” Javert informed him, and Valjean risked a peek at the sky.</p><p>Above them, Cosette hovered on her broomstick in front of the three goal posts, her green Quidditch robes fluttering in the wind. A trio of Chasers from the opposing team, dressed in silver, bore down on her. Flying forward as fast as their brooms would take them, the three tossed the Quaffle back and forth. At the last second, the center wizard pulled back, flinging the ball at the nearest hoop.</p><p>Cosette had watched their approach impassively. As soon as the ball was released, however, she shot straight up and knocked it away with the tail of her broom. The green-clad half of the stadium erupted in cheers again. Valjean joined in, even as his stomach lurched.</p><p>“Another slick save by Keeper Cosette Valjean. She is in top form today, I do hope Marius is in the crowd...” came Bossuet's voice, narrating.</p><p>Valjean groaned and rubbed his forehead.</p><p>“She’s got more skill on a broom than you have in your little finger,” Javert observed, still squinting up into the sky.</p><p>“It wouldn’t take much,” said Valjean. The last time he had been on a broom, he had been stiff as a board the entire flight and had toppled off onto the ground upon re-entry. He could fly to save his life, but he much preferred to Apparate.</p><p>The game went on another two hours; in the glaring autumn sunlight, both Seekers had difficulty spotting the Snitch. Ultimately, it was Ombrélune who ended the game, but Bellefeuille had put up a strong offense. By Valjean’s calculations, the team was still in the running for the Cup.</p><p>Cosette found them in the stands after she had changed.</p><p>“Father, Uncle,” she greeted them, kissing them each once on the cheek. “Thank you for coming!”</p><p>A younger girl with long, silver hair passed them by, and Cosette called, “Oh, Fleur, your pass to Phillippe was perfect, nicely done!”</p><p>Fleur turned around. There was something inhumanly beautiful in her features, and it was plain from those around them that many of the students were enamored with her, boys and girls alike. Embroidered on the breast of her robes was a leaf, the symbol of Bellefeuille house, above which was printed “Delacour” in fine letters.</p><p>“Cosette, thank you,” came the short reply. “I was just on my way to meet Mother and Gabrielle, excuse me.”</p><p>Javert watched Mlle. Delacour disappear with a slight frown on his face. “Rather forthright, isn’t she?”</p><p>“No more than you are, Uncle,” Cosette laughed. “But come, let us go and -”</p><p>The sound of a nervous cough interrupted whatever she had been about to say.</p><p>Valjean beheld a young man with tawny brown hair scuffing his feet, a bouquet of roses tucked under one arm.</p><p>“Cosette,” he said. “Hello. I-I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt...”</p><p>The girl laughed again, a tinkling sound like bells. “That’s alright. Father, Uncle, I do not believe you have met Marius yet. Marius, this is my family.”</p><p>Marius bowed formally, but anxiously. “Pleased to meet you, Messieurs,” he stammered. “Marius Pontmercy, at your service.” He looked back at Cosette. “I had best be going - Courfeyrac will be looking for me - but I w-wanted to give you these.” So saying, he shoved the bouquet into her arms and ran off into the crowd, his face flushing beet red.</p><p>“Isn’t that kind of him?” said Cosette, smelling the fresh-cut flowers. “Of course, I must tell him he needn’t give me a bouquet after every match - roses are expensive!”</p><p>Javert huffed. “A Pureblood family like that, he can afford it.”</p><p>“Oh no,” Cosette said seriously, shaking her head. “He won’t take so much as a Sickle from his grandfather. Isn’t that noble of him? He says things like how isn’t it unfair that so few wizards hold so much of the wealth and power? And he’s right, you know...”</p><p>The political talk fell on Valjean’s deaf ears. The moment that bashful boy had pushed a dozen roses on his daughter, it had suddenly occurred to Valjean that beyond whatever choice she might make of occupation, there were yet other ways fate could take Cosette from him.</p><hr/><p><em>September 1st, 1991 <br/> </em> <em>Valjean</em></p><p>It was not yet mid-morning, and Valjean was seated at the breakfast table with the newspaper and a cup of coffee. Cosette had been picked up by carriage to begin her Terminale year at Beauxbatons. It pleased him to know that after ten more months, Cosette would finally be moved back in at home. He could see her every day.</p><p>At least, he could until she got married. Her and the boy Pontmercy were, it seemed, courting in truth. Their romance had blossomed over the summer intersession, and Valjean’s dismay had gradually mellowed into a disgruntled resignation, made easier to bear by the knowledge that the boy was respectful, if a bit prone to nervousness, and seemed to be in no hurry to spirit his daughter away from him.</p><p>Chasing the thought from his mind, Valjean turned to the next page of the paper, <em> Le Oracle Parisien</em>. Printed underneath an ad for doxycide was a black and white photograph of a castle, the banners on the ramparts moving silently in the breeze.</p><p><em> Boy Who Lives Starts at Hogwarts</em>, read the headline. Curious, Valjean looked down at the article beneath.</p><p><em> SEPT. 1 1991 </em> <em><br/> </em> <em> Ten years after the fall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Harry Potter, known popularly as “The Boy Who Lived,” is due to begin his magical education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Potter, age 11, has lived with Muggle family since the death of his parents ten years ago. He enters the school now under the  tutelage of acclaimed Headmaster Albus P. W. B. Dumbledore, who is noted for his alchemical work in partnership with Beauxbatons alumnus, Nicholas Flamel. Like most schools of magic, Hogwarts is Unplottable, and its precise location is unknown. It is believed, however, to be located somewhere in the Scottish Highlands. Whatever comes next for young Harry Potter, we at </em> Le Oracle Parisien <em> wish him all the best. </em></p><p>Valjean set the paper down thoughtfully. How strange it must be, he reflected, to have the eyes of the world when one was still so very young.</p><hr/><p><em>June 20th, 1992 <br/> </em> <em>Valjean</em></p><p>The commencement ceremony was set to be held on the Beauxbatons grounds in the center of the formal garden. A great white pavilion had been erected for the occasion, under which was arranged an orderly sea of slender birch chairs, all facing the dias at the front. Valjean sat with Javert and Toussaint somewhere in the middle; the rest of the seats were taken by other families, but the dias was as of yet empty.</p><p>A hush fell over the gathering and in unison, all stood for the entrance of Madame Maxime, Headmistress of Beauxbatons. She was a witch of outstanding stature, perhaps eleven feet in height, though the pavilion had obviously been designed with her in mind; there was ample room for her to tower comfortably above the assembly. Mme. Maxime was an olive skinned woman, with a hooked nose and thick, black hair drawn back in a tight bun. Taken altogether, she had an elegant yet severe beauty, and Valjean felt an immediate respect he usually associated with the nunnery.</p><p>Mme. Maxime strode calmly down the center aisle to the front of the room, where she took up a position left of the dias.</p><p>“Today we are gathered,” she began, “to honor the accomplishments of a fine generation of young people. Each student who mounts this stage has completed their seven years of magical education, and is ready to pursue a career in the discipline of their choice. On behalf of the faculty of the Académie de Magie Beauxbatons, I would ask fortune to smile upon these students, as they enter into the next chapter of their lives.”</p><p>There was a polite round of applause, followed by an upwelling of music from the right; lifting his head, Valjean beheld a single wood nymph playing upon a cello carved from silvery wood. The rich, lingering notes tugged at something deep in his chest. Then the processional started, and the crowd turned as one to look down the aisle.</p><p>The students had traded in their usual silk uniforms for powder blue dress robes, upon which was pinned the symbol of their house. They looked splendid as they walked in, and Valjean briefly allowed himself to wonder what it might have been like to wear a robe for such a ceremony himself. Then he caught sight of Cosette, and all traces of nostalgia vanished as for a moment, he forgot how to breathe.</p><p>She was radiant. There was no other word for it. The smile on her face was brighter than even the ample sunlight. Valjean found himself squeezing Javert’s hand, and though the Auror usually objected to such things in public, for once he did not pull away.</p><p>One at a time, the students were presented with their certificates. Valjean’s eyes were riveted to his daughter throughout, and it was likely only the solid weight of Javert’s hand in his that kept him from bursting into tears. He needed to go to her, to congratulate her, to remind himself that she was real, that she was not going to leave him.</p><p>His nerves were wrecked by the time it was over, and Valjean barely even heard Mme. Maxime’s closing remarks. When at last all were dismissed, Cosette ran to him. For a moment, the weight of Valjean’s fears disappeared under her embrace; his little girl was grown, but she cared for him still.</p><p>Then Cosette took a step back. “I did well on all my ASPIC’s,” she said, looking earnestly between Valjean and Javert. “Do you think the Aurors will accept my application?”</p><p>Javert returned her look seriously. “The training program is very intensive,” he said. “You have a good chance, but even if they do not accept your results, you will be a very employable young witch - you should be proud.”</p><p>“Yes,” Valjean agreed hoarsely. “You’ve done so well. And for what it is worth...” He took a deep breath. “I hope they do take you on. You know I worry, but... if this is what you want, if this is how you wish to help others, then I want it for you as well.”</p><p>Cosette beamed and reached out to hug him again. Valjean hugged her back, striving to ignore the knot of tension in his stomach. Then Toussaint interrupted, waiting to impart her congratulations on the new graduate, and Valjean let her go.</p><p>Whatever Javert’s words to the contrary, he knew Cosette would succeed in whatever she set her mind to. She was skilled and intelligent, and she would be an Auror if that was what she wished. Only time would tell whether that wish would be his undoing.</p><hr/><p><em>August 3rd, 1993 <br/> </em> <em>Javert</em></p><p>The yellow rays of morning light fell across the page of a report, illuminating the small, tight script which was Inspecteur Coste’s. Javert had received it the night before, delivered by a harried-looking owl; the initial excitement he experienced at its arrival had dissolved into bitter disappointment upon learning that the Patron-Minette had managed once again to evade justice. The gang’s continuing freedom was a sore spot - how was anyone to take magical law enforcement seriously if they could not even apprehend a handful of lowlife wizards?</p><p>Across the table sat Valjean, reading the newspaper. It had become custom between them, Valjean with a cup of coffee in one hand, the daily edition of <em> Le Oracle Parisien </em>in the other, and Javert with his reports. Soon he would have to leave for work, but privately the Auror relished those quiet moments just after dawn.  </p><p>The newsprint rustled as Valjean unfolded the next section. Javert did not glance up, concentrating on the means by which Montparnasse had eluded Coste’s forces, and so he missed Valjean’s almost imperceptible flinch, the words on the page draining the color from his cheeks. Then Valjean laid the paper flat on the table, and Javert lifted his head.</p><p>“Is something the matter?” he asked, frowning.</p><p>Valjean bit his lip and looked away toward the wall. “There is... a wanted poster in today’s <em> Oracle</em>,” he said.</p><p>Javert felt all expression slide from his face. “Ah.”</p><p>“You know of it, I presume.”</p><p>Slowly, the Auror nodded. “We were warned,” he said. “Not that Britain expects it to involve us - from what I was told, Black’s eye is fixed on the Potter boy. I suppose it was only a matter of time until our media caught wind of the debacle.”</p><p>“You weren’t going to tell me.” Valjean cocked his head as though it were a question, but it came out a statement.</p><p>Javert shifted in his chair. “I thought it might... distress you,” he replied. “What does the paper say of it?”</p><p>Valjean flipped the paper open to a page mostly taken up by a large black and white photograph; it depicted a snarling wizard with sunken features and dirty, matted hair. Amidst the other tattoos emblazoned across his bare chest were the numbers ᛈᛉ-390; for a fraction of a second, Valjean’s hand hovered above a similar spot on his own chest, before he hastily raised his fingers to adjust a few curls of his hair. Javert cursed the editors at <em> Le Oracle. </em>What right had they to drag bad memories out into the light?</p><p>Valjean read aloud, his voice carefully devoid of inflection. “The infamous Dark wizard, Sirius Black, made his name anew when he became the second man ever to escape Azkaban Prison. The break-out is believed to have occurred in the late hours of July thirtieth. There were no signs as to how Black escaped, and British authorities remain baffled. Black was imprisoned for the murder of twelve Muggles and a wizard, following the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”</p><p>He looked up at Javert. “That is all it says, besides a warning to the general populace.”</p><p>The Auror nodded. “They did not mention you by name?”</p><p>“No.” Valjean hesitated. “Will they catch him, do you think?”</p><p>Javert snorted. “I doubt it,” he said. “Not immediately, at any rate.”</p><p>“Is it wrong if I should be glad of that?” The question was spoken softly, and Valjean’s eyes were downcast.</p><p>Javert bit back an uncharitable response; the idea struck him that it was not the moment for his usual abrasive remarks. Reaching across the table to take Valjean’s hand, he said quietly, “Black did kill thirteen people, Jean.”</p><p>“I know,” Valjean murmured. “But even so...” Then he looked up. “Cosette cannot know.”</p><p>Javert frowned. “She is an officer now, I do not think I can keep it from her.”</p><p>Valjean shook his head vehemently. “Not Black,” he said. “Me. She will ask, when she hears that Black is the second to escape, and she cannot... she <em> cannot </em>know that I...” He shuddered. “I do not want her to associate me with that place.”</p><p>“You were pardoned,” argued Javert. “What does it matter?”</p><p>“It matters,” Valjean insisted. “And what about you? Do you want her to know that you arrested me, and her mother? If she starts digging through old records, who knows what she will find?”</p><p>There was a long silence. “Very well,” Javert said eventually. “I will see what I can do.”</p><p>Valjean did not reply, but the gratitude in his expression spoke volumes. For his part, Javert felt like he at last understood some of his partner’s apprehension. Cosette had long ago wormed her way into his grudging heart, and the prospect of her thinking less of him was unbearable. It was just unfortunate that her new position as Auror gave her access to exactly the sort of records that would reveal the worst of him.</p><hr/><p><em>November 1st, 1994 <br/> </em> <em>Cosette</em></p><p>“It is a shame they did not reinstate it sooner.” Cosette stood at the hall mirror adjusting her navy uniform where it sat under her curls. “I might have put my own name forward.”</p><p>“You most certainly would not have,” her father replied, stepping out of the kitchen. “People die in that tournament, Cosette. That they have brought it back at all is...”</p><p>The stairs creaked as Javert descended from his bedroom. “Really, Jean,” he said. “Even with all the new regulations?”</p><p>Her father looked at the man aghast. “You cannot tell me you <em> support </em> this ludicrous competition. ‘International magical cooperation’ or not, a student is <em> bound </em>to be hurt, you mark my words -”</p><p>Javert leaned against the railing and smirked. “I am only teasing,” he said. “In truth, I believe you have the right of it. It is a barbaric sport.”</p><p>“You don’t think it sounds thrilling?” Cosette asked wistfully.</p><p>“After the year of the cockatrice mauling?” Javert shook his head. “It is spectacle. Politics. No, so far as I am concerned, the Triwizard Tournament is a waste of government time and resources.”</p><p>Cosette withdrew a letter from her pocket, smoothing over the delicate cursive script with her fingertips. “Well,” she said, “I am happy Fleur is representing Beauxbatons. I am sure she will do wonderfully.”</p><p>Her uncle pecked her father once on the cheek when he thought Cosette was not looking, though the mirror revealed more than he intended. Cosette only smiled. They were both so shy with their affections in front of her; did they perhaps think she would be mortified if they acted as other parents did?</p><p>When he turned around, Uncle Javert clapped her on the shoulder. “Well,” he said, “if Beauxbatons wins, then perhaps it is not so barbaric a sport after all.” He strode to the door, adding, “We’ll be back by seven, Jean. Tell Toussaint I can reheat my own meal.”</p><p>Cosette went to join him, and for a moment they stood upon the stoop, two Aurors on their way to the Palais de Justice. Then they Disapparated, and the garden was empty again.</p><hr/><p><em>June 18th, 1995 <br/> </em> <em>Vidocq</em></p><p>It was not Vidocq’s first choice to return to Paris. There was more news to be had in London, closer to the epicenter of the rising storm. Even so, there were rumors, portents which told him that something was coming, and these drew him inexorably back to Paris’ criminal sink.</p><p>Though over a decade had gone by since the darkness last held sway, Vidocq knew well the signs of a shadow emerging from hibernation. Agents of the Dark Lord were on the move, ever since the incident at the Quidditch World Cup. There had been disappearances, too, not enough to incite the suspicion of anyone in authority, but on occasion one here or there which spoke to Dark magic’s use.</p><p>He found himself again walking familiar streets, his head bowed and unrecognized. Time had changed him; Vidocq’s hair was now more grey than blond, and a full beard hid some of the deep lines around his mouth.</p><p>Snippets of conversation fell upon his ears. After so long abroad, it was both refreshing and strange to be surrounded entirely by French voices. What truly made him feel at home, however, were the hints of argot he overheard while traversing the back ways of the city. The language of the underground, cant of thieves and murderers alike, it was the patterns of code that let Vidocq know he had found like company. Among them he could acquire lodgings, and no-one would inquire too closely into his business. When it came time to recruit, as he was growing certain it soon would, Vidocq would be well-placed to adopt a hiring position.</p><p>No, it was not Vidocq’s first choice to return to Paris, but the more days went by, the surer he grew that it was the right one. He had wanted but one thing for fifteen years - his new wand could attest to that - and the time was drawing on when revenge would finally be his. He would be there when the sky fell, and would take his pleasure in watching the city burn.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>June 25th, 1995</em>
</p><p><em> Cosette, </em> <em><br/> </em> <em> I wish I wrote with better news. I wish I wrote to say that I had beaten the boys in the third task and brought our school eternal glory. I wish I wrote to say that I was returning to France with a thousand Galleons’ prize money and a handsome young man on my arm. I even wish I wrote to say that I lost, and that this would be the worst news I had to impart. </em></p><p>
  <em> I lost. That is to say, Harry and Cedric won, they tied for the Triwizard Cup. But then, something went wrong; I do not know the details. What I do know is this: Cedric Diggory is dead, and Harry Potter says it was You-Know-Who who killed him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I know how it sounds. It sounds like a nightmare, too terrible to be true. But You-Know-Who is alive, though the Ministry of Magic would like to pretend he is not. The witches and wizards of France cannot afford to be so lax in their response - for all our sakes, something has to be done. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You must believe me, Cosette. You have been a friend to me, only kind, never jealous as so many others are. I have written you because you are clever, and because you are an Auror. Perhaps this knowledge will do you good. I hope that it does. Above all, be safe. We are all in danger now. </em>
</p><p><em> Your friend, </em> <em><br/> </em> <em> Fleur </em></p><p>Cosette laid the letter down on her desk, frowning at it. She had already read its contents three times, but this was the first where she got through it all without fear clenching at her heart. Father did not speak of the war, and neither did her uncle. If it was true, if Voldemort were somehow alive and returned to strength, there was bound to be a second war, not only in her lifetime, but perhaps even very soon!</p><p>At that thought, her fingers gripped at the front of her robes. There was no time to be afraid; Fleur had warned her, and she had to make good on that warning while there was still a chance.</p><p>If the British Ministry was denying Voldemort’s return, it was no use going through official channels. She could only imagine what Javert, her uncle, yes, but also the Secrétaire, would say if she suggested He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was risen from the dead on such flimsy evidence as a classmate’s say-so. What, then, to do?</p><p>Biting her lip, Cosette drew towards her a fresh sheet of parchment and her blotter. With a steady hand, she addressed a letter to Marius. Marius would pass on her message, and it would invite less attention than if she wrote Enjolras directly.</p><p>Enjolras, she knew from class, was an organizer and lawyer-turned-political advocate. His aggressively pro-Muggleborn stance had always drawn sidelong glances at school, where Purebloods were traditionally expected to abjure such company. Perhaps he would have a solution, a way to act without the government’s approval.</p><p>Long after the family owl left to deliver her letter, Cosette sat up in her bedroom. Night was falling, and for the first time since she was a small child, she felt afraid of the dark.</p>
