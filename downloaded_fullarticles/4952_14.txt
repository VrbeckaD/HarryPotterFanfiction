<p>The locket was taking its toll. Because one of them was always wearing it, there was never a moment when all three of them were at peace. Well, as much peace as was possible, that is. They had been on the run searching for Horcruxes for over three weeks. They were tired and hungry as well as scared and worried about their friends and loved ones.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past six and a half years, Hermione, Harry, and Ron had become so much more than best friends. There was a bond between them that grew stronger with every challenge, fear, obstacle, laugh, tear, and conquest - and there had been many of each. But these recent weeks had taken that bond to an even stronger place.</p>
<p>The past few days had been particularly hard. The darkness, fear, jealousy, and mistrust that the locket elicited when worn had come to a head the day before when it was around Ron's neck. He had come very close to abandoning Harry and Hermione. Thank goodness, Hermione had been able to talk Ron down after she took the locket away from him. He had been quite convinced Harry and Hermione were keeping secrets from him and were mocking him behind his back. However, an hour after the locket was taken from him, he had regained his senses and apologized to his two best friends.</p>
<p>They understood. They had all been battling their own fears, unhappiness, and mistrust when wearing the cursed jewelry. After Ron apologized, Harry tucked the locket away in Hermione's bag and none of them had worn it since. They knew they couldn't lose it, but they also knew they would not succeed with their mission if one of them was always victim to its manipulations. All three of them needed to have their wits about them to get through this war alive.</p>
<p>Today had been a much better day. Despite their hunger, they had laughed during their breakfast of stale bread and water while remembering better times at Hogwarts. It had been a day of reminiscing and bonding, or of re-bonding so to speak. With the locket safely put away, they felt closer to each other than they had since they escaped the Death Eaters three weeks before.</p>
<p>It was evening, while they were sitting around the fire outside the tent, when Hermione noticed Harry was deep in thought. He was staring into the flames with somber eyes. Normally this would not have been something so unusual with everything going on, but today had been a fun day and Hermione didn't want it to end.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Harry?"</p>
<p>His bespectacled eyes shot to hers, but he paused before speaking. A hand moved nervously to his messy, black hair and he shrugged, "nothing important, just thinking about stuff that it doesn‚Äôt do any good to dwell on." He ran his palm down his face before picking up some branches next to him and throwing them into the fire. He offered her a smile that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes.</p>
<p>Ron, who was sitting on Hermione‚Äôs other side, was watching Harry with a look of contemplation. After a minute he responded, "Harry, I think it's best we talk about the demons in our heads. We might not be wearing the locket anymore, but it's close and I think we can all agree it's still affecting us."</p>
<p>Harry thought for a moment before shrugging and responding, ‚ÄúOkay. I keep thinking about all the things I'll never see or do if we lose this fight even though I know it doesn't do any good to dwell on them."</p>
<p>No one said anything but all three had similar expressions as their own regrets overcame them.</p>
<p>Hermione had spent more than a few hours over the past several weeks contemplating that same issue. When this happened, and she felt herself getting sucked into lost hope or despair, she would will herself to stop and focus on the task at hand. But maybe Ron was right. Maybe talking would help. "Okay, then. Let's make a list and talk about them", she agreed, smiling softly at her beloved ginger haired friend.</p>
<p>Ron rolled his eyes, "Hermione, another list? You just can‚Äôt resist, can you?" He was shaking his head in mock dismay and she swatted him with a piece of string she had been mindlessly fiddling with. He threw his hands up in mock surrender, causing her to laugh. Harry was chuckling on her other side, happy for the distraction from his troubling thoughts.</p>
<p>She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear as she looked from Ron to Harry. These were her boys and she loved them with all her heart, despite their teasing.</p>
<p>She stood up and walked around the fire to stretch her legs a little. "You never know, maybe we can do or see some of the things or places that we are thinking about while on the run. I mean, why not? I believe, and I mean I <em>truly</em> believe, in my heart and mind that Harry will defeat He Who Must Not Be Named. And there is no question that task is the most important thing. However, there is no harm in checking some experiences off our lists along the way, as long as it doesn't distract us from what we need to be doing."</p>
<p>She sat back down between them and picked up her bag. The boys gave each other an understanding look of defeat when Hermione grabbed parchment, ink, and quill. The amusement and love in their eyes could not be mistaken. How many times had they seen her do this very same thing over the years?</p>
<p>"So, I'll go first", she offered. "I fear I'll never see my parents again and therefore they'll never remember me or know that they have a daughter." She wrote her concern down on the list and then turned to Harry. He noticed she had said it very quickly, almost as if saying it fast would make it less painful.</p>
<p>Harry‚Äôs shoulders fell as he started to speak. "Hermione, this is depressing and I.."</p>
<p>She reached out and touched his arm. "No, I think this will help. Getting it out and not burying it inside!" She paused and with a heartfelt plea, her warm chocolate eyes met his green. "Please?"</p>
<p>She looked from Harry to Ron and back again. Ron and Harry exchanged looks and then Harry shrugged, "Okay, Hermione." He couldn't say no to her. Not today, not when he felt so close to her. "I guess I'll go next", he continued. "I fear I'll never play quidditch again. I'll never see anything outside of the UK. I'll never see Ginny again, much less kiss her again or kiss any woman, for that matter. I'll never have a real family. I'll never become an Auror. I'll never be able to go back to the Dursley's and prove to them that I made it in the world despite their prejudice and hatred." He tossed another stick into the fire.</p>
<p>They all stared at the burning wood as they contemplated what Harry had said. Hermione started to write his words on her parchment.</p>
<p>Ron leaned behind Hermione and reached out to pat Harry on the shoulder. He gave his friend a nod of reassurance and then pulled his hand away. He began picking at the twig in his other hand as he watched the dancing flames before them. After a moment he added, quietly, "I fear I'll never see my whole family at the Burrow again. I'll never get to tell Mum and Dad how much I love them. I'll never travel anywhere or see anything or really do anything. I‚Äôve always existed in the shadow of my brothers. I wanted to.. I don‚Äôt know... be really great at something, in my own right.‚Äù He sighed before adding softly, ‚ÄúI'll never have a family and kids...much less ever have sex." He mumbled the last word and his ears turned pink as his face flushed. All three of them turned a little pink, for that matter.</p>
<p>Hermione watched him for a moment before nodding, ‚ÄúYeah, I fear I'll never be kissed by a boy who loves me, I mean <em>really</em> kissed. I'll never have a family, or children. I'll never get the chance to do something with my life that really means anything, if we fail, I mean. I'll never taste champagne, much less ever get drunk or be reckless." She paused, "not that I want to be reckless, really... I just want to do something fun for the hell of it and forget the consequences. Ever since I found out I was a witch, I have tried so hard to be perfect in this world and tried not to make any mistakes. Just once, I'd like to say 'to hell with it‚Ä¶ I'm going to let myself do something crazy and to hell with what other people think.'"</p>
<p>Letting out a puff of frustration, Hermione suddenly felt warm. She pulled off her sweater and tossed it into her bag. She proceeded to stretch and arched her back to help relieve some of the building tension in her body, not noticing the eyes of her two best friends drinking her in. She was wearing a light-yellow spaghetti strap tank top that hugged her curves and emphasized her chest far more than she was aware. Her skin was flawless and had a golden glow in the reflection of the campfire.</p>
<p>No one said anything for a minute. Ron couldn‚Äôt take his eyes off her. She was so beautiful. This was not the first time he thought so. It was just the first time he felt his breath be taken away by it.</p>
<p>Hermione felt his stare and caught him watching her. Uncomfortable, she looked the other way to find Harry had penetrating eyes on her as well. A flush of heat washed over her face and a jolt zapped her gut. She swallowed as the unfamiliar feeling took hold. She pulled her knees up to her chest and wrapped her arms around her legs. She chewed on her bottom lip as she looked back at the flames. Her heart beat fast as unfamiliar thoughts began to race through her mind. Thoughts about her two best friends...her two handsome, masculine best friends. Thoughts she had never let herself indulge in.</p>
<p>Harry could sense that Hermione was becoming uncomfortable and he felt a little guilty about getting caught staring at her like that. He couldn't help it though. It hit him like a bludger how beautiful she really was, and all her talk about being reckless was something he could completely relate to. He felt the same. He looked over at Ron and saw that his friend‚Äôs face was pink, and his hands were fidgety. Harry could only guess that Ron was seeing her the same way he was. Maybe even more as he suspected that Ron and Hermione had uncharted feelings for each other.</p>
<p>Unable to shake off her thoughts, Hermione stood up and grabbed her bag, wanting to get away so she could clear her head. She had her back to them and looked over her right shoulder as she said, "It's getting late. I'm gonna turn in. I'll take second watch if you guys don't mind." She disappeared into the tent leaving Ron and Harry staring after her.</p>
<p>Neither boy said anything, but the air was thick with a new tension. Harry took a deep breath and looked at Ron who nervously smiled back at him.</p>
<p>"Wow". Harry whispered.</p>
<p>"Yeah", Ron replied. "I think I need a cold shower", he added with a smirk.</p>
<p>That night it took Hermione a while to fall asleep. She wasn't the least bit tired but something had just happened. Something just changed. She was overcome by the avalanche of what she was suddenly feeling. Harry was her friend! He was like a brother! How could she have even let thoughts like these flash into her mind?! Ron...well, that was different. After all, she loved Ron. And had for a while. She had thought she would like to marry him one day, but tonight, for the first time, she had desires toward <em>both</em> her friends. <em>What is wrong with me?</em> <em>Merlin, you need to get a grip! </em>She took a deep cleansing breath and let it out slowly as she curled into a ball, trying to rein in her whirling thoughts and emotions.¬†</p>
<p>Perhaps the locket was messing with her? She wasn't wearing it but it was still close by. But this didn't seem like the locket‚Äôs doing. These weren't thoughts of the boys only using her or not caring about her. These were thoughts of passion. Maybe it was because she had been living with them for over three weeks. Maybe the close confines of their lives were drawing her to them in a new way. Maybe she was finally understanding what Lavender and Pavarti were always going on about. It‚Äôs not that Hermione had never felt desire or thought about sex. It‚Äôs just, she could always push it to the back of her mind and focus on more prevalent and pressing pursuits. Like her grades and helping Harry. But this! This was something different. She couldn‚Äôt shake where her mind was leading her.</p>
<p>Their eyes. Their expressions. They both had looked at her with an intensity that spoke to something very primal within herself. But how could that be? She knew they didn‚Äôt feel that way about her. Despite her interest in Ron, she had never sensed he returned those feelings more than fleetingly. And she knew Harry saw her as a sister. She must have been mistaken. Maybe it was that damn locket after all. She rolled to her other side and willed herself to relax.</p>
<p>Ron went inside the tent to check on her. She appeared to be sleeping so he grabbed a glass of water and went back outside to sit with Harry. They didn't say much to each other and sat thinking about the evening‚Äôs conversation.</p>
<p>Harry glanced sideways at his friend, "I know we never really discussed it, but I always thought you had sex with Lavender. I guess you didn't, based on what you said earlier."</p>
<p>Ron looked a bit uncomfortable and started fidgeting again. He was tapping his heel rapidly and looking around like he was searching for something on the ground. After a minute he picked up a stick and started to break into smaller pieces. He fed them gradually into the fire before turning to Harry. He shrugged and responded, "It wasn't for lack of trying. She was kind of a tease. She acted like she had all this experience, and I know she dated several blokes before me, but she would never let it go that far. I think she wanted me to promise to marry her. I couldn't do that. I knew she wasn't someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. She was actually quite irritating in hindsight."</p>
<p>Harry chuckled.</p>
<p>Ron gave his friend a serious look. "Harry, I know Ginny is my sister, but you did the right thing to end it with her. When this is all over, if you still love each other, then, you know, you'll be together. But life is short and if the opportunity were to present itself, I wouldn't fault you for..." He turned a little pink and looked at the sky, "well, for you know." He paused and then continued, "If some witch comes along and throws herself at you or something, I mean you ARE the chosen one."</p>
<p>Harry started to laugh, "Yeah, right! Like that'll happen." The moment was rather awkward. They had never really discussed sex before.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't stop thinking about Hermione. He needed to stop. He knew Hermione didn't feel that way about him and Ron was his best friend for Merlin's sake. And he loved Ginny! But wait. Truthfully, he really hadn't thought that much about Ginny. He thought about her a lot the first week, but this week and last she had hardly entered his mind. When he did think about her, it was about her safety and wanting to know she was okay, but he wasn't...missing her. He wasn't longing to see her and to hold her and to... He looked towards the tent and swallowed heavily. He was in trouble.</p>
<p>Hermione woke from a restless sleep at one-thirty am and found Harry sleeping in the top bunk. She stepped outside where Ron was sitting by the fire. "I got it Ron. Go to bed."</p>
<p>He turned his head and stared at her. He had been thinking about her non-stop for the past three hours. He stood awkwardly, warring with himself what to do. She was so beautiful. She had a sleepy, just woke up look on her face and he noticed her right cheek was pink from her pillow and her hair was rather a mess. In truth, he loved her wild locks.</p>
<p>Unable to resist, he walked right up to her and put his hand around her waist, pulling her to him. Before she could respond, his lips were on hers. He kissed her urgently and after a couple seconds she opened her mouth to him. With that small amount of encouragement, he wrapped both his arms around her and pulled her tightly to his chest. She reached up and tangled her fingers around his neck, allowing herself to let go and kiss him like she had always imagined. It was <em>so</em> much better than Victor Krum.</p>
<p>They quickly stepped away from each other when they heard the sound of the tent flap opening. Harry stepped out and immediately froze when he saw them pull away from each other. "Oh, sorry", he said awkwardly, turning to walk back into the tent.</p>
<p>"Harry, stop", Hermione demanded. "It's okay! Come back outside." For some reason she felt incredibly guilty. Why did she feel like she had wronged Harry? But she did.</p>
<p>Hesitantly, Harry stepped out of the tent. Hermione moved slightly away from Ron, the three of them awkward. Suddenly, Hermione realized, <em>truly</em> realized what she wanted. It hit her like an epiphany and her heart raced with nervous excitement.</p>
<p>She looked from Ron to Harry and it was so obvious what her men were thinking. They wanted her too! Throwing caution to the wind, she gripped her tank top and slowly pulled it up and over her head, leaving her in pajama bottoms and a bra.</p>
<p>Ron and Harry both froze, and Hermione felt herself getting pink with embarrassment. What if she had completely misread the situation?</p>
<p>Harry swallowed heavily, drinking her in. She looked so soft. Her skin was radiant. Her bra was lacy, and peeks of soft flesh beneath could be seen. Her nipples were hard and visible as they strained against the fabric. She had goosebumps on her skin.</p>
<p>Harry looked at Ron. Ron's eyes quickly moved from her chest to Harry's face and back again.</p>
<p>Hermione brought her hands up to cover herself, suddenly humiliated and convinced she had made a fool out of herself.</p>
<p>"Don't!" She turned towards Ron's adamant command and then swallowed as she slowly dropped her hands.</p>
<p>Ron cautiously moved towards her. His voice was shaky and raw. "Can I? ‚Ä¶ Can I touch you, Hermione?"</p>
<p>Unable to speak, she nodded. He was next to her instantly. His left hand was on her shoulder and his right one gently ghosted down her arm and then to her side. His featherlight touch was soft and warm, and it made her shiver. She closed her eyes as she felt the stroke of his fingers over her right breast. They barely touched the hardened peak of her nipple poking through the thin, lacy material of her pale pink bra.</p>
<p>She felt Harry's approach from her other side.</p>
<p>Harry's heart was racing. Unsure what to do next, he looked up at Ron for guidance. He wanted to touch her but would not do it if it would upset his best friend. Ron looked up at him and then to Hermione's left breast, silently telling Harry to touch her.</p>
<p>Hermione let out a soft moan when she felt another soft stroke, now on her left breast. The hand on her right became more aggressive, palming and massaging her. Her eyes still closed, she threw her head back as her mouth fell open with a moan of pleasure. She had never imagined having her breasts fondled could be soo arousing. She felt cool air on her newly exposed skin as the bra was unclasped. She kept her eyes closed as hands gently guided the straps down her arms to fall at her feet.</p>
<p>"You're so beautiful," Harry whispered as he leaned into her, kissing her jaw. She turned to him, willing his lips to touch hers. His mouth was on hers instantly. His tongue stroked her bottom lip and the moment she opened her mouth to his, he took control and kissed her more aggressively.</p>
<p>Her eyes remained closed as hands were all over her - stroking her breasts, her back, and her stomach. Her knees began to feel weak as unbridled need began to overcome her. She felt remiss when Harry pulled away and kissed her shoulder. She opened her eyes, meeting his beautiful green ones. "Are you okay? He whispered. "Is this...alright?</p>
<p>She could hardly speak. "More," she mewled. They didn‚Äôt hesitate. She turned to Ron as he kissed her passionately, yet less dominantly than Harry had. She felt Harry's mouth on her left breast, his tongue flicking her nipple. She felt a hand glide under her pajama bottoms ‚Äì squeezing and rubbing her behind over her knickers. Another hand moved down her front, rubbing her mound over the skimpy fabric.</p>
<p>"Lay her down," Harry demanded softly. She opened her eyes as a mattress and quilt flew from the opening of the tent to her feet. She slowly slid to the mattress as her wizards guided her to lay back, them kneeling on either side of her.</p>
<p>"You're so beautiful," Ron whispered.</p>
<p>"A Goddess," Harry concurred.</p>
<p>Hermione couldn't help the giggle that overcame her. "Not beautiful or a Goddess," she reprimanded. "I'm still the same swot I've always been."</p>
<p>Unable to keep his eyes off her delicious, bouncing breasts as she laughed, Harry replied, "Yes, you are that as well...A beautiful, Goddess of a swot."</p>
<p>"Our beautiful, Goddess of a swot," Ron whispered as he leaned down, taking a hardened peak into his mouth as his right hand began manipulating her pajama bottoms and panties down her thighs.</p>
<p>"Yes, ours," Harry agreed as he began the same manipulations on her left side, with his left hand. Within seconds she was laid out before them, gloriously naked.</p>
<p>"Merlin, Hermione! You are a vision." Ron's words came out choked. She turned to him and reached out, rubbing his chest over his t-shirt. "Take that off," she whispered.</p>
<p>She then focused on Harry and whispered the same command. Both young men were shirtless within seconds. Hermione pushed up on her elbows and smiled devilishly, looking from one eager face to the other. "Boys, if I'm naked, so are you."</p>
<p>She laid back, her eyes on her wizards and her hands on her own skin as they quickly undressed.</p>
<p>"Gods," Harry whispered as he laid down next to her. She reached out to his face. He leaned over her and kissed her.</p>
<p>She pulled back and looked into his eyes as she said earnestly, "I love you, Harry Potter." The words were whispered, but full of conviction.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed the lump in his throat as he realized he loved this witch more than anything. The acknowledgment that she was more than his best friend was practically an earth-shattering realization. He'd loved her for years, but now he understood how much he loved her, and what that meant.</p>
<p>Hermione then faced Ron to find insecurity staring at her. "Oh, Ron. I love you so much...Kiss me, Please. I need you."</p>
<p>He leaned forward, softly touching his lips to hers. "Mione, I've loved you...for so long. I've just..." His forehead crinkled, his eyes looked sad. "I didn't know how..."</p>
<p>Her warm, brown eyes were full of understanding as she she stroked his cheek. "It's okay, Ron." He quickly leaned over and gave her another soft kiss. She looked from Ron to Harry. "I love you both, with all my heart...and I want you both." Her wizards hovered over her, affection in their eyes and desire in their hands as they stroked her body.</p>
<p>Ron lay down on her right side so that Hermione was sandwiched between the two of them. She was on her back and Harry mirrored Ron on her left. Her hands began exploring them as theirs continued to explore her. She tentatively moved her hands down their torsos. Heavy breathing met her shoulders as her hands continued exploring south. They both froze when she gently stroked their erections. Unsure what to do, she looked from one to the other. They each had a look of desperation. "Tell me what to do...show me," she whispered, looking from one to the other.</p>
<p>Harry took her left hand in his and guided it up and down his length. His eyes glazed over with ecstasy as he pulled his hand away and she continued. She felt Ron take control of her right hand until she stroked him with more confidence, mirroring what Harry had instructed only seconds before.</p>
<p>It had only been a minute or two before the voice on her left groaned, "Oh Merlin, I'm gonna‚Ä¶" Hermione turned to Harry as he tensed. She felt him harden and twitch in her hand as hot liquid spurted from his cock onto her stomach.</p>
<p>He shivered as she gently pulled her hand away. She heard Ron grunt and turned to him as she felt warm liquid spray her from her right side. She gently pulled her hand from him as well. She looked down at her stomach, the slightly white tinged liquid coating both sides of her torso.</p>
<p>"I'll just‚Ä¶ just grab‚Ä¶," Harry stuttered as he went to stand. He was back a second later and waved his wand over her, cleaning her instantly. He laid back down beside her. She was still watching him as she felt Ron begin to tentatively and gently rub her between her legs.</p>
<p>"Spread your legs." Ron whispered. Hermione felt wanton as she obeyed his gentle command.</p>
<p>Harry grabbed her left leg, spreading her wider as he eased down the mattress, drinking her in. She began to feel self-conscious as his eyes studied between her legs.</p>
<p>Ron eased down and was doing the same on her right side. They were each holding a leg, spreading her wide. She was beginning to feel like she was at the medi-witch having a gyn examination. But as awkward as she felt, she realized neither of these wizards had likely seen a woman‚Äôs vagina before, except in textbooks and porn magazines.</p>
<p>She felt tentative fingers touch her, spreading her open. She moaned as she felt something, obviously a finger, gently probe into her.</p>
<p>"You're so wet, and warm," Harry whispered.</p>
<p>"Try inserting your finger, it's like a suctioning tunnel of wet heat," Ron whispered.</p>
<p>She felt one finger exit as another entered. Then she felt another enter her and start to pump in and out. "Wow, it's practically gripping me, trying to keep me inside," Harry observed with bewilderment.</p>
<p>"Uh, guys? This is...getting weird," she said apologetically.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Hermione," Harry whispered. "But, your uh...between your legs? It's amazing."</p>
<p>"I want to taste her," she heard Ron whisper. She practically jolted out of her skin with the sensation as Ron lapped at her entrance. "She tastes so good, Harry."</p>
<p>"Let me try," she heard Harry respond.</p>
<p>She was part mortified and part aroused beyond measure. She smiled to herself as the swotty part of her took pleasure in the fact that her wizards were finally taking an interest in learning something besides quidditch moves. She almost laughed with her internal dialogue but was jolted back to her senses as she felt intense, blinding pleasure. She looked down to see a head of black hair buried between her legs and she began to rock her hips with pleasure as Harry was nibbling on her hardened nub.</p>
<p>"Gods, Harry! Don't stop!" She felt him settle in more between her legs as he became more focused on her pleasure point. She shattered the instant she felt a finger slide into her at the same time. She grabbed the mattress and moaned loudly as the muscles of her pelvis contracted repeatedly with her release. She felt kisses work their way up her stomach as her breathing and heart rate began to calm. As they worked their way up her body, she arched her back in pleasure. When they got to her breasts they paused to nibble, tug, kiss and pinch her nipples.</p>
<p>"Your tits are perfect, Mione." Ron whispered.</p>
<p>Harry moaned on her skin, whispering something she couldn't understand as his voice was muffled by the mouthful he was manipulating.</p>
<p>She grabbed them both by the hair and lifted them to her face where she kissed them each soundly. They nestled down next to her and wrapped their arms over her protectively. Harry grabbed the wand behind him and waved it, pulling the blanket up and over them.</p>
<p>She let out a sigh of contentment as she stared up into the night sky.</p>
