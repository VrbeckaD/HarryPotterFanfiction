    <p align="center"> </p><p>Sirius was new to the dating scene. Actually, he had not been able to pursue any romantic encounters while he was under the care of his mother. Not only was she an outspoken homophobe, but she wanted to arrange his marriage herself. He ran away and lived at the Potter’s. They have been protecting him since.</p><p> </p><p>It was late October now, and Sirius had wanted to meet someone. He had a few months away from his banshee of a mother. Sirius sat in his room at the Potter Estate, on his phone scrolling for dating apps with his… <em> preferences </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Soon, Sirius came across an app called Grindr. He had heard of this before. It was for gay people to find other gays to date. He downloaded the app and created his account. He was ready to get this show on the road.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius was lying in bed that night, swiping left and right on people he found hot or not. That was when he came across a picture of <em> him </em> . The screen name was <em> HungryLikeTheWolf </em>. This boy seemed to catch his eye in no time, and he swiped right. He had to get to know him. That was when…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> DING </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Sirius’ phone beeped almost instantly. Showing <em> You have a match </em>. It was the boy he had become interested in just based on appearance. Though now he was on a quest to get to know the boy. He had no clue why he was so intrigued, but did he really need one?</p><p> </p><p>The boy was gorgeous. He had lovely amber eyes and tawny brown hair. He seemed to have some marks on his face. He had one single and adorable dimple which seemed to show when the boy smiled. That smile… Could knock a man out.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius swiped through the rest of the boy’s pictures and noticed some things. He had but one picture of himself, and the rest were just… A few pictures of animals, trees, nature, and even one of the Hershey’s company sign for whatever reason.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius decided to bite the bullet and just message the boy. He inhaled deeply but then just went for it.</p><p> </p><p><b>Siriuslysirius:</b> Hey there. Thanks for the like.</p><p><b>HungryLikeTheWolf:</b> Hi… yeah. No problem.</p><p><b>Siriuslysirius: </b>So… tell me about yourself?</p><p> </p><p><em> Slow down Sirius! You are gonna seem too eager if you send messages back to back like this </em>. He thought to himself, returning back to look at his phone.</p><p> </p><p><b>HungryLikeTheWolf:</b> Well… I am 18… I live with my best friend Alice right now. She kinda took me in when I became homeless.</p><p><b>SiriuslySirius:</b> She sounds amazing. It is great to have friends like that. Same thing happened with my friend James, actually. He took me in when my family disowned me.</p><p><b>HungryLikeTheWolf: </b>Let’s see… What else. Oh! I live in Brighton right now. In the same neighborhood as the Flourish and Blott’s library and bookstore. You know the one?</p><p><b>SiriuslySirius: </b>Yeah! I know the one. Actually I live about 5 minutes from there. I plan to go to the cafe next door to it in a few hours, if you want to meet up :)</p><p> </p><p><em> This is how these apps work, right? Ask to hang out almost right away? </em> Sirius was now kicking himself for asking such a creepy question! <em> God, he must think I am some creep or stalker. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> DING </em>
</p><p> </p><p><b>HungryLikeTheWolf:</b> Sure, I don’t mind. How about 4 PM?</p><p><b>SiriuslySirius:</b> Sure! See you then.</p><p> </p><p>Well that went better than he thought. He was now frantic about getting ready to look his best. Sirius ran around and pretty much jumped into the shower.</p><p> </p><p>James heard the commotion and sighed. He walked out to the bathroom door and shouted. “Oi! What are you so worked up about!”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius yelled back with a grin on his face. “I have a date!”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright. Just be careful and do not come off too strong.” James sighed.</p><p> </p><p>“No promises~” He yelled back in a coy tone. He was ready to do this.</p>
