    <p>Hermione was desperate. She had been running at full hilt for what seemed like ages. The adrenaline that had given her an added boost was fading. She could feel herself beginning to slow down. She could still hear them behind her. The voices of the death eaters were faint but she knew it wouldn't be long before they caught up with her. Without her wand she was almost helpless. Having spent nearly 11 years of her life without her magic she tried to think of a muggle way to get out of her situation. She couldn't remember the girl scout survival guide saying anything about how to survive while running for your life from a pack of depraved wizards trying to kill you.</p><p>Her head swiveled around looking for any way to lose them. She saw a faint path on her right that looked promising and without thinking made a beeline for the thick trees. It was more uphill than she thought and her pace slowed to a pathetic jog. She could feel her muscles beginning to ache. The noises behind her were becoming clearer now. Had they followed her up the path? </p><p>Half dragging herself forward she came to the end of the path and emerged in a small clearing. There was nowhere left to run. She stepped up on the large rock overlooking the edge and peered down. She swallowed at the shocking drop. Had she really climbed that far? She had no chance of survival if she jumped but she knew she couldn't go back down. </p><p>She had barely started thinking of what to do next when a man in dark robes and a black skull mask appeared. She froze. This was it. Harry was dead and now she would be too. She was oddly resigned to her fate. They had given it everything they had and in the end it just wasn't enough… Ron… Harry. She’d be joining them soon. With a deep breath she made a move towards the edge.</p><p>“Granger,” Came a familiar voice from behind the mask.She’d recognize that snivelling little weasel anywhere.</p><p>"Malfoy.” She said with as much venom as she could muster. “Congratulations, you’ve lived up to every evil expectation anyone has ever had for you. Your father must be so proud. Soon he’ll have a murderer for a son.." </p><p>“Granger, step away from that ledge. Dont be stupid. You’ve lost but you dont have to die.”</p><p>For a second Hermione’s eyes revealed their surprise at his statement but she quickly realized that it wouldn't be for her benefit if she were to live. He’d probably take her directly to Voldemort, grab some ridiculous prize and leave her to be tortured to death.</p><p>"I don't think so Malfoy. Guess you won’t be get everything you want in this God forsaken war.” Hermione screamed as she leapt over the edge of the rock. She closed her eyes and waited for the inevitable land. Her whole body tensed for death. Her last thoughts were of her Harry and Ron on that first day on the Hogwarts express. The golden trio was about to be extinct.</p>
