    <p>Scorpius stared open mouthed at the gold envelope in his hands. </p><p>‘Me? They’ve invited me?’</p><p>Albus shrugged. ‘Yeah, you and your Dad. Not sure how Ron felt about inviting your Dad, but Hermione overruled him as usual.’</p><p>‘But why?’</p><p>Albus frowned. ‘Aren’t your Dad and Hermione working together now, some dark object project?’</p><p> Scorpius grinned. 'Object project, try saying that when you've had a couple of firewhiskeys. But yeah, they’re working together to identify missing dark objects, stuff they know about but don’t know where it is, or rumours they’ve heard of other things that have been made. They don’t want another time turner incident.’ The boys grinned sheepishly at each other. ‘With Dad’s knowledge, and the Ministry’s power to search people’s homes, they’ve found loads of stuff.’</p><p>‘Yeah well that’s why then.’</p><p>‘But why me? I mean don’t get me wrong, I’m giddy with delight- the Minister- the actual Minister for Magic, and Ron Weasley, Order of Merlin first Class- have invited me to their wedding, but why?’</p><p>Albus rolled his eyes. ‘It’s not their wedding, they’re already married. It’s only a stupid renewal ceremony.’</p><p>‘But still…’</p><p>‘Well you’re a friend of the family now aren’t you? And haven’t you been round to theirs for dinner?’</p><p>‘Yes, and they’ve come to us. The Minister actually asked Dad if he was going to invite her round, and he got all embarrassed and said he hadn’t thought she would want to come…do you know if anything happened at Malfoy Manor during the war? Dad never talks about it.’</p><p>Albus shrugged. ‘I dunno. And you don’t have to keep calling her ‘The Minister’. It’s only Hermione. Does she let you call her The Minister?’</p><p>‘No, she’s told me to call her Hermione. But she IS the Minister. I can’t get used to it.' He paused. 'I’ll never understand your lack of interest in your family’s history.’</p><p>Scorpius sighed. He knew better than to push it, even if it did frustrate him sometimes (as far as he could get frustrated by Albus, which was not that far.) He was fascinated by that period of history, even more so now that he’d seen what the world could have become. From everything that he’d read (and he’d read a lot), the task that Harry, Ron and Hermione had faced had been enormous to the point of being nearly impossible, and yet they’d not only succeeded, they’d lived to tell the tale! And that was just from what he’d read. He strongly suspected that some details had been left out. None of them had ever agreed to be interviewed for them after all, and some of the books alluded to a mystery that had been covered up, possibly in an attempt to make sure that whatever Voldermort had done was never repeated. People would revere them for generations, and he was lucky enough to be in a generation where he could talk to them about it! He had so many questions. Did they know the enormity of the task when they took it on? Did they fear for their lives? Did they know what the world would be like if they failed? He longed to ask them, and wished that Albus had asked so that he could get the information from him. He had a secret ambition, not even admitted to Albus, of being the person who wrote the true, full account of that time. He could write it from the perspective of the next generation, and how it had impacted on them. He knew now, that his dad had regretted his part in the war, but it had still had an impact on his childhood. He longed to know more about his Dad’s experience, but he knew he didn’t like talking about it. But maybe if he was writing a book…</p><p>Maybe he and Rose could write it together- it would be interesting to compare the perspectives of children who had grown up with parents on opposing sides. Husband and wife writing team, he grinned to himself. They’d be formidable! Although- it was a bit strange. The more time he spent with Rose, the less he could imagine them as a couple. He didn’t like her any less- in fact he was really glad they were becoming friends, if only to have someone to talk about books and classes with, when Albus had had enough. But imagining them together, holding hands, doing more… it was a bit weird. He didn’t get that tingle when he hugged her that he got when he hugged Albus (and they boys were hugging more and more, much to his joy) so he had decided it was because he didn’t know Rose as well. But them the more time he spent with her, the further away that feeling felt, he couldn’t quite comprehend it, and thinking about it made his head hurt, all the contradictory thoughts buzzing around. He wondered dimly if his Dad would lend him the penseive….</p><p>‘Scorp?’</p><p>He jolted alert as he realised Albus had been talking to him.</p><p>‘Sorry, what were you saying?’</p><p>‘Did you see that it’s Muggle dress? Do you even have any Muggle clothes?’ He laughed.</p><p>‘I do have some!’ said Scorpius indignantly, but he knew Albus was right. The Malfoys had never had much contact with the Muggle world, and whilst Scorpius had bought some casual clothes to fit in with the other students whilst at Hogwarts, he didn’t have anything smart enough for a wedding.<br/>
A gleam entered his eyes  ‘I suppose I’ll have to go shopping. Muggle shopping! You’ll have to take me!’</p><p>‘I don’t know anything about shopping!’ Albus snorted. ‘Get Rose to take you!’</p><p>‘Well who buys your clothes?’</p><p>Albus flushed scarlet. ‘My mum’ he admitted embarrassedly. ‘Look I don’t know anything about shopping or clothes! I’m not as …groomed as you.’</p><p>It seemed to Scorpius that Albus had gone redder still. Scorpius flushed with pleasure, but was keen to put Albus out of his discomfort. </p><p>‘Why is it Muggle dress anyway? Oh because The M- Hermione’s parents are Muggles.’</p><p>‘No actually’ said Albus. ‘Well I think her parents are coming, but they already know she’s a witch, no actually it was Ron’s idea, and it’s kind of genius. Everywhere they go they get bothered by groupies and fans or whatever, and photographers from the Daily Prophet or Witch Weekly. But they’re not famous in the Muggle world. So if people think that Muggles are there, they won’t be able to harass them. And the photographers would have to use Muggle cameras, which might not even work, because a lot of Muggle technology doesn’t work where there’s a lot of magic, and who wants those weird photos where no-one moves anyway? So they’re using the Statute of Secrecy to get some privacy.’</p><p>‘That is clever. I knew Hermione was a genius of course, but that’s really smart from Ron.’</p><p>‘Yeah people really underestimate him; he’s actually smarter than you’d think. He comes up with some good stuff.’</p><p>‘Well I suppose he must be pretty creative to come up with all the ideas for the shop. And of course Rose is really smart; it can’t all come from Hermione.’</p><p>Albus scowled at this. </p><p>‘Why do you always scowl when I compliment Rose? I thought you two were getting on better now?’</p><p>‘It’s just weird, the idea of you and my cousin! If it worked out, we’d be related. That’s weird!’</p><p>‘But we’d be family! I mean you already feel like my family, but we’d be proper family! I don’t have much family, it would be nice to have a bit more.’<br/>
He deflated a bit as he always did when he thought of his mum, and the brothers and sisters he might have had had his mum been well.</p><p>He felt Albus’s eyes on him, and heard him say in a much softer tone, ‘well hey, I’m sure she’ll dance with you at the wedding, and you can get started on that.’</p><p>Scorpius’s face lit up. ‘Do you think she will? I’m actually a great dancer, my mum taught me…’</p><p>He laughed as Albus rolled his eyes affectionately at Scorpius’s excitement, allowing him to chatter on about all the dance styles he’d learnt.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>‘So aren’t you going to ask me to dance?’ smirked Rose to a flummoxed Scorpius.</p><p>‘Ah-I-well-‘</p><p>Rose rolled her eyes and grabbed his hand, pulling Scorpius onto the dance floor.</p><p>Rose was a surprisingly good dancer, and between them they turned a few heads as they waltzed around the dance floor.</p><p>‘Where did you learn to dance?’ Scorpius asked her, his eyes scanning the room over the top of Rose’s head.</p><p>‘Oh my Grandad. He’s obsessed with Muggle stuff, he’s got one of those, Grommerphones is it? We used to dance together when I was little. You?’</p><p>‘My Mum. She loved all kinds of dancing, Wizard and Muggle. Dad’s not fond of dancing, so she used to dance with me.’ Scorpius looked distractedly over Rose’s shoulder as he explained. Where was he?</p><p>‘Scorpius!’</p><p>‘’Sorry what?’ he said as he snapped his eyes back to her.</p><p>‘You’ve spent months asking me out, and now I’m finally dancing with you, you’ve spent the entire time looking over my shoulder!’ She didn’t seem annoyed however. Scorpius thought she looked amused if anything.</p><p>‘Sorry sorry! I’m a terrible partner!’ I’ll pay you more attention. I was just looking for Albus. I promised I wouldn’t leave him, I was just checking he’s ok!’</p><p>Rose’s smirk seemed to get wider. ‘Of course you were. But he’s fine. He’s over there, chatting to your Dad.’</p><p>Scorpius spun round and beamed. He was delighted that his Dad and Albus got along so well.</p><p>‘But that’s why I asked you to dance actually,’ Rose continued. ‘Didn’t you wonder why, after I turned you down all those times?’</p><p>Scorpius was confused. ‘Erm, you’ve heard about my dancing prowess? Or..Oh because I promised Albus I’d stay with him! You wanted to annoy him! I know you two don’t get on, but Rose that’s really mean!’</p><p>‘No you idiot! Well I mean I would be that mean to Albus, but that’s not the reason! It was to make you realise!’</p><p>Scorpius frowned. ‘Realise what?’</p><p>‘That I’m not the Weasley you want!’</p><p>Now Scorpius was really confused. ‘What? Who do you mean?’ He cast his mind around wildly. ‘Dominique? She’s really pretty, and of course there’s the French connection but she’s a bit older and-‘</p><p>‘Nope!’ Rose looked very smug.</p><p>‘Roxanne? I suppose we have Quidditch in common but-‘</p><p>‘Nope!’</p><p>‘Molly?’</p><p>‘Nope!’</p><p>‘Well Victoire is with Teddy and-‘</p><p>‘Nope!’</p><p>Scorpius shook his head, baffled. ‘But that’s all the Weasley girls!’</p><p>‘No it isn’t, you forgot Lily, she’s also a Weasley, even though she’s a Potter. But I don’t mean her either!’</p><p>‘Then who…’</p><p>Rose’s smirk grew wider still. ‘Let me know when you figure it out. But thinking about who you’ve spent this entire dance looking for might give you a clue.’</p><p>The music ended and Scorpius stared at her as she floated away to ask someone else to dance.</p><p>‘Hey’ said Albus, appearing at his side, and clapping a hand on his shoulder. ‘How did it go? One step closer to marital bliss?’</p><p>Scorpius started at him as he felt a tingle on his shoulder where Albus’s hand still rested. He felt a swooping sensation somewhere near his stomach.</p><p>Oh no…he thought. Oh no. this is bad.</p>
