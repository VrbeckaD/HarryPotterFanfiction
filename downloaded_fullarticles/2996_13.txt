    <p>Narcissa sighed.</p>
<p>The aftermath of the Second War had left her increasingly frustrated.  While she and her son had been pardoned for any role they may or may not have played in support of Voldemort, Lucius, along with the remaining Death Eaters, was made an example by the Ministry.  He received life-long imprisonment.  Although, through Harry Potter's insistence, Lucius was given a fair trial and a chance to appeal in twenty-five years’ time, many felt his sentence too lenient.  As a result, Lucius and all the other high-security prisoners were murdered within one year of their imprisonment.  The Ministry declaimed all responsibility.  Thankfully, the families of those prisoners were not persecuted, saved by the vigilance of several members of the Order of the Phoenix.</p>
<p>Even so, things had been hard.  Voldemort’s obsession with blood status had turned the pure-blooded families, with a few exceptions, into second-class citizens in the new society being established.  These families had reacted in typical fashion by retreating and pretending that they could still wield power within their ever-diminishing circles.  This attitude, more than anything else, frustrated Narcissa.  She had always been less zealous and more practical than Lucius, and she knew that integration into the new order was necessary, not only for survival but also the future happiness of her one and only son.</p>
<p>Her son.  Narcissa sighed again.  What was she going to do with him?  He had chosen to reject Harry Potter’s offer to help him integrate, choosing, instead, to spend all his time and inheritance on tedious pleasures of alcohol and “congenial” company.  When admonished, he had shrugged and stated that since the Malfoy line would likely end with him, he would be damned if he left a substantial portion of his inheritance to some poor, distant cousin.  Narcissa had refrained from informing him that his successor was Harry Potter, knowing full well that their continued, one-sided “rivalry” was nothing more than a schoolboy’s grudge.</p>
<p>Well, she had reached the end of her patience with him.  His life was going to amount to more than this inebriated subsistence.  She had not been Sorted into Slytherin for her looks.  But she had to tread carefully.  If he figured out even a part of her scheme, Draco would bolt.  The simple freezing of his assets would only address the symptoms of the problem, not its root.  And so, she would raise the stakes and enlist the help of the last person he would ever expect to form a united front with her against him: Hermione Granger.</p>
