    <p>Once upon a time… that was a kingdom with a queen who is loved by her people. She was a beautiful queen, with a big heart and a bigger sense of justice and equality. Unfortunately, she was crowned queen too soon, but that was just what made her stronger, in the eyes of her court.</p><p>Her parents were the most loved king and queen that her kingdom had, but unfortunately, due to an epidemic of fever, they both passed away, leaving the crown and the destiny of the kingdom in her shoulders. She was just a little girl back then, barely five years old.</p><p>Nowadays, she was a fierce ruler, who is fair and brought peace for her people. She knows that are some rulers from different kingdoms who judge her weak and wants nothing more than to bring her down. This is something that isn’t going to happen.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, her parents had made some deals of peace with a few foreign lands. They thought that if something happens to them, she wasn’t going to need to deal with many threats. In certain ways they were right, but in others, they couldn’t be more wrong.</p><p>That is the reason that Queen Hermione was so tense in the early hours of the day. She discovered about some of the deals that her parents made, and she isn’t really happy with what she found out. But she is a ruler, a Queen, and she will deal with everything with her head held high.</p>
