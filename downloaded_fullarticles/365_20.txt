    <p>Chapter 1<br/>

“Bring our little guest in, would you Lucius?” the voice of the Dark Lord Voldemort demanded. The blond bowed in reverence before he turned to leave the room. “While you incompetent fools have been bumbling about after rumors, one of you has remained useful. Not only did he bring me valuable information, but he also brought me leverage. It would be wise for you fools to emulate him in the future.” Voldemort sneered.<br/>
Lucius returned, the girl he dragged behind him covered in mild cuts and bruises. She fought against Lucius before being thrown to the ground at the Dark Lord's feet. She did not remain on the ground for longer than a moment, stubbornly refusing to bow before her kidnapper.<br/>
“Ah, Miss Granger, so good for you to join us.” Hermione glared into his blood red eyes and refused to make a sound. Voldemort tisked. “Where are your manners, girl?”<br/>
“I am afraid they were left at the ministry with the rest of my friends,” Hermione snapped.<br/>
“You dare speak to your Lord that way!” a voice screeched behind her. “Crucio!” The curse struck Hermione to her knees, but she refused to make a sound.<br/>
“Bella, please. Is that any way to greet our guest?” the Dark Lord chided. Bellatrix removed the curse with a bow but continued to sneer in Hermione’s direction.<br/>
“My Lord, if I may?” a deep voice spoke. Hermione refused to glance at the man next to her. The reason she had been in this mess in the first place.<br/>
“Of course Severus.”<br/>
“I would like to keep the girl if I may. I know it is not right of me to ask for favors of you my Lord, I only feel that it would be prudent to keep her under my control.” Severus did not glance in Hermione’s direction, nor did he acknowledge her presence there. She seethed. Harry and Ron had been right. They could never trust Snape. Now Sirius was dead, and she was in the snake pit with no chance of escape.<br/>
The Dark Lord appeared to contemplate the request for a moment before a sadistic gleam shone in his red eyes. “I think I will allow this Severus. It could indeed be beneficial to your status within the Order's ranks. I will leave her care to you, Severus. I trust you would know how to keep her obedient, and I expect her to be a regular guest amongst our ranks. Wouldn’t it be fun for Potter to know that his little friend could be brought to her knees so easily.”<br/>
Severus Snape bowed, “I thank you, my Lord. Might I take her now, or do you wish for her to remain here?”<br/>
“Take her. I grow tired of the sight of her filthy blood.” Voldemort waved his hand dismissively, “Clean her up would you?” Severus bowed again and grabbed Hermione by her forearm and dragged her from the room.<br/>
“Let me go! We never should have trusted you!” Hermione snarled.<br/>
“Miss Granger, I recommend you keep your mouth shut. The walls have ears.” Severus snapped at her.<br/>
“Why should you care? Why should you care that people can hear of your loyalties! You are obviously in good company!”<br/>
Severus spun around and yanked her closer to him. She glared defiantly, she tried to pretend the height difference wasn’t there, that her small stature could be intimidating to the man, but his glare was colder, and he stood a full foot and a half taller and she had to strain to stare into his eyes. “If you can’t keep your mouth shut, I will silence you. For your own safety, and my own.” He spun around again just as fast and continued to drag her through the halls of an elaborate home.<br/>
Hermione didn’t speak again until Severus opened a door and shoved her through roughly, she lost her footing and landed quite ungracefully onto a chaise lounge in a spacious living room. Severus slammed the door and threw up wards around the room.<br/>
“Speak.” He demanded.<br/>
“What would you have me say? Let me go? That obviously isn’t the plan.” Hermione hissed.<br/>
“Obviously.”<br/>
“Does Dumbledore know you’ve betrayed him yet? It won’t be long before they come for me. You know they need me.”<br/>
“Don’t be foolish, girl. You may be irritatingly intelligent for your age, but you are not as invaluable as you think you are.”<br/>
“Harry needs me and you know it!”<br/>
“Potter would do well to learn to not need you. Him needing you is exactly why you’re in this mess.” Hermione looked puzzled. “You stupid girl. Did you honestly not understand why you were taken specifically? That brat is useless without you. The Dark Lord wanted you specifically.”<br/>
“And this has to do with you because?”<br/>
“Orders.”<br/>
“Who’s? Voldemort or Professor Dumbledore’s?”<br/>
“It would be wise for you to not speak the Dark Lord’s name here. And until you are capable of protecting your mind, I will not answer questions. Just know that if you obey, you will be mostly safe.”<br/>
“Mostly safe? What is that supposed to mean? You’ve taken me hostage! How can I be safe?”<br/>
“Because you stupid girl, Dumbledore knows you are here and will not come and get you. You are expected to behave yourself in order to stay alive."<br/>
"So what, am I just a pawn in someone's game then?" Hermione snapped. Snape refused to look at her, instead, he turned his back and walked out the door, slamming it behind him. Hermione stood and ran to the door, reaching for the knob to get out, but the door was warded. Hermione bounced off the ward and landed firmly on the ground. She screamed in frustration and righteous anger. She was a pawn. Her connection to Harry had always put her in the line of fire, but never this close. She felt helpless, and Hermione Granger did not tolerate feeling helpless. So, she did what she did best. She waited and planned.<br/>
Severus Snape was angry. He spent most of his days annoyed, even frustrated, but rarely was he truly angry. That stupid girl put herself into a difficult situation when she followed that Potter boy to the ministry. Not only did she get captured, but that damn mutt was thrown through the veil, and who knows what happens then. All anyone knew was Granger was in the snake pit, Potter was useless as always, and Black was dead. There goes the long line of the Ancient and Noble House.<br/>
Yes. Severus was angry. Dolores Umbridge was making life difficult at Hogwarts, and he had to take his orders from a bloody bird. And to make matters worse, he now had to keep the chit of a girl alive and keep his cover with the pest underfoot. This day was not going well.<br/>
Severus swept down the hall, ignoring the stares and whispers. Ignoring Bella as she attempted to gain his attention. She would grovel at the foot of whomever the Dark Lord deemed worthy of his praise, and Severus had no patience for her antics.<br/>
"Severus my friend," a haughty voice sounded from behind him.<br/>
"Lucius."<br/>
"You did rather well to catch her, but must you really keep her here? Wouldn't the dungeons be more suitable?"<br/>
"No. If I am to play my part within the Order, I have to appear to keep her safe. Therefore, when I return to the school, she shall return with me." Severus turned to continue to the exit. Determined to down an entire bottle of Ogden's Finest on his own while the chit tired herself out.<br/>
"How do you plan on keeping her in place and obedient?"<br/>
"Lucius, I have my ways as you well know."<br/>
"She isn't a pet, Severus, she's a prisoner. She's beneath your tricks."<br/>
"That may be so, but my "tricks" as you call it, will still serve its purpose." Lucius opened his mouth to argue and the glare Severus sent his way would freeze the pits of hell. Severus swept his way down the stairs and out the door without another interruption and apparated straight to the gates of Hogwarts.</p>
