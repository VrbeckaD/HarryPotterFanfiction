    <p>It was far too late to dodge the blow that was coming. He noticed the swing too late; but the motion was moving slowly as if just to tease him. He took it to the jaw, the hard fist knocking his head to the side and sending him sprawling onto the ground. He slid a little on the dew dampened grass of the forest, his back knocking into a tree, head thrown back to collide with the bark.</p>
<p>Remus brought a hand up and touched where he had been hit. Then a little higher. He felt something wet, warm. Pulling his hand back, he saw the blood. His lip must have split with the force of the punch and the rage and hate that carried it through. </p>
<p>He gave a small sort of smile, looking up at the other man. The same level of hate was bubbling up inside him, but Remus wasn’t one to show it straight away. He was one to hide it, let it boil. Let it bubble and pop and steam and jostle the cover of the pot that held it. And it would burst from him suddenly like the water from the heated pot. </p>
<p>“Fenrir.”</p>
<p>The other man snarled, showing his teeth, almost feral even though he was very much still human. His fist clenched and Remus’ eyes were drawn to the movement of it. Fenrir was too far away from him right now for a follow through punch but Remus braced himself for it anyway. The larger man's one working eye narrowed. </p>
<p>Remus licked his lower lip, tasting the coppery tinge of blood. "What brings you here?"</p>
<p>"You know very well why I am here, Pup." </p>
<p>"Do I?" The younger man flinched back into the tree when Fenrir took a heavy footed step toward him. </p>
<p>"You should." </p>
<p>His brave front nearly slipped as Fenrir took another threatening step. He forced a smirk up at the other man. "I don't. Maybe you could fill me in a little?"</p>
<p>Fenrir moved swiftly, his hand moving so fast that Remus couldn't track it. It grabbed him by the front of his shirt; those sharp, dirty fingernails scratched at the skin of his chest through the fabric. Remus' breath hitched, getting lodged in his throat. He was lifted up forcibly, dragged to his feet and slammed hard into the tree's trunk. The older werewolf leaned in slowly and inhaled deeply. He let out a low rumbling growl deep in his throat. </p>
<p>Remus turned his head to the side, trying to hold his breath. The larger man smelled of blood, sweat, and dirt. Remus swallowed hard. </p>
<p>The elder werewolf smirked, elongated canines glinting bright in the moonlight that cast down through the trees. “I know who you’re working with, Pup.”</p>
<p>Remus tensed and gasped as Fenrir pushed him harder into the tree at those words. His hands gripped at the bark and he could feel the rough wood peel away at his skin. “I’m not working with anyone!"</p>
<p>"You're working for him aren't you? For Dumbledore. Trained you like a right little lapdog, didn't he?"</p>
<p>"You're wrong!" Remus snapped, struggling against the grip that held him to the tree. </p>
<p>"Am I?" Fenrir snarled. He released his grip on the younger man and took a step backwards. He watched as Remus landed on his feet, back still against the tree to keep his balance. Fenrir clapped his hands together as though he were ridding them of filth. "You don't mind telling me what you're doing in my territory then, do you, Pup?"</p>
<p>Remus exhaled, shaky and nervous, his brave front all but vanished. He took some time to calm his breathing before responding. "I don't want to live in wizarding society any longer."</p>
<p>The older werewolf seemed taken aback, he huffed a heavy breath and crossed his arms over his broad chest. “Didn’t that father of yours ever tell you not to tell fibs, Little One?”</p>
<p>“I’m not joking!” The rage burst from him in a rush. He couldn’t take holding it in any longer. Trying to play everything cool rarely lasted long. This night was burrowing anxiety under his skin and he was having a hard time shaking it. He surged forward, teeth bared. He launched himself at the other man, slamming him down, both bodies crashing into the forest floor. </p>
<p>Fenrir snarled his surprise, pushing the rabid twenty year old off of him. He pushed the writhing wolf down, holding him to the grass with a hand on his chest. “Fuck’s wrong with you, you little bastard?!” Fenrir spat blood in the grass to the right of Remus’ head. He had bit his tongue when he hit the ground. </p>
<p>“I hate it!” Remus yowled like a scalded cat; twisting furiously, as he tried to slip from Fenrir’s steady strength. “I hate this!”</p>
<p>“Calm. Down!” The wolf roared. </p>
<p>And Remus froze. </p>
<p>His body tensed, eyes went wide, mouth snapped shut. Instinct buzzed through him in an icy chill through his veins. <i>Fenrir was in charge</i> his body suddenly screamed to his mind. But his mind revolted the thought. That monster could never be in charge of him. Never. Fenrir was a beast, a horror, a nightmare, and Remus never would willingly go near him. But that was the thing. This was not willingly done; he had been forced into this. He may have offered his services, but if he were honest with himself, who else in the Order could have done it? He was their only werewolf. He was their secret weapon. </p>
<p>Now he was trapped. He was meant to weasel his way into the pack and be a spy. But Fenrir has shut his own body down with one order. How?</p>
<p>“Fucking. <i>Talk</i>.” The wolf snarled, pushing hard on his chest. </p>
<p>Had he been talking before this? </p>
<p>“I don’t want to do it anymore,” Remus gasped, lungs burning as his chest was pushed on. One of his hands moved by itself to grasp at Fenrir’s wrist. </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Pretend!” He cried, eyes closing tight. Emotion burst from him. This was all happening wrong. He wanted to be a wizard. He didn’t want to pretend about his lycanthropy. He didn’t want to hide in the shadows and worry about mothers ushering away their children from him. He wanted to live a normal wizard’s life!</p>
<p>“Talk.” Fenrir said again. He lessened the pressure on Remus’ chest but he still held him down, obviously not trusting him. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to pretend anymore. I don’t want to hide. I want to be accepted!” It was all so true. But he should be telling this to his friends, not his worst enemy. Not the man who made him this way. Not his curse. His heart clenched. He was full to bursting with these feelings; the thoughts he had kept under lock and key for all his life were coming out and were facing the man he hated more than anything. </p>
<p>"Pup," Fenrir's voice was unlike Remus had ever heard it. Wide green eyes met with the one working amber one. The voice was gravley and deep, and Remus could feel its power. Could feel how anyone could be drawn and commanded and <i>controlled</i>. Or was that just the wolf in him? The silence after the spoken word broke a few moments later. "Pup," he said again, "you don't have to suffer at the hands of scum like them." Remus wasn't sure if he was referring to Dumbledore's cronies or to humanity in general. "You're unique, special. You're pack."</p>
<p>"Pack." Remus whispered, almost breathless. His heart swelled at the word and he couldn't understand why.</p>
<p>"Yes, Little One," Fenrir crooned softly, moving his hand away from Remus' chest, watching as it rose in a shuddering breath. "You're pack."</p>
<p>Remus swallowed hard. His mind was racing. He stared at Fenrir and croaked weakly, "How do I join?"</p>
