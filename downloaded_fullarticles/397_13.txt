    <p><strong>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry<br/></strong><strong>Sunday, October 31, 2004  <br/><br/></strong>For the first time in his memory, Harry was actually enjoying Halloween and couldn’t suppress the shiver of excitement running through him as he sat next to his friends Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall. Before coming to Hogwarts, Halloween was always marred by his relatives in one way or another. It was only upon his arrival here that he discovered his parent's murder happened this day thirteen years ago, explaining his relatives' attitude towards him and causing a deep sadness within himself to rise at the thought of all that took place due to that one event. </p><p>However, this year was different, as Headmaster Dumbledore announced at the beginning of the year that the TriWizard Tournament would be reinstated again after having banned for centuries. Better yet for Harry in his opinion, wards would be in place, ensuring no one under seventeen years of age would be able to enter or be able to place a name other than their own in the Goblet of Fire. Thus, these measures ensured for once he would be allowed a peaceful year and not even the fact that Quidditch was canceled for the year dampened Harry’s spirits or lower his hopes that perhaps for once, he would be able to concentrate on his schoolwork and friends, although perhaps not in that order. He knew he didn’t always have the best grades, but Angelina Johnson, the Gryffindor Quidditch captain, was just as bad, if not worse than the previous captain. Between all the practices, he truly didn’t have to dedicate the time he should to his studies.</p><p><em>Not that people want to see the Gryffindor Golden Boy excel in much beyond Defense against the Dark Arts,</em> he thought, snorting to himself. <em>Nor would Hermione actually want to see me do my best. Merlin knows she has to be the best at everything.</em></p><p>Seeing the Goblet of Fire light up managed to help push those depressing thoughts of people’s unrealistic and contradicting expectations away. For once, the whole school wouldn't be forced on him, on something he had done or hadn’t done. Instead, all thoughts and fixations would be whoever was chosen as champions from the other two European Magic schools, Beauxbatons Academy and Durmstrang Institute, along with the upcoming TriWizarding Tournament. </p><p>Watching as the Headmaster caught the last slip of paper the Goblet spit out, Harry cheered for Cedric Diggory, the newly named Hogwarts champion. Starting to lose himself to his thoughts again as the Headmaster began droning about the exciting events planned, the Goblet of Fire suddenly shot out another slip of paper. Unsure what was happening, he listened in disbelief as a fourth champion was announced. Blinking rapidly as he tried processing what he thought he heard, he missed Professor Dumbledore sternly calling him up.</p><p>When the second call to Harry failed to rouse him, Hermione jabbed him in the side and pointed out he had to go with the Headmaster. Taking a deep breath, his heart stuck in his throat and his stomach felt as though someone had cast a Cæcitas hex on it, he nodded and walked what seemed like an eternity to the room the true champions had gone to behind the Professor’s table. Trying not to look at the students glaring at him in disbelief, anger, and spitefulness, he instead focused on the head table in hopes of finding kindness. Instead, all he found were looks of disgust and disappointment on the Professors' faces, including Headmaster's as well. Already, Mr. Crouch and the other school heads were arguing fiercely behind a silencing bubble.  </p><p>As whispers, boo’s, and hisses of hate and disbelief followed him, all Harry could think was, <em>This can't be happening,</em> before scoffing to himself. </p><p><em>Considering what's happened before? </em>He reasoned sarcastically, trying now to roll his eyes, <em>Unfortunately, it probably is. But this can’t be legal. Not with all the wards set up around the Goblet. Besides, there is no way I can compete against those at least three years older than me! There has got to be a way out, despite what was said about the contract being binding.</em> </p><p>As he entered with Dumbledore into the room where the Champions were waiting, the other school heads followed. This time, without the silencing charms, Harry could hear them yelling at Mr. Crouch about how they should have a second champion since Hogwarts clearly cheated. The other champions just stood there, glaring at him and Harry couldn’t help wishing he was anywhere else.</p><p>Before Harry got a chance to speak, Mr. Crouch protested, “I’m sorry, but the champions are chosen and that is final. The Goblet of Fire has gone out and won’t light until the next tournament. If you leave, your champions must remain as if they do not compete, they will be breaking a Magical contract. By breaking the contract, it will cause them to, at the very least, lose a good deal of their Magic, if not all. There may be other consequences as well that Magic forces upon on them, depending on her will. Despite whatever means Mr. Potter used to enter, all four must participate. It is part of the contract when entering your name in the Goblet. I’m sorry, but that’s final.”  </p><p>Angry over the assumption he had willing put his name in, Harry at last found his voice and croaked out loud as he could, “But that's the thing, I didn’t put my name in the Goblet. I don’t want to be in the Tournament!”  </p><p>Huffing in disbelief, Mr. Crouch answered, “Really, Mr. Potter, it is no use protesting now. What’s done is done. You are now Magically required to participate. Now, for all of you champions, as to the first task in the TriWizarding Tournament, it’s designed to test your knowledge and ability to think on your feet, so no one will be told beforehand as to the task on November 24th. Now, I wish you all a good evening and I’ll see you soon!”  </p><p>With that, Mr. Crouch left quickly, not wishing to deal with the angry Champions or their head of schools. As Harry saw the resentment, confusion, and anger flash on each of the faces in the room, he was thankful when Professor Dumbledore soon dismissed them. Even though it was late, he knew at least Ron and Hermione would still be waiting up for him and hoped they would be supportive considering they knew how much he had been looking forward to a peaceful year.  </p><p>As he entered Gryffindor Tower, he didn’t even have a chance to sit before Ron began questioning him casually – or at least as casually as he could.  </p><p>“So, how’d you do it?”  </p><p>“Do what?” Harry wondered, looking at Ron as if he was crazy.  </p><p>“Get into the tournament,” Ron said sarcastically and languidly as if felt Harry was slow-witted while rolling his eyes. “No one could figure it out, but really, you can tell me and Hermione. You’re obviously not going to get into trouble so why not.”  </p><p>“I was surprised as you were when my name was called out!” Harry defended himself. “I never wanted to participate in this stupid tournament in the first place and you know that.”    </p><p>“Surprised it worked maybe,” Ron said in a disbelieving tone. “Why didn’t you tell us your plan? We could have entered as well.”  </p><p>Trying his best not to bite out the words in anger, Harry repeated slowly, gritting his teeth in anger, “I did not do anything!”  </p><p>“Yeah, right,” Ron huffed, sharing a look with Hermione. “Why wouldn’t you want to enter? No end of year tests, more fame, a thousand Galleons in prize money…”  </p><p>Cutting him off angrily, Harry repeated, “I have at least three years less education than the others! I could care less about the stupid fame or money! I’m only participating so I do not lose my Magic as without it, well, I honestly don’t want to think about it. Although, maybe you would like that, huh?”  </p><p>By now, Harry was fed up with Ron's know-it-all attitude and was shouting as loud as possible, not caring about possibly waking up the entire tower. “Or perhaps if I am one of the lucky ones that dies, will convince you I don't want this? Then you'd have the fame of being the friend Boy-Who-Died-in-a-Stupid-Tournament?”  </p><p>Hermione finally spoke up, using a haughty tone that clearly meant she thought he was exaggerating, “That type of danger is in the past though. Professor Dumbledore told us that there are a lot more safety measures. The chances of someone dying is so unlikely, it is nearly non-existent. So much so that even I had passing thoughts of what it would be like to be in such a tournament. I’m sure it would be difficult, yes, but still, a rewarding challenge.”  </p><p>Rolling his eyes at her, Harry shook his head. Sometimes, he couldn’t believe how trusting she was of the professors and adults. He always wondered when, or if, she would ever learn to think for herself. He admittedly gave her more of a break than she deserved at times as she hadn’t been sentenced to live with the Dursley’s. She had had a so-called normal childhood nor as she wasn't faced with the fact the public expected more out of him as the ‘Boy-Who-Lived'. It seemed this year she was getting even worse with her attitude, especially if this summer was any example. Things were just made worse by Ron's attitude. </p><p>Seeing Harry didn’t appear to have a response to Hermione, Ron continued to attack Harry, his frustrations that had been building over the last few years finally spewing out.  </p><p>“He just wants even more attention than he is getting. I mean, Merlin knows he isn’t getting enough attention and if he hadn’t gone into the tournament, he’d be left out this year. Not famous enough you know,” Ron taunted cruelly. “And then, of course, he wants the 1,000 Galleons to himself. Hasn’t got enough Galleons, I mean, why else wouldn’t he share his fortune with anyone?”  </p><p>“You know what Ron? You’re just a spoiled little ignorant boy who is jealous of everyone. You can’t see what’s in front of your eyes. I’m so fed up with your ‘poor me’ take on life. You think life for you is so terrible, well, guess what, I’d kill for a family like yours,” Harry jumped to his feet, running his hands through his hair in frustration. No matter what he did, nothing seemed good enough for Ron. “At least when you go home, you know you won’t go hungry, be worked to the bone day after day, be locked up like some animal that’s feared, or have to wonder what you’ll do next to set off up your family.”</p><p>Chuckling, Ron got right back up in his face. “Oooh, poor little orphan Harry,” he mocked, using his hands to quote his words. “Got it so bad that everyone wants to be your friend. They just adore you for sitting on your arse all day, doing nothing! And do you truly expect us to believe you have it so bad at home?”  </p><p>“Professor Dumbledore wouldn’t allow anyone to live anywhere that was harmful to them, Harry,” Hermione said, backing up Ron in a disbelieving tone.  </p><p>“Oh, yes, you know everything, don’t you?” Harry turned his anger on her. “Just quote the adults, the Professors, and books, then everything will be just fine, won’t it? None of them could be possibly wrong, not ever, right? No need to think for yourself! Not at all like this summer at the Quidditch final when Mr. Weasley ordered the three of us to stay hidden in the tent. If we had done that, we’d have been right in the way of the Death Eaters and who the bloody hell knows what would've happened.”  </p><p>Huffing at him, Hermione flounced back in the chair with her arms crossed.</p><p>“Well, at least I don’t find dangerous situations every year that could lead to our deaths!” she hissed in retaliation.  </p><p>“Yeah, that’s right,” Ron said, glaring back at Harry. “How many times have the two of us gotten hurt or nearly so because of things you couldn’t leave alone?”  </p><p>“Oh, yes, I've held you two at wand point each and every time, making you go with me, despite me say not to do so. Next time, I’ll make sure not to go off and rescue any family members of yours that are idiotic enough to write in a diary that writes back,” shouted Harry in a mocking tone, unaware of how much louder he had gotten. “You two need to grow the hell up, not everything is so black and white.   </p><p>“Think for yourselves! Do you honestly think I have wanted any of that shit to happen to me? Do you think I want to know I have to face stuff yet again, having to use skills far above what I know?”  </p><p>Seeing Ron about to interrupt, Harry just yelled louder, “And no, Ron, money isn’t everything! And Professors aren’t always right, Hermione!”  </p><p>“While that may be the case, Mister Potter,” a stern voice from the doorway broke in. “This time I feel you will tend to agree with me when I say it is well past curfew and the three of you should be in bed. Not to mention, this conduct is most unbecoming. The three of you will each be serving detention with me tomorrow night.”  </p><p>Turning around to face Professor McGonagall, their head of house, the three nodded their heads guilty.  </p><p>“Off to bed. Now,” she ordered, obviously displeased with them.  </p><p>Doing as ordered, at the bottom of the stairs to the male bedrooms, Harry couldn’t help but say one last thing.  </p><p>“If neither of you two can’t, or won't, see that I hate being forced into the situations I’ve been forced into, then I don’t know what else to say,” Harry sadly whispered.  </p><p>Hoping that he hadn’t lost both his friends in one night, Harry also realized that things had to change, even if it meant losing them. He cared for them both, but it seemed like their friendship had reached a breaking point. Considering all that they had faced, Harry wasn't sure he could blame them for feeling as they did. He went up to his bed and crawled in fully clothed, too emotionally drained to change. As he drifted off to sleep, he hoped things would get better.  </p><p>----------------</p><p>Unfortunately, as the first task on November 24th crept closer, things just got worse. Somehow, just two days after Halloween, Malfoy managed to make badges that flashed ‘Potter Stinks!’. Having Ron take one and Hermione just ignored them as if they didn’t exist almost physically hurt. None of the teachers seemed aware of them or did much about them if anyone was caught with one. Not even his head of house. And of course, Professor Snape took the whole thing as a chance to mock and torment him in Potions class even more than usual. The only professors who didn’t seem to be affected by all of what was happening were the new Defense Professor, Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody, and Professor Trelawney, who just continued to predict his death with regularity. </p><p>Resigning himself to the fact that things weren’t going to get better any time soon, Harry ended up spending more and more of his free time in the library. Despite it being Hermione’s normal domain, she ignored him and the others gathered there were too afraid of Madame Pince to harass him. After a week of just hiding there and doing his homework, he finally decided he couldn’t just sit around and wait for whatever the First Task might be, so he resigned himself to hours of studying random subjects in the library in hopes he might learn something which could help him survive. However, once Hagrid showed him the take involved dragons, Harry realized that learning spells and performing them were two different things. </p><p>A full twenty-four hours after finding out about the dragons and learning each of the champions would have to get past them - in which time, Harry spent most of it panicking - he finally had an idea. Or at least, a vague outline of an idea. </p><p>“Dobby?” Harry called tentatively while hiding in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.</p><p>The promise of having to share the space if he died whilst performing the First Task in exchange for privacy was worth it to him. </p><p>“Mister Harry Potter, sir! So good is it to see you again! What can Dobby be doing for Mister Harry Potter, sir?” an excited house elf with large eyes and ears flopping asked after popping in. </p><p>“Hey, Dobby,” smiled Harry. “I heard you were working here now. I was wondering if you knew of any place I could practice spells for the TriWizard Tournament?” <br/><br/>“Ahh, yes, such a horrible thing to have happened to the great Harry Potter. So young to be an adult wizard,” trailing off, Dobby thought for a moment before a look of inspiration struck him. “Has Mister Harry Potter heard of the Room of Requirement?” <br/><br/>At the puzzled look and shake of Harry's head, Dobby enthusiastically grabbed his hand and announced, “Dobby shall take Mister Harry Potter if he so wishes.” </p><p>Giving his consent, Harry followed as Dobby led him up various staircases and through different passageways, thinking on something Dobby as said. After learning how to enter the room, which had transformed into a gym complete with training dummies, a small library, a small kitchen with an attached living room and bathroom, Dobby asked if there was anything else he could do. </p><p>“Actually, yes,” Harry told him, looking down at the expectant face. “What did you mean 'so young to be an adult'?” </p><p>“Maybe it is not Dobby's place to say so…” he started heading to a brick wall, which Harry feared would lead to Dobby bashing his head in punishment. <br/><br/></p><p>“Dobby, no, it's okay,” Harry quickly said. Bending down, he paused a moment to figure out how to explain to his friend that telling him wouldn’t be breaking any rules. </p><p>“I'm sure Headmaster Dumbledore just hasn’t had the time or something to let me know what you do, I mean…” sighing, Harry ran his hands through his hair. “With you working here, it is okay for you to tell me things I should know as I am here to learn whatever I need. Does that make sense?”</p><p>Nodding vigorously, Dobby recited back, “Mister Harry Potter is student in this great castle, here to learn lessons so Mister Harry Potter can live good and happy life once Mister Harry Potter leaves. That mean Dobby can tell as Dobby here to help students?” <br/><br/>“Exactly!” triumphant, Harry grinned at Dobby. <br/><br/>“When Dobby saying Mister Harry Potter is young to be adult, Dobby means Mister Harry Potter is now be treated as adult as Mister Harry Potter in Magic as he is in Tournament for adults.” <br/><br/>“How is that possible?” <br/><br/>“Dobby only be knowing it is old Wizarding law.” Seeing Harry still baffled, Dobby spoke up hesitantly with a hint of fear, “May Dobby make a suggestion?”</p><p>Nodding, Harry waited for Dobby to speak up. <br/><br/>“Dobby thinks Mister Harry Potter should writes Gringotts. Goblins be knowing more than Dobby.”<br/><br/>“Brilliant!” </p><p>Blushing, Dobby shuffled in place, “Is there be anything else Mister Harry Potter need?” </p><p>“Just a question,” Harry said reluctantly, hating he even had to be asking it. “I was wondering if you would be willing to take the letter to the goblins, as well as bringing any letters back to me? I don’t exactly want anyone to know what I’m doing.” <br/><br/>“I would be most honored! Dobby must tell Mister Harry Potter though that should staff ask, Dobby must tell,” saying that, Dobby started sniffling.</p><p>“No, it’s okay Dobby,” Harry hastened to reassure him. “It was just a thought.”</p><p>“Dobby could only keep Mister Harry Potter secrets if Dobby works for Mister Harry Potter. Then, Dobby be bound not to tell Mister Harry Potter secrets,” Dobby stated shyly, rubbing his foot along the ground.<br/><br/>“Would you mind terribly if you worked for me just doing small errands until I leave school, but still work for Hogwarts?” Hearing how that sounded, Harry added quickly, “I am more than happy to match whatever the school pays you. I just mainly need help without anyone knowing what errands and such I ask of you, not even the Headmaster.” </p><p>Thinking about it for a few long minutes, Dobby answered, “Dobby has no need for three more Galleons a week or a second bed. One Galleon a week enough when Dobby works for Hogwarts as well. Anything Dobby does for Mister Harry Potter is told to no one. Mister Harry Potter tells Dobby when school is done so Dobby might go with him as Dobby is free elf and can leave when Dobby wishes.” <br/><br/>“Try to call me Harry and we have a deal,” he grinned, holding out his hand to shake. Feeling a weird shiver-like feeling go through him, Harry asked, “What was that?” <br/><br/>“That be Dobby's house elf Magic, Dobby is still free, but Magic used when Dobby have contract made. Magic not bes powerful as full bond but still powerful, Mister Harry P…” the house elf trailed off and looked around. </p><p>Seeing Dobby still hadn’t quite broken the habit of injuring himself when disobeying orders, real or implied, Harry grabbed hold of him. After making sure Dobby wouldn’t be missing anywhere, Harry sat down and asked Dobby about anything he thought he should know about the Wizarding World, just as long as it didn’t mean Dobby would feel the need to hurt himself. It turned out there were a few things Harry learned that afternoon and that evening, spent a good deal of time composing a letter to the goblins. <br/><br/>Now, all he needed to do was wait for their reply and hopefully survive the Tournament intact. </p><p>----------------  </p><p><strong>Hospital Ward, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry<br/></strong> <strong>Friday, June 24, 2005   </strong></p><p>After the experiences of the Third Task where the Champions were forced to find their way through a maze to find the Cup and the results of ‘winning’ with Cedric Diggory, Harry was glad for the peace and silence in the hospital wing. It had been bad enough defending himself against a Boggart, figuring out that gravity-reversing mist, and battling an Acromantula with Cedric's help. It was made worse after finding Fleur Delacour, the Beauxbatons Champion, being tortured with the Cruciatus curse by an Imperio’d Viktor Krum, the Durmstrang champion.  </p><p>Although horrible enough to see that, what Harry couldn’t get out of his mind was what had taken place right after he and Cedric grabbed hold of the TriWizarding Cup together. Shuddering, Harry couldn’t help, but remember how a Portkey took them to a graveyard and soon after, Cedric was killed. Before he could react, he had been tied up to a gravestone and Wormtail used his blood to help resurrect Lord Voldemort.</p><p>Only by sheer luck, and chance, had he been able to escape with Cedric's body.    </p><p>Quite a few things were clear when he got back to Hogwarts. The first was that yet again, the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher employed was the wrong choice as Mad-Eye Moony was, in fact, Barty Crouch Junior. All year, the real Mad-Eye had been locked in a trunk so Crouch Junior could Polyjuice himself. Then, just as bad, if not worse than being held by that madman after getting back from the graveyard was Headmaster Dumbledore's attitude. He evidently seemed more concerned about other matters than the fact that he had been held under the Cruciatus curse before being forced to duel Voldemort. Not to mention, all this occurred <em>after </em>surviving that stupid maze. All Dumbledore demanded to know was what had happened around him, not to him. Yes, he was aware it was important, but Harry couldn’t help wonder why no thought was given to him until hours later when, finally dismissed, he had gone to see Madame Pomfrey voluntarily. The respect he had for Professor Dumbledore wasn't too high after previous years and experiences; after this, Harry wasn’t sure much, if any, remained.  </p><p>Finally, there was how Minister Fudge acted. Harry knew he had seen the fear pass across the Minister’s face, but just as quickly, after looking at him, the Minister dismissed everything. He had flat-out refused to even think that maybe he was right about Lord Voldemort’s return! Being called a liar in front of those gathered for the Final TriWizarding Task just fed into the disrespect, anger, and disgust he felt at the current Minister of Magic.  </p><p>One thing was for certain, Harry was glad that he had done so much research and planning, both alone and with the goblins help this school year. With one thing and another, if he hadn’t done so, with the return of Lord Voldemort, he wasn’t sure how else he would make it to graduation alive. </p><p>Now, he just had to figure out how to get to Gringotts this summer…</p>
