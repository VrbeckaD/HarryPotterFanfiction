    <p>Adrien couldn't help it; he really couldn't.</p><p>The exchange student was just too beautiful to <em>not</em> be enamoured by, and he was sure half the school agreed with him.</p><p>They had just gotten an exchange student from the Beauxbaton Academy of Magic, and to say she was absolutely stunning would be a complete and utter understatement, completely false on the mere fact that it just wasn't enough.</p><p>She had long dark hair that he was sure would flow all the way to her ankles if she didn't have it braided.</p><p>The braid was loose and sort of large, signifying that she had very thick hair. It dangled all the way to her rear, with a string of white, pink, red, and burgundy peonies woven in with the hair, along with a flower crown made of irises decorating her head, a gift to her from Rose, something to remind her of her home in France.</p><p>She had pale, porcelain-like skin with a smattering of freckles along the bridge of her nose and all across her cheeks, and there were some on her arms and shoulders. She had these iridescent eyes, too, bright blue and with just enough sharpness to puncture the heart of any and all persons who dared to look into them, but not enough to make them feel uncomfortable under a piercing gaze.</p><p>She was apparently a half-blood, something a few of the purebloods scoffed at despite their private whispers of how pretty she was. She was the daughter of a halfblood from Paris, France, and a pureblood from Zhouzhuang, China, who was more familiar with the Chinese way of performing magic and that had apparently been what the beautiful girl had known before going to school, meaning she had a mix of magic from an ancient culture more familiar and creative with their magic than the modern society of the Wizarding World, and that same modern ideology.</p><p>To top it all off, she was an aspiring designer, and over the past couple of weeks with the many friends she had already made, she was very eager to show off all of her designs.</p><p>Adrien, being a pureblood and the son of a designer, had seen plenty of plain clothes and enchanted ones. His father tailored to both the muggles and the wizards, being a bit more progressive than some of their pureblood brethren.</p><p>And he had to say, this girl's designs were really something.</p><p>She almost always did enchanted designs, but occasionally, when she got her hands on the right fabrics, she managed to make beautiful, ordinary clothes that had the same effect as the enchanted ones. </p><p>She knew some very advanced garment charms, and he was really impressed with her. He had even gotten to witness her make up her own charms here and there, when he noticed in their charms or potions class. Professor Flitwick had deemed her one of his favorite students, alongside the likes of himself and his best friend, Nino, who frequently made charms that were useful in Professor Flitwick's choir, considering they mostly had to do with music.</p><p>But, even after all this time, neither him or his best friend had ever happened to catch her first name. Everyone called her by her last name, and addressed her the French way, Mademoiselle, instead of the English or Scottish way, Miss.</p><p>So Adrien found himself growing very fond of a girl he had no name for, for the exception of the name their whole class had settled on calling her; Lady Creation, or <em>Dame de la Création.</em></p><p>Her very close friends called her Ladybug, and he had only heard her talk about it once. Apparently Ladybug and any consequential nicknames sprouting off of that was a name that her parents had given her since, her whole life, the girl had seemed to have an oddly lucky string of events that followed her. Including times when, if she gave someone a blessing, even if had no real intentions, that blessing would come to pass. She even made the comment that people back at the Beauxbatons used to call her Lady Luck, or, by her older peers,<em> Mademoiselle de la Chance.</em></p><p>Adrien found that really amusing, actually. He seemed to be the opposite of her. He could only ever remember having a strange misfortune in his life, having very few happy memories with... essentially anything in his life. Nino. Nino was a happy memory, but that was about it. He wondered if that had anything to do with the fact that his mother, an animagus, was a black cat.</p>
<hr/><p>Adrien blinked. He couldn't even believe what he was looking at.</p><p>There was Lady Creation, sitting there, looking as casual as ever under that tree, just reading, with the <a title="inspiration" href="https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2015/11/madagascar-red-owl.jpg" rel="nofollow">brightest red owl</a> he had ever seen in his life, with bright blue eyes and bespeckled wings.</p><p>Almost everyone had commented on the strange bird, who seemed to comprehend everything said to it and even try and respond before it remembered that it didn't speak a human language. Lady Creation simply told them it was an enchanted animal, one that had lived with the French side of her family for forever and was related to a phoenix.</p><p>Adrien recognized its general appearance as a Philippine Scops Owl, but if it's bright red feathers were any indication, he really couldn't say that the idea that this bird was related to a phoenix was completely false.</p><p>Adrien's own familiar, a grumpy black cat with bright green eyes (whom had also been in his family for forever and a half), leapt up onto his shoulder, balancing precariously before steading himself, staring at the girl with slow blinking eyes.</p><p>"She interest you, too, Plagg?" He asked, gently petting his scruff with his gloved fingers, a place he knew the cat liked. "I'm beginning to question just who this girl really is... she just... seems too good to be real. Like my perfect opposite, but I'm not sure how."</p>
<hr/><p>Adrien watched as Lady Creation performed a particularly difficult spell, her tongue poking out in a blep as she focused. It was possibly the most adorable thing he had ever seen, and he had been watching her practice this spell for nearly ten minutes now, but she just couldn't seem to get it right.</p><p>Their professor walked up with a proud smile on his face, but then furrowed his brow, his eyes looking right at her wand. He spoke up quietly, but Adrien's sharp hearing didn't miss it.</p><p>"Mademoiselle Dupain-Cheng, if I may ask, what is your wand made out of?"</p><p>Lady Creation looked down at her wand, blinking at it like it was the most normal thing ever and she was confused as to why she was being questioned about it, too.</p><p>"Ivory." She said, barely missing a beat, and he watched as the teacher and several students in listening vicinity paled, and he felt himself doing the same.</p><p>"L-Like... animal bones?" One of the girls stuttered, backing up slightly.</p><p>The ravnette nodded and tilted her head curiously at the girl. "Well, yeah. I mean, this is an old family wand from my mom's side - my wizarding ancestors, animal tamers, used it. My Chinese ancestors had elephants, after all. After one of their greatest bulls died in battle, they removed his tusks and carved them all into wands to give to the soldiers that fought alongside the bull, the ultimate memento of respect to the creature." She said as she looked down at the wand with a smile on her face. "It's one of six wands made from the great beast, making it one of the most rare kind of wand on the planet, but that isn't why I use it." She shrugged. "The wand had laid dormant for nearly a century, and my mom had left it out one day after praying to the ancestors, and I grabbed it. I was only four. The wand chose me as it's new companion right then and there, and to this day, they always look so proud when I pull it out. I never tried to pursue a wooden wand like most others my age. I like my wand."</p><p>A stifled laugh came from the girl sitting next to her, and Marinette looked over, furrowing her brow at her.</p><p>The girl giggled again and shook her head. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but, it's just - you called the wand your 'companion,' like it was some sort of living creature-"</p><p>"The wand <em>is</em> a living creature, or need I remind you that, unlike your wand, mine is made completely of once living animals and ancient, unintrusive magic? Not to mention that trees are living, sentient beings, if the Whomping Willow <em>on castle grounds</em> is any indication." She furrowed her brow at the girl, like she had said something to her that she simply expected the other to know. "The wand chooses whose magic it amplifies, not the other way the 'round. If the wand doesn't like its wielder, it refuses to work with them. Wands are just as living and sentient as you or your familiar, and to treat them as anything less than a companion is a disrespect to the thing that helps you channel your magic literally any time you have to perform it, and will hold back your magical prowess as long as you continue to do so."</p><p>Adrien muttered a spell under his breath, then watched as the glowing pink aura of Lady Creation's magic grew and expanded with her anger. Despite her calm voice, her magic showed she was practically fuming, and he watched the other auras around her shrunk in submission to her powerful magic. He didn't cower, though. He suddenly felt closer to this strange girl than he ever had before, and could only wonder how these people would react to her strangely passionate outburst.</p><p>As the girl's aura shrank, she seemed at a loss for a second, before smirking and crossing her arms. "Okay, so? What? You talk so big, like your wand's core is a phoenix feather or something special like that. Just because your wand is made of a thousand year old elephant tusk doesn't mean-"</p><p>"<em>Three thousand five hundred forty (3540) year old elephant tusk</em>, and my wand core is made of the eye-spotted tail of an animagus albino peacock who was revered as the Spirit of Guan Yin in my ancestor's homeland, <em>thank you very much</em>." The girl all but snarled, standing up abruptly. "Excuse me, professor, but I need to blow off some steam, and I would prefer to do it in a place where being a little <em>destructive</em> wouldn't damage anything important, like another person." She growled. Adrien glanced over and noticed her wand give off a strange aura of its own, and felt his skin crawl as she walked past him and out the door.</p><p>Her wand was essentially made of the bone of a magical creature and the soul of a witch or wizard, and while he had seen auras radiate off wands with owners that were particularly in touch with that side of wizardry, it was nothing like this. This wand, containing the souls of two very powerful and ancient creatures, had an aura that was frighteningly similar to a person's, and this aura was also angry, apparently as offended of the other girl's words as Lady Creation was.</p><p>And that's when it dawned on him on just why the two of them were perfect opposites.</p><p>Adrien was expected to be perfect all the time and felt that extreme pressure from his father <em>all</em> the time. He had lost a parent just before he got accepted into Hogwarts, had a streak of bad luck ever since she passed away, had a hard time making friends, and barely had any family heirlooms to speak of, despite being a pureblood.</p><p>But Ladybug, this beautiful, amazing, spitfire of a young woman - she was also expected to be perfect all the time, but she didn't care. She acted how she wanted to and was happy to surprise the people around her when she did something they thought was out of character, when, really, it wasn't. She wasn't proud of herself, didn't pride herself on the things she did, and seemed to simply enjoy sharing her accomplishments with the ones she cared about. She had a family, and was so proud of that <em>family</em>, not herself, that she didn't really care about material possessions that much. Instead, the material possessions she did care about had such deep and important meanings and history behind them that it often left people speechless. Her wand, her familiar, everything down to how she controlled her magic when sewing had a familial connection somehow.</p><p>She was so proud of her family and embraced everything about them, while he wished everyone would just forget that he was his father's son.</p>
<hr/><p>Adrien could only watch as this French-Chinese girl made large vines grow up from the earth, destroying the castle grounds and the flower beds, which she promptly repaired after sending the vines away, seeming content with the mild display of destruction, before conjuring something and using another set of vines to completely crush it, then vanished it all.</p><p>He had run out here on a whim, telling his professor that he was simply going to check to make sure she didn't accidentally hurt someone, even though he knew she wouldn't.</p><p>It seemed both her and her wand needed it, because their auras seemed to calm down, and she sighed, slumping on the ground. She looked at her wand, staring at it for a moment before smiling at it, and Adrien watched as the shimmering red-white aura of the wand reach out and wrap around her own silvery pink aura, and mix together in an unseen bond, one that could only be built on years of trust and communication.</p><p>His own wand, made of the wood of the poisonous Cypress, had seemed to surprise his peers who happened to have grown up on Wand Tree farms, but he simply felt that it was right. He had felt the sentience of his wand as soon as his fingers curled around it, especially with the graceful presence of the Dragon Heartstring core, taken from an illustrious Antipodean Opaleye that was said to be very social and bubbly creature before she passed away, or so her tamer said. He had always felt honored to have her in his possession, and even sometimes had wordless conversations that were passings of emotions. She was a brave and protective soul, something he was glad to have in his life. He agreed with this girl; the wands were sentient, and deserved the utmost respect. The souls of the wands were made of creatures far more noble than mere students would ever be, and he felt that his wand, in particular, deserved all the love she could get.</p><p>So after Lady Creation calmed down from her little fit, he walked over and sat down next to her, smiling softly at the raven-haired girl, who blinked at him curiously.</p><p>"Sorry." He murmured. "I just... came to make sure you were okay."</p>
<hr/><p><em>Marinette</em>.</p><p>That was her name.</p><p><em>Marinette</em>.</p><p>Adrien felt dazed in the best way.</p><p>They had a conversation that had lasted nearly an hour, and they had missed a class, but it had been completely worth it.</p><p>He got to find out her name, something that <em>no one</em> but the teachers knew yet. She had kept her name secret, a carefully guarded one at that. She mentioned something about how names held power in her family's culture, and she'd prefer not to give that power to the undeserving, but she liked him. More than she did other students there at Hogwarts.</p><p>The only real issue about this all?</p><p>Adrien had been very curious and attracted to her already, like a magnet tugging on him harder and harder until he finally gave in and let himself be pulled to her.</p><p>Now? He found out things that basically sealed the deal for him; he had a horrible crush on this girl from France, and he couldn't find it in himself to care.</p><p>He found out that she had noticed him before, very often (obviously, since he was in Hufflepuff and she was in Slytherin - their two houses supported each other, why wouldn't she know him? They both went to practically all the events), and even had a nickname for him; Chat Noir, or Black Cat, for his familiar and apparently his aura. He had never seen his own magic, and he was always curious about it. He had yet to perfect his spell for revealing magic, and was only ever able to see others' magic. She apparently had the same problem, and had proposed they work together to find a solution sometime. She described his magic as a green shadow; faded and bright in some spots, and pitch black in others, with the occasional blue sheen. She then remarked on his wand's aura, which looked opaline in nature, and, really, she wasn't wrong.</p><p>They found out little things about each other, like their favorite treats or places on castle grounds, and eventually set up a study session in the library.</p><p>All in all? It was a great day for Adrien, and he was already working on a new spell to show Marinette as a gift.</p>
