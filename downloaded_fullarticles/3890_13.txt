    <p>Firewhiskey is not your friend.</p>
<p>That charming piece of advice was originally heard from Hermione, who had snatched a cup full of said beverage out of his hand before replacing it with a Butterbeer, way back at the beginning of fifth year, during a Gryffindor party celebrating a spectacular win to start off the Hogwart's Quidditch season.</p>
<p>Harry was sincerely regretting forgetting those wise words as his vision swam. The last thing he could remember, he was drinking his third (fourth?) glass at the afterparty for his team's second consecutive win in the season. Luis Cromwell and Anastasia Boot, two of the three chasers, had cornered him in a booth in the small wizarding pub and kept him from even the hope of staying sober as they called for more Firewhiskey. Pretty Anastasia Boot with the long black hair and the mean right hook, had sat there and told him that he was the first decent seeker the team had had since she joined the team six years ago. Luis, meanwhile, had already been thoroughly drunk by the time he had latched onto Harry, and was half sobbing, half singing about how they were all so lucky that Harry chose to join the tiny, practically unknown team of the Greenwich Grims instead of the famous, big name teams he could've gotten in with his talents.</p>
<p>Harry hadn't felt comfortable enough to say he joined the team out of honor of his late godfather, and so had instead jokingly admitted he joined because the team's colors of grass green and black complimented his eyes.</p>
<p>His memory of the rest of the night is hazy at best and completely blank at worst. Long story short, he has no idea where he is or how he got here and the raging hangover is really not helping him figure it out.</p>
<p>Blindly palming his pocket revealed that he was currently wandless but thankfully fully clothed. Harry wasn't quite sure what he'd do if he had woken up sans clothes but it probably wouldn't have been pretty.</p>
<p>As his vision finally cleared for the most part, the teen took in the place he had awoke. It was small, for lack of a better word. Cramped, definitely. In fact, Harry would bet his broom that he had once more awoken in a cupboard. At least this cupboard was larger than the one under the stairs even if it seemed almost smaller due to the multitude of <em>stuff</em> within it.</p>
<p>Magical gadgets and doodads aplenty, a swinging hanging down lantern for light and absolutely no door in sight. How lovely.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't even name a quarter of the things in sight. He recognized a sneakoscope, a crystal ball, a remembrall, a witching glass and a foe glass, a fairy finder, a miniature diorama of the insides of a centaur, and what could very possibly be a withered and stuffed Jarvey carcass, but the rest was a mystery.</p>
<p>A loose scrap of paper hanging off a shelf caught his eye and he quickly grabbed it. On the yellow frayed paper written in what looked like half dried blood, sat a message clearly written for him.</p>
<p>
  <em>Holly and phoenix feather, 11 inches, expertly crafted. What a pretty little item to add to my collection. If you want it back, you must first find a few items within my collection and offer them in exchange.</em>
</p>
<p><em>1. That which swallows the light.</em><em></em><br/>
<em>2. That which cannot be broken.</em><br/>
<em>3. That which was born but never lived.</em><br/>
<em>4. That which lived but was never born.</em><br/>
<em>5. That which is loudest before and after silence.</em><br/>
<em>6. That which cannot be forgotten by the one who lost it.</em><br/>
<em>7. That which brings happiness in suffering.</em></p>
<p>
  <em>Once you collect all seven, place them in the rune circle on the ground. If you chose the right items, your wand will be returned to you and the path forward will open. However if you chose the wrong items, be warned that the loss of your wand will be the least of your worries.</em>
</p>
<p>A riddle. Great, just great. Harry had only managed to get inside the Ravenclaw Tower five times within the entirety of his Hogwart's years, despite knowing it's location since second year. Riddles were not Harry's expertise. Where's Hermione when you need her?</p>
<p>After several minutes of cursing and fumbling and rubbing his eyes to alleviate his migraine, Harry got to work trying to puzzle out which objects went with which hint.</p>
<p>After an inordinate amount of time trapped within a cramped cupboard, Harry was left looking over the items he had placed in the rune circle and was ready to activate it. He just hoped to whoever was out there that he had chosen the right objects out of the hoard.</p>
<p>That which swallows the light, a cloak made out of lethifold skin. That which cannot be broken, a celtic knot made out of thestral tail hairs. That which was born but never lived, a disgusting jar of a grindylow fetus. That which lived but was never born, a charmed mouse that was permanently transfigured from what was probably a couch pillow (an almost unheard of piece of powerful magic that would have Hermione drooling). That which is loudest before and after silence, a stuffed carcass of a Jobberknoll (the collection's owner must be a fan of taxidermy as it and the Jarvey were barely the beginning of the amount of stuffed dead animals Harry found). That which cannot be forgotten by the one who lost it, a severed hand that had Harry gagging as he touched it. And last but not least, that which brings happiness in suffering, a hat charmed with a nasty hex that reversed emotions (Dean, who had become a trainee mediwizard had mentioned the hex once in regards to a very temporary cure for depression and suicidal behavior).</p>
<p>With a harsh breath the smelt of stale alcohol, Harry reached down and pressed bot hands palm down on the outer edges of the circle before <em>willing</em> his magic to flow into the runes. Each one lit up, the dust caking the cupboard floor rising up with the magical pressure before each item within the circle disappeared at once, replaced with a very familiar and welcomed sight.</p>
<p>Seven years of having his wand almost always in constant contact with him made the lack of it almost physically painful. It was a relief to pick up his wand and feel the phantom phoenix fire burst throughout his veins. Small golden sparks emitted from the wand tip, much like how it had when he was eleven and first introduced to magic. His wand had apparently missed him too.</p>
<p>The runes continued glowing, however and the light spread along cracks in the floor to the edges of one of the shelves. Wary, Harry gripped his wand tighter before wrestling up his old Gryffindor courage and pushing on the glowing shelf. The shelf quite easily swung out and opened up to a narrow and short hallway with a door at the end. With only a quick glance back at the cramped space he had spent the past few hours digging through junk in, Harry inched down the hallway with his hand clenched tight around his wand in anticipation for something to happen.</p>
<p>As if to spite him, nothing at all jumped out or moved or appeared from nowhere and before he knew it he was in front of the door.</p>
<p>The door was pure metal with no handle or knob, the only decoration another frayed yellow note for Harry and a red handprint painted on under it.</p>
<p>
  <em>You who have been Chosen, continue on if you want a chance to win.</em>
</p>
<p>That was it. That was all the note said in the writing that still looked more like blood than ink. No new riddle or clue to open the door. Just a cryptic statement that said absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>First of all, he was <em>Chosen</em>? Chosen for what? By who? And a chance to win <em>what</em>?</p>
<p>Harry certainly had no idea and he honestly didn't want to know. He just wanted to be back at Grimmauld and have Regulus lecture him on the dangers of getting drunk in public places. It would be a lot more comforting than creepy notes and riddles and taxidermic animals and <em>severed hands</em>.</p>
<p>A small panic attack later Harry was staring at the handprint. It was a right hand and directly under the note speaking of continuing on. Transferring his wand to his left hand, Harry threw caution to the wind and pressed his right over the imprint.</p>
<p>Much like the runes of before, the handprint lit up in bright light, only this time it nearly blinded him and brought his headache back in ferocious tenacity. What was worse than his pounding head however was the pain of his hand. It felt like he had stuck his hand into an open fire or on a stove burner again (Aunt Petunia in a certain fit of nastiness had held his hand on one for a few seconds when he was five, he had never wanted to feel that pain again).</p>
<p>Within a few more seconds the light died down as did his startled pained scream, and the metal door slowly opened up with a long and loud <em>creak</em>. Harry immediately snatched his hand away and inspected it for the burn he was sure would be there.</p>
<p>Instead of the expected third degree burn, his hand was clear except for a black mark on his palm. It looked much like a muggle tattoo, black and unmoving. It was a mark of the front half of a snake with jaws wide open to strike while on the back half of the snake, the scales turn into lightning streaks. It was pretty in a macabre way but in no way would it be something Harry wanted permanently etched on his palm.</p>
<p>A quick curling and uncurling of his fingers to check for sure that his hand wasn't damaged and Harry was ready to leave this hallway behind him. The mark could be investigated later, for now he had a way out and out was what he wanted.</p>
<p>The door quickly slammed behind him once he was passed it. Harry made sure to give it the most unimpressed scowl he could make, which was pretty unimpressed considering he had learned it from Snape.</p>
<p>He was now in another hallway that branched off left and right and then branched off again. Remembering the handy little 'hug the right' trick he learned in primary to escape mazes hand him going right, then right again, and then right <em>again</em> into a open room.</p>
<p>The room was mostly empty other than a couple of crates lying around. As Harry had always possessed the curiosity of a cat despite the trouble it always landed him, he couldn't help himself in opening them up and taking a look.</p>
<p>One of the four crates was filled with tablecloths and was immediately abandoned. Another was filled with loose nails, screws, buttons, and keys and was similarly abandoned. The next one was filled halfway with empty charmed backpacks and satchels. Harry took a small brown leather pack with an extremely large space charm and a featherlight. It could come in handy and he deserved something for this ordeal.</p>
<p>It was the last crate that had him pausing. It was completely empty other than a hunting knife and a muggle handgun. Harry took the knife without problem and stuck it in his backpack but the gun... Harry had never even seen a real gun before. Sure he knew how they worked vaguely, Dudley was fond of shows on the telly with excessive violence, but he didn't know if it was smart to take it. His decision was made as he cautiously picked it up and remembered that he <em>wanted to get out of whatever hellhole he had fallen in</em>.</p>
<p>So after tucking the gun into his pack, Harry left the room and continued following the right.</p>
<p>Three more hallways and five more rooms (from which a few rolls of bandages, some water bottles, and a handful of unbreakable empty potion vials were added to his pack), and Harry turned another right only to run headfirst into a very defined (and rather painful) chin.</p>
<p>The teen muttered a curse before looking at what, or rather who, he had ran into. It was an older man, a few years older than him, who was rubbing his chin and glaring at Harry with rather intimidating red-brown eyes.</p>
<p>He was wearing a fancy black muggle suit without the vest and tie, which looked unfairly good on him but struck Harry as almost <em>wrong</em>. He had seen this man before, he was sure of that, but it was <em>not</em> in muggle clothes.</p>
<p>Apparently his staring had taken too long as the familiar stranger backed up further from the teen, face showing clear disgust, as he snarled somehow elegantly, "Of course the first person I run into would be a drunken slob."</p>
<p>Harry blinked once, twice before looking down at himself to compare. Yes, he could see how the man came to that conclusion with the stale smell of Firewhiskey coating his clothing and breath. His shirt was green with a black grim on the front, a trademarked shirt of his team he got for free. It and his black jeans were crinkled beyond belief with dirt and dust covering them, but what could be expected after sleeping on a dirty cupboard floor.</p>
<p>Compared to the man and his perfectly neat hair and perfect clothes and perfect <em>perfectness</em>, Harry most definitely resembled a drunken slob. Even their shoes showed a clear divide between them, with Harry's worn trainers and Mr. Perfect's shiny black boots.</p>
<p>Deciding to try to make amends (this was the first person he had ran into too and he would rather have the company in this labyrinth), Harry quickly began babbling, waving his arms in front of him.</p>
<p>"I'm not usually-- That is I was just, uh," a quick drop of the hands to his side, face burning in shame, before he thrusted his right hand out in front of the man's chest to shake, "I'm Harry. Potter that is. Harry Potter."</p>
<p>The stranger's unamused stare began to make him sweat before the red-brown eyes were focused intently upon his right hand. Or more specifically, his right palm. The man's own hand came up, not shake the proffered hand but to take it to clinically inspect it.</p>
<p>A long finger traced the lines of the mark, up and down the half-snake, half-lightning's body, and Harry only just managed to keep a shudder down. Something about the mark itself was incredibly intimate and the man in particular touching just seemed-- not <em>wrong</em>, per se, (it felt very, <em>very right</em>, in fact) but too intimate to be comfortable. It was as if the man's very magic itself was tracing his palm.</p>
<p>Then the stranger turned his own hand palm up and Harry's eyes widened in shock. There beside his own hand was this strange well dressed man's, with the exact same mark etched on his palm. The black marking seemed almost darker on the man's paler hand.</p>
<p>"Where did you get this mark."</p>
<p>It was not stated as a question. That was a demand if Harry ever heard one. He could feel his imaginary feathers being ruffled and took a steadying breath not to go all righteous Gryffindor with a bone to pick as Hermione liked to call it.</p>
<p>"I got it when the handprint on the metal door burned me," he finally brought himself to say, a strained smile on his face. It wouldn't do to punch Mr. Perfect with the not so perfect attitude in his very perfect face.</p>
<p>"What an... apt retelling," the man drawled back, and by Merlin did he take classes with Snape on how to talk? Because that answer was definitely in Snape territory, only the perfectly smooth and velvety (and is this guy even real?) voice being a key difference.</p>
<p>"So," he grinned up at the maybe-not-real man, "How did you get yours?"</p>
<p>After all the quickest way to unnerve Snape was a joyous and happy Harry. Maybe the same tactics would work on Mr. Perfect.</p>
<p>Apparently not as the stranger didn't so much as twitch before promptly answering, "Much the same," before turning away to continue on his way.</p>
<p>Harry was left to blink at the retreating back in astonishment. Was Harry's presence that unwanted that the man wouldn't stick to the only person he has met in this maze? Didn't a group have a better chance of survival in these sort of situations than a lone person? Well that's other than a food supply shortage but even then cannibalism is on the table. The point is that teaming up is a really good option and Harry's only chance is <em>walking away.</em></p>
<p>"Wait!" he cried, running to catch up with the man's long and purposeful strides, "We should stick together."</p>
<p>Red-brown (maroon maybe?) eyes slid to stare blankly at Harry for a moment before returning to the hallway as they took a right turn that Harry hadn't been down yet (it was on the left side when he was walking down the hallway after all).</p>
<p>"And just what could a partnership with you offer me?"</p>
<p>The question was very much sarcastic and Harry had to remind himself that yes, he did look like more of a slob than Ron after a breakup, so he shouldn't take offense.</p>
<p>All he could offer up was was a half grin and a, "Two heads are better than one?" that definitely sounded more like a question than a statement. Considering the annoyed glance he received in reply, the stranger didn't think much of the offer.</p>
<p>Eager to stay with the only person he met, Harry quickly reached in his bag and retrieved a water bottle to be inspected, with a quick, "And I have quite a few of these."</p>
<p>That, at least, seemed to be a good enough reason to let Harry tag along as the man gave a small nod of acceptance before giving a short, "Tom Riddle," which took Harry a few seconds to realize was Mr. Perfect's name.</p>
<p>The name rang a number of bells in Harry's brain and the puzzle of who Tom Riddle was kept Harry from feeling awkward due to the prolonged silence between the pair.</p>
<p>After a good half hour of rummaging through crates in silence and looking for a way out, Harry finally placed the face and name to a person in his memory. Tom Riddle was the Head Boy in Harry's fourth year. The Slytherin and the younger Gryffindor had only met a handful of times, mainly during night patrols where Harry would be swiftly given detention and sent on his way to bed. The last time Harry had seen Riddle was when the upcoming fifth year prefects were called up to the Headmaster's office for a meeting with the graduating prefects to pass on knowledge and tips of their upcoming role.</p>
<p>Honestly Tom Riddle was expected to go exceedingly far by the Hogwarts populace so when he just completely dropped off the map after graduation it caused a bit of a stir. Harry himself hadn't really bothered with the gossip about the former prefect but even he had to admit a small curiosity for the other muggle raised orphan. Of course, it being his OWL year, the teen had quickly forgot the older boy and never thought of him again. It was weird to see him older and in a muggle suit.</p>
<p>Harry watched idly as said man placed another can of preserved fruit in his magically expanded fanny pack. The fact that Tom Riddle was wearing a fanny pack was slightly hilarious in his hysterical mind but he made it work with the rest of his odd magical utility belt.</p>
<p>Harry was immensely glad he had found a crate of backpacks instead.</p>
<p>Just as the teen was gathering his courage to try to make small talk with his stoic companion, a loud chime echoed throughout the area. Harry's wand was immediately in his hand and Riddle looked just as tensed to spring.</p>
<p>
  <em> <b>"Welcome all of you who have been Chosen."</b> </em>
</p>
<p>The voice that was coming from every direction was simultaneously young and old, raspy and clear, masculine and feminine. Harry's stomach roiled in unease.</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>"I shall be your host for the indefinite future. I go by many names but you all may simply call me Death."</em> </b>
</p>
<p>Riddle's face was a mixture of perseverance, seriousness, and the same unease Harry himself felt though much better hidden.</p>
<p>Death? As in Death Death? Harry knows some old families of wizards worship gods and aspects of life, but just like with muggle religions, Harry hadn't ever had much faith in anything except himself and his own power to look after his life.</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>"You have each been Chosen to play a game. My game. Death's Game. The goal is to simply survive until the end."</em> </b>
</p>
<p>That wasn't ominous at all. And Harry really wished he could send in a formal complaint because he most certainly did not agree to play.</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>"The prize for winning is the granting of a wish of your choosing by me, Death."</em> </b>
</p>
<p>A wish? From Death? Harry wasn't sure he even had a wish in mind to ask of a deity presiding over the dead but he wasn't sure he liked the fervent light that entered his companion's eyes at the words.</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>"My game, despite it's ultimate simplicity, will not be easy. But do not be afraid, you shall have help if you so wish it."</em> </b>
</p>
<p>Help would be great, thanks. Harry just wants to leave this whole nightmare behind and wake up in his bed.</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>"Upon each of your right hands is a mark you have been assigned. Your mark is a physical representation of a magical bond. It connects you to your partner in this game. Find your partner, work together, and you have a chance to win."</em> </b>
</p>
<p>The teen let out an audible gasp before quickly turning to the older man. Riddle's eyes were also on him, studying his every inch as if to see something he had previously overlooked. Harry suddenly wasn't quite sure if his supposed help would be very helpful.</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>"A last piece of advice before I leave you all to your own devices. When the path in front of you looks bleak and you are on your own to face your fate, look for a handprint like the one that marked you and you may find an answer you like."</em> </b>
</p>
<p>That was a clue, Harry could tell that. But just what it meant went clear over his head. Riddles, as stated previously, were not Harry's expertise.</p>
<p>
  <b> <em>"That is all for now. Until we meet again, good luck."</em> </b>
</p>
<p>And with that, the previous chill and stillness that was in the air promptly vanished, only leaving questions and confusion in its wake.</p>
<p>"So," Harry began, green eyes staring into red-brown in worry before continuing on hesitantly, "What did that all mean, do you think?"</p>
<p>The man's eyes continued his previous surveyal before a slow smirk snaked across his perfect face.</p>
<p>"It appears that we are partners in this game."</p>
<p>Yes, thank you, Harry got that. The teen shifted from one foot to the next before trying to give a smile that felt more like a grimace and giving a lame, "Right."</p>
<p>Riddles were definitely <em>not</em> Harry's expertise.</p>
