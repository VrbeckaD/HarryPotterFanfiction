<p>It was a normal day on Privet Drive in Little Whinging. Kids were playing at the playground down the road, owls were flying about unnoticed. Vernon, a short, fat, middle-aged man pulled into his driveway whistling to himself some tunes on his way home form work excited for dinner.</p>
<p><em>Hopefully the little brat didn’t burn the chicken this time. Oh, and he better have my afternoon tea steeped and ready while I wait for dinner</em><em>.</em> This never happened though, and Vernon seemed to think that this justification he does everyday in the driveway made it alright to belittle and verbally attack the young nine-year-old Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Once Vernon opened the door, he glared around waiting for his daily queue after work. Petunia, his wife and Harry’s aunt, scurried to the door to kiss her husband on the cheek and grab his jumper.</p>
<p>“How was work darling?” She asked in her high-pitched tone sneaking glances at Dudley while pretending to care about her husband’s day.</p>
<p>“It was alright. Harry! Where is my tea!?” Vernon demanded, his queue had come, and it was time to enjoy himself, he thought walking over to his recliner.</p>
<p>“It’s coming uncle Vernon, I just finished making it for you.” Harry replied in a soft tone walking over towards his uncle trying not to tip over the kettle and teacup.</p>
<p>A knock at the door jolted Harry’s hand making him spill the tea that he was currently carrying and dropping the teacup onto the floor shattering it.</p>
<p>“Boy must you be so useless!” The fat middle aged man spat as a response to the spilt tea  and shard of glass on the splayed on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>“Sorry uncle I’ll clean it up.” Harry responded back in a soft voice quickly setting down the kettle and grabbing a sweeper to pick up the shards of glass.</p>
<p><em>Why must I be so useless? No one likes me around here. I just don’t understand why they keep me here if they don’t want me, it’s not like I have any friends I can go to for them to get a break</em>. Harry thought, making sure he picked up every piece of glass off the floor.</p>
<p>A second knock came at the door again, once again making Harry jump. He has been a bit jumpy lately since the incident last week. He did not want to have another evening play out like that again.</p>
<p>“Who is knocking at our door! We were not expecting any visitors!” Vernon spat, grumbling to himself as he got out of his chair and went to the door.</p>
<p> “My boy, how much you have grown since I have last seen you.” The long-bearded man said with a smile on his face looking at Dudley who couldn’t care less about what was currently going on besides the tele.</p>
<p>“Errrm I’m Harry?” Harry said looking at the man with a halfcocked head.</p>
<p>“Oh. I’m sorry Harry. I should have known with your emerald green eyes, just like your mothers.” The man smiled pushing past Vernon who gestured at him.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry sir, but do I know you?” Harry stuttered as if he was going to be in trouble for not knowing who the man is.</p>
<p>Out of shock the old man around with an almost visible aura of fiery anger, “You muggles didn’t tell this boy anything?”</p>
<p>“We hoped you would never show up again.” Petunia spat in disgust at the man.</p>
<p>“You mean he knows nothing of who he is? Who his parents were? Anything about his family? Magic? Hogwarts?” The man yelled, his voice reverberating through the house.</p>
<p>Vernon started to argue; however, the old man was done with these inept muggles, he waved his hand and Harry’s belongings appeared beside him.</p>
<p>“Whoa!” Harry exclaimed with a grin on his face full of excitement.</p>
<p>“Come along Harry, I’ll explain everything to you once we get to Remus’ place in Scotland.” Harry thinking anywhere besides the place he currently resided in was better he grabbed the hold of Dumbledore’s arm as he instructed him to do, and with a crack they were gone from Privet Drive.</p>
<p>With another crack Harry and Dumbledore appeared on the doorstep of the boy’s parent’s best friend and more people awaiting their arrival.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about the sickness, it eases with time Harry.” Dumbledore noted knocking on the gray front door. “Now Harry-”, Dumbledore began to add before the door swung open and a slinky man with matted hair answered.</p>
<p>“Welcome Dumbledore, and you must be Harry!” Remus greeted the two of them with a big smile.</p>
<p>“Ah Remus, yes this is Harry. Harry this is Remus, one of your godfathers.” He gestured toward Harry to enter the home that lead into the living room almost immediately.</p>
<p>Harry, even at his young age, took in the house. The front door opened up to a foyer with a small staircase up to a second floor. To the right of the foyer was the living room which he noticed had three different people standing and staring at him. Out of feeling uncomfortable Harry looked to the left of him noticing a hallway which seemed to lead to a kitchen and a room that was probably an office like uncle Vernon’s.</p>
<p>“Um, Dumbledore? Is there any way I could speak to you privately? I just am a little overwhelmed and confused. You said you would explain everything to me once we got here.” Harry looked at Dumbledore as if he was a puppy being kicked around.</p>
<p>“Yes of course, follow me.” Dumbledore gestured heading into the hallway that lead to the kitchen. “I have been having someone watch you, so I know you don’t get to eat often. Are you hungry?” The old man already opening up the fridge. Harry nodded as if ashamed and sat down at the island that was placed in the middle of the kitchen with bar-stool chairs.</p>
<p><em>He says that he knows I don’t get fed very often, does he know about what happened last week with uncle Vernon? Does everyone here know and that’s why there are so many of them? I have read about this, it’s called an intervention. </em>Harry usually liked to think to himself, it calmed him down in situations like now.</p>
<p>“Harry, there is a lot of information I need to tell you and a lot of it you may not understand. Let’s start off with your parents my dear boy. There is this evil man in our world, the wizarding world. He goes by the name of Voldemort, he was supposed to have been killed the night you got that scar on your forehead. Your mom and dad were part of a secret organization that fought against this evil man and his followers.” Dumbledore continued on about the night that his parents died, Harry had tears streaming down his face, but Dumbledore knew that he had the right to know everything, even if he couldn’t truly understand everything at this moment.</p>
<p>After an hour of describing who Voldemort was, who the bad men were, his parents’ deaths, Dumbledore spoke once again, “Harry. The only safe place you possibly could be was your aunt and uncle’s, no matter the way they treated you. However, with the events that occurred last week that broke the safety of that place. You were no longer safe there, this means you have a choice of your own.” With a gentle smile Dumbledore grabbed the empty plate and glass Harry had used setting them into the sink.</p>
<p><em>I get to make my own choice? I’ve never done that before. What if I make the wrong one? Won’t uncle Vernon be mad at me if I choose to leave his home, leave being his servant? </em>Harry didn’t know what to make of the situation. He was given the choice to stay at his uncle’s, live in the house he currently was in, or at a place called Hogwarts. <em>What am I supposed to do?</em></p>
<p>“Give some thought to it Harry. But right now, let’s go meet your family.” With that the two walked into the living room where everyone was chatting and smiling. <em>Happiness</em>, Harry thought.</p>
