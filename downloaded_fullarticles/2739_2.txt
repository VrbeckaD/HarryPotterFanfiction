          <div class="userstuff"><p>Gather 'round me lads and lasses: sit ye for a time,<br/>
And harken to me bawdy tale of two lads quite sublime.<br/>
I'll tell ye of their exploits, 'round Hogwarts oh so grand,<br/>
It all be true, I'm tellin' you that none of it was planned.</p>
<p>The first one's name is Potter: a right delightful boy,<br/>
He's seldom off his Quidditch broom 'cause it's his favourite toy.<br/>
Disaster of a haircut, and a scar upon his head,<br/>
And if you point these out to him he rather goes quite red.</p>
<p>The second one is Malfoy: of pureblood does he be,<br/>
He loves to eat green apples whilst he's perched up in a tree.<br/>
Looks rather like a ferret, behaves like quite a prat,<br/>
But if you ask our Harry, well, he's quite OK with that.</p>
<p><em>Ah gee, Harry: how much do you fancy</em><br/>
<em>That boy, Malfoy: he really is quite fine.</em><br/>
<em> Ginny Weasley: she's your girlfriend currently,</em><br/>
<em> But will you up and leave her only for another man?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Often they'd be found a-trading insults in the hall,<br/>
Or pining looks at lunchtime; all their friends this did appal.<br/>
As long hot-headed rivals, despite the horrid war;<br/>
T'was plain to all of us that that there was maybe something more.</p>
<p>Miss Weasley spotted our two lads out in the Castle's ground,<br/>
And tracked them like a bloodhound though she nary made a sound.<br/>
Spied Malfoy snoggin' Potter, pressed up against a tree;<br/>
And shot a nasty hex at them, and from the scene did flee.</p>
<p>With ire on the Quidditch pitch, they play a crackin' match,<br/>
The sexual tension in the air would give ye a wet snatch.<br/>
Post match in Quidditch showers: front of Malfoy, Potter knelt,<br/>
It be quite strange, how time has changed, the way that they once felt.</p>
<p><em>Ginny Weasley: Salty she must surely be. </em><br/>
<em>Ah gee, Harry: What 'ave ye gone an' done?</em><br/>
<em> Oh boy, Malfoy: Sneaky tactics you've deployed,</em><br/>
<em> To get your hands on Potter, and your cock inside his mouth!</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now all about the Castle's halls no flat surface be safe:<br/>
For on the classroom tables Malfoy's back does surely chafe.<br/>
As Harry yells out 'fucking hell' and comes in Malfoy's arse,<br/>
McGonners barged into the room to prep her Transfig Class.</p>
<p>'I'll hex off both yer bawbags!' McGonners screeched in pique,<br/>
Exactly what she meant, they knew: the option rather bleak.<br/>
They fled the room quite quickly, robes trailing off their arms,<br/>
And drop'd, a sock, a shoe, some pants, but saved their Lucky Charms.</p>
<p>They now do spend a lot o' time a-shaggin' in the bed,<br/>
The sight of which is quite enough to fill ye full o' dread.<br/>
A thought, spare for the house elves who have the sheets to clean,<br/>
Another for their dorm-mates when they hear ol' Malfoy scream.</p>
<p><em>Morning glory: Potter will quite sorry be. </em><br/>
<em>Egads, the lads: just how much did they hear?</em><br/>
<em> The spells—Oh hells! Silencio for Malfoy's yells,</em><br/>
<em> He really is quite vocal with a cock shoved up his arse!</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And now that they're together, but in perfect happiness,<br/>
Pure hearts of gold and silver, you will find within their chests.<br/>
It's not for me to question how fate doth spread her charms,<br/>
But only to be happy that they're in each other's arms.</p>
<p><em>Ah gee, Harry: we all knew you fancied</em><br/>
<em>That boy, Malfoy: though he's still a prat.</em><br/>
<em> Ginny Weasley: was your girlfriend previously,</em><br/>
<em> And now she's dating Lovegood, and we're all OK with that!</em></p></div>
