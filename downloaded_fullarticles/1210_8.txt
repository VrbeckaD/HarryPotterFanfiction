    <p>Susan Amelia Bones took a deep breath and hitched her backpack over one shoulder. Her ponytail was lumpy, her cardigan had pills, and the sole of her left boot was about to come detached. But she’d never been happier. The plants had responded well to the potion she’d brewed and she was going to Michael’s for dinner. Her life couldn’t have been better.</p><p>“Bye, Louise!” she called to her lab manager. The older witch looked up from her seedlings and nodded. Susan hoped she’d remember to eat dinner. But Fred would be calling for her around six, the way he always did; he knew his wife got pulled into her work and couldn’t quite free herself. Susan smiled at Louise’s bent head. </p><p>She headed to the office Floo—she’d never been quite able to manage apparition after the splinch—and threw a handful of powder in. </p><p>“Seventy-four Beckham Lane,” she called into the fireplace as she stepped inside. A few seconds later, she was tumbling out onto Michael’s rug. The flat was silent. He must be out, even though they’d planned on getting dinner together. He’d said the dinner was important. Maybe he was out getting flowers. Or even a ring? They’d only been together a year and a half, but Susan’s had two toothbrushes and a drawer in Michael’s dresser. </p><p>She flopped down on his sagging couch and picked some of the pills off her sweater. Michael didn’t really care what she looked liked—once he’d said she looked comfortable. And that was a good thing, she thought. Because she was comfortable. </p><p>Then Susan heard something. A sort of squeaking? Untangling her legs, she rose. It sounded like it was coming from Michael’s bedroom. Maybe his rat (Cheeseball, she thought, and rolled her eyes at the name) needed some more water. She bent, unlaced her boots, and left them by the Floo. He was always so particular. She’d never noticed it at Hogwarts, but over the past six months he’d become more and more tidy. Or rather, he wanted her to be more tidy. He didn’t seem to mind his own idiosyncratic methods of laundry or dishwashing. But Susan’s stuff was always in the way, or she’d spilled something onto the carpet and even though she’d clean it with magic, Michael would pout. </p><p>She padded in her wool socks down the hardwood hallway and paused. The squeaking was getting louder. And there was thumping?</p><p>Susan pushed open the door and stopped.</p><p>There was Michael, long pale back with dimples right above his bum, and his floppy golden hair—and he was clearly fucking whoever was on the bed.</p><p>Who was definitely not Susan.</p><p>“Oh, Corner,” the woman on the bed moaned. “Fuck.”</p><p>Susan cleared her throat.</p><p>Michael’s head whipped around and the blood drained from his face. </p><p>“Susan—” he said, pulling himself out of the person on the bed, who sat up and Susan saw quite clearly that it was Pansy Parkinson. Who she hadn't seen since Hogwarts. </p><p>She’s quite pretty, Susan thought, and felt very far away. </p><p>“Corner, what the fuck?” Pansy said. “You said you weren’t seeing anyone.” She began searching for her clothes among the bedding. The bedding that Susan had just washed with a lavender detergent she’d picked up at the muggle farmer’s market. </p><p>Michael’s head whipped back and forth between the two of them.  </p><p>“Sus, I can explain—Pansy, don’t go.”</p><p>Pansy had pulled on her skirt and stood there, glaring at Michael. She wasn’t wearing a top. Susan shivered.</p><p>“Fuck you, Corner,” Pansy said. “You don’t get either of us.” She pulled on a sweater, grabbed Susan’s hand, and dragged her down the hallway.</p><p>Susan wasn’t quite sure if she approved of this, but she seemed unable to open her mouth.</p><p>Michael ran down the hall after them while attempting to pull on a pair of pants and he crashed into the wall while yelling their names. He skittered out into the living room as Pansy pushed Susan gently onto the couch. </p><p>Susan was floating. </p><p>Pansy kicked her boots closer to her. </p><p>She reached towards them, but her fingers felt numb. It felt like she was dying. Her heart hurt. Like, it agonizingly ached and pounded and it was going to kill her, but she couldn’t say anything because her throat had closed up as well. </p><p>“I was going to break up with her,” she heard Michael saying as he reached for Pansy’s hand. “She’s so boring and good and you’re—”</p><p>“Don’t fucking touch me, Corner,” Pansy yelled, yanking her hand back. “And don’t fucking drag Susan into this. You’re a piece of shit.” </p><p>Susan sat on the couch. </p><p>“Right,” Pansy said, and grabbed Susan’s boots and Susan’s arm and steered her into the Floo. </p><p>Then they were somewhere that was quite warm, and Susan saw the ground coming towards her very quickly and then it went black.</p>
<hr/><p>When she came to, she turned her head into soft white carpet. It was very quiet here. But she could hear two people arguing. Susan closed her eyes again. Maybe this nightmare would be over soon and she’d just wake up. </p><p>	She felt a shadow pass over her and smelled a spicy perfume. <em>Fine</em>, she thought. <em>In for a penny, in for a pound. </em></p><p>	Pansy Parkinson was kneeling over her, wand out. Susan didn’t even scramble backwards. </p><p>	<em>If she wants revenge, fine, </em>she thought abstractly. <em>I won’t be the last of the Bones to die at the hands of a Parkinson. </em></p><p>	But Pansy just sighed and tucked her wand back into her sleeve. “Phew, glad you’re awake,” she said, sitting back on her heels. Susan took a moment to sit up, pushing herself back against the white leather couch. </p><p>	“Juice?” she continued, as though Susan were a welcome visitor. At Susan’s nod, she levitated a glass of pumpkin juice over. Susan gripped it tightly and hoped she wouldn’t drop it all over this nice white carpet. She took a sip. It didn’t taste off. </p><p>	There were long-acting poisons. Aunt Amelia would have told her to check. But she wasn’t even quite sure where her wand was. </p><p>	Pansy gestured towards her backpack. “Do you want your wand?”</p><p>	<em>Is she a Legilimens? </em>Susan shook her head and kept drinking her juice. It was fresh. </p><p>	Pansy was sitting on her heels, picking absently at her fishnet stockings and twirling her rings. Susan could tell she was trying not to watch her. But Pansy kept flicking her lined eyes up towards Susan and then flicking them away. </p><p>	As though Susan wouldn’t notice. Her blood started to get a bit hot. Fucking her boyfriend was one thing, but thinking she was a fucking idiot? </p><p>	“So,” Susan said at last, setting the empty glass down on what looked like it was once Pansy’s school trunk. “How come you were fucking Michael?”</p><p>	Pansy’s face paled. </p><p>	“I’m so, so, so sorry,” she whispered. “I had no idea he had a girlfriend. He said the two of you were together at Hogwarts but you’d broken up a few months ago because you wanted to get a masters in Herbology in Sheffield and he’d gone to work for the Ministry, and—”</p><p>	Susan tilted her head. She seemed actually sorry. </p><p>	“How long has it been going on?” She felt quite clinical. She had to know when she’d have to go back to and cut out her own memories. Her own heart.</p><p>	Pansy chewed on her bottom lip. She had red lipstick on her teeth when she opened her mouth to talk again. “Three weeks?”</p><p>	Susan hummed slightly and said, “Where are my boots?”</p><p>	Pansy scrambled to her feet. “They’re right there, near your rucksack.” She pulled her skirt down at the hem and backed away from Susan. <em>Like she was scared. </em></p><p>	Susan leaned forward and pushed herself to her feet, and then the world wobbled a bit and Pansy was screaming and then there were four sets of hands pushing her back onto the white couch and putting her legs up and someone else was putting a cold cloth on her forehead and then she was slowly coming back and blinked and realized that Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were tending to her. </p><p>	<em>Have I fallen through some rabbit hole? </em>She wondered and blinked up at both of them.</p><p>	“Yes,” she said, apropos of nothing.</p><p>	They exchanged looks. </p><p>	“I’m fine,” she said, but didn’t feel like moving would be a good idea.</p><p>	“Susan,” Draco Malfoy said slowly, “I think you’re having a vasovagal reaction. It’s completely fine and normal in—” he glared at Pansy— “stressful situations. Your body has decided to shut down a bit, and now you just need to rest and drink some liquids.”</p><p>	Pansy was back to gnawing at her lip, and she rushed off and returned with another glass of pumpkin juice and another of water. They had an argument back and forth about straws (“Draco, we don't have straws! Are you sure she needs one?” “She’ll spill it all down her front, you daft cow. Just transfigure something!”) and then Draco Malfoy was helping Susan sit up slightly and placing a straw between her lips. </p><p>	She drank the juice and the water and stared at them.</p><p>	Draco looked mostly the same. His hair was less shellacked. But his chin was still pointy and he hadn’t grown into his ears. He wasn’t very attractive. But he did have calming hands, Susan thought, as he replaced the cold towel on her neck. </p><p>	She took another look at Pansy, who was chewing on her lip again. Morgana, it would be bloody at this rate. </p><p>	She couldn’t find it in her head to feel any kind of anger at the other woman. The Other Woman. She couldn’t even really be angry at Michael. He was apparently a tosser who had tricked her into believing that she was enough. Which she clearly wasn’t. Not for him. Not, like, in general. She was definitely enough.</p><p>	Susan blinked slowly and took the biscuit Draco proffered her.</p><p>	“How do you know about vas … er, whatever … reactions, Malfoy?” she said at last. </p><p>	He looked down and blushed a bit. “I’m studying to be a nurse.” There was a pause. “A Muggle nurse.”</p><p>	Susan’s eyebrows raised.</p><p>	“I know,” Pansy said with an eyeroll. “Literally the most unlikely person to be a nurse. He’s gotten this whole savior-complex now, well, maybe since forever, but now it’s like, weirdly coming out in this way—”</p><p>“Pansy, shut up!” Draco hissed.</p><p> “That’s nice,” Susan said at last. “Going to do some good, then.”</p><p>Draco shrugged and handed her another biscuit. “Want a cup of tea?” She nodded and he padded away, into the kitchen.</p><p>Pansy had perched herself on the arm of the sofa. Susan looked a bit closer and could see that her eyes were red. </p><p>“Live here together?” </p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Susan rubbed the edge of her cardigan between two fingers. “Are you like, dating?”</p><p>Pansy let out a short bark of a laugh. “Bones, no, Draco’s very gay. And I’d never cheat on someone—I’m not like—didn’t know—” She broke off and started biting her lip again. Susan let the silence stretch out. </p><p>“Slytherins are loyal,” Pansy said finally. “I’d never do something like that knowingly.”</p><p>Susan shrugged. “Hufflepuffs are supposed to be loyal, too.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at the edge of her cardigan and muttered, “Michael’s only loyal to his dick, though.”</p><p>And Pansy began laughing. Properly laughing, like crying-laughing, wiping her eyes and thank Merlin, she’d stopped biting her lip for a minute.</p><p>When she subsided, Pansy took a long look at Susan and said, “You’re quite funny.”</p><p>Susan shrugged and went back to fiddling with her cardigan.</p><p>“This is such a weird situation,” Pansy said. “You’re so calm?”</p><p>Susan laughed. “I’m obviously not that calm if I’m fainting every other minute.” Pansy looked abashed again and went back to biting her lip.</p><p>Draco returned with a tray of tea things. Susan took her tea with three sugars, earning a raised eyebrow from Draco, and curled up in the corner of the couch with her sweet brew. <em>What a strange day, </em>she thought, watching the steam rise from the mug. Drinking tea out of a mug with Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson. And apparently she didn’t have a boyfriend anymore.</p><p>They sat in a strangely companionable silence. Then Pansy said, “We’d better get you home, then,” and helped Susan lace up her boots and into her coat. Draco kissed her on the cheek and said, “Send me an owl if you feel worse, alright?”</p><p>And then they were Flooing back to Susan’s little flat. When she and Pansy tumbled out of the fireplace, Susan had a sudden wish that she’d attempted to clean a bit. Her flat was the opposite of Pansy and Draco’s sterile, white home. Here, there were piles of books and plants all over and wild tangles of yarn and feathers drifting through the air and her owl Eris was screaming—he’d expected a mouse far earlier than nine—and there was somehow cat fur all over the couch? </p><p>Her tabby Agatha watched the two of them from her perch near the bookshelf. Pansy had looped her arm around Susan’s waist for the Floo, and now she was untangling herself and edging backwards.</p><p>“Sorry it’s such a mess,” Susan said, but it came out a bit harsh.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t mind,” Pansy said, “My room’s much worse. Draco’s the one who keeps the main areas tidy. Well, Draco and his elf Watson. God, you should have met Watson. He was probably asleep. He wakes up at like four am to bake bread.” She broke off and started chewing her lip again.</p><p>“I’ve never had an elf,” Susan said. “Or, worked with one,” she said, realizing that elves were no longer to be spoken of as property since the Granger reforms had shaken up society. Her mind was still catching up to some of the new words and phrases that were politically correct.</p><p>“Merlin, I’m so dumb,” Pansy said. “I didn’t mean to like, you know, I don’t know.” She groaned softly to herself and twisted her hands.</p><p>Susan tilted her head. She was truly confused by Pansy’s agitation. “It’s fine. We just never had one. Fuck, I mean, we never employed one.”</p><p>Pansy’s mouth quirked. “I know, I’m still getting used to it too. Anyway, Watson is lovely and Draco and I are blessed that he wanted to stay with us. You’ll have to meet him next time. You could talk about—” she waved one hands around— “plants and things. He’s a lot of herbs.”</p><p>Susan looked around at her plants, half-surprised that Pansy had noticed them. </p><p>“So you want to hang out?” she said, wanting to clarify the situation.</p><p>“I mean,” Pansy was biting her lip again. “If you would. I know it’s awful. But you seem really cool and lovely and I’m so sorry about earlier, I really didn’t know, but I don’t have that many friends, and I’d love to be your friend, and Merlin, I should shut up.”</p><p><em>In for a penny, </em>Susan thought again. The evening, post-Michael, hadn’t been that bad. And she couldn’t really fault Pansy for fucking Michael in the first place. He really was quite hot. And a malicious, lying twat. But his abs. She shook her head to dislodge the image.</p><p>“Yeah, that’d be fun,” Susan said. “Not that like, today was fun. But you seem fun.”</p><p>“Great!” Pansy said and beamed.</p><p>Susan knew there was probably a polite way to ask this but she was getting tired and so she just said, “So do you work or have some kind of a schedule?”</p><p>“I’m, um, interning with a local Seer, but the schedule is really up in the air?” </p><p>Susan took a step backwards. “I didn’t know you had the Sight.”</p><p>“Uh,” Pansy said and was twisting her hands again. “I do. But it’s not very good, or helpful. I just get these random like moments that come to me but they don’t really indicate like, how to get there or what’s happening super well, but I’m like—” she broke off again and continued in almost a whisper. “I saw you once. Like, with me. In some bookstore.”</p><p>“What?!” Susan said. “Are you trying to be my friend just because you had some kind of premonition?!”</p><p>“No!” Pansy yelped. “Like, I just know it’s going to happen at some point. I don’t know that we’re friends in the future or anything, but you always seemed nice at school and your braid was always cool and then this whole Michael thing happened—which, by the way, the Sight offered me absolutely no insight into—and, well, I don’t know.”</p><p>Susan took a deep breath.   </p><p>	“I’m not very good at Seeing,” Pansy said in a whisper. “That’s why my parents thought it would be helpful to train with someone who is.”</p><p>	“Well,” Susan said with a sigh. “That’s a lot to take in, but like, fuck it. Let’s be friends. Let’s do it.”</p><p>	Pansy’s entire face lit up. </p><p>	Susan held up one finger. “I don’t care that you have the Sight or like, half-Sight or whatever. Just don’t tell me about anything you see me in, ok? I don’t want to know.” She tugged on the end of her ponytail and continued, “I had all these ideas about the future, and now it seems like things are going to be different, and I just want to like, see for myself, ok?”</p><p>	Pansy was nodding with a serious expression on her face. “Yes, right, I won’t say anything.”</p><p>	“Cool,” Susan said. “Right.”</p><p>	Pansy laid one hand on her arm. “You seem tired. I’ll go. Just send me an owl?”</p><p>	Susan nodded again, but her ability to speak seemed to have left her.</p><p>	And then Pansy darted out and wrapped her up in a hug and then dashed back to the Floo and disappeared again.</p><p>	<em>What a day, </em>Susan thought as she headed to her bedroom after throwing Eris a frozen mouse. Agatha twined around her ankles as she ran a tub. </p><p>	“Well, we’ve got some changes coming, Agatha,” Susan said as she sunk into her bath. Agatha had jumped onto the toilet and watched her. “Michael won’t be coming round anymore. That’s done.”</p><p>	Agatha seemed to start purring. But Susan was sure it might have just been the tap. </p><p>	<em>Here’s to a new sort of life. A single and wonderful one. Doing whatever I want.</em></p>
