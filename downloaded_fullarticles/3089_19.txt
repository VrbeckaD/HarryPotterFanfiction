    <p>
  <span>Hermione wasn’t sure when the dreams first began. They had always been a part of her. A nebulous and amorphous entity that lingered along the corners of her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first, she’d ignored it. Convinced that it was only because she was exhausted. Drained by the daily ins and outs of her life. After all, what other explanation could there be? She was working twelve-hour days and volunteering on most weekends for pro-bono work. It was a hard, onerous life that she led. Satisfying, but no less exhausting if the dark circles around her eyes said anything about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So of course, it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>easy </span>
  </em>
  <span>to forget one’s own self-care when swamped with millions of other things. The life of a lowly associate at a medium-sized firm tended to do that to a person, after all. The pay wasn’t great and the work that one put was meaningless in the grand scheme of things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She loved her job. Truly. She doubted she could do any other work, the challenge of researching the law and working her mind to win the case one that she doubted any other field might provide. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That, however, did not mean that she wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>tired</span>
  </em>
  <span>. No, she was eroding herself down to the marrow of her bones, each case like sandpaper on a rough surface grinding and </span>
  <em>
    <span>grinding </span>
  </em>
  <span>away at her. A mortar and pestle crushing her down to microscopic particles, where nothing and no one, could </span>
  <em>
    <span>see </span>
  </em>
  <span>what she’d become. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With each case she was handed, with each snide remark by her co-workers when they saw her strut in with her thrift-store designer suit and her frizzy hair, she lost sight of herself. Her needs secondary to the pressures of daily living, to the demands of her clients and the mounds of work her colleagues dumped on her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As if she were nothing more than a glorified intern rather than a </span>
  <em>
    <span>paid </span>
  </em>
  <span>attorney at their firm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was unfair. An injustice she suffered through for simply being a </span>
  <em>
    <span>novice</span>
  </em>
  <span>, for graduating at the top of her class and subjecting herself to the caprices of a field that cared little for her knowledge when she lacked experience.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been a bitter pill to swallow, the economy in ruins doing little to salvage her hope as she sought desperately for jobs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that was life. She’d resigned herself to this, accepted that she would wilt away for a few years in this hellhole of a firm and then rise from the ashes reborn once she’d acquired all the experience she needed. It wouldn’t take long. The supervising attorneys and partners already handed her much of the work, anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So in the grand scheme of things, her mental and physical health was the least of her concerns. The shadows curling at the back of her eyelids were meaningless. An issue easily forgotten when there were hundreds of other hurdles demanding a bite at the apple, snapping and clawing up her arms until she had no other choice but to lay those demons to rest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If only the demons lurking in her mind would rest too when she wished them to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione laid on her bed, curls pulled into a messy bun. She’d been staring at the dark ceiling for hours now, sleep eluding her after she’d been berated by her supervisor earlier that afternoon for misplacing the files to a hearing scheduled that same day. It didn’t matter that she’d made photocopies of the important documents for the case nor that she herself had reviewed them religiously in anticipation of the hearing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her boss had not been pleased, and that alone was reason enough to lose all desire to rest. It’d been </span>
  <em>
    <span>careless </span>
  </em>
  <span>of her, after all. Hermione Granger simply did not </span>
  <em>
    <span>lose </span>
  </em>
  <span>files. It was unheard of. Hell, if anyone in her class heard that </span>
  <em>
    <span>the </span>
  </em>
  <span>Hermione Granger had done something as silly as that, they’d think the apocalypse upon them. Perfect, hard-working, Hermione Granger would </span>
  <em>
    <span>never </span>
  </em>
  <span>do such a thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What utter bollocks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ever since she’d started this job and stretching herself thin with her own activities outside of the firm, she’d been prone to such mistakes. There was only so much the human body could take, and she, was at her limit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the only explanation she had to the shadow standing right at the edge of the bedroom. Its presence like static, unheard and unseen, but so </span>
  <em>
    <span>real </span>
  </em>
  <span>that there was no doubt in mind that she was losing it. She hadn’t closed her eyes for longer than a second, hadn’t felt the sweet lull of slumber pull at her as it always did right when she usually drifted off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no reason that there was a shadow there...standing, watching her, </span>
  <em>
    <span>gazing </span>
  </em>
  <span>into her face with an intensity that made her skin crawl. It wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>real</span>
  </em>
  <span>. It couldn’t be. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione closed her eyes and bit her lip. She took a deep breath through her nose, counting the seconds that it took to completely fill her lungs before releasing it. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>One. Two. Three.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, she opened her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shadow was gone. Its presence had flickered from existence in the time it’d taken her to gather her bearings and settle her breaths into a manageable state.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Relief spread through her. A warm sensation bloomed low in her belly, trickling from the center and out until her fingers tingled with it. It was nice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The closest to peace she’d been in a long time. She didn’t know she’d been tense until she’d finally relaxed, the unease and fear of the shadow standing right at her door too much, even for her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, just as she sank deeper into that warmth. The soothing pull of slumber was wrenched away, a streak of white and red flashing along her vision. A bright streak, like lightning in a darkened room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then there was a face, a gaunt serpentine face a centimeter away from hers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione screamed, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>screamed</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but she could not move. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was weighed down. As if someone had sewn her flesh into the mattress, crushed not only by the stitching of the fabric, but by the suffocating weight of this creature sitting on her chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was monstrous. Its eyes bore into her own, bright and inhuman. Its face assessing, its mouth curled into a cruel smile that made her spine shudder with terror. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione wanted to shut her eyes, to run and be free. The compulsion was incessant. A cry in the back of her mind that reverberated like a choir of children singing at mass. Endlessly, it urged her to </span>
  <em>
    <span>move</span>
  </em>
  <span>, to </span>
  <em>
    <span>run</span>
  </em>
  <span>, but Hermione couldn’t. Her limbs only twitched in reply to her commands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“W-what—?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shhh.” The creature interrupted, its sibilant voice enough to raise the hairs of her bare forearms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll wake him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Hermione hadn’t been so terrified, she’d have asked it what it meant. She had no bloody idea what it was talking about, what it could fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>mean. </span>
  </em>
  <span>It was only her and the monster. There were no others in the room with her last time she checked unless—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione gasped when the creature lowered its mouth until their breaths mingled, the stench of iron and earth pungent in her nostrils. It made her gag, made bile rise up her esophagus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s here. Waiting.” It said, its mouth grazing her lips in the process. Hermione tried not to shudder, repulsed when its smile only widened in response, a row of white teeth flashing underneath the shadows of her room. “Waiting for you to sleep. Waiting for you to </span>
  <em>
    <span>see</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione swallowed before she gathered enough courage to respond.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“S-see what?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The creature remained silent for a moment, eyes boring uncomfortably into her face before it shifted, the pressure on her chest making her lungs ache. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, with a soft, almost crooning voice, it spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Him.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Hermione shot awake, her heart beating rapidly in her chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The image of the creature’s eyes clung to the back of her eyelids. Bright and malignant, horror and the rancid taste of its breath a thick muck that sat in the back of her tongue. She gagged, and nearly vomited over herself, the mere memory of the dream and the way the creature watched her with its knowing eyes too much for her to bear.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>God.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Her heart refused to slow, her eyes shooting every which way in her bedroom for any sign of the shadow, horrified that it might flit about her sight just as it had done in her dream…</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dream. That’s all it is, Hermione. A dream.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The thought was of little comfort. It had felt too real, the shadows and the way the creature’s flesh wrinkled along its mouth, like fault lines at the bottom of the mediterranean sea. Every crevice, every speck of red and garnet in its gaze had been easily discerned. The distance between their faces nothing. Microscopic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione inched her back against the headboard of her bed, her shoulders shaking; no longer capable of sleep now that she was awake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soft light from the digital clock on her bedside drew her attention after she scouted her room for the hundredth time, more certain now that it wasn’t there. That it all had been a dream, a shite dinner and another rough day at work the reason for the nightmare. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>3/22 Wednesday. 3:30 A.M.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione sucked in a breath through her teeth, plopping herself back into bed. Frustration curled over her brows, and her lips puckered into an irritated line. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only three hours of sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only three hours of </span>
  <em>
    <span>bloody </span>
  </em>
  <span>sleep. She’d have to get up in about an hour and thirty minutes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione was not looking forward to the rest of the week. Friday could not get there any faster.</span>
