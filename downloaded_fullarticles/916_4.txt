    <p>Sirius has his arm around him. It is, quite possibly, the only thing keeping James from collapsing. His glasses have smudges on them, blurring his vision. He’s glad for it. He has no interest in raising his head to watch the scene unfolding in front of him.</p>
<p>“James,” Sirius murmurs quietly. It’s the first time James can recall his friend ever sounding so gentle with him. He hums as a response. Sirius sighs and thrusts something soft into his hand. </p>
<p>He lowers his eyes to his hands, at the flowers brushing against his Quidditch callouses. Sirius squeezes his shoulder once, then twice and somewhere in James’ heart he finds it in himself to look over at his friend. </p>
<p>“I know it’s hard, mate,” He says, gaze steadily ahead at the sight James refuses to witness. “But you’ll regret it forever if you don’t look now.” Sirius keeps his hand on his shoulder as James looks over to his right, towards his father. </p>
<p>Fleamont Potter isn’t the kind of man anyone could call cold or callous. The Potter household isn’t one where the men puffed their chests and refused to cry. They cried like they did everything; unabashedly and proudly. Yet, when James looks at his father just then, it’s like gazing upon him for the very first time. His father’s hands are shaking, his eyes unblinking as they well up with tears. The sunlight is so bright that the greys in his hair look white, aging his father even more. It adds wrinkles around his eyes and on his brow. And for a moment, his father looks more his age than he ever had before. </p>
<p>James clenches his fists and the flower in his hand sags under the pressure. A fizzing, scarlet anxiety starts to churn in his stomach. He turns his head down to where he is meant to be looking. </p>
<p>Euphemia Potter’s body is wrapped in a lilac, satin cloth. Whenever the light hits right, the cloth sparkles and glitters like it’s embroidered with diamonds. Her face is covered, which lodges a piece of relief in James’ chest because he doesn’t think he has it in him to look at her expression. People are tossing flowers onto his mother, delicate, white petals fluttering in the wind. His father’s hand too, is extended, tossing flowers that he seems to be conjuring, his wedding ring glinting in the sunlight. </p>
<p>A ministry wizard is standing by his mother’s feet, speaking words that spiraled into one ear and out the next. His father had asked James if he’d wanted to speak. He had refused, knowing in his heart that he’d cry, bawl hard enough that it would take the combined strength of Sirius, Remus and Peter to get him to stop sniffling. Instead of saying all the things he would’ve wanted to say about his mother, he’d curl up into a ball and ask her to come back. </p>
<p>And that wouldn’t be what she’d have wanted. </p>
<p>His father squares his shoulders. James feels it more than he sees it, his father’s robes brushing against his own, feels the creaky breath he takes as though it were his own. The ministry wizard stays rooted in his spot and James’ father moves to stand at his mother’s head. Automatically, Peter steps forward, filling his father’s place and bumps his shoulder against James’. He doesn’t bump back. </p>
<p>“Thank you all,” his father says, the tears in his eyes still sparkling, “for coming.” He clasps his hands together, long, funeral robes swishing as he does. Black does not suit funerals, James thinks, it looks too much like Hogwarts’ robes. His gaze falls over the whole crowd slowly, like he’s individually thanking all the people that came to say goodbye to his wife.</p>
<p>“Euphemia,” His father continues, voice steadier than James’ ever could’ve been, “would’ve been <i>appalled</i> to see her sendoff be so quiet. She’d have liked balloons and streamers, sparks flying from wands. My wife always did have a flair for the dramatic.” His gaze falls down to lilac cloth and he takes a breath, “When you’re my age, you always think, it’s only a matter of time until it’s your turn to go. I had always selfishly hoped that Euphemia would outlive me.” His father smiles sadly, “But, sometimes you don’t get what you want.”</p>
<p>“My wife was a brave woman. Always had that Gryffindor spirit. She fought for the things she believed in, often at risk of herself. She’d come home after long days and I’d know her back would be aching and her soul would be tired, but she’d light up like a lumination charm when our son walked into the room. Once, back when James was this tall,” His father held up a hand, flicking it over to a height around his father’s waist, “he had come running towards his mum and asked ‘how many bad guys did you catch today?’ And my wife, she smiled, ruffled his hair and told him something I’ll never forget.”</p>
<p>“She sat down and told him, there are no <i>bad</i> guys. Don’t think about people as good and bad, the world would be a horrible place if things were so black and white, if we lived in a world without a grey area. And James had just shook his head and asked, ‘but aren’t <i>we</i> good guys?’.” His father’s gaze rests squarely on James and though his eyes are hazel like his own, he swears that he sees a part of his mother shine. “And my wife… my dear Euphemia squeezed his hands and told him ‘We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.”</p>
<p>James swallows roughly. He remembers the day as clearly as his father. Remembers the pink of his mother’s lipstick, the iron in her voice and the soft way her hand had caressed his hair. Despite it all, he remembers shrugging, disappointed at not being told a fun story about what it was like to be an Auror. How foolish he had been.</p>
<p>“It would be easy, to stand up here and condemn the people responsible for my wife’s death. But I do not want to spend this day spewing hatred and fear into a world that is already filled with it.” His father looks away from James down at his wife and for the first time since the news had hit his hands are not shaking. His voice is soft, “I want to choose to act on the light within me and tell you all how very much I love my wife. Though she may be gone, I will never forget the things she taught me, the love she liked to spread. If there is anything you want to do to pay your respects to Euphemia, all I ask is you choose the light within you.”</p>
<p>James throws his flower onto the lilac shroud. </p>
<p>He takes a heavy breath and takes a few steps forward until he is standing shoulder to shoulder with his father. He smiles at his son and James does his best to return it. His father raises his hand, wand high in the air and James wrangles his own out of his robe pocket. He looks out toward the crowd; at Sirius who is barely concealing his own grief but still standing upright, at Remus whose respect for James’ mother is written all over his sad smile, at Peter whose concern for his friends is clear in his blue eyes. They are all looking at him.</p>
<p>He raises his wand in the air, waves it in a big arc. Wisps of white smoke trail from the tips of his and his father’s wands. They encircle the lilac shroud, white flames taking over until James cannot see any lilac left at all. His eyes sting with tears, but he doesn’t wipe them away, lets them fall from his cheeks to his robes. He makes a noise from the back of his throat, a strangled whimper and stretches his hand out so he can hold onto his father’s elbow. His father stands strong and solid, all the burden of parenting resting on his shoulders and James stares down at the coffin that has replaced the white flames. He closes his eyes and wishes his mother were there to hold him too.</p>
