          <div class="userstuff"><p>I’ve been told It’s a cruel summer. This war is never-ending and we are losing a lot of troops. Narcissa keeps telling me to end it before we lose more but I couldn't listen, not even to her, even though she was my most trusted advisor, not that anyone knew that.</p><p>                                                                                                                   oOo</p><p>Narcissa comes in crying one night with blood on her hands. I rushed to her side to see what happened. “Draco…..” she barely manages to get out.</p><p>                                                                                                                   oOo</p><p>A week later I was standing on a hill watching a funeral when I saw Harry Potter walking up to pay his tributes. I pulled my wand out “avada” I started to whisper until I saw Narcissa’s face, she was absolutely heartbroken and it was because of this war I started. I put my wand away and promised myself that the next time I see Harry Potter I would not hesitate.</p></div>
