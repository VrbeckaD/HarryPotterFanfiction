    <p> </p><p>He was hiding on Halloween's feast in deserted bathroom. Harry didn’t want to face his housemates or the other students. The young boy didn’t want to meet any of them. He never understood what he did wrong. He just wanted to have friends, to be loved, to find a family to take care. But he found nothing, but additional pain. It had already been two months. And Harry wanted to leave. He should have not believed the half giant. He should have stayed away. He was sorted in Gryffindor like his parents, once someone had said, but they all found out that he wasn’t like books told them. He didn’t know why it mattered to them if he wasn’t the great hero books had portrayed him to be. He found himself alone all the time. His hope had faded away within the first week.</p><p> <br/>
He merely smiled like he did on the first day. For the past two months, he had been spending his entire time in library reading and learned in absolute silent. He always sat in a corner when he was in class. The teachers were almost leaving him alone except for his potion teacher who seemed to hate him. He had soon learned by understanding his teacher’s behavior that the potion teacher hated his father. It wasn’t fair, he realized, but he couldn’t do much. People stole his stuff, torn up his assignments to get him in detentions. He had soon fell completely silent. It was too much. Harry regretted to be in Hogwarts, there was nothing magic in it. How could he be happy and excited of learning magic when he was constantly bullied ? So, he found himself on Halloween’s night in a empty bathroom. </p><p><br/>
His quietness was disrupted by the apparition of a mountain troll, Harry recognized it from one of his books on magical creatures. The horrible smell attacked his nose soon it entered the bathroom. Harry was terrified. He wasn’t a hero. He was nobody. He couldn’t defend himself against a creature like it. The mountain troll turned towards him with cruel glee in the eyes. It wasn’t like any other mountain troll, Harry noticed still scared. It seemed to have another blood inside of his DNA. Harry dodged the attack, he ran to the bathroom's door hoping to escape the thing. However, it succeeded to grab Harry’s small and thin body. </p><p><br/>
It threw Harry against a wall. He let a scream of pain. Harry tried to get up, but it grabbed him again. The troll spoke, but it didn’t make sense for Harry. It threw him again to the wall. Harry heard one of his bones break, he hissed in pain, the monster took him with his right hand. Harry pulled out his wand and shot a spell to the creature, it didn’t do much damage. It was enough for Harry to flee once more. Harry escaped the bathroom, he hissed in pain, but kept running with the rather quick troll behind. As he ran, the young boy hoped that someone would saved him. The castle was tricky, he thought running, he hoped to meet someone to help him out. Instead, he found himself at the very end of a corridor. The smell of the troll informed him that he was screwed up. </p><p><br/>
The troll grabbed him. Harry resigned himself. He was going to die. Nobody would saved him. It was too late. The young boy had known no love or family in the past ten years, he had lived with his aunt’s family even though they never loved him. When he had learned he was a wizard, for the first time in years he was happy. But instead, he found himself in a nightmare. It hurt so much. He couldn’t deal with pain any longer. Harry began to cough blood. Red liquid started staining his clothes – torn up and dirty clothes. Harry screamed. The troll was putting so much pressure on his small and thin body. His old and most recent injuries added to the current pain made the things worse for the young boy. </p><p><br/>
Despair. </p><p><br/>
Hate. </p><p><br/>
Loneliness. </p><p><br/>
Sadness. </p><p><br/>
His magic reacted badly. It wrapped both of them – him and the troll – in blue light then it exploded. Harry’s magic has always healed him in despair to keep him alive, it had exhausted him along the years because of abuse and bullying. Harry’s body was too damaged to be heal once more. Harry smiled a bit as he felt himself dying, he fell on the floor as soon as the light disappeared. The troll was injured. It lost its two arms, Harry’s magic formed a hole in its chest. Harry was lying in his own blood, he closed his eyes and ceased to breath. Death welcomed him. <br/>
The troll left the dead body alone and walked in another direction. </p>
<hr/><p>Perceval 'Percy' Weasley was terrified.</p><p> <br/>
It should have been a nice Halloween evening. But it ended up differently. A troll had invaded Hogwarts throwing everybody in panic. The headmaster had told to the prefects to go back to their dormitories except for the Slytherin because their dormitory was in the dungeons. They instead went with Ravenclaw. The prefects of each house had received the order to count every single student. Once Gryffindor was safe in their tower, the perfects and himself began to count each year. Everybody was there except for one boy, a first year boy. And Percy knew who he was. He recognized the lonely boy walking in Hogwarts, friendless and spending his entire time in the library. He was the only one who wasn’t in the tower, and he didn’t recall him being during the dinner. </p><p><br/>
The deputy Headmistress, head of Gryffindor, and professor of metamorphose had entered a few minutes ago in the common room. She has informed them that the troll had been taken care of. Everything was alright, he thought bitterly. For them, at least. One student wasn’t – perhaps – alright. He stepped up towards his teacher feeling nervous, his pale face made her worrying over him.</p><p> <br/>
“M. Weasley ?” She asked in a worried tone. <br/>
“Someone is missing. A first year.” He informed her pale. </p><p><br/>
Minerva’s eyes widened in shock. She looked up to the first year’s group, they were all here except for..  She paled.</p><p><br/>
“Stay here. I’ll go finding him.” She said in a hush tone. </p><p><br/>
Minerva quickly left the tower, she went straight to the meeting room where the other teachers were. She walked in, pale, and noticed that only the other heads and the headmaster were there. She didn’t waste time and informed there that a first year from Gryffindor was missing. </p><p><br/>
“That damn brat…” The potion teacher muttered to himself getting up.</p><p> <br/>
Albus sent a search party to find the boy.</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
 <br/>
“That smell… The troll came that way.” </p><p><br/>
Minerva nodded to her colleague, Severus.</p><p>“We should follow it.” </p><p><br/>
They had teamed up together. They followed the smell of the troll, another smell was soon added to it. It made them feel sick for no reason. They soon arrived to a horrific scene. Severus paled when he recognized the young student lying in blood, Minerva ran to Potter and checked his pulse. </p><p><br/>
“… Dead.” She whispered in shock. </p><p><br/>
Severus checked Potter’s pulse too. But he found nothing. The boy was lying in his own blood, his clothes were dirty and torn up, blood had stained the clothes, and his skin was cold. Minerva sent her patronus to inform the other teachers and the headmaster of the student’s death. As soon as they arrived on the scene, they paled and some of them threw up. </p><p><br/>
How did he die ? They wondered while looking away from the body. Did the troll.. ? </p><p>Funerals were special for Hogwarts. <br/>
If the victim were orphan, if the victim died in the castle, so the body would be buried in Hogwarts’ cemetery. No many people died in Hogwarts, the only were mostly ghosts of the school now, the other were buried in another place. On November 13th, all houses and teachers dressed up in black to attend to Harry Potter's funeral. Ghosts were there too looking grim. Everybody looked gloomy and grim. </p><p><br/>
The British wizarding community had learned about the death of the first year due to a troll attack. The article told about a teacher who let the troll in. Apparently, Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore had found him guilty. He was taken the following day of the death of Harry Potter. He was interrogated with a potion of truth. And immediately after his trial sent to Azkaban to be kissed by dementors. </p><p><br/>
Two days after Potter’s death, the British wizarding community had learned about the death of Sirius Black. According to the guards, they had found him dead in his cell. He had committed suicide. While preparing Potter’s funeral, the teachers had discovered accidently the hidden identity of Scabbers – rat of a student in Gryffindor. A very alive Peter Pettigrew was took and interrogated, and the wizarding community had found the next day that Sirius Black had been innocent the whole time. The traitor had always been Peter Pettigrew. The body of the Black heir had been retrieved by his family and buried in the family cemetery. </p>
<hr/><p>In Hogwarts’ cemetery, a new tomb had been made for the latest dead student. </p><p align="center"><br/>
