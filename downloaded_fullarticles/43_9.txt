    <p>Violet eyes looked down on her former husband and their son sadly. Merlin had disappeared, Arthur was dead, and she had been forced to put her only child in an enchanted sleep. She reached down and tenderly brushed dark curls from a pale face. Her little boy. How had she failed him so thoroughly? She glanced at Arthur dismissively. How had they both failed him so miserably? Their precious son had gone so far off the path, dabbling in the Dark Arts and loosing himself to Black magic. He was too powerful for even Arthur to defeat, and it had taken her and Merlin’s combined powers – and the use of a clever potion of her own design, to merely put him into an enchanted sleep. She was distracted from her grieving by a loud cry and a wistful smile crossed her face as she retrieved the squalling infant from her back. Much to her surprise, her son had fathered children, a boy and a girl. She’d managed to retrieve her granddaughter, but their mother had managed to hide the boy from her. She only hoped the child wouldn’t turn out like his father. Her eyes flashed purple and she froze. Flashes of the future, two girls and two boys – descendants of herself, Arthur, Mordred, and, surprisingly, Merlin. They were standing back-to-back their wands in their hands. They were in the midst of a battle. Then one of the girls and her own descendant were standing in a room together, discussing something. She couldn’t hear the words. The four of them were in a tomb, standing in front of her son. One of the girls – Mordred’s descendant judging by her eyes – took an obsidian dagger – a gift from Arthur – and plunged it into Mordred’s chest. Her son woke with a start, for just a few moments, and she watched as the life finally left his silver eyes. A man with reptilian features cast the killing curse. She felt the visions release her. She looked down at the child in her arms. She would adopt her granddaughter and raise the girl as her own. She only wondered what she and Merlin had damned those children to.</p><p>

</p><p>Regulus sat up, spluttering and choking, to glare at his house-elf. “I… told you… to come back… immediately…” he coughed out around the water in his throat. Kreacher bowed, not looking at his youngest master.</p><p>“Kreacher did, but Master Regulus did not say that Kreacher must leave Master in cave to die.” He replied, still not looking at him. Regulus snorted.</p><p>“Bloody… house-elves….” He muttered incredulously. He shook his head, and laid back on his bed. He needed to rest. Then he would take the horcrux to his brother.</p>
<hr/><p>“Where did you get this?!”

Regulus scrubbed a hand down his face.

 “In a cave off the coast.” He replied dryly. Then he sighed.

 “I let him borrow Kreacher, and Kreacher returned home to tell me that he had been nearly drowned by Inferi after the Dark Lord had forced him to drink a potion that caused him a great amount of pain. Kreacher told me the Dark Lord had hidden something after forcing him to drink the potion, putting a small locket in a stone basin and refilling it with the potion. I ordered Kreacher to take me to the cave, where I drank the potion and retrieved the locket. I told Kreacher to return home with the locket, and he did – after he had made sure to grab me before I could drown.”</p><p>Sirius stared at his little brother in horror and a fair amount of anger.</p><p>“Are you out of your mind?! You could have died!”</p><p>Regulus arched a brow.</p><p>“What do you care?”</p><p>Sirius gaped at him.</p><p>“What do I – Of course I care, you bloody idiot! You’re my brother!”</p><p>“You certainly haven’t acted like it the last ten years.” Regulus replied coolly. Sirius glared at him.</p><p>“You’re the one who wanted nothing to do with me, remember? You got sorted and told me not to talk to you, so I left you alone. That doesn’t mean I didn’t watch out for you – who do you think hexed MacNair in your third year?” he demanded. He shook his head, “That doesn’t matter. You’re alive, and I’m not gonna kill you for being an idiot. Mostly because I would lose my job if I did. Is this the only one? Or are there more? Do you know?”</p><p>Regulus shook his head. “I haven’t the foggiest, to be honest. Though, knowing what I do about the Dark Lord, I know he has an obsession with the number seven. So it’s likely that he has more than just the one, though I have no idea what they may be or where he could have hidden them.” He admitted ruefully. Sirius clapped his shoulder. “You did good, Regulus. Thank you.” He added sincerely. Regulus waved him off, fighting back a blush. It was the first time his brother had praised him in years. He changed the subject.</p><p>“What are you going to do with it?” Sirius shrugged.</p><p>“Take it to Amelia, who will then probably send me and James out to look for them. Do you have any idea where they might be?”</p><p>Regulus started to say ‘no’ but then he remembered something.</p><p>“A few days ago the Dark Lord called Lucius and Bellatrix into his study. When they left, they were both looking smug, and Bella was carrying a gold goblet. She said that the Dark Lord had asked her to keep it safe for him. He asked me for use of Kreacher shortly afterward.”</p>
<hr/><p>Regulus was celebrating his freedom. Apparently, informing the Head Auror of the Dark Lord’s horcruxes had earned him amnesty for having followed him in the first place. Of course, his new-found freedom depended on him not being found by the Dark Lord or his followers. So he sat at the bar of the muggle pub he’d found a few blocks from Grimauld, nursing his fourth Scotch of the evening. He felt a hand on his arm and looked up, ready to snap, only to find a petite brunette looking at him with a coy smile, which he returned. Perhaps he could have little fun tonight instead of just drinking himself into a stupor.</p>
<hr/><p>Sirius stared at the two small bundles on his desk dubiously. There was a note precariously perched on the child nearest him. He grabbed it and started reading it.</p><p>
  <em> Auror Black, These are the children of Regulus Black. I have no idea how to get in touch with him, so I’m leaving them with you. They’re girls – identical twins. I haven’t named them. I want nothing to do with the children of a Death Eater, even if I did, shamefully, birth them. Good luck. </em>
</p><p>There was no signature. He looked down at the two children and picked up the one the note had been placed on. Wide grey eyes stared curiously up at him. There was no doubt she was a Black. He could tell by the shape of her face. As he studied her, black downy hair turned green. He chuckled. Definitely a Black. Why would the mother just randomly leave them on his desk? If the woman hadn’t wanted them, he would have gladly taken them in. Though, to be sure, he would have to get a paternity test done on the two infants.</p><p>“James.” He called softly, just loud enough to gain his friend’s attention. He didn’t want to startle the girls. James joined him instantly, only to gape at the babies in his office.</p><p>“Sirius, mate, is there something you need to tell me?”</p><p>Sirius chuckled.</p><p>“I found them here when I came in. According to the note on this little one,” he jiggled the baby in his arms gently, gaining a giggle, “they’re my brother’s children. Apparently, the mother doesn’t want anything to do with ‘the children of Death Eaters’ even if they are hers. I need your help taking these two to Mungo’s for a paternity test and a check-up. I have no doubt that they’re Black’s,” he added with a grin, “the little girl I’m holding is apparently a metamorphmagus. Changed her hair green when I picked her up. But I’d rather make sure they really are Reggie’s before I take them home. I’ll need to talk to Amelia, of course.” He added tiredly. James snickered. He carefully lifted the other baby and followed his friend to Amelia’s office.</p>
<hr/><p>Sirius plastered a teasing smile on his face as he stepped into the drawing room of Black Manor. His brother and mother were waiting for him.</p><p>“Regulus, my darling baby brother, I have a gift for you – or, two gifts, rather.”</p><p>He announced cheerfully as he carried the two children to his brother. Regulus gawped at him.</p><p>“Sirius, you must be joking.”</p><p>His teasing expression gained a sharp edge to it, and his voice tightened.</p><p>“No, actually, I’m not. These two precious baby girls were left on my desk this morning. I just got back from St. Mungo’s. They’re yours, Regulus.”</p><p>His brother look stunned, not that he blamed him. Finding out that one had two children – without even knowing they were a possibility – would shock anyone. Regulus stood from where he had been sitting with their mother and took one of the twins from Sirius.</p><p>“How old are they? What did their mother name them?”</p><p>“They’re three months old – according to the Healer, they should still be breastfeeding. Amelia has offered to do so until they can be weaned, if you would like our help. Wren’s only a few months older than your girls. As for their names – the bitch didn’t bother naming them, and I decided to leave it up to you, as you’re their father.”</p><p>Regulus looked down at the baby he was holding. His little girl. She was beautiful. They both were. He held out his free arm for his other daughter, and Sirius carefully eased her into the crook of his elbow.</p><p>“I would be glad to take Amelia up on her offer, if she’s willing, and I would be grateful for any help offered from the two of you.” He informed his brother quietly. Sirius squeezed his brother’s shoulder.</p><p>“Whatever you need.” He promised, voice low. Regulus smiled fleetingly.</p><p>“I’ll need to think of names for them.”</p><p>“They’ll also need an Introduction.” Their mother spoke up suddenly. Regulus rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Surely that can wait until they’re older, mother.” He sighed wearily.</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Walburga sniffed, “Your father and I held your and your brother’s Introductions shortly after you were born. It’s tradition. One I expect both of you to uphold with your own children.”</p><p>Sirius groaned.</p><p>“Mother, now really isn’t the time. Regulus still has to name the girls.”</p><p>“Larissa.” Regulus said suddenly. “This one,” he gestured to the one in his right arm, “will be called Larissa Iola Black.” He announced to his mother and brother. Sirius smiled.</p><p>“Larissa. I like it. What about the other one?”</p><p>Regulus shrugged.</p><p>“Alexandra? It was a name Aunt Cassie always favored.”</p><p>Sirius chuckled.</p><p>“And her middle name?”</p><p>“Lyra.” The two brothers looked over at their mother in surprise.</p><p>“Mother?”</p><p>“It’s a small constellation, and a name your uncle Alphard was fond of. It’s what he had intended to name his own daughter, before his lover forced the miscarriage. It means lyre. Alphard was always fond of music.”</p><p>Regulus swallowed heavily and inclined his head.</p><p>“Thank you, Mother. Alexandra Lyra Black.”</p><p>Walburga cleared her throat.</p><p>“Yes, well, you’ll be needing a nursery as well. Kreacher!”</p><p>The elf appeared with a loud ‘pop’.</p><p>“Yes, Mistress.”</p><p>“Master Regulus has discovered that he has children. Make the old nursery suitable for two girls.”</p><p>Kreacher bowed low.</p><p>“Of course, Mistress.”</p><p>He turned to Regulus and bowed again, “Congratulations, Master.”</p><p>He disappeared once more, and Sirius hid a shudder. That elf always did creep him out.</p>
<hr/><p>Lily Potter was dead, her son hailed as ‘The-Boy-Who-Lived’. James and Sirius were both grieving. So was Regulus, if he was honest. The woman had been kind, and a huge help with his daughters. Her family weren’t the only ones who mourned her. His mother was torn between rage and relief. The Dark Lord was gone, if only temporarily. Regulus felt as though a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. With the Dark Lord gone, his daughters were safe from the consequences of his own stupidity. He only hoped they managed to find all of the horcruxes before the man managed to return.</p>
<hr/><p>Sirius stared at his cousin in stunned disbelief. “Why are you giving him to me?” he asked incredulously. Narcissa tossed her platinum hair over her shoulder, looking him in the eye.</p><p>“Because, I do not trust my husband not to twist him as thoroughly as my father twisted his mother. I know you will care for him and teach him to be a better man than Rodolphus or Darius. Please, Sirius.” She pleaded softly, her grey eyes wide and watching him beseechingly. It was this that made him agree, holding out his arms for the boy. Narcissa handed the child over gently.</p><p>“I’ll take him, Narcissa,” he promised her quietly, looking down at the violet-eyed boy, “but you will be helping me to raise your nephew.” He told her solemnly, lifting his head to meet her gaze. Hope filled her eyes and she smiled.</p><p>“Of course, cousin. I would be delighted.”</p><p>Sirius looked back down at the boy. How in Merlin’s name was he going to explain this to Amelia?</p>
<hr/><p>Sirius and James watched with amusement as Regulus reluctantly allowed his two daughters on the floor to play with the other children. It had been a week since the Lestrange’s trial and it was the first time the girls would be meeting Hades. Sirius chuckled.</p><p>“We won’t be that far from them, Reg, calm down."</p><p>“What about Hades? If he’s anything like his mother, I don’t see him being friendly with the others.”</p><p>James waved him off, clapping the new father on the shoulder.</p><p>“Hades is pretty shy, actually. Though,” he chuckled, “it appears Larissa is not. Look.” He added, jerking his chin towards the kids. The two Blacks followed his gaze and, sure enough, Larissa – identifiable by the silver dress she wore – had made her way immediately to Hades and was coaxing him to play with the other children, cooing happily when he hesitantly followed her lead. Sirius snickered.</p><p>“Well, she certainly won’t have trouble making friends when she gets to Hogwarts.” He remarked idly. Regulus snorted.</p><p>“It appears not.” The three men returned to the rest of the adults a few feet away. None of them noticed when Hades, Harry, and Larissa’s eyes flashed – Hade’s a dark, violent purple, Larissa’s swirling, mercurial silver, and Harry’s a deep, burning red.</p>
