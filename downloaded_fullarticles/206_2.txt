    <p>A tall lithe man rose woke from a dreamless sleep and stretched, wincing when his joints cracked. Sleeping on a stone floor with only a blanket and a trunk as a pillow wasn’t as bearable as it was in his youth.

The man had curly ebony hair reaching past his shoulders and vivid emerald eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He breathed in the poisoned air that now composed Earth’s atmosphere, it stank so much, but had no harmful effects on him, since he was immortal. The smell didn’t bother him much anymore.

</p><p>Thunder rumbled loudly overhead, and lightning lit the sky black with the ever present clouds that had a yellow and greenish tint to them. Acid rain splattered in heavy drops on his skin, burning his skin but he didn’t feel the pain. Not when his whole life had been pain. From his life as an abused slave at the hands of the cruel Dursleys and often beaten by his uncle within an inch of his life, to his years at Hogwarts spent passing test after test forced upon him by the Headmaster. The troll, Fluffy, the philosopher’s stone, the basilisk, the dementors, the werewolf, the dragon, the mere people, Tom’s resurrection, Tom possessing him, dying. And then after that, the third war, and the experimentations on him when he was captured and sold to a parasite lab, being cut and drowned and electrocuted and strangled and burnt and whipped and raped and beaten and starved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Surviving on a dying planet, starving and wanting it all to end.</p><p>Pain was a relative concept to him.</p><p>Today he was truly alone, the last person except him to be living on earth had died. His eccentric, weird, beautiful and scarily smart sister. He could still smell her sometimes, the mixture of life and rain and earth and the scent of the flowers she always wore in her blonde hair. Her strange jewelry she wore right until the end, the butterbeer cork necklace she loved so much and the radish earrings she always wore. Luna had been his life, the moon to his stars. His precious beloved sister and now she was dead.</p><p>Just like his husband Draco. And his children, Teddy, Scorpius and Ophelia. His beautiful and amazing children who had been killed by filthy parasites, one by one.</p><p>Everyone he ever loved was dead.</p><p>Everything was ready for him to go back, and change everything.  </p><p>He was standing at the top of the astronomy tower, the Gryffindor sword on his hip, dozens of shrunk trunks stored in the bottomless pockets of his basilisk hide battle robes.</p><p>Looking over the nuclear wasteland that spread below him, no sign of life, plant or otherwise, only smoking ruins and mangled remains of what were once buildings, he knew he was making the right decision. This world had no chance.</p><p>A tall elegant man dressed in a tailored black suit materialized next to him in a swirl of shadows and pulled him into a tight hug.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> He melted into the comforting touch, the familiar smell of death enveloping him. </span></p><p>“Are you ready, Hadrian, my son?”</p><p>“Yes, Father. There is nothing for me here anymore.” He answered.</p><p>“Very well. I’ve decided to alter your appearance slightly, and send you back in 1966, it should be a good time because your soulmate’s activities slowed down at that point. It will give you time to settle down before hunting his horcruxes so you can fix his soul.” Said Death, pulling away.</p><p>Hadrian nodded in understanding.</p><p>“Thank you, Father. You don’t know how much this means to me.”</p><p>“I only want your happiness, my son.”</p><p>Hadrian grinned, and no one blame if the smile looked slightly unhinged.</p><p>“I’m ready now.”</p><p>Death nodded and placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>And then his entire existence was pain, worse than anything he had experienced before.</p>
