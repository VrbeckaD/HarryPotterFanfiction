              <p>The year is 1990. Although the wall no longer looms over Berlin, two old friends reunite in its shadow, each waging a cold war of their own. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black have spent the last nine years thinking the worst of each other. This would be fine if they were taking a holiday to work through their problems in their own time. Instead, they're enemy spies who've been brought together for a mission that only they can carry out, and the future of the magical world hangs in the balance.</p>

    <blockquote class="userstuff">
      <p>From the author:</p><p>Thanks to: Phiso, who has been an excellent support network and story advisor, as well as providing the wonderful art pieces you'll see throughout; tobermoriansass for beta reading and helping me get this thing into shape, as well as some help with the German; moonygarou for more help with German; retiredunicorn for help with French; and the Big Bang mods, for running this event and giving me the perfect excuse to write the AU of my dreams.</p><p>On the other languages, there are only a couple of lines you need to worry about, which are in Part 2. If you're on desktop, you can hover over these for a translation, or check the end notes of the chapter on mobile/e-reader.</p><p>As this is an AU based on a comedy film, I haven't done too much to earn it the M rating, but there are also some dark themes. Here are the main warnings: sporadic violence typical of both canons, a brief scene of torture, psychological torture themes, (mostly psychological) child abuse themes.</p><p>From the artist:</p><p>Thank you, Renaissance, for writing this wonderful fic; I knew the instant I saw the summary that I wanted to be a part of it, and it's been a delight from start to finish. Thanks Tech, Moma, and the good sports in my dance class who all helped with pose references; everything would've turned out wonky without y'all. Thanks Dustmouth and YumeNoveau for your encouragement and your tips regarding materials; you helped me believe in myself and find a medium I had always loved and always wanted to try. And last, but not least, thank you, mods, especially myprettycabinet, for reaching out to me and recruiting me as an artist in the first place. It's been years since I felt confident enough to draw anything, and now, thanks to you, I'm excited to pick up my pencil and see what comes out.</p>

</center><p>West of the Iron Curtain was just the same as the East; the streets this late at night were cloaked in the same dim glow and the sounds were the same, scuffling strays, distant cars, the odd gunshot to keep everyone on their toes. The light of a full moon—last night, waning gibbous now through a gauzy screen of cloud—didn’t care where in the world it found you. The bars of the cage which protected the outside world from the wayward wolf were solid as ever.</p><p>The only difference, Remus reflected, was which cadre of tyrants had drilled their flagpoles into the concrete. Although he supposed it didn’t matter as much now that the Wall lay in ruins.</p><p>He had woken early that morning in a cage in West Berlin. Not one of the public cages, thank Merlin, but a private cage at the home of a fellow agent who Remus had never met. Certainly, though, the agent was well-off enough that they could have such an expansive attic in the middle of such a highly-strung city. There had been other oddities in the attic, marble busts atop antique cabinets and cardboard boxes packed tight with empty frames and blank canvases. Remus’ immediate superiors had deemed it unsuitable for him to undergo the transformation in his own home, a bedsit in East Berlin for some years now, when he was due in West Berlin the following evening. Although he resented the imposition on his autonomy, they provided him with Wolfsbane as one of the perks of the job, so he could hardly dissent.</p><p>Remus’ rendez-vous was a short walk from the affluent townhouse, down an alleyway between blocks of flats with no front doors, only garbage cans and stale smoke in the air. It could’ve been anywhere in Remus’ neighbourhood, but it was tinged with surreality. This was more surreal than waking up in an attic with a sculpted bust of a handsome young man eyeing him louchely. Less that the KGB would consider partnering with the CIA in the shadow of the Curtain, more that James—</p><p>James was alive. Lily was alive.</p><p>Sirius was, unfortunately, alive.</p><p>“You’re late.” Sirius was half out of shadow, half lit up streetlight-yellow. His accent was verging on transatlantic after years of misuse. “Do the clocks run differently under communism?”</p><p>“I’m out of touch with the propaganda,” Remus said. “You tell me.”</p><p>“I guess you were playing tourist.”</p><p>The tourist, yes—the tourist in the corner of the cafe reading over case files. How did Sirius know he’d been in West Berlin all day? Unless…</p><p>“It was your house.”</p><p>Sirius shrugged. “They asked me to put up one of the KGB’s wolves for the night. What does it say that I didn’t ask questions? I only found out it was you I’d be meeting when they carried you in, sedated.”</p><p>“To think we’ve been so close by each other and we didn’t know it.”</p><p>Years of windows of opportunity. Special branch had the Trace on all of their agents, so Remus didn’t dare Apparate if he could help it. If he’d known it was walking distance, he would’ve killed Sirius Black as soon as he had the chance.</p><p>“Lily, too,” Sirius said. “She’s in your neck of the woods.”</p><p>“I know.” Remus had read the files; he wasn’t a fucking idiot. What he didn’t understand was why Sirius thought he had any license to say Lily’s name after what he’d done to her and James.</p><p>It was patience that had kept Remus in this job, in East Berlin for so many years. It was patience that would get him through this mission. Get Lily, get to James, get the weapon. Keep up the pretence that these would be spoils for the Americans to share, and then take them solely for the Russians. Betray Sirius like Sirius had betrayed all of them ten years ago.</p><p>“We shouldn’t discuss this on the street,” he said. “Is your house safe?”</p><p>“Safe as it was for you last night. Or do you doubt that too?”</p><p>Sirius had always been like this, pushing buttons until he found the one that broke the circuit. Remus bit his lip; he wouldn’t gratify Sirius with a win. “It’s my training to doubt, as it should be yours, given what you’ve been up to these last nine years.”</p><p>“Whatever you’ve heard,” Sirius said, “I can assure you, not a word of it is true.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>What Remus had heard was this:</p><p>“A Brit,” Minayev had said. “Surfaced in West Berlin around nine years ago—”</p><p>—which had raised Remus’ hackles, but not enough—</p><p>“—and quickly made a name for himself as a con artist. He perfected the magic around art forgery and he knew the art of a deal intimately. In no time at all he was notorious. His only mistake was crossing the Atlantic, peddling his wares in America. The CIA were fast, and pounced on him with a deal: either he spent the rest of his life in a federal prison, or he turned informant and worked for them.”</p><p>“So he turned.”</p><p>“Not quite. At first he chose prison, but finding the security in Alcatraz significantly tighter than in Azkaban, it was not long before he agreed to work for them.”</p><p>That should have been a clue, too.</p><p>“Most of his work was in America, counterintelligence in the few magical communes that remained active beyond the sixties. Our intelligence suggests that he’s been doing much of the same in different parts of Western Europe for the last two years. West Berlin, at the moment.”</p><p>“He seems an unlikely candidate. Why exactly do we need to collaborate with the Americans to pull this off?”</p><p>“Your connection to the Potters alone is not enough.”</p><p>At this, Minayev had grinned, which ought to have given Remus the final push he needed to work it out. That if James was alive, and Lily was alive, then—</p><p>“The agent’s name is Sirius Black. I believe you knew him.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Did you work it out?” Sirius asked.</p><p>“I had no idea until my briefing,” Remus said honestly. “I suppose I never told you any of this at the time; Dumbledore wouldn’t have let me. A week before the—incident, I left on a mission, to work with a werewolf commune outside Moscow. By the time the news reached me there was nothing I could do.”</p><p>By then, Sirius was already in Azkaban, for however long that lasted.</p><p>“So you stayed.”</p><p>“Please. Tell me you were given intel on me before we met.”</p><p>“None,” Sirius said. “Word is there’s a whole department of wolves within the KGB. I didn’t for a moment know you’d be one of them until last night.”</p><p>“And you didn’t think that—given we were going to find Lily and James—”</p><p>Sirius smiled, flinched, flickered back to neutral. “I had spent nine years trying very hard not to think about you.”</p><p>For a moment he was twenty-one again, that easy smile and absolute candour; nobody had ever taught him how to guard his emotions. Then the spy was back, thirty years old but not so far removed from the boy Remus had once thought he’d loved, because Remus had loved anyone who showed him the bare minimum of respect at that age. Sirius the spy leant against the counter of his kitchen, a picture of domesticity in a knitted jumper of the same fading orange of the floor tiles. A cup of hot tea in his hands, steam rising to obscure his face, Remus could pretend if he wanted that this was Abelard’s flat in London. Age and adventure had not dared to lay a finger on Sirius’ good looks, but Remus would not let himself pretend.</p><p>“Well? Are you going to tell me how you wound up here?”</p><p>“There’s precious little to tell. I was with the wolves already. I was recruited.”</p><p>What Remus omitted was this: that there was precious little else for a gay Jewish werewolf stranded in Moscow with no money to his name and no way—no desire—to get home. This was his father’s country, the city Lyall Lupin had been born in, and it wasn’t long before a recruiter found the connection, found all the weaknesses, and used them to keep Remus on their side. It was a familiar procedure—after some years, Remus had been allowed to recruit, too.</p><p>“And you didn’t once think—”</p><p>“I thought you were in Azkaban. Do you want me to go on?”</p><p>Sirius shook his head.</p><p>Remus wondered if Sirius would bother to lie about it. Did Sirius even know that Remus knew about his role in what had happened that night? After all, Remus had been miles away. Either way it was clear that Sirius held no remorse. Perhaps he never thought about it. Perhaps now that they knew James was alive and working for Voldemort, Sirius had decided the time for remorse was over.</p><p>“We should focus on the mission,” Sirius said, setting aside his cup of tea next to the sink. “Go through what we know.”</p><p>“He Who Must Not Be Named is developing a weapon, so we get to the weapon and destroy it, before anyone can have that kind of power.”</p><p>“You’ve heard they say James has been helping him.”</p><p>Remus nodded. “That’s why these need us. Imperius curse, do you think?”</p><p>“That’s what I thought too. There’s no way James would do this of his own accord. Remember that time when we snuck into the Slytherin dorms and…” Sirius trailed off, his smile fading. “Anyway. It would have to be a damn strong Imperius. We used to practise on each other, you know, while you were off on your missions. James had a will of iron. The idea is that we use our history and—we use Lily—to bring him back.”</p><p>“And Harry?” Remus said. “Do you think either of them have him?”</p><p>Sirius shook his head, knuckles whitening against the edge of the sink, peeling formica over damp chipboard. This house had been put together in a hurry, a halfway home for an agent on the move. Remus had lived in places like this. A few minutes and you had already overstayed your welcome. When you were running away from something, or even from a ponderous nothing, you couldn’t afford to stay in one place for long. Lily was in East Berlin—how long had she been running before she ended up there? Of course, it would’ve been easier for her to escape without a child to protect as well as herself.</p><p>Naively, Remus had once thought that he would die during the war. Now he knew that the opposite was always going to be true: he would outlast it all, haunted by the ghosts of everyone who had done more than him, died younger than him. Peter, collateral when atomic Sirius detonated at last. Harry Potter, an infant caught in the middle of it all. James, who was brilliant, but how long before Voldemort saw no more use for him? And what if it had already happened, and all of this was fruitless?</p><p>They had to hope. That was all there was.</p><p>“Let’s sleep,” he said. “We can find Lily tomorrow morning.”</p><p>Find, not search for—they <em>would</em> find her. Remus hadn’t spoken English in so long that he chose his words very carefully.</p><p>“Then we use her,” Sirius said grimly.</p><p>“We ask her to help us,” Remus said. Linguistic vagaries covered for a multitude of sins. “She’ll want to, when she knows what we know.”</p><p>Sirius fixed Remus with a stubborn glare. “When she knows what we <em>want</em> her to know. We tell her we’re using her, Remus. We tell her exactly what we’re planning and we give her the choice. I’m sure your handler told you the same as mine—we don’t need Lily. We need her to get to Snape, who can get us to the Malfoys.”</p><p>Nine years ago, Sirius had known Remus as a kind of spy, someone who had never known anything other than a drowning need to distort the truth. Even now Sirius knew exactly when Remus was turning tricks with words, massaging the worst into something palatable. Remus was almost relieved to be called out on it.</p><p>“Fine,” Remus said. “We don’t need her, so we tell her the truth. And if it all goes tits up, you can be the one to Obliviate her.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>They faced each other in the kitchen, an uneasy silence. A car went by outside, a siren in the distance, someone shouting in German downstairs. Remus looked between the wallpaper and the curtains and the bars on the open window, just to the left of Sirius’ head. Anything to avoid making eye contact.</p><p>“You can sleep in the cage again, if you want,” Sirius said. Remus was not looking, so he couldn’t say whether or not it was accompanied by a smirk.</p><p>“Respectfully, I’ll decline. Do you have a sofa?”</p><p>“I’ll do you one better. Spare bedroom, upstairs on the left.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Remus said. He wasn’t sure.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Of all the places in the world where a dead woman might go to stay dead, you couldn’t pick anywhere better than East Berlin. The orange glow of predawn muddied the grey suburbs stacked with rows of identical plattenbau, and on the quiet streets everyone was dressed the same—you couldn’t find anyone here unless you knew exactly who you were looking for. Or you were a professional.</p><p>“There’s a rumour,” Sirius said, talking softly although there was no-one to overhear them, “that the KBG employs so many werewolves because you’re good at sniffing things out.”</p><p>“Is that why you’re the CIA’s dog, now?”</p><p>“Careful.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Remus said. “Maybe we are better at it than other people. Or we’ve just been doing it longer.”</p><p>This was a Muggle neighbourhood on the other end of town to where Remus had been living, but it was not so far that he couldn’t have made the trip here, tracked her down. Lily’s flat was on the fourth floor of a block not unlike Remus’ own. Remus knew the layout almost by intuition, where he’d find staircases and which corners to turn. He wished Sirius weren’t here. Sirius in his flashy coat was so evidently a stranger to these parts; Remus the local would get further without him hanging around.</p><p>Sirius raised his hand to knock on Lily’s door. He paused, laughing. “I have to remind myself not to call her Evans.”</p><p>“It would certainly be a bad idea to stay here with such a Western name. Potter’s out of the question too.”</p><p>“Let’s hope she’s still Lily, then.”</p><p>He knocked. There was no telltale footfall from within the flat, no shouts of, “Just a second!”</p><p>“There’s no way she knows we’re coming,” Sirius said. It sounded like he was trying to reassure himself more than Remus.</p><p>Ever impatient, Sirius went to knock again, and Remus made a desperate grab at his forearm, pulling him back.</p><p>“Were you trained at all? Never knock twice—it draws too much attention.”</p><p>“For your information, I was not trained,” Sirius said, “unless you count being groomed in the Order.”</p><p>“I wish you wouldn’t say it like that.”</p><p>“That’s not what it was? We were children, Remus, child soldiers being raised to fight the last deadbeat generation’s war for them. And you know what, my <em>training</em> never got me anywhere. So damn your rules, I’m going to knock and there’s nothing you can—”</p><p>The door next to Lily’s inched open. A wizened old woman peered out nervously through the crack. In German, she asked, “Are you English?”</p><p>“Yes,” Remus said. “I’m sorry for the noise.”</p><p>“I’m not the one you should be worried about.” The woman opened her door properly now. “Are you friends of Ms. Gensch?”</p><p>Remus and Sirius exchanged a look. It had to be Lily. An English woman living in this flat—it had to be her, or else their intel was wrong.</p><p>“Do you know if she’s in?” Sirius asked.</p><p>“At this time of day she’ll be at work already. She’s a mechanic—the garage is a fifteen minute walk from here, directly north along this road and then left at the third turn. You won’t miss it.”</p><p>“That’s early to go to work,” Remus mused, slipping back to English momentarily. He cleared his throat. In German, he added, “Er, thank you. You’ve been most kind.”</p><p>“But in the future,” Sirius said, “you shouldn’t go telling everyone you meet where to find your neighbours. You never know what kind of people will come looking for them.”</p><p>The woman shook her head. “I think after so many years she will be happy to hear her own language again.”</p><p>And, Remus thought, if she hadn’t been so trusting they might’ve given up by now. With the old woman’s directions, they set off back down the main road, through lingering gloom even as the sun rose and with it the shadows over the street began to recede.</p><p>The garage was tucked away beneath a brick archway, its doors open but no movement inside or any lights switched on. Remus was hesitant to barge in calling out Lily’s name; he didn’t want to frighten her, but he was sure the sight of him and Sirius would do so anyway. And Sirius was another matter—Lily would know, too, that he was the one who’d sold her and James to Voldemort, the one who’d got them all in this position in the first place. They were all worse off with Sirius here. This was Remus’ worst mission yet.</p><p>So of course Sirius barged in and called out, “Ist Frau Gensch hier? Lily Gensch?”</p><p>“You absolute idiot,” Remus said. Sirius stuck out his tongue.</p><p>The worst part was, it worked. A voice unmistakably Lily’s echoed from the back of the garage: “Wer möchte das wissen?” <em>Who wants to know?</em></p><p>“A couple of old friends,” Sirius said, and Remus elbowed him so hard he stumbled sideways.</p><p>Through the dark of the garage, Remus could just make out movement behind the row of parked cars. Reflexively, he slipped his right hand into his pocket and closed his fingers around his wand. It was a Muggle neighbourhood, so no open carry, but it never hurt to be cautious.</p><p>He sensed the spell shooting through the air towards him before he saw it. Sirius must have too. They both ducked; Sirius recovered faster, jumping to his feet and hurling a shower of sparks into the garage. Fancy magic, nothing more, but if Remus were Lily he might’ve been suitably spooked.</p><p>Sirius shouted, “Don’t make me Stupefy you!”</p><p>“Right, because that’s really going to endear you to—”</p><p>A flash of red behind a car, another spell sent their way.</p><p>“Lily!” Remus called. “Lily, it’s us. It’s me—Remus.”</p><p>A ceasefire. Silence. Then, “Remus?”</p><p> </p><p> </p>

  </p>
</center><p> </p><p>Merlin, it was her. It was really her. Letting go of his wand, Remus rushed forward into the garage, darted between two cars, and there she was, crouching behind a Trabant Universal, both hands grasped around her wand and a look on her face like she couldn’t quite believe it either.</p><p>She sprang to her feet and wrapped her arms around Remus, pulling him into a tight hug. “I thought I’d never see you again. Any of you.”</p><p>“I’m here too, by the way,” Sirius said. He was leaning against the Trabant like a model in a magazine advert.</p><p>Remus clenched his jaw. He was working with Sirius and had no license to attack him for what he did, but Lily had no such convenient excuses. If it was him in her position, Remus reflected, he might have killed Sirius on the spot.</p><p>She did not. She embraced Sirius too, maybe pulling him in even closer—or that was just Remus’ imagination.</p><p>“You broke out of Azkaban,” she said, amazed.</p><p>“Some time ago,” Sirius said. “Sorry I didn’t look for you sooner.”</p><p>“I didn’t want to be found.” Lily stepped back and, in some kind of shock at her own displays of sentiment, put a deal more distance between them than she needed to. “I was so shocked to hear my name—I’ve been going by Liesel. What are you doing here? Why now, of all times?”</p><p>The real question was, why wasn’t she acting like Sirius had delivered her directly into Voldemort’s arms?</p><p>“It’s a long story,” Remus said. “Can we go somewhere private to talk?”</p><p>“I’m the only one here, for now,” Lily said. “I can put up some spells.”</p><p>She waved her wand, and Remus saw Sirius flinch visibly at the state it was in. Remus imagined that his breeding had caught up with him on the continent; a hint of America in his accent but his manners all the British upper classes. Remus wondered what Sirius was noticing about him, whether he’d changed at all.</p><p>Lily hadn’t—her looks had followed her age, a mature version of someone Remus used to know, but recognisable all the same. She reached up to her messy bun, held back by a grease-stained bandana, and slid her wand in between the loose-bound strands. They took to a back-room office and when Lily sat she bounced her leg beneath the desk the way she always used to. As they sat across from her, Remus realised that he was seeing these similarities because he was looking for them, for some sign that this really was Lily, alive. That he was allowed to hope that James might be alive as well.</p><p>“So what happened? How did you end up here?” Sirius asked. So much for telling her directly.</p><p>“You don’t have to answer that,” Remus said, “if it’s too much.”</p><p>Typical Lily, she ignored him. “That night… we had protective spells, but he got past them. We had our secret keeper—so much for <em>him</em>…”</p><p>Remus chanced a glance at Sirius. He didn’t flinch. Could they have given the role to someone else at the eleventh hour?</p><p>“James told me to run,” Lily continued. “I didn’t even think to argue. He said we’d have more luck if we split up, so in turn I told him to take Harry. It was more likely Voldemort would come after me; James, from good pureblood stock, could be of use to him. I was disposable, so I imagined that he might dispose of me. I… made the wrong call.”</p><p>Leaning forward, Sirius said, “What if I told you James might still be alive?”</p><p>“Don’t give me false hope.”</p><p>“It feels false to me, too,” Remus said. “But… I never imagined that you might be alive, either. And here you are.”</p><p>Lily almost smiled. “Here I am.”</p><p>“Okay, enough sentimentality,” Sirius said, “let’s cut to the point. We didn’t track you down for a bit of chit-chat, a catch-up over coffee.”</p><p>“Coffee,” Remus said. “How American.”</p><p>“Yeah, I wondered about the accent,” Lily said.</p><p>“Guess it doesn’t work if I say that I’ve been working for agents unknown, then.” Sirius had the good grace to laugh at himself. “Lily, we’re going to find James. There’s a rumour he’s alive and working for Voldemort himself, helping him build a weapon. If there’s even one word in that sentence that’s true—we’re hoping it’s just the part where he’s alive—then we need to find out.”</p><p>Remus watched for any reaction. “It won’t be… simple.”</p><p>“It might be the opposite of simple,” Sirius said.</p><p>“But we were hoping you might help us anyway.”</p><p>“Alright,” Lily said.</p><p>Of all the strange things that had happened since Remus woke up in a cage in Sirius’ dive, this was by far the strangest. He had expected Lily to argue, to put up some kind of fight. He hadn’t expected it to be so easy. Then again, he thought, she must want to see James more than the two of them put together. If the last time she’d seen James, she’d left him with Harry… no, Remus couldn’t entertain that thought. He wouldn’t raise his hopes any higher than he’d already allowed them to float, unprofessionally uninhibited.</p><p>Sirius leant across the table; he looked eager, surprised as well. “That’s it? You’re in?”</p><p>Lily held out both of her hands. Almost like intuition, Remus knew to take one, and Sirius took the other.</p><p>“This is the best day I’ve had since I moved to this godforsaken city,” she said. “Of course I’m in.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Lily was fascinated by Sirius’ West Berlin neighbourhood, and no matter how many times Remus told her not to stare, she stared. He wondered how long she’d been here. When she’d fled Godric’s Hollow, where had she gone first?</p><p>He didn’t ask her. There were more important items on their agenda.</p><p>They sat around Sirius’ table, steam from their tea rising and fogging the windows—shut tight, of course. There could be no room for error, no chance that anyone might overhear this conversation.</p><p>“So,” Lily said. “What’s the plan?”</p><p>“We have reason to believe that the Malfoys are harbouring Voldemort, somewhere in their villa on the south coast of France,” Sirius said. “I mentioned a weapon earlier. This could make things complicated. Lily—you’re our ticket in there.”</p><p>“So I’ll be acting,” Lily said.</p><p>“We’ll all be acting,” Remus said, in what he hoped was a reassuring tone.</p><p>“We’ve got it all planned,” Sirius said. “The Malfoys might recognise me, disguised or otherwise, so I’ll be out and about the town, seeing what I can dig up. You and Remus will be wife and husband. He’ll be posing as a wealthy Russian pureblood, and you will be… yourself, but a little different. There’s a chance that you’ll be recognised too, so you’ll need plausible deniability. The problem is that they can’t know you’re there looking for James. If the Malfoys twig, it has to seem to them like it was their idea.”</p><p>Remus could pick it up from here. “We’ve heard that James’ progress on the weapon has stalled. If they think they can use you as an incentive…”</p><p>“You want to dangle me in front of them like bait on a fishhook.”</p><p>“Nothing so crude,” Remus said. “But effectively, yes.”</p><p>“It won’t be for long,” Sirius said. It was hideously unfair that, for all his talk of easing her into the idea, he was positioning himself as the good cop. “There’s an old friend of yours at the manor. I’m sure you remember Snivellus—”</p><p>“Severus,” Remus supplied.</p><p>“—Snape. He’s been staying at the villa for some time now. The idea is, you speak to him, get us an in, you and Remus do a little bit of acting so that you have an excuse to snoop around the place, and if any of them recognise, you play dumb.”</p><p>“My persona,” Sirius said, placing a file on the table. Remus noted that it had been scrubbed of any CIA identifiers. “Dick Branigan, expert in all things dark and crusty. Imagine an American Borgin and Burkes. I’m sure such a thing does exist, but whoever they are, we’re pretending it’s me. I won’t be going near the Malfoys—I’ll poke around the town, put my name about as a dealer, see if anyone turns themselves in.”</p><p>“Never would’ve taken you as a grass,” Lily said.</p><p>Sirius only looked fleetingly uncomfortable. “I wasn’t, for a while. Anyway, if I have people grassing on the Malfoys, is it really grassing?”</p><p>“I suppose not,” Lily said. “Sorry. Go on.”</p><p>“Oh, I was about done. Remus?”</p><p>“That brings us to… us.” He smiled awkwardly at Lily, and she patted his hand. “It wasn’t my idea that we should pretend to be married. If people are looking out for a widow, then this way you’ll fly under the radar.”</p><p>“I’ve done worse to keep my identity secret,” Lily said. She didn’t ask whose idea it was. “So who am I?”</p><p>“Liesel Gensch, born and raised in East Berlin. You’ll keep the pseudonym you’ve been using, for simplicity’s sake. You can even be a mechanic, if you want. The idea, though, is that you remain as unassuming as possible. If the Malfoys put two and two together, we don’t want it to be easy for them.”</p><p>Lily nodded. “So they’ll ostensibly be more interested in you.”</p><p>“Right. Ilya Prokofiev. It’s an identity I’ve assumed on several occasions in the past, a reclusive Russian pureblood with a great fortune to his name. No-one from the Prokofiev family is known to appear much in public, preferring to live a shadowy life.”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Sirius said, “they pop up when the Russian Ministry needs a pronouncement from its establishment, and maybe to cut the ribbon on a new building, but otherwise live sequestered away from society in their unplottable mansion in the middle of Siberia. Am I correct?”</p><p>“Yes, the Prokofiev family doesn’t really exist. Well done.”</p><p>“That’s a classic KGB move.”</p><p>“Oh, and who taught you that? All your years in the field, or your bosses at the—”</p><p>Remus paused. Lily was staring at them, her mouth hanging slightly open.</p><p>“The <em>KGB</em>? Remus, what the fuck?”</p><p>He thought about being defensive, or even sensible, about this. Instead, what left his mouth was, “What, like it’s any better than Mister CIA over there?”</p><p>“I knew—I gathered you were working for someone, but I never imagined—”</p><p>“You have to understand,” Sirius said, suddenly solicitous, “in our situations, after the war, there was nowhere we could go. Certainly not back to Britain.”</p><p>“Don’t speak for me,” Remus said. He softened. “It was a similar situation, though. I was stuck in Russia, and I thought everyone I cared about was dead or in prison.” And because this entire conversation was like pouring oil on a fire, he added, “Speaking of prison, Sirius, how was your stint in Azkaban? Does Lily know what you did to get thrown in there?”</p><p>Abruptly, Sirius stood up from the table. “Do <em>you</em> know what I did?”</p><p>“I should be leaving,” Lily said, standing too. “Knowing who you work for, I… need to think about this.”</p><p>Remus took his time joining them. “It’s true we have our allegiances, and it’s true we ought to have told you sooner, but this—this, we’re not doing because of where we’ve been over the last nine years. This is new information. I’m a career spy, but that doesn’t mean I can’t be selfish. We want to see James again. We want you to see James again.”</p><p>Which was not quite the truth, but with any luck Lily would never discover that.</p><p>She nodded. “I’ll be back tomorrow, and we’ll decide where to go from there.”</p><p>“Get home safely,” Sirius said. “Don’t let anyone follow you.”</p><p>“Who are you, my mum?” Lily stuck out her tongue. “I’ll be fine.”</p><p>She would be—the KGB were tailing her every move, and the CIA too for all Remus knew. Nothing would happen to Lily Evans under their watch, and if she veered too close to danger, she would never know it.</p><p>Once she was gone, Sirius made to leave the dining room, but Remus was fast and caught him by the arm before he could get too far. “Who was their secret keeper, Sirius?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Sirius must have seen that Remus was dissatisfied with that answer, so he repeated himself, louder: “I don’t know! I thought… I had an idea of who it might’ve been, but before I had time to work it out I’d been framed.”</p><p>“Peter,” Remus said. “Tell me it wasn’t Peter.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Sirius said again. He changed the subject fast: “You lied to her about our… motivations.”</p><p>“So did you. And I never said I wouldn’t lie. It was you who said you’d tell her the truth.”</p><p>“Alright, I sugarcoated it,” Sirius snapped. “You didn’t want to tell her and—fuck, Remus, it’s <em>Lily</em>. It’s really her. Could you have honestly looked her in the eye and told her we were just using her?”</p><p>“I don’t think we are using her anymore,” Remus said. “I think that when I told her it was selfish, I was beginning to mean it.”</p><p>They stood in silence for too long, looking each other in the eye in a childish staring contest, waiting to see who would fold first. Blinking was no matter, so long as their gazes never faltered. But of course, they were both trained for this, and neither of them would falter. They would stand here all night if they had to.</p><p>At last, Sirius spoke. “I think so, too,” he said. “And that scares me.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>What were mornings for, if not for regretting everything you did the night before? Remus counted every morning he could remember the night before as a success; when he was the wolf, he lost his mind, and other nights he lost it anyway despite his body staying stubbornly the same. It was a terrible imposition. He treasured every lucid morning, those moments of realisation that he knew where he was, and he was still there, still there.</p><p>Waking up in the spare bedroom of Sirius’ dive was no less disorienting than it had been the first time, or than it had been when it was a cage in an attic, but this time it took less time for Remus to find the familiarity in this form and adjust accordingly.</p><p>He heard voices from downstairs.</p><p>Dressed and presentable, Remus waited on the stairwell while Sirius and Lily spoke in the kitchen, loud enough that his spy instincts allowed him to eavesdrop without guilt.</p><p>“It’s still surreal for me,” Lily said. “I’ve had to think over a lot of things these past twenty-four hours. You and Remus—I knew you were alive and out there somewhere, but I didn’t dare hope you’d cross my path. I thought I’d be alone in East Berlin forever.”</p><p>“And what about—”</p><p>“I know what you’re going to say, and I don’t know what happened to him. I don’t want to know.”</p><p>Was it Harry they were talking about, or someone else? Really, it could mean absolutely anything, but if it wasn’t Harry—Remus wasn’t so stupid that he didn’t have an inkling of the implications. He bit his lip. This didn’t mean Sirius was suddenly innocent.</p><p>“I didn’t come here to dwell on the past,” Lily continued. “I’ve come to a decision about your <em>mission</em>.”</p><p>“Tell me you’ll come,” Sirius said.</p><p>“I don’t like the idea that I’m working with you when you’re working for foreign powers. I know you said that this is just you and Remus, doing this of your own will, but you’re only one step away from getting the agencies involved. You can understand why I don’t want that.”</p><p>“Of course. This isn’t some clinical assignment handed out to us on dossiers and organised behind closed doors—”</p><p>Remus bit down on his fingertips.</p><p>“—but something we’re doing for ourselves, because we want to. And we want you to help us, yes, but we want you and James back in our lives”</p><p>So much for telling the truth. As if their lives could ever go back to how they’d been before the war. Sirius had these lofty ideals, which Remus supposed was what came of buying into the American Dream. Remus still felt some residual affection for his old friends—a lot of affection, when the mood overcame him—but that did nothing to negate the fact that his life was in the hands of the KGB. The only certainty he knew was that he had to complete his mission. He had to get the weapon.</p><p>“I know,” Lily said. “And for that, I’ll join you.”</p><p>Remus chose this point to come out of hiding, make his way down the stairs. Sirius could see him coming, but Lily had her back to him.</p><p>“Thank you,” Remus said. “It means the world to us.”</p><p>Lily turned around to smile at him, and Remus’ chest constricted with the heaviness of a lie. He shrugged it off.</p><p>“As a matter of fact, I’d already made up my mind last night.” Lily smiled, her eyes narrowing wickedly. “I wrote to Severus to inform him of my impending arrival, with my husband Ilya Prokofiev.”</p><p>“Impressive,” Sirius said. “That’s the kind of thinking we’d expect from a seasoned agent. Right, Remus?”</p><p>Remus held out a hand. “Welcome aboard, Lily. You’ll fit right in.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Minayev was waiting in the dappled shade of a tree, hat pulled low over his eyes. Remus, too, wore a hat, although he was certain he hadn’t been followed to the park. There had been one suspicious person lingering behind him on the walk, who had come out of a car parked nearby—a foolish move in broad daylight, and Remus had easily given them the slip. If the Americans wanted to know where he was going, they could ask Sirius. Remus had told him he needed a stiff drink. Alone.</p><p>This was not entirely a falsehood. Minayev extended a hand to Remus, holding out his customary hip flask. “You look like you need it.”</p><p>“I’ve made contact with the American,” Remus said. He didn’t move to take the flask, and Minayev let his hand drop. “And we’ve made contact with the dead woman.”</p><p>“Excellent work. Then the plan is in motion. Any word of the dead man and the weapon?”</p><p>“No. No word. The dead woman is as shocked as we were that he’s alive.”</p><p>Minayev raised an eyebrow. “We? Don’t tell me you’re close to the American already.”</p><p>Remus was momentarily at a loss for words. Sirius betrayed him—probably, probably not, but it was easier to believe that—Sirius was still his enemy.</p><p>“We were very close, very long ago,” he said. “Some habits never leave you. It’s helpful; he thinks I’m on his side.”</p><p>“Keep it that way.” Minayev held out his flask again. “You’d better have a swig. We don’t want the American to twig that you haven’t been drinking. He is astute, you know.”</p><p>Of course they’d bugged Sirius’ place. Remus hadn’t said anything too embarrassing, but equally, there was no need for Minayev to have asked if he was getting close to the American. It was an inevitability, almost, that this would be the case for two people with such a tapestry of history between them.</p><p>“Drink,” Minayev insisted.</p><p>“I suppose I have no choice.” Remus took the flask and downed the lot of it in one go. If it went straight to his head, then so be it. He could operate just as well under the influence.</p><p>Minayev patted his arm. It was a habit of his, an avuncular affectation to disguise the fact that Remus had no choice, again, but to be here.</p><p>A sway to his step, Remus walked back through the quiet streets to where Sirius and Lily were waiting for him. They must have thought it was so good of Remus to be doing this. To rescue James—but the truth of it was that James’ survival had nothing to do with Remus’ mission. His oldest friend was a means to an end. Wasn’t that just delightful?</p><p>Back at the house, Sirius was packing up all his effects. The house would fall to another American. Or it would be torched. Sirius was in the kitchen, putting his mugs in a box.</p><p>“Never the same city twice,” Remus said.</p><p>Sirius flashed him a smile. “I already broke that rule. Lily’s heard back from our old nemesis, so if all goes well we’ll have a way in. France sounds nice, doesn’t it? Maybe I’ll settle there next.”</p><p>“As if they’d let you choose.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t choose some beautiful seaside town, anyway,” Sirius said. “Maybe for a holiday. But I left my heart in London.” He paused, sizing Remus up. “I didn’t think you’d really drink in the middle of the day. You’re pissed.”</p><p>“Terribly so,” Remus said. He wasn’t. The affectation was easier than the truth. “Is it any wonder? I’m sick of this city.”</p><p>“I’m sick of the lot of it,” Sirius said. “Still. We do what we must.”</p><p>Remus turned to leave, but thought the better of it. He stopped in the doorway, his back to Sirius. “Only a few more hours. Good riddance to this bloody city.”</p><p>And if the Russians heard that—their hands were tied, too. Remus was their problem as much as they were his. It was much harder to assassinate a wizard than a regular Muggle agent. You couldn’t cut your secrets loose when they had the means to retaliate. The most fun Remus could have was this, whispers of transgression and a momentary connection shared with his enemy.</p><p>Remus wasn’t even sure of that.</p>
