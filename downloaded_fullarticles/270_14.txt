    <p>George Weasley could not bear to look into the mirror.</p>
<p>He felt lost. Hollow. Empty. A part of him was gone. In one moment, his brother was next to him, throwing jokes and gearing up for the battle; in the next he was kneeling on the floor, hugging the cold, dead body of-</p>
<p>They both knew that there would be casualties. That there would be deaths. They never thought it would be one of them.</p>
<p>To think that they both wouldn't survive or that they wouldn't die together was unimaginable. That one of them died whilst the other had to try his best to go on without the other part of their <em>soul</em>-</p>
<p>It was unthinkable. Impossible and far out of realm of possibilities for them.</p>
<p>And yet, here was George, gaze averted from the mirror.</p>
<p>His eyes close, lips twisted in contempt as he tries to forget the silence and the lack of warmth next to him.</p><hr/>
<p>He managed to glimpse himself in the mirror once. And he saw ginger hair framing a freckled face and for a second, he thought he was seeing Fr-him. But he noticed the mangled ear and he remembered that his twin was not here and he was alone for the first in his life because they always had each other and now-</p>
<p>He comes to with a bloody hand and dried tear tracks. His mum crouched next to him, her own eyes glazed over with tears. She was trying her hardest to stop her bottom lip from wobbling as she gently gathered up his hands. The glass shards from the mirror were scattered on the bathroom floor, some of them were covered in his blood.</p>
<p>He couldn't bring himself to care about that.</p>
<p>The rest of his family walked on eggshells around him – apart from Ginny and Ron. That's not to say that they acted the same as before. They were more conscious, more understanding of him. They understood why he would sometimes jump at the slightest sound. They knew how to help him through the flashbacks.</p>
<p>His parents also knew this from the first war, but they were stuck. They were stuck in that they couldn't imagine their own son having flashbacks that their friends and war veterans suffered from. And they did know how to help him from a flashback, but George always saw this flash in their eyes, a flash of helplessness and the certainty that they somehow failed as parents. Bill and Charlie had some knowledge from the war when they were little, but it did not help them now, with their younger siblings fallen to pieces and slowly trying to pick them up. And Percy-</p>
<p>George knew that Percy blamed himself. Could see it in how Percy avoided him, eyes averted whenever they met. And for a time (for a few gruelling <em>weeks</em>), George blamed him the most as well. If F-he wasn't distracted by Percy's joke, by Percy being there then maybe, maybe he would be here next to George rather than-. But now, he just had no energy. What was the point in blaming Percy? It's not like it would do anything, achieve anything. In the end it was no one's fault apart from the other side that murdered Fr-</p>
<p>It was the fault of the other side. And it didn't change the fact that he was de-<em>gone</em>. What was the point in blaming. What was the point in anything.</p>
<p>He didn't comfort his parents. He didn't tell Percy that he didn't blame him. He was just so tired.</p>
<p>So, when Ron barged into his room, George glanced over at him tiredly, before focusing his gaze back to the ceiling with its' charmed sky, the clouds drifting along with no distinguishable shapes amongst them. What was the point, he wondered again. He could see Ron frown in the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>"Oi, you gonna get up yet?" George didn't even bother looking at him. "It's already past noon and you're just laying in bed? C'mon, we have stuff to do," Ron huffed at him and George stared at him in astonishment, since when did he have stuff to do? Ron's frown became heavier.</p>
<p>"C'mon then, you big lump!"</p>
<p>And that was the beginning.</p><hr/>
<p>Ron dragged him to help rebuilding efforts of-</p>
<p>Well, the entire wizarding world. Many places had been damaged – some beyond repair. Some needed curse breakers to be sorted out. Others were torn down to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>"Quite a lot of people are sorting out Hogwarts," Ron was telling him, absentmindedly clearing the rubble with a wave of his wand. "But we – you know, me, Harry, Hermione and a few others - thought you'd appreciate helping somewhere else," 'somewhere where you didn't see your twin die' went unspoken, but heard.</p>
<p>From where he was clearing an office, George couldn't help, but be grateful for Ron and his help.</p>
<p>And so, George started helping to re-build the Ministry of Magic and if he felt a spark of glee at burning Umbridge's horrible office well-</p>
<p>It was a good to feel something again.</p><hr/>
<p>"Does it hurt?" It sounds loud, too loud in the quiet living room. Harry freezes from where he's sat on the couch. He then glances up from his papers, glasses askew and the sun shining from the window onto him.</p>
<p>"What does?" Harry's brows furrow, but the question sounds stiff, as though he already knows what George will say. George avoids his gaze.</p>
<p>"Dying." </p>
<p>Harry exhales sharply and George can feel his gaze burning in the side of his neck.</p>
<p>"No," he pauses and George looks at him. He meets his gaze and there's something heavy, something that George cannot describe, lurking behind his eyes. And he cannot look away from that. "Not at all," the words come out softly, and like a siren's call, George is drawn to them, hanging onto each word. "Quicker and easier than falling asleep."</p><hr/>
<p>Ministry for Magic was rebuilt in no time with Kingsley as the minister. He heard that they had plans to pass a lot of laws in effect in the next few months.</p>
<p>"The wizarding world feels guilty," Hermione was telling him and Lee Jordan one summer afternoon. Law books were opened around her and there was frantic and gleeful air about her as she went on looking through them all. Some of the books had their pages rapidly flipped with magic. Others were shutting themselves shut. A lot of them had bright papers ('post-it notes' Hermione explained as though it meant anything to him) in them.</p>
<p>"They should," Lee commented, picking up a book and flicking through it. "The children had to fight the war that should have never happened due to cowardice whilst they sat at home, doing nothing," he shut the book and put it back, before picking up another. "But what does it have to do with passing laws?"</p>
<p>"Because they feel guilty, they will do their best to make it up to us, so to speak," Hermione said with a grim smile, putting a green post-it at the top of the page and a pink one near the bottom. "They will let us make laws, so we best make sure the most important ones get passed first to make sure this never happens again."</p>
<p>"Like laws against discrimination? And more equal rights for other creatures?" George asked and Hermione smiled triumphantly at him.</p>
<p>"Yes, exactly that," she said pleased with herself.</p>
<p>"You seem confident," George said at last.</p>
<p> <a name="chp1return1" rel="nofollow" id="chp1return1"></a>"Audentes fortuna iuvat," <em>fortune favours the bold, </em>she said with bared teeth, and for a moment he remembered that Hermione was a vicious thing. She was the one that charmed the parchment to disfigure anyone who broke their word for DA. And that was just when she was 16 <sup><a title="click here to see footnote" href="#chp1note1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup>. Never mind the whole SPEW thing, the war they all took part in and the death eaters she helped to capture.</p>
<p>If anyone could bring change about, it would be Hermione with her viciousness for justice and her steadfast loyalty.</p><hr/>
<p>Little by little, George started to pick up pieces of his life and to glue them together, forming a visage of a person he once was. He still could not look into the mirror, refused to. But slowly, he started getting out of his room on his own. Started to take actual bites of his food. Started to engage with his family and his friends. Started to slowly feel again, to <em>live</em> again.</p>
<p>But he wanted to do more than start living. He wanted to do something.</p>
<p>He hasn't had motivation like this since Freddie.</p>
<p>And yet, his soul still <em>ached</em>.</p><hr/>
<p>The ministry was mostly repaired, with the rest being left to professionals to sort out the plumbing and any nasty leftover curses. And so, they moved onto cleaning Diagon Alley and the surrounding alleys of all the undesirable posters, all the cursed items (using magic or gloves to pick them up) and the rubble leftover from any fights or acts of vandalism.</p>
<p>It was whilst cleaning the rubble that George realised what he could do.</p>
<p>The Weasley Wizarding Wheezes stood steadily in the alley, smeared with rotten fruit and vegetables and plastered with the Undesirable(s) No. posters. The doors were locked shut and it was clear that the damage was only on the outside. The two animated figures of him and his brother were smashed into pieces, but that was the only thing that the death eaters managed to truly ruin. And even though he couldn't bear to look into a mirror and see his brother, even though he refused to look at pictures of himself or at the clock in the Burrow with Fred's spoon pointing at Unknown-</p>
<p>He felt rage at them destroying the statues, destroying something that they worked so hard on together, destroying the dream that they had-</p>
<p>But wasn't that what George was doing? Refusing to go back into the shop and start making? To re-open the joke shop and-</p>
<p>He could do so much if he opened it back up.</p>
<p>George looked at the broken faces of the statutes and he swore he could feel their judgement upon him.</p><hr/>
<p>He asked his family and friends for help. He couldn't fix it by himself and he knew that, even if asking for help felt like the most difficult thing to do. But just the thought of going into the shop where he and Freddie once were inventing, parchments full of Fred's handwriting and ideas scattered around their workroom caused an unpleasant lurch in his stomach. He hasn't been there since Fred, staying at the burrow with his family where he slept in Bill's room instead of their old room. A decision made by his family after the mirror breaking (and oh, how he  remembers at the time feeling the anger shimmer low in his belly at the thought that he was no longer in control, that they were speaking over him and deciding for him what was best, that they thought "I know better than George" and moved him away from what was once theirs, and didn't they see that he needed to stay there, close to Fred and their stuff-). He still resented them for it a bit, but he knew staying there would have been worse for him in the beginning.</p>
<p>His family was very supportive with the joke shop. It was weird to see his mum, fluttering around, asking about his plans for the shop. A distant part of his mind couldn't help but to wish that she was like that the first time they proposed the idea.</p>
<p>The next day he was stood in front of the shop, Ron on his right and Charlie on his left. Lee and Angelina were behind them. All of them had their arms full of supplies and lunches ("you need some food if you're going to be working hard!" His mum said, blinking rapidly to dissipate her tears as she looked at him with hope).</p>
<p>He took out the key and stepped forward.</p><hr/>
<p><a name="chp1return2" rel="nofollow" id="chp1return2"></a>The inside was how he remembered, just how they left it, down to the half-finished display in the corner they were putting up. Walking around, George could see the dust lazily floating around as they disturbed it from its' place. In the corner, he could see the curtains move slightly, making him tense. Further investigation with wands raised and a <em>homenum revelio</em> showed that it was not human, and upon lifting the curtains revealed Doxys<sup><a title="click here to see footnote" href="#chp1note2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>"I thought we were done with Doxys," Ron scowled at the Doxys, who blew raspberries in his direction. Charlie put a restraining hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"It could be useful," Lee said, sending some bubbles in the Doxys direction with a flick of his wand. They snapped at the bubbles and when they popped, startled, their sharp teeth bared as they snarled at the bubbles. Lee turned towards George. "Didn't you experiment with their venom for the Skiving Snackboxes?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, we did use them for the skivvies," he said and added "but not that much, and we made sure that in the experimental stage to start with a small drop and then keep adding. Look," he said to Charlie who was giving him a look, "we made sure to have the antidote on hand and that only one of us at a time was testing it. And we didn't hurt the little buggers, just took their venom mostly," Charlie glanced away and turned towards the Doxys.</p>
<p>"So maybe you could try doing something else with them?" Ron said, still giving the Doxys a stink eye and redirecting the conversation.</p>
<p>George scratched his chin.</p>
<p>"But what could he do?" Lee piped up, as Angelina started passing the Doxycide around the group.</p>
<p>"Dunno, they managed to work out that in small doses it causes the user to be ill, I'm sure he can figure something else out," Ron then decisively sprayed one of the Doxys with the Doxycide, watching in glee as it fell.</p>
<p>"There are many avenues that you could research," Angelina added, as she joined Ron in paralysing the Doxys. "It doesn't necessarily have to be for consuming, maybe it has some properties on the skin or hair?" She theorised.</p>
<p>After that they all got to work, leaving George's mind to whirl.</p><hr/>
<p>He looked at the layout of the shop and decided that no, that was not going to work anymore. Charlie wasn't helping this time, Hermione having dragged him away to help draft some laws for creatures and wrangled out a promise from Lee that he would pop by later to help her more. George managed to snag Oliver Wood and Alicia Spinnet into helping though, so maybe shifting the layout of the shop wouldn't be too difficult</p>
<p>"Do we need to take some of the products down by hand?" Alicia asked George as Oliver and Angelina looked on in horror, as Lee looked at them in amusement.</p>
<p>"By hand?" Angelina said incredulously, staring at the towering walls surrounding them. George blinked at them in confusion, before a figurative lightbulb went off in his head, he turned towards the products, hiding a shadow of a grin on his face from them as he did so.</p>
<p>"Some of the products are sensitive to magic," and with that he pointed to the signs, 'DO NOT USE MAGIC ON THESE, AVERSE REACTIONS,' floating in mid-air on some shelves. "We had special runes in place and stuck those signs on the barriers to make sure the customers didn't try that, along with putting the warnings on the packaging in big letters," he explained.</p>
<p>They still looked at him in slight horror, Lee starting to put the products into boxes in the background.</p>
<p>"So," George said in a false cheery voice, "all the magic-aversive products have that sign along with a barrier. So, if you reach out your hand to take the object, you should feel and see a faint passing of magic as you reach out for it." And he did just that to show them. A faint rippling could be seen around his hand as it passed the barrier.</p>
<p>"But isn't that dangerous? They could have it in their trunks, lift them with magic and then bam, the product reacts?" Alicia asked, nervously eyeing the products.</p>
<p>"Well," George grimaced slightly, "that's more sensitive in terms of trying to change the shape of the products, so anything that would change the properties of the objects. Imagine some of the kids trying to change the Canary Creams so that the person changes into a dog by trying to make it look like a dog rather than a canary. Gives me nightmares that does! Lifting them by magic will not damage them, you could do it in fact. But the barrier stops all magic, including levitation. Mostly because we didn't want the kids smashing anything by accident," George explained.</p>
<p>Angelina sighed.</p>
<p>"Let's get to it then," she said, rolling up her sleeves and setting off towards the nearest shelf. The others joined her.</p>
<p>"Or," George began slowly, and they looked at him, "I could always power down the runes so we can use magic." In the background, Lee stared at the half full box in front of him.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, power down the runes? I always had to do it by hand!" He huffed, throwing his hands up, staring in betrayal at the box in front of him and at George. A small smirk lit up George's face.</p>
<p>"We didn't know you didn't know and then you did the first product by hand all that time ago, we didn't have the heart to tell you otherwise, you were so proud of yourself..."</p>
<p>Lee narrowed his eyes and then sent a stinging hex at George who quickly put up a shield to absorb it and then sent a hex of his own back in good measure.</p>
<p>"So, magic?" Oliver asked, waving the boxes over and George nodded, heading to the back room to power them down as Lee reflected the hex.</p><hr/>
<p>They worked in silence for a few hours.</p>
<p>"How do you plan on doing the layout?" Lee asked George from where he finished up filling one of the boxes, making a face at George as a bird made of light swooped towards him. George batted it away from his face.</p>
<p>"I was thinking of splitting it up slightly," he said and started gesturing at the store, the front in particular. "I was thinking I could have the left side and right front as the joke stuff, the tamer ones around the doorway," he turned to his left and then caught himself, he then quickly pointed at the right side of the store in the back as if the lapse didn't happen "and then I was thinking of making a new line of products in the top right, focusing on well-," here he trailed off a bit, but none of the others pressured him to continue, focusing on their boxes and giving him a moment to collect himself.</p>
<p>He took that moment and then he continued. "It's hard to ask for help from other people, and then you don't always want to admit you need it, so I thought, wouldn't it be great if there were some products that could help you with it? Hermione was telling me how when people have anxiety they can have panic attacks and problems breathing and I thought, what if I modified a bubble-head charm and add some extra stuff to help the person calm down?" Here he looked at the others, who had stopped packing away the merchandise and were staring at him with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"I thought it would be a good idea, to make a line of products to help people with their mental health."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence and George busied himself with closing up the boxes.</p>
<p>"Sounds like a great idea mate!" Lee said, and George could see him reaching out slowly to give him a clap on the back, giving him time to move back. George held himself still and smiled at Lee in return. The others then surged forward, smiles on their faces and supportive words falling from their lips.</p>
<p>George's smile grew until his eyes crinkled up. It felt good to truly smile.</p><hr/>
<p>The research was not slow per se, but it wasn't fast either. It was taking George time to try and come up with some of the ideas. Usually, he would bounce the ideas of his twin and they would come up with something, a hundred ideas falling from their lips, more outrageous than the last, but now-</p>
<p>"Oi George!" Ron barrelled into the backroom, arms laden with papers with only his tuft of hair sticking out above them. "I have some ideas for you from 'Mione, something about Glumbumbum and Alinhesav leaves or something-"</p>
<p><a name="chp1return3" rel="nofollow" id="chp1return3"></a>"Glumbumble and Alihosty leaves<sup><a title="click to see footnote" href="#chp1note3" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup>," George corrected him as Ron all but threw the papers onto the empty desk near George.</p>
<p><a name="chp1return4" rel="nofollow" id="chp1return4"></a>"Yeah that," he waved his hand in George's direction as he started to take off his jacket, scarf and hat. "And how it could help with depression? Something about balancing the melancholy of the insects and the hysteria induced by the leaves? I dunno, you'll have to look at the papers. Lee also told me to tell you that he should be along in a few; he had an idea for some kind of new prank product, something to do with modifying the Anteoculatia spell<sup><a title="click to see footnote" href="#chp1note4" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup>, I think. And I," he waved his wand and the jacket, scarf and hat flew to the hooks by the door. "Also came up with an interesting idea!" A moment of silence and then Ron swivelled his head to look at George.</p>
<p>"You alright there, mate?" He asked and George couldn't help, but smile.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I am. What was your idea?" Ron perked up and started gesturing wildly.</p>
<p>"Alright so there's a spell to repel spiders and I was thinking what if you could make it into a charm to help people not only with spider phobias but with other ones as well-"</p>
<p>"The spell would probably work on other insects with some modification to it-"</p>
<p>"Yeah, 'cos the spell is <em>Arania Exumai</em>, so if we swap <em>Arania</em> with whatever the Latin for insect is-"</p>
<p>And now while there was no Fred, he still had many others willing to make their dream a reality.</p>
