    <p>Prologue</p>
<p>Unknown Location, 2007</p>
<p>''It seems you've finally joined us, Mr. Potter." A male voice said out loud, only to be answered by the grunt of a teenager, tied to a chair, covered with bruises and dry blood, complimented by a damaged black leather outfit. Harry Potter growled as he tried to break free, but without success.</p>
<p>''W-What the hell?'' Harry stuttered.</p>
<p>''Those chains are capable of blocking your magical abilities, which means that your little tricks are null, same thing goes with this room. You should thanks, Amelia Bones for this idea. Now, you're all mine Mr. Potter'' the man explained. The raven-haired teenager looked at his surrounding, noticing that the walls were completely engraved with runes. At the same time, he noticed three strangers staring at him with calm and collected expression. The first person was a Caucasian man in his forties; he had short brown hair with blue eyes. He had worn a blue marine costume and had clasped his hands behind his back. The second person was a Caucasian woman in her twenties; she had short brown hair in a bob with icy blue eyes. Her outfit was dark blue catsuit with an odd logo. The last person was a tall black man with a black eye-patch on his right eye; he was bald and had a goatee. He wore a black outfit with a long black coat. Harry stared at the newcomers with annoyance and yet curiosity.</p>
<p>''Did someone tell you that you look exactly like Samuel Jackson'' Harry sneered at the last man, waiting for a reaction. However, to his displeasure, the man didn't react.</p>
<p>''Really? The silent treatment? I wouldn't mind if only I knew the reason why I got kidnapped by the Legendary Nick Fury and his cronies of SHIELD?'' Harry said with nonchalance.</p>
<p>Fury snorted at his question. ''You believe that I will let The Boy Who Lived and Charlus Potter's grandson roaming free in the streets of New York, blowing apartment buildings and causing trouble everywhere he goes? No, Mr. Potter, I am not going to let the saviour of the Wizarding World walking free and creating chaos in the New York City.''</p>
<p>''You've got the wrong guy Fury. Wade Wilson is the exact definition of a trouble magnet.''</p>
<p>''Deadpool is at least productive with money. You, on another hand, are a nasty piece of work, a wild card and a troublemaker just like your father. Creating problems everywhere he goes.'' The mention of his late father made the young wizard smile.</p>
<p>''Got to keep the tradition alive Director. By the way, nice try with your agent, but unfortunately, I'm not too red-headed. He looks too far creepy to my taste if you catch my drift.''</p>
<p>''You think this is funny? You almost killed one of my best agents!'' Harry mentally smirked, knowing that he had found a sensitive spot.</p>
<p>''What did you expect? Your agents seem to be far more perfect to be a teacher. Which muggle teacher teaches Latin?"</p>
<p>''We found her in a comatose state in a dumpster in Hell Kitchen, stripped naked, do you have something related to that?'' the another man asked with a cool tone. Harry shrugged his shoulders. ''Not really, Sue and Blaise never liked the agents from the Red Room. I couldn't blame them for that. Nobody likes a child murderer,'' Harry sensed an amount of dark emotions above his head, concluding that someone was watching them at this instant.</p>
<p>''So, someone is watching us and yet I don't see any cameras. Probably some tech from Stark Industries? I wonder how Tony is going to react when he is going to learn that SHIELD is using his tech behind his back.'' Fury seemed to frown at the mention of Tony Stark.</p>
<p>''Nothing. You are going to keep your mouth shut on this one Potter.''</p>
<p>''Or what? You will torture me, be my guest. Threaten my family? They're all dead!'' Fury didn't respond to his rant.</p>
<p>The female agent handed him some electronic device and he showed it to the young wizard. Curious, Harry stared at the small screen. Clearly he didn't like whatever was shown on the screen as his eyes narrowed dangerously.</p>
<p>''How did you get that?'' Harry seemed annoyed.</p>
<p>''Eyes everywhere Potter, I place agents all around the world as well. And I've got my only good eye on you since you walked in this city. You're a wild card Mr. Potter and you seem to be the only one who has a good idea of the current situation.'' Harry didn't answer the unasked question or made any kind of movement. His eyes still glued to the small screen.</p>
<p>''What do you want to know Fury?''</p>
<p>''Everything from the start would be appreciated'' The other man asked with a grin that annoyed the younger man.</p>
<p>''Did I speak to you, Principal Coulson?'' Harry asked with a sneer.</p>
<p>''If you care about your grade Mr. Potter, then you must.''</p>
<p>''Then I guess that parents would like to hear that the principal of the Empire State High School, violated his student's privacy. Then again, it is crazy what we can do with photoshop. Don't you think mate?'' Harry and the man named Coulson, started a glaring contest to Fury's irritation and the woman's amusement.</p>
<p>''Agent Coulson!'' the brown haired man broke his staring contest with the black haired wizard.</p>
<p>''Don't make things harder then they're now Potter, you're in deep shit. I need to know what happened or there is a cell with your name written on it.'' Harry stayed silent, annoyed by his current situation.</p>
<p>''I'm ready to talk, but not in front of your lapdogs. The members of SHIELD have the strange habit of twisting the words of their prisoners.'' He exclaimed. Once again, Nick Fury said nothing as he and his subordinates left the strange room. A few moments later, a newcomer entered the room, revealing herself to be a stern looking woman. She had long red hair asymmetrically parted on her right side and gray eyes. She wore a black business suit with a black turtleneck. Her blazer's cuffs and the lower part had clamshell-like designs. Accessory-wise, she wore a necklace an earrings; and a few dark hair clips could be seen by her right ear. She had painted her fingernails violet.</p>
<p>''Mr. Potter, it been a while.'' The woman said without waiting for any reaction from The Boy Who Lived. If Harry was surprised, he didn't show it. She conjured a chair from nowhere, and then sat in front of the teenager.</p>
<p>''Mrs. Bones, we meet again. How is Britain doing without their forsaken saviour?'' Harry sneered at which Amelia Bones didn't even flinch, instead, she looked at him with sorrowful eyes.</p>
<p>''Drop the act Harry, I'm not here to arrest you, but to talk. Can we have a civilized conversation? At least for Sirius' sake?'' By the end of her sentence Harry had dropped his smirk and he stared at her with a neutral expression.</p>
<p>''How's Sirius?''</p>
<p>''He's fine most of the time. He misses you quite a lot.''</p>
<p>''Unlike the whipping werewolf." Harry stated with bitterness in his voice. The older woman didn't correct him, thinking that would worsen the current situation.</p>
<p>''Now, I want every detail from day one to this day.''</p>
<p>''Well, I was born the last day of the seventh month from my mother va-'' Harry started but he was interrupted by the red haired woman.</p>
<p>''Not that kind of details!'' Amelia was clearly embarrassed.</p>
<p>''Then, you have to be more specific. For real, it all started when my fat ass of uncle dropped me out in London.''</p>
<p>London, 2004</p>
<p>Silence, it was something uncharacteristic that didn't fit his uncle's hot-tempered personality. Harry expected insults, cries or even a dark glare full of hatred, but surprisingly, he got nothing. Since Vernon Dursley had picked him up from the train station, he hadn't made a sound, only putting his attention on the road. The trip was very awkward for the young wizard. It was not like Harry minded, actually he was surprised that Vernon didn't call him boy or freak till now. The silence was what the young wizard needed after another year risking his neck and saving his godfather, Sirius Black, a man wrongly framed for a crime he didn't commit and the best friend of his late father. The young wizard couldn't help but wonder where the fugitive was right now. Suddenly the car stopped and Harry turned his head towards Vernon who turned off the engine and clenched the steering wheel so hard that his hands turned purple.</p>
<p>''Why are we stopping?'' The plump man didn't reply as he took a large sum of money from his pocket and threw it away on Harry's faded jeans.</p>
<p>''This is ten thousand pounds. I want to you to get out of our house for the summer.'' Vernon said bluntly. Harry didn't understand what was happening. Firstly, his uncle didn't insult him, he was in the middle of London and his uncle just gave him a large amount of cash. How the hell did Vernon Dursley found this much amount of money was a wonder.</p>
<p>''W-What! You want me to be out for the rest of summer?'' Harry didn't show it but he was happy, because he now had the possibility to have a good summer instead of a crappy one. Although, he never understood why he had to return to the Dursley Residence every summer. Apart from the chores, they had shown in a subtle way that they didn't want him in their lives, the feeling was shared mutually.</p>
<p>''Listen, Boy! Those three last summers had become disastrous because of your freakishness and after what happened to Marge I came to the conclusion that it was for the best of the family to send you away.''</p>
<p>''When you say family, do you mean you, Dudley and Petunia? Because I'm not sure we are close enough to be considered family.'' Harry said lazily, ignoring the bulging vein on Vernon's neck.</p>
<p>''Do you think we care about you boy?'' Harry wondered if this was a real question or a rhetorical one, so he decided not to reply anyway.</p>
<p>''I have given you enough money to hold your own for two months. You can do whatever you want. You can even visit your freakish friends, I don't care as long as you stay away from us.'' It sounded to be too good to be true. He would have two months to do whatever he wanted and he could even join Ron or Hermione anytime he desired.</p>
<p>''Give me double and you will not see me for two years.'' Harry said bluntly as he tried to extract more money from his uncle. The black haired teenager had so much to do and catch up. Vernon's pink face changed to a purple shade but he decided to let it go and gave him the same amount as in Harry's hands again. Harry gladly took the money but just then Vernon grabbed his wrist furiously.</p>
<p>''You better hold your part of the arrangement boy or I'll make sure that you will regret the day you were born.'' Rather then showing fear, Harry glared at the heavyweight man and broke his strong grip.</p>
<p>''You wish fat-ass'' Harry took his suitcase and Hedwig's cage from the backseat and sent a last glare to Vernon as he got out of the car for the final time, closing the door hard. Rather than wasting time, Vernon Dursley quickly ignited the engine, and left the young teenager alone in London with twenty thousand pounds in his hands, a large suitcase, and an owl. Oh how this could go wrong.</p>
<p>The young wizard was about to enjoy his new freedom when he saw a young man, sitting on the pavement with a broken bottle of wine near his feet. At first, the young teenager thought it's was a drunkard but the man's clothes were looking far too expensive to belong to a drunkard. Harry would have continued his way toward the Leaky Cauldron but somehow, he couldn't leave the man alone. Summoning his courage, he tapped on the stranger's shoulder to attract his attention. He waited for a couple of seconds until the man finally stared at the young wizard's emerald green orbs with his brown eyes.</p>
<p>''What the fuck do you want kid?''</p>
<p>A Few Minutes Ago</p>
<p>It was official, something or someone in this universe hated Tony Stark with a furious passion. He officially hated the position of CEO of his father's company; he had lost a secretary for the third time this month. The board was pressuring him to deliver a new product, and the media had predicted the fall of the company by his hands. But, the young man didn't care about that. Today, was the day of Jarvis' funeral and the young millionaire couldn't take it at all. Edwin Jarvis, the man who raised him as the father he never had, died in his sleep after a long fight with depression. Tony couldn't bear himself to stare at the lifeless body of his butler and the last link with his parents. The man did everything in his power to make him better after they were dead, and he was too proud to say thank you.</p>
<p>Like his father always said, "Stark men are made with iron. Crying is a sign of weakness.'' Ton stared at the bottle of wine for a while. In rage, he threw the bottle against the ground.</p>
<p>''Nice job Stark. You break a bottle of wine that costs six hundred pounds. Howard would be so proud.'' The young adult was lamenting to himself when he felt a touch on his shoulder and he saw a young boy staring at him with bright green eyes, covered by the biggest pair of glasses that he ever seen.</p>
<p>''What the fuck do you want kid?'' Harry was taken by surprise by the blunt question of the young man. He noticed that the man spoke with a strange accent.</p>
<p>''I-I'm sorry sir, but I thought you were drunk?'' Harry chose his words carefully, noticing the annoyed expression of the tanned man.</p>
<p>''Wish I was then I would not be thinking about this damn funeral'' Tony glared hardly at the bottle.</p>
<p>''Funeral? Someone you know died?'' Tony hesitated to reveal his reasons to come to Great Britain. But since the kid was obviously not a journalist, he could avoid a scandal, for the fourth time this week.</p>
<p>''My butler...He died last week and...Here I am, alone in London, with a ten years old four-eyed kid.'' Harry's eyes narrowed at the remark about his age.</p>
<p>''I'm thirteen actually.'' Harry said with frustration.</p>
<p>''Really? Whoa, kid, your parents must not feed you enough.'' Tony tried to ease the atmosphere until he noticed the words coming from his mouth.</p>
<p>''I'm sorry kid. I didn't mean that your parents are poor. But, by judging your clothes and your height, a man can be mistaken or maybe it's the truth and I can't control what I said.'' Tony stopped as he glanced at the young boy. Harry's confused face had turn absolutely blank at the mention of his parents.</p>
<p>''My parents are dead.'' Harry said simply.</p>
<p>''Really? Whoa! This is awkward'' Tony scratched the back of his head and tried to find something to appease the atmosphere that had turned awkward in a blink.</p>
<p>''It's alright. My parents have been dead since when I was of fifteen months'' Thais statement surprised Stark.</p>
<p>''Really?'' Harry nodded his head.</p>
<p>''They died in a car accident'' Tony's mouth dropped.</p>
<p>''So did mine..'' Harry was taken off-guard by his answer.</p>
<p>''Really? You parents are dead too?'' The young wizard did feel bad at lying about the true demise of his parents to the stranger. Although, he didn't understand why he shared this kind of information with the young man.</p>
<p>''Yeah...They died three years ago, on Christmas Eve'' Tony said softly as old memories emerged from deep in his mind.</p>
<p>''I guess life puts us in the club of dead parents'' Harry said dryly which made the tanned man laugh softly.</p>
<p>''The club of dead parents, I like it. Doesen't gives the full details but explains everything. And we don't need to explain all this bullshit.'' They both sit on the concrete pavement, ignoring their surroundings.</p>
<p>''We could start a club right away, we already have two members.''</p>
<p>''It's quite morbid you know kid, but quite true...wonder why it is so easy talking with you rather than my friends or the psychologist?''</p>
<p>'Well except one' Tony thought/</p>
<p>''Because, they said that they could try to understand the pain. But in reality, they don't and they mean well but... in the end, their pity means nothing.'' Harry said, thinking of Ron and Hermione.</p>
<p>''Dark, but true...So I guess you've got to return to your guardian or something?'' Harry shook his head in negative.</p>
<p>''Actually, no. My relatives gave me enough money to be out of their life for the entire summer. But, I don't complain. I can do everything than I want for whole summer.'' Tony was speechless at the boy's declaration. What kind of person would let a teenager alone in the streets of London?</p>
<p>"Seriously, what kind of man leaves a teenager alone in London?"</p>
<p>"A businessman?"</p>
<p>"I'm a businessman kid." Tony deadpanned.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know who I am?" the young wizard shook his head.</p>
<p>"Should I?" Something that he needed to fixed in his new freedom. The older man sighed, and he looked almost relieved for some reason.</p>
<p>"I'm Tony, Tony Stark." he shook the hand of the raven haired boy.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you! I'm Harry Potter." Harry responded with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Are you hungry?" Tony said after he heard the stomach of the young boy growling. Harry let a blush of embarrassment appear on his cheeks.</p>
<p>"Don't mind if I do." Harry scratched the back of his head when Hedwig let a hoot of an agreement, which surprised the young billionaire.</p>
<p>"Is that an owl?"</p>
<p>'Bloody hell. It is going to be a great pleasure explaining Hedwig to him' Harry thought as Tony stared at the snowy owl with interest.</p>
<p>His summer had started really strange, but he wouldn't complain about it. He would rather be kidnapped by this man than staying with the Dursleys. Harry shook his head; it was a bad thing to think.</p>
<p>''By the way kid, those clothes are actually yours?'' Harry shook his head in denial. He found no point in lying to Tony who was too much absorbed by Hedwig to her amusement and proud.</p>
<p>''You need a makeover.'' Harry tilted his head.</p>
<p>''Makeover?''</p>
<p>''So this is a makeover!''</p>
<p>''Told you that the color green would look good on you and your eyes just make it better. Am I right?'' Tony was proud of his work. They found a nice shop in the area and the last two hours was the best time till now in Harry's first summer without the Dursleys.</p>
<p>The young wizard had decided to spend his money on an entirely new wardrobe, having the satisfaction to wear his own clothes for the first time, but Tony disagreed and decided to pay for everything to the young wizard's discomfort. Harry didn't feel right to let Tony pay for his new clothes, but Tony was quite adamant to waste his money and the young wizard couldn't help but to accept help from another person, although he had never met someone as stubborn as him, maybe expect Hermione.</p>
<p>Tony was happy as well during the trip as he threw away Dudley's cast-me-downs in the first trash can that he found. Fortunately for Harry and Tony, a saleswoman was kind enough to help them to the clothes that would fit him and look good on him. It didn't help that she recognized Tony the moment they entered the store. Harry never had a sense of fashion but even he had to admit that he was looking good. He had opted for a black jacket with green line on the sleeves, a plain dark green shirt, black pants with a white belt and green sneakers.</p>
<p>''Especially with your eyes.'' The saleswoman was proud of her job; she couldn't let that nice young boy wearing those rags around. Satisfied, Harry put four plastic bags filled with fresh clothes on the counter.</p>
<p>''How much for all this?''</p>
<p>''It totals three hundred pounds, but for a cutie like you. I will only charge two hundred, take this as a gift.'' she blinked one of her eyes to Harry's embarrassment and Tony's enthusiasm.</p>
<p>''Thank you for not revealing who I am. I am actually staying low profile here and I want to keep it that way,'' The saleswoman nodded her head in agreement.</p>
<p>''It's alright Mr. Stark; I was not going to let anyone seeing him in those rags in a scandal. It could ruin the reputation of the store. So, anything else I could do for you?'' The black haired man shook his head as he paid the young woman with a large amount of cash.</p>
<p>''You can take the change as you have been a huge help.'' The teenager beamed at the large tip.</p>
<p>''Thank you very much, Miss Steed.''</p>
<p>''The pleasure is all mine Mr. Stark.'' She turned towards Harry. ''You can come here anytime you want cutie.'' She blinks one more time as she kissed Harry's cheek to his embarrassment. Then, she returned to her job, leaving a flushed Harry and a thoroughly amused Tony.</p>
<p>''Nice job Harry. I didn't know that you were this much popular with the ladies.'' Harry stared at the young billionaire puzzled.</p>
<p>''But I didn't do anything.'' Tony nearly face-palmed himself, almost forgetting that he was dealing with a thirteen years old boy. ''What am I going to do with you kid. Did they teach you Sex Ed in your school?'' Harry tilted his head with confusion.</p>
<p>''S-Sex Ed?'' Tony's mouth dropped.</p>
<p>''What the hell they have been teaching you!''</p>
<p>A few hours later</p>
<p>''And that's why you don't have to use it too much'' Tony exclaimed to a stunned Harry, sitting on a bench in a park with a Burger King takeout. During the last hour, Tony, to his immense displeasure and embarrassment, gave the talk to Harry that the young wizard never received. Harry couldn't bring himself to stare at the brown eyes of the foreigner during the entire explanation, something that Tony was very glad about.</p>
<p>''S-So, my body will change like the others?''</p>
<p>''Not exactly, everyone grows in a different manner or at a different rate. It will hit you hard and slowly, you will found yourself thinking about girls, taking a lot of showers, staring girls, growing hair at strange places and staring girls like a creepy stalker. There is also a lot of things related to girls.'' Tony took a bite of his cheeseburger.</p>
<p>''It is official; my life is completely messed up, but thanks anyway Tony.'' 'Do they teach that in Hogwarts anyway?' Harry thought.</p>
<p>''By the way, what do they teach in your school?'' Harry started to panic at the question; he had never expected to stay that long with a muggle. He had enjoyed Tony's company far more than his relatives' but speaking about the Wizarding World was not an option.</p>
<p>''W-Well you know, the basic stuff. History, Chemistry, Math, Biology, Physics? My school is very special'' he said dryly.</p>
<p>''But they don't bother to teach you that kind of thing? Gosh! Sounds like my boarding school.''</p>
<p>''You too?'' Tony shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>''Didn't need to, but my dear old man thought it would be a great opportunity to kick me out of the house. Still, If it was not for him, I probably would have left my bestie by herself,'' Harry raised an eyebrow of curiosity.</p>
<p>''You met your friends at your school, Tony?''</p>
<p>''Like any rich kid. I did not complain. They made all experience acceptable. You would like Hope. I have been best friends with her since we were six. Although, her dad hated my old man and by extension, me.''</p>
<p>''Why?'' Tony snorted.</p>
<p>''My old man was brilliant, but he was not very good at interacting with others. If one of his colleagues had found something that could change the world, he would bully the guy until he agreed to make another copy. Her dad didn't really appreciate it when he found out. To make thing worse, his wife had just died.'' Tony explained.</p>
<p>''That sounds horrible, but he had no reasons to hate you. Hating someone's child is just pathetic.'' Harry bitterly.</p>
<p>''I don't mind really. J-Jarvis taught me that the opinion of others doesn't matter.'' Tony seemed tensed on mentioning his former butler so Harry didn't push it.</p>
<p>''So, what do you plan to do kid?'' Harry hadn't ask himself this question. He could send a letter to the Weasleys. But for some reason, the young wizard didn't want to leave London or his strange muggle acquaintance yet.</p>
<p>''I don't know. This is the first summer without my relatives and I hate to say this but, this is the first time I have eaten a cheeseburger and it's bloody delicious!'' Tony glanced at the younger boy with astonishment as Harry took another bite from his burger.</p>
<p>''Geez kid! What kind of family doesn't let a kid enjoyed a cheeseburger?''</p>
<p>''The worse kind actually. It's not like I've had any choice. By the time my parents had died, someone put me in their house. I don't even know if I've some other living relatives.'' Harry answered bitterly. Why it had never crossed his mind since he started Hogwarts three years ago. If his aunt disliked him so much, then why had they decided to keep him anyway?</p>
<p>''Really? Don't you have some other aunts and uncles that are far nicer? Even Grandparents?'' Harry shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>''I have never asked or heard about any close relatives. My dad was an only child and I never checked his family background. At my mom's side, however, I have heard that we have got a second cousin living in America. My aunt didn't tell me much about it. Why do you ask that Tony?''</p>
<p>''Well, I would feel responsible for leaving a thirteen year old boy without any adult supervision.'' Harry snorted at the mention of adults. Tony had treated him far better than any adult in his life excluding Sirius and Hagrid.</p>
<p>''Most of the adults in my life are pretty useless anyway.'' He muttered sorely, thankfully the tanned foreigner didn't hear it.</p>
<p>''Why about your friends? You have friends right?'' Harry snorted.</p>
<p>''Of course, I'm not that antisocial mate. But, they would probably force me to go back home or have started their vacation. But maybe I could ask one of them to take me in for few days. Then I would search for any living relative.'' He replied with hesitation.</p>
<p>''Good! If you have a problem on your way, there is always a way to fix them. I talk about this through experience.''</p>
<p>''Thanks for everything Tony. I would pay you back but-'' he was stopped when Tony raised his hand.</p>
<p>''It's alright; you don't need to pay me anything. You know, you really made my day.'' Tony said with a sincere smile on his face. This day started horrible but meeting this young brit had made the day happier.</p>
<p>''But you used your money on me. I don't deserve that kind of stuff.'' The smile on Tony's face quickly disappeared as it shaped into a frown at Harry's panic. Did he make a mistake?</p>
<p>''Listen to me carefully Harry Potter. Get this in your nest-hair brain that everything that your uncle, your aunt and every shitty adult in your life have said about you is false. Don't let people get you down for their own satisfactions. You're a nice and caring boy who made me forget the death of Jarvis. I could just swim in my sorrow in alcohol but I didn't do it because of meeting you. I was able to share with you something that I haven't told even to my best friends. Hell, we even created a club for dead parents by accident. And like any club, we have to stand with each other and watch each others back.'' Harry stared at Tony with disbelief written on his face as both of them started to laugh.</p>
<p>''The club thing is actually real?''</p>
<p>''Of course. The name is still in pending but this is a start. Just because we have an age gap of ten years, I'm a C.E.O and you a high schooler why can't be friends? Please tell me we're friends or else it will be just awkward.'' The young wizard didn't even think about it, sure the man seemed to be more than a little eccentric and could probably keep up an entire conversation with Hermione. He did have fun hanging out with Tony and it probably was not for the last time. The Boy Who Lived couldn't explain it but he felt that he had made a deep connection with Tony. It sounded surreal.</p>
<p>''Well, its not everyone who can claim to have a billionaire as a friend,'' Harry said with a tentative smile. Tony's face was filled with joy and happiness as the two new friends continued their conversation as Hedwig flew above their head.</p>
<p>'And I know what you are thinking, what happened after that day, it's a weird story.'</p>
