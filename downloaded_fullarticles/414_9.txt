    <p>“Granger! Wait…"</p><p>Draco’s voice rang across the Great Hall, and every student in the place spun to look at him. He’d risen from the Slytherin table just at the end of dinner, and moved towards the door to head Hermione off before she could leave.</p><p>They were well into their 8th year at Hogwarts, and this sort of intrigue was out of the norm.</p><p>She turned to look at him, an eyebrow raised with skepticism.</p><p>“Yes, Malfoy?”</p><p>He scoffed and looked away from her, clearly annoyed. “Come now, Hermione. I think we’re both ready to drop the act.”</p><p>She looked visibly unsettled at this and glanced around at the onlooking students nervously.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re-”</p><p>“I love you,” he said in a ringing voice that cascaded around the room, bounding off the stone walls for all to hear.</p><p>Hermione’s chest began heaving as she stared back at him, their eyes locked as if they were alone in the room.</p><p>“I can’t do this anymore, I can’t pretend. The truth-” he said, and then stopped to clear his throat, waiting a moment to gather his resolve before continuing. “The truth is that I want to be with you. Only you. Forever.”</p><p>Hermione’s cheeks turned bright red and her chest continued to heave. Draco moved forward and took both of her hands in his, and a few students near them gasped when she did not protest.</p><p>“Marry me, Hermione.”</p><p>The gasps that then rang throughout the hall were in perfect unison. A few students shouted things like “No!” and “What the bloody hell?!” and “Merlin’s pants!”</p><p>When the noise died down, all eyes were on Hermione. The silence was deafening as they awaited her response.</p><p>“Yes,” she said, her voice weak with tears, which then tumbled from her eyes as she leaned in and kissed Draco. They were both grinning from ear to ear, and after a moment of stunned silence, the hall was filled with cheers and applause. It was hesitant at first, but then grew and grew until everyone in the room seemed to be on the same page that this was a good thing.</p><p>When they broke the kiss, Hermione placed her forehead on Draco’s and continued smiling.</p><p>Through gritted teeth, she said, “Tongue, Malfoy, really?”</p><p>He responded in kind. “Just keep smiling, mudblood.”</p><p>She looked up into his eyes. “You are vile,” she said, and then kissed him again, this time taking care to bite on his bottom lip and drawing a bit of blood.<br/> “Fucking bitch,” he grumbled when she released her hold on him.</p><p>A small crowd had gathered around them at this point, and a Creevey cousin took their photo. Just as they had planned.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here before one of us loses our temper.”</p><p>“Do lead the way,” he said, offering her his hand. She grabbed it and pulled him out of the hall, as they both waved to their onlookers as though they were celebrities… which they sort of were.</p><p>They found the first empty classroom and charged in, Hermione quickly warding the door to prevent anyone from coming in or even near.</p><p>“What in the bloody hell was that, Malfoy?! I told you, no tongue in public or I would bite it off!”</p><p>“Well you didn’t make good on that threat today, so how am I supposed to take you seriously from here, Granger?”</p><p>She scoffed loudly. “How was I supposed to bite your tongue off when you’d just publicly proposed to me?!”</p><p>He shrugged. “Not my problem.”</p><p>“Ugh, you are infuriating and I can’t believe I ever agreed to this deal!”</p><p>He bowed. “My Father sends his regards by the way. The money will be in your Gringotts account within the hour. Now you can get on with your insane House Elf Liberation nonsense.”</p><p>“And you can get on with pretending you’re an upstanding member of society who deserves anything other than people’s suspicion and disdain!”</p><p>“That’s my plan, Granger.”</p><p>“Well good!”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>They stared at each other, hatred sizzling in the air between them.</p><p>Then suddenly they were on top of one another. Kissing, biting, ripping, scratching.</p><p>“I only have ten minutes before the Prefect meeting,” she said hurriedly through panting breaths as she unbuttoned his shirt, continuing to kiss him aggressively.</p><p>“I think they’ll understand, since you just got engaged, now shut the fuck up and bend over.”</p><p>She pulled her mouth from his and let out a hearty laugh. “Oh no, I’m riding your cock, it’s my turn to be in charge.”</p><p>He rolled his eyes as he undid his trousers and pulled out his dick, which was already completely hard. “Fine then, but you have to suck me off first.”</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. “You should’ve known I would do that anyway, but not because of your demand. I enjoy it, it helps get me off.”</p><p>“Just get my dick in your mouth already, Granger. Maybe you can even make it to your precious meeting in time,” he said, pushing on her head to force her lower to the ground.</p><p>“You just better hope I don’t make good on my earlier promise,” she said, making a biting motion, her teeth clicking together.</p><p>His eyes went wide. “On second thoughts,” he said, scooping her up and falling back into the chair behind him. He reached up her skirt to confirm that she hadn’t been wearing knickers, and quickly slid himself into her. They both moaned in approval when he was buried in her extremely wet cunt.</p><p>“Ride away, Granger.”</p><p>She grunted in annoyance, but began bucking forward and back, seeking her release. She pressed her face into his neck, panting hard. Then she growled into his ear.</p><p>“I’m going to find you later and suck your cock. With just a little too much teeth.”</p><p>He ripped open her shirt and began sucking and biting everywhere he could reach.</p><p>“I don’t know, Granger, you don’t seem to be making good on your promises lately.”</p><p>“Malfoy, kindly shut the fuck up and stick a finger up my arse, like I said I only have ten minutes.”<br/> .<br/> .<br/> .<br/> .<br/> .<br/> .<br/> Hermione disillusioned herself after Prefect rounds and slipped into the Slytherin common room. It wasn’t her first time there, and she had memorized the steps she’d need to take to get to his dorm. He was one of only four Slytherin boys their age who had returned for a final year, and so they were given more spacious quarters and larger beds.</p><p>She crept up the stairs, casting a cushioning charm on her feet so as not to wake the Slytherin prefects who had surely just returned back from rounds. A silent alohamora gained her access to the room, and she pushed the door open slowly, listening for the sounds of four different snores. Once she had confirmed they were all asleep, she slipped in and headed to his bed. Peeling back the curtains, she climbed carefully onto the foot of the bed, and then cast silencing charms as well as sticking charms to keep the curtains from moving.</p><p>He had fallen asleep on his back, which was great luck for her. She conjured ropes and then cast another charm to have them magically bind him to the bed by both wrists and both ankles. He didn’t stir until the last knot was secure, and she grinned in triumph.</p><p>“Granger! What the fuck?!”</p><p>“Shhh, husband. You don’t want to wake the other boys, do you?” she said in a sweet simper.</p><p>“This is not funny, you fucking bitch. Release me at once.”</p><p>“Release me at once,” she mocked. “Really Malfoy, what century are you from?” As she said this she crawled on top of him and placed a hand on his cock. She felt immediate confirmation of his arousal, as usual. He could talk a good game, and he could protest, but the truth was that he fucking loved it when she pulled these stunts.</p><p>He groaned as she grasped him greedily and then pulled out her wand and vanished his pants.</p><p>“Fuck you,” was all he managed to say.</p><p>Even though it was dark and he could hardly see her, she grinned. “In due course, darling.” She emphasized the last word, now very aware that they were going to need to get used to these terms of endearment while together in public.</p><p>Without further conversation, she bent down and wrapped her wet lips around his cock. She teased him at the head at first and tasted the first drop of pre-cum, letting out a moan of approval. She had never enjoyed the taste of a man before, but she enjoyed him. It was simply a fact that she could not quite reconcile, and so did not think too hard on. Pun intended.</p><p>After getting that first taste and feeling him squirm with impatience, she found that she couldn’t wait much longer and shoved him deep down into the back of her throat. She had already performed the charm to turn off her gag reflex while on her way there, fully intent on what she was going to do.</p><p>He writhed around, pulling on his binds. She knew he wanted to grab her hair and control her movements. If she was honest, she loved it when he did that. Tonight, however, was a punishment, and that had to include some discipline on her part. They just happened to enjoy a lot of the same things, so taking something away from him meant that it was taken from her as well.</p><p>Her tongue pressed along his shaft as she took him deeply in and out. Then she remembered the entire point of this endeavor, and she scraped her teeth along his length as she went.</p><p>She would have silenced him from the beginning, which had been a favorite of hers, but she wanted to hear his reactions this time. After a few passes with light pressure, she pressed down a bit harder. He shuddered immediately, but she could not tell if it was from pain, pleasure, or both. She added her bottom teeth on the next pass and felt him thrash beneath her. She moaned with the pleasure of knowing how uncomfortable she was making him, while at the same time knowing that he was absolutely enjoying her game.</p><p>He always did.</p><p>They both loved being in control as well as being controlled. It was an odd combination, most people tended to gravitate to one or the other, but both Hermione and Draco took pleasure in either.</p><p>Not wishing to actually injure him, she eased up a bit on the teeth and felt the muscles in his thighs lose their tension. She removed him from the back of her throat and began licking him like an ice cream, trailing her tongue lower and lower and licking his balls. He cried out, as he always did, and she went lower, swirling her tongue in all the places a tongue did really belong but was surely welcome.</p><p>She moved back up and placed sloppy kisses all over his shaft before sliding him back into her mouth and shoving him as deep as he could go. She was incredibly wet now, which she discovered as she slid her own hand between her hot wet folds. Her desire to mount him again was strong, but she’d wait for now. She wanted him to come in her throat. Had been thinking about it ever since they’d parted ways earlier. After that, he could get it up again so she could have a final ride before heading back to her dorm.</p><p>She took him much faster now, imagining that his hand was on the back of her head and forcing her down. She took care to continue the pressure from her teeth, knowing that if she did hurt him at all, she could always heal him before the next round. He hadn’t stopped thrashing in protest, but he was giving her many more moans of approval. Her memory of his hand guiding her head was so strong that she rather though he must be having a similar if not greater experience of this with her in charge. She remembered how he would sometimes hold her down as he bucked his hips up into her, and so she made a very distinct move to bring her lips down to the base of his cock and stop moving.</p><p>He took her cue immediately and began fucking her mouth with what little mobility he had. She had been teasing her own clit gently all this time, but pressed harder now that she could put more focus on herself. Merlin, but this was incredibly arousing. She let him drive into her mouth, pressing most of her body weight down onto him via her lips, as she stroked and rubbed her clit, grinding into her own hand. Finally, without warming, she felt the hot stream of his seed hit the back of her throat. Thank the sex charm Gods, she did not gag for a moment, but willingly accepted it into her throat like a desert walker desperate for water.</p><p>The sensation of the hot liquid spewing into her sent her over the edge. She came hard on her own hand right along with him. Her orgasm was so strong that her ears began ringing. She thought she could hear him murmuring something, but really wasn’t sure. She also didn’t care.</p><p>Wiping her hand on the bedding, she braced herself with both hands and pulled him slowly out of her mouth, again taking care to graze her teeth along his shaft. He shuddered violently at the movement and after a few swallows to rid her mouth of his seed, she giggled.</p><p>“Serves you right, Malfoy. Next time just listen to me.”</p><p>He was panting rather heavily in the aftermath of his orgasm, but she was able to make out, “healing charm… please.”</p><p>Oh dear, he never said please. She reached quickly for her wand and aimed it at his still slightly erect manhood, casting the necessary charm. He let out a satisfied moan.</p><p>She may have healed him, but she wouldn’t apologize. It was still, after all, a punishment.</p><p>Likewise, he did not say thank you. They rarely exchanged a pleasantry in any of their interactions, it just was not their style.</p><p>She bent down and began to kiss and lick his cock once more.</p><p>“I’m fine,” he said with disdain. She looked up at him with a smirk. Her eyes had adjusted to the darkness and she knew that he could see her face clearly by the green lake light that bounced off the ceiling over his four poster.</p><p>“I’m not concerned with your comfort, just that I get one last ride before going off to bed,” she said, and bent down again to continue her efforts to get him fully hard again.</p><p>“You know all you have to do is say that thing you always refuse to say. Could save you a lot of time.”</p><p>She looked up at him, exasperated. This was his constant refrain, though he was usually not bound when he said it. Finding that she was more amenable to it given his current state, she crawled up and kissed his chest, then his collarbone, neck, jaw, and the bit his earlobe. Bringing her lips to the perfect position, she whispered, “fuck me like one of your pureblood whores, please Malfoy.”</p><p>That seemed to do the trick, as she felt his cock twitch against her stomach instantly.</p><p>“Told you,” he said in a pompous manner. Merlin, how he could manage to speak so clearly when so aroused, she’d never know. She was certainly ready herself. In fact, she hoped for at least two more orgasms before she left his bed. Straddling him, she lowered herself onto his cock for the second time that day, and relished the sensation of having full control to fuck him as hard, soft, fast, or slow as she desired.<br/> .<br/> .<br/> .<br/> .<br/> .<br/> .<br/> The next morning found them both sleeping in their own beds, and going about their days without much thought of where the other was or what they were doing.</p><p>Their days were always like this. While the pair had found a mutual satisfaction in the act of fucking one another, when it came to feelings, neither was willing to let their guard down enough to care.</p><p>It was kind of funny, really. If one of them would simply show a weakness first, the other would actually be supportive of it… but they would never know that. Because they were assholes.</p>
