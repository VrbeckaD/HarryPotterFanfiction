    <p>Chapter One</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>DISCLAIMER : I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CHARACTERS, THEY RESPECTIVELY BELONG TO RICK RIORDAN AND JK ROWLING</p><p>(A/N: my descriptions are slightly different from the media, bare with me)</p><p>Nico's Pov</p><p> </p><p>"Come on Neeks, let's go and cheer on Percy, with the rest of camp." Thalia shouted. </p><p>"What for?" I questioned. I didn't recall him doing any quests recently.</p><p>"I don't know, for being a good person." she shrugged.</p><p>"Okay," I shouted back "I'm on my way." I lied through my teeth. I couldn't do it anymore. I was going to leave camp for good.</p><p>Thalia ran back to the camp fire, where they were currently cheering for Percy.</p><p>I shadow travelled back to my cabin and started to pack as quietly as I could. It was hard because I keep the curtains shut...I am the son of Hades after all. </p><p>I needed a place to stay. Maybe, I should go and see my old friend Albus. He and I go way back. I knew him back when I was in my early twenties, I am about 88, stuck in an 18 year olds body.</p><p>He came to the Lotus Casino and we laughed like drunks together when we ate the Lotus flowers. He left that weekend, claiming he had some business to attend to. He told me to visit whenever I wanted, so why not?</p><p>Necromancy or Umbrakinesis wasn't even or energy draining anymore. Every time something bad or tragic happened in my life, I started to show less emotions, everytime I would train harder with my sword and I would strengthen my powers. </p><p>My life has become so devestatingly sad that I am now emotionless and in someways, cruel.</p><p>I gathered the shadows around me, 88 years I have lived and I can never get used to the fact that my physical form in 18. </p><p>Anyways, I zoned out, looking for one soul in particular. Albus Dumbledore, a tag with his name on it was visible in my mind.<br/>
There his is, I shadow travelled myself to the spot exactly behind him.</p><p>I wanted to scare him and I think I had finally done it until he let out a hearty laugh. It was a kind one, it made me feel welcome. I smiled inside, but as I said, I never let my emotions show anymore.</p><p>"Welcome, my old friend." Albus exclaimed.</p><p>"It's good to see you again." I whispered.</p><p>I looked around, I never really thought of where a person may be when I shadow travelled up on them.<br/>
I shuddered, imagine if I shadow travelled on Al while he was taking a dump. Gross.</p><p>Back to business. I was standing in a circular room, on one side it had portraits in motion and on the other, a cabinet with a bowl and small crystal vials on a rack. The desk was near the end opposite a door. Al was sitting in a chair, with me standing behind him.</p><p>"Al, please help me, I'm in need of a place to stay, I will repay you by giving you a favour, I will do it no matter what."</p><p>Al smiled and his blue eyes twinkled. "Of course, I know a great family that can take you in."</p><p>"Really ?!" I actually smiled, for the first time in years. Then my smile dropped, remembering this crucial question. "Do they have kids?".</p><p>Al removed his clasped hands from on top of the desk and held then under the table.<br/>
"No." his eyes twinkled in mischief.</p><p>"Okay." I said unconvinced.</p><p>"Can you take me there please ?"</p><p>"Of course, it would be like old times."<br/>
