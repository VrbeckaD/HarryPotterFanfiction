  <em>“Do you remember, Harry Potter? Do you know where you come from? Where you are going?”</em>
</p><p>Harry is a freak. That’s nothing new. He strives for normality and it flees from him like scurrying clouds running endlessly across the sky.</p><p>A fan whirls around in the humid room. A note pinned to the wall flutters in the breeze everytime it passes. The air is listless otherwise, with droopy eyes and languid limbs enwrapped around him. The fan spins and the notice curls up once more.</p><p>He picks at a scab over one elbow. He can’t remember what it was from. His nail catches the flap of skin and slides over it. It’s soothing.</p><p>The poster flutters. <em>Mutant re-education </em>it reads as it breathes in time with the whirring fan. A different word for the same thing. Mutant. Freak. <em>Magic </em>.</p><p>Except magic didn’t exist in this reality. Just Harry and his scrawny underfed teenage body, scabs from old scars healing over his elbow and glasses hanging lopsided off his face.</p><p>“Mr Potter?”</p><p>The fan spins. The poster whirls. She stands in the doorway, still dressed in baby pinks as if she thinks it’s cute. As if she’s a little girl with soft features and wide eyes, staring innocently at the world. Dolores Umbridge is anything but innocent.</p><p>With a face that looks like she ran into a wall, she simpers at him. Tone a pitch too high, she clears her throat and holds her door open like condemnation. “It’s wonderful to meet you, Mr Potter. I trust we’ll be getting to know each other during our meetings. I hear you’ve been a very naughty boy.”</p><p>He’s fourteen not five. He’s not an idiot. Even if he didn’t dream of a castle and magic and a Dark Lord trying to kill him he would think her stupid. That’s all she is really; a pandering pink-clad fool. His hand clenches for a wand that isn’t there and he settles for curling into the seat and trying to make himself as small as possible. He rubs at the back of his hand.</p><p>It’s unscarred. He can’t remember what’s meant to be there, only that something is.</p><p>A naughty boy. She sounds like Vernon and Petunia. She calls him ‘Mr Potter’ instead of ‘Boy’ or ‘Freak’ or ‘Mutant’ but the amount of disgust and derision shoved into the name is the same. Her words are patronising and condescending and revulsion crawls it’s way up his throat. He picks a new scar into the back of his left hand.</p><p>The office is dressed in pink too. He twists to look for the cat pictures he knows are there. They’re eerily still, frozen mid mew. He waits a heartbeat for something to happen.</p><p>Nothing does.</p><p>“Oh dear,” she says, as she finishes going through his files, “What are we going to do with you, Mr Potter?”</p><p>“Do you believe in magic?” he asks her, a question for a question and he waits for the recognition, for the ghost of the awful woman he had known to make an appearance...</p><p>But all she does is laugh, clasping her hands in front of her on the desk, “Do you think you’re some sort of witch, Potter? This isn’t fairytale,” she breaks it to him almost gently, almost kindly if it wasn’t for the way her voice twists into a laugh as sweet as sugar-coated lemon rind. “You’re not a wizard, you’re a filthy mutant. And I’m here to make you better.”</p><p>Make you better, she tells him, as if he’s <em>ill </em>. As if there’s a <em>cure </em>.</p><p>(“Just like my filthy sister,” Petunia had sneered at him, “And that boy of hers with his smoke and tricks. A <em>freak </em>.”)</p><p>Petunia hated him because he has magic. Petunia hated him because he is a mutant. Worlds blur and shift and Umbridge smiles down at him and it’s not a <em>nice </em>smile. He recognises it, it’s the same smile she gave him with the quill, the same when she had been about to curse him and he’s never met her before but he knows what she’s going to do before she does it.</p><p>It’s like a spot the difference taken to the extreme. Overlapping images that are totally different except for a few fixed points. Human brains aren’t meant to comprehend entire lifetimes shoved on top of each other like a jenga tower filled with holes all ready to come tumbling down.</p><p>“We’ll try this for a few days,” she says, “See how you feel then after no food or voice. You understand this is for your own good, right?”</p><p>The mask is metal. Electricity hums under the surface. It leaves his nose free, covers his mouth. It looks like some sort of archaic torture device. Or some odd bondage gear. It chokes his words and tongue. Hunger is a dead bone in his stomach being gnawed raw. Not unusual; Vernon and Petunia don’t like him enough in either world.</p><p>Dead parents, he sees in his file as Umbridge slams it closed. Car crash or dark wizard, he wonders, he’ll probably never know. Dead, always dead, a kaleidoscopic mirror and everything’s the same same same except this.</p><p>Cold metal wrapped around his jaw and extinguishing his words, his tongue, his voice. It <em>hurts </em>, wraps around something inside him and chokes it out of existence.</p><p>*</p><p><em>Dying is easy </em>, Sirius tells him, and he’s right. It’s the easiest thing Harry has ever done. Had he known it would be this easier he would have stop fighting <em>years </em>ago.</p><p>And then? Then he comes back.</p><p>Maybe it’s all his fault. He distinctly remembers thinking <em>this could have turned out so much better </em>in between all the fighting and dying. Was it him with the resurrection stone pressing imprints into his flesh, a cloak around his neck and a wand of elder in his hand?</p><p>He can’t remember.</p><p>Ron’s hair windswept and illuminated by spellfire. The whirl of Hermione’s robes on Hogwarts’ stairs. A flash of a sword in Neville’s hands. Ruby red eyes in a serpentine’s face and genuine fear in Voldemort’s face.</p><p>The events are there, but not in order. Harry was dead and then he wasn’t. There was a battle and then there wasn’t.</p><p>There was magic, <em>so much magic </em>Harry had thought he would drown in it, and then there wasn’t, just a power settling at the base of his spine and half-forgotten dreams drifting off with the wind.</p><p>*</p><p>They take the mask off after a week. They put something in his food afterwards that makes the whole world seem hazy. Like he’s trying to watch a 3D movie without the glasses, everything is just slightly off. Images overlap, memories roll in his head and reality shifts.</p><p>“Do you remember?” a girl in the cafeteria asks. She watches him choke down food like he’s afraid it will be taken away from him once more. “Do you <em>see </em>?”</p><p>“Shut up,” one of the guards snaps at them.</p><p>She remains staring at him with wide blue blue periwinkle eyes. Her long blonde hair is drab and dull. He stares at her, “It’s not real, Lovegood,” he whispers back.</p><p>“Isn’t it?” she asks with just a hint of a challenge, a little less question and little more gauntlet being thrown into the ring. The polished metal reflects his surroundings and he sees spellfire and a shining tiara and a castle <em>burning </em>. “Do you dream, Harry Potter?” she asks, in that tone that is just quintessential  <em> Luna </em>it makes a part of his heart ache.</p><p>He’s never met this girl.</p><p>“Don’t hang out with him, Lovegood,” one of the other children hisses as they walk past, “He’s a<em>murderer </em>.”</p><p>“Nah, let them hang out together, she’s crazy anyway.”</p><p>“Do I know you?” he asks her.</p><p>She tilts her head, smile content. She reminds him of Alice, in her own personal wonderland, long blonde hair trailing down her back washed out like limp seaweed. It drapes over her thing bony shoulders like those of death’s horses. “I don’t know. Do you?”</p><p>Her eyes are like chips of sky shattered into a human body and they see much too <em>far </em>too--</p><p>It hurts.</p><p>“Yes,” he says, and pushes his tray away. He’s not hungry anymore, and his head hurts. He rubs at a scar that isn’t there and his thoughts feel muffled. He walks away, leaving her sitting there looking so small and frail and aged twelve not sixteen but he sees her thin form in a dungeon cold and alone and--</p><p>His head hurts.</p><p><em>“Do you remember, Harry Potter </em>?”</p><p>Of course he remembers, he thinks as his worlds fold together; imperfect silhouettes until he can’t hope to work out what he’s seeing.</p><p>Of course he remembers.</p><p>That’s the problem.</p><p>*</p><p>Luna’s soft and comforting. His only friend in the place and she looks at him with total and complete understanding, like she can see into his soul.</p><p>Maybe she can; he doesn’t ask her mutation. She’d always been able to see far more than normal people anyway.</p><p>One of the boys complains about him and the mask goes back on. When it comes off after three days he’s shaking; he can’t stop his hands from trembling. Whatever they put in his food they up the dose. Everything feels flat; like paper cutouts.</p><p>Maybe this is the world that’s not real, he thinks, as he curls up next to Luna who is making a necklace of leftover pencil stubs. “Do you think the others are okay?” she asks.</p><p>“They’re dead,” he says.</p><p>“So were you,” she says, “Are you dead, Harry Potter?”</p><p>
  <em>Who are you, Harry Potter?</em>
</p><p>“Luna, they’re not <em>here </em>,” he says, harshly, “They’re not… <em>they’re gone </em>. Don’t-don’t <em>confuse </em>this world and that, they’re <em>not the same </em>.”</p><p>“It is when it counts,” she insists.</p><p>“Then they’re dead,” he snaps, words cruel and an icy snow blizzards slamming into her slight form. She shivers just a little but persists.</p><p>“They’re not,” she insists, “Not here, Harry, please listen to me--” she holds out the drawings, and they’re all of that wrong time wrong <em>world </em>. Hermione in the Gryffindor Common Room, Ron at the Burrow in dress robes at the wedding and Ginny in her Quidditch Uniform. There are little chain links drawn around their names, small triangles and--</p><p>A hand shoots out and snatches the pictures up. “And what…” Umbridge’s words are thin ice already cracking, “What are these? Miss Lovegood; are you not aware that using your powers could result in severe…” she almost savours the word, <em>“Consequences </em>.”</p><p>Luna stares, twelve and a little girl, and Harry always has to play the hero. “No,” he straightens, “No, it wasn’t her, it was me, I <em>made </em>her--”</p><p>For a moment her attention wavers. He thinks she’s going to take Luna away anyway, but she falls for the bait. She’d never been able to resist attacking him, smearing his name through the muck and the dirt. “I’m very disappointed in you - we had been making such progress.”</p><p>He doesn’t say anything, presses his lips together in a thin line and waits for the detention.</p><p>“Come with me,” she instructs, “I think it’s probably about time you realise the true severity of your actions and what they could mean for you. If we can’t train this awful nonsense out of you--” she leaves the threat hanging like a noose in the air. With every step Harry takes he feels it tighten a little more.</p><p>He glances back once; sees Luna sitting there alone, and then Umbridge is grabbing onto his arm to speed him up.</p><p>She drags him into what isn’t her office, there’s no way, it’s not pink enough. She drops him in a heap on the floor. There’s someone else in the room who pauses what he’s doing, “Get back to work,” she snaps at him, “I’ve brought you company.”</p><p>The boy is about the same age as him with dark hair. He’s sitting in the corner of the room, pen in hand racing across the paper. His head is ducked, but there’s something not cowed about the way he sits. It’s respectful, but borderlining on being patronising. Like a mockery of obedience, biding its time.</p><p>Umbridge turns to him with a sinister smile plastered pleasingly across her face, “Ignore him. I’ve got a little project for you, you’ll just love it. I’ve got these for you to sort out. Just sit there, that’s it, good boy...” she talks to him like a pet, as she watches him sit on the floor amongst piles of paperwork. He doesn’t see how this is a punishment. Not initially. It’s just paperwork--</p><p>It’s not paperwork. It’s records. Records of mutants.</p><p>The ones that had already passed through the facility. The ones that were no longer here because they were…</p><p>They were…</p><p>“They all got what was coming to them. Think of it as a warning, Mr Potter. You can’t win.”</p><p>The words he reads rattle around his head. The red stamps on the files seem awfully final. Dead dead<em>dead--</em></p><p><em>I must not tell lies, </em>he thinks, and he doesn’t know where the words come from for a moment.</p><p>“I always knew it was my duty to help purify the population of mutants. They ruined my family, killed my father and tried to kill me when I was little… it was only natural to choose it as a career path.”</p><p>Harry drops the folder into a pile. Picks up the next one. Sees the words swim, feels helplessness well up and her voice grates over him...</p><p>
  <em>I must not tell lies.</em>
</p><p>Her voice catches on something, words like cracking glass.</p><p>“They’re so close to a cure, and soon you will be freed from the crimes of your filthy species…”</p><p>The cracks spread fine hairline fractures--</p><p>
  <em>I must not tell lies.</em>
</p><p>The folder slips from his hand as he stands.</p><p>“Mr Potter, what are you doing? Get back to work, there’s an awful lot to sort through--”</p><p>Warm power curls at the base of his spine, crawling up it with creeping tendrils like reaching ivy. It feels a bit like magic, almost. <em>It’s the same where it counts </em>, Luna whispers in his head, and she’s right, of course.</p><p>Magic is gone but he is still <em>gifted </em>, he is still <em>special </em>. And he can <em>use that </em>.</p><p>“<em> Don’t lie </em>,” it slips out, voice like dry ice. “ <em>Tell the truth. </em>” His power like sharp spice coats his tongue. His temper had always been a terrifying thing; not even Ron or Hermione dared argue half the time. In the corner her assistant just freezes. Umbridge bristles indignantly, face going steadily red with anger and the words…</p><p>The words just <em>pour </em>out. “Why? You want to know that my father was a filthy mutant? That my mother was well rid of him when she left him with my brother and I? That he dared to pass on his filthy genetics to me? But I’m good. I don’t use my freak abilities and if I can learn how not to use then, then you, Mr Potter, can do the same--”</p><p>There is click as her jaw snaps shut. Her eyes are wide and bulging out of her toad-like face. Harry stumbles backwards, realisation creeping over him.</p><p>“You <em>dare </em>,” she says, taking control of her own voice from him, “You filthy mutant <em>freak </em>, you <em>dare </em>use your abhorrence on me <em>? </em>”</p><p>It’s like the <em>Imperius </em>he thinks with horror, he completely takes away their will. He takes another slow step backwards, because she’ll punish him now. He’ll be in the cupboard for <em>days </em>--</p><p>Wrong world <em>wrong world </em>he thinks, and dreams blur into reality.</p><p>“I will make you regret it,” Umbridge says, slowly and carefully rolling up her sleeves, “And if we have to use… <em>extreme </em>measures, then so be it. What the authorities aren’t aware of…”</p><p>The look in her eyes is gleeful. It’s the same look he had seen as she prepared to cast the cruciatus curse and whatever she has planned will not be nice. It will be the mask again, he thinks with horror, the mask or the cruciatus or--</p><p><em>No </em>.</p><p>“You’re ill,” she says, sickly sweet, “Sick, but it’s okay. They’re working on a cure but for now? I can make you better, can’t you see I’m just trying to help--”</p><p>The images of Umbridge as a Professor and here as a Re-Educator blur and overlap and it’s different, but it’s the <em>same </em>and like a dragon that has been sleeping in the undergrounds of Gringotts his anger opens one feral golden eye.</p><p>“Didn’t anyone,” the words claw their way out of his throat, the dragon tearing out from between his ribs to lie like some bleeding creature on the ground, “Didn’t anyone ever tell you that you must not tell lies?”</p><p>Her eyes narrow, and she reaches out. Harry grasps for a wand that isn’t there, he’s defenceless except…</p><p>No. No, he’s never going to be defenceless again.</p><p>“This won’t hurt,” she’s saying, having scooped up that thrice cursed mask that binds his tongue.</p><p>“<em> Don’t lie </em>, <em>don’t move, shut up </em>,” he says, feeling the power in his words. It’s bittersweet; dark chocolate on his tongue, “ <em>Pick up that pencil.”</em></p><p>He watches her throat bulge. Her fingers twitch. She tries to fight but Harry’s will is stronger. An almost glaze covers her eyes as she reaches for a mechanical pencil on the desk.</p><p>“<em> Now you’re going to write,” </em>he says, vindictively, <em>“I must not tell lies </em>.”</p><p>She reaches for the desk and paper and a laugh that is war torn and scarred echos in the room.</p><p>“Why waste paper?” he asks, “<em> Write it on your skin. And don’t stop until it sinks in </em>.”</p><p>It’s a thrill. A heady, rush, like flying except he hasn’t left the ground. The power coils and purrs in him, and Dolores Umbridge takes the pencil and starts to write. The thin lead of the mechanical pencil snaps quickly. Soon she’s digging metal against her skin. Over and over and over and--</p><p>It isn’t long before it begins to bleed.</p><p>"<em> Keep carving it, </em>" he instructs, dispassionately. He’s watching events play out like a movie, watching Umbridge get her due. After all, this isn’t real. This world is nothing but paper cutouts and he deserves this, at least, to rip her silhouette into shreds. "I don't think the message has sunk in quite yet."</p><p>Movement and Harry whirls around, but it’s only Umbridge’s assistant, the teenage boy, standing up. Harry had forgotten about him, and he opens his mouth to make the other forget, keep his mouth shut, he’s not sure, he gets distracted by the way the boy is gazing with <em>glee </em>at Umbridge’s quivering form. “That was truly beautiful. I didn’t think you had it in you, Potter.”</p><p>The world snaps into focus in a way it hasn’t before. It’s as if everything had been out of focus before. It’s with almost condemnation and resignation that he looks up to meet the dark satisfied gaze of Tom Riddle.</p><p><em>This is real </em>, he realises with a sudden, mind-numbing horror.</p>
