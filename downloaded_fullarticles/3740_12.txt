    <p>Newt was nice. He said Credence could visit his creatures whenever he wants. Newt <em> trusted </em>him.</p>
<p>Credence would die before he betrayed that trust.</p>
<p>He would tug at Newt’s (soft, pretty) jacket, pointing towards his case.</p>
<p>“Of course, darling, you don’t have to <em> ask. </em>”</p>
<p>But Credence always did. Until, well.</p>
<p>Credence bit down a gasp when he awoke. He didn’t want to wake up Newt or Graves, who were nestled on either side of him.</p>
<p>Credence’s head was pounding - he remembered scraps of his dream: Newt’s thick forearms as he bathed the mooncalves, the line of Graves' neck, held taught and inviting, the warmth of their bodies on either side of his -</p>
<p>Credence whimpered. He was <em> throbbing </em>. He bit his hand, tears springing to his eyes as he drew blood.</p>
<p>It didn’t work.</p>
<p>He pressed the heel of his palm to his stomach (never <em> there </em>, that only made it worse made him wanna rock up into his hand made him wanna) and squeezed his eyes shut.</p>
<p>Still so hot.</p>
<p>Newt hummed something in his sleep, turning over. Credence froze. His eyes flickered to Newt’s suitcase.</p>
<p>Well. Maybe he didn’t have to <em> ask, </em>just this once.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It was hard to climb down into the case when...Credence blushed. He staggered to the chill of Newt’s arctic biome, his teeth beginning to chatter and his fingers beginning to creak.</p>
<p>It was alright. He deserved it.</p>
<p>The Polar Largos were fast asleep, huddled up together and trilling. Credence was glad for that, at least: they didn’t have to see his shame.</p>
<p>By now, his erection had mostly subsided, but that was no excuse. Wickedness was in his blood, now, and he had to kill it at the source.</p>
<p>Credence took a deep breath, and sank, waist deep, into the icy water. He shrieked once before locking his jaw, a long practiced trick.</p>
<p><em> Thirty minutes. </em> His mother’s voice said. <em> Absolve yourself of this, at least. Filthy child. </em></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Newt felt mumbling by his ear, the warm nest of blankets he made for the three of them, the thick line of Graves' erection pressed against his ass -</p>
<p>“Good morning, Percy!” He said, brightly. Graves moaned in his ear, blinking blearily.</p>
<p>“Too loud…” He muttered. “...Credence?”</p>
<p>Newt turned to face Graves, wrapping his arms around Graves' neck as he thought.</p>
<p>“Maybe he got hungry. Maybe…”</p>
<p>Newt spied the case, open and expelling cold air.</p>
<p>“Hm. His visiting the Polar creatures.”</p>
<p>“This early?”</p>
<p>“He likes them! They’re fantastic, truly, they warm up their saliva to near boiling temperatures to melt the ice-”</p>
<p>But Graves' was asleep, snoring on Newt’s shoulder, still half heartedly grinding against Newt’s crotch.</p>
<p>“-oh. Well, Credence would be interested!”</p>
<p>Newt grabbed his coat, cast a few warming charms, and went down to meet him.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Credence shouldn’t complain. He really shouldn’t. But it <em> was </em> getting very hard to feel his toes, his fingers, grabbing at the snow. Maybe...maybe he could just have 15 minutes? Newt said he was being <em> so good </em> the past few days, and-and Graves wasn't ever <em> mad </em> at him and he <em> was </em>trying his best -</p>
<p>
  <em> Sloth. Laziness. Disgusting. </em>
</p>
<p>Credence flinched, looking down at his watery reflection. The water was so clear, he could see his blue toes. At least the bulge in his undergarments was gone, at least he was clean -</p>
<p>“Good morning, Credence!” Newt sang. “Practicing heating charms?”</p>
<p>“N-no, um, sh-should I?”</p>
<p>“Oh, not at all! I was just wondering-”</p>
<p>Newt stopped. He stared at Credence’s thin shirt and worn pants, how he shivered under the freezing water.</p>
<p>“Oh, <em> darling. </em>Come now, Mummy’s got you.” He knelt by Credence, pulling him out of the water. Credence trembled, certain punishment was coming. “Mummy’s got you. Out we go.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Graves nuzzled into the warmth of Newt’s pillow. He had no idea how that man could always smell so damn good. He hung around with beasts, for Christ’s sake, yet only ever smelled of hay and fresh fields-</p>
<p>The ladder creaked dangerously from Newt’s case.</p>
<p>“<em> Percy! A little help!” </em></p>
<p>Graves bolted upright, rolling out of bed. He ducked into the case.</p>
<p>“Newt? What happened to Credence-?”</p>
<p>Credence was hidden in Newt’s shoulder, shivering fiercely. Newt shook his head, jaw tight.</p>
<p>“He needs a hot bath. <em> Now.” </em></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>After several warming charms and an extension charm, Graves lowered himself and Credence into the tub. Newt had his sleeves rolled up, casting spells for the steam and pouring warm water over Credence’s hair.</p>
<p>“Close your eyes, there’s a good boy…”</p>
<p>Credence whimpered, feet and hands stinging, numb from the quick change in temperature. Graves squeezed him against his chest. Thank god they were both still dressed. Credence would surely die of embarrassment if subjected to <em> that. </em></p>
<p>“Credence, darling, what were you doing down there?”</p>
<p>Credence curled in on himself, shaking and squeezing his eyes shut.</p>
<p>“I’m not mad, of course - I’m quite pleased you’re taking an interest in these amazing creatures - but what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“I…” Lying was a sin. “It hurt when I got up. I felt hot. I just...wanted to feel better.” Credence’s cheeks were bright red. Newt was quite confused.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you take a bath, baby?”</p>
<p>
  <em> -Mary Lou shoving him under the freezing water, her sharp nails digging into his broken skin- </em>
</p>
<p>“I didn't know if I was allowed.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my boy.” Graves sighed into his hair. “You can do whatever you’d like. I could have sworn I cast a cooling charm on that blasted room - I suppose it <em> is </em>a bit hot for three people…”</p>
<p>“Where are you hurt, darling? Let mummy make it better.”</p>
<p>Oh, that wasn’t <em> fair. </em>It wasn’t fair how sweet Newt’s eyes were, how he spoke so gently. He was feeding that beast inside him, patting its’ head and tucking him in. Credence’s poor, abused cock twitched.</p>
<p>“U-um, here.” He put his hand on his stomach. Newt followed suit, water splashing around his sleeves. Newt’s rough hands felt so nice against his fevered skin…</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>“Mmhmm.” Credence tried to nod, gasping.</p>
<p>“Oh. Oh, <em> Credence </em>.” Graves said, light dawning in his eyes. “Sweet boy. Answer me honestly, now.”</p>
<p>Oh no, no, no, Graves couldn't touch him <em> there </em> he’d know what a bad boy Credence was no it felt so <em> good- </em></p>
<p>“Here, baby?”</p>
<p>Credence nodded, biting his lip. Graves massaged at his crotch, shooting Newt a glance.</p>
<p>“Oh, darling, that’s perfectly natural.” Newt knelt by the tub, cooing and kissing. “I’ll explain. For now, um. Does it feel okay?”</p>
<p>“I can’t - it’s <em> bad. </em>”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not, sweet thing.” Graves stifled a groan, growing quite interested under Credence’s ass. He took the boy’s hips in hand, grinding him onto his crotch. “See?” He groaned. “Perfectly-<em> nng </em>-normal…”</p>
<p>Credence moaned, grabbing for Newt’s shoulders and panting into his mouth. Newt’s hands wandered back into the water, rubbing up Credence’s shaking thighs and up to the laces of his pants.</p>
<p>“N-no…” Credence squirmed, looking at Newt like he was absolution.</p>
<p>“It’ll feel much better, sweet thing. Promise. Don’t you trust mummy?”</p>
<p>“Uh-!” Credence hips jerked to meet Newt’s hand, his cock finally free. Graves' reached around to cup his balls, sighing at how <em> full </em> and <em> needy </em>his poor boy was.</p>
<p>Newt was very pleasantly surprised at the <em> length </em>of his boy, thick and heavy in his hand.</p>
<p>“Percy, feel...my, what a big boy we have.” Newt purred. That went straight to both Graves and Credence’s crotches. It was unfair how <em> sexy </em> the awkward man could be at times.</p>
<p>Credence moaned, thrusting his hips up. His cockhesd peeked out of the water, flushed and wanting. It would be a crime to ignore such a pretty thing, so Newt bent down for a kiss.</p>
<p>Credence <em> squealed </em>, begging for something he couldn’t name.</p>
<p>“Can I - <em> please please please- </em>”</p>
<p>“Don’t tease the poor boy…” Graves reached for some product Queenie had given Credence, one Graves shamelessly used to slip a finger inside Newt when they were in the shower together. Newt’s eyes sparkled, and he pressed his boyish grin into Credence’s hair.</p>
<p>“Thank you, darling.” Newt coated his hands in the stuff, then reached down for Credence’s cock, pumping him with sure, even strokes, rubbing a thumb on the side of his head.</p>
<p>Credence fell apart, his head falling back into Graves' shoulder. Graves guided the Credence’s shaking hands to his balls, showing him how to knead his aching flesh. With Credence preoccupied with playing, Graves let his own erection free, slipping it between Credence’s thighs. He thrust into that tight, slippery heat, moaning and reaching up to play with Credence’s nipples.</p>
<p>“Baby? How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“-<em> mm-” </em></p>
<p>“Let it out. Come on…”</p>
<p>Newt began jacking him cruelly, water splashing over the side of the tub. He held Credence down with his other hand, well practiced in wrangling and holding and <em> keeping. </em> Credence wailed, hands flying to the edge of the tub.</p>
<p>Graves came with a long snarl into Credence’s shoulders, driven over the edge by Newt’s dominance.</p>
<p>“Let <em> go, </em>baby.”</p>
<p>“P-please!”</p>
<p>“Please-?”</p>
<p>“M-more, more-!” Newt pressed his thumbnail to Credence’s slit, kissing his temple. “<em> Ma-” </em></p>
<p>Credence’s stomach clenched as he came, clouding the bath water with long ropes of cum. Newt blinked, fascinated at the quantity of semen.</p>
<p>Credence gasped for breath, his fragile rib cage heaving as Graves stroked his chest and sides.</p>
<p>“Good boy. <em> My </em>good boy.” Newt pressed his forehead to Credence’s sweaty brow. “Feel better?”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>
<p>“Next time you feel hard, you come to mummy, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes…” Credence sighed, rolling over to nuzzle into Graves chest. Graves chuckled, low and sated.</p>
<p>“You want to go back to bed, darling?”</p>
<p>“Mmhm.”</p>
