    <p><b>                                                                        JUNE 4th</b> <b> </b> <b>19</b><b>90, </b> <b>OUTSKIRTS OF</b> <b> CUIDAD VALLES,</b> <b> </b> <b>MEXICO </b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Gracias... gracias… gracias…” The boy gratefully repeats bleeding beneath a canopy of exotic flowers and tall trees.</p><p> </p><p>The being receiving his thanks, standing impossibly massive yet completely within visibility from any distance, a formless darkness surrounding speckles of light and skeletal hands. Upon closer inspection the hands seemed to be serpents and the lights eyes, yet if one were to take another look perhaps they’d find the former lights more akin to the cosmos framed by an infinite space and the serpents now long veils of flowing beautiful light, or maybe they’d see something else entirely.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you thank me for, boy? You are dying a meaningless death after living an equally meaningless and a far more wretched life.” the creature speaks without voice yet the boy hears it more clearly than even his own thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“porque estás aquí, porque eres el único que estaría aquí.” The boy says mustering a large genuine grin.</p><p>&lt;because you are here, because you are the only one who would be here.&gt;</p><p>“y por eso te agradezco!” He finishes with blood leaking from his smiling lips.</p><p>&lt;and that's why I thank you!&gt;</p><p> </p><p>“What a foolish boy!” The entity’s thought responds amused. “You presume to know <em>me?!”</em></p><p> </p><p>“&lt;I am very foolish, but even if you are not who I thought, would you please stay with me only a little longer.&gt;” The boy whispers.</p><p> </p><p>“That is quite the request of a perfect stranger” The thought is haughty not malicious. “though, I would not turn away from you, in these your final breaths. However child, would you not like to continue living?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, and your offer is kind and more than I deserve but I just can’t live this life any more.” The boy thinks losing all his strength to speak.</p><p> </p><p>“I believe you’ve misunderstood my offer, you would not live as who or even what you once were but as <em><b>my</b></em>  paladin. You see, I am in need of unique assistance, however it does not need to be you specifically, boy. As such you are free to deny and I will still see you off. Although, I have taken a liking to you.” The thought is friendly and welcoming.</p><p> </p><p>“Then yes, and with all my heart I will repay you for your kindness.” He replies from the very core of his being.</p><p> </p><p>“Now I christen you, reborn in my name and for my purposes, you are Vidor Cur El Tempest!”</p><p> </p>
