Snape (a wily old snake and their self-assigned dissertation supervisor) has arranged their attendance at Flamel, deeming them unfit for adult life in the Wizarding world immediately after the final battle with Voldemort. They are partnered from the start (and soon sort out a mutually pleasing relationship on the side) and have been working closely with the university’s hand-me-down, hobbled-together EMMM to develop new types of industrialized and/or automatized incantation.. Their ultimate goal: to earn their Dominae Magicae or, in uni parlance, the ‘Grand MMer’ (<em>Magi magesteri</em>, Doctor of Magic), and to become fully independent, wage-earning adults. Strictly as a bonus, they happen to sort out how previously impenetrable barriers (such as the Veil) might possibly be safely breached by way of their invention, indicating a certain person of interest might eventually be retrieved. This discovery, oddly, is apparently of great scientific interest to one Severus Snape. This is a series of vignettes culled from their academic lives and culminating in the celebration revered by all Wizarding folk, Beltane.<br/> <b>Disclaimer:</b> Characters are the property of JK Rowling, et al.

Potter, Flamel U. 2002. </b><br/> <br/> 2001, Autumn, Department of Graduate Research, Flamel University. Subterranean Corridor Three-A, First Dungeon Level, Electro-Magno-Magical Research Department<br/> </em><br/> “Shocking!” <br/> <br/> Grey eyes wide as pie pans, pupils blown, razored fringe flying, lips pursed dramatically, pale eyebrows a slashy semaphore signal: a bored Draco Malfoy prowled the hallowed corridors of academe once more and Harry Potter was—once more— his favoured target. <br/> <br/> “Shit, but you startled me!” <br/> <br/> The sconces flared out of control in the surge of magical backwash. Potter, being Potter, balked and dodged. His stomach growled in sympathy, or maybe from the exertion. <br/> <br/> “Got you.” Malfoy grinned and made a strategic grab for it, nimbly circumventing Potter’s diversionary feint. “So, <em>so</em> gotcha, yessss!”<br/> <br/> The dazzle of white on white on white that was Malfoy in a poorly illuminated corridor was blinding. Potter blinked rapidly, a scowl growing, one hand on his trim belly.<br/> <br/> “Mine, mine, mine,” Malfoy trilled happily. “Yep.”<br/> <br/> “<em>Whaaat</em>?” his victim demanded of his attacker gruffly, his eyebrows all twitchetty-antsy in burgeoning temper, arcing black lightning in motion. “Oh, no, you don’t!” He made an abortive break for it; failed. “Lemme go!”<br/> <br/> “Uh-uh.” Malfoy didn’t. “Come along then. Places to go, Potter—things to do. I have plans for you.”<br/> <br/> “No, you don’t! Leave off now; I’m serious.” <br/> <br/> Potter snapped his teeth; his efforts to evade smartly checked. He was swarmed about with hands intent settling his hip and arm into some arcane position, then a smart foot was suddenly nudging his instep—and then he found himself neatly waltzed—and also tangoed—several lengths-worth down the low-lit hallway.<br/> <br/> “Lovely,” Malfoy observed, beaming down upon him in an attractively superior manner. “You’ve improved, I think. Much more sure-footed. Ballsier in the overall offense. Well done, Potter.”<br/> <br/> “Wanker!” his unwilling dance partner burst out, panting after the final fast twirl and a dip. “Silly damn wanker! I’m not dancing with you either, idiot! I’m for supper.” <br/> <br/> “Hah,” Malfoy sneered sweetly, clicking his heels and inclining his fair head. “Yes, you are and no, not at all—and lastly, no. Not yet. Really, Potter. Not a wanker; you know you love it.”<br/> <br/> “Don’t! I <em>don’t</em>,” Potter insisted. He glared up from beneath grouchily gathered brows. “And <em>do</em> listen to me for once, you infantile arsehole. <em>Stop</em> this infernal sneaking up on me.” He grumbled wordlessly under his breath when Malfoy essayed no reply but the unabated smirk. That, and a more in-depth grope as he subtly angled his companion nigh upon a close-by wall. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Draco,” Potter fussed, resisting. “Desist! You know for a fact I don’t like it.” <br/> <br/> “Liar. I know no such thing.” <br/> <br/> Potter scowled fiercely, as if very fierce scowling were the last possible word to be had on the subject of abduction-by-waltzing. “I do,” he insisted, attempting to edge away unsuccessfully. “<em>Not</em>. Don’t dare call me a liar. I am not and hardly ever have been a liar, Malfoy.”<br/> <br/> “Bugger that for a lark,” Draco grinned devilishly, clearly not impressed as all that. “You do too, my sweet Potter.” He stood proudly over his prize, crowding him and pawing him, nudging closer with knee, shin, hip and chest, and generally carrying on with his glad-handed grabbing. “You lie. You lie like my bloody flying carpet, right this moment. Pah! Like it, love it, deny it—what<em>ever</em>. It’s still a good thing, isn’t it? Being wanted. And I do want you—so. That’s the point, see? C’mere, won’t you? Squirmy git.” <br/> <br/> “Oh, blast,” Potter sighed resignedly as he was settled securely within two long arms clad in the white of the regulation lab coat. “And damn. Why do you <em>always</em>?” he demanded, clearly unhappy with his position as the filling in a Wall-Potter-Malfoy sandwich. “Always?” He shook his head in blatant disgust. “I mean, why <em>must </em>you? I<em> don’t</em> want—oh, never mind.” His lips turned up suddenly at the corners; a much brighter mien settled upon him overall as he raised his chin to meet Malfoy’s stare directly; tactics were clearly changing. “There’s food! Roast beef today and jacket potatoes. It’s dinner time, nitwit. Your very favourite, too.”<br/> <br/> “You <em>do </em>want,” his personal nemesis persisted sternly. “And fuck food,” Malfoy huffed as if food was something entirely beneath him. “Roast beef, bah,” he shrugged. Stomped a heel softly, as if Potter was annoying him with his obfustication over comestibles. “Food in general,” Malfoy pronounced superbly, “is for plebeians. It is the lowest rung of the hierarchy, dear Potter. Good company, now…” He arched a lean brow meaningfully. “Is much preferable. As I said, winsome wee warrior of mine—come along.” <br/> <br/> “Urgh.” Harry glanced behind him, acknowledging the wall and its obdurateness. Shook his head slowly, blinking away weirder-than-odd Malfoy’s take on nicknames…or had that been an endearment? Who knew; who could ever tell with a Malfoy, anyway? “No. No, it isn’t. It isn’t, Malfoy. It’s for normal people, food is, of which you are apparently not one. Demonstrably.” <br/> <br/> “Pish-tush.” His grinning arch-enemy only pecked at Potter’s nose tip, tickling it with the tip of his tongue. “Cute,” he sighed happily, withdrawing reluctantly and licking his lips. “You’re very cute. Don’t care about that nonsense. Let’s be off, my grouchy lovely. Emma awaits. There’s a cot with our name on it. Or…” His face twisted, eyes lighting up like fairy-lights, “or,” he purred, “we could do this here. Right here…hmm.” <br/> <br/> The tongue was applied a second time, meditatively. <br/> <br/> “Um. Yes. Yes, I think so. Don’t you?” <br/> <br/> “Bloody Merlin,” Potter fumed, angling frantically to avoid having his nostrils drenched by the tongue tip Malfoy taunted him with, tickling. “I am not cute! And I am not going with you, Malfoy. And why must you do this here, of all places? It’s wide open; anyone might come along. <em>Snape</em>, for gods’sake! And would you please, <em>please</em> stop with that?” he batted a hand up in the air, motioning impatiently. “You’re drowning me in saliva!” <br/> <br/> “See here, Potter,” Malfoy sneered, withdrawing and going cold as all Siberia, all at once, as if a frost Giant had struck him. “No…and again no. Not. Shan’t.” <br/> <br/> The wall met Potter’s spine with a gentle thump as Malfoy planted him there, firmly. <br/> <br/> “Read my lips, Potter. Nnnnnn. Ohhhhh.” <br/> <br/> “Oi!” Harry Potter reflected wryly, as he met a grey gaze that was adamantine as any old wall. “I won’t, you barking mad blighter. I’m not doing that sort of thing against a frigging wall again—remember last time? <em>Do</em> you?” <br/> <br/> As walls went, the University’s were no more ideal than Hogwart’s walls had been a fortnight before, upon the occasion of a usual monthly appointment with Headmaster Snape. When the same exact ridiculous scenario had taken place down the bottom of the Headmaster’s office spiral stairwell, albeit with an ambient sense of fondly displaced nostalgia, his spine had been jarred then as well. Malfoy had to resort to massage therapy, later. Much later. <br/> <br/> “Um,” Malfoy grinned, “…brilliant. Yes. That was a good one, Potter. Does not deter.” <br/> <br/> “Let. Me. Go, Malfoy,” Potter tried it again, scrambling to solidify his expression into one deathly serious and well, <em>meaning</em> it. “I mean it,” he stated firmly, brows lowered dangerously. “This. Is. <em>Not. </em>Happening. Get off me.”<br/> <br/> “Um.” <br/> <br/> Malfoy seemed to briefly consider their current position relative the wall, the corridor and the remainder of Flamel U., the denizens of which were to be heard far and up away in the distance, thundering off down stairwells and across ancient pavers to the dining hall. <br/> <br/> “Hmm.” <br/> <br/> “Yes?” Potter’s face briefly brightened with semi-hopeful anticipation…but then Malfoy jerked his chin just once in the decided negative, peering down at Potter through a welter of ice-blond lashes. <br/> <br/> “No?” Malfoy replied at long last, blinking those same eyelashes slowly, quizzically and very much cat-ate-cream. “No.” They glittered silver-gilt in the sconce light. “No, not a chance,” he added, clearly enjoying having the last word. “<em>No</em>.” <br/> <br/> “But…but, <em>why</em>?” <br/> <br/> Harry Potter shook his end-of-day, ‘work is finally over’ mop, the very tendril-y ends sparking blue-black with a rapidly rising-to-the-boil sense of frustration. <br/> <br/> “Problem?” Malfoy was entirely unfazed. <br/> <br/> “Why <em>now</em>, then?” It was a despairing howl, muffled immediately by twisting, grinning lips that descended abruptly, smashing at first but then clinging with all the sweetness of honey for an exquisitely long moment. <br/> <br/> “Oh! Nhnmm, stop that, I say!” Potter frowned, drawing his brows into nearly a single line. “Stop slobbering on me, okay? Now’s not the time and certainly not the place, alright? And <em>you</em>? You’re abso-fucking-lutely barking, Malfoy—you know that? <em>I </em>know that. For one, you’ve no common sense to your name, not a hair and no sense of public decency; what if someone comes along? And for two, I’m famished, by the way, as I mentioned. <em>Starving</em>. Want some food; going to supper right along with everyone else, before I faint dead away right here on the spot, and I don’t need your silly-arse shenanigans stopping me, Malfoy. Certainly<em> not</em> playing with you today, got it? Too damned hungry.” <br/> <br/> He folded his arms across his chest and pursed his lips. Everything about him screamed ‘So there!’<br/> <br/> “Poppycock.” Malfoy kissed the tip of his captive’s nose again, clearly uncaring of the faint rumble in his companion’s abdomen, the proof in the pudding his lab partner was indeed in need of substantial sustenance. “I’ll hold you up should you faint, Potter—never fear. Shan’t let you fall.” <br/> <br/> When Potter went instantly to swipe his nostril dry with a sleeve end, hard arms clamped down and instantly restrained him. <br/> <br/> “Uh-uh, none of that, now,” Malfoy chided, looking briefly wounded. “I see you eyes shifting; you can’t fool me.” Then his expression cleared; the brilliantly white slash of barmy grin redawning. “And, for your edification, Potter, it’s convenient, is all.” A pleased nod accompanied Malfoy’s quick survey of the deserted corridor. “Very.” The taller young man leaned in insistently, pressing every inch of his towering front into Potter’s passively resistant facade. “Most, yes.” <br/> <br/> “Oh, now wa—” <br/> <br/> Malfoy bent his head and leant in for all he was worth, crowding as much as he could manage. <br/> <br/> “Oof!” <br/> <br/> Potter was again kissed, long and slow and wet, the smirking lips lingering over damp edges and a pinkened chin.<br/> <br/> “Mmm…nnngh! Geroff!” <br/> <br/> “Potter,” Malfoy breathed. “Mmm, you do taste delicious. Again, please—and… again. ” <br/> <br/> “Bloody—ohgods!” Potter’s spine ground willingly enough into this wall despite his small struggles, and from his lips there issued a pleased groan as Malfoy nibbled and grazed. ”Draco, you idiot! How is this ever convenient?” <br/> <br/> “I think it’s perfect,” Malfoy retorted. “Don’t you agree?” <br/> <br/> “Not—not really—I don’t—at all! Aah! Hmm…mmh!” <br/> <br/> “...But, <em>really</em>…you do.” The grin was very much arrogantly assured, the eyes alight with dancing mischief. “And I’ll order a tray of supper for us later, I promise. Roast beef makes for an excellent sandwich. Now…kiss me. You fool.” <br/> <br/> “Wha? No—oh!”<br/> <br/> “Yes.” <br/> <br/> Potter’s knees threatened to buckle. <br/> <br/> “Yes, yes.” <br/> <br/> “…No!...”<br/> <br/> Malfoy had a whole arsenal of insidiously devastating techniques, all apparently designed to reduce his ancient archenemy to mush; he was using them diligently. <br/> <br/> “You do,” Malfoy cooed, busily exploring Harry’s throat with a fine fervour. “You…know…you…do. Really, really.”<br/> <br/> “Nnnnngh! Hah!” <br/> <br/> Harry’s head reared back heedlessly as Malfoy positioned his lips just so, suckling at an unguarded earlobe. He thumped his skull in a glancing blow against the rising stonework, which smarted for a half-second, as the stone was quite sturdy, having lasted a thousand years or more. The ambient chill of the dungeon space brushing his dampened lower jaw was making his skin prickle; he shivered uncontrollably. His stomach growled, insistent. <br/> <br/> “Oh—you’re chilled. Sorry, Potter. I’m sorry. Here, let me.” <br/> <br/> But Malfoy only hugged him fast, sharing body heat. Licked his throat side to side, as if he were the famished one and scrubbed a fast hard hand across Potter’s complaining middle.<br/> <br/> “Come on, forget about all that dumb stuff for a minute Kiss me, Potter,” he muttered. “Kiss me, kiss-kiss-kiss.” <br/> <br/> Word to deed done and Potter’s mouth was summarily muffled in sporadic spurts. “Well….” he squeaked, when he was able, “I—if you must—”<br/> <br/> “Must.” <br/> <br/> “Bu—”<br/> <br/> “No ‘buts’. Only arses—yours. And about that….<em>so </em>willing, Potter,” Draco cooed happily, drawing off after one last taste of succulent flesh. “Potter, Potter, Harry,” he singsong in Harry’s ear, proceeding calmly to make hay with the wires that connected Harry’s open mouth to Harry’s rising cock, employing fingers both deft and nimble…and oddly stained with chemicals and ingredients. “Stop your fibbing and just admit it; you want me. You’re gagging for me. Mmm, yes. Just…like…that. Like that.” <br/> <br/> “No—look!” Malfoy’s captive squirmed restlessly, feinting sideways in a last ditch bid for freedom, his own traitorous hands notwithstanding. “It’s—this isn’t—<em>Malfoy</em>! You know how I feel about this sort of PD—eep!”<br/> <br/> “Nawwwm, Harry,” Malfoy mumbled, nibbling his way across a newly exposed collarbone. ”So easy, you’re so easy for me, always. Always, always and I love that. Shut it, do—kiss me again. I want you. I’ll have you, too.” <br/> <br/> “I—!” <br/> <br/> “You know I will.” <br/> <br/> Malfoy snogged—and was snogged in sudden furious return, though his snoggee seemed inclined to bite. <br/> <br/> “Bastard!” Potter pronounced at the end of it. “You are a bas—”<br/> <br/> “Ah!” Malfoy panted happily, not at all put off. He pressed his advantage, which was now quite decided. “Umm…mmh, you’re hard already.” A hand snaked down between them to grope the evidence. “There, now, see? Told you, Harry.” <br/> <br/> “Oh—for fuck’s sake.” <br/> <br/> “Yes, exactly.” <br/> <br/> Malfoy radiated pleasure over the effects of his efforts. His dampened, well-kissed victim shut gob abruptly and blinked up at him, squinting intently through smeared specs. Draco smiling like that was a sight to see. Malfoys were bloody <em>dangerous</em>.<br/> <br/> “Huh,” he snorted, glaring feebly. “You did, didn’t you? Tell me.” <br/> <br/> “Mmm.” <br/> <br/> Malfoy nodded kindly. Harry glared harder. One could only fight fire with fire, apparently.<br/> <br/> “Fine, then! I give it, alright? Have you way, if it’s so important to you.” <br/> <br/> He twisted determinedly, unexpectedly putting his shoulder blades into play for leverage sufficient to launch himself pell-mell into Malfoy’s molestation. On impulse—or possibly in retribution—he nipped Malfoy’s collarbone. A mark bloomed almost instantly, darkening with a diffused hematoma in the dim light of the lowered torches. <br/> <br/> “Oh…it is,” Malfoy assured him solemnly. “Very much so.” <br/> <br/> “But,” Harry stood firm, literally, his legs planted like pillars despite the intrusion of Malfoy’s thigh pressing between them. “But! I am not <em>easy</em>, Malfoy,” he mumbled determinedly through the fold of fabric he was all at once presented with as Malfoy chuckled over top his head and squeezed him to breathlessness. “Never. <em>Easy</em>. This notwithstanding.” He gasped, threw up his hands for a brief flutter and just as quickly refastened them at Malfoy’s close-buttoned collar. Tugged at it frantically to haul the maddening face down to his level. “I am only cooperating this one time, d’you hear me? Just this once.” Malfoy blinked, silently. “Ookay, understand? Because I do want food sometime tonight and I know you won’t leave off—that’s the only reason. The only. And, in the future, do please wash your bloody hands first if you going to stick your fingers near my mouth, will you? Who knows what you’ve been messing with—mrpph?!” <br/> <br/> “Brilliant. Perfect,” Malfoy smirked. “I know you’d see it my way, Potter.” Which last issued from his lips sounding something like “Wa-ur-uudy-sss—rst! Nghnghngh…” to begin with, though the rest was effectively lost to the fingers Malfoy was thrusting rhythmically into that busy orifice. <br/> <br/> “No, really—they’re clean, Harry. Trust me.” <br/> <br/> Potter retaliated for the mufflement by placing both hands squarely on Malfoy’s chest and pushing with all his might, the wall at his bent back lending leverage. <br/> <br/> “Always…<em>always </em>taking…advantage,” he gritted darkly. “Not this time, you won’t. You don’t get everything you want, any time you want it, you know.” <br/> <br/> “Oh! So <em>mine, </em>” Malfoy purred, staggering slightly and transformed from merely <em>pleased</em> to absolutely, unbearably <em>smug</em> in an instant. “Yes, you are, then. And I know that, of course…it’s just.” <br/> <br/> “I’m not! I’m not anyone’s, twat! People aren’t property!” <br/> <br/> “Of course they aren’t—not in the normal way, Potter.” Malfoy immediately closed the two inch wide gap that had opened between them. “And right-oh, deny it. See if I care. But…eh! Sunshiney chap, aren’t you?” as Harry went to bite him on the arm. “Feisty, too. Just the way I like ‘em. Come at me, Potter. See what you get out of it, yeah? ” <br/> <br/> “Grr! Git!” Harry growled.<br/> <br/> “Mmm,” Malfoy hummed appreciatively. “I do so like it when you do that…did I say?” <br/> <br/> “Urk!” Potter gazed up, finally accepting the inevitable and sagging into his attacker’s welcoming arms. “You’re—I—oh, bloody, bloody hell! <em>Fine</em>—good! What<em>ever</em>! Do you worst, please. Come on.”<br/> <br/> “Cute,” was the instant reply. “Wanna shag you.” <br/> <br/> “Super! Great! I give in, alright? So…okay, shag me, then,” his captive flirtatiously suggested, affecting a major sea-change. He cuddled closer, pressing his hips into Malfoy’s in a very meaningful fashion. The meet-and-greet of two interested male members made him catch his breath abruptly. “Right now, alright?” he gasped, struggling to stay focused. “Since you want to so bad.” <br/> <br/> “Really? Now you’re willing, Harry?” Malfoy blinked fast; clearly he’d anticipated more a fight. “Well, okay the—“<br/> <br/> One thigh thrust between Malfoy’s taut ones, so cocks dragged together despite the layers of intervening fabric. “Oh, yes. Yes, I am. Get a leg over, will you? Get it on, you massive tit. Isn’t that why you accosted me in the fir—oh!” <br/> <br/> “I always accost you,” Malfoy agreed, between tiny biting kisses. “It’s my very…favourite…hobby.” <br/> <br/> Harry laughed, bursting into giggles very much against his will. <br/> <br/> “Silly arse.” <br/> <br/> “Yes, you are.” Malfoy remarked, obligingly twisting readily tautening nipples and grasping straining abs, skittering a firm, smooth hand down his partner’s tickly ribs in passing. “Very silly indeed and…very much mine. Don’t deny it, Harry.” <br/> <br/> “Sodding prick—always going on—!”<br/> <br/> “Oh, now, wa—”<br/> <br/> “And very much willing,” Malfoy stated flatly, though his mouth quirked wryly. “Least for the moment. Don’t tell me tales out of school, my wee little Potter—it doesn’t become you. Don’t like it.” <br/> <br/> “Buggering!” <br/> <br/> “Oh, shut it, harry. Grows old, all this fighting. Here, I’ll put paid to that nonsense.” <br/> <br/> Malfoy fell to tickling ribs with a will, grinding his hips down into the pelvis of bones Potter could not but help but present. Potter went ballistic in his arms, squirming and biting back squeals. <br/> <br/> “I hate—!”<br/> <br/> “Scrawny, though,” Malfoy observed mid-attack, sucking a much needed gasp of air and blinking fast at the pleasure of applied pressure. “Eat more, yeah?” <br/> <br/> “Fuck you!” Harry giggled, red-faced and painting. “Oh, just…just fuck….<em>you</em>! You did this—and I—oh, bugger <em>me</em>!” <br/> <br/> “That’s the idea,” Malfoy nodded urbanely, “specifically.” <br/> <br/> “Stop it!” <br/> <br/> “Hmm…maybe I will. Maybe,” Malfoy winked, “I might. If… you cooperate.” He drew away the offending fingers, eyeing Potter severely. “Will you, Potter? Cooperate?” He pecked Potter’s nose for the umpteenth time in a row. “I’d very much appreciate it. You’re wearing me out, you know. I’ve only so much energy to devote to this. I’m hungry, too.” <br/> <br/> “Oh, hah ha! Sneaky bastard, you got me,” Potter allowed grudgingly, breathing hard and eyeing his erstwhile assailant warily. “How can I not ‘cooperate’ now, you smooth-tongued cheeky bastard? You know, I really can’t stand you. I was <em>hungry</em>. Now you’ve got me all fuddled.” <br/> <br/> Malfoy handily ignored the last bit. Slopped his tongue across his fellow student’s cheekbone with barely restrained glee. <br/> <br/> “I always ‘get’ you, fuddled or no. Got you right now, don’t I? Despite you.” <br/> <br/> “Hmmm.” Potter’s lips twisted wryly; just a little quirk to them that meant ‘Come! Bring it!’ “We’ll see. Haven’t had me yet, have you?” <br/> <br/> “Yes I do. Or rather, will. Admit it.” <br/> <br/> “I can’t believe…you’re fucking <em>unbelievable</em>, Malfoy. You do acknowledge that, right? You’re a certifiable pain in my arse. Or just plain certifiable. Which reminds me, can we just…can we just wait? A little longer, please? Get some grub in our stomachs, at least?” <br/> <br/> Malfoy smiled. Sweetly.<br/> <br/> “I’m an excellent pain in your arse, Potter. So there. And…er, no? We can’t wait—<em>I</em> can’t wait, so. Shall we get on, please? I’ve been very patient, I think, with you. This has taken <em>ages</em>. We could be done by now.” <br/> <br/> “Merlin!” Potter giggled again, giving up entirely on trying to stifle it. He buried his flushed face in Malfoy’s armpit and shook with reluctant mirth. “Such an ass!” <br/> <br/> “Dick, Potter,” Malfoy stared down his nose imperiously. “I am currently all dick, thanking you kindly. How about it?” <br/> <br/> “That you are—no question.” <br/> <br/> “Hmmph!” <br/> <br/> It was just so ridiculous, the whole situation: stalking and being stalked, as if he and Malfoy were playing hide-and-seek in the hallowed halls of Flamel. Snape would skin them for slacking, truly, if ever he were to catch them. <br/> <br/> “But. Seriously, why here?” He did want to know that. There were such things as beds available. Beds being much preferable to walls. They had their own rooms, even though they only ever slept in Draco’s. There was even a cot in the back of the Lab, snuck in just for this purpose. <br/> <br/> “Here is brilliant.” Malfoy smiled sweetly again at the feigned lapse in faux scowling and dove in to seal their silent deal with a gap-jawed kiss, sloppy-hot. “Here is here,” he remarked after, as if this pronouncement were a gem of great wisdom. “<em>I’m</em> here, as it happens. There’s a convenient surface, fancy.” <br/> <br/> His voice overrode Potter’s ‘Well, duh!’ completely. The next passing kiss did the rest. <br/> <br/> “<em>You’re</em> here, aren’t you?” Malfoy resumed as if nothing had ever halted the flow of his logic. “That’s why it’s so convenient, see? Focus, Potter. Do follow. You’re supposed to be a bright chap. I read your exam results, remember?”<br/> <br/> “I am!” Potter gulped and swallowed. “Very bright, thank you.” He slid a hand between them, pressing down in his swollen bits. “Then, okay—if ‘here <em>is</em> good’—shag me <em>now</em>, you prick,” Potter was back on track, mock-stern and with beetled brow, when he was allowed up for air, long moments later. “Before<em> I</em> leave. Here.” <br/> <br/> “Uh-huh.” Disbelief was evident. “Right you say. Liar, liar, pants on fire.” <br/> <br/> “Hah! Can, too.” Potter shrugged casually, his gaze drifting off into the dim distance. “’Cause <em>really</em> I can, you know, any time I damn well want, ‘cause you can’t actually stop me. You wouldn’t.”<br/> <br/> “Uh-huh!” <br/> <br/> “And, say, go <em>there</em>. Instead. Up to supper. The bell’s gone twice now—we’re horribly, terribly late.” <br/> <br/> “Supper time?” Grey eyes opened wide as steel pie pans. Malfoy affected shock. “Is it? Already, Potter? Past that, I should say.” <br/> <br/> “Yes, supper!” Potter grimaced. “The meal traditionally taken in the evening, genius: supper.” <br/> <br/> “Dunno ‘bout that,” Malfoy mused, ignoring the toothless threat in favour of teasing. “I sense conflict.” He stroked his chin with a free hand, pulling a long face. “Scheduling. Here <em>is</em> convenient, now is more than excellent, but…here might also be discovered. That little sneak Creevey’s creeping about. Supper’s just been rung, I do admit. Heard the bells earlier, too—not deaf.” <br/> <br/> “Just an idiot.” Potter mumbled, but Malfoy didn’t pause. <br/> <br/> “Hustle-bustle up there, I’d say; might be a few strays still down on our level….hmm. There’s all that. To think of. We could be…” Then he paused, and dramatically, “discovered!’ He nodded, as if to agree with his own conclusion. “As I mentioned: shocking! Isn’t it?”<br/> <br/> “So?” Potter’s eyes snapped back to meet a pair of suddenly oh-so-serious grey ones. He sneered as they blinked blandly at him, lifting his chin several inches. Kissed Malfoy’s pointy chin. “And since when has that ever stopped you, Malfoy? From—this?” His brief nod indicated all that was between them at the moment—two cocks, pressing, and a few buttons undone at robe’s collars. “Animal. Filthy, filthy creature you are.”<br/> <br/> “Hmm,” Malfoy nodded, smiling. “Possibly.” <br/> <br/> Potter was kissed—soundly, and again, and apparently in lieu of a detailed response, though there was a distinct rumble to be heard on Malfoy’s part. Which may have been residual hunger but was more likely frustrated ardour. Potter shrugged at it and participated more fully, returning good as he got, given that he was still the Filling in the sandwich. <br/> <br/> The snog was warm…nay, searing. Beguiling, after a bit. It seemed to consist entirely of moving lips that said nothing much aloud—and yet everything of importance: ‘<em>Here’s </em>important’; ‘<em>Now</em> is best’…and <em>‘I</em> need you’. ‘More than food. More than anything.’ <br/> <br/> …And hands that spread fingers wide across his back, protecting him from the wall’s scratchy surface. And hips, rolling—thighs, pressing—cocks, rubbing through cloth. <br/> <br/> “Oh….” Potter moaned, after a moment’s more eager participation, reeling back under the hotness, which was undeniable. “This! This! <em>This</em>!” <br/> <br/> “Yessss, this!” <br/> <br/> Everywhere, every-fucking-where those lips were and especially all down Harry’s neck: wet, rubbed pink and sensitive with Malfoy’s endless nibbling, and yes…it was enticing all the same and rather mind-blowing. Potter submitted, at last, convinced. <br/> <br/> “Mmm, that…precisely,” Malfoy breathed his approval into Potter’s ear. “That’s good, Potter. This. Better than.” <br/> <br/> Approval was all well and good but Potter was at the stage of expecting something more…concrete. And…active. <br/> <br/> “Nhn! You make no sense!” <br/> <br/> When Potter pulled back—with a muffled gasp and a hard squeeze to Malfoy’s upper arms; he was grasping at them with all his might, dragging Malfoy against him; fancy that!—he found himself regarded dead-level by a very interested blond man with a major boner. A man whom Potter instantly concluded was far too smug and otherwise unshaken after experiencing a snog like <em>that</em>. Should be taken down a notch, this man. <br/> <br/> “Well?” he prodded, making ready to do exactly that. “Malfoy? You were…?” <br/> <br/> “Hmmm,” Malfoy hummed, his quick tongue stilled for the moment and apparently happily occupied with just simply observing Harry in all his tumbled state, nothing else. “Nh.”<br/> <br/> “Malfoy!” <br/> <br/> “…Hmm, see?” Malfoy shrugged happily. “Here is—most excellent, Potter. As is now. As I said. Hang dinner. And concede the point, do. Tray later.” <br/> <br/> “Bugger.” It was all very irritating-making, the situation. “I already did. You win. Have won. Get on with it, then. I’m waiting.” Potter scowled, impatient. His stomach rumbled, reminding him abruptly of the bells. “Barmy arse.” <br/> <br/> Pavlovian, yes, but there were basic needs other than sex, too, to be considered. He shifted, the wall cold and hard at his back, as walls often were. “Well? Missing out on beef, nice and rare, I should think. My favourite. Your favourite. So…er?” <br/> <br/> He hopped from foot to foot, stumbling over Malfoy’s toes stationed between them.<br/> <br/> “What, in Merlin’s name, are you waiting for?” <br/> <br/> “Hnh.” Malfoy made no move to follow through, prat that he was. He did set up a little tattoo of toe-tapping; Potter dearly wished to stomp down hard on the offending insole. “Mhmm. Dunno…” <br/> <br/> “Malfoy.” <br/> <br/> “…Hmm...” Malfoy added, after a long, slow beat, which ratcheted up Potter’s growing sense of internal ire by tens of millions degrees Centigrade. “Then again…”<br/> <br/> “Oh my freaking Merlin—<em>you</em>! <em>Now </em>you’re hesitating? All that and now?” <br/> <br/> Harry Potter had learnt a few things in his years of post-grad schooling, one being that Malfoys could be wheedled. <br/> <br/> “Okay, okay, alright. We’ll play it your way, for once.” He wriggled against the wall at his back, pulling a face as Malfoy smiled down at him, long, slow and brilliant. “It’s chilly.” <br/> <br/> The stones scraped at him, irritating in the way inanimate things often were; the slate floor was cold even through his rubber soles. <br/> <br/> “<em>I’m </em>hungry.” <br/> <br/> Flamel University was younger in years than Hogwarts but no less forbiddingly constructed; those stone walls were downright uncomfortable. <br/> <br/> “Even if <em>you</em> aren’t, twat for brains. This is taking too long, if you ask me. So stop teasing. And also, okay? This hurts my spinal vertebrae, Draco. So—massage, along with the tray. In the bath, preferably.”<br/> <br/> “Ah?” Clearly Malfoy was being offered a clear opportunity to attack. His eyebrows rose disbelievingly. “…Really, now? You’re not comfortable? I should…hurry it up then, shouldn’t I? The process?” <br/> <br/> “Really!” Potter gave in to inner urgings and crashed a rubber-soled foot down upon Malfoy’s for emphasis. “Really, yes, you should! Fucking twat! Why is it you now turning tables? Were you just born difficult, Malfoy?” <br/> <br/> “Then…I will.” <br/> <br/> “Now? Good-oh. Alright, then, finally!”<br/> <br/> “…Since <em>you </em>insist—”<br/> <br/> “Please! I insist! I damned well insist upon it. Take me—make me scream, git.”<br/> <br/> “Dunno…are you sure, Potter? Positively, absolutely beyond certain?” <br/> <br/> Harry inhaled sharply: Draco’s eyes were so all-at-once blazing and tempestuous; so brilliantly alit as to be unholy with sordid promise. <br/> <br/> “Oh god.” He licked his lips in slow motion, tongue just flickering out, and Potter swallowed with difficulty, staring at them rapt, wetting his own with a quick slither of pink wet organ tip. “Please?” <br/> <br/> “Now?”<br/> <br/> “Now, yes! Now’s good.” <br/> <br/> “M’okay. Don’t say I didn’t warn you, Harry.”<br/> <br/> Slow motion lunges seemed exactly the right moves to make when there were other pink wet organs to think of. <br/> <br/> “Because you’re not the only one famished….”<br/> <br/> Quality of relative surfaces forgotten entirely, two sets of lab robes fell disregarded in a soundless hush; the sconces guttered low upon a simple echoing finger snap from Malfoy. <br/> <br/> “Now…Potter!” <br/> <br/> Level Three-A was deserted, but for them. Thank fuck. But it might not be, soon enough. There was something excessively satisfying about it being ‘now’ and not ‘later’; a certain air of risk that pleased them both. And the latent tinge of supper-wanting echoing through their young guts helped. Was like one sort of hunger teetering atop another primal hunger, eking appetites out by stretched degrees. Thrilling. <br/> <br/> Shocking. Waltzing to no music but the waft of air—shocking. Superb. <br/> <br/> “Potter?” Potter was blinked at owlishly when the man’s mouth stilled its nipping assault on the underside of Malfoy’s pointy chin. “Potter? Alright? Pay attention, do. I’m ravishing you.” <br/> <br/> “Do, then.” Harry shivered uncontrollably. “Please, please do. Want you.” <br/> <br/> “Want you too. Always want you.” <br/> <br/> Malfoy immediately leant hard against him, intent scribed in every line, every darting glance. Everything about Potter spoke of muted challenge; everything about Malfoy reacted instantaneously, meeting that—topping it with an nth more, a smidgeon higher. <em>Hard</em> transfigured into <em>stone-hard</em>, like the granite framework about them. Kisses morphed into assaults on specified nerve endings. <br/> <br/> “Potter!” Malfoy joined Potter in the general groaning and gasping. “Potter, Potter, Potter…<em>Harry</em>. Give it.” <br/> <br/> “Uhnnn…” Every-bloody-thing, from deliberate ankle twisting against shin to trip Harry should he choose to bolt to the cock hot as blazes shoved against the indent-and-contrary bulge of robe-swagged crotch. “Draco—oh!” <br/> <br/> Harry keened; Draco grunted. Mouths met, mouths lingered, eyelids went heavy—‘til an echoing thud down what should’ve been an emptied hallway sent them into abrupt stasis. The sound of a...door, thudding, perhaps?<br/> <br/> “What was that?” <br/> <br/> “Mmm…erm?” Potter’s eyebrows winged up in query. “Dunno?” He twisted his head on his neck, craning to see around or even through the shoulders blocking his view. “Um…maybe nothing? The stairs moving?” <br/> <br/> “All clear?”<br/> <br/> “Check it, then. Not sure.” <br/> <br/> “You.” <br/> <br/> “And you, Draco. Together.” <br/> <br/> As one, they each glanced about them; one to the left, one to the right: searching and furtive, seeking. Tendrils of magic followed, feeling in all directions. <br/> <br/> Cocks throbbed, caught wanting, barely hidden behind skewed fabric. Stomachs rumbled, acid stirred out of limbo. The hall was dim, the sconces at their very lowest, barely flickering. Far in the distance could be heard the creak and groan of their hand-built machine down the hall and, farther still, one and half floors above them, the murmur of faint youthful voices and hundreds of trompling feet, rushing down Flamel’s central stairwell on their way to supper. <br/> <br/> “No,” Malfoy stated firmly, after a long moment. “Harry?” <br/> <br/> It had been nothing, the sound. Perhaps just the building shifting, as elderly structures were wont to do. <br/> <br/> “Clear.” Potter pronounced it. “Yes. S’alright.” <br/> <br/> “Come on, then. Come <em>on</em>. Give me.” <br/> <br/> “Yeah.” <br/> <br/> ‘Hang Creevey,’ might almost have been heard, unspoken between them but clearly present. And ‘Sod it if it’s a public corridor; who cares?’ on Potter’s part. ‘Fuck dinner,’ on Malfoy’s. <br/> <br/> “Urgh!…If you’re going to?” Potter scrabbled at Malfoy’s hips to haul them closer. “You <em>are</em> going to, aren’t you, Draco?” <br/> <br/> “Oh, yes.” <br/> <br/> Malfoy smiled as he dropped chin to nuzzle into the hollow ‘neath Potter’s jaw. He buried his face there, crooning--licking. Sucking to mark. Harry’s eyes closed immediately. It was dim and cold; they were naked and hungry. The wall hurt. <br/> <br/> “Brill.” <br/> <br/> “Mmh.” <br/> <br/> The air about them positively crackled, sending up an eerie echo from the Lab. Emma, waking. It hummed, high and nearly soundless, and the sconces blew out entirely. Fingers dug into Potter’s crack, preparing. He spread his legs wider, making ready. There was oil of out nowhere; smelt of citrus and almonds. Smelt of musk and want. <br/> <br/> “Come on.” Not a command so much as a plea. Which of them said it neither knew for certain. Didn’t matter, either way. “Come on.” <br/> <br/> “Oh…<em>I will</em>.” </p>
