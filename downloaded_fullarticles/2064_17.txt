    <p>The half-blood Prince.  A man that in all likely hood is probably dead.  The potions text must be upward of fifty years old, but these facts don’t seem to calm my resolve.  I’ve learned more from the Prince than from any other teacher in this school.  And not just potions or general magic.  This wasn’t just a potions textbook.  Not to the Prince.  It was a journal, a log of his ideas, a record of thoughts.  The margins of the slightly yellowed pages hold his neat penmanship.  Though mostly dischanted now, Hermione told me that whomever this book belonged too has several wards and protective charms placed on this innocent looking book.  We aren’t even sure of every spell the Prince used.  With time, Hermione possibly could discover all of it’s secrets, but I gave her a lame excuse about not being curious or some such.  Really.  I didn’t want her reading the intimate words that I felt only the Prince and I had seen.  Words that only I could understand.</p>
<p>The suggestions for potions proved to be invaluable.  Educational.  Useful.  These were some of the reasons I became absorbed in the words scrawled in neat penmanship.   I don’t know what possessed the Prince to write his innermost thoughts, but each word written, I reread countlessly. </p>
<p>
  <em>I wish I could run away.  ~P</em>
</p>
<p>Sometimes slivers of his unhappiness will poke through.  His disdain for others.  Anger.  But I understand it all too well.  Some margins would have short poems, or pleas for help.  The distaste would sit in the pit of my stomach as I would read distressed words.</p>
<p>
  <em>Today I was going to kill myself.  I changed my mind at the last moment.  I think I just don’t want my body to be found and for everyone to know that the abuse actually affected me.  ~P</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She will never forgive me for this one on her own, and I am unable to talk to her as I once could.  Her friendship is the only thing I have of any importance, so I must think of a way to earn her forgiveness. ~P</em>
</p>
<p>He would often speak of a Her or She, but never actual names.  From the way he wrote, I feel certain that it was the same girl.  I would think he was in love with her if not for the few moments where he all but confessed to being gay.</p>
<p>
  <em>If I were normal everything would be so much simpler, but I’m not normal.  ~P</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She is the only one who knows about my preference, I trust her, but I still would feel more comfortable if this abnormality were known only to myself.  ~P</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I’ve started work on a potion to right my unnatural interest in the wrong sex, but thus far I’ve found no cure.  ~P</em>
</p>
<p>I surmised that the Prince was a lonely person who -though immensely talented- didn’t know how to be likeable.  He rarely wrote of his home life, but when he did, it was never positive.  Poverty.  Abuse.  He seemed to use this book as an escape from a world that didn’t want him.  It was almost eerily familiar. </p>
<p>His words were not always kind, but I could see the light behind his steely words.</p>
<p>
  <em>I’m the monster!  I’m the freak!?  Fine.  I will bide my time, but I will not always be someone easily pushed around.  I’ll become strong.  I’ll become the sort of person that no one can take advantage of. ~P</em>
</p>
<p>I think all the Prince wanted was someone to reach out their hand and try to understand him.  Try and look past the carful illusion, and save him.  And I think that’s what brought me here.  Invisibility cloak over my head as I sneak down to the abandoned girl’s restroom for the third week in a row- the Prince’s book in hand.  His carefully written words still pounding in my head.</p>
<p>
  <em><strike>Her friendship is the only thing that I have ever valued in my life.  If I can create this potion then I will be able to obtain her forgiveness.</strike>  I should just give up.  I have brewed countless potions, but this one may very well be impossible.  I’ve spoiled so many ingredients in my quest to right my wrong, but She wouldn’t forgive me even if I did succeed in making this potion.  I deserve as much.  ~P</em>
</p>
<p>Above the lines are ingredients and steps to an unnamed potion.   I’ve not told anyone about my goal, I know they would laugh.  I have plans to brew a potion -that I know nothing about, not even the use for it- that even someone as talented as the Prince couldn’t brew.  Merlin.  It may not even be possible, but I have to try.  I have to try. </p>
<p>I know that I have little talent in potions.  Most of what I know I obtained from this very book.  The writer couldn’t even brew this tricky concoction.  I don’t have a single change.  But.  I’m here again.  Trying.</p>
<p>I feel that the Prince is a kindred spirit.  He says so many things that I intimately understand.  Things that I can’t share with anyone.  Not even Ron or Hermione.  Thoughts of bitterness and pain to the point that suicidal contemplations are an everyday occurrence.  Not that I ever could.  There is too much riding on my existence.  Too much sacrificed just for me to live.  His dark somber words echo inside of me though, and I understand him at least this much.</p>
<p>
  <em>I don’t know how to play the game; so, naturally I end up losing.  The world certainly wouldn’t care if I were to ‘go missing’, and without her, no person could care either.  My mother and father would even be glad.  I don’t mind dying, but I want to do at least one thing worthwhile.  Even if no one will remember me for it, that’s fine.  ~P</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Admitting fear is not something I can let show.  I wish that they were dead.  My parents.  Those idiots that harass me.  Especially him.  He enjoys making a sport out of humiliating me in front of everyone.  As if my existence weren’t already difficult enough.  He can have Her if She wants Him.  I do not want to stand in the way of Her happiness, but she’s my best friend.  <strike>I love her</strike>.  There.  I said it.  I can’t say it to her.  I don’t want to be alone.  But I understand that I don’t really deserve her friendship.  I’ve mucked everything up to much.  I hate myself.  ~P</em>
</p>
<p>The glimpses into his life show like a mirror.  I do not think it’s likely that I will solve the mystery of this nameless potion, but for him I’d like to try.  I follow the recipes and the alterations to it not really knowing what I’m looking to happen.  I follow the Prince’s notes trying to think how I believe he would.</p>
<p>
  <em><strike>3 drops of Phoenix tears.</strike> (the potion is more volatile than expected more Phoenix tears needed) </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>A sprig of aged holly grinded with a <strike>pewter pestle</strike> (A stone pestle provides better results- more experiments needed)</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Simmer for <strike>2 hours</strike> stirring counterclockwise every <strike>10 </strike>minutes (half an hour will suffice- stir continuously)</em>
</p>
<p>The instructions go on with several crossed-out sections and improvements.  On a separate paper, in my own hand, I write out the instructions and every combination of both the old and new suggestions.  I’ve already attempted to brew this potion twenty-eight times.  Each time ends in similar ways.  Fumes and smoke. </p>
<p>“Trying again?”  Myrtle asks as she flies overhead.  She knows what I’m trying to do, I pretty well had to tell her so that she will keep what I’m doing in her territory a secret.  A wave of curiosity sets in.</p>
<p>“Myrtle, you’ve been haunting this bathroom for a while right?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes Harry.”  She smiles seemingly happy to have me take an interest in her.</p>
<p>“Do you know who the half-blood prince is?” </p>
<p>“Maybe.”  She says non-committedly.  “I’ve had a lot of people try to come here.  Most of the time hoping to snog a boy or girl they like in private, but I’ve also had a few people come and use my bathroom to do just what you’re doing.  Brew unregistered potions.”  I hold the book gently against my chest.</p>
<p>“Have you ever had someone come here trying to kill themselves?”  She blinks at me a few times.</p>
<p>“I’ve gotten attached to a few students since I’ve died.  The students come and go, but I remember them anyways.  Some talk like I’m not here.”  She hasn’t really answered my question.  “If you add mermaid scales instead of the oil shales, then the potion will turn a yellow color.  That’s how you know it’s done.  You aren’t as talented as the owner of that book, but you are just as stubborn.” </p>
<p>“So you did know him?”</p>
<p>“Do.  I do know him.  When you are a ghost you learn things.  This castle is my home, I want to protect it just as much as everyone else.  Make the potion and then drink it while thinking about the half-blood prince.  That should get you your answers.”  I want to ask her more, but she makes it clear that she will not answer my questions.  “Just consider this my contribution to the war effort.”  I follow her instructions only a bit leery of what she’s planning.  It takes three full hours, but it turns yellow just like she said it would.  I wait for it to cool and then thinking about the Prince, I take a sip.</p>
<p>And promptly pass out.</p>
