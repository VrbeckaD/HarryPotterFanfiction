  <span>Standing still, Percy took a deep breath to steady himself. This was a make-or-break deal. He gave a quick glance to the glass-like coffin, his blue eyes suddenly burning with tears like always at seeing its occupant. His younger brother, Fred Weasley, lay there so silent, looking oddly peaceful. It was something that would never cease being unnatural as the current situation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Giving a small shake of his head to force the thoughts away, Percy focused on what he had to do. His eyes met the small, well-hidden lab's only other occupant, George Weasley. The look on his normally jovial face was concerned and torn, but that was to be expected. He'd thought Percy had gone completely bonkers after the battle at Hogwarts, which Percy could admit was perfectly understandable. He had focused on something that hadn't seemed very important at the time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're sure you want to do this, Perce? It's total lunacy."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At George's words, Percy just slowly nodded his head, steeling himself. "Yes, George. I know you don't quite agree, but you and Fred are bloody geniuses. That gag for swapping bodies candy was brilliant," He replied, "And having seen my memories of that...moment Fred died, you know his soul was pulled from his body and due to the candy, vanished before he was truly dead."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>George sighed defeatedly. "So, explain again why I can't do this?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Breath hissing between his gritted teeth, Percy let his gaze harden on his younger brother. He didn't have time for this; he was trying to concentrate on what he had to do. "Because George, you are Fred's other half. You will be the anchor for his soul to return to his body when I find it. And I will find it in that other world," he stated in a very determined and cold voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seeing George flinch caused Percy to look down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Besides, look at it this way. Once news of what I've done gets out, I will be branded a criminal," he muttered. "Messing with time, using a magical tool without permission. Technically, I'll be bringing the dead back to life, but even that punishment pales in comparison to what we know Mum will do at learning what I am doing and how I used her custom and perfected preserve charm."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The loud snort of agreement mixed with amusement from George cleared the tension, allowing Percy to smile. The only thing he hadn't mentioned to George was that he would be unable to come back. This would be a one-way trip for him, for better or worse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shall we?" he asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The slight nod was all he needed, and it was time to move into the carefully crafted and drawn magic circle. He raised his wand, George mimicking him, and they chanted the spell he had specifically created in unison. Power began filling the circle, and it washed over his person like a wave, leaving his body feeling as if he had a severe sunburn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, see you when you get back, Perce!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unable to stop himself, he felt the tears he'd been holding back fall down his face, and George's face instantly registered understanding. But it was too late; already, he could feel a strong pull on his body. Percy lifted his empty hand and waved a final goodbye to his younger brother as he disappeared. His body feeling a mix of disorientated and queasy; it was just like when he apparated, only this time, on a much grander scale.</span>
