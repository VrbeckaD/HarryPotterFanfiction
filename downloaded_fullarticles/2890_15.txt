    <p>Remus John Lupin liked to think of himself as relatively smart.</p><p>He and his best friend Lily Evans were both tied for being the top of their class. Remus already was approved for a full ride scholarship to the University of his choosing. He already had half of his college completed due to his AP classes and dual enrollment courses that allowed him to get ahead. His goal was to earn his master’s degree by the time he was twenty-two. He had the drive and the funding, he could do it.</p><p>The problem with a boy like Remus is that he felt that he was…well…<em>boring</em>. And maybe he was. He wore beanies, cardigans with homemade elbow patches, and jeans that had too many holes in them from constant wearing. He drank tea and read old tomes of books that nobody in the modern age has heard of.</p><p>On paper this made Remus sound like a pretentious hipster. The reality of it was worse. See, Remus was an eighty-year-old man stuck in the body of a seventeen-year-old boy. He did everything un-ironically and was genuine in how he looked and felt.</p><p>He never acted like a child, not even when he was an infant. Remus did not believe in being reckless or carefree. Every action had a consequence and he tried his best to make sure he did not screw his life up when he was so young and had such a bright future ahead of him.</p><p>Winter Break was already here, December marked that the school year was halfway over.</p><p>Which is why we now find Remus in Lily’s living room with both her and his second-best friend, Peter Pettigrew, arguing over the fact that Remus should do something daring.</p><p>“We’re seniors and you’ve never even skipped once,” Peter pointed out from his spot on the floor across from the couch, leaning heavily on the coffee table.</p><p>Remus shrugged, “I’ve never seen the point.”</p><p>“Dude, what about sex? You’re still a virgin, right?” Peter asked before taking a fist of potato chips from the bowl that was on the coffee table and shoving it into his mouth. “That’s something you can do.”</p><p>“Sex is a social construct,” Remus rolled his eyes. He was perched on the recliner, knees curled up towards his chest. “Really Peter, it’s not that big of a deal.”</p><p>“You’re so vanilla!” Lily griped from her spot on the sofa. She has spread out, hands resting on her stomach. “Honestly, you have to do at least one thing exciting this year.”</p><p>“Who’s your celebrity crush?” The voice belonged to Petunia, who was leaning against the entryway to the living room. Petunia was Lily’s older sister, home from college for the holidays. “You want to do something different this year? Do one of those promposal’s that are so popular. Ask out a celebrity. The worse they can do is say no.”</p><p>Lily immediately sat up from her spot on the sofa, ginger hair a frizzy mess haloing her face, “she’s right! That’s perfect!”</p><p>Remus and Peter exchanged a glance before giving Lily their attention.</p><p>“I don’t have a celebrity crush,” Remus stated. This, in fact, was a lie. One that he hoped his friends didn’t look too closely at, because Remus was not one to do stupid things such as record a promposal ™ for a random stranger over the internet.</p><p>Peter perked up, “yes you do!” There went any hope that they would move on from the topic.  “That one singer, what’s his name? Oh, the one who models for that one brand? Ugh, he’s been in movies!”</p><p>Remus kept his face carefully passive, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Lily snapped her fingers, “I know exactly who you’re talking about! Remus was saying how he’d have his babies if he could. Oh my gosh he’s so hot too. Um!”</p><p>“<em>Sirius Black</em>!” Both exclaimed at the same time.</p>
<hr/><p>Sirius Orion Black liked to think of himself as amazing. He was God’s gift to the people of the world, and he reveled in all the attention that he received due to his profession. Which in retrospect probably wasn’t healthy and he more than likely substituted where his parents love should have been with the adoration he received from his fans.</p><p>He came from a wealthy family. Walburga Black was a designer whom everyone was aware of. She was a household name. Sirius had begun his career as a model for his mother before being kicked out of his family home and signing on with Hogwarts Records and debuting his first album when he was fifteen. Singing and modelling had opened doors for acting. He was honestly a triple threat and was constantly worrying about peaking so young.</p><p>At eighteen he was one of the world’s top 25 under 25 successful millionaires. Self-made as it were since his mother had decided to take away his inheritance.</p><p>Right now, Sirius Black was on vacation from <em>everything</em>. Too exhausted to care much about the world.</p><p>He had just wrapped up his latest tour and wasn’t due back in the studio for another month or so. His agent, Minerva McGonagall, was gracious enough to permit some sort of holiday for the young man. Currently he was crashing at his best friend’s house. James Potter was like a brother, the two were nearly joined at the hip. They had the same mischievous grins and could easily speak in an exchange of glances without saying a single word to each other.</p><p>“Oi, tosser, did you see the vid Reg sent?” James asked while barging into the guest room that Sirius had been staying in.</p><p>Guest room was the broad term that the Potter family used, it was dubbed as Sirius’ room years ago.</p><p>“The one about the cat?” Sirius asked, not glancing up from his book. “He keeps sending me stupid shite like that.”</p><p>James threw himself onto the large bed besides his best friend. “No, the one with the guy asking you out.”</p><p>This, in fact, earned him Sirius’ attention. “Say what now?”</p><p>Dark brown eyes gleamed at Sirius before James pulled out his phone and clicked onto his Instagram account. “Look.”</p><p>The boy in the video was around their age, honey blond hair falling over his forehead and covering heavy dark brows. He had a black beanie slouching on his head, golden brown eyes looking straight at the camera, his skin was pale. His nose was a little long, but his mouth was nice and full, and his cheek bones were quite noticeable on his thin face. Sirius was a little surprised to hear an American accent when he spoke.</p><p>“Hello Sirius, my name is Remus. I’m a senior in high school and I was wondering if you’d like to go to prom with me? My prom is in May, please let me know if you’re interested.” It was a simple video, done in a room that had rose themed wallpaper and bright lighting.</p><p>It wasn’t as if the video were anything special. There was no fanfare to it, it was quite simple. And it only had 64 likes, but Sirius couldn’t help but read some of the comments.</p><p><strong>Wormtail</strong>: yyyaaaaassssss!!!</p><p><strong>Longbottomed</strong>: Ur alwaz so blasé R.</p><p><strong>DorkyDorcas</strong>: I’ll go to prom with you!</p><p><strong>LilyFlowerrr</strong>: Ha! Glad you posted &lt;3</p><p><strong>The Little King</strong>: <strong>@Padfoot</strong> <strong>@Prongs</strong> did you two see this vid posted by <strong>@Moony</strong>? You should watch it.</p><p>“How did Reg even find this?” Sirius rolled away from the phone to stare up at the ceiling. “It didn’t go viral, and even though this Remus fellow tagged my official I.G, everyone does that. I don’t even look at the tags anymore. I think Regulus stalks my account.”</p><p>“What would ickle Minnie say about this?” James questioned playfully.</p><p>“My Minnie would have mixed feelings. Ultimately, she is a selfish lover and would hate to share me like that,” Sirius sighed dramatically. “Bugger but he is a handsome one, hm?”</p><p><strong>Lily</strong> (3:36PM): !!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><strong>Remus</strong> (3:36PM): ?</p><p><strong>Lily</strong> (3:38PM): GO. LOOK. AT. SIRUIS. BLACKS. INSTA.</p>
<hr/><p><strong>Peter</strong> (3:35PM): HOLY SHIT BRO!</p><p><strong>Remus</strong> (3:36PM): ?</p><p><strong>Peter</strong> (3:38PM): Look at SBs IG!</p>
<hr/><p>“Hi everyone,” Sirius’ voice was as rich as ever. He grinned charmingly at the camera, the sunlight above him reflecting brightly off his ink black hair. He was at a poolside, and despite it being winter in most places of the world, he appeared to be warm and fresh. Large black aviators covered half of his face, but it did not take away from his attractiveness. “’Bout a week ago I was asked to prom by this fetching young man. Even though it’s not until May, I’ve arranged my calendar around it. So, Remus, my answer to you is yes. I'd love to go to prom with you.”</p><p> </p>
