    <p>He smelt him.</p><p>As soon as Draco Malfoy walked into the courtroom, Harry Potter's senses were assaulted with a scent like no other. One that could only be described as purely Draco Malfoy. Something similar to spearmint, soap and maybe sugar?</p><p>Harry's eyes snapped to the frail blond that stepped through a side door where he was lead by two aurors to the seat that stood in the middle of the room. </p><p>When Draco sat down, his head fell forward, causing a piece of his immaculate blond hair to fall loosely in front of his face. He seemed to be in a daze of some sort; his gaze focused on the floor in front of him, his head hung low, and his lungs taking in deep long breaths. </p><p>Harry sat on the edge of his seat, his Alpha senses coming into play at the newly formed Omega that sat before him. He wanted to reach forward, tuck the piece of hair behind the blonds ear, and stare into those steel grey eyes that he so vividly remembered. He wanted to trace the sculpted features of the blonds face, run his hands through the soft locks that fell effortlessly back, and stare deep into those grey eyes that always took his breath away. </p><p>Draco Malfoy, of course, did not look nor act like the poncy git Harry and his friends knew from Hogwarts. He was quiet, still, and more beautiful than any other creature Harry had ever seen. Draco would look quite peaceful to those around him but Harry could smell something very close to fear radiating off his small body. </p><p>The Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, sat high in his chair, towering over the jury and audience in the courtroom, which consisted of the Wizengamont and a single raven-haired saviour. Harry's best friends, Ron and Hermione, waited outside the courtroom, seeing as this was one of the many private trials that took place. "Well, my dear colleagues and friends, we come to a close for the day with the trial for one 'Draconius Lucius Malfoy'." As Kingsley read off the blonds crimes, Harry watched as he didn't visibly tremble or shake, but sat there silently, accepting whatever fate was coming his way. </p><p>Harry was leaning so far off his seat, subconsciously trying to get closer to the blond, to the magnificent sent of the Omega, that he was surprised he didn't fall off. He snapped up from his daze as he heard the minister call on him to make his statement towards Draco. </p><p>When did he become Draco instead of Malfoy?<br/>
Well, since he walked in the room and Harry discovered the beauty of the blond.<br/>
And his scent, oh his scent that Harry practically thirsted for.<br/>
So, a few minutes before this. </p><p>Harry cleared his throat as he tried to remember how to form words, "Well, Minister Shacklebolt, I've known Draco Malfoy for 8 years, and although we've had our differences, and he's made a few mistakes in his past, I can assure you that he isn't a ruthless Death Eater that many accuse him of being. And he certainly doesn't deserve to be thrown in Azkaban." Honestly, no matter how hard he tried, Harry could not figure out where that statement came from, or the great effect it had on the jury. </p><p>Draco finally lifted his head and stared at Harry as he made his speech, mouth gaping slightly at the words that exited from the raven-haired boy's mouth. </p><p>Harry stared up at the Minister as he spoke, not daring to look at Draco, in fear of the expression that covered his face. </p><p>Anger, disbelief, rejection kept ringing in Harry's ears as he thought of what the blond was thinking about him. </p><p>But what he smelt proved to be the exact opposite of what he thought: shock, regret, and something warm, maybe longing?</p><p>Harry knew he was crazy for thinking this way so he shut it out and waited for the Minister's reply. </p><p>Being the powerful Alpha he was, Harry was able to 'block' out the scents that flooded his senses. Why didn't he do this when the blond first came in the room? Well, he had never been in the presence of such a fresh Omega, let alone the strong, addictive scents he gave off.  Harry tried his best to focus on the trial and not the pestering need that itched at the back of his mind to break free. </p><p>"Well, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy certainly can't just be dismissed because of a few mistakes." One of the Wizengamont jurists said. </p><p>"He knew what he was doing, he could have said 'no' and saved himself all this trouble." Another said.</p><p>Harry scoffed as he heard these absurd defences. "Oh yeah, I totally forgot, because it's so easy to say 'no' to a powerful dark wizard who could have killed him right on the spot. He could have saved himself the trouble of this, by getting himself killed, you mean. Hey, Draco, why didn't you just say 'no'? Hmm? You could have refused to kill our headmaster and let in the rest of the Death Eaters in turn for Voldemort, a crazed, sociopathic dark wizard, to kill you instead. I'm sorry Draco, but you could've just said 'no'. Your actions cannot be explained simply by saying 'to save your life'-"</p><p>"Mister Potter!" Kingsley Shacklebolt yelled, stopping Harry's rant. Harry looked up in shock to see the Minister glaring down at him, while the Wizengamont looked at him appalled at his sudden outburst. "You will be escorted out of this courtroom immediately until you can calm yourself enough to return and finish this trial. 30 minute break. Now get out, all of you!" The Minister said in his best authoritative voice. </p><p>An auror appeared at Harry's side immediately as two escorted the blond out in the opposite direction. Harry noticed he still had a shocked demeanour, probably at Harry's shouting. </p><p>As he exited the courtroom, Hermione and Ron rushed right too him, asking what happened, what all the shouting was about, if he was ok, what happened to Draco, and so on. </p><p>"Guys, guys, I'm fine. Draco-he's fine." Harry said, trying to calm his frantic friends. "I might have exploded on a few of the Wizengamont's wizards because they were making these absurd claims that Draco could have just said 'no' to Voldemort's commands. Yeah, he could've, and then gotten himself killed." Harry explained, starting out slowly,  gauging his friends' expressions, before raising his voice, anger coursing through him again as he thought of what had just happened.</p><p>"Harry, you yelled at the Wizengamont?! What were you thinking?! I knew I shouldn't have let you do that alone. You could've gotten yourself in so much trouble!" Hermione scolded. </p><p>"'Mione, its fine. Kingsley requested I step out for a minute to calm down, I guess." Harry replied, answering the unasked question. </p><p>"Good going mate. I'm with 'Mione on this one. That is not something you want to be doing in court." Ron said, placing a hand on Hermione's shoulder. "And since when has Malfoy become Draco?" Ron asked, looking at Harry with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>Harry ignored his question, looked down and ran a hand through his hair in a calming manner. "There's something else..." Of course, being Harry's best friends, both Hermione and Ron knew about the wolf characteristics passed down through Harry's lineage. They were there when he manifested into an Alpha fourth year. Confusion etched its way into Hermione and Ron's faces. Harry looked up to see their expressions as he explained what he discovered. "Draco's an Omega."</p>
