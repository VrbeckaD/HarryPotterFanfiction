<p>
  <em>Apollogia Alchymiae. Eudoxus. Nicolas Flammel. </em>
</p>
<p>While he’s here, waiting in the Manor library, Scorpius isn’t afraid.</p>
<p>Each volume tethers him, assuring him that things can stay the same. Picking out a volume at random, he browses the pages, stirring a faint scent of vellum, ink and history that is familiar and safe. Here, Scorpius could learn to live forever. Turn lead into gold. Become the finest wizard of his generation. </p>
<p>Scorpius knows his mum is going to die. </p>
<p>But here in their library, he can still pretend that he’s going to save her.</p></div>
