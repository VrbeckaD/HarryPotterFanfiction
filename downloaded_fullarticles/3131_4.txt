    <u>1. Theoretical Part: Overview over the Concept of the Personal Background</u>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">Any magic done by or on any witch or wizard according to official standard procedure may lead to good to very good results.  However, knowing the material, spiritual and magical backgrounds both of the magical agent (i.e. the witch or wizard performing the magic) and/or the magical recipient (i.e. the witch or wizard the magic is aimed at) will improve the results and may in fact, depending on the abilities of the witch or wizard performing the magic, lead to vastly superior results.  This holds true for all branches of magic, be it potions, charms, transfiguration, or any other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">A good example of this phenomenon can be found in the healing arts.  Any potion brewed to exacting standard by a qualified healer or a qualified potioneer will lead to standard grade O results.  However, if the brewer takes their personal background into account and accordingly tweaks the brewing process, the resulting potion will be much stronger and be graded O+, subgraded further according to the Kneale-Knox Scale of Potion Perfection.  Such potions are much more effective and come with less side effects, and the healing process will be much faster.  For this reason, for example, all trainee healers at St Mungo’s are required to research and classify their personal backgrounds to a high precision as an important part of their training programme (much more precisely than can be done within the scope of this homework).  All external potioneers supplying St. Mungo’s with ready-brewed potions are required to do the same.  The potions can be further refined according to the backgrounds of the patients they are used on.  With made-to-order potions the patient’s background will influence both the brewing process and the usage of the potions, with ready-made potions at least the usage will be influenced.  For this reason personal backgrounds are compiled for all incoming patients at St Mungo’s, though in most cases obviously to a much less detailed degree than those for the healers and potioneers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">Further examples concerning cases where both agent and recipient are witches or wizards are offensive and defensive spells in witching duels, for which reason usually a lot of preparation in advance of a pre-planned duel goes into researching the background of the opponent.  A famous case of this is Albus Dumbledore’s exhaustive research into Gellert Grindelwald in preparation for taking him on in a one-on-one duel to end Grindelwald’s reign of terror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">In cases where the recipient of a spell is an inanimate object the repercussions of the agent factoring in their personal background or not will mostly be much less serious, but the differences will be felt in any spell, up to and including basic house-holding spells.  The same goes for recipient-less, intransitive spells like apparating or flooing.  The risk of ending up on one’s behind is much lower to non-existent for those who truly know what they are doing as opposed to those who simply and unthinkingly go through the standard procedure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">A multitude of factors may influence one’s background and thus have to be researched for a thorough compilation of a personal background.  These include bodily traits like build (size, breadth, proportions, etc., i.e. tall or small, slender or stocky, etc.), mass (weight to height ratio), body tone, etc.; physiologic and neurologic traits (thinker vs. doer, visual, auditory or tactile type, etc.); and magical traits (wand preferences, choice of Hogwarts house, subject preferences, i.e. preferences for potions, charms, transfiguration or divination, etc.)  Each of these range of traits may be researched only roughly or to an infinitesimal degree – anybody buying their first wand at age eleven will remember being measured between the nostrils ...</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">The basis for any compilation of a personal background, though, is determining the geographical background of the individual in question, firstly their own and secondly that of their ancestors, with parents being the most important and importance decreasing with each generation.  The geographical background takes into account the geography and the geology of where a person grew up – in which part of the world, in which part of the country, and in which geological surroundings: on loam, on sand, on lime, on rock, in dry areas or wet, etc.  A person who grew up in Australia, no matter their ethnicity, will have a vastly different magical background to one who grew up on the British Isles, and a person who grew up in the chalk downs of Southern England will show marked differences to one who grew up in the marshlands of East Anglia.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">For the reasons outlined above, knowing their personal background is of utmost importance for any witch or wizard aspiring to any degree of magical competence, and at Hogwarts, factoring in personal backgrounds is an important part of any magical subject at NEWT level.  The first step to be learned by students is calculating the basic geographic background, known in its amalgamated form (individual geographic background plus influence of ancestors’ geographic backgrounds) as “family background”.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">
    <u>2. Practical Part: My Family Background</u><br/>
<u>2.1 The Family History</u>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">My father’s parents:</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">•  Grandpa Granger – A Hampshire man, roughly three quarters Anglo-Saxon, one quarter Celt.  His ancestors have lived and married in the City of Winchester area for centuries, with the exception of his paternal grandmother, who was Welsh.  Family rumour has it that his patrilineal great-grandmother (the mother-in-law of the Welsh grandmother) actually was not a local girl either, but an Australian with an English father and an Aborigine mother.  Her husband, my Great-great-great-grandpa Granger, would then have been the first of the so-called “restless” or “voyaging Grangers.”  I plan to follow up on this rumour after graduating from Hogwarts, but only once I’ve finished reforming the laws on the so-called “controlling” (i.e. oppressing) of magical creatures.</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">•  Grandma Granger, née Nǃaniu – a Khoisan (Juǀ'hoan) from north-western Botswana with a degree in English Literature, whom Grandpa Granger had met and fallen in love with while spending a summer vacation with a college friend’s family in Botswana (then still known as Bechuanaland).</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">My mother’s parents:</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">•  Grandpa Siebenhorn – A French colonial, who grew up in French North Africa.  His father was an Alsatian from Strasbourg with one colonial Indochinese grandmother, his mother was a Berber with caramel-brown hair and olive-green eyes.</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">•  Grandma Siebenhorn, née Dikôngô – A Mbenga (Aka) from northern French Congo (today’s Republic of Congo) with a touch of Bantu and a degree in engineering, whom Grandpa Siebenhorn had met and fallen in love with while working in French Equatorial Africa.  With the onset of decolonisation, the Siebenhorns moved to France, to the Loire Valley.</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">My mother studied dentistry and went to England for, as she thought, one semester.  There she met my father.  Given their astonishingly similar backgrounds, their sadly similar experiences with racist attitudes, and their shared love for Shakespeare, the two started seeing each other regularly and quickly formed a deep attachment.  The rest is history.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">(The outward appearance of my Berber great-grandmother may indicate that she had some Vandal ancestry, though possibly the generally lighter appearance of Berbers as opposed to Arabs may have their roots in the Berbers’ history long before the Vandals migrated to Africa from Central Europe.  Likewise the fact that both my sub-Saharan indigenous grandmothers were university educated already back in the 1950s may indicate some interesting family history which might have some influence on the family’s magical background.  Either of these highly interesting factors cannot be explored within the scope of this homework and has to be left to future research.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">This leads to the following percentages in my ancestry:</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">25% Khoisan ⇒ South Africa,</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">21.875% Mbenga ⇒ Central Africa,</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">18.75% English (or possibly 17.1875% English and 1.5625% Aborigine) ⇒ Hampshire, England (possibly also Australia),</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">12.5% Berber ⇒ North Africa,</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">6.25% Welsh ⇒ North Wales,</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">6.25% German-Alsatian ⇒ Alsace, France,</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">3.125% Bantu ⇒ Central Africa,</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">3.125% French(-Alsatian) ⇒ French, possibly but not necessarily from Alsace,</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">3.125% Indochinese ⇒ Indochina.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">For a further refining of this background (exceeding the scope of this homework), the exact geographic locations and their geology will have to be researched.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">
    <u>2.2 Calculating the Influence of the Family History on My Magical Background</u>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">As already explained in part 1, a witch’s or wizard’s geographical background is determined by where they grew up, and this geographical background is further influenced by the geographical backgrounds of all ancestors, though the influence decreases with each generation.  The sum of a witch’s or wizard’s geographical background together with all ancestral influences is known as a witch’s or wizard’s family background.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">The ancestral influence does not decrease linearly, though, but rather by the square of the generation’s Aranyani number.  The sequence of Aranyani numbers is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, etc.  The first two numbers of the sequence, 0 and 1, are the starting numbers.  The third number (the second 1) refers to the individual whose background is being determined, which within the frame of this homework is me, Hermione Granger.  The following numbers refer to the following generations, i.e. the 2 to the parents, the 3 to the grandparents, the 5 to the great-grandparents, and so on.  For the purpose of this homework, the generations will be calculated up to the great-great-great-grandparents (Aranyani number 13).</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">The formula for calculating the influence of the geographic background of each generation is </span><br/>
            <span class="font-serif">x = a% ÷ b²</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">with ‘x’ being the influence of an individual from a given generation in percent, ‘a’ the percentage that each individual contributes to their generation (50% for parents, 25% for grandparents, etc.), and ‘b’ the Aranyani number for that generation.  For the purpose of this homework, x is rounded to the third decimal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">For parents the formula thus reads:</span><br/>
            <span class="font-serif">x = 50% ÷ 2² = 50% ÷ 4 = 12.500%</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">Ditto for grandparents:</span><br/>
            <span class="font-serif">x = 25% ÷ 3² = 25% ÷ 9 = 2.778%</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">And for great-grandparents:</span><br/>
            <span class="font-serif">x = 12.5% ÷ 5² = 12.5% ÷ 25 = 0.500%</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">For great-great-grandparents:</span><br/>
            <span class="font-serif">x = 6.25% ÷ 8² = 6.25% ÷ 64 = 0.098%</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">For great-great-great-grandparents:</span><br/>
            <span class="font-serif">x = 3.125% ÷ 13² = 3.125% ÷ 169 = 0.018%</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">Applying these percentages to my family history as outlined in part 2.1 gives the following results:</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">{ Here follows a long list with the individual percentages given for each generation }</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">Adding up the individual results for each geographical area gives the following results for the influence the geographical backgrounds of my ancestors have on me:</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">16.680 % City of Winchester area, Hampshire, UK</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">12.500% Loire Valley, France</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">4.314% Botswana (Southern Africa)</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">4.314% Republic of Congo (Central Africa)</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">2.778% French North Africa (North Africa)</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">0.768% Strasbourg, Alsace, France</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">0.750% France</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">0.134% North Wales, UK</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">0.018% Indochina</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">Altogether, this adds up to 42.256%, which is the percentage of my known family background that is determined by my ancestors.  (If further generations were added, the total would approach, but never reach, 42.62%.)  To this, my own geographical background has to be added.  This can never be more than the sum of the influence of the known geographical backgrounds of my ancestors (Newdigate’s First Law of Magical Interaction of Geographical Backgrounds), i.e. also 42.256% as of now.  I turned 17 last month and I spent the first twelve years of my life in the City of Winchester area and the last five at Hogwarts.  My own geographical background thus at this point in time would add 29.828% City of Winchester area, UK, and 12.428% Hogwarts, Scotland, UK, to my family background.  In all, this leaves 15.488% of my family background undetermined.  This part cannot be determined (Newdigate’s Second Law of Magical Interaction of Geographical Backgrounds), and I will have to rely on my magical instincts to allow for these 15.488% in any magical action.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">As a last step, I have to figure in that I have not yet reached my magical maturity.  The influence of my ancestors’ geographical backgrounds is thus still larger than described above, and own geographical background is smaller.  Magical maturity is attained at 24 years of age.  As I am now 17, my magical maturity is only 70,833% of what it will come to be.  My own geographical background thus at this point in time is 29.166% smaller than the numbers given above, while the influence of my ancestors’ geographical backgrounds is 29.166% larger (Newdigate’s Third Law of Magical Interaction of Geographical Backgrounds).</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">
    <u>Thus, at this point in time my family background is: </u>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">42.673% City of Winchester area, Hampshire, UK</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">16.146% Loire Valley, France</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">8.803% Hogwarts, Scotland, UK</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">5.572% Botswana (Southern Africa)</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">5.572% Republic of Congo (Central Africa)</span><br/>
<span class="font-serif">3.588% French North Africa (North Africa)</span><br/>

<span class="font-serif">Hermione flopped down in one of the stuffed chairs by the common room fire, seething.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘All the work I put into this, and all the needed material is in there, and then he goes on about “superfluous material” and deducts a point because some of it isn’t in there twice!  Urgh, just who does he think he is!’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘It’s OK, Hermione, it’s done and over with,’ grumbled Ron, ‘there’s no need to go over it again!  And it was only ½ point, just be glad it <em>wasn’t</em> one or even more points!  And if all that stuff was superfluous there was no need to put it in there, I mean, please, Hermione, your great-grandmother’s eye colour!’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘It wasn’t superfluous, I explained that all that might point to further interesting details about my background, he simply ignored that!’ said Hermione, a thunderous expression on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘Yeah, well maybe you should have simply ignored that stuff, too,’ smirked Ron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">Hermione angrily opened her mouth, but Harry cut in.  ‘I overheard Malfoy gloating; he said he’d put in lots of stuff that might be of further interest that he’d freely invented, and he said Snape gave him extra points for it.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘Figures,’ replied Ron casually.  ‘That’s Snape for you, we’ve known him for five years now, what else would you expect?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">Hermione sighed.  ‘I guess I was a bit too relaxed in the wording of the family history ...’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">Ron sneered again, but before he could say something to further enrage Hermione, Harry quickly cut him off.  ‘That doesn’t sound like you, you know, too relaxed in your wording ...?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘It was the family thing,’ said Hermione, embarrassed.  ‘I didn’t know all this stuff, just the most basic things, that my mum is from the Loire Valley and that both my grandmothers grew up in Africa.  But all these details about Alsace and Wales and Australia, the Indochinese and the Berber ancestors, and where exactly my grandmothers came from, I didn’t know any of this till my parents and grandparents owled me all that information now.  It’s so fascinating!  So I got a bit carried away when I wrote about that ...’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘Which, knowing you, will never happen again,’ interrupted Ron.  ‘Speaking of which, what’s up next for homework?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘Some essay for Charms,’ said Harry and reached for his bag to look, but Hermione was quicker.  ‘Also a background topic and not directly subject-related: <i>“I like a healthy breeze round my privates, thank you” – Explain why tight clothing lowers the fertility of wizards and why it interferes with the magic of both wizards and witches, and describe the magical, biological and cultural aspects of these phenomena.</i>  Due on Monday.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">Ron groaned and covered his face with his hands.  ‘NEWT level is a horror!  I should have left directly after my OWLs and never returned!’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘And done what then?’ Hermione asked fondly.  ‘Stop grousing, you, we should go to the library and get started now!’</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘Game of chess?’ Ron asked Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span class="font-serif">‘Game of chess!’ Harry answered.<br/>
