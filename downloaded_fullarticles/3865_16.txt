    <p>Hermione Granger had done a lot in her lifetime.</p><p>Hell, she'd found Horcruxes, obliviated her parents' memories, been on the run, gotten tortured, helped defeat Voldemort - all before she'd ever left Hogwarts.</p><p>Now she worked in the Magical Creatures Department at the Ministry - well no, she <em>ran</em> the Magical Creatures Department. She'd held the position for well over four years and was incredibly skilled at her job, and getting others to be skilled at theirs'.</p><p>Hermione Granger had done a lot in her lifetime.</p><p>But this was certainly <em>not</em> something anyone would've expected of her.</p><p>"Oh my gods, please don't stop."</p><p>She had no idea how she'd ended up in this position, how <em>they'd</em> ended up in this position, but it really didn't seem to her like he minded.</p><p>She certainly didn't mind.</p><p>Which was strange, because unlike for him, this was entirely new to her - at least in action. Hermione was nothing if not a bookworm, and had certainly strayed to <em>more...deviant</em> of material on occasion. She was a grown woman - 25 for Merlin's sake - she was allowed to read whatever she pleased.</p><p>But reading was so, <em>so</em> much less enthralling than doing. She had read countless stories of women bold enough to allow a man to dominate them like this. Countless times she'd imagined what it would be like to <em>be</em> that woman. But all of that, <em>all of that,</em> paled so completely in comparison to actually feeling the soft silk of her bindings against her wrists, anchoring her completely to the posts of the headboard.</p><p>
  <em>His headboard.</em>
</p><p>She supposed that she really shouldn't be surprised that she was here. Years of failed relationships with men who never managed to please her sexually had her so tense it was a wonder she hadn't snapped already.</p><p>So, all things considered, could she really be <em>that</em> shocked at herself for accepting Malfoy's offer for a night of depravity?</p><p>"Please - <em>oh gods</em> - please don't stop." she begged, surprised that she couldn't quite recognize her voice in the moment. She sounded needy. <em>Desperate.</em></p><p>And it certainly seemed as though Malfoy was enjoying every minute of it.</p><p>His face was buried between her thighs, two fingers arching in a way that had her racing toward her orgasm.</p><p>She tugged at her bindings, wanting more than anything to be able to run her hands through his hair, "Please let me touch you."</p><p>Malfoy smirked against her dripping folds, lifting his head to look at her, all the while his fingers continued their steady pace.</p><p>"Now, now, Granger. Can't you see <em>I'm</em> doing the touching right now?"</p><p>She couldn't help but notice how her juices shone on his chin as he smirked at her, and the effect of his smoldering gray eyes matched with the constant stimulation his fingers gave her g-spot she found it hard to come up with a response that went beyond a breathy moan.</p><p>"Do you not enjoy what I'm doing?" he asked, slowing his fingers to tease her.</p><p>"I..." she shook her head, trying to move her hips away from him. The constant building pressure in her abdomen was becoming too much.</p><p>He used his free hand to smack the inside of her thigh, earning a surprised gasp from the brunette under him, "I asked you a question, Miss Granger."</p><p>"I don't remember what you asked." she admitted, her eyes falling shut as he continued slowly teasing her.</p><p>Two fingers pumped into her dripping pussy, while his thumb stroked her clit in light circles. His other hand still rested on the thigh he'd just smacked, fingers lightly trailing the slightly pinker skin there.</p><p>"Are you enjoying yourself, pet?"</p><p>Under any other circumstance she would've slapped Malfoy across the face for the name, but she couldn't deny the clench in her stomach at his words, particularly with what he was doing to her body.</p><p>"Yes," she moaned, her body writhing under his ministrations. "Please, please...I'm so close..."</p><p>"Please what?" he asked with a smirk, leaning back down so she could feel his breath ghosting across her now neglected clit.</p><p>She groaned in frustration, trying to ride his fingers to find her release, but not succeeding.</p><p>"I'll give you anything you want, Granger, all you have to do is ask." he murmured, placing a soft kiss to her clit.</p><p>His words made her stomach tighten even more as she warred with herself.</p><p>"I...want you to taste me." she said, finally giving in to Malfoy and all the deliciously twisted things he could possibly do to her.</p><p>He smirked, but made no further comment, instead obliging her request in earnest. He ate her like a man starved, both hands now holding her thighs open as he attacked her clit with fervor.</p><p>"Oh..my gods..." moaned Hermione, her back arching and thighs shaking as she came undone.</p><p>"Did your Weasel ever make you feel like this?" he asked, continuing to lightly stroke his thumb across her clit - which had her writhing underneath him again.</p><p>"Malfoy, I can't." she said shaking her head, "Please,<em> oh fuck</em> -"</p><p>"Answer me." he said, his thumb continuing its slow circling.</p><p>"No, he never made me feel like you do." she panted, tugging at the restraints again as she groaned.</p><p>"Good," he said with a smirk, moving to kneel between her legs, slowly dragging his nails across the smooth skin of her inner thighs.</p><p>"Please let me touch you." she panted, squirming as he slid his dick against her clit.</p><p>He smirked, his eyes catching hers, "I don't think so, Granger. I quite like you like this."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut as he continued slowly sliding against her clit and fuck everything if she didn't look perfect in the moment.</p><p>"Because your skin flushes beautifully when you're out of your comfort zone, <em>Hermione."</em></p><p>Her eyes widened, "That's the first time you -"</p><p>But she didn't get to finish her thought, because Malfoy was slowly easing his way into her tight, wet heat.</p><p>"<em>Fuck</em>...you feel perfect." he murmured, lips pressed against her neck, kissing, biting, and licking any part of her his hungry mouth could reach.</p><p>Hermione couldn't do much more than moan as he filled her, stretched her, so completely.</p><p>Once he was seated to the hilt - and Hermione <em>utterly</em> full - he dropped to his forearms and began moving at a quicker pace.</p><p>"I bet your Weasel never fucked you like this." he murmured against her ear, the gravelly tone of his voice only adding to the heat building between her thighs.</p><p>"No," she panted, using his close proximity to her advantage as she bit into the corded muscles of his shoulder, "He would never."</p><p>He growled, snapping his hips against her on a particularly hard thrust that had her seeing spots.</p><p>"I would've fucked you like this every goddamn day." he said, pressing heated kisses and love bites across her neck, his steady thrusting never faltering.</p><p>She bit her lip at his words, her legs winding around his waist to slightly change their angle. "Why?"</p><p>He smirked, his molten silver eyes meeting hers as he said, "I couldn't imagine not feeling your tight little cunt wrapped around me. There are so many things I want to do to you, pet."</p><p>Her breath hitched and he could feel her walls beginning to flutter around him, and knew that she was close. He dropped his head back to her neck, sucking the delicate skin there before whispering, "You feel so fucking brilliant."</p><p>As he'd expected his words sent her over the edge, her pussy clenching his cock as he continued to thrust through her orgasm. His teeth were clenched and his body tense, practically forcing himself not to hurtle right over the edge with her.</p><p>He was nowhere near done with her.</p><p>Once she came down from her high he pulled out of her, earning him a groan of displeasure from the witch below him.</p><p>He smirked, meeting her eyes before gripping her hips and flipping her over. Her arms were now crossed as she rested on her forearms, her ass in the air on full display for the former Slytherin behind her.</p><p>"Your arse is bloody <em>perfect,</em> Granger." he groaned, both hands moving to her ass, firmly squeezing and kneading both cheeks, "Do you like when I touch you like this, pet?"</p><p>She couldn't stop the moan that passed her lips as she squirmed under Malfoy's attentions.</p><p>Suddenly there was a sharp smack to her bum, tearing an even louder moan from the brunette witch, "Malfoy! Did you just...<em>spank</em> me?"</p><p>Though she couldn't see his face, she would've bet that he was smirking, and when he spoke she could almost swore she heard it.</p><p>"I did. You don't seem to mind." He trailed one hand down between her thighs to find her dripping, "Besides," he said, dipping two fingers into her wet heat, "I asked you a question."</p><p>He slowly worked his fingers inside her, knowing the perfect spots to hit to have her grinding back against his hand, his other still firmly planted on her ass cheek, kneading the smooth flesh.</p><p>"I like all the ways you've touched me, Malfoy. You know that."</p><p>"True." he said with a smirk, "But I do love hearing you say it."</p><p>He brought his hand down on her ass again, and felt her clench around his fingers. It satisfied him to no end that she was enjoying this. Enjoying him. Salazar knew he'd wanted her for ages.</p><p>"I think you like it quite a bit, pet." he said, taking note of how much more wet she'd become from his ministrations. "Naughty, naughty...enjoying my fingers in your wet cunt while your arse is on perfect display for me."</p><p>He smacked her ass again, earning him the loudest moan yet.</p><p>"You...<em>gods</em>, Malfoy you're too good at this."</p><p>He smirked, removing his fingers from her as he said, "No such thing as too good, Granger."</p><p>He didn't wait for a response, instead choosing to thrust forward into her wet heat, his action tearing a moan from her as her fingers gripped the posts she was bound to. The position had Malfoy hitting her g-spot with every stroke, and it was almost too much.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>He wasted no time setting a pace that had her teetering on the edge within minutes. He was sure she'd have the imprint of his fingers on her hips for quite some time. In fact, he hoped she would.</p><p>"Fuck...tell me you love this as much as I do. Tell me you want to do this again." he murmured, his chest pressed against her back as he pressed hungry kisses to her neck and shoulders.</p><p>His confession had her clenching around him, breathlessly moaning the one word he'd wanted to hear all night, "<em>Draco</em>,"</p><p>"Fuck," he murmured, biting her shoulder before flicking his hand at her bindings, instantly releasing her. Using her new mobility to his advantage, he slid a hand to her stomach, pulling her up flush against himself.</p><p>She moaned at the new angle, still feeling the spasms of the orgasm that just ripped through her as he continued his pace. The hand that had been on her stomach moved up to toy with her breasts, pinching and tweaking her nipples in a delectably naughty way.</p><p>She wove one arm around his neck to help keep her balance, while her free hand dug into his hip. She couldn't resist the urge to drop her head back onto his shoulder, her eyes fluttering shut as he kissed and licked her neck.</p><p>"I'm close, pet, and I'd rather enjoy if you came with me." he murmured against her ear, nipping the lobe before sliding the hand at her waist down to toy with her clit. She immediately moaned - a rather lovely sound, he had to admit - as she turned her face to capture his lips in a kiss.</p><p>She pulled away from the kiss, unable to catch her breath as Malfoy continued to take her higher and higher, the coil in her abdomen incredibly tight.</p><p>"I...oh gods..."</p><p>"Say my name again." he murmured against her neck, speeding up his fingers on her clit. "I fucking love hearing you say it."</p><p>"Draco," she whispered, taken back a bit by his request, but turned on none the less, "Please, I'm so close, Draco."</p><p>He growled, the last of his restraint snapping as he pounded into her, throwing both of them over the edge in seconds.</p><p>"Bloody hell, Granger," he murmured, his hands trailing over her body lightly, not quite ready to let her go.</p><p>She chuckled, though it was rather breathy, "Ditto,"</p><p>She moved first, flopping forward onto his mattress with a satisfied sigh, her head resting on her arms. He moved next to her, on his back instead, and turned his head to look at her.</p><p>"Did you enjoy the depravity, Granger?"</p><p>Her toffee eyes stared back at him, a smirk on her face as she replied, "More than I'd like to admit, <em>Draco</em>."</p><p>His eyes flashed dangerously as he smiled at her - much the way wolves must smile at their prey, she thinks - and asked, "Are you teasing me?"</p><p>"Depends on what it gets me." she shot back.</p><p>He smirked, trailing a hand down the slightly sweat-slicked skin of her back, stopping when he reached her ass - a most delectable ass, he thought. He squeezed one firm cheek, causing Hermione to moan at the contact against her sensitive skin.</p><p>"It'll certainly get you tied up and <em>thoroughly</em> fucked, Hermione...That is," he said, moving her hair so he could place soft kisses against her back and shoulders, "If you intend to continue indulging."</p><p>Her breath hitched at his soft ministrations, and though everything in her mind was screaming at her not to indulge in this any further, she couldn't deny her attraction to the blonde wizard.</p><p>Gathering her courage she flipped over to her back, face to face with Draco Malfoy's unbelievably striking silver eyes.</p><p>"Would you like it if I did?"</p><p>"I seem to recall saying there were plenty of things I wanted to do to your body, Granger." he said with a devilishly handsome smirk.</p><p>"Well I hope to indulge in all of them."</p>
