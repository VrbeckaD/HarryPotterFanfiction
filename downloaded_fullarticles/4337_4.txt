    <p>Loki moved through the falling Midgardian craft with sense of satisfaction. Everything was going to plan, as of now that green beast is wreaking havoc on his own companions, the only complication was that ignorant little human that dared to believe he could stand in his way.Now all he needed to do was to get off this piece of junk and activate his army,</p><p>With this failure he hopes the message sunk in,It matters not what group of 'heroes' you send to try and stop him, they all will soon crash and burn. Loki couldn't stop the smirk from forming on his face, this was it soon Thor's precious little planet will be in ruin and under his utmost control.</p><p>Loki might not have been as strong, or as brave, or as bold as his brother, but there was no denying he was smarter. And he was smarter than his not-father too, and for that matter his real father as well. They were so easy to trick and to manipulate and humiliate.</p><p>They were, all of them, beneath him, so stupid and sentimental. They had believed him when he had whispered sweet words of forgiveness all those years ago, though he would never, could never forgive his not-brother for the sin he committed onto him. Nor the mighty All-Father,   his not-father could have halted the events that lead to his utmost conquering pain. At any time he desired he could have stopped Him and Thor but he’d chosen not to. He had to make a point. And he got it, Odin’s manipulations opened his eyes, his whole existence was to cater to his golden child. And that he will never allow, before he would have settled for the crown, but after learning the truth of his parentage- He cares not for such meager results, All will pay for the lies, pain and suffering he had to endure. He would never forgive. </p><p>His brother  will fall, he will not kill him, No, his beloved planet and all his new lover, 'friends' will all die.He will cast that adrenaline charged moron into a worst misery than the most wretched parts of Hel, then he will take on Asgard. Thinking of his former brother made him remember his earlier words.</p><p>Mother. Are you truly unwell.  No, he will not do this.</p><p>She is not His Mother, she lied to him just like all the rest. The Queen will be fine, in a few decades she will  be over his novelty and move on with her life. What matters is his revenge, he will accept nothing but the Golden boy's complete despair, he will not stop in till they both bow before him.</p><p> So deep in his reflection he almost missed the raging hammer being thrown at him, there standing at his right was the God of lighting himself. He re-summoned his hammer and held it out, ready to strike.</p><p> He tighten his grasp on his Scepter. Ahh so it begins</p>
