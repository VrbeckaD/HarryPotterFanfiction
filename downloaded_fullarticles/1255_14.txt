    <hr/><p> </p><p align="justify">Lily Evans prided herself on being a good student. </p><p> </p><p>She had good grades and did her homework, even the one given by Professor Flitwick who <em> never </em> checked if they'd done it. She had a stellar attendance and was always punctual and respectful. Even Professor McGonagall liked her, and it was the general consensus among the entire student body that having her like you was really, <em> really </em>hard. </p><p> </p><p>However, Lily didn't think that Mcgonagall would continue to like her if she stabbed James Potter in her class. </p><p> </p><p>With a rounder. In his neck. </p><p> </p><p>Because unfortunately Professor McGonagall even liked him, probably more than she liked her, which was a source of constant befuddlement for Lily. It was also a source of a lot of her rants to Mary, who claimed she was just jealous of Potter getting McGonagall's respect.</p><p> </p><p>But Mary had no idea what she was talking about. </p><p> </p><p>Lily was <em> not </em>jealous. She just didn't know why McGonagall liked that stupid bull-headed idiot. Okay so it might be because Potter was the best at her subject loathe as she did to admit it (who needed statistics anyway) . She might begrudgingly even admit that he was almost as good as her in other subjects. </p><p> </p><p><em> Almost </em>.</p><p> </p><p>And <em> that </em>was where her problem with him lied. She would never admit it to anyone else, but the fact that he was so good at everything even without trying was the thing which bugged her the most. </p><p> </p><p>Here she was making organizers and taking colour coordinated notes and doing all of her work perfectly, while he waltzed in with his last minute assignments tousling his hair seemingly without a care in the world and scored great marks.</p><p> </p><p>Not as good as her though, obviously. If he did, she might just throw a fit, no matter how unseemly it would be for a college student to do so. It wouldn't matter if she did anyway. The football kids already looked down on her because they thought being president of the debate club somehow involved less skill than kicking a ball around a field. The rich kids looked down on her because she was here on scholarship. This was the only thing in which they <em> had </em>to accept she was superior to them.</p><p> </p><p> Guess who fell in both of those categories?</p><p> </p><p>James Fucking Potter</p><p> </p><p>Okay, so maybe she didn't know that James looked down on her, but all the other sporty rich kids did so she didn't see what was wrong with that assumption. After all, we <em> did </em>have to assume the new data points fit in the general trend. It wasn't baseless. The probability was that he too would feel the same. </p><p> </p><p>(Ha! See Potter, she could do statistics too)</p><p> </p><p>And secondly, maybe she didn't exactly know that his middle name was 'Fucking', but she saw his name on his assignment sheet, which she wasn't peeking at to see his marks. She couldn't care less what his marks were, no matter what Mary said. But when she <em> just happened </em> to glance at his assignment sheet, she saw that it said James.F.Potter, and it was a fun game to think of increasingly embarrassing names beginning from F. However there was only one which she could have settled on considering how annoying he was.</p><p> </p><p>A clap brought her back to the classroom.</p><p> </p><p>"And now class, we will be splitting the class into pairs for your new project which you will have to submit by the end of the semester." </p><p> </p><p>What? </p><p> </p><p>She was seriously regretting zoning out right now. </p><p> </p><p>Potter and his mates looked at each other and grinned which McGonagall saw much to Lily's joy and added, "The groups will be made randomly of course"</p><p> </p><p>The smiles fell off their faces.</p><p> </p><p>"Everyone will pick up chits while leaving the class, on which there will be a number. The people with the same number will be grouped together."</p><p> </p><p>That sounded fair. More importantly, it made Potter miserable, which in turn made her happy.</p><p> </p><p>McGonagall placed a box on the table and everyone went and picked up a chit. When Lily's turn came she went up, and then walked up to Mary, Marlene and Dorcas who were standing just outside the class waiting for her. </p><p> </p><p>"So, what did you get?" asked Mary, sounding impatient. "I got 4 and Marlene and Dorcas are both 1" <em> Huh. </em>Good for them. It would be nice working with your girlfriend. </p><p> </p><p>Lily opened hers, and turned to Mary, "Well, mine's a 7, so we won't be working together, unfortunately." </p><p> </p><p>She was being sincere. Mary was a fun partner to work with. Easy going and punctual with her work. Their last semester calculus project had been a breeze. </p><p> </p><p>She wondered who she would be partnered with. She really hoped it wasn't McLaggen. He was a real pain to talk to. Always subtly hitting on her. There was only so much playing dumb her ego could take. There was only one person that would be worse than McLaggen.</p><p> </p><p>"Oi Prongs! What number have you got?" </p><p> </p><p>"Seven"</p><p> </p><p>And with that one word Lily could feel her world crashing around her and she just knew in her bones that this semester was going to be the absolute death of her.</p><p>James <em> Fucking </em> Potter indeed.</p>
