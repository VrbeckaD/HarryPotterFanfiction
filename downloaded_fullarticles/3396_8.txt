    <p>Far far away, in the biggest alternative universe of all the alternative universes, was an enormous castle which worked as a school. Magic school, to be correct. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, to be the most correct. This was an excellent place with the best safety provided to anyone who ever stepped on the Hogwarts floor. It became home for loads of students, no matter if they still were going there. And since Harry Potter destroyed Lord Voldemort and magic world experienced the piece again, the situation got calmed a bit. But… for how long?</p><p>     “JACK!”</p><p>     A terrifying shriek filled the school corridor near Slytherin common room just a minute before a young lady with extremely long golden hair appeared in the doorway. Although she had big green eyes and a cute face at all, right now every student rather stepped back as they knew that it’s not the best time to get her angry. Or, more angry.</p><p>     Rapunzel Corona’s face was as red as it could be when she entered the Slytherin common room. No one asked her how she did it, if she went there with some Slytherin students or what as she was a Ravenclaw, but this wasn’t the right time too.</p><p>     A groan came from the boy’s dormitory. “I love this alarm clock. Really.”</p><p>     “I’m hell serious!” Rapunzel made her way through Slytherin students, who looked at her a bit alarmed, but they didn’t manage to keep her away from the doors. “Wake up, you freak! You’re going to explain it to me, right now!”</p><p>     The Slytherins were too astonished – maybe because of surprise, maybe because of fear, or the most probably, maybe because they wanted to know how this dialogue is going to continue – to notice another two students entering their common room.</p><p>     “Calm down, Rapunzel,” said a little redhead girl, accompanied by a brown-haired boy with a noticeable artificial limb. Hiccup was usually the calmest member of their group – called The Big Four, just because it was four of them and they weren’t able to agree on anything else – so it was his turn again, but Jack was quicker.</p><p>     “Those are hormones,” he stated. “It’ll be okay within few minutes.”</p><p>     “WHAT HORMONES?!!!”</p><p>     “I wouldn’t say that it’ll be okay,” Hiccup frowned frustrated. Well, sometimes he wasn’t very sure what he’s doing in presence of those people.</p><p>     But this time it was Merida who stayed calm. “You know ‘er, she must rage enough. Good luck, Jack. See ya at the breakfast – or if yer goin’ to appear there.”</p><p>     “Merida -!”</p><p>     “Can somebody explain me why are all of you in our common room?” Slytherins finally managed to find their more capable friends and brought Albus Potter. Although he was in the first year – at all, like the whole Big Four – everybody relayed on him. “Slytherin, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw at once? Furthermore, oughtn’t you to be at the breakfast? Andy why are you screaming so much?”</p><p>     “Too many questions,” Merida shrugged and turned back to doors. “Hurry up, Hicc, I don’t wanna more problems with Slytherins, and Jack’ll catch up later.”</p><p>     Albus opened his mouth but wasn’t able to say a single word. Merida smiled at him as she made his way around him towards the doors. Hiccup quickly followed her.</p><p>     “Don’t call me Hicc,” he said. Merida laughed.</p><p>     “That’s the first thing yeh tell me? C’mon, it’s not that bad.”</p><p>     “It will be bad if you don’t calm yourselves down!” They both stunned as they heard a strong voice of Professor McGonagall. She appeared in the corridor wearing her typical dresses and looking furious, similar face to Rapunzel’s. “Slytherins called Professor Malfoy that there’s a mess in their common room, and unfortunately for you he wasn’t there, so that’s why you see me. Now explain me why <em>I</em> see <em>you</em>.”</p><p>     “Ahem, because we’re not invisible–” Merida started, but Hiccup got his chance this time and responded by himself.</p><p>     “We tried to stop it, Professor, but she was faster and managed it to their com–”</p><p>     But Professor McGonagall didn’t seem like she was actually interested in what he was trying to say. “Quickly to your common rooms or to Great Hall, or I’m going to take 10 points from Gryffindor!”</p><p>     Hiccup frowned. “But I’m from Hufflepuff–”</p><p>     “QUICKLY!”</p><p>     And from that time, Hogwarts knew that there wouldn’t be any more rest for next seven years.</p>
