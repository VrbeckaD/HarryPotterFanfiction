    <p>
  <span>Severus didn’t understand James Potter sometimes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sure he knew the boy didn’t like him at all, for a reason that not even Severus knew. But what he didn’t understand was why the twelve year old boy was so fixated on making his life a living hell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knew it wasn’t because he was a poor, ugly kid from Spinner’s End. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Marauders had always bullied the weaker students at Hogwarts, which Sev had to begrudgingly admit he was a part of, but they didn’t bother them nearly as much as they bothered him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus couldn’t even breath in a room without Potter making a snappish comment about his looks or lack of wealth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He just didn’t understand why.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their first impression of each other wasn’t anything amazing but it wasn’t horrible either so the Slytherin didn’t understand what separated him from the other kids Potter bullied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter was always so desperate to get a rise out him that Severus had to applaud his tenacity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But even for a twelve year old boy, Sev was surprised at the Gryffindor’s persistence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus hated stopping down to Potter’s level but the Gryffindor knew how to push his buttons well enough that Sev would retaliate and get into petty arguments with him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was dangerous to leave the two of them in the same place for too long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter was ruthless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus had to admit there were nights he cried himself to sleep because of Potter’s words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But there was something Sev noticed whenever they fought. Potter never looked upset at him but was always smirking instead as if he was satisfied by Sev’s actions</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was then Severus realized the real intent behind Potter’s actions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy had simply enjoyed seeing the boy enraged and always attempted saying things that he knew would trigger Sev’s flight or fight response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In a lack of better words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter wanted his attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus didn’t understand why exactly, he wasn’t interesting in the slightest as a half-blood Slytherin that grew up in the poor part of his town.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Why did Potter sought to grab his attention? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What did he gain out of that?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus didn’t know but he decided to try a new tactic instead. He would try and ignore Potter instead, hopefully the boy would get the hint and leave him alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knew it was a long shot but Severus would do anything to get Potter to leave him alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Surely it would work, right?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It turns out that in fact ignoring Potter did not work at all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus blinked back tears as he ran back to the Slytherin, feeling thoroughly humiliated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had managed to avoid Potter and his goons (Remus, Sirius, and Peter) until the Gryffindor hexed him making in the middle of the Great Hall making a comment about how the Slytherin was probably used to this treatment because of his father. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now that struck a nerve. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter made hurtful comments all the time but they never involved his father. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His asshole, abusive piece of shit of a father who treated his mother like absolute trash and was the reason she was so skittish.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The reason why Severus hated the thought of going home. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus ran until he reached the Slytherin common room allowing himself to cry, the hurt and humiliation evident.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a few minutes, Severus felt a hand on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Slytherin tensed and quickly turned to spot Lily giving him a look of sadness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sev…” she whispered as she pulled her best friend into a tight hug feeling her heart ache as he cried into her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They stayed like that for awhile until Sev’s cries were reduced to sniffles before they parted and Lily pulled him into the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They stayed silent for a couple of moments, both uneasy to acknowledge the elephant in the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...How’d you get into the Slytherin common room?” Sev managed to ask.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily blinked and sighed to herself. “Threatened one of the Slytherins to give me the password.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus sniffed as a look of surprise came over him. “What’d you say?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily groaned. “That I’d threaten to petrify him and drag him to the Forbidden Forest if he didn’t give me the password right this second.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s harsh, even for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily snorted. “You’re my best friend, Sev. I’m supposed to be harsh when it comes to these things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh.” was all Severus managed to say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily merely nodded as the room turned airing yet again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lily I-“ the Slytherin started.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But Lily cut him off. “I hope you know that I immediately slapped Potter once he said that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus looked down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily looked enraged as she continued. “What gives him the right to say that kind of stuff to you. He doesn’t know your life so he should butt out!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus tried to intervene but there was no stopping Lily Evans when she was in the middle of a rant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For Merlin’s sake the next time I see his bloody face I’ll-“ Lily exclaimed but cut herself off when she noticed the somber look on her best friend’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sev?” she murmured, placing a delicate hand on his cheek. “I’m really sorry that this happened.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought…” Sev mumbled, “I thought ignoring him would make him leave me alone. Instead he chooses to humiliate in front of everyone and talk about...him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Severus…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I hate him! I hate him so much, Lily!” Severus exclaimed angrily as he clenched his fists, “I don’t even understand why he likes to torment me so much! I haven’t done anything for Merlin’s sake!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily eyes softened. “How do you mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus covered his face with his hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s-Hes always bothering me for some reason! I get it I’m a poor, greasy-haired Slytherin but for some reason he always wants to fuck with me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily sat there silently for a few moments, before her eyes widened as if she had realized something. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stayed silent for a few minutes. “There’s a reason why, Sev.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus turned to her. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily gave her friend a sad look. “It might be because he’s in love with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus’ eyes widened and looked at Lily as if she had grown three heads. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shrugged slightly and looked at the Slytherin directly in the eye. “It makes sense, doesn’t he? All the teasing, constantly trying to grab your attention, trying to rile you up. And for Merlin’s sake he’s a 12 year old boy who doesn’t know go navigate his feelings properly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus laughed, but it was empty. “That’s not funny, Lily.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily winced. “Sev please. You can’t deny it. He’s always looking at you during classes and-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Slytherin cut her off. “Stop Lily.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sev please-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Get out…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily’s eyes widened. “Sev-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“GET OUT!” he shouted at her, feeling anger pulse through him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily wordlessly got up and quickly left the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus screamed out in pain and sorrow as he felt more tears gather up in his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It didn’t matter if James Potter loved him or not. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Because that was the day Severus Snape decided he truly loathed the boy.</span>
