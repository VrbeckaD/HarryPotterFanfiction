    <p>Later Sirius would accept that he was mostly at fault for what just happened but at the moment he was cursing his family for not labeling shit better, the Ministry for putting him in a position where he was required to even be in this vault, and the goblins for not keeping the vault organized. “Hey, Remus I found a ring I think might be nearly perfect except for one small issue.”</p>
<p>Remus turned around, curious to see why Sirius sounded slightly off. When he was greeted by a seventeen year younger version of his best friend he doubled over laughing. </p>
<p>“Yes, very funny,” Sirius grumbled, annoyed at his own stupidity putting him in this position. “You read the family grimoire before we came in here, was there a spell to re-age me by any chance?”</p>
<p>All Remus could do was shake his head no, afraid that if he spoke he would start laughing again. </p>
<p>Sirius tucked the ring back in its box and chucked it at Remus, half hoping it would bounce off his head. “Well, at the very least, that needs decursed before I can give it to Hermione.”</p>
<p>Catching the box that Sirius had chucked at him Remus pried it open to look at the ring, being very careful not to touch it so he didn’t end up in the same position as Sirius. “Well this is definitely a perfect ring for Hermione, and it's probably the smallest stone we are going to find in this room.” Remus agreed as he studied the gold filigree band with a moderate-sized sapphire in the middle surrounded by a halo of diamond chips.</p>
<p>“Can you check it for curses please before I give it to Hermione?” Sirius asked as he started working his way out of the piles of heirlooms and antiques towards Remus. “In hindsight, the twenty-one on the box is an indicator of the age it will make you, it was probably used for second marriages to make the husband closer to his bride's age. I don’t think anything else would be on it but I’d rather be safe than sorry.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded and fished his wand out of his pocket to cast a few diagnostic spells on the ring and then a spell to remove the age curse, using information he had gathered from the grimoire Sirius had let him look through to make sure he had everything. “Alright, you should be good now. Though for your own well being I wouldn’t recommend telling Hermione that this was the ring that cursed you.” He said with a chuckle, he hoped he would be present to see Hermione's reaction to the fact that her Ministry chosen husband was now twenty-one despite being thirty-seven when he had left Grimmauld Place that morning.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that would probably be smart, thanks Moony.” Sirius agreed as he took the box and tucked it in his pocket. “Should we head back now or do you want to start organizing this mess?”</p>
<p>“Trying to avoid your bride to be?” Remus teased with a chuckle. “Let’s head back to Grimmauld, you can work on this mess later. Or turn Hermione loose on it, she’d probably enjoy an organizing project this big.”</p>
<p>Realizing Remus was again right on multiple counts, Sirius sighed and nodded his agreement. He couldn’t actually avoid what was about to happen forever since the Ministry had enacted a marriage law that meant he had to marry Hermione but that didn’t mean he was looking forward to explaining to her that he was an idiot. “Right then, let's go get this over with. And if you pull out popcorn I will hex you into next week.” Sirius threatened with a glare, remembering the many time's popcorn had come out when James had to tell Lily he had fucked up again.</p>
<p>“I make no promises, this tops any of the things James did. And that includes losing Harry by wrapping him in the invisibility cloak when he was a baby.” Remus smirked, following Sirius out to the waiting cart.</p>
<p>One very windy cart ride and a quick appration later the pair were standing on the steps of Grimmauld Place. With a final warning glare at Remus and a steadying breath Sirius pushed open the door and headed for the library where Hermione had been spending her days while she decided what to do now that her NEWTs were done.</p>
<p>Despite all his teasing and his desire to see the fall out Remus made his way to the kitchen, knowing Sirius needed privacy to talk to Hermione after the letter they had received this morning that had sent them running to Gringotts as soon as it opened to find a ring so he could at least try and do right by the young witch he was being forced to marry.</p>
<p>Upstairs Sirius knocked on the doorframe to get Hermione’s attention before entering the room so he didn’t startle her. “Hermione? Can I speak with you please?”</p>
<p>“Of course Sirius,” Hermione replied tucking a slip of parchment in the book she was reading so she didn’t lose her place then setting it aside. “Sirius?! What happened?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I accidentally touched a cursed heirloom in the family vault this morning.” Sirius tried to make it seem like he was less of an idiot than he actually was as he took a seat next to Hermione on the couch. “I wanted to talk to you about the letters we received from the Ministry this morning.”</p>
<p>Hermione's face tensed and she nodded, “I was just reading up on the history of laws like this. It seems like this isn’t the first time the Ministry has felt the need to encourage marriage and new children after something happens that decrease the population. The last time a law like this was enacted was surprisingly recent, the Ministry put it into place after the Spanish flu took a massive toll on muggle and wizarding Britain alike.”</p>
<p>“I should have known you’d go straight to the research,” Sirius chuckled fondly. “So you’re alright with this?”</p>
<p>“In time I will be, I just need to wrap my head around it first.” Hermione said with a shrug, did she want to get married less than two months after Ron had dumped her in such a public way that it wound up on the front page of the Prophet? No. But did she want to lose the world she had fought so hard for or wind up in Azkaban for refusing this law? Also no. So between her two choices marrying Sirius really was the better option. “Though you suddenly changing age on me does add an interesting element to this whole mess.”</p>
<p>Sirius grinned sheepishly; in some ways him being physically closer to Hermione’s age was a blessing, at least he would get to redo his twenties properly instead of spending them in Azkaban. But at the same time, it was awkward suddenly being seventeen years younger and having to explain to everyone how that happened. “Oh before I forget, I have something for you. I was looking for it when this happened.” Sirius said with a wry grin as he pointed to himself before sliding off the couch to kneel in front of Hermione. “Hermione Jean Granger, will you do me the honor of becoming Lady Black and using my Wizengamot seat to make the stodgy old farts running the government come into at least the current century?”</p>
<p>“Yes Sirius, I will happily marry you,” Hermione agreed with a fond smile. Maybe, just maybe, this wouldn’t be as bad as it had seemed when she had first read the letter from the Ministry this morning.</p>
<p>Sirius grinned, nearly lighting up the entire room with his smile before he slipped the sapphire ring he and Remus had pulled from the vault on Hermione's finger. “Don’t worry, Remus checked this one for curses.”</p>
<p>Laughing Hermione leaned forward and pulled Sirius into a hug, one way or another she was suddenly feeling a lot more sure that this would work out for the best.</p>
