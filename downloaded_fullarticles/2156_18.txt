          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story begins in Hannah Abbott's dormitory, she's getting to know her new friend the memory ghost of Tom Riddle.</p><p>Hannah said, "Can I ask you something personal, Tom?"</p><p>Tom insisted, "You may."</p><p>Hannah inquired, "What was it like when you died?"</p><p>Tom frowned. "It's difficult for me to describe the feeling when Harry Potter stabbed the diary with a basilisk fang. It felt excruciatingly painful, but then I felt sort of light and happy. Almost as if all of my Earthly problems had vanished. When I stepped out of my own body in this form, I felt somewhat relieved because nothing could ever hurt me now."</p><p>Hannah wiped a tear away and smiled. "Well, I'm glad that Harry Potter killed you."</p><p>Tom smirked. "You are?"</p><p>Hannah nodded and grinned. "Think about it, if Harry hadn't killed you; then we wouldn't have met each other."</p><p>Tom beamed, "You're right, Hannah. This right here, you and I feels better than anything I ever felt when I was alive. I'm glad I was killed because it led to our meeting and you're the prettiest and funniest girl I've ever met."</p><p>Hannah blushed. "You're not so bad yourself."</p></div>
