    <p>"My family will be coming to visit you Tsuna-kun," Skull said.</p><p>Tsuna sat on his bed with a manga book, while a teenaged Skull sat cross-legged on the floor with a car magazine. Ever since the cursed Arcobaleno reverted to their original ages, Skull's been hanging around Tsuna more often. Tsuna didn’t mind because the stuntman was better company than Reborn any day.</p><p>"Really, why?" Tsuna asked.</p><p>"Well, Draco wants to formally thank you for breaking my curse." Skull began. "Ron wants to punch Reborn in the face and thank you for breaking the curse, Hermione wants to thank you and do mysterious experiments on Verde." Skull smiled at Tsuna’s wide-eyed look as he continued.</p><p>"Neville wants to trap Colonnello in a greenhouse of experimental crossbred plants and thank you too, while Luna, Fred, and George will most likely just cause mischief and generally make people uncomfortable."</p><p>"I see." Tsuna sighed. He felt faint, but at least he was getting a warning before people showed up to trample on his plans.</p><p>"Then there’s the D.A, who are hoping I'll take up command again, they will most likely try to convince me to retake my position in the Military force. My cousin Bella, insane bitch that she is, has been attempting to make amends in our Family relationship since my adopted Mother beat her in a duel. Then there's my son Edward who feels you deserve a medal for breaking my curse, as do my Godchildren so they may make a medal just for you of the highest honor."</p><p>Tsuna didn't even pretend he was still reading his book. Skull had invited what seemed to be an entire Famiglia to Namimori just so they can meet Tsuna. Forget Skull being better company than Reborn, at least Reborn never introduced him to more than what he could handle at once.</p><p>"Thank you for warning me Skull-san." Tsuna sighed</p><p>"Of course! Your mother already said my family and I could camp in the backyard so it only made sense to let you know."</p><p>"Of course she did." Tsuna buried his head into his pillow when Skull made his departure Tsuna screamed.</p><p>"Why can't I get a break?" Tsuna asked his empty room.</p><p>There was no reply.</p>
