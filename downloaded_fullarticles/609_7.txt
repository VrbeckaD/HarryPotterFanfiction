    <p>Draco let out a resigned sigh as he shifted uncomfortably on the platform and tugged on the sleeve of his shirt. Darting a look beside him at Pansy he saw her chin raised and jutting out in stubborn determination and hoped he appeared as confident about returning to Hogwarts.</p><p>They had both been surprised to be invited back for the creatively named eighth year, Draco more so than Pansy. However, it was official and sighed by the new headmistress McGonagall with the additional note that she expected him to be a model student. Draco had glared at the implications of her words and planned to burn the letter, but his mother had taken it from his hand. The expression of hopefulness on her face as she talked about second chances and a brighter future caused his refusal to dry on his tongue without ever being spoken.</p><p>However, now it was time to actually return he was having second thoughts, the whispered insults as they had arrived only the beginning of what they would face in the corridors of the school. He was sure the moment that he let his guard down he’d end up hexed or worse.</p><p>A hand settled on his shoulder, and he turned to face his mother, the strain of the war still visible in the lines on her face making her look older. He didn’t look much better, but he had slowly managed to put on the weight he’d lost. It was only the bags under his eyes from fitful sleep and the scars under his clothing that suggested he wasn’t as fine as he acted.</p><p>“This will be good for you, you’ll see,” she said softly to him with a small pained smile. He returned it with his own unwilling to shatter her delusions. Nothing he did would fix the mistakes their family had made and even trying to take on that responsibly weighed too much for him to carry.</p><p>“I know, I’ll make you proud,” he replied, once more keeping his beliefs to himself and accepting the burden to lessen hers. His mother’s smile widened, and she pulled him into a hug, the open display of affection still strange but appreciated. She needed things to return to normal, needed to know that he could possibly have a future after the war and if completing his studies aided that then he would deal with the stares and whispers and danger.</p><p>Stepping back, he gave her a nod in farewell and moved closer to the carriages with Pansy at his side, comforted by her presence and the knowledge he’d have one ally at school. The whispers grew louder around them, and his attempts to block them out failed, his ears automatically straining to pick up the words while he slipped his hand into his pocket and gripped his wand. He wanted to be prepared should he need to protect himself, just protect. He had no interest in fighting back and risk being sent home or to Azkaban.</p><p>“Can you believe it?”</p><p>“I know. He looks amazing.”</p><p>Draco paused as his head snapped up at the gushed words of the girl a few feet away, confused at first. Then he saw him, and he realised that they hadn’t been talking about him, as his eyes widened and the saliva dried up in his mouth.</p><p>The hair was the same unruly mess of inky black curls, and he still had a pair of circle glasses over his bright green eyes, but everything else had changed about the Gryffindor golden boy.</p><p>For one, he was now golden with a healthy tan showing on his arms, the firm muscles defined and flexing as he hoisted his bag higher on his shoulder. Potter looked strong enough to crush a man, and Draco certainly felt like he was being crushed as his chest tightened, making breathing difficult. He continued to stare as Potter moved closer, the sharp pain in his side from Pansy’s elbow only making him blink for a moment before his eyes returned to Potter.</p><p>“You’re drooling,” she whispered into his ear, and that at least made him snap his jaw closed, he hadn’t really noticed when his mouth had fallen open in shock.</p><p>He swallowed and straightened his back as Potter strode, <em>yes fucking strode</em>, toward them while Draco remained frozen in awe. His eyes trailing over Potter’s broad shoulders and the defined six-pack that could be gleaned from the tight t-shirt he was almost wearing. He narrowed his eyes to look closer, wondering if it’d been painted on due to the way it clung to....everything.</p><p>When Potter drew level with him, their eyes met, and Draco ducked his head as his cheeks burned and his heart raced. He hoped that his lustful gaze hadn’t been recognisable, but Potter continued on without a word. Letting out the breath he had been holding, he risked another peek.</p><p><em> Merlin and Morgana, no one should look like that</em>, he thought, and it was only fear and the fact it was Potter that stopped Draco from throwing himself at the Adonis. A whimper slipped from his lips at the sight of the trousers lovingly cupping Potter's firm arse.</p><p>His eyes flew upward when Potter stopped a foot away and turned. Once more, their eyes met, and Draco was too terrified to look away, to do anything but try and not pass out. Potter was frowning as his eyes ran over Draco’s body before settling on his face where he frowned harder. Draco could feel the flush on his cheeks, the hot tips of his ears, so he tried to smirk, something familiar to remove the tension. He felt it turn into more of a shy smile which seemed to confuse Potter more before slowly, his frown disappeared, and he smiled at Draco.</p><p><em> Oh fuck</em>, Draco’s thoughts shouted in his head, he should go before things got weirder, not to mention the chance to let his blood pressure drop would be a good idea too.</p><p>Unfortunate, the signal from his brain didn’t reach his legs, and he stayed frozen in place, caught in a strange staring match with Potter. His hands were clammy where they were still hidden in his pockets and sweat was beginning to soak through the back of his shirt. A hand gripped his arm, and he found himself being pulled away by Pansy onto the train.</p><p>However, he looked back to catch one last glance at Potter, unable to help himself, and that was why he saw Potter wink at him with what was clearly a seductive smile. The noise he made wasn’t human, and he was thankful that only Pansy was there to hear it as his brain completely shut down. He didn’t think that he’d be able to pass any of his classes if Potter was going to be walking around looking like a wet dream come true. Nevertheless, this year would undoubtedly be exciting and possibly very good for him.</p><p>“I can’t believe you’ve been broken by Potter,” Pansy complained beside him, shaking her head.</p><p>“Did you see him?” Draco replied his voice raspy and filled with lust.</p><p>“Yes, but right now we are riding the train so could you stop thinking about riding Potter?”</p><p>Instantly Draco’s mind was filled with the fantasy of finding Potter on the train and locking them in one of the carriages for the entire trip. He vaguely noticed being pushed down onto a seat and Pansy muttering something at him. Draco didn’t hear a word of it as he pictured holding onto Potter’s shoulders as he straddled his waist and the delicious burn as he sank down onto a hard cock.</p><p>His fantasies, unfortunately, didn’t become a reality and by the time the train reached the station outside of Hogwarts, Draco had convinced himself that Potter hadn’t looked that good. It had just been the shock at how much he had changed that had caused Draco to lose his composure and now he knew what to expect he would be ready with a witty comeback if Potter tried to cause him trouble.</p><p>Leaving their trunks for the elves to collect they stepped off the train and took in the sight of the castle before them. To Draco, it was both familiar and foreboding, like seeing an old friend that he had betrayed. A surprisingly accurate comparison, and his chest tightened with trepidation as he avoided catching the eye of those around him, knowing they would be filled with hatred.</p><p>With a deep breath, he prepared to walk forward only for Potter to appear before him, cutting in front of him and derailing the dark thoughts in his head.</p><p>“Sorry Malfoy,” Potter said as he smiled at Draco and his eyes roamed over Draco’s body with interest and not a trace of embarrassment. A shiver raced down his spine, and Draco opened his mouth, planning to say something snide in reply to Potter’s cocky attitude. The words never reached the end of his tongue and vanished from the front of his mind as Potter winked at him just like before.</p><p>“I’ll see you around,” Potter whispered lowly before spinning on his heels and strode away to join his friends climbing into one of the thestral pulled carriages.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Draco mumbled as he walked with Pansy to the next available carriage in a daze. After taking his seat, he took some time to puzzle over Potter’s strange behaviour but couldn’t make any sense of it.</p><p>“Was that a threat?”</p><p>“I’m not sure, they don’t usually cause that much sexual tension, but that might have just been from the waves of lust coming off you when you practically swallowed your tongue at Potter’s facial tic,” Pansy teased as she gave him an extravagant wink.</p><p>“Piss off Pans,” Draco grumbled as he lifted a hand to cover his flaming cheeks, “He’s just messing with me, but I’m not playing his stupid game.”</p><p>He was back at Hogwarts to study, and that’s what he would do. Potter could be a prat all he wanted, but Draco wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of a response.</p>
