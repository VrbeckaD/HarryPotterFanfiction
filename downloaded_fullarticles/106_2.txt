    <p>I wasn't too sure if it had been planned or an accident that I had found it. I saw it sitting innocently on Dumbledore’s desk just before we left for the Astronomy Tower. A box full of memories and a Pensieve. I was curious, nothing more. It was the curiosity that prompted me to steal them and hide them in my bag which I had been carrying on me for my exams — even though everything in my mind and body screamed that it was the wrong thing to do. I was kinda glad that I had decided to bring my bag with me instead of leaving it in my dorm.</p><p>I had planned to give them back when I had taken a peek into them. Even though my mind kept sending me flashbacks to how angry Snape had been when I looked into his Pensieve I ignored it and quickly smashed it down. Besides, it wasn’t like anyone would find out I took them, the worst that could happen was if the headmaster caught me. But alas I would never have a chance to give it back because Dumbledore was killed before my eyes by Snape. Snape, to whom I held no love for. Snape, who I  began to understand over time. The man I saw more as a father than my biological one, James Potter.</p><p>I could not blame him though. I probably would have taken Malfoy’s place too if I were Snape. </p><p>I am not as stupid as some may think. I am lazy, yes but not stupid, out of all my friends Hermione was the only one who knew this as I conceled in her the most. In one of our many talks, she had admitted that if she had been in my place she would probably be apathetic too. So yes, I am not dumb or stupid just lazy and a bit apathetic. I had known since second year that Snape was his godfather.</p><p>And so I ran… ran away with nothing but the clothes on my back, the bag with the stolen items and my cloak. I had run and completely forgotten about the box of memories and the Pensieve stashed in my bag. Until now,  I was alone because Ron ran off in anger with Hermione following him. I didn’t blame her and I doubt she will return as it has been three days already since they've left.</p><p>I was kinda hurt, Ron expected so much from me that I could not give and when they were not met, he flipped out in a fit of rage. I sometimes wonder if Pansy was right. That Ron would bring me nothing but pain. At that time I thought she was just trying to rile me up but now I wonder if she was somehow right all along.</p><p>I looked down at the box in my hand trying not to think or doubt myself. Nothing mattered in the end, I was used up by fate since the day Voldemort chose me. I will most likely not survive this war and I really couldn’t decide which of the two evils was better. To me, I was born into the light as the savior where I had no choice in the matter. I sometimes wish my uncle really had drowned me before my aunt found me and saved my life. It would have been better.</p><p>I squashed those thoughts as I opened the box. Inside were bottles numbered from one to fifty. All with Tom Riddle’s name under the numbers.</p><p>I wondered what they were and suspected that that day was not an accident but planned. These must had been the ones that Dumbledore didn’t have time to show me. I  wondered why it was labeled with Voldemort’s name, perhaps they were his memories that Dumbledore had tak… no stolen. The very notion made me shiver and wonder if he had stolen my memories as well..</p><p>It also made me angry… no, beyond furious maybe even beyond livid. To steal memories not freely given was a crime worse than the dark arts in my opinion. I may not be Voldemort but I'm sure that he would be more than furious if he ever found out.</p><p>Ah! and now I had something worse than Dumbledore catching me and that was Voldemort finding out.</p><p>I took a deep breath and decided to set up the Pensieve. I knew that it was wrong but my apathy was flaring up again and the anger I had felt turned into a cold ocean of emptiness. The wizarding world had created me, a person not sure if she should be angry, happy, sad or just not care. I switched so fast sometimes that I don’t know who the real me was anymore.</p><p>Once the Pensieve was set up I pulled out the bottle labeled #1 and poured it in. The memory was liquid but more like a silver liquid. I sucked in a breath and plunged into the memory, into a world of black and white.</p>
