  <span>The thing about being a high end hooker (other than the loads of cash and high end hotels) was the anonymity of it all. Draco hadn’t appeared in the newspaper since the trial, yet he had spent so much time with the upper class, he knew all of the inner circle gossip- Greyback’s pending trial, the auror drama, Weasley's new baby, and the ministry’s new decisions. Draco smoked his cigarette and focused on a dark spot on the ceiling wondering what could have caused it, while Jan (what a ridiculous name) put his suit back on him. Sex with him wasn’t as much of a chore as it was with others, but it was as drab as ever. “Amazing as always Draco, I’ll see you next month” Jan smiled at him, it was all teeth, and his tie was crooked but he looked satisfied enough. “You know it babe,” Draco drawled enjoying the feeling of silk sheets (this hotel never failed to exceed expectations). With the click of the door, Draco got up and walked towards to balcony, cigarette still warm between his fingertips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Since the trials, he, Pansy, Blaise, and previously Theo, had struggled with their financial situation and for a while they scrounged on the streets, and pickpocketing. After 3 months of it, they resorted to prostitution. Blaise, being the courageous one, was the first to go to it, and soon the four of them were slowly scrounging enough money to buy a flat for themselves. Eventually their organisation progressed to a high end “comfort” business, and Draco was servicing ministry officials and head aurors (talk about morals). Of course last week Theo had announced that he was quitting and moving in with Dean, one of his clients that he had apparently caught feelings for (gross), leaving Blaise, Pansy and Draco to run the business by themselves. Of course his departure hadn’t affected them much, but Draco couldn’t help but feel a growing gap between Theo and the rest of them. Pansy claimed behind closed doors that Theo’s relationship couldn’t possibly last, and before he knew it, he would be back with them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco watched the blinking city lights, he only had his loose trousers slinging low on his hips (Pansy said he was really too skinny), and took a long drag from his cigarette. He was in the capital, a high scale ministry meeting ended up with him having a lot of clients in the capital so Pansy had rented out a nice room for him in a hotel a few miles away from the one he was in currently. His next client was in a few days so he had a few days to waste away with cigarettes, scotch, and brooding (something he was excellent at). </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What’s the likelihood of running into the saviour of the world while walking on the streets of muggle London? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After one day of smoking, scotch, and his own insecurities, Draco found himself at a small pub in the London nursing a gin and tonic wondering when all of his friends became so healthily adjusted to their lives. Blaise and Pansy were buying stocks and attempting to increase profit for the company, Theo was still happily honeymooning with his new fiance. Draco was left lonely and unhappy, wondering when life had decided screw him over, probably when he decided to side with psychopath he mentally added. So he decided maybe brooding and sitting in his flat all day wasn’t helping, maybe taking a walk outside would. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy?” Potter asked, the surprise was clear on his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well hello Potter,” Draco drawled, he fiddled with his cigarette</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?” Potter asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I live in the area” Draco forced out. After six years he still felt nervous and embarrassed around Potter, it didn’t help that he looked so </span>
  <em>
    <span>good</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He was wearing dark jeans and a red jumper, it just made it more infuriating that Potter managed to pull it off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah me too I guess” Potter said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I’ll catch you around” Draco blurted, he was flushing for some reason and he was stuck between wanting to talk more with Potter and wanting to run away forever, apparently his mouth had made the decision for him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, see you later” Potter said.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Damnit, Potter’s hair still looked untouchable.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a particularly unenjoyable “appointment” (as Draco liked to call it), where Auror Jenkins went to hard and was far too sweaty, Draco was left in yet another fancy hotel, smoking a cigarette. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wondered what Potter was doing, probably saving some helpless kittens or preventing tsunamis. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His phone (muggle inventions were just so lovely), rang and when he picked up the familiar sound a Pansy’s cutting voice made it’s way through the speaker,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco- you have a new appointment tomorrow” he could hear the distant sound of Pansy clicking away on her computer definitely balancing out the company’s finances. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And who can afford this hot bod” Draco drawled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well the lucky bloke who can afford your pasty white ass is the best friend of the lucky bloke who will get you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s a loop, what’s the lucky bloke’s name” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well he refused to give names but he gave me the money already and an address” Pansy’s typing continued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well love, send them on over,” Draco took another drag of his cigarette. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just sent it,” the clicking stopped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At 9:00 Draco found himself wearing his classic suit combo (the one that made his arse look amazing), and standing outside a nice looking flat checking his watch. He sincerely hoped this bloke would be quick, because he didn’t feel like dragging himself home at 3 in the morning. One of the downsides of having appointments in the client’s actual flat was the need to never overstay his welcome (that meant sneaking out right after). He briskly knocked on the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At approximately 9:01 Draco found himself staring open-mouthed at Harry Potter, who himself was looking about just as shocked (if maybe more) than Draco was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Potter” Draco stated, he was trying to confirm that the lucky bloke was none other than the saviour golden boy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy, ohmygod Ron told me just a few minutes ago- I didn’t know who to call I really just um the thing is” Potter rambled on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Embarrassment and shame flared inside Draco, and suddenly so did anger. Potter didn’t get to make him feel shame for this- this was who he was, the world didn’t get to have Draco feel disgusting in front of Potter. Draco put on his perfected emotionless mask. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s get this done” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pushing past Potter, Draco stepped inside of the flat (which was surprisingly plain for the chosen one), and took off his blazer casually tossing it onto a couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should know this from my contract but I don’t do any kissing on the mouth and ropes are only allowed if I can free myself when I want to,” (he had learned that with experience). </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy really you don’t have to, Ron was being an arse, you can keep the money” Potter gestured with his hands weakly his face red and his eyes darting away from Draco’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Another spike of irritation flared inside of Draco, he wasn’t begging for Potter’s charity, he had survived on the streets long enough without the golden boy taking pity on him. He slipped out of his shirt and peeled off his trousers, presenting himself to Potter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Potter. Shut the fuck up and shag me now or I’m gonna tell my pimp we lost a client.” Drarry bit out (yeah, maybe calling Pansy his pimp was a creative use of hyperbole, but Potter would never know that). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In an instant Potter was on him hands and mouth- touching every inch of Draco’s pale skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck Malfoy, I have no control with you” Potter breathed between the hickeys he was giving Draco. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco couldn't even give a reply between the moans he was giving Potter. Instead he started tugging at Potter’s shirt which was suddenly covering up too much skin and simultaneously trying to drag his jeans off too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter responded by dragging his ratty shirt over his head and slipping out of his jeans.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And </span>
  <em>
    <span>holy shit</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the years had been kind to Potter, his chest was muscled and though he was still lean, Potter had very defined abs lining his stomach, and the golden boy’s cock was definitely showing interest in Draco’s naked body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the sight of Potter’s rather large appendage, Draco sank to his knees and took the tip into his mouth. And fuck- giving head had never felt so good before, he swirled his tongue around the slit and began to bob his head down completely. “Holy fuck-nnnnhnnn- Draco” Potter moaned, his fingers curling in Draco’s blonde hair, which was frighteningly soft. Draco continued, savoring the taste and cursing the world for making this so </span>
  <em>
    <span>good</span>
  </em>
  <span>, because he would never be able to do this to another client without thinking of Potter again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco-mm stop I’m going to” Potter moaned, trying to pull Draco off of him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco popped off of Potter’s cock, and positioned himself over the saviour. “Wait are you-” Potter began, “I’m prepared” Draco stated, he did always attempt to prepare himself in case of rough clients that didn’t enjoy foreplay. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Holy shit Draco, your arse” Potter stated, pupils dilated, “is amazing” Draco finished.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Enjoying the burn, Draco sank himself onto Potter’s cock, gritting his teeth and flushing the whole time. Potter writhed beneath him rambling nonsense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Move Potter” Draco gritted out, his legs trembled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter immediately complied and found a way to hit Draco’s prostate perfectly with each thrust leaving Draco a breathless heap of moans and pleasure. He proceeded to kiss every inch of Draco’s chest, leaving a trail of hickeys. Potter’s hand found its way to Draco’s cock and the sensations from both his arse and cock, brought Draco closer to his climax. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco mm, I’m gonna come” Potter bit out in between kisses. “Come sugar” Draco stated twisting his fingers in Potter’s dark hair. With a breathy moan, Draco came over Potter’s fist, and Potter apparently also had came inside of Draco. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco lay breathless on Potter’s chest, fingers still curled in Potter’s hair, the two of them were still lying on Potter’s carpeted floor (Draco sincerely hoped this floor was clean) . Part of him was screaming to get out and not overstay his welcome but another part of him wanted to curl up in Potter’s arms forever.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Said saviour of the world wrapped his arms around Draco holding him flush against his body. Draco’s eyes drooped and he fell asleep lulled by the warmth of Potter’s arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Light filtered through the curtains and the first thing Draco felt was an intense a very weird feeling of </span>
  <em>
    <span>relaxation</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He hadn’t felt this comfortable in years- so he definitely wasn’t in his own room. That was when he was greeted by Potter’s distinct head of shaggy black hair; currently Draco was curled up against Potter’s very bare chest and Draco himself was also very bare (he was buttnaked). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Slowly the realization that Draco had fallen asleep at a client’s house, Potter’s house to make it worse, hit Draco and he felt the urgent need to run. So he did what any Malfoy would do- he slipped into his clothes and slipped out of the apartment, not before examining Potter and taking mental pictures of how attractive the golden boy looked while sleeping. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So 11:00 that morning Draco found himself yet again brooding and smoking a cigarette while staring out the window and contemplating the disastrous decisions he had made in life. That was when the sound of a sharp knocking at the door filled his ears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco, what the fuck, you didn’t pick up when Blaise called you, and my texts went unanswered, and you know the last time you didn’t pick up, I was so fucking worried about you, you fucking piece of horse shit,” Pansy shouted when Draco opened the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked worried, irritated, and terrifying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry Pans, the appointment tired me out”, Draco winced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco are you okay, did he hurt you?” Pansy tilted Draco’s jaw to inspect for injuries.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco gently removed her probing fingers, “No Pans, I’m fine it was just surprise is all”. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Pansy frowned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was Harry Potter” Draco stated</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, that’s just, wow”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah” Draco said, he ran a hand through his hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well he paid well” Pansy suggested sheepishly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know Pansy, I just don’t know, it was a mistake and I know it- but it just freaks me out so much. He looks so good and I don’t wanna get close to him, but last night, I don’t know”  Draco mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Draco, I know you hate when I lecture you, but I don’t want you hung up over a schoolboy obsession, we have a job to do,” Pansy said softly; her eyes were to truthful and they cut through Draco like a sharpened knife. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah it’s strictly sex anyway” Draco said flatly, chest tightening with pain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah sure Draco,” Pansy said, but her tone was too patronizing and unbelieving for Draco.</span>
