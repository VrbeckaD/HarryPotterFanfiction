  <b>-Thestral Cottage; Watkins Glen, New York; Novemeber 9th, 1927-</b>
</p><p>Newt Apparated onto the porch, exhaustion tugging at every part of him. He wanted three things; Percival, a nap and then time with his children. </p><p>He opened the door with a careless flick of his wand, kicked off his boots and then flopped into the squashiest armchair with a long, satisfied groan. It was good to be home, even if he had plenty of material for a revision of his book. </p><p>"Newt?" Percival and oh how Newt relished his voice. </p><p>"In the armchair, love." He sighed, "I've only just come through the door. Watch the case." </p><p>"Another Erumpent?" Percival carried him from the chair into their bed, the case floating alongside them. </p><p>"A hatchling and they're volatile so don't even think-" </p><p>"... You brought home a Roc chick, didn't you?" </p><p>"No, I most-" </p><p>"Certainly did. Newt, what did I say about tricking MACUSA inspections again?" Percival finished and countered with a raised brow, pressing a kiss to his cheek. </p><p>"It's not <i>my</i> fault they won't walk past Grace's enclosure." Newt huffed as Percival removed most of his clothing with a non-verbal spell and then put his pajamas on. "Oh, alright, for Merlin's sake stop giving me that look of yours. I might, mind you, <i>might</i> have placed the Roc chick after hers." </p><p>"I swear to Morgana if I have to chase a Roc hatchling through New York, I'm banning Rocs from that case of yours for a year." Percival grumbled even as he pillowed his cheek on Newt's chest. </p><p>"Liar," he teased, his jaw cracking in a yawn before he settled into their bed. </p><p>"... The next Roc I'm confiscating." </p><p>Newt jogged Percival with how much he was trying not to laugh.</p>
<hr/><p>He stretched and expected resistance but his fingers closed on still-warm sheets, which meant Percival was seeing Credence and Modesty off to their schooling. </p><p>Newt shuffled into his love's houserobe and his own house slippers, yawning as the robe slipped off his shoulder. </p><p>"Mm, you're up early." Percival murmured, gently drawing Newt down for a leisurely kiss. Newt rumbled at the slip of tongue into his mouth, hauling Percival up against a wall to kiss him breathless. "Missed that. Missed you." </p><p>"Did you?" Newt replied, his teeth tugging at Percival's bottom lip, dragging out thier kiss until Percival arched into him. </p><p>"Don't tease, my dragon." </p><p>"Who said I was teasing?" </p><p>"Newt! Breakfast-" </p><p>"Can wait, 'Val," he purred as he non-verbally turned off the Muggle stove and put their meal under a Stasis Charm. "I've a... different meal in mind." </p><p>"Newt!"</p>
<hr/><p>Decidedly more ruffled, they resumed their morning routine, Percival half-singing a new song under his breath, "<i>Love, oh love, oh careless love/In your clutches of desire/You've made me break a many true vow/Then you set my very soul on fire...</i>" </p><p>"Where is that from?" Even having known each other for nearly a full decade, Newt was stil finding out things about his lover. </p><p>"Some bird named Bessie Smith sings it on the No-Maj radio," came the absent reply as Percival carefully levitated the plates over to the table, setting one in front of Newt. </p><p>He picked up his fork to cut into his food, Percival's legs tangled with his as they shared food off of each other's plates, the table reverting to its dual person setting. </p><p>"I should probably feed-" </p><p>"Already done, Credence went down this morning and fed all of them, even the Roc." Percival countered, chin pillowed in his hand as he looked at Newt with a fond smile. </p><p>Newt squinted at his lover over the rim of his tea mug, suddenly suspicious. "Why?" </p><p>"So I could do this," 'Val dug around in his houserobe pocket, untangled his legs from Newt's and then knelt in front of him with an opened box. "Newton Artemis Fido Scamander, would you do me the honor of being my partner in all things? My beloved friend and companion for as long as we both shall live?" </p><p>Newt, overwhelmed with joy, turned into a dragon (albeit a slightly smaller one than he'd been at MACUSA). </p><p>"Newt? Have I said something wrong?" </p><p><i><b>"Give me a moment,"</b></i> Newt allowed as he wrested with his high emotions. He managed to turn mostly human, wings still sprouting from his back and spiralled horns still in his hair as he knelt with Percival and clasped his hand around the box. "I would love nothing more than to be your companion, your dearest friend and beloved for as long as we both shall live." </p><p>"Can I give you this handcuff then?" Percival drawled after they'd kissed on the floor. "And possibly get off my knees, because the floor isn't very kind to them." </p><p>Newt slipped back into his human form and purred as he tugged Percival up into another kiss, "Why? You look quite lovely down there." </p><p>Percival flushed red for a moment before he laughed. "So do you, my dragon." </p><p>"'Val!"</p>
<hr/><p>The matching rings were made of Dragon claw, Phoenix feather and Wampus claw, the swirling bands of bone, feather and essentially obsidian perfectly at home on his finger. It was fire-proof, acid-proof and wouldn't harm any of the creatures Newt worked with on a daily basis. </p><p>Percival truly had been quite thorough, having added an enchantment that allowed them to know where the other was and sized itself to its wearer. It also didn't come off through any magical means but rather intent so that no one could force it off their fingers. </p><p>It was an awful remnant left over from Grindlewald's capture of his fianc√© but a necessary precaution.</p>
