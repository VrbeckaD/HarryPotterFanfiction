    <p>There was a gentle <em>tick</em>, <em>tock</em>, counting down the silence of the house. It felt like hours now that she had been listening to it, echoing within the stillness. She had tried to keep count, but could not keep her thoughts from drifting away to that dark place she was so studiously avoiding. Her mind would stray, she would lose track of what <em>tock</em> had just followed which <em>tick</em>, and she would start counting all over again. She was currently at 302.</p><p>Though she was listening to the clock, she wasn't watching it. Not that clock at least. Her eyes had long since moved beyond the ticking second hand, and were fixed instead on the larger clock behind. This clock was different; her mother had made it for them when James had been born. It had five hands, each with the name of a family member, and around the edge were written descriptions such as 'at school', or 'shopping'. Three of the hands were currently pointed at 'asleep'. One said 'at home'. The fifth had recently moved from 'in mortal peril' to 'at work'.</p><p>As she counted the 314th <em>tick</em>, the hand she was watching shifted casually over to 'travelling', and she slipped silently out of bed, draping her dressing gown across her shoulders and padding barefoot downstairs.</p><p>She settled herself on the usual sofa – the one within sight of the door, but not right beside it. He knew what she was like, that she would be waiting, but there was no need to worry him unnecessarily.</p><p>If she had still been counting, she would have known it to be 124 seconds later that the tell-tale sounds of him arriving filtered through the front door, and merely another eight before her weary husband stepped inside.</p><p>There was a procedure for this; a routine. First, relief. Second, check for physical harm. Third, for emotional distress. Finally, if she were lucky, there would be relief again. Occasionally she would throw in a dose of irritation, if it sounded as though he had been unnecessarily reckless, though that was mostly for show.</p><p>He was standing, that was important, and he didn't seem bowed down by any serious injury. In fact, the only sign of outward harm was a slash on his cheek, already partially healed, and a slight crookedness to his right arm, which, she belatedly realised, was held in a sling beneath his cloak. His clothes had the crumpled look of having been very wet and then magically dried, and the remnants of that same moisture had slicked back his copious hair, for once holding it away from his face. The clothes weren't torn, however, which would suggest they disguised no great injury beneath.</p><p>He was smiling at her, and, though he was clearly tired, it looked genuine. That in itself was reassuring. Harry was one of those people who found it very hard to smile when something terrible had happened, even to comfort his wife, as though to do so would disrespect whatever horror he had witnessed. If it had been a bad night, he would also generally take a few moments before coming in, which he hadn't done tonight.</p><p>Relief, then, seemed a suitable way forward.</p><p>As the door closed behind him, she could almost feel the clock upstairs sliding its final hand into place. Her husband was <em>at home</em>. All five of her family, present and accounted for, her job done and dusted for the day, thank you and goodnight.</p><p>He had moved across the room towards her, and now she finally smiled too and rose to greet him. His breath was hot in her ear, and the firmness of his hug suggested that, though it hadn't been <em>one of those </em>nights, things had perhaps come closer than she had initially diagnosed.</p><p>"You shouldn't have waited up" he murmured, more out of habit than anything else. She didn't bother to answer, instead reaching up and fussing with his hair, ruffling it up until it looked more normal. Then she brought her hand down to his cheek, palm against the cut in unspoken enquiry. He brought his hand to rest on hers.</p><p>"Prisoner escaped from custody. Took us all night to track him down, but it was pretty routine. I fell at one point," he raised his injured arm, "and got this from a <em>diffindo</em>," he gestured to the cut.</p><p>She pulled their hands from his cheek, keeping hold of his in hers and leading them to the sofa.</p><p>"Sounds incredibly boring," she joked, though the house was so quiet and she herself was so at peace now he had returned that it emerged as little more than a whisper. She settled back against him and looked up to his face. "Where's my tale of thrilling heroics, daring adventure?" She shook her head in mock disappointment. "I'll have to think of something else to tell the girls at the office tomorrow."</p><p>He laughed, but also quietly. It was always this way, when he returned late but unharmed. Awake later than usual, drowsier than they would be had they stayed up intentionally, and more content than they could have been had the night gone another way. In a house hushed by other people's sleep, their own wakefulness was a warm and secret bubble, and neither were willing to let it burst.</p><p>"You should have seen Ron," he said, breath tickling her face. "Black eye the size of a quaffle, and a nose as crooked as Dumbledore's." He laughed. "Unfortunately, the mediwitch fixed him up before I could get a photograph. I think he was a little disappointed, if I'm honest."</p><p>She smiled at the thought of her brother showing off his bruises, regaling anyone who would listen with the story behind them. Harry may be subtler, but she knew he too enjoyed being able to tell stories about scars that didn't involve Voldemort, or his parents' death.</p><p>"He probably would have framed it," she giggled. "Looked at it each night before bed."</p><p>"Hey," Harry scolded, hitting her arm gently, but he too laughed.</p><p>He stretched out his neck, laying his head back against the sofa, and let out an enormous yawn. She could feel her mouth twitch in response, eventually giving way to a yawn of her own. She elbowed his leg.</p><p>"That was your fault," she accused.</p><p>Her head had slipped onto his lap by now, and it was incredibly comfortable. She was also finding it harder and harder to keep her eyes open, and, if she were to let herself, she knew she would have no trouble falling asleep right there and then.</p><p>Harry shifted slightly, but seemed to decide that was response enough. They were even breathing quietly now, too reluctant to break the sleepy silence.</p><p>They should head to bed. They were both working the next morning, and, even if they hadn't been, the kids would no doubt be up and demanding attention by six-thirty. But the bubble was still there, and going upstairs would only wake her up again, pleasant drowsiness shaken off by the time she had climbed the stairs and brushed her teeth once more.</p><p>Besides, she could still hear the faint ticking from upstairs, only now – nestled into Harry, worry resolved – it had become a source of comfort, not suspense. As she slipped further from consciousness, she lost track of whether it was still coming from her room, or if it issued from some dream already waiting, calling for her to join.</p><p>Harry had already surrendered to sleep's beckoning finger, if his light snores were any indication, and she gave trying to resist. She drifted, and in her haze she found herself instinctively counting the seconds once more.</p><p>
  <em>One, two, three</em>
</p><p>She was going to woken in a few hours, she just knew it. Harry would move in his sleep, or one of the children would come down for some water, and she would regret not having moved upstairs.</p><p>
  <em>Four, five, six</em>
</p><p>And she would definitely have a stiff neck in the morning. Surely this extravagant level of comfort couldn't last – it wasn't fair to everyone else.</p><p><em>Seven, eight, nine</em>. . .</p><p>They should make cushions shaped exactly like Harry's lap. There must be a spell for it, somewhere. If she discovered it she could sell them, and they would be millionaires.</p><p><em>Ten, eleven, twelve</em>. . .</p><p>That would be nice. She could finally take the whole family to Egypt again. Harry had offered, but it hadn't felt right using his family money, even now that it was officially half hers.</p><p><em>Thirteen, fourteen</em>. . .</p><p>She really was so lovely and warm. Perhaps she was in Egypt already.</p><p><em>Fifteen, sixteen. . . seventeen</em>. . .</p><p>That would be nice. She could finally take the whole family to Egypt. . .</p><p>
  <em>Seventeen. . .</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Eighteen. . .</em>
</p><p>And she was gone.</p>
