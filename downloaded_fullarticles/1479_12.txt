  <strong>RWBY/HARRY POTTER (Part I)</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Earth</strong>
</p><p>WAAAAAAAA!" Baby Harry cried as the noise below shook the house, scaring the one-year-old. Lily stopped what she was doing for a brief instant, maternal instincts compelling her to comfort her child, but she couldn't. If Harry was to have any chance of surviving this night, she would need to work as quickly, but precisely, as possible. There could be no distractions.</p><p>Ever since she was a student at Hogwarts, Lily had been fascinated by the concept of Other Worlds; alternate realities, some like Earth, others wildly different. Lily's mind was filled with images of these strange places, influenced in part by childhood stories of Wonderland, Never Never Land, Oz, and Grimms' Fairy Tales. It became her passion, guiding her through the study of Runes, Arithmancy, and even Astrology, a subject few students took after their O.W.L.s. There was very little known about these Other Worlds, but Lily considered herself an expert on what there was.</p><p>One thing she'd learned about the Other Worlds was that they all orbited a central hub, not unlike planets orbiting the Sun. However, just like Earth occasionally moved into alignment with the Sun and Moon, sometimes two Worlds would come into alignment with each other. Such occasions were considered the best possible times to travel between Worlds, if you were brave or crazy enough to do so.</p><p>Lily was neither; she was desperate, and this was her last viable chance. She and her husband, James Potter, had been part of a secret group known as the Order of the Phoenix, a small team of Wizards and Witches dedicated to battling the Dark Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Voldemort had been waging a war of Terror across Britain, trying to overthrow the government, much of which was either secretly on his side or else too scared to do anything effective against him.</p><p>Upon learning of her pregnancy, Lily and James had gone into hiding in Godric's Hollow, hoping to raise their child in relative safety. They hadn't been successful. Somehow, Voldemort had found them; the couple had faced him three times in battle and been among the few to escape alive. To the Dark Lord, that was an unforgivable crime. Now, he and her husband were battling below her. James had told her to take Harry and run, but where would she run to? Voldemort had already set up Wards to keep her from Apparating away, and he likely had his followers posted outside the house to prevent her from fleeing on foot.</p><p>Lily picked up baby Harry, wrapped him in a blanket, and began rocking him in her arms as she examined the Runes she'd drawn on the floor. They were perfect, all that was left was a burst of energy to power the spell and—</p><p>
  <em>CRASH!</em>
</p><p>Lily held Harry closer, trying to shield him from the blast as the nursery door was blown away. Her son stopped crying. Perhaps he was too confused to scream anymore.</p><p>"Ah, Mrs. Potter, we meet again," spoke the Dark Lord, evidently not caring that he sounded like a Muggle's Saturday morning cartoon villain.</p><p>"You killed my husband," she said. It wasn't a question.</p><p>"I gave him a chance to live," Voldemort replied, nonchalantly. "And, I'm offering the same to you now, Lily. Hand over the boy, and I will let you go unharmed."</p><p>"Why do you want my son?" Lily asked. Her back was to Voldemort, so he couldn't see her surreptitiously place the note she had written into Harry's blanket.</p><p>"That is none of your concern," the Dark Lord said. "All that matters is this: you can either give me the boy, or you can die. I don't personally care which."</p><p><em>"Expelliarmus!"</em> Lily yelled. Drawing her wand from her arm holster, she spun and cast the spell, hoping to disarm Voldemort before he could counterattack.</p><p>Voldemort laughed, batting her spell aside as though it were a fly. "As you wish," he said, laughing. <em>"Avada Kedavra!"</em> A sickly green light erupted from his bone-white wand, enveloping Lily, killing her instantly. The red-haired witch fell to the floor, just as she was hit, she positioned her body, so it cushioned the impact; even in death, she continued to protect her son. Voldemort failed to notice this, and even if he had, he would have laughed at the act, at the folly of love. What was the point in protecting the child from the fall, when he was defenseless against Voldemort anyway?</p><p>Or, so he thought.</p><p>Voldemort prepared to cast the Unforgivable Killing Curse once again, seeking to end the danger outlined in the Prophecy his minion had partially overheard. What he didn't know was that when he had killed Lily Potter, he'd activated the Runes she had drawn on the floor, which he had also failed to notice or if he had, considered them beneath his concern. Something most Wizards failed to grasp was that Magic didn't actually like to disobey the laws of nature. If you didn't tell a spell to break a specific rule, it wouldn't, and there were some laws that simply couldn't be broken, period. One such unbreakable law was the Law of Conservation of Energy: energy can neither be created nor destroyed. When Voldemort had killed Lily with his instantaneously fatal curse, all her life energies and magic were forced from her body, but what Voldemort didn't know was that they had to go somewhere. What Lily's runes had done was suck these energies up and used them to power her spell. The spell which, when activated, opened a portal to another world for a few precious seconds, sucking whoever was standing or laying in the focal point of the Runes inside and whisking them away to the destination. Lily didn't know enough about the World closest in alignment to Earth at the moment, but she wasn't taking any chances with her son. Why save him from Voldemort only to have him wind up in the hands of abusers or slavers? So, she'd "programed" the spell to send Harry to the best and most loving couple in the young Wizard's new world, whoever they might be.</p><p>Of course, no one's perfect; there were a couple of things Lily hadn't counted on. Blame it on the urgency of the situation, or perhaps her own personal understanding of the world. Lily's understanding of couples was limited by the history of her own world. Magic's was not, and much like when it came to the laws of nature, unless you told a spell to interpret information in a certain way, it would follow the directions <em>exactly. </em>This meant that while Lily's choice of the the word "couple" ensured that Harry would be raised by a monogamous pair, it didn't limit the spell to only examining heterosexual parents.</p><p>She also hadn't known the explosion of energy created by ripping a whole in the fabric of reality would vaporize Voldemort and a good portion of the house. Though, if she had, she wouldn't have minded.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <strong>Remnant</strong>
</p><p>Snow crunched under Ruby's feet as she trudged back home. It was the only sound in the silent, wintery world, and that was good. It meant she was alone, and being alone meant being safe when you were this deep into the wild. The cottage she called home was only a few miles' walk away, but a few miles of uninhabited wilderness was the most dangerous place on Remnant, a world filled with both wild animals and the infinitely more dangerous Creatures of Grimm.</p><p>Behind her, on the edge of the cliff, was a simple solitary grave. It was her mother's. As a child, Ruby had visited this place often, especially in winter, when she could almost see the ghost of Summer Rose hovering in the snow behind it. It had been almost impossible to leave sometimes.</p><p>Not so much anymore. Oh, Ruby still missed her mother terribly; there wasn't a single day that Ruby wasn't somehow reminded of her loss, and there hadn't been a single milestone in her life she hadn't been sad her Mom couldn't have been there to share with her (except maybe her wedding night—that was the opposite; a moment when she tried not to think about Mom looking down on her from Above and seeing . . . yeah). As time passed, though, Ruby had found new people to love, people who filled the gaps in her heart: friends, sisters, Weiss . . .</p><p>Ruby quickened her step at the thought of her wife. Maybe she should use her Semblance and just run home? She was strong enough now that she could sustain the high speeds for the whole trip, although she'd probably crash on the doorstep when she got home, and Weiss would scold her . . .</p><p>"WAAAAAAAA!"</p><p>Ruby stopped and turned to her right. She gazed into the dark forest. Was that the wind? Was it some kind of Grimm's call? It had sounded like a—</p><p>"WAAAAAAAA!"</p><p>Ruby activated her Semblance, flying through the trees like a human bullet, her feet barely touching the ground, a stream of rose petals dancing behind her. It only took a moment to find the source of the screams. What she found made her heart break.</p><p>Lying in the snow, in the middle of the clearing, was a woman with bright red hair, wearing a sweater (Why? It was the middle of winter.), clutching a screaming baby in her arms. Ruby knelt by the woman's side, lightly touching her hand. Nothing. Not a trace of Aura. The woman must have been dead for hours.</p><p>Which was odd, because the whole area was <em>tingling </em>with the presence of some kind of energy.</p><p>Saving that question for later, Ruby picked up the child, holding him carefully. It was a boy all right, about a year old, judging by her friends' children. Poor thing must be scared out of his mind.</p><p>"There, there . . ." Ruby whispered, wrapping her red cloak around him, drawing the child in close to her warmth. "It'll be OK. I know it doesn't seem like it, but it'll be OK." The boy continued to scream. "Oh, how did Yang calm me down?" she asked, thinking back to how her older sister had comforted her when she was a little girl, just after Mom's death.</p><p>Ruby took a deep breath and started to sing. <em>"Red like roses fills my dreams and brings me to the place you rest . . ."</em> Ruby wasn't much of a singer. Yang was better, and Weiss was amazing. Neither of them were available right now, though, so she would have to do. At least the boy seemed to like her singing. His crying stopped, and he fell asleep. Ruby smiled. Maybe she wasn't so bad after all. She looked at the body of whom she guessed was the child's mother, sighing. What was she going to do about this? She couldn't carry the woman and the boy back home. Pretty soon, though, the body's scent would attract scavengers, and it didn't seem right to just let the woman's remains be torn apart by wolves and crows and things. Not after she had obviously tried so hard to protect her baby—</p><p>
  <em>"Grrrrrrrrrrrr!"</em>
</p><p>Ruby looked up. All around her were black, bipedal wolves covered in spiky, bone-like armor. Beowolves. Creatures of Grimm, they were probably attracted here by the child's cries, or more likely, by his pain. Ruby scowled. Allowing the mother's body to be devoured by wolves seemed much more dignified now; Creatures of Grimm didn't scavenge dead bodies—they didn't need to feed to survive. No, these monsters would rip the mother's body apart just for the sake of defiling it. All Grimm knew was hatred for intelligent beings, and acting on that hatred was the closest thing to pleasure they seemed to feel.</p><p>Reaching behind her, Ruby pulled out a large rectangle of red metal. A flick of the switch, and it opened up into Crescent Rose, Ruby's own customizable, high-impact sniper rifle/reaper's scythe. The baby sniffled, and she instinctively held him a little closer to her chest. One woman holding a baby against a pack of, <em>Let's see, </em>she started counting, <em>one, two, three, four . . . thirty-four Beowolves . . .</em></p><p>She'd faced worse odds than this before Beacon.</p>
<hr/><p>Weiss stirred the pot on the stove, wondering if the soup needed more rosemary. Ruby hadn't come back yet. The former heiress wasn't concerned, though. Ruby was the most skilled and powerful Huntress she knew. She'd taken on gangs, terrorists, mech suits, and Weiss couldn't count how many Grimm the silver-eyed woman had slain. She wasn't worried. Not worried at all . . .</p><p>OK, she was worried. Five seconds from pulling out her own hair worried.</p><p>It happened every time Ruby went out into the woods without her. Weiss wanted to come, but she always felt as though she were intruding. Oh, Ruby had taken her to Summer Rose's grave several times in the past, but those had been for special occasions, such as honoring the dead woman's birthday, usually with Yang, Blake, Taiyang, and Qrow. This was different. This was Ruby's time to be with her mother, and as much as Weiss knew Ruby would accept her presence, she wasn't "welcome," not really. The one time she'd tried, they'd both felt so awkward, they'd sworn off ever trying again. So, Weiss contented herself with making a late dinner and waiting for Ruby to show up.</p><p>Weiss stirred the pot a little faster. She hated waiting. It meant sitting here, safe in her home, while her wife was out in the Grimm-infested woods visiting a place that made her <em>sad, </em>an emotional state which attracted Grimm, remember—and there wasn't a thing Weiss could do about it.</p><p>Weiss checked the clock, frowning. Ruby should have been back by now. What was taking her so long? Ruby had been late before, but still . . . If she wasn't home in the next ten minutes, Weiss was going out after her. If she was, Weiss would give the woman a piece of her mind.</p><p>SLAM! "Weiss . . . I'm home."</p><p>Speak of the dolt. Weiss let go of the ladle and marched to the front door to give Ruby the thorough tongue lashing she deserved for making Weiss worry so much. When the snowy-haired woman got there, however, she was paralyzed by what she saw. Ruby, panting, clothing disheveled, holding her oversized weapon in one hand—it's blade scraping the floor, how many times had Weiss asked her NOT to do that—and a blanket-wrapped baby in the other.</p><p>"Ruby . . . what . . .?" the snow-haired woman asked when she finally found her voice.</p><p>"Found him in the woods . . ." Ruby explained, still panting. Weiss saw her wife swaying on her feet and moved to her side, knocking the heavy scythe from her hands (who cared about the stupid floor?) and guiding her to the couch. Ruby continued. "His mom . . . dead . . . probably for a few hours . . . Beowolves came . . . Had to kill them . . . all."</p><p>Weiss restrained the urge to chastise her wife for not taking the baby and running away from the monsters. The child was asleep now, and didn't need to be woken by her berating Ruby for being a dunce. She mentally noted that she would have to do that later, however. For now, she just asked, "Are you all right?"</p><p>Ruby grinned. "Never better . . . Princess."</p><p>Weiss sighed, examining Ruby's Aura to see if she was still trying to heal anything. Happily, it seemed drained, but inactive. Ruby would be all right. Eying the baby, she asked "Do you know what the baby and his mother were doing out there? Where did she come from?" The village of Patch was the only settlement only the island. Ruby was the only one brave or foolish enough to go into the woods alone, and she was a trained Huntress. What could have driven this mysterious woman to put herself and her child in such a dangerous situation?</p><p>Ruby shook her head. "No. It was odd though, his mom was wearing a sweater, no jacket, like she thought it was fall, not winter."</p><p>"Ruby Rose, you dress <em>exactly</em> the same way every season," Weiss pointed out.</p><p>"Yeah, but I've got an Aura, and I'm wearing my long underwear under this," Ruby countered. She frowned, "Now that I think about it, I didn't see any tracks leading to the clearing, and there wasn't a vehicle nearby, not that there's many that you could use in a snow-covered forest."</p><p>"It was snowing," Weiss pointed out. "Maybe her tracks were covered up."</p><p>"I don't think so. It wasn't snowing that hard, so there should have been—hey, a note!" Ruby said, gently extracting the piece of paper from the baby's blanket.</p><p>"Let me see," Weiss said, taking it. "This paper . . . it looks almost like parchment . . . It doesn't feel like regular paper . . . Who was this woman?" Orienting the paper, Weiss was about to it read aloud when she saw something. "Ruby, why is there blood on the baby's forehead?"</p><p>Ruby's smile morphed into a frown. "It's my fault," she said, gently wiping the blood away. "I got careless, and one of the Beowolves scratched him."</p><p>Weiss sighed. "At least nothing worse happened," she said. She knew Ruby was already berating herself worse than she ever could. Her wife was perhaps the most caring person Weiss had ever met. Turning her attention back to the parchment or whatever it was, started to read.</p><p>
  <em>"Hello, sir and ma'am. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm sorry. What I'm about to tell you may seem impossible. Or perhaps, it will seem perfectly mundane; I have very little idea what your world is like. My name is Lily Potter, and I am a Witch. Does that surprise you? If it does, I promise, magic is real. My son (his name is Harry James Potter) and I come from another world, an alternate reality, if you will. I understand this may sound crazy to you; I understand you may not even be able to read this language, but I am desperate. My husband and I fought an evil Wizard in our world, a Dark Lord. He called himself Voldemort, and his followers were the Death Eaters. We defeated many of his followers, but we had to go into hiding to protect Harry. If you are reading this, then Voldemort, the Dark Lord, has found us. I can't imagine we aren't dead as Voldemort has no concept of mercy. It doesn't matter, however, if my last, desperate plan has worked, and Harry is safely in your world. I used my magic to seek out the best possible couple in your world and sent Harry to you. I'm sorry, but I must ask you, beg you even, please, please take care of my son.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In your eternal debt,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lily Potter"</em>
</p><p>The two women were stunned speechless. What the note said sounded like something out of a story or a comic book. For perhaps five full moments, neither spoke. Neither moved. Then, the baby, Harry Potter, sniffled in his sleep, snuggling closer into Ruby's bosom. The silver-eyed Huntress laughed nervously. "Well, I guess we're parents now, Princess."</p><p>Weiss just stared at the woman with whom she had chosen to spend her life. There was only one response to that. "You dunce."</p><p> </p>
