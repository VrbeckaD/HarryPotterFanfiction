<p>Relationship Manifesto</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“We’re not attacking, we’re trying to understand.” </p>
<p>“So my word’s not enough?” </p>
<p>“That’s not what she’s saying, mate. You <i>hated</i> Snape until last year, remember? What changed?” </p>
<p>“Everything! Severus is amazing and brilliant, and he sacrificed almost everything for us.” </p>
<p>“And that makes him heroic, but what made you fancy him instead of, say, Ginny?”</p>
<p>“Please leave my sister out of this.” </p>
<p>“Sorry, Ron. Instead of…Cho? Or Luna?” </p>
<p>“Well, there’s the small issue of me being gay.” </p>
<p>“When did that happen?” </p>
<p>“I dunno, Hermione. When I was born?” </p>
<p>“Harry!” </p>
<p>“What? I’ve the right to get cross when my best friends start questioning my choice in boyfriends. Can’t you be happy for me? You know how long I’ve dreamt of finding someone to share my life with. I thought you two could rise to the challenge of seeing past his masks and share in my happiness.” </p>
<p>“We can, it’s just…why Snape?” </p>
<p>“Why indeed?” </p>
<p>“Severus!” </p>
<p>“Harry. Granger. Weasley. I hate to interrupt this…enlightening discussion, but perhaps I can shed some light on this.” </p>
<p>“Severus, you don’t have to—” </p>
<p>“Evidently I do. I loathe public demonstrations, and I refuse to elucidate the life lessons that have led me to this point, but since you doubt the veracity of my feelings for Harry, perhaps this will persuade you.” </p>
<p>“Severus, what—? Oof!” </p>
<p>“They’re <i>snogging</i>, Hermione.” </p>
<p>“I…Yes, Ron.” </p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Think they’ll stop anytime soon?” </p>
<p>“No idea.” </p>
<p>“Oi! You…you <i>like</i> watching them!” </p>
<p>“They’re quite arresting—”</p>
<p>“Hermione!” </p>
<p>“Apologies if we embarrassed you, that wasn’t my intent.” </p>
<p>“Severus! You love embarrassing people.” </p>
<p>“Normally, yes, but not your friends.” </p>
<p>“Professor. Harry. We’re sorry. We believe and support you.” </p>
<p>“We <i>do</i>? Since when?” </p>
<p>“Didn’t you see that kiss, Ron?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and I’m trying to forget it!” </p>
<p>“Ron. No one could fake that.”</p>
<p>“No, I guess not. Okay, Snape, you’ve our blessing. But if you hurt him—” </p>
<p>“Ron!” </p>
<p>“Sorry, Harry, but it’s true.” </p>
<p>“It’s no less than I’d expect from a loyal friend, Mr Weasley, and I imagine you’d help him if given cause, Ms Granger?” </p>
<p>“Naturally.” </p>
<p>“Hermione!” </p>
<p>“Relax, Harry. Good friends are worth more than all the world’s Galleons. Plus, wait until we visit the Malfoys. Your friends’ reactions will seem calm.”</p>
<p>“Severus!”  </p>
