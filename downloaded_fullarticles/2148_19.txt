    <p> “Welcome back, Auror Potter.” Harry blinked through the ringing in his ears and sat up all the way. He glanced down to his bound hands, the rope surprisingly soft against his wrists as he shifted.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you with us?” The voice asked again, and Harry raised his eyes. A nondescript plain face greeted him. One he didn’t recognize, but the red of their robes signified that they were an Auror as well. Harry opened his mouth to reply, but only wheezed instead. The face gave a quirk of a smile and reached over to the table next to their cushy white arm chair, and picked up the glass of water.</p><p> </p><p>It had a thankful little bendy straw. But Harry merely frowned and leaned back against his own cushy prisons.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, right. Here, let me do the spells…” The person—a man—stated softly as he tapped his wand against the lip of the glass. Showing off the diagnostic spells and the results. It seemed the longer Harry waited to take the straw, the more spells the man kept doing.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Harry leaned forward and accepted the straw. He took a few careful sips before he leaned back. His eyes lifted and he glanced around the room. It was a cramped little office, one he recognized as part of the Auror department. It looked worse for wear, like an explosion had happened in several key points of the office. But overall it seemed functional enough.</p><p> </p><p>“… where are my glasses?” The words tore through his throat, but Harry felt itchy without the familiar weight on his nose. The man let out a relieved sigh and set the glass back on the table.</p><p> </p><p>“I believe that is the result of a… um… muggle procedure?” The man offered, his plain face coming alive with the smile that he now wore. He looked like plain now, merely homey.</p><p> </p><p>Harry cocked his head to the side, “… what?” That was pretty much the sum of things. Why was he here? What was he doing? Why were his hands tied to this chair? And his feet? Harry shifted his feet, and gave the man a pointed look.</p><p> </p><p>He gave a nervous laugh. “Ah, yeah. That. Um—I’m Frank. And, well. Um. What was the last thing you remember?” Well, that was not an answer (or anything even close to an answer) that Harry wanted. But he would take that lead in, as long as he got an answer and was released soon. After all, Harry wanted one to be tied down. He could feel his magic humming in his chest, and if he had to stay bound like this, he was going to break himself free.</p><p> </p><p>Being confined wasn’t in his nature. Not anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah… Dropped my children off on the Express, then came to work for a new assignment… a… a deep cover? To uncover if magic was being used on muggles…” Harry trailed off with a frown. Things were…. Fuzzy, after that. “I can’t… put a finger, on the particulars that is.” Harry clenched and unclenched his fingers had turned his gaze to lock on to the so called Frank.</p><p> </p><p>“Um. Yes. You were given a deep cover mission. They’re normally given to the unspeakables. But you were specifically placed to this one. It didn’t say why in the files. But you were recruited. An honorary unspeakable, yeah?” Frank grinned, although it slowly fell when Harry clearly didn’t share his joy over the matter.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been… cursed?” Harry probed, digging his nails in to his palms as he fought for calm.</p><p> </p><p>Frank scrambled to calm, “oh, no, no—good heaven’s no. Um. Whatever was up down there—the mission that they wanted was to send you to, ah, Germany. Everything else was classified. It’s just. They, um. Did a… mind graft? They needed to have you act a certain way to make you the bait.” Frank looked apprehensive then.</p><p> </p><p>Harry figured he was right to be apprehensive then. He could feel a welling of not-calm in the center of his chest. He clenched his fists harder. And then, silently, with his wandless magic—cut the ropes.</p><p> </p><p>There. A bit better.</p><p> </p><p>Harry took a few calming deep breaths as he moved to clench his hands together over his lap. He took his moment of calm before he held out his hand. Frank silently passed over a wand. Harry’s wand. The wand joyfully let out several happy red and gold sparks before settling down. Harry kept it in hand as he settled back against the chair.</p><p> </p><p>Still, with how things were going… he eyed the black marks on the walls. And the floors. Evidence of an explosion…</p><p> </p><p>Frank followed his gaze, “ah. That. Well—the mind graft was supposed to make you a, well, a muggle. But it seems that your magic was so strong it manifested in a… mysterious way.” Frank gave a little shrug, and Harry reached up and rubbed at his face. When he pulled his hand away, it was covered in… white make up?</p><p> </p><p>In fact… his bare arms—they appeared to be covered as well? They were so much paler than his normal skin tone.</p><p> </p><p>“H.. hey. Before you, um. Figure that out. You need to know that, as a muggle—or at least thinking you were one… you, you uh… slipped your watchers. For a while. It took a, um, long time to track you down.” Frank offered. And there was something about his face. It might be the bigness of his ears, or the strong hinge of his jaw, or maybe even the lightness of his hair, but something was itching at Harry’s mind the longer he looked at him.</p><p> </p><p>But slipping his minders (the thought angered him that he had to have minders — minders were never good at their jobs, not even official Auror ones apparently) while thinking he was a muggle? “Why don’t I remember any of this?” Harry asked hoarsely, even as he used his wand to summon the cup to his hand. His bones felt… tired. He was feeling terribly drained. And… sore?</p><p> </p><p>He glanced down. Hospital scrubs. He must not have come back quietly.</p><p> </p><p>“It was the graft. You had an absence of memories. When the graft was dismantled, the new ones went with it. The unspeakables were going to drain them in to a pensive for your viewing, but, well… you were just a bit too difficult to handle to do that. They were lost in the process.” Frank supplied, twitching slightly at the memory, even as he shifted to stand up.</p><p> </p><p>“There are a few edited reports ready for you. As well as the contents of what was on your person when you were retrieved.” Frank added cheerily. It took Harry a moment before he woodenly stood up as well. He followed Frank’s beckoning hand to a blank space of wall. Harry moved to stand next to Frank, glancing between the other wizard and the blank space of scorched wall. Why were they here?</p><p> </p><p>Frank cleared his throat. “I, um… don’t want you to panic. But… well—“ Frank cut off, and with a few mumbles and flicks of his wand, he transfigured a bit of wall space in to a large mirror.</p><p> </p><p>Harry recoiled—how could that be him?</p><p> </p><p>Purple hair, smeared thick white make up—it clashed terribly with the green-green of his eyes. It was still his face. But… but… Harry paused and shifted a step closer. And then another. He touched make up smeared fingers to his mirror. He could see swaths of his own skin on his face. Where thick make up had been brushed away. Wiped away. The tear tracks. The…</p><p> </p><p>The scars. Harry reached up and brushed away the make up over his forehead. Well, he tried in any case. It stuck like glue. His wand came up and he soon vanished the mess. And recoiled again. The scars… his lightning bolt was there—but the other scars! His face was literred with them! His neck! His arms!</p><p> </p><p>Harry drew in a panicked breath and hauled off his shirt.</p><p> </p><p>It got worse.</p><p> </p><p>He could see his own marks—but these scars were a lifetime of violence. Painted on to his skin. And he couldn’t remember a single one of them!</p><p> </p><p>“Frank—what—“ Harry’s wand was shooting angry red sparks now, which Frank eyed warily.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve uh, been gone a long time, Harry Potter.” The man offered him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s hand traveled over the gut marks over his stomach, short breaths whistling in through his nose. He got enough breath in his lungs to choke out, “how long?”</p><p> </p><p>Frank stood silently next to him, silent long enough that Harry turned and looked to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, um. My name is Frank Longbottom. I’m Neville Longbottom’s grandson.” Frank offered. Trying to be gentle but knowing there was no good way to go about this.</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt like the ground was rolling under his feet.</p><p> </p><p>“If… if that’s the case… Why… My face—I’m not…” Harry choked.</p><p> </p><p>Frank shifted, “yeah, that caused a bit uproar. No one rightly knows why. Exactly. I mean, you were rather young looking when they pulled you in at twenty eight.” He gave a little shrug.</p><p> </p><p>Harry focused on Frank. (Who did Neville even marry?)</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny?”</p><p> </p><p>“Remarried.”</p><p> </p><p>“My children?”</p><p> </p><p>“All graduated. James moved to the Americas. Joined MACUSA and had his family there. Three kids. They seem nice.” Frank offered.</p><p> </p><p>And then Frank didn’t wait for Harry’s questions. “Albus moved to France. He has become a potions master. Rather famous, that one. And Lily—well, she actually became a magizoologist. Currently in Asia, I believe. No children. Neither her nor Albus. I don’t think they’re going to have any.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry slowly dropped down to his knees and pressed his face to the carpet as he focused on breathing. Frank quietly stepped away.</p><p> </p><p>What was he going to do?</p><p> </p><p>… what <em>could</em> he even do?</p><p> </p><p>After a time, Harry looked up to find Frank muscled behind a cramped little desk. Harry slowly rose to his feet and padded over to stand in front of the desk. Frank gave him a smile, “hey. Um, so my shift will be closing soon. This box here is everything you had on you—after it was picked over by unspeakables.” Frank set an old fashioned leather shoebox in front of Harry on the desk.</p><p> </p><p>“And this… creature, was attached to you? It was scanned, and we believe you connected and made it your new familiar.” He offered with a smile. And set down a water tank with what looked to be an… octopus?</p><p> </p><p>Well, Harry was more confused than heartbroken about that.</p><p> </p><p>A small, toy sized motorcycle was placed on the desk next to everything else. As well as a bank card, “this here, um. Modernized Gringotts, you know? Anyway, this is your key and new account. When you were found alive, the department went through and allocated you all your missing pay from… over the years. We placed it in a new account to give you time to… think.” It went without saying that no one had been contacted about his sudden alive status.</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t know if that was a good thing or not. His feet itched for him to run.</p><p> </p><p>A larger part of him just wanted to scream.</p><p> </p><p>“Could I have a sheet?” Harry croaked, motioning to a bit of parchment to the side. Frank nodded and mutely handed it over. Harry transfigured a simply bag and quietly stuck everything inside. He hesitated at the tank, not wanting to upset the creature and his little home.</p><p> </p><p>“It should be fine. The cage has its own gravity, you know?” Frank offered. And Harry tipped it to the side to test. The water didn’t suddenly fall out. Although the octopus swam closer to him, almost preaching the surface of his water.</p><p> </p><p>“Right… right.” Harry nudged the aquarium in to the bag. Frank helpfully added some expansion charms. Harry to the card in hand and stood in front of Frank for a long moment.</p><p> </p><p>“… right.” Harry took a deep breath. “Do I… am I still an Auror? Do I need to debrief?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, you don’t need to debrief. As for your status… it is pending. A lot has changed. And much of the old practices have evolved with the times. You’d have to be retrained, if you’d wish to return.” Frank was reaching for information packets, probably prepared.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head from side to side, “no, no… I’ll just… I’ll just go.”</p><p> </p><p>“… good luck then, Mr. Potter. I’d still suggest a glamor, though.” Frank made a gesture toward his own face.</p><p> </p><p>Harry woodenly complied. And left.</p>
