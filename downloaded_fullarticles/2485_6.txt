    <p>When Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban in 1993, he did not abscond to the forest and live as a dog, brooding about vengeance over Peter Pettigrew. </p><p>Instead, he absconded to a bed and breakfast in the muggle countryside where the owner was an old, blind, woman named Wilma, and asked only for a bed and some papers. And a writing instrument, please. </p><p>Then, he wrote some letters.</p><p>***<br/>October 20th, 1993</p><p>Dear Moony,</p><p>It is I, Sirius, who has broken out of Azkaban! How are you? I am fine. I was not fine for a long time though, because of the dementors and my own self blame and torture, but I feel better now that I am regularly having chicken soup and sunshine! </p><p>I need to tell you that I’m actually innocent! Yes, I didn’t murder Peter, even though I really wanted to! He was the secret keeper, not me. We switched, see. Then he betrayed Lily and James and blew up a street, and transformed into a rat to escape!</p><p>He’s at Hogwarts now, I checked. He’s posing as the pet of a ginger kid called Ronald. The kid has big ears and looks goofy. But his rat is Peter, check his paw! Missing it’s index finger, it is. </p><p>Speaking of kids, I miss Harry. Do you think that you could tell him that I love him very much? I will come to see him once I am free of all charges. I will also come to live with you, is that okay? I don’t want to be alone anymore, so we should live together.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Sirius.</p><p>***</p><p>Remus proceeded to have kittens and showed the rest of the staff the letter. </p><p>The rest, as they say, is history. </p><p>***</p><p>October 22nd 1993</p><p>Sirius Black,</p><p>How dare you shock me half to death like that! We caught Peter, and he’s been turned over to the Ministry. The news should be in the Prophet by tomorrow. He is going to be handed over to the dementors. </p><p>You are going to tell me where you are, and I am coming to get you. How could you be so irresponsible as to not tell anyone about this? I am hopping mad right now.</p><p>I am taking care of the paperwork, and you are now a free man. Write me your return address, and I’ll pick you up. You’d better be in a safe place, otherwise I will be very cross with you.</p><p>Don’t get up to any mischief until I get there. </p><p>Love,</p><p>Remus.</p><p>***<br/>October 23rd 1993,</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>Hello, my name is Sirius Black! You may know me as the formerly-convicted-murderer-who-is-actually-innocent-and-did-not-betray-your-parents. I am also your godfather, which makes you my godson! </p><p>I’m sorry that I haven’t introduced myself for so long, but you know. Azkaban. Anyway, I will see you soon, and we can live happily ever after! </p><p>I am thinking of going to Spain. I heard that it is very warm there, and I think I would like that. We should go there for a vacation! You can bring your friends too, but ask for their parents permission first. I don’t want to go back to the slammer for kidnapping. I am going to bring Remus, because he is my best friend! </p><p>I also have a big honking crush on Remus, so I am going to be very charming! Try not to be blown away. </p><p>Would you like to go to Madrid or Barcelona? I think Madrid would be nice. Write back and tell me your preference!</p><p>Love,</p><p>Sirius.</p><p>***</p><p>October 24th 1993</p><p>Dear Mr. Sirius,</p><p>Hi, it’s nice to hear from you. I was really glad to hear that I had a godfather who is actually not a convict, and am looking forward to meeting you. I think it will be soon, Professor Lupin is being very jittery and doing some packing to come and get you. </p><p>He’s very worried, which makes him testy, so watch out. </p><p>I think it’s nice that you like Professor Lupin, but I think all of seventh year is also crushing on him, so you have competition. </p><p>You really want to take me on vacation? That sounds so cool! I would love to go to Madrid with you and Professor Lupin! You sound really nice, I can’t wait to see you!</p><p>I have to go now, Professor McGonagall is giving me the evil eye for writing this in class. </p><p>Bye for now,</p><p>Harry.</p><p>***</p><p>Dear Harry,</p><p>Madrid it is! Just have to convince Remus to stop being angry and come with us. He’s been yelling at me for two hours, and he just stopped to take a nap. </p><p>I am going to woo Remus back, just you wait and watch! I am very charming! </p><p>I will going to be at Hogwarts tomorrow to see you. I am going to bring you chocolate. Do you like chocolate? I’ll buy treacle tarts too, they were James’ favorites. Lily liked chocolate frogs, but I don’t like chocolate much. It upsets my tummy. </p><p>I’m so excited to meet you, I can barely sit still! </p><p>I have to go now, Remus woke up and is yelling again, but not at me, at some reporters. I’m going to help him yell at them. </p><p>Toodles,</p><p>Sirius.</p><p>***</p><p>October 25th 1993,</p><p>Dear Sirius,</p><p>I know that I’m going to see you in a few hours, but I’m so excited that I couldn’t wait! I’m writing this letter anyway.</p><p>My friend Hermione approves of your plan to woo Professor Lupin, but she thinks you need a plan. We can help you, Hermione is very smart. She’s also planning the Madrid trip for us. Can we go the museum, please? Hermione is very hot for knowledge.</p><p>Hermione is my best friend, along with Ron Weasley, who was the one Pettigrew was staying with as a rat. Ron’s pretty freaked out about that, and really upset. He's made friends with Mrs Norris, and they've taken up rat huning together.</p><p>You don’t have to buy me anything! Gosh, that’s so nice of you! It was nice to find out that dad liked treacle tarts. I do too! And mum liked chocolates? It’s nice to know these things about them that I never knew before, it makes me feel a bit closer to them.</p><p>Looking forward to seeing you,</p><p>Harry.</p><p>P.S. - What’s Professor Lupin’s favorite colour? Neville says that he can grow roses in different colours.</p><p>***</p><p>Sirius came, Sirius saw, and Sirius cried for two hours, hugging Harry the whole while. </p><p>Harry didn’t mind being cried on, not when he cried too. </p><p>***</p><p>There was so much treacle tart. So. Much.</p><p>Sirius bought Ron a tiny owl. Ron thought Sirius was the coolest man ever to walk the Earth, and pledged himself to The School Of Sirius “Wicked Cool” Black. Sirius gave Ron a leather jacket that was too big on him.</p><p>Ron wore it everyday until Professor McGonagall made him take it off.</p><p>Sirius met Hermione, who gave him a detailed plan to woo Professor Lupin and a vacation itenerary. Sirius said that he and Hermione were going to be best friends. </p><p>***</p><p>Draco was following Harry and Sirius around, yelling about things like House honour, and birthright, and Lord Black, and Keys to Black Manor. Sirius listened for ten minutes before asking who he was. </p><p>“I am Draco Perseus Malfoy, of House Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy née Black, of House Black-“</p><p>“Oh, you are my baby cousin,” Sirius said, and gave Draco a long noogie. </p><p>Draco’s screams were music to Harry’s ears.</p><p>***</p><p>Severus Snape did not like Sirius Black. </p><p>Sirius Black did not like Severus Snape.</p><p>Remus was tired of the two men grandstanding in his bedroom over his sickbed, when all he wanted was to sleep. </p><p>“Get out, Snivellus.”</p><p>“No, you get out, Black.”</p><p>“Why are you even here?” Sirius asked, before gasping. “You want to woo Remus away from me!”</p><p>“Tchah! Don’t be ridiculous! I am here to administer Lupin’s wolfsbane!”</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Remus explained tiredly, and by the end, Sirius was convinced that Snape was a greasy but misunderstood soul who really had a heart of gold. Because really, who would help poor Remus otherwise?</p><p>Sirius kissed Snape out of thankfulness.</p><p>Snape checked himself into the hospital wing to quarantine himself. His symptoms were mild delirium, shaking, and his insisting that he had been exposed to a most vile contaminant. Even though Madam Pomfrey told him to go away, Snape insisted on prowling around the hospital wing anyway, in case there were any delayed symptoms.</p><p>***<br/>***</p>
