  <strong>Their Stories since That May Day</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“DRAKE!” More pounding on his door. “Open the fucking door!”</p>
<p>Not bloody likely, Draco thought, glaring at the young man on the other side of the mahogany. He glanced down to make sure the deadbolt and all three locks were engaged. He wished he could grab his wand and hex the arsehole shouting profanities at him (and his door), but that life was locked away in a box at the very back of his closet.</p>
<p>And the last thing this night needed was to cap off with a visit from the aurors.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what he did to deserve this. Will had seemed so <em>normal</em> when they first met. Draco had been going about his business, shelving books at Hollowed Pages, when the attractive bloke with hazel eyes sidled up to him to ask if they had a copy of <em>Maurice. </em>Very obvious, but all right. It had been a while since his last pull. It was almost the end of his shift, and he had been tempted to send him to the fiction section and wait out the five minutes in the staff room, but Mitch the Snitch was eyeing him from the till. So he smiled at the customer and led him to the book himself. He went home thirty minutes after his shift, but with a date.</p>
<p>The next day Mitch had snipped at him that the bookstore was not a match making service. It wasn’t, but it certainly had benefits (the salary not even remotely one of them). The pay was a pittance, but they get free coffee, and employee discounts. Plus, Tracy, the manager, didn’t mind too much that Draco seemed a little slow in some of the simplest things (converting galleons to pounds took some time to get the hang of, okay? And don’t get him started on how long it took to master the coffee machine. Not to mention the nightmare that was the cash register).</p>
<p>In truth, she was convinced that Draco was 1) none too bright (<strike>undiagnosed</strike>/unacknowledged learning disability), 2) and that he was raised an aristocratic snot, who for some reason was living in exile and without common sense so in her mind this was her version of community service. She includes him in her Sunday prayers.</p>
<p>Five years ago Draco would’ve happily hexed them and went on his merry way. But six years (let’s be honest, closer to seven when he was in fifth year) ago, he had not lived through the horrors of war. The Draco Malfoy who was released from a six-month stint in Azkaban was far from the Draco Malfoy who spouted blood purity and derided Muggles.</p>
<p>He practically was one now.</p>
<p>“COCKTEASE! OPEN THE DOOR!”</p>
<p>“Don’t think I won’t call the police, William! Fuck off!” He yelled, bracing his hands on the door to see if his date was doing what he so kindly suggested. Thump! Thump! Thump! The bloody cheek! He kicked the door one more time before raising his hands, middle fingers extended. He did it with so much force he seemed to be having a seizure.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe I missed movie night for this</em>. He shook his head as he moved to the living room. He poured himself some scotch from the sideboard and let the alcohol soothe the frazzled nerves tonight’s disaster of a date brought. His house in St. Albans was small by Malfoy standards. The two-bedroom duplex was quaint. Which was to say miniscule. But it served him well enough. When one lived alone, without even a pet fish to keep him company, one didn’t need more than the essentials. And while the vault his mother had relinquished to his name ensured he needn’t starve, it did not leave much room for a lavish lifestyle (baring the necessity of good alcohol, of course).</p>
<p>Not that society matrons were beating at his door for him to take his rightful place at balls and parties. Being the disowned homosexual of his line tended to eliminate him from the running as an eligible suitor for their precious daughters. He wasn’t the first homosexual in the Malfoy family, of course. Just the first one to be disowned after refusing to deny his sexuality. He was sure several of them had married a pureblooded witch to beget an heir despite their preference for cock. He was simply the first to refuse to do his “duty.”</p>
<p>The Malfoy heir had time to reassess his life. Six months in Azkaban gave you not only the opportunity to truly appreciate warmth and freedom, it also allowed for deep life introspection. And six months was more than adequate to realize that he did not like the person he was becoming. There was only so much blame he could lay on his parents’ indoctrination. As an adult, he needed to start thinking and living for himself. He wanted to be a better person.</p>
<p>And that mean being honest with his homosexuality.</p>
<p>His father had to serve more than six months. Those visits after his decision to be honest were far from heartwarming. Each word that had fallen from his father’s dry and cracked lips chilled him more than the time he spent in his cell.</p>
<p>His mother had done her best. She loved her husband. She loved her son. The last time she allowed her husband to dictate their family’s future, they had suffered under a hypocritical (a half-blood spouting blood purity, really) supremacist’s boot heels. She would not let her husband’s prejudice tear their family apart.</p>
<p>Bad enough wizardingkind spurned the Malfoys at every turn. Doors closed on their faces. Where before they had ruled society with their gold and standing, now they were pariahs. If Lucius was determined to make her son bend by withholding his birthright, she would give Draco what came to hers from the Blacks.</p>
<p>Someone knocked on his door. Draco contemplated the glass in his hand. <em>That better not be Will back, or I just might hex his bullocks off, hang the aurors</em>, he thought. He stood with a sigh and walked toward the door. The upstairs neighbor was smirking from the other side.</p>
<p>“Loverboy’s gone, Drake. Let me in.”</p>
<p>Amy handed him a Tesco bag as she blew past him. “Wine and some crisps. I had a feeling I was going to be hearing about the date when I saw you guys leave. He looked like a right twat.”</p>
<p>He wrinkled his nose. “Did he really? I thought it was good until he drove me home.” The minute Will killed the engine he was on Draco like a perverted octopus. He was pawing his crotch while determining the presence of his tonsil with his tongue.</p>
<p>With familiarity from years of being in each other’s houses, she grabbed a couple of wine glasses from the cupboard and faced him. “Aww. Drakey. You’re very pretty, but you’re an arsehole magnet.” She opened the wine while contemplating what flavor would pair best with the rosé (none, not even the bbq flavored crisps Draco favored). They gathered their supplies and went to the living room.</p>
<p>While complicated machineries were still a little tricky for Draco, he had mastered TVs and DVD players. He had fallen in love with Muggle cinema and had amassed a considerable movie collection. These days, Amy’s penchant for horror movies has rubbed off him and they were in the middle of watching all of Romero’s classics.</p>
<p>“This is your punishment for blowing me off to go out with the twat. You know Fridays are reserved for Zs.” The zombies had given him pause when he first saw them. He had heard of whispers of His Noselessness’ army of inferi during the war. It still amazed him how Muggles get some things almost right, only to miss it completely. But it gave him comfort that a shot to the head or blunt force could stop these undead. He couldn’t imagine coming face to face with a group of inferi and coming out ahead. There was a reason he didn’t have a fireplace.</p>
<p>The petite redhead plopped onto the sofa and hit play. “Besides, the twat looked like zombie chow. You definitely want a badasss who’ll make sure you and your loved ones will make it in the apocalypse.”</p>
<p>Draco shrugged. True enough. Will seemed like the kind of prick who would throw Draco to the horde to buy himself time to get away. But something about Will’s hazel eyes made him say yes to dinner. And he had liked his messy dark hair. He might’ve enjoyed running his fingers through it, but not on the first date. And definitely not on the front seat of his Peugeot.</p>
<p>Onscreen, a car was winding its way on an empty road. “Forget about him and let Uncle George entertain you for the rest of the evening.”</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>“Tell me again, why are we here?” Harry turned to his best friend, who was trying to best to lose himself in his glass of firewhisky.</p>
<p>In front of them, a redhead was gyrating on a small stage to the beat of the music blaring around them. The lights were in synch to the bass, contributing to the migraine Harry felt brewing in his head. The ladies around them gave a raucous cheer as another item of clothing flew across the stage, landing on the head of a blonde Ravenclaw. Luna was enraptured watching her fiancée strip tease for her and fifteen of their closest friends.</p>
<p>Hermione whooped from next to Ron. “Way to go, Gin!”</p>
<p>Harry eyed the shot glasses littering their table. It might be time to cut Hermione off. Next to him, Ron was still trying to find the meaning of life in his firewhisky. He looked around, but found that the small club the couple had rented for their combined hen night was filled with an assortment of inebriated Quidditch players, aurors, and various Hogwarts cohorts.</p>
<p>In a booth further back, Dean was snogging Seamus. If their hand’s locations were any indication, they would soon move out of snogging territory to something that may require Harry to arrest them for public indecency.</p>
<p>Ginny’s friends from the Holyhead Harpies continued to cheer now that his ex-girlfriend started serenading Luna. Harry had to pretend he didn’t notice her skirt slipping lower. Despite the embarrassment (and confusion how he got there), he couldn’t help smiling.</p>
<p>This was a long way from the heartbroken wrecks they had been since the Battle at Hogwarts. For a time it had seemed that everyone was frozen, with no idea how to move forward in a world made poorer by lost loved ones.</p>
<p>It was also a world without Tom Riddle. That was not to say his defeat meant total eradication of prejudice. Years after and they were still in the midst of putting things to right.</p>
<p>But they were moving forward. The first few years had been a blur of grieving, keeping busy and healing. There were still Death Eaters on the run. Trials to attend. Hogwarts to rebuild. N.E.W.Ts. to take.</p>
<p>Several of them decided to finish their education. Hermione knew she needed further training if she wanted to be a healer. Harry, Ron and Neville joined the aurors. Only Harry ended up sticking with the training. Ron had quit to help George with the shop. Neville felt that Herbology was his true calling.</p>
<p>And Harry? He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do exactly. But he was good at catching dark wizards.</p>
<p>He didn’t think he would survive in the Forbidden Forest, and that next day after the battle had stomped him. What does one do with a future he did not think he would have?</p>
<p>Five years later and he still hasn’t got an answer. But he has learned a few things about himself since then.  Not having to fear for your life on a yearly basis gave him the chance to realize his relationship with Ginny would have to remain platonic. They were friends, family even, but they just didn’t have the necessary equipment to satisfy each other sexually. They had a blast exploring Muggle gay clubs together though.</p>
<p>He looked around him. This wasn’t what he envisioned his future would look like when he was camping in the Forest of Dean. The music blasting through the speakers was too loud. The strobe lights were stabbings his eyes and he didn’t want to know what was making the floor so sticky.</p>
<p>He was sitting dateless in his friends’ party because Terry canceled on the last minute, claiming yet another work emergency that could not be put off. But his friends were alive and in love. He wasn’t stuck in a cupboard or pushing daisies from six feet under.</p>
<p>This wasn’t what he thought his future would look like. It was better.</p>
