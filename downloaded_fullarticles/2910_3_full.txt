    <p>The heat of late August made Alexandra
Quick's bedroom a hot, stuffy cell, even with the window open and a
fan blowing. It had been a very hot summer in Larkin Mills, and the
previous day, the air conditioning in their unit had gone out. The
apartment superintendent had called the maintenance contractors, but
said they might not get it repaired until later that day, or even the
next.</p>
<p>Normally, Alexandra would have escaped
the stifling heat of her room by going outside, where at least she'd
be able to feel a breeze, and possibly go hang out at the bookstore
or the SuperMart, or even the mall, but she was grounded –
again.</p>
<p>She'd actually been very good this
summer. She'd been grounded for two days, back in July, for
back-talking her stepfather, but after that, she'd managed to stay
out of trouble for almost two months, until now. Of course, that was
in large part because she spent so little time interacting with her
parents. Her stepfather was a police officer, and her mother was a
nurse, and usually one of them was at work while the other was at
home sleeping. Alexandra took every opportunity to get out of the
small, cramped apartment they'd been living in since their house
burned down last Christmas, so she usually only saw her parents in
the morning or in the evening.</p>
<p>Now, however, she was grounded, and
Archie was home, which meant she couldn't get away with sneaking out,
and she had <i>nothing</i> to do.</p>
<p><i>Not even allowed to practice my
magic</i>, she thought bitterly, twirling her wand between her
fingers as she lay on her bed. It was so tempting to cast one little
spell, just to reassure herself that she still could. She hadn't been
able to do one bit of magic all summer! But she knew that one little
spell would likely result in the Trace Office sending her another
nasty letter for violating the
International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, possibly followed by a
Howler from Ms. Grimm, the Dean of Charmbridge Academy. Alexandra
didn't want to think about what a Howler would sound like in this
tiny apartment.</p>
<p>There was a black flurry of wings at
her window, and then a large raven swooped past her head and landed
on a bedpost, squawking.</p>
<p>“At least you can go out,
Charlie,” she said sullenly. The raven squawked at her again –
a little smugly, Alexandra thought. Then she saw that there was a
small gold chain dangling from Charlie's beak.</p>
<p>“Not again!” she yelled.
She sat up and lunged for the dangling jewelry. Charlie went flapping
up to the ceiling, then fluttered to the top of a bookcase. Alexandra
chased Charlie around the room, slamming the window shut so the bird
couldn't fly back out, until she accidentally knocked the fan over
trying to snatch the chain away. It hit the floor and made a horrible
sound as its blades went '<i>Whack! Whack! Whack!'</i> against the
inside of the wire safety cage, and then the cage split open and the
fan died.</p>
<p>Alexandra cursed, set the fan back up,
snapped the wire cage back into place, and tried to turn it on again,
but something must have broken during its fall. The motor just hummed
ineffectually, while the blades refused to move.</p>
<p>She beat her fists on her desk, and
turned to glare angrily at her familiar.</p>
<p>“Isn't it bad enough I'm
grounded?” she yelled. “Now you're stealing stuff, and
I'm going to <i>die</i> 'cause it's so hot in here!”</p>
<p>She was interrupted by a fist pounding
on the wall. “Alex, what's all that noise? I'm trying to
sleep!” her stepfather yelled from the next room. “I just
got off a twelve-hour shift; is it too much to ask that you give me
just a little peace and quiet?”</p>
<p>Alexandra rolled her eyes and gritted
her teeth. “Sorry!” she yelled back, not sounding very
sorry. “I accidentally knocked something over.” She
turned her head and glared at Charlie. “See?” she
whispered. “You're already getting me into more trouble!”</p>
<p>She raised her arm to her forehead,
wiping away sweat and brushing her bangs out of her eyes, and then
threw herself angrily back onto her bed.</p>
<p>Charlie did not appear moved by
Alexandra's imminent demise, but after a moment, the raven tilted its
head, and then Alexandra heard a jingle as the chain dropped onto her
desk.</p>
<p>Staring up at the ceiling, she said,
“You're going to get me into <i>so</i> much trouble if you do
that at school.”</p>
<p>Charlie squawked, a little more softly
this time. It might have been an apology. Alexandra closed her eyes
and sighed.</p>
<p>Then she heard footsteps, followed by a
knock on her bedroom door. “Come out here, Alex,” called
her stepfather.</p>
<p>Alexandra frowned. Now what? She was
already grounded. Was Archie planning on yelling at her some more?
That wasn't going to help him sleep any better, she thought, but she
knew better than to say so. She sat up, gave Charlie another glare,
and snatched the gold chain off her desk with one quick motion.
Charlie squawked angrily, but Alexandra ignored the bird's protest as
she pulled open a desk drawer and dumped the chain with all the other
trinkets and baubles her familiar had 'collected' over the summer.
She slammed the drawer shut, and then went to open her bedroom door.</p>
<p>Her stepfather stood in front of her,
in shorts and a stained white t-shirt; broad, ruddy-faced, sweaty,
and annoyed. Archie Green had married her mother when Alexandra was
only a few years old, and he was as much of a father as she had ever
known. Now, he looked tired, but mostly he looked exasperated, as he
usually did when trying to deal with his unusual and troublesome
stepdaughter.</p>
<p>Alexandra just stared up at him,
waiting for another lecture.</p>
<p>Instead, to her surprise, he handed her
a wad of folded-up twenties.</p>
<p>“Go to the mall,” he said.
“Get your school clothes.”</p>
<p>Stunned, she took the money as if she
weren't sure it was real. She looked back up at him.</p>
<p>“School clothes?” she
repeated, in disbelief.</p>
<p>“You'll need new clothes for
school, right? You've been talking about it all week. Do you need
your mother along?”</p>
<p>Several thoughts went through
Alexandra's head at once. The first was that Archie was right, except
he hadn't been paying enough attention – what Alexandra had
been talking about all week was her upcoming trip to Chicago to buy
school supplies. Charmbridge Academy would be sending a bus to take
her and other students whose parents weren't able to bring them to
the Goblin Market. Of course, Alexandra didn't mention the Goblin
Market by name, but she had been talking about buying her school
clothes and supplies in Chicago, not here in Larkin Mills.</p>
<p>Her second thought was that Archie was
only willing to let her go on her own so he could sleep. Well, maybe
there was another reason. He probably didn't want to accompany her
while she bought underwear and things, and she certainly agreed with
that sentiment.</p>
<p>Her third thought was that she was
supposed to be grounded, but she decided not to point that out
either. As if reading her mind, Archie said gruffly, “Make sure
you're back before your mother gets home. I don't want another
argument with her. But she's not going to have any days off until
late next week.” He pointed at the handful of bills. “And
that's to cover <i>all</i> of your clothes and school supplies,
understand? Anything that's not covered by your scholarship.”</p>
<p>Alexandra nodded. That meant she needed
to hold onto the money until next week, when she could convert it to
wizard money at the Goblin Market, but for an opportunity to get out
of the apartment, she certainly wasn't going to argue. And she <i>did</i>
need new underwear, which she could just as easily buy here as in
Chicago.</p>
<p>“Can I buy a cell phone?”
she asked.</p>
<p>“No!” Archie snapped.
Alexandra had asked this about a dozen times this summer, and the
answer was always the same. Until getting grounded this week, she had
had hopes that if she managed to keep herself out of trouble long
enough, the answer might change.</p>
<p>“Fine,” she muttered. She
stepped back into her bedroom, and closed the door.</p>
<p>Despite Archie's refusal to bend on the
cell phone, Alexandra's mood had gone from sullen and bored to
gleeful. She smirked at Charlie, and pointed at the large birdcage
hanging by her desk. “Get in,” she commanded.</p>
<p>Charlie squawked indignantly. The cage
was for travel, and a place to sleep, but rarely did Alexandra
actually lock the bird inside it. But Alexandra pointed again,
adamantly. “Now <i>you're</i> grounded!” she said. “If
I leave the window closed, you'll probably die in here, and I'm not
leaving the window open for you to go flying out and steal more junk.
So get in your cage!”</p>
<p>The raven made a rude noise that very
eloquently said, '<i>You can't be serious</i>.' In response,
Alexandra brandished her wand, and growled, “Charlie,” in
her most ominous voice.</p>
<p>Looking highly offended, Charlie hopped
into the cage, and gave Alexandra a resentful, beady-eyed glare, and
another angry squawk as she pushed the cage door shut and latched it.
Alexandra was relieved that Charlie had never called her bluff. Even
if she weren't worried about the Trace Office, she didn't think she
could bear to actually punish her familiar.</p>
<p>“You have to stop stealing
stuff,” she said quietly, as she opened the window to let a
little air back in, and made sure Charlie's cage was positioned in
the shade, and that the bird's water bottle was full. Huffily, the
raven fluffed its wings in response, and seemed to be ignoring her.</p>
<p>Alexandra put on her shoes and socks,
then pulled her backpack out from under her bed, carefully put the
money Archie had given her in one of the interior pockets, and pushed
her wand all the way to the bottom. She then went to the kitchen and
added a juice bottle, some cookies, and a SnackPac lunch to her bag,
and hurried out the door, before Archie changed his mind about
letting her go. As she left, she almost laughed at the irony: she was
grounded because she had gone home and stayed there without parental
supervision, and now she was being released and sent to the mall
without parental supervision because her stepfather didn't want her
at home.</p><hr/>
<p>Her grounding was
totally unfair to begin with. Why did her parents think she couldn't
be left alone during the day? Alexandra was twelve, which meant she
was almost a teenager, which meant she didn't need anyone to watch
her.</p>
<p>At least, that was
how she saw it. Unfortunately, her parents saw it differently. While
Alexandra had always been an extremely independent child, and had
spent more than a few afternoons at home alone because of her
parents' work schedules, they had decided that leaving her
unsupervised all summer wasn't acceptable. They were no longer living
on Sweetmaple Avenue, with her friend Brian Seabury and his
stay-at-home mom down the street, and nearby parks and fields for the
kids to play in. Instead, they were stuck in an apartment in downtown
Larkin Mills. The superintendent didn't appreciate children running
around unsupervised in the complex, and Alexandra's mother didn't
trust her not to get into trouble, hanging out on the streets all
day.</p>
<p>That was how
Alexandra wound up going to Vacation Bible School.</p>
<p>This was, in her
opinion, the dumbest idea her mother had ever had. It was like a bad
joke. Alexandra had never been to church in her life, and she doubted
her mother or stepfather had either. If she'd known what the
alternative was going to be, she might have said yes to soccer camp
or the YMCA summer daycare program, but she wasn't really interested
in soccer, and she knew Brian and Bonnie Seabury, along with Billy
Boggleston and his annoying friends, were going to be at the YMCA
program. Alexandra foolishly thought that refusing those two options
would mean her parents would have no choice but to just let her stay
home unsupervised.</p>
<p>Instead, her mother
had enrolled her in the Larkin Mills Baptist Church's Vacation Bible
School over the summer. Alexandra was horrified.</p>
<p>She did make an
honest effort to behave herself, though. She really wanted a cell
phone.</p>
<p>The first day, she
was sent home with a note saying that shorts weren't allowed; girls
had to wear long pants or dresses. So Alexandra wore long pants, even
in the sweltering heat of summer. One of the other girls whispered
confidentially to her that skirts were much cooler, which Alexandra
supposed was probably true, but she'd wear a dress when hell froze
over. Saying that aloud got her sent home with another note.</p>
<p>After that, she
managed to avoid getting sent home with any more notes, but Larkin
Mills Baptist Bible School was week after week of unending misery.
She wasn't overtly defiant, but the Bible school teachers were very
concerned about her soul nonetheless; she refused to pray or memorize
Bible verses or sing hymns, and she was resistant to all their
'counseling' attempts. She counted down the days until summer would
end and she could go back to Charmbridge Academy, whose teachers were
sometimes just as crazy as those at Larkin Mills Baptist Bible
School, and not always as nice, but at least they taught things that
made sense to her. She wanted to do magic again so very badly.</p>
<p>Then, in the last
week of Vacation Bible School, came the Evils of Witchcraft.</p>
<p>It was Alexandra's
unchurched upbringing that made her Bible school teachers' sudden
assault on magic and witchcraft so shocking. She didn't think Muggles
believed in magic; she never expected to find out that some of them
did, and thought it was all dark and evil. The Evils of Witchcraft
lessons started with a condemnation of a popular children's book
series, which Alexandra had read and found entertaining, albeit
completely wrong in every detail when it came to magic. These books,
the teachers told them, encouraged witchcraft, which led to devil
worship.</p>
<p>Alexandra spent the
next couple of days aghast and appalled. She knew that if she argued,
they'd just think she was lying or crazy. Unless they actually
believed her, which might be even worse. So she folded her arms and
glowered silently, while the teachers talked about all the other
things that constituted 'witchcraft.'</p>
<p>But the last straw
was when Amy Gavello raised her hand and asked if it was true that
the Bible said that witches should be put to death, and one of the
teachers immediately replied, “Yes, thou shalt not suffer a
witch to live.”</p>
<p>A couple of the
other teachers hastily clarified, adding that the Bible also said
<i>Thou shalt not kill</i>, which meant they weren't allowed to go
around burning witches. But then during lunch, Amy and her friends
started talking about witches' familiars, which according to Amy were
actually demons in disguise. Then Davan MacLeod (who made quite a
show of his love for Jesus during Prayer &amp; Confession) said he
thought cats were evil anyway. Then he started talking about the
stray cats and crows he'd shot with his air gun, laughing as he
dramatically described the noises they made.</p>
<p>While the other
boys laughed, and the girls just made faces, Alexandra felt something
snap inside her. Her wand was always in a pocket or in her book bag,
because she didn't like leaving it at home, but she'd never been so
tempted to use it on a Muggle before.</p>
<p>Davan suddenly made
gagging noises and spit up the milk he'd been drinking. Amy did the
same thing, choking on the fruit juice she had just swallowed. Then
one of her friends shrieked and dropped her sandwich as if it had
bitten her.</p>
<p>“There are
<i>worms</i> in my sandwich!” she screamed.</p>
<p>Around the lunch
table, milk instantly curdled, juice went sour, and food became
inedible, rotten and crawling with bugs. Alexandra's erstwhile
classmates ran for the restrooms, or threw up right there at the
table.</p>
<p>Wordlessly,
Alexandra stood up and marched out of the classroom where they all
ate lunch, and left Larkin Mills Baptist Church before any of the
teachers noticed she was gone.</p>
<p>Of course, they
noticed after lunch, and frantically called both her parents at work.
Once Archie and Claudia Green determined that Alexandra had simply
gone home, they told her to stay there, and then her mother and
stepfather both yelled at her, in turn, when they got home. Alexandra
declared that she wasn't going back to Vacation Bible School, that
they'd have to tie her up and drag her there if they intended her to
go, and that if they did, she'd run away from Larkin Mills Baptist
Church as soon as she was able, so they shouldn't even bother.</p>
<p>Since there were
only two days left in the week, her mother told her, furiously, that
if she really wanted to stay home that badly, she could, but she was
grounded until she went back to school.</p>
<p>That
was how Alexandra came to be grounded, and she still thought it was
unfair. What was worse was the fact that she couldn't really tell her
mother <i>why</i> she'd
pitched a fit over the stupid Vacation Bible School in the final
week, after having endured it for almost two months. Her mother and
her stepfather still didn't really know that Alexandra was a witch,
didn't quite grasp that Charmbridge Academy was not a normal school,
and Alexandra had yet to figure out how to explain it to them, or
whether she should.</p>
<p>She
waited nervously all the next day for an owl from the Trace Office to
arrive, or a Howler, but nothing happened as a result of her
spontaneous magical outburst. Maybe they could tell when it was an
accident and wouldn't count it against her, she thought, but she
suspected she <i>was</i>
going to hear about it, sooner or later.</p><hr/>
<p>The Larkin Mills Mall was a new
addition to the downtown area. It had only opened a few years ago,
and had become a favorite hangout of the town's teens. Alexandra
didn't intend to buy much (except underwear), but the air-conditioned
interior would be blessed relief from her stuffy bedroom, and she
could easily spend the few hours she had until her mother got off
work wandering around in the mall courtyards, window shopping, or
perhaps using a few dollars from what Archie had given her to play
video games at the arcade.</p>
<p>She spent about an hour just walking
around, looking in windows, occasionally venturing into the more
interesting stores, and standing in front of the large water fountain
in the center of the mall. Finally, she decided she might as well get
her actual shopping over with, so she headed into one of the two
large department stores in the mall.</p>
<p>Buying underwear, a few extra pairs of
socks, and a hair band (she'd let her straight black hair grow a
little longer over the summer) didn't take long. She carefully tucked
the bag with her purchases into her backpack, making sure the receipt
stapled to the bag was on top, in case someone challenged her on the
way out of the store. As she straightened up, preparing to lift her
backpack off the chair in front of her, she found herself looking
directly at Bonnie Seabury.</p>
<p>Bonnie was Brian Seabury's little
sister. When Brian and Alexandra had hung out together – which
they had done constantly, until last summer – Bonnie had often
tagged along. Alexandra liked her well enough, but hadn't spoken to
her or Brian since December. Brian and Alexandra were no longer
friends.</p>
<p>Alexandra looked around, trying to spot
Brian or his mother, since she knew Bonnie couldn't be here by
herself. When she didn't see them immediately, she looked back at
Bonnie, and thought about going over to say hello, and then saw what
Bonnie was doing. The younger girl was standing in front of a display
of clips and combs and other hair ornaments, and as Alexandra
watched, Bonnie stuffed a sparkling green and silver scrunchie into
her pocket, followed by a black and red satin one.</p>
<p>Alexandra blinked, amazed. It had
always bemused her, how straight-laced the Seaburys were. In fact, it
was Alexandra's own reckless disregard for rules that had contributed
to the demise of her friendship with Brian. (Though a Kappa almost
drowning Bonnie, for which Brian blamed Alexandra, had a lot more to
do with it.) So she was shocked to see Bonnie shoplifting. She looked
around again, and saw the nearest clerk was at a counter on the other
side of the lingerie section, and there was still no sign of Brian or
Mrs. Seabury. She glanced quickly overhead, and saw one of those
black plastic bubbles in the ceiling that hid a security camera. No
telling if it was pointing at Bonnie right now, but the other girl
clearly hadn't noticed it, or thought about store surveillance. They
were in a far corner of the department store, with tall shelves
separating this section from the women's shoe department. Racks of
women's accessories separated them from the rest of the store on the
other side, so it seemed like a relatively unobserved area.</p>
<p>Alexandra walked quickly across the
aisle, between two racks of sunglasses, and tapped Bonnie on the
shoulder. “What do you think you're doing?” she hissed.</p>
<p>Bonnie squealed and jumped almost a
foot in the air, before spinning around to stare at her, red-faced.
“A-A-Alex...andra?” she squeaked.</p>
<p>“Put them back, now!”
Alexandra whispered. “Don't you know there are store cameras
overhead?” And when Bonnie went white and started to look up,
Alexandra hissed, “Don't look at them! Just put the scrunchies
back, now! Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>Trembling, Bonnie reached into her
pocket, and pulled out not two, but half a dozen scrunchies, and
hastily put them back on the rack. Alexandra shook her head. “What
were you thinking?” she demanded.</p>
<p>Before Bonnie could answer, Alexandra
heard Brian say, “Bonnie? What are you doing?” And then
Bonnie's brother came striding towards them, walking between shelves
displaying women's underwear and pantyhose, looking annoyed and
flustered, both at Bonnie and at where he was. “Mom's looking
for you. We –” He stopped, as he saw Alexandra. “Alex?”
Now he looked completely flustered.</p>
<p>Alexandra looked down at Bonnie. Bonnie
looked back at her pleadingly.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”
Brian muttered, unable to think of anything else to say.</p>
<p>They had been best friends, since they
were old enough to walk. They'd grown up on the same street, they'd
gone to school together, they'd explored Larkin Mills together.
Alexandra realized, with a pang, how much she missed being friends
with Brian.</p>
<p>But he'd turned his back on her and
called her a freak. So she narrowed her eyes, and replied, “Buying
underwear. What are <i>you</i> doing here?” She looked
pointedly at the women's undergarments surrounding him, and felt a
bit of satisfaction as his face turned red.</p>
<p>“She's buying panties!”
someone said gleefully, and Alexandra turned around, to see possibly
the only person she wanted to see here less than Brian: Billy
Boggleston. He was with two of his friends, and she realized they
must have seen her in the department store and followed her, since
she couldn't imagine they'd venture into the women's wear department
out of idle curiosity.</p>
<p>Or maybe they'd followed either Brian
or Bonnie, since Billy and his friends were bullies who liked to pick
on other kids. And Billy tended to avoid Alexandra. He wouldn't admit
it, but she knew he was afraid of her. Indeed, at the moment, Billy
was attempting to swagger confidently, while actually looking quite
nervous. But he was unwilling to just walk away while accompanied by
his friends.</p>
<p>Normally, Alexandra would have said
something withering and vaguely threatening, and enjoyed watching
Billy squirm, but she forgot about snappy retorts when she saw that
Billy's friend Tom had picked up her book bag, which she'd left
sitting on a chair.</p>
<p>She looked quickly in all directions,
and saw there were no adults in sight.</p>
<p>“Maybe she's buying a bra, too!”
sniggered the third boy, as if he'd suddenly thought of something
enormously clever and witty. Billy and Tom both made snorting noises,
and for a moment Alexandra felt nothing more than astonishment at how
idiotic and juvenile they were.</p>
<p>Then Billy sneered, “What for?”
with an exaggerated leer at her chest.</p>
<p>Tom started to open her bag, crowing,
“Let's see what color panties she wears!” Alexandra began
turning red, but not just for the reasons they thought. She was less
worried about Tom pawing through her underwear purchases (which were
still wrapped in plastic), than she was about him laying hands on her
wand, at the bottom of the bag.</p>
<p>“Give me my bag,” she
demanded, advancing on them angrily and speaking in a voice that was
calm, quiet, and very menacing. Billy sensed the edge in her voice
that conveyed more than mere embarrassment, and looked as if it was
taking an effort of will not to back away from her, but Tom just
laughed, and turned on his heel. Alexandra realized with dismay that
he was about to take off – probably he'd make a run for the
exit, carrying her book bag with him, and she'd have to chase him all
over the mall unless she were lucky enough to persuade an adult to
intercept him.</p>
<p>Then the female store mannequin behind
him reached down and caught his wrist.</p>
<p>Tom started, looked up to see who'd
grabbed him, and then his jaw dropped. He opened his hand and dropped
Alexandra's book bag immediately. Billy and his other friend looked
as if they might wet their pants.</p>
<p>“Ow!” whimpered Tom.
Alexandra thought he was about to cry.</p>
<p>The plastic mannequin, clad only in a
lacy thong and matching brassiere, raised its other hand, held up one
finger, and slowly and deliberately waggled it in front of the
terrified boy's face, shaking its head. Then it released him. Tom
took one step backward, grabbing his bruised wrist with his other
hand. All three boys stared at the mannequin as if expecting it to
step off its stand and come after them, but it merely returned to its
previous pose and became rigid and motionless again. Then they turned
and ran.</p>
<p>Alexandra dashed over to where her book
bag had fallen, keeping her eyes on the mannequin at all times as she
stooped to pick it up. It didn't move. Then she turned around, to see
Brian and Bonnie both staring at her and the mannequin behind her,
wide-eyed.</p>
<p>She took a breath. “Brian...
Bonnie...” She stepped towards them, and Brian backed away,
pulling his sister with him. “I swear, I didn't do that!”
she said.</p>
<p>“Right,” Brian gulped. He
swallowed as he continued backing away from her. His face was white.
“It's totally normal for store dummies to move by themselves.”</p>
<p>Alexandra shook her head. She met
Bonnie's eyes, then Brian's again. “I <i>can't</i> even do
that!” she protested.</p>
<p>“Like it matters?” Brian
shouted. “Stuff like this always happens around you! Stay away
from us, okay?”</p>
<p>Bonnie, though scared, didn't have the
same angry, horrified look as Brian, but she didn't resist as her
brother took her by the hand and dragged her away. She glanced over
her shoulder at Alexandra as they left. Brian didn't look back.</p>
<p>Alexandra was thinking that Brian's
expression, for a moment, had reminded her of the Bible School
teacher who'd told them <i>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live</i>,
when someone behind her asked, “Is there a problem, young
lady?” She turned around, to see that the store clerk had
finally heard the commotion and made her way over to this section.
She was now looking down at the preteen suspiciously.</p>
<p>Alexandra started to stammer something,
and then another voice asked, “Yes, is there a problem,
Alexandra?”</p>
<p>The saleswoman turned around, and so
didn't notice Alexandra's gasp when she saw the tall, imposing woman
who had just appeared. With her straight black hair, much longer than
Alexandra's, and her high, chiseled cheekbones and sharp nose, she
had a striking profile, and her presence was such that the clerk
actually took a step back, unconsciously.</p>
<p>“We'd prefer that you not leave
your daughter unattended in the store, ma'am,” stammered the
clerk. “We've had some problems with unsupervised children
lately.”</p>
<p>“She's not my daughter,”
said the other woman. “But we were just leaving. Weren't we,
Alexandra?”</p>
<p>Alexandra was still staring at her,
until the clerk turned around, and then Alexandra managed to nod.
“Yes, Ms. Grimm,” she mumbled.</p>
