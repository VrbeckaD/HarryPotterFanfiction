</p><p> </p><p>Ginny plopped down on the couch next to Hermione with two glasses of red wine. “So now that my idiot brother is out of the picture, who are we going to set you up with?”, the sassy redhead asked.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, “Ginny, for the tenth time would you listen, I don’t want to be with anyone right now. I am happy just working and saving money for a house that me and Crooks would love. I was with your brother for five years! I am okay not being in a relationship right now!” Hermione exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny sighed, “Okay but you broke up like four months ago, a woman has needs Hermione, and you need to fill yours.” </p><p> </p><p>Right as Ginny said that Harry walked into the living room with baby James. “Okay James, Mummy is talking about stuff that Daddy definitely does not want to hear about Auntie, what do you say we go obliviate Daddy’s memory so he never has to think of Auntie like that again?” Baby James looked up at his father and cooed. The girls laughed lightly as Harry and the baby went to another room.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on Hermione, there has to be someone that you have noticed that is good enough for at least a one-night shag?” Ginny questioned.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione sighed, “No Ginny, I do not need a one-night stand. I can manage to be single without dating anyone for another year and reevaluate then. Besides, no one wants to date a lawyer! I barely have time to feed Crooks and sleep let alone date and love another person.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny shook her head, “Oh Hermione, when are you going to realize that there are plenty of people around who would be willing to date you. Look at you! You’re gorgeous, and so intelligent! Any guy would be lucky to have you! Come on, anyone from school? I heard Draco is single now that Astoria passed away, you could be rich! Or Blaise, I heard he is very handy with his <em>equipment</em>.” The last word coming out as a whisper. </p><p> </p><p>“Merlin Ginny, I cannot handle your comments about other men’s <em>equipment</em>. I am not a sex-crazed teenager. I am a grown ass woman. I do not need a hasty hook up, I need a life partner. And that can wait another year or two until I am ready! Your brother-”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny interrupted, “Never fulfilled your needs, come on. Admit it. You need someone who can get you off and if that means its some random stranger in an alley then so be it.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s eyes rolled again. She was just about to reply when Harry walked back into the room again. “As I mentioned before, I would love to obliviate myself when you two are done with this conversation I can so kindly hear from every room in the house. Ginny darling, the baby is hungry and I lack the proper <em>equipment.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione and Ginny started laughing. Ginny got up and walked over to the baby who smiled at his mother as she approached. She looked back at Hermione just before she exited the room with baby James, “just think about it, Hermione. Anyone would be lucky to have you.” Ginny walked into the nursery with the baby to fee him. </p><p> </p><p>Harry sat down on the couch adjacent to Hermione and shook his head, “She will never let it go you know. You should probably just fabricate an intricate lie about your love life so she will get off your back. You’re a great catch, someone will find you Hermione. Someone who <em>deserves</em> you. Don’t stress.” He pulled her into a hug.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione smiled at him. “thanks Harry, I appreciate it.”</p><p> </p><p>He nodded, “So, how’s that case you have been working on? It’s crazy that this is even going to trial let alone 5 years after the war, Death Eaters are still going on the stand for the crimes they committed.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione took a sip of her wine and nodded, “I think I may have found a hole in Greyback’s defense. It could turn this whole case over. Turns out the witness he used has a spotty memory of what actually happened and a Doctor that’s willing to bet it was a poor obliviate job. Lucius helped me find the records and is helping me build the case. I really wouldn’t have been able to get this far without him.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry picked up Ginny’s wine glass and took a swig, setting it back down on the table. “It’s crazy what turn of events has happened since the truth came out about the Malfoy’s and their double life. I can’t believe he was actually a spy for the order all this time and we never knew about it. Let alone, Draco never knew about it.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione nodded, “I think the Malfoy family played the Pureblood prick role so well it was easy for Lucius to fall into it. He said that he always knew Dumbledore would come out on top and that Draco would be safe, but he got caught up into the Death Eater role and lost himself along the way. It wasn’t until he lost Narcissa that he realized how badly he made this life for himself. It’s been interesting working in the same department as him. He truly knows how to handle these Death Eater Trials far better than I care to.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow at her, “So Lucius huh?” Hermione shook her head and laughed, “Harry! Really? What do you think I would do with Lucius Malfoy, former Death Eater, current legal advisor for my team?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughed, “I don’t know Hermione, you just seem to talk about him quite a bit. Just thought I would add to the suggestions Ginny so kindly threw out earlier. Plus, you are always way more mature than anyone our age. Maybe an older git would be better for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione shook her head and laughed, “I just happen to see him a lot lately because of this trial. There is no way Lucius and I will become a thing. Which reminds me, I should be getting home. I have a trial tomorrow that I should be preparing for.” She reached over and kissed Harry on the cheek, “Give Ginny and Jamie love for me. I am going to hurry out of here before she finishes with the baby and insists on continuing that conversation.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughed, “you know she will come and find you at work tomorrow!”</p><p> </p><p>Just before she threw the powder into the floo, Hermione laughed, “Oh I am counting on it.” With a flash of green smoke, she was gone. </p><p> </p><p>Crookshanks was sitting on the couch perched waiting for her to return. He meowed at her and stalked into the kitchen as if to say “come along, I require feeding”. Hermione giggled, “Oh Crooks, I missed you.” She picked him up and rubbed behind his ears. He immediately squirmed out of her arms and took off to hide under the bed. “Guess I am not that loveable after all.” She poured food into the bowl for him and hurried into her office to gather her files for the case tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p>She was the lead defense attorney for a young man who used <em>Stupefy</em> in front of a muggle while he was being approached by a Death Eater in a park in Muggle London. The evidence she and Lucius had discovered proved that Voldemort had ordered Fernir Greyback to pick him up and torture him to death in front of other wizards so they would pledge their allegiance to the Dark over the light. Voldemort nor Greyback were expecting the kid to fight back in such a public place. With Lucius help she was able to compile the appropriate list of questions and witnesses that would corner Greyback into admitting his intentions. She was reading over the final touches of her defense when an owl pecked on the window in her office. She smiled, knowing who the owl came from.</p><p> </p><p>She opened the window and grabbed the letter from the owl. She pet the feathers on its head and offered it a treat, “Don’t leave in case I want to reply.” The owl screeched and grabbed the treat from her hand, hastily eating it. She opened the letter: </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>If you are reading this that means you are up late yet again preparing for this case. You have all the defense you need, go to sleep. I’ll meet in your office tomorrow morning first thing and review it with you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Sweet Dreams, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Lucius</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione smiled at the letter. She grabbed a piece of parchment and quill and began to write her reply: </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Sorry can’t read, sleeping. See you tomorrow. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Granger</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She folded the letter up and tied it around the birds’ foot, “Take this to him, I am going to bed now.” The bird turned and flew away. She shut the window, gathered her papers up in a neat pile and stuffed them into her briefcase.  She walked into her room and drew a hot bath with various relaxation potions so she could get a restful sleep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The pure white owl tapped on Lucius’ bedroom window and he laughed. He opened the window and the bird flew in. He removed the letter from his foot and the bird flew away immediately. “If I didn’t know better, I would think that bird had more allegiance to Hermione than to me.” He laughed out loud when he read the letter. </p><p> </p><p>“Sending love notes to your precious tart again are we father?” Draco was leaned against the door jamb watching his father.</p><p>Lucius shook his head, “firstly, she is not my tart. Secondly, they are not love notes. Thirdly, watch your tone Son. You may be as tall and as strong as me now, but I am still quite adept at wandless magic, something you are still learning to master.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco laughed, “When are you going to realize the tension between the two of you couldn’t be cut with a butcher knife. Just shag her already and get it over with.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius shook his head, “Ah I see. Well son, I am capable of having friends of the opposite sex without <em>cavorting </em>with them. It’s called maturity my son. Besides, Granger is your age, it would be extremely inappropriate of me to have my way with her. Perhaps you-”</p><p> </p><p>Draco interrupted, “I am going to stop you right there, father. Granger is an acquaintance. I could never. Besides, I wouldn’t want her thinking of you while we were in bed together. She obviously fancies you. I have been friends with her for roughly 4 years now that the war has been over and she only started wearing skin tight clothing when <em>you</em> came around.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius laughed, “I hardly think she is doing that to impress <em>me</em>, Draco.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco scoffed in reply, “Anyways, I am going on holiday for the weekend with Blaise and Theo and I need the house in Rome to be left undisturbed if you know what I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius chuckled, “I will let the elves know to leave you and your hookers be. It’s been a year son; you should really find a wife.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco called out over his shoulder as he left, “I’ll find a wife if you shag Hermione Granger.” </p><p> </p><p>Lucius sighed, shaking his head. He turned off the lamp above his desk and moved to the bathroom to prepare for bed. After a relaxing shower, Lucius crawled into bed and fell asleep almost immediately. </p>
