  <strong>SHELL COTTAGE, MAY 1</strong>
</p><p>"I'm quite alright, just having an allergic reaction is all." Hermione said annoyedly.</p><p>She crossed her arms in front of her chest as she sent them her best McGonnagall-like stern stare. How dare they question her like this? Who did they think they were? It wasn't her fault her body had started throwing allergic fits every now and then. She couldn't help it and thought them suggesting otherwise to be very rude.</p><p>"My stomach is just fine. Are you seriously fat-shaming me right now? I know I've gained a few pounds, but I really don't see how that's any of your business! If anything you should be happy for me! I'll be needing the extra pounds for the battle."</p><p>"Hermione, it's not th..." Harry cleared his voice, apparently at loss for words while Ron simply stood there, moping at her. This was so not going the way they'd hoped.</p><p>She shook her head at their audacity. What the hell was the matter with them? While she knew Harry and Ron weren't like the perfect gentlemen in the many of books she'd read, they'd never criticized her looks before. Hermione reckoned they hadn't really looked at her at all. They hadn't realized she was an actual girl until their fourth year at the yule ball and that hadn't changed much anyway. So why the hell was it they felt the need to give a damn about how she looked now that they were in the middle of a freaking war, on the lookout for horcruxes? Why did it matter she had gained a few pounds, developed a distaste for some dishes she previously had liked and sometimes was sick at certain times of the day? They were at war, Hermione would have been more worried if she felt fine.</p><p>She sighed at the look of their shocked faces and sat back down by the table. She didn't mean to lash out at them like this, she just couldn't help it. They were about to rob the wizarding bank of Gringotts, not an easy feat considering it had never been done before. It was deemed an impossible task, no wonder she was stressed. "Let's just get this over with." She mumbled, massaging her aching temples with her fingertips.</p><p>"We didn't mean to... criticize you, you know we don't care about... things like <em>that</em>." Harry tried to continue as Ron's ears turned bright red. "We're just worried about you! Are you sure you are up to doing this today? You've been running back and forth from the bathroom ever since we got back from..." - "I'm fine!" Hermione all but shouted.</p><p>"We can wait a day or two if you'd like..." Ron began, but was quickly shut down by another McGonnagall-like glare.,</p><p>"If we are to do this, we have to do it as soon as possible. Seriously, I get that you're concerned and it's not that I don't appreciate... it because I do, but we're at war here. There's no time for trivial concerns when the stakes are so high." Hermione argued, gripping the table so hard her knuckles turned white. Was she the only one who seemed to understand how slim of a chance they really had at getting this right. And that was even if they didn't wait another couple of days. In her opinion they had no choice, it was now or never!</p><p>
  <strong>MALFOYR MANOR, MAY 1</strong>
</p><p>It was a well hidden secret that the Malfoys had a high percentage of Veela in their blood, but it was getting increasingly harder to hide it each day that passed. Especially for Draco who hadn't been experiencing the side effects until quite recently. A recent episode with a certain much despised mud blood hadn't helped either.</p><p>When he wasn't pacing around whatever room his parents enclosed him in, he was frantically surfing through every sort of media out there for news of them, of <em>her</em>. She'd made him go absolutely nuts by leaving so abruptly and he loathed her for it, loathed her for making him go through this. It was like going through puberty again, only fifty fucking times worse. He assumed this must be what cancer felt like. The fact that he knew her leaving actually was for the best didn't help one bit.</p><p>At this hour he was busy reading through the newspaper article for what seemed like the three hundredth time that day. Even the moving picture of the golden trio escaping the bank of Gringotts on a freaking dragon had started lagging. While the quality of the picture hadn't been the best in the first place, Draco was still convinced he could tell that little miss Granger seemed to be in a not too good state. Blast it all. It would be pretty fucking pathetic, not to mention impractical, if she died before the actual battle were to take place. He couldn't have that.</p><p>He rushed out of his chambers just in time to run into Snape. Their eyes met and for a second Draco could swear Snape knew exactly what he was up to and where he was headed. Even worse was that he didn't think Snape seemed inclined to stop him, although he knew what impact his actions could have. He simply gave Malfoy a short nod before hurrying on to wherever it was the Dark Lord had summoned him to. It put Draco off for a good twenty seconds before he came to it and continued down the hall.</p><p>The dark lord had issued an order, commanding everyone that supported him to gather around Hogwarts. Draco wanted to get there before they did. He knew the golden trio would show up too when they realized their friends at school were fucked. It wasn't something he supported; he didn't actually want the Dark Lord to win, but seeing how he was pretty sure he would, he couldn't make himself known a traitor just yet. That was why he let himself out of the manor at the middle of the night, he didn't want anyone to know. He would do whatever necessary to save the skin of himself and those he cared about. And while the smartest thing for him to do now was to be safe and go with the flow. He sure as hell wasn't going to help that Psychopath.</p>
