    <p>"That is our new professor of Charms, she is from Ilvermorny" McGonagall leaned over the empty space at the dinner table where the new teacher would presumedly sit. </p>
<p>Severus looked down at the woman swiftly making her way up to the table. He could barely see her, just a flurry of long black robes covering scurrying feet. She emerged from the sea of students, no taller than they were, curls flying behind her in well sprung ringlets in a thick sprawl of wildflower honey brown. He could read the panic on her ovular face at being late, full lips parted as she kicked up the pace to seat herself with the already seated professors. </p>
<p>She made her way past all of the staff, smiling warmly, still slightly frazzled while shaking hands. She gave a hug to Minerva and to Miss Granger, who was also new on staff this year. </p>
<p>He made eye contact with her as she sat down beside him, the swish of air bringing notes of honeysuckle and musk. She must have been walking through the gardens. He could hear one word chanting faintly through her mind "late late late." </p>
<p>She offered a small smile and a head tilt to him by way of recognition, turning forward as Minerva began to speak to the students and he was faced with a wall of silence. </p>
<p>"Welcome back to Hogwarts, we are incredibly excited to welcome back our students after spending a year away in order to heal from the war. </p>
<p>We have completed renovations to our home as well as remembering our sorrow at the lives lost within its walls. We don't take lightly the trauma that everyone has faced these past eight years and as headmistress, I guarantee you that we will be doing everything in our power to bring life back to normal and back to the security to which we are accustomed. </p>
<p>I want you all to welcome Professor Hermione Granger to our staff, as professor of Magical and Muggle history. We are making strides to become more inclusive in our education and we are sure that Professor Granger will succeed."</p>
<p>She paused for a raucous round of applause and hollering before continuing kindly</p>
<p>"I would also like to introduce Professor Serena Barrett. She has graciously moved here all of the way from America, at Ilvermorny, where she has spent the last ten years as their Charms professor as well as the head of Pukwudgie house. Her work in memory charms reversal and empathic energy healing is nothing short of revolutionary. Please join me in welcoming her to our beautiful home."</p>
<p>The hall burst into happy applause at the new additions. Two brilliant women to push their world forward. </p>
<p>However, there was some nervousness in the shifting eyes as the students weren't sure whether or not to look at Professor Snape. </p>
<p>Of course the news outlets had heard of Snape's bravery. They had latched onto him being a hero, a double agent for good. The tragedy that had been his loss. The tabloids had run stories for weeks, which ran Severus Snape as far into hiding as he could get. His worst life choices fodder for the media. </p>
<p>He wasn't a seeker of fame. He hated being plastered on the front of papers. But damn did it feel good inwardly to finally be vindicated against all of those who openly sneered at him. To those who called him a coward. To those who called him a snake. </p>
<p>He knew it was the right precaution to take a Bezoar stone with him at all times, as well as a blood replenishing potion. He owed his life to Miss Granger for her quick Muggle sutchering skills as Potter took the memories to the Pensieve. She had held his gaping neck together, cauterizing his artery and veins with her wand while pulling needle and thread from her bag. </p>
<p>He begged her to let him die, in the moment his pain was so great and his embarrassment mighty. She told him to shut his mouth, it was hard for her to sew skin in the first place. He would forever have a haggard looking scar down his neck, but he had his life. </p>
<p>Now, a year later he was still dealing with the fallout. He was willing and ready to fade into obscurity, his name possibly bringing a dark shadow to Hogwarts. </p>
<p>However, Minerva would have none of it. She knew they would never find a competent potions Professor like Severus anytime soon. He admitted that her defense of him warmed his cool soul. </p>
<p>"I would also like to bring attention to Professor Snape. As you all now know, he risked his very life in service to this school, to our teachers, and to you, the students. He was awarded the First Order of Merlin. War brings about horrible choices, choices that none of us should have to make. Severus made the best choice that he knew. </p>
<p>I trust him implicitly, as I always have and as Albus Dumbledore did; even to trusting Severus with his life. Albus gave his life for this school and he placed his trust in Severus to do his will. I want you all to show him the same respect, it is what he deserves" she said sternly, making deliberate eye contact with every student. </p>
<p>Severus looked down at the table. He didn't need some splashy show of acceptance but he knew that the students did, especially the ones who had been there during his stint as headmaster de facto. He had played his role well, definitely too well. The lines between his two lives blurring more by the day. </p>
<p>He hadn't wanted to do it, but Albus understood when he heard that Draco was supposed to kill him. Neither man wanted Draco to be saddled with that burden for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Severus was used to sacrifice, but this had been beyond the scope. He had to murder his best friend. The man who had given him a second chance. Been his confidante. But who also had placed him in such a precarious position.  He still had nightmares about that night. </p>
<p>The jovial tone soon returned as the food appeared and the conversation flowed. He picked up his silverware, keeping quiet. He didn't feel as if his sour attitude was justified anymore. The war was over. He could be whoever he wanted now. He could find what it meant to be happy, finally. The thought petrified him more than his years of service. </p>
<p>"I'm Serena. It's nice to meet you" came a low voice from his left. It was quiet and clear, but tinged with hesitation. </p>
<p>He offered a small smile and head nod. She held his gaze for two extra seconds, not hostile or sympathetic, just seeing him. She was young, maybe thirty. He was forty but he felt so much older. So much more tired. He could still smell the honeysuckle. </p>
<p>He snuck a glance at her again as she began chatting happily with Hermione, casually tossing her curls back over her shoulder. He noticed a moonstone ring on her right ring finger, which was tapping in a rapid cadence. If her choice of stone said anything about her personality, it would be that she was calm and peaceful while bringing about harmony. Her fingernails were painted mulberry wine, perfectly filed. He never understood that Muggle practice of coloring ones nails. Most witches didn't bother. Perhaps he should ask about it sometime. </p>
<p>She turned back towards him, leaned in close, and offered kindly</p>
<p>"I would be honored to have tea with you soon Professor. Or something stronger if you prefer?" </p>
<p>He didn't know how to respond, he had no narrative within to frame his life anymore. Had she asked any other professors to tea? Why would she just ask him? What could she possibly want? He had nothing worthwhile to offer now. He could make choices to suit his own wants. He could make friends now without worrying that they would be killed for information. There were endless directions and no particular goal. It was terrifying. </p>
<p>"Perhaps tomorrow?" he offered slowly, his voice still slightly rusty from lack of use. He had holed up at his home, books keeping him company for the better part of a year. </p>
<p>She tilted her head, standing up, placing a slim hand on his arm for the briefest of seconds. He stared at his arm, skin burning. No one had touched him willingly, or without intention to harm for years. </p>
<p>"She's very kind, isn't she?" Hermione remarked, a gentle smile crossing her face. </p>
<p>Severus noticed the scars across her neck and arms from Bellatrix, she wasn't ashamed of them. He, on the other hand, did his best to hide his scars. His were not so noble. </p>
<p>"Still putting your nose in where it doesn't belong I see" he snapped, his usual sarcasm toned back. </p>
<p>She rolled her eyes "You don't scare me anymore. And, you don't have to. Perhaps you would do well to remember that."</p>
<p>"What a shame" he drawled, pushing back his chair. </p>
<p>He had had quite enough of people for tonight.</p>
