    <p>French might not have been your first language, but it was your favorite. You had always found a certain elegance and gracefulness in the dialect that left you speechless, like pure honey dripping from the tongue of a lover — sweet, refined, and heavenly. </p><p>You were sure that studying the language had been one of the best decisions you had ever made.</p><p>Sitting at your desk, alone in the dimly lit studio apartment you had called home since graduating Hogwarts three years prior, you poured over your notebook from this week’s lecture. </p><p>“Untranslatable words and phrases,” you whispered to yourself, lightly tracing your pointer finger over the delicate curves made by your pen.</p><p><em>L’ésprit d’escalier</em>, the feeling of finding the perfect retort too late, literally translated to read “staircase wit” in English. </p><p><em>L’appel du vide</em>, “the call of the void.” A term used to describe the sudden, inexplicable impulse to jump when in a high place.</p><p><em>La douleur exquise.</em> </p><p>You licked your lips, eyes focused and unwavering on what had to be most eloquent of French locutions. </p><p><em>La douleur exquise</em>. “The exquisite pain.” A phrase used to describe the heartache and pain of wanting someone that you can never have.</p><p>What a beautiful, powerful phrase, however lucid on your own account. </p><p>You could never have <em>him</em>. </p><p>He had been yours at one point, that much was true. You had held him so close for so long, he practically lived within the beating walls of your heart; weaved his way through your ribcage and mended himself with your now aching soul. Even now, years after parting ways, he was right there, buried deep inside of your chest. </p><p>He would always be right there. </p><p>Pushing away from your desk, you rose to your feet, walking the short distance to your open window. You sat on your windowsill, throwing one leg over the ledge before letting your back rest against the wooden side. Shoving your hands deep within the pockets of your hoodie, you looked out over the quiet street, a view you would never grow tired of. </p><p>A cobblestone road lined with historic brick homes, most of which had been converted into apartments long ago, and beautiful trees planted in spaces amongst the sidewalk. The leaves had just begun to change color, vibrant orange replacing green. Their striking hue mixed with the soft glow of the street lamps and the sparkling navy blue sky overhead would never cease to fill you with contentment and joy. Autumn had always been your favorite, after all. The delicious bite from the crisp morning air, and foggy nights spent indoors with a cup of hot cocoa in hand. Perfect. Blissful. </p><p>A ding from your phone alerted you to an incoming text message. You continued to sit on the windowsill, staring at the phone lying on the nightstand and debating whether or not it was worth getting up to see who needed what. After a second chime sounded throughout the room, you decided it would be best to check.</p><p>With your phone in hand, you plopped onto your mattress, effectively disturbing the previously unwrinkled blankets and pillows. You smiled as your best friend’s name flashed across the screen. Sliding the notification to the left, you began to read her messages.</p><p>“<em>Met the cutest guy down at The Connaught,</em>” the first one read. “<em>Care to help a girl out? Come down here and be my wingman? X.</em>”</p><p>You rolled your eyes before typing a quick reply, your tongue caught between your teeth. “<em>What are you doing down at The Connaught? Isn’t that hotel and bar meant for classy folk, unlike yourself?</em>”</p><p>You stifled a laugh at your own response, the bubbles to signify that she was typing popping up not a second later. </p><p>“<em>Very funny. Will you please just get your ass down here? You could wear that new dress of yours…</em>”</p><p>You sighed, looking towards your closet where the dress in question had been hanging since you purchased it four months prior. You could almost hear it begging to be worn. Biting your lip gently, you made your decision. </p><p>“<em>Fine. I’ll be there in an hour. But you’re buying my first drink!</em>”</p><p>Hastily throwing your phone onto your bed, you practically skipped to your closet, pulling the garment from its designated hanger. You held it up to admire it for a moment before hugging it your chest, a beaming smile plastered on your face at the chance to finally wear it. It was a beautiful, black gown made of chiffon, with thin straps and a deep neckline. It was love at first sight upon seeing it in the shop window, you just <em>had</em> to have it, and now, you were so glad that you did. </p><p>“Hello there lovely, I do believe it’s about time we show you off.”</p>
<hr/><p>Within the next hour, you were walking through the doors of The Connaught, high-heels clicking against extravagant marble floors. The Connaught was one of the fanciest hotels in London, and their bar was known for being one of the best in the world. Everything was sleek, shiny, and new. </p><p>Entering the renowned bar area, you scanned the room briefly, almost immediately spotting your friend. She quickly waved you over, and you approached with a wide grin on your face. </p><p>“Thank you, thank you, <em>thank you</em>,” she chanted upon pulling you into a tight embrace, to which you returned. </p><p>“Like I said, you’re buying my first drink.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, a playful smirk adorning her lips. “Of course.”</p><p>You quietly chuckled, letting your friend guide you to where she had previously been sat amongst one of the lavish black leather couches. She pulled you down to sit beside her, and you had to fight the urge to lean back into the comfortable sofa. </p><p>“So,” you started, taking her wine glass out of her hand and stealing a sip. “Who is the lucky man of the night?”</p><p>Your friend squealed, clasping your free hand tightly in her own. “Okay, okay. You see that handsome blonde standing at the bar behind us?”</p><p>You discretely turned, a head of platinum, nearly white, blonde hair coming into view almost immediately. You frowned at the familiar color, feeling a deep ache within your chest, as if someone had just wedged a large stone between your ribcage. You turned back to your friend, nodding gently. She didn’t seem to notice the grimace currently plastered on your face. </p><p>She squealed again, and you had to stop yourself from rolling your eyes at her behavior. </p><p>“He’s so attractive, I just have to introduce myself.”</p><p>“So why haven’t you done so already? Why did I have to come all the way down here to introduce you only to have you ditch me the moment he pays you an ounce of attention?”</p><p>She frowned, removing her hand from yours. “Um, are you alright?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” you mumbled, stealing another quick glance towards the blonde man. “Just…nevermind. I’m sorry. Let’s go and introduce you, shall we?”</p><p>Your friend nodded, rising to her feet as she took ahold of your hand once more. You took the lead, guiding her towards the bar. You didn’t look towards the blonde as you approached, instead grabbing the attention of the bartender. </p><p>“Two glasses of the Chateauneuf du Pape ‘Tradition’, please,” you requested, having only glanced at the red wine list for a moment before placing the order. </p><p>“On me,” a voice from beside you spoke. </p><p>Two words caused you to freeze completely as the familiar, sharp voice infiltrated your senses. A voice you would recognize anywhere. You would have recognized it had he only muttered a single syllable. </p><p>You didn’t dare glance to your left, knowing his gaze would be set on you. You felt your friend place her hand on your shoulder, and although you heard her speak, you weren’t exactly sure what she had said. You kept your eyes focused on the countertop in front of you. Your heart was pounding, and you were sure that it was about ready to come flying out of your chest. The blood running through your veins felt like ice water, and you felt the hair on the back of your neck stand to attention at the sound of his voice. A voice you hadn’t heard in so long.</p><p>A voice that freed you from your trance, as he spoke your name. Oh, how you had missed the way your name fell from his lips. And his touch, how it instantly turned the ice into a raging fire, heat flooding your body as you felt his hand rest on the small of your back. You let out a breath you didn’t realize had been trapped within your lungs, turning your head until your eyes met a pair that resembled storm clouds. </p><p>His eyebrows were furrowed in concern, his eyes searching yours frantically as his other hand found its place on your waist, where it had always fit so perfectly. You swallowed the lump in your throat. </p><p>“Draco.”</p><p>His eyes fluttered shut at the sound of his name leaving your mouth, and you watched his Adam’s apple bob in his throat as he swallowed thickly, inhaling and exhaling deeply a moment later. </p><p>“Y/N,” he whispered this time, as if speaking your name too loud would cause you to flee; as if it would startle you like some frightened animal. His grip on your waist tightened just slightly, his fingertips digging into your sides in a way that wasn’t uncomfortable, but reassuring. </p><p>“Um, excuse me…” your friend spoke from behind you, causing Draco’s eyes to snap open, although they didn’t stray from your face. “Y/N, you know this man?”</p><p>You nodded, pulling your bottom lip between your teeth. “We went to the same school and-”</p><p>“We were together for four years,” he interrupted, letting the hand on your waist fall as he turned you to face your friend, although he continued to keep his other hand on your lower back. </p><p>Her eyebrows shot up in surprise, and she raised her glass of wine to her lips. </p><p>“Mmm,” she hummed, taking a brief sip. “Well that would explain…whatever that was that just happened.”</p><p>Your cheeks reddened, and your cast your gaze to the floor. You felt Draco’s chest vibrate with a brief chuckle. </p><p>“Yes, well,” he started, rubbing circles into your skin with his thumb, causing a shiver to shoot down your spine at the simple action. He never finished his statement, although you could feel his eyes on you.</p><p>“I’ll just…” your friend muttered, shrugging her shoulders and tilting her head towards where the two of you had been sitting just minutes before. “Be over there.”</p><p>You nodded, your eyes still cast to the floor. Once she retreated back to her seat, you felt Draco wrap his hand gently around your wrist, spinning you back around to face him. He kept his eyes locked on where his skin met yours, head tilted down and to the side. You finally tore your own eyes away from the floor, and upon feeling your gaze rest on his face, he looked up, keeping his head down for a short period of time before righting himself. He cleared his throat, letting go of his hold on your wrist to straighten out his suit jacket, though there was no need to do so. His attire was impeccable, as always. </p><p>“Would you care to sit with me?”</p><p>You felt yourself nod without a second thought, and he guided you to a pair of bar stools, where he waited for you to sit before taking his own seat. His eyes never left your form, as yours never left his.</p><p>You continued to stare at each other for several moments, fully taking in each other’s appearance. He looked well, amazing even. Beautiful, as he had always been. His hair was shorter than it had been the last time you saw him; brushed neatly and styled to the side. He had some light stubble, which you would have thought to be out of character before, but it truly looked as if it had always belonged upon his face. He looked like the same Draco you had known years ago, only older. Same stormy eyes, same platinum hair, same pale complexion. But, you could tell that he wasn’t the same, not really. There was something different about him, but you weren’t sure exactly what. </p><p>He was the first to speak, his hands coming to rest over your folded ones which were placed on top of the bar. “How have you been?”</p><p>You shook your head slowly, lips pursed, meeting his question with your own. “What are you doing here? At a muggle bar?”</p><p>“I could ask you the same, although I suppose I already know. So the rumors are true, then?”</p><p>“What rumors?” you mumbled, furrowing your eyebrows in confusion.</p><p>Draco tilted his chin down, dropping his voice not only in volume, but also by an octave. “You’ve left the wizarding world? You snapped your wand in half and have sworn off magic?”</p><p>You looked away, sighing softly while also nodding. “That would be correct.”</p><p>He frowned, shaking his head gently. “Why? I mean, what drove you to give it all up? You wanted nothing more than to become a professor…”</p><p>“There was <em>one</em> thing I wanted more than that, Draco,” you hissed, your voice coming out sharper than intended, like knives. </p><p>Silence fell over the both of you, neither of you knowing what to say, but having so much to vocalize at the same time. You decided to change the subject. </p><p>“How are your parents?” you asked, taking a quick sip from your still full glass of wine.</p><p>Draco flinched, and if you hadn’t been so focused on him, you were sure that you would have missed the quick movement. </p><p>“I couldn’t tell you,” he mumbled, shrugging his shoulders indifferently. “I haven’t seen them since the trials.”</p><p>Neville had told you of the trials the Malfoy’s endured after the war, but you hadn’t been in attendance, something that you had always felt guilty about as years passed. You only justified your absence based off of the fact that the breakup, mutually understood but never verbally expressed, was still fresh, and you were grieving the loss. Grieving not only for the loss of your lover, but for the lives lost in the battle. Your friends who would never see another day, classmates you had passed in the halls for years. </p><p>Still, you couldn’t help but to think that you should’ve been there. </p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” you muttered, removing one of your hands from underneath his to place it on top, squeezing gently. </p><p>He shrugged it off, giving you a soft smile that you knew was anything but genuine. Before you had time to comment on it, however, Draco was speaking.</p><p>“Would you like to continue this conversation somewhere else? We could go back to my place?”</p><p>Butterflies erupted in your stomach at the prospect of being alone with him. Whether said butterflies were positive or negative, you were unsure. Perhaps it was a healthy mixture of both; enough to keep you from doing something you would regret, but enough to drive you through it. </p><p>“Actually, how about we head to mine? It’s only a short drive, ten minutes tops.”</p><p>Draco smiled, a genuine one this time, and nodded his head once, extending his hand towards the exit.</p><p>“Sounds lovely. Lead the way.”</p>
