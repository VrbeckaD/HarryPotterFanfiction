    <p>As Remus stared up at the enormous castle, a feeling of dread settled in his stomach. Caramel locks caressed his cheek as the wind tousled his unmarked robe, sending a shiver down his spine. The excited chattering of his peers danced on the breeze, tickling his eardrums, and the saline taste of the ocean bit his tongue. A doors deafening creak shocked the new students into silence, as a slim figure glowered at them with seeming disdain. The glare came from a middle aged witch dressed in an emerald cloak and square glasses, with her dark hairs pulled taught against her scalp, coming together to form a sturdy knot on the back of her skull. The quiet was quickly interrupted, however, by gasps of awe as the students gawked at the sight before them. They were greeted by stone walls, lined with rustling tapestries and candles that hung, floating, in the air above their heads. They were quickly ushered in by the woman, who identified herself as “Professor McGonagall” and introduced the preteens to another sight. Two long, crowded tables lined the narrow room, groups of teens in matching robes staring excitedly at the first years who stood anxiously together.</p><p>	Professor McGonagall made a show of introducing a tall, bearded man with silver hair and round glasses -- "Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts." After the mans brisk preliminary speech, McGonagall took over and, soon enough, the students found themselves seated alone beside the elder witch, facing the crowd as they were sorted into one of the four houses. Each student skipped excitedly to and from the stage, greeted by their fellow Slytherins, Gryffindors, Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs with enthusiasm. </p><p>Remus, however, didn't march, haphazardly, to the sorting hat with excitement, nor did he elegantly find his way to perching upon the seat. He simply proceeded forward as neutrally as possible, head bowed and shoulders slightly hunched so as not to draw attention to himself -- although that was impossible in his situation. As he sat below the sorting hat, he could hear whispers from the students below, and he found himself immediately more conscious of his scars. Meanwhile, the hat seemed to alternate between Ravenclaw, for his “acute intelligence and wit”, and Gryffindor, for his “seemingly inherent protective nature” (this, of course, crushed all of Remus’ hopes that he might be placed in Hufflepuff, which he had determined -- through strenuous research -- to be the safest house at Hogwarts). When he was placed in Gryffindor, the feeling deep in his stomach seemed to increase tenfold, and he found himself walking numbly to the Gryffindor table with little commotion beyond an applause and a few approving shouts.</p><p>Luckily for Remus, his presence was quickly forgotten as a few celebrities took the stage. The first, Sirius Black, an admittedly handsome fellow with an unfortunate reputation; triumph and a trace of fear painting his face after he was placed in Gryffindor. Peter Pettigrew, whose lengthy placement settled a nervous atmosphere over the entire room. And James Potter, who sauntered up to the hat with a wink in the direction of a very unimpressed Professor McGonagall. He was quickly placed in Gryffindor, galavanting to the Gryffindor table after blowing a kiss to the headmaster, who chuckled in response. When the ceremony was finished and the students were permitted to eat, Remus retreated into his shell with an empty plate before him.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to eat?”</p><p>Remus turned toward the voice, finding himself face to face with the pretty Gryffindor beside him. Gentle waves of red hair framed her face, complementing the glittering, emerald eyes that peered curiously at him.</p><p>	“I’m, uhm… Too nervous.” The girl nodded, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear before continuing her meal. </p><p>After a few moments of staring off into space, Remus looked down at his plate only to find a few slices of ham, fried potatoes, a biscuit and a chocolate cupcake sitting upon it. He glanced over to the girl next to him, only to find her chatting with the upperclassmen across the table and paying him no mind. He picked up the fork beside his plate, cutting into the cupcake and taking a bite. The rich flavour melted over his tongue, and tears began to form at the corners of his eyes as memories of his homelife -- both bitter and sweet -- overcame him.</p><p>	He was seated on the couch, sipping hot chocolate as his mother read him classic poetry. He was in the kitchen helping her bake cookies, secretly snacking on the chocolate chips while she placed them in the oven. He was curled up in bed on the morning of his birthday, the scent of chocolate cake wafting through their small home, prompting him to wake up. </p><p>	He was sitting at a mahogany table, surrounded by strangers, licking chocolate frosting off of a fork with red, teary eyes. 

When he realized what he was doing, he set his fork down and glanced up, only to find a few of the surrounding students staring at him. Once again he became uncomfortably aware of the blemishes that scored his skin.</p><p>	“I’m Lily, by the way. Lily Evans.” Remus turned to face the girl again, immediately averting his gaze downwards. “And you are…”</p><p>	“Oh, uhm… Lupin -- Remus Lupin. Pleasure.” The conversation ended as abruptly as it began, Remus turning his focus to a wall behind the Slytherin table, and the redhead, Lily, returned to her conversation.</p><p>	When the feast concluded, the students were escorted to their respective dorms. Remus set to unpacking, ignoring his dorm-mates as much as he could. He hung up his robes, folded his spare trousers and socks, and placed them in the drawer of his night stand, stacking his books on top of it. When he finally finished, he hid behind the curtains of his bed to review his schedule before going to sleep. And as he lied in his bed, staring at the above canopy, he once again felt tears well up in his eyes -- the unfamiliar scent of the new sheets making it nearly impossible to get a good night’s rest.</p>
