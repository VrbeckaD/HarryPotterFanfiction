    <p>“Please, enlighten me on why you’re so stupid! Why didn’t you go directly to Madam Pomfrey!” </p><p>“Well, if I had to show her my injury, I’d have to tell her where I was…” Charlie avoids your eyes, trying to nervously laugh off the tension despite being so confident you’d help him without thought before. “Which is something I don’t want her to know.” </p><p>“What were you doing, <i>Charles</i>?” He side-eyes you as you say his full name, knowing it’s an indicator of your annoyance. </p><p>“I was just… searching for dragons.” </p><p>“Oh, I could’ve figured that one out. <i>Where</i> were you doing that?” He sensed that you likely already knew the answer, but much like his mother, you were going to wait for him to incriminate himself. Also much like his mother, there was no escape from your gaze, and no way for him to possibly avoid answering your question. </p><p>“The… Forbidden Forest?” He says fire flare in your eyes but you say nothing, yanking at his arm and bringing the tip of your lit-up wand to it to observe the damage. </p><p>“Do you think it’s broken?” He shakes his head. “Then I guess I’ll be able to heal it just fine. I do need to sneak into the dungeons to get a few things from the ingredients cabinet, I guess if I’m quiet enough no one will bother me. Can you wait here?”</p><p>He was hidden away in a dark corner, so it wasn’t likely a professor would drop upon him and notice him unless they specifically looked in this dark corner. He nods his head, having already had to wait a decent amount of time to find a student walking out of your common room, asking them to retrieve you as quickly as possible. He leans his back against the wall and waits patiently as you disappear, the stinging in his arm dying down (though even the slight brush of his robes is enough to get the pain roaring up again). </p><p>He’s relieved to see you as you round the corner, not talking to him but going straight to work (he knew despite your cool attitude, you weren’t interested in getting either one of you in trouble). He admires your handiwork as you heal his wound, doing your best to close it up and then cover it with a slightly smelly paste that seemed to soothe the burning skin. </p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were going into the Forbidden Forest?” You sound a bit disappointed, much to Charlie’s delight. You might scold him for the time being, but it was clear you were jealous he didn’t invite you on his latest adventure. </p><p>“I didn’t want you to worry.” You help him stand up, checking the wound wrapping again as he continues to talk. “I’ll invite you next time; real useful to have a healer. I guess you’re good company, too!” </p><p>“You guess, huh?” You roll your eyes, “How could you ever survive without me, Charlie Weasley?”</p>
