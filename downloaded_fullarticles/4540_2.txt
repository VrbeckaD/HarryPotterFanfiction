          <div class="userstuff"><p>Liquid luck.</p>
<p>The little bottle tormented him. If he was ever going to complete the Dark Lord’s task, he would need all that and then some.</p>
<p>Slughorn, oblivious to his dilemma, said the potion was a prize for brewing the best Draught of the Living Death. Draco sniggered at the irony. Should he fail at his task, living death would be preferable to his fate.</p>
<p>Liquid luck. It sounded too good to be true. And so it was; Potter won it. Potter, who’d been rubbish at Potions all through their schooling till now. Potter, who got everything.</p>
<p>Draco was so frustrated he almost cried. Why was everything going wrong? Why did Potter get all the luck? He didn’t need Felix Felicis. Draco did.</p>
<p>He went back to the dorm, seething. Crabbe and Goyle knew better than attempt conversation when he was like this. How could he get that bottle?</p>
<p>“Can we break in to Gryffindor Tower?” he wondered.</p>
<p>“How?” Goyle asked. “We don’t even know where it is, let alone the password.”</p>
<p>Crabbe sniggered. “You know what we’d need? That liquid luck you said about.”</p>
<p>Draco almost laughed. Oh, the irony.</p></div>
