    <p>Avidia Agricola had been watching the Defence professor for a while. He made it his business to know the names and faces of all the pure-bloods left after the war, of which this <em> Hunithson </em> was none. Appointing him Head of House was an insult to the noble Salazar Slytherin himself, and Avidia wouldn't stand for it.</p><p> </p><p>He began to harbour a seething hatred for the man. But when the young mudblood convinced the headmistress to hire a putrid <em> squib </em> , and teach <em> muggle </em> defence, the professor knew that man was going to be trouble. And hatred turned to morbid resentment.</p><p> </p><p>But, he did not despair. For it was like his mother had always said prior to her untimely end; poison in a man's tea is the most efficient form of pest control.</p><p> </p><p>That was part of the reason Avidia took the job of potions master in the first place; an ample selection of rare ingredients to access unhindered. Which was why it was so easy for him to brew a batch of Living Death without a single interruption or prying eye. </p><p> </p><p>After all, it's on the curriculum.</p><p> </p><p>Avidia chuckled to himself as he added the juices of the red beans; once he got a hold of them of course, they had a tendency to run from the blade. Ironic, humans tended to do that too.</p><p> </p><p>When the batch was brewed to perfection, he sampled a few drops onto a leaf. The foliage crumbled to dust.</p><p> </p><p>"Goodbye, <em> professor Phoenix </em>." Avidia spat as he poured some of the brew into a glass bottle. He put on the cork stopper and held the container up to the light, watching the poison shift and flow, death in his grip but not able to touch him. He was completely in control. </p><p> </p><p>He was doing good, honest work.</p><p> </p><p>If only the Dark Lord could see him now...</p>
