    <p>My dearest Draco,</p>
<p>	I fear you’ll read this letter and become awfully crossed with me. You see dear brother, friend, I write to you of needing your assistance. I know, how dare such a beloved friend be sending her first letter of the summer to me requesting something of you. But alas I do write  and that is what I write for. 	</p>
<p>	Though I would not think to divulge such details in a letter I will let you know that is my motive, though I’m sure in your intelligence you would have caught on dear friend. I never could convey my want surreptitiously to you. But you are the one for the task and I feel like I could woo you into the thought of completing something so deliciously scandalous someone of your deviousness couldn’t resist the play. </p>
<p>	It is well thought out, and it involves your favorites: Debauchery, Corruption and a lick of cruelty. Believe me when I say this one shall quell the beast of man that rages inside you. I know you’ve been so stressed with the launch of the rebranding of Malfoy Enterprises. It’s so sad to see all that intelligence stuck being the face of a company trying to regain favorability after the dreadful war. </p>
<p>	Once more you even helped capture horrible people afterwards and your still having to pay your penance in niceties sprinkled to ensnare the brainwashed bulk of the wizarding world. It does break my heart, such cunning should be expressed everyday and with fervor from you. Blind violence may not be in the notes you play, but malice is your crescendo.   </p>
<p>I do say it’s time we make beautiful music for unsuspecting listeners.<br/>
What do you think about flooing to my flat this evening for a drink? I shall bring out the good firewhiskey. </p>
<p>Love in the deepest,<br/>
Pansy</p>
