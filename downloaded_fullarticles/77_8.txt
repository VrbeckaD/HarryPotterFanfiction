  <p>Hen Party</p>
</center>"Ooo, another negligee!" Luna held the garment against her. "It's just a bit of lace and nothing, isn't it? Ginny this must be from you!" The redhead grinned and waggled her eyebrows. "Thank you. It's beautiful and I'm sure Rolf will enjoy seeing me in it as much I will enjoy wearing it."<p>Pansy Parkinson was seated on a sofa with a glass of wine in her hand. Close enough to observe the festivities, but far enough away to ensure that there was no chance of being asked to participate in said festivities by doing anything other than murmur the occasional verbal approval of the next skimpy bit of nothing lingerie being displayed by the guest of honor. Next to her on the sofa was Hermione Granger, her best friend and the witch most responsible for Pansy's presence at this archaic, but apparently obligatory, gathering. </p>
<p>Luna arranged the scrap of silk and lace in the box, painstakingly folded the tissue paper over it, and then replaced the top. "There. Now the Frondi Flitterers can't find it. They can't resist lace, you know."</p>
<p>Pansy casually leaned over and, under the cover of the other guests' enthusiastic commentary, murmured into Hermione's ear. "Frondi Flitterers sounds like the name of a sex toy to me."</p>
<p>Hermione, unprepared for the sneak attack, had just taken a sip of her wine. She snort-laughed, inhaled some of the wine, then tried to cough, which came out as a wet, choked sound because she  still shook with laughter. In the end, she had wine in her nose and tears in her eyes. </p>
<p>"Are you all right, Hermione?" Luna asked, prompting everyone there to turn around and look at her.</p>
<p>"The wine went the wrong way down, that's all." </p>
<p>"Are you sure it wasn't a Wylette sneaking into your throat...?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly." </p>
<p>"That's a relief. Now where was I?" Luna picked up another gaily wrapped package and the others returned their attention to the guest of honor.</p>
<p>Hermione glanced at Pansy, who feigned ignorance as she sipped her own wine, but the small, tell-tale smile gave her away. <i>She warned me she'd pay me back for dragging her along, and now she has. Still Slytherin at heart.</i> Hermione couldn't stop an affectionate smile and was astounded once again by how their friendship had developed in the years since the War. </p>
<p>She remembered the precise moment when her opinion about Pansy had changed. It was during the Battle of Hogwarts, after Voldemort's confrontation with Neville. Satisfied that Neville had everything well in hand, Hermione had taken a moment to survey the terrain. She marked where all of major players were positioned and was plotting her next move when she noticed with dismay that Pansy and several of the older Slytherin students were among the residents of Hogsmeade who had rallied to defend Hogwarts. </p>
<p>Then Neville killed Nagini and all hell broke loose. Grawp roared and stomped around the corner of the castle, the Centaurs arrived, arrows flying, and in the blink of an eye, Hermione was too busy fighting for her life to think about anything else. The teeming mass of wizards and witches from both sides, some battling and some fleeing the danger, had herded her toward the relative shelter of the Great Hall. Hermione spotted Ginny and Luna dueling Bellatrix Lestrange and rushed to help her friends. She passed Pansy and realized that she, and some of the other Slytherin students, were fighting against Voldemort's minions. A flash of relief shot through her before her entire attention was focused on helping her friends fight Bellatrix. </p>
<p>Later, after the battle and the visit to Dumbledore's office with Harry, she and Ron had returned to the Great Hall. As they made their way toward his family, Hermione noticed Pansy sitting among those same Slytherins with her arm around a dark-haired witch who could only be her mother. Draco and his family sat nearby, neither included in, nor entirely excluded from, the group. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of Voldemort's fall were the Death Eater trials, at many of which Harry, Ron or Hermione were required to give testimony. It was emotionally exhausting, retelling everything again and again. When the call came for volunteers to help repair Hogwarts, Hermione and most of the people she knew responded. She was glad for the opportunity to get away from the Wizengamot for a few hours. On her first day, Hermione spied Pansy working next to the greenhouses and she turned in that direction. Hermione stopped in front of her, conjured a white handkerchief, and waved it with a tentative smile. </p>
<p>The black-haired witch eyed her with suspicion. "What do you want, Granger?"</p>
<p>"A cessation of hostilities. I saw what you did during the battle..."</p>
<p>"Did it shock you, Granger? That a Slytherin would fight to protect Hogwarts against an insane sociopath?" </p>
<p>"No!" Hermione snapped. "Of course not.  I am well aware of the contributions of Slytherin house to the defeat of Voldemort. Only a few people know this--but I carried Phineas Black's portrait around with me for months last year. He was unintentionally incredibly helpful to us—I found out later that he was giving information to Headmaster Snape so that he could help us too. Look, I was glad to see you and the others that day." Hermione paused. "In the days after the battle, I realized what a hypocrite I'd been—wittering on about equal rights for House Elves, but painting all Slytherins with the same brush. I was wrong." </p>
<p>Pansy gazed at her for a moment then shrugged. "Everyone makes mistakes. I could use a hand with the Snapping Geraniums. Funnily enough, they are still agitated about everything that happened." </p>
<p>As the weeks went by, they got to know each other better as they exchanged war stories. Pansy, it turned out, had been helping Snape during sixth year, feeding him information about Draco and his plans, in an unsuccessful attempt to protect her then-boyfriend. When Hermione shared what she knew about Snape's activities during the war, Pansy nodded. </p>
<p>"Things make so much more sense now. By the way, I hear that he's getting better."</p>
<p>"Slowly, but yes. Harry and I--ah--<i>persuaded</i>--a Healer to help retrieve the Headmaster from the Shrieking Shack after the battle. Madam Pomfrey dosed him with the antivenin that was developed after Mr. Weasley was bitten by Nagini. Thank Merlin for that, otherwise Snape would be dead." </p>
<p>As the months melted away and the school year approached, Hermione gathered her courage and broke up with Ron. Much to her surprise, he agreed that they didn't have enough in common to maintain a lasting relationship. Even though they parted as friends, it was a difficult time for Hermione and she was glad that Pansy had been there for her, along with Ginny, Luna and some of the others. Three years after graduation,  when Draco dumped Pansy for Astoria Greengrass, Hermione returned the favor. Her offer to find the blond wizard and transfigure him into a ferret coaxed a laugh out of Pansy before tears welled in her eyes and overflowed. Hermione pulled the other witch into her arms and simply held her as she mourned. </p>
<p>That had been almost ten years ago. After graduation from Uni, Pansy had taken a job with the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Hermione had endured a stint working at the MoM herself before she was lured back to Hogwarts to teach Arithmancy after Professor Vector's retirement two years ago. Many of the familiar faces were still there, including a fully recovered, and darkly attractive Severus Snape, who was teaching Potions again; having turned down the Headmaster position.</p>
<p>"What?" Pansy said, snapping Hermione out of her reverie. "Do I have something on my face?"</p>
<p>Hermione chuckled. "Just your freckles." She dodged the playful fist, and then turned her attention back to Luna and froze. </p>
<p>The bride-to-be had opened another box and lifted out a set of fuzzy handcuffs and a blindfold. "Oh, these are fun!" She said dreamily as she wrapped one of the cuffs around a wrist, leaving the attached one to hang down, before she slipped the blindfold over her eyes. She turned her head from side to side, and then pushed it to the top of her head as if it were a headband. "Oh, look!" Luna reached into the box. "There's even a little flogger too!" She snapped it in the air, which caused the dangling cuff to swing back and forth.</p>
<p>The women in the room tittered and made salacious suggestions, but Hermione sat, stiff backed and very still, her eyes wide and her breathing irregular. </p>
<p>"What's up, Granger? Never seen bondage gear before?" Pansy asked in an offhand way.</p>
<p>Hermione swallowed. "Um, no actually. Not in real life." She turned to Pansy, lowered her voice and raised her eyebrows. "In porn, sure. Photos in books." She tilted her head toward Luna, who had swapped the flogger for the other set of cuffs and smiled as she attached it to her other wrist. She wore them like a pair of dangling bracelets. "Those are a joke, right? Because 'normal' people don't actually use that stuff—in bed—do they?"</p>
<p>Pansy started to laugh, and when she realized that Hermione wasn't joking, her eyes widened. "Yes, people use 'that stuff' in bed. <i>I've</i> used that stuff in bed and more."</p>
<p>"With another person?" </p>
<p>"Of course." Pansy cocked her head. "Haven't you?"</p>
<p>Hermione glanced around and then lowered her voice as if she was afraid of being overheard. "I thought that being tied up during sex was...you know...not normal." She captured her bottom lip in her teeth.</p>
<p>Luna had opened another gift. Using the cover of the ensuing oohs and aahs of the other women, Pansy replied in an outraged undertone. "That's utter shite. After this, we'll get takeaway and go back to my place. It's not often that a humble Slytherin gets to tell the brightest witch of their age how wrong she is."</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>"Listen, Granger," Pansy said as she walked through to the sitting room and then sat beside Hermione on the sofa. She unwrapped a set of chopsticks and paused with them above the container. "There's no such thing as 'normal' or 'abnormal' when it comes to sex." She plucked a piece of chicken out of the box. "Loads of folks, including me, enjoy being restrained. Personally, I also enjoy being flogged, spanked, teased and tormented from time to time." She popped the chicken into her mouth, chewed and swallowed. "Oh, and role playing. That's fun. And," she looked into Hermione's eyes. "I also appreciate the appeal of both wizards," she leaned forward, and her gaze dropped to Hermione's mouth. Pansy wet her lips with her tongue, and then dragged her eyes up to meet her friend's gaze. When she spoke, her voice was low and meaningful. "...and witches."<p>Hermione's eyes widened and her cheeks reddened. "I didn't realize that there were so many choices. Good to know." She put aside Pansy's obvious invitation for the moment. She had so many questions. "Wait--isn't spanking and flogging someone and then tying them down for sex abusive?"</p>
<p>"If there's no consent, of course those things are abusive. " Pansy's voice was firm. "However, if you trust your partner, <i>and</i> they have your continuous, active consent? Oof. Orgasm city. Well, at least for me." She shrugged. "Everyone is turned on by different things, Granger." She took another bite of her chicken. </p>
<p>"Pans, I have always fantasized about those things that you said. Being tied down, especially." Hermione whispered. </p>
<p>"Why are you whispering? Your desires are nothing to be ashamed of." Pansy said matter-of-factly. "In fact, being restrained is a very popular fantasy. See also: spanking, hair pulling and flogging. Although," she wrinkled her nose. "Leather floggers are much nicer than that very whippy toy that Luna got tonight. Those little ones hurt like a motherfucker." She paused to eat some noodles. "I really get off on giving up control to a dominant partner during sex. It's so exciting, because it's all up to them. They might put a ball gag in my mouth, string me up to the St. Andrew's Cross and flog me, or they might tie me down over a spanking bench, stick a plug up my ass, and then edge me until I'm out of my mind before fucking me hard. Mind-blowing orgasms, either way." She closed the container, set it down on the table and put the chopsticks on top before she leaned forward and put her hand on Hermione's thigh. When the other witch met her gaze, Pansy smiled. "And that's not even getting into threesomes, foursomes and more-somes. Come on, you must have researched all of this stuff."</p>
<p>"I've tried," Hermione replied. "I've confined myself to Muggle libraries and the internet, but most of what I've found has been pornography or novels and those aren't realistic, are they? I've been too nervous about the subject to use the Hogwarts library. You know how conservative most of the Wizarding World still is about this sort of thing--"</p>
<p>"Fucking hypocrites," Pansy growled.</p>
<p>"--so I didn't want to risk even buying a magical book on the subject. I could just see the headline the next day: 'Hermione Granger's Freaky Fantasies'." She gestured helplessly as tears welled in her eyes and then overflowed. "I thought that I was weird for fantasizing about those things." </p>
<p>"That's nonsense!" Pansy was affronted. "Let me guess, some man made you feel that way?" </p>
<p>Hermione nodded.</p>
<p>Pansy cupped Hermione's face, brushed her tears away with her thumbs, and searched the other witch's eyes. "Who told you that your desires were wrong? Was it Weasley? I'll go and educate him at wandpoint right now about human sexuality." Her voice was gentle and ferocious.</p>
<p>A laugh gurgled out of Hermione. "No, because I never had the courage to ask <u>him</u>. " She sighed. "It was Viktor. You remember Viktor Krum—my date for the Yule Ball? Things got a bit hot and heavy between us after the dance and we, you know, did it." Her face reddened. </p>
<p>Pansy sat up straight. "You fucked Viktor Krum fourth year?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. It was the night before the third task. We were making out and it was exciting and then I asked.. I asked him to... I wanted him to tie me up with my legs spread...and then," she gestured. "F-fuck me. But, Pans. His reaction was not... He looked at me like I'd lost my mind. He refused to do it. Told me such thoughts were perverted and unnatural and that when he was finished with me that I would understand. Then we did it and it was okay, but—not mind-blowing." She shrugged. "The third task was the next day and I never saw Viktor again. And when the desire to be tied down during sex didn't go away, I thought there was something wrong with me, so I've been too ashamed to bring it up with anyone else." Her chin quivered.</p>
<p>Pansy's heart broke. "I'm sorry, love. Do you want a hug?" </p>
<p>Hermione nodded and before she could blink, Pansy had wrapped her arms around her, pulled her close and tucked her head against her shoulder. </p>
<p>"I swear to you that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you or your desires. I'm sorry that Krum made you feel that your proclivities are gross or unnatural, because they most certainly are not. When it comes to sex, 'normal' is different for every person," she said fiercely. "Krum was apparently vanilla. Extremely vanilla by the sound of it. And that's okay. But you—" She squeezed her and kissed the top of her head. "Welcome to the world of kink, love. It's a lot of fun here." Her tone became serious. "If vanilla sex doesn't satisfy you, Hermione, then it's okay to do what does--with someone who likes doing those things too." </p>
<p>"I'm-I'm kinky...? Okay, well, that's a relief." Hermione chuckled as she sat up. "I swear, Pans, if it wasn't for non-verbal Incarcerous and my vibrator..." She shrugged. </p>
<p>Pansy's mouth dropped open. "Do you mean to tell me that you've never had an orgasm with another person?" Hermione shook her head. "I thought you told me that you and Snape are a thing?"</p>
<p>"I did. And we are. It's gotten more serious in the last few weeks." Hermione chewed her bottom lip. "Feelings-wise, you know. And we've done a lot of kissing. Including a hot and handsy make out sesh or two, but nothing more. I was too nervous to take the next step. And he hasn't initiated anything either."</p>
<p>"Merlin's balls, Hermione—" Pansy clapped her hands. "Severus Snape is a Dominant, and a good one. He gets off on being in control during sex. He's the perfect person to, er—show you the ropes, so to speak. I'll bet you a hundred Galleons that he has been wondering how to bring it up to you."</p>
<p>"Wha—? Are you sure? How do you know this about him?" Hermione asked as a guarded optimism rose within her. </p>
<p>"Well, I'm a member of same kink club as Snape and I've...uh, seen him in action, so to speak. Let me tell you, the other submissives there were very disappointed when he stopped going," she put a finger to the side of her head and pretended to think about it. "Oh, yeah--right about the time that he started seeing you." Her eyes gleamed. "When you tell him, it will be like Christmas and his birthday all rolled up in one Hermione-shaped package."</p>
