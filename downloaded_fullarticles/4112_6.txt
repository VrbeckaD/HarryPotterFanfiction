    <p>He practically threw the pictures across the dining room table towards the woman sitting in the chair opposite. Her fire red hair covered her face as she looked down at her clenched hands. The wizarding photos moved mocking the young man across from her. </p><p>Silence reigned as the uncomfortable minutes ticked by. The young red head fidgeted in her seat. The young man was so angry the magic was practically vibrating across his skin. He was controlling his magic so it didn’t lash out and cause any damage. If he was honest, he did want to cause damage. </p><p>“Well?” He said through clenched teeth. “Do you have anything to say for yourself?”</p><p>The young woman sighed. “What do you want me to say,Harry?” She pushed the incriminating photos away from her. “You’ve obviously have your proof of my indiscretions.” </p><p>“All I want to know is why, Ginny? Do I not make you happy?” Harry scrubbed at his face. “Do the years we spent together not mean anything to you?” He really wanted to understand what made Ginny seek out someone else.</p><p>“I don't know what to say, Harry. He makes me feel alive! He pays attention to me!” She looked up with a fierce look in her eyes. “He treats me with respect and cherishes me! You haven’t done that for years!” She practically spat. All the fight left Harry at the venom in her voice and the hurt in her eyes. He knew that his Auror work distracted him and took him away from home for long periods of time.  </p><p>“I know my Auror work takes up most of my time, Ginny, but you knew that when I became one!” He threw back at her. “Your career with the Harpy’s also takes you away for the season and I’ve come to accept that!”</p><p>“Even when we are together you are a million miles away! You don’t pay attention to ME anymore! He does!” She was near tears again. </p><p>“Then why didn’t you say anything?” Harry looked at her sadly. “We could have tried to fix things or I could have let you go.” He ran his fingers through his hair. A nervous habit from his youth.</p><p>“Because….you were my dream, Harry.” Ginny sighed looking up. “I didn’t want to admit that my dream had failed.” Harry could understand that. Ginny and him were expected to get together and work. They were supposed to be just like his parents. When did it all start falling apart?</p><p>“Maybe it’s best we end things now that you know. I am truly in love with him.” She smiled as she gazed at the pair in the photo. “He’s what I truly want.” Harry could feel his heart breaking but knew in his heart that it was the right thing to do. </p><p>Ginny got up from the table and walked across the kitchen. “I’ll pack my things and be out in a few.” He watched her walk away as he slumped against the granite counter. What a mess.<br/>

You need to get out of the house.” Seamus said as he walked into Harry’s office at the Auror department. </p><p>“I’m not really feeling it, Seamus.” Harry sighed as he looked down at the paperwork littering his desk. He looked up as he saw a shadow cross his line of vision. The papers he was looking at were yanked out of his hands and placed unceremoniously in the trash.</p><p>“Hey!” He looked up into Seamus’ smiling face. The man just smiled as he placed his hands down on the desk. </p><p>“You’re coming out with me and a few mates tonight. No arguments!” Harry sighed and knew he was defeated. Seamus was persistent.</p><p>“Fine fine. Let’s go.” He stood up from his desk and grabbed his coat from the rack. Seamus followed Harry to the floo and through to his apartment. “Hang on while I change then Seamus.”</p><p>He walked into his modestly furnished bedroom and over to the wardrobe. He pulled out a nice pair of jeans and a blue button down shirt. He changed then went into the bathroom to try to tame his hair. It was no use. He used a bit of gel that Luna had gotten for him the christmas before to atleast make his hair look like he tried to make it look that way. Sexily tousled. </p><p>About 30 minutes later he walked out and heard Seamus whistle. “Wow Harry! You dress up nice!” Harry could feel a blush stain his cheeks.</p><p>“Stop it Seamus! Let’s get going.” He quickly grabbed his leather coat and followed Seamus through the floo to their favorite pub. As they exited the floo he looked around for familiar faces. He smiled as he noticed Dean and Neville. He raised his hand to wave when he noticed Blaise Zabini sitting with them. His heart nearly stopped when he noticed the unmistakeable platinum blonde hair of one Draco Lucius Malfoy. </p><p>Seamus pulled him over to the table holding the other men. Harry breath caught in his throat when Draco smiled...at him. He didn’t know why but he felt like he was screwed.</p>
