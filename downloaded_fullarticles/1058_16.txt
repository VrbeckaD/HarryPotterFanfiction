  <b>London, England</b>
</p><p>Harry Potter looked around at the very familiar surroundings. It was a familiar place, but one he hadn’t seen in awhile. The blindingly white station looked exactly like Kings Cross Station, from the flooring to the ceiling, every inch was similar to the real deal except for the whiteness. It was a place he had visited once before, twenty five years ago. “I’m dead then,” he sighed while brilliant green eyes glimmered with sadness, frustration and anger. It was only his luck that he’d die when a war was starting up again in his world, leaving behind those he cared about. </p><p>“You are, my Master,” a whispery voice announced behind him, echoing in the empty station. Harry spun around to face the voice that spoke and paused in surprise. The man that stood before him was dressed in a plain black suit with a white, button up, long sleeved shirt and black tie. A black trench coat fell to the heels of his black dress shoes. He had long, slicked back hair that fell to the nape of his neck and eyes so dark, they looked like black holes. His skin was papery white, almost translucent in the brightness of the station. He was thin, with his cheeks sunken in, making him look like a skeleton. In his hand he held a cane with a small silver statue of a skull. </p><p>“Death…” Harry trailed off in surprise. It was not the first time he had met Death, but it was the first time he’s been confronted by him looking like this. All the other times he ever died, if only for a few minutes, he was met by someone he cared about, like his parents, Sirius and Remus. “How did I die Death?” He questioned with interest. His memory was a bit blurry and it seemed his memories of before his death were also becoming unclear. </p><p>“You died by protecting your children, Master.” Death explained. He watched in curiosity as his Master smiled and then quickly frowned as the news sunk in. He assumed his Master would have been pleased by this news. Not look upset about how he died.</p><p>“My children are orphans,” he sighed again and rubbed his face. “Did they see me die, Death?” Harry asked with wide, concerned eyes. He didn’t want them haunted by watching their father die because he had protected them. He knew how they would feel because he knows what that was like, knowing your parents died for you.</p><p>Death slowly shook his head. “No, Master. Your friends arrived only a few minutes before. Long enough for them to get the children away so they would not see your fallen form,” he explained in his soft voice.</p><p>Harry nodded, a feeling of relief settling over. “Am I able to move on then, Death?” He inquired to the elder deity. At the expression that graced Death’s features, the wizard sighed heavily, already knowing the answer. “I’m not able to move on am I?” He rhetorically asked with a frown. Even in the afterlife he was unable to get peace. </p><p>“I am sorry my Master. You are the only person that has ever come to master the Deathly Hollows. You are my Master and will not be able to join your loved ones.” Death explain in an apologetic tone. “But…” He paused, unsure if he should actually continue on speaking. He wasn’t sure if his Master would want to go along with his idea. </p><p>“But…” Harry replied with searching eyes. His expression was curious as he faced the Entity he was the Master of. He was interested in what Death had to say. </p><p>“I can have you reborn. I can give you a new life with a loving family. Unless you would like to go back to your old life?” Death questioned as he faced his young Master. He did truly wish to help his Master. By giving him a new life, he would finally get the happiness that he deserved. After all the hardships he had dealt with in his life, he deserved to be happy. He had just the family he could go to and make things even more interesting for that family. Most would assume he hated vampires, but he was he who had gifted them the ability of immortality. They could still die, but it was just harder for them to. </p><p>Harry stayed silent as he thought over what he wanted to do. Since he was unable to move on he had two choices. He could go back to his world that was about to start another war and deal with that all over again or he could be reincarnated and have the family he always wanted. As much as he loved his children and family, he was tired of fighting and war. He wanted a life for once where he didn’t have to fight. “I’d like to be reborn,” he finally decided with a nod of his head. </p><p>“Wise choice my Master.” Death replied with a nod. “I do believe I have the perfect world,” and with a flick of his hand, Harry disappeared as he was sent off to start the beginning of his new life. </p><p align="center">

  <b>Forks, Washington</b>
</p><p>When Bella first realized she was pregnant with Edward’s child, she was stunned. She knew it should have been impossible for her to become pregnant since Edward was a vampire. It was when she found out that he wanted to kill their child that she knew who she who would have to turn to for help. She did not want Edward to kill their child, she loved the child that she and Edward created. The very thought of them killing it left her feeling sick. She already loved her child.  </p><p>It was then that she turned to call Rosalie. She enlisted Rosalie's help as a bodyguard, with support from Emmett and Esme, Bella refused to have an abortion, determined to carry the child, trusting that Edward will save her by turning her into a vampire after she gives birth and that Carlisle will save the baby if something goes wrong. Carlisle had also been unwilling to disagree with Esme, so he agreed to help Bella. She wanted their child to survive, to live. Even if their child was slowly killing her in the process. </p><p>As the baby continued to grow at an alarmingly rapid rate, becoming stronger and bigger, Bella's health also started to deteriorate. She developed an unhealthy pallor; making her look sickly, while her stomach became bruised in multiple places from the baby's movements, as it inherited a vampire's superhuman strength. Her ribs and later her pelvis, were also broken. </p><p>The day that Jacob visited, Bella could instantly see how pissed he was when he discovered that she was pregnant with Edward’s child. Bella had argued with him, explaining that she was going to keep her child, even if it killed her in the end. She knew that when Edward and Jacob went to talk, that whatever they agree on was something that she wouldn’t like. </p><p>When her body began rejecting human food, it was only Jacob bitterly thinking about the "creature" craving blood, that Edward, with his ability to read thoughts, thought up a solution. When the Cullen’s allowed Bella to sample some donated human blood from Carlisle's work at the hospital, it was a surprise to Bella when it actually smelled and tasted appealing, and revived her to a certain extent. In the two weeks since she found out she was pregnant, as they seemed to pass quickly, she already looked like she was six months pregnant.</p><p>Bella watched in silence as her family tried to research a human becoming pregnant from a vampire but only found rumors and myths. Carlisle explained why he couldn’t use an ultrasound. When he said it was the evidence of the baby’s vampire heritage, with its apparent hard and thick amniotic sac, endurance resembling the skin of a vampire, Bella felt relieved. Her child was part vampire, giving it more of a fighting chance of surviving.  </p><p>It was only a few days later that Jacob broke off from Sam Uley’s pack and made his own pack as the Alpha. His pack consisted of the bitter Leah Clearwater, her younger brother Seth Clearwater, who was very cheerful and talkative and a few other shapeshifters. When Sam found out that she was pregnant, he wanted both her and her child dead. It led to a heightened awareness as all the Cullen’s and Jacob’s pack anticipated an attack by Sam’s pack soon. </p><p>Though there was a sense of stress for all involved, one bright side during those tense moments was when Edward began to hear the baby's thoughts. Bella was very happy to hear that their child loved her as much as she loved it and could recognize the sounds of their voices, and could even understand simple conversations. This new knowledge quickly won over Edward's affection. After listening to its parents, the baby understood what hurt its mother and tried to avoid injuring her further. </p><p>Bella is convinced that the baby is a boy and decided she wanted to name it Cassimere Jarred Marcello Cullen, if it was a boy. However, she knows that she may be wrong and the baby could turn out to be a girl. She decides that Renesmee Carlie Cullen would be what she would call her baby, should it be a girl. Both names sounded unique to Bella, unique for her unique half-vampire/half-human child. She knows Rosalie wasn’t exactly impressed with her naming skills, but she had a lot of time to come up with names. She had used a combination of all their names for the boy and girl.</p><p>As the pregnancy continues its rapid progression, Bella went into violent labor on September 11th, much sooner than anticipated when the placenta unexpectedly detached. The agony she felt made her scream in pain. Carlisle and Esme, who originally planned to be there for delivery the next day, were out hunting, leaving Edward, Rosalie, Jacob, and Alice to help to deliver the baby by C-section. </p><p>Bella watched as Alice ran off to call Carlisle to let the others know the news. She watched Rosalie and Edward argued above her on what to do. She knows Edward hated the idea of her in pain and wanted her on morphine, but she knew they couldn’t wait and commanded him to perform the C-section without delay. “He can’t breathe!” She cried out, thrashing and screaming on the operation table. Knowing her child was panicking was making her panic. She didn’t, she couldn’t lose her child, her little C.J.</p><p>Rosalie had quickly started the C-section, after winning the argument, but due to the amount of blood involved she lost control. This forced Jacob and Alice, who had reappeared back in the room, to tackle her and drag her from the room. Consciousness swam in and out of focus for Bella from the pain of her child’s violent thrashing. Her child broke many of her ribs, she lost a lot of blood, and eventually her spine was snapped, making Jacob to provide CPR to keep her breathing.  Edward continued with the C-section in Rose's place, eventually using his teeth to bite through the hard amniotic sac. </p><p>“It’s twins.” Edward stated in awe as he reached into the sac and quickly but carefully delivered the first child, a boy. “Cassimere,” he said as he laid their son on Bella’s chest. Reaching back into the sac he gently pulled out their second child, a girl. “Renesmee,” he said and laid their daughter beside Cassimere on Bella’s chest. As Bella held her children, she felt awed and surprised at the knowledge that she had two beautiful children with Edward. The all-encompassing love she felt for her children was breathtaking in its entirety. </p><p>Cassimere and Renesmee's vampire heritage quickly become apparent when they bit Bella, showing their inherited sharp teeth and natural desire for human blood. Bella’s eyesight began to focus in and out before the darkness finally encased her and she lost consciousness again due to her injuries. Edward quickly lifts the babies, handing Renesmee to Rosalie and Cassimere to Alice and injected his venom into Bella's heart and then bit her in several places, maximizing her odds of survival. </p><p>Edward had to save Bella. For his children and himself. He couldn't imagine a life without his wife in it.</p>
