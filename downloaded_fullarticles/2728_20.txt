          <div class="userstuff"><p>Albus Dumbledore stood in front of the Mirror of Erised, his fist closed around the pendant - <em>their</em> pendant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Gellert’s mismatched eyes in the mirror stared back at him, expressionless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The pendant should have been gone by now. </p><p> </p><p>But then, Albus thought, it should have been gone ages ago. It should have been destroyed the second he had gotten hold of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>According to the books he had strewn across the floor, everything he had set up was correct. The necessary runes and charms were all in place. Everything should have worked out as planned - the blood pact should have been nothing more than ashes on the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Yet, here it was, still perfectly intact in his hand, the two drops of blood still swirling in the amber crystal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Frustrated, Albus turned away from the mirror, away from Gellert’s unyielding eyes, and sat down heavily on the ground. He picked up the heavy, leather-bound book from the floor next to him, and thumbed through the pages until he found what he was looking for.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>At the very bottom of the page, the line read: <em>One must remember that a blood troth is made as a symbol of love, and cannot be broken as long as one still loves the other.</em></p><p> </p><p>He could not still love Gellert. Not after what he had done to muggles, to wizards, to <em>his sister.</em></p><p> </p><p>But in his heart, he knew, after all these years, he still longed for Gellert’s presence, and the days spent together. He still longed for the only time in his life when he felt understood. And of course, he still longed for his voice in whispering in his ear, his soft touch trailing across his skin, and his lips against his.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>-<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Albus and Gellert sat on the ground of the abandoned barn, a stack of books resting on a pile of hay next to them. They each had a book in their laps, but while Albus was focused on reading, Gellert was distracted by the boy sitting next to him.</em>
</p><p>  </p><p>
  <em>”Albus.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Albus looked up, expecting Gellert to show him what he had found in his book. But the page left open on Gellert’s lap was just an ordinary article about the founding of the Ministry of Magic.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>”Albus, I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I know you feel the same way too.”</em>
</p><p>  </p><p>
  <em>Albus looked into his friend’s eyes, which were gleaming with an intensity Albus had not ever seen in him. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>”I love you, Albus.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Albus stared at Gellert, his mind still struggling to process what he had just heard. Surely Gellert did not mean it that way? Ever since he had met him, Albus had just known that Gellert was not just a friend in his heart - a friend would not make his heart skip a beat every time he saw them, or make his blush simply by saying his name.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Albus finally spoke. “Gellert, if you mean you like me as a friend-“</em>
</p><p>  </p><p>
  <em>”No.” Gellert cut in. “You know what I meant, Albus. I know you do.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Albus studied Gellert’s face, searching for any sign that he could be simply telling him this as a prank, or worse, to get a rise out of him. But the expression on his face was genuine.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>”I love you too, Gellert.”</em>
</p><p>  </p><p>
  <em>As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Gellert was practically lunging over towards him, the book on his lap falling to the ground. Gellert grabbed him by the front of his shirt, pulling him closer and pressing his lips against his. A warm sensation exploded in Albus’ chest, and he felt the heat rising up to his cheeks.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Albus hungrily kissed him back, pressing his lips against Gellert’s. Gellert’s fists were knotted into his shirt, pulling him up towards him. They tumbled to the ground, Gellert landing on top of Albus. They broke apart for a second as they fell, and stared at each other, catching their breath. And then Gellert leaned down again, kissing Albus firmly on the lips once more.</em>
</p><p>  </p><p><em>With Gellert’s body pressed against his, any doubt of Gellert’s true feelings towards him were now gone. He allowed Gellert to kiss him with an intensity that he had never felt before - one that sent tremors down his entire body and almost made him moan in delight. As Gellert kissed him, he brought his hands up and clung on to Gellert’s body, with one hand buried in Gellert’s blond curls.</em> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>When they finally pulled apart, breathless, Albus looked into those mismatched eyes again. Now that what he had desperately desired with Gellert had finally come true, he only wanted more.</em>
