    <p>Hawthorn sighed in relief when she saw that the cafe was still open, Primula had insisted on dressing her up for the interview despite Hawthorn’s attempts to leave and because of that she ended up running a bit late.<br/>
Ur Cafe and Restaurant sat inside the mouth of a rather gloomy side street, just out of view from the average passerby. The lights glowed warmly, spilling light into the darkened street, and Hawthorn could see a man in a hat moving behind the counter, seemingly starting to close up shop.<br/>
Hurrying a bit more Hawthorn stepped into the cafe, rubbing her hands together to warm them. “Hello?” She called to the man once the warmth had returned to her fingers, “Are you Bofur, sir? I’m here for an interview!” She walked closer to the counter, peering curiously at the few pastries left in the case.<br/>
Bofur set the half full jar of hard candy on the counter before turning his attention to Hawthorn, “You must be Hawthorn,” He greeted with a bright smile, ”I have to admit I was starting to think you weren’t going to show up!”<br/>
Hawthorn smiled back and stuck her hand out, “Hawthorn Baggins, at your service,” She introduced, “I apologise for being late!”<br/>
Bofur shook her hand over the counter, his grin growing, “That’s fine, we wouldn’t’ve had time for the interview if you had come earlier anyways, It’s been a busy day.”<br/>
Bofur let go of her hand and moved away from the counter, motioning for Hawthorn to wait while he flipped the sign. “My brother is closing up downstairs.” he told her, “so we’ll do the interview there.”<br/>
Hawthorn followed Bofur down the stairs, marveling at the subtle designs carved in the stone of the stairway.<br/>
“Hey Bombur, she’s here!” Bofur called when they stepped off the last stair, Hawthorn could see a man with ginger hair putting away the last of a set of glasses. Bombur turned around, a grin quickly forming on his face as he greeted her, “Hello miss Baggins, my name is Bombur, it’s a pleasure to meet you!” Hawthorn hurried forwards to shake his hand, quietly telling him to call her Hawthorn.<br/>
Hawthorn sat on one of the bar stools in front of Bombur and turned to Bofur, “So, What do I need to get the job?” She asked curiously, “The ad in the paper didn’t given much information besides some vague guidelines...”<br/>
Bofur leaned against the counter and hummed in thought, “You would mostly be working at the counter upstairs but you’d help down here on the more busy nights.” He decided, “But we need to get the customary questions out of the way before we talk about that, so!” He clapped his hands and nodded towards Bombur, “My brother’ll do most of the interview ‘cause he’s better at that stuff than me.”<br/>
Hawthorn nodded in agreement and turned to face Bombur who was leaning under the counter for something, he fished around for a while before coming up with what looked like a pad of paper. Bombur flipped through a few pages and finally settles on a certain one, “Okay let’s get started, Question number one, How would you handle an unruly customer?”<br/>
Hawthorn shifted around to get more comfortable before answering, “From my few past experiences I have found that it is easier to apologise regardless if the customer is wrong or not, if only to not make a scene.”<br/>
Bombur wrote something down before nodding and moving on, “What is your availability? Would you be able to work early morning or late night shifts?”<br/>
“Right now I’m mostly free except for 5:30 to 9:00 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays because of my volunteer work at the soup kitchen.”<br/>
It continued like that for a while longer before Bombur finally flipped the notepad shut, “Well you look good on paper but you need more experience with interacting with customers,”He told her, setting the notebook on the counter, “So what do you say about us hiring you temporarily?” He offered before explaining more thoroughly, “It would serve as an ‘extended interview’ so to speak, that way we can see how you would interact with our regulars and you would be able to learn a bit about how we do things here.”<br/>
Hawthorn barely had to think about it, so far she liked the brothers and she would very much like to work with them, even if it were just for a small while. “I would love to work here, even if it’s only for a bit!” She exclaimed eagerly, “And even if the job doesn’t work out I would like to be friends with you.”<br/>
Bombur grinned at her as he grabbed a small packet of papers from a drawer besides him, “I would be thrilled to be your friend,”He told her, Bofur nodding in agreement beside him, “ Now please read through this and sign on the lines if you agree.” he flipped through the packet for a second before sliding it towards Hawthorn.<br/>
Hawthorn pulled the papers towards her and read through the contract carefully before signing it and handing it over with a smile, “I can’t wait to work with you!”</p>
