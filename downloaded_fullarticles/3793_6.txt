  <b>Prologue</b>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Once upon a time, not so very long ago…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Tower walls, cold as stone, high above the ground.</em>
</p>
<p>Lily is three when she pads out of her bedroom for the first time without permission, carefully tiptoeing past Petunia's room, and peers out of the only window in her solitude.</p>
<p>She's finally, <em>finally</em> tall enough to reach the window frame with her hands that still hold chubby baby fat. She's able to peer past the night sky that she knows so well, and glance downward to where tuffs of overgrown grass are blowing about in the night breeze.</p>
<p>Grass, in which she's only read about, and is cloaked by the darkness of the long fallen night.</p>
<p>And she wonders what it must feel like. If it would bend underneath her foot. If it would tickle her bare skin, for she owns no footwear. She wonders if it's really as green in the daylight as it is in her books.</p>
<p>She has to wait till morning when Petunia is not looking to find out.</p>
<p>
  <em>Hair as bright as flames, tangling, thick and heavy.</em>
</p>
<p>Lily is five when she notices Petunia's hair is different than her own. It's golden and fair, a contrast to Lily's, and it hangs to her shoulders, falling in soft curls.</p>
<p>Lily's own hair hangs down to her ankles now, and it's a mass of tangles. Petunia minds doing simple things for Lily that she claims Lily can do on her own, but the one thing she doesn't seem to mind is brushing through Lily's hair for her. Petunia sings the same song every morning as she brushes through her tresses. Petunia is sick, she tells Lily herself. She's sick with something Lily isn't entirely aware of, and Lily's hair holds healing abilities that Petunia tells Lily she prayed to Merlin above for.</p>
<p>And Lily would do anything for Petunia.</p>
<p>Who is the one who keeps her safe from people that want to use her for her hair.</p>
<p>Who keeps her away from people who want to cut her hair, and kill the magic within her.</p>
<p>Who loves her in her own sort of way that is hard for Lily to understand, but Lily doesn't understand much outside of the tower walls, and love isn't something she can deduct from a book.</p>
<p>Petunia <em>must</em> love her because she tells Lily so, and Lily has never experienced any other sort of love. Petunia is, and possibly will ever be, the only person in Lily's life, so she doesn't have much to go on other than her faith and Petunia's word.</p>
<p>But she knows that <em>she</em> loves Petunia if nothing else.</p>
<p>Even if she feels it's a deeper sort of love than what Petunia professes for her.</p>
<p>And she <em>wants </em>Petunia to be well from whatever it is that is ailing her.</p>
<p>So she willingly lets Petunia take her magic from her.</p>
<p>She only wished the song, and the glowing of her hair didn't cause her scalp to burn so intensely that she had tears in her eyes by the time Petunia is rosy cheeked and pinked lipped again.</p>
<p>
  <em>Leather bound books, the spines becoming slowly unbound, pages folded, torn, faded.</em>
</p>
<p>Lily first learns there is an opposite gender from her own from a book Petunia brings her from a week long trip in a nearby town. She is twelve and feels her heart flip at the sight of the prince in her story book.</p>
<p>A boy, it is called.</p>
<p>A man, when they are grown.</p>
<p>And Lily asks Petunia what boys - what <em>men </em>- are like.</p>
<p>"They're horrible," says Petunia. She doesn't look at Lily. She's looking in the mirror, prodding her cheeks, and Lily worries Petunia is sick again and will ask her to sing. "They're selfish. They're unkind. Ruffians, thugs - the lot of them."</p>
<p>"Oh," breathes Lily. She blinks down at her book, stuck on the page where her prince is kissing a sleeping princess. He certainly doesn't <em>look </em>unkind. She touches her lips, and wonders what it would be like for someone else to touch them. For a <em>boy </em>to touch them with his own."I thought they'd be different."</p>
<p>"I hope you never have to meet a man," says Petunia.</p>
<p>Lily hopes the opposite.</p>
<p>She hopes one day a prince will show up, and scale her tower wall for her.</p>
<p>She wishes for it so badly that it keeps her awake some nights.</p>
<p>She wants for it so much she's afraid Petunia will hear her thought for they're so loud in her own head.</p>
<p>Six years later a man <em>does </em>scale her wall.</p>
<p>But rather than a prince, he's a <em>thief.</em></p>
<p>And Lily knocks him over the head with a frying pan.</p>
