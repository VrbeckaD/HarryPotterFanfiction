    <p>ALBUS      </p>
<p>“Calm down Serverus, there’s nothing to get all worked up over,” the headmaster pops a lemon drop at the sight of the poor student clutching the letter. Severus Snape is one of the most fascinating students he has ever encountered during his time in Hogwarts. He reads through the letter declaring the poor wizard in front of him as a creature. Severus however has been given the remainder of the school year to put his affairs in order.      </p>
<p>“I’m no longer considered a human being Professor, I think it’s a little late for being worked up,” the 6<sup>th</sup> year student looks mortified, but more or less is put together, “what can I do? I’m not going home to… my father nor am I going to be used as a slave to anyone. Creature or no I am still a person.” Albus Dumbledore knows all too well why he doesn’t want to return to Spinner’s End, Tobias Snape is one of the most awful muggles personality wise he’s ever encountered. He lays the letter down and stares at the Slytherin across from him with a hope filled smile.      </p>
<p>“You can stay here at the school,” Albus decides on the spot, “you could petition to have either Professor McGonagall or myself as your caretaker. As your father is not a wizard he would not know how to even begin to care for a creature, which brings me to an interesting question Severus, do you have any knowledge of what type of creature you are?” The Slytherin shakes his head looking down at his hands dejectedly.      </p>
<p>“No, don’t know enough about the Prince line to even begin to know where to start either,” he responds, “I do know that mother was… ignored once my father was in the picture.”      </p>
<p>“Disinherited? That’s sad,” Albus strokes his long white beard thoughtfully.      </p>
<p>“If its not too much trouble I’d ask that you be the caretaker over Professor McGonagall, we’ve never really seen eye to eye,” he admits.      </p>
<p>“That’s mostly because Minerva takes it upon herself to mother you to death, but I understand your concern Severus. I’ll speak with the ministry on your behalf about getting the proper paperwork,” Albus confirms, “I might not always be here, but I’ll see that you have what you need and space to adjust to whatever your creature is.”      </p>
<p>“I’d appreciate that greatly sir,” Severus stands up, and as he heads for the door he pauses, “what if I end up needing a mate or something like that?” Albus smiles gently his way before looking back to the paperwork at his desk again.      </p>
<p>“Severus, don’t worry. We will cross that bridge as it becomes necessary,” Albus lets him leave without further delay. He’s pouring himself a thumb full of brandy before the sorting hat lets out a giggle.      </p>
<p>“I know what creature the boy will be,” the hat of Godric Gryffindor chuckles, “support him Albus, and you will be rewarded. The things that boy has in his head, they are worth looking after.” The hat goes back to sleep, and he looks at Fawkes with a twinkle back in his eye.      </p>
<p>“It’s going to be an interesting year again, no doubt about that,” Albus inclines his brandy towards the Phoenix that chirps in agreement.    </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s two months later when Severus’ birthday hits and he disappears from the greater populace of Hogwarts into the depths of the dungeons. Dumbledore has to inscribe runes around them to keep his charge from the rest of the students while he recovers from his inheritance. Lily Evans finds him two weeks after that with more concern than he would have thought.      </p>
<p>“Professor?” Her voice is quiet, “Sorry to disturb you, but I was wondering if you knew anything about Severus?” Albus watches the young witch twitch with worry. He had asked Severus if anyone was to be informed, or if he wanted anyone to know about what was going on. He calmly responded, but there was a sad look in his eye that no, there was no one. Not anymore.      </p>
<p>“What did Mr. Snape tell you before the break Miss Evans?” Dumbledore knew that Snape held feelings for her, but she had chosen young Mr. James Potter, “or did you never give him the chance after his temper ran amok months ago?” Severus would allow her to know, if she had only listened. The young man had left a memory with him using his Pensieve, probably for the young witch before him now.      </p>
<p>“I…” Lily Evans looked down at her lap with sad tear swollen eyes, “he said something unforgivable headmaster. No matter what came after, it still is unforgivable. Friends don’t call each other things like that.”      </p>
<p>“He lamented it every day Miss Evans,” the headmaster gestures to the Pensieve, “he left a memory for you to view if you came. It however is for you and you alone, not even I know what the memory contains.” Severus made him promise not to, and Dumbledore saw the look of embarrassment on his face when he left the memory there. He put a special charm on it to prevent anyone besides Miss Evans from viewing it. She came back to herself with a gasp, and her eyes brimming with tears.      </p>
<p>“He’s… he truly was sorry. Will I ever see him again professor?” Lily asks looking at him curiously, “he said he received a letter telling him that he would be coming int his creature inheritance on his 17<sup>th</sup> birthday. That’s why he’s missing isn’t it?”      </p>
<p>“Yes, he’s currently in the dungeons down below. He is in no danger, nor is he currently a danger to anyone else,” Albus explains with a soft smile, “he is currently under my care. With his inheritance we removed him from Tobias’s care with his creature inheritance having come to. You are not to talk to anyone without asking him first.”      </p>
<p>“Of course, creature inheritance letters come through Gringotts. It’s the highest of secrecy to get a letter from them,” Lily nods, “he asked me to do the research on it right away. I’m afraid he asked me not to speak a word to anyone Professor.” Albus nods glancing to Fawkes who chirps calmly. He hands her a piece of parchment.      </p>
<p>“Take this then, make sure and charm your work as you go. Be careful Miss Evans,” Albus nods as she wanders off. “Minerva?” The Transfiguration professor steps out from on the top of the stairs just behind the doors and into his office.      </p>
<p>“Is he alright Albus?” The deputy headmistress asks, watching his expression carefully, “did Tobias even fight the custody order?”      </p>
<p>“Strangely no, I have a suspicion he might know something, but I’ll be waiting for Severus to emerge from the dungeons before I call upon him,” Albus answers carefully, “he’s fine, a little shaken probably, but fine. The house elves have been checking up on him carefully, he’s not in need of Poppy’s care at the very least. I’m surprised the Mauraders haven’t made their way…”      </p>
<p>“HEY PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE!” The booming slightly cheery voice of Sirius Black wafts into his office.      </p>
<p>“Sorry Professor,” the much calmer tones of Remus Lupin follows as Black walks himself straight in with a questioning glance. James Potter is following after them with a slight frown, it’s a rather interesting sight for their head of house and him. No sign of Peter this time.      </p>
<p>“Severus is fine, if that’s your question. He’ll be back in class soon enough, unless you have something else to ask?” Minerva raises an eyebrow at the students. The three of them slouch visibly, “I assure you that he is okay, he’s not hurt or anything. I would ask why you three are here looking for him… Surely you aren’t still harassing the poor boy.”      </p>
<p>“Severus can handle himself, as you three are aware from how often Poppy is looking after you four,” Albus is sure that blasted twinkle is back in his eye.     </p>
<p>“Come along now, Professor Dumbledore has work to do and people to see,” Minerva shoos them out of his office and he peaks over at Fawkes who is chirping. He walks over to the phoenix and carefully pets through the silky feathers, earning a merry chirp from the bird. It disappears, as if to go check on his charge, he smiles and gets to his paperwork. Surely if Severus was in need of assistance right now Fawkes would let him know.    </p><hr/>
<p>SEVERUS     </p>
<p>He’s been in the dungeons, the actual dungeons of Hogwarts for about a month now. He’s decided that being a creature isn't so bad, Fawkes checks on him periodically for Dumbledore, and the house elves leave him food. They also bring him books when he asks. His teachers have sent a list of all the topics they’ve been covering. Magically his powers have increased, but his control is lacking. He’s set his bed on fire several times, and he doesn’t trust himself not to burn someone accidentally. The wards keeping the others away will fade once he has enough control, or at least that’s what Dumbledore’s patronus told him when he was raging one afternoon. He’s been fairly calm for the last few days, and summons a parchment to write a note asking if it would be okay for him to ask Lily down to see him. One of the house elves accepts it as soon as he finishes, rather than getting a note back he is surprised to hear a light knocking at the door. He opens it to see Dumbledore himself standing there with a plate of food.     </p>
<p>“You didn’t have to,” Severus starts opening the door for the headmaster politely. The old man transfigures a table and two elegant chairs for them.     </p>
<p>“Nonsense, I’ve been curious to see you for a few weeks,” he responds with a smile, “I also needed to see how things are going. If I see no threat to miss Evans I shall send for her at once. Did you have any troubles?”     </p>
<p>“I... had some minor difficulties, and I need to work on my temper. Short of the Maurdaers I should be okay,” he answers truthfully. Dumbledore nods and takes a sandwich for himself as he takes a seat, he pulls out some random items and transfigures them two goblets. A house elf brings over a pitcher of pumpkin juice for both of them.     </p>
<p>“I would recommend talking to them with myself present, I also would recommend Occulmency to help with your temper if that is what causes the issues,” Dumbledore takes a sip and Severus does the same.     </p>
<p>“That would be extremely helpful,” Severus nods, he’s not sure how much he wants to say, “I... do you know of what type of creature I am?” He’s curious how much Dumbledore needs to know, and how much he wants to know.     </p>
<p>“As your friend and guardian I would say tell as few people as you think wise. The more people that know, the more that will use it against you. As a Slytherin I don’t think I need to warn you what I mean by that. As your headmaster and your guardian it would be helpful to know so that I can better protect you and the other students,” Dumbledore answers, “the house elves haven’t told me anything either.” Severus nods sinking into his chair, he hadn’t considered that the headmaster wouldn’t know. He had figured that the headmaster would making fire or dragon puns already.     </p>
<p>“My creature is a dragon of some sort,” Severus answers, he watches Dumbledore’s expression carefully. The Professor brings a hand to his chin before writing a note and sending it off with a house elf. A potion bottle is brought back to him and handed to Severus.     </p>
<p>“Calming draught, you’ll need to carry a supply of it. I see no reason to keep you in the dungeons any longer than this Severus,” Dumbledore folds his hands, “if you have any issues with your temper you are welcome to come back down here. I will have the castle add a permanent room added for you, you’ll be allowed to move in starting next year. If there are any problems to hesitate to ask for your head of house, Minerva or myself. Do not tell anyone what your creature is Severus, besides Miss Evans as I’m sure you plan on doing. I will arrange a talk with the Marauders, with Miss Evans as well as Potter and Black who seem so willing to pick fights with you. Tell them you’ve come into your creature blood, but not what you are.”     </p>
<p>“Did Lily come to see you then?” Severus asks looking surprised.     </p>
<p>“She did two weeks after break, she was worried. She watched the memory you left and I gave her a pass for the restricted section. I’ll see you in my office when you are ready,” Dumbledore places a hand on his shoulder, “you will have a mate at some point Severus, but until then you need a light bond with someone who can help you. Please take the time to figure out who. As much as I appreciate Miss Evans, I advise you to pick a person who can both protect you and who can protect themselves until your mate appears.”     </p>
<p>“How do you know so much about it?” Severus asks in wonderment as he follows Dumbledore to the door way.     </p>
<p>“You are not the first of creature blood to come to this school, nor will you be the last, Mr. Malfoy also has creature blood, as does the Black family. Each creature needs specifics to survive and thrive, yours is fairly simple in all honestly. Just thank Merlin you’re not part Veela,” the Professor shudders, “I also had friends in similar situations. Miss Evans isn’t the only one who knows how to open a book.” Severus chuckles at that, he’s fairly surprised she wasn’t sorted into Ravenclaw.     </p>
<p>“I think keeping all of this between us would be for the best Professor,” he comments, “if you don’t mind?” Dumbledore shakes his head in agreement.     </p>
<p>“It would be my honor Severus,” he comments, “I’ll see to it that all the proper arrangements are made.”</p><hr/>
<p>With the details revealed to Lily, and the barest revealed to James Potter, Remus Lupin and Sirius Black his life was far less stressful immediately. They still bickered and dueled, but the viciousness was kept to a minimum. It was an uneasy truce, but they kept the rest of the Gryffindors from being roasted alive. Lily helped with as much as she could, and Severus offered her what little advice he could in her dealings with James Potter. It was easy to see she was heads over heels for the other boy, and since his reduced cruelty he wasn’t so bad. He gave her tips and suggestions, even helped on rare occasion get him back when he wandered dangerously close to doing something stupid.      </p>
<p>It was a regular scene to see them studying while the Mauraders were off causing trouble, having found Lucius Malfoy a fun target instead of him. The Malfoy heir enjoyed it almost as much as he did, and sometimes the two of them would partake in the trouble with a quiet Narcissa Black watching their backs.  Black’s cousin was almost as ruthless as he was, and it was humorous to watch him get a hex thrown his way when he was being an ass. Dumbledore attended to his creature’s needs discretely, mostly offering a place to hide when homework became overly frustrating. Professor McGonagall and the others tutored him after class for a few weeks until he was caught up with the rest of his year.</p>
<p>Well except Slughorn's class, Severus was years ahead in that class. He simply brewed all of the missed potions and submitted them for a grade.          </p>
<p>From there life became both complicated and simpler for Severus. No longer did he have to go home to Tobias and his abuse every holiday and summer. He was able to attain his potions mastery halfway through his seventh year, and was made to apprentice Slughorn which allowed him unending access to ingredients. He attended the Potter’s wedding with as many people as the happy couple could contact to attend. Then things went south.     </p>
<p>Lily ended up pregnant with Harry, Severus would assist while James was away at work. Strangely enough James Potter ended up being a good friend to him. While Lily was on leave from the Aurors he assisted Lily and James as needed. Often times occupying their guest room while Dumbledore was out and away. His creature needed a nest to tend to, assisting the Potters put him and them at ease. Lily chuckled, pointing out to James that no one was going to mess with Harry if that meant they were going to be incinerated.      </p>
<p>It was then that she and Severus revealed to James just what his creature was. Potter looked dumbfounded, but felt right at home with his presence. Severus however thought something was odd. It was deary cold Halloween night when shit started to hit the fan, Severus was visiting Lucius at the Malfoy estate when he got the news. Lily’s doe Patronous spell had burst in, and Severus turned his eyes to a paling Lucius Malfoy. Severus appeared through his wards into the air and shifted as he fell into his creature.      </p>
<p>His black scales glittering in the moonlight, he made for Godric’s Hollow as fast as his leathery wings could beat. He saw the first flash of green from up high, and the second one he was diving for the roof. As he bust through the roof his razor sharp talons pinning the man who dared attack his nest. He could hear his little charge crying from his crib, but he quieted down as Severus opened his jaws and let out a jet of emerald flames at the intruder beneath his claws. He could feel the crunch under him, but it didn’t take out the man.     </p>
<p>Harry was making confused noises from his crib, Severus released the threat and let another belch of emerald green in the wizard’s direction. He dipped his tail into the crib for the hatchling to play with and a pulse of magic struck them. A orangey red light, and then Severus was knocked back as the wizard attempted to kill Harry with the killing curse. The curse rebounds off the light and disintegrates the wizard, and he’s momentarily pinned across the walls as the hatchling screams helplessly.      </p>
<p>He’s stuck in his creature form, and his spines are more or less embedded in the stonework trapping him there. Harry is still screaming from his crib, and Severus tries to comfort him with soothing words. Soon enough there is hiccuping rather than crying coming from the hatchling, and Severus can feel liquid running down his tail. The spell clearly was powerful enough to pin him to the enchanted stones of the Potter home. Harry crawls out of his crib slowly, and comes to rest by his foreleg. The hatchling lays his hands on him, and Severus feels himself calm race through him.     </p>
<p>It takes a couple of minutes for it to sink in that the boy is his intended mate. His best friend’s child, the hatchling he’s helped care for is his intended parent. It’s a good thing Potter was dead, but he’s going to have to hide this from Black now… Which judging from the roar of the motorcycle outside, he’s here. He focuses on the child and is able to change back into his human form. He falls to the floor, and Harry crawls between his arms as he watches the world go black.</p><hr/>
<p>Dumbledore gave his mate to Petunia Evans, he doesn’t know if he should be grateful or murderous. He settles for brooding and harassing him pointing out what a terrible idea it is. Yet it’s brilliant. Tuney was one of the most powerful witches he’d ever met, but she hated wizard kind as much as Moldy shorts hated muggles. Yes, he calls him that. She was a jealous twit who went off and married an equally bigoted squib. Dursley was a whale of a squib, he hated wizarding world more than she did. Getting a muggle job, neither acknowledged the wizarding community at large, and Tuney didn’t practice at all.     </p>
<p>Severus had an overall bad feeling about it, he even told Albus such, but Albus Dumbledore had left a letter. All would be fine, Tuney would not dare to harm her nephew. Severus had to take several calming draughts to keep his temper in control, he can’t roam the castle setting tapestries on fire or Albus would have him locked up for certain. He’s already nervous about the whole thing, but he legally can’t do anything since he’s labeled as a creature.    </p>
<p>Slughorn however retired and Albus more than needed his help teaching these idiots a two or thing about potions. Severus had managed to get his mastery in the art despite his creature status, he still doesn’t know how Albus managed to talk him into teaching these brats. He’s still on the mend from being thrown into a stone wall as well, Poppy had taken a little pity on him and told Albus he was in no condition to be stressed out by the students brewing for two weeks. He had made it to class despite everything and issued book reading homework as well as in class knowledge and theory tests. He did allow the sixth and seventh year students to brew, but only things they were already in the process of. Fifth year students were assigned extra assignments to do with rarer ingredients and their properties to help them prep for their next assignment.     </p>
<p>Albus had been amused he went against Poppy’s recommendation, but he did sit in on the sixth and seventh year classes in case quick action was needed for the first week when Severus was still limping a bit. His students had been informed he was injured trying to save the Potters, (completely against his wishes he might add!) so none of them was in the mood to pick a fight with him while he was down. He even was forced into giving the loathsome lions some points as a couple offered to help him when he stumbled as his back let out a large twitch of pain. Minerva had noticed, and looked at him confused later. Albus on the other hand just twinkled brightly in his direction, Severus scowled for the rest of dinner.   </p>
