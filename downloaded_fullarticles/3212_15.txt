<p>"Harry Potter.....come to die," spoke a clear voice with a hissing quality. Voldemort tilted his head. It was as though the child wanted to die. Standing there, green eyes bowed to the forest floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Voldemort raised his yew wand and with a look of utter trump uttered the killing curse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meanwhile Harry held his breath. He was, for once thankful that Voldemort wished to grant him a quick death. With the green curse now moving at him, Harry closed his eyes and prayed to anyone listening that Death would take him and the Horcrux away quickly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Bang</em>! The power of the killing curse hitting Harry caused a loud thunderstorm to start even though there was no cloud in sight merely minutes ago. Rain was drenching the forest's ground, causing the floor to become a muddy and squishy mess.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Voldemort stood on straighter than ever before and for some odd reason he felt no lose over the soul piece he just killed. A grin spread on his face, for he knew without any proof that the Potter boy would not rise again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking around the clearing Voldemort spotted most of his Death Eaters edging closer to the dead Chosen One to see if he would not rise again. "Come now Narcissa, go see if the boys' truly dead."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything held its breath as the Lady Malfoy crouched next to the Boy-Who-Lived. After three seconds of the rain beating down on everyone's heads the deffley cloud of silence was broken by a uproar of celebration heard throughout the entire forbidden forest</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes to come face to face with nothing. A dark mist of black and white and nothing all at once. Harry didn't know where he was nor how long he spent standing there all he knew was that a woman's voice was calling his name and all he could do was stand facing the mesmerizing wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a few seconds or maybe hours a man's voice joined that of the woman's calling his name.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'Harry! Harry! Harry!" Now more voices were calling his name and if Harry focused enough he could detect something familiar about the voices the longer he stood looking into the cloud of Nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Harry.....!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Harry?</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>'Harry...!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Who's Harry?</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A woman's shriek of desperation could be heard from somewhere, "Harry James Potter as your mother I command you to come back Now!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mother? Who's mother? Harry's? But he wasn't Harry, so why should he listen? Harry shook his head, this was so confusing. What Harry found was that now quiet whispers were calling out of the Nothing. Whispers that he could make sense of. They called to him and he could do nothing but follow the lullaby the whispers were creating.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was about to step into the black mist of nothing were it not for a small hand that grabbed him by the leg. Harry looked down. A small creature made of muscles and tissue was hanging on to him with a grip of iron. It was crying words of fear while shaking uncontrollably. Harry looked down at it with a puzzled frown. The creature must be afraid of being left alone. And with that thought in mind the green eyed boy took the disfigured creature in his arms and bravely stepped into the dark mist.</p>
