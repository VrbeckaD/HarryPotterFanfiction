</p><p>Ah, yes, there he was, standing in the tall grassy plains, staring down at the old, rotting bones. The one and only, Draco Malfoy, had solved yet another case. Henry Lackbottom, a middle-aged man that went missing 3 years ago, was found dead. The case wasn’t all that hard for Draco, as if piecing it together like a logical puzzle.</p><p>It had only been four years since the battle of Hogwarts and Draco was still slowly recovering; mentally and physically. He was lucky enough that the Investigation Unit only cared about your skill and not your past. If that was the case, no matter how good he was, he would’ve been turned away faster than a snitch.</p><p align="left">Now finished with his latest case, Draco sat in his office doing nothing in particular. That was until his assistant, Nicola, came in with more papers.</p><p>“Here you are, Malfoy,” she said coolly, “It’s your next case.”</p><p>Draco watched as Nicola strided out of his office. She was definitely a straight-to-the-point women, or in a manner of speaking: blunt. Sighing, Draco opened his next case, figuring it’ll be just like his other ones. Propping his right leg over the other, Draco began to read: <em> Case file #394. </em>Draco read the missing person’s name and his breathe hitched.</p><p>

</p><p>
  <em> Harry Potter, victim, was last seen at Flourish &amp; Blotts. Memory from story owner (Terrance Watson) can be found in the Evidence Volt. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco re-read the briefing for the case over and over. Of all the cases that he could be assigned, he would be assigned to find the Saint Potter. Nevertheless, he’d have to at least <em> try </em> to find Potter. Heaving a sigh, Draco stood up and headed to the Evidence Vault.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center"># # #</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The sound of a bell could be heard as the May breeze rushed against the front windows of Flourish &amp; Blotts. In stepped Harry with tattered blue jeans and an oversized t-shirt, just as the description said, but his eyes seemed dull; extremely dull, almost lifeless.</p><p>“You wouldn’t happen to still be open, would you?” Harry voiced horsley. The shopkeeper, in shock, quietly nodded his head. “Ah, am I troubling you at all?” Harry asked politely, with slight fear in his eyes, shifting uncomfortably.</p><p>Snapping out of it the shopkeeper replied, “No! Not at all! Please, if there’s anything I can help you with allow me!”</p><p>Harry gave a visual sigh of relief and gave a small smile, “That would be much appreciated. I’m actually looking for <em> Beyond the Bayou </em> by <em> Kate Chopin </em> and <em> Soldier’s Home </em> by <em> Ernest Hemingway</em>.” The owner, Terrance, gave him the oddest look.</p><p>“Ah, quite old books! And by Americans at that!” His face lit up immediately, “If I remember correctly, Hemingway was extremely popular in his time. Might I ask, out of curiosity, if you know the dates of the books?”</p><p>At that, Harry’s eyes lit up just the slightest, "<em>Beyond the Bayou </em> was published on November 7, 1891! And <em> Soldier’s Home </em>was originally published in 1925, but later had an adaption written in 1977.” said Harry excitedly.</p><p>Terrance looked at him in bewilderment; he hadn’t expected such a young man to know about such old novelist. Nodding in satisfaction, Terrance smiled at Harry. “Looks like you know your stuff! I’m glad some people actually like to get to know about the books before reading them.” He laughed off.</p><p>Harry’s light faded from his eyes. “Actually, sir, I’ve already read these…” His voice was pained and quiet, “My original copies were destroyed just over a month ago.”</p><p>Terrance’s eye’s gave a look of pity and sadness. “I understand, my boy. You must love the stories deeply, yes?” Harry nodded sullenly, looking to the ground. “I’ll just go fetch them real quick and you can be on your way!”</p><p>Terrance made his way into the back room and Harry walked around the store. Stopping at a shelf, he pulled out<em> The Second Tree From The Corner. </em></p><p>Flipping throughout the books he suddenly stops, “<em>Ever have bizarre thoughts?” </em>Harry quoted from the book, then he started to mumble to himself. “<em>No</em>,” he said quietly. “<em>I never have any bizarre thoughts.</em>” “<em>You kept inching away… You’re scared…</em>” “<em>Does it?</em>” “<em>Yeah, I suppose it does.</em>” Harry’s muttering was almost like a conversation with himself, but anyone with common sense would know he’s reading bits of the book aloud. <em> </em></p><p>Terrance came back just as Harry was about to read another line. “You’re in luck! These were the only ones we had.” said Terrance. He seemed to notice the book in Harry’s hand and smiled, “You just seem to like all the old classics. I’ll let you have that one if you promise to do me one thing.” He said. Harry glanced up, nervous and almost fearful. Nevertheless he still nodded. “Make sure you stay safe and come back to visit some times!” Terrance gave a large smile.</p><p>Harry nodded once again, with a softened face. “I’d liked that very much, thank you sir.” Paying his books, Harry gave his thanks once again and left.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center"># # #</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Draco had re-watched the memory over and over. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary to him; just normal Potter, just getting normal books. But he must say, why wasn’t there more of an uproar when <em> the </em> Harry Potter had gone missing? Surely Granger wouldn’t hide that from everyone, or she’d be lapsing to be like the last Ministry of Magic. He made a mental note to go visit her later.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center"># # #</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Draco knocked respectfully of the door before waiting, “Come in,” Came a muffled voice from the other side.</p><p>Draco calmly stepped into the large room. Behind the desk sat Hermione Granger, the Ministress of Magic.</p><p>“Granger,” Draco politely stated, “I hear you are doing well.” She gave a short nod before gathering her papers and paying full attention to Draco.</p><p align="left">“I am, thank you Malfoy. I see you’re as busy as always.” She looked at him wearily. “As fun as an evening chat might be, I know you’re not here for that. What are you up to?” She went straight to the point.</p><p>And Draco wasted no time in replying, “I was assigned Potter’s case.” Granger’s breathe hitched and she paled slightly.</p><p>“Well,” She trailed off, “What is it then?” Draco studied her for a short period of time.</p><p align="left">“I’ve come to ask about your last encounter with Potter. What was his health like? Clothes? Any problems at the time?” He went straight to the point. Granger stayed quiet before sighing.</p><p>“Harry was extremely distant and, from when I last saw him, he looked healthy to me.” She answered. Draco opened his mouth to question further, but was interrupted. “I talked to him on May 1st, the year he went missing. And I’m assuming you would like to go through his belongings?”</p><p align="left">Draco closed his mouth and gave a quick nod. “Yes, if that isn’t too much. It might help me identify whether it was forced or not.” Granger gave him a look. Why would Harry willingly disappear without telling anyone? Harry was her best friend; she trusted him with her life.</p><p>“That’s perfectly fine. Though, you may want to ask Ginny for more of his belongings. I only have a small part.” Granger concluded their conversation by leading Draco to a small vault and handing hims a fairly large cardboard box.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center"># # #</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Draco stood in front of the classic looking cabin. Taking in the every detail, from the way the garden slightly withered to the way the house seemed to sway. Stepping up to the wooden door, Draco knocked on it before stepping back. Shortly after, the door opened revealing a refined Ginny.</p><p>She gave Draco a small smile before inviting him in, “Come in, pardon the mess, and have a seat. I’ll make some tea.” Draco did so, studying the way Ginny carried herself. She seemed relaxed, considering the situation. Draco took in the old-modern west kitchen and seemed pleased. Potter’s fiancé had fair taste in design, even with pots and pan scattered across the room.</p><p>Ginny could be seen quickly making two cups of tea and quietly humming to herself. Finishing them up, she set one in from of Draco and one down for her. Draco gave a polite ‘Thank you’ before turning his attention pass Ginny. A young girl stood in the doorway with a small, stuffed bunny. “Mummy, who is this?” she asked innocently.</p><p>Ginny’s face soften and she replied, “Just someone here to ask Mummy questions. Nothing’s gonna happen, sweetheart.” The girl nodded and headed back.</p><p>“Potter had a daughter?” Draco asked more to himself more than to Ginny.</p><p align="left">Ginny visibly scrunches up her nose, “No, heavens no!” Draco was confused.</p><p>“Adopted?” He questioned.</p><p>“No. That’s my daughter, Mary! My husband is Mark.” said Ginny. “Didn’t you know? Harry and I broke off our engagement!”</p><p>Realization overcame Draco. If he remembered correctly, he did see something about it in the <em> Daily Prophet </em>. It made sense now, but something was still off. “Now that you mention it,” Draco started. “I remember now. But that doesn’t explain your calmness of this situation.” He challenged.</p><p>Ginny looked hesitant, but answered Draco, “Is there a reason to not be calm?”</p><p>Draco looked at her shocked momentarily. “Well, considering he was close with you <em> and </em> your family, I thought you would be more concerned about Potter.”</p><p>“Why should I worry about him? Yes, we’re friends, but we’ve gone our separate ways. I’m happy and I don’t need to be worrying about someone who’s probably dead by now.” Ginny retorted. At that moment, Draco felt a surge of anger come upon him. It was most unusual for him, seeing as it was <em> just </em> Potter’s case, but there was a sense to prove that Potter was okay and that he was going to be the one to find him.</p><p align="left">“You shouldn’t give up, even if you’ve gone separate ways. He wouldn’t of done that to you.” Draco fought back. He could see the small guilt in Ginny’s eyes when he said that, but it was gone as soon as it came.</p><p>“All the same. I have a family now, and I’d rather not waste my time trying to help a lost cause.”</p><p>Draco sighed, “I’m not here to talk about your love life. I’m just here to collect Potter’s belongings as evidence and clues.”</p><p>Ginny reluctantly got up and went into the other room. Coming back shortly after, she set a rather large, wooden box on the table. “This is what he has here. The key to his vault is in there for the rest of his belongings if you need it.”</p><p>Draco looked into the box and noticed pile of notebooks. Picking one up, he flipped through it and saw each page filled with elegant handwriting. He looked at it in disbelief. He hadn’t expected Potter to actually write these day, much less have <em> neat </em> handwriting.</p><p>Nodding to Ginny, he spoke, “Thank you. I appreciate it. Is there anything else that may help me? Like a memory or an untouched room?” Ginny looked hesitant for a moment, staring directly at Draco.</p><p>“We’ve already moved all his belongings.” She finally said. It seemed like minutes of silences to Draco before Ginny sighed, “I might have somethings of use, but you must not tell anyone.” She sounded frantic. “Harry didn’t like talking about it, but if they’ll help in the slightest, then I’ll give them. They’re memories.” She finished. She seemed slightly worried about Harry, but as Draco studied her, he knew it was an act.</p><p align="left">Giving a disappointed sigh - he seemed to be doing that a lot in this visit - he got into one of his coat pockets and got out a small vial. He always had some on hand for times like these. As Ginny took out her wand, Draco got the vial ready along with the cap. He watched Ginny take the memories out in multiple strands and place them into the vial. Placing them into the vial, he nodded his head in thanks again and left.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center"># # #</p><p align="center"> </p><p>As soon as Draco got back he went to straight to the pensieve, pouring Ginny’s memory into it and sucking in a quick breath. Sticking his head in the pensieve, he watched as the memory turned into black clouds and swirled in place. The small clouds were soon replaced with a small room with a bed and a dresser to the side of it.</p><p>
  <em> “Ginny! Do you smell that?” Harry’s voice could be heard from the other rooms. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ginny rushed into the room where Harry stood in the middle of the room, look pale. “Smell what, Harry? I don’t smell anything.” Ginny looked unsettled as Harry frantically searched the large master bedroom. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “No, that can’t be! It’s so strong. How can you not smell it? It smells like rotting flesh!” Harry was growing paler and paler. He looked fairly skinny, but not deprived of food. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Dear, calm down a moment. You might just be tired. Let’s open a window, yes?” Ginny suggested as she walked over to a window and unlatching it. Harry was running his hands through his hair. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “That can’t be! I just woke-” </em>
</p><p align="left">The memory started to fade to the next, as the dark clouds appeared and Draco was left with multiple questions. The clouds begin to shift again and this time Draco appear in the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>
  <em> Harry and Ginny sat in one of the wall tables, having a cups of tea. Suddenly Ginny started coughing and covered her mouth. Harry looked at her worriedly. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Ginny! Are you okay? Should we take you to St. Mungo’s Hospital?” He asked desperately. He seemed very worried about it. “Maybe I should go to! I feel a cough coming on.” He continued. Now it was obvious something was wrong. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “No, Honey, we’re both fine. I just had something in my throat. Nothing serious. Why don’t we head back to the house?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “But Ginny! You could-” Harry stopped talking with the look Ginny gave him and reluctantly nodded. Quickly paying for the tea, Harry and Ginny set off. </em>
</p><p>Draco watched as the ex-couple faded off. Something unnatural was happening to Harry, and no one seemed to had noticed it at the time. Worry enveloped Draco as he plunged into the next memory.</p><p align="left">
  <em> Ginny walked into the familiar bedroom and saw Harry sitting at the desk writing. He was hunched over, scribbling furiously. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Harry, what are you writing?” She asked in  sincere interest. Harry looked over his shoulder, startled momentarily, but went back to writing. Ginny looked annoyed before asking again, “Harry, what are you writing?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> This time Harry stopped writing and turned around, responding completely, “I was just writing my thoughts. I read somewhere it’s bad to keep everything inside, so I decided to write them down.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ginny watching Harry shocked momentarily before smiling at him. “That’s very liable of you. I’m glad you found a way. Here let me read!” She excitedly reached for the notebook, ignoring the protest of Harry. Draco quickly caught a sight of a date in the corner and made a mental note. He went back to watching the memory as her smile soon fell and she look at Harry with a sad glimpse. “Harry…” </em>
</p><p><br/> The memory soon faded and Draco appeared back in his office. The memories he’d just witnessed all had something in common: Harry was different, very different. Then there was the notebook. He was sure it was in the box Ginny had given him. He just needed to find the date: May 15th, 1998. Well, at least Draco had some sort of starting point.</p>
