    <p>
  <span>Harry couldn’t believe what he was seeing. The huge cauldron emitted puffs of smoke that pooled over the edge. The once bubbling cauldron was now empty except for the tall, inhumane figure standing inside. Harry couldn’t stop staring at the pasty white skin, the bald head… the red slitted eyes. Harry shuddered and desperately lashed out against the tombstone he was tied to. This… thing looked like a monster, it was a monster! There was no doubt in his mind that this was Voldemort.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry kept struggling against the stone, praying that it would budge. However, after pushing and pushing, the scythe relentlessly stayed still. He watched with dread as Voldemort called his followers. The longer he stayed here, the more his chances of survival decreased. He couldn’t help but glance to the left where Cedric lay. He was so still. His glassy eyes stared straight ahead, unseeing, his face stuck in a confused and shocked expression. Harry quickly turned his head away. He couldn’t look anymore at  who he once thought of as a comrade and friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry quickly focused back on the problem at hand when he heard his name and mentally reprimanded himself for zoning out. Voldemort was walking towards him, a malicious smile etched on his snake-like face. With each step Voldemort took, pressure started to build up inside his scar. The pressure soon turned to a pounding throb when Voldemort stood in front of him. Harry panted hard as he tried to stay standing. Harry watched in horror and panic as Voldemort lifted his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can touch you now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then unimaginable pain exploded in Harry’s scar, spreading to every inch of Harry’s body. He screamed in agony as he writhed in the ropes tying him to the headstone. It felt like his skin was peeling off and his bones shattering into tiny pieces. Harry couldn’t form any coherent thoughts besides wanting it to end. When unconsciousness came, he gratefully accepted it.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Harry opened his eyes, it was to a dull, grey sky filled with… was that smoke? Harry blinked in confusion. He sat up slowly, wincing from the pain all over. His foggy brain began to clear and memories started to drift back to him. He was in the maze, Cedric and himself had touched the cup, then Cedric di-... then Voldemort came back. He remembered pain but that was it. He must’ve passed out but that didn’t explain where he was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looked around. He was lying by the entrance to an alleyway in some big town or city. There were a few people walking around but nobody seemed to have noticed him. Judging by the sky, it must be early morning, maybe 7am? Harry carefully stood up, bracing himself against a wall of a building to help. To his delight, the pain he had previously felt seemed to be dying down, now it was only a dull ache. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He stepped out of the alley and frowned. Something was off. He looked down at himself and gasped. He held his hands out. They were so small! He flexed his fingers and observed the foreign hands. His eyes quickly scanned the rest of his body and felt panicked when he noticed that the rest of his body was younger. His breathing quickened the longer he stared at his de-aged form. He must be nine or ten years old. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A cough startled him out of his observation and he quickly looked towards the sound. A tall figure stood by the entrance of the alley, blocking out most of the light and turning the figure into a shadow. Harry unconsciously took a step back when the man approached him before berating himself. He was not some child! He was fourteen - nearly fifteen - year old wizard! The man crouched down to his level, letting more light into the backstreet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here, child? Where are your parents?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man’s voice was gentle but firm. Harry didn’t know what to say since he himself didn’t know how he got here. One minute he was being tortured by Voldemort and the next he was waking up in an alley confused, not that he could tell this man that. He was pretty sure this man was a muggle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well?” the adult asked, a bit more demanding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Umm… I don’t know how I got here” Harry replied, “and my parents are dead. I live with my aunt and uncle.” he said after a stern look from the man. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t know why he was telling this muggle that information but he wasn’t in the right mindset to worry about that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man seemed to frown as he looked at him. Harry belatedly realised he was looking at the small tremors in Harry’s arms that he just realised he had. He wrapped his arms around himself to try and stop it but no matter what he did, they just didn’t seem to leave. It must be the aftershock of whatever happened back in the graveyard. Harry remembered the lesson when Professor Moody talked about the Unforgivables and he was pretty sure it was mentioned that the victims had to be given some type of potion to stop the post-shocks of the cruciatus curse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was then drawn back to the present by the man moving towards him. His face seemed to have smoothed out a more gentle yet sorrowful expression, leaving Harry extremely confused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay, young man, everything’s gonna be alright.” said the man as he reached forward and gently grabbed his arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was still confused as the man began to pull him up and tugged him towards the main street. Once they had stepped out into the light, Harry looked towards the adult grabbing his arm. The grip was surprisingly soft for the appearance of the man. He was dressed in some weird uniform with a big ‘W’ stamped on it. He had a big helmet with the same letter on it and Harry couldn’t help but feel a bit apprehensive of him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man quickened his strides when he was met with little resistance from Harry - who was really too shocked and confused to react - and began to head down the street. As they were walking, Harry couldn’t help but feel like he had stumbled onto a movie set. Everything was basically in ruins! Rubble littered the streets and buildings were destroyed. No structure was left untouched; there were either chunks missing from walls, boarded up doors or shattered windows. It was truly terrifying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What had happened?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry furrowed his brow in concentration while the man dragged him down the street. He needed to get back to Hogwarts. He needed to warn Dumbledore about Voldemort. What if this was his doing? Harry’s attention was then drawn to the man holding his hand as he began to ask where he lived and who his parents were. Harry could only stare at him. He didn’t know why this stranger wanted to know those personal details - it wasn’t really since most of the wizarding world knew about it - and instead decided to ask his own questions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man gave him an odd look, like he couldn’t believe how he didn’t know. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Child, you do realise our country is at war right now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We have been at war for nearly two years now. Surely you know of it, even for one as young as you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looked around in horror at the devastating scene.  Was there really a war going on? He had never heard of any war whenever he went back to Privet Drive, though his Aunt and Uncle wouldn’t have told him if there was. But Hermione would’ve known, right? She is a muggleborn and she would’ve been concerned for her family if there was a war… but maybe Hermione never told us because she didn’t want us to worry? Ron wouldn’t have understood because he was oblivious to most muggle things and maybe Hermione already assumed Harry knew. He decided to push this topic to the side and focus on the present.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where are we going, Sir?” Harry asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, you mentioned you lost your aunt and uncle and I’m guessing you have no other relatives,” he looked at Harry for confirmation and continued when he nodded, “so, I have to take you to a place where you can stay.” he explained while pointing to a dull building up ahead. “Wool’s Orphanage. It’s the closest one around here and is probably happy to take you in. Blimey, with the way this war is going, Germany is probably gonna cause all the children to become orphans.” The last sentence was whispered to himself but Harry still heard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s Germany got to do with this war?” Harry asked, he hoped to get some answers out of this man while he could. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How can you not know about any of this?!” the man exclaimed, “With the way Hitler is bombing and attacking everyone, surely you would’ve known about this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry blinked. Hitler? As in, Adolf Hitler? He remembered learning about him in the Surrey Primary school. But, didn’t that happen in World War Two? Like, all the way back in 1938? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s the date today?” Harry feverishly asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure you’re okay, son? Did you hit your head during one of the raids?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just answer my question! Please?” Harry almost begged. His mind was thinking of ludicrous things, things that couldn’t possibly be true, things he didn’t want to be true, things that fit perfectly and made sense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Umm, it's the 28th of June, 1941?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no no no no….” Harry murmured. This couldn’t be happening! How… how did he travel through time? No wonder Hermione never talked about a war, it’s because she didn’t even exist yet (and wasn’t that a weird thought)! Okay… calm down Harry. You need to think logically. This muggle most likely thinks we’re amnesiac or something, let’s not give him any more reason to think so. Just get through wherever he’s taking us and then we can go back to Hogwarts. Dumbledore is probably around somewhere since he is really old in the future and he’ll know what to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The pair approached a tall, dreary building with firm iron gates. A sign on top read ‘Wool’s Orphanage’. Children could be seen running around outside; playing with their meagre toys. The man - he still didn’t know his name - led him to the front doors where he knocked loudly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a moment, the door was opened by a woman dressed in an old fashioned dress that went down to her ankles. The dress had long sleeves with a plain flower embroidered on the lower part of the dress. Buttons lined the front of her chest and a white cloth seemed to rest on her shoulders, almost like a baby’s bib. Her blond hair was tied up by braids that were then wrapped around in a bun. This woman looked like she had just emerged from one of those old World War 2 photographs that were portrayed in his primary school. It just seemed to ram home the fact that he wasn’t in his own time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Philip! What a lovely surprise!” The women said while straightening her posture. She smiled brightly at the man whose hand had just rested on Harry’s shoulder. Her eyes held a deep emotion that looked similar to the ones Mrs Weasley directed at her husband.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Martha, good afternoon. I’m afraid I’ve come here as part of my Warden duties. This young fellow,” he patted Harry for emphasis, “was found out on the streets. He’s unfortunately lost his parents and seems to be quite shocked if the small tremors he had when I first found him were anything to go by.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh you poor thing,” Martha bent down to stroke his cheek carefully, “it breaks my heart to see all these innocent children suffer because of a war that has nothing to do with them. Come inside, we’ll need to get Mrs Cole.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Martha held the door open for the both of them to walk through before guiding them down a hallway. Harry was then gently pushed through a door into what must be an office. There was a desk in the middle with stacks of paper on either end and a sharp lady seated behind.  She looked up from whatever she was writing when they entered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Martha, whatever is the matter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mrs Cole, this young boy was found on the streets, he’s lost his parents and has to join us at the orphanage.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Another one?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sadly. The longer the Germans attack us, the more orphans we’re gonna get.” Martha responded, her eyes getting a bit teary. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph, we’re having to rationalize our food supply and clothing, and this is the 3rd child in two weeks! We’re running out of rooms in this building and I’m afraid, this child is going to have to stay in room 213.” Mrs Cole announced gravely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But,” Martha gasped, “There will be incidents between…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What choice do we have? The child needs a room to stay in and there is space in that room. He will just have to get used to it.” The old lady spoke sharply and Martha bowed her head in defeat. For some reason, Harry was pretty sure they weren’t referring to him.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” Harry gulped when Mrs Cole looked at him, “what is your full name and date of birth?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, my name is Harry James Potter and I’m born on...” he paused and tried to quickly do the math. If he looked like a 10 year old (he still couldn’t believe that and resolved to figure it out later) and it was 1941, then he would’ve been born in...“July 31st 1931.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mrs Cole nodded stiffly as she wrote it down. She then looked up at Martha and told her to get him ready. With a quick nod, Martha began to usher him out of the room, leaving Mrs Cole and that man - Philip - alone to discuss the paperwork. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was then led to what he would presume was the laundry room. There, he was fitted for some clothes before he was then taken on a tour of the building. The orphanage was surprisingly clean but that was the only compliment Harry could give it. The rooms were grim and sombre and the children all wore mismatched clothing that had far too many sewing patches in. It didn’t look like they ate much either and some children were sporting bruises and red marks along their hands and Harry wasn’t too sure if he wanted to find out what or who the source was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Finally, Harry was then led down a corridor to a room with the number 213 inscribed on it. The inside was pretty small; there was only one bed, a wardrobe and desk. It had a window facing the front courtyard where children could be seen playing down below. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A new bed will be brought in and you’ll be sharing this room with another orphan. He’s not here at the moment but will be back sometime tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded at the matron. He liked her, she seemed quite kind and compassionate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For now, let’s head back down to the Dining Hall for lunch. You must be starving.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They left the room after dumping Harry’s new clothes in the now-his side of the wardrobe. It was weird how when they went to move the other orphan’s stuff into the right side of the cupboard, it was surprisingly empty. Harry guessed orphans didn’t really have much personal possessions but still, it was completely empty!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As they approached the Dining Hall, Martha turned to him, “I’m going to have to go now, I eat with all the other staff members and I’m sure you’d like to get to know the other children. Just queue up over there to receive your meal and go sit by one the tables. Got it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yep.” Harry said as Martha rubbed his hair before walking towards where the staff eat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry walked over to where the children were queuing up and waited to receive his lunch. It seemed to be some type of broth. There were some potatoes, cabbage and other small vegetables but the meal looked very watery and diluted. He chose to sit on one of the tables in the far corner - he wasn’t up for socialising with children yet - and began to eat. The food was okay but he knew it wouldn’t make him full. Oh well, at least he had experience with that. He finished off his food quickly and headed back to his new room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he got there, he noticed another bed had been added along the right wall and went to go lay on it. Now that he was finally alone, Harry allowed himself to scrutinize the events that had transpired today. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had somehow been transported through time. Time! Never in his life would he’d have thought this would happen. Hermione had said that time turners could only go back a maximum of five hours before it became unstable and Harry was pretty sure he had travelled over fifty years into the past. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But what did that mean? Was he in danger? Hermione always said bad things happened to people meddling with time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, Hermione would know what to do…” he mumbled to himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A soft knock at the door made him sit up. Martha peeked her head around and smiled at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello, do you mind if I come in?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not at all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She walked in and sat down next to him. Harry couldn’t help but notice her aversion to the other bed and briefly wondered why. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“During lunch, the rest of the caretakers were told of your arrival so you may see other staff members introduce themselves to you. Mary is one of my closer friends at Wool’s and works down in the nursery. She knows how to make books and she’d sell them to bookstores to earn some extra money for the orphanage. She’s made it a tradition to make a book for every orphan and when she heard of you, she’d left quickly to her room.” Martha said, “She’d already had a pre-made book and just had to engrave your name into it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stared at the leather book in Martha’s offered hand. He accepted the dark brown journal and traced his fingers on his golden name. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry James Potter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The book looked familiar but he didn’t know from where. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A lot of the other orphans use their books as journals or scrapbooks. I think it’s a good idea to write down our thoughts, less we lose them. Whenever I journal, I find my thoughts more clear and focused after.” Martha said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry glanced up at the woman, intrigued by her suggestion. With all this time travelling nonsense, he definitely felt overwhelmed. If he wrote it down, he might be able to figure out how he got here and, more importantly, how to get back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But what if somebody read it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was stuck in a muggle orphanage and he didn’t know how he’d explain to them why he was writing about time travelling... </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A thought struck him. He could just say he wanted to become an author. No one could be suspicious of that: a young orphan wanting to connect with his parents through the stories they’d supposedly told him as a child. They’d probably feel sympathy for him and won’t push the subject. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Martha’s voice brought him out of his contemplation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, seems like you’re interested in it, I’ll leave you to do whatever you’re planning.” Martha winked before standing up and walking towards the exit, “Pencils are in the drawer of the desk.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The soft click of the door closing signalled Harry was all alone. He turned towards the worn-out wooden desk that stood between the two beds. It looked old. Definitely second-hand and sported a few dents here and there. However, it seemed to be the most maintained out of all the other desks Harry had glimpsed at in the other childrens’ rooms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sat down in the chair and opened the drawer. He was confused when he saw the contents. 3 pencils; 2 that were too short to use, and the remnants of a rubber. There was barely anything in it! His ‘roommate’ had nothing in his wardrobe and hardly nothing in his desk. Harry was getting more and more confused. Did orphans really own so little? He’d known orphanages didn’t get much money but he’d thought they’d have more than this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head. It wasn’t like he could do anything. He had to focus on his situation and find a way back to his time. He opened his new notebook, grabbed the one usable pencil, and got to work. He dedicated a few pages on the events before he got sent back, writing in detail about the portkey, the graveyard, and Voldemort’s speech. Next, he wrote everything he knew about time-travel, from time-turners to the multiple lectures Hermione had said. He had a lot to write.</span>
