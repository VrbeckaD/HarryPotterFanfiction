          <div class="userstuff"><p>Something splattered on the wall when Queenie opened her front door, startling her.</p><p>Despite the surprise, a quick check told her the mood inside wasn’t worth worrying over, all the fluctuating thoughts mainly positive, if not a little hectic. Not knowing what to expect, she took a wary peek inside.</p><p>Her home looked like a battlefield. The dining table was upturned as a sort of barricade, the chairs legs to ward off impending attackers, and Jacob huddled behind it as it was barraded with eggs that splattered every which way.</p><p>There were eggs <em>everywhere. </em>On the walls, the floor, dripping from the ceiling, staining the couch where the mess was only just beginning to reach the living room.

The stains on the walls vanished. “How about we go out instead?”</p><p>Newt grinned. Egg shells littered his hair lke snow. “That sounds like a cracking good idea."</p></div>
