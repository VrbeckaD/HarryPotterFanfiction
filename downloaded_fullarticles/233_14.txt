    <p>Harry Potter, Head Auror, started as Draco Malfoy poofed into his office via Floo. Draco stumbled out of the fireplace and plopped into the chair across from Harry, barely containing his giggles.</p><p>"Hi!" Draco exclaimed. "I just got done hijacking a Muggle vehicle called a BNW. You should have seen the owner's face when his car zoomed off without a driver!" He gave in to his urges and cracked up, pounding his fist on the table.</p><p>"It's almost like they're not used to seeing unmanned vehicles taking on a life of their own," Harry replied sarcastically. Then he sighed. "Draco, I thought we had an agreement. Remember Rule #6? No flooing into my office while I'm working! And by the way, it's a BMW, not a BNW."</p><p>"BMW, BNW, tomayto, tomahto." Draco picked up the paper Harry had been studying. "It doesn't look like you're working." On the paper was a picture of Harry and Draco in front of the London Eye, smiling and waving. Their third date. </p><p>Harry blushed furiously and snatched the picture back. "That's beside the point. I have work TO DO. I am currently at the office. That counts. And speaking of rules, Rule #1: Do not disturb Muggles! How many times do I have to tell you?"</p><p>Draco began to mockingly count on his fingers. One, two, three fingers went up. He gazed into the distance with a thoughtful expression, putting up more fingers. "Well, seeing as you've done it 27 times already, how about we round it up to 30? Nice, even number. So... 3 more times?"</p><p>Harry sighed yet again and took a good lookat his boyfriend. Suddenly, he pulled him in for a long, passionate kiss. After a bit of steamy making out, Draco had ended up straddling Harry's lap, facing him. Shirts laying forgotten on the floor, they touched every bit of each other that could be reached, Draco sighing into Harry's mouth when the latter reached his ass and started massaging it. Harry chuckled. "You're such an idiot sometimes."</p><p>"That's why you love me, isn't it though?" Draco said breathily as Harry's hands started to make their way around to his crotch. But they were disturbed by a sharp knock on the door. Harry and Draco pulled apart sharply. Draco jumped off Harry's lap, scooped up his shirt and ran to the fireplace. </p><p>"See you tonight, chosen one," Draco whispered, grinning mischeviously before disappearing through the Floo. Harry hurriedly threw on his shirt and tie, attempting to smooth out his hair and hide the picture at the same time. </p><p>"Come in!" he called. </p><p>"That took long enough," came a sweet but sharp voice from the now open door. "Hello, husband."</p><p>Harry winced. "Hello, Ginny."</p><p>Ginny walked in, her heels clicking as she gazed around Harry's office. "This place is a mess, Harry. You really need to keep it cleaner." She started to shuffle papers around on the desk.</p><p>"NO!" Harry cried, jumping up to stop her. Ginny paused, startled.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Er... I have an order. It's organized chaos. I promise I'll pick it up, figure out a system." Harry tried not to look at the picture, just barely peeking out from the bottom of the pile Ginny had scooped together. He let out a breath he didn't realize he'd been holding as she let go of the pile.</p><p>"Very well. What time will you be home tonight?"</p><p>Harry blinked, startled by the sudden change in subject. "Er... what?"</p><p>Ginny sighed, rolling her eyes. "We have a dinner with the Malfoys, remember? Trying to foster good relations and all that? We're supposed to be there by 7. I want you home no later than 6:15, we need time to get ready."</p><p>Harry gulped. Now he knew why Draco had sounded so pleased when he said goodbye. "I can probably do 6:15... I might only be able to do 6:30, though. Minister Kingsley wants us in tip-top shape and I have to run the course with the new recruits."</p><p>Ginny sighed again. "No later than 6:30."</p><p>"Deal."</p><p>She paused as she was walking out the door. "I'm sorry for snapping at you, I'm just stressed. You know, hormones and all that."</p><p>Harry nodded. He stepped up to his wife and hugged her, placing his hands around her already growing stomach. "I can hardly wait for our second child. I'm sorry for being forgetful. I love you."</p><p>She leaned back, folding her hands over his. "I love you too. Now go whip those NR's into shape!"</p><p>Harry smiled, pressing a kiss to her forehead and letting her go. "They won't know what hit them."</p>
