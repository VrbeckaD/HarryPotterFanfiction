    <p>He'd been taught from the day he was born that he was inherently superior to others. It was obvious in the way his father walked chest-first as though he owned everything he saw. When Lucius turned his nose up at the women in the store buying paint for their house, when he crossed sides of the street upon seeing a black man, when he cut in front of poorer families in line. Everything Lucius did, Narcissa followed, and Draco followed behind, swallowing the lies he was fed all his life like they were his only source of nutrients.</p><p>He was twelve, sitting crosslegged on his bed at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, the first public school he'd ever been to. He'd been an online school student for the earlier years: his parents didn't love him enough to homeschool him but still wanted him to have an inherent sense of superiority over others.</p><p>He was twelve the first time he questioned his parents.</p><p>The lights were off, the only source of light the glow of his computer screen. He was doing a special advanced-placement essay for Muggle Studies despite the class being for third years. The current unit was on different important historical moments throughout Muggle history. Currently, their studies laid in 1940s Germany.</p><p>He had twenty-four tabs open, each one glaring up at him with statistics and facts and horrors he didn't know of and hoped he'd never experience. The Holocaust. Concentration camps. Serial numbers. Twin experiments. Gas chambers. It went on and on. He needed to look away. He couldn't look away.</p><p>He was awake until three in the morning.</p><p>••</p><p>He woke up at 6 in the morning, far too early for a Saturday. His laptop was at the other end of the bed, tabs blaring stories of hatred. He was currently open to a tab labelled "Persecution Of Homosexuals In Nazi Germany."<br/>Curiously, he typed in "gay discrimination," wondering if the past held more horrors. <br/>"Concentration Camps For Gay Russians Set Up By Putin"<br/>"Boy, 15, Commits Suicide Over Homophobic Bullying"<br/>"Gay rights: a World of Inequality"<br/>"Why Are Those Men Kissing? Explaining Homosexuality From A Christian Viewpoint”<br/>“Are Bisexuals Part Of The Queer Community?"<br/>That's stupid, thought Draco, seeing as the acronym is LGBT...<br/>"Transgender Girl Killed For Her Identity"<br/>"Queer Identities You Probably Haven't Heard Of"<br/>Although he wanted to read them all, to learn everything he could all at once, he clicked on that one.<br/>Queer Identities You Probably Haven't Heard Of<br/>By Mae Aarnolde<br/>You've probably heard of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, and you probably know what they mean.<br/>But have you heard of non-binary, pansexual, agender, asexual, gender-fluid, gender-flux, demisexual, bigender, or aromantic? In this article, I will decode these terms and more.<br/>Non-binary: A gender identity that is not strictly, completely, and always either male or female.<br/>Agender: A lack of gender, neither male nor female<br/>Genderfluid: A gender identity that changes fluidly<br/>Genderflux: a gender identity that fluctuates; eg, one could be a genderflux girl and go between agender, female, and anything in between.<br/>Bigender: having two genders, most commonly male and female<br/>Demigender: a gender that is only partially; eg, a demiboy is part boy<br/>Genderfire: like genderfluid, but the gender behaves more as a fire than a fluid<br/>Jurega: like female, but on a different plane of existence<br/>Proxvir: like male, but on a different plane of existence<br/>Pansexual: attracted to people of any gender equally (Many people will ask, how is this different from bisexuality? Bisexuality is the attraction to two. Two groups of people: people of your gender, and people of other genders. Pansexuality is attraction regardless of gender)<br/>Asexual: not feeling sexual attraction. Asexual people can still have sex or be aroused, but they cannot feel attraction to others.<br/>Demisexual: can only feel sexual attraction to people after becoming close to them; a subset of asexual.<br/>Autochorrisexual: cannot feel attraction without a disconnect; eg, can imagine sex with someone only if it's not them the person is having sex with.<br/>Aromantic: Not feeling romantic attraction.<br/>Demiromantic: only feeling romantic attraction after getting to know someone<br/>If you have any questions or comments, please comment below!!<br/>by Mae A</p><p>Draco reflected on this. He'd never heard of most of those terms before. <br/>He scrolled down to where the comment box was.</p><p>* means required<br/>Name:* Mira<br/>Email or twitter:* miraisontwitter<br/>Website:<br/>Comment:* hi, i was just wondering if you could explain more about the gender identities? I don't understand how you could be more than one gender at a time, sorry. Thank you for your article, i learned a lot from it :)</p><p>••</p><p>Some time later, he found himself on a website for transgender boys and men.<br/>FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW<br/>Need a chest binder?<br/>Passing tips from real trans men<br/>How do I know if I'm trans?<br/>How to naturally masculinise your body<br/>Voice deepening exercises<br/>Need a new name? Check here<br/>Share your stories!<br/>Read real transmasculine stories here</p><p>He clicked on "how do I know if I'm trans?"<br/>It turned out to be a survey. When he checked off a statement, it was bolded.</p><p>• I was born female but I identify as male.<br/> • I am unhappy with my breasts.<br/>Isn't everyone? mused Draco.<br/> • Femininity is stifling.<br/> • I lean towards typical 'boyish' activities (eg: weightlifting, boxing)<br/> • I am nonbinary<br/> • I do not feel particularly connected to womanhood<br/> • I do not feel connected to manhood or womanhood<br/>Because I'm still a kid, but still, it applies. <br/> •  I am unhappy with my body<br/> • I would like having a deeper voice<br/> • I am taking this survey right now<br/>He debated being a smartass but ultimately decided to leave it bolded.<br/> • As a child, I enjoyed superheroes more than princesses<br/> • I would not be unhappy if someone referred to me as "sir"<br/> • Going through puberty felt like a betrayal from my body<br/>You try getting boobs at age 8.<br/> •  I have contemplated suicide<br/> • I don't like being referred to as "she”<br/> • I avoid using public restrooms<br/> • I feel uncomfortable in groups of girls<br/> • I have friends who are boys<br/> • It feels "wrong" when I get my period<br/> • I wish I were more muscular<br/> • I am a boy<br/> • I don't feel girly<br/> • My gender changes<br/> • Gender roles are dumb<br/> • I'd rather be a brother than a sister<br/> • I'd rather be a dad than a mom</p><p>Get results</p><p>He clicked.</p><p>24 of 32 of your answers suggest that you could fall on the transgender spectrum. This test cannot tell you your gender; it can only suggest what you look into.</p><p>Draco contemplated this. Sure, he'd never been particularly "girly."<br/>But that didn't mean he was a boy.<br/>Right?<br/>He closed out of the tab and found himself back on the Google Doc he'd been typing up about the Holocaust and how it compared to the witch burning trials of the 14th century. He deleted his first paragraph and wrote, "The Holocaust and the Salem witch burning trials had much in common, but the Holocaust was significantly worse."<br/>Because no matter how much his world was shaking, homework would always be there to haunt him.</p>
