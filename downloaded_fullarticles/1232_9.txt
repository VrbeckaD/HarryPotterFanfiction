          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Why do you even bother with him?" Cedric asked abruptly "Your effort isn't paying off."</p>
<p>"It paid off well enough with you." Lily pointed out </p>
<p>"I was always good at heart. My father neglected me due to work, is all." Cedric responded in kind "He isn't."</p>
<p>He turned to look at the subject of their discussion. Barty Crouch Junior was standing on all fours, pretending to be a dog.</p>
<p>"His father neglected him due to work too." Lily insisted </p>
<p>"He is insane." Cedric reiterated "He helped the man who killed you, for God's sake. Why are you nice to him?"</p>
<p>"If I am nice to Voldemort's mother, I could be nice to him as well." Lily smiled "I will prove to everyone that all people need is love!"</p>
<p>Cedric just shook his head and walked out of the room. He didn't fancy spending time with an insane murderer who contributed to his death at Wormtail's hands.</p></div>
