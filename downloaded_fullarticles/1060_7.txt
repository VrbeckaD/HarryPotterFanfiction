    <p>The train stopped and harry stod up so he could get the truck down. He was ready, having changed clothes to muggle clothes a few minutes before the train reached its final destination, England.<br/>
Harry opened the door and walked off the train. There were many people all around making it hard to know where to go. At one place was Ron and the Weasleys hugging or Molly Weasley hugging Ron as he got more red for the longer the hug lasted. Harry couldn't stop the feeling of a deep longing as he looked at them. Harry chose instead to concentrate to find the portal to the platform. He looked around for the portal to platform number Nine and three-quarters where his uncle was supposed to be.<br/>
After finding the platform harry used the next ten minutes to push around people to get to the portal to the platform, as harry reached the platform Harry couldn't stop the whimper from coming out. His relatives were going to be mad that he used so much time instead of being ready.<br/>
He looked up and walked through the portal.</p>
