    <p><b>Severus Snape:</b><br/>
If Severus had ever held proper respects for Albus Dumbledore, which he had once upon a time, it had probably been lost with the array of bad decisions the man had been guilty of, during Severus’s time at Hogwarts. He wanted to believe he trusted the man with his life, but at this point, they were both equally using one another to achieve their goals, well aware of it. Dumbledore rarely made fatal mistakes, luckily, but his sentiment was clearly getting the better of the old man, more often than not.<br/>
<br/>
Hiring Remus Lupin had been absolute lunacy. Plainly put, it was a terrible idea, and Dumbledore must very well have realised the fact that it was a bad idea. No matter the fact that having a werewolf back at the school could be dangerous, it hadn’t been a problem back in their own school days, not too much of a problem, and it wasn’t the main reason Severus was bothered.<br/>
<br/>
Lupin was a friend of the Potters, a close friend, someone who knew far too much, and who knew Severus far too personally; he needed to remain a safe distance from the new teacher, and old… research specimen. Even worse yet when the lunatic and traitor Sirius Black and been on the loose. Simply because Dumbledore had vaguely explained that Black wasn’t responsible for the murders, not giving any further detail, after the recent incidents, didn’t mean he would hold Black in any higher regard than before.<br/>
<br/>
While Severus well understood why Dumbledore would want to help the werewolf, and make certain he had an occupation, the Potions Professor would have expected the other to understand the urgency of their goals, and that they couldn’t be compromised in such manners. He would have expected the other to, but it seemed to have been in vain. </p><p>Very much on purpose had the Potions Professor maintained high walls around himself and everyone else, and had remained very unpleasant, even worse than previous years, towards the students. He made certain to avoid Lupin at all costs. It hadn’t helped in the end, he had been put in a position where he had to outright defend Harry Potter and his friends from the beast, which was very problematic and difficult to explain for the man who was supposed to want the child dead; it had turned into quite the mess.<br/>
<br/>
The werewolf in his natural human shape was… a lot more intimidating than he used to be. He had not seen the other since school years, and hadn’t expected the man to be so… forward, witty and nosy. The way he talked back to Severus on occasion during the year had truly been inconvenient and annoying. Growing up, they both had changed quite a bit, but probably for different reasons entirely. Severus hadn’t quite forgiven the other, because there was nothing to forgive. Not only had it been reasonable, back in his school days, to spend time with the Death Eaters out of necessity, for his own safety, but it had paved the way for the intricate plan that was currently in motion. He regretted nothing of it, and to this very day, simply found that Lupin had been acting like a child back then, and they had drifted apart due to the other’s lack of understanding of his friends and surroundings. It had probably been fated to happen, sooner or later. </p><p>Still, Lupin had the audacity to call them… lovers, to act as if there had been something more than two desperate and lonely teenagers who believed they would never once in life experience intimacy unless they took the chance that had been presented to them. All those feelings akin to, all the Great Wizards forbid, love, was something Severus had ripped out of his own being and buried somewhere far off in his mind where he shouldn’t think of it. Meeting the grown up werewolf had only complicated matters a lot, forced some… sentiment to resurface. Of course, he had given it thought, when Lupin first returned to Hogwarts; he had been curious about what sort of life the werewolf had led, who he had become. Yet, there was no time for being nosy, and he couldn’t possibly hope for Lupin to understand what he was trying to achieve, and what means of sacrifice was necessary for the end goal; he had never understood in the past, there was no reason to expect he would after all these years.</p><p>He didn’t know exactly why he had given the potion bottles to the man, in person; perhaps curiosity had gotten the better of him, in the end. He very much regretted said decision as he left. He… wasn’t planning on seeing the other before he left, it was simply something he had said in the spur of the moment, once he gave it an actual thought, it was probably a disastrous idea. If he tried hard, he might be able to avoid Lupin altogether the last four days of the man’s stay at the school, and then, things would finally revert back to normal… or so he had thought. </p><p>A familiar voice called to him, and startled him enough to flinch just the tiniest bit. He spun around to see Lupin… and immediately looked as displeased as he felt. It wasn’t that per say that he didn’t want to talk to the man, at all, it was the fact that he couldn’t quite afford to.</p><p>
  <em> “Sorry to… bother you, but I realized that I have to talk to you.” </em>
</p><p>Wonderful… that was fairly predictable. He would have hoped to get around the matter without an outright refusal. </p><p>“...What could be so important that it couldn’t wait until tomorrow?” He commented, trying well to show just how displeased he was with the development. Lupin had always been quite like a persistent dog, and now when he was so much more… forward, Severus did not expect to be able to fend off the man all too easily. </p><p>As predicted, Lupin hurried down to his side, like a dog returning to its Master… what a bizarre thought; it was a thought he immediately suppressed. </p><p>The other explained how Severus would likely keep on avoiding him, and it was quite unsettling to know that the other man could read him so very well to that very day. This was all turning into quite the headache.<br/>
<br/>
“...You won’t accept a no, will you?” </p><p>
  <em> “I won’t.” </em>
</p><p>Very much involuntarily, Severus felt a hint of something which he hadn’t felt in years at end. He… couldn’t place a name on it, but it originated from the intensity of the other’s gaze, how very important it seemed to be for them to speak to one another, how it mattered, how he mattered to Lupin.<br/>
<br/>
“Come with me, then,” he finally replied, realising that there was no room to argue with the werewolf, not with his seemingly newfound boost of confidence. If anything, he needed to make absolutely certain that no one would be listening in to their conversation. He lead the other back to his own living quarters in the castle, simply because he knew it was the one place where he could make absolutely certain that no one, absolutely no one, would be able to listen in or spy on them; he had made sure of that. If worked very well in both prospects because it meant that the… others expected him to be hiding things from Dumbledore and the other teachers. </p><p>He closed the door behind them on his own, watching the werewolf expectantly, not saying a word. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b>Remus Lupin:</b><br/>
As the Potions Professor closed the door behind them, Remus was hit with uncertainty. Had he made a mistake in following the man? He didn’t think he had, but the atmosphere in the room was… tense. The werewolf’s nose was hit with strange scents, sour, sweet, something smelled ever so slightly rancid. The room clearly worked as a sort of potions lab and office, with a separate bedroom somewhere, most likely behind the door to the right of Remus. After all, nobody made potions in their bedroom, that was just silly to think. Remus tried his hardest to keep his nose under control, but the scents finally became so much that he sneezed. He took a few deep breaths, and tried to breathe through his mouth and not his nose. If Snape wanted to place the werewolf in a position where he couldn’t smell the other man’s mood, he had picked the perfect place for those scents to be drowned out.</p><p>Remus didn’t quite like to have his sense of smell taken away from him like this, but he couldn’t exactly complain about Snape’s home smelling like, well, like a Potion Professor’s room was likely to smell. They were in the dungeons, so there were no windows in the office, something that Snape had most likely taken into consideration, since he had a lot of sensitive materials and ingredients spread out on shelves in the room. The room itself wasn’t necessarily uncomfortable or unwelcoming, but the number of eyes floating in jars around the room was slightly jarring. </p><p>Remus realised that Snape hadn’t moved, and thus, he turned back to him. The werewolf further realised that the man’s posture was a lot better than when they had been children, the man was clearly not trying to hide behind his hair anymore, and it somehow made the werewolf rather happy. Not only because he liked seeing the man’s face, no, that would be silly. It just felt… pleasant, to know that Snape no longer felt the need to hide himself from the world. </p><p>He hesitated slightly, before opting to grab the toad by the middle, and get straight to the most painful part. “I heard from the children… that you jumped in front of them to… well, protect them from me.” He avoided to look straight at the other man’s eyes, curling together slightly as he spoke. “I don’t… remember anything, and I feel like I should scold you for being so… brave. Obviously, I won’t, uh… but… I need to ask, are you alright? I, uh… hit you with my claws, right? Please, I...” He had not expected himself to feel that desperately frightened again, it felt as if he was back to being a child, back to being scared of having poisoned another human with his beastly venom. “I won’t feel certain until you tell me yourself: you weren’t infected, right? And you will be okay, they’ve made certain that you are patched up again, correct?” Remus was ramling, and he knew it, but he had never been too good with words, not when it really mattered, which was why he found it more important to try and get his mind spoken for, rather than hesitate and leave things unsaid. He did not want to continuously make the mistake of leaving things unsaid when it came to actually speaking with Snape.</p>
