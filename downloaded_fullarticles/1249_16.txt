          <div class="userstuff"><p>Sirius sat on his bed and watched the three other boys sitting on theirs—the short blond boy who was staring at his hands, the thin brown-haired boy who was pretending (not at all plausibly) to read, and the messy-haired boy who met his gaze and grinned.</p>
<p>“How’s it feel not to be in Slytherin, then?” Potter’s tone was conversational, as if his words hadn’t just sent hundreds of years of Black family tradition spinning into dust.</p>

<p>But the thing was, Potter had turned out to be all right. In fact, he was bloody <i>brilliant</i>. The two of them were going to pull off more and better pranks than Hogwarts had ever seen.</p>
<p>And his being in Gryffindor would wind Mother up more spectacularly than anything Sirius had ever even <i>dreamed</i> of coming up with.</p>
