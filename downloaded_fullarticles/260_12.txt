    <p align="JUSTIFY">The night of September first Harry laid in the bed that would be his for the next six years, silently reflecting about the reactions of the students and teachers alike back at the Welcoming Feast. He wasn't as dim as to not have taken note of the sudden moment of stillness that the Great Hall as a whole regaled him after his Sorting. Even Malfoy, whom had shared a compartment with him in the train and the boat had been surprised.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">But not Ro; he had clapped hard in the middle of the silence, and thanks to him the Slytherins had overcome their perplexity in time to clap for him before he reached the green table. Malfoy had offered him a place besides him and proceeded to introduce him discreetly to the other first years as the Sorting kept taking place.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The other moment in which a Sorting appalled the students in a fashion similar to his was once Ro, after a few instants, was pronounced as another Slytherin. Loyally, Harry clapped strongly for him, Malfoy not too far behind him, and soon the other firsties and students followed their example, observing curiously the red-head and the student left, in case Zabini were to surprise them and be Sorted into Hufflepuff or something.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">During the travel to the school Ro had spoken about Voldemort, mentioning him and spouting several facts about the War he had waged against Wizarding Britain, commenting about the origins of his uprising and criticising his modus operandi, but he had done so briefly, taking care not to offend Malfoy and not really getting into the details that Harry could consider interesting to understand better the reasons that compounded his life and the way he was living it.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The way Ro told things gave them far more deepness than only knowing that his parents were heroes and You-Know-Who killed them; it gave his parents reasons to stand up against Voldemort, choosing to fight instead of getting out of Great Britain, gave him something real about the values they defended and would have wanted to teach him had they raised him.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">In front of that, Malfoy became a bit of a prat, wanting to defend his father, though it wasn't easy: either he was one of the bad guys or a weak man for falling under the Imperius. However Ro wasted no time defusing the situation, adequately stroking his ego and taking his mind out of the matter, Harry has observed. It was almost as great as magic, in his opinion, the way he had calmed down the posh guy so that an argument wouldn't break. Not even his teachers back at the school had been that good at stopping children from throwing out their tantrums.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Harry was of the opinion that Ro could be trusted, and the next month proved so to him.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">From the first days Harry had realized that Ro went to pains in order to pretend that Malfoy was the one coming up with the ideas, both in front of the other students and when were only the three of them. He also noticed that Malfoy was infinitely more posh whenever in public, only relaxing a bit when not in the view of their other classmates. The blonde guy also was the more socially invested of their group: Ro kept to himself, studying in the Library or exploring on his own, although the red-head always invited him along, while Malfoy -he insisted on being called that way in front of their classmates- met from time to time with Zabini and Nott, sometimes with Parkinson sliding besides him and Crabbe and Goyle following him as if they were his bodyguards.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">In those times that Harry was alone with Ro he could ask him anything since the red-head would do his best to explain things to him, be it the theory of Transfiguration or little facts about the Wizarding World that were natural for him but not so for Harry, of the nuances of the History of their country, since he managed to stay awake during Binn's class. Ro told him about yearbooks, where he found photographs of his parents when they attended Hogwarts, and researched together with him about the Potters and their achievements with potions.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Ro was like the older brother he had, way in the past, wished Dudley were: steady, calm, dependable. Always there to help him with a smile and help him feeling comfortable within his own skin when he felt like an outcast at Hogwarts, which was a lot since many students and teachers looked at him weirdly, not only for being the Boy-Who-Lived but also part of Slytherin.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">And Ro had even introduced him to his older brothers; the twins were a real blast to be with, always ready to spread mischief and ready to include them both in their pranks, able to boast now of being able to reach the four Common Rooms. Percy was a bit like Ro, though it'd be more correct to say Ro emulated him: both were calm, liked to read and made Harry feel like what he had to tell was important without making feel dumb for not understanding their customs.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Regarding the other boys in their dorm, Harry was more cautious. Crabbe and Goyle were alright even when they spoke very little; Nott was a bit shy but agreeable* enough, despite preferring to be on its own with his books, and Zabini was the most outspoken of them all minus Malfoy, easily chatting up with students of the other Houses while waiting for the teacher. The girls were kind enough, but tended to go in groups and didn-t relate with the boys unless called by them, but for Bulstrode. She also spent most of her time alone, but looking at her Harry thought that it was because the other girls avoided her a little.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">A part of him could understand it, he would be scared of any person as tall and strong-looking as her, especially with the no-nonsense expression she had on most of the time, giving her an intimidating aura. However, he knew well enough how it felt to be judged by other people who didn't even try to get to know you a bit, and so he always made sure to smile up at her, nodding to her if their eyes were to meet and inviting her to study with him and Ro.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">The first times she had been surprised, but once the invitations kept coming despite her negatives she started to feel comfortable enough to accept them. That had what constituted the first 'big' argument between Malfoy and Harry and Ro, who went to meet them at the Library one day and found them joking with the girl. Had he not been raised the way his father wanted, trying to quash that Gryffindor rashness he still felt very intensely within, he would have come down on them at the Library itself.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Instead he stormed out of there, feeling replaced even if he still didn't know how to name that feeling. He wasn't rationalizing anything at the moment, just drowning into that known sensation of abandonment that he had felt any time his parents had chosen a Ministry function or their social engagements over playing with him. He had believed that Potter and Weasley wouldn't do something like that to him, even when at the end of the day those two were a unit that simply happened to spend time with him. And he had known that, he was able to see at a primal level how Potter preferred the Weasley's company to his unless the three of them were on their own.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">That evening he never met the other two boys at the Library, didn't even look at them when it was the time for dinner and instead brooded on his own, steaming in his jealousy by the time he went to bed.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">It was a good thing that Ro was observant and mature enough to give him space for a few hours before attempting to talk to him, surrounding herself with a silencing spell before entering into the barrier formed by the closed curtains around the blonde's bed. The surprise of feeling his bed give into the weight of the red-head, whom he was giving the back, was enough to keep Draco out of words while Ro looked at him seriously, asking him if he was alright and if something had happened or if he felt like something he had done had insulted him.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">That had been the first time anyone at all had sat down with him to ask him if he was okay, and if not, why, trying to make him feel better, giving him all of their attention and placing importance over his feelings. It was a heady feeling for the blonde, to feel he could matter so much to someone else, worth to lose time of sleep over him, to fix things up just because and not because of the influence his father could have or have not.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Draco walked off that day convinced that Weasley -<em> Ro </em>- would always be at his back not because of his family, but because of himself. He walked off with a new sense of importance he had never experimented before, always used to his parents being the ones who were the ones deserving of the respect, the time. He wouldn't know it for a lot of time, but from then on, within himself, would always exist the belief that he himself could be more than any other Malfoy before him, that his achievements would serve much more than the purpose of making his family proud, but to build himself up. Because Ro had say so himself, had believed him to be able to be more than his parents' beliefs, to be his own person regardless of whether his father thought that half-breeds like Bulstrode were undeserving of attending Hogwarts or not. Had spoken up passionately about his worth, how nobody could really replace him, how he could instead try to accept that Ro was able to be his friend and Bulstrode's too without forgetting about him.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">And also admitted that he didn't think Malfoy senior would be happy to know about the friendship they shared, so he had tried to keep it discreet so as not to cause him problems.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">"You won't leave me behind?" questioned the blonde boy suspiciously. "Even if we have to keep a low profile and you end up spending more time with Bulstrode? And even if you will still be my friend first, what about Potter? He doesn't like me as much as you, and prefers to be with you intead of with me" he commented under his breath before pouting just a bit. "Well, that's not your fault" Ro had shrugged. "It's just that many of the Slytherins you talk to still look at him weirdly and he doesn't feel comfortable. I'm sure that if you were to spend time only with Harry he would accept in a second".</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">"Really?" Draco smiled brilliantly, feeling much better than before.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Soon enough Ro left him to go sleep and Draco closed his eyes, calm and reassured.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">It was around the beginning of October that Harry and Ro made a new friend. They had already met Hermione Granger back at the Hogwarts Express, but since the Sorting they hadn't talked much to each other, only sometimes crossing eyes in the Library and nodding respectfully. Plus, the muggleborn had wanted to try to be friends with her Housemates first, though at the time the only one to spend time regularly with her was Neville Longbottom, trying to keep up with her.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">In the end it had been thanks to the witch, who saw the closed off expression of Ro after reading a letter in the Library, and telling herself to be brave she went to the red-head boy in order to ask how he was.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Ro had smiled brittlely at her, and the brunette knew that whatever he had read had saddened him, but he still was very gentle and accepted her in the group study he had formed with Harry Potter and the Bulstrode girl. Soon the group accepted Neville too, and from time to time, once every thousand years, Malfoy also studied together with them.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">One of the many good things about being friends with Ro were his older brothers, who tended to visit him and by proxy them and then teaching them all cool spells or shortcuts. Hermione herself wasn't very comfortable with them, mostly because they reminded her of some of her bullies, but they were still miles better than those, wanting everyone to have fun instead of being simply malicious.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Plus, sometimes they did things that were really interesting! They liked to experiment with substances, looking for ways to create their own pranks, spells and concoctions and that had a part of research that was simply magnificent, since it could help her understand better the way things worked. Even if she wouldn't need it, but it served her to have a better base.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Also, she had felt better when she and Neville were flanked by the twins that Halloween, going back to the dorms after knowing about the troll in the dungeons. Although that put into perspective the way both the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs, whose Common Rooms were down at the dungeons, had been sent there, without even a teacher to guard them.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">There could be said many things about the Weasley siblings, but nobody doubted the loyalty they felt for each other. Many a story had been shared back at the Gryffindor Common Room about the two youngest siblings, and that fact hadn't changed once the ever-infamous Ro was sorted into the Snakes' Pit. He was spoken about, his involvement in the twins' pranks lauded by the older siblings as a new wave of funny jokes affected students from all Houses, changing hair's colours and having portraits all over the school spouting muggle songs and plays.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">A few nights a month the siblings minus Percy met to hash out things or explore, the older ones teaching the youngest ways to get out of the school or secret nooks to give himself places to spend time on his own. And, ever curious and fearless, the three of them had gone on their merry way to investigate that corridor the Headmaster had advised against, wanting to discover the supposed dangers present at the school.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Ro herself could more or less remember that it had something to do with a special rock and a few trials, and didn't know necessary it was for Harry to complete it, but it would probably be the better option for him to measure his forces in a controlled medium before the war against Voldemort came to pass. She wanted to do everything in her hand to prevent such situation, but she was worrywart enough to operate under the assumption that maybe everything could still occur in the same way she barely remembered it despite her efforts to prevent it. That was the thing about knowing His Dark Bastard still lived: in spite of her best efforts to enjoy her life and make good memories with those around her she still was paranoid regarding him and the Death Eaters.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">That meant that her year mates and herself should be prepared for war, the sooner the better. She still didn't know how to accomplish such a thing, but letting Harry know the murdered of his parents was still alive would proportionate a good excuse for them to apply themselves with protective spells at the very least.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">It had been with that mindset that Ro informed Harry, Hermione and Draco about the cerberus and the trapdoor she and her siblings had encountered, getting them all aboard the investigation.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Accompanied by that project, the pranks, the sweet letters from Ginny and her Great-Aunt Muriel and also trying to teach Harry the fine nuances of the pureblood crowd time passed slowly until they reached Christmas. Anyone else but Harry and the Weasleys went to spend the holidays with their families, and Harry was surprised by the presents he received. And also by that singular package which contained an Invisibility Cloak, and he happily used it to explore the old castle in the night.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">One night he found the most wonderful mirror ever, one that showed him the sight of his parents for the first time ever, and it was actually the best thing to happen to him that Christmas. Excited he told Ro about it, inviting him to accompany him, wanting to share that with his first friend. However he couldn't have expected the reaction Ro had to the mirror, crying over it , trembling while hugging himself.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Worried, Harry did the only thing he knew: taking a page out of aunt Petunia's book he wrapped his arms around his friend, as strongly as he could once Ro also hugged him in turn, grabbing his clothes as if they were his only salvation.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">After that, Harry went only once more to the mirror, encountering the Headmaster there for the first time. The old wizard was polite and kind enough, but Harry couldn't feel relaxed in his presence. There was something about him, in the way he looked at him and spoke about his classmates, that made him feel ill at ease, just a bit. Enough for him to be suspicious.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Being six heads thinking together made it all the easier to connect the dots regarding the Philosopher's Stone, especially after Hagrid invited Harry and his friends in order to introduce them to Norbert; while they weren't apprehended during his smuggling out of Hogwarts and therefore didn't spend a detention over the Forbidden Forest, their brains were ingenious enough to guess the answer.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">However in the end it was only the original group that went there to protect the stone, being the twins caught red-handed by Snape himself. Ro herself was the one to deny Draco the chance to go together with them. "If it's really You-Know-Who, what do you think he'll do to your family for letting you harm him? Even if your father was never a real follower, he still has his Mark. He can be hurt, and hunted down by following that connection, and you don't want that, Draco Malfoy!" she alleged passionately. He would instead go to warn Snape in case they were to be there for more than fifteen minutes.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">After that their history kept being altered, not the least of it because of Harry himself, whom never asked Dumbledore if he could spend the summer at Hogwarts. He couldn't yet spend it back at his friends', what with Ro having lots of siblings, Malfoy's father a stuck-up pureblood and Hermione an only daughter. Plus, Neville's grandmother sounded like the scary sort. However, he didn't spend the whole summer at the Dursleys.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Along that first year the Slytherin boys had reached some kind of understanding between themselves. Crabbe and Goyle followed Malfoy and his orders, as their families had instilled into them, and wouldn't rat him out. Zabini was neutral, and even if he wasn't, he didn't care for the stiffness of proper purebloods. Though he had not explained himself, Nott had good reasons to despise his father and everything he stood up for, including the Dark Lord.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Harry's and Ro's soft way to include them, to accept them with their quirks went a long way to endear them to the young Heirs, who were in the end the ones who thought of the best way to keep in contact with Potter: travelling by elf, which Nott had done a great deal of times to be out of his father's reach.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">All in all, Harry thought that summer pretty great. True, Ro and Hermione were too far to be able to visit him comfortably, but they called him, and by some strange design, Ro had managed to be liked enough by aunt Petunia so that she stopped protesting under her breath when the red-head called.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Plus, on his birthday Malfoy, Nott and Zabini visited him along with an strange creature he had never seen before, wrinkled and smaller than him, called Dobby. The three boys and the house-elf had appeared within Harry's room, and taking advantage of the fact that the Dursleys weren't at home at the moment they got out the normal way. Once Nott looked at the house the surprise wrote itself on his face. "I must admit, Potter, you have one hell of protective wards" said Zabini with admiration. "Protective what?" he asked.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">By the grace of being taught by his mother, Zabini had spotted the bloodwards waved around Privet Drive number four, and he wasn't lying when he said they were impressive. Impressive thanks to the fact that those were the most complicated blood-based wards he'd had ever seen, not because of their strength. It was all there, the bare bones of what could be a gorgeous magical defence if the one tasked to its care were to do his or her work correctly. Curious, Zabini invited Potter to his family's Manor, wanting to test the connection of the young wizard. Harry himself wanted to learn more about it, having been unable to see it.</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p><p align="JUSTIFY">Summer had become even more promising than before.</p>
