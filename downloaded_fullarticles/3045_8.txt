    <p>This idea is taken from Pettigrace’s “I just wanna have fun and (get rowdy) story for The Flash, DC’s Legends of Tomorrow and The Arrow.<br/> <br/>I absolutely adore this series and those that were around for the original Isn’t This Meant to Be Impossible will maybe remember i said i wanted to write this as a side story to that- which i was later convinced not to. But the idea never left my mind so here i go! This is absolutely dedicated to Pettigrace &lt;3 i adore their writing and honestly ever time they update gives me the urge to write too! (hence why i started this like. The moment i finished one of their updates.) for this i'm also going to make Voldemort and Tom separate people.

<p><br/> <br/> <em> Tom Riddle was added to the chat by PuddingCup&lt;3 </em> <em><br/> </em> <em><br/> </em> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> Luna, sweetie, didn’t we talk about adding people to the chat after the Cho incident?<br/> <br/> <b>PuddingCup&lt;3</b> Tom’s not like Cho Harry! He’s the one who always helps me get my books<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> i'm with Harry Lu, i thought we agreed this chat was going to be for us?<br/> <br/> <b>Tom Riddle </b> forgive me if i'm intruding, Miss Lovegood said it might be a nice break from studies here. I can leave if i’m only going to cause issues...?<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> No Tom, it’s fine you can stay. It would have been nice if Luna talked to us about it first though<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> Welcome to the chat Tom, feel free to change your nickname if you want. I'm Hermione :) it's a pleasure to meet you!<br/> <br/> <b>Tom Riddle </b> Thank you my Lady, i assure you the pleasure is all mine. Is there anyone else in this chat?<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> beside Ronald (GameMaster) there’s Draco (Draconious_Black). But Draco is only here during the nights (he’s rather busy). If there’s anyone you want to add feel free to. But we try to keep our numbers down these days, after ‘the purge’ as we call it :)<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> oh! And we don't tolerate discrimination in this chat! So don't go picking any fights. This is a place for a lot of us to chill out. We want to keep it stress free.<br/> <br/> <b>Tom Riddle </b> ‘the purge’?<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> that’s what we call Harry’s banning spree- this chat use to have most of our year from school (and a few others) but a lot of them turned out to be dicks or used this place as a rant space or used it to throw shade at people. It took maybe 6 months for it all to build up to the point where Harry banned nearly <em> everyone </em> . Before that he’d been banning a select few but one girl pushed him over the edge xD<br/> <br/> <b>Tom Riddle </b> He sounds like he was being reasonable at first- what caused the tipping point?<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> His ex spread lies over the chat that Harry cheated on her with Luna (neither of them would even dream of doing such a thing) and Drake (who was equally as unlikely). A lot of the group turned on all three of them (who were never really that popular at school anyway. So a lot of people didn’t really question it). Harry for his part reacted rationally at first. Simply leaving the chat for a few days. Same as Pudding and Drake. But then it spread to the rest of us and Harry kind of... snapped.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> Harry’s a decent bloke and likes to keep a level head. But when he snaps he’s fucking <em> terrifying </em> . Like... you’re standing on a beach and it’s all sunny and nice and then there’s this big shadow and before you know it you’re drowning because Tsunami Harry has hit and you didn’t even get a warning!<br/> <br/> <b>PuddingCup&lt;3</b> Harry once threatened to shove a cactus so far up Blazies arse he’d be snorting spines for days when he kept bothering me :) he made quite the image in front of the college!<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> i remember when he stood up to Snape against Neville- that was beautiful. I normally don't condone that type of things but... well, Snape had it coming really.<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b> he once yelled toe to toe with my father for me.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> wait <em> what?! </em> Why have i never heard of this?!<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b> it was just after we graduated. You remember what was going on then- Potter defended me when Lucius wanted to take me to therapy.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> did Harry win thought?<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b> of course he did, this is Potter we’re talking about.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> true, do any of you remember what he did to Umbitch? <em> Savage </em> . I’m pretty sure she’s still serving time.<br/> <br/> <b>Tom Riddle </b> Umbitch? You don't happen to be talking about the Dolores Umbridge case do you?<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> if you’re all quite done talking about me. I’m not proud of my temper thank you very much. Though yes they are talking about Umbridge. Nasty bitch that she was.<br/> <br/> <b>Tom Riddle</b> were you involved in that case? I don't remember the name Harry Potter anywhere.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_</b> *sigh* yeah i was. Let’s just say when i found out what she was doing to the younger kids i put a end to it. Since no teacher seemed to be interested<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> ‘younger kids’ he says.<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> Umbridge basically tortured Harry (and others). Harry spent 7 months building up solid evidence against her- she didn’t take a chance when the police arrived. But Harry asked that they keep his involvement quiet so that no one would make a fuss. (a constant theme of our school years mind you!!)<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> *starts listing off his fingers* Quirrell- serial killer. Removed by Harry. Lockhart- A class Pervert, removed by Harry. Crouch jnr- another serial killer, removed by Harry. Umbridge- Harry.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> 4/6 teachers were removed from the school thanks to Harry :D not that anyone really knows that. (btw, the last 2 teachers were fairly decent. At least not criminal) This isn’t even mentioning that he made a arse in front of the teachers to keep heat off the other students. I can’t tell you how often Harry ended up with detention!<br/> <br/> <b>Tom Riddle </b> what kind of school did you go to?!<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> it was a good school- very prestigious. Hogwarts. But... well, i don't know how those people were able to teach there. I'm just thankful we had Harry there &gt;..&lt; i looked into their records. Our year was the only one that had issues. Every other teachers were very good (past and present)<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> ‘i looked into their records’. Let me warn you Riddle, don't try and hide anything from Herm, she’ll find it.<br/> <br/> <b>Tom Riddle </b> Good to know.<br/> <br/> <em> Tom Riddle’s nickname was changed to Lord_Of_Riddles </em><br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> oooo. We pair now :D about time someone cashed in on the Lord/Lady pair. Honestly i expected Draco to get there first<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b> as if i’d pair names with you. My jaw still hurts sometimes Granger :/<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b> i assure you :) no one is better at Riddles then I, it is only fitting.<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> you had it coming Draco- ooo, you should wait until Harry’s off work! He’s good at solving Riddles (without google, unlike a certain someone!)<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b> work?<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b> unlike Lovegood, we all have lives- Potter’s a tattoo artist. GM’s a fresh police officer. Lady.T works at the city library and i'm going to take over my father’s company in the next year or two.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> (134958473604.png)<br/> <b><br/>Undesireable_No_1</b> Herm, drop off some coffee on your way to work tomorrow? I'm going to crash. I'm wiped out...<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> sure thing Harry. Goodnight!<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> i can’t believe he finally finished that full-back. Goodwork buddy! Night! (it looks amazing btw)<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b> on that note i need to head off as well. I’ve been putting off paperwork to talk with the new guy... see you (nice work Potter.)<br/> <br/> <b>PuddingCup&lt;3</b> just because i don't have a job yet :&lt; goodnight Harry &lt;3</p>
<hr/><hr/>
<p><b><em>A week later</em></b><br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>do any of you mind if i add my brother to the chat? He’s busy often and likely won’t be around much but it is of my expert opinion that he needs more human contact in his life.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesirable_No_1 </b>sure thing- so long as they’re polite we allow everyone here :)<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>lovely :) i’ll add him as soon as he’s home.<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes</b> oh! Your back online Tom, i didn’t get to ask last night. What are you studying for?<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>I’m working on becoming a lawyer.<br/> <br/> <b>Undersirable_No_1 </b>ooo. Nice, we just about have all we need to commit a perfect crime!<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>oh?<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>well, Harry’s great at keeping and cleaning area’s. Herm’s good for researching things (and people). I'm a cop. Luna knows a scary amount of information about how to hide bodies (and generally get away with murder). Drake is our money in the bank and now we have you, the lawyer ;)<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>basically. Pretty much all we need for the perfect crime.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesirable_No_1 </b>not to mention we have a lot of practice keeping out of public eye. Remember the last year of school...?<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b>i swear i'm never going camping again :/<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>what happened?<br/> <br/> <b>Undesrieable_No_1 </b>Herm, Ron and I got some nasty attention from a mob... don't even ask me how because i have no idea. All i know is they wanted us dead (i think it had something to do with the teachers i got kicked out of Hogwarts but you can’t hold me to that).<br/> <br/> <em>Lord_Of_Riddles added Marvolo Riddle to the chat</em><em><br/> </em><em><br/> </em><b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>anyway, the three of us spent the year moving around Britain and Scotland to avoid the people that were hunting us. We spent a good year doing it until we managed to organize a working trap with some police. It was a bad year all around but we got through it.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>I got shot. <em>Twice</em>.<br/> <br/> <b>Marvolo Riddle </b>that wouldn’t happen to be the case where Bellatrix LeStrange was captured once more, wouldn’t it?<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b>what is with you Riddles and always knowing exactly what case we’re talking about?! Do you guys stalk the police or something? Also Welcome Marvolo<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>since i decided to become a lawyer i’ve been following the biggest cases. For years. Marvolo just so happens to be a sounding board for me so he knows most of them too.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>...something about that name is familiar. Marvolo Riddle... damn this is going to bother me all night.<br/> <br/> <b>Marvolo Riddle </b>i own the Slytherin company- perhaps you recognize my name from that?<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>wait <em>what</em><em><br/> </em><em><br/> </em><b>Undeseriable_No_1 </b>no, i don't really play attention to that... gah, let me think on it. I’ll remember eventually.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1</b> anyway. Yeah that case was the Bellatrix one.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>wait a moment- can we get back to the fact that a <em>billionaire</em> joined our chat?<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b>Ronald, what do you think Draco is?<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>uh... a person who use to be a prick but we’re now friends with for some reason?<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes</b> Ron, Draco is the sole child to one of the wealthiest families in Britain- Harry, is inheritor of the Potter fortune, again one of the wealthiest families in Britain and a third of the Black fortune, again <em>one of the largest fortunes in britain</em>. We have far more than <em>one </em>billionaire in this chat.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesrieable_No_1 </b>that said most of mine gatherest a heap of interest and makes a constant donation loop to various charities. I haven’t used it like... at all, since i brought my shop.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>you know Potter, a lot of things about you suddenly makes sense.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>you mean the extreme tipping i do? The kickstarter and go-fund-me and patreons i bookmarked? The constant trips to the orphanages?<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>i was going to say the fact that your pantry is always stocked but that too i guess.<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b>-_-”<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b>mood.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>mood. Also FYI i use my own money for my food- the money i make from my shop that doesn’t go towards bills.<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b>Ron you really need to start paying attention to things- 12 years of knowing Harry and this is the result<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b>makes you question why Harry and I didn’t hit it off straight away instead of Weasley doesn’t it?<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>Drake, buddy. We didn’t hit it off because you reminded me of my cousin.<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b>...fair, i was a shitty kid. Can we blame it all on my father?<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>yeah sure, he certainly fits the criteria to win ‘shitty person of the year award’<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>OH MY GOD<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b>what??<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>???<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b>O.o<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>I KNOW WHERE I KNOW MARVOLO’S NAME FROM<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>forget your dad Drake, <em>I’m </em>the shittiest person of the year.<br/> <br/> <b>Marvolo Riddle </b>i admit myself curious to how you came to this realization.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>one name- Voldemort. Gods i am a freaking <em>Idiot</em><br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>okay now why is that name- ohhhhh, Marvolo remembered something. He had his holy shit face on<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>Harry, share?<br/> <br/> <b>Undsireable_No_1 </b>when i was younger i use to visit an orphanage- it was the only place i never felt in danger because it was home to my one and only friend at the time. But he disappeared one day and i didn’t hear from him again. I totally forgot about him after i went to Hogwarts and everything happened.<br/> <br/> <b>Marvolo Riddle</b> and that child was me. My father, worthless as he was, came for me one day and never gave me a chance to tell anyone anything. I'm guessing he also told the caretakers to not tell anyone. The less people that knew that the child of a wealthy businessman who was moving up in the world the better. I'm guessing that silence spread to Harry.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>i would get upset that you didn’t remember me either but Harry Potter is a common name so i can’t really get that upset xD<br/> <br/> <b>Marvolo Riddle </b>though i should have guessed from the Bellatrix case. Only you would have that level of bad luck.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>well. You aren’t <em>wrong</em>.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>this is weird... i’ve never seen Marvolo act like this.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>hmm?<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>Tom?? Marvolo??<br/> <br/> <em>Marvolo Riddle’s Nickname was changed to Lord_Voldemort</em><em><br/> </em><em><br/> </em><b>Lord_Voldemort </b>don't mind him Harry.  You mentioned someone called Draco before. That’s a unique name i’ve only heard once before. You wouldn’t happen to be referring to the child of Lucius Malfoy would you?<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>*makes cross symbol and turns three times* we don't say that name here!<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>yes, but we also avoid using his name. It’s kind of like a bad luck charm ^^” he’s kind of a major no-no with this group. Similar to breaking a mirror<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b>he’s the scum of all scum :/<br/> <br/> <b>PuddingCup&lt;3 </b>the worst of the worst!<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>what did the old man do?<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>that Tom, is one thing we don't share. Only Draco can really tell that story.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b>if i have my facts right i have a pretty good idea... I’m guessing the man did not accept young Draco’s life?</p>
<p><b>Draconious_Black </b>In short. </p>
<p><b>Draconious_Black </b> he’s told me a lot about you, even though you refuse to do business with him he finds you highly respectable. It’s a pleasure to meet you.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> likewise, though i have to say. Perhaps once you take over his company we shall do business. But i refused to work with a man like Lucious. It’s a moral thing.<br/> <br/> <b>Underireable_No_1 </b> Voldemort with morals, someone best call an ambulance for madam Coal ;) i think she just had a heart attack<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> oh my, such a tragic loss.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> what are you up to these days Harry? You said something about a shop before?<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> i'm a tattoo artist, nothing as fancy as being a CEO but i like it :P<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> hmm, well you always did like to leave your mark on people.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b> *whispers* what the hell is going on.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> finish your studies for tonight Tom, dinner will be soon.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> wait, why wouldn’t you just tell him that irl? Wasn’t he near you before<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> distance. I moved to my study some time ago and Tom <em> should </em> be in his room going over his class material<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> -.- dang rich people<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> trust me, i'm not the worst rich man out there. Like Harry i don't use most of my fortune. Allowing it to gather interest and donate to various places in a recycling loop.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b> we don't even live anywhere fancy. When father passed we sold his estate and moved to an apartment in london. We have what we need to live and that’s about it.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> hmm &gt;..&gt;<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> Ronald, ease off. The Slytherin company is by far one of the top places to work- they’re the leading power on human rights. Paying their workers high above minimum wage and having some of the best working conditions. If anyone deserves to have a little extra i’d say it’s Mr Riddle. Also employing more than strictly needed yet no worker suffers or is unable to provide even with the shorter shifts.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> you always were one for fairness :)<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> i figured, if i ever encountered you again Harry, you’d get rather annoying about working conditions. If there’s nothing to complain about there’s nothing for you to get on my case about.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> :D so *i'm* the reason the Slytherin Company is so good...?<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> you’re constant lectures have left me permanently traumatized. I can’t so much as twitch towards a bad moral choice before a mental, 5 year old, Harry Potter is lecturing me on the rights of humans.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> i can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or not...<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> he’s not</p>
<p><b>LadyOfTomes </b> he’s not<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b> i assure you he’s being serious<br/> <br/> <b>PuddingCup&lt;3 </b> you really have a way of making people listen to you Harry :)<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> you can be really convincing Harry, and failing that... horribly scary.<br/> <br/> <b>PuddingCup&lt;3 </b>Blaize has completely reformed since you laid into him :3 i hear he’s holding down a stable job now and is extremely polite to the women he comes in contact with</p>
<p><b>Draconious_Black </b> my father is still reluctant to go anywhere near the world ‘therapy’. And still flinches when he uses my old name.<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> but trying to imagine a five year old harry lecturing someone... it's just to cute!<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort <br/><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/845/42760586784_0114c29ffe_m.jpg" alt="Five Year Old Harry" width="174" height="240" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3673051183" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3673051183" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></b> <em><br/> </em> <em><br/> </em> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> :O OMG he’s so cute &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> O.O MARVOLO!<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b> damn... to think there was a time when those glasses were actually cute... i’m impressed.<br/> <br/> <b>Undeisrebale_No_1 &gt;////&lt; </b> <b><br/> </b> <b><br/> </b> <b>PuddingCup&lt;3 </b> that’s adorable Harry &lt;3 to think, fate brought you both together again :3 it's so sweet.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b> how do you even have that...? I don't remember either of us having access to photos<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> there was a week where we had a volunteer caregiver. She took a lot of photos of us all. A few years ago i hunter her down and got that one. Since you were there only as a guest she only had one of you though<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b> because that’s not creepy at all Brother.<br/> <br/> <b>Undeisreable_No_1 </b> i don't remember... :/<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> you probably blocked it out. It wasn’t a pleasant week for you, as far as i remember the first time you saw her you screamed and hid in my room.<br/> <br/> <b>Undersireable_No_1 </b> -.-”<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> i don't blame you, many of the younger children burst into tears on sight. She only managed to get that picture of you because you were distracted, you didn’t even see her.<br/> <br/> <b>Undersireable_No_1 </b> -_-”<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b> her name is Rita Sketta if you’re trying to remember her.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b> *spits out tea*<br/> <br/> <b>Draconious_Black </b> for real...?

I no longer care i refuse i reject this memory and all others. Nope. don't care. I'm done. I'm going to bed. I have to be up early tomorrow to fill out orders. I am sleeping and never thinking of this night again. Goodnight.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b> (inserts picture)<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b> look at the poor confused man. Barely even a few hours and i’ve seen more emotions form him then i have in the past years. Ah this was a good choice, Luna you are a angel &lt;3<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b> Don’t take Harry’s retreat personally Marvolo :) Harry had some... bad, experiences with Miss Sketta during our school years... it really is a small world huh?<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b> (inserts picture)</p>

Honestly why i let Dudley talk me into niece sitting is beyond me.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesirebale_No_1 </b>fine, i fix my answer “it sword of seems like you have a problem with me”. Better?<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>barely -_- i’ve come to expect better from you man, step up your game.<br/> <br/> <b>LadyOfTomes </b>anyone else interested with the Riddle’s replies? I feel like they’d be the most interest to stab now tbh<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b>it certainly would be interesting, for me, not you, i will likely be very painful for you.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>yeah, agreed. Don’t try and stab Volde Herm, he’s payback is 10 fold what he received.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>O.o<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b>a boy named Billy once killed my pet snake and put it in a wrapped box and gave it to Harry as a ‘gift’ from me. I hung his rabbit by the rafters.<br/> <br/> <b>Undersireable_No_1 </b>yeah... you were kinda crazy back then Volde.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b>i blame stress and living conditions.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>but you behave now right...?<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b>i have to, the public watches me too much to misbehave.<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Of_Riddles </b>wait you did WHAT?<br/> <br/> <b>Lord_Voldemort </b>reread it. I'm not repeating it.<br/> <br/> <b>GameMaster </b>that’s kinda heavy... but for real what kind of kid gives another kid a dead snake and says its from his friend? That’s dark man.... Darker than hanging a rabbit. Barely.<br/> <br/> <b>Undesireable_No_1 </b>honestly, it's a mystery how Marvolo even did it. Like, the orphanage had HIGH rafters.
