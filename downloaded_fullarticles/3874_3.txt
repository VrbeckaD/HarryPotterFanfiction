    <p>“So, how was Asgard?”</p><p>“As usual.” The boy replied in a casual tone as he swiftly caught the ball Clint threw in his direction without even looking up from the book he was reading, “Grandma Frigga baked me cakes, and Grandpa Odin was going on and on about golden apples and blah. He had a whole plate of them in his studies, and then he tried to bribe me.” </p><p>Clint made a sound. “That’s a really great offer, you know, you should’ve sneaked one home, and then make it into an apple pie.”</p><p>“I think that’s what Daddy had done.”</p><p>This time Clint actually choked on the coke he was drinking, and the other couple balls he was juggling fell all over him. “What?” He yelled, but when his eyes went searching across Harry’s face he rolled his eyes and leaned back again, “God. Should’ve known you’re making that up.”</p><p>This time, Harry did looked up and smirked at Clint. He slid off the sofa and closed the book, tossing the ball he caught earlier back to Clint: “Done reading. I’m going down to Daddy’s...”</p><p>A piercing alarm rang through the room. “Blood hell.” Clint cursed out loud and grabbed his makeshift bow, just as JARVIS called out “Unauthorized magical presence in tower floor eighty eight,” which happened to be exactly Clint’s floor. Harry looked startled for a second, then his training kicked in and he began signing the illusion spell Loki demonstrated ages ago.</p><p>“Rest of the team?” Clint asked, controlling his breath as he approached the door. The two of them had been lying about in Clint’s playroom, and JARVIS detected the presence—something humanoid looking—to be in the kitchen. Why on earth would any villain target Clint’s kitchen, the archer didn’t really want to waste brain cells thinking.</p><p>“Currently present in the tower: Sir, Captain Rogers and Dr. Banner. Sir’s ETA is 22 seconds, Captain Rogers 48 seconds, Dr. Banner standby.”</p><p>“Good.” Clint said, glancing back. No one seemed to be there. Harry’s illusions were getting really good. Let’s get this over with, whoever disturbed my afternoon. Clint thought and stepped out of his room, bow and arrow ready to fire.</p><p>***</p><p>“This is all a huge mistake—”</p><p>“So you didn’t just break into my tower and tried to kidnap my son.” Tony said coldly. He still hadn’t stepped out of his armour, and his stare was so intense that the strange man winced, “I can sue you just for trespassing, you know.”</p><p>“I understand, Mr. Stark, but—”</p><p>“I’m suggesting that you get out of my tower right now or I can throw you out of a window.”</p><p>“Tony.” Steve sighed. The resident genius is always overprotective when it comes to his son, which may or may not had been a great virtue in cases like this. Tony’s mouth snapped shut and Steve kindly pushed his shoulder, instructing: “Tony, why don’t you go get Harry? Then we’ll sit down and have a normal talk? If Mr. Lupin is really from a secret society—” Steve glanced at the man, feeling a tiny bit uncomfortable making assumptions like that, “—think about Asgard. Think about how they tend to show up via Bifrost with no warning at all.”</p><p>“Dude, just go.” Clint said, arrow still pointing at the man, but his muscles had relaxed to a point indicating he wasn’t in battle mode anymore, “I’ll keep one eye—no, both of my eyes on him. And JARVIS is keeping at least ten cameras on him.”</p><p>At that, a camera whirled in the corner of the room and extended out, drawing a smirk from Tony.</p><p>“Alright.” He lowered his repulsors, “We’ll talk.”</p><p>Half an hour of explaining the school and Harry’s history later, Harry had nodded his consent. “I’ll go, Dad.” He said, then added to Tony’s look of shock, “Don’t think I haven’t noticed—you’re going to send me away from New York either way. Too obvious a target for kidnapping. England can do.”</p><p>Tony furrowed his brows, looking like he really wanted to open his mouth and argue.</p><p>“And I can learn a new type of magic.” Harry continued, eyes glinting, “I think it’ll be fun, Dad, new source of knowledge and experience and everything. Besides, you said I could pick my junior high.” He added as an afterthought, and Tony deflated.</p><p>“Okay, kid, your choice.” He pouted, staring at Lupin sharply, “I myself never had a great experience with boarding schools—I’ll withdraw you anytime you feel uncomfortable.”</p><p>Lupin went on assuring Tony that nothing is going to be that bad at Hogwarts.</p><p>“We still have a lot to talk about.” Steve announced, eyeing Lupin’s sad smile. Just from the short exchange, Steve had noticed the man’s similar personality as Bruce. Calm, mild, benevolent. Probably the best possible kind of person to deal with Tony’s bullshit. “Then, we’ll ready ourselves for some shopping. Right, Harry?”</p><p>***</p><p>A lot more needed to be settled, including things like wand and material for school. There was, apparently, a wizardry school in the US as well, but Harry had insisted on going to Hogwarts. Tony surrendered after ten minutes of debating, and off he went with the school.</p><p>One way or another, it was settled that Harry will be going to London for his necessaries with Lupin, and Tony will be going with them, because, well, reasons. There was no way Tony would miss out a chance to tour the magic world, and Steve thought it might be better for him to go with Lupin instead of with Loki. The two of them together pull the most impossible pranks in the whole freaking universe...</p><p>Tony scared the hell out the poor guy when he asked if Lupin was not human. Turned out he wasn’t, because he was a werewolf. Really, the world must had been bizarre, because aliens and gods and wizards and even werewolves were real—Steve guessed he couldn’t really complain, seeing how he had super soldier serum running in his veins and had survived being frozen for seventy years without aging a speck. Lupin seemed to be extremely concerned about their reaction to his...nature, until Harry assured him that it’s alright. Lupin loosened up significantly, although he remained stiff the whole time he was in the tower.</p><p>Harry had little to prepare for when he could travel back and forth in a matter of seconds. Tony decided to keep on his suit, and from the resignation from Lupin Steve could see the wizard disapprove of drawing attention to them. Then, when Harry performed the illusion trick Loki had taught him, changing Tony’s appearance into a blond man in dress pants, the man almost jumped out of his skin. He gaped so hard that his jaws looked like they would fall off. Harry just grinned and said it was the best method if they don’t want people seeing Tony Stark and Harry Stark-Lokason wandering about in London, and performed the same trick on himself.</p><p>Well...seeing the way Lupin was gazing into nothingness like he had been hit in the head, Steve felt really sympathetic for the man. Normal people aren’t used to having surreal days. He guessed normal werewolves weren’t either.</p><p>And the Stark family was probably the most surreal thing existing in the whole world.</p>
