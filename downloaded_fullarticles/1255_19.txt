late updates (Sorry in advance for that)</p>
<p>This list may be changed based on what I chose to happen in the story and if there is anything you want me to add please do tell me. (even if its something like insects or snakes. If it upsets you it will probably upset others as well and I want to make sure that people are prepared for this stuff.)</p>
<p>Comments/Suggestions:</p>
<p>Please don't be afraid to ask or suggest something. (Unless its mean but its fine if its meant as creative criticisms) I won't judge you. I am a very weird person myself!</p>
<p>There will be a few AN questions and the same goes for that.</p>
<p>Other Shiz:<br/>
This is a fairly dark story but there is fluff!</p>
<p>Anyway that's all!<br/>
Now if you read this, enjoy the crappy story I've written my little Demons!</p>
