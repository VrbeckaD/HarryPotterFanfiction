          <div class="userstuff"><p>              ~ <b>Under the mistletoe</b> ~</p><p> </p><p>I saw her one day, part of some Christmas dream.<br/>She ignited everything, my passing whim.<br/>What was once cold, she lit up on fire<br/>the pores of my skin, chocked on desire.<br/>I want to take her to Diagon alley,<br/>buy her everything and a single red rose,<br/>to use as a bookmark on her favourite prose.<br/>I want to take her at my perfect quidditch lawn<br/>Hear her moan - oh, hear her moan.<br/>But more than anything, just hear her want.<br/>So much longing and so much thought,<br/>an unforgiving, boundless, wretched, deep sea.<br/>Dripping out of me,<br/>dripping out of me.<br/>Dripping.<br/>Out.<br/>Of.<br/>Me.<br/>Like her eyes and her smile, always shining breaking free.<br/>Unless they are - well, unless they are directed at me.<br/>Thought she was the reason, to fight and to be<br/>but she belongs to another, I want her alone and free!<br/>Down by the lake I cursed the ginger, the blue<br/>colours that never suit her, but part of her true.<br/>I approached in terror and exquisite delight<br/>I caged her, held her - tight tight tight!<br/>Shouting at my demons, begging to let her go<br/>though kissing her hard, under the mistletoe.</p><p> </p><p>I saw her again, that time I was awake<br/>she was ethereal and beautiful, my heart began to quake.<br/>And there I stood breathless, no reason at hand.<br/>To love or to hate her, my organs a band.<br/>Playing only for her.<br/>Only for her.<br/>For her.<br/>Her;<br/>and her hand.<br/>Heavy with a green ring, in a posh green land.<br/>A nuptial bed, a child, a treasure<br/>with wit and brains beyond possible measure.<br/>Little moments passing like some fairy lights,<br/>and pudding and tea and Hogsmead delights.<br/>But gone is the honey, gone is the tea.<br/>One thing is left and that thing is just me.<br/>Opening my eyes, nothing seems real<br/>I’m half an inch closer to making a deal;<br/>to sacrifice everything for even a glance<br/>fill my body with ink, for a chance at romance.<br/>Alone I stood again, at Hogwarts Yule ball.<br/>Alone and bereft, ready to fall.<br/>Wishing her in my pocket, a new personal low<br/>under the mistle- under the mistletoe.</p><p> </p><p>I saw her next year and the one after that.<br/>And I swear she ignores me, for tit and for tat!<br/>Still I smile, kiss hands and try to forget<br/>that the world only sees my Death Eater debt.<br/>While she exhumes contentment and some hidden glee,<br/>a huge protruding belly beside the Christmas tree<br/>surrounded and happy by her brave hero clan,<br/>I am crumpling the head of my gingerbread man.<br/>While he touches her, kisses her, curling her toe<br/>I am aching and breaking, under the mistletoe.</p><p> </p><p>I saw her one day, but it was the millionth time sure.<br/>She was alone and lonely, too prone and too pure.<br/>The snake transformed to a lion, so strong is this love!<br/>Approached the wounded, exceptional dove,<br/>wanted to show her everything, apart from the crime.<br/>To explain and forgive her, at last to be mine.<br/>With knife and with strife and with a shout from a crow,<br/>I’m slicing red, under the mistletoe...</p><p> </p><p>                               ~o0o~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
