    <p>The Ministry official ushered Chief Auror Potter and Granger, Head of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, out of her office.  Her eyes landed on Draco sitting in the waiting area and her uncomfortable surprise was evident.  “Oh, Mr. Malfoy.  Are you still here?  I was sure my assistant told me you left.”</p>
<p>Draco did not believe that for a moment; she had forgotten he was out here.  It was hardly an unusual occurrence in his life these days and the smile he pasted on was well-practiced.  “The papers?” he reminded her.</p>
<p>Her eyes glanced back to the other two as she shifted uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“Mz. Waterson, we really must …” Granger waived towards the hall with a quick, impatient gesture.  </p>
<p>The woman’s eyes flicked back and forth between the three people in her front office.  Draco attempted to look hopefully earnest since showing his irritation was the quickest way of getting the door slammed in his face.  He had been sitting in this uncomfortable chair for over an hour in the hopes of having a moment of this woman’s time when Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had come storming in.  He remembered a time when even the hint that he had wanted something caused people to fall all over themselves to accommodate him.  Now, he made due with scraps of attention and was grateful for those when they came.</p>
<p>Something about his expression made an impact.  “Just a moment …” she said, casting Potter and Granger a look before disappearing back inside her office.  </p>
<p>Hermione Granger huffed her impatience while Potter shot Draco a suspicious look.  Draco carefully avoided eye contact.  He could not afford an argument with Potter.</p>
<p>“Malfoy, what are you …” Potter started to demand but the reappearance of Mz. Waterson cut him off as she hurried up to Draco.</p>
<p>“You will have to fill this out yourself.  I really don’t have the time to hand hold you.”</p>
<p>Draco leapt to his feet and grabbed the papers she thrust at him.</p>
<p>“No, no.  It’s fine.  I’m sure I can manage,” Draco assured her, desperately hoping that she had given him the right form and not just whatever was handy to make him go away.  Right form or not there was little chance of him getting any additional help from this department again today.</p>
<p>“Mz. Waterson,” Granger demanded waving at the door again.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m coming,” and without a backward glance, the three of them were gone.  Standing alone in the office, Draco took a moment to look down at the paperwork.  ‘Wizengamot Docket Petition Form’, the paperwork proclaimed in large letters across the top and Draco let out a sigh of profound relief.  </p>
<p>It had taken him three days of wandering around the Ministry to find someone willing to tell him who was currently overseeing the Wizengamot’s agenda.  He had argued his case with two different officials before he had gotten approval just to be allowed to fill out the form.  All of that was before he ever arrived in this tiny little office with its’ horrid chairs and bad lighting.  The daily rags were reporting regularly how it was so much harder in the Ministry since the ‘Exodus’ so Draco knew it was not just him, but that was something he tried hard not to think about.  </p>
<p>When Aurors had ransacked his home and thrown his father in Azkaban, many of the leading political families of Magical Britain, most of them Slytherin and all having a connection with the late Lord Voldemort, had found reasons to take themselves, their families, their money and most especially their magical family heirlooms to the Continent.  </p>
<p>The desertion of these families had caused even more families, many that had claimed no connection with Voldemort at all during the war, to leave, the Longbottoms being chief among them.  The instability of the government caused by abandonment of so many witches and wizards, many who had managed Ministry positions for generations, had impacted every level of society.  Those who had an option to go somewhere else packed up and left.</p>
<p>Draco knew it was not just him navigating the chaos that was the Magical government. His status as a Slytherin, his antagonistic relationship with Harry Potter, and the key roll his family had played in kicking off the mass migration out of Great Britain, made his personal situation position impossible.</p>
<p>Draco clasped the papers to his chest for a moment, allowing this small victory to buoy his spirits.  Maybe not impossible.  He wasn’t done, not by a long way, but he allowed himself a moment to just feel the hope of having made a step forward.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>oOo</p>
</center>“Oh, Master Draco.  You is home, sir.”<p>“Yes Teeley,” Draco agreed as always.  The small house elf always met Draco in the Vestibule leading into the Main Hall.  </p>
<p>“How are the repairs?”</p>
<p>Draco was inured to the sight of the general chaos behind the small elf.  The Aurors had literally cracked open the very stones of the hall in their search for black magic.  Almost a year later the house elves were still trying to reassemble all the pieces.  His mother had wanted the Main Hall to be one of the first rooms repaired.  It was the first room visitors saw on entering the manor and had always been one of the grandest rooms of the house.  Draco had nodded along to his mother’s request as he packed her off to their French villa for an ‘extended’ stay and then promptly ignored the request.  There would be no one coming to see the Main Hall of Malfoy Manor, or any of the other rooms for that matter.  Draco and the remaining house elves had been the only ones to step foot in the place since he had convinced Aunt Andromedia that England was currently no place to place to raise a little boy and sent her and Teddy off to live with his mother.  Until recently, the repair work had focused on the working rooms of the house.</p>
<p>“The main flagstone for the crest is being completely gone, sir.  We keeps trying, but it crumbles and crumbles.  Not much left.”</p>
<p>Draco refused to look at the gaping hole where the Malfoy family crest had once been, created with ancient flagstones by one of the greatest stonemasons of all time.  It had been a treasure in its own right and had been destroyed in minutes.  It hurts, but Draco has become well practiced at letting ancient treasures go.  “Use the regular stone to fill in the hole.  Match the surrounding pattern.”  </p>
<p>“Yes master.”  </p>
<p>Teeley is staring at his chest.  </p>
<p>Draco caught sight of himself in one of the large mirrors lining the wall.  He was clutching at the small pendant hidden beneath his shirt.  It was as unconscious as it was comforting, a gesture Draco found himself doing more often these days.  The sight of himself, standing there, was not a pleasant one.  He looked tired, drawn, gaunt and thin, with shadows under his bloodshot eyes.  He had lost another stone that he could ill afford to lose.  His white-blond hair was in his eyes.  He needed a haircut but he hadn't had time to worry about it.  </p>
<p>After the arrest, Draco had been so careful to keep his hair short to emphasise the difference between himself and his father, but found it had not mattered in the end.  Long hair or short, his physical similarities to his father just re-emphasised the prejudice that his name alone inspired.  The name of Malfoy was no longer one to be proud of.  There was an air of despair that hung like a cloud around him.  He could almost see it in the mirror, the weight of it pushing down on his shoulders.</p>
<p>He dropped his hand and cleared his throat.  As embarrassing as it was to be caught seeking comfort from the necklace by his house elf, he was extremely grateful not to have fallen into that habit in front of Potter.  That could have ended badly.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat again.  “Was there something else you needed?” Draco asked, already moving off towards the stairs.</p>
<p>“No sir,” Teeley said, turning away, and then a moment later, “Oh sir.  There is a notice come for you.  Teeley is putting it in your father’s study.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Teeley,” Draco said, but Teeley was already gone.</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy’s study was on the first floor next to the Master’s chambers and near the main staircase.  Draco’s study was on the same floor but on the opposite side of the house above the library.  For convenience, Draco now used his father’s study for official correspondence and to track legal matters.  It was clean and meticulously organised.  Draco pulled his prize from his satchel and laid it down on the desk.  </p>
<p>The form he had acquired would petition for a spot on the Wizengamot docket to review Lucius Malfoy’s case.  A year after his arrest, the public climate had changed and the bitter feelings towards all who could be associated with Lord Voldemort had softened some in the face of the new political crisis.  There were some who felt that the fate of the Malfoys at the hands of those eager to show their allegiance to Potter and his new regime had been overly harsh.  A more conciliatory approach might have prevented the worst of the migration out of England.  The lawyers Draco had consulted felt that if the case was revisited now they had a reasonable chance at concessions, maybe even a release for time served.</p>
<p>It was this hope, the refusal to abandon his father, that kept Draco in England and wandering the halls of the Ministry like one of the Hogwarts ghosts.  He would not join his mother in France until he had exhausted every avenue.  The thought of his most outrageous plan to free his father had Draco clutching at the small pendant beneath his shirt again.  He quickly pushed the thought away.  As long as there was the smallest hope his father could be freed through other means, that last plan would remain unexplored.</p>
<p>Draco dropped into his father’s chair and pulled out the quill and ink, preparing for several hours of deciphering legalese and filling out paperwork.  His eye caught on the official looking scroll laying on the desk.  Teeley had mentioned something, a notice had she said?  Draco put down the quill and reached for the scroll.  </p>
<p>It was a single page, high quality parchment, and the official seal of Azkaban.  Draco’s heart dropped.  There was only one reason Draco could think of that he would receive an official notice from Azkaban.</p>
<p>He had to open it, he knew he did.  </p>
<p>His fingers remained still.  </p>
<p>For this one moment he still did not know.  Whatever was in that scroll was an unknown, a non-reality.  How long could Draco live in this moment of not knowing?  Would it change anything if he continued not to know?  Could he hide away from the blow that was about to come forever?  Was he strong enough to bear up under it when it fell?</p>
<p>His hands were shaking as he broke the seal and unwrapped the parchment.</p>
<p>“We regret to inform you …” The notice began and Draco knew.</p>
