          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">“I fail to see how this was my fault,” Regulus huffed.</p><p class="p1">He spat out a mouthful of dirty lake water that he was certain was going to give him some sort of terribly embarrassing stomach-related illness when he was least expecting it.</p><p class="p1">“You were the one holding the oars,” she said. “<em>You </em>were the one who declared himself Admiral of the Fleet.”</p><p class="p1">“I didn’t- I was <em>six</em>. I can’t <em>believe </em>Evan told you about that- where is his sense of <em>loyalty</em>? What happened to <em>honour among Slytherins</em>?”</p><p class="p1">His eyes scanned the shore, glad that Evan and the rest weren’t there to witness his rather undignified topple out of the rowing boat but half-wishing they <em>were </em>so he might berate the idiot about telling her all his embarrassing childhood stories.</p><p class="p1">“Don’t be silly,” she said, wading over to him. “Now hold still, there’s something in your hair.”</p><p class="p1">He flinched, flapping his hands about his head. “If it’s that blasted plimpy I swear to Salazar I will drown you, right here.”</p><p class="p1">“You city boys are hopeless! Keep <em>still, </em>Reggie.”</p><p class="p1">She was laughing at him even as she stilled his flailing arms and pulled stringy seaweed from his hair. And he would have been furious at being mocked if it weren’t for the fact that her laugh was quite possibly his most favourite sound in the world.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p></div>
