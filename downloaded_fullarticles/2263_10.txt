    <p>
  <span>What a peculiar sight she made: slouched over on a stool with one hand holding her head aloft and the other white with how tightly it held a phone. The blonde woman, who had paused in the doorway to take this scene in, rounded behind the slouched figure, peering over her shoulder and through her wild mane of black curls. "What're you—are you using that messaging app? The one I asked you to convince Draco </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> to use?" Her voice was already a touch resigned as she asked.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The brunette's death grip loosened as the blonde spoke though she didn't deign to look up. "How am I supposed to make a convincing argument if I hadn't tried it myself?"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"That's..." words failed her as they often did when her eldest sister was involved. "Wait," Narcissa began, "Bella, please don't tell me you did that with dru—"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<b>Her phone buzzed.</b>
  <b><br/></b>





  <span></span><br/>
<span>Not that she could hear it; the music was far too loud for that, and if it </span>
  <em>
    <span>hadn't</span>
  </em>
  <span> been, then the intermittent cheers from the next room over as </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> 'good' happened would have sufficed.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>It was loud; but outside was blisteringly cold, and Hermione hadn't yet met a din so loud that she couldn't think.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>So she sat and she thought and she read and she fumed. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Who the hell did this—</span>
  </em>
  <em></em>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"You don't look like you're having much fun," observed a voice, interrupting her increasingly-impolite thoughts. He may have been half-shouting to be heard, but she recognized his voice anywhere.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She looked up with a smile, his face coming as no surprise. "Harry!" She stood to give him a hug, not having seen him in a while. The music lowered. His hugs were as warm as ever. She leaned back, her hands on his shoulders and questions pouring out before she could meet his eyes, "How have you been? Have you been eating enough?"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He laughed, reassuring her that he had been eating three meals a day and that he's been, "Probably less stressed than you've been, from what I've heard." His green eyes glittered with concern, and her spine bent slightly as if a weight had landed upon her shoulders</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Probably," she agreed quietly, no longer sure if she was glad for the quieter music.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Do you want to talk about it?" her head was already shaking, "Or a drink?" He tried, joking, "Even you can't find this party all that fun sober."</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She laughed, just once. "Why thank you, Mr. Potter, but Ron and I drove here and—"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>They were interrupted by a roar of cheers and a voice crowing, "I did it!" They both recognized that voice, and the slurring in it.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Ah," was all Harry could say, his smile turning a bit chagrined.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Indeed."</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"That doesn't explain why you looked like you wanted to set your phone on fire though," Harry pointed out. Hermione flushed at the reminder of how furious she had been a few minutes ago—some combination of embarrassment and rekindled outrage.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Uh oh," Harry said.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Hermione knew he knew what was going to happen. She also knew he would actually listen to her, so she let it.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Bellatrix was frowning. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Bella, stop pouting."</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She was </span>
  <em>
    <span>frowning</span>
  </em>
  <span> and tapping her nails against the counter with her knee bouncing restlessly—until one of Narcissa's hand rested upon it, her other still holding her morning cup of tea. Bellatrix turned her glare onto her sister.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Narcissa sighed. "Now what has you so upset?"</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"She's not responding," came the answer perhaps too quickly, as one of Cissy's eyebrows arched. Questions danced in blue eyes, and there was a clink as Bella laid her phone down on the counter. "Some random girl taking a course similar to one of Draco's," Bella answered preemptively, waving her hand carelessly. "We were having a..." her hand curled into a fist, "</span><em><span>spirited</span></em><span> discussion. And she just, stopped. Responding!" </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Narcissa said nothing. Bella could feel her eyes on her though, and the damn questions swirling behind them.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She suffered under her sister's scrutiny for a moment before admitting, "I thought she had more fire than that." Narcissa shifted. Even </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bellatrix</span>
  </em>
  <span> was surprised at herself: she didn't think disappointment was a thing she was capable of feeling. Not anymore.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>"Are you going to respond?" Harry asked after her rant had finally wound down. She hesitated. Which she didn't often use to do, but the years had taken its toll on her.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<em>
    <span>Was this a battle worth fighting?</span>
  </em>
  <span> she mused. Harry hesitated to leave her as his phone began to ring: it was Ginny's ringtone.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Hermione smiled and shooed him off. He had looked so eager, and rightfully so. Harry and Ginny clicked in a way few people ever did. Her phone buzzed.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wha—she texted again? </span>
  </em>
  <span>That was unexpected. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Hermione read the message. And it was as equal parts incendiary and insightful as its predecessors had been; but she had already made her point, so why had she messaged </span>
  <em><span>again</span></em><span>.</span><span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Hermione began to type as a thought meandered through her mind, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Was this even a battle?</span>
  </em>
  <em></em>
    <span></span><br/>
