    <p>Harry and Cedric have been meeting up prior to the first task to just. Talk a little. Harry is awkward, like for sure: he’s got a crush on the man’s girlfriend but. Well, his brain short-circuits around Cedric whenever he smiles and he’s so kind and supportive too? And he makes Harry feel normal, like the way he does with Ron except in a less effortless way. Not like he’s forgotten about it from the familiarity after so long, but in a way that means he recognizes Harry as his past, but as his future too. Recognizes that he’s just a lost kid, trying to fit into a legacy that’s the wrong shape for him. </p><p>So Cedric makes him feel, acknowledged in a way that being with Hermione and Ron doesn’t. Makes him feel warm and seen and just. Like a person, which for some reason is different that being seen as Just Harry. </p><p>He knows he’s different for plenty of reasons, knows in the way that he has since he was young and called freak for so many different reasons, that he’s forgotten, the harsh pain fading into a sort of dulled constant stinging, like a bone deep bruise that remember’s pain when it’s poked. It’s all faded to a sort of background noise at this point, constant and pervasive and there. It’s all different reasons why he’ll never fit in properly but can never remember the specifics, the pain of the past blurred like water-color with too little definition and too much shading. </p><p>His feelings are just another thing that makes him abnormal, so Harry does what he does best: swallow them down and pretend they don’t exist. </p><p>Ignoring the problem like he usually would: in this case, Cedric and Cho, wouldn’t work. They seek him out, avoidance is hard and doesn’t work, they just find him anyway, clear and concise in their worry for him and after a while he just, stops trying to distance himself. The company is nice, he defends to himself, he’s lonely in a way that talking with Hermione doesn’t help. It’s not at all because they play Quidditch well or when they smile at him he feels like he has a fever. Or because Cho helps him with his Charms and color codes her notes in a way that he finds endearing; or because Cedric throws his scarf around Harry’s neck one day without a thought in the world when he notices him shivering for having underdressed. How he throws his arm around Harry’s shoulders too, protecting him and making him feel safe in a way he usually doesn’t feel outside of spending time with Ron and Hermione and Hagrid. </p><p>It’s better this way, it’s nice to not be alone, it’s good to have friends, Harry tells himself, feeling so convinced that he almost can’t tell he’s lying to himself.</p>
