    <p>Chapter 1<br/>Severus didn’t understand why he was being called to Dumbledore’s office at this hour of the night. After the day Severus had had, all he wanted to do was sleep. And yet here he was, walking to Albus’s office at 3 in the morning.<br/>He stood in front of the gargoyle that is the secret passageway to Albus’s office and snarled “chocolate frogs.”<br/>The gargoyle moved to reveal the staircase, allowing him the entry. Severus started climbing up as he tried to think of a reason for Dumbledore to send for him at this ungodly hour.<br/>They had begun capturing the death eaters the day before. Perhaps they had come for him, seeking revenge. But no, he was and still is under the protection of Albus. The minister wouldn’t dare mess with the greatest sorcerer of the time. Little did he know that the news he was about to receive were miles away from his expectation. He knocked on the office door trice. The door opened and he walked in.<br/>In the office stood Dumbledore (obviously!) and to his surprise, the minister of magic, who was holding a blanket. Snape settled for ignoring the blanket and said “Minister. Headmaster.” And nodded at them.<br/>The minister nodded back while Dumbledore said “Ah, Severus! Lemon drop?” Severus stared at the candy for a second before declining.<br/>“I suspect there is a reason you have you called me here headmaster.”<br/>“Indeed Severus. You know Harry Potter of course.” Severus sneered in response. “Well, we left him at the doorsteps of his aunt and uncle’s house, his only living relative. But when they found the child in the morning, they decided to ignore him. Clearly wanting nothing to do with him. After hours of crying, Alberga couldn’t take it anymore and took the child.”<br/>Severus raised an eyebrow “What does this have to do with me exactly?”<br/>The minister stood up, walking towards Severus. “Well Snape, this child has no other guardians; the godfather is in Azkaban and Mr. Lupin is not fit to be a parent.”<br/>“So?”<br/>“Well Severus, we’d like you to take-“<br/>Before Dumbledore could finish his sentence, the blanket in the minister’s hands started wiggling and crying. Severus’s eyes widened in realization.<br/>“NO! I REFUSE! I WILL NOT TAKE CARE OF THE POTTER BRAT!”<br/>“Snape, you simply don’t have a choice. We have nowhere else to send the child! Besides this child is your community service, if you want to stay out of Azkaban that is!”<br/>To this, Severus closed his mouth, but he still looked livid. <br/>“Severus, my boy, you may see him as James’s son. But remember, he is also Lily’s... He has her eyes.”<br/>Severus peeked at the squirming child. The boy’s eyes were going all over the room. But when they landed on Severus, he seemed to calm down considerably.<br/>Severus reluctantly took the child and the baby bag.<br/>“Where is it supposed to sleep?”<br/>“I told the House elves to put a crib and a high chair in your chambers... and the supplies in the baby bag should suffice for about two days before you have to go baby shopping.”<br/>Severus opened his mouth to yell in objection when the minister suddenly stopped him. The potter brat had fallen asleep, and Severus didn’t intend on waking him up. He glared at Dumbledore and the minister and with a flourish of his robes, he left the room. </p><p>When he got to his bedroom he saw a small, wooden crib in the corner. He slowly lowered the child into the crib, not wanting to wake it up. Then he sat on his bed and sighed. He grabbed his pajamas, going into the bathroom to change. when he came back, the brat was still sleeping. He walked on his tip toes, being as silent as he could, and lied down in his bed. He fell asleep almost instantly. His last conscious thought being: Why me...?</p>
