  <strong>The Marauders in the closet</strong>
</p><hr/>
<p align="left">It was a quiet sunny afternoon, it had been a week of nothing but warm weather. The common room was empty except for a group of four young men. James Potter was playing around with his wand, denying to do homework because he claimed it was too hot. Remus Lupin had seated himself in the armchair, reading. He had already finished the homework. Peter Pettigrew was trying to understand the assignment given to them by Professor Mcgonagall. And Sirius Black was trying to remember where he had put his favorite leather jacket, he too was denying any attempt to do his homework. </p>
<p>“Padfoot, don’t you have a pretty big closet? Your leather jacket could be in there. Besides, I’m bored.” </p>
<p>“Shut up Prongs. But you’re saying something.” The young man looked at his spiky haired friend, and they both cracked a grin.</p>
<p>“I have hereby decided that the four of us, are going to discover where Padfoot’s favorite leather jacket is located inside his closet!!” As James made the announcement, Remus shut his book and Peter made a small yelp. </p>
<p>“Prongs, if this is you trying to kick Padfoot out of the closet just to make a joke, you’re too late.”</p>
<p>“Moony!!” The young man held his hand over his heart and looked at his friend as if he had been told an insult that hit right and hard.</p>
<p>“Just saying Prongs.” As Remus stood up from his chair and made his way over to Sirius. Wrapping an arm around said man's waist, he gave his friend a smile and enjoyed the kiss he received on the cheek from Sirius. </p>
<p>“We are still going to the closet!!” James leapt up from his position on the floor, dragged Peter with him and made his way past the two lover boys. Sirius gave a small laugh and smiled down at Remus.</p>
<p>“I think you went a little too far with that one Remus.” Remus looked up at his friend.</p>
<p>“No, he deserved that.” He then gave a smile, then a yelp of surprise when Sirius decided to lift him up bridal style. </p>
<p>Well, better not let him wait to get in the closet.” With that, Sirius set off after James. </p>
<p align="center">----</p>
<p>The closet. It didn’t look as big as it actually was, thanks to the magic placed upon it. James was inspecting the closet from every angle, and Sirius was toppling over with laughter.</p>
<p>“Damit Prongs!! Would you stop fooling around!!??” James quickly got to his feet and looked at Sirius with a smirk. </p>
<p>“Sorry Padfoot, I’m done now.” Sirius opened the closet door, and James stormed in. Poor Peter was dragged in with him, as he could neither grap Sirius or Remus as both of them had stepped aside to let him in.</p>
<p>“I lost them.” Remus took a look at Sirius as said man looked after James and Peter.</p>
<p>“Hope he gets lost.” Sirius muttered under his breath. </p>
<p>“No you don’t.” </p>
<p>“True.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go Padfoot, before either of them comes storming back out.” The two went into the closet, hand in hand.</p>
<p align="center">----</p>
<p>A phanting James came running and clung to Sirius.</p>
<p>“I swear on my unborn child Padfoot!! I saw a dementor, and it took Wormtail with it!!”</p>
<p>“James, first of all. You don’t even have a girlfriend. And second of all, I would know if I had put a dementor inside my own damn closet.” As Sirius more or less dragged James with him, he looked for both Peter and Remus. Not long after they had entered the closet, Remus had let go of his hand and disappeared. And Merlin knows where James had left Peter.</p>
<p align="center">----</p>
<p>Not long had past, when Peter emerged from a pile of leather jackets stacked on top of him.</p>
<p>“Hey Wormtail, what happened to you?” Sirius looked at the small man, he looked lost.</p>
<p>“When James said he saw a dementor... I... I fell when he rushed past me.” Well, that explained why James had said he saw the so called dementor take Peter. </p>
<p>“Okay Wormtail, let’s get you out of here.” With both James and Peter hanging on to each of his arms, Sirius lead the way out. As he returned to the closet to find Remus, James joined him.</p>
<p>“Just so we don’t get attacked by any dementors.” James gave a nervous smile as Sirius rolled his eyes at him. As they walk deeper and deeper into the closet, piles and piles of forgotten clothing went tumbling down as Sirius made his way through with James right behind him. After what felt like hours, for James that is, they heard small sobs from one of the many piles.</p>
<p>“Padfoot!!” </p>
<p>“Yeah, I hear it too.” The two went slowly towards one of the piles where the sound was strongest. As Sirius was about to move the pile, a coat came flying towards them. Sirius recognising the piece of cloth didn’t think much about it. But James had cast his patronus and when that did nothing, he ran away and out the closet slamming the doors shut after him. As Sirius moved the pile, he was face to face with a sobbing Remus.</p>
<p>“There you are Moony! I’ve been looking or you all over!” As he looked down at the sobbing Remus, he realized what was in the pile. All the sweaters Remus himself had given him.</p>
<p>“Hey.” Sirius made a cushion from some of the stuff from another pile and sat down in front of Remus.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong Remus?” The other didn’t answer but merely tried to bury himself in the sweaters again.</p>
<p>You know, I do use them Remus. All of them actually. When I’m at home, waiting for us to be together again. I hide myself in here, but a sweater on and hide myself in the rest. I always put on the newest, or the first one you made me.” He picked up a sweater and showed it to Remus. </p>
<p>“Really?” A small voice. But that was all Sirius needed, and at once he was over Remus. A passionate kiss linking them together. Rolling around so Remus was placed on top of him, Sirius answered.</p>
<p>“Really.” Another passionate kiss, and the two was lost there in the dark comfy of the many sweaters.</p>
<p align="center">----</p>
<p>On the other side of the closet door, was James and Peter. James still scared of the so called dementor in the closet, and Peter scared for his friends who was still in there.</p>
<p>“Wormtail!” The trampling man looked at his friend.</p>
<p>“Well have to leave the two of them in there for a while. I think I have a slight, what shall we call it, hunch, that the two are in there more often than the two of us would like to know.” With that, he turned on his heels and dragged Peter with him. </p>
<p align="center">----</p>
<p>The next morning was a sunday, so James and Peter never saw Remus and Sirius exit the closet and go get breakfast. The two was just there when they arrived. </p>
<p>“Fun night Padfoot?” Sirius turned his head to see Lily Evans walking over to him.</p>
<p>“How could you tell?” She smiled at him before looking to Remus.</p>
<p>“Well, for starters, both you and Remus are smiling like maniacs, and James isn’t. And also, both of you probably hasn’t looked at a mirror, but your hair is all over the place. And that goes for both of you.?</p>
<p>“They were in the closet all night Evans.” James finally turned to face Lily and gave her a smile.</p>
<p>“Well that explains something.” She gave a small nod before heading off to her friends. after only a few steps she stopped and turned around.</p>
<p>“Next time you decide to go in to the closet, let me join. I’ve always wanted to know how much clothing that man has!”</p>
<p>“It’s a date then Evans!” She gave James a mischievous smile before nodding and turning around. Though exams was near, it would have to be some time next year, but Lily Evans could hardly wait. She was starting to like James Potter. The relationship between Sirius and Remus had but a stop to something in James, but what it was she couldn't say. All she knew, was that he wasn’t such a jerk anymore.</p>
