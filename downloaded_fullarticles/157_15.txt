  <em>Mingi</em>
</p><p>“FINAL CALL!” THE CONDUCTOR’S voice boomed out across Platform 9 ¾. “Final call aboard the Hogwarts Express!”</p><p>Mingi sprinted towards the train doors, shoving his trolley in front of him. “If you had any sense of time,” he panted to his friend next to him, “we wouldn’t be in this fucking mess!”</p><p>“Me?” Yunho snorted. “You’re the one who kept repacking twelve different pairs of shoes.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, we were at your house so your responsibility,” Mingi retorted.</p><p>They shoved their trunks into the luggage carriage and leapt aboard with a sense of victory. Seconds later, the train doors closed behind them. Mingi glared at his friend. “That was way too close,” he gasped.</p><p>The train belched white smoke and the conductor blew a whistle. A moment later, the train lurched beneath Mingi’s feet and King’s Cross Station began to slide away from them. Parents waved from the platform with varying expressions of delight at seeing their offspring disappear and first year parent worry.  </p><p>Yunho laughed and slapped Mingi on the back. “Let’s go see if the others made it.”</p><p>Mingi groaned and slung an arm around Yunho’s shoulders. “Only if you hold me up. I just used all my energy for the week running here.”</p><p>Yunho snorted, “You’re a lightweight, Song,” but he slung his arm around Mingi’s waist without hesitation.  </p><p>As it turned out, the others had made it. After poking their heads into compartment after compartment and having chocolate frogs thrown at them, they heard a distinctive high-pitched laugh. Mingi and Yunho exchanged a glance. “Well, that’s Wooyoung at least,” Mingi said.  </p><p>Yunho dragged him forward. “C’mon, let’s face the music.”</p><p>Yunho pulled open the compartment door to find three boys cackling in various stares of disarray. Upon seeing Mingi and Yunho, the boy with lavender hair and mischievous eyes swore and slumped in his seat. The boy next to him with shoulder length black hair and a blond under cut grinned and stuck out his hand. “Pay up, bitch.”</p><p>The lavender scowled and a handful of silver sickles exchanged hands.</p><p>Mingi looked to the third boy who sat on the opposite side. “What were they betting on?”</p><p>The third boy barely looked up from the book he was reading. “You,” he said crisply.</p><p>“What did we do?” Yunho asked as he pushed Mingi inside the compartment and shut the door.</p><p>Mingi dropped down onto the cushioned seats next to the lavender and poked him. “What was it, Wooyoung?”</p><p>Wooyoung fell sideways into San’s lap. “I bet you wouldn’t make it in time,” he said lazily. “San bet you would.”</p><p>Mingi exchanged a look with Yunho. “We need new friends.”</p><p>“Too late, goblins, you’re stuck with us.” Wooyoung’s laugh turned into a squawk as San pinched him.</p><p>They began to tussle, San’s tall lean frame well matched with Wooyoung’s shorter more muscular one. Mingi ignored them with the ease of long practice.</p><p>“Where are Hongjoong and Seonghwa?” Yunho asked from the seat he’d taken next to the reading Yeosang.</p><p>Yeosang finally closed his book and looked up. He wasn’t really that studious, but Mingi guessed that he’d just been looking for an excuse to ignore Wooyoung and San’s squawking. “Smooching with the prefects,” Yeosang said. “Apparently, there’s going to be a big announcement at the feast tonight and everyone’s trying to figure out what it is.” He pushed his blond hair away from his face. He hadn’t cut it over the summer and it was now past his years, but Mingi thought it looked good.  </p><p>“Rumor has it only the prefects and the Head Boy and Girl know what it is,” San added.</p><p>Somewhere in the last thirty seconds, they’d stopped fighting and now Wooyoung half lay in San’s lap. San ran his hands through Wooyoung’s hair, and if Wooyoung were a cat he’d be purring. Mingi’s friends were disgusting. Adorable, but mostly disgusting.</p><p>Mingi avoided Yunho’s gaze.</p><p>The five of them were all the same age at nineteen and all second years, or soon to be. They’d met last year and despite coming from different houses, they’d quickly become inseparable. Mingi was in Hufflepuff along with Yunho, and everyone said they were like oversized puppies. It was kind of hilarious in an ironic way. San and Yeosang were in Slytherin, which made complete sense to Mingi. Yeosang had the sharpest tongue and no conscience, and San, despite his laughter, was one of the most ambitious, driven, hardworking people Mingi knew. And Wooyoung was in Gryffindor because he was a brat.</p><p>Hongjoong and Seonghwa joined them later, after they’d gotten well out of London and were belching their way through the rolling hills of the English countryside. The two piled into the compartment together and were immediately pounced on by the others.</p><p>“They live!” Wooyoung yelled.</p><p>“What did you find out?” San asked.</p><p>Hongjoong, a tiny Ravenclaw with a quirky blond mullet that did nothing to soften his sharp expression slumped in the seat he’d taken next to Yunho. “Nothing,” he grumbled. “None of the prefects would say anything. Smug bastards.”</p><p>“I tried to corner Jin,” Seonghwa added. “We’re supposed to be friends. We’re both Gryffindors, but he just laughed and told the same old stupid cow joke.”</p><p>They were the oldest at twenty and both going to be third years, but where Hongjoong was short and blond, Seonghwa was tall with black hair and looked like a model. Mingi smirked. Of course, he and Yunho both had an inch on Seonghwa. They used it at every opportunity.</p><p>Wooyoung shook his head. “I’ll never understand how he, Namjoon, and Yoongi fit together.”</p><p>Seonghwa hit his arm. “Be nice.”</p><p>Wooyoung opened his mouth to protest, but San slapped a hand over his mouth.</p><p>Hongjoong and Seonghwa had caught the five putting pink socks on every statue and coat of armor in the castle on Halloween last year and decided it was a brilliant prank. The five had claimed the two ever since.</p><p>The trolley soon came by, and Wooyoung leapt up to buy what seemed like half of everything. But as Mingi munched his way through several chocolate frogs and pumpkin pasties, he certainly wasn’t going to complain. The others battled to swap cards and Mingi smiled, but the worry he’d been pushing aside was creeping back in and making it difficult to laugh.</p><p>Yunho gripped his shoulder, suddenly seated next to him. ‘It’ll be fine,” he muttered quietly.</p><p>Mingi certainly hoped so.  </p><p>When the first sighting of Hogwarts came into view, seated atop its rocky outcrop past Hogsmeade, a long breath whooshed out of Mingi. Some of the weight lifted from his chest. It hadn’t been a bad summer. He’d spent most of it with Yunho and Yunho’s family at their house, but Hogwarts was home.</p><p>Yunho squeezed his shoulder again. Mingi turned to look at his friend and found Yunho’s brown eyes warm with understanding. His white blond hair was like a halo around his head. Mingi swallowed hard. He smushed his face against the glass of the window to quell his rising emotion.</p><p>Getting off at the Hogsmeade train station and into the carriages was an unpleasant jolt. It had gotten darker than Mingi realized from inside the train. He exchanged a look with Yunho. Mirroring anxiety lined his face. They knew it was going to happen tonight. The timing was one thing Mingi never forgot, but it was going to be tight.</p><p>Mingi took out his sudden nerves on the skeletal horse thestrals and gave them a glare as he hurried into a carriage. He knew they were harmless, at least to him, but he still didn’t like them. He didn’t like what they represented. He didn’t like what they made him remember. It had been quite the shock last year, first just seeing them, realizing that not everyone could, and then why he could. Out of his group, it was just him, Yunho, and San. Mingi knew Yunho’s story, it was the same as his, but he didn’t know San’s. San hadn’t volunteered the information and Mingi hadn’t asked.</p><p>Mingi grew tenser the longer they stayed in the carriage. There was a tingling in his fingers and toes and he sat back, hiding from the window. They needed to get out. He felt Hongjoong’s gaze on him and shook his head at his friend. They weren’t going to make it to the feast.</p><p>Hongjoong was the only one of their group who knew his and Yunho’s secret. He’d accidentally stumbled upon it last year, and had been far more understanding than Mingi ever could have hoped for. Now, Hongjoong understood without Mingi saying anything. Hongjoong also kept track of the timing.  </p><p>When the carriages rolled across the Hogwarts Bridge and stopped in the courtyard in front of the Great Hall, Hongjoong waved them away. “I’ll take care of your luggage and the others,” he muttered. “Just go.”</p><p>Mingi didn’t second guess his friend. He and Yunho promptly began to race across the courtyard. Wooyoung let out a surprised yell. “Where are they going?”</p><p>Mingi turned and made a face. Hopefully Wooyoung would take that to mean they were up to one of their tricks. He could come up with something later.</p><p>Yunho yanked him back around. “Move,” he said.</p><p>It was definitely going to be tight. Mingi could feel it coming. The tingle crawled up his spine and his hands shook. The low hum of irritation and excess energy he’d been feeling all day grew stronger by the minute.</p><p>Mingi panted as he ran through the stone corridors and arched doorways, Yunho keeping pace next to him. All the other students were headed into the Great Hall for the feast so no one tried to stop them. Only the portraits called out questions and a few jumped from picture to picture to follow.</p><p>They raced down flights of stairs towards the dungeons and skidded to a halt in front of a plain wooden door tucked behind a staircase. Hogwarts had secrets, every student knew that and everyone knew different bits and pieces. This one was Mingi and Yunho’s.</p><p>Mingi hissed, “<em>Alohomora</em>,” and the lock clicked open. Mingi yanked the door open and Yunho locked it behind him. There was a short hallway and then stone stairs carried them even deeper below Hogwarts. They ran down the stairs until Mingi felt like he wanted to claw something out.</p><p>The stairs ended in another door that Mingi also unlocked. Yunho pressed himself up against Mingi’s back. “What’s taking so fucking long?” he asked impatiently. </p><p>“Can you wait two seconds?” Mingi snapped back.</p><p>He finally got the door open even with his shaking hands. The moment it closed behind them, Mingi whipped around and slammed Yunho against the door. He yanked Yunho’s head down into a violent kiss. Yunho groaned into it and dug his fingers into Mingi’s sides as he kissed back with equal violence.</p><p>It was always like this the night of the full moon. Nothing Mingi had read had been able to give him a concrete answer as to why, but it was something to do with the transformation, something to do with all the excess energy running through him. Or maybe it was just them.  </p><p>Mingi bit Yunho’s shoulder hard enough to leave a mark in the morning. Yunho swore and looked at Mingi with glazed eyes. “You’re wearing too many clothes,” he rasped.</p><p>Mingi yanked his school robe over his head. “So are you,” he said.</p><p>Yunho stripped off his own robe and his underlying shirt and slacks. He turned around, placing his hands flat against the door and turned his head to the side. “C’mon,” he said. “Do it.”</p><p>Mingi didn’t need a second invitation. He spat into his hand and rubbed his rapidly hardening cock. He stepped closer and rutted against the cleft of Yunho’s ass. He bit the back of Yunho’s neck and Yunho winced, his head dropping to hit the door with a thud.</p><p>But it wasn’t right like this. The thing inside Mingi wasn’t satisfied. He dragged Yunho away from the door and shoved him down until he hit the ground on his hands and knees. Mingi got behind him and kicked his knees apart. Yunho tried to rise and turn around, but Mingi pushed Yunho’s shoulders down, forcing Yunho to arch his back and present his ass. Mingi growled in satisfaction. Words were difficult in this state. They weren’t usually like this. Rough didn’t come naturally to either of them, but like this…</p><p>Mingi lined up his cock and thrust, forcing his way into Yunho’s body. Yunho let out a sharp cry and his body spasmed. Mingi groaned in response. His hands gripped Yunho’s hips hard enough to bruise, keeping him in place as Mingi shoved until his balls hit Yunho’s ass and his cock was buried all the way inside. He pulled out only to thrust back in, the tight heat around his cock making his vision grow blurry.</p><p>It was fast and messy and Mingi barely noticed Yunho gasping beneath him as he rocked back to meet Mingi’s thrusts. They had no control like this, no finesse. With the moon this high, it was little more than an animalistic mounting. As his release hit the edge, Mingi released a howl and threw his head back. Yunho followed a moment later, one hand jerking himself off.</p><p>They finished not a second too soon because Mingi felt the change rip through him a moment later. His back arched and his elongating nails clawed at the floor. It was going to be a rough one. They hadn’t had time to get Wolfsbane. Mingi felt his consciousness fade to the back as the wolf took over. He tilted his head back and howled again. Next to him, Yunho mirrored the movement. Another moment later, there was nothing.   </p><p>Mingi woke to the feeling of warmth. He sighed and tried to curl deeper into it only to find he couldn’t move. The warmth was a heavy weight plastered over his back. On top of him, Yunho grumbled.</p><p>Bleary consciousness slowly returned and Mingi squinted, trying to take stock of their surroundings. The windowless room was mostly as they’d left it, not that there was much in it. The stone walls of the cave-like room were bare. They’d covered the floor in carpets to make it easier on their bodies. The only other object was a small chest where they kept extra blankets and emergency bandages.</p><p>Mingi shifted and promptly winced. His whole body ached. It would for days.</p><p>Yunho’s arms tightened around him. “Stop moving,” he grumbled. It felt like Yunho’s face was smushed somewhere between Mingi’s shoulder blades.    </p><p>Someone coughed. It took Mingi a second to register it and when he did, he realized with horror that the sound had come from the door, not the body on top of him. He stumbled to his feet, shoving Yunho away. He found a young-looking boy in a Gryffindor robe staring at them in alarmed fascination.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Yunho squinted from the floor.  </p><p>Mingi stared at the boy before flushing red as he realized he and Yunho were still naked. He hurried to grab a blanket from the chest and wrap it around his waist before turning back around. “What are you doing here?” he asked with aggressive defensiveness.</p><p>The boy raised his hands and took a step back. “Listen, it was an accident, promise. I’m a first year. The feast finished and I got lost and ended up here.” He looked around the cave room with obvious confusion.</p><p>The boy was short but obviously muscular, not that Mingi was wondering if he could take him in a fight. But even more concerning was how calm the boy looked beneath his ordinary black haircut. It was freaking Mingi out. In fact, it looked like Mingi was panicking far more than the boy was.</p><p>“Uh, what exactly did you see?” Yunho asked. He was still seated on the floor, his hands covering his crotch. Mingi threw a blanket at him.</p><p>The boy looked at them unimpressed. “I was on the stairs and I heard a lot of howling and, well,” he scratched his head in sudden embarrassment. “See, I’m a muggle and my parents work with injured wild animals in Wales, and I don’t really know how things work here. I thought some wolves were trapped, which would be really weird now that I think about it, but then I found you–” The boy abruptly gave them a stern frown. “Listen, I don’t know what kinky shit you’re into, but I really don’t need to know.”</p><p>Mingi choked. Did he think…well it was better than the truth.</p><p>The boy’s eyes abruptly widened as he processed what he’d just said. “Wait, holy shit, are you two werewolves? Are those a real thing?”</p><p>Yunho leapt to his feet in alarm. “Listen, you can’t tell anyone!”</p><p>So much for keeping that a secret.</p><p>“Wait, are you saying that you really are werewolves?” The boy took a step back and his eyes moved back and forth between Mingi and Yunho. His incredulous expression slowly faded into a frown. “You’re both terrified, aren’t you?” he said slowly.</p><p>Mingi raised his hands. “Just please promise you won’t say anything,” he pleaded.</p><p>The boy tilted his head to one side. “Does the school know?” he asked quietly.</p><p>“Yes,” Yunho said quickly. “They gave us this room for, for,” he stumbled over his words. “For the full moon every month.”</p><p>“Alright,” the boy nodded. “I guess the rest of it isn’t really my business. I’ll just, uh,” his gaze flicked between Mingi and Yunho. “I’ll let you get dressed and back to whatever you were doing.”</p><p>“Uh, thanks,” Yunho said dazedly.</p><p>The boy opened the door and turned to leave.</p><p>“Hey,” Mingi called after him. “What’s your name you terrifying first year muggle?”</p><p>The boy turned around and grinned. “Jongho. My name’s Jongho.”  </p>
