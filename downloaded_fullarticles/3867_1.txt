    <p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     The steam engine horn sounded through the station, calling the students away from their parents to climb aboard. The place was filled with chatter and excitement, with a hint of anxiety from the new coming first years.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Although, one in the midst of fresh face was not eleven, but a sixth year and at the age of seventeen. A female, by the name of Alice Crimson, who was standing out beyond measures, unbeknown to her. With brown wavy hair that fell to her waist and light brown eyes, and a great bone structure to go along with it. Alice was petite, only reaching the height of out 165 cm (5’5”), accompanied by a lanky body. She was new, but older, which caused some people to tilt their heads. But what caused most heads to turn, despite her obvious beauty, was the fact that all her luggage was floating behind her in mid air. She didn't care enough to grab a cart if someone was going to unload it only minutes later.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     The young Crimson did not have her wand out, but instead has her nose stuck deep into a book focusing on the topic of Occlumency and Legilimency. She weaved in and out of the crowd, ignoring the looks as if there weren’t paying any mind to her, going to drop off her luggage at the storage cart of the train. Without even looking up she let her items fall elegantly on the floor in front of the attendant, without letting them make any sound of a <em>thud</em>. Quite advanced in wandless magic for her age.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Thank you, sir. It’s much appreciated.” She spoke firmly to the man in the uniform, looking up from her book once she finished her paragraph and stuck a book marker in the page. Alice smiled warmly at him, trying to ease the edge she usually gave off with her uptight manners. “If you have any questions about my things, please don’t hesitate to find me and ask.” With that, the brown haired girl’s smile fell off her face as she spun around in place before promptly walking back towards the center of the train.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     As she glided about, Alice finally acknowledged her surroundings, observing the place as her eyes gaze went up, down and around. She locked eyes with people a few times, only giving people smiles to those who gave them to her first. The others? Who cares, they gawked at her and she didn’t have time for such silly and immature things.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Not too long after, she found herself a barren compartment inside the red train, with no other soul inhabiting it, and sighed with a smile in relief.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Thank goodness…” She muttered to herself as she sat down with good posture and crossing her legs. “I don’t have to deal with pleasantries quite yet.” Crimson opened her book once more, taking out the black tassel on a string from the page, as that was her page marker. Smiling to herself, she looked out of the window and noticed they had already departed from the station, as what surrounded her were fields of bright green grass past what her eyes could see. Alice let her back finally relax against the back of her cushioned seat, as she looked out at the nature. Something she truly loved, nature, her secret release from the stress of her wonder filled world.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p><p dir="ltr" align="center">⠠⠸⠈⠞⠻</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Alice was instructed by Professor McGonagall to wait on the right side of the Great Hall near the High Table, where all the instructors and professors sat during meals and events. Rather bored with the lengthy process of initiating all the first years by sorting them into the four legendary houses, she took this time to scan the room full of people. She only spent about thirty seconds looking at the vast amount of students, and instead put her energy into reading her superiors. By their body language, little quirks, and comments she could somewhat make out from time to time, she eyed all of them that she was able to see with her short height, trying to figure them out so she could later use their assets to her best interests. The girl alone in the corner suddenly chuckled to herself, thinking:</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     <em>‘Goodness me, if that thought wasn’t a true Slytherin in a nutshell, I don’t know what is.’ </em></p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     What snapped her out of her head was the sudden loss of murmurs in the room, making her look to the center of the High Table, seeing Headmaster Dumbledore rise from his high back seat before he spoke.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “We have one more addition to the student body of Hogwarts, however she is not a first year. Her name is Alice Crimson, and she will be a sixth year transferring from the Beauxbaton Academy of France. Please do greet her with open arms once she is sorted.” The Headmaster spoke in a gentle voice, but one that was still powerful enough to command the room.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     As if that were her cue, Alice began to make her way to sit on the stool, after bowing slightly to Dumbledore out of respect. Force of habit. Professor McGonagall placed the ragged Sorting Hat on her wavy ended hair and it grunted, almost annoyed.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Do I even need to think about Crimson? SLYTHERIN!” Yelled the hat rather too aggressively for Alice’s liking, for it was on top of her head and so close to her sensitive ears. She scowled as she looked up at the brim of the hat before it was lifted from the top of her tiny head. She smiled at the crowd before her, giving them eyes that almost said, <em>‘Don’t worry, I’m a good Slytherin’</em>. Crimson took a seat at the long wooden table where people were clapping the most at their new addition.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Immediately, she was met by the older students of her house, as they bombarded her with questions that she didn’t care to answer. She could tell none of them were smart enough, or anyone of importance to waste energy on, so Alice made it clear that she didn’t care to talk, and that the book in her hand deserved more attention than them.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Hey, what’s your name? I’m Melissa Fisher.” Ask a girl with black hair in tight curls.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Didn’t you hear a word the Headmaster said?”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Oh…” The girl muttered off, immediately intimidated.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Hey, you come from that French girl academy where all the chicks are hot, right? Why don’t you meet with me in our Common Room so we can get to know each other?” A douchebag of a boy asked, wrapping his arm around her shoulder, slightly making her hair pulled under the weight of his arm. Quickly, she turned towards his face that was rather close to hers, and said in a vicious and quiet voice.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Have you no morals?...” Alice spat. Her eyes changed from that pretty light brown to a menacing dark red.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “She’s right man, stop flirting with every girl you find.” One of his friends beckoned. He released her out of his grasp and her eyes changed back to their original and more normal shade.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Crimson sighed, realizing that she wasn’t getting off to a good start, and that might affect her chances of being able to meet anyone of any potential if word got around about her personality. She decided that her previous choice was not a wise one, so in the moment, she thought up of an effortless story.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “I truly do apologize to the both of you for my rudeness. It’s just quite an overwhelming day, with all these new situations and transitions, so I forgot my manners.” She smiled at them with an apologetic look. “My deepest apologies, I hope you can forgive me and we can start fresh.” <em>'I don’t have any regrets what I just said to either of you, but fine, I’ll go along with your pleasantries, only to gain ground and climb to the top of this social ladder.’</em></p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Suddenly, Alice could feel a tug at her consciousness, making her eyes go slightly wide in alarm. Someone was trying to read her thoughts. She darted her eyes towards the one area where anyone would even have that capability: The High Table. She found the culprit.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     They locked eyes, and both immediately putting their abilities of Occlumency to higher use, but she noticed his was up constantly.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     <em>‘What a drain that must be.’</em>, Crimson thought. His eyes gave a look of slight surprise and interest and raised his brow, noticing she was not only had the ability of such power, but that she was able to detect him. That, he was not expecting from a sixth year, and did not prepare for it, thus, getting him caught. Alice tilted her head in curiosity, just as a cat would, and her eyes twinkled in sudden intrigue.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     A strict demeanor, raven hair, and deep black eyes. A mean face looked back at her, but she could only smile slightly from their riveting first meet.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Snapping back to the people in front of her, she smiled at their agreement to forgive her terrible behavior. Alice decided to inquire about the mysterious professor.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “I hate to ask, but who is the professor with black hair and black clothing?” Alice asked, her tone of voice sweet but firm. The students around her all groaned in unison.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “That’s Professor Severus Snape; he teaches potions and is unfortunately our Head of House. He’s ruthlessly mean and merciless. Don’t do even the tiniest thing incorrect, or he’ll snap at you for it for weeks!”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Her light brown eyes widened once more, but only slightly, as she showed a fake expression of alarm to her features. “Is that so? Well, I don’t like to toot my own horn, but I’m rather good in potions, and know how to work around personalities.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     “Don’t be,” said the rude boy from before. He took a gulp of his Pumpkin Juice before continuing, “You’re gonna need it.”</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     Alice only laughed as they all started to rant in their own conversations of past run ins with the supposed mean teacher, letting her eat in peace while reading her book, with a small smile played on her lips.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">     <em>‘Now there’s a person worth my attention.’</em></p>
