    <p>Years pass as a seemingly ordinary young adult boards the red steam train, leaving from platform 9 ¾. Why must she take the train? She knew the way. She thought haughtily, sighing as she dully stared past the rain streaked window, to the scenery zipping past. How did she get in this predicament? It was September now, the start of a new school year. Her memories from earlier whizzed past as fast as the scenery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A shadowy figure floats past Dumbledore’s peripheral vision. Because of the recent events of Voldemort and his minions, Dementors have been assigned to patrol the outskirts of the school grounds. There had been rumours of the Dementors entering the castle at night, but he had yet to see one. Thinking he had best investigate, Dumbledore turns on his heel and begins to follow where he had seen the black cloaked figure disappear. Rounding corner after corner, and missing the creature every time, he decides to call it a night and let the other teachers know. Returning to his office, he sees Snape pointing a wand at the thing he had been following. However, it was not a Dementor like he originally thought. It was a hooded person, face hidden by an overly large raven skull. Seemingly undisturbed at the sight of someone threatening them, he felt as if their eyes shifted to him.</p>
<p>“I found this person skulking about the grounds, Headmaster.” Snape spat his words.</p>
<p>A Death Eater? No. The points are generally on their robed hoods, not the smooth bone of their skull masks.</p>
<p>Taking a step and standing next to Snape, he examines this person. By the height, they are an adult, not a child. Their shoulders are not broad, so they are not a man. What sort of woman wears this kind of attire? Dumbledore’s eyes shift to the clasp on the woman’s cloak. A silver crescent moon. He strokes his beard. The aura she seems to emanate is slightly Machiavellian in nature, and the air around her feels cold, however, he feels that she is not inherently evil.</p>
<p>“And whom might you be, young lady?” Dumbledore asks with his usual kindness, approaching her with a solid stride. Snape raises his wand higher, aiming at her throat in case she tries anything. The woman answers with silence, yet does not attempt to move. She is obviously not afraid of these two ‘older’ men.</p>
<p>“Interesting…” Dumbledore says once more, circling the woman and then stopping in front of her once again, peering into the mask and the shadow the her hood is creating. “Some people say that eyes are the windows to the soul… is that why you cover yours with the spell of darkness?” She is yet to speak, but he senses her smirk. There is a brief flash of gold from beyond the veil of shadow. “You are… ah, I see.” He strokes his long beard once more.</p>
<p>“I have had quite enough of this!” Snape snaps, as he basically lunges at the cloaked figure, wand pointing, as if he is fencing with an epee. The wand’s tip touches the forehead of her mask. Staring at her all the while, Dumbledore commands Snape to lower his wand in a hurry. Confused as to why, Snape stares into the darkness of the hood. His blood runs cold as he sees the swirling golden eyes staring back at him, goading him to continue his assault. Snape drops his wand instantly, unable to believe it is who he thinks it is. It’s not possible. They’re a myth, a legend. And if they <em>were </em>real, why would they come now? And why to Hogwarts? Refocusing his attention, he sees Dumbledore bow slightly as he addresses the woman.</p>
<p>“Please, follow me, I will call an emergency staff meeting immediately.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The staff are gathered in the small meeting room, just outside of Dumbledore’s office stairwell, wondering what the emergency is and wondering if it is relating to the rumours of the dementors entering the castle. Dumbledore descends the stairs, as Snape sticks to the main door, keeping an ear and eye out for the troublesome three and their talent for sticking their noses into where they should not. It may not yet be the start of the semester, but they tend to appear when not wanted.</p>
<p>“I’ve gathered you here because we have a very important visitor.” Dumbledore booms.</p>
<p>The teachers/staff look around the room and at each other.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Hagrid asks, not seeing the person to whom Dumbledore was referring.</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiles enigmatically, “Someone who is very much real, and has fooled all of us.”</p>
<p>At that signal, a cloaked figure slowly descends the stairs gracefully. All eyes are on her as she takes her foot off the last step and stands in front, yet slightly to the side of Dumbledore. A two fingered, soft black leathered sleeve exits the crushed velvet and raven feathered cloak, and unclasps the raven skull mask. Attention was briefly drawn to the remaining three fingers which were uncovered, as they were perfectly manicured in black nail polish tipped with forest green. Removing the mask with her right hand, the stranger reached up with her left at the same time, pulling the hood down and allowing her raven black hair to fall down her shoulders like an obsidian waterfall. Snape briefly looked with disinterest in the direction as he heard them all gasp. His eyes grew wide. She was surprisingly beautiful. The raven feathers tucked behind her ears and the silver circlet on her head made her look like a Valkyrie. Her winged eyeliner was simple yet perfect, making the colour of her blood red lipstick all the brighter. Her skin was a smooth and alabaster, whilst the silky black of her hair glimmered slightly in the light, reflecting hidden tones of a deep purple.</p>
<p>As she opened her eyes slowly, the staff began to whisper amongst themselves.</p>
<p>“That’s not possible.”</p>
<p>“What does this mean?”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t the Beauxbatons champion eyes of similar colour? A relation perhaps? Mother? Sister?”</p>
<p>Snape and Dumbledore both smiled wryly to themselves. These were the exact thoughts they had had, when they first laid eyes upon her amethyst ringed emerald green retinas. However, the truth was far stranger.</p>
<p>“I’d like you to meet Branwen Merla. She has not shared why she is here, but I welcome her nonetheless. I expect you to be cooperative in whatever she may ask.”</p>
<p> “Won’t the students ask questions if there is a mysterious stranger wandering about the grounds?” Hagrid breaches the question the others were thinking.</p>
<p>“We could have her teach defence of the dark arts.” Professor Macgonnagal mentions.</p>
<p>Branwen’s eyes stare straight at Snape. She knows he had always wanted that position, and anyways, if she HAD to teach, she would prefer potions. Although all she really knew how to make was poison. Parting her lips, Branwen opens her mouth for the teachers for first time.</p>
<p>“If I may.”</p>
<p>Her sultry hushed tone murmured like wind whispering in the trees, as her voice sounded around the empty room. Starting from the floor where her cloak lay, small wisps of purple-black smoke gathered and swirled around her body, slowly turning into a very large plume. The now thick smoke fully encased Branwen, blocking her from view. Almost as immediate as it started, it vanished, leaving still a cloaked figure, however smaller and physically younger than she was previously.</p>
<p>They all stare, mouths agape. Is it possible that Branwen <em>was </em>the champion?</p>
<p>Picking up on the vague thoughts, she decides to reply. “That is correct. I have a plethora of names, including one that literally translates to ‘she of many names’. However, I implore you to call me my birth name, not that of Beauxbatons champion.”</p>
<p>“Won’t a Beauxbaton girl in Hogwarts cause quite a commotion?”</p>
<p>Branwen removes her cloak.</p>
<p>“I see. Becoming a student. Marvellous idea, albeit a tad risky. People are sure to recognise you.”</p>
<p> “You would be amazed at how many things go unnoticed in this school.” Branwen smirks as she adjusts her tie.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sighing to herself once more, she stretched her legs out in her empty carriage. She preferred to be alone, the last few years spent in isolation, honing, controlling and perfecting her skills – albeit with little effort. She had even begun to research herself, reading the stories with amusement and interest, discovering that she had been constructed into many different forms – some of which were not far from the truth. She had also visited the old village that had once condemned her, and found it had become a tourist trap and residential area. Asking around in town, she found that in the years after she disappeared, they sparked a search and burned or hung anyone that may be considered a witch. The Salem Witch Trials, they called it.</p>
<p>Branwen snorted. Stupid mortals. She should’ve shown them what <em>really </em>happened that day… she thinks as the pitter patter of the rain grows heavier on the locomotives roof.</p>
<p>She had no luggage, she needed nothing but her talents. Why did she decide to return after all this time? She was not a child, nor a teen. And what was with these outfits? At least in Beauxbatons she could don her cloak. She belonged to no house, so her uniform consisted of a simple black satin tie, a crescent moon pin clipped onto her lapel. Her black pleated skirt was surprisingly short, luckily the majority of her legs were covered by her thigh-high black socks. She refused to wear the Mary-janes that the other school kids of the female genre wore, even if they weren’t that bad. They just weren’t her. Instead, she decided on a pair of heeled ankle boots, small silver links decorating them and matching the mysterious slight shine of her pin. She huffed in annoyance as she thought to herself, crossing her legs once more. A familiar face floats in her mind. It’s only been a few years, but… will he remember her? No, he will remember who she <em>was.</em> Feeling a self-depreciative smile tugging her lips, she shoved these thoughts toward the back of her mind. No. Enough. Shaking her head lightly, she continued her internal struggle, until the carriage door slid open.</p>
<p>Looking out of the corner of her eye, she saw three teens walk in. Two boys and one girl.</p>
<p>“All the other carriages are full, do you mind?” The boy with glasses asked her. She shot him a sidelong glance and resumed staring out the window. They share a look.</p>
<p>“She’s very rude.” The girl whispers to the other two, as she takes a seat diagonally across from the stranger, closest to the door.</p>
<p>“Maybe she doesn’t speak English? Look at her uniform.”</p>
<p>“Is she a transfer? Do Hogwarts even have transfers?”</p>
<p>“Hello, I’m Harry. What’s your name?” The boy with the glasses asks her, sitting in front of her and attempting to get her attention. She lifts her chin up off the palm of her hand and turns her eyes to him. Harry’s eyes widen a little as he sees the colour of hers.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong Harry?” The orange haired boy sits next to the stranger.</p>
<p>“N-nothing.” He stutters slightly. <em>Odd coloured eyes… it’s almost as if they were staring right through me.</em><em> Where have I seen those eyes before...?</em></p>
<p>She shuffles closer to the window, allowing the boy next to her more room.</p>
<p>“See, she isn’t rude.”</p>
<p>“Maybe she’s just shy?”</p>
<p>She holds back a snort. Shy? Her? Heh. It has surprised her slightly that they haven’t recognised her yet. Especially since Harry was in the tournament also. Can clothes really change a person’s perception? Curious.</p>
<p>The orange haired boy rubs his arms slightly. “It’s very cold in here. How odd.”</p>
<p><em>“Sorry, not sorry.” </em>She thinks with a silent bemused chuckle. <em>“I think I found some new playmates. How fun~” </em></p>
<p>The train ride continues on without any hitch, relatively speaking. Other than the odd tricks played on them - noises, or misplaced item in the possession of the three. Deciding to befriend the strange and mysterious girl, Harry is the first to speak.</p>
<p>“As I said, I’m Harry Potter. That’s Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger.”</p>
<p>Branwen lowers her head in a nod, careful as to not let anyone else see her eyes.</p>
<p>“And you are…?”</p>
<p>She sighs internally. That’s just what she needs, she thinks with disdain.</p>
<p>The jolt of the train reaching its destination and the clamour to get out distracts the teens temporarily. This was the perfect opportunity.</p>
<p>“If you ever need anything-” Turning back around, they see the mysterious passenger has disappeared.</p>
<p>“Maybe she’s already outside?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe.” Harry replies as he hears a howl and sees a black fox slink away from the platform.</p>
