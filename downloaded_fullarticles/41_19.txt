    <p>The late August sun sparkled.</p><p>It sparkled off the windows, onto the sidewalk, and into Hermione Granger's eyes. She scrambled away from her Hogsmeade flat, towards the tip of a lilac-gray tail that poked out from under a bush.</p><p>It didn't make any sense, and Hermione couldn't stand things that didn't make sense.</p><p>On the pages of her Kneazle's gilded-edged, hardcover biography were the words classy, particular—snobbish, even. Never "adventurer." Never "mischievous."</p><p>Hermione glared at the blooming snozzberry bush in Honeydukes' shop-side garden. "Draco! What are you doing?"</p><p>"I live here, Granger."</p><p>Hermione's hand flew to her heart as she whirled around. Where seconds ago had been nobody at all stood Draco Malfoy.</p><p>"No, I meant—nevermind." She grimaced. This was an unfortunate surprise, and not one she had time to deal with at the moment</p><p>The concrete warmed her knees as she crouched to peer into the bush's dense green leaves. She reached into it and pulled out a beautiful white Kneazle with pale grey ears, legs, and tail.</p><p>"I'm Hogwarts' new Potions Master, in case you hadn't heard." Draco Malfoy kicked at a pebble on the cobblestone path. He looked oddly self-conscious for someone who considered himself wizarding royalty.</p><p>"I hadn't. And I suppose you have yourself a flat in Hogsmeade?"</p><p>He pointed to the apartment building across the street. "I'm on the second floor."</p><p>"Just my luck," Hermione muttered into a faceful of pristine fur. Of course he was in that apartment—where else would he be? It was the only housing option in Hogsmeade if you didn't count the Hog's Head Inn. A wry smile pulled at Hermione's mouth as she imagined Draco Malfoy in a dingy bedroom above a noisy pub.</p><p>"What was that?" Draco asked.</p><p>"I said, good luck! I've met some of the incoming first-years—you're going to need it."</p><p>Draco grinned. "I'm sure I can brew a few calming draughts to help me through the first week."</p><p>"You're not abandoning my Muggle Studies class, are you?"</p><p>He took a step forward and reached his elegant fingers towards her. Her eyes widened until his fingertips ran through the fine white fur on her Kneazle's head. Draco purred.</p><p>"I think the Wizengamont would be rather put out if I stopped. Life-long duty, and all that."</p><p>Hermione nodded to herself, her long-standing suspicions confirmed. She supposed she could have asked, five years ago when he'd given his first lecture in her classroom.</p><p>She could have asked, but she didn't need to.</p><p>Hermione Granger was a people-reader.</p><p>She read them, not like those silly fantasy novels scattered over Ginny Potter's coffee table, but like her Hogwarts: A History textbook. Methodologically. Factually. She'd read the book Draco Malfoy: Aristocrat word for word, beginning with the detailed prologue: King of Hogwarts, Prince of Slytherin. It was all she needed to know. Despite his court-mandated community service, Draco was, somewhere deep-down, prejudiced. And none of the sincerity that seemed to accent his pretty words could change her mind. It was written. It was fact.</p><p>Still, it didn't stop her from admiring the precise way he combed his hair or the immaculate state of his robes. It was a simple, observable truth: along with prejudiced, Draco Malfoy was polished. Confident. Flirtatious to a fault.</p><p>When she returned to her flat, she dropped her familiar down to the carpet and scratched behind his ears. "You naughty thing. You're just as troublesome as your namesake."</p><p>Apartment B4 had a sense of wizarding whimsy that was present long before Hermione had moved in. The carpet was purple with blue pictures of various magical creatures. Whoever had designed the place had put the same ugly carpet in the hallways between flats as well.</p><p>It was so garish, Hermione had chosen simple, monochromatic furniture to add balance. She wasn't sure it had worked.</p><p>In the fridge were three rows of glass bottles, the kind with a metal cap and pictures of arctic glaciers on the label. She pulled one from the shelf and tipped it into a crystal bowl on her kitchen counter.</p><p>It had been almost two years since she had spied the cat in the window of Magical Menagerie, perched on a post with his nose in the air. The moment she saw his steel-grey eyes, pointy face, and aristocratic beauty, she knew she had to bring him home. He was the spitting image of a certain blond who haunted her classroom once a year--a certain blond whose voice sent shivers down her spine.</p><p>As she lowered the bowl to the floor, her Kneazle perched himself behind the indulgent dish set. It was over the top, but it suited him. Hermione couldn't imagine his regal mouth licking liver pate from a plastic plate. It would be an atrocity.</p><p>"We'll have to see about setting some better wards. There is no way you are escaping this flat again, Draco Meowfoy."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The last week before the start of the fall term flew by in a series of awkward disappearances behind apartment stairwells. Much to her frustration, not only was she in the same building as Malfoy, but their flats were only four doors apart.</p><p>His presence in her building complicated things. It was hard enough to keep her eyes on her paperwork instead of the proud stance of his shoulders as he stood in front of her blackboard once a year. It was nearly impossible to keep her dead-end crush a secret when she had to pass him in the hallway every day of her life. She didn't even want to think about what would happen if he discovered her Kneazle's embarrassing name.</p><p>At least once the school year started he'd be in the potions dungeon and she on the third floor, so she'd see less of him. Probably. With only three more days until the start of the term, she supposed she would find out soon.</p><p>She had just finished dotting the i's on her syllabus when her stomach rumbled. Meowfoy glared at the sound from his favorite spot, a green velvet cushion on her desk, as if it offended him. Hermione sighed. 1:30 pm was a little late to eat lunch. She'd been so caught up in her paperwork that she hadn't noticed the afternoon slipping by.</p><p>Besides, Draco typically left his apartment around noon, so now should be a safe time to venture out. Meowfoy gave an indignant "meow" as Hermione rose from her chair. She scratched behind his ears, then stuck her nose into the hall to check for pointy-faced blonds.</p><p>Her pathway was clear, all the way down the sun-soaked sidewalk past Honeydukes and The Magical Menagerie. She grinned. Her favorite bakery, The Sword in the Scone, sat on the corner lot, and she could already smell the muffins rising.</p><p>It wasn't only the muffins Hermione loved. The bakery was modern and inviting. Quirky furniture sat around small, octagonal tables and pen-and-ink artwork on the walls.</p><p>The witch behind the had tawny waves that swayed in a way Hermione could only dream of. She waved as Hermione pushed through the front door.</p><p>"Hey, Hermione! The usual?"</p><p>Hermione nodded. She always got the same thing when she came here, which was at least once a week. The Sword in the Scone made the most delectable poppy seed muffins. Their sweet aroma lingered on her tongue hours after the last crumb disappeared.</p><p>The witch grinned at Hermione and placed her muffin into a paper sack along with a package of fish crackers.</p><p>Only once had Hermione returned to her flat without Meowfoy's favorite treat. She thought he'd never know, but that was a mistake--his keen sense of smell picked up on the poppy seeds. He had given her the cold shoulder for an entire week.</p><p>She had just settled into her favorite plastic rocking chair by the corner window when the bell over the door tinkled. Hermione grimaced as the last wizard she wanted to see strode up to the counter.</p><p>There was a potted ball cactus on her table that was not quite large enough for her to shrink behind, but it didn't stop her from trying.</p><p>As Draco bantered with the witch behind the counter, she contemplated shoving the entire muffin into her mouth, grabbing the fish snacks, and high-tailing it out the front door, but the thought of it killed her. These muffins were meant to be savored.</p><p>As Draco turned from the counter holding a silver plate with a scone skewered by a tiny metal sword, Hermione knew she'd been spotted. She could see it in the way his eyes brightened and his feet turned towards her table. She swore into her muffin.</p><p>"Granger? Mind if I sit?"</p><p>He was already scooting one of the rocking chairs out with his foot and placing his plate onto the table.</p><p>"If I say no, will I be vilified by the press?"</p><p>Draco's rocking chair didn't tilt a single centimeter as he placed himself upon it. He smirked at the perfectly-flaky crust of his scone and pulled out the sword. As soon as the blade was free, the sound of trumpets and a disembodied voice tinkled in the air around their table. "He has pulled the sword from the scone," it said. "He is the one true king!"</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "I had one of those once. Never again."</p><p>"What, don't fancy being celebrated?"</p><p>"As if the newspapers don't do plenty of that on their own. I'm surprised you're not sick of it." It seemed like at least once a month that Draco was pictured in some newspaper or another. He always had a high-society witch on his arm—Astoria Greengrass, or Pansy Parkinson.</p><p>Draco pinched the sword between his thumb and forefinger and cut into the scone. His motions were precise, proper, and likely drilled into him from toddlerhood by his aristocratic parents.</p><p>A juicy cherry popped out of the pastry and onto his plate. Hermione's mouth watered.</p><p>It was a shame about the theatrics because the scones were delicious.</p><p>Draco skewered the cherry with the sword and lifted his eyes back to Hermione's.</p><p>He smirked and popped it into his mouth. "Are you sure you won't have a scone?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "I always get the poppyseed."</p><p>"Hmmmmm. You want to know what I think?" He skewered another cherry. "I think you're afraid of a little indulgence. Afraid to give yourself what you really want."</p><p>He stared her down with an intensity that hinted he meant more than cherry scones.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione had just ducked into her flat, narrowly avoiding a certain platinum-blond neighbor, when her floo lit up.</p><p>Harry Potter's face appeared through the ashes. "Hermione? Can I come through?"</p><p>"Go on then. What is it this time?"</p><p>With a whoosh and the soft sound of hands brushing stubborn ashes off of Muggle jeans, Harry stepped into Hermione's living room. "It's about Teddy. Andromeda and I have been wondering—"</p><p>"Oh, Teddy! That's right—he's starting up at Hogwarts this year, isn't he?"</p><p>Harry nodded. "Yes, and—"</p><p>"Oh, I know, I know. You'd like me to keep an eye on him. Take him under my wing?"</p><p>Hermione had always loved Teddy. Ever since the day he was born, and she'd seen him nuzzled into Tonks' arms, she'd known he was a special boy. When he'd first used his metamorphic abilities to impersonate Hermione's wild curls, she'd fallen completely in love.</p><p>She was grateful to Andromeda for allowing Harry to take such an active role as his Godfather. Harry doted on him like the father neither one of them had ever known, and Teddy was a delight to be around.</p><p>In the book of Teddy Lupin was written: adorable, cautious, wistful. The perfect candidate to become a perfect student.</p><p>"I'm so excited. I haven't had nearly enough time for him lately."</p><p>Harry ran his hand through his hair. "That's actually one of the reasons I've—"</p><p>"Oh, of course! You'll want me to keep an extra close watch on him, since he'll be away from home for the first time. Don't worry, Harry. I see this every year. Parents always worry, but most first-years do fine. He'll love Hogwarts."</p><p>"I… ok. Yes. An extra close eye couldn't hurt." Harry glanced at his watch. "I'm sorry, Hermione, but I've got to run back to work. You wouldn't believe how many unexplained explosions there've been this week."</p><p>Harry sped towards the floo and dipped his fingers into the powder box on the mantle. "Just… let me know if you have any trouble?"</p><p>He didn't wait for her reply. With a flash and a bang, he was gone.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione wasn't one to dread the first day of school. As a child, it had always been a new beginning, full of promise and opportunity. Yet, for the first time in her life, nerves bundled in her stomach instead of excitement.</p><p>As the clock switched from 7:59 to 8:00 on Monday morning, the steady thrum of footsteps paced down the corridor. For a moment she worried it was Draco, so she breathed a sigh of relief when a head full of turquoise spikes ducked into her classroom.</p><p>Teddy had a twinkle in his eye, like the one Hermione had seen in his mother's a decade ago. He may have inherited his mother's ability to change his facial features at will, but his shape was all Remus. Tall and lanky, his shoulders carried a world-weariness that battled with the hint of mischief he held in the upturned corner of his mouth.</p><p>Hermione smiled sadly. They would have been proud of him if they could see the boy he had become.</p><p>His friend—Tomás Fuego, according to the roll call—looked like pure trouble. Jet black hair, mismatched eyes (one green, one brown), and a sarcastic smile set off alarm bells in Hermione's head. Over the past five years, she'd developed a bit of an eye for trouble. She hoped, for once in her life, that she was wrong.</p><p>She was not.</p><p>Twenty minutes into class, Teddy shrank into his chair seconds before a set of wet-start fireworks sprang to life in front of the blackboard. She glared as Tomás offered Teddy an overt high-five and a congratulatory grin.</p><p>Hermione had never expected it from Teddy Lupin. Her mental book on him was full of shy smiles and conversations over pistachio ice cream. "Naughty" was a word she had never thought to add to his character profile. And yet, here she was, extinguishing half a dozen explosions that she was 99% sure came straight from the pockets of his robes.</p><p>Tuesday wasn't much better. Teddy watched in awed admiration as Tomas interrupted the introductory discussion every five minutes with sarcastic remarks.</p><p>But today was Wednesday, so things were sure to settle down. Today was going to go better. After all, they were already twenty minutes into class and there had been no explosions yet. Hermione placed her wand on the chalkboard and pointed to a tiny Gryffindor with his hand raised.</p><p>"And so Muggles just… sit there and stare at it?"</p><p>Hermione fixed her face with her most patient expression. "Yes, Mr. Shafiq. The television tells a story on the screen. Think of it as a book come to life. Some works of film are artistic masterpieces, and others are—"</p><p>
  <em>Shhhhhhhiiiiieeeee!</em>
</p><p>A stream of rainbow-colored smoke screamed out of Penny Greengrasses' ears.</p><p>Hermione pinched the bridge of her nose. This could not be happening. She glanced at the door and said a silent prayer that Headmistress McGonagall wouldn't pick this moment to stroll by. The shame of failing, yet again, to keep her students under control crept up her back like a heat rash.</p><p>"Mr. Lupin. Surrender the Raindrops immediately. You know I do not allow Weasley products in my classroom. What's that, the third time this week you've earned detention?"</p><p>Teddy slouched up to Hermione's desk and deposited a fluffy, floating cloud onto her planner. Tiny droplets drizzled all over the first week of September. Merlin help her. Three days into the semester, and it felt like it had been months.</p><p>Tap, tap, tap.</p><p>Hermione's head snapped up to the door. It kept getting better.</p><p>"Special delivery for Professor Granger." Draco Malfoy stood in the doorway, tall and lean and stunning, jiggling a white paper sack.</p><p>Hermione stalked over to him. "Malfoy. Can't you see I'm in the middle of a class?"</p><p>His lips turned up into a smirk. "I can see it's been commandeered by Potter's godson. Really, Granger, have you no knack for classroom management?"</p><p>She snatched the bag from his taunting fingers. "Excuse me. I'll get back to teaching now, if you don't mind."</p><p>His now-empty hand shot out to her shoulder. "Hold on. Don't you want to know why I'm here?"</p><p>"Not particularly." Her teeth ground together so hard they sent spikes of pain through her jaw.</p><p>"Detention partners have been assigned. Looks like it's you and me this year. Unless you want to request a re-draw."</p><p>"As if it isn't enough—" Hermione paused. Headmistress McGonagall's two-teacher detention policy was a good one, but the last thing she needed was more time with Malfoy. This was far too dangerous. She leaned in and dropped her voice low. "We'll discuss this later."</p><p>He leaned in, too, until his eyes were inches from hers. "You can count on it. At 7:00 pm in the Great Hall."</p><p>He slipped away from her and sauntered down the stone corridor without a backward glance.</p><p>"Cheeky little—" Hermione rummaged through his paper bag offering. It held a poppy seed muffin from The Sword in the Scone and a packet of fish-shaped biscuits. Steam rose from the bag and tickled her nose with the scent of almond. Her heart softened as she folded the top of the bag and placed it on her desk.</p><p>Eventually, class was dismissed and the students filed out. Hermione stayed to stare at the confiscated Raindrops on her desk. Should she go to Harry? Maybe Harry would have some insight into his godson's bizarre behavior. He'd helped Andromeda raise him for the past eleven years, hadn't he?</p><p>She remembered his frantic eyes, his anxious tones when he'd stopped by last week. He was already stressed enough about Teddy. She should owl Ginny instead.</p><p>Ginny had such a way of keeping the children in line. She'd know what to do.</p><p>Hermione smiled to herself as she finished her letter and sealed the envelope. Her good mood lasted five whole minutes until a familiar eagle owl dropped a letter onto her desk.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat when she recognized Draco's tidy, spiky hand, but it plummeted when she scanned the contents. She crumpled the letter and tossed it at her wastebasket. "Lenient. Ineffective. Ha!"</p><p>With a grumble, she donned her coat and set off towards the castle.</p><p>Dark clouds covered the stars in the night sky of the Great Hall as Hermione stomped through the staff entrance. It wasn't as if she hadn't been teaching for several years already. Did Malfoy think she was so incompetent that she still hadn't figured out how to manage a classroom?</p><p>And he'd been here, what, five minutes? She imagined him standing at the head of his potions classroom, all the female students batting their eyelashes at him. She snorted. That must be it. They were afraid to disappoint England's most eligible bachelor.</p><p>Well, she wasn't afraid. He was about to hear exactly what she thought of his arrogance.</p><p>Draco was already there, seated at the staff table with a long roll of parchment and an eagle feather quill. He raised his eyebrows at the line of ink that issued from the nub as she neared his throne. "We'll do it your way this time," he said, "but next time it's my turn. Muggle detention methods leave something to be desired."</p><p>"There's nothing wrong with the way I detain."</p><p>"Then pray tell, Granger: why do you have so many repeat offenders?"</p><p>Hermione crossed her arms. "That has nothing to do with—Teddy is just—"</p><p>Draco bobbed his chin in an infuriating nod. "My way next week. Speaking of discipline, have you had any luck containing that Kneazle of yours?"</p><p>"As a matter of fact, Draco—" She swallowed. "...yes. I mean, no. Draco—my cat has stayed in."</p><p>Draco's mouth gaped open, emitting silent befuddlement at her word jumble as Teddy Tonks and Tomás Fuego skidded into the Great Hall.</p><p>As soon as the students arrived, Dracos' mood seemed to shift. His eyes narrowed; his lip curled into his signature sneer. "Detention started three minutes ago."</p><p>"Sorry, Professors." The boys spoke at once, then turned to each other with small smiles.</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips. She wasn't about to let Malfoy commandeer her detention session.</p><p>"Take a seat." She plunked two rolls of parchment onto the Gryffindor table. "I want thirty inches each on what you did wrong, why it was wrong, and what you should have done instead."</p><p>Draco, all long legs and tailored suit, sauntered over from the staff table and loomed over Hermione's shoulder. "What, not on house-elf rights? And I had such high expectations."</p><p>Hermione whirled around to stare him down, but he was too close. All she managed was a tiny squeak of surprise, which achieved exactly the opposite of her desired effect of intimidation.</p><p>His responding snicker made her want to simultaneously slap and snog him. She settled on a half-hearted smack to his bicep.</p><p>If she thought that would remove his smirk, she was dead wrong.</p><p>"Are you flirting with me, Professor? Do I need to assign you detention for breaking a school rule?"</p><p>She jutted her chin despite the heat flooding her face. "Actually, the rule is 'no inter-staff dating.' There is nothing in the policy to prohibit flirting."</p><p>His smirk grew into a full-on grin.</p><p>"Which is not to say I was flirting. I was reprimanding."</p><p>"Mmm-hmmm." His head bobbed in a mocking nod. "Well, if you ever get a reckless streak, you know where to find me. I've never been afraid of a little rule-bending."</p><p>Why was it that he could irritate her so much, and still manage to make her knees weak? She slumped into a chair at the Gryffindor table and lowered her head onto it.</p><p>She needed to get over this stupid crush. He wasn't really flirting—that was just his personality. She was certain that he had no interest in a relationship with a graceless Muggleborn.</p><p>Now if only she could get her heart to listen to her brain.</p><p>The rest of detention dragged by. The scratching of quills on parchment was the only background music to Hermione trying not to sneak glances at Draco's perfect posture.</p><p>Thursday's class went much better, so Hermione's detention methods can't have been that terrible. Sure, Tomás was still sarcastic and Teddy still snickered at his jokes, but not a single thing exploded.</p><p>She couldn't hold back a smug smile as she glanced down the hall and twisted the doorknob to open her flat. It looked like she had beaten Draco home—she wouldn't have to see him if she could slip in—</p><p>But, no. The tinkle of a bell and scurry of paws through the open door spelled her doom.</p><p>"Draco Meowfoy! You naughty thing. You get back here this instant!"</p><p>Whiskers twitched mischievously against the garish carpet as Meowfoy rolled on atop it in front of door "B9."</p><p>"Draco—" She froze as the door swung open to reveal sculpted cheekbones and a single raised eyebrow.</p><p>"You called? Ready for some mischief?"</p><p>Oh, Merlin—he was home—and he had heard her.</p><p>"Erm, yes—I mean no, I'm not—" Deep, steadying breaths. "Are you rubbing catnip on your door?"</p><p>"Catnip." His eyebrow didn't drop a fraction of an inch as he continued his amused scrutiny of her flustered expression.</p><p>Hermione scooped feline Draco off of human Draco's dragonskin boots. That skeptical eyebrow finally fell when a tortoiseshell Kneazle with a coat like a mane pushed her nose around Draco's robes. "Oh, no you don't."</p><p>He nudged the cat back with his foot and slipped out into the hallway, securing the door behind him.</p><p>"That explains it: you have a cat. My cat must have smelled its fur," Hermione said.</p><p>"Yes, and unlike you—"</p><p>"Yes, yes, I know. You know how to keep him in line." Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Her, actually. It's a girl cat."</p><p>"Right. Well, as much as I'd like to stand here, chatting about familiars, I have a Kneazle to contain and papers to grade, so—"</p><p>Draco's snarky smirk was the last thing she saw before she spun on her heel and marched back to apartment B4.</p>
