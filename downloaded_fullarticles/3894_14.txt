    <p>Harry stared at the blond man who stood on Aunt Petunia's lawn. He wore a black jacket, orange pants, with a headband around his head. There was some sort of symbol on the headband, but she didn’t know what it was.</p><p>"Nice to see you again Hari-hime," he said.</p><p>"Nice to meet you for the first time, Mr. Stranger," she said.</p><p>"I'm Naruto Uzumaki, and I'm here to protect you,"</p><p>"Protect yourself, Mr. Uzumaki, I don’t need it,"</p><p>"As you command Hari-hime,"</p><p>Harry watched as the strange man disappeared in a puff of smoke.</p><p>"Goodbye, Mr. Uzumaki,"</p><p>Harry walked into school an hour late, received a warning from her teacher, and spent lunch hidden in the trees. It wasn't until she tried to get down from the tree that her daily routine was once again changed.</p><p>"Ouch!" The sting of an open cut made her hand twinge. She let the old paper bag with her lunch wrappers fall from her bleeding hand. The bag caught on a tree branch and tore down the side as the plastic containers tumbled down.</p><p>"My dinner!" Harry reached for the container, the last of her crackers, with her uninjured hand. Pushing her weight on the lower branch as she strained against the tree. She stretched her arm. Just a little bit more and she could grab the container. It sat on that branch, it was right there. The closer she got to the container the lower her branch sank. As she touched the lid of her cracker container the branch cracked underneath her. She fell with a scream. Ducking her head she braced herself for pain.</p><p> Only the pain never made its appearance. Instead, strong arms caught her mid-fall. Cradled to a warm chest, Harry could only stare at the strange man from this morning.</p><p>"Who are you?" She asked.</p><p>"I told you Hari-hime, I'm Naruto Uzumaki and I'm here to protect you,"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because you're my Sky Hari-hime,"</p><p>"You're strange Mr. Uzumaki,"</p><p>"I know Hari-hime," He laughed. "I know,"</p><p>Mr. Uzumaki ran, faster than a car, to number 4. Setting her on her feet before bandaging her hand and returning her cracker container.</p><p>"Sleep well, Hari-hime,"</p><p>"Sleep well, Mr. Uzumaki,"</p><p>Harry watched as her new...bodyguard?... disappeared into the distance. Why was he so willing to protect her? What language was his first language? Why did he bandage her cut? Would he teach her his language?</p><p>Harry walked into the house, her thoughts drowning out the silence as she crawled into her cupboard. It was odd to have an adult that seemed to care about her life. Would he return tomorrow?</p><p>Harry found he did return. Every morning he'd be on her Aunts lawn waiting for her with a smile.</p><p>"Good morning Hari-hime,"</p><p>"Good morning Mr. Uzumaki,"</p><p>He never followed her to school, at least not that she noticed, but when she was in danger from bullies or traffic or the teachers he showed up. His presence scared off the bullies, he pulled her away from an oncoming car, and he got the abusive teachers fired. How? She had no idea. Why? Because, apparently, she was his 'Sky' and that meant 'Princess' or at least that's what 'hime' meant.</p><p>"I'm not a Princess, Mr. Uzumaki, I'm an orphan,"</p><p>The sad, understanding, and the determined smile he gave at each protest just confused her even more.</p><p>The days went by, Mr. Uzumaki continued to protect her from the various minor challenges of life, and soon it was summer vacation.</p><p>Harry walked around the zoo with her bodyguard. Her ice cream, vanilla and chocolate swirl, in one hand and her map in the other.</p><p>"If I'm this 'Sky' whatever, what are you?" She asked as they walked.</p><p>"I'm the Sun,"</p><p>"I was hoping that would make sense,"</p><p>"It will, just not now,"</p><p>"If not now, then when?"</p><p>"Your birthday," at her obvious disbelief he grinned." I'd explain more but an undead infant would send his army of undead mummies after me,"</p><p>"Right, and I'm a magical girl who'll save the world with my amazing power of love,"</p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how sarcastically she said it when her birthday came around the jinx was set.</p>
