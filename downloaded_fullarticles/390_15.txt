    <p>Dominique Weasley was the second of her family to attend Hogwarts. She never stood out much compared to everyone else. Teddy was himself, ever-changing hair with a cheery personality that made everyone smile, Victoire who was the exact image of their mother in perfect Veela glory, James Sirius and Fred II who were already giving the Marauders a run for their money, Albus who was so wonderfully wonderful, Rose who had Hermione’s brains to be the perfect future student and Louis who was a pretty boy in every meaning of the word. </p><p>	She was just Dom. </p><p>	Nobody called her by her full name. She was smart, smarter than Rose easily, and there was something about her that attracted people to her like a magnet in a way that had her parents not worrying too much about if she would make friends. Dom understood people better than anyone really gave her credit for, especially for an eleven-year-old. If she wanted something, she got it, although it was hardly ever selfish.</p><p> </p><p>	When it came to the bets as to what house she would be in, most people said Ravenclaw. Ron, who she had got into several arguments with over nothing in particular, claimed Gryffindor but she would be a hatstall. Grandma Molly bet Hufflepuff because of how dedicated Dom was to her siblings and cousins and how she would never, ever give up any of their secrets, even if she got in trouble for it. Fleur was the only one who suggested Slytherin. </p><p> </p><p>	And Fleur was the only one who was correct.</p><p> </p><p>	As Dom got onto the train, her sister already leaving her behind with a bag of sweets and a half-hearted good luck, there was only one compartment not completely filled. A girl with jet black hair and peculiarly silver eyes sat in it, accompanied by a pair of twins, both with mousy brown hair and matching cocky grins, another boy with dirty blonde hair already in his school robes and talking excitedly, and a girl with auburn hair smiling politely at the excited boy but looking bored out of her mind. </p><p> </p><p>	“Hi, I’m Dom. Is there a chance that I could squeeze in here?” she asked nervously, leaving out the rest of her name so that they might not recognise her. The only time Dom was uncomfortable with attention was when it was to do with her family’s fame. A group of teenagers and young adults fighting and dying in a war is hardly something you should celebrate.</p><p> </p><p>	“Of course,” the dark-haired girl said, a light accent that Dom didn’t recognise gracing her words. “I’m Kit. The twins are Edgar and Edward.”</p><p> </p><p>	“I’m Ed,” the one with freckles told her, smirking.</p><p> </p><p>	“I’m Eddie,” the one without freckles told her, smirking the exact same way.</p><p> </p><p>	“This is Adam and that is Mellie,” Kit finished, smiling warmly. There was something about the way the girl looked that had Dom enraptured, hanging onto each individual word and causing her to stare as if she were some crazy stalker. “I can move up, so you can sit here, if you would like?”</p><p> </p><p>	“Sure,” she managed to utter, sounding nowhere near as cool as she normally did. The others all seemed nice enough and by the time the trolley full of sweets had arrived they were at ease enough to hold a decent conversation.</p><p> </p><p>	Ed and Eddie were telling a particularly hilarious tale about one of their uncles and a giant duck in the ocean when Teddy dropped by. His hair was its usual sea blue and artfully styled to look just the right level of dishevelled to be attractive. Dom could understand why basically everyone in the school attracted to guys was into him. Mellie and Adam stared at him with open interest, Ed and Eddie managed to be a little more discreet about it and Kit just simply smiled as if he were any other student.</p><p> </p><p>	“Hey, Vic sent me to check on you to make sure you were all settled,” he greeted. “Also, to steal some of your sweets if you have any of the ones that she likes. Uh, hi everyone. I’m Teddy Lupin. Hufflepuff house. We’re the best so I hope you’ll be with me.”</p><p> </p><p>	“Hi,” Adam greeted cheerfully. “My whole family’s been in Hufflepuff, so there’s a good chance that I will be as well.”</p><p> </p><p>	“Here’s hoping,” Teddy told him before turning his attention back to Dom. “Sweets?”</p><p> </p><p>	Dom threw him the bag of sweets she had bought with her sister in mind, knowing all about Victoire’s hidden sweet tooth and knack for stealing sugary goods. Or, at least, convincing other people to steal sugary goods. Dom herself had been quite a willing accomplice in many of the girl’s schemes over the years.</p><p> </p><p>	“Thanks,” he grinned before heading off back down the carriages to where Victoire and their group of friends undoubtedly waited. </p><p> </p><p>	“So, is he like your cousin or something?” Eddie asked curiously once silence settled over them again. Dom shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>	“He’s not a blood relative. He’s my uncle’s godson but he was raised half with his grandma and half with Uncle Harry so he’s practically family anyway. Head over heels for my sister,” she smirked.</p><p> </p><p>	“Is that why he’s collecting sweets for her?” Kit asked.</p><p> </p><p>	“Probably.”</p><p> </p><p>	“What houses do you think you guys will be in?” Adam asked the group, his excitement never-ending. Dom found it be endearing and from the way that Mellie affectionately rolled her eyes, she knew she wasn’t the only one who did so. “I just know I’ll be in Hufflepuff.”</p><p> </p><p>	“Well I suppose it will be very good to have a loyal friend,” Ed teased. “I bet Ravenclaw. Eddie’ll be a Gryffindor. We figured it out when we got our letters, family were very enthusiastic about the whole thing. What about you, Dom? Do your family do House bets as well?”</p><p> </p><p>	“Yep, most of them bet Gryffindor but that’s ‘cause most of them are Gryffindors. Nan thinks I’ll be a Hufflepuff and Uncle Percy thought Ravenclaw. Mum’s French so she didn’t go to Hogwarts and doesn’t really understand the house system. She thinks Slytherin. Mellie?”</p><p> </p><p>	“Probably Hufflepuff like Adam,” she said shyly. “I like to think I’m hard working and I try to be loyal, so I guess it’s a good fit.”</p><p> </p><p>	Adam scoffed at this. “Please, you’ll be a Gryffindor. You’re like the bravest person I know. Everyone back home thinks so. Kit, you’ve not said anything.”</p><p> </p><p>	“I’m not from a wizarding family, I don’t really understand the way that students are sorted. The teachers mentioned something about traits and hatstalls?”</p><p> </p><p>	Yet again, Dom was transfixed by the girl and still could not place where her accent could be from, no matter how hard she tried. Luckily, Adam saved her by launching into a long explanation of the history of the houses, how the sorting hat worked, what traits the houses typically had and the usual stereotypes of each house. It was interesting enough, and it definitely fascinated Kit in a way that made Dom think she’d fit in Ravenclaw. It was as if she absorbed every bit of information the others said just for the slightest chance it could be important later. And still somehow managed to come off as the coolest person Dom had ever seen. </p><p> </p><p>	Some people were just so perfect, she thought.</p><p> </p><p>	As the train pulled into Hogsmeade, Adam started pestering them to get into their school robes ready for arrival. They all turned around to give the other half privacy and checked each other over to find several missed buttons and that Mellie somehow managed to go eleven years without learning how to tie a tie which Eddie found hilarious before teaching her very patiently how to do it. The train was pulled to a stop by the time that everyone was ready and the group kept bursting into giggles over the tiniest things.</p><p> </p><p>	Hagrid, a huge shadow in the mist, was calling all of the first years over to him. She grinned at the familiar figure and made her way to the boats, Mellie and Kit following close behind as the boys gazed up at the huge man. It was three to a boat so they split in half, girls in one and boys in another, to travel across the Great Lake. Dom forced herself not to tell the others about the giant squid that lived there. </p><p> </p><p>	“Are you excited?” Mellie asked, peering ahead and trying to see the castle.</p><p>	“I suppose,” Dom replied, lost in her own thoughts. “It’s a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest. Don’t you think?”</p><p>	“I’m nervous,” Kit agreed. In this light, her eyes almost appeared to glow on their own and it made their unnatural colour seem even stranger. “Do you think any of us will be in the same houses?”</p><p>	“I suppose statistically we would be,” Mellie answered. “But I don’t know who we would be with, or who else we might have in our houses.”</p><p>	The trio were silent even when they rejoined the boys and entered into the hall. Dom saw Victoire at the Ravenclaw table, smiling proudly at her, and Teddy sat at the Hufflepuff table far less maturely and was waving excitedly. She didn’t understand how the two of them could be in a relationship when they were both so obviously different to each other. But then again, she didn’t understand how most people could be in a relationship.</p><p>	The names began to be called.</p><p>	Mellie, Mellie Becker, was called up first of their group and placed almost immediately in Hufflepuff. Teddy drowned out the majority of his house when he cheered and made sure there was room for her on the bench. The twins were called up next, Ed and Eddie Creek, with Eddie being sorted into Ravenclaw and Ed in Gryffindor, the reverse of what they had predicted. Then it was Kit. Greyson was an odd name for a wizarding family, although Kit had said she wasn’t from a wizarding family so that question was answered. She was also sorted into Ravenclaw. Then Dom was called up.</p><p>	“Dominique Weasley,” Professor McGonagall called out and whispers broke out among the hall. A lot of people turned to stare at Victoire and Teddy who were the only ones of their family currently attending the school. Dom walked over to the stool where the hat was promptly placed on her head.</p><p>	“Another Weasley,” the hat said. “Well, you are an interesting one from the rest. I believe I sorted all of the previous generation into Gryffindor. This generation appears to be a little more … diverse in your traits now. And you got rid of that ridiculous red hair, I mean really, where else could I sort you all? But I see where you fit, clear as day.”</p><p>	“Slytherin!” the hat called out and for a brief moment that hall was silent. The Slytherin table clapped and cheered but the whispers could still be heard over it and even some of them were questioning the hat’s choice. Victoire looked confused and then grinned and Teddy clapped as loud as he would have done had she been sorted into Hufflepuff with him. </p><p>	At least it was an interesting start to her school life.</p>
