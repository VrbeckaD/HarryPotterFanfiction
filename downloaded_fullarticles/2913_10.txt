    <p>The Evanses, of number twelve, Longdown Drive, were perfectly normal, always had been. They were the last people you’d expect to have anything out of the ordinary in their household, mainly because, they were the most ordinary family in all of the UK.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>William Evans was a millwright at Bridgewater Mill, a paper mill located in the industrial town of Cokeworth, England. He was a tall, balding man, with sandy blonde hair and large, square glasses. Rose Evans was thin and short and had flaming orange hair, and a nose dusted with freckles. The Evanses had two daughters, Lily and Petunia, and Rose spent most of her time at home, looking after the two of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The Evanses were a content family of four, who lived everyone’s typical definition of a normal life, in an ordinary house, and worked ordinary jobs. They lived in a middle-class house, had a middle-class car, and lived their middle-class lives. No one would ever think that there was anything peculiar or out of the ordinary going on in their household, because they were just the Evanses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The girls had been the best of friends growing up, playing in the park down Spinner’s End, chasing each other in the yard, and riding their bicycles through the fields of Cokeworth, ignoring the thick, smog of the factories. They were entirely content with their lives, laughing together, and going to school, until they weren’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Lily Evans had always been ordinary, that’s what she remembered growing up. She and her older sister Petunia had braided each other’s hair, and read books to one another, and helped their mother plant flowers in the garden. She had gone to school and gotten excellent grades, and she had spent most of her free time holed up in her room, nose buried in a book, or playing make believe in the park with Petunia. She had done very little in her life that could be considered daring, or rebellious in any way, shape, or form. There had never been a sign in her life that she was anything but ordinary, at least, not that she had noticed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rose and William Evans, however, had noticed something out of the ordinary about Lily. It wasn’t something they could explain, nor was it something they entertained for longer than a few minutes. But they had noticed odd things happening, only when Lily was around.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When she was six, and Lily had been helping her mother in the garden, they had planted lilies, petunias, and roses, per Lily’s request. All of which had different growing conditions, and lilies were supposed to be planted in the autumn, but to Lily’s insistence, they had planted all three. Her mother had tried to explain they they wouldn’t all survive, given that it was spring, and they lived in an industrial town full of smog, and the garden got little sunlight. But Lily had insisted that they plant all three, and she was absolutely positive that they would grow. To Rose Evans’ surprise, the next afternoon when she went out to the garden to water their flowers, a bed full of prospering roses, lilies, and petunias lay before her, only a day after they had been planted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When she was seven, and Lily had suddenly decided that she didn’t like peas, they had magically disappeared from the counter. One minute the dish was there on the counter, and the next it was just gone, poof, no longer in sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then there was the time when she was eight, and Petunia had been taunting Lily. It hadn’t been in a mean way, she was only teasing. But Petunia had sprouted up over the summer, and was now at least a head taller than Lily, and she <em>always </em>reminded her of it. One afternoon she had been holding a jar of lollies above Lily’s head, taunting her that she couldn’t reach them, and then, just like that, the jar exploded, and the lollies went flying across the kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They were weird things, little things, always when Lily was angry, or sad, or scared. Things that didn’t make sense, things they couldn’t explain. Usually they caused confusion, sometimes chaos, and they would be the topic of conversation for a few minutes, until inevitably, the girls lost interest, and the entire ordeal would be forgotten about. But Rose and William Evans had always wondered what was causing these strange occurrences. They often wrote them off as freak accidents, or coincidence that they happened when Lily was around. But there was always a little voice in the back of Rose Evans’ mind, telling her it was something else entirely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>And so, on the dull, grey Thursday that it was discovered that Lily Evans wasn’t in fact ordinary after all, everything suddenly made so much more sense. Every incident, every occurrence, every little puzzle piece of Lily Evans’ life suddenly became clear, and it was all because of a boy who lived down Spinner’s End.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Severus Snape was an unpleasant boy, by anyone’s definition. He did nothing but read books, and study herbs and plants. He sulked about, and spent most of his time wandering the streets of Cokeworth. He had long, greasy black hair that hung in curtains around his face, and dull, grey eyes with very little behind them. He had been unhappy for longer than he could remember.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>With parents that paid little attention to him, and spent most of their time fighting with one another, Severus Snape had spent most of his life alone. He had very little in common with the other boys that lived in Cokeworth, and anyone his parents knew, had no children, or had children that didn’t like him. It was because of this, that he spent most of his time alone. Until he met a ginger-haired girl in a park down Spinner’s End.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was on a particularly dreary day that she first met the black haired boy that told her what she was. She was sitting in the grass, in a field of flowers by the swing set when she saw him. It was late fall, nearing the end of October, and she had been playing with the petals of a wilted daisy that sat amongst the flowers surrounding her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He entered the park, looking scared and frightened, and took a seat on one of the swings opposite her. She saw the sad look on his face, so disheartened and alone, and she felt sorry for him. His shoulders were slumped, and his hair hung around his face in curtains, limp and dull. He reminded her a bit of the daisy she was holding onto, limp and sallow. She wished she could make him feel better, make him happy, give him life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That’s when it happened, the flower in her hand, began to spring back to life. The petals began to unfurl, and the green returned to the stem. It was as if it were being reborn, rebirthed. <em>It was like magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>It was then that the boy looked up from his place on the swing set and first noticed the girl on fire, in a field of wilted daisies. Her hair was like an inferno of curls, and her eyes as green as the evergreen trees that surrounded her. She looked like the sun, he thought, so full of warmth and light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was then that he noticed the flower in her hand, and the flowers that surrounded her on the ground, all alight with life, and swaying in the breeze. Around them, lay a field of wilted daisies, each looking more diminished than the last in the late autumn bite. But the ones surrounding her, the ones touching her skin, each was alive with passion. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He knew what she was the moment he saw the flowers. He knew she was like him. Just as special, just as unique, just as extraordinary. Except, perhaps she was so much more than he. She emanated life, exuded passion, burst with ferocity. He thought that if the sun were a person, it would be her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He on the other hand, was nothing of the same. Sure, he had abilities, ones that normal children didn’t. He could do things that most people, not even full grown adults, could. But it wasn’t the same as it was with her. She emanated life, whereas he brought death. When he was angry, he could bring ruin to whole things at once. He could take down buildings, or envelope fields in fire. He could destroy anything he wished, without so much as a blink of an eye. Perhaps that was why he was so drawn to her, the idea of life, the idea of light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You know, it takes a special kind of person to be able to do that to daisies,” he said to her, calling from his place on the swings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She looked up at him suddenly, shocked that he had spoken to her. She obviously hadn’t expected him to say anything. He looked afraid, of what she didn’t know. Perhaps her, perhaps something else entirely. But every emotion he held was displayed on his face as he stared at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked at once, eyes darting around her at the flowers that touched her skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Haven’t you ever done something you couldn’t explain?” he asked, standing up and walking towards her. “Made something explode, lit something on fire, made something disappear when you were angry, or scared?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She thought about it for a moment, and realized that she had. Not in so much detail. But she remembered her mother wondering how the flowers they had planted had sprouted up over night, and she remembered making a glass jar of lollies explode when Petunia had held them out of her reach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re special, you know?” he said to her, taking a seat beside her in the flowers. The ones that she had previously brought back to life wilted as they touched his skin. “Ordinary people can’t bring flowers back to life.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m nothing special, I’m only ordinary,” Lily told the boy, unsure if she should be frightened of him or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Believe me, you’re not ordinary.” He sighed, taking the flower from her hands and watching it wilt at his touch. “Just like I am not ordinary. I can do things that normal people can’t, and you can too, you know? I’m Severus.”</p><p>“Lily,” she introduced, smiling warmly at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Lily.” He laughed. “It fits.” He gestured towards the flowers. “You’re a witch, Lily.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was this day, really, that everything changed in the Evans’ household, and in Lily Evans life. Because now, she wasn’t just an ordinary girl, she wasn’t living just an ordinary life, and she wasn’t living in an ordinary world. Now, there was a whole other part of her, a whole other universe that she knew nothing about. But she knew she was going to be a part of it, whether she wanted to or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Severus Snape, as it turned out, was the start of that other world. Because the day they met in the park down Spinner’s End at the age of nine, the day he told her what she really was, was the day her life changed forever. It was the day they became best friends, the day she really entered this whole other world, and from that point forwards, nothing could tear the two of them apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>After that cold, grey Thursday, Lily spent almost all of her free time with Severus Snape. They sat in the park, looking through all of the books Severus brought Lily about his world, about her world, their world. She went over to his house, and although she was terrified of his parents, she never wanted to leave. Because even though his parents were always arguing, and paid little attention to Severus or her, it was a magical household, and it proved that the world she now knew she belonged to, existed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Lily spent hours pouring over books that Severus had leant her, learning as much as she could about the magical community, absorbing as much as she could about Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and dreaming of the day when she could one day attend it. She supposed, that was where her relationship with Petunia turned sour. And years later, looking back on it, she supposed it was mainly her fault.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Growing up, Petunia had been more ordinary than any person could possibly have been. She read books, she played with friends, she did her homework. Nothing she had ever done could be considered out of the ordinary, or interesting in the slightest. She was thin and bony, with a plain face, and an even plainer personality, and she was proud of it. Petunia liked being ordinary, she liked fitting in. It gave her a sense of belonging, and for the longest time, so had Lily. But now, Lily was not ordinary at all, not in the slightest. </p><p>She still loved Petunia, and her parents, of course she did. She had just been so enveloped in this new world, one she was now apart of, that she had almost left her other world behind. The more time she spent with Severus, the more time she spent nose-deep in books about magical maladies, the less time she spent with Petunia, and it showed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Gone were the days of her and Petunia playing in the yard, gone were the days of them braiding each other’s hair, and gone were the days of the sisters laughing and helping their mother in the garden. Before long, Petunia not only began to resent the world Lily was now apart of, but she began to resent Lily as well.</p><p>The day that Lily got her Hogwarts letter had been the breaking point. Her parents had been so proud to have a witch in the family. They thought it was the most marvellous thing in the entire world, and Lily couldn’t ever remember a time when she had been so excited. But the moment that tawny owl swooped in through the kitchen window and dropped the letter in her lap, that had been the moment her and Petunia’s relationship had been forever ruined. Because now, it was certain that Lily would no longer be a part of their world, not in a way that counted anyways. And so, from that day forward, the only words exchanged between the two sisters were when Petunia would call Lily a freak under her breath or when their parents weren’t around, and it had broken Lily’s heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Severus had told Lily all about Hogwarts. It was where he would be attending school, just like his mother had, just like all witches and wizards in Britain did. He had told her on hundreds of occasions that she would get her letter, that she would go to school with him in the fall. It was funny, really, because Lily knew she was a witch. The moment Severus had told her, she knew that he wasn’t lying, she knew it was the truth. But still, there was always this feeling that maybe she wasn’t, that maybe the whole thing was just some dream she had made up in her head, and that maybe Severus didn’t really even exist. But the minute that owl flew into her kitchen, the minute she opened that letter, she knew. She knew this was who she was, and that this was where she was meant to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Severus had taken her to Diagon Alley with her family a week later, and for a moment, she was sure she was dreaming, she was sure that the place didn’t really exist. It was unlike anything she had ever experienced before. Sure, Severus had told her all about it. He had told her about Gringotts, the wizarding bank, and about Flourish and Blotts, and Ollivander’s. He had told her about Quidditch, and racing brooms, and about Eeyelops Owl Emporium. But seeing it up close for the first time, that was something entirely different altogether. The fact that an entire community, so unique, so wonderful, so magical, existed within the inside of London was absolutely mind-boggling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>All her life, she had felt ordinary. She had felt plain, normal, boring. But the moment she first stepped into the wizarding world, the moment she first held that 10 1/4” wand of willow, that was the first time in her life she ever felt like she belonged. It was like every question, every irregularlity, every unknown quantity in her life was answered with one look at that alley, and she had never been more grateful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
