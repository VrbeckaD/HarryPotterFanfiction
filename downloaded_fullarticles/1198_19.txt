    <p>The Death Eaters who patrolled the grounds of the castle south of Dorchester could all plaintively observe the more than passing similarity between their Dark Lord’s present base of operations and Hogwarts castle. It was generally accepted however that acknowledgement of this similarity would not be the smartest idea. Besides its physical similarity however, the dark castle lacked many of the amenities that the Death Eaters had grown accustomed too over the course of their schooling. Never was that more evident than on the chilly fall nights as the wind blew in from the channel a portent of the long winter yet to come. No amount of warming spells could counteract the biting gusts that tore through the long drafty halls and given that the dark lord appeared un-phased by the assault of nature, none of his peons were terribly eager to approach him with the matter. For as bad as conditions became and as despised as the Death Eaters may have been throughout the vast majority of the Wizarding world, above all else the Death Eaters feared their master.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The wizards and witches who served the Dark Lord were primarily divided into three groups. There were those who had accompanied him on his rise to power having taken it upon themselves to align themselves with the power of the talented child whom they had known at school only to be caught up in the rush of his ascent unable to get off the ride. There were those who recognized the inevitability of his ascent and aligned themselves with that which horrified them rather than lie in the piles of corpses he left in his wake. They bided their time and did what they were told lest they suffer the inevitable consequences. Then there were the crazy ones, the ones who had aligned themselves with the chaos he had created and relished in the feral release they were now free to unleash on those they saw as lesser life forms. They were the ones who became the Dark Lord’s most loyal lieutenants as patrons of the fear that drove more allies to their cause and more enemies into hiding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then there was Severus Snape. A boy who hadn’t actively aligned himself with the Dark Lord’s allies during his time at school, nor display any reluctance in his affiliation. Indeed Severus Snape did not display much of anything, as the Dark Lord’s most trusted spy he went wheresoever he liked and did whatever was necessary. Never any more or less than that necessity operating with uncaring efficiency leaving his peers to fear, hate and be wary of the menacing presence that trailed behind the greasy dark young man. Snape was an unknown, and the type of people who bet on the rise of dictatorial madmen did not like unknown factors.</p><p>Snape’s appearance at the castle was announced with a telltale snap moments before his form bled out of the darkness striding through the entrance unbothered with a hurried even gleeful step into the innermost sanctums of the fortress. As he tore threw the abandoned halls those few Death Eaters lurking in the castle noticed his usually pristine hair, robes, and demeanor were disheveled and uncouth. It was generally agreed in the days following that the spy had acquired information, good news that would lead to the end of the war, and then?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The Dark Lord Vanished.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>On the morning of July 30th Neville Longbottom awoke in a cold sweat from a dream he couldn’t remember into a room he wished he could forget. Any thought of the dream was wiped from his mind at the realization that sometime during the night he had turned eleven years old. Sitting up in bed he tried to distinguish some revelation or change as a product of his eleventh birthday but as he sat rubbing the lightning scar on his forehead, he was beset from the banality of what he felt should have been an earth shattering occasion. The scar marked his contribution to the annals of history as the reflection of an assassination attempted by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named that by anyones analysis should not have been able to be reflected. Neville wasn’t a particularly special boy and nothing about his short pudgy frame hastily lined with baby fat suggested that he would have been capable of performing one of the most curious, impossible, and important feats in magical history. If it weren’t for the bolt on his forehead he truly could have been anyone or no one. His legacy however inspired attention and with a reputation comes responsibilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Neville delayed leaving his bedroom as long as possible tidying his already immaculate living space and making up his bed repeatedly till he could no longer find any reason or fault to continue. Neville knew his gran would be waiting for him downstairs and knew from experience that delaying the start of the day would only cause more problems than it could ever solve. Nonetheless the start of the day was never any easier, and given the significance of the this day in particular, his grandmother was sure to make even more of a fuss than usual.</p><p>At the top of the stairs of the stately old manor which Neville called home, hung a photo of his parents blown up to enormous proportions by his grandmother following their deaths. As they loomed over him staring down august with with knowing grins on their faces waving playfully, they forever rested trapped in a state of unknowing. The couple in the photo, one heavily pregnant, could never know the horror that was awaiting them. They would never know that their child would grow up an orphan. They would never know the legacy which they would leave behind and yet in the photo they stood brave anyways, careless and happy. Neville was once again reminded of his own inability to live up to that careless not-knowing. They were amongst the finest aurors of their generation regularly staring down death in the defense of strangers, while here stood Neville terrified at the prospect of facing a handful of well wishers.</p><p>“Ah Neville, finally awake.” Neville jumped, startled out of his reverie. “Come and start the day already so we can begin to prepare for your reception tonight.” Neville’s grandmother had managed to come up behind him without his noticing. The austere woman aged prematurely towered over him already prepared for guests with her gray hair pulled tightly back dressed in stately mauve dress robes.</p><p>As Neville extricated himself from his parents place of prominence, what else could he say other than “Yes, Gran.” As he followed in her wake down the stairs. The kitchen had been laid out already and a plate eggs and bacon had been laid out for him enshrined under a mound of gifts and parcels. Neville blushed with embarrassment and tried to peck at his breakfast without disturbing the mound, but found the affair much more difficult than it had any right to be.</p><p>“Happy Birthday by the way,” Gran noted as she walked by hoovering absently with her wand out in front of her “Go ahead and started chipping away at that mound so we can tidy up that table. It would be terribly tacky to leave out such a display for the guests.” Neville started taking a bundle off the top of the pile.</p><p>“I went ahead and ordered everything you’ll be needing from your Hogwarts letter,” gran mentioned casually, “So I’m sure you may find some of your school things mixed in as well.”</p><p>“But I thought, weren’t we going to go out for my things later? Won’t I still need to get a wand?”</p><p>“Ah, I’m sure you’ll see I have that more than covered.” Gran peeked at him over her shoulder with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. As Neville looked back at the pile he saw there was indeed a long slender box resting at a center point of the various assortment of boxes. Hesitantly he slid it over and carefully unwrapped it to find the embossing of Ollivander’s maker of fine wands on its top. A sign he had admired in passing for years whenever out with his grandmother shopping and running errands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>So many stories he had heard of young wizards unwittingly enacting magical feats as they grew up; when his own moment never seemed to come, Neville frequently wondered whether he had any magic in him at all. No one seemed particularly bothered by this besides himself, after all Neville Longbottom the boy who lived, the baby who by some strange magic had defeated he-who-must-not-be-named as an infant, a squib? What a ridiculous thought. And so it was as he grew no one seemed to notice the absence that weighed heavily on his young mind. Ollivander’s represented an escape from that. A fine wand channelled all the power of a wizard or witch to bring their will into the world. Neville was certain that when a wand chose him all of his worries and fears would be assuaged with verifiable proof of his validity. Or alternatively in a worst case scenario he could still finally place the matter to rest before going off to live with the muggles having fulfilled his duty to the wizarding world at just three months old.</p><p>Everything Neville had heard up to this point seemed to suggest that the wand chose the wizard as opposed to the other way around forcing him to wonder how his grandmother could possibly have picked out a wand in his stead. With much trepidation he slid open the box. Inside was an old wand battered beyond belief and indeed nearly broken clean in two held together by splinters and good intentions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It was your fathers wand.” Intoned Neville’s gran almost on cue “He died with it in his hand facing down You-Know-Who to protect you in his final moments.” There was a slight catch in her voice as she relayed the story for what must have been the thousandth time that Neville could remember.</p><p>“Um, it’s really nice gran but is there any chance that I could, y’know…” Looking up Neville knew he shouldn’t have even tried.</p><p>“Are you embarrassed by your parents sacrifice?”</p><p>“No gran its just-”</p><p>“Just what? Most people would be grateful, honoured even to be allowed even to touch such a significant wand in the history of wizardom! Yet you want to replace it with some second rate street magician’s stick?”</p><p>“I’m sorry” Neville mumbled staring down into his lap.</p><p>“As you well should be. Shame on you for dismissing your legacy, you’ll make a proper fool of yourself at Hogwarts with that attitude. Now go on, give it a wave for us.”</p><p>Neville carefully pulled the wand from its velvet casing. It sagged even more without the support. Being careful not to snap it from the force of movement, Neville slowly dragged it through the air in front of him allowing the stick to feebly emit red and gold sparks in sporadic bursts along its path. At least he hoped they were sparks as they might as well just have been stirred up dust motes catching the sunlight shining in through the wide kitchen window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Oblivious Gran clapped giddily with joy. “Oh wonderful wonderful, We’ll make a fine wizard out of you yet child. Now we’ll take care of the rest of these later,” She said vanishing the rest of Neville’s assorted gifts with a wave of her wand. “There’s so much left to do and hardly any time to do it. Now you go on and dust the drawing room while I finish up preparing lunch. There are some very important people coming to wish you well Neville and you’d do best to justify their courtesy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Looking longingly at where his breakfast had once been, vanished along with his gifts to who-knows-where, Neville pushed back his chair and moved to get to work. </p>
