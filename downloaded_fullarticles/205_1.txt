  <span>When I woke up, the first thing I was aware of was my pounding head and that I wasn't in my cupboard anymore. Realizing this I bolted onto my feet and took a look at the surrounding meadow? My body protested the quick movement and suddenly I was in severe pain, much more so than before. Taking a glance at my body I became aware of two concerning things, I was practically naked wearing only Dudley's old oversized shirt and my body looked more blue and purple than anything else. I wasn't very surprised as the day before I woke here Uncle Vernon had given me a good beating and then he did something he had never done before, he touched my penis and made me touch his. After this “session” all I remember is wishing for a safe place and then I woke up here. Now I wish I knew what and where this place was. Taking a more In-depth look I could see what looked like a lake? Big pond? All I knew was that where there is water, generally there are people there.  </span>

  <span>What seemed like a short distance took me half-an-hour to get to the paved path surrounding the water. I took the paved path as a good thing because it must mean it is some sort of social area and I will come across at least one person with a phone. Another half-an-hour later I came across a group of which looked like it consisted of a mom, dad, and three kids. Now came the hard part, due to my lovely relative's barley feeding me I looked tiny when people saw me they would more likely believe that I was 5 rather than my actual age of 9. Since I looked so young they would probably not believe me and call the police. I would just have to use puppy eyes and hope for the best. It couldn't be that hard… Right?</span>

  <span>It was not easy and now I sat in the back of a police cruiser as Officer dickhead, sorry Officer Setter discussed with his partner Officer Jade which way to the hospital they should take. You may be wondering </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Harry, why are you being so disrespectful about the police officer”</span>
  </em>
  <span> because he frickin laughed at me when I told him I was 9 and said I quote “Nice try little one”. Dick move my friend you have made yourself an enemy. Officer Jade turned around 10 minutes into our ride and asked me a heart-stopping question “So when did you arrive in America” I WAS IN AMERICA, Officer Jade continued to ask “do you know where we can find your family” I just sat silently contemplating those questions myself and wondering what was going to happen to me now.  </span>

  <span>We arrived at the hospital and I was quickly led to the children's ward. The nurses quickly took Dudley's blood-stained shirt off of me and just stared in horror at the scars and other injuries on me. Getting over their fright they quickly brought me into another room where they did scans of my body and found out that I had a broken arm, bruised ribs, and a concussion. Hours later I found myself lying in an actual bed with a cast on my arm and my ribs in a brace making it impossible to bend my torso. At this point, I just wanted to sleep but two new people walked into my room all I could do was sigh. “Hello Harry I am sure you must be quite scared my name is Kyla and I am a CPS worker, we just want to take a swab of your cheek to see if you have any relatives in our system so we can find out where you are meant to be” the other worker continued for her “this will be painless but we need your permission for it” after giving my consent they took a swab and quickly left and that is how a few hours later I found myself in front of Stark Tower.  </span>
