    <p>Remus was paid under the table by one of the ministry of magic's greatest Auror Madeye Moody. Remus was better than many greatest aurors, he had quick reflexes and sharp wits at battle. The pair Madeye with his mad eye and Remus with his speed and sensitivity to smell were unbeatable duo. He went out to a battle while Sirius was waiting for him at home. Sirius being Black was needed to show his face in public as a allie of the ministry. He was home late, and still was waiting for Remus. It was early in the morning when Remus came home to Sirius sleeping in the couch half way of cutting paper clips. Remus was very weak with fighting, travelling and especially with full moon round the corner. He had hot shower and finished leftovers. His blonde hair now almost brown with water dripping off his edges on his back now completely cold. He picked all the papers, and put it aside. Sirius half opened his eyes, and gave Remus a smile that warmed up Remus immensely… very fast. Sirius sat up and hugged standing Remus.</p><p> "You are late." Hummed Sirius.<br/>
"Let's go to bed Paddy." Said Remus bending and taking a long breathe in filling with Sirius odor. He was home. They snuggled cherishing each moment as last. Remus finally broke off the hug and nudged to the bed room. </p><p>Despite being tired Remus was awake, his hand playing with Sirius hair and looking at roof reflecting the sky outside. Sirius too was awake lying on Remus's chest feeling the uneven scared tissue. Then Sirius froze, his eyes staring at nothing. The sleepy happy comfort zone was gone from his face. He was consumed by fear that there might be a day when Remus wouldn't come home. There could be time when he could no longer hold Remus. There could be a day when he will be all alone. His eyes were filled with tears. He then shiftes his weight to his fore arm and looked at Remus. Remus moved his eyes from roof to Sirius still managing playing with Sirius hair. "What is it Padfoot?"</p><p>“By how much did you miss the curse moony?” Sirius didn't want to know, but he has to know.<br/>
"I'm here Padfoot. I'm home. Come on let's sleep." </p><p>"Moony! How many times was curse about to hit you?", This time Sirius was in mood that can be compared to a black fire, so fearce so hot that it could burn down anything but it's doesn't give light. It was almost dementor like praying on it's own fear. With the intensity Sirius projected, Remus understood there was no hiding, he knew, Sirius somehow knew, “Four times, nearest one went past between my ear and shoulder.”</p><p>Hell broke loose in Sirius mind. Remus could have died four times. It was a miracle that Sirius was holding him, that he was able to feel the warmth of him, his touch, his existence, his love. Everything he loved could have been collapsed. All these thoughts pushed Sirius into a panic attack. Remus understood what Sirius was thinking, he would have thought same if it was Sirius who escaped death curse. By four times. He held Sirius who was breathing fast against his chest wispering that he was home, he was alive. It was after two hours that Sirius calmed down. Both of them are facing each other , Sirus tracing scars on Remus face, his jaw  line, ear with his head on Remus's arm while Remus was  holding Sirius close by waist with his other arm.<br/>
“Moony…”<br/>
“umm…”<br/>
“Moony…!”<br/>
“Yes Sirius.”<br/>
"Lils invited us over for dinner tomor- today. And to be early for lunch as well." Remus finally laughed with a little chuckle and pulled Sirius into a hug. "Let's do that Padfoot, let's do that." </p><p>Sirius broke the hug and started kissing Remus ever so slowly and lightly as if he was something fragile, physically. Remus responded to the kiss, just feeling the lips of Sirius's over his which once made his heart run like a free warewolf now put him to sleep.<br/>
Sirius smiled seeing that Moony fell asleep while kissing and made a mental note to taunt him later over this. Sirius finally slept close to Remus not before deciding that he needs to spend time with Remus, because you never know.</p>
