    <p>Harry's fourth year was uneventful, for Snape anyway.  This year however couldn't have started any worse.  Harry couldn't keep his disrespectful mouth shut, could he?  And Harry wonders why Snape couldn't give him the respect he felt he earned when the precious Mr. Potter couldn't be bothered to say "sir", then snidely turned the correction into open disrespect.  Snape gave him detention of course only to be circumvented by Headmaster and Slughorn.  So he sent a student with a message for Harry to serve his detention on a school night.  Snape wasn't feeling it though.  However Harry arrived and was determined to be as contrite as ever, as he had brought protective gloves even when told not to.  Snape pretended not to notice and waved his hand at the containers of flobber worms.  "I assume you know what to do Mr. Potter."  Harry glanced at him and nodded.  Snape sighed internally walking out of the room and proceeded to his office.  </p>
<p>Snape rummaged through some books and parchments on a shelf on one of his bookcases.  He found some blank parchments.  He took one and walked over to his desk.  Snape dipped his quill in the ink well with deliberate care.  At the top edge he wrote in beautiful calligraphy "Resignation".  Snape dipped his quill in a second time, twirling it to remove excess ink.  On the parchment under Resignation, he wrote "Severus Snape".  On the bottom he wrote "Effective Oct 31, 1995."  Snape left it out to dry by air.  Snape rose from his chair, pushing up with tired arms and a still sore arse from Harry popping him into a desk less than a week ago.  </p>
<p>Snape walked to another cabinet and removed the concealment charm.  He reached inside for the decanter of brandy.  He didn't much care for firewhisky, only drinking it when there was nothing else, like the Order meetings.  Snape poured himself a stiff drink, sank into one of the chairs in front of his desk and twirled the drink in his hand.  He wondered if he needed to resign from the Order or simply quit showing up.  Snape downed his drink in three gulps.  Hopefully a slight buzz would kick in for him to take a short nap. He shouldn't let his head drift to the back of the chair.<br/>
************************************************************<br/>
Damn!  Harry thought.  Where the bleep-bleepidy-bleep bloody hell did f***ing Snape go?!  It was farking 11p!  Snape should have dismissed him an hour ago.  Harry washed the cauldron, deliberately leaving it somewhat dirty, daring Snape to give him more detention.  Screw this!  Harry walked to Snape's office, and yep a candle was lit, and yep the door was open.  Harry stopped himself just short of pounding on it.  Instead he peered around it.  Snape's black hair draped down the back of the chair drew him in the room.  Harry stepped in quietly.  The crease between Snape's eyes didn't seem so deep in sleep.  Harry looked around.  There were books everywhere.  Even stacked on the floor.  Harry covered his mouth and backed up a few steps stifling a laugh.  Sooo Snape, he thought.  Harry turned to look around, intending to leave in just a minuet and hopefully old git wouldn't wake up.  Skirting around Snape's desk he saw the ornate handwriting.  Once Harry was finished reading the words for the third time he couldn't help the sense of glee possessing him.   Oct 31st was only three weeks away.  He couldn't wait to tell his mates!  Harry snuck out as fast as he could.</p>
<p>Snape roused more or less fully awake after midnight.  He was aware when Harry had been in his office earlier but he hadn't felt like waking up fully.  Snape remembered his penned resignation.  It'll probably be common knowledge by noon meal he imagined.  Snape walked to the classroom and did inspect the caldron Harry had used the night before.  His mouth screwed up in frustration.  He set it in the sink meant for washing as well as a few more that needed soaking.  He conjured hot soapy water and filled the sink until all the cauldrons were submerged.  Snape walked back to his office and carefully rolled up the parchment on his desk.  He took off his professors robe and hung it up.  Once in his rooms Snape shimmied out of his clothes except for his boxers.  He conjured a hearty fire and slipped under the comforter.  For once sleep came easily.<br/>
****************************************************<br/>
At breakfast Harry couldn't squeal out his news fast enough.  Ron was happy.  Hermione looked put out.  It was a Saturday.  Ron couldn't wait to get on with quidditch practice.  First the team would know.  By mid-day meal the whole school would know Hermione surmised.  She wondered if the staff would throw him a going-away party.  After thinking about it he probably wouldn't want that.  She looked  over at the head table.  Of course he wasn't there.  "See you guys later."  Her two best friends barely noticed her leaving.<br/>
****************************************************<br/>
The summons came much too early than it should have.  "Tea at 4p" read the "invitation" from Headmaster.  Snape rolled his eyes.  He was in the middle of making a batch of wolfsbane.  At about 5 minuets til Snape turned off the cauldrons and then cast a stasis charm around the whole works.  He took off his lab apron and hung it up.  At the door he put on his frock and summoned the rolled parchment of his resignation to his hand.  He tucked it in his sleeve next to his wand.  He made the trek up to the Headmasters office.  The doors opened to allow him entrance.  "Severus, do sit down.  Tea?"  For once Snape accepted.  He took a few sips politely, then set down the cup.  "I've heard a rumor today," Dumbledore stated.  Severus interlaced his fingers.  He waited, but Headmaster was not forthcoming.  Severus stood and withdrew the parchment from his sleeve.  He stepped forward and held it for Headmaster to take.  Once it was in Headmaster's hands, Severus folded his, left over right in front of himself.  Headmaster glanced up at Snape, then unrolled the parchment.  "I see.  It wasn't a rumor."  "Good news travels fast," Snape intoned dryly.  Albus got up and walked around his desk.  Snape cast his eyes down and remained still.</p>
<p>"Severus..." Albus pleaded, "this is unusual.  The school term has barely started.  Who will teach them?"  "You might be able to persuade Slughorn to come out of retirement."  "Is there anything I can say?  What can I do?"  "Make Potter an exchange student at Durmstrang?"  Albus chuckled.  "Severus... why?"  "Oh, let me count the ways, a three-headed dog bite, a werewolf slap, countless exploding cauldrons, stolen ingredients, knocked unconscious in the shack, stolen wand, dragonballs vomit on my shoes, an unbreakable vow, (Bellatrix makes my skin crawl being in the same room), open disrespect daily, escaped mad prisoners, dark flight to 12 Grimwald Place, you know what dark flight does to me..."  Albus chuckled.  "I see your point, Severus."  Snape was quiet a moment.  "I imagine you do, Albus.  The difference is you can stand being in the same room with him."</p>
<p>Both men turned to lean against the front of the Headmasters desk.  "If you should find someone to take the position before Oct 31st, I'll be happy to vacate at once."  "I'll do my best, Severus, but I do wish you'd reconsider."</p>
<p>**********************************************************************************<br/>
Monday Oct 16th, Horace Slughorn took over as potions master.  Snape went through his collection of books and managed to stick with only taking 100.  He sent an owl to Albus that the remainder he would donate to the school.  On the 18th the last wolfsbane he would make, at least for a while, he delivered to Lupin's office along with the potion written in exquisite calligraphy on old fashioned parchment with his notes in the margins.  Healing salves that work on magical creatures he delivered in a rucksack on Hagrid's doorstep on the 19th.  Dozens of healing draughts and dreamless sleep potions delivered to the infirmary wing in the evening of the 20th.  Before Snape retired for the evening he hung up his professors robe in his office for the last time.  He shrank and pocketed his personal pensieve. He exited his office and locked the door.</p>
<p>On Saturday the 21st, Snape apparated to Godric's Hollow.  He conjured a beautiful perfect star lily and placed it beneath Lily's name on the tombstone she shared with her husband.  "Lily, I won't be here on the 31st.  Rest in peace, sweet lady."  He stood in respectful silence a long, long time.</p>
<p>Sunday Oct 22 Snape sat in the dark in his rooms and poured a strong drink.  At 11:45 he locked the door to his rooms and his lab and class room.  He then made the long trek up to the owlery.  He hung the old fashioned skeleton keys around a strong owl with instructions to take them to Headmaster.  Snape made his decent then, back down to the great hall.  The doors opened to let him exit.</p>
<p>"Fare thee well, Professor."  "Take care of your charges, Sir Nicholas.  Keep them safe."  "Until your return, Sir Snape."  Snape turned to face the corporal apparition.  "Come again?" he asked.  "You know young man, in my day a Knight was asked to accept certain vows.  One vow is to acknowledge and keep faith to fellow members of the chivalry code.  When accepting your professorship you were asked to protect the *children first* within these walls.  I believe you have done so to the best of your ability and I believe will heed the call again in future.  I think Hogwarts herself rather embraces you as her Dark Knight."  Snape raised an eyebrow at the pompous arse, but couldn't help ghosting him with that quirky lip curl. "As a member of the fealty a Knight may grant title to a deserving man.  Hogwarts doors will always open to welcome you home Sir Snape, Dark Knight of Hogwarts!"  "Well then, how can I refuse?"  Knowing full well the cheesiness of it all, Snape knelt to his left knee and bowed his head.  Bugger it all, it was just him and the dead anyway.  It's not likely the living would accept the proclamation of a dead man. It did lift Snape's black heart a tiny bit to indulge the lost-the-plot nutter.  Snape felt old.  He used his hands to help push himself up.  He turned to face the night.</p>
<p>With a running start Snape used a black spell to transform himself and took flight.  The black trail of smoke disappeared into the night.  Snape knew he was leaving early, though he had told Dumbledore he would if given the opportunity.  In truth he didn't want to deal with the goodbye's.  When he landed in a field near Spinners End he said to himself, "Coward".</p>
