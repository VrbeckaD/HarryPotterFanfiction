    <p>Remus and Sirius were holding hands. Their hands, usually not clasped together, were in fact clasped together. While Remus usually held his book with two hands when reading, this time, he was using one hand. His other hand was holding the hand of Sirius Black. James blinked. <br/>'Ahem' He coughed. <br/>His hand holding best friends didn't stir. <br/>He coughed again, louder this time. <br/>Remus' thumb was now- seemingly absent mindedly- stroking Sirius' hand. Which he was still holding. <br/>James coughed several times. Which then caused him to choke slightly. Meaning he was now in the midst of an actual coughing fit and his bloody traitorous, secret keeping, hand holding best friends STILL didn't look at him. Although Sirius was now smirking rather more than he had been earlier. <br/>'Blimey James, are you ok?' Peter looked up from his charms work. <br/>James waved his hand dismissively at Peter, still coughing. Holding his chest, he pointed at the hands of their two other best friends. <br/>'What?' Said Peter in a bemused tone. <br/>'Peter-' Said James hoarsely, regaining his ability to speak. 'Peter, they're holding hands.' <br/>'Yes.' Said Peter. 'I can see that. You're the one who needs glasses, not me.'<br/>'But-' Stuttered James, 'WE don't hold hands!'<br/>Sirius had begun to laugh, slightly ruining the masquerade of ignoring James that he and Remus had been maintaining so well. <br/>'No James,' Said Peter seriously. 'Would you like us to?' <br/>Sirius sputtered. <br/>'NO, I... Oh for the love of god, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, WHAT IS GOING ON?!' <br/>At that, Sirius finally dropped Remus' hand in order to bend over laughing and Remus set down his book, without a completely straight face himself. Soon, Peter was overcome too and James found himself more confused than ever. <br/>Several minutes later, Sirius wiped his eyes and turned to James. <br/>'Sorry mate, you're just so... so.. ' <br/>'Oblivious?' Supplied Remus. <br/>'Dim-witted?' Offered Peter. <br/>'Both of those.' Grinned Sirius, leaning back and reclaiming Remus' hand. <br/>'Right. Yes. Sorry, what?' James stared at his best friend. <br/>'Go on.' Sirius said. 'Ask all your questions. I'll be sure to respond in slow, simple tones. For your health.' <br/>'Why are you holding hands?' <br/>'Cause we like it.' <br/>'Sirius,' Remus chided at the look of murder on James' face. 'Be nice.' <br/>'Oh, you're no fun Moony. Fine. Because we're together.' <br/>'Together.' Repeated James slowly. <br/>'Yes Jamesy boy. Together. Boyfriends. Dating. Like you and I, but slightly gayer' <br/>'If that's even possible.' Muttered Remus. <br/>'Dating?' James said. <br/>'Yes Prongs,' said Sirius with exaggerated slowness. 'Going out. Partners. More than friends. Holding hands and everything.' He held up their entwined hands. 'I don't know how many more ways I can say it mate.' <br/>James looked at Remus accusingly, whose smile became slightly worried. <br/>'Since when?' He demanded. <br/>'Well... officially, maybe a week or so?' Remus said weakly. <br/>'A WEEK? A WHOLE WEEK? SEVEN DAYS?' <br/>'That is the generally agreed length of a week, yes.' Sirius grinned again- infuriatingly, in James' opinion. <br/>'Sirius Black.' He pointed a warning finger at the boy. 'I am OUTRAGED.' <br/>'James.' Peter stood up somewhat shakily. 'If you're going to be mean, I- I won't stand for it you know! I er... um, I'll.. It's fine for them to be together, so you, um... You-' <br/>James cut off Peter's illegible but somewhat sweet stuttering. 'I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE GAY! THEY COULD BE SHAGGING DUMBLEDORE FOR ALL I CARE!' <br/>That set Sirius off again, who hadn't quite recovered from his last set of hysterics. Remus grimaced at the image but had to laugh at James' puce face. <br/>James sat down. 'Why didn't you bloody tell me? Did you think I was some sort of homophobic arsehole or something? I mean I know I'm arrogant, and I can be a bit of a dick, but I-' <br/>'James.' Cut in Sirius, looking slightly more serious at his best friends rather dejected face. 'We didn't tell you because it was funny as hell.' <br/>'What!?' James said incredulously. <br/>'No offence mate, but you really are totally oblivious.' Sirius continued hurriedly. 'I mean, I've been flirting with him for years, trying to crack that 'Woe is me, I'm a monster' wall and we've been holding hands for like, EVER-' <br/>'For a couple of weeks or so.' Interjected Remus, smiling at his boyfriend's exaggerations . <br/>'I think I even kissed him in front of you once, and James, you can't honestly think that we've been needing the bathroom at the exact same time for the past 3 months <br/>can you?' Sirius finished, ignoring Remus' interruption. <br/>'3 months?' James protested. 'Moony said it was a week!' <br/>'Yeah well, it took us a while to work up to the official boyfriend label.' Sirius smirked, 'but obviously, dating or not, Moony couldn't keep his hands off me.' <br/>James sat back in his chair and turned to Peter. <br/>'You knew?' He asked <br/>Peter shrugged apologetically. <br/>'Yeah, 'cause he has eyes. Look, I'm sorry mate. It's not like we didn't trust you. We just didn't want a huge thing about it. Well, moony didn't. I was all for a dramatic reveal. But I'm an excellent and considerate boyfriend, so we kept it low key. And honestly, it was bloody hilarious, watching you just completely miss every hint I dropped.' <br/>'Well.'' James said resignedly 'Well then. I guess congrats. And good luck.' <br/>'Good luck?' Enquired Sirius. <br/>'Not you Padfoot,' James cracked a grin at last. 'Good luck to moony. He'll need the patience of a saint to deal with your high maintenance arse.'  <br/>Sirius opened his mouth to protest, but with a look from his boyfriend- he couldn't get enough of that word- he sat back and grinned at his hilarious, idiotic best friend. Remus' hand was warm in his and the scent of chocolate was settled around them. He was happy.</p>
