          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco has always had trouble sleeping. When he was an infant he kept his mother up all night long, wailing until his voice gave out. The older he got the worse it became. At Hogwarts he would stay in the common room until the early hours of the morning, getting a head start on assignments or reading Quidditch biographies. He could’ve taken sleep potions but he didn’t like the way they made him feel, disoriented and discombobulated. But now, lying in bed, his head on Harry’s chest, listening to the rhythm of Harry’s heart as it beats, sleep comes easily.</p></div>
