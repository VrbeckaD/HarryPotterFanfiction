    <p>Pain exploded in Harry’s scar. It was by far the worst he’d ever experienced. Instinctively, his hands went to cover it, as if that would somehow lessen the pain, and he realized belatedly that his wand had slipped from his fingers in the process.</p><p>“Cedric…” he gasped out, although his voice was so weak he doubted the older boy could hear him, “I’m sorry…I don’t think I’ll be able to…to give you any help with this one.”</p><p>A high, cold voice cut through Harry’s mental fog. “Kill the spare.”</p><p>“<em>Ava</em>—” a second voice began, but it cut off with a gasp almost immediately.</p><p>Cedric wasted no time. “<em>Stupefy</em>!”</p><p>Harry heard a muffled thump as the would-be murderer hit the ground, and then the pain in his scar faded away.</p><p>“Harry?” Cedric asked, worry creeping into his tone.</p><p>Harry scooped up his wand from where it had fallen and quickly got to his feet, scanning the vicinity for other potential threats. Almost immediately, his eyes landed on a swirl of blue-white magic spiralling up out of the ground directly on the opposite side of them from where their attacker had approached. <em>That must’ve been why he hesitated,</em> Harry thought. <em>He saw the beginnings of this and didn’t know what to make of it.</em></p><p>Harry and Cedric watched in amazement as the swirl of magic slowly faded away, revealing a woman wearing an extravagant ballgown the same blue-white color as the swirl of magic that had brought her there. Her face was framed by a legion of silky blonde curls, which were themselves topped by an elaborate gem-encrusted tiara. In one hand, she held a gleaming silver pole almost as long as she was tall with an intricately bejewelled tip that reminded Harry of the toy wands that came with muggle Hallowe’en costumes. Her other hand held a battered, leather-bound volume that looked entirely out of place with the woman’s glamourous outfit.</p><p>The woman began moving to brandish the pole at them but then stopped and looked around in confusion.</p><p>“Can we help you?” Cedric asked uncertainly.</p><p>“Well,” the woman said, peering intently at her book, “if I translated this thing correctly, the spell I just cast was supposed to either tell me that none of my friends were in danger or, if one of them was, transport me to the location of the one in the most danger, but…I don’t think I know either of you.”</p><p>Harry and Cedric looked at each other, and Cedric shrugged and shook his head, conveying to Harry that he’d never heard of a spell with that effect before.</p><p>The woman’s expression became thoughtful. “Unless…I don’t suppose one of you has a diary that you write in, and then a few days later someone else writes back to you?”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened. “No, but my mother does.”</p><p>Harry had had a brief freak-out about his adoptive mother’s interactive journal after the whole mess with young Voldemort’s diary in his second year, but they had taken the journal to the Ministry to be examined when he got home that summer, and the Ministry curse-breakers assured them that the only spell on the journal was a Protean Charm linking it with an identical journal somewhere else. Apparently, the woman standing before them was the owner of that other journal.</p><p>The woman looked at him thoughtfully. “You know, now that you mention it, I do recall my pen pal saying something about having a son. What was it, Henry?”</p><p>“Harry,” he corrected.</p><p>“Harry!” the woman repeated. “Sorry about that. I knew it was something along those lines.”</p><p>“That’s quite alright,” Harry assured her.</p><p>The woman pursed her lips and looked around. “Where are we, anyway? Somewhere in the Vinkus?”</p><p>Harry froze.</p><p>“Frankly, we’re not entirely certain where we are,” Cedric admitted, “although I must confess I don’t know where the…Vinkus, did you say?”</p><p>Seeing the woman nod, Cedric continued, “I don’t know where that is, either.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Harry had finally recovered from his shock at the woman’s question. “You’re Ozian,” he said in disbelief.</p><p>The woman looked at him in confusion. “You’re not?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “My parents are—well, technically adoptive parents, but anyhow, they are, but I’m not, and neither’s he,” he finished with a gesture at Cedric.</p><p>The woman was shocked. “Are we—are we even in Oz at all, then?”</p><p>“Doubtful,” Harry replied.</p><p>The woman hummed. “Well, then maybe while I’m here, I can help you two unlostify yourselves.”</p><p>Cedric looked at Harry, the question clear in his eyes. <em>Unlostify?</em></p><p>Harry’s brow furrowed, a suspicion as to the woman’s identity beginning to form in his mind.</p><p>“Do you know which direction you’re going?” the woman asked.</p><p>Cedric motioned the woman closer, then laid his wand flat on his palm and incanted, “<em>Locare</em> Hogwarts.”</p><p>The wand spun on his palm until it was pointing in a vaguely northwesterly direction.</p><p>“Alright, the two of you gather close,” the woman told them, “and let me know when we’re almost there!”</p><p>Harry and Cedric moved together until they and the woman were all standing within a foot or two of each other. With a wave of the woman’s wand—and Harry was certain now that the long pole she carried was a wand of some sort—the three of them were encased in a translucent bubble that then lifted them off the ground and began to float through the air in the direction Cedric’s wand had indicated.</p><p>The soft glow from the bubble’s surface gave Harry enough light to confirm his suspicion. “Glinda Upland?”</p><p>She nodded. “Although almost no one calls me Upland anymore. Ever since that stupid ‘Glinda the Good’ propaganda campaign, it’s like people think ‘the Good’ is my last name.”</p><p>The woman—Glinda—turned to Cedric. “Any idea how far away we are?”</p><p>Cedric shook his head. “It’ll probably be a while. The portkey that brought us out here seemed like it took us a pretty good distance.”</p><p>“Well, then, since it sounds like we’ve got some time to kill,” Glinda said, turning to Harry, “why don’t you tell me a little about your mother? She hasn’t really talked that much about herself in our writings.”</p><p>Harry looked at her appraisingly. “I take it you haven’t talked that much about yourself, either.”</p><p>She smiled sheepishly. “Well, it’s…like I alluded to earlier. Everyone in Oz is so caught up in all the ‘Glinda the Good’ propaganda Horrible Morrible put out all those years ago that it’s almost impossible to find anyone I can talk to as just Glinda. Not since…”</p><p>Glinda’s voice trailed off, and she squeezed her eyes shut in an attempt to fight back tears. After a long moment, she continued, “It was so refreshing being able to talk to someone who would treat me as a normal person that I didn’t want to ruin it for myself by letting on that I was the vaunted Glinda the Good.”</p><p>Suddenly, she frowned and looked at him. “Wait, are you…saying this is someone I would know?”</p><p>Harry nodded but said nothing more, curious whether she would be able to puzzle it out on her own.</p><p>Glinda bit her lip and began to think out loud. “But who do I know that’s left Oz? The Wizard? No, you said it was your mother I’d been writing with.”</p><p>After a moment, she shook her head. “The only other person I can think of is the little girl who was in that house Morrible dropped on Nessa, but I wouldn’t really say I know her. I can’t even remember her name.”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “I guess my father was right all those years ago.”</p><p>Screwing up his voice into the best imitation of his father he could muster, Harry looked Glinda directly in the eye and said, “People are so empty-headed they’ll believe anything!”</p><p>The bubble’s forward motion jolted to a sudden halt, nearly causing its occupants to lose their balance and fall. For a brief moment, Harry was worried the bubble might collapse and send them plummeting to the ground below, but it held firm.</p><p>Glinda was staring at Harry in open-mouthed shock. “You can’t possibly be implying what I think you’re implying.”</p><p>Harry grinned mischievously. “Oh, I assure you, Miss <em>Ga</em>linda, that’s exactly what I’m implying.”</p><p>Glinda’s arms went for the surface of the bubble, and she slowly lowered herself to a seated position. “How…?”</p><p>“Trap door,” Harry replied easily.</p><p>“But…the…the Time Dragon Clock said…” Glinda muttered to herself in disbelief.</p><p>“Wait,” Cedric interrupted. “Wait a minute. Wait a minute. <em>What</em> are you two <em>on</em> about?”</p><p>“She and my mother were dormmates,” Harry explained. “My mother was a political dissident who was eventually forced to fake her own death and flee the country along with my father. Glinda here was unwittingly turned into a figurehead for the discriminatory policies of the administration in power at the time and didn’t realize she was on the wrong side until it was too late.”</p><p>Turning to Glinda, he added, “And as for the Time Dragon Clock, I really don’t know enough about how the thing works to speak authoritatively, but <em>clearly</em> it was somehow fooled. Whether my mother had to actively do something to fool it or it was just fooled on its own, I don’t know, but if you’re that curious, you can ask her when we get to Hogwarts.”</p><p>That seemed to bring Glinda back to reality, at least to some extent, as the bubble slowly began moving once more.</p><p>“Do you…do you have a picture of them?” Glinda asked.</p><p>Harry nodded, bringing it out of his pocket and handing it to her. Tears welled up in her eyes once more, and, in a voice barely above a whisper, she spoke her friend’s name aloud for the first time since her supposed death. “Elphie…”</p><p>Glinda looked up from the photo and smiled. “She…she found a way to degreenify herself.”</p><p>“Well, not entirely,” Harry told her. “She uses a glamour to hide it, but her actual skin is still green underneath the glamour.”</p><p>“Still, she must be thrilled to have a way to at least appear normal,” Glinda replied.</p><p>“Not as thrilled as she was when the healers at St. Mungo’s found a way to reverse her partial transfiguration of my father,” Harry responded.</p><p>“Wait, I thought spells were irreversible once cast,” Glinda said in confusion.</p><p>Harry looked at her as if she’d suddenly sprouted a second head. “No, who told you <em>that</em>?”</p><p>Glinda’s expression darkened. “Morrible,” she spat the name as if it were a curse.</p><p>“The number-two woman in the administration that forced my mother into exile,” Harry said for Cedric’s benefit.</p><p>“She probably said it just to make Elphie hate herself even more for having been tricked into casting that spell on the monkeys,” Glinda fumed.</p><p>“Well, she lied,” Harry responded.</p><p>Suddenly, Glinda’s expression seemed to brighten a little. “Do you know how they got here from Oz? If they were able to help Fiyero here, maybe they can do something for Biq!”</p><p>Harry looked at her in confusion. “Who?”</p><p>“The munchkin boy Elphie accidentally turned to tin trying to save him after Nessa bespelled his heart,” Glinda said.</p><p>Realization struck Harry. “Oh, you mean Boq!”</p><p>Glinda shrugged. “Something along those lines.”</p><p>Harry just shook his head and chuckled. “My mother did say you were pants at remembering names.”</p><p>Glinda’s attention returned to the photograph. “Who’s this with you?”</p><p>“Sirius Black,” Harry told her. “My godfather. For the longest time, everyone thought he was the one who betrayed my birth parents’ location to the Dark Lord who killed them, but it came out at the end of last year that he’d been framed. Once we found that out, my mother was able to engage a solicitor on his behalf and get him his day in court, which he’d somehow never had initially due to a clerical error. That picture was taken outside the courtroom just after he was officially declared innocent.”</p><p>Glinda’s eyes widened. “A Dark Lord?”</p><p>Harry nodded. “It’s a bit of a long story…”</p>
<hr/><p>The scene at Hogwarts was chaos. The Triwizard Cup was supposed to have been a portkey that would deliver the victorious champion to the judges’ stand to be presented with the prize money, but when it activated, the two Hogwarts champions were nowhere to be found.</p><p>The Krums and Delacours had gone to wait outside the medical tent for word on the conditions of Viktor and Fleur, respectively. Elphaba, Fiyero, Sirius, and Cedric’s parents, meanwhile, had gone down to the judges’ stand in search of answers.</p><p>“I don’t understand how they could both be missing!” Amos Diggory said hotly.</p><p>“If they both grabbed the cup at the same instant, whether by chance or through planning, they both would have been taken by the portkey,” Dumbledore explained.</p><p>“Alright, well if we assume that’s the case, they were tied on points entering the Task, so we can’t use that as a tiebreaker,” Ludo Bagman said.</p><p>“There are people <em>missing</em>, you insensitive twat!” Sirius thundered. “Maybe we can try to <em>find them</em> before we worry about the result of a stupid tournament?”</p><p>“I’ve already called out an Auror forensics team to trace the portkey’s destination,” Minister Fudge replied imperiously. “They should be arriving any moment now.”</p><p>At this point, the steadily growing murmur in the spectators’ stands reached a level at which those down on the judges’ stand could hear it. Looking over at the spectators’ stands, they saw several in the crowd pointing to the southern sky. Following the spectators’ pointing with their eyes, they saw a glowing ball of light that stuck out like a sore thumb against the blackness of the night sky. As it grew closer, they could begin to make out the outlines of human forms inside the ball.</p><p>Fiyero’s jaw was hanging wide open as he looked from Elphaba to the ball of light and back again. “Is that…?”</p><p>“No…it can’t be…” Elphaba breathed.</p><p>But it was. The bubble landed right in the centre of the judges’ stand and dissolved into nothingness. Harry and Cedric were immediately dragged away to be interrogated by the judges about what had happened since their disappearance. Cedric’s parents followed closely behind, as did Sirius, leaving the three Ozians staring dumbly at one another.</p><p>It was Elphaba who finally broke the silence. “Glinda…”</p><p>Glinda found herself fighting back tears once more. Seeing the photograph was one thing, but having Elphaba actually standing in front of her, living and breathing and whole and <em>real</em>…Glinda felt her throat close up as she was overcome by emotion, and the only response she could offer was to pull her friend into a fierce hug and hold on tight.</p><p>The two women were still hugging when Harry returned several minutes later. Seeing his approach over Glinda’s shoulder, Elphaba reluctantly released one arm and pivoted so she and Glinda could both face Harry.</p><p>“You alright, Harry?” Fiyero asked.</p><p>Harry sighed. “It’s ridiculous. Cedric and I just got kidnapped by forces unknown, who were about to <em>kill</em> one of us until they got distracted by Glinda’s timely arrival—and did I ever thank you for that?”</p><p>“Always happy to help,” Glinda said with a smile.</p><p>“—but Sirius and Professor Dumbledore are the only ones who actually seem to care about any of that. The rest just want to know who won the bloody Tournament,” Harry finished huffily.</p><p>“Good grief!” Fiyero declared emphatically. “Get your priorities straight, people!”</p><p>“What I want to know is—and Glinda, not that I’m not happy to see you again, but—how?” Elphaba asked.</p><p>Harry went over and picked up Glinda’s book, which she had dropped in going to embrace Elphaba. “I’m guessing this.”</p><p>Elphaba’s eyes widened. “The Grimmerie.”</p><p>Glinda nodded. “See, the thing is, the spell I used was to take me to the location of whichever of my friends was in the most danger, and I didn’t realize that was going to take me out of Oz entirely—”</p><p>“—and you don’t know how to get back,” Elphaba interrupted.</p><p>Glinda nodded again.</p><p>“Well, you’re welcome to stay with us until you figure out a way back,” Fiyero offered.</p><p>“And it’s good to hear you still consider me a friend even after all these years,” Elphaba said with a fond smile.</p><p>“Actually, there’s a little more to it than that,” Harry put in.</p><p>Elphaba looked at him with a mix of surprise and confusion.</p><p>Motioning from Elphaba to Glinda with a broad grin, Harry said, “Meet your pen pal.”</p><p>Elphaba turned to Glinda in shock. “<em>You’re</em> the one who owns the other journal? Oh, Glinda, if I’d known it was you—”</p><p>Glinda cut her off by pulling her into an embrace. “Yeah, I could say the same thing. It was just so nice being able to talk to someone who wasn’t starstruck by all the propaganda—”</p><p>“And I was pretty sure whoever I was communicating with was Ozian, so I didn’t want to let on anything that might allow them to figure out I was the so-called ‘Wicked Witch,’” Elphaba replied.</p><p>Harry did his best to school his features into a sagacious expression and said, “As Professor Dumbledore told me once, it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Don’t beat yourselves up over what you could have done or would have done under different circumstances; just make the most of it now that you do know.”</p><p>Glinda looked over at Harry and then back at Elphaba, one corner of her mouth twisting into a wry smile. “Smart kid.”</p><p>“If you think he’s smart, you ought to see his girlfriend,” Fiyero said.</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “For the last time, Hermione is <em>not</em> my girlfriend! She’s more like a sister to me than anything else!”</p><p>“<em>Sure</em> she is,” Fiyero teased.</p><p>Harry shot him a withering glare.</p><p>“Glinda, while you’re here, we ought to get you to Ollivanders for a wand,” Elphaba said.</p><p>“I already have a wand!” Glinda protested, picking it up from where she had dropped it and holding it up so Elphaba could see.</p><p>“Not like ours,” Elphaba replied, reaching into her cloak and withdrawing her own wand.</p><p>Unlike Glinda’s, which was long enough to double as a melee weapon if need be, Elphaba’s wand was so short it would be nearly impossible to use two-handed, and its tip was devoid of any sort of ornamentation.</p><p>Glinda suppressed a chuckle. “It’s black.”</p><p>Elphaba grinned. “Ebony with a dragon heartstring core, thirteen and a half inches long. And Glinda, it’s amazing how much my magic has stabilised since I started using this wand. It’s—I can actually get my spells to work correctly now instead of going haywire.”</p><p>“Well, I can certainly see how a wand that size would be a lot easier to carry around,” Glinda remarked.</p><p>“Does that mean you’re interested?” Elphaba asked hopefully.</p><p>Glinda looked at her for a moment and then burst out laughing.</p><p>Elphaba looked hurt. “What?”</p><p>“Sorry,” Glinda said once she had collected herself. “It’s just…now I think I know how you must’ve felt when I decided to give you a makeover after the party at the Ozdust.”</p><p>Elphaba’s eyebrows shot nearly up to her hairline. “Am I really being that bad about this?”</p><p>“Well, no, but…” Glinda’s voice trailed off, and she went in for another hug. “I missed you, Elphie.”</p><p>“I missed you, too, Glinda,” Elphaba replied.</p><p>“You know,” Glinda said after a long moment, “if not for all my stuff being back in Oz, I’d be half-tempted to just stay here permanently.”</p><p>“I may be able to help you with that if you want,” Harry offered.</p><p>The two witches turned to face him and saw him looking at a page in the Grimmerie with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>“You can read it?” Glinda asked in surprise.</p><p>“It’s in parsel,” Harry replied by way of explanation. Turning the Grimmerie around so Glinda could see it, he pointed at a spot about halfway down the left-hand page and said, “The accompanying commentary says the spell was originally crafted as a means for recovering stolen property, but there’s nothing there to indicate it wouldn’t work for just bringing your things to you from another location even if they’ve not been stolen.”</p><p>Glinda bit her lip in thought. “Since you seem to be able to read it so naturally, I don’t suppose there’s any way you can be the one to cast the spell?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “It’s your things we’re trying to retrieve, so you’ve got to be the one to cast it. There may be a way I can help you, though. May I enter your mind?”</p><p>Glinda tilted her head in confusion. “What, you mean like telepathically?”</p><p>“Well, we call it Legilimency here, but essentially, yes,” Harry replied.</p><p>Glinda nodded determinedly. “What do you need me to do?”</p><p>“Clear your mind as much as possible and then look me in the eye,” Harry instructed.</p><p>When she had done so, Harry took a deep breath and entered her mind. <em>Can you hear me?</em></p><p><em>Whoa!</em> Glinda sent back, clearly startled. <em>Oz, that’s weird.</em></p><p><em>Wand ready?</em> Harry asked.</p><p><em>Ready,</em> Glinda confirmed.</p><p><em>Alright, I’ll speak the words into your mind; I just need you to repeat them out loud,</em> Harry told her. <em>There’ll be a little bit of wandwork required; I’ll send you an image of what you need to do when you need to do it.</em></p><p>Fiyero and Elphaba watched with undisguised curiosity as Glinda began to speak in a series of low hisses. After about thirty seconds of this, her hissing grew louder, and she swung her wand in a circle above her head three times before pointing it directly in front of her.</p><p>Harry exited her mind and scurried clear as a bluish-white swirl of magic, similar to the one in which Glinda herself had arrived but much larger, began to spiral up out of the ground in front of Glinda’s wand. When the swirl dissipated, it left behind two wardrobes and several chests of drawers. Glinda immediately rushed forward and began going through them to make sure everything was there.</p><p>It was at about this time that Sirius returned. “What’d I miss?”</p><p>“I hope you won’t mind us having another houseguest, at least for the time being,” Harry said.</p><p>“Who, that beautiful young lady over there?” Sirius asked, waggling his eyebrows suggestively as he motioned at Glinda.</p><p>“Mind out of the gutter, Padfoot,” Harry said warningly.</p><p>Sirius pouted. “You never let me have any fun.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Glinda’s head and torso emerged from one of the wardrobes with a familiar object clutched to her chest. “Remember this, Elphie?”</p><p>A surprised smile crossed Elphaba’s features. “My hat!”</p>
