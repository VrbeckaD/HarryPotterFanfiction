    <p>
  <span>For the next two years of The Interhouse Marders schooling Crowley, Aziraphale, Severus, and the other adults managed to find the seven horgexes and destroyed Voldomoret( And if the Demons realized that a certain Headmaster was late for his due. Well Minerva worked better than he did) Thus that summer of 2007( the year that Dumbs got dragged to hell) was spent Between, Waterloo, Tadfield, Soho, and Grimaled Place. That was until what everyone called the Ghosts showed.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Laurence, Goerge, Sherlock and Mycroft had where staying together if not for the fact that the three half Timelords could feel something was about to happen. Fred was with Victor in Bulgaria but what was about to take place was something more then any of them could have thought of.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laurence looked outside the window and mumbled to himself," Planet Earth. This is where I was born."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somewhere in space, Rose Tyler counited," And this is where I died. For the first nineteen years of my life, nothing happened. Nothing at all. Not ever. And then I met a man called the Doctor."</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Laurence called his father the first time that it happened. The first time the ghosts showed up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Dad... have you seen them?" Laurence asked. Jack Harkness nodded," Yeah, I've seen them you have communicated with them have you?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No... It's a lot harder to keep Georgie away from them but no..." Laurence said before asking," Any luck finding Pa?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"None... the hand hasn't gone off... you?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The Professor saw him this march... or was it April? Hold on Sherlock was with him... so ya March." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sherlock groaned from the other side of the room," Two months away and still nothing interesting! How douse Mycroft do it? How do you do it?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laurence rolled his eyes as George cast a tickling hex on Sherlock and said," better?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"NO!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laurence huffed," I am on the phone, you two!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jack laughed from his side( Suzie Costello looked at him in surprise but said nothing else) before asking," Try calling him alright. Who knows maby this will bring him here?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laurence smiled," On it... Tell Owen thanks for the birthday present ya?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Will do son..." Jack replied as they hung up. Laurence then looked to Sherlock who asked," Got that communicate from your mum?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Kitchen..." Sherlock mumbled before sighing," I am going to check out the morge at Barts. Might be something interesting going there." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laurence sighed," Lestrade called. Something about those robbers and A Red-Headed League?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh! Brilliant don't wait up! Or do!" Sherlock said as he rushed out. Laurence pulled out the communicator and dialled his other father.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>"Hollo?" The Doctor answered from his TARDIS. Rose was in her room sleeping off their last adventure( there were in 2012 at the time) when the phone rang. To his pleasant surprise, it was his son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So you picked up this time..." Laurence said. The Doctor looked the screen and frowned," Laurence... how are calling."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The Professor gave Sherlock a communicator for his birthday. Only works with your's and her's TARDIS. Funny how that works. Now... There's some timey-wimey stuff happing here and it's got Torchwood one written all over it." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Doctor frowned," What year?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"2007, Summer. There are ghosts and, Pa... they look like your tales of Cybermen."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tha...That's not possible," The Doctor said but Laurance sighed," Afiard it is... you haven't been in a different universe lately have you?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Doctor almost dropped the phone but he picked it up," Laurance... tell me you haven't been talking to them?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am not an idiot, Pa. I haven't. Kept Sherlock from doing the same as well as George. But I am scared... My friend Harry, he sees his parents. And Moine sees her biological father, it scares me because why do they see them. And I see the Cybermen?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Laurance... meet me at the park near the Tyler flat... Bring whichever of your friend that you can. We'll figure this out... I promise you." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll hold you to that," Laurance said than ended the call. Rose walked into the control room and asked," Who was that?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Laurance... Change of plans we're stopping by your time."</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Laurance sighed and truned to George," Georgie... we need to stop by Waterloo, Tadfield, and Soho on the way Peckham... and please stop fildling with that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were in Laurance car. George looked at him and asked," What's going on Tick?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Those ghosts that have been popping up. They're not ghosts. I called my parents. My father's going to come to finger out what they are exactly. He wants an edroge as per usual but I think it might be educational for a few of our friend." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"New regeneration then?" George asked. Laurance hummed," I personly want to know what happened for that to take place. He looks like Crowley but without the serpentine eyes and a burnet. He's always complaining he's not a ginger... I am waiting for the moment he douses become one honestly." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>George looked asked," You Pa wants to be ginger? why?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No clue... most of the time he picks up his regenerations from around him... subcoutiousely no doubt. The Professor's ginger to piss him off at the moment." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>George blinked then said," Your family is weird you know that?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No weirder then Harry's is. Oh, would you look at that Tadfield..." Laurence said as they pulled into Tadfield. They swung first by Anathema and Newton's house. George bonded out and knocked on the witches door. Newton answered," George? How are you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Doing great, Is Warlock home?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No... he's out with the Them and Adam. In the Woods. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>George nodded then mentioned to the woods be aperataing there. Laurance sighed as he called Remus. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>"George? What are you doing?" Warlock said as George appeared in front of the Them. George smiled and said," Hollo, Hey Adam. So the ghosts from all over the place aren't that..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I could have told you that," Adam said as he dusted off his jacket before George continued," Laurence called his father."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Warlock looked at him," Which one?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wensleydale asked," He has two? brilliant!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>George sighed," Both... his Pa is coming in to look at these ghosts and Laurance mentioned that a few us where seeing things." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You have told him that you were seeing your dad, have you? ( Arthur Weasley had still indeed been attacked by Nigini and it was because of Lucas that he had been saved but it was too late. Mr Weasley had passed away that night from venom and blood loss. This also started Albus trying to poke around in Harry's head. And while most of the Weasley's had disowned George and Fred{ Bill, Charlie, and Percy} Mr Weasley was still his father and George remembered when he was younger{ 5-11} how he and Fred would follow their dad around as he talked about mundane items thus very much missed him{ which is one of the reasons he saw Arthur Weasley. For some contest, The Weasley twins, Percy, Bill, and Charlie saw Arthur Weasley, Harry, as mentioned before, saw his Parents[ Lilly and James... Putinia might have seen Lilly as well but this not her story] Hermoine saw here biological father Dan Granger[ as mentioned in previous books he died. About a year or two before our story started], Rose and Bku saw their parents[ for more information on that please read my other Harry Potter sierius], Draco saw his father[ killed by Bellatrix Lestrange, after he had open stated and denounced Voldemort &lt; Having your god on your side sometimes is the best&gt; and Draco was also attacked by Grayback at the same time while his mother and him no live with Remus and Sirius] Remus saw James, and Sirius saw his brother Regulus}. George had told anyone one but Adam, Warlock and Fred this)" Warlock asked. George shook his head," No... but that's beside the point, really. Are you in?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Adam smiled," Summer's boring lately anyways, Pepper, Wensleydale, Brain?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We are always in, Adam," Pepper said as Dog barked happily. Just as Laurence walked up he frowned," We're going to need another car." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Adam smiled," I got one." </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Laurence gave Adam the address of the park then he and George headed to Waterloo( this was also where Remus, Sirius, Rose, Bku and the other's of Grimaled place were at the time). Laurence walked into Loki's Lollies and smiled at Hermoine( who, during last summer, started working part-time at both shops). She smiled back at him and asked," Laurence? What can I help you with."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How do you feel about a trip?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Your investigating the ghosts aren't you?" Sephnir asked as he walked into the shop from the back room. Laurence nodded and the horse god said," Rose, Bku and Draco might want to go... they are here by the way. Full moon was this week." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just as he said that Rose came into the room," I think I'll pass. You're going to be with the Doctor, aren't you? To Roses in the same place. Not fun." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bku and Draco followed her and Draco said," I'll come." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laurence nodded and said," Well Hermoine?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why not... See you," She replied and she and Draco followed Laurence into his car and to Soho. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Once there They meet Crowley. He looked at the group and frowned," Best talk to Harry. I had my fair share of adventures this year. Bit tired, think I'll sleep for a few months." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aziraphale sighed as Harry agreed to go and they soon head to Peckham.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>The Tardis materialised in a corner of the children's playground. Rose Tyler and The Doctor walk out and Laurence smiles. Rose has a rucksack on her shoulder and Laurence smiles a bit," Pa, You remember George, This is Adam, Warlock, Wensleydale, Brain, Pepper, Hermoine, Draco and Harry. Guys, meet my Pa, The Doctor."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rose looks at them and shakes frowns. The Doctor smiles though," Nice to meet you all."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They head to the Tyler flat and Rose says," Mum, it's us! We're back!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jackie smiles at her," Oh, I don't know why you bother with that phone. You never use it!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shut up, come here!" Rose says as she hugs her mom and Jackie says,"Oh, I love you!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" I love you!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" I love you so much!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Doctor trys to manage past the two but Jackie grabbed him and said," Oh no, you don't. Come here!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She kisses him and Laurence blanched as she told the Doctor," Oh, you lovely big fella! Oh, you're all mine."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This gross on so many levels..." Laurence said under his breath as the Doctor tells Jackie," Just, just, just put me down!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mum..." Rose said before handing Jackie her ransack and saying," I've got loads of washing for you. And I got you this. It's from the market on this asteroid bazaar. It's made of, er, what's it called?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laurence answeres," Bazoolium... use in as an ingredient for Space Wizards from around the universe." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bazoolium. When it gets cold, yeah, it means it's going to rain. When it's hot, it's going to be sunny. You can use it to tell the weather," Rose said. Jackie shakes her head( He has met Laurence and the other's before) before saying," I've got a surprise for you and all."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rose frowns," Oh, I get her bazoolium, she doesn't even say thanks."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Guess who's coming to visit? You're just in time. He'll be here at ten past. Who do you think it is?" Jackie asks. Laurence, George, Adam, and Warlock tense as do Harry, Hermoine, Draco and the Them, as Rose said," I don't know."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh go on, guess."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" No, I hate guessing. Just tell me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jackie smiles," It's your granddad. Granddad Prentice. He's on his way any minute, Right, cup of tea!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walks into the kitchen and Rose mutters," She's gone mad."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laurance smirks but said nothing as The Doctor said," Tell me something new."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Granddad Prentice, that's her dad. But he died, like, ten years ago. Oh, my God. She's lost it. Mum? What you just said about granddad..." Rose asked her mum. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>" Any second now."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But he passed away. His heart gave out. Do you remember that?" Rose asked gently generally thinking that her mum had lost it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jackie glares at her and said," Of Course I do."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rose stares at her and asked," Then how can he come back?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why don't you ask him yourself? Ten past. Here he comes," Jackie said as ethereal humanoid shape walks through the outside wall and stands next to Jackie. Laurence shivers as he sees a cyberman and the other bakc as they see the humanoid shape. George looks at Laurence and asks," w...h...how?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not sure, hence why I asked Pa here," Laurence mutters as Jackie tells the ethereal shape," Here we are, then. Dad, say hello to Rose. Ain't she grown?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Doctor, Rose and the rest of their entourage run out of the flat and the Doctor turns to Laurence and asks," How far douse it spread?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"America, France, Bulgarian, really there are reports all over the world of this. The highest reports are here in London mostly around One Canada Square and the Canary Wharf Tower. Been trying to track down the origin but it bounces too much... They don't last long. Have shifts and midday shift only lasts a couple of minutes then they fade," Laurence explained. Harry nodded and said," Drives Crowley and Aziraphale crazy because they aren't actually souls so not ghosts."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Doctor blinked before he asked," What do you mean, shift? Since when did ghosts have shifts? Since when did shifts have ghosts?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The teens shrugged as Jackie said," Oh, he's not happy when I know more than him, is he?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" But no one's running or screaming or freaking out?" Rose said. George sighed," We," he pointed to the Interhouse Maruders," go to a school that has actual ghosts in it. Harry lives with an angel and demon, Moine was adopted by a god, Adam is the actual Anti-Christ, and me, Mione, Harry, Draco, and Laurance are wizards. This relatively normal for us."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Laurance shrugged," As for the others... well at first people did freak out. Had hunters and the ML trying to trap them before the ML backed down and the hunters realized that they weren't affected by any of the tool and weapons the backed off. "</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sam and Dean kept calling Crowley about it but once they realized that they weren't actually spirts they kinda dropped it," Harry said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jackie asked," Why should we? Here we go. Twelve minutes past."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And as if someone flipped a switch the ghosts fade away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The group head back inside and The Doctor turns on the TV. A television show called Ghostwatch run by Appleton is on and Appleton says," On today's Ghostwatch, claims that some of the ghosts are starting to talk, and there seems to be a regular formation gathering around Westminster Bridge. It's almost like a military display."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Doctor changes the channel to the news and the Weatherman says," And tonight we're expecting very strong ghosts from London, through the North and up into Scotland."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another change of chanal and some one's going on about how they married a ghost. Once more a change of the channel and it's some wackos from America called the Ghostfacers and one of them says," Well, no one needs us anymore!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Adam laughs at this and ever one looks at him and he says," What? The few times they actually had something real they need the Winchesters to help them out." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry and Hermoine laugh as well as an advert comes on the TV for some sort of Ghost cream. A few more channel changes confirm that it is indeed worldwide. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"When did it start?" The Doctor asks. It's Hermoine who answeres," about 60 days and 12 hours ago." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Moine... you haven't been counting have you?" Harry asks. Hermoine surges," I get bord."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jackie tells them," Just happened. Woke up one morning, and there they all were. Ghosts, everywhere. We all ran around screaming and that. Whole planet was panicking. No sign of you, thank you very much. Then it sort of sank in. It took us time to realise that we're lucky." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rose looked at her and asked," What makes you think it's granddad?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked at her before answering," She's not the only one seeing the dead. It's probably for the same reason me and Bku and his twin see our parents. They're dead and miss them. So we see them."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not just that. It just feels like him. There's that smell, those old cigarettes," Jackie said. Harry hummed," potion ingredients and old spice."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"ink and paper..." Hermoine added before saying," You've got to make an effort. You've got to want it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The more you want it, the stronger it gets?" The Doctor asked. Hermione nodded and the Doctor said," Like a psychic link. Of course, you want your old dad to be alive, but you're wishing him into existence. The ghosts are using that to pull themselves in."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're spoiling it," Jackie said but Laurence asked," Then why do I see cybermen?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Becuase that's what they are... you had asked if I had been to a different universe? The answer is yes. An alternate universe where so who are alive now aren't. Including you, Rose, Jack, Sherlock and Mycroft. Where they're slightly ahead in techolagey," The Doctor started to explain. Laurence eyes widen," Like ahead enough to creat Cybermen?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ya..." The Doctor said. Laurence frowned as he said," Sorry Jackie but there's no smell, there's no cigarettes. Just a memory. "</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" but they're human! You can see them. They look human to us," Jackie said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" She's got a point. I mean, they're all sort of blurred, but they're definitely people..." Rose agreed. The Doctor shook his head," They're pressing themselves into the surface of the world. But a footprint doesn't look like a boot."</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <strong>
    <span>Canary Wharf</span>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>A well-dressed management type woman comes out of her glass-fronted office with the words Torchwood Institute etched on it she looks at her solders and says," Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce we've just measured the ghost energy at five thousand gigawatts. Give yourselves a round of applause."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yvonne Hartman( the management type woman) makes her rounds around the young adults around the computers. Every single one of them wearing an earpiece. She turns to one and asks them," So, what've we got? Any sign of that power loss?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" There's no problems. Must've been a glitch," Adeola replies. Yvonne calls to a lab.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span> "Rajesh? You got anything?" She askes over a com</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rajesh answeres," It's so busy down here, I'm on Sudoku book 509."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" Well, we just had a great ghost shift."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" I know. But we had nothing. Did they tell you? RND came up with a new spectrometer yesterday. Barged in here, all full of themselves. Said they could detect the heat off a single protozoan through half a mile of steel," Rajesh tells her. Yvonne is intrigued," And what did they find?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rajesh sighs," Nothing. It gave them nothing. Same as ever. The machines keep saying the sphere can't exist. But there it is."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He's talking about the big blank sphere hanging in midair at the end of the laboratory with a ladder underneath it. Yvonne asks," Anything we can do?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" No, I'm all right. It's just, it gets into your head, this thing. Like it's staring at you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"All right, we'll catch up later. Thanks, Raj."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah."</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Back in the office Yvonne tells one of her men," Matt, get on to hospitality, will you? Send Rajesh something. He's going mad down there. Not alcohol." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two of her team text back and forth then leave almost at the same time Yvonna shakes her head at them and says," And they think we haven't noticed."</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>On an unoppicaided floor, the two team members Gareth and Adeola meet up and Gareth points to a no entry sign," Come on. It'll be all right down here. Just two minutes."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This is out of bounds," Adeola reminds him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" Yeah, and that's the point. It's completely safe. They're just building new offices."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What about the workmen?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" They must be allocated(distribute) somewhere else."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>" It's not worth it for a snog," Adeola says. Gareth ignores her had drops under the plastic. After the workmen grab their ladder then leave Adeola follows him saying," Gareth? Now, don't be daft, where've you gone? Gareth! Look, I'm going to head back. I'm seeing you tonight anyway. Gareth? I'm going to go back to work." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There is no reply and she says," This is it. I'm going. See you. Now stop it, Gareth. I'm not kidding, just stop it!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She fumbles her way through the plastic and sees a humanoid shape and stutters out," Sorry, I'm just looking for my friend. Did anyone come down here?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The humanoid pulls back the curtain and it's a Cyberman.</span>
</p><p>
