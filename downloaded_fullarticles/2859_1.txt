    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Great Hall at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizard buzzed with activity, as several students who had volunteered to assist the teachers in decorating the Hall for Christmas rushed to finish before the rest of the school arrived for Sunday dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Connor Murgatroyd, the fifth-year Ravenclaw prefect whose wavy brown hair was streaked with blue, was balanced on a chair, using his wand to levitate ornaments onto one of the Hall’s dozen large Christmas trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beside him, his best friend Rowan Khanna unpacked the baubles from a large box that their Head of House, Professor Flitwick, had deposited on the table before scurrying off to extinguish a tree on the far side of the room that had caught on fire when a student levitated the garland directly into one of the Great Hall’s many floating candles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Last one,” said Rowan, neatly folding the tissue paper back into the box and pulling out his own wand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last few glass balls floated, bubble-like, and settled on the evergreen branches, twinkling in the candlelight.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The two boys stepped back to admire their handiwork, then picked up the empty ornament boxes and carried them to the small room just off the Great Hall where they would be stored until they were re-packed at the end of the Christmas season.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Connor and Rowan re-emerged, they were met with a large box, overflowing with evergreen garland.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The box turned a bit to reveal it was being carried by Hogwarts’ Head Boy, Bill Weasley, whose long red hair was starting to escape from its usual ponytail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He smiled at Connor and Rowan.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m going to hang these up around the fireplace, want to help?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course!” Rowan replied, a little too eagerly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Connor noticed just a hint of a blush rising in Rowan’s already dark cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan fell in step next to Bill, with Connor behind, inspecting the branches.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are spruce!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Good choice, it’s more durable than fir.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Bill gave him a small smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s amazing how you know so much about plants, Rowan.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan stammered and averted his eyes, but managed to maintain conversation while they hung the boughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Connor followed a few steps behind, hanging tinsel on the branches and making them sparkle and shine. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Moments after they finished, Professor Dumbledore’s voice, magically amplified, rang out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you all for assisting with the decorations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every individual here has earned fifteen house points.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The giant hourglasses behind him clattered as they poured a sizeable amount of gems into each House’s reservoir- at a glance, it appeared that Gryffindor and Ravenclaw were closely tied for the House Cup Lead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Now, if you will take your seats, dinner is about to begin.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The enormous oak doors of the Great Hall creaked open, and the rest of Hogwarts’ student body began to trickle in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Connor took a few moments to reflect with nostalgia on the joy that came to the younger students’ faces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Christmas at Hogwarts was truly impressive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, the Murgatroyd family enjoyed Yuletide festivities at home too, and Connor was looking forward to making presents for his younger cousins once the holiday break began, but the ancestral estate where the most recent generation of Murgatroyds lived was never decorated quite like Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Gradually, the golden plates lining the four House tables became emptied of roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and assorted greens, and as the uneaten leftovers vanished, Professor Dumbledore stood up.  The students in the hall turned towards him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The Yuletide season has begun, this year again like many years before,” the Headmaster began, “This year, however, Hogwarts will be assisting the Ministry of Magic in hosting the Ministry’s annual Solstice Ball.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The assembled students collectively gasped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those who had parents who worked for the Ministry knew of the traditional Winter Solstice Gala, always the most extravagant and elegant party of the year that spanned three days and was usually hosted in the grand ballrooms of old family estates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Connor’s aunt Ysabel, who worked for the Department of Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, had brought him to this party once, when he was a little boy, when he and his brother Jacob had spent most of the evening chasing the white peacocks that lived on the grounds of Malfoy Manor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Some of the Gala events will be at the Thorne residence outside of Hogsmede, but the Ball itself will be here in the Great Hall. Students and Hogwarts staff, therefore, will be welcome to wear their finery and enjoy the feast and the dancing,” Dumbledore continued, “And, as is the tradition of the Ministry, entertainment is an important part of the ball.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any students or groups interested in performing should contact their Head of House.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not necessary, of course, to accompany a dance partner in order to attend, but of course you may certainly take this as an opportunity if you’d like.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor noticed Rowan’s eyes flick almost inperceptibly towards the Gryffindor table, where Bill Weasley was seated with his younger brothers, Charlie and Percy.</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Of course, I expect you all will welcome our guests, when they arrive, but I also hope that this helps make your Yuletide season just a little brighter.”</span> <span class="s1">Dumbledore finished, and the students began to leave the hall, chattering excitedly.</span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As the Ravenclaw boys returned to their dorm, Andre Egwu, grinning broadly, pulled out his sketchbook full of clothing designs.  “You all should let me help you pick out your outfits for this ball.- I want all of my dormmates to look <em>impeccable</em>, unlike on Halloween,” he added, with a pointed look at Connor.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It was Halloween!  You’re supposed to dress strangely!  Obviously for a Winter Ball I’ll wear dress robes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Andre turned back to his book, “Dress robes are well and good, but you’ve got to accessorize, too.  Add some flair!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Must I?” asked Bartholomew Jackson laconically, as he carefully folded his school robes and slid into his black silk pajamas.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’ve got a good sense of style, Bart.  Smooth and simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>You’re</em> not the one I’m worried about,” Andre said, looking at his other roommates.  Connor sheepishly put the sweater he was holding back into his drawer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was acid-green with a knitted design across the chest that depicted a stag dressed in a pirate costume, with blue waves rippling down the sleeves.  He had borrowed it from Noah Galloway, his friend in Gryffindor, and found it extremely soft and comfortable on cold nights. Under Andre’s direct gaze, however, Connor slipped into a simpler blue pajama top with a small Ravenclaw eagle embroidered on the breast pocket.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t worry about it Andre,” he said, “I’m going to write home tomorrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was exploring at home last summer and found some dress tunics from the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and a cool coat that my<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>uncle Gilbert said was his, from when he was alive, so it would have been… mid 18th Century, I think?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Castle Ruddygore, where Connor had grown up, was home to a number of ghosts of the Murgatroyd family’s ancestors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sure my dad can owl me something that will fit.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Andre regarded Connor, considering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I do think you’d look good in something bold and modern, but I’ve seen you pull off vintage before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It could work.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well, I’m probably not going to even go,” said Talbott Winger, the most reclusive of the bunch.  “I don’t like dancing.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s not just about dancing, Talbott,” Dorian Knox interjected, poking his head in from the bathroom that adjoined the two fifth-year boys’ dormitories.  “It’s about who you’re gonna ask!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jason Duncan appeared in the doorway as well, toothbrush in hand. “He’s right, you know.  There’s so many attractive people at this school!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Course, I’d like to dance with them all, not just anchor myself to one date.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was a knock on the dormitory door.  Rowan, whose bed was closest, reached to open it, revealing Tulip Karasu holding a purple-spotted toad in her outstretched hands.  “Connor, Galileo came to visit again.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor sheepishly stood to retrieve his wayward pet.  “What are him and Dennis always talking about, anyway?”  For some obscure reason, Connor’s toad Galileo and Tulip’s toad Dennis had immediately taken a liking to each other soon after the two students met.  The two amphibians were often found softly chirping at each other in odd corners of the Ravenclaw tower. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Dorian waved at Tulip.  “Hey Tulip!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’re talking about the ball!  Winger says he’s not going.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Talbott glared at Dorian.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not,” he muttered, avoiding eye contact as he pulled off his socks and placed them carefully into his laundry basket.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Awww, why?” asked Tulip, depositing Galileo into Connor’s hands and sprawling next to Talbott on his bed.  Talbott edged away from her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t want to,” he said.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But what if someone aasssssks you, Talbot?” asked Dorian, sidling up to him on his other side.  Tulip nodded. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Unless you plan on asking me yourself, Knox, I don’t think it’s any of your business.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Dorian slid to the floor, catching the pant leg of Connor’s Ravenclaw-printed pajamas in his free hand.  “My pride, it is wounded!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Help me, Murgatroyd!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor awkwardly reached down and patted Dorian’s head.  “I’m very sorry about your pride.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Dorian sprang to his feet and winked at Connor.  “Thanks, Murgatroyd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least someone here appreciates me.” He clapped Connor on the shoulder and then skipped back through the bathroom to his own dorm.  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">With Dorian gone, Tulip turned to Talbott again.  “I happen to know that someone fancies you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think you should go with her, Talbott Winger.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Talbott avoided her eyes.  “You know I prefer to fly solo.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We’ll see about that,” Tulip mussed Talbott’s hair on the way out of the room.  Talbott crankily fixed his hair as he headed for the bathroom, from whence Rowan had just returned.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I think I lost my Transfiguration textbook at our study table in the Common Room,” Rowan mused, looking through the pile of books on his bedside table, “Could you help me look for it?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor nodded, “I should check that all the underclassmen are upstairs anyway- it’s getting close to their curfew.”  He followed the coffee-skinned boy down the dormitory staircase.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There, they found Tulip seated in an armchair, staring pensively into the fire.  She looked up at their presence.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey,” she said, slouching into her chair.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You ok?” asked Connor, sinking on the a stool near her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tulip shrugged.  “Just thinking about the ball, Connor Murgatroyd.”  He inclined his head towards her and fixed her with what Rowan often called his “Caring Prefect Look,” well-known for its ability to get younger students to explain their problem so that he could better help them solve it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It seemed to work on Tulip as well, for she sighed.  “You know how, when we first met, I was friends with Merula?” Connor nodded- he clearly remembered their third year’s quest to obtain clues to the location of the Vault of Fear. “Well,” Tulip continued, “We were… maybe more than friends?  Or at least I wanted to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know if she ever felt the same way.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor tilted his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His dislike for Merula was strong enough that he could not imagine anyone being interested in her romantically.  But Tulip was still his friend, so he said, “That must have made it harder for you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tulip gazed into the fire.  “Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I haven’t thought about it a whole lot, lately.  Been doing other things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then they announced this ball and everyone is already talking about dates and… I started thinking again.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Are you going to ask her to the ball, then?” Rowan, Transfiguration book safely in hand, perched beside Connor.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t know, Rowan Khanna.  I don’t think I <em>actually</em> want to go with her- I just started wondering about what would happen if I did.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“An important distinction,” Rowan agreed, “I know I can’t ask the person I fancy.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor raised an eyebrow at him.  “I maintain that you could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you’re talking about who I think.”  Rowan blushed and looked away, confirming Connor’s suspicion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He turned back to Tulip.  “I wouldn’t recommend going with Merula, of course, but I might be biased.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tulip snickered.  It was well known that Connor and Merula had taken an immediate dislike to each other first year, and while time and maturity had brought begrudged cooperation, they would probably never see eye-to-eye.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“If you could go out with someone, what would you want that person to be like?” Rowan asked, turning the attention back to Tulip.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She considered for a moment.  “Well, I liked Merula because she’s almost as good of a troublemaker as I am.  She’s clever, and she’s brave.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, a lot of the time, if we played jokes or tricks, she’d be mean about it.  If I could find someone who liked tricks the way I do, but had a real sense of humour…” she trailed off.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor sniggered.  “I’m not an expert in the ways of romance, but, it sounds like maybe you maybe should ask Peeves.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Rowan looked incredulous as Tulip snorted a laugh.  “It would make for highly chaotic dancing, I suppose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All things considered, I might prefer someone more corporeal, though.  What about you, Connor Murgatroyd?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You going to ask anyone?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor shrugged and sighed.  “I don’t know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t mind just dancing with my friends, especially those who don’t have dates.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Didn’t you and Noah Galloway go to that Halloween party together?” Tulip asked.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor chuckled.  He had, in fact, accompanied the tall and lanky Gryffindor to a Halloween party.  “Yeah, but it wasn’t a date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since we’re both canine Animagi and we thought it would be funny.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Dogs wearing leather jackets and sunglasses is funny, you have to admit,” said Rowan, who had helped them charm the leather jackets to fit Noah’s Golden Retriever and Connor’s black fox.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Not quite my style of joke, but it takes all kinds, I suppose.” Tulip grinned as stood up and stretched.  “Really though, Connor Murgatroyd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone you like?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sort of.  I think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s a friend that I might have feelings for, but I’m not sure yet.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tulip fiddled with her Dungbomb necklace and gave Connor an impish grin.  “Well, no harm asking, right?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Rowan shook his head.  “I’m not asking my crush.  No way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d be too afraid that he’ll say no.  And then I don’t know what I’d do.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Would you know what to do if he said yes?” Tulip quipped. Rowan stammered a bit and started to fidget with the top button of his pajamas, as Tulip stood up and stretched.  “I should go to bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks for the talk, Connor Murgatroyd, Rowan Khanna.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor stopped Rowan as they started to head up the staircase to the boys’ dormitory.  “You’ve liked him for a long time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he’s graduating this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don’t have to get him to commit forever.  Just have fun dancing.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Rowan leaned against the wall and regarded Connor.  His left hand continued to fidget with the button on his pajama top.  “I can’t ask Bill Weasley to the ball.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just can’t.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Would you go with him if he asked you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sure.  But that’s never going to happen.  I’m pretty sure he only likes girls, anyway.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Connor regarded his best friend.  “Look, Rowan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I see Bill all the time, when we’re working with Rakepick on Curse-Breaking.  I don’t know if he would like you romantically, but, he’s really nice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m sure he cares about you.  He wouldn’t hurt your feelings.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Rowan shuffled his feet and looked at the floor.  “If you somehow convinced him to ask me…” he mumbled, almost inaudibly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’ll ask some strategic questions.  See what I can do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I want you to have a good time at the dance.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Rowan gave Connor a weak smile and nodded, granting permission, then both slipped back into the dormitory, which had quieted for the night.</span>
