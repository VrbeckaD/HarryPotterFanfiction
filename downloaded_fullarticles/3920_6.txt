    <p>The war was over.</p>
<p>Thousands of people risked and lost their lives in order to stop evil from destroying the world and many where suffering from the trauma they received either. Since the war occurred during Hermione’s last year at Hogwarts, she and other individuals in her class were granted to take their NEWTs and/or OWLs in order to graduate on time and move on with their lives. Hermione was determined to take her tests without having to stay another year at Hogwarts. Although Hermione was happy that the war was over and she was especially proud of herself for surviving some situations, the last thing she wanted to do was return to the place where many people she knew were killed. Harry was going to attempt to do them with Hermione while Ron was just going to go back to school, he determined that no amount of studying could help.</p>
<p>Although Hermione knew that he could apply himself and succeed, she knew it had to do with the reason that she broke it off with Ron. It may come to a surprise to many since they had just gotten together but the war changed everyone, including Ron. Lavender Brown, an old girlfriend to Ron was killed during the war and even though he said he was over her, watching her die changed him. Shortly after that, Hermione and Ron began to fight and they mutually agreed to separate and remain friends. It was probably better that it resulted in a mutual agreement because they both didn’t want to sacrifice their friendship.</p>
<p>The golden trio gathered at the burrow for their usual dinners in order to maintain some normalcy. Only those who were closest to Hermione knew that she obliviated her parents and did not attempt to return their memories due to her fear of ever loosing them again. Harry felt the exact same way, he lost any person that he considered related to his family but the Weasley’s helped him forget about the pain.</p>
<p>Hermione sat down at the dinner table next to Harry and Percy, Ron’s brother. Percy and Arthur Weasley discussed how things had changed and that Kingsley Shacklebolt was doing a wonderful job as Minister of Magic.</p>
<p>Molly Weasley stood up from her chair and cleared her throat.</p>
<p>“Now as usual, let us take a minute to remember our friends and um- family.” Mr. Weasley took his wife’s hand as she stumbled at the end of her sentence.</p>
<p>Hermione took a deep breath and glanced to the empty chair next to George. As long as they are living, the Weasley’s will always have a seat for their son.</p>
<p>The silence broke and everyone began to eat.</p>
<p>It was easier to move on when there were current events going on. For example, Ron became a head boy for Gryffindor at Hogwarts. Professor McGonagall felt he was deserving of the title and was proud to award him with it. Hermione and Harry also received some excellent news from the Ministry, they both have obtained jobs even without their examination results. Harry will become a junior Auror in the Auror department while Hermione will join the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.</p>
<p>
  <em>Tap, tap, tap. </em>
</p>
<p>People glanced over to the window where two very official looking brown owls stood.</p>
<p>“Ah, those must be sent from the school or from the Ministry.” Arthur stated before retrieving a total of 8 letters from the owls.</p>
<p>Molly took a sip from her glass, “Well, dear? What does it say?”</p>
<p>Arthur squinted at the envelopes. “Uh, well- Ah! Yes, these two are for Harry and Hermione from Hogwarts. Must be your examinations. Go on open them!”</p>
<p>With no surprise, Hermione excelled in ever test in which she was most pleased with. Harry was very impressed with himself and the fact that he did well.</p>
<p>“I honestly couldn’t have done it with out Hermione.” Everyone laughed at Harry’s comment but Arthur, who was still examining the other six envelopes. The envelopes where addressed to Percy, George, Ron, Ginny, Harry, and Hermione.</p>
<p>Ginny took notice of her father became concerned, “is everything alright dad?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know to be completely honest. These letters are sent to the six of you from the Ministry of Magic. I uh- don’t know what they are, I am surprised.”</p>
<p>Percy huffed his chest out and took his letter from his father, “me to! Since I am <em>always </em>informed because <em>I </em>work at the Ministry.”</p>
<p>Ron rolled his eyes at his brother and took the letter; the rest took their own and proceeded to open it.</p>
<p>Hermione had a weird feeling about but opened the letter regardless. It read:</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Dear Miss Hermione Jean Granger,</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>              We thank you for your service for putting a stop to He Who Shall Not Be Named and his followers. I am sure you are aware the many lives that were sacrificed for the greater good however, this has drastically decreased the population of wizards and witches and put our race on the brink of extinction. The Ministry of Magic has declared to establish a marriage law to combat this wizard extinction, starting now.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>              This law will affect all individuals from ages 18 – 35 years of age, in which they will be assigned to be married within the next 6 months. One can request a partner if an assignment is not needed and will be required to fill out a form and be sent to the Ministry of Magic as soon as possible. Partnerships will be analyzed in order to have the best probability of success.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>              This law will require married couples to produce at least 2 children. At least one of these children will need to be produced within a year of being married.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>              A second letter will be tomorrow with your assigned partner. You are required to make arrangements to meet your partner and eventually marry your partner. Further information will be attached if there are troubles with the partnership or if a child is unable to be produced. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Thank you for your time. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Regards,</em>
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>The room was stunned.</p>
<p>Molly and Arthur read over Percy’s shoulder and were as stunned as their kids were.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand” was all Mrs. Weasley could say.</p>
<p>“I need to… uh-“ Mr. Weasley stumbled out of the room presumably to contact anyone who knew something about this.</p>
<p>Ginny looked at Harry, “Harry?”</p>
<p>“We will apply to be together, it will be okay.”</p>
<p>They finished their dinner and talked about the letters they had received that evening. Mrs. Weasley waved her wand and the table began to clear it self while dishes began to wash in the kitchen</p>
<p>Hermione stood up, “if it’s alright with everyone, I would like to return home. It’s been an uh- eventful evening.”  </p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley looked worried, “are you sure? We have enough- “  </p>
<p>Hermione shook her head, “it’s okay, I think I will feel better if I went home.”</p>
<p>As she gathered her things she thanked everyone and was assured she would be told if Mr. Weasley got any updates from the Ministry.</p>
<p>Once Hermione left the house, Ron chased after her.</p>
<p>“Hermione?”</p>
<p>Hermione smiled weakly. “Hello, Ronald.”</p>
<p>“Congratulations with uh- graduation from Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, I could have helped you to do the same thing.”</p>
<p>Ron shook his head, “No, it’s better that I went back anyways. But I was actually going to ask you if you uh- wanted to, you know… Because of the marriage law, get married? I mean it would spare us the trouble of having to deal with new people.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyes widened, she had no idea that he was going to bring that up of all things. “Ron, we were terrible to each other. We fought constantly. Maybe under different circumstances it would be better but I couldn’t do that to each other. And you know it.”</p>
<p>Ron nodded. “You’re right.”</p>
<p>Hermione embraced Ron and squeezed him tightly. If the world was different, he would be perfect. He’s loving and kind and protected her during the war, but to much has changed.</p>
<p>“Goodnight Ron.”</p>
<p>Ron smiled and Hermione apparated into the night.</p>
<p>Hermione found herself alone and in her spacious one bedroom flat in London. It was nice and quaint; the living room was white and had large windows on either side of the ornate fireplace. Her style was a mixture of modern and vintage. She was amazed she got it all together as quick as she did. The war left her homeless, so she decided to make a home for herself where she has access to the muggle world.</p>
<p>Hermione eventually fell asleep on the couch while re-reading the stupid letter she received early that day.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days had passed since that dreadful evening, but all Hermione can do is get herself dressed and keep herself busy.</p>
<p>She left her flat to run errands, Harry decided to meet up with her deciding he needed a dose of muggles in his life, as he stated.</p>
<p>They decided to sit for some tea before parting. There wasn’t a lot of errands to run when you have a charmed fridge for food and a charmed laundry machine to clean her clothing. She did have to buy some new towels for her bathroom.</p>
<p>“So, Ginny and I are officially engaged.”</p>
<p>Hermione smiled and hugged her best friend, “that’s amazing! Congratulations Harry, send my best to Ginny.”</p>
<p>“Of course, have you received your letter yet?”</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head while taking a sip of tea.</p>
<p>Harry nodded, “Ron got his. You will laugh when you find out who.”</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, “I need a good laugh, go ahead, tell me.”</p>
<p>“Luna.”</p>
<p>Hermione was shocked, “really? I wouldn’t have paired them together.”</p>
<p>“I said the same thing, not really funny when I think about it but it is surprising. The letter said that they were suitable together, and here’s the best part. After five years and two children, your allowed to separate.”</p>
<p>“Well that’s reasonable. I think its good though, she could brighten his life. He has been gloomy lately, its why him and I didn’t work out.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, Luna can be very good for Ron. Maybe the Ministry knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>Hermione picked up her mail and returned to her apartment. She knew that the letter was in there and she did not want to open it.</p>
<p>She scanned the other envelopes, most were junk mail and bills but one was the start date for her new job at the ministry which was exciting and the thing she was most looking forward to. Finally, Hermione picked up the dreaded envelope and opened it. It read:</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Dear Miss Hermione Jean Granger, </em>
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">
