    <p>Lord Lucius Arcturus Malfoy was a man who showed himself to be in control in all situations. This was not the case now - especially not now, because the Lord he had thought dead for about 13 years had returned and he had punished him for his loosing of the journal given to him to watch over by using Malfoy Manor as the base of his operation. Though it seemed as if this was not yet punishment enough for losing something as precious as this diary his Lord had given to him, as the Dark Lord had been hinting at punishing him - and more so his wife and the Malfoy name by extension - by hurting or even killing his son. </p>
<p>This was worse than anything that the Malfoy Lord could imagine and so he turned to old friends to try and find some way to keep his son out of the way of his Lord’s wrath. One of these friends he had made in his school days and throughout the last war was Augustus Rookwood. Rookwood worked at the Department of Mysteries - the Department of Mysteries - since shortly after he got out of school. He was recruited when Lucius himself was in his fourth year and recruited around the same time the Malfoy Lord was - when he was already through the initiation phase and working fully in the Department. He helped the cause mostly with information from the Ministry but first and foremost he was loyal to the Department of Mysteries and not marked like so many others. </p>
<p>Rookwood gave Lucius an option which would not only protect his son from the Dark Lord but also from the Ministry should the war end in their favor. This protection had a prize, of course: The Malfoy Heir would have to stop his education in Hogwarts and would be trained by the Department of Mysteries personally. If this was a drawback with how much damage Albus Dumbledore had done to Hogwarts since he started working there, could be debated, but it would surely hurt the Malfoy Heir‘s political and social connections.</p>
<p>But Lucius and Narcissa - as well as Draco - decided that protection was more important than anything else. Especially in these times. And protection from both sides of the war was worth virtually anything in their eyes.</p>
<p>Rookwood promised to make sure to get Draco into the Department of Mysteries as an initiate before the school year started. Before they could make any step toward this, however, the Dark Lord needed to be informed and approve it - which meant making sure he had no idea it was for the Malfoy Heir’s protection. </p>
<p>The subject was breached by Rookwood in the middle of June - after Draco had turned 15 but early enough that sending a withdrawal to Hogwarts wouldn’t result in a huge scandal. Thankfully the Dark Lord was enthusiastic about the idea: more spies in the Ministry was always good, even if it took his opportunity to punish one of his followers. But the Malfoy Lord himself and his wife were still within his grasp so it wasn’t too upsetting. </p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>„Your primary tasks, for now, will be helping various members of the Unspeakables with their tasks by getting files from this room to their offices or wherever they are working at the moment. On top of that, you may sometimes be asked to help out in various ways by others. It doesn‘t matter who is asking or what is happening, finish the task set by someone before moving onto the next except when I or the Head Unspeakable tell you to.“ </p>
<p>Draco continued looking slightly up at Rookwood while they walked through the Ministry. They had a privacy bubble spelled around them because discussing DOM issues was better done like this or directly in the Department, no matter how much you trusted the people around you - and they did not trust the people around them all that much anyways. </p>
<p>They stepped into the elevator and Rookwood stopped talking in favor of listening to the people around them. He put his hand on Draco’s shoulder, pulling him close, when Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody stepped inside from the DMLE floor, followed by a slew of tiny paper planes on the way to their recipient.</p>
<p>Draco was tense until Mad-Eye left and they were more or less alone again. The ride took about 5 minutes from the last official Ministry Floor down to the DOM and Rookwood took that time to remind the Malfoy Heir of the one thing that was most important for him from now on: “And remember: do not give your name to anyone down here. There are beings housed in the chambers of the DOM that will use the power you give them with your name against you. From now on and any time you are wearing the robes of the DOM you are Initiate Zircon until such a time where you are awarded the rank of an Unspeakable. No matter what, your loyalty lies first and foremost with the DOM. Any people you see that should either be dead or shouldn’t even exist you just … don’t talk about it outside the DOM.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded. He may come off as immature to the people that only saw him outside of the Slytherin common room but he had been trained to take on the Malfoy Lordship since he could talk. He knew when he had to be serious - and this would be the point where he would stay as serious as the Malfoy Lord should be. </p>
<p>The elevator stopped and the two stepped outside and into the entrance area of the DOM - the only room anyone other than an Unspeakable could get into without setting off every alarm in the Department. </p>
<p>Rookwood guided Draco toward a side room where the Unspeakable robes hung - Initiates wore the same. The robes made it impossible for anyone that wasn’t wearing one as well to see under the hood. Voices, of course, could still be differentiated, but not many Unspeakables spoke in robes outside of the DOM. Both downed their robes and went through big double doors into the Department.</p>
