<p>His mother was dead.<br/> <br/> Narcissa Druella Black was now ashes and dust, trapped in a traditional cremation urn, no longer able to see the light. Her wishes to be alongside her dead sisters in the ugly, dank columbarium of the Black family had been granted. Her son could only hope that she rested—and that she rested well in a place where she could finally be heard by the simple-minded men that had refused to listen to her pleas when she’d been alive. He hoped she was safe above all, that she could no longer be harmed by anyone, not even by herself.<br/> <br/> Draco could not take his eyes off the name that had been engraved in white marble. His mother deserved better than being trapped in another dark and ancient place. Her name should be presented atop a hill, where the trees embraced her and the flowers befriended her, and where the sun bestowed its bright rays upon her blonde hair, making her own golden crown shine brighter than the stars.<br/> <br/> Narcissa Black deserved to be bathed in the colourful petals that sprung whenever she was near. She deserved life and flowers, but now, she was in a cold place filled with lifeless vines and moss.<br/> <br/> His mother had been taken from the world too soon and too harshly. He could not even remember the last words he had spoken to her before he found out she had been murdered in her own home—in the house she’d been raised, in the house she’d thought was the safest.<br/> <br/> The shocked expression she must have worn when her attackers invaded her home haunted him everywhere he went. Her corpse even more so. The crimson blood that had poured from between her legs, the haunting smile that had been slashed through her face, and the harsh bruises on her body that had covered her like an evening gown appeared more clearly in his head than his first memory with her ever did.<br/> <br/> Draco Malefoy had a ton of regrets. Not spending enough time with his mother before she died was one of them. He regretted moving away from her so early. He regretted leaving her all alone in her ancient home with only her dead ancestors’ portraits as company. He never should’ve left her.<br/> <br/> Something wet dripped down his cheek, and he wiped it away quickly with a gloved hand. He had not cried in a long time, not since he was 15, he believed, when his mother left his father and they left for London. It felt like a lifetime ago.<br/> <br/> Was his father grieving at the moment, he wondered? Was his mind slowly giving into guilt and insanity? Was he blaming himself for the death of his former wife? Or did he brush off the loss like lint on his robes? Did he breathe out a sigh of relief when the news of her passing arrived? Had he ever actually cared?<br/> <br/> His fists clenched, his nails digging into his palms, as he thought of the ways his father could have reacted. He knew Lucius Malefoy had something to do with this. His mother never would have been brutally beaten, raped, and murdered if his father hadn’t angered someone dangerous. He must’ve done something wrong.<br/> <br/> More tears came crashing down his face, and this time, Draco did not have the heart to wipe them away. Perhaps his mother would appreciate them. Perhaps she would be flattered to know he was still grieving for her.<br/> <br/> He could not bear to keep staring at her monument, though. He did not like to be constantly reminded of her death. If he continued, he was sure he’d rot away with her, and he knew his mother wouldn’t like that.<br/> <br/> When he left the columbarium, Draco found the rain a comforting addition to his miserable day. He refused to shy away from the cold drops, feeling as though it was the least he could do to atone for letting his mother die. He let the raindrops punish his clothes, prick his glacial skin, and replace the hot tears on his face.<br/> <br/> Never in his life had he felt so useless and empty.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Draco threw his father’s letter into the fireplace in pure rage. Later, he would regret this and wish that he could read the letter for a second time, but at the moment, he was furious.<br/> <br/> He was right all along, and he hated it.<br/> <br/> Two weeks after his mother’s funeral, his father’s letter had finally arrived on his doorstep. He’d refused to read it at first, but his curiosity and need for vengeance got too much, and he’d ripped open the envelope as soon as he’d gotten home from his clinic.<br/> <br/> The entirety of the letter had been written in French, the selfish, paranoid bastard his father was. It had begun with his father asking asinine questions as usual—he’d even asked how well Draco was doing and said how terribly sorry he was for being unavailable at the day of his mother’s entombment.<br/> <br/> If he had read this letter seven years ago and he was fifteen again, Draco would’ve believed in everything his father told him, but his mother had long since cleansed most of Lucius’s influence on him. At the moment, there was nothing in the world he hated more than he did his own father.<br/> <br/> Then, Draco had skipped to the interesting bits, uninterested in his father’s platitudes. He’d found out the truth, and he was right—his father had everything to do with the death of his mother.<br/> <br/> Lucius Malefoy had apparently lost to Antoinette Zabini in an inane gambling game of sorts. And because his father was an utter prick, he’d refused to pay Zabini’s winnings, ran to Manoir des Malefoy in Marseille, and had hidden there, knowing the Cosa Nostra would not touch him in France. Of course, his father hadn’t thought of what his own actions could do to his family in London. His mother hadn’t had the chance to hide in an old mansion, surrounded by loyal members of his father’s precious Draconian Syndicate and other allies from <em>Le Milieu</em>.<br/> <br/> His fingers itched for something to punch, and he carelessly drove his right fist into the wall, already feeling his knuckles bleed shortly after. It was fine. The pain let him know that he was still alive.<br/> <br/> His useless father also had the audacity to lie to him—to tell him that he continued to worry about him. He’d said he did not want any harm to come to the next leader of the Draconian Syndicate, that he’d always badly wanted to protect him and raise him in their own territory, but his mother had always been stubborn as well, he’d mentioned, and that she’d never wanted Draco to be involved in any Malefoy-related business.<br/> <br/> “<em>Connerie,</em>” muttered Draco as he thought back to his father’s words in the message he’d just burnt. He never did manage to completely get rid of his usage of French and his accent when he would speak English. He could fake a good amount of different accents though, some without even trying.<br/> <br/> Lucius had written that he would like for Draco to move to Manoir des Malefoy immediately—or at least somewhere in France, somewhere he could watch over him. His father had said that he would not be safe in London any longer after what had happened to his mother and that it would be best for his well-being if he moved back to France.<br/> <br/> Fuck that. If they were still being stalked by the Zabinis, then he was absolutely certain that his father still hadn’t paid them, the frugal bastard he was. Lucius Malefoy had all the money in the world to attend auctions and buy all the foreign whores he wanted, but paying for his debts to a dangerous Italian family was simply out of the question for his egotistical father.<br/> <br/> Draco refused to go back to a place where guns and violence awaited him. He knew what terrible things his father could do to his mind and how it affected his behaviour. His mother wanted him to forget that sort of life, to turn around and begin anew.<br/> <br/> Out of nowhere, he heard the soft, serene voice of his mother whispering into his ear, “<em>Give up the gun, dragon.”</em><br/> <br/> He turned his head back instantly, expecting to see her cold yet beautiful face behind him, smiling slightly just as she always had. Instead, he saw the painting of a garden that she’d given him on his 20th birthday. She’d loved it more than he ever did, told him how much the pale colours reminded her of him. He’d never liked it, but now he felt as though he couldn’t live without staring at it for hours a day.<br/> <br/> Before he realized it, warm tears stained his cheeks for the second time that night. His heart was in a constant state of aching. It was not fair. Why hadn’t they gotten to him first? Why had they murdered his mother—why not him? Why not his father? Why not anybody except his mother?<br/> <br/>It might be his father’s harsh training talking, but he would like for his mother’s murderers to perish. He couldn’t give up his gun until he caused those worthless Italians to bleed to their deaths. Perhaps he should attack their mothers as well, have them be raped and beaten before he tore their faces off until they were unrecognizable.<br/> <br/> “<em>Give up the gun.</em>” The words haunted him without cease every time he did anything but. It was the Malefoy in him, everybody else had said whenever he would let the rage fuel his heart, and those moments would be the only few times Draco embraced his French heritage.<br/> <br/> Lucius Malefoy had always told him that anger could do so much more than sadness, that it was better for him to give into the burning fury than the wilting petals of grief because mourning never accomplished a lot.<br/> <br/> His eyes focused in on the painting once more, the grey and blue daffodils seemingly conveying some sort of secret message that Draco could never fully comprehend to save his life.<br/> <br/> Whispering a meaningful apology to his deceased mother, Draco, for once in his life, thought that maybe his father was right about one thing.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Someone was following him. Draco would be lying if he said he wasn’t scared. Truthfully, he was fucking terrified.<br/> <br/> He kept calm on the outside though, recalling his father’s words of faux wisdom: “<em>To be seen as afraid is to raise a white flag in defeat.</em>” It would be utterly disgraceful and craven to open up one’s afraid expression to the world. Defeat and loss were worse fates than death. And so, like he always had done, Draco pretended as though the man following him wasn’t there.<br/> <br/> The man’s footsteps were now as familiar to him as his mother’s voice had been, for he’d been following Draco for weeks, ever since his mother’s death. His footfalls were heavy and sharp on the pavement. The man always walked slower than Draco did, keeping at least five steps away from him.<br/> <br/> The man’s silhouette waited for him every night outside his clinic. The man would always stand by the same tree, in the same pose, and with the same obsessive glare. He was burly and tall, usually wearing dark robes and a hat.<br/> <br/> The footsteps behind him quickened and his heartbeat quickened with them. His hand instinctively travelling to the gun sheathed in a holster inside his coat, he swallowed his fear and gripped the inner Malefoy that he knew was hidden somewhere within him.<br/> <br/> The man was much closer to him now, and Draco could feel him breathing on his neck. He summoned up all the courage that his father had forced upon him long ago as he paused in his tracks and turned completely around to face the man behind him. Finally, he saw the man’s appearance.<br/> <br/> The man was dark-skinned with a sharp nose, thick lips, and rounded eyes. If he were to estimate, he would say this man was the same age as him, but of course, he couldn’t know that just by staring at him.<br/> <br/> He let a small smirk settle on his face as he greeted the man in a perfectly-rehearsed English accent, “Good evening, sir.”<br/> <br/> The man also halted, eyebrows raised in a flabbergasted expression for a quick second before his face turned blank. “Good evening.”<br/> <br/> Draco took notice of the man’s thick, Italian accent. He only did more to confirm his suspicion that he was being hunted by the Zabinis. This man was most likely one of Antoinette’s henchmen.<br/> <br/> “May I ask why you are walking so closely behind me?” he spoke casually, as though he wasn’t currently fearing for his life just like his father had taught him.<br/> <br/> “I was not,” the man denied.<br/> <br/> Draco forced a hopefully convincing chuckle. “Of course. Perhaps you know me from somewhere?”<br/> <br/> “You’re Draco Malefoy,” he spat. An uncomfortable chill sat on Draco’s stomach as the man enunciated his name, French pronunciation and all. Though he distracted himself by thinking of how strange French sounded on an Italian accent.<br/> <br/> “Thank you for saving me from the uncomfortable introduction that was surely about to come,” Draco said, a laugh lacing his tone. “I’m afraid that I have yet to know your name, friend.”<br/> <br/> “I’m not your friend!” the man growled, his posture shifting to a defensive stance.<br/> <br/> “Forgive me for assuming then,” offered Draco. He shoved his hands in the pockets of his trousers as to look more casual. “Care to give your name, sir?”<br/> <br/> “No.”<br/> <br/> “Don’t you think it’s rather rude of you to—”<br/> <br/> He cut him off. “No.”<br/> <br/> “Can you at least tell me where you are headed, sir?” asked Draco, hoping that his voice only conveyed curiosity and not a hint of interrogation.<br/> <br/> “I’m going home,” the man shortly answered, turning around and taking off before Draco could ask him another question.<br/> <br/> “Have a safe journey!” Draco called out as a goodbye. When the man was finally out of his sight, he heaved a sigh of relief, thinking that he should’ve engaged the man in conversation long ago.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Draco Malefoy was so very tired. His hands shook with paranoia, his eyelids opened half-heartedly, his back slouched in exhaustion—and he hadn’t slept in four days. He was tired and terrified. Tired and terrified, he was. Tired of living yet terrified for his life.<br/> <br/> He did not know what to do anymore.<br/> <br/> After he’d chosen to talk to the man who’d been following home for weeks, there came another threat. This time, no dark man in dark robes stalked him. Instead, a dark man in white robes who sat inside his Rolls Royce machine continued to cock his gun up and shoot occasionally as a sort of warning.<br/> <br/> He flinched when the man let loose another bullet up in the air, tugging at his now dirty blond hair in frustration. “Fuck.”<br/> <br/> He caught a glance of his fireplace and thought back to his father’s letter, remembering his invitation to Marseille. Should he go?<br/> <br/> Draco knew there wasn’t a safer place for a Malefoy than France. His father had ‘associates’ all over the damn country, and he would be recognized and protected by them without a single word. He himself had met with the main leaders of the French Mob and their protégés every year before he and his mother left the blasted country. They would know him certainly, but would they actually still think of him as an ally or a <em>traître?</em><br/> <br/> But then he thought of the stupid smug expression his father would surely wear when Draco walked up the steps of Manoir des Malefoy. He thought of the different ways his father could manipulate, control, and use him. He thought of his mother and how she’d been utterly afraid of the person he’d become when he was 15. That had been the moment she’d finally snapped—when Draco came home with blood on his white trousers and a proud smile on his face. He’d killed someone that day, a treacherous and frankly useless someone, and his mother had looked close to tears. That had been when she’d finally decided to divorce—<br/> <br/> Another bullet cracked through the air.<br/> <br/> “Shut the fuck up!” shouted Draco, his head poking out the nearest window. When the man turned to him with an odd smile, he instantly took his head back inside.<br/> <br/> Several sudden thoughts came to him at once. Had his mother experienced the same things before she died? Had she been stalked and threatened before they’d pulled the trigger on her? Had she felt the same fear and same weariness after weeks of being followed? Was the man that followed him the one who’d ripped her skirts and ploughed right through her like a common whore? Was the man right next to this doorstep the same man who’d killed her?<br/> <br/> Fury burned through his chest as the awful questions flew across his head. Something dark and familiar and so very Malefoy clenched his heart, and he thought of pulling the gun out his drawer and shooting the man in the middle of the dirt road to let him die an unfortunate death. He should take the man deep into the forest around his home, Draco thought, and feed him to the wild animals that lived there.<br/> <br/> His hands subconsciously rushed to open his drawer, taking out the gun his father had sent him on his 18th birthday. The gun was always loaded, and at the moment, Draco couldn’t care to count the bullets within.<br/> <br/> When he was letting his fingers get used to the weapon, Draco faltered at the sight of the blue and grey daffodils on his wall. The peace and happiness the flowers implied seemed to mock and shame him.<br/> <br/> He fought back frustrated tears, conflicted between his father’s and mother’s lessons. The famed cruelty of the Malefoys flooded his veins, but the inner rebel of every Black fought back.</p>
<p>His father would tell him to just get it over with, to let the undeserving die already so as to save himself. His mother would convince him that no life was his to take, that it would be better to die with unbesmirched hands than to live knowing he’d intentionally done harm to another human being.<br/> <br/> The sound of another bullet being shot pierced his ears, and he lost what little hold he had on his self-control.<br/> <br/> The Malefoy cruelty won in the end, and surprisingly Draco did not feel the smallest of guilts. In truth, serenity and relief were all that washed over him as he watched the man’s blood run from his forehead to his face, and all he thought was, he could finally get a well-deserved rest.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Draco awoke a few hours before dawn, darkness all he could see and darkness all he could feel. He meant to bury the man he’d killed somewhere deep in the forest, where the animals would feed off him first before anybody noticed that he was gone. Draco wished he lived near sea instead so that the waves could eat away at the man’s skin slowly.<br/> <br/> He drove the dead man’s machine into the woods, the corpse emitting a foul smell as it rot beside him. The scent suffocated him, but at the same time, never had he been so comforted by a single smell until then. It felt good to know the man who kept him up every night was finally dead. It felt good to <em>kill.</em><br/> <br/> The rain poured down on him after he’d buried the man’s body, and that was the exact moment when the shame kicked in. He was ashamed, not for killing the man who’d threatened him, but for going against his mother’s wishes and disappointing her.<br/> <br/> As he stared up the dark early morning sky, Draco thought of his mother’s face back when he was 15, the unshed tears in her eyes, and how utterly frightened she looked back then.<br/> <br/> He cursed the evil that coursed through his veins. He cursed his father for instilling in him the cruelty and the inhumane. He cursed his mother for dying too damn soon. He cursed the war. He cursed everything that had led him to this very moment.<br/> <br/> Soon, the drops of rain and tears on his face intermingled until he could no longer tell them apart.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Draco held his forehead in his hand, rubbing his temple. He still had no idea what to do.<br/> <br/> Now that he’d killed one of them, the Zabinis would surely torture his body and mutilate him beyond recognition before they granted him a merciful death.</p>
<p>Now, he realized, it wasn’t only his father who’d done a mess. If anything, Draco had made it much, much worse.<br/> <br/> He did not want to go back to Marseille. In France, more violence, more guns, more blood, more gangs, and more guilt awaited him, and he wasn’t sure if he could continue living if all he felt was shame after bloodlust after shame. He would not live like that. He could not live like that.<br/> <br/> But he could not stay here either. London was becoming a much dangerous place than a battlefield, with so many different people that he didn’t know out to kill him hiding in plain sight. He might just have to burn his home down before he left the city.<br/> <br/> Draco heaved a sigh, knowing the right decision already. France was always safe for a Malefoy, and no matter how hard he tried to fight against his ancestry, he knew that he was a Malefoy through and through. Being safe was a better option than holding onto his pride. Dealing with his <em>connard </em>of a father was better than the cruel fate he would have to face here in London.<br/> <br/> Truth was, Draco was afraid of death. The state of being dead often kept him up at night, especially after his mother had been brutally murdered. The afterlife frightened him as well, realizing that there was plenty of space for him in the burning depths of Hell and no place at all in the sweet paradise of Heaven, but the thought of no afterlife—the thought of there being absolutely nothing after death was another matter.<br/> <br/> When he was dead, his dreams of being a world-famous surgeon would never come true. The simple things he could do now—breathing, eating, seeing, smelling, feeling—could never be done again if he were buried six feet under, stiff and unmoving for eternity. And long after he was dead, no one would ever know his name again. No one would remember him anymore a hundred years after he died. No one would care even if his life was lived to the fullest. To future generations, he would be nothing. Not a surgeon, not a gangster, not a murderer, not a bad person who tried to do good. Centuries later, he would be bones and dust. Afterwards, he would truly be nothing.<br/> <br/> Of course, he was afraid of death. Who wouldn’t be?<br/> <br/> And because of that particular fact, Draco stretched his neck side-to-side, making a reluctant decision. He would go back to Marseille, to Manoir des Malefoy, no matter how much he hated the thought of it, for there was no place safer. And if the feud between the Zabinis and Malefoys ever died down, he would go back here. Perhaps he could even gather enough courage to go live in the Black residence.<br/> <br/> He searched for paper in which he could begin to write a response letter to his father, opening up drawers yet finding nothing. He reached the last drawer and sighed gratefully when he found a stained piece of paper. Taking the paper between two fingers, Draco opened it up on the table, only to find that it held content.<br/> <br/> He scanned his eyes over the carefully-written words of the letter, trying to recall where and who it came from.</p>
<p align="center"><em>To Draco Malefoy, <strong>mon amour,</strong></em><br/> <br/> <em> <strong>Tu seras toujours dans mon coeur</strong></em><br/> <em> <strong> Je t’aime. Je t’aime. Je t’aime.</strong></em><br/> <br/> <em> The Windy City is where you will find me</em><br/> <em> There, I will give you the intimacy you’ve always longed for</em><br/> <em> Sail an ocean for me, risk your life for me, change your love for me</em><br/> <em> And maybe I will reconsider, maybe you will see me,</em><br/> <em> And maybe I will love you again</em><br/> <br/> <em> Yours always and forever,</em><br/> <em> Granger.</em></p>
<p>He frowned, his mind faintly drawing up memories of this Granger girl. Some of his experiences with her seemed a tad bit blurry, but what remained clear to him was her appearance—the shape of her nose whenever she smiled at him, the way the sides of her brown eyes would crinkle whenever she laughed, and the brown curls on top of her head seemingly growing larger whenever he would manage to irritate her.<br/> <br/> He was 16 when he’d first met Granger, and if he remembered correctly, she was a year older than him. He couldn’t pinpoint how they’d exactly met, but he remembered that she'd been fascinated by his French accent and asked if she could learn the language from him. As a virginal adolescent boy, of course, he’d agreed, almost instantly taking a fancy to her. Before long, they’d developed some sort of romance.<br/> <br/> His mother had once described his being with the girl as a ‘scandalous dalliance’, and now that he was older, Draco agreed, lightly chuckling at the memories of them kissing and touching each other in inappropriate places.<br/> <br/> Why they eventually separated, Draco couldn’t recall. His memory had always been rather problematic, and it did not surprise him that he hadn’t thought of the girl in years before now.<br/> <br/> He wondered if he would still be able to find her in The Windy City she'd spoken of, in the States. He wondered if she would remember him, if she still waited for him after all these years. Draco doubted it but was glad that he found another option.<br/> <br/> He should go to the States, if only to search for this Granger girl whose first name he couldn’t even remember anymore. The United States was far enough away from Italy, he supposed, and he was sure the Americans wouldn’t dabble in such a dishonourable cause like organized crime. Also, they’d partaken later in the war and were most probably less affected than France was by it.<br/> <br/> Draco read the letter for the second time, relieved that he’d found an option where he didn’t have to surrender his pride.<br/> <br/> Maybe he didn’t have to find Granger, after all. Maybe he should just hide in the City of Chicago for the rest of his life, under a different name and appearance. Maybe he could start anew, away from all the gangs and guns and guilt. Finally.<br/> <br/> Yes, another chance at life sounded great to Draco’s ears. Maybe he could try making his mother proud this time, instead of dishonouring her memory.<br/> <br/> Draco smiled hopefully at the thought.<br/> <br/> He would need to start rehearsing his American accent.</p>
