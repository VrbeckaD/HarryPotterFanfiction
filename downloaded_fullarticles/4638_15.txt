          <div class="userstuff"><p>It's what strikes you most.</p>
<p>Besides Lysander's tenderness, besides Scorpius' differences from his own family, besides Teddy's…uniqueness, Lorcan stands out to you. He's so different from the others that it makes your heart pound every time you think of him, of…</p>
<p>…<em>his eyes</em>.</p>
<p>They're piercing, and unnerving, and utterly mesmerizing. You can try to describe them all you want, but the best thing you can come up with is that they're "<em>Lorcan blue</em>." They're not really the color of the sky, or that of the most beautiful, deep, blue ocean waters. They're not the color of the gems at the base of your mother's throat, nor do they match that vibrant blue of his House. They're vibrant, all right—just vibrant, Lorcan blue.</p>
<p>His eyes are so unlike anything else that you squirm and fidget every time he's near. There's no explanation for him—everything about him can be summed up with a glance at those mischievous orbs. You couldn't even describe him, that <em>gaze</em> on paper, because he's someone to be seen…it's a stare that needs to be felt.</p>
<p>It's funny how any other wizard can throw azure flowers at you and all you can think is one thing:</p>
<p>
  <em>Lorcan blue.</em>
