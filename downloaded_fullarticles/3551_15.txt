    <p>“I’ll see you in a few hours, Caelum.”  With a last hug Harry watched as his son practically bounced up the steps to his preschool.  He had been hesitant about sending the boy to school so early but after gentle prodding from Hermione and Molly and much internal debate with himself, he had given in and enrolled him in the half day program.   Harry feared it wouldn’t be long before he gave in to Caelum’s pleading and switched him to the full day program instead.     </p><p> </p><p>With a sigh and a thought of how quickly time was passing, Harry started walking towards Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.  Most mornings found him there since Caelum had started school.  Occasionally he could be seen ringing up customers but most of the time he was either restocking shelves or in the back with the twins digging through journals the Marauder's had left behind.  They had developed a whole new line that was flying off the shelves from the ideas that were on those pages.  Marauder’s Madness was on pace to outsell the Wonder Witch line by the end of the year. </p><p> </p><p>As he made his way in the back entrance to the shop he was surprised to find the area empty.  He made his way through the curtain that separated the front of the store from the back of the store and saw Fred at the register.  “Harry!  I’m so glad you’re here today.  George is sick and will be out of it for the rest of the day.  Can you either take over for me here or start restocking some of the products?”  Harry quickly agreed and made his way to the back to grab the boxes of their most popular items.</p><p> </p><p>The morning passed by quickly and before either man noticed it was almost noon.  “Fred, I’ve got to go get Caelum soon.  Why don’t we close up for lunch and you join me?  I can check with Molly but I’m sure she’ll watch him afterwards and I’ll come back and help you for a few more hours.”  Molly rarely turned down time with one of the grandkids.</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds great, Harry.  Let me check in on George and I’ll meet you out front.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded as he put the last few products he had in the box onto the shelf in front of him.  He then stepped outside, raised the wards on the bottom half of the property, and conjured a sign on the door that stated they would reopen at 2.  Just a few minutes later Fred joined him, and they began the trek to Caelum’s school.  The two made small talk after Harry asked about George and were halfway there when Fred broached a subject that was normally intentionally avoided. </p><p> </p><p>“So, today’s Prophet says Draco Malfoy is back in town this week.  His band apparently is extremely popular, and they are on a world tour.  Doing a few shows in London.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry cycled through so many emotions over the next few seconds he couldn’t catalog them all if he tried.  He made his best attempt at nonchalant and said “Is that so? Well, good for him.  Where were you wanting to eat for lunch?  Should we grab anything for George while we are out?”  He knew his attempt to change the conversation wouldn’t fool Fred, but he needed more time to process the fact that Draco was back in town.  It would no doubt require multiple breakdowns and several bottles of Firewhiskey.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The day went as Harry thought it would.   Fred, Caelum, and Harry had lunch at the Leaky, Molly agreed to watch Caelum, Harry helped Fred close up the shop, and Harry picked up his son from the Burrow covered in dirt, flour, and some substance he was afraid to examine too closely. </p><p> </p><p>As he watched his son splash and play in the bath his thoughts landed on Draco.  His thoughts often wondered to the man so that was nothing new, but the fear and worry were.  He had no clue what Draco’s reaction would be or if he’d even want a relationship with the boy who was currently covering the floor with bubbles and water. </p><p> </p><p>With a quick swish of his hand he set the floor back to rights and scooped his son out.  After brushing his teeth and a quick story, Caelum was fast asleep in bed.  Harry quietly turned out the lights and closed the door.  He then made his way into the study to write a letter that would no doubt change Draco Malfoy’s life.  He gathered the letters that he had written over the years to the blond and placed them in a box with tonight’s letter on top.  Before he could change his mind, he sent his owl off into the night and sank down into his chair with a tumbler of Firewhiskey.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>It had been years since Draco Malfoy had set foot on British soil.  He left after completing his N.E.W.T.s as was required by his probation and never looked back.  When Father had been sentenced to Azkaban his Mother lost all sanity and had to be placed in St. Mungo’s.  One he had no desire to ever see or speak to again, the other had no clue who he was.  The friends he had before the war were either dead, in Azkaban with his Father, or had made it clear they wanted nothing to do with the Malfoy heir.  Of course, there was Harry, but it had been over 5 years ago that he walked away from that relationship. </p><p> </p><p>Relationship.  Ha, bloody, ha.  As if what they had could be called a relationship.  Harry had approached Draco on the train ride back to Hogwarts for what was termed their eighth year.  They both mutually agreed to bury the hatchet and simply get through the year.  After the feast they discovered that since there were so few returning students from their year, they’d all be placed in visiting professor’s quarters and only have one roommate.  Wouldn’t you know it that the two of them were roomed together? </p><p> </p><p>As the first term went on they both realized how broken the other one was and took comfort in each other.  First it was simply helping each other through the nightmares and being on hand to talk about them if either wanted to.  Before long they noticed they both slept better if they slept in the same bed.  That inevitably led to cuddling, which lead to what Draco liked to call “Harry Potter’s Great Sexual Awakening”.  They agreed to keep it casual and secret.  There was no need for whatever they were doing to be known by anyone.  The papers would have had a field day crucifying Draco and doubting Harry’s sanity all over again. </p><p> </p><p>By the time they graduated they had discussed the possibility of coming out and trying to make it work, but the public still hated Draco and felt he should be in prison with his father.  After many fights and sleepless nights, Draco made the decision to leave the wizarding world all together.  He never told Harry how he felt about him or asked Harry how he felt.  It would hurt too much to acknowledge it and walk away. </p><p> </p><p>They spent one last night together after the graduation ceremony and the next morning Draco packed a bag and walked away from all he had ever known and quite possibly the only man who would ever fully know who he was and still care about him.  He made his way to the Ministry to submit his diploma and sign paperwork that finished his probation and made his way down to the portkey office.  He asked for the next portkey available and found himself in America. </p><p> </p><p>He thanked Merlin he had thought ahead to convert a large portion of his vault into muggle currency before he left because the first few months were anything but easy.  He had no knowledge of how to live in the Muggle world and no skills to benefit them.  He had almost given up more than once and found himself drinking in a seedy bar in New York when the band that was set to play that night came out and said they had to cancel the show since their lead singer was sick.  Very few people knew that singing was one thing Draco did well.  He had learned a fair amount of muggle songs over the past couple of months and was just drunk enough to offer to step in. </p><p> </p><p>The rest as they say, was history.  The crowds doubled with Draco as the lead singer the first six months and by a year they were sold out constantly.  It wasn’t long until they had a record deal and a few gold and platinum albums.  No one looked at him any more as if he was scum when they heard his name.  It was what he had always wanted….wasn’t it? </p><p> </p><p>As he walked along the abandoned halls of his childhood home he wondered if it all had been worth it.  Had he walked away from his only chance at happiness and love simply because he was afraid of what others would think?  Why was there still some emptiness and yearning in his heart if he had accomplished what he had set out to do?  Did it even matter?  Surely Harry had found someone by now who loved him as he deserved to be loved.  There was no reason to get maudlin over the past simply because he was back in the same area as the man. </p><p> </p><p>He heard a pecking at the window and noticed the owl with a package attached to its leg.  He walked over to let the owl in and wondered who would have sent him something.  “Hello.  Aren’t you a beauty?  I’m sorry I don’t have any owl treats on me, but if you make your way to the owlery you’re welcome to rest and grab a bite to eat.”  He removed the package and noticed the handwriting on it.  Harry?  Why would Harry send him anything?  He placed the package on the table in front of him and settled into a chair to read the letter.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Draco,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I don’t really even know where to start.  I’ve often wondered if this day would ever come and what I’d say to you if it did and yet my floor is littered with crumbled up letters that I’ve discarded in trying to find the words.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I guess the best thing to do is to let the letters speak for themselves.  When you open the box, you’ll notice the envelopes are numbered.  I’m sure you have a massive amount of questions and will have even more when you finish reading them.  I am free tomorrow from 8:30 until noon.  Send me an owl and let me know what time works best for you and where you wish to meet.  </em>

  <em>P.S.  I enclosed a scrapbook at the bottom of the box.  Trust me and read all the letters first.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco had no idea what the letters contained or why Harry was so confident he’d want to meet to ask questions, but he opened the box without another thought and began reading a stack of letters that would change his life forever. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Draco,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I really hope this reaches you wherever you are.  I need to talk to you as soon as possible about an important issue.  Please get in contact in any way at your first opportunity.  </em>

</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m not sure if the owl couldn’t reach you or if you returned it without reading the letter.  It’s been 6 months since you left, and I still urgently need to talk to you about a very private matter that is too sensitive to put in a letter that can be intercepted.  So here I am, trying and hoping again that this one reaches you or that you’ve come closer than you were.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Anxiously waiting,</em>

  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s been 8 months now.  I’ve pretty much given up all hope that you are going to get this or return anytime soon.  This is my third attempt to contact you and let you know I need to talk to you desperately.    If this letter fails to reach you and is returned like the others, it will be the last one I attempt until I hear you are back.  Merlin, Draco, I really fucking hope you come back.  I don’t know where you are or what you are doing, but I miss you more than I ever thought I would.  I feel like I should have fought harder for whatever fucked up relationship we had.  I refuse to tell you how much you mean to me in a bloody letter (that you’ll probably never even receive) so you’ll just need to drag your arse back to find out.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Despairingly,</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>
  <em>Draco,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Well, as predicted, the owl was unable to reach you again.  Honestly, I’m not sure if I’m relieved or disappointed.  My head is a mess and I go through so many emotions from one minute to the next that it’s impossible to decide.  I don’t know when or even if you’ll read this, but there’s really no other way to say this than to just spit it out.  You’re a father.  Shocking, isn’t it?  Imagine my surprise as I wasn’t even aware it was possible.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Caelum James Black was born on the 10<sup>th</sup> of March 2000.  It’s been a few weeks and it still seems unreal.  Most of the time he looks like a tiny version of you with silver eyes and a head full of blond hair.  I say most of the time because not only did he inherit your looks, but he’s also a Metamorphmagus which I attribute to your Black blood.  Makes it even more appropriate I didn’t saddle him with the Potter or Malfoy name I suppose.   </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Caelum is, so far, a very quiet, happy baby.  He rarely fusses and almost sleeps through the night.  All things considered, I’m pretty lucky.  Never imagined I’d be a single dad at 19 but I wouldn’t change a thing.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I don’t go out much and if I do it is normally to the Muggle world, so his birth has remained a secret.  Poppy helped with the delivery and prenatal visits but never asked questions about the other father even after Caelum was born with obvious Malfoy features.  Hermione and Ron know the full story and the rest of the Weasleys suspect but I think Mione and Ron told them to leave off as they’ve never outright asked.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I don’t know what else to say except to again tell you how much I miss you and how much I wish you were here.  At the same time, I understand why you felt you had to go and I’m proud of you for following your heart.  I hope wherever you are that you are happy and well.  </em>

</p><p>
  <em>Today is Caelum’s first birthday.  This year has been crazy.  The Prophet finally got wind I had a child but since Caelum changes his appearance to whoever happens to be holding him they assume I got some random woman pregnant and that she left me and the baby.  Current money is on the idea that she is a Muggle and couldn’t handle the Metamorphmagus trait.  She was obliviated, never to be heard from again.  I see no reason to set the record straight as the only person who I’d care about knowing the truth is you and since you can’t receive my owls, I highly doubt you receive any gossip from the Prophet.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>As I said, today is Caelum’s birthday.  We had a small gathering at the Burrow just to get everyone together.  He’s still too young to know what a party is.  It was great to have the entire family together again though.  The Weasley’s have adopted him much like they did me.  Caelum’s favorite seems to be Charlie as he brings all kinds fun dragon toys and books.  As cliché as it sounds, dragons are Caelum’s favorite.  </em>
</p><p><em> </em> <em>He is growing so fast.  I still find it hard to believe we have a son.  I only wish you were here to watch him grow alongside me.  Maybe next year you will celebrate his 2<sup>nd</sup> birthday with us.  </em></p><p>

  <em>Draco, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Here we are at Caelum’s 2<sup>nd</sup> birthday.  We had it at the Burrow again and this year he was in his element.  I wish you could have seen the joy on his face as he opened his presents.  All of the Weasley’s were there again, as well as a few of our classmates.  Caelum fell asleep about halfway through the day as he normally does but I’ve gotten so comfortable with only being around those who know about you that I didn’t think twice about him falling asleep and his normal features returning.   I know that no one there would even think about betraying my privacy, but I have to admit I was overtaken by panic when I realized he was laying there in full view of all with his distinctive blond hair poking out of the blanket.  Luna was next to me and quickly gathered him up saying she was going to put him down in a bedroom away from all the noise.  She asked me to grab his dragon plushy and point her in which way to go. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>We spent the next hour sitting on the floor of Ron’s old room talking about you.  I haven’t talked to anyone about you in so long and it was quite therapeutic.  Once I began talking about you everything came pouring out.  I told her about Hogwarts, how you felt you had to get away and make something of yourself beyond the Malfoy name, how shocked I was to discover that I was pregnant, and how I haven’t been able to let you know anything about your amazing boy yet.  She told me how you saved her life and sanity during her imprisonment at the manor.  How you’d take down blankets, sneak in extra food, pass along nutrient potions, and how you brewed a potion that saved Ollivander’s life when he got sick.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>We laughed about things that happened through the years at Hogwarts and how no one would believe we shared a son even with proof.  It’s too extraordinary.  We cried at the things we’ve been through and over the fact that our world was so full of hate and finger pointing you felt the need to get away from it so strongly and it is causing you to miss this time with a little boy who is so full of love and joy and promise of a bright future.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I know this letter is supposed to tell you all kinds of trivial stuff about your son and how much he’s changed this year, but I can’t bring myself to change what I’ve said.  I miss you so fucking much, Draco.</em>

  <em>Draco, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Reasoning with a 3-year-old is tough.  Reasoning with a 3-year-old that shares our stubbornness, determination, and manipulation skills is useless.  I love our son with everything I am, but Godric’s sweaty ball sack, the child is a force to be reckoned with.  He’s old enough now to maintain whatever face he chooses almost all day.  As he spends almost all day every day with me, normally he sports messy black hair and green eyes.  When he gets upset his hair will change colors so fast you can barely figure out what it’s changing to before it changes to another.   When he gets tired it will flicker back and forth slowly fading until I see the same little boy I tuck into bed at night.  Although he spends most of his waking hours changing his features, you still shine through in his personality.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He has been begging to go see Uncle Charlie’s dragons.  We’ve all tried explaining that the dragons are not Uncle Charlie’s pets as he assumes he can bring a pet dragon home like Uncle Charlie.  As I said, reasoning with him is impossible.  I’ve banged my head against the wall so many times with this child it’s not even funny.  We leave this weekend to spend a few nights on the preserve and hopefully it will alleviate some of the desire for a dragon of his own at least until next year.  Merlin, I hope he’s easier to argue with next year.  Fuck, who am I kidding?  He’s only going to get more obstinate, isn’t he?  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>His birthday this year was quite a mess.  He requested it to be a dragon cake and thanks to Fred and George (sarcasm intended) it moved and blew fire.  As you can imagine, the only thing an adventurous lover of dragons can do is attempt to ride and tame the wild beast.  With accidental magic and a will as strong as his, it was easy to go from the chair he was sitting in to the back of the dragon in his heroic feat of bravery.  The poor cake didn’t have a chance and was flattened almost instantly.  I think I’ll be cleaning cake out of his hair and ears for a few days to come.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>After his party he asked to spend the night with Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron.  It’s his first sleepover and while I’m nervous, it’s also a relief to let my guard down and relax.  It’s been a long 3 years.  I cracked open a bottle of Firewhiskey and put on your new album just to hear your voice.  You are really making something of yourself and blazing your own path.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m glad you’re doing well.  As much as it hurts that you aren’t here, it is comforting to at least know you are alive and thriving.  I’ll be honest with you, as I don’t even know if you’ll ever come home to get these letters, and say that while most of me understands why you left, a part of me is bitter and angry.  It took me awhile to even admit that to myself.  Most of the time the anger doesn’t even cross my mind but then there are times when I want to scream and yell at you for everything you’ve missed and for me going through this alone.  Maybe I shouldn’t have said that and simply kept this letter Caelum related, but like I said, who’s to say you’ll ever come back here?  All these years and I still miss and love you just the same as I did the day you walked away.  I always told myself I’d never tell you that in a letter.  That you deserved to hear it to your face.  Yet, I’m bitter and just drunk enough tonight to ask myself why I keep putting what you deserve in front of what I deserve.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Fuck.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Anyway, your son is 3 and I’m bloody wasted.  Cheers.</em>

  <em>I’ve been waiting for this for 4 years and you’d think I’d have the answers to give but I don’t.  Caelum asked today at his birthday party where his mum was.  He’s finally putting together family dynamics since Bill and Fleur have had a baby and soon Hermione will as well.  I kind of choked and didn’t know what to say or do.  Luna (I’m convinced she’s a gift from the gods) stepped in and told him how some children have one mum or one dad and some have two mums or two dads and all kinds of other combinations that I’m pretty sure only make sense to Luna.  She then told him about his brave Dragon Daddy.  How he was hurt after some bad things happened and he needed some time to get better before he flew back into our lives.  That one day his Dragon Daddy would be back to tell him all about his adventures and have tales of far off lands.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Somehow Caelum’s birthday party became an all-out story fest about you.  We talked about your Potter Stinks badges, your Quidditch skills, your thirst for knowledge, how proud you were to be a Slytherin, and how much family meant to you.  Hermione told him how you saved our lives in the Manor and Luna agreed and shared her story too. Then Fred told everyone that you were the one to shield him from an explosion during the final battle.  He said that had you not, he would have been crushed and died for sure as the ground he had been standing on was utterly destroyed. No one knew how close we had come to losing him.  It was a pretty solemn party for a while.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Thankfully, before long Caelum’s attention diverted to when he could open presents and the topic dropped until I tucked him into bed tonight.  He told me that next year he wasn’t asking for anything for his birthday except for his Dragon Daddy to come home so he could have a piece of cake with him and learn about all his brave adventures.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>So here I sit almost 5 years later, and I can’t help but hope his wish comes true so I can see you again. </em>

</p><p>Draco was at a loss for words.  He looked at the bottom of the box and saw the book Harry mentioned in the first letter.  As he opened it he saw glimpses into his son’s life.  So many pictures filled the pages.  Some from the day he was born, some from birthday parties and holidays.  As the pages turned and he watched his son grow up in pictures before him.  Closer to the back there were additions of artwork and anecdotes from day to day life written among the pages.  This was his son.  He had missed out on so much and he was so angry at himself for the choices that had lead him away from the child.  He started sobbing and screaming out his anger at the universe.  After he had worn himself out and ran out of tears he realized that there was nothing to say to make it better or erase the past but there was the possibility to have a future together. </p><p> </p><p>With that thought in mind he wiped his face off and summoned parchment and a quill to pen his reply.  He told Harry he’d meet him at the Leaky at 8:30 and they could decide where to go to talk from there.  He called for an elf to take the letter to the owlery and spent the rest of the night rereading the letters and going through the scrapbook countless times. </p>
