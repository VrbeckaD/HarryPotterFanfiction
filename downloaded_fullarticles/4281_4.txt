    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Draco carefully edged forward, avoiding the short, plump, middle-aged witch queueing in front of him. She wasn’t particularly pleasant smelling, and she had a rather large, mangled kneazle wrapped about her shoulders. It regarded Draco suspiciously with a slitted green eye, as if waiting for him to make a move so it had reason to attack him. It reminded Draco a bit of the feline that followed Granger around in third year, but perhaps with a better temperament. He was never much one to have pets, and could hardly see why one would want to have such a beast invading your personal space.</p>
<p>The line shifted and shuffled forward a few inches. There couldn’t be anything more frustrating than waiting in Customs to return to England. Draco withheld a petulant sigh and checked his pocket watch again. He still had plenty of time until his portkey activated, but at the rate the line moved, he might very well end up saying in Paris overnight again, which was less than desirable.</p>
<p>Perhaps not. There was that young wizard he had met last summer; he lived in the city, and might be up for a little fun to waste the day. Tempting, especially considering the arse on him, but Draco knew the sooner he got back into London, the better.</p>
<p>Draco had spent the better part of five years in pursuit of his Potions Mastery. He was impatient and ready to move forward with his life. There was only so much hiding away with Mother on the Riviera he could stand before the beautiful view got the best of him, and he had to return home. If for no other reason but to breathe the air, stand in the rain, and avoid eye-contact with strangers like a proper British gentlewizard. Not that he didn’t appreciate how affectionate the French were (especially the nightlife, where he had sewn his oats and made a name for himself in the society pages), but it was time to grow up and return to London.</p>
<p>He had a contact in Knockturn Alley, not quite on the wrong side of the war, but still very much sympathetic to pureblood wizards, who was retiring and willing to sell his shop, including the flat above it, for a reasonable enough price. Draco had just enough leftover of his inheritance (war reparations had quite drained the Malfoy vaults) to be able to purchase it and have it updated. He fancied hiring a witch or wizard to work the counter so he could concentrate on the actual potion-making, but he had yet to feel out the political climate of London to know if he was still the pariah he was when he left in September of 1998.</p>
<p>It was strange to think that that much time had passed. Some days, the war still felt like a fresh wound, and Draco kept a mind healer on call in the case of a resurgence of his nightmares. They had gotten better since he had begun to take his sessions seriously, but occasionally the nightmares would be triggered by something innocuous, a pile of furniture in an antique shop, a dead bird in the street, or even when the floo fire would burn too loudly. It had felt ridiculous to have such reactions, but he had learned that there were things about the mind that were beyond the scope of what was commonly taught to wizards, things that weren’t of magic, but of delicate brain chemistry and electrical impulses.</p>
<p>It had fascinated him to learn that a neural pathway of thinking and feeling was forged in the midst of trauma, and could be triggered by simple visual or auditory association, and that forged pathway would fire again, causing the same body sensations, emotions, and base reactions that occurred during the trauma. He took this knowledge and began to study neuroscience, <em>muggle</em> advances in neuroscience, alongside his potions work, and it brought him further along in his quest to create safe potions for wizards to recover from PTSD, and others to aid in Dreamless Sleep or other opiate addictions.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, he began to discover the vast knowledge of muggle science about the brain, and it began to obliterate the protective walls he had built around his ingrained ideology. Muggles and wizards had so many similar chemicals in their brains, it began to make less and less sense to hate them. Sometimes he would get stuck in the turmoil of his childhood teachings, seeing how wrong his family was. The shift in thinking happened so fast it had given him panic attacks regularly. <br/>He felt he had made progress, but there was still so much to learn, and he felt coming home to London would provide him more opportunities to work with war survivors than in France.</p>
<p>But he was still unsure how his reception would go.</p>
<p>Draco finally stood in front of the dour looking French customs wizard, holding out his passport. He stood perfectly at attention, holding his face neutral, while the attendant leafed through the booklet, pausing when he reached the page stamped with red block letters stating, <em>Former Death Eater</em>. Draco suppressed a sigh, preparing for a line of humiliating questioning or even being taken to a small room and his belongings searched. However, the wizard just regarded him with the usual distaste the French reserved for the English, and flicked his wand idly, stamping the booklet and handing it back. Draco had to almost shake himself in surprise before he took his passport back, picked up his satchel, and moved through a low, foul-smelling carpeted hallway to the office where he retrieved his portkey.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, he found himself in Knockturn Alley in front of a smartly polished storefront, in sharp contrast with the surrounding shops. He revolved slowly, inhaling the sharp smell of smog, sage, ale, and the faintest hint of urine (but not nearly as strong as the smell in Paris). There were still a few of the usual suspects in the remaining shops, but most of the older, Pureblood businesses had left soon after the war; it was easier to leave willingly with their dignity intact than to let their businesses to go under. Mother had kept tabs on such things- that was how Draco had the good fortune of learning about the space that would now be his livelihood and his home.</p>
<p>He had hired a small local company of freed House Elves to re-establish the magic core of the building and clear it so he would be accepted as the new owner. It had taken several weeks, but Flipsy, a relative of an elder Elf that had been with the Malfoys for generations, had appeared earlier in the week to announce that the shop was, ‘as fresh as a wee baby, Flipsy made sure for Master Draco- the flat is being to his liking.’ Flipsy was a proud Elf who had built her little crew of freed Elves into something that still filled their ingrained need to help wizards, yet worked by their own leave, and had an impeccable reputation.</p>
<p>Draco twirled his wand and cast the unlocking charm, swinging the door wide open. He stepped in and smiled with satisfaction. Flipsy did indeed ‘make it being to his liking’- it was polished and airy, the reception area fitted with nice contemporary chairs and a sofa made of leather, a bronze coffee table with reading material, and quite a few flowering plants and herbs. The counter was made of rich mahogany, which was offset by a bronze rail and polished ancient wide floorboards. The floating chandeliers burned softly, giving the room a warm welcoming feel. He could sense the building feeling him out, and sighing around him. He could feel its immediate acceptance of him as he moved to the back rooms to see his lab area. The rooms were stark white and stainless steel in contrast to the front and still empty of his equipment, which should be arriving the next day. He preferred to set that up himself.</p>
<p>Draco was quite pleased with the results. He vowed to send the Elf more business as well as increase her payment by another 20 vials of Moonstone potion. He moved further back into the shop to a green door charmed closed by a familiar ward. He easily opened it, sliding through, and ascended the steps to his new home.</p>
<p><em>Okay, maybe another 30 vials,</em> he thought, whistling lowly at the minimalist but aesthetically pleasing parlor. The furnishings were modern and expensive, sleek and refined without that old-world feel that seemed to suffocate Draco when he was surrounded by it. There was a wireless built in above the floo, and a muggle television set in the corner on a glass shelf. A plush and inviting large white rug occupied the open space at the hearth. Draco couldn’t help kneeling down in the centre of it and sliding down to his belly, threading his fingers through the pile until he was spread like a starfish, snuggling into the softness. It was perfect. After a moment, he rolled over to take in the rest of the room. A slim bookcase lined the East wall, the shopfront, with windows on either side of it. He slowly rose, pulling his wand and moving the bookcase aside to reveal his Pensieve in the recess, surrounded by tiny shelves full of empty vials, waiting to filled with memories.</p>
<p>The bedroom was simple, it was furnished with his heirloom four-poster bed, matching writing desk, and wardrobe. They were the only furnishings he had kept from the manor- because of his Godfather and Mother’s protection, his rooms were kept untarnished by the Dark Lord, and he held the memories of his sanctuary during the Occupation dearly. It was a feeling of coming home, something inexplicable, something he hadn’t anticipated. It was the safest he had felt in years- a bubble around him- he hadn’t even braved the streets of Diagon Alley yet, it could be an absolute shitstorm. But for the moment, it was peace and quiet. Draco threw himself on the bed, kicked off his shoes, twisted the duvet around himself, and fell into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>Draco snorted and sat up. The sun was low in the sky as it peeked through his curtained windows. He sat very still, waiting for the sound that woke him to come again. <br/>The chime of the floo sounded again.</p>
<p>Draco blinked in confusion. He hadn’t even been here for a full day. How could anyone have his floo address?</p>
<p>He spelled his hair back in place and straightened himself before kneeling again on the luxurious rug to answer.</p>
<p>“Draco, darling, you absolute shit, you answer me right now!”</p>
<p>Draco grinned, recognizing Pansy Parkinson’s shrill voice anywhere. He opened the floo and moved so she could step out onto the rug.</p>
<p>Pansy looked around and sucked in a breath. “Very nice, dear, why are you on the floor and not getting me a drink?”</p>
<p>Draco laughed and stretched out on his side, looking up at her indulgently.</p>
<p>“Get yourself a drink, Pans, but you’ll have to do it elsewhere, seeing as I haven’t stocked up the shelves yet.”</p>
<p>“What? That’s obviously the first thing you do when settling into a new place not…” She gave him a once-over. “No, Draco, did you take a nap? You’ve wrinkled your waistcoat, come here.”</p>
<p>She reached a hand out to pull him up and he smirked, pulling her down onto the carpet.</p>
<p>“Hey! Blast it, Draco, do you have any idea how-” She patted the rug. “What is this? It’s simply wonderful.”</p>
<p>Soon they were lying side by side, chatting idly about the weather, the latest gossip, and plans for dinner. Pansy wasn’t going to be in town but for the night, she had a gala in Paris the following day. Draco was grateful for her company, even if all she did was complain. Her presence was particularly appreciated considering she was very busy running a small French publication and freelancing for <em>The Daily Profit</em>. Her reports of London when she visited him were often not welcome though, and Draco had been known to silence her and even threaten to hex her when she would slyly turn the conversation toward a certain green-eyed Savior of the Wizarding World. It’s not that he <em>cared</em> so much about what Harry Potter was doing with his life, it was that he didn’t need Pansy’s endless teasing and suggestive remarks. <em>So what</em> if he <em>used to be</em> a <em>tiny bit</em> obsessive about the bespeckled git. But that was <em>years</em> ago, and he was <em>totally</em> over that nonsense, and besides… <br/>He realized belatedly how defensive he was sounding in his own mind. And Pansy had said his name twice.</p>
<p>“Draco?” she drawled a third time, rolling to look at him, eyebrow arched delicately over carefully applied and blended eyeshadow. “Where are you, darling? I was just telling you about Blaise’s new wench and you’re miles away.”</p>
<p>“Just thinking about what I’m wearing to dinner.” He stood, starting to unbutton his waistcoat and heading to his wardrobe. Pansy stretched on the rug like a cat and pointed the toe of an extremely high heel in his direction.</p>
<p>“Wear the dark blue on blue bespoke, darling,” she winked, “I want you to compliment my new Ferragamos.”</p>
<p>He smirked back at her before dropping his trousers and levitating them to drape over his desk chair. His wardrobe doors opened, the racks sliding out smoothly, his suits swinging gently. He <em>Accio’d</em> the blue Armani and his matching navy shoes, hitting them with a refreshing spell, and a gentle spritz of a home brewed cologne that Pansy said was ‘pants-dropping’ and dressed quickly. Their reservation was for 8 o’clock, and if they were even one minute late, they would lose it. Momo was a very exclusive wizard/muggle fine dining restaurant. Pansy knew the family well, but even that wouldn’t keep them from getting bumped from the reserved table to the bar. Draco would never hear the end of it if Pansy would have to climb a barstool and let her legs dangle from such a height. Poor dear was barely tall enough to reach the bar without the shoes, and she was not fond of swinging her legs like a first year on the train on the way to school. He straightened his tie and smoothed his trembling hands over the jacket. He had many reasons to be nervous, but being out in muggle London was substantially safer than wizarding London.</p>
<p>Pansy came in behind him, a glass of wine in hand, nodding appreciatively.</p>
<p>“Nice, love it, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Where’d the wine come from?” He wasn’t surprised she had found it, he thought he just might need a drink before leaving.</p>
<p>“I just mumbled aloud that I needed a drink and a panel in the wall slid to the side and a fully-stocked bar appeared!”</p>
<p>Draco grinned, moving to get himself a glass of Merlot that had been left out to breathe. “Flipsy really thought of everything. I really need to get the word around about her skills.”</p>
<p>“It seems so odd having to actually <em>pay</em> for a House Elf’s services.” Pansy wrinkled her nose. She looked at the glass in her hand thoughtfully. “However, the autonomy has done wonders for their ingenuity, so I say <em>Viva la Revolution!</em>” She raised her glass to clink Draco’s. “Next article I write will be a flattering review of this flat, Draco, I hope you don’t mind. I think more wizards would get on board with Elves’ rights if they saw the benefits.”</p>
<p>“You sound like a bloody Gryffindor, Pans,” Draco teased, “Careful with all that compassion, people will think you’re losing your touch.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes and plucked the half-empty glass from his hand and set it down. Then she gripped his arm and pulled him to the floo.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>Draco’s alarm went off several minutes after he awoke. His routine had finally been established enough that his circadian rhythm had adjusted itself and he had begun to feel settled. It had been three months since he had opened the shop’s doors, and <em>DM Potions</em> had become quite profitable quite quickly. Pansy dropping his name in an article in the society pages of the <em>Profit</em> had helped announce his return in a positive light. Her article not only reduced the number of dirty looks he got on the street, but also made a nice ice-breaker at the few wizard gay clubs in the city. It seemed most were willing to put the past behind them, which was a relief to Draco, but there were a few wizards he picked up who just wanted to get a peek at his Dark Mark, fetishizing it. Nothing made Draco limp quicker than the adoration of the biggest mistake he’d ever made, so in the end, his encounters were mostly done in the dark corners of a club or in the loo, not ideal, but he was far from looking for romance; he had more important work to do.</p>
<p>By the time he arrived down the stairs he was clad in his white lab robes. Angelica Burke, a great grandniece of Caractacus Burke, one of the original owners of Borgin and Burke’s, was already stationed at her post, coffee made, ambient music playing, and nose buried in a tattered copy of <em>Witch Weekly</em>.</p>
<p>“Morning, Mr. Malfoy,” she chimed, without looking up, “Fancy a cuppa?”</p>
<p>“No thank you, Angelica.” He had already given up his inadvisable attempt at helping her refine her manners; her pureblood status wasn’t an assurance of excellent deportment and grace. Her parents had died in the war (two of many who dared fail the Dark Lord at a simple but impossible task), and she had been raised in her second cousin’s halfblood household. Her hair was cut in a short blonde bob and she wore one too many pairs of Lovegood’s original earrings, but her clothing was always stylish and neat- usually in the muggle-popular trend known as ‘goth’. Fortunately, her goth ensembles leaned toward long, lacy, and high-collared robes, which was easily mistaken by elder wizards and witches as vintage dress robes, so Draco allowed it. The black lipstick was something else altogether- Pansy had whined about the youth of London and fashion for nearly an hour after meeting her. But he liked Angelica immediately when she came to interview for the job; her sunny attitude and mastery of sarcasm made her able to handle all sorts of customers- tetchy housewives hounding her for their monthly sedative potions, elder purebloods with their noses in the air, or even young troublemakers thinking they could steal something or harass his shop. She was invaluable to him.</p>
<p>Sighing, he made his way back to his lab. Everything was in order, everything in its place. It was shiny and smelled faintly of cleaning spells. He checked the list of prescriptions due for the week and saw that each had already been filled. Then he checked his stock of standard potions- Dreamless Sleep, Skele-gro, Pepper-up, and the like. He found his stock satisfactory, and went to the vast cupboards of ingredients and smiled to himself. Today day would be a good day to brew.</p>
<p>Draco stood at the bench mixing a potion. Carefully stirring a glass rod counterclockwise at 120 rotations per minute for 3 minutes, he allowed his mind to wander as he was relaxed and familiar with the base of a new experiment he had been working on. It was still a few hours until he took tea; at exactly one o’clock, he left the shop and walked through Diagon Alley to the Leaky Cauldron. He’d have a late lunch, a cup of tea, perhaps read the <em>Profit</em> if they weren’t being too preachy, or the <em>Quibbler</em>, if they weren’t being too weird, and relax for an hour. Then at two on the dot, he paid his bill and returned to the shop to complete the second half of the day. Angelica worked until four and he minded the counter himself until closing at six. He insisted on personally working the counter because staying in touch with his customers was important to him, as was staying visible in the community. Knockturn Alley was no longer just a dank hidey-hole of Dark magic, it was now home to legitimate businesses that worked in the Dark Arts (not all that is Dark is evil), as well as antiques and curse-breakers, and of course his potions shop.</p>
<p>On weekdays, after closing the doors and straightening the shop for the next day, he’d retire to his flat, cook a light supper, and settle in for the night, usually reading or watching the telly. Weekends meant going to a club and trying to pull, but that was part of the routine as well. Everything was level, all was in its place, and nothing was a surprise.</p>
<p>And he was so dreadfully bored he felt like screaming.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>Draco’s break for tea came late that day.</p>
<p>It was nearly two thirty by the time he headed to the Leaky Cauldron, smile on his face and hope in his heart. He had just had a session with a young witch who was suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress. She was intelligent and interested in helping him test his new variant of Dreamless Sleep. It was made of all non-addictive ingredients, but he needed to know how effective it was using it for more than a few nights in a row. She was more than willing- after kicking a Dreamless Sleep addiction, she suffered from insomnia, and was miserable.</p>
<p>It was because of his good mood that Draco didn’t notice Harry Potter seated in the back, reading and sipping tea. Hannah Abbott, having taken over ownership from Tom some years ago, seated Draco and took his order. That was when he finally noticed him.</p>
<p>Draco’s heart first seemed to stutter slightly and then it started pounding. A cold sweat broke out across his back, and his hands trembled. He closed his eyes, breathing deeply, using techniques his mind-healer taught him to prevent a panic attack.</p>
<p>
  <em>I am here in my body, it is now not then, I am who I am, not who I was.</em>
</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and took a long look at his former foe.</p>
<p>Potter looked much the same as the last time Draco saw him. He had been leaving the courtroom, having just testified on behalf of the Malfoys, and he never even shot a look in Draco’s direction. His clothing seemed to hang on his frame, too skinny as always, and his hair was messy and glasses round. Today, he looked no different, same glasses even. Draco nearly cried out an incredulous, <em>what?</em> But he managed to reel it back and stare, dazed, at the exact antithesis of the Harry Potter of his mind.</p>
<p>That Potter was wealthy and famous, still the Ministry’s Golden Boy, married to the Weaslette, a swath of children who looked just like him, and paparazzi following him around. Dressed to the nines in all the designer labels, and cutting the ribbon on new orphanages and foundations for this or that. Not this broken-looking skinny man who looked as if a shower and a nap would barely dent the exhaustion he wore around him like a cloak. It was more than disturbing.</p>
<p>He had to go say something.</p>
<p>What the devil would he even say to him? ‘Good to see you Potter, you ever planning to give back my wand, are you free for dinner, fancy going back to my place for a shag?’ Ridiculous! He’d spent the last five years avoiding hearing any word about the wizard, the last thing he needed now was to confront him with a confused swirl of questions.</p>
<p>He realized he was halfway to Potter’s table without meaning to be. He thought to turn back, but Potter had seen him, tilting his head and regarding Draco warily, no surprise. Of course he knew Draco was back, everyone read the <em>Profit</em>, and the gossip mills did what they did.</p>
<p>“Hello, Potter,” Draco said, heart pounding, trying for casual, “how have you been?”</p>
<p>Potter looked back at him in, pursing his lips. “Malfoy, I just saw you last week, what are you on about?”</p>
<p>Draco blushed at Potter’s tone, and it took a second for his brain to catch up with the present.</p>
<p>“Last week? I’m sorry, did I miss you at the shop?”</p>
<p>Potter narrowed his eyes and nearly growled back. “I don’t have time for your shit, <em>Malfoy</em>,” he spat, “I’m very busy these days, and aren’t you supposed to be on the way to France or something? Much like a rat leaving a sinking ship?”</p>
<p>Draco’s felt his face fall into his old default setting: cold and sneering. “Sorry for disturbing your lunch, oh Great Savior, didn’t mean to disrupt your obvious trip around the bend. Allow me to take my leave of you, so your hoards of fans can get your autograph.” He waved an arm around the nearly empty pub. “<em>Obviously</em>, they’re falling over themselves to get near the Golden Boy.”</p>
<p>Potter suddenly looked ill. “Are there people really out there?” His tone changed so drastically, Draco wondered for a moment if he’d imagined it. <br/>“Are you okay, Potter? You look positively-”</p>
<p>A gentle hand landed on Draco’s shoulder from behind. He turned and blinked into the eyes of Hermione Granger, a smile on her lips, but a warning in her eyes.<br/>“Why hello Malfoy,” she intoned cheerily, eyes hardening, “would you care to join me for a moment at the bar?” He nodded dumbly. If anyone knew what was wrong with Potter, it would be Granger.</p>
<p>“I’ll just be a moment, Harry,” she smiled at Potter and practically dragged Draco across the room.</p>
<p>“Ouch, you’re pinching me!” Draco whispered furiously. “I can walk on my own, you know.”</p>
<p>Granger sighed when they reached their destination and turned back toward Potter. Weasley had arrived as well (typical- can’t have one without the other two thirds of the Golden Trio), and had made a beeline to Potter, stepping in the way of his glare locked on Draco.</p>
<p>“What the bloody hell is happening here?” He felt the closest to losing his temper in years- he composed himself quickly and turned to Hannah. She had a firewhiskey at the ready, and he took it gratefully, drinking it quickly.</p>
<p>Hannah Abbott had been wonderful to Draco in the last few months since he had returned to London. Not only had she treated him well the first time he walked into the Leaky Cauldron, she had been a good sounding board sometimes and was always quick to comfort with drink or good food. Her mince pies were things of legend and she always seemed to have fresh fruit on hand, even in the winter. He looked at her now, not sure where to start.</p>
<p>Granger came to the rescue, thankfully.</p>
<p>“Harry’s not been well.”</p>
<p>“Well, I can see that,” Draco snorted, putting his glass where Hannah could pour another. “He looks like he lost ten rounds with a hippogriff. What’s wrong with him?”</p>
<p>Hermione frowned deeply, but didn’t contradict him.</p>
<p>“Harry has experienced some sort of retrograde amnesia, and we aren’t exactly sure what caused it.”</p>
<p>“Amnesia? How much has he lost?”</p>
<p>Granger and Hannah exchanged a look.</p>
<p>“He thinks it’s October of 1998.”</p>
<p>Draco gaped at her. That was simply not possible. He had heard of people losing periods of time, but never had heard of someone stuck in a particular time.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s absurd.”</p>
<p>Hannah sighed. “But true nonetheless. He comes in every day and orders lunch at 2:30, eats, reads the same book, and disappears. It’s usually the same meal too, though I’m not sure he eats much at home.”</p>
<p>Granger was nodding. “Yes, Kreacher makes sure he eats at least one other time a day, but Harry is so stubborn when he wants to be, it’s hard to keep him still enough to eat.”<br/>Hannah hummed. “Every day when he comes in, he asks where Tom is, and I just say I’m subbing for him while he’s on vacation, though I bought the pub three years ago. It was like I inherited <em>him</em> from Tom.”</p>
<p>Draco just stared. “How can you be so casual about this! What the fuck, Granger??”</p>
<p>Hermione hushed him. “Language, please,” she admonished, “I’d assumed you knew about his stint in St. Mungo’s a few years back. The <em>Prophet</em> went on and on about it for the longest time. They basically leave him alone now, though it might be more out of pity. If it weren’t for Pansy, they’d probably be hounding him constantly.”<br/>Draco felt like he had walked into some alternate universe, or maybe it was him that had gone mad and the rest of them were just fine.</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, wait…” He held his hands up in protest. Both witches turned to him, eyebrows raised. It was almost too much, and Draco fought the urge to just walk out and never come back.</p>
<p>“So you know Pansy?” He asked after a long pause, trying to gather his thoughts.</p>
<p>Hermione looked confused. “Yes…” she cocked her head. “Oh yes, I guess you may not know that, since you’ve just returned. Pansy basically is the power behind the power at the <em>Prophet</em>, and I don’t even want to know what she has on the Chief Editor to keep him in line... But anyhow, what she says goes, and after inviting Pansy to lunch to see for herself, she swore to keep Harry’s condition out of the papers. It was quite big of her. I’m surprised she hasn’t mentioned it, I thought the two of you were best friends?”</p>
<p>Draco’s eye twitched. That sneaky trollop! How dare she… <br/>But no, it wasn’t Pansy’s fault. His vehement insistence of keeping Potter out of his life for the past years meant a huge loss of information.</p>
<p>He straightened himself up and sniffed, a mere shadow of his former composure. But he had to know.</p>
<p>“So Potter thinks I’m on my way to France. He believes he saw me earlier in the month?”</p>
<p>Hannah nodded. “Hmm. Yeah, poor sod. I know it had been fucking confusing for him. You look very different. Quite excellent, really,” she smirked at him.</p>
<p>“Down girl,” Hermione rolled her eyes. “I’m pretty sure Draco doesn't swing that way. Besides, wasn’t marriage supposed to tame you a bit?”</p>
<p>Hannah laughed and said something else, but Draco was lost in thought. He needed more information. He had to get over to the <em>Prophet</em> and go through their archives and see what the public knew. He had to grill Pansy. What had happened? Was it war trauma so great that he was suspended in time? He seemed to have his faculties about him. He was able to place who Draco was, and even knew about moving to France-</p>
<p>
  <em>Like a rat leaving a sinking ship?</em>
</p>
<p>What the fuck did that even mean? <em>Of course</em> Draco left England. There was no place for his family there, only pain and misery. What exactly was the sinking ship? There was something niggling at the back of his mind he couldn’t quite place. Obviously the rat comment was about his testimony about the remaining Death Eaters and possible safe houses. But that was supposed to be a good thing, right? It helped the Aurors in the end to find the remaining Dark Lord zealots and lock them up. Father had lost his sanity and was of little help, so his few remaining days were spent in Azkaban. Was that the sinking ship? He needed to get out of there.</p>
<p>“Is he here every day?” He suddenly spoke up, startling the witches who were deep in conversation.</p>
<p>Hannah nodded, a slight smirk on her face. “Mostly. He comes at 2:15 every day, stays to eat, and leaves. He’s missed only a few days in several years. Why, you thinking of stalking him?”</p>
<p>Draco stuttered. “No, I assume if you read the article Pansy published, you’d know that I’m not only dealing in potions, but I’m researching alternatives to the antiquated treatments used in cases of mental health. I’m merely interested on an academic level. I would like to watch him in interest of a case study.”</p>
<p>Hermione looked thoughtful. “I did read something about that. And that paper you published in <em>Wizard Psychology Today.</em></p>
<p>“You read that?” Draco was surprised- it was a fairly small publication.</p>
<p>“Yes, and I found it very interesting. Your theories on using talk therapy mixed with work on the magical core through potions and behavioral practise is fascinating.”</p>
<p>Draco couldn’t help but feel a small swell of pride being complimented by the only student in his year who could best his scores. “Thank you, Granger.” He said, flushing slightly. The day kept getting more odd by the moment. But he supposed that was the norm when it came to Potter.</p>
<p>“Please, I think we’re long past formal names, and besides, it’s Granger-Weasley. Call me Hermione.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Draco blinked, trying to process what was happening. “Wait, you’re married? How did Potter attend the wedding?”</p>
<p>“Well, at times we intervene and explain what has happened to him. Sometimes it just takes a simple ‘spell damage’ explanation. He buys it, and he can relax for the event.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you do it every day?”</p>
<p>“We tried.” Hermione looked tired and guilty. “But it became really hard to do with job, family… It is a losing battle, and allowing him to settle into his routine seems to be when he’s the most balanced.”</p>
<p>Draco had so many questions. It was a bit overwhelming. And of course all he could ask was, “What do you tell him about the weather?”</p>
<p>Hannah chuckled. “Actually, that’s a conversation I have with him almost daily. He believes it’s October 30th, so when it’s either too hot or too cold for October, we say ‘what odd weather we have now because of Global Warming.’ It seems to do the trick. Sometimes I wonder if some things don’t just stick in his brain somewhere so it makes it easier for him to believe things.”</p>
<p>Draco nodded, biting his lip. “Yes, perhaps. Why do you think the 30th of October?”</p>
<p>Hermione looked sad. “It’s the day before the anniversary of Voldemort killing his Parents. He talks about his plans to visit their grave the next day, but of course, the next day never comes.”</p>
<p>“And he just doesn’t notice the leaves on the trees or Christmas decorations, or anything?”</p>
<p>“We think he just doesn’t <em>want</em> to notice them. He has the path he takes, and he doesn’t look beyond that. We keep an eye out, well, us and Kreacher, and the best we can do is keep him safe and watch for changes.”</p>
<p>He needed to leave and think. “Hermione, Hannah, I was lovely to see you, thank you for explaining the...situation with Po- Harry.” It felt odd in his mouth. Softer. More intimate.</p>
<p>He left the shop with a lot on his mind. It was possible he could learn a lot from this as a case study, and help Potter in the process.</p>
<p>And maybe get his old wand back.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the wand Draco had made in France wasn’t good enough, it just wasn’t...right. He would find himself longing for the unicorn core magic during brewing. The purity of the unicorn hair made delicate potions easier to create, where as, his elm and dragon heartstring was more forceful.</p>
<p>Draco wanted it back very badly.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>The next day found Draco stalling before leaving to get tea. He busied himself with reorganizing the shop, but Angelica began to get suspicious.</p>
<p>“Mr. Malfoy, aren’t you going to leave for lunch?” She stood in the doorway, crossing her arms over her crushed velvet black laced corset. Her eyes were lined to a peak at the corners, giving her a cat-like appearance.</p>
<p>“Angelica, not that it’s any of your concern, but I will take my lunch today at 2.”</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t have to do with that being the same time Harry Potter is there every day?”</p>
<p>He spun to her smirking face, hiding his surprise behind an indifferent mask. “Is it common knowledge that he dines there the same time every day?” He didn’t bother to hide his intention- Angelica’s taunting would be worse if he denied it.</p>
<p>“It is. He’s been doing it for years. I heard you and he had quite the thing for each other in school.”</p>
<p>He snorted inelegantly. “Is that what the kids call ‘pure unadulterated hate’ these day?”</p>
<p>“From what I hear there was a lot more going on there. Didn’t you save his life?”</p>
<p>Draco flashed back to the Manor, Harry’s puffy face inches from his, eyes pleading. His heart rate sped up and a fine sweat broke out on his brow. Not the time.</p>
<p>“Well, yes, but he returned the favor soon after, so we’re even. Don’t you have some sort of responsibilities here? Why is it I pay you again?”</p>
<p>She grinned. “For my scintillating personality and stimulating company, of course.” She turned and flounced out of the room.</p>
<p>He smirked. “Of course,” he called after her retreating back. He checked the time, removed his lab robes and hung them neatly on the hook by the door. Smoothing down the front of his dove-gray waistcoat, he pulled on his jacket and straightened his lavender tie. Saying a quick almost embarrassed farewell to Angelica, he made his way to Diagon. <br/>He thought over his strategy. He would arrive early, about 2pm, eat so he could focus on Potter, and simply observe until he left.</p>
<p>Hannah was behind the bar, as usual, and she tipped him a knowing smile and started his tea. He took a table near the back, but far enough away to be able to see where Harry would be seated. Hannah soon levitated his lunch to him- pastrami on rye and a green salad- and left him to his devices.</p>
<p>At about 2:15, Harry Potter walked in. He took his seat, greeted Hannah, exchanged pleasantries with her (Draco heard ‘strange weather’ and ‘is Tom sick?’), and open his book and begin to read. It was hard to make out the title, so Draco cast a quick charm to see at that distance. <em>A Timeless Love,</em> by Kairos Black. Draco had never heard of it, but it sounded like a trashy romance novel written by a relative of Draco’s. He supposed it made sense; Harry was living in the remnants of the Black family home, there was bound to be shelves and shelves of tomes in there. He wondered if it was the same book every day.</p>
<p>Harry sat quietly and sipped his tea.</p>
<p>Draco simply sat, watched his subject, observed and took notes. If he didn’t know better, he’d think the most famous wizard in history was just having lunch, no big deal. After finishing a small mince pie, Potter remained for another 20 minutes, leafing through the book, not settling on any particular page, and finally stood to leave. Potter made his way to the bar, passed Hannah with a goodbye, and headed to the floo. Draco kept his distance, staying behind a column, and listened for his destination.</p>
<p>Harry scooped a handful of powder. “12 Grimmauld Place!” he said loudly, disappearing in a swath of green flames.</p>
<p>Draco nodded at Hannah and stood by the floo. Should he follow? He very well couldn’t come bursting through Potter’s floo, besides, the wards were probably up. He could apparate there, but he was unsure of the location. He would have to contact Mother for the address through the floo, but he was in no mood to be given the third degree about this strange encounter with Potter.</p>
<p>Eventually he sighed. He guessed it was enough for the day and he could head back to the shop. He did have responsibilities, after all.</p>
<p>The walk back seemed quicker than usual. Facing his storefront, he hesitated. Angelica was tending to an elderly witch, showing her the written instructions that had been sent by her healer. Draco watched, his eyes wandering, taking in everything. The clean lines, the inviting waiting area, the professional atmosphere.</p>
<p>And above it, his home. It was hard to believe Potter didn’t have this. Not a Potions Shop, of course, but a present. Something he had worked for. Something that proved he had moved on in life, moved forward. Proof that life meant change, and that he could change, be <em>more.</em></p>
<p>Draco released a heavy sigh, his thoughts turning melancholy. Potter had missed so much of his own life. He’d only just discovered the wizarding world at 11, then to be frozen in time only seven years later? It was unfair. He couldn’t imagine the depth of Potter’s day-to-day loneliness. How was he able to exist on just one day out of the last five years?</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Gathering his courage, Draco stood and slowly approached Potter’s table. He wasn’t sure how to act. He didn’t want another episode like a couple days before and he wanted to appear non-threatening.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat.</p>
<p>Potter’s head snapped up, his green eyes zeroing in on Draco’s, leaving him feeling exposed.</p>
<p>“Good day, Harry, I was wondering if I could have a word with you?”</p>
<p>Potter jerked at his given name being used, but motioned to the empty chair across from him seemingly as a reflex.</p>
<p>“Malfoy. Er, hello. Sure, have a seat. What are… I mean, er-”</p>
<p>“What am I doing here and not in France and why have I just politely asked to sit with you?” Draco finished for him.</p>
<p>Harry bit his plush lower lip and nodded. His eyes were locked on Draco’s still and he waited, a tension building between them. Draco had to fight the urge to mumble a ‘never mind’ and apparate to Australia.</p>
<p>Draco sat, resting his hands together on the table, trying to stay non-threatening. He noticed Harry’s hand had moved under the table to his wand.</p>
<p>“What would you think if I told you that I’ve been in France for 5 years and have just gotten back?”</p>
<p>“I’d say you’re delusional and might need to be locked up for your own safety,” Harry shot back bluntly.</p>
<p>Draco smiled wryly at Harry’s choice of words. “Harry, I’ve not gone mad, I’ve come to tell you something. Something that might help. I don’t know. Just listen for a moment, and if you believe I’m lying, you may call Granger or Weasley to verify.”</p>
<p>Harry’s brow was furrowed and his breathing increased. Draco recognized the fight-or-flight response on Harry as if it were just yesterday that they were hexing each other in the halls of Hogwarts, or sitting on the floor of the Manor-</p>
<p>Draco kept in mind, that to Potter, it really was like yesterday.</p>
<p>“Harry, I promise I’m here to do no harm-”</p>
<p>“Why do you keep saying that?” Potter asked, eyebrow up.</p>
<p>“Saying what?”</p>
<p>“My. First. Name.” Potter said slowly, as if talking to a toddler.</p>
<p>Draco fought the urge to sneer, it just felt so natural in the circumstances.</p>
<p>“Ok, would you rather me call you scarhead?” Draco smirked, trying for humor, and realizing a second too late that it might be a mistake.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Harry laughed. “Okay, that’s a little more familiar territory, you were starting to freak me out there, Malfoy. What can I do for you?” Potter sipped his tea like it was the most natural thing in the world to be sitting with his ex-nemesis being called childish names.</p>
<p>“Well, it may be what I can do for you.” Draco guessed that considering their past relationship was a <em>present</em> relationship to Potter, he should be clear as possible.</p>
<p>“Let me be blunt. Five years ago, it was discovered that you had somehow been stuck in a time-loop of sorts. Spell Damage at Mungo’s couldn’t figure it out, neither could Granger, nor anyone else who tried. You have believed it is 30 October, 1998 every day since then.”</p>
<p>Harry just sat there with a smirk, not believing a word. “Okay, so if that’s true, why is it <em>you’re</em> telling me, and not one of my friends?”</p>
<p>Draco cringed. He still had some feelings about Potter and rejected friendship, but now was not the time to delve into that. This was about Harry.</p>
<p>“I assure you, this is not the first choice. There have been many attempts to snap you out of it over the years, and I’m sort of a...last resort. I’m back from my 5 years of probation abroad with Mother, and I’ve finished my Potions Mastery, and I’m specializing on research of using muggle psychological techniques combined with mind healing potions to aid war survivors in recovering from trauma.”</p>
<p>Potter sat with his mouth open and blinked. “Well, that certainly was elaborate. You? Study muggle techniques? Sure. And I’m studying kneazle breeding. Go away, Malfoy, this isn’t funny.”</p>
<p>“Look, I’m not-” Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath, letting the tension seep from his shoulders. <em>You are not who you were.</em></p>
<p>He opened his eyes to Harry studying him intently. Draco’s shoulders sagged.</p>
<p>“Draco,” Potter said slowly, “why do you look so… well?”</p>
<p>Draco blushed at the use of his given name. It was strange to hear from <em>that</em> voice.</p>
<p>“I feel well, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“No, I mean, are you using glammors, or some sort of weight-gaining potion? Because you were thin as a rail…” His voice trailed and he rubbed his chin. Draco could see why Hermione was exhausted with trying to convince Harry of the truth over and over. <em>Merlin,</em> he was stubborn.</p>
<p>“It’s been five years. When you wake tomorrow, none of this will have taken place, in your memory anyway, and you begin 30 October all over again. But time will pass, and it will pass you by.”</p>
<p>That may have been a little harsh, but he needed to see reality if they were to make any progress that day.</p>
<p>Potter stood quickly and stalked to the bar, suspiciously glancing back at Draco while he whispered to Hannah. She gave him a fond look and a patted on the arm, nodding and saying something that had Harry’s eyes widening. <em>Oh good.</em></p>
<p>Harry came back slowly, in a bit of a daze. He sat, sort of staring into space.</p>
<p>“Would you like to floo Weasley?”</p>
<p>“The Weasel.”</p>
<p>Draco raised a brow. “What?”</p>
<p>“You call him the Weasel, and he calls you Ferret.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sure he does. Now do you need to floo-”</p>
<p>“I believe you.”</p>
<p>Draco blinked. “Oh. good.”</p>
<p>They sat there staring at one another, Draco realizing he hadn’t thought he was going to get that far, so he hadn’t really planned ahead.</p>
<p>“Would you like to see my potions shop?” he blurted out.</p>
<p>“Er, sure, where is it?” Harry looked doubtful.</p>
<p>“In Knockturn. They’ve renovated much of it since the war. It’s actually quite lovely.” Draco felt like he was babbling as they stood and made their way to the door. Hannah looked at Draco and he shrugged. He was winging it. She returned the gesture and gave him a thumbs-up.</p>
<p>Walking side by side with Potter was strange. He was very aware of the distance between their wrists as they swung, and their shoulders nearly brushing.</p>
<p>“What is it you’re reading?” Draco asked casually.</p>
<p>Potter looked down at the book clutched in the crook of his arm. “Oh, this, yeah, I think your great, great, great grandfather wrote this, but I can’t really understand it. I found it in the library yesterday-”</p>
<p>Harry stopped walking. “Holy fucking fuck, have I been reading the same dumb, soppy, love story for <em>five fucking years</em>???”</p>
<p>Draco didn’t know how to respond. Harry started shaking a bit. Draco recognized the signs of a panic attack and acted quickly. He grabbed Harry’s shoulders and stared him dead in the eye.</p>
<p>“Potter. You are here right now. The ground is under your feet, the air is plentiful in your lungs, you can hear the sounds of the city, and if you stop for a moment, you’ll realize that this is far from the weirdest <em>or</em> worst thing that has ever happened to you.”</p>
<p>Harry blinked and his breathing slowed. As Draco watched, his pupils relaxed from their constriction, his muscles loosened under Draco’s fingers, and a small smile tugged at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>“It may top the weird, to be honest,” he said, his smile turning into a smirk. Draco came to himself and released Harry’s shoulders. <br/>He missed the feel of the black worn leather jacket under them immediately.</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” Draco replied casually, trying to hide a blush working up his neck. They continued the short walk. “There, see? Borgin and Burkes. Gone. Scarr’s Tattoo shop, gone. Cobb and Webb’s… many others. Ah, here we are.”</p>
<p>They stopped in front of <em>DM Potions</em> and Draco tried his best not to look like a proud papa. The shop was his life’s work and meant so much to him.</p>
<p>“Seriously?” Harry said looking up, his eyes roving the architecture. “This is really… well, it’s posh. I mean, it’s really you- okay I mean…” Potter flushed and looked away.</p>
<p>“What I mean, is it compliments you, Draco.”</p>
<p>Draco wondered how it was so easy for Harry to just starting calling him that.</p>
<p>“I worked very hard to get where I am. I appreciate you coming to see it. I, um.” Draco once again hadn’t thought past that point. A wild hysterical part of him wanted to ask Harry up for coffee. <em>Salazar, no, shut it.</em> “I live in the flat above,” Apparently Draco’s brain was running on autopilot that day.</p>
<p>“Really,” Harry’s eyebrows shot up, a smile sneaking onto his face. “Oh, I see now, you’re bringing me back here for a shag. Well, okay. I’ve got nothing on today, since I have no idea what day of the month it is, or even what month it is, so might as well make the most of it.”</p>
<p>“Wha-” Draco turned bright red and blood rushed south at the suggestion.</p>
<p>Potter burst out laughing. “Oh, you should see you face, it’s brilliant. I’m just joking! Come on, lighten up.”</p>
<p>Draco forced out a chuckle or two, feeling guilty for being relieved that Harry wouldn’t remember it the next day. “Of course, hilarious. Anyway, I do have to get back to work, I suppose. You can use the floo or-?”</p>
<p>Harry looked confused. “I thought you said something about helping me. Were you just coming to rub your success in my face and gloat that I’ve basically done nothing with my life for 5 years? Is that it?”</p>
<p>Draco floundered. “No! No, not at all...I’m just. Look, I know you didn’t mean anything by it, but I’m openly gay and if that makes you uncomfortable, we should just part ways now-”</p>
<p>“Oh, because the joke?” Harry took a step closer, face turning earnest. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t being homophobic, I just, you know, say stupid things when I’m nervous. I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Okay, thank you.” Draco said a little curtly.</p>
<p>“What’s it like?” Harry asked after a short silence.</p>
<p>“Are you seriously asking me what it’s like to be gay?” Draco asked flatly.</p>
<p>“No! No, fuck, I meant what’s it like to be <em>openly</em> gay. You know, out. What’s that like?” Harry’s face blushed red under his lightly tanned skin. He scratched the back of his neck.</p>
<p>“Freeing, I suppose. I don’t have to hide anything. It has just become a fact about me. Like being right-handed or being allergic to strawberries. It’s part of who I am.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry people will judge you?”</p>
<p>Draco held up his left arm. “Ex-Death Eater, remember? They hate me already, so not much to lose.” He wondered where Harry was going with the questions.</p>
<p>“Let’s go upstairs.”</p>
<p>Draco sucked in a sharp breath. That was not at all what he expected. Maybe Potter would say something about being bi-curious, or something, but that was forward. Harry had a determined look in his eyes and Draco found himself unlocking the outside door and opening the wards to let Harry in.</p>
<p>As they walked up the stairs, Draco wondered what the <em>fuck</em> was he doing, and he lead his childhood rival to his living room. Potter kicked off his shoes and sank down into the feel the white rug. Draco stayed rooted to a spot near the door, watching as Potter ran his fingers through the wispy soft fibers.</p>
<p>“Oh this is bloody brilliant, it’s so soft. You want to fuck me on it?”</p>
<p>Draco’s jaw dropped. He stood there gaping, wondering again if maybe he’d been the one to go mad. “Is that another joke?” he asked tentatively.</p>
<p>Harry laughed and stretched out on the floor, his tan skin contrasting with the white and making his green eyes seem more clear. His t-shirt lifted slightly, showing the edge of his boxers and a smooth strip of skin. Harry shook his head no and held a hand out to Draco.</p>
<p>“Nope. Come on. Don’t worry about it, I won’t remember tomorrow, so you could be absolutely awful and I’d forget all about it.” He waggled his eyebrows and grinned devilishly.</p>
<p>Draco wasn’t one to back down from a challenge, and <em>fuck</em>, motherfucking <em>Harry Potter</em> was laid out like a buffet on the soft rug. Draco was just standing there like an idiot with his dick half-hard in his trousers.</p>
<p>Draco knelt down, Harry surging up to meet his mouth halfway. The kiss was bruising and Harry sucked and bit, making Draco shiver and growl. He pushed Harry back flat, taking off the famous round glasses, and pulled up his shirt, attacking his flat stomach with bites and kisses.</p>
<p>Harry laughed and moaned. “Yeah, like that, <em>fuck</em>, we’re finally doing this. I can’t believe it took so- “</p>
<p>His words were swallowed by Draco’s lips and tongue, and he quickly unbuckled Draco’s belt. A sly hand made it’s way inside Draco’s pants, stroking eager fingers along his hardened shaft, teasing and squeezing.</p>
<p>“Merlin, I can’t wait until you put this in me,” Harry moaned between kisses.</p>
<p>Draco thrust into Harry’s hand and pulled back, grabbing Harry’s jeans and yanking them down, pants and all. His cock popped out, red and swollen, the tip wet and ready.</p>
<p>Draco lost no time in ducking down and swirling his tongue around and picking up the musky fluid, loving the bitter taste. Harry thrust up, calling out, grasping at Draco’s shoulder, moaning for more. Draco took him in his mouth, slowly bobbing and sinking down, deeper at each pass until he had Harry’s cock buried in his throat. He swallowed around it, making Harry gasp above him.</p>
<p>“Not yet, I don’t want to come yet, I need you in me, you hear me <em>Draco Malfoy</em>? You fuck me through this floor.”</p>
<p>Draco shuddered and pulled off with a slurp. He made quick work of the rest of their clothes, leaving his shirt on but opened, keeping the faded mark covered. Harry seemed not to notice or care as he kissed down the pale column of his neck with biting marks. Draco summoned his lube from the bedroom. It landed in his palm and he flipped the cap, pushing Harry’s knees apart at the same time. Harry was pliant, with a lazy smile on his face, pulling his legs higher, exposing his hole to Draco, shamelessly. Draco moaned at how wanton Harry looked on his carpet, and brushed his slick fingertips over the pink pucker, pressing. The first went in a little easier than expected. Harry moaned and spread his legs wider.</p>
<p>“Fuck yes,” he hissed, rocking into Draco’s plunging finger, twisting, searching for Harry’s prostate. He found it, delighted when Harry called out his name and begged for another finger. Draco obliged, scissoring his fingers and stretching his hole. He was about to add a third when Harry stopped him with a hand.</p>
<p>“I’m ready now,” Potter gasped, staring intently into his eyes. Draco paused.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hurt you-”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that, it’s not my first time, just fuck me, please.”</p>
<p>Draco growled at the thought of Harry doing this with anyone else. He lined up his cock and <em>pushed</em>. It slid in smoothly, tight and hot. Harry moaned, rippling around him. It was so smooth, so velvety as he bottomed out. Harry began thrusting upward, rocking his hips, urging Draco to move. He pulled out, slowly and teasingly, and plunged back in. Harry moved his legs around Draco’s waist, locking his ankles. He held his hands together above his head, tugging at the rug, the picture of perfect sultry confidence, eyes half open, sweat glistening on his chest, his hair a riot against the white, lips kiss-swollen and bitten.</p>
<p>Draco set up a pace, slow and strong, watching Harry’s face closely looking for signs of pain. All he found was the man arching his back in ecstasy and smiling back at him. <br/>Draco had thought about Potter like this before, how could he not? Even when he was a skinny little git in school, he was powerful and fierce, especially when he paid attention to Draco. He knew without doubt the things he’d done to get the Chosen One’s attention were fuel to the fire; Harry often featured in his wank fantasies. But it was the equivalent of pulling pigtails and he didn’t think much of it after the war. Much.</p>
<p>Harry pulled Draco down into a fiery kiss, his cock trapped between them, slick with spit and sweat. Draco worked a hand between them, shifting so he supported Harry with one knee and braced on one arm. Harry cried when his prostate was brushed against.</p>
<p>“ ‘M close,” he moaned into Draco’s mouth. Doubling his speed and force, Draco pounded into him, bringing himself closer to the edge, stroking Harry in time with his thrusts. Harry lost the kiss and tipped his head back, eyes screwed shut, mouth open in a silent scream. Draco attached his lips to Harry’s neck and sucked, holding on with his teeth as he felt Harry grip tightly around his cock, rippling in time with the blood pounding in his ears. Come spurted between them, messy but hot, and as Harry began to relax, Draco felt himself teeter over the edge, mind clear and quiet for once. It was as if that perfect blank moment, that tiny increment of release held some secret, some eternal truth. However, as usual, when he started to come down from the high of his orgasm, his understanding would escape him and he would drift, wondering what it was inside of the exact moment of bliss.</p>
<p>He collapsed on top of Harry, but instead of being pushed off, Harry wrapped his legs tighter around Draco’s waist and his arms around his back, holding him there for a moment, the sticky evidence of their coupling between them. Usually it was something Draco would be grossed out by, but right then it seemed important, necessary. He buried his face into Harry’s neck, still panting, breathing in the musk, sweat, sandalwood scent of Potter. It brought him back, that smell, because it was one he could place in so many different times in his life: standing with his outstretched hand, being refused friendship, toe-to-toe in a classroom or the hall, breathing each other’s air, static like lightening between them, face-to-face on the floor of the manor, tightly wrapped around him on a broom, terrified and lungs full of smoke, but that scent held safety, held hope-</p>
<p>Dear Merlin and Morgana, what the fuck did he just do?</p>
<p>Slowly, Harry loosened his grip, allowing Draco to prop up on his forearms, still only inches from Potter’s face. He looked back up, his eyes sharp, focused.</p>
<p>“So, I might as well tell you I’m not straight,” Harry broke into a shit-eating grin.</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes, but couldn’t help but smile back. He rolled off, and looked around for his pants. He ended up summoning them out of sheer exhaust, and he had to stop himself from stuffing Potter’s pants under the rug for later contemplation. Harry looked like he knew exactly what Draco was thinking and he stretched himself like a cat, swinging the blue boxers around on one finger, his body on shameless display.</p>
<p>Draco bit his lip. “So, you’ve known you’re gay, or bi or whatever, you were messing with me before?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, finally having the decency to dress and hide his tempting skin. Draco would lay on the rug with him for the next week if he could.</p>
<p>“I kind of figured it out when I had a lapful of Ginny and a mind full of the <em>Quidditch Quarterly</em> men’s calendar. She took it well, but I haven’t really told anyone else…” <br/>He looked thoughtful. “I actually don’t know if I’ve told anyone else, since apparently I’ve forgotten the last five years.”</p>
<p>Reality came crashing home, the breath getting caught in Draco’s lungs.</p>
<p>“You won’t remember this happened.” It was a statement, not a question.</p>
<p>“I guess that’s how it works? Unless you had some magical cock and fucked my amnesia away.” Harry laughed at his own joke, and Draco chuckled a little, feeling hollow inside.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m pretty sure I’ve been told a lot of good things about my cock, but never heard it could break curses.”</p>
<p>Harry smirked and pulled his shirt back over his head. He looked around the rest of the flat. “This is really nice. Modern. Kreacher had several Elves come last week to help him clean Grimmauld Place, and the difference is almost overwhelming- Oh. I guess that could have happened years ago.” He made a frustrated noise and ran his hand through his hair. Draco tried not to kiss his pouty mouth. “I don’t know if I should be mad at Kreacher or give him a hug. He’s been going along helping me this whole time? I need to thank him, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Certainly don’t hug him. If he’s the same Kreacher that was there when I was a child, I’m pretty sure he’d iron his ears over it.”</p>
<p>Harry grinned. “Yeah, I guess so. Well.”</p>
<p>They stood, face to face in front of the floo, the air growing awkward. Draco had no idea what to say. The afternoon had not gone at all like he planned.</p>
<p>And he really didn’t want Harry to leave.</p>
<p>With a shy kiss on the lips that turned into something firmer, until they pulled apart gasping for air, Harry said goodbye and stepped into the floo.</p>
<p>“Draco,” he turned back, “I know this is stupid because I won’t remember it tomorrow, but just so you know, that was fantastic, really fantastic, and if you care to, you should shag future me as much as you can.”</p>
<p>With that, Harry was gone in a swirl of green fire and the flat was silent.</p>
