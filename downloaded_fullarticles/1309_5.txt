    <p> Blaise liked to top. There wasn't much of another possibility for him as far as sex was concerned to be honest. For the longest time, he'd even thought he wasn't interested in sex as anything other than a concept. Oh, he loved hearing about sex, which was good for him because Theo tended to overshare on that subject. Blaise had made the mistake of being the only one to appear interested once, and had accidentally become the other boy's confidante as far as sexual matters were concerned. And Theo must have told others about Blaise's lack of judgement considering such matters, because suddenly anyone and everyone was coming to him with relationship problems, which was ironic considering his own lack of experience with them.</p><p>Blaise was fascinated with sex, but mostly because of everyone’s fascination with it, as sex became something of an abstract concept as soon as he pictured himself having it. He listened to Theo’s stories about the people he dated, his one-night-stands, very few of which Blaise actually met. Sometimes, he wondered if Theo was an exhibitionist, with the way the other man’s breathing deepened as he recounted the way he ate a guy out, the time he'd sold himself to a glory hole and got tied to the owner’s bed after, the time he'd made sweet love to his girlfriend before she left abroad and broke his heart. Sometimes he wondered if something was wrong with his friend, with the way he seemed to love sex and hate himself for it at the same time.</p><p>He knew it wasn't just something about his lack of desire for sex that kept him from understanding. Draco bragged about his sex life too, but not in the same way. He was proud of what he called his exploits, obviously embellished some of them (whether for his own benefit or his audience’s), and felt nothing but satisfaction out of it. There wasn't any of that shame Theo seemed to feel, none of that disregard for his own health and safety, none of that use of something he should and did enjoy as a form of self-harm… </p><p>Blaise was worried for his friend, and didn't know what to do about it. They'd already been through thick and thin together, and Blaise knew Theo was the most important person in his life. He just wished… He wasn't quite sure actually. Blaise just wished he knew what he could do for Theo; he wished he could take care of him, the way he deserved to be taken care of.</p><hr/><p>The first time it happened had been half an accident. Theo had been recounting the events that had happened a few hours prior, more specifically the last time he’d seen his girlfriend before she broke it off with him.</p><p>Blaise had been immediately curious about the fresh marks he could see when Theo disrobed, some of them around his throat and others like bindings that could be seen on his bare arms and a sliver of skin when the hem of his undershirt rode up. “Bedroom?” he asked, although he knew the response the moment Theo had thrown his robe and shirt to the ground.</p><p>“Couch,” Theo replied, heading there before Blaise could even scold him for leaving his clothes on the floor. He rolled his eyes and left them there as he headed over to the couch as well, knowing Theo would appreciate his presence there. Perhaps his best friend would learn to pick up after himself if Blaise forced him to get up after he was exhausted. And judging by the expression on Theo’s face, he thought as he looked at the deliberately stony expression, there might be a good cry coming up.</p><p>“It’s just- I thought I was doing so well, you know?” Theo asked as soon as Blaise had sat down, burrowing his face into his stomach as he spread himself over his lap. The words were muffled ever so slightly, but it was the position that best allowed Blaise to run a hand through his distraught friend’s hair, and let Theo curl up against him as well.</p><p>“I tried so hard you know. I think it was because of the sex that she left me.” The rhythm of Blaise’s hand didn’t slow, but he shifted it towards Theo’s neck instead and felt his friend relax under him, letting the rest of his body lay down on his stomach on the rest of the sofa. He still seemed like he was about to cry though, so Blaise prompted him a little.</p><p>“Tell me about it.” He’d meant for it to come out calm and comforting, and it did, but the clench of his hand made it sound like an order instead.</p><p>And Theo did. He told Blaise all about it in as much detail as he could seem to recall. “We made out after the date. We were lying on our sides on the bed, her mouth on mine, her hand under my shirt.” Theo seemed to relive the scene as he talked about it, bringing a hand to his mouth absently, before letting it fall down and bringing his head back to rest on Blaise’s thigh. “And then we had our hands on each other. She pressed her hand over my pants, and I brought mine under her skirt.” There, he seemed to roll his hips unconsciously into the sofa, but Blaise simply chose to let Theo be rather than bring attention to the action.</p><p>And the deluge of words went on and on, Theo not bothering to censor himself as Blaise's hands wandered from his hair to his neck, and then his back and up again. It was as though Theo was packing as much detail as possible, wanting or needing Blaise to tell him whether he was in the right or in the wrong only after having access to the whole story. By the end of it, Theo had worked himself up into a crying frenzy, and all Blaise could do was hold him to his chest and tell him they would get through it together. </p><p>Despite knowing that Blaise would always have his back no matter the situation, Theo had stiffened in his arms by the time his tears dried up, and seemed to be regretting ever opening his mouth. "I shouldn't have unloaded on you like that, sorry."</p><p>“Hey, you’re my friend, it’s what friends do, don’t they?”</p><p>Blaise didn’t let the uncertainty show in his voice; Theo needed him at his calmest and best right now. He didn’t have many close friends, but he had certainly never done <em><u>this </u></em>with anyone else. It seemed to reassure Theo, for Blaise felt the other boy’s shoulders relax under his stroking hands and moved his touch to Theo’s hair.</p><p>Despite what he was trying to convince himself of, he knew regular friends did not do this. They didn’t lie nearly naked in their clothed friend’s lap, hard as a rock and trying to hide it. They didn’t pet their nearly naked friend’s hair in the middle of what could either be considered a breakdown or the prelude to a masturbation session. Theo’s legs were trembling and he was panting against Blaise’s thigh as he tried to calm himself down.</p><p>“What do you need from me Theo?” Blaise asked, and it was only when he heard the slight tremble in his voice that he realised how utterly out of his depth he was. Theo seemed to have been on a downward spiral for a while, and though Blaise liked the increased contact, he couldn’t help but feel it wouldn’t be enough.</p><p>“Stay.” The word came out muffled, like Theo didn’t dare to say it louder for fear of breaking the fragile equilibrium between the two of them. “Please.”</p><p>And what was Blaise to do in the face of such a query? He’d been taking care of Theo since their first year at Hogwarts, and he knew he would keep doing so even now that there wasn't a Head of House to remind them to always watch each other's back.</p>
