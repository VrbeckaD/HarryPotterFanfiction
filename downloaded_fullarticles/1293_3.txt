    <p>Newt had finally been able to take up Tina’s offer to give him a proper tour of the Woolworth building. He was back in the country, having finished his book, technically in the state to rehabilitate a young nest of kneazles from an underground breeder. Really he had mostly been ecstatic for an opportunity to see Tina, Queenie, and Jacob again.</p><p>Things were much less hectic this time around, with Grindelwald now safely in custody in Europe. It was also nice to visit the Woolworth as a guest and not in shackles as had so often been the case during the last run around. People actually recognized him as he walked through the halls with Tina—admittedly the attention made his cheeks go red and his heart start to flutter nervously, but with Tina by his side it felt less terrifying than if he'd been alone. It had certainly never been his intention to become somewhat of a celebrity around the offices, but he couldn't do anything about it now.</p><p>Newt dug out a copy of his book as soon as they'd reached Tina’s office—he was so glad her original position had been reinstated—and Tina beamed at him. “It’s finished?” she asked, taking hold of it with a grin. “How much?”</p><p>Newt scoffed. “I couldn't think to charge,” he said, his hands twisting absentmindedly.</p><p>Tina leaned against the desk, tsking, and began to flip through the pages. “Newt, you’ll never see any revenue if you keep handing these things out,” Tina scolded fondly.</p><p>Newt looked down with a quiet huff, fighting off a grin. “It was never really about that anyway,” he said.</p><p>Tina stopped on a particular page and glanced up, a question on her lips, but the door to her office banged open, and a man stormed in, radiating power and a quiet rage. His face was familiar.</p><p>Newt froze. While Tina was in the man’s direct line of sight, Newt was off to the right of the door, for the moment hidden. At first glance the man was impeccably dressed, tall and imposing, with a handsome face, though it was twisted in a scowl. Newt remembered that face well, though he had only known the imposter.</p><p>Tina straightened, her face going slightly pale. “Sir—”</p><p>“I've been parading,” Percival Graves glowered, teeth glittering dangerously as he grit them, “in front of those buffoons in court for twenty minutes waiting on that data from you, Goldstein. Even incompetents can only be stalled for so long.”</p><p>“I-I’m sorry, sir,” Tina said, voice initially far higher than it was normally. “I thought you needed them—”</p><p>“Twenty minutes ago would have been acceptable, <em> yesterday,</em>” Graves growled, and Newt was taken aback for a moment when the word was actually a <em> growl</em>, the sound coming low and deep from the man’s chest, “would have been preferable.” There was a brief silence in which Tina blinked, and Graves snapped, “<em>now, </em> Goldstein, before I demote <em> you </em> for incompetence.”</p><p>Tina jolted into action, practically lunging behind her desk and rifling through drawers.</p><p>Newt merely wished, desperately, that he could be elsewhere, trying to blend into the wallpaper. It didn't work, unfortunately. As soon as Graves’ attention left Tina, his dark eyes found Newt, his head tilting curiously. He came closer and eyed Newt up and down, the look assessing. Newt registered the scent of the man’s aftershave, like pine and cedar, and couldn't help but notice the darkening of the man’s eyes as he looked Newt over.</p><p>Newt swallowed nervously, and Graves’ eyes dropped to the movement of his throat, growing darker still.</p><p>A loud clang came from the center of the room when Tina accidentally knocked something off the table in her haste and Newt saw the man twitch almost imperceptibly the instant it hit the ground, his head whipping back to look at Tina as he snarled wordlessly.</p><p>Tina appeared next to them as quickly as if she'd apparated, and held out a large bound file, eyes wide. Graves snatched it, gave Newt one final, unreadable glance, and marched out, the swirl of his black coat almost mesmerizing.</p><p>He and Tina silently stared at the open doorway for a moment. “Was that...?” Newt squeaked.</p><p>“Director Graves,” Tina confirmed, her eyes still slightly wide.</p><p>Newt blinked at the door in awe. He’d always wanted to meet Percival Graves. While he wasn’t exactly an advocate of magical creatures as Newt was, the man was pivotal in turning the tide for werewolf rights, both in his political leanings and in the nature of his position. A decade ago it had been rare for a werewolf to be able to find decent employment. Now one filled the second most powerful seat in the state, and there were none more qualified. Percival Graves had shattered expectations and prejudices with an inherent grace and prowess as if he were born to it. While there were still those that distrusted him simply because of the lycanthropy, certainly several in Congress, MACUSA had never functioned more efficiently than when Director Graves was at the helm.</p><p>It was why Newt had been so eager to meet him on his first visit. To know someone of such influence with the same views of werewolves—and perhaps of magical creatures, Newt had hoped—would be incredibly valuable. Newt had been crushed and subsequently horrified by the man he’d initially met, clearly spurred by ulterior motives and uncaring of who he hurt in the process, but it hadn’t been Graves in the end. Admittedly, Newt had been relieved to find an explanation for it all in Grindelwald, but it still begged the question of where the true Percival Graves was. Whether he was still alive at all.</p><p>With the help of veritaserum Grindelwald revealed he’d kept the man under magical sedation so he could be free to ingredients for polyjuice potion. It had allowed him to <em> “avoid,” </em> Grindelwald had murmured, cackling, <em> “the trouble of having to restrain the man </em> and <em> the wolf.” </em></p><p>Unfortunately, Newt had had to return to London before he could meet the rescued Director properly—the Ministry had found an injured infant kelpie washed up on the banks of the English Channel and had contacted Newt for his expertise.</p><p>Newt, of course, had no regrets helping the kelpie—he’d named her Susan and she was now completely rehabilitated—but he hadn’t been eager to leave so soon. Now, he’d finally had his chance to meet Graves, and instead he’d stood slack jawed and tongue-tied. Wonderful.</p><p>“He’s really a wonderful man,” Tina told him, a strange note to her voice as if she wanted to <em> assure, </em>and Newt glanced at her confusedly, meeting her earnest gaze. He wondered if perhaps his look of awe had been mistaken for mild terror. “It’s just,” she continued, lowering her voice slightly, “he gets a little bit testy when it gets close to...”</p><p>“The full moon,” Newt finished for her, still staring pensively at the doorway. He sighed. He wasn’t staying very long this time—it would likely only take about two weeks to help with the kneazles. Perhaps fate just didn’t intend for his and the Director’s paths to properly cross.</p>
<hr/><p>He ate those words merely half an hour later. Newt had entered the elevator to return to the ground floor, fully intending to head to the Goldstein’s flat where he’d left the case. Strangely enough, there was no presence of the elf that usually operated the elevator, though the thing seemed to work fine enough on its own, so Newt initially paid it no mind. The doors were just beginning to shut, the interior shockingly devoid of anyone else given the busy time of day, when an arm shot inside and stopped their closing.</p><p>As the doors opened back up, Percival Graves, all impeccably dressed, devastatingly good looking, and scowling, stepped inside. Newt froze and stared at the wall, the surprise of seeing the man again so soon making his mind go blank. What should he do? Ask him how his day was going? Would that be strange, given that he technically didn’t know who Newt was? Newt supposed he could open with some question about werewolf rights, but would the man take it well or would he find it offensive in some way? He had already come in scowling, Newt didn’t want to push his luck.</p><p>Newt could feel the man’s eyes on him, studying him quietly, and Newt’s mind flashed back to the way they’d gone dark in Tina’s office. Just as he was about to break the silence, the elevator groaned, and stuttered unnaturally to a stop in between floors, the light above flickering slightly. Newt glanced up at it, heart sinking, and thought, <em> bugger. </em></p><p>Graves sighed explosively, leaning close to Newt in order to reach for the control switch. Newt caught a hint of his aftershave again, his eyes unwittingly drawn to the sharp line of Graves’ jaw in front of Newt’s face as he fiddled with the controls. He truly, Newt thought dazedly, had a very beautiful profile, the gently sloping line of his nose and throat almost elegant.</p><p>Graves’ hand—with long, graceful fingers, Newt couldn’t help but note—hovered over the panel, but after a moment he dropped it with a muttered curse. “Figures,” he said under his breath, glaring at the uncooperative thing, “Red goes home with Vanishing sickness and the whole system goes to shit.”</p><p>Newt glanced at him wide-eyed after a silence, and wondered if he should have responded. Graves had turned his gaze on him after a moment, staring pensively. “Mr. Scamander,” Graves murmured, tilting his head, “isn’t it?” His voice, softer now that it was directed at Newt, was low and warm, like a tendril of woodsmoke curling around the air. Newt blinked, processing the words.</p><p>“Oh—God, no,” Newt blurted automatically, before he mentally smacked himself and added hurriedly at the look of brief confusion on Graves’ face, “I mean, yes. Technically. But not ‘Mister.’ It’s Newt, just Newt. I’m hardly deserving of a ‘Mister’ anyway.”</p><p>Though Graves’ expression had hardly changed other than the slight raise of his eyebrows as Newt continued to ramble, he thought there was something distinctly amused in the set of Graves’ mouth. “Hardly deserving?” Graves repeated, raising an eyebrow. “I'm inclined to disagree. I’ve been told I have you to thank for my even being here.”</p><p>Newt flushed, glancing down, trying to calm his reaction to the easy praise in the man’s warm tone. “W-Well. I’m sure I wasn’t—it wasn’t like I was...integral. By any means. It was mostly the veritaserum to thank. And Tina,” he made sure to add, snapping his gaze up again and <em> oh. </em>Oh, that was definitely a small smile beginning to form at the corner of Graves’ mouth. It was a very nice mouth. Bowed and soft looking...</p><p>“I’m well aware of Auror Goldstein’s part,” Graves told him, voice somewhat distant as his eyes studied Newt’s face again. Newt couldn’t help but redden slightly under the scrutiny.</p><p>“Well, I’m glad,” Newt blurted again, nerves practically pushing the words out of him. “That you’re back, I mean. And that you’re...you,” he finished somewhat lamely, scrunching his nose up briefly at how stupid it sounded.</p><p>Now it was Graves’ eyes that were gleaming with amusement. “Thank you.” The man paused briefly, then added slowly, warmly, “Newt,” as if tasting the name on his tongue.</p><p>The sound of his name mingled with the low rasp of the man’s voice was unexpectedly jarring, sending a jolt down Newt’s spine. He blushed and bit his lip. Graves’ eyes darkened again, the man taking a sudden breath, and leaning the slightest bit towards Newt almost unconsciously.</p><p>Newt frowned in confusion, before realization and mortification hit at once. The man was a <em> werewolf, </em>he had probably smelled Newt’s interest in him a mile off. Oh, god, this was probably grounds for some kind of workplace harassment, wasn’t it, because even though Newt technically didn’t work for MACUSA there was the growing insinuation from President Picquery that they’d call upon him to do consulting work.</p><p>Thankfully, the elevator chose that moment to jolt into motion again, drawing Graves’ attention away. Newt didn't quite understand the simultaneous mix of relief and regret for the loss of the man’s scrutiny. Graves said nothing more until the elevator stopped at the ground floor, turning back to him as the doors opened to say, “a pleasure to finally meet you, Newt,” in his warm, vaguely amused tone, before walking away.</p><p>Newt, still somewhat shell-shocked by the fact that he may have been broadcasting his desire for the man to see, remained where he was standing, startling into movement only as people began to barge in.</p><p>Bugger.</p>
<hr/><p>It was raining when he left the building, already growing dark, a chill in the air. It was the tail end of Autumn in New York and the trees lining the street were stripped and bare. Newt grinned at the feeling of rain on his face, stopping against the side of the building in order to allow people to pass by him. Those going home from the workday barely looked up, huddled in their coats and their magic keeping them from getting wet.</p><p>The bite of the wind had yet to fully pierce through Newt’s coat, so he enjoyed the feeling for a moment longer. He’d always loved the rain.</p><p>A distant, pitiful sound drew him from his thoughts. He startled, glancing around and listening intently to see where it had come from. He heard it again and traced the sound to a ventilation grate at the base of the building.</p><p>Crouching down, he peered inside, illuminating the darkness with his wand, and saw a small, black cat huddled in the corner, completely soaked. “Oh, you poor thing,” Newt murmured, eyeing the grate to determine how he might get it off. “How on earth did you get in there?”</p><p>The grate slots were perhaps large enough for very small creature to fit, but certainly not large enough for Newt to reach through. He studied it with a frown. With his wand, he murmured a spell that melted the metal away from the edges, being very careful not to make too much noise. He didn’t want to scare the poor thing. The grate came away from the building with a low creak and Newt set it aside.</p><p>He reached down into the vent, keeping his movements slow and nonthreatening. After a few minutes, he managed to coax the cat closer and slowly drew it out. The poor thing was small enough he could carry it up with one hand. He cradled it to his chest, trying to warm it up a bit. He didn’t think it was in very bad shape, judging by how it began to mewl and squirm as soon as it was in his arms. It had likely just accidentally slipped inside during the sudden storm.</p><p>“What are you doing?” a sharp voice reprimanded from behind.</p><p>Newt whirled around to see Graves, likely having just left the Woolworth, glowering at him. He was still dry, almost regal looking as raindrops diverted around the sheen of effortless magic over his head. His eyes dropped to the cat in Newt’s arms. The cat immediately hissed, squirming violently, and Newt dropped to a crouch to let it back onto the pavement. It scampered off as soon as he let go, looking no worse for wear. “Ah,” Newt murmured cheerily, “well, I’m glad it seems alright. Certainly alright enough to run away, at any rate.”</p><p>Graves furrowed his brow, staring at him with a kind of searching gaze that made Newt’s heart beat a little faster. The man frowned when he noticed the ruined grate at the side of the building, and Newt flushed sheepishly. “Sorry. I can pay for that.”</p><p>Graves’ gaze snapped back to him, the look growing more displeased when he gave Newt a curt once over. “You’re soaked,” he said. Then, more irritably, “it’s forty degrees out.”</p><p>Newt blinked, glancing down at himself. It was, he could admit, perhaps a little colder than was comfortable. As if his body only needed his mind’s confirmation, he began to shiver slightly. Even though he recognized the futility of it, Newt tried to wrap his drenched coat tighter around him. Frowning, Graves came closer so his magic was near enough to give Newt cover as well. Newt was about to stutter out a thank you when Graves extended a hand, a look of concentration on his face, and brushed Newt’s cheek lightly. Newt snapped his mouth shut at the gentle touch, eyes wide, and it took a moment for him to realize that he was now completely dry. “O-oh,” he managed through chattering teeth, feeling rather like a deer in the headlights when he met Graves’ steady, dark eyes. “T-thank you.”</p><p>Graves stared for a moment more, before sighing again and shrugging out of his coat. It took Newt a moment for his brain to catch up with what was happening. “Oh, n-no,” he protested, “I couldn’t—”</p><p>“Take it,” Graves murmured, giving Newt a firm look as he draped it around Newt’s shoulders. “You’re shaking like a leaf.”</p><p>Newt clutched at it wordlessly, shocked into silence as he registered the warmth of the fabric and the fact that it smelled like Graves. “You’re staying with the Goldsteins?” Graves asked him.</p><p>Newt nodded, not trusting himself with a coherent verbal answer. Graves was very close, Newt could practically feel the warmth radiating off of him as well as from the coat, and the proximity sent his stomach fluttering nervously. Up close, Graves was dizzyingly handsome, and the sparse distance between them sent Newt’s mind entertaining wild thoughts of pressing kisses to his jaw, tangling his fingers in his hair and mussing up the perfection a bit. Luckily, Graves didn’t seem to notice, his attention on making sure the folds of his coat covered Newt’s chest. Newt wasn’t quite shivering from the cold anymore, but he wouldn’t be the one to correct Graves’ assumption.</p><p>Graves met his eyes as he settled the flaps of the coat, after a moment offering Newt his arm. “May I take you there?” he asked.</p><p>Newt flushed again. “You don’t...have to,” he assured. Surely he’d been enough trouble for Graves for the day. “I know where it is.”</p><p>“I’m sure,” Graves murmured, that small, amused turn to his lips returning. “But you seem the type to get sidetracked,” he said wryly, giving a pointed glance to the broken grate. “I’d rather see you there personally.”</p><p>Newt couldn't help but bristle a bit at the implication. “That's very chivalrous,” Newt commented dryly, trying to feel irritated and not flustered when Graves’ smile widened at the words, “but I can assure you I'm fully capable of handling things myself.”</p><p>“I’ve no doubt,” Graves said, voice a low rumble as he leaned slightly closer, and <em> oh</em>, Newt thought, that just wasn't <em> fair</em>. Graves’ lips quirked into an even larger smile when he saw the red that crept onto Newt’s cheeks and Newt couldn't help but drop his gaze to it. He'd even seen a brief flash of white teeth. He wondered if he would ever see a full smile. Surely it would be beautiful enough that it would be impossible to look away. “But I'd be grateful if you indulged me,” the man murmured, his voice warm, the corners of his eyes crinkling slightly.</p><p>Oh, this just wasn't fair at all.</p><p>“Alright,” Newt answered breathlessly, slowly setting his hand on Graves’ arm.</p><p>Newt was no stranger to apparition, but it was a little harder to catch his breath than usual when they touched ground in front of the Goldsteins’ apartment building. Newt turned to Graves, words catching in his throat when he realized how close they were. Their lips were a few inches apart and Graves’ eyes were on his. Though they were unreadable as always, Newt thought he saw something soft in the look. “Thank you,” Newt murmured after a moment, breaking the heavy silence, in which there was only the sound of the rain pattering down around them.</p><p>“Of course,” Graves answered easily, though he made no move to back away.</p><p>Newt realized his hand was still on Graves’ arm and he quickly dropped it, a blush again tinging his cheeks. He swallowed, his mouth suddenly feeling incredibly dry. Newt didn't miss the way Graves’ eyes tracked the motion, the brown of them almost black in the low light. He also didn't miss the way the magic parting the rain above them stuttered slightly in the same moment, letting some drops through. Newt tried and failed not to think on what it meant that <em> he </em>could cause such a lack of concentration. Newt couldn't quite think straight with those eyes on him, heady and dark and mesmerizing. “Goodnight,” he practically gasped out, trying to shake himself out of his stupor. “Director Graves.”</p><p>“Goodnight,” Graves murmured. Tilting his head slightly, he added, “Newt,” in that low voice that seemed to reverberate straight to Newt’s core.</p><p>Graves’ magic kept him dry until he entered the building, his eyes watching the moment until Newt closed the door and leaned back against it, steadying himself.</p><p>He realized a few moments later that he was still wearing Graves’ coat and it still carried the scent of him, like pine and cedar, and that, if he closed his eyes, Newt could almost fool himself into believing Graves was still there.</p>
