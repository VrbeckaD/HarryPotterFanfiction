    <p>         Penelope Granger should have been prepared to go back to Hogwarts without her older sister since it's what she'd had to do the year before. She wasn't, though. It didn't matter how many times Hermione reassured her that everything was truly fine, Penelope couldn't so easily wrap her mind around that truth. Adjusting to post-war life wasn't easy. The sisters had spent the summer months trying and failing to track down their parents in Australia while also lending their efforts to restoring Hogwarts. At least, they'd been together. They'd even been able to see quite a bit of Harry and the Weasleys. But just thinking of being separated, again, was enough to set Penelope on edge.</p><p>         With only a year between them, Hermione and Penelope had always been close, sharing a love of books and learning. Penelope had been excited to follow along to Hogwarts and also be sorted into Gryffindor. The house of lions had been kind to her, giving her a second family and a best gal pal through the Weasleys. She loved her house, and she loved Hogwarts; but the castle didn't feel as safe or as homey without her big sister. The things that had happened to Penelope at the hands and direction of the Carrow twins, things she had never shared with Hermione, were more than she ever wanted to remember, not to mention what had happened to Hermione when she'd been hunting horcruxes. Separation wasn't good. No, Penelope firmly believed it was better to stick together.</p><p>         Hermione, though, along with Harry and Ron, were opting out of returning to finish their seventh years. The boys were pursuing Auror training, and Hermione wasn't wasting any time in launching into writing up new legislation proposals, specifically tackling sensitive topics like treatment and care of war victims and magical creatures who have historically been discriminated against and oppressed. Bold steps for the Golden Trio. Penelope just wished they had decided to come back to Hogwarts. They could've had one year to just be kids, again. One year when things might feel normal.</p><p>         Despite not getting that wish answered, Penelope was glad, at least, that other friends in Hermione's year--Neville, Dean, the Patil twins--were coming back to finish up their schooling. Change was in the air, she knew it was coming, but she was relieved to know it wasn't all coming at once.</p><p>         That's how Penelope found herself waiting to climb into a carriage with those friends, plus Ginny and Luna, too, ready to return to Hogwarts for her final year. She was looking at the other carriages fill up, curious to see who else had come back.</p><p>         His platinum blonde hair caught her eye, and she frowned.</p><p>         What was <em>Draco Malfoy</em> doing here? What did he think he'd gain by being back? Penelope watched as he climbed up into a carriage and sat between Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott. He looked tired. Exhausted.</p><p>         "Oi," Neville said, grabbing her attention, "are you coming with us, or are you planning on walking to the castle?" He smiled at her, and she smiled back, accepting his hand up.</p><p>         Her mind was straying elsewhere, though. Seeing Malfoy made her want to march up to him and demand answers until the deep ache in her heart was soothed. She wanted to ask how he had just stood there and let his crazy aunt torture and mark her beloved sister. She wanted to know how he could be such a coward. She wanted to tell him he was lucky Hermione survived because he didn't want to know what the wrath of her vendetta would have looked like otherwise.</p><p>         "At ease there, aye," Ginny whispered at her side. Of course, Penelope's tension would not go unnoticed by her best friend. The source of it was a bit out of reach for the redhead, though, because she said, "Being back at the castle won't be that bad."</p><p>         For some reason, Penelope was grateful her best friend didn't know what had ruffled her feathers. It was easier to let go of her angry thoughts revolving around the Malfoys when she didn't have to acknowledge their son.</p><p>         But later, at the welcome feast, he caught her eye, again. Once more, she noticed his exhaustion. She was not used to the dullness in his eyes. Every instance she remembers of him arguing with her sister had a snap to it. A certain passion. A glimmer to his eyes.</p><p>         That's gone now, and she was shocked to find her lion heart breaking for him. She didn't want it to. If anything, she wanted to stay royally pissed off at him and what he had stood for. What his family was so proud of. She wanted him to hurt as badly as she had and still was. Did he know what the Cruciatus felt like? Did he know what it's like to be practiced on? To stand in the way of younger students so they wouldn't feel the same pain? Did he know the grief they're all still feeling over the deaths of Fred, Remus, Tonks?</p><p>         As she stared at him, her gaze dropped to his left arm. She recalled the trials she attended this summer, but more striking in her memory are the times she was around the Burrow with Harry. Neither of them could sleep very well, though they weren't the only ones, and neither of them were very good at retreating to their rooms and pretending to sleep, anyway. There were many nights they wandered outside for walks along field roads. Many nights of conversation. Mostly, Penelope listened as Harry word vomited everything from his mind: the weight of being a witness at all the trials; the ugly memory from Malfoy Manor; the truth about Snape; how Malfoy didn't kill Dumbledore, how he became a Death Eater against his will to save his mother. Penelope listened partly because she found it easier to not talk about what was on her own mind and mostly because she cared to hear what he had to say. That's how she found out so much. That's how she knew the reality behind the mark Malfoy wore on his arm.</p><p>         So, she reasoned he must know some hurt. He must know some trauma. More than she probably realized. And that made it difficult to be entirely angry at him, no matter how much she thought being angry and only angry would make things easier.</p><p>         But there'd been so much hate for the last few years, and she was tired of it. She wasn't sure what that meant for the people like Malfoy.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>         Getting into the swing of a new school year was refreshing to Penelope. Naturally, things felt different from last year, but most of it was change she welcomed. She was glad everyone at the castle breathed easier, that no one was practicing Unforgivables on first years. She was also happy to be diving into double Potions, Transfiguration, Ancient Runes, and Charms. Slughorn was especially good in giving the seventh years and rare eighth years freedom to pursue projects they're passionate about. Of course, they still had to attend to things pertaining to their N.E.W.T.s, which was how Penelope found herself encountering Amortentia. Technically, they should have dealt with it last year, but, as everyone knew, last year was not exactly normal.</p><p>         Slughorn was beyond excited to teach them about the love potion, and Ginny snickered about it quietly behind her hand. Penelope noticed and nudged her friend. Then she whispered, "We all know what the potion will smell like to you," and the redhead blushed. The romance between the youngest Weasley and the Boy Who Lived was anything but a secret.</p><p>         "You just wait, Penn," Ginny whispered back. "You'll smell something that'll take you by surprise, and you won't know what to do."</p><p>         Penelope smirked and gave her friend a doubtful look.</p><p>         But then, when the fumes from the cauldron wafted over to her, Penelope's spine straightened in terrifying recognition and realization that Ginny was right. Because she smelled cloves and the clear night air on those field roads by the Burrow and cedarwood, and she knew exactly what that meant. She knew exactly who carried hints of those scents with him.</p><p>         They didn't cross paths the first week of school, though, so the implications of that day in Potions didn't really mean anything to Penelope until Tuesday of the second week back. She was in the library, working on an essay at a table in a secluded area, when he stepped up to her table. At first, she didn't even notice him because she was that immersed in her work. Then she noticed the scents, and she looked up, shocked.</p><p>         There was Draco Malfoy, staring down at her, and she wondered if he knew he was her walking Amortentia potion.</p>
