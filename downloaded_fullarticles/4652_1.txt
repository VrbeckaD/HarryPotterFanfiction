    <p>All things considered, Harry was thankful for his ‘life experiences’, as he rode down the country road on his motorcycle; the wind rushing across his face – eyes shielded by a pair of circular shades from the early morning sun – and through his messy black hair. His recently-bought black leather jacket whipped like a cape behind him.</p><p>Sure, he would have preferred being a normal albeit magical kid, but if it hadn’t have been for Voldemort and his <em>oh</em>-so-lovely group of fascists, Harry wouldn’t be the man he was today.</p><p>Did he have regrets? Of course he had regrets – what person wouldn’t after the shit that he had been through, over the years (besides the obvious individuals). He could have saved Cedric – a boy who was the first victim of the second war; he could prevented Sirius’ death, and he and his godfather could have had many more years of memories – good and bad – to make together. Tonks, Remus, Fred… the list went on, and Harry still had nightmares even after seven years since the war had ended.</p><p>He wasn’t usually this introspective (Harry could hear Hermione and Ron scoff/snort in his mind, respectively), although it being his twenty-fifth birthday today, Harry couldn’t help but have the supposed significance of such a date rankle at him and cause everything to come up to the surface.</p><p>Harry took a deep, calming breath, while the city of Metropolis loomed approximately eight miles up ahead.</p><p>After the war, Harry thought he could simply start a normal life – that starting a ‘normal life’ would be as easy as mounting a broom. Hermione and Ron had managed to settle down within a year, with several talks about marriage and wedding planning, as well as careers being practically bestowed upon them by everybody who wanted the ones who helped vanquish Voldemort; they were suited for a ‘normal life’. Life for Harry, on the other hand?</p><p>Sure, there was an almost limitless number of offers – and not just limited to within the UK. Harry had heard – what he sincerely <em>hoped </em>to be a rumour – which someone from Japan wanted to split the profits on the ‘Harry Potter Sex Pillow’ product, as a sign of gratitude for stopping the dark tosser. Plus, Ginny was more than willing to “carry on where they left off” in their relationship. In the face of what had happened over the past year, though, the spark he had once felt for Ginny raging like an inferno, was now barely an ember. He wanted to escape; he wanted to <em>live</em>.</p><p>Thus, Harry had packed most of his belongings, said his farewells to all of his friends and family, and left on Sirius’ motorbike – all of this had happened approximately six years ago. During those years of soul-searching, he had travelled the world – both magical and mundane – and with the places he had seen, it was sometimes had to tell where one ended and the other began. However, it was during his year-long stay at a hidden temple within the Himalayas, when Harry had found out a sobering truth and cursed his infamous luck.</p><p>He was immortal. Completely, utterly, <em>hopelessly</em> immortal.</p><p>Turns out that the legend of the Deathly Hallows was not simply a fairy tale. Uniting all three had truly made him the ‘Master of Death’, and he would remain so for all eternity. Following this realization, Harry knew that he would never go back to England. The knowledge that he would outlive all of his friends and family greatly pained him. Therefore, after Harry had left the hidden Himalayan temple, he wandered aimlessly across the world, until he found himself in this very moment. So lost in his thoughts, that Harry was unaware of the object falling from the skies in his direction until the last second.</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>Instinctively, Harry had cast the most powerful wandless shield charm he could, just as the object smashed in to it, sending him flying off his motorcycle, and in to the nearest cornfield. The force of the impact managed to partially divert the object’s trajectory and make it skid farther inwards towards the centre of the cornfield. Harry groaned, as he dusted himself off and gingerly stood back up again.</p><p>“What the bloody fuck was that?”</p><p>Checking to see that no-one was around, Harry took out his wand seemingly from out of thin air and cautiously moved towards the fallen object. With a wave of his wand, he instantly vanished the thick plume of dark-grey smoke that had been coming from the object’s crash site.</p><p>“Homenum Revelio.”</p><p>Nothing happened, which only served the purpose of making him even more on-edge.</p><p>As Harry approached the crash site, he noted how the impact of the object had knocked down the surrounding corn crops over a rough radius of five metres. In the centre of the crash site, Harry saw that the smouldering object that had crashed, was what appeared to be… a spaceship!</p><p>For a brief moment, Harry gaped like a fish out of water, before he took back control of his emotions and examined the ‘spaceship’, which was wedged into the dirt by its side and consequently propped up.</p><p>The ship was shaped like the most aerodynamic arrowhead, and it was much smaller and narrower from what he had envisioned alien life (aliens – do they actually exist?) would use for travel to Earth; it would certainly be too cramped to contain his reasonably bulky, 5’11”/1.80m self.</p><p>
  <em>Unless, it had the alien equivalent of a space-expansion charm applied to his interior. </em>
</p><p>The ship was as black as total darkness, yet it also seemed to shine to give a somewhat crystalline look. Harry began waving his wand and his unused arm in unison with each other, as he cast diagnostics on the spaceship. Despite crashing only a minute ago, the ship had already cooled down significantly, judging by its temperature readings. He was about to see if he could open the ship to see if anyone was inside, when the top of the spaceship rose up several centimetres, before it near-instantly snapped back into the ship and revealed its contents.</p><p>Inside the spaceship was revealed to be a baby, who was shockingly human in appearance with the brightest blue eyes that Harry had ever seen – far brighter than any human could possibly hope to have. He then found out, with a cautious motion of his wandless arm, that the baby was approximately three months old, before he started to vigilantly yet also delicately cast every diagnostic charm he knew on it. Once nothing potential dangers were discovered, Harry warily moved forwards with his arms out towards the baby, whose head was titled at a slight angle as it stared curiously at him.</p><p>However, before Harry could touch the baby, a message rang out from the spaceship and instantly made him go to a battle-ready stance.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>To the one who found this ship, my name is Allura In-Z of the planet Krypton. If you are listening to this message, then my husband and I, Zor-L, are deceased. Our universe was under attack by a powerful force, known as the Anti-Monitor, and so my husband built this spaceship for our daughter, Kara Zor-L. Anti-Monitor was defeated, but our universe was destabilised, and so I created a wormhole that would send our daughter to another universe, in hopes that she would find a home and have a chance to grow into the wonderful woman we KNOW she will become. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Please, to whoever found this message and our darling daughter, please take care of her. Tell her that the love from her parents will be eternal. Please ensure that Kara will help preserve Krypton and create a legacy to continue her people. Thank you.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>Harry’s gaze fell onto the baby, <em>Kara</em>, who was gurgling happily without a care in the world in those beautiful, bright blue eyes – without the faintest idea about her parents’ sacrifice. He reached out and took her out of the spaceship, and as if it were the most natural thing in the world, he gently rocked her in his arms.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” a hint of steel entered Harry’s voice. “I promise your parents, but most importantly YOU, that you will be <em>loved</em>.”</p><p>The life of Harry James Potter had changed forever, and for the first time in years, he had purpose.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The adoption process was surprisingly quick and simple – both the magical and mundane sides.</p><p>A trip to the New York branch of Gringotts and one blood-adoption ritual later, ‘Karen Potter’ became his daughter. Consequently, Karen’s beautiful bright blue eyes became bright green, like his own, but far more beautiful and innocent than his had ever been. Goblins didn’t really care in the slightest about the details behind an adoption, so long as the adopter paid the gold with a little interest on the side. With a little magic, the mundane adoption process was sorted within a matter of a few days. During that waiting period, Harry had checked out one of the Potter estates, located near a small (no pun intended) town called Smallville, and moved in to the mansion.</p><p>Luckily for him and his new daughter, the old Potter mansion had five house elves that had kept the place clean and usable. They had been itching to have a new master and practically wept when he told them that he and his daughter were moving in. Sometimes, it was almost like having five Dobbys, Harry thought with an occasional twinge of sadness.</p><p>When Karen was four years old, Harry got his first surprise of parenthood, when he witnessed his daughter shove an older boy twice her size, away from a cowering little, dark-haired girl curled up into a ball, who he had deduced was the older boy’s victim. The bully was sent flying through the air, in to and <em>through </em>a sturdy wooden fence. The fence had been obliterated, and the bully had been knocked unconscious with a broken arm, much to Karen’s horror. She had immediately come running towards him at a surprisingly fast speed for a four-year-old, bawling her eyes out and apologizing profusely with the occasional begging not to be left at an orphanage – like he would have ever abandoned her at an orphanage.</p><p>The bully’s victim – former, if Harry had anything to say about it – was stunned at Karen’s display of super strength, before she thanked her in a shy, timid voice. Harry had felt nothing but sympathy, as he knew what it was like to be at the receiving end, and winced when she told him that the bully was none other than her cousin – talk about dramatic irony. Harry had discreetly used magic to check if his daughter was a witch, only to come with a negative result. He was about to alter Renee’s memories, when his daughter pleaded with him not to do so; he caved in the second she deployed her irresistible puppy-dog eyes. It was on this day that Renee Montoya and Karen became best friends.</p><p>As the years passed, Karen grew up from an adorable little girl, to a stunningly gorgeous young woman. At the same time, Harry thanked his whatever god(s) was/were out there, that he had securely stored the spaceship in the basement of the manor, for it seemed as if his daughter gained a new power almost every consecutive year, as well as the increase in power of her other powers. Karen’s display of super strength at age four was followed by her discovering the ability of super speed at age six, invulnerability at age seven, x-ray vision at age eight, super senses at age ten, super/freeze breath at age eleven, and heat vision at age twelve.</p><p>Harry found out about heat vision, due to the incident when the manor library had almost burned down, after Renee and Karen had their first kiss together. Renee had come <em>sprinting</em> in to his personal study, and he was half-convinced that she was going to confess to having super speed herself.</p><p>Thankfully, partially due to the magical protections cast on the books, none were damaged in the slightest, though Karen was red with embarrassment and had a cute, impish smile on her face from the kiss. They had exited the library holding hands, and that was the start of their relationship.</p><p>Now, almost twenty-five years later to the day he found her, Harry was looked forward to meeting up with his daughter and whom he expected was to become his future daughter-in-law, for a catch-up session. After the two lovebirds had graduated from Smallville High, Karen had gone off to one of the most prestigious colleges in the US to study economics, while Renee had headed off to the Gotham Police Academy. It was during college, when his twenty-year-old daughter had called him from her dorm about how she <em>literally </em>flew.</p><p>In spite of the wondrous discovery of yet another power, Harry listened attentively to what his daughter had to say.</p><p>
  <em>
    <u>“I just… feel like I could be doing something more with my life, y’know?”</u>
  </em>
</p><p>Although Harry had desired to be ‘normal’ for most of his life, he understood what his daughter was saying.</p><p>
  <em>
    <u>“Do what you feel is right, but only if you do it because it is YOUR choice, and know that I will support you. No matter what.”</u>
  </em>
</p><p>The conversation didn’t dispel all of her doubts and fears, but Harry could tell it had helped tremendously. A week after their conversation over the phone, the first televised appearance of the superheroine known as ‘Power Girl’ bombarded every news channel.</p><p>Power Girl was shown saving eighteen people who had been trapped inside a burning building – zipping in and out at unperceivable speeds, without a single scratch on her superhero uniform. She was lauded by almost everyone, especially as she saved many more people and stopped several supervillains who had risen from the shadows. Harry couldn’t have been more proud of his daughter… and more disgusted with himself.</p><p>He had always thought his daughter was beautiful – fathers were always biased. Even so, it was more on the lines of admiring the beauty of a painting, or the brilliance of an abstract concept. Not in a sexual way, like a man would view an attractive woman. Yet, with each televised appearance of ‘Power Girl’, Harry was confronted with the fact that his daughter was unbelievably hot.</p><p>“Mind out of the gutter, Harry,” he muttered under his breath, as he tied his tie in front of his bedroom mirror.</p><p>Like all rooms in the manor, his bedroom was ridiculously spacious, almost to a superfluous degree. All around the room were framed pictures of him and Karen, from when she was baby to the latest pictures taken last year.</p><p>One of these latest pictures caught Harry’s eye. It was taken at the beach in Coast City, where he and his daughter had chosen for a week of their summertime vacation. In the framed photograph, Harry had his right arms wrapped around Karen’s shoulders, with their sides pressed together, and the two of them were grinning at the camera. At the time of the photograph, the interaction between father and daughter was innocent – it was simply a father taking a picture with his daughter. But as he stared at the photograph hanging on his bedroom wall, Harry’s thoughts were far from paternal. His eyes took in every detail of Karen’s voluptuous body.</p><p>The first thing (or rather two things) that anyone attracted to females would have their attention attracted towards would be her humongous breasts. This was not hyperbole, for saying that Karen’s breasts were large would be like equating the size of Earth to the size of Jupiter. The red bikini top supported those gigantic breasts were practically two small triangles that only seemed to cover albeit barely more than her nipples. Anyone who wasn’t rendered catatonic from the sight of such wonderful, round globes of flesh, would take note of how they seemed to defy gravity, as they barely seemed to sag within the confines of his daughter’s struggling bikini top.</p><p>Harry should know, seeing as he had once “unknowingly” entered the bathroom, to almost come across the sight of his naked daughter. If it weren’t for her super-fast reflexes, he would have seen <em>all </em>of his daughter. Fortunately for him, he did see enough of her to fuel his incestuous lust.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes and pictured her goddess-like physique in his mind in crystal-clear detail. (Thank you occlumency!)</p><p>Five-feet-and-eleven-inches of voluptuous curves and highly-toned muscles. A huge, full ass that protruded out from underneath the towel, in such a way that the towel might as well have no use whatsoever. It, too, seemed to defy gravity and was as firm as her breasts. While her hips were as wide as her bust, Karen’s waist was quite narrow in comparison, which only served to highlight her hourglass figure. Like her arms, his daughter’s long legs were muscular, but to the degree where it enhanced her beauty and not detracting from it. Short, mid-length blonde hair that reached just above her shoulders, bright green eyes, and a face that most supermodels would kill each other for, made up the bombshell that was his daughter.</p><p>At first, Harry had tried to resist the temptation, but it was such a hot taboo – and so he caved and once he had cast the strongest silencing charms around his bedroom, Harry masturbated vigorously to the mental images of his daughter. His fantasies then shifted from Karen to ‘Power Girl’. As he stroked his cock at blistering speeds, ‘Power Girl’ threw away her cape and gloves, and then striped off her white, skin-tight bathing suit, but not before teasing him with her cleavage through her ‘boob window’. She then kicked off her three-inch high-heel boots – leaving her as naked as the day she was born – and then lean her mouth to his ear with words that would always make him cum.</p><p>
  <em>“Fuck me, daddy. I need you in me.”</em>
</p><p>Every fantasy, he would cum like an out-of-control firehose and soil his bedsheet with his seed. When Karen had called him yesterday, with hints that she would be proposing to her long-time girlfriend, Harry was indeed happy to hear this news. On the other hand, his forbidden lust for his sexy Kryptonian daughter made him curse out at the heavens, for the fact that she wasn’t just his daughter but also a die-hard lesbian – basically meaning that there was zero possibility of someday fucking her. God, he would give anything to fuck her – to show how crazy she drove him!</p><p>Harry adjusted the erection that was threatening to burst out of his trousers, and as his left hand reached inside his boxers, his hand unknowingly came into contact with a small drop of his precum.</p><p>Shaking his head and trying to regain equilibrium, Harry headed down two flights of stairs, until he was in the basement and walked over to the spaceship. He removed the sheet that was covering it and squatted down in front of it with a wistful look in his eyes.</p><p>“Who would have thought that I would lust after my alien daughter?”</p><p>Harry reached out with his left hand and touched the spaceship. As he had expected, nothing happened, and so Harry got up and headed back upstairs with work reports on his mind. Unbeknownst to the wizard, the small drop of precum had touched the spaceship and activated its internal passive mode.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Kara Zor-L <u>must</u> be converted, for she <u>must</u> continue the Kryptonian race of her fallen universe. Initiating the conversion process with recently absorbed reproductive material in 3… 2… 1…</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>And thus, the spaceship enacted one of its primary functions, and its mission would be fulfilled.</p>
