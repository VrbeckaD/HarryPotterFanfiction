  <strong>The First Night</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since he had first laid eyes on him, Slughorn had wanted Potter. Not just to fuck, though he wanted that too, but to have body and soul. There was nothing he liked more than to slowly break a boy down and then rebuild them. To make them desperate to give their Professor what he wanted.</p>
<p>There was a reason, after all, that most of his contacts stayed loyal decades after they had graduated. Slughorn preferred the subtle methods and manipulations. When Slughorn collected his prizes, they stayed collected.</p>
<p>Potter had proven difficult to ensnare though. Naive he could deal with, but the boy seemed annoyingly absent of ambition or any handles with which to apply the leverage needed for the first steps in breaking or manipulating any child. At least he had been.</p>
<p>When Potter first approached him about certain… memories… Slughorn had to admit he had been startled. Flustered. Scared even. Yes, that had definitely been his first reaction.</p>
<p>With hindsight though? It was also an opportunity. Harry Potter was a hard one to collect. And this? Well his questions dripped of desperation. The perfect bait. If Slughorn was willing to pay the price, it might be enough to catch his prize. He took pride in being the ultimate hunter. And so far? So far this prize had been stubbornly difficult to ‘collect.’ The risks were high with the play he had in mind… but the rewards? Equally great.</p>
<p>It was with this in mind that Slughorn asked Potter to stay after class. The boy looked ecstatic at the opportunity, eyes practically glowing, and Slughorn knew he had him.</p>
<p>Potter waited until the room had emptied, shooing his little side kicks away, before turning to Slughorn. “Professor, about yesterday…”</p>
<p>Slughorn held up a hand, silencing the boy. “My Boy, I know what you were asking for. And why.”</p>
<p>“About Hor…”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention them!” Slughorn’s voice was curt and hard for a moment, before he put the more amiable look back on his face. “I know what you referenced.”</p>
<p>Harry took on a more cautious look. “Then… then you know why it is so important?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps…” Slughorn pretended to give him a considering look. “But this information is not to be given out easily. If the wrong sort has it? Well. Look what happened last time? The Dark Lord…”</p>
<p>Harry looked affronted at that. “But that’s exactly why…”</p>
<p>“Why I must be cautious.” Slughorn rested a gentle hand on the boys shoulder. It was promising when Potter didn’t shake it off. “I can’t simply give this knowledge out after all. Surely you see the need for caution? It’s important I know what sort of person you TRULY are after all… your character…”</p>
<p>The boy’s face took on a look of impatience and frustration at that. “But then how…”</p>
<p>Slughorn pretended to consider this for a moment. “A suggestion, Harry my boy. Your potion skills are truly remarkable…” the boy squirmed uncomfortably at this, but Slughorn pressed on. “However… one can always do with additional training. I propose we meet nightly, a chance for me to provide you with some of that advanced tutelage. And in return, it will also give us a chance to get to know each other better. To see if I can trust you with this knowledge…”</p>
<p>The boy was actually considering it. He was so naive it was almost painful. Slughorn would greatly enjoy stripping him of that, bit by bit.</p>
<p>“But Quidditch Practice…”</p>
<p>Slughorn resisted rolling his eyes. That this would be the only objection? Truly the boy was desperate. “Nightly except for Quidditch practice.” He corrected.</p>
<p>Slowly Harry nodded. “Alright sir. Professor. That seems fair.” A flash of a grin came across his face. “Better than the remedial potions Snape always demanded.”</p>
<p>Had Snape tried to beat him to the prize? Well no matter. He had missed his chance. Harry would be Horace’s.</p>
<p>Slughorn forced a jovial laugh out. “Well. Then its settled my boy. You’ll come by my office this evening. If nothing else, it will also help your already stellar grades. And we’ll keep the details of what we discuss between ourselves, yes?”</p>
<p>The boy was nodding, but Slughorn was barely paying attention. He had a lot of groundwork to lay before tonight. And tonight would only be the first of many nights after all. Slow and steady won the race.</p>
<p align="center">————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p>The boy showed up promptly, he would give him that. Slughorn resisted licking his lips as his prey wandered trustingly into his private office.</p>
<p>The boy was already wiping at his brow as he took a seat and looked around curiously. “Sir, what are we doing?”</p>
<p>Slughorn smiled, though likely the boy would take it as jovial. Potter already looked hot and uncomfortable, but it would only get worse. Slughorn liked to play the long game, and this was just one of many ways he would advance towards his goal. His office was stifling; uncomfortably so. Slughorn of course had taken a cooling potion and cast several charms before the night started. But Harry? Not as much.</p>
<p>Ohh, he didn’t expect the boy would just strip off his clothes or anything so brazen. Potter struck him as the innocent and modest sort. But it would just be one more little pressure.</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>Slughorn started as the boy repeated himself. “Ahh yes. Well, we’ll be brewing of course my boy. But first… snacks!”</p>
<p>Potter looked faintly disgusted as he took in the tray of snacks on the desk. No doubt thinking disparaging comments about his poor professor’s weight or weakness for candied pineapples. Well. That would change with time.</p>
<p>“I’m not hungry sir…”</p>
<p>“No my boy, I insist. I had the house elves make it special. Treacle Tart I’m told is your favorite?” He nudged the plate closer. “Once we start brewing we’ll have to throw away any food left out. So do eat up.”</p>
<p>Reluctantly the boy sampled the snacks, and Slughorn smiled to himself. He had him. A few potions of his own invention lined the pastries. Nothing so crass as a love potion. Slughorn didn’t mind risking his job in his hunt for Potter, but he had no intention of ending up in Azkaban after all. It was illegal to force another’s actions. But to nudge it ever so slightly? That was different. Frowned on, but not illegal according to the strict reading of the Ministries laws.</p>
<p>What the dessert did have was a mild aphrodisiac. Very mild in a single dose. You could buy it over the counter at any Potion’s shop in the country. Likely Potter wouldn’t even notice it this night.</p>
<p>But in a deft bit of potion making, Slughorn had fortified and modified the original potion. Unlike the original which lasted an evening, this one would stay in the poor boy’s system. And every night, it would get reinforced ever so slightly as Potter had his next snack.</p>
<p>Not enough to *force* the boys actions. Everything would still be his choice. His choice whether to act on it. Technically. But day by day, the potion would build up more and more. Likely the boy would chalk it up to hormones at first. Then who knows what? But in a few weeks the poor child would be a ball of lust and tension unable to relieve his feelings.</p>
<p>And better still? Just a drop of Slughorn’s own blood was mixed in. It would bind the lust potion to Slughorn himself, and assure that Harry’s thoughts would constantly be drifting to his poor professor. What would the boy think when he started desperately masturbating, multiple times a day, and it was his elderly professor who started coming into his mind?</p>
<p>Slughorn truly hoped the boy was straight. It would only make his distress and confusion more and more hilarious as he started fantasizing about his teacher.</p>
<p>And technically, the boy would have all his own free will. But Slughorn well knew how easy it was to just nudge a hormonal teenager down one path or another. To condition them. To form new habits of thinking and action. If you took things in small steps, anything could seem normal…</p>
<p>He waited until the boy had finished his treat before clapping his hands. “And now Harry my boy… to work…”</p>
<p>“Sir… first I was wondering about the Horcruxes…”</p>
<p>Slughorn grimaced. Damn the boy for spoiling the mood. “Now Harry… what did I tell you?”</p>
<p>Harry scrunched up his face. “About getting to know my character…”</p>
<p>The professor nodded. “You have my word. You do as I say and this goes well, then at the end of the semester I will answer your questions. Give you any memory. At the *end* of the year. For now though, this is about getting your measure as a person. We will not be discussing Dark Magic! You understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir…” The boy’s tone said he clearly did not. But no matter. In a few weeks the boy would have other things on his mind thsn dark objects.</p>
<p> </p>

  <strong>The Second Night</strong>
</p>
<p>The second night Slughorn took things just the slightest step further. After the boy had eaten his potion-ladened treacle treat, without protest this time, and after Slughorn had shrugged off the inevitable probe about Horcruxes, they were off.</p>
<p>He gave Harry a difficult potion to work on this time, and Slughorn took advantage of that to often touch the boy. Nothing dramatic or truly inappropriate; it was far too soon for that. Just a hand on the shoulder. Getting a bit too close as he leaned over the boy to examine his work. Once or twice he took Potter’s hands and guided them in the mixing of the ingredients.</p>
<p>All easily overlooked and shrugged off, especially by a boy desperate to get information from his teacher. But it also served to acclimate the child to his touch and his close presence. It would make later steps less difficult.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>The Fourth Night</strong>
</p>
<p>The boy hadn’t yet commented on the heat of the room, so Slughorn upped the ante. It was practically a swamp this evening, and even with his personal cooling charms Slughorn could feel it.</p>
<p>The lad was miserable. It was almost amusing. His hair was damp on his forehead, and he kept shifting uncomfortably as he ate his treacle tart.</p>
<p>“Something wrong, Harry?”</p>
<p>“Nothing sir…” The boy was adorably determined not to annoy the professor before he got the secrets he wanted. This time though, he pressed on. “It’s just. Well. It’s a bit stuffy is all.”</p>
<p>“Is it?” Slughorn feigned surprise. “I confess I didn’t notice.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded. “I thought it would be cool in the dungeons but…”</p>
<p>Slughorn stepped closer, and Harry didn’t react. The boy had gotten used to Horace in his personal space. “Well the classrooms are different from an office after all.” He placed a hand on the boy’s forehead, expressing concern. “You do seem a bit warm…”</p>
<p>Harry looked hopefull at that. “Do you think you could cool it down…?”</p>
<p>Slughorn shook his head and lied. “No, I’m afraid some of the potions here are rather finicky with temperature.” He pretended to think a moment before pushing on. “Why don’t you take your robes off, that would make you a bit cooler perhaps.”</p>
<p>The boy blushed a brilliant shade of red, and Slughorn smirked internally. Ohh yes, the treacle tart and its potions were starting to take effect. Slughorn supposed he couldn’t say for certain, but he doubted a week ago innocent little Potter would have thought much of that request. Now? Well Slughorn couldn’t help but wonder where the boy’s mind was going that he blushed so red.</p>
<p>“…sir…” Harry stuttered out.</p>
<p>Slughorn raised an eyebrow. “My boy? Surely you would be more comfortable without the robes? You’ve got trousers on I see, and a shirt too I’m sure. It is after hours, no need to stand on ceremony or school uniforms. If you’re warm, you’d be more comfortable without the extra layer of robes. Perhaps that’s why you are over-heating?”</p>
<p>Potter only hesitated a moment before removing the robes, and Slughorn had to resist licking his lips. The boy was truly delectable. He did have trousers on, and a t-shirt too. A pity the pure-blood habits of only wearing underwear under robes had died off.</p>
<p>But that said, the clothes were oddly shaped. They were at the same time too big and too small. They rather looked like they were made for a ‘large’ child several years younger than the teenage Potter. They were baggy, and yet also short on the legs, arms, and length.</p>
<p>It gave a delicious view. The clothes sagged in the best places, showing tantalizing hints of skin. Nothing so inappropriate as to be called on… but tantalizing indeed. It whetted Slughorn’s appetite for what was to come.</p>
<p>Tonight, as Potter worked, Slughorn took a break from the intimate touches to stand back and observe the boy. Despite being so baggy, the t-shirt was also somehow too short. Not horribly so, but just enough that when the boy leaned over to work on his potion, it revealed a small strip of pale flesh.</p>
<p>Slughorn found himself tantalized by the sight. That pale strip of flesh was almost erotic. It became almost a game; observing Potter’s movements carefully for when the shirt would ride up just a tad more. Showing just the slightest sliver more of skin.</p>
<p>It took all his self-control to not grab the boy right there and take him. It would be so satisfying. To touch that soft skin. To use him. Despoil the innocence.</p>
<p>Potter leaned forward, baggy pants shifting again, and Slughorn swore he could almost see a hint of the boy’s cleft. So. So. Tempting.</p>
<p>But he was playing the long game. Grab Potter now, and the only way to keep the boy silent would be to give him the Horcrux memory. That or start playing with memory charms. Either way things would end. So no. Patience. Patience. And he’d have it all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>The Eighth Night</strong>
</p>
<p>Potter had gotten more comfortable with their little sessions. Now, his robes came flying off as soon as he entered the room. Slughorn had taken to rewarding that by lessening the heat.</p>
<p>He also grabbed the treacle tart without hesitation, and they spent the first several minutes of their session with Potter regaling him with his exploits of the past day.</p>
<p>Yes, Harry was definitely getting more comfortable. It was amazing how well an attentive and friendly adult ear seemed to work with the child.</p>
<p>All the potion the boy had been ingesting couldn’t hurt either. Ohh, technically, it was simply a lust potion. There was no direct influences on the human mind beyond that. But Slughorn hadn’t spent all these years collecting students without learning a thing or two.</p>
<p>By now? The boy’s libido had to be in overdrive. Not beyond the norm for a teenager perhaps, but near the upper limit of that. No doubt the poor child had been self pleasuring himself more than ever before. It was amusing picturing Harry desperately trying to find some privacy every night and morning to relieve a little pressure.</p>
<p>And with that drop of blood and Slughorn’s special mixture? With eight nights’ worth of the potion in his system, there was no doubt that Slughorn had started to feature in his fantasies. The boy didn’t *have* to think about Slughorn. But the potion did assure that, without a doubt, such thoughts would elicit the strongest reaction and pleasure. And teenage boys were not known for their self control when it came to their fantasies.</p>
<p>And after that? It was human nature. If the boy was fantasizing about his professor, self-pleasuring himself regularly with thoughts of his teacher? Well. That couldn’t help but impact how the boy viewed said teacher.</p>
<p>When they had first met? Harry had been cool and distant. Barely polite if Slughorn was honest.</p>
<p>Now? The boy vacillated between chatty and shy. Anything BUT cool and distant.</p>
<p>As they got to the night’s potion making, Slughorn took his usual position behind Potter. Alternating between the gentle touches to shoulders and arms, and standing a few steps back to enjoy the view.</p>
<p>That thin strip of flesh between his shirt and pants was making an appearance again tonight.</p>
<p>Should he? Yes. Slughorn decided to advance the game ever so slightly.</p>
<p>He stepped closer to Potter, but the boy didn’t react. He was well used to his professor standing close by now.</p>
<p>Then Slughorn, ever so gently, reached out and ran a finger along that exposed skin, resting his hand just above the curve of the boy’s arse.</p>
<p>The skin was as soft as it looked.</p>
<p>Harry jumped in shock, looking over his shoulder at the professor. “Wh.. Wh… sir?”</p>
<p>Slughorn smiled genially at the stuttering youth. “I’m sorry Harry, your shirt was just rising up a little.”</p>
<p>He patted the boy on the head, pretending there was nothing unusual. “It is good to see you so relaxed, but I couldn’t resist the urge to straighten things up!”</p>
<p>And he used that thinly veiled excuse to put his hand back on the exposed skin, tracing his fingers around as though he was just examining where the shirt fell short.</p>
<p>Potter arched his back, clearly conflicted on whether to move away from his professor or relax into the touch. Of course, the arched back caused the shirt to ride up still a little more.</p>
<p>A moment later and Potter was starting to look uncomfortable, jerking his shirt down to cover the exposed skin. So Slughorn reluctantly ended his touching, patting the boy once on the shoulder before standing back in his usual spot.</p>
<p>There was a small moment of truth now, but a few seconds later Potter simply relaxed and went back to his potion making without saying anything further.</p>
<p>Yes, things were progressing well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>The Tenth Night</strong>
</p>
<p>After his touches a couple of nights ago, Potter had come to their next meeting in deliberately longer and better fitting clothes.</p>
<p>Still, perhaps it was the only set of well fitting clothes he had? Or perhaps the potion and lust filled dreams weakened his resolve? Either way, the boy was back to his usual attire tonight.</p>
<p>Slughorn didn’t immediately jump on that. Patience was key. He contented himself with the tamer touches on shoulders and arms. And he waited until Potter was once again relaxed and focusing on his potion.</p>
<p>They were halfway through the night when Potter shifted forwards to grab some Armadillo Bile. Predictably, the shirt rode up ever so slightly, pale flesh stretching as the boy reached.</p>
<p>Slughorn took advantage of that by letting his hand wrest on the exposed skin once again.</p>
<p>“S..sir…?” The boy was stuttering again. It was adorable.</p>
<p>He pretended to deliberately misunderstand the boy. “Think nothing of it, Harry! A boy your age can’t be concerned too much with clothes. That’s why old men like me are around, to help keep you straight and neat…”</p>
<p>He punctuated his words by letting his hands trail ever so gently over that exposed skin.</p>
<p>This time, instead of jerking his shirt down to cover himself better, Potter simply blushed.</p>
<p>Slughorn took that as an excuse and leaned over the sitting boy, hands resting casually on Potter’s hips.</p>
<p>The boy’s face was flushed now, and his breathing heavy. He looked conflicted, but made no move to remove his professor’s hands.</p>
<p>Slughorn had a cruel smile, but thankfully the boy couldn’t see it from his position. “Harry, is everything alright, you look rather flustered?”</p>
<p>Harry took a gasping gulp of air, turning to look at his professor. His eyes were almost glazed. “S…sir…”</p>
<p>Slughorn kept his smile internal this time. It was delicious to see the reactions just a little touching was causing. Ohh yes, his potions had definitely taken effect. Ten nights worth of it in his system? The poor child was a bundle of lust and nerves. He likely didn’t know why he was reacting to his professor’s touch this way. Likely wasn’t even sure if Slughorn’s touches were innocent and it was all in his mind…</p>
<p>It was delicious.</p>
<p>“There, there boy. You just relax and focus on your work and let me straighten you up…”</p>
<p>Slughorn made a show as though he was adjusting Potter’s clothes. As though he was just a helpful father figure making sure a young boy was straight and neat. But his eyes were carefully on the boy’s trouser covered crotch, observing as he adjusted the shirt and made a point of letting his hands ‘innocently’ brush across Potter’s cloth covered nipple.</p>
<p>And yes! There it was. A definite movement in the poor lad’s trousers. The bulge was suspiciously large, and if that wasn’t enough evidence there were noticeable twitches every-time Slughorn ‘accidentally’ brushed against the boy’s bare skin.</p>
<p>Ohh yes. Poor Potter likely didn’t know what to think. Other than he was enjoying his professor’s touches anyway. No doubt the boy would make a beeline for the bathroom as soon as their session ended.</p>
<p>Slughorn wasn’t quite yet ready to fully ready to abandon the veneer of innocence to their touching. But with the way Potter was reacting? Soon he would get to taste his forbidden fruit. And soon he would have the boy begging for it, shaping him to be properly appreciative in all the right ways. Soon. Very soon.</p>
