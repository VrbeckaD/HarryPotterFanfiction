    <p>Prologue</p>
<p>10 years after the end of the great wizarding war, the rumours were still there. There was still speculation about where these lost war heroes could be.</p>
<p>Hermione Jean Granger. War heroine. Part of the Golden Trio that played a crucial role in the defeat of Lord Voldemort. Missing now for 10 years. Directly after the end of the great Wizarding War, Hermione Granger disappeared. Nobody knew where she went, not even her closest friends.  Fellow members of the Golden Trio, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, were completely baffled by their best friend's sudden and mysterious disappearance.</p>
<p>There are many theories about where our favourite muggleborn could be: from crazy stories about her running off to elope with Draco Malfoy to theories that she went to find her parents after having erased their memories for their own protection. However, no one knows the truth behind Miss Granger's disappearance. Or at least not many people know the truth that could tip the wizarding world on it's side.</p>
<p>It may seem like the only one who went missing according to my guide was Hermione Granger, but that is far from the truth. Many chose to leave the wizarding world as a result of the horrors of the Great Wizarding War.</p>
<p>Included in the list of departures was that of Luna Lovegood, Ravenclaw member of the Big Six (Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood). Originally thought to be spending time with her father, Hogwarts’ reopening banished these ideas as Luna did not return. When her father was spoken to, it was revealed that he had not seen her since the end of the great war, and that she told him that she was spending time with her friends over the period of rebuilding for the wizarding world.</p>
<p>Many others disappeared too - mainly former Slytherins. The fall of Lord Voldemort led to the capture of his Death Eaters - many of whom fathered students at Hogwarts. Shamed by their fathers, they ran (often along with their mothers) in a desperate attempt to start anew in a new place.</p>
<p>The most famous of these vanished Slytherins was Draco Malfoy. After his trial - where he was found to have only been a Death Eater to protect his mother from Voldemort’s wrath - he and his mother (Narcissa Malfoy) fled. No one had seen them since.</p>
<p>Rumours flew about all those who disappeared; most of them were utter rubbish. However even today - 10 years after the end of the war - people are still talking about Hermione Granger. Where did she go? Who did she go with? And most importantly: why did she leave?</p>
