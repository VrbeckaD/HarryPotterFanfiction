  <b>Chapter 1: The Man Who Lived</b>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sit down, Black,” Moody growled from behind his desk in the Head Auror office. He jabbed one crooked finger at the empty chair in front of him, that single gesture managing to convey all of his impatience with the man standing in his office. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius dropped into the offered seat with a casual air that implied he was much more relaxed than he felt. He propped one ankle on the opposite knee and twirled his wand in his hand as he waited for Moody to crack. It didn’t take long, he was an impatient bastard, after all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Spit it out, Black! I don’t have all day,” Moody barked irritably. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius flashed him a grin. “I want to re-apply to the Auror program.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you daft, boy?” Moody asked him gruffly. “Minister Bagnold has insisted that you be reinstated immediately. Don’t think for a moment that I will give you any slack just because you are the bloody ‘Man Who Lived’, you hear me? I expect you to report for duty eight AM sharp on Monday morning. Now get out of my sight!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a wave of Moody’s hand he was dismissed, and Sirius stood slowly and left the surly Auror’s office. He passed through the various cubicles and offices of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and caught the next lift to the lobby. There were several inter-office memos flitting about overhead but he ignored them in favor of brooding. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bloody ‘Man Who Lived’, indeed, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thought. Trying to get around in public or do anything like a normal wizard was proving to be impossible since the war ended. It had been a month now, but the press and crowds mobbing him at every turn had barely slowed at all. It was maddening that he was getting treated like some sort of hero when he hadn’t actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>done </span>
  </em>
  <span>anything. He had just </span>
  <em>
    <span>not died</span>
  </em>
  <span>. How could one even become famous for </span>
  <em>
    <span>not dying</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Hell, loads of people did that every day and no one was making a fuss over them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What he wanted to do was try to go back to living as close to a normal life as he could now that the war was over. He could hardly do that when he was being stalked by strangers and given special treatment by the bloody Minister for Magic. He had thought that going back to work and giving himself something to do would help. He was beginning to wonder just how realistic that was. At first, it had seemed like a good way to occupy his time and earn some extra galleons. Now, though, he wondered how he would be able to work effectively if he was mobbed everywhere he went. Plus, it seemed as though the Ministry was determined to use him as some sort of mascot.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius pulled up the hood of his coat as he stepped from the Ministry lobby and out onto the streets of London. December had just begun and winter had taken hold of Britain. The air was quite brisk although his hood was more to avoid being recognized than it was for warmth. He kept his head tucked and walked at a quick clip down the sidewalk, hoping to avoid any incidents. The last time he had ventured out of his flat it had only taken one meddlesome woman to blow his cover. She had recognized him from all the pictures that had been appearing in the papers lately. All it took was her gasping, ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>It’s Sirius Black, The Man Who Lived!</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ and he suddenly found himself being engulfed in a crowd of well-wishers and simpering idiots wanting his autograph. It was bad enough that there were endless owls delivering letters and packages to his flat at all hours of the day and night. He couldn’t go anywhere without someone trying to take a picture of him, or follow him, or propose marriage to him (which had actually happened twice last week). </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He rounded the corner to the side street where his motorcycle was parked. He was happier than ever that he had bought it and spent the time fixing it up. It wasn’t exactly riding weather anymore as the days were getting darker and colder, but he had found that this was the best way of avoiding the press and any others that might recognize him. He swung a leg over the chrome-plated beauty and gunned the engine before taking off towards the flat he shared with Remus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Twenty minutes later, he pulled up in front of their building and parked his bike. He trotted up the steps to the front door and then up another flight of stairs to the second floor. He walked through the unlocked door of their flat and shrugged off his coat. He could smell Remus’ Earl Gray tea and he strolled into the sitting room expecting to see his boyfriend, but most definitely </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span> expecting to see Albus Dumbledore sitting on his sofa. Sirius stopped dead two steps into the room and looked accusingly at Remus. He had received several owls from Dumbledore requesting a meeting and had been avoiding the old wizard. Truth was, he was still pissed off at Dumbledore for sending Remus to the werewolves. He didn’t want to hear anything that manipulating man had to say to him. Not now, and maybe not ever. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus held up his hands to ward off Sirius’ angry glare, but it was Dumbledore himself who spoke in his defence. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I arrived unannounced, Sirius. Rather rude of me, I realize, but I have been trying to reach you for several weeks now. Remus here was kind enough to invite me in.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius gritted his teeth and forced a smile at his former headmaster. “I’m sorry I didn’t respond to your letters, but I have been getting rather a lot of mail lately. It’s been a bloody nightmare around here.” He gestured to the small mountain of scrolls, envelopes, and packages that were piled up in one of the armchairs. “Those are just from today. I’ve mostly taken to burning the lot every evening.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore nodded, an understanding smile on his face. “I can see how easy it would be for a letter or three to get lost in the mix. I do need to talk to you, however, if you could please sit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It grated Sirius’ nerves that he was being offered a seat in his own home. He bit back his sarcastic retort at the censoring expression on Remus’ face and sat down in the free armchair. He lit a cigarette he pulled from the pack on the coffee table and slouched back in his seat. “What was it you wanted?” he asked while exhaling a stream of smoke.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore took a sip of his tea before replying. “I wanted to ask you about Halloween night. About what happened before Voldemort vanished.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius pressed his lips together and narrowed his eyes at Dumbledore. “When he </span>
  <em>
    <span>vanished</span>
  </em>
  <span>? You don’t think he’s dead like the Ministry is saying?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore shook his head slowly. “There was no body recovered, and so I do not think he is truly gone. I believe he will return eventually. The Ministry is making a mistake by underestimating his power and resourcefulness.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius caught Remus’ eye across the room. He was frowning as he considered Dumbledore’s words. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sir, how is that possible? They found his wand in the debris of Malfoy Manor. If he was still alive, wouldn’t he have taken it? If he was still alive, would he have let Sirius live?” Remus inquired.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius directed his gaze back toward Dumbledore and awaited his answer. Moony had raised some good points with those questions. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore sighed. “Sirius, can you please tell me what happened when Peter died?” Seeing the look on Sirius face, Dumbledore raised a calming hand. “I promise, I will answer your questions.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius took a last drag of his cigarette and then stubbed it out in the ashtray. “Fine,” he snapped. “Pete stepped between myself and Voldemort. Voldemort told him to step aside and he refused, so he was killed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore leaned forward and put his teacup down on the table. “Did Peter cast any defensive spells? Did he fight back at all?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius shook his head. “He didn’t even have his wand drawn. He just stood there and refused to move, daft bugger.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Interesting,” Dumbledore murmured as he stroked his beard.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t see how watching one of my oldest friends murdered in front of me is </span>
  <em>
    <span>interesting</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Sirius grumbled, crossing his arms over his chest. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore leveled a stern look at Sirius over the top of his half-moon spectacles. “What is </span>
  <em>
    <span>interesting</span>
  </em>
  <span> is that by not fighting back, Mr. Pettigrew may have invoked a very old and powerful magic. I believe this may be what protected you from Voldemort’s killing curse and what caused it to backfire on him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t that mean he was killed, though?” Remus asked in confusion. “How can you be so sure he survived?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore held his hands palm up in front of himself. “I believe he was greatly weakened by the spell backfiring, but no, I don’t think he is dead. I think Tom would have gone to great lengths to protect himself from mortal death.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius scoffed. “That’s not even possible. How could he just beat death?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That remains to be seen,” Dumbledore answered vaguely. He stood up from their sofa and smoothed out his dark purple robes. “Well, I must be off. Thank you for the tea, Remus.” He nodded at Sirius and strolled out of their flat without waiting for a response.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As soon as the door clicked shut Sirius turned to Remus with a scowl on his face. “What the bloody fuck does that mean?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus shrugged and stood from his seat, picking up the empty tea cups and carrying them to the kitchen. “I have no idea, Pads,” he answered over his shoulder. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius followed Remus into the kitchen, his frown deepening as he walked. “This is bullshit. He clearly knows something more.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus sighed and placed the dishes in the sink before turning to face him. “Maybe, but I’m sure he has his reasons for keeping it secret.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t like being kept in the dark. Whatever he knows,</span>
  <em>
    <span> I </span>
  </em>
  <span>should know,” Sirius snapped angrily. “Why did you even let him in?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What was I supposed to do?” Remus threw his palms out in exasperation. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tell him to fuck off!” Sirius yelled. He was unreasonably angry and he knew it. He couldn’t manage to reel it in even though he knew it wasn’t fair to take his frustration out on Remus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He could tell Remus was getting pissed himself now, a red flush traveling up his neck. “Did it ever occur to you that I respect Dumbledore? That I owe him tremendously for even allowing me into Hogwarts?” he hissed through gritted teeth. “I’m hardly going to tell him to fuck off just because you are having a tantrum and don’t want to talk to him!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“See? This is exactly the problem, Moony! You lay yourself down at his feet because you don’t think you deserve anything! Dumbledore may have helped you then, but that doesn’t mean he is right all the time!” Sirius turned on his heel and snatched up his discarded coat on the way to the door. “I’m going out,” he growled before slamming the door behind him and taking off down the stairs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His motorcycle was still warm when he started it up. He could feel the residual heat from the exhaust pipes through his pant legs as he took off down the street. Sirius wasn’t sure where he was going. He thought about dropping in on Prongs, but reckoned that James would just tell him he was being an idiot. That was probably true, but he wasn’t in the mood to hear it. There weren’t that many places he could go right now. Anywhere in Wizarding London was out as he was bound to be recognized, and he definitely didn’t want to deal with that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That was how he ended up parking his bike in front of a bar in a rather seedy part of Muggle London fifteen minutes later. He cast a discreet </span>
  <em>
    <span>Notice Me Not</span>
  </em>
  <span> over it to deter thieves and tucked his wand back into his coat. He trudged into the pub and picked a stool at the bar. There were plenty to choose from as it was only about four PM on a Wednesday. Sirius ordered a whiskey when the bartender came over and pushed some pound notes across the counter. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He sat there for a while, swirling the amber liquid around his glass and chain smoking. He knew he was going to have to go home and apologize to Moony. He had been out of line, and it wasn’t Moony’s fault that Dumbledore showed up unannounced and pissed him off. That wasn’t really fair either, Sirius acknowledged. He had been in a bad mood before he even arrived home. All this </span>
  <em>
    <span>Man Who Lived</span>
  </em>
  <span> stuff was getting to him. He rubbed his forehead in frustration and stubbed out his cigarette before throwing a few more Muggle notes across the bar. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius returned home a bit buzzed and very sheepish three hours after he had stormed out. Remus was sitting on the sofa reading a book as usual and he raised an unimpressed eyebrow at Sirius when he came in. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius flopped down on the couch next to him and put his head on Remus’ shoulder. “I’m sorry, Moony,” he sighed. “I was an asshole.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus took the time to mark his place and close his book, resting it in his lap before turning toward Sirius. “You were,” he agreed. “But I understand. I know you’ve been having a hard time adjusting lately.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius nodded against Remus’ bicep. “I am, but it’s not just that. I’ve been so angry lately. It’s like I don’t have any control over how I’m feeling anymore.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus sighed and began to stroke Sirius’ long hair back from his face. “You’ve been through a lot in such a short time. It’s natural that you would be having trouble controlling your emotions.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m worried, Remus,” Sirius admitted as he burrowed his face into Remus’ chest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know, Pads,” Remus whispered as he wrapped an arm around Sirius’ shoulders and kissed the top of his head. </span>
</p>
