    <p>
  <span>Stupid lights.Enchanted ceilings that looked like stars.Loud student’s in an array of green, yellow, and red. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were burning into Harry's eyeballs and he resisted the urge to scrub at them as the colors and lights grew brighter and brighter turning neon instead of their regular pale. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He clenches his fist trying not to blow up at the bright neon blobs congratulating him on surviving the Basilisk. Saving Ginny. Defeating the monster terrorizing them. How they weren’t surprised that </span>
  <em>
    <span>The</span>
  </em>
  <span> Boy Who Lived did something heroic and won.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What a load of horse shit, not even a day ago they thought he was the prince of Slytherin out to kill them one “MudBlood” at a time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They bullied him ostracized him and now they were licking his freaking boots like he was their God. Clenching his fists tighter he breathes deeply trying to calm his racing heart. Continuing to accept congratulations Harry feels his head starting to throb. Accepting each congratulations with a smile on his face and food untouched his  mouth tastes like bitter poison. He wants to spit it out onto them and watch their faces burn while they scream in horror. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He can’t do this sit and pretend like they hadn’t been awful to him just because he can speak to snakes. He doesn’t want to sit here, so why is he? Why? What does he owe them? *</span>
  <em>
    <span>Not a damn thing that’s what* </span>
  </em>
  <span>his mind whispers to him. He owes them </span>
  <b>nothing</b>
  <span> all they do is judge and assume things about him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t go on fun adventures he went on death missions that gave him scars and made him feel pain that Vernon could never hold a candle to. His life wasn’t perfect at home,he got locked in a cupboard under the stairs. He barely got fed he got beaten if he breathed to loud. Life was not perfect it sucked hard and as much as he was appreciative of Hermione and Ron being his friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron kinda sucked, so easily distrusting of Harry, and his jealousy of his supposed wealth and fame was ridiculous he of all people should know he hated his fame and did not care about money. He wasn’t all that bad but his insecurities got annoying especially when they focused on Harry. Hermione wasn’t all that bad either but she got bossy and because she was so smart she had a bit of a talking down to people problem and being nosy about everything her friends were doing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All this could be fixed and ignored but it was not Harry’s job to fix their behavior and honestly he was quickly losing his ability to ignore their problems. He wasn’t perfect by any means and he had no right to judge but he had enough of his own problems already he didn’t need more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> He was sick of everything and everyone he just wanted peace and it made him angry he wasn’t getting it and probably never would. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry abruptly stands up his chair scraping against the floor causing the neon lights to stop and fall silent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fists still tightly clenched “Excuse me but I’m tired and I am retiring to my room, have a nice dinner and night” Harry speaks with a smile, teeth clenched. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He walks fast ignoring the calls of Hermione and Ron. He doesn’t stop or slow on the way to his room mind only on getting away. Entering his room he reaches his bed and sits down. He opens his hands slowly ignoring the pain ripping throughout his hands. There’s blood in his hands his nails tore into his skin leaving red leaking indents in his skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Closing his eyes Harry leans back onto his bed sighing deeply. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Meow” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes snap open, sitting up quickly wand already in hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looks down and promptly relaxes it’s just a black cat. “Hi kitty,” reaching down to pick her up “where’d you come from” Harry pets her fur coat that’s as dark as ink. He looks into her emerald eyes, that slightly glow, power wafting off her in waves. *</span>
  <em>
    <span>This isn’t a normal cat</span>
  </em>
  <span>.*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry starts to search her looking for a collar, a name tag, any sign that she belongs to someone. The only thing he finds is a black envelope hidden in her dark fur. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry turns it over in his hands only the words </span>
  <b>Please Read all of it first</b>
  <span> in white ink written on it. All he feels is dread, why does someone want him to read the letter first before he ….what? Told someone about it, what could possibly be in this letter that he’d immediately go tell someone about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Opening the letter, Harry almost drops it reading the first sentence </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>From: Sirius Black</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>To: Hadrian Potter</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Quickly getting up, the cat jumping off him onto the floor; Harry decides to show this to Dumbledore he’ll know what to do.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> ‘Please </span>
  <em>
    <span>read all of it first’ </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stops, this is why he was told to read it first it was known he’d turn it in to someone. He sits back down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>*maybe I should read it before turning it in, it’s not like someone’s gonna die if I don’t do it now*</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry crawls onto his bed closing the bed curtains. He doesn’t want someone to see him reading the letter, more importantly he doesn’t want Ron to see him reading it he’d ask him about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Opening the letter back up Harry reads the first sentence again. Why did it say Hadrian and not Harry? Maybe he’d find out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Pup, I know you recognize my name and the first thing you thought was me betraying your parents to Voldemort resulting in their death.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>     I am writing this letter to tell you I did not betray your parents. I know this sounds hard to believe I am after all a prisoner that escaped from Azkaban. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>     There is nothing I can tell you to make you believe me, but I can tell you my side of the story. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <em>
    <span>You see years ago twelve long years ago I was your father's best friend. He was like my brother I would’ve done anything for him I did do anything for him. Including being his secret keeper an incredibly dangerous task considering we were in the middle of war and Voldemort was after James and other Order of the Phoenix members. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>    The thing is I never became his secret keeper it would’ve been too obvious so I suggested he made Peter his secret keeper. After all Peter was so harmless and unassuming who’d suspect him, to this day I regret that decision. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>    Your parents made him the secret keeper and not too soon moved to Godric Hollow. On the night your parents died I had went to Peter's hiding place and found him missing this worried me as their was no sign of struggle or a note left behind. So I went to Godric Hollow worried James and Lily had been harmed or worse. My fears were quickly confirmed I found your parents dead Lily laying in front of your crib. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>     You were shrieking and even though I wanted nothing more than to find Peter, as he was the only person other than me who knew where your parents were staying, but you were and still are more important than anything or anyone else. So I picked you up and took you to my flying motorcycle intending to take you somewhere safe. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>     But suddenly Hagrid showed up saying Dumbledore had sent him to bring you to him so he could take you to Petunia. I refused, I was suspicious, how did Hagrid and Dumbledore know what happened when I hadn’t even known.  As well as your parents would have killed me for giving you to Petunia they under no circumstances wanted you with her. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>    So I ignored him and started to continue on my way solely focused on you and your safety. When suddenly my mind was overcome with burning anger and all I wanted to do was kill Peter. It was strange, it was like I had completely forgotten you existed or just didn’t care and then I’m handing you to Hagrid a man I just a few minutes earlier didn’t trust at all, let alone trusted with you.  </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>    Then I’m off searching for Peter. Tracking him down in the street and confronting him, then he’s screaming that </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>I</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span> betrayed the Potters. He creates an explosion killing twelve Muggles and escapes through his Animagus form faking his death. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>    After that I get arrested by aurors, get tossed into Azkaban and told I’m there for killing the Potters and Peter. And that’s it, I never got a trial never got questioned nothing and I stayed imprisoned for twelve years. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>   I know this sounds like poppycock and that you’re probably going to read this and give it to the authorities and be done with it. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>   But if some part of you believes me even a little bit I have a package for you with something in it that will allow you to speak to me. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>  And if this is the end, I want you to know that I care for you no matter how you feel about me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>    I will always have your back, you will always be number one, and everything I do will be because I care for you and only you and just want you to be happy. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>   You will </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>always </em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span>be my Pup. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry didn’t know how he was supposed to feel. He just had more questions why was Sirius arrested without trial? Why did peter betray his parents? Why did Sirius suddenly decide to leave him with Hagrid? How did Dumbledore know? Why was he put with Petunia if his parents never wanted him with her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Was he supposed to dismiss these words as lies or believe him and accept his package. Speaking of where was this package, as if reading his mind the black cat jumps back onto the bed a package in her jaws. She drops it onto Harry’s lap “thank you.”  The package is wrapped in black paper, black twine tied around it, another black envelope tucked under the twine. It seemed that Sirius had a thing for the color black. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He unties the twine and opens the envelope </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Pup this is an </span>
  </em>
  <b>
    <em>Animus Liber</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span> or soul book. It’s a book that when you touch it writes out whatever you’re thinking to respond to a message. It shortens the time of writing and can be useful for secretly communicating if you use a Reducio. And attach it to a necklace, you can always speak to me and I can speak to you. All you have to do is use a bit of blood press it onto a book page and say ‘et non sciatur.’  Only me and you will be able to access this the words printed out onto the pages it will disappear if someone other than you or me tries to open this. You can speak to me at anytime I’m always here for you Pup.  </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry thinks over the situation it was overwhelming to say the least. He couldn’t help but believe Sirius, he sounded so earnest and like he cared for Harry even though he never really got to know him. He can feel his throat tightening up as his eyes starts to fill with tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He just wanted someone that would be there for him and only him, to care about his happiness and do anything for him no strings attached. Was that so bad to want that? He didn’t think so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And maybe he was being dumb and getting tricked by a evil man who truly cared nothing for him. Or maybe just maybe, it was someone who was wrongly imprisoned and just wanted to care for him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry making a snap decision rips the paper of the book and opens to the first page. Smearing the blood from his earlier injury onto it he speaks “et non sciatur” he feels his magic rise up from his core and crawl into his hand pulsating into the page. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The book lights up blinding Harry for a second. He can feel something dark and pulsating reach out to him. From the intensity he can tell it’s dark magic but instead of being scared and tossing the book he allows the magic to reach him. It’s warm and comforting yet so dark it sends a thrill down Harry’s spine, is this what Sirius feels like dark but warm, comforting, and a little thrilling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t think he’d mind that it seemed just right for the kind of person he thought Sirius might be. A dark pulse suddenly jumps out startling Harry and turning his attention back to the book. He sees a word start to spell out, it says just one word. </span>
