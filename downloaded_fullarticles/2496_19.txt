    <p>Harry gulps, his gaze fixed on the bright red neon sign that seems to be screaming at him to turn around and go back to the Ministry. Why Robards thought it was a good idea to send Harry to this place really is beyond him. He’s pants at glamour charms and after what happened on his last mission, it should be a given that he should be the last person to investigate a gay strip club. Then again, Robards seems to think Harry’s straight and Harry doesn’t really feel the need to correct him.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he walks across the street and waits for the bouncer to open the door. He does, and to Harry’s surprise, there are no comments about The Boy Who Lived entering a strip club. Huh. His glamour must be working.</p><p>He presses his lips into a tight line as he descends the stairs. He walks into a dimly lit room, the music vibrating through him. There are only a few customers scattered around the stage in the middle of the room. Harry picks a seat in the darkest corner, far away from the others and orders a firewhisky. He peeks at the dark haired dancer and slowly relaxes. Maybe he can do this after all.</p><p>His eyes scan the room, taking in every detail. There are several doors with hearts painted on them; Harry assumes they’re reserved for private dances. Rumour has it the dancers are selling illegal potions in there. Harry has to get into one of them. His mind races, trying to come up with a plan, while he pretends to sip at his firewhisky.</p><p>He only realises the stage is empty when the music suddenly stops and the spotlights are pointed at the red velvet curtain. He doesn’t know why, but a weird sense of foreboding and anticipation builds in the pit of his stomach as a new song starts blaring through the speakers and the curtain is suddenly wrenched apart.</p><p>Harry inhales sharply and nearly drops his glass when he catches sight of white blond hair and a lean, toned body he remembers all too well from the Quidditch showers.</p><p>“What the actual fuck,” he splutters. He can already feel his cheeks heating up and it’s only going to be a matter of time until he—Great. He’s already done it. He’s invisible. Fuck. Then again, maybe it’s for the best. Even if he’s wearing a glamour, he wouldn’t want Malfoy catching ogling him.</p><p>Harry shifts uncomfortably in his seat as Malfoy approaches the pole and grabs it with one hand. His tight black boxer brief leave very little to the imagination and the sight of his bare chest has Harry gasping for air.</p><p>Malfoy moves skilfully, swinging his hips in a way that should definitely be illegal. Harry can’t suppress the gurgling sound in the back of his throat as Malfoy wraps one of his legs around the pole and starts spinning. Damn it, he has to concentrate. He’s here to work, not to drool over Draco sodding Malfoy. What is the git even doing here?</p><p>Harry closes his eyes and takes several deep breaths. He wills his pulse to slow down and tries to shove Malfoy and his beautiful body out of his mind. He peeks down at his hands and sighs in relief when he finds he isn’t invisible anymore. Good. He straightens himself, avoiding the stage and letting his eyes roam the rest of the room instead. Everybody seems to be mesmerised by whatever Malfoy’s doing. Did he… take off his boxer briefs? Is he—No! Harry can’t risk it. He can’t look. He can’t—Damn it!</p><p>His gaze inadvertently flicks over to Malfoy’s arched back. Merlin’s fucking beard. Well, at least he’s not naked. Yet. Harry can’t help but stare at him as he rubs his body against the pole, his lips stretched into a smug grin. He knows exactly how alluring he is.</p><p>Harry’s grip on his firewhisky tightens. This is absolute torture. He nearly chokes when Malfoy bends down and runs his fingers over his legs; that’s when their eyes finally meet. Something flickers across Malfoy’s face, but it’s gone so quickly, Harry wonders if he only imagined it. He takes a swig, knowing full well how unprofessional it is, but the burn of the firewhisky is such a welcome distraction, Harry doesn’t really care. He slams down the glass and curses under his breath. He made himself invisible again. Fantastic. Ugh. It’s no use. He’ll have to abort the mission.</p><p>Internally grumbling, he jumps out of his seat. Before he even reaches the stairs, however, he feels a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“Going so soon?”</p><p>Harry stiffens.</p><p>“Didn’t you like my performance?”</p><p>He slowly turns around and tries not to show any reaction when he finds Malfoy smiling at him.</p><p>“Wait, you can see me?”</p><p>Malfoy’s smile widens. “We’re trained to see more than the usual wizard notices. You wouldn’t believe how many people try to sneak in here using poorly executed charms.”</p><p>Harry blinks. Does that mean Malfoy can see past the glamour? No, there’s no way.</p><p>“You’re cute,” Malfoy says and casually brushes his fingers against Harry’s arm. “Could I maybe interest you in something… a little more intimate?”</p><p>Harry gulps. Shit. This is a really bad idea. But it’s why he’s here, isn’t it? As soon as he nods, Malfoy drags him to one of the doors with the hearts on it. Trying to act very discreet, Harry quickly casts a Patronus and sends it back to the Ministry. If something happens to him, at least the others will know.</p><p>“Take a seat,” Malfoy says sweetly, gesturing to the red sofa on their left before he slams the door shut and locks it with a nonverbal spell. Dear Merlin. Harry has to concentrate. He has to stay focused.</p><p>“So, um, how much?” he mumbles.</p><p>“Hmmm, that depends,” Malfoy grins, pushing Harry down on the sofa and climbing onto him.</p><p>Harry’s heart nearly jumps out of his chest. Draco Malfoy is straddling him. And he’s playing with his hair. What the actual fuck.</p><p>“A quick one is usually fifty Galleons,” Malfoy says. “Anything that’s more than five minutes starts at a hundred Galleons.”</p><p>“Five minutes?” Harry frowns, trying to ignore the movement of Malfoy’s hips. “What exactly are we talking about here?”</p><p>Malfoy laughs and puts his hands on the back of Harry’s neck. “This.” He moves his hips even more suggestively, pressing his crotch against Harry’s. Sweet Mother of Merlin.</p><p>“Oh!” Harry closes his eyes, gripping the edge of the sofa. “I—I thought, um—”</p><p>Malfoy snorts and Harry can feel his breath on his face. “This isn’t a brothel, you know.”</p><p>“Of—Of course,” Harry stammers. “That’s not what I—Oh!” Damn it, he has to focus. He blinks, unwelcome heat coursing through him as Malfoy continues grinding against him.</p><p>“Here, drink this,” Malfoy says, shoving a vial at Harry’s chest.</p><p>“What—What is it?”</p><p>“A simple antidote. It should reverse whatever spell was cast on you.”</p><p>“How do you know—”</p><p>“Let’s just call it a hunch.”</p><p>Harry squints at the vial and shakes his head. “I can’t drink this. I don’t know what’s in it.”</p><p>“It’s an antidote,” Malfoy repeats and lets his hands slide down Harry’s chest. “I brewed it myself.”</p><p>“You did?”</p><p>“I’m about to become a Potions Master,” Malfoy shrugs.</p><p>“What are you doing here, then?”</p><p>“Making some extra money,” Malfoy grins. “People have told me I’m quite good at my job. Both of my jobs.” Malfoy does some sort of body roll that leaves Harry utterly breathless.</p><p>“Ah, so you—you sell your potions here?”</p><p>“Sometimes. Mostly medical potions.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry lets out a shuddering breath, unable to fight the urge to touch Malfoy. He groans as his fingers dig into the soft fabric of Malfoy’s boxer briefs.</p><p>“No, no,” Malfoy sniggers, grabbing Harry’s wrist. “No touching.”</p><p>Harry gapes at him.</p><p>“Well, okay, maybe I’ll let you grab my arse once, only once, after you drink this.” He nods at the vial in Harry’s hand.</p><p>Harry hesitates. He shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t. But he needs to know more about these potions. And, if he’s being honest, he really doesn’t want Malfoy to stop doing… what he’s doing. Even if this turns out to be poison, his colleagues know where he is. He sent a Patronus. They’re probably already on their way.</p><p>Mentally berating himself, he uncorks the vial and downs it in one gulp. It doesn’t taste like anything and… he doesn’t feel any different.</p><p>“Ah, much better,” Malfoy grins. “I was getting a headache from having to squint at you.”</p><p>Harry’s mouth falls open when Malfoy buries his hands in his hair and moves his hips with even more determination. Fuck, he’s getting hard. This is… too much. But who can blame Harry? Malfoy is beautiful. The way he’s moving is beautiful.</p><p>Harry bites back a moan, his hands automatically fumbling for Malfoy’s arse, when Malfoy pushes his own erection against Harry’s.</p><p>“So, you—Ah! You do that with all your clients?”</p><p>A smirk pulls on the corner of Malfoy’s mouth and he leans closer, his lips grazing Harry’s ear.</p><p>“Not really,” he whispers. “I made a special exception for you, Potter.”</p><p>“W—What?” Harry freezes. No, it can’t be. He can’t know— “Damn it, the potion!”</p><p>Malfoy sniggers and shakes his head. “I knew it was you before you drank the antidote.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Your glamour was awful.” He leans in again and Harry shudders as Malfoy brushes his fingers through his hair. “I’d know you anywhere, no matter what you look like.”</p><p>Harry swallows around the sudden lump in his throat. “Oh.”</p><p>Malfoy’s lips stretch into a grin while his fingers wander down to Harry’s cheek, his jaw. “Are you here to arrest me, Auror Potter?” Malfoy whispers. His tone is playful and innocent; it makes Harry want to grab him and snog him senseless.</p><p>“I—”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I’m not here to arrest you.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Harry shudders once more when Malfoy brushes his fingers against Harry’s neck. He should be embarrassed that his body is so receptive to Malfoy’s touch. He should be embarrassed that he’s panting and staring at Malfoy’s lips. But somehow, that is the least of his concerns right now. He’s far more interested in the tiny mole on the right corner of Malfoy’s mouth. He’s far too absorbed in the sensation of Malfoy’s body pressed against his.</p><p>“Why are you here, then?” Malfoy asks, moving so close that his nose brushes against Harry’s.</p><p>“I—I—”</p><p>“You were never good with words,” Malfoy smirks before he tilts his head and presses his warm lips against Harry’s.</p><p>Harry groans, feeling his heartbeat in his throat, and wraps his arms around Malfoy. His skin is smooth and so incredibly soft it seems unreal.</p><p>“Hmmmm,” Malfoy practically purrs. He opens his mouth and Harry nearly chokes when he traces the line of Harry’s bottom lip with his tongue. Harry desperately wants to return the favour. Unfortunately for him, it only results in him biting his own tongue as at this very moment, the door springs open, revealing a horde of agitated wizards.</p><p>“Harry! Harry! We came as fast as we could! We—Harry?”</p><p>“Ron!” Oh boy. Suddenly, Harry wishes he was invisible after all. Seems like Ron brought the whole Auror Department with him. Great.</p><p>“Oi, Malfoy!”</p><p>Malfoy twists around, keeping his hands in Harry’s hair. “Yes, boss?”</p><p>“We’re not that kind of club! You’re fired!”</p><p>Malfoy merely rolls his eyes.</p><p>“Um, Harry? What the fuck is going on?”</p><p>“Ron, I can—”</p><p>“Your Patronus said to come find you.”</p><p>“Oh, you wanted them to watch?” Malfoy smirks. “I didn’t know you had it in you.”</p><p>“Oh Merlin, someone stun me,” Ron groans.</p><p>“Just, um—Wait outside for me,” Harry says. “I’ll be out in a sec.”</p><p>“Not in my club!”</p><p>“Relax, boss. We weren’t doing anything,” Malfoy says and slams the door shut with a flick of his wrist. “Yet.”</p><p>Harry blinks at him. “What?”</p><p>“Don’t get your hopes up, Potter. You’re not getting it that easily.”</p><p>“What do you—”</p><p>“Take me out on a date,” Malfoy says, leaning in.</p><p>“Um, you know I have to bring you in for questioning, right? You were selling illegal potions in here.”</p><p>“Medical potions,” Malfoy points out once more.</p><p>“Still.”</p><p>“Not the kind of date I had in mind, but alright.”</p><p>“Well.” Harry bites the inside of his cheek. “Maybe I could take you out to dinner afterwards?”</p><p>Harry’s heart stops when Malfoy smiles at him.</p><p>“That’s more like it.” He pulls Harry into another kiss and hums when Harry presses his hand against the small of his back. “But you’re buying.”</p><p>“What?” Harry laughs.</p><p>“You got me fired.”</p><p>“Weirdly enough, I don’t feel that bad about you not having to dance half naked in front of strangers anymore.”</p><p>“Jealous, Potter?” Malfoy snorts.</p><p>“Not exactly, just—” He reaches up and strokes Malfoy’s face. “Not everyone deserves to see you like that.”</p><p>For the first time, Malfoy looks speechless and taken aback.</p><p>“And you do?” he asks, the corner of his mouth twitching.</p><p>“Oh, I—I didn’t mean—”</p><p>“Merlin, Potter,” Malfoy sniggers and wraps his arms around Harry’s neck. “You get flustered so easily. You’re an awful spy.”</p><p>Harry narrows his eyes at him but quickly forgets about feigning indignation when Malfoy cups his cheeks.</p><p>“Now stop being so soppy and kiss me.”</p>
