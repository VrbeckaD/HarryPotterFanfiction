    <p>Sirius,</p><p>You can guess what day it is. I’ve had a bitter taste in my mouth all day, and I don’t know whether it’s from the overwhelming heartbreak that I’m drowning in or blood from gnawing on the inside of my cheek. You always told me that was a habit I needed to quit. </p><p>It’s pouring out. Remember how you used to love turning into Padfoot so you could eat the raindrops? That was always something that could make me laugh -- the kind of laugh that I could feel deep in my stomach. The kind of laugh that made my throat raw. I haven’t laughed like that in a long time. </p><p>I don’t know why I’m writing you. That’s a lie. I do. But I should be angry, shouldn’t I? I should be furious at you for giving away a life that we worked so hard for. I should be seeing red from anger, knowing damn well what events lead to a year ago today. </p><p>Everything in the flat reminds me of you. It’s the kind of hurt that’s suffocating, reaching down my throat until I can’t breathe. It’s been a fucking year, and I haven’t had the energy to change your pillowcase. If I concentrate really hard, I can still smell hints of you -- hints of us. A mixture of cinnamon and chocolate and coffee. All of your colognes are still sitting on the top of the dresser. I haven’t touched them. Hell, I haven’t touched anything. I can’t bring myself to get rid of your things. After all, they’re all I have. But the thing is, it’s like living with a ghost. You’re here, but you’re not. Sometimes I find myself reaching out to touch you, but the only thing my hand meets is empty air.</p><p>I can’t remember the last night we spent together -- the night before everything happened. I can’t even remember the last thing you said to me or the last thing I said to you. A part of me hopes I said something cruel, but the other part of me hopes that I told you how much I love you. Can you see my predicament?</p><p>I miss you every second of every day. My mind is plagued with the idea that you’re existing here, in the same world that I am, but you’re not with me. I hate you for not being with me. God, I hate you so fucking much. Or, I wish I did.</p><p>I’m still trying to wrap my weary mind around what the fuck happened. I don’t understand why you did what you did, and I don’t think I ever will. But Lily and James, Sirius? Not to mention Peter. You might not have killed them, but you certainly took their lives. </p><p>I’m exhausted. Every day is so fucking hard. I wake up thinking of you, and I go to sleep thinking of you -- that is, when I can fall asleep. I can’t seem to stop the dreams, no matter what I do. You’re always there, and so are Lily and James’ vacant eyes. </p><p>I keep thinking about our first kiss. I wonder if you do, too. It was by the Black Lake the day we got back from our Christmas holiday in 7th year. The lake had frozen over at the edges, and I could see your breath. There was no one around, since we were the only ones mad enough to be out in the cold. </p><p>You made the first move. We were talking about home, of all things, and what it meant to the both of us. I rambled on about Hogwarts being home, and when it was your turn, you told me that I was home. Then, you kissed me. Your lips were cold, and they were chapped. And yet, at the same time, they were the softest things I had ever touched. Kissing you felt like letting out a breath that I didn’t know I was holding. It felt like coming home after a long day. </p><p>I can still feel your lips on mine and the way we always held hands when we kissed. We used to spend hours just looking at each other in bed. I loved looking at the pale freckles that dusted your nose and the way your eyelashes were as black as midnight. I miss looking at you like that.</p><p>I still see you as the stupid, ridiculous, beautiful fifteen-year-old that decided it would be a good idea to pierce his own ear without any supervision. I don’t think of you as the murderer you inexplicably became. I can’t. Pushing the thoughts out of my mind and heart takes everything I have. </p><p>I haven’t seen Harry at all in the past year. He went to Petunia and Vernon. I hate knowing that you’re the reason that he’s going to grow up in that hell house. I’ve written them three times, begging to see Harry. They've refused every time. I miss the feeling of his soft skin when I would hold him. Whenever you and I babysat him, I always found myself thinking about what it would be like to have a child of our own. </p><p>The cycles have been rough since last year. I have a limp now, and the doctor I saw at St. Mungo’s said that there’s nothing I can do about it. I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the not too distant future, my body simply gave in. The wolf can feel the absence of you, Prongs, and Wormtail. He misses his pack. I miss my pack.</p><p>Things have just gone to absolute shit. I feel like crying all the time, and yet I don’t seem to have the energy to conjure any tears. I feel empty, but I feel heavy. I feel everything and nothing. Two absolutes.</p><p>I don’t know what I’m going to do for the rest of the night. I’d drink, but I don’t think alcohol would even begin to numb my heart. You’re smothering me, Sirius.</p><p>Remus</p>
