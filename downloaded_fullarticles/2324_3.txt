    <p>
  <span>Harry is volunteering at the shelter for the third time this week. Hermione says it’s because it’s a good distraction from going home alone, but Ron argues that he’s too nice for his own good. Knowing Hermione as he does, she’s probably right, not that he’ll ever admit it to her. After losing Sirius, being here is always the closest thing he can get to helping ease his remorse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s just that so many of the people there are there under unfortunate circumstances or paying for the mistakes made years ago. It makes it easier dealing with the world knowing he’s doing what he can about it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tonight, he’s handing out bowls of soup from behind the counter. Some of the people are externally grateful, giving him smiles sometimes showing some rotten teeth, others give a timid nod, while many don’t acknowledge him at all. Harry understands. No one wants to admit they need help and these people are no different, and it was sad that so many are to the point of even seeking it when it is clearly the last thing they want to do and their last resort. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Most who come to the shelter deep in the city of London are homeless, while others are incredibly poor, here for the free meals. Harry likes to imagine their stories, and has even talked to some about how they ended up here. Harry is lucky. His parents left him enough to get an education when they died and from there he was able to create his own company.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A young man that couldn’t have been more than a few years older than Harry had recounted how he had been living with his girlfriend when she wanted to end things, and instead of discussing the matter and splitting their assets and at least </span>
  <em>
    <span>talking</span>
  </em>
  <span> about the shared apartment, she had called the cops, claiming that he was abusive. He was kicked out of his own home and had no family to rely on, and lost his job shortly after. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s the stories like those that are the worst, knowing that just about anyone could end up in a similar, unexpected situation. The situations of bad luck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry is finishing up handing out the supper, nearly ready to begin on some of the dishes, when he shows up. He’s blonde, blonder than anyone Harry had seen in his entire life, and though he’s dirty as the rest of the people who live on the streets are, his hair is still smooth and it’s clear that the man has at least attempted to maintain it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His clothes aren’t in the best shape but they are nice, a pale blue button up and black jeans that hugs his arse, Harry can’t help but notice, and it’s a rare sight for someone to have such clothing. In fact, the man himself is a bit of an enigma to Harry, somehow in some ways appearing to be of a high class while in others he very clearly is not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite his nicer clothes and somewhat kept hair, his face is sharp and angular, nearly elvish, and it’s clear the man hasn’t had a good meal in some time. Or perhaps it’s drugs that made him so thin. There are dark circles beneath his eyes, prominent against his pale complexion, and Harry suddenly comes back to himself to realize that the grey eyes are fixed on him, his brows pulled together with confusion and suspicion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ah. He was waiting for the bowl that Harry had probably been holding for an awkward amount of time. “Sorry,” Harry says, handing him the soup with an apologetic smile. The man is still looking at him in that intrigued way but he gives a tiny nod and takes the bowl and spoon to a table as far from other people as he can get. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Harry continues handing out soup, he watches the unusual man; he can’t help it. He is easily the most attractive person he’d ever seen in real life and it was disarming the way those eyes could stare right into his mind it seemed. The man places the paper towel he’s grabbed for a napkin on his lap and Harry almost chuckles if he wasn’t too busy gaping. He picks up the plastic spoon and holds in almost delicately in his hand and begins to eat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s definite, then. The man has clearly been brought up in a wealthy, upperclass family and has been bred to eat and behave in a certain way. But what is he doing here? Harry watches until he’s finished his meal and heads over to one of the many cots they have set up and lies down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man is back the next day, and the day after that. Everyday, he comes in at night with one of those reusable grocery bags that Harry assumes contains his clothes and things. He comes in when dinner is almost over, eats in his prim and proper way, and then goes to sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry tries not to watch him, tries to give him his space each night, but it’s growing increasingly difficult. He doesn’t quite know what it is about the man that disarms him so; perhaps the fact that he’s a sea of contradictions, both well dressed and living on the streets, unkempt in appearance but also disarmingly attractive. Maybe it’s just the last part, that he’s the most beautiful man Harry’s ever seen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry has had his share of relationships, as a man of some means, he has never found an issue with finding people who would be interested in him, but too many are after his money. Those people are good for the occasional one night stand but not much more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man never speaks, never says ‘thank you’ out loud, but his eyes show a slight glimmer of polite gratitude and he always gives Harry the barest of nods when he hands him supper. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry always shakes himself out of it when he catches himself watching the stranger eat with small, controlled bites as though he isn’t nearly skin and bone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t you take off early, you’ve seemed out of sorts lately,” Jason, a fellow volunteer says giving him a friendly pat on the back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nearly drops the plate he’s been washing, startled at having been caught and he’s sure his ears are as red as Ron’s hair. “I’m alright,” he gets out, setting the dish on the drying rack. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You work too hard, how do you ever have time for a social life?” Jason asks with a chuckle, taking the dish and drying it with a towel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry huffs a tired laugh and begins washing the next one. “I don’t. But you’re right, I have an early meeting tomorrow morning.” He gives a grateful smile as Jason takes his place at the sink. He gives a half wave to the other volunteers in the kitchen and heads back to his flat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The meeting goes well and the business has agreed to the sum that Harry’s company has offered, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>Merlin</span>
  </em>
  <span> is now the proud owner of yet another tech company. Harry’s company has focused for several years now on new forms of clean energy and hopefully cheaper technology so that information could be more readily available to anyone, not just the upper class. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because he’s exhausted and in desperate need of a caffeine break instead of lunch, Harry walks to the coffee shop two doors down. He orders a black coffee and is sitting at a table waiting when a platinum blonde head enters, holding a rectangular sign in his hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s wearing the same clothes as always but his hair is neater than Harry’s ever seen it, like the man has run a comb through it rather than his fingers. He cranes his head and reads that the sign says </span>
  <em>
    <span>Help Wanted</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So that’s what he does during the day, going around the city inquiring about job opportunities? The stranger brings the sign to the counter and Harry watches as the manager approaches, assessing the man from head to toe. His lips are set in a hard line and the blonde’s back is to Harry so he can’t see his expression. “You gotta record?” Ah. An American. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could you clarify what you mean?” the blonde asks in turn and his voice is smooth and his accent is southern, the lilt and tone of his speech clearly well practiced, likely due to his upbringing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, son,” the manager says, taking the sign from the other man’s hand, “we ain’t hiring.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The blonde man’s back straightens imperceptibly, his shoulders tensed with clear frustration. “But sir--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t hire felons, son. I’m sorry, but that’s policy. Now if you’re not gonna buy anything, I’ll have to ask you to leave.” The manager is large and his face shows that whatever patience he had a moment before is now gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he can think about it, Harry is standing. “But--” the blonde says but the manager interrupts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Listen, boy, either you leave here on your own or the cops can show you out.” Harry doesn’t know what the blonde will do; his shoulders are still tensed and ready, his body language now angry, but Harry doesn’t wait long enough to find out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grasps the man’s elbow to get his attention and murmurs, “Is this worth the trouble? Come on, let me buy you a coffee somewhere else.” The other man looks at him critically for a moment and glances back at the manager for a brief moment before searching Harry’s gaze. For what, he doesn’t know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, he nods and lets Harry lead him to the door. Harry distantly hears his name being called for his drink but he doesn’t turn back. They walk in silence to another café down the street and they sit in a cozy booth near the back. It’s a cheery place with pale green walls and forest colored seats. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Order what you want, I’m getting breakfast,” Harry says, glancing down at the menu. In his peripheral vision he sees the man watching him for a moment before opening his own menu. A waitress comes and fills up their cups with steaming coffee. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What can I get you this mornin’?” she asks warmly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have the omelete please,” Harry says closing his menu and smiling up at her. She writes his order down and returns his smile before turning to his companion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like the french toast if you please,” he says quietly but gives her a polite nod, the very same he gives Harry each night. The waitress nods and walks away to put their orders in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man gives Harry another assessing look, and it’s disarming how steely and closed off his eyes are as he looks at him with suspicion. It makes Harry wonder how much this man has gone through to make him so distrustful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve seen you before,” he states, seemingly as an opening to a conversation but he makes no effort to continue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I volunteer at the shelter. My name is Harry.” The stranger gives a small nod and adds cream and about three sugars to his coffee. Harry tries not to laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s almost certain the other man isn’t going to give away his own name as he hasn’t looked up from his coffee cup for some time now but as he finishes stirring, the steel eyes fix on Harry’s once more, nearly startling him. “Draco,” the man says without any other context so Harry assumes it’s his name. Peculiar though it is. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry takes a sip of his own coffee, black and hot how he likes it and Draco’s nose wrinkles in disgust. This time, Harry does chuckle aloud. Draco daintily sips his own coffee after placing his napkin in his lap, still grimacing at Harry’s cup. It’s the first emotion Harry’s seen on the other man’s face, who is usually so closed off and blank. He’s relieved to see him appear more human. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you in for, Draco,” he asks bluntly, figuring there’s little chance of him actually answering but that it’s worth it. He’s curious, afterall, and though it doesn’t look it, if it were a violent crime, perhaps Harry can get over this strange fascination with the handsome man he sees on the daily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco pauses in raising his mug, setting it down without taking a sip and giving Harry a hard stare for some time. Oh well, was worth a shot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Went through a dark time. Got hooked on coke and got busted but I’ve been clean for almost three years.” He’s blunt, factual, and puts no emotion into his words as though he is the hollow shell of what used to be a man and though he had hurt at the time, he no longer feels the pain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sit in silence for some time, each drinking their own coffees, if one could even call what Draco was drinking coffee anymore. “Do you have enough sugar for a refill?” Harry asks, half teasingly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looks surprised but there is mirth dancing in his eyes. Good, he has a sense of humor. “Better than the dirt mixed with water you’re drinking,” he retorts after a moment and Harry barks out a surprised laugh. Draco looks just as surprised as Harry by the joke and it’s almost endearing. “Why did you help me today?” Draco asks suddenly and Harry’s face quickly becomes serious, setting his cup back on the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Incarceration and parolee issues are very important to me,” he replies vaguely, not ready to share quite so much with a near stranger. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looks at him intrigued and opens his mouth to say something but is interrupted by the waitress placing their breakfasts in front of them. Draco promptly closes his mouth before opening it once more to give a quiet, “Thank you,” to the woman. She smiles and nods. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me know if you need anything,” she says before heading over to another table.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco puts an obscene amount syrup on his french toast and when a small chuckle escapes Harry’s lips, he looks up, eyes hard as though daring Harry to say something. But Harry just smiles and shakes his head and takes a large bite of his omelete so he has an excuse not to say anything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He glances back up at Draco and his eyes are slightly softer, humor dancing in the silver depths and he takes another syrupy bite with his brows raised. Harry tries to hold down his laugh because fuck that bite of omlette was too big and this is embarrassing, but his chest rumbles and gives him away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco gives him a look that is both disgusted but humored in a distasteful sort of way, but Harry is just happy he’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>entirely</span>
  </em>
  <span> grossed out by the bite that would have intimidated </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ron</span>
  </em>
  <span> of all people. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They eat in companionable silence for much of the meal, exchanging small talk. Harry tells Draco about his company and his aspirations for the future of it, stuff he knows isn’t all that interesting to an outsider, but Draco listens with a politely intrigued look, nodding and humming in all the right places as though he’s been bred to do so. And he probably has. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he begins to explain the importance of cheaper technology because knowledge in this world is power, Draco perks up, his expression going from politely bemused to genuinely interested in a heartbeat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, you work for the company </span>
  <em>
    <span>Merlin</span>
  </em>
  <span>? You work for the man with the whole clean energy, free information mission?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry flushes slightly; most people have heard of his company as the top growing enterprise to sell phones, computers, and things of the like, but not many know of Harry himself. He likes to keep his private life private, try as the press might to alter that fact. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco continues after a beat. “What’s his name, Porter? Potter? Have you met him?” He’s looking at Harry almost excitedly and it’s disarming how attractive he is when he smiles. Fuck. What was the question again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right. Potter. “I, uh, yeah. I’m Potter,” Harry stammers out picking up his nearly empty coffee cup and downing it so that he doesn’t have to look at Draco. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can see when he finally gets it because Draco’s face smooths over and he looks at Harry like he’s sitting naked in front of him. Harry hopes that’s not how he would look seeing him naked though… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s Harry fucking Potter doing at a shelter every goddamn day? There for the pea soup?” Draco asks, his voice sharp but in his eyes there is a glint like he is almost teasing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like I said, parolee issues are important to me. Too many people there made a mistake in another life and are still paying the price for it.” Harry’s voice is hard and quiet; he doesn’t feel like going down this road again, down the road that leads him to thoughts of Sirius. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco takes another bite of french toast and chews it consideringly. He eventually nods as though just having determined that Harry is not in fact there for selfish reasons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>While they wait for the check, Harry digs out a scrap of paper from his pocket. He writes his address down and hands it to Draco who is gazing at him speculatively. “If you want a real place to stay while you find a job, this is where I live.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looks at him and hesitates in taking the paper. Eventually, he does, looking over Harry’s messy handwriting. “Aren’t you married? Don’t you need to ask your wife before you invite hobos to stay with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry chuckles and shakes his head. “I live alone so no worries about the vengeful wife.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco gives a small smile and they walk out the door together. Harry turns in the direction of his office while Draco stops where they stand. He looks at Harry one last time before giving him a small smirk. “See you around, Potter.”</span>
