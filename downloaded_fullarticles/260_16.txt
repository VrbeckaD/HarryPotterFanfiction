    <p>Legolas took a deep breath of the fresh air filled with the scent of newly grown leaves and grass just touched by a warm spring rain and felt his shoulders relax.<br/>
He loved his home, he really did, but being out in the world away from watchful eyes was what he craved. He wanted to use the training that his strict father had made him go trough to actually protect his people, or others. What use was it that he sat at home while others where out there protecting him when he wanted to protect them.<br/>
If not for his training he was sure he would never use that bow of his. Well he didn’t want to search for a fight, nor a war, but Orcs were still out there killing and ravaging. He had heard the stories often enough.<br/>
<br/>
His father though would never allow him to partake. Messages he was allowed to deliver, but no son of Thranduil would scout the land as long as the Elvenking had his say. So he had taken it into his own hands to make his home a bit more save. Whenever he could, he would go out to the lands around Mirkwood to search for any treaty or danger that might brew without their knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Today seemed to be no different than most of his reconnaissance. The forest was bustling with animals, the birds enjoyed their spring song, a few foxes strolled down the small paths and a herd of deer to grazed between on the rich forest floor. The soft rushing of the small waterfall not far from here filled his senses and he smiled for he loved that small clearing where it was located.<br/>
<br/>
Moving on he decided to pay it a visit and maybe get a sip of water from the spring uphill. So deep in thoughts was he, that the blond elf nearly lost his footing when he noticed the very naked figure standing under the waterfall with his back to him. A hand brushed trough lush midnight black hair, shining like raven feathers that spilled down to his neck. He followed the trail of water down the beautiful sun browned skin stretched over lean muscles. Legolas breath hitched as he saw the shimmering scars that glinted silvery when hit by the right light. One scar especially caught his eyes as it ran down und the side of his back, over his hips and.. into the water.<br/>
<br/>
He was ripped out of his daydreaming as he realised what he was actually doing and Legolas felt the heat rush to his face. Ogling a stranger! He thought. Without his consent. His pride and honour took a great blow and he was about to turn around when the beautiful stranger turned.<br/>
Legolas forgot to breath as he caught sight of the most stunning eyes he had ever seen. Such rich deep green that they seemed to glow stronger than even the evergreen trees and the newest leaf and shining more than the most precious emerald but no gems could compare for the strangers eyes felt warm.<br/>
Water dropped down the long eyelashes that framed the deep green pools set into a face that seemed like a well carved statue. Legolas wondered for a heartbeat of he was Elven kin, but his heart dropped when he spotted round ears.<br/>
<br/>
The stranger had not noticed him and waded through the hip high water to the shore. His lean body glittering with water pearls in the sunshine.<br/>
To his utter embarrassment he felt not only his throat tighten, but also his nether regions.<br/>
I am not 100 years old anymore! He thought frantic. Roughly he remembered going through that strange face of his life.<br/>
Determined he turned around to give the man some privacy while trying to think of one of a million ways to approach this man. Or should he just walk away? But it was still dangerous to walk around unarmed on this lands.<br/>
Was the stranger even unarmed? Well right now yes, but he had forgotten to look for belongings of the mysterious male. He strained his ears to hear if he did have someone with him. But expect the rustling of clothes and the sounds of the forest he heard nothing. Not even a horse.<br/>
<br/>
A sharp noise suddenly ripped through the peaceful sound of clearing.<br/>
Legolas sounds around frantic searching for its source, but he saw none. Actually he saw nothing. The stranger was gone.<br/>
<br/>
The elf looked around with wide eyes and a hammering heart. He knew his sight was worth the praise of his teachers and even his father, but as he sprang from tree to tree and let his gaze roam freely through the forest there was no sight of the raven haired man.<br/>
<br/>
Until sunset did he search with not even a footprint on the ground nor a hair in the trees. Defeated he went back that day and uncaring of the punishment of his father should he find out where he had gone.<br/>
But no one held him up as he retired to his rooms and in his rest forests and jewels turned into eyes that haunted his dreams.<br/>
“Calenmîr.” The green jewel. He called him in his dream and in the many more that where to come.<br/>
<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
100 years later the Prince of Mirkwood strolled through the royal gardens. In his hand a framed emerald that hung on a chain around his neck.<br/>
He had gone to the best silversmith he knew, years after his encounter with his green-eyed stranger in a whiff of yearning, to find an emerald that would mirror the eyes of the man he had lost his heart to.<br/>
<br/>
He had told no one about his beautiful stranger for he knew they would laugh and tell him that no love could have bloomed in an encounter that was as short lived as theirs.<br/>
<br/>
No emerald had caught his attention and he had left a confused silversmith.<br/>
It was only when he had finally been allowed to venture out on his yet longest quest, to deliver the well wishes of Mirkwood to a new elfling, that he had met some of the petty long beard dwarfs - merchants on the road.<br/>
<br/>
They had sneered at him and he was sure called him names as vile as an Orc. And he would have nearly done the same if not for that gem that dangled side by side a ruby and a string of gold.<br/>
“Dwarf. The emerald around your neck. Is it for sale?” He had asked and his Elven party had stopped in plain surprise and so did the dwarf merchants that had not expected trade on the road and much less an offer from an elf.<br/>
<br/>
Their eyes where filled with mistrust and they mustered him for so long Legolas had was afraid they would refuse to bargain with elves. “What would you have that would interest us enough for such a stone?” One dwarf finally answered. “A tree or some vegetable?” The other laughed and the other soon joined. “What would an elf do with this gem? Gift it TO a tree? Does he even know it’s worth!” And they laughed harder.<br/>
<br/>
Legolas held his outraged companions back and gritted his own teeth. Starting a fight would do him no good in this situation and he knew so was being rude. He swallowed his pride and searched for the right words. They were proud and even prouder of their craft. Well. He thought. So where the smiths of his home and he would just imagine these dwarves were the same as his people and speak to them as such.<br/>
“I can see skill when there is such. And the emerald around your neck must have been found by a great eye and be polished by fine and skilled hands. How could I not admire such?” He asked them. The silence that followed was nearly deafening.<br/>
<br/>
The dwarf with the gems around his neck looked thoughtful at him while stroking his long beard.<br/>
“I am not sure if you are sincere, but if you are elf then you have a good eye. For this stone was found in great depths by masters of their craft and as masterful where the hands that elicited the purest form of this stone.” Then he seemed to wait for something and Legolas could not figure out what so he just nodded and tried his best to meet their eyes with nothing expect the wonder he felt for seeing a shadow of the eyes that had burned into his soul.<br/>
<br/>
Then a merchant with beard pearls started to speak in Khuzdul and the others soon followed. It was a heated but fast conversation. They turned back to him.<br/>
“What is it that you can offer?” They asked with a growl.<br/>
The prince of Mirkwood had tried to answer that question as well. He had but a few gold, silver and copper with him. He didn’t know how much an emerald was worth to the dwarves as he had never bargained with them before. He knew but the price back home, but none of the emeralds there held a soul as this one had.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at the elves that rode with him. Legolas would not ask them for money or possessions, his pride and loyalty was to big for that, but as his eyes wandered over their baggage his eyes fell on the presents and the articles of trade they were carrying with them. He met the eyes of and elf and said in Sindarin. “Mallendîr. Will you sell me part of your ware to trade? I feel bad for asking you this as I can only pay you back when we are back home. But by my honour I swear I will pay you back and make it worth your trade.” Mallendîr bowed on this horse and Legolas felt even worse, for he didn’t know if the elvish merchant felt that he actually could refuse him.<br/>
“Of course Prince Legolas. For if my ware brings you what you desire then it already is worth more that it ever could have been.”<br/>
He really hoped he meant what he said. Then the Prince took a deep and silent breath and turned around to bargain.<br/>
<br/>
At the end he had no gold left and some of the finest Elven silk had traded hands for an emerald the size of his thumbnail.<br/>
Since then he had let go of the emerald only once more and that was when the silversmith of Mirkwood had crafted the frame and chain for the stone.<br/>
<br/>
It had been enough to still a fraction of his longing.<br/>
Now he stared at the little gem while letting it slide through his fingers. He knew every edge, and every pane and because he never took it down the stone was always warm to the touch.<br/>
One-hundred years. He mused and painfully remembered the round ears. “A long time for man...”<br/>
<br/>
That night, when he sat down under one of the whispering trees, he looked at the stars and let himself wallow in sorrow, for he knew that the man he called Calenmîr would no longer wander on the same earth as he. </p>
