    <p>Gravestones lined the eerie graveyard, some recently placed, whereas others, cracked and crumbling. Mold covered the engravings dedicated to the dead, trees leaning towards the stones, branches reaching out to each other. Spiked, black fences surrounded the graveyard almost like it was a prison. The smell of old stone filled the dry air, weeds covering the graves of the dead, loved ones long since stopped visiting. Gravel paths weave through the maze of graves, allowing passersby to pay their respects to the people lined up in the earths embrace. The graveyard was so neat. Row upon row of white marble tombstones all rising from the manicured grass. Each one was perfect, polished and the same as all the others, except the name it bore. They were lined up perfectly with those in front and behind, a city block for the dead.</p>
<p>Teddy allowed a small ghost of a smile to cross his lips, hoping that he blended in as he came to visit, having chosen to forsake his robes for a simple black suit. No longer was his hair a bright, vibrant turquoise, but instead a mellow, dark brown, somber, fitting.</p>
<p>How Dad would have hated this place; Dad who loved everything eccentric and unique, obscure music and old poets; Dad who loved to be impulsive and could never be still a moment; Dad who was drawn to wild bracken and ivy over rhododendrons and roses. He had gone into the Battle of Hogwarts with Mom, both fought so that he could have a better life, a better world in which to grow up in, he should have been safe away from the battlefield. But his reflexes hadn’t been quick enough, according to those who knew him, after months of mastering defensive and protective spells and enchantments to protect his wife and baby, his reflexes had weakened. He had spotted her corpse on the ground and had gone into hysterics, seemingly no longer caring if he lived or if he died, and he was given a soldier's grave. So now he laid to rest in this exalted place, a fresh white rose every day and gardeners that fuss about with magical enchantments, doing whatever they could to keep the place neat. Teddy’s hands were empty as he passed through, no personal effects here were allowed, not even flowers, but the old caretaker didn’t know about his wand. The young man kept a steady count, one hundred twelve across, forty-nine down, and still, he was at only the edge. Finally, he found them. Buried side-by-side, together even in death. The disembodied voices of souls that once walked the earth seemed to be carried through the fog that was rising from the cracks in the porous path. It sounded like wind was whistling through the trees, but...there was no wind and not even the tiniest breeze. Tombstones were crumbling from the weathering that they had experienced throughout the years and the engravings had nearly disappeared. Teddy Remus Lupin both loved and hated it here. He missed them, he just wanted to see them, to know his parents. Teddy had only been a baby when they had passed, but according to his grandmother, the day after his parents had died, onlookers at their funeral had said, “Good mourning,” as if there was a gladness in the remembering, that they were able to take comfort, somehow. But who had helped his parents? Each who had been at the Battle of Hogwarts had stood by, watched Remus John Lupin and Nymphadora Lupin (nee Tonks) be murdered at the hands of Death Eaters. And then they dared to act as if it were a noble sacrifice, for their sakes, and for Teddy’s, but they just did not understand at all. That by loving their memory, the mourning became this wholesome and wonderful thing. They were cowards, these people, none of them willing to see the difference between honorable self-sacrifice, of which his parents had selflessly given their lives for him, and the Death Eaters had murdered them, and to his knowledge, were never killed during that fight, nor arrested for it.</p>
<p>Teddy found their graves and was hit with an immense wave of sadness. Guilt would do that, lock the truth in a cage and warp love into something strange and truly awful. Loving his parents meant he would have happily traded places with them in a heartbeat, fought until they either all lived, or they all died together, as a loving family.</p>
<p>And so, for Teddy, the mourning wasn’t good at all, it was only the start of the longest and darkest night there ever was, unceasing.</p>
<p>It was only in the stillness of the late evening that he could hear his parents calling his name. He would walk to the edge of the graveyard sometimes, past their graves and gaze out at the Thames.</p>
<p>The wind blew, tousling his hair, but to Teddy, everything had stopped. He no longer heard the Muggle traffic or noticed other people. To him, they were as if in a photograph—two dimensional and static. In that extended moment, his mind became at peace.</p>
<p>His parents were not gone, just out of reach for now.</p>
<p>Teddy did his best to stifle the choked sob that forced its way up into his throat, to no avail. Sniffling as he wiped away his tears with his oversized sweater sleeve, he pulled out the crumpled piece of paper from his jeans pocket, gingerly unfolding it with careful fingers. Taking a deep, shaking breath to settle his nerves, he read.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>A letter to my love, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
  <em>I’ve never been very good at talking. Whenever I try to express the emotions whirling around in my soul, my throat tightens, blocking me from saying anything. So, I will write to you instead. I never should have left you and Teddy alone when you were pregnant. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I realize that now, and I hope that one day, when you find this, though you have already forgiven me, you will do it again, because I cannot seem to find it within to forgive myself. I was weak, Dora. But let me make up for it now by being strong for all three of us. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I chased after something that looked good, but never truly had a place in my heart. Not like you and our unborn child do, love. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You were always there for me every time I chased after one obsession or another. You quietly stood by my side, supporting me. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Though I didn’t know it at the time, I loved you. I always will. You are more than just a best friend to me. I can tell you things easily and you just listen. You always make me laugh. I thought up to that point, I had my life figured out, but I didn’t. You asked me once to share my feelings. Merlin’s beard, where do I start? The truth is, Dora, for so long, I’d forgotten what those even were. For such a long time, I believed myself unworthy of love, thinking that it was never ending, and that it just…faded away until there was nothing except for a hollow heart. For so long, mine was hollow, bitter, cold. I’ve been stuck in one place. In a cave, you might say. A deep, dark cave. And then, that fateful night when you tripped over the umbrella stand in Number 12, Grimmauld Place, you came into my life, and…for the first time in a long time, I started to feel things again. I started to feel happy. But lately, I guess I’ve been feeling…distant from you, and I know that’s all my doing. I should not have left. I miss making triple decker pancake extravaganzas with you at sunrise, watching those Muggle movies you’re so fond of before we doze off. Without my knowing from the first moment I saw you, real love began to take shape in my heart. I only realized it when I saw you in the hallway with your broken toe and bright pink hair. You didn’t see me until I said something, but I looked at you then and realized that I love you. You were so different from other women in this world. You looked at me and you didn’t see my lycanthropy. You cared, Dora. Love radiates in your heart, spilling out into the lives of all those around you, especially me. You weren’t just pretty on the outside, you have a beauty deep within. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Space and time here have no meaning for my love for you and our unborn child, for it is boundless, eternal. It’s a love that self-sustains through even the harshest of winters, its own heat and the light being the warmth, the hope that our marriages brings our family. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Even if you were cold to your core, Dora, I would wake you like the spring wakes up a flower and watch you grow and blossom. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Everything that I am is yours. All I ask is that you take care of yourself in the same way you would care for me, completely, in the same way that I love you. I couldn’t be prouder of us, Dora. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Thank you, for giving me my life back. It’s been extraordinary, sharing the simple joys of life with you, and look what we made. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You and I are about to become parents, my love. Parenting is the one job you and I will never quit, Dora. Every day forward is a new chance to get things right, to guide and nourish our baby as he or she grows to develop into the person our baby is born to be. We’ll help our child find what he or she loves, what his or talents will lead to. And then, one day, when we’re older, we’ll have to let them go. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>We’ll be proud of them but watch in anxiousness as they try out their new ‘wings’. We’ll let our child know that our home is still their home should they ever need to return, and we’ll be here, just as before. Our baby, though it isn’t here yet, is our child for life, and our love for it is eternal, just as my love is eternal for you, Dora. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I hope you never forget this, and I can picture you even as I write this mouthing this next part, since I say it to you every chance I get.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Otherwise, I’ll have to remind you every single day. Until the end of the world.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
  <em>Love, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
  <em>Your husband. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fighting back an onset of fresh tears, Teddy folded the letter back into the envelope and tucked it back into his pocket. The sound of a man’s voice speaking up from behind him startled the young wizard.</p>
<p>“They would be proud of you, you know,” came his godfather’s quiet voice. Usually much more chipper, today, his tone was solemn. “Your parents were among a few of the bravest people I’ve ever had the fortune to know. I was proud to call them my friends.”</p>
<p>Harry Potter stood behind Teddy, his hands buried in the pockets of his black coat, the slight breeze tousling his thick tuft of wild black hair, his glasses slightly askew, thanks to the wind, but he paid it no mind. He had eyes only for his godson. “Have a seat,” he instructed, gruffly, but not unkindly, as he waved his wand, casting a furtive glance around, making sure no one was watching, and conjured a wooden bench out of thin air, right next to their graves.</p>
<p>The bench had been exposed to the elements for many seasons, likely it was older than Teddy was. It had come to resemble driftwood, the bright tones of its once fresh state had become a somber brown, but beautiful. He ran his fingers over the swirls in the wood grain, being so close to the Thames it was likely just as infused with salt from onshore breezes and the wintry gales that even made the air taste of brine. Teddy turned to sit, feeling the slight give in the wood, any creak being lost beneath the sound of the waves on the pebbled beach if faced. He sat, not with the impatience of one waiting for a bus, but with the feeling of one savoring the moment. He felt the wind tousle his short hair, cool, refreshing and let his eyes fall on the Thames, the horizon.</p>
<p>Teddy wondered how many had sat in this very spot and what their emotions were, perhaps some were newlyweds in love, some confused teenagers searching for meaning, some the old folk come to remember a loved one who had since passed. He was none of those things, neither at the beginning of his young life or nearing the end, but old enough to cherish moments instead of wishing them away.</p>
<p>“Tell me about them,” Teddy urged desperately. “Please, Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed, not looking at Teddy at first, running a hand through his dark hair in a vain attempt to smooth his locks, to no avail. Fighting the wind was a losing battle, even with the use of magic.</p>
<p>His godfather said nothing at first, pulling a worn photograph out of his coat pocket, wordlessly passing it along to Teddy. “Here. Take it. It’s one of a few pictures I have of them left. You keep it. You ought to be able to remember your parents as your father and mother. Me, I’m able to remember them as my friends,” he said.</p>
<p>Teddy fell silent and glanced down at the photograph. It depicted his father and mother smiling at the camera before in a moment of mischief, his father’s face lit up with a playful grin, making him look years younger than he actually was, and twirled his mother once, and her smile of pure delight tugged at Teddy’s heartstrings as he watched. He rummaged through his other coat pocket and pulled out the second letter, this one much longer and several pages long.</p>
<p><em>Their life story</em>, Teddy thought wildly, flipping through the pages to pick back up where he’d left of. He wanted to choose the most perfect memories his parents had of one another and cling to it, because in these moments, just like in the few photographs he had of his parents, his mother and father were the people that they should have been all along, had it not been for the stresses of war and death.</p>
<p>In these letters and photographs, their personalities were so golden and sacred, Teddy wanted to keep it that way forever. Like one of those old Muggle movie reels he could play it will, he unfolded the first letter his parents had written to Teddy, detailing how they met.</p>
