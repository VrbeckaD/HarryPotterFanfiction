    <p>"Lucius. You said it was urgent."</p>
    <p>"It is, My Lord. Quite urgent." Lucius Malfoy seemed rather anxious as he sat in the chair opposite Voldemort. A frigid rain pattered outside the office window. Lucius dragged his tongue over his bottom lip and said, "She is with Narcissa now, getting cleaned up and dressed and fed."</p>
    <p>"Bellatrix," Voldemort clarified, and Lucius nodded.</p>
    <p>"She's gone mad, Master."</p>
    <p>Voldemort tipped his head. "Fourteen years in Azkaban is likely to do that to someone."</p>
    <p>"My Lord, it's… she thinks it's 1970," Lucius said, and Voldemort scowled.</p>
    <p>"A pity, for a mind like hers to go."</p>
    <p>"The only thing, My Lord, is that she looks… she looks… <em>young</em>," Lucius pronounced carefully. Voldemort cleared his throat a little, shaking his head, but Lucius continued, "She claims she fell asleep in her bed at the Black family residence in August of 1970, and that she woke up in Azkaban ten days before the breakout. She says she screamed and cried out once she realised she was in prison. Then the Dementors came and broke her out. We explained as much as we could to her. We explained the way you… disappeared. The way she'd gone to prison for so long. We even tried to explain your new… appearance. She was incredibly confused by it all. She kept insisting I was my father. She seemed terrified. But she looks young, younger than I remember her being even when she went off to Azkaban."</p>
    <p>"Interesting." Voldemort drummed his clawed fingernails along the edge of his desk. "Bring her to me."</p>
    <p>"Yes, My Lord. I think she's just upstairs getting some fresh clothes. I'll bring her down."</p>
    <p>Lucius bowed when he stood, and Nagini slithered up to Voldemort. Once Lucius had gone, Nagini hissed in Parseltongue,</p>
    <p>"<em>You have missed her, Master.</em>"</p>
    <p>"<em>It has been too long. I couldn't miss her anymore,</em>" Voldemort insisted back. The snake looked as sceptical as snakes could do, and she slithered over to rest beneath a bookshelf. Voldemort sighed, running his fingernails over his bald head. She would be horrified by him, time travel or not. Thanks to snake venom, his nose was now just a set of slits in his face. He could smell very well, as it happened, but the look was disgusting. Not that he minded; in fact, he quite liked that everyone else was terrified of his new appearance. He hadn't been very handsome before the incident with the infant Harry Potter, anyway. Making so many Horcruxes had warped and melted his features.</p>
    <p>But Bellatrix had never cared.</p>
    <p>"Enter," he said at the sound of three knocks on his door. His voice shook far more than he would have liked. The door opened, and then Voldemort's jaw dropped.</p>
    <p>It was her. <em>Her, </em>Bellatrix, only she looked like she'd just left Hogwarts. Her face was almost childlike in its youth. Her eyes were bright and glittering with life. Her hair was jet black, her curls shining. She was thin and gangly, almost untouched by womanhood. His breath caught. This was not a witch who had spent fourteen years in Azkaban.</p>
    <p>"Bellatrix," he said softly, and he watched her blink in shock.</p>
    <p>"M-My Lord." She dipped her head and raised just her eyes to study him.</p>
    <p>"Horrific, isn't it?" He glanced down at himself, but Bellatrix shook her head as she came into the office.</p>
    <p>"No. If what they say is true, and you were gone for so long, then I am only glad you are safe."</p>
    <p>He smirked and gestured for her to sit.</p>
    <p>"You pretend not to know what happened, but I refuse to believe you've gone mad. There's one way to find out. Let me in your mind. <em>Legilimens.</em>"</p>
    <p>She gasped as he thrust himself into her head. He searched through her memories, trying to find faint glimmers of what had come to pass between them from 1970 until she married in 1976. Nothing. He searched for memories of her trial, of her imprisonment. Nothing. Everything stopped at the end of the summer after she'd left Hogwarts. She'd been working for Voldemort since her sixth year in school, and over that summer, she'd become his full-time and closely associated soldier. But she remembered nothing past a hot night in August when she'd gone to bed, and then she'd awakened in a cell in Azkaban.</p>
    <p>"So it is as you say," Voldemort whispered, "and you have come decades into the future through your sleep. How can this be?"</p>
    <p>"I have no idea, My Lord," Bellatrix admitted. "When I saw Lucius, I didn't recognise him. Neither him nor Cissy. Then they told me about you. I figured it out quickly; I knew I'd come through time. But I had no Time Turner, nor any spell or potion or device… I don't know how it happened. I don't know… oh. Hello."</p>
    <p>Nagini had slithered up to Bellatrix and was curling up her chair. The snake held her face out toward Bellatrix, hovering and studying.</p>
    <p>"<em>Leave her be,</em>" Voldemort hissed in Parseltongue, but Bellatrix dragged a knuckle almost affectionately over the top of Nagini's head and murmured,</p>
    <p>"Pretty creature. Hmmm."</p>
    <p>"<em>She is lovely and kind and I enjoy her</em>," Nagini hissed at Voldemort. Bellatrix smiled just a little and kept petting Nagini's head, and she noted,</p>
    <p>"You had such an affinity for snakes, My Lord, in my time. What is she called?"</p>
    <p>How Bellatrix knew it was a <em>she</em>, Voldemort did not care to know. He cleared his throat a little and said,</p>
    <p>"She's called Nagini. She quite likes you."</p>
    <p>"She's marvelous." Bellatrix trailed her knuckles down Nagini's scales, and Voldemort's chest tightened oddly.</p>
    <p>"<em>Go,</em>" he commanded Nagini, and the snake hesitantly slithered away from Bellatrix. She watched the snake go, and then she turned her attention back to Voldemort.</p>
    <p>"My Lord. I don't know what happened to the me that spent years in Azkaban. I don't care. All that matters is that I am here to serve you now, in this new war."</p>
    <p>Voldemort dug his grey teeth into his bottom lip and decided she needed to know a little more truth.</p>
    <p>"You don't know what happened between… erm… between you and me," he noted, and when Bellatrix seemed shocked, he clarified, "The night of your nineteenth birthday… we'd both had entirely too much to drink, and we… you know, we were together. It kept happening, with increasing frequency, until it become something of a proper affair. Only, I couldn't have you quite that close, so… I commanded you to marry Rodolphus Lestrange, which you did in 1976."</p>
    <p>"Oh. That's why everyone keeps mentioning Rodolphus." Bellatrix stared at her lap and blinked a few times. She kept her eyes down as she asked, "Did I love him?"</p>
    <p>"Does it matter?" Voldemort asked, and she shook her head. She was intelligent enough, even as an eighteen-year-old, to know why he would marry her off to cut off an affair. Even then, even as a warped middle-aged wizard, he'd been entirely too busy to be bothered with a young, clingy witch.</p>
    <p>"Rodolphus and Rabastan are tired, but they certainly haven't time traveled," Voldemort said. "They'll need a few weeks to recover before being put back into service as Death Eaters. Do you know, Bella… very nearly everybody turned on me when I disappeared. They started eating themselves alive, giving up one another's names. Fleeing. Denying. But you… <em>you.</em>"</p>
    <p>Bellatrix raised her gaze to him, and he could see that she was on the verge of tears. He shrugged a little and told her,</p>
    <p>"They dragged you kicking and screaming from the Wizengamot whilst you shrieked at them that I would rise again."</p>
    <p>"I would never, ever give up on the idea of you, Master," Bellatrix insisted, and again his chest hurt. He nodded.</p>
    <p>"I know." He cleared his throat and reminded the both of them, "You're meant to be forty-five years of age. I am very old now."</p>
    <p>"All that matters is that you get the power you deserve, My Lord," Bellatrix insisted, shoving her pretty curls away. "Perhaps I've been sent here so that I can better serve you. A forty-five-year-old me who's served fourteen years in Azkaban likely wouldn't be as much help as a younger me. Not as practised in battle, I wager, but I'll learn."</p>
    <p>"So eager," Voldemort whispered. "You have always, always been so very eager. For everything I would give you. Any scrap of attention brought you bliss. Any touch, any kiss made you…"</p>
    <p>He stopped then, but Bellatrix's eyes had gone wide. She didn't remember any touches or kisses. She barely remembered any battle. She had not yet lived the times they'd been physical together, nor the times she'd killed and tortured for him. She was little more than a girl, this Bellatrix who had come to him through the years.</p>
    <p>"Do my scarlet eyes frighten you?" he asked abruptly. When Bellatrix shook her head, he scoffed and said, "I suppose I was hardly good-looking even when you knew me. Wrinkled and bent by Dark magic. But this… I am much taller, and much older, and more snake-like. Are you repulsed?"</p>
    <p>"Quite the opposite, My Lord," Bellatrix said softly. He took a long breath through the slits of his nostrils and murmured,</p>
    <p>"You may stay here at Malfoy Manor, in the suite of rooms I keep, until further notice. Until we've got some of this mystery sorted out. I'm sure you're not anxious to jump into bed with Rodolphus Lestrange."</p>
    <p>"Not exactly, My Lord," she whispered, looking grateful. Voldemort nodded and said lightheartedly,</p>
    <p>"Well, I shall do my best to keep Nagini out of your room, though it seems she's extraordinarily fond of you."</p>
    <p>Bellatrix looked over her shoulder and smiled at the snake that held a scrap of Voldemort's soul. Bellatrix seemed drawn to Nagini, far more than any of the others were. Well, that made sense, Voldemort thought. The others had given up on him when Bellatrix had cried and screamed that her master would return. Of course she would be more magnetically attracted to his Horcrux than they all were.</p>
    <p>"Have you any notion at all of how or why I've come here, My Lord?" Bellatrix asked suddenly, and Voldemort snapped to rights. He shook his head.</p>
    <p>"Not yet. I'll have to do some research. Though, in my experience, meddling with time is a terribly unwise act. I'm not about to try and send you back. You're here. You're free. You'll fight for me in this time."</p>
    <p>"I will always fight for you, Master," Bellatrix insisted, "no matter what year it is."</p>
    <p>"So young," he whispered. He rose and walked around the desk, knowing his movements were unnaturally fluid. He wondered how Bellatrix would react to him touching her with his talon-like fingers. She didn't flinch even a little bit when he brushed her curls away from her face and said softly, "You look so very young."</p>
    <p>"I turn nineteen next month," she reminded him, but he smirked and informed her,</p>
    <p>"It's January. Things are more than a little thrown off, it would seem. Come on upstairs, Bella, and I'll show you your room. You must be very tired."</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Bellatrix rifled through the trunk that Narcissa had sent up. It was strange to think of Cissy as an adult, married to Lucius, with a son to boot. Draco was a teenager now, but Bellatrix had never even known him. Narcissa had still been at Hogwarts when she'd fallen asleep. Cissy would come home on holidays raving about how in love she was with Lucius Malfoy, but Bellatrix would always roll her eyes a bit. Now she could see that the two of them had stayed in love and married, that they'd had a child together. It was almost too much for Bellatrix's mind to contemplate.</p>
    <p>She pulled on a plain white nightgown and stared at herself in the full-length mirror, trying to imagine what fourteen years in Azkaban would have felt like. She tried to imagine herself at forty-five years of age, but she couldn't. She couldn't shift and warp her features the way age had done to Narcissa and Lucius and the others.</p>
    <p>She was married to Rodolphus Lestrange. Apparently, she'd been married to him for twenty years. That in itself was a shock almost beyond measure. She'd hardly known Rodolphus, though perhaps that had been rather the point. It sounded like Lord Voldemort had set her up in a politically-minded marriage.</p>
    <p>She'd missed so much. An entire war, the fall of her master, the way the others had forsaken him. She'd gone on trial with Rodolphus and Rabastan. She'd been shut in a cell for more than a decade. She'd missed it all and more. Perhaps that wasn't such a bad thing, Bellatrix thought. At least now, in this very time to which she'd come, Voldemort was alive and resurrected after taking a rebounded Killing Curse. Whether he looked snakelike or grey-skinned or red-eyed was of no consequence to Bellatrix. She was just glad he had made it through that trauma.</p>
    <p>"Hello, Nagini." She saw the snake in the reflection of the mirror, wending up toward her and then raising her serpentine head. Bellatrix crouched down and studied the snake's eyes, her searching tongue, and she whispered,</p>
    <p>"My, but you are pretty, aren't you?"</p>
    <p>She felt drawn to the snake for a reason she couldn't quite identify. She pet its head and stared at it for a long moment, and then she heard a voice from behind her.</p>
    <p>"<em>Sssayonath abathosss…</em>"</p>
    <p>Nagini mournfully slithered away, out of the grey and white bedroom. Bellatrix stood and insisted,</p>
    <p>"She wasn't bothering me, My Lord. Honest."</p>
    <p>He smirked a little and came into the room. He gestured toward the two armchairs before Bellatrix's crackling fireplace, and he moved smoothly as he sat. He moved like a wraith now, Bellatrix thought. Any human gangliness was long gone. He moved like a spectre in the night, like he was underwater. When she sat opposite him, he seemed to be studying her form. She was embarrassed for a moment, until he finally said,</p>
    <p>"I'd almost forgotten you. Spending so much time without a body… then finding out you were in Azkaban… I forgot your voice. I did. I nearly forgot your face. But the face I left was thirty years old, not this, this… you're very young again."</p>
    <p>"Still," she corrected gently. He frowned, which was a bit odd since he was lacking in eyebrows, but Bellatrix told him, "I am <em>still</em> young, Master. I fell asleep young, and I woke up in Azkaban. I never lived all those years between. I'm not forty-five."</p>
    <p>"Hmm." Voldemort raked his pointed fingernails along the chair arm and mused, "I'd hurt you with these, I think."</p>
    <p>For a long moment, Bellatrix didn't know what he meant. Was he threatening her? Then she remembered that they'd had an affair, and she realised that he meant he would hurt her between her legs if he touched her with the talon-like nails. She gasped a little and squirmed where she sat.</p>
    <p>"It has been more than twenty years since I touched you," he said simply, and Bellatrix stared right at his pale grey, noseless face and replied,</p>
    <p>"For me, My Lord, it's <em>never</em>. You've never touched me."</p>
    <p>He kept staring into the flames, and the fireplace cast an odd colour on his pallid cheek. He said thoughtfully,</p>
    <p>"You used to quite like it when I…"</p>
    <p>He trailed off then, his breath audible through the odd slits on his face. He shut his scarlet eyes and shook his head.</p>
    <p>"Nevermind. Get some rest, Bella."</p>
    <p>"What did I like?" Bellatrix was pushing him, she knew, and when he opened his eyes and glared at her, he said in a sibilant murmur,</p>
    <p>"Don't toy with me, little girl."</p>
    <p>"I didn't mean to," Bellatrix said honestly. "There's so much I can't remember because I haven't lived it yet. You said that you and I were close."</p>
    <p>He scoffed and dragged a sharp nail over his bottom lip. "That is an understatement."</p>
    <p>Bellatrix wished suddenly that she were a Legilimens just like him. She shrugged and asked,</p>
    <p>"Did we… were we dating?"</p>
    <p>"Dating?" he repeated, choking out a little laugh. He shook his head and looked almost like he pitied her as he said, "No. We were not <em>dating</em>. We were <em>fucking</em>, rather regularly. Exclusively, as far as I could tell. Monogamously. But, no, Bella. I never took you to dinner."</p>
    <p>"And then I married Rodolphus," Bellatrix nodded. She gulped and asked tentatively, "Did I have children with him?"</p>
    <p>Voldemort curled up half his mouth and said bitterly, "I would not have allowed that. I needed you both in active service. We had a war to win. And, anyway, just because I'd cut things off with you didn't mean I was ready to hand you over into the loving embrace of another wizard. So far as I knew, your marriage was astonishingly platonic."</p>
    <p>"Oh. I see." Bellatrix watched as Nagini slithered back into the room, climbing up onto Bellatrix's chair. She dropped her head down from the top of the chair, and Bellatrix dragged her knuckle back between the snake's eyes. She smiled a little at Voldemort and noted, "Nagini does like me, doesn't she?"</p>
    <p>"Yes." Voldemort took a shaking breath and hissed quietly at the snake, "<em>Hyasssosssamith abathosss</em>."</p>
    <p>Nagini seemed to hesitate for a moment, but then finally left, moving in a waving pattern on the wooden floor as she left the bedroom again and went out into the other parts of the suite. Voldemort watched her leave, and he seemed to be thinking hard about something.</p>
    <p>"Master?" Bellatrix asked, and he snapped his pale face back to her. She fiddled with her hands in her lap and said, "You sat down and started to tell me about something I used to like. Something you'd do that I used to like. Will you please tell me what it was?"</p>
    <p>His red eyes darkened for a moment, and his chapped lips parted as he seemed to consider whether or not to speak. Finally he shrugged and admitted,</p>
    <p>"It's been twenty years. I could very well be remembering it wrong."</p>
    <p>"Remembering what?" Bellatrix whispered. She was pushing him so hard, she knew, but she wanted answers. She wanted memories and truth. Finally he beckoned her toward him with one long, spindly finger. She rose and stood between his parted legs, realising that he was taller like this. She remember his face, scarred and bent, from the life she'd left behind. She remembered his body, lean and tall, but not this tall.</p>
    <p>"Your hair," Voldemort said meaninfully. Bellatrix was self-conscious then as she gathered her curls over one shoulder and asked,</p>
    <p>"What about it, Master?"</p>
    <p>"You liked… when I used to touch your hair," he said. "When I would play with it a little. You always liked that. Sometimes I'd be talking to you, playing with your hair, and you'd have fallen asleep. It soothed you after battles, I think."</p>
    <p>Suddenly Bellatrix's eyes seared like fire. They had been as close as that, that he had been lying beside her after a battle? She felt a tear worm its way from her eye, and she swiped quickly at it. Voldemort reached up and tentatively laced his fingers through her curls. She felt his skin, cool but still warm enough to feel alive. His fingers clenched a little, his nails scratching a bit at her scalp. His face shifted; he looked afraid all of a sudden.</p>
    <p>Bellatrix was afraid, too, because she wanted nothing more right now than to kiss him, this monster he'd become.</p>
    <p>"Why did I travel here?" she asked again, and once more he admitted,</p>
    <p>"I don't know."</p>
    <p>"You're right." Bellatrix tipped her head back a little and sighed as Voldemort toyed a bit with her curls. "I do like it."</p>
    <p>"Bella." He sounded disbelieving then. He put his right hand to the small of her back and pulled at her, urging her down. She was straddling his lap in the chair before she knew what was happening. His hands both settled on her shoulders, and he said coolly,</p>
    <p>"I used to like this. Having you on me like this."</p>
    <p>"Oh." Bellatrix felt a lump beneath her, and when she moved, he hissed through his grey teeth.</p>
    <p>"Yes, I have one, and yes, it works," Voldemort said with a smirk. Bellatrix felt her cheeks go hot.</p>
    <p>"I wasn't…" She wanted to tell him that she hadn't been thinking about his anatomy, but of course the question had crossed her mind.</p>
    <p>"You should get some rest," Voldemort said, flicking his face back to stare at the fire. He felt distant and cold all of a sudden. He nodded and insisted, "You've had a difficult journey through time and space; you've spent a little time in a prison cell. You're confused. You should get some rest."</p>
    <p>"Will you play with my hair whilst I fall asleep, My Lord?" Bellatrix dared to ask, but Voldemort stared at her with his terrifying, unreadable red eyes, and he shook his head slowly. He pushed on her shoulders and she rose, feeling overwhelmed by him. He cleared his throat, standing and holding his hands in front of the place where his erection had formed.</p>
    <p>"Goodnight, Bella," he said, staring down at her. She nodded up at him, entranced all of a sudden. She shouldn't find him attractive, not like this, but she murmured,</p>
    <p>"Goodnight, Master."</p>
    <p>He reached out then and held her cheek in his hand, keeping his sharp nails away from her. He lowered his face down until she could hear the rattle of his breath. He was so close, and she realised he meant to kiss her. She tried to ready herself, but then he paused, hovering with their lips almost in contact.</p>
    <p>And then he pulled away.</p>
    <p>"Goodnight, Bella," he said again, turning and stalking away so quickly that his robes billowed out around him. He yanked the bedroom door shut behind him, leaving Bellatrix alone in a time that was foreign to her, feeling so alive she could hardly think.</p>
