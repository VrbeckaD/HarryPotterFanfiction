    <p>Harry is thirty when the letter arrives. It feels oddly similar to when he received his Hogwarts letter. A static feeling of (not hope this time) but <em>nerves</em><span> and a tingling in the air that he now knows was his magic trying to tell him something. He doesn’t have the sight, most wixen don’t have anything close to it, but his magic has been close to death too many times too count. Aware and wary enough to tell Harry when something is </span><em>important</em><span>.</span></p><p>
  <span> This letter, </span>
  <span>is</span>
  <span> mu</span>
  <span>ndane</span>
  <span> when Harry takes a better look at it, makes his magic thrum with potential. He casts an owl-safe cutting spell to un-tether it from the owl and summons Pigwidgeon’s food and water. Another stabilizing spell on his work space and the two potions he’s been working on for four months (testing, testing, and finalizing two new potion recipes he’s made on his own) before levitating the letter and walking towards the dueling room. Normally he would stay in the potions lab because the wards on the lab are just as strong (if not stronger) than the ones in the dueling room, but he’s not chancing a spell on his letter interacting with his potions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the way up to the dueling room, he pulls out a mirror that is almost the size of a </span>
  <em>cellphone,</em>
  <span> if a little larger</span>
  <em>. </em>
  <span>Like one it picks up his voice and calls “</span>
  <em>Hermione, and Ron” </em>
  <span>when he says their names, and a moment later it starts vibrating in his hand. (explaining what a cellphone was to Ron had been the ultimate test in patience for both Hermione and Harry)</span>
</p><p>Two faces appear splitting the mirror awkwardly but it’s better then their previous iterations of the Mirror-phone, at least this one isn’t the size of a bathroom mirror.</p><p>“Harry,” Hermione smiles at him and brushes a streak of singed-black hair away from her face. Her dark skin glistens with sweat and Harry raises a brow, and she flushes a little, “A new fire dampening spell I’m working on, it...has it’s moments.” She admits ruthfully.</p><p>“Don’t destroy another shop, ‘Mione.” Ron says from the otherside of the mirror. He smiles teasingly, and then looks at Harry. “What did you call about mate? Not that I don’t miss you both but I’m on a tight schedule.”</p><p>
  <span> “Still searching for that wixen you’re assassinating?” Hermione says, it’s not as sharp as it used to be. When Ron had first taken the </span>
  <em>Hit Wizard</em>
  <span> position their house hadn’t had a single peaceful day for a week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Harry sighs because he’s not up to an argument. Especially when he knows Hermione’s just biting at the bit because of how difficult her current spell is being; she </span>
  <em>always</em>
  <span> starts snapping at one of them when work becomes stressful. “I got a letter.” He cuts in before Ron can finish opening his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instantly both of them are focused. It sends a warm fondness through Harry, even if the reason for their attentiveness is partially remembering when Luna had accepted a letter five years back </span>
  <span>and been port-keyed into a trap</span>
  <span>, but some of it is because they </span>
  <em>care</em>
  <span>. Not that Harry has doubted that in the past ten years but it had taken quite a long time to realize that Hermione and Ron cared so much—right around the time Hermione and Ron had moved into his house actually.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “</span>
  <span>Did you see what it is already?” Hermione asks, “You have a shield on you right?”</span>
</p><p>Harry shakes his head, “No to both questions. I’m about to open it though.” He’s already reached the dueling room; a long stretch of a room with nothing except the walls, floor, and roof. If he concentrates he can see the glimmer of the wards at the corner of his eyes so bright it’s almost painful with the amount of protective magic they put into it.</p><p>
  <span> “</span>
  <span>Shield first mate,” Ron says pointedly. His nose still has a scar where it was almost sliced in half a few years ago when he hadn’t used a shield. He rubs it now and grimaces.</span>
</p><p>“Alright, alright.” Harry says and spins a magical and physical shield around him. It takes a little longer this way without an incantation but it’s more durable and he’s able to make it wrap around him like a sweater or robe. Once his entire body is covered in the shield he sticks the mirror-phone onto the wall with a sticking charm, and then raises the letter level so they can all see it.</p><p>
  <span> Humming thoughtfully, Hermione says, “I doubt it’s a Death Eater letter. Even if some of them might be cunning enough to use </span>
  <span>mundane</span>
  <span> means, our esteemed </span>
  <em>assassin</em>
  <span>,” Her eyes narrow at Ron before returning focus on the letter, “has killed a majority of them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron sniffs audibly, “You’re </span>
  <em>welcome</em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “We know you did it to clear the riff-raff.” Harry soothes. He casts a few detection spells (and then five more that Ron, “Learned this one in Hungary last month”, and Hermione, “Oh this one a</span>
  <span>n acquaintance</span>
  <span> taught me last week” teach him on the spot) makes a slicing motion with his wand on the top and bottom of the </span>
  <span>envelope,</span>
  <span> and unfolds the letter in another spell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> All three exhale when nothing happens. Harry cycles through the spells again on the letter. Gingerly, he touches it with a finger and another breath leaves the trio at the lack of reaction. “I think it’s fine.” He twists his magic in a way that Ron had taught them after his Hit Wizard courses, and connects a ring of magic onto his pinky and then to his wand handle letting it swing in the air at the ready if he needs it. He picks up the letter and examines it. </span>
  <em>Dear Mr. Potter</em>
</p><p>“Read it aloud.” Hermione huffs.</p><p>
  <span> Harry chuckles </span>
  <span>and clears his throat, “</span>
  <em>Dear Mr. Potter</em>
  <span>, </span>
  <em>We are sorry...”</em>
  <span> He frowns as his eyes skip ahead </span>
  <em>death of</em>
  <span> and </span>
  <em>last family member to</em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>“Sorry?” Ron asks warily.</p><p>
  <span> “</span>
  <em>We are sorry to send you the </em>
  <em>grim tidings of the death of</em>
  <em> your </em>
  <em>First C</em>
  <em>ousins Janet Drake and J</em>
  <em>ack Drake </em>
  <em>who passed two months ago</em>
  <em>. As to their wills, all of Drake Industries goes to Timothy Drake, their son. Unfortunately their family has dwindled to a point where only their Cousins remain. As the sole adult, </em>
  <em>and last family member</em>
  <em> related to Timothy Drake, you are allowed a certain portion of the inheritance if you care for their child.”</em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Seriously?” Hermione scowls.</span>
</p><p>“Paying you to take care of their kid, that’s bloody disgusting.” Ron agrees.</p><p>
  <span> Harry nods absently. Throat tightening, and chest feeling oddly non-existent, like someone just scooped out his organs and left his ribs. He has a cousin, a cousin he didn’t even know about, and—he skims the rest of the letter, “Timothy lives in the states.” That voice </span>
  <em>can’t</em>
  <span> be his, but he’s the only one who spoke and it sounds rough and squeaky.</span>
</p><p>“Hey, breathe, mate, just relax. We defeated a Dark Lord, we can handle a kid.” Ron soothes, hands raised as if he wants to hold Harry.</p><p>
  <span> “Ron’s right,” Hermione agrees quickly, “You became a Potion’s Master’s to shit on Snape,” She must be trying </span>
  <em>really</em>
  <span> hard to calm him if she’s making light of the dead man and cursing, “and became the youngest Potion’s Masters in Britain even before him, and then made two new potions before he ever made his first.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Cracking a small smile, Harry feels his muscles relax and suddenly he can breathe again. He </span>
  <em>had</em>
  <span> done all of that (catching up and superseding Snape had been </span>
  <em>difficult</em>
  <span>, and he had used more than the recommended doses of Pepper Up and Awakening Potions then strictly healthy to study until his eyes hurt and his hands shook) and it still left him feeling spitefully pleased that he had beaten another of his bully’s. “</span>
  <span>You’re right.” Harry agrees and scans the letter again, “I guess I’m going to Gotham.”</span>
</p><p>“Right after you, mate.” Ron quickly says, a relieved smile on his face.</p><p>“No you’re not. You know how those contracts get if you don’t kill your target.” Hermione quickly disagrees. “I can--”</p><p>“You will stab someone if you don’t have your notes or a lab space.” Ron snaps back.</p><p>
  <span> “I’ll keep the mirror on me. Both of you will finish your work while I prepare a house if this is real. I have the emergency portkey and the runic protection Bill did for us.” Harry interrupts them and his eyes glimmer with amusement at their sheepish expressions. He grips his wand in his right hand and unsticks the mirror with a twirl of his wand. He picks it up with the fingers not holding the letter and starts walking </span>
  <span>out of the dueling room</span>
  <span>. “I’ll be in and out before either of you are done if it is a trap.”</span>
</p><p>“Alright, if you’re sure, Har.” Ron says.</p><p>“Just be careful, don’t waste your magic. You know those runes on us are only useful if your core isn’t completely empty after their charge runs out.” Hermione says and then a blast of hot hair sends her hair covering the mirror. She sighs and pulls it away from her face and once again appears on the mirror’s screen, “I forgot I cast the spell before you called, I have to go fix the wards.” She grimaces.</p><p>“It’s fine, ‘Mione. I’ll call before I take the international portkey.” Harry reassures her, slipping down the hall and up the stairs to his room—well, their room, some days they sleep in Harry’s room, other days they split into eachother’s rooms, and other days they switch beds so often it’s more like three individual bedrooms that they hop between.</p><p>“Gotham doesn’t have a wizarding community.” Ron says just as Hermione signs off. He shrugs at Harry’s grimace, “I know mate, had a job there once, weird place, not a single magical there. I mean there’s that villian, you know?”</p><p>
  <span> Harry raises a brow, because he does not know. There’s of course the superheroes he’s heard of in the news like Wonder Woman and Superman, but he rarely pays attention unless it has to deal with magic. It’s not like </span>
  <span>a majority of the magical communities across the world have joined the superhero-movement. He knows that the hit-wizards like Ron do, </span>
  <span>non-kill,</span>
  <span> contract work for the Justice League but what </span>
  <em>they</em>
  <span> know isn’t the same as what the mundanes know. </span>
  <span>Even hea</span>
  <span>ring about</span>
  <span> Ron moan about Metas and their abilities and how much magic it took to catch a Villian once, and how many bruises he received in the fight </span>
  <em>through</em>
  <span> Dragon Hide, </span>
  <span>still leaves Harry with a distant feeling to the whole thing</span>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “</span>
  <span>Poison Ivy.” Ron huffs as if affronted that Harry doesn’t pay more attention to Gotham’s villians, “She has that weird plant ability. People thought she was a wixen for a while. My job was to see if her ability was a </span>
  <em>Natural Gift</em>
  <span>, like parseltongue, a bloodline.” He adds and then sighs, “</span>
  <span>All I got for that was</span>
  <span> pollen </span>
  <span>in my face</span>
  <span> and wanted to...” he flushes and coughs delicately in a way that implies </span>
  <em>sexual things</em>
  <span>, “for a week, but she </span>
  <span>doesn’t fall under Wixen magic</span>
  <span>, thank Merlin.”</span>
</p><p><span> “Right.” Harry wonders if he can just take Timothy out of Gotham, but if he really does have an inheritance and a company on top of that he doubts he can just take the boy away. Especially if, he glances at the letter, </span><em>Drake Industries</em> <span>main office is in</span><span> Gotham. “Well, I’ll make sure to avoid the Villians.” He winces, saying that feels like reading one of Dudley’s awful comic books (Before Petunia had found them and thrown them away). Sure Superheroes have been around for years even when Harry was young but...it’s one thing to hear about them and another to have to go into a city with capital V Villians.</span></p><p>
  <span> “</span>
  <span>Luck Mate, have to go, just saw my target.” With a complex tap of his wand </span>
  <span>on his head</span>
  <span>, Ron glimmers out of existence, </span>
  <span>a more proficient form of the </span>
  <em>disillusionment</em>
  <span> charm,</span>
  <span> before the mirror turns off.</span>
