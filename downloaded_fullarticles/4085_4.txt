    <p>Dear Mr. Potter,<br/>It has come to my attention that you intend to testify at my son’s trial on his behalf. I appreciate that greatly. I would like to thank you in person. There is also another matter which we need to discuss in relation to the events in the woods at the final battle. While you are welcome to come here to the Manor I imagine you are quite unwilling to do so, therefore please name a place and time and I will meet you there.<br/>Narcissa Malfoy</p>
<p>“Life debt,” Hermione said when Harry read the letter to her and Ron.</p>
<p>“What?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“She lied to Voldemort and said you were dead which saved your life so you owe her a life debt and she’s going to call it in,” replied Ron.</p>
<p>“What does she expect me to do?”</p>
<p>“How a life debt is repaid is all up to the two people involved. The debtor can make suggestions but the debtee makes the final decision. In this case you can come up with a few ideas and hope she approves one or you can wait and see what she asks you to do,” Hermione answered.</p>
<p>Harry looked worried, “Can she force me to do what she wants me to do?”</p>
<p>“Life debts aren’t a legal obligation more of a moral, traditional obligation so it’s not like she can go to the Ministry or a solicitor and have you sued or arrested, but even with Lucius and Draco in Azkaban until trial the Malfoys are still a Pureblood family with many connections.She could use those connections to make life harder for you.”</p>
<p>Ron piped in, “Maybe she’ll count your testifying for that spawn of hers as repayment.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that, but suppose I have to find out,” Harry groaned, “But where to meet with her?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere in public,” Ron suggested, “You know so she can’t try anything.”</p>
<p>“Ronald,” Hermione shook her head, “She’s going to want Harry to testify for Draco, why would she do anything to him?”</p>
<p>“Whatever, I still say somewhere in public is the best idea mate.”</p>
<p>“Well she’s right that I don’t want to get near the Manor. She would have to force me to get me to go anywhere near that place ever again!”</p>
<p>Hermione thought for a moment, “You could meet her somewhere in public though if you do it should be somewhere that you can still have some quiet and privacy but I think you can trust her enough to meet away from prying eyes and ears and I think I know the perfect place.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“Grimmauld Place,” she announced.</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s yours now, and you’re comfortable there but it also happens to be the home of a family member of hers. She’s most likely been there at some point in her life so she would also be comfortable. If she’s more relaxed she’s more likely to listen to any suggestions you might make on resolving the life debt.”</p>
<p>“Ok that makes sense but I still need some ideas on what to do to pay it off?” Harry said.</p>
<p>“I say you tell her you’re testifying covers it. It will save her son’s life that should be repayment enough,” Ron insisted.</p>
<p>“It could but I was going to do that anyway so I imagine she’d want something else.”</p>
<p>“She’ll probably ask you to testify for that lying heap of crap of a husband of hers. I hear he’s trying to go with the Imperius Curse defense again,” Ron scoffed.</p>
<p>“That would be one thing I just won’t do!” Harry insisted.</p>
<p>“I know you said you don’t want to go near the Manor again Harry but maybe you could offer to help her fix it up, you know it had to be damaged in the time that Voldemort was there. You could probably get it done before Draco or Lucius are released,” Hermione suggested.</p>
<p>“If they get released,” Ron chimed in.</p>
<p>“Well Lucius probably won’t, not this time. He’s going to have to serve some time in Azkaban. It was one thing when he got out of it last time claiming to be Imperiused but I don’t think the Wizengamot is going to fall for that again even if he tries it.”</p>
<p>“He’ll just pay people off, bribe anyone he can, and name as many names as he can to save his own arse.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, “Yes Ron he probably will try to do just that but there’s nothing we can do about that and no reason to worry about it, in the meantime we can help Harry. Maybe something that will keep her from requesting he be at her beck and call for the rest of his life.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes widened in horror, “Can she do that?”</p>
<p>Hermione shrugged, “She could. It is a standard repayment of the debt, the debtor becomes a servant of the debtee until such time as they determine that debt has been repaid or until the debtor saves the life of the debtee thereby canceling out the debt.”</p>
<p>“In plain English please Mione,” whined Ron.</p>
<p>“You know exactly what that meant, I wish you’d stop playing stupid Ron.”</p>
<p>He grinned, “But you find it so cute. Admit it, you love it when I ask you to explain things. You love being the smart one in our relationship,” he snuggled up next to her on the couch, she pulled away at first then laughed and settled in next to him.</p>
<p>“All right, all right, yes I like being the smart one but that doesn’t mean you have to pretend to be dumber than you are.”</p>
<p>His face screwed up as he thought about that, “I think you just insulted me.”</p>
<p>“Better than hexing you though right?”</p>
<p>“I guess,” he said, “but this is even better.” With that he leaned over and began kissing her.</p>
<p>Harry just shook his head and looked away around the room, then out the window, finally casting a quick Tempus charm before addressing his friends, “Oi, are you going to help me out or snog all evening ‘cuz if you’re just going to snog I’m going home.”</p>
<p>Hermione pulled away, cheeks as red as her beau’s hair, “Sorry Harry.”</p>
<p>He laughed and shook his head, “No you’re not but it’s ok. It’s not like you two get to see each other as often as you’d like which is just going to be less here soon when school and training start.”</p>
<p>“Still,” she sat up, “You brought this to us because you wanted help, we should help. We can spend our time together after you leave.”</p>
<p>“She’s right, sorry mate.”</p>
<p>Harry waved his hand, “No you two should have some time for just the two of you and I keep butting in. I doubt we’re going to find anything to suggest that would be acceptable anyway.”</p>
<p>“Actually Harry there is one thing, if you’re willing,” Hermione suggested nervously.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Well, and I know you probably won’t like this and you don’t have to even bring it up with her unless it’s absolutely necessary but you could offer her Grimmauld Place.”</p>
<p>“Sirius left me the house,” he protested.</p>
<p>“But do you really want it mate?” Ron asked, “It’s not like we had the best of times there. Besides it’s so dreary and still filled with dust and dark magic artifacts I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“It would have belonged to Bellatrix or Narcissa if Sirius hadn’t left it to you they are the next of kin, even if he was disowned.”</p>
<p>“Sirius left it to me!”</p>
<p>“Then maybe you just offer her some of the heirlooms in the house, maybe the Black Family tapestry if she can find a way to get it off the wall.”</p>
<p>“That’s a possibility,” Harry relented.</p>
<p>“Wait, I just thought of something,” Ron nearly yelled, “you saved Draco in the Room of Requirement. So maybe she’d agree to cancel your life debt to her if you cancel his to you. If nothing else maybe it will at least make her more reasonable about what she wants you to do because you could just take it out on her precious son.”</p>
<p>“Ron!” Hermione squeaked, “That’s horrible, and practically genius.”</p>
<p>“Always the tone of surprise.”</p>
<p>“Oh but wait,” she said, “She could claim that Draco saved your life by not identifying you at the Manor which is pretty much what you’re going to say when you testify right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but what does that have to do with it?”</p>
<p>“Well if he saved your life then, you owed him a life debt which you repaid by saving him from the fiendfyre.”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, “I can still make the suggestion. It couldn’t hurt to remind her that he owes me. She might not even think of the Manor, but I think I’ll hold that in reserve, just until I see what she’s asking of me. I’m going to go home and send her a note with Batty.  I’ll see you all tomorrow.”</p>
