    <p>There was an angry pecking and hooting coming from the window. Remus woke up to look at the clock, it was just past three in the morning. <em>Who's sending us an Owl so damn early? Didn't we just fall asleep?</em> The werewolf woke up enough to realize why anyone was sending them a message in this early hour and jumped out of bed to let the owl in. The Great Horned Owl pecked hard on his head and bit a finger hard enough to draw blood before flying out in a huff.</p>

<p></p><div><p>Ripping the letter open, Remus saw James' hurried writing:</p><p> </p><p align="left">
        <em> <strong>"Lily Baby HELP"</strong> </em>
      </p><p> </p><p>Remus couldn't help but smile when he looked down at his still sleeping husband. They were about to be Godfathers. When their friends found out they were expecting, James had burst into their home telling Sirius he was going be a Godfather. Lily followed and explained they would both carry the title but James and Sirius' excitement were too much that they just sat back and watched the scene unfold.</p><p>Remus gently pulled the bed cover off Sirius and stroked the sleeping man's hair. Then he saw the dark bruises and bite marks of varying sizes on the man's neck, shoulders and hips. He didn't even remember leaving half of those. He took his wand and gently healed the bruises that would be visible with a shirt on. He wanted to heal all of them but knew Sirius liked seeing himself marked. Next, the cuffs around the sleeping man's wrists and ankles were gently removed. Then he carefully moved the sleeping man to pull out the butt plug. Sirius began to sense what was happening and started to become agitated. Remus soothingly stroked his hair again before leaning in to whisper into his ear.</p><p>"Sirius, wake up, love. You have to get up now."</p><p>Sirius groaned, raising his head to look out the window, and whined "It's still dark out." Then he collapsed back down to sleep while trying to pull the comforter over him.</p><p>"Lily's in labor. James wants us there."</p><p>It took several more moments before the words sank into the half asleep man. When it registered, Sirius was bolting out of bed screaming. <em>You'd think he was in James' place.</em> Remus thought with a chuckled before he began casting sanitizing spells everything they used the night before. Sirius had quickly thrown on some clothes during this time and took over putting everything away, allowing Remus to dress. Then they were running down to the fireplace, only stopping so Sirius could pack some of the cookies he baked the day before into a large bowl.</p><p>When they arrived in the Maternity waiting room, they quickly spotted James sitting between his father and father-in-law towards the back corner. They were the only group in the large waiting room at the moment. A Healer was in front of James, tending to his wounds. The soon father-to-be looked and smelled like he was thrown into a fire. Before Sirius or Remus could ask, they heard Lily yelling.</p><p>"Mom, give it back! I'll send the damn bastard back to Lucifer, then I'll Apparate this fucken parasite out!"</p><p>"Well, that answers that question," Remus said.</p><p>"Who's Lucifer?" Sirius asked at the same time. He then pushed the bowl in front of a shell-shocked James and asked, "Cookies?"</p><p>After Fleamont shook his head, Harold took the bowl and began to nervously nibbling on one, asking where they were bought. He nodded in approval when Sirius said he had baked them. Soon, Euphemia came up behind Sirius and Remus. She glared at their disheveled state and cast a cleaning charm on them before telling Harold Lily was asking for him. He nervously bolted up and ran into the delivery room with the cookies.</p><p>"Now, you boys might as well get yourselves comfortable. This could take another few hours."</p><p>"Hours?" James finally spoke up, looking like he was about to vomit. "HOURS?"</p><p>"Mr. Potter, stay still!" The mediwitch cast a few more spells. James started to return to his normal, although now a very paled color as opposed to his charred state. "Don't worry. We're well trained in handling women in labor and their unfortunate husbands. You're fine and you will survive the day. Now, fatherhood, that's another story." The Healer smiled and walked away.</p><p>The group spent the next few hours catching up. Peter finally arrived just past seven in the morning. By then, Sirius and Remus had curled up against each other and drifted off to sleep. James was pacing back and forth, muttering "I'm about to be a father." His parents slipped away to get everyone breakfast. When they came back, Peter poked his sleeping friends awake. They were about to eat (except James who was still nervously pacing and had declined) when a Midwife came out. She didn't get a chance to say a word when Lily was screaming for James. When hearing this, James let out a high pitched squeal and followed her back into the delivery room. About a half hour later, the Evans came out.</p><p>"You can go in. They just finished cleaning him up." Beverly told the Potters as she led her husband into a chair. "Hello, boys."</p><p>The three "Hello, Mrs. Evans," were drowned out by Harold bursting into tears. He had cried out a weepy "I'm a grandfather!" before Beverly drew him in for a tight hug, her eyes tearing up as well. Fleamont gave Harold a squeeze on the shoulder before following Euphemia into Lily's room. Twenty minutes later, they both came back out, smiling. Nearly an hour passed when James quietly walked out. He was carrying a small bundled blanket with a puff of black hair sticking out one end. Everyone crowded around to take a peek.</p><p>"Lily's finally asleep. I wanted you to meet Harry James Potter. Harry, these are your Godfathers Padfoot and Moony. And here's your Uncle Wormtail."</p><p>"Wow, how did you bring your baby photos to life?" Sirius whispered loudly.</p><p>There was a small round of laughter. Harry cooed and looked around at the smiling faces surrounding him.</p><p>"He has Lily's eyes," Peter squeaked.</p><p>"Yeah, too bad he doesn't have her hair. OW!" Sirius scoffed at his husband, rubbing the back of his head.</p><p>"Hey, Padfoot. Want to hold him?"</p><p>Sirius had no time to protest as the baby was gently transferred to his arms. In the process, one of the small arms had came loose. Harry gurgled as his arm jolted up. Soon, Harry had a firm grip on a wad of long hair and fell asleep like this. Tearing up, Sirius looked up to Remus, who was beginning to look weepy himself.</p><p>"Remus, look!"</p><p>Remus leaned in for a soft kiss. One of his hands came up to help cradle the baby while the other came up to caress the back of Sirius' head. The couple were interrupted by a sudden flash and click, which cause Harry to wake up and cry. He was quickly returned to his father, who began gently rocking him. James started singing to the baby while walking back to Lily with a bounce in his step.</p><p>"Who would have thought? James singing," Remus said amazed.</p><p>"Fatherhood will do that to you."</p><p>"Speaking of fatherhood," All eyes were suddenly glued on Remus and Sirius.</p><p>"Moony," Sirius pressed himself against Remus, scared. "I don't like how they're looking at us." They both began walking backwards out of the waiting room.</p><p>"Come now, parenthood isn't so bad."</p><p>"It looks good on you two. Just wait until the photo's printed!"</p><p>"Yeah, you looked cute with the baby."</p><p>"RUN!" Remus took Sirius' hand and they both bolted out of the hospital. There was a light laughter following them.</p>
<hr/><p>The couple spent the first few hours after returning home cleaning and other basic chores between their meals and bathroom breaks. Both had done all this naked as the first chore was laundry and it was easier to get the clothes out of the way first. They found their way to the couch after lunch, thanking Magic for making their lives a little easier. When Remus laid down, Sirius moved to lay on top of him. They both squirmed a bit until finding a comfortable position. Sirius had moved down to press his ear over Remus' heart while his arms were curled up under the broad shoulders. Remus threw the blanket they kept on the back of the couch around them. Then he slipped his arms under the blanket to hold Sirius, one hand tracing patterns on the man's back while the other played with the long hair.</p><p>"Master?" Sirius' voice was hesitant when he finally spoke.</p><p>"Is this about the father comments?" Sirius nodded, leaning into the kiss placed on his temple. "Don't worry. I'm not ready to be one either. I can definitely imagine us becoming parents to one or two kids of our own. That's only in another few years when we're both ready, though."</p><p>"But," Sirius leaned up to look into his husband's eyes. "We're both men. Neither one of us can actually have a baby."</p><p>"So we'll adopt. Or have someone else carry for us. Lily says the Muggles can do that now and the Wizarding medical department's looking into doing the same type of thing."</p><p>"What? You mean one of us have sex with a woman?" Sirius' face twisted in an odd expression. "Master, you don't like anyone else sexually and you get jealous every time I need a physical!"</p><p>Remus chuckled at this. "No, I mean one or both of us making a deposit of sorts inside a cup and giving it over to the Healers. They can then impregnate a woman and she could have the baby for us. There was an article in one of the medical magazines Lily showed me." There was another chuckle when Sirius gawked at the idea. "It was when you were helping James with the nursery last month. Don't worry, I told her we weren't there yet. I think she just got carried away with the idea of having a cousin for Harry close enough in age to have play dates and go to school with. Especially after her sister..." No other explanation was needed.</p><p>Sirius laid back down to their previous position. He couldn't help but smile when fingers started to trace patterns on his back. He shifted and started tracing the same patterns on Remus' chest. It soon became a game of tracing little love notes to each other before they drifted off. The sun had just started to set when they both woke up from their nap. They spent a few moments enjoying each other's heat before nature called. Neither wanted to cook and wanted to stretch their legs so they got dressed to get enough Chinese take away to last them until the next afternoon. They also decided to buy some easy and quick prep meals on the way back, just in case. It wasn't until a little after ten when they were naked and cuddling in bed.</p><p>Sirius assumed they were going straight to sleep when he was rolled onto his back. His arms were then pushed up and held above his head by the wrists before being attacked by Remus' hungry lips. Sirius couldn't help but moan into the kiss and lift his head up for more. He heard himself whimper when Remus started to rub their groins together. His wrists were squeezed and knew to stay still when Remus finally pulled away.</p><p>Sitting back on Sirius' thighs, Remus leaned over to take out two cuffs from the nightstand and dug around the drawer to take out a short chain with three hooks. The cuffs were strapped onto Sirius' waiting wrists. Then the short chain were hooked to attach them to each other. After pulling out the chain that was kept hidden in the headboard, Remus pulled the chained cuffs to fasten the middle hook in. There was a small tug to make sure the arms would stay bound. Sirius expected to be lunged on again. Instead, Remus paused his movements to look down into the now confused grey eyes with a slight frown.</p><p>"How come you don't ever use your safeword?"</p><p>"Huh?" Sirius squirmed, wanting to go on with their physical activity. "What do you mean? I used it that time we tried the whip and flog thing." <em>Of all times to talk about this, it has to be now!?</em></p><p>"You know what I mean." Remus quickly unbuckled the cuffs, releasing the wrists before moving away from Sirius. "Last night, you said no. You never said that when we had sex. Ever." He was curled up into a tight ball now, sitting as far as he could from Sirius on the bed.</p><p><em>He thinks he raped me. </em>The thought sent chills of horror down his spine. "Master?" Sirius quickly moved in front of Remus, who flinched at the word. The distressed state coming from his Master almost made him cry. "Ma-Moony, hold me. Please. You're scaring me. Remus!"</p><p>Remus only moved to trace the now faint bruises on Sirius' hips. With a few more pushes, he moved enough to let Sirius move inside his arms, allowing the scared man to sit between his legs and lean back into his chest. It took a few more nudges and whines before Remus was holding the other man tightly. Sirius began talking in a low whisper, wanting Remus to understand.</p><p>"You didn't rape me. You didn't do anything I didn't like. Last night, I needed it. I needed you to use me and push me to my limits. I said no because I wasn't ready for my own release. The bars were perfect because it meant I could stay open for you. When I saw the wand piercing, I was scared of coming on the spot. Then I saw you take out the vibrator and I almost lost it. I pictured you coming inside me and plugging me with it, and I wouldn't be able to come because the wand would be plugging my dick." Sirius finally moved one of Remus' hands over, covering his hard dick with it. "This is me just thinking about it. My dick hurt so much from being turned on and that felt so good. You know I always liked the bits of pain. I didn't want that part to stop and was worried about dis-pleasing you by coming without your permission. You didn't do anything. I loved it all and believe me, if I hated it, I would have said my safeword." There was another long pause of silence. "Master, say something." Sirius let out a distressed cry when there was only more silence.</p><p>Remus finally moved a few moments later to drizzle soft kisses on Sirius' shoulders. "I'm sorry for scaring you."</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"I don't know. Stress, I suppose. I think that was a delayed bad drop from Top Space we read about."</p><p>Sirius smiled as he leaned back to rest his head on Remus' shoulder.</p><p>"It has been a crazy two days."</p><p>"Are you okay? I mean, you're not dropping badly, are you?"</p><p>"I think I'm okay. You becoming stoic really scared me more than anything else." There was tight squeeze around him with another kiss on the neck. "This is helping."</p><p>"I love you. So much."</p><p>"I love you, too."</p><p>"Don't let me hurt you. Not in ways you don't like. I couldn't bear it."</p><p>"You never have, not even during the full moons. You never will either. We spelled the safeword, remember?"</p><p>"Yeah. That was a good idea."</p><p>They stayed liked this until they became too stiff for comfort. Before they curled together in their usual sleeping position, Sirius requested one thing. The question became a loud whimpering beg halfway through when Remus jumped in to nip at the exposed neck.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Remus had moved to slowly pump Sirius' shaft hard again. Slowly, Remus teasingly licked the fresh hickey and up the jawline to nibble on the quivering man's ear.</p><p>"Tell me what you want, pet."</p><p>"I... I want you, Master."</p><p>"You have me."</p><p>"Master," Sirius began trembling as his piercing was being tugged and head teased in ways he liked. He loved being played with like this. "I need you inside me, please."</p><p>They shifted slowly so Remus could reach for the jar of lube and gave it to Sirius to open. One hand stayed to pump Sirius' shaft the entire time. Remus used his free hand to dip into the jar. When a large glob of lube was taken out, the jar's top was screwed back on and thrown across the room.</p><p>Sirius' breath hitched when three fingers were pressed inside him and bent up into his sweet spot. He automatically drew his legs up against the sides of his stomach and Remus moved to slowly enter him. There was a shiver and loud moans from both men. Sirius' hole was twitching, begging for more.</p><p>"More, please. Master, need you."</p><p>Remus slowly pushed in until he was balls deep. He moved to wrap Sirius' legs around his hips. Then, he leaned forward on his elbows so Sirius' shaft was pressed between their stomachs and press their lips together. The kiss was soft and warm. Only when their tongues were massaging each other did he start moving his hips. Every movement was agonizingly slow and soft. There was a hungry need on edge with every push inside. It was rare they moved like this. This was all about reconnecting and rebuilding the energy between them. Remus broke the kiss with a shaky breath and looked into Sirius' eyes.</p><p>"Master." Sirius began shaking uncontrollably. His hands jerked up to cling onto his Master's back. "Master. Order me, please. Master. I need," there was a sharp intake of breath when the thrusts suddenly became harder and faster. His eyes rolled back as the increased speed cause their belly hairs to send pleasing jolts into his shaft and his Master's thick shaft to hit and stretch every muscle inside him perfectly. They began clenching, wanting to feel more.</p><p>"Yesssss. So good. You're so perfect. Come for me. Now!"</p><p>Both of them were screaming as release flowed through them at the same time. Remus slowly melted into Sirius, whose limbs gripped him in a tight hug. They fell asleep like this.</p></div></div></div>
