    <p>Her mission was simple. Go back in time, kill Tom Riddle as a baby, be done with the entire mess of a timeline.</p><p>Or it should have been simple.</p><p>It was just a few simple turns of a dial. One every ten years. Half turn for 5.</p><p>She just needed to turn the damned thing 7 ½ times. She would wait two years and then kill him and be done with the whole thing. Or better yet, she would kill Merope, after all she was going to die in childbirth anyways.</p><p>At 16 Hermione felt that this was too much to put on her shoulders. But what choice did she have now? Voldemort had killed Harry in that Graveyard, Cedric bringing back his body. Someone had to fight, someone had to do something. It had been Snape who had suggested it, told her exactly what to do. Ron wouldn’t be able to do it; Draco couldn’t be trusted. The other members would get soft. Hermione though, he knew she could handle it.</p><p>Except she couldn’t in the end. She was fucked from the start.</p><p>When she had finally gotten her hands on the time turner, she found herself under attack, spells flying every which direction.</p><p>She turned the time turner, one.</p><p>She dodged out of the way of a curse.</p><p>Two.</p><p>She was halfway done with the third turn when a stunning spell hit her. Her hands fall clasping over the time turner.</p><p>No no no no no.</p><p>She fell to the ground, face first. She couldn’t see who was coming for her, but she could guess. She was doomed.</p><p>And then she felt it, the pulling sensation.</p><p>She heard the scream, <em>his scream.</em></p><p>And then silence.</p><p>She was in the middle of land outside Malfoy manor, where the time turner had been created. There were no death eaters. No one was there.</p><p>She frowned deeply. How far back did she go? she had turned it two and a half times. So, 25 years. Ok so she just needed to spin it 5 more times. She opened the hand she had held the time turner in. wincing as she opened it. Tiny glass shard embedded in her skin; the sand mixed with blood. She cursed rather loudly. Taking out the glass in her hand, grateful that none of the sand had gotten into the wound. Gods only knew what that would do.</p><p>She was examining her hand when she heard it, the sound of footsteps. Immediately she turned around, wand drawn, spell on her lips, pointed directly at two boys.</p><p>Both quickly drew their wands.</p><p>“We saw you come out of nowhere, we assumed it was an apparition gone wrong” the blond said watching her closely, “we mean you no harm. Just wanted to make sure you weren’t splinched.”</p><p>She knew that voice. It was younger now, but still had that snotty tone to it. She wondered if the Malfoys grew into that tone or if they were born with it.</p><p>She looked at the other boy, finding herself slightly surprised. She knew that boy too, though much better than the first.</p><p>It was the sight of Severus Snape that made her slowly put her wand down.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I was under attack and I did the only thing I could and apparated but ended up hurting myself” Hermione lied, watching both boys lower their wands slowly, though Lucius still had his out, in his hand ready.</p><p>Was he a death eater now? Would she die here if she said she was muggleborn.</p><p>“Attacked by what?” he asked.</p><p>Hermione frowned at him, her blood dripping into the ground, and she made no move to heal it. “Fenrir Grayback and his pack” she said. She knew that Fenrir was a terror in this time. “I was gathering supplies from the woods not far from here and he surprised me.”</p><p>“What did he want with you?” again, that snotty attitude. “He wouldn’t dare to attack a pureblood.”</p><p>“He didn’t stop and ask for my blood status” she snapped, watching his eyes narrow on her “I’m a woman, he is a known rapist and killer. What do you think he wanted?” she asked clenching her fist, the blood dripping fast now.</p><p>Lucius Actually did lower his wand an put it away this time “Well, that’s true, come, lets get you cleaned up” he said. He took in the state of her robes, her dress. She had been planning on being in the 1920s not the 1970s, so she was certain she looked a little out of place in her current clothes. She knew most women wore jeans in this era, here she was in a dress and a bowl hat and black robes.</p><p>Despite the fact that Lucius claimed that Fenrir would not dare attack a pureblood, he made sure to lock the gate and warn the staff. She hid a smirk but followed him inside the manor quietly, Snape at her heels.</p><p>It was strange, being surrounded by two people she knew, but not having to be in battle. Lucius Took her to a room, a bathroom she noted and said he would be right back. Severus stayed back, watching as Hermione cleaned her hands of the blood, using a basic healing spell she knew from her many duels to close the wound.</p><p>Severus was watching her carefully when she turned around, “What is your name?” he asked</p><p>“Hermione. Yours?” she replied deciding to play it cool, like she didn’t care either way. Her best bet right now was to play as a half blood. It wouldn’t get her killed at the very least.</p><p>“Severus. Severus Snape.” He replied.</p><p>Hermione frowned at him “that’s a muggle name is it not?” she asked</p><p>He gritted his teeth “An unfortunate inheritance from my father. My mother made the horrible decision to marry the man”</p><p>She had hit a swore spot. She shrugged “We can’t help how we are born. I’m Hermione Jean. “she said “An inheritance from my own muggle father.”</p><p>“So, you are half-blood?” it was Lucius back with what looked like clothes for her. She took stock in what she was wearing and noticed how damaged they were from her duel. Well no wonder the looks they were giving her.</p><p>“Yes” she replied.</p><p>Lucius sniffed slightly but handed her the clothes.</p><p>“thank you” she said. The two boys gave her privacy while she changed.</p><p>The clothes he brought he must belong to his mother, who was a bit bigger than she was, thankfully Hermione knew enough spells that she managed to make the clothes fit her well enough. She washed her face from the debris and blood and fixed her hair. Her robes were a mess unfortunately, so she shoved them, her hat and the torn clothes into her beaded bag before she exited the bathroom.</p><p>Both boys appraised her as she came out.</p><p>“Lovely” it was a woman’s voice that came down the hall. A beautiful blond woman sauntering down the hallway “You look just lovely in that dear. Lucius was just telling me about your horrid experience!” she said as she led Hermione down the hall to a sitting room, sitting her next to a fire “What ever were you doing out there all by yourself?” she asked “why weren’t your parents with you?”</p><p>“My parents are dead miss” she said, clenching the hem on her skirt, looking down “I’m on my own right now. I was gathering ingredients from the woods when I was attacked.”</p><p>“Who is taking care of you!” Mrs. Malfoy exclaimed “Where are you staying?”</p><p>“Well, no one is. I find shelter where I can right now.” She said</p><p>“We’ve never seen you at Hogwarts.” Lucius murmured, crossing his arms.</p><p>“My mother chose to homeschool me” she replied. She could tell that she and Lucius were not going to get along much. It didn’t help that his mother was making such a fuss over her.</p><p>“Your poor child. No one to care for you! That just won’t do. Dobby!” Hermione watched as the house elf appeared.</p><p>“Yes Mistress?” he asked in his squeaky voice.</p><p>“Prepare a room for miss…”</p><p>“Jean.” Severus said, “Hermione Jean.”</p><p>“Thank you, Severus. Prepare a room for Hermione, she will be staying here until the school year starts” she said. Dobby nodded and vanished.</p><p>“Miss, I can’t- “</p><p>“Mother she- “both herself and Lucius started at the same time, but she shushed them both “I will have no arguments.” She turned to her son “We can’t let her live on the streets, the poor child.” She patted Hermione’s hand gently “Plus, it will be nice to have another woman in the house” she said conspiringly “I have always wanted a daughter”</p><p>Hermione could hear Lucius sigh.</p><p>“Well thank you miss…”</p><p>“Malfoy. But you can call me Lucinda.” She said.</p><p>Hermione smiled and nodded “thank you for everything.” She said.</p><p>________</p><p>It turned out that staying in Malfoy manor was not what she expected. Abraxas Malfoy was not like his son in the least, he seemed kinder, more polite.</p><p>He seemed thrilled to have her in his house, despite the fact that she claimed to be half blood. She wondered if he would be so kind if she told them she was muggleborn. She highly doubted it.</p><p>It turned out that the Malfoys had always wanted a daughter, which might explain why Lucius was so surly about all this. Both of them doted on her, despite her protests.</p><p>It had been the end of June when she arrived and in the few short months Hermione had found herself quite comfortable at the manor. Eventually Lucius warmed up to her, at least enough that they could sit in the same room together without him glaring in her direction.</p><p>It was one evening, a week before school would start that Abraxas and Lucinda sat them both down.</p><p>“Hermione, Lucinda and I have been talking about it, and we would like to adopt you into the family.”</p><p>“What?” Lucius and herself said at the same time, though Lucius was more appalled while she was just generally shocked. Lucinda gave Lucius a glare and he sat back.</p><p>“She’s a half blood. No one would want her as marriage material in the sacred 28” Lucius pointed out, “she’d have to marry a half blood or worse. That would sully the family name”</p><p>Abraxas looked at his son, disappointment in his eyes. He got up and gestured for Lucius to come with him.</p><p>Hermione watched as they went to the other side of the parlor, talking in hushed tones. She caught bits and pieces of the conversation, something about permission and talk of the dark lord.</p><p>Lucinda smiled at Hermione, taking her hands “I know you have been on your own, and this must be overwhelming, going to Hogwarts, getting adopted. We don’t want to replace your parents, but we would like to give you a new start. Taking the name Malfoy will give you a huge step up in the world, despite blood status. And Maybe one of the sacred 28 won’t marry you, but there are other pureblood families. The potters, the blacks have a rebellious son. There are a great many.</p><p>Hermione nodded, speechless. The woman was right, it was a good advantage, especially if she was stuck in this time. She already knew this family was involved with Voldemort, if she was adopted into it, especially if what she overheard was correct, then she would be able to get inside his forces. She might be able to succeed in her mission yet.</p><p>Lucius sat down in the chair across from her, giving her an appraising look as he and his father joined him. Whatever they had talked about made Lucius more mailable. She would have to ask him about it later, though she doubted he would tell her.</p><p>“What do you say Hermione? We will do a Magical Adoption; your blood will be mixed with my own. Now you might take on some aspects of a Malfoy, so be aware of that, but you will still be you.”</p><p>Hermione knew how magical adoption worked; she had read about it once, always wondering why the Weasleys didn’t just do it with harry.</p><p>Slowly she nodded, a smile on her face “I would love to be able to be called your daughter, to have a family again” she looked at Lucius who had his eyes narrowed “to gain a brother”</p><p>Lucinda grinned and Abraxas hugged her, but her eyes never left Lucius, seeing him stalk off, his anger palpable.</p><p>__</p><p>Abraxas apparently had not been joking about having talked about this thoroughly with his wife, for the next day he had to paperwork finalized and the blood ritual executed. By ten that morning she was no longer Hermione Jean (Granger). But Hermione Luciel Malfoy. Her adoptive parents had asked what her middle name was, and she told them she had not been given one, so they asked her if they could. She had agreed.</p><p>Lucius was withdrawn as ever, barely looking at her, not talking to her.</p><p>She would have to figure out a way to mend the fence between them, for whatever bitterness there was, could not be allowed to remain.</p><p>Abraxas had been correct, some of her features had changed, but not drastically thank god. Her brown hair turned a lighter brown and be brown eyes had specks of blue in them now. Her hair was a little straighter, but just barely. No, she still looked like herself, for the most part. Her body was still the same type, her nose skin color, all the same.</p><p>It was a relief, the last thing she had wanted was that platinum blond straight hair.</p><p>She had come down for breakfast that morning and found that everyone had left already, except Lucius. He glared at her.</p><p>“I see you have remained slightly the same” he commented “Mother will be pleased” his tone suggested he was not.</p><p>Hermione sighed “Ok Luce, lets have it. Why do you hate me?” she asked bluntly.</p><p>“I don’t- “</p><p>“cut the crap. Ever since your mother showed me affection you have hated me. The first day we met, the very beginning there was mild interest maybe curiosity, but now it is just hostility. So why? What did I do?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>The word made her pause “nothing? So, you hate me for no reason?”</p><p>“No, I- They always wanted a little girl. They tried over and over, but they couldn’t have another child. It tore them up. I was all they had, but they never hid the fact that they wished I had been female.” He said softly “despite the fact that I can carry the line on.”</p><p>Hermione felt stupid, realization dawning on her. The name Luciel, the way they both doted on her. She had been so caught up in it she hadn’t realized “Then I came along” she whispered</p><p>“Yes, then you came along. Do you realize that in a matter of months you have had more love and affection then I have ever received from them?” his tone was bitter, angry.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” She said. She had been sitting across the table from him, but she got up now, crossing over and embracing him.</p><p>Lucius stiffened “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m giving my brother a hug” she replied before pulling away “Look Lucius, I didn’t ask for this, but I can understand how you feel. I can relate in a way. My parents always wanted a little boy, but instead they got me, a Brainiac with a thirst of knowledge. This adoption, it doesn’t have to be bad. Yes, they got a daughter, but you got a sister. If they won’t give you the love you deserve, then its my job to do so.” She squeezed his hand gently “I’m not asking you to not hate me, or to hate the situation. But if you decide you want to bond as brother and sister, then I will be here. Always” she promised.</p><p>Lucius was quiet for a long time, letting her hold him, and then finally he squeezed her hand and gave her a hug back.</p><p>–</p><p>After their talk, she and Lucius became fast friends, he was much different than the Lucius of her time, though she had a feeling that was because of her presence. The home seemed warmer with her in it, at least that was what he told her. They conspired, like siblings should to use their parents doting on her against them. Often, she would mention something that she liked, and her adoptive parents would fall over themselves to get it for her.</p><p>It was almost always something she and Lucius had agreed on.</p><p>Lucinda had insisted that they all go as a family to purchase their books, and Hermione wanted to groan, she knew that this would be a long trip.</p><p>It turned out she was right. Her adoptive mother took her from shop to shop, the men breaking off to actually go to Gringotts while Hermione was forced to get an entirely new wardrobe.</p><p>She didn’t complain though, for she knew this made the woman happy, and it was the least she could do. They met up with the boys, their packages being delivered to the manor later that night and headed to the stores.</p><p>It was interesting to see the way they treated Lucius verses her. When he tried to get something extra, like a fancy quill that had caught his eye, or a book he wanted, he was told to put it back.</p><p>As an experiment Hermione wandered over to Lucius giving him a smile “lets see if this works” she said softly as she took the book and quill, he had wanted and placed it in her basket. They did this for several items he wanted.</p><p>For giggles she put in something his basket that was the exact same as hers.</p><p>As expected, the item she had put in was forced out of his basket, but they bought all her items.</p><p>She gave Lucius a smile, and he smiled back.</p><p>__</p><p>Soon enough they were on their way to Hogwarts, and Hermione found herself nervous. Not because it was Hogwarts, or because she never had been in a school before, but the sorting itself. She wasn’t sure she could handle being a Gryffindor without Harry and Ron.</p><p>Lucius assured her it would be alright, that the hat would probably sort her in Ravenclaw or Slytherin.</p><p>“Though, if you get sorted into Hufflepuff we will have to disown you” he teased her, making her snort.</p><p>“I don’t know, I read the common room is right by the kitchens, sounds like a sweet set up to me” she teased back.</p><p>The door to their train car opened and Severus walked inside, looking at them both.</p><p>“They adopted her” Lucius explained “Meet my sister, Hermione Luciel Malfoy” he said his tone bored, though Hermione was not fooled. They had grown together since their talk, had helped eachother.</p><p>Severus frowned “Really?” he asked sitting next to her.</p><p>Hermione raised her eyebrow “what do you mean by that?” she asked</p><p>“Your blood status…”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter” Lucius cut in “To everyone she is a pureblood, raised secretly, not wanting anyone to harm her. Now she is of age and will be joining Hogwarts.”</p><p>“and the fact you look very little alike? How are you going to explain that you are the same age?” Severus questioned.</p><p>“We are fraternal twins, and just like any siblings, we can be different. I favor mother while he favors father. Simple as that” she replied</p><p>Severus nodded but said nothing.</p><p>“Lily won’t talk to you?” Lucius asked, turning to his fellow Slytherin. Hermione frowned. “Lily?” she inquired</p><p>“She was his best friend, a muggleborn,” his tone held a bit of contempt at the word,” unfortunately Potter and his gang decided to pick on Severus, and in his anger, he called her a mudblood.”</p><p>Hermione winced at the word. “You—”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to, and I didn’t mean it either. I wasn’t thinking and…”</p><p>Hermione frowned, knowing how that could go. Gently she reached out and squeezed his hand, despite the look Lucius gave her “Don’t worry. She’ll forgive you one day. Until then, I can be your friend, if you would like”</p><p>Severus frowned at her, looking at her hand and then back up at her.</p><p>She smiled at the man who would become her mentor or had been. Who would become her greatest alley and her hero? “I think you and I will have a lot in common” she said with a smile.</p><p>In truth, she knew they did.</p>
