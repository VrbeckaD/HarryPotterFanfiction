          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Draco? You in here?”</p><p>Harry groans internally. <i>No. No he’s not here, go away. </i></p><p>An auburn-haired man slips into the auror office, this time with a dozen red balloons and a box of chocolates. Draco looks up from his desk with suprise and jumps alert.</p><p>The blond runs a hand through his hair, squinting at the man’s face, “Oh! Hi, um…”</p><p>“Parker,” Harry whispers.</p><p>“-Parker!”</p><p>The man walks further into the room, a confused look morphing his features. He grabs Draco by the shoulders and plants a kiss on his cheek, “What?”

</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes. <i>Idiot. </i></p><p>“Huh? Oh, I meant Paul, of course-” Draco shoots Harry dirty look while the brunet bites down a laugh, “-just a bit, er, distracted… at the moment.”</p><p>Paul laughs, “Distracted enough to forget that I’d be suprising you for our five month anniversary?”</p><p>“Five months! I- it’s been five months?” Draco splutters.</p><p>“Yeah, time flies when you’re in love, doesn’t it?” Paul dawns a sickeningly sweet smile and sits down on Draco’s desk, taking in the room. 

</p><p>“Oh, Hi Harry!”</p><p>The brunet forces a cordial grin, “Peter, right?”</p><p>Harry stands and jaunts over to Draco’s desk, reaching in between him and his <i>boyfriend</i>, and grabbing the box of chocolates. He tears it open messily and takes a savoring bite of the caramel, a small sneer on his lips.</p><p>The auburn’s face is bright red, but he calmly coughs and puts an arm around the blond’s shoulder, “Well, I- uh, only come around nearly everyday, you know.”</p><p>Harry glares a bit, “Yes. I know.”</p><p>All the while, Draco stands looking absolutely perplexed.</p><p>“Er,<i> Paul</i>? How’d you get out of work this time?” He asks.</p><p>“I have lunch at this time everyday,” Paul laughs. <i>Must he laugh so bloody often? </i></p><p>“Silly goose,“ He continues, “Do I have to remind you every time I come by?”</p><p>Harry drops the chocolates and turns back to his desk, mouthing, “Silly goose?”. 

</p><p><i>The chocolates are too expensive anyway</i>, he thinks. <i>Why would </i>Draco <i>of all people want such an expensive gift? He’s a Malfoy for goodness sakes!</i></p><p>The office lulls into an awkward silence. </p><p>Paul squeezes Draco’s shoulder and laughs again, “Well, I’d better get going love,” He leans in and gives the blond what looks like a slobbery kiss.</p><p>Draco turns his head and wipes his mouth, “Yeah, see you later… love?”</p><p>The man drops the balloon anchor next to Draco’s desk and walks slowly to the door. “I’ll see you later for our <i>hot date</i>,” he winks.</p><p>“Wouldn’t miss is for the world,” Draco plasters a large grin and Paul leaves the room.</p><p>Immediatly, the blond fall backwards onto his desk, boneless.</p><p>“Love you!” Paul bursts back in and out so quickly that Draco nearly falls off his desk.

</p><p>“Oh dear Merlin, I have <i>got </i>to break up with him!”</p><p>Harry regains his bubbly disposition and jumps excitedly over into Draco’s chair. “Oh look! <i>Perry</i> left another note!” He sneers.</p><p>“Please. No.”</p><p>The brunette clears his throat, ignoring his partner, “Let’s see. It’s says, and I quote, ‘Dear Lovebug,’- Eugh. What is it with guy and nicknames? Anyway-</p><p>‘Dear Lovebug, I can not tell you how lucky I feel to have spent five <i>amazing</i> months with you. It feels like every moment I spend with you is another moment falling in love-’ ” Harry rolls his eyes over-dramatically, “ ‘-Tonight is going to be <i>very</i> special. Just wait until you see what I have in store. Happy Anniversary, <i>Patrick</i>.’ ”

</p><p>Harry breaks into a round of depreciating applause, “Well. That was something, wasn’t it?”</p><p>Draco runs a hand over his face, “I <i>really </i>want to skip tonight. Have I told you that he fucks like a fifteen year-old? Out in, literally, a minute!”</p><p>“You absolutely have,” Harry drops his head into his hands, beaming, “Tell me more.”</p><p>Draco laughs brightly, the way Harry loves him to, and puts a hand on his shoulder, “I’ve got to go force Robards to put us on a late-night assignment, you don’t mind working late? Do you?”</p><p>Harry smirks and bites his lip, “Nope, not at all.”</p><p>“Good,” The blond jumps up and grabs his auror robes from the hook by the door, “Now if I could just remember to break up with the idiot.”</p><p>Harry smiles dreamily.
</p><p><i>Well, </i>he thinks, <i>at least I’ll always have this. </i></p></div>
