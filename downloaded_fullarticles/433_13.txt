          <div class="userstuff"><p>“<em>It’s only three chocolate frogs and a bottle of Butterbeer,</em>” Harry had muttered, throwing a paper bag down beside Draco’s feet. “<em>Why? I know how shite these stake-outs can be… Yeah, you always get lumbered with them… No, I don’t want your Sickles, Malfoy.  It's my treat… I’m going now but if you need me, Firecall, okay?</em>”</p>
<p>For the life of him, Draco couldn’t understand why Harry was always so <em>nice</em> to him. He didn’t deserve Potter’s easy smiles or his unwavering friendship. </p>
<p>But sometimes, Draco knew, Harry's small kindnesses were enough to get him through even the worst days.</p></div>
