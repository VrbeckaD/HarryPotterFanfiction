    <p>Dividing meat into good-sized portions was without doubt his least favorite chore, Credence thought to himself. It wasn't so much that it was heavy and arduous work that bothered him; it was the task itself. The whole thing about wielding the meat cleaver and the sound it made on contact, the feeling that shot through his arm when the blade sunk into meat and bone, it just made his stomach churn and there was something inside him that almost wanted to apologize to the poor chunk of meat he was chopping. But he never complained. Mr. Scamander usually didn't ask Credence to chop meat; he'd seen the unease with which Credence undertook the task and he often tried to give Credence something else to do instead. But tonight, Mr. Scamander had other matters to tend to. Credence raised the cleaver again and bore it down hard on the chunk of meat. The crunching sound when he hit bone made him wince.</p><p>There was a soft tap from the ceiling and as he looked up the wooden ladder, Mr Scamander's freckled face was looking down at him.</p><p>“We're here,” he said and shook his ginger hair out of his eyes. “Up you come!” His face disappeared and left a rectangle of light streaming down instead. It was the pink and apricot of sundown. “Oh, better bring your coat!” Mr. Scamander added and his face popped into view again. “And maybe a scarf. Spring still seems to be some way away now.”</p><p>Credence couldn't help the smile. There was something in the way that Mr Scamander sometimes would treat some people like they were fascinating creatures to be studied and taken care of, that made a warmth spread within Credence. Not the same kind of tingling warmth he had felt with…</p><p>Credence quickly brushed that thought and the ghost of that particular memory, away. He shrugged on his woolen coat. It was a rich and deep burgundy and the collar was lined with fur but he took his scarf anyway. The coat had once belonged to a lady, Credence sure could tell. It was different from the coat Mr. Scamander wore in so that it hung differently. To be fair, Credence didn't know much about clothes, but he could tell it was a lady's coat. He didn't mind, he loved it anyway. It had gold embroidery around the cuffs and along the back. It had been the first thing he ever bought in his life, with money Mr. Scamander had given him.</p><p>“Consider it payment for the work you've done,” Mr. Scamander had persuaded him when at first he had protested. Reluctantly, Credence had accepted and he had bought the coat from a woman selling a wide assortment of old clothes off a table in the street. He had bought the knitted scarf from an old lady in a market square. The scarf was made up of all the colors of the rainbow and then some. Apparently the lady had knitted it from leftovers from other projects and no one seemed to want such a vibrant scarf. But Credence did. He was sick and tired of black and the fact that the scarf had been rejected by so many others for being different, just made Credence love it even more. The irony was not lost on him, but he didn't really care. Now he wrapped it loosely around himself before he ascended the wooden ladder into the blazing colors of a magnificent sunset across the lake and behind the mountains.</p><p>They were standing in front of the ruins of a castle atop a small hill. Half of the castle seemed to have been simply torn off, or maybe even blown away in an explosion. The other half was barely standing, most of the roof had caved in and all the windows were shattered. Vegetation had reclaimed most of the grounds as everything was overgrown and wild and moss and plants clung to the castle walls. All in all, it made Credence shiver a little and he pulled his coat tighter around him. It was a rather unwelcoming place.</p><p>“Mr. Scamander,” he said and tugged on the other man's peacock blue sleeve to stop him from going through the wrought iron gates that hung on their hinges, rust discoloring them in patches.<br/>
“Mr. Scamander, I don't think we should… I don't think we're welcome here,” he added quietly, feeling a little silly for the uneasiness inside him.</p><p>“Don't worry, Credence. It's perfectly all right. The invitation specifically said we were to go here,” Mr. Scamander said and looked up at the castle with his head slightly tilted to one side. He had tried to convince Credence to call him by his first name but it just didn't feel right, so Credence kept using his last name and somewhere along the way, Mr. Scamander must have gotten used to it because he had stopped asking Credence to use his first name.</p><p>Credence had spent countless hours walking behind Mr. Scamander and it always had a soothing effect seeing the lopsided figure briskly walking in front of him, while Credence did his best, trying to keep up with Mr. Scamander’s wobbling gait. He was a strange man indeed, but a kind one at heart, Credence thought to himself as they made their way towards the castle ruins. Though, like Credence, Mr. Scamander rarely seemed at home talking to and interacting with other people. But Credence didn’t mind. He liked being in the company of Mr. Scamander, the man never demanding anything from Credence, never expecting him to chitchat or behave a certain way. Mr. Scamander just let Credence be, and for that Credence was ever grateful.</p><p>“Mr. Scamander,” he asked, his voice barely more than a whisper. “What happened to the castle?” Mr. Scamander paused with his hand on the disintegrating door. He turned his head a little towards Credence, his brow furrowed like he wasn’t really sure what Credence was asking.</p><p>“Erumpent horn,” Mr. Scamander said with a small nod to himself as if agreeing with someone Credence couldn’t hear.. “Quite possibly.” Another small nod. “Most likely,” he added with a third nod. Credence had noticed he often did that. “I should say, about some hundred years ago. Now, come along, Credence!” Mr. Scamander said and pushed the remnants of the door and Credence found himself standing in a derelict hallway, wallpaper peeling of the walls, whole sections of walls having crumbled, parts of the caved in roof blocking what had once been doorways.</p><p>“This way,” Mr. Scamander said and walked briskly up a crumbling staircase to the left. “Come along now!” he called down to Credence who quickly followed suit. He didn’t much like the idea of being left alone in the ruins. He found Mr. Scamander in a sitting room that must once have been cozy and comfortable but now it was cold and unwelcoming. The window was broken and cold evening air came seeping through where there once had been glass. Books were scattered all over the place, some seemed to have been burned by something, some had pages all torn out of them. Picture frames lay broken in the debris on the floor. Credence felt dread rising inside him. Had an erumpent horn really caused all this?</p><p>“Mr. Scamander,” Credence whispered hesitantly but then he startled as with a pop, a plump woman suddenly turned up. He still hadn’t gotten used to the phenomenon of Apparition. She was wearing brown, dirty overalls that hugged her full-figured body tightly, and she had short, messy, auburn hair in wild disarray. Her face was dirty and most of it was covered by a pair of welding goggles with pitch-black glass. She was wearing oddly shaped, three-fingered leather gloves that reached beyond her elbows.</p><p>“Scamander!” the woman barked and Credence shrunk back into the shadows. “Ye’re almost late!” the woman said then and grabbed hold of Mr. Scamander’s arm before anyone could protest. They were gone with a loud ‘pop!’ and Credence felt panic rising inside of him. He looked about the room and tried to find a clue as to where Mr. Scamander might have gone. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw movements and realized it came from the photographs scattered and torn on the floor. They were magical photographs, their motifs moving and smiling and winking and laughing. He bent down to take a closer look but a loud pop startled him. The woman was standing before him, looking utterly wild with the black glasses covering her eyes and her hair standing on end.</p><p>"Come along, Barebone!" the woman barked. A three-fingered leather glove grabbed his wrist and he braced himself for the pressing darkness he knew was coming. But in the split second before it did, Credence glanced around the room one final time and suddenly his stomach dropped, his heart seemed to stop and his lungs no longer drew breath. He thought he'd seen…</p><p>And then the darkness pressed all around him, always with that sickening feeling of being suffocated until finally he felt ground beneath his feet again and the tight pressure around his chest disappeared. He found himself in a cave of some sort, a huge fire crackling in the middle of the cave. It rose almost halfway up to the ceiling and the light flicked and cast deep shadows around the vast cave. Slowly circling the fire, was Mr. Scamander, a curious look on his face. The woman was already moving towards the fire, seemingly unnerved by just having Apparated four times in swift succession. Credence still got a little lightheaded whenever he had to go through the suffocating means of transport.</p><p>"Where'd you get them?" Mr. Scamander asked softly. The woman was standing so close to the fire, Credence was sure she'd burst into flames herself. The light flickered in the black glass of her welding goggles and gave her an equally menacing and crazed look. Credence tried to catch Mr. Scamander's eyes but the magizoologist was completely engulfed, his full attention focused at something seemingly in the middle of the fire.</p><p>"Aren't they lovely?" The woman said, a giddy grin across her face, her teeth almost unnaturally white amidst all the soot and dirt smudges.</p><p>"Are they what I think they are?" Mr. Scamander gasped then, having caught sight of something in the fire.</p><p>"Yeah," the woman grinned.</p><p>"Well, I'll say." Mr. Scamander knelt before the fire, keeping a far more cautious distance than the woman, but Credence could plainly see the curiosity dancing across his face.</p><p>"What happened to the mother?" he asked and that's when Credence started hearing a faint sound, like something cracking.</p><p>"Zoltàn," the woman snarled and Credence wasn't quite sure whether she had just growled a curse or not. "The spineless, loathsome miscreant murdered her for the scales and claws and heartstring and what have ye."</p><p>Mr. Scamander nodded and hummed his understanding with a solemn look upon his face. The woman inched ever closer to the fire. Soon, she would surely be engulfed by it completely.</p><p>Credence heard something cracking then, followed by soft squeal. The woman reached her gloved hands into the fire and when they emerged again, completely unharmed to Credence great surprise, they were cradling a creature the size of a small dog.</p><p>"Hello," the woman whispered softly and pushed her goggles up her forehead. Where they had been, they left pink pale rings amidst all the soot and dirt. The creature squealed again and the woman brought it close to her chest, stroking it gently with the three-fingered gloves still on. The creature unfolded its arms, which turned out to be wings, and squealed again, a head something like a snake or an Occamy for that matter reached up and sniffed gingerly at the woman. Credence suddenly realized what she was holding.</p><p>"Dragons!" he gasped and took a step back.</p><p>"Not just dragons, lad," the woman said softly, her giddy smile so wide it almost reached her ears. "The most beautiful and dangerous and lethal kind there is; Hungarian Horntails."</p><p>The baby dragon, for though it was quite sizeable for a baby, Credence realized that's what it was, settled in and curled itself up in the woman's lap.</p><p>"Newt,” she whispered when another crack was heard from the fire. She held out one of her hands and Mr. Scamander hurried around the fire and pulled off the glove from the woman's outstretched arm. When the gloves came off, two things surprised Credence; one, the woman had all ten fingers intact. He hadn't known what to expect since both gloves were three-fingered. Two, all over her hands and fingers were strange markings in a bluish black. Symbols and letters, he realized, letters spelling words he was too far away to try and read and probably couldn't anyway even if he was close enough to examine the woman's hands. Mr. Scamander pulled a second baby dragon out of the fire and brought it to the woman who cradled it and stroked it gently. It too, squeaked and reached up to sniff her face. It gently shook its snout against her nose and something raw twisted inside Credence at the sight of such pure affection. He heard the cracking sound again.</p><p>“There’s another one!” he exclaimed excitedly and took several steps closer to the fire without even noticing. “Mr. Scamander, there’s another one!”</p><p>“Yep,” the woman smiled at him. “There were five, I’d reckon but when I found them only three remained.”</p><p>“Where are the others?” he asked, looking at the woman cradling the two babies in her lap.</p><p>“Poachers. Thieves. Miscreants. They steal the eggs, and sell them to the highest bidder. I fear they’ll end up in someone's bank vault before long,” the woman growled and Credence heart leaped when her bushy eyebrows furrowed that way. She reminded him so much of…</p><p>“Credence,” Mr. Scamander interrupted his thoughts. “Would you like to…?” he said and held out the three-fingered leather gloves towards him. Credence glanced at the woman, unconsciously worrying his lower lip with his teeth.</p><p>“Go on!” the woman nodded encouragingly. “They won’t bite. Well, not hard anyway,” she added after glancing at Mr. Scamander and the small, crooked smile playing in the corners of his mouth. Credence stuck his hands in the gloves. It felt rather strange to wear them, his fingers needing to pair up and separate unnaturally to fit in the gloves.</p><p>“Just reach in and hold out your hands, it should climb onto you by itself,” Mr. Scamander guided him without meeting his eyes. They rarely locked eyes, Mr. Scamander and him, but Credence didn’t mind. After all, he didn’t particularly enjoy staring into people’s eyes himself. He took a deep breath and slowly stuck his gloved hands in the fire, turning his face away, preparing for the searing heat that would surely come, but he hardly felt the fire around him. Then he felt something bump into his hands and he felt a weight pressing down on them as something clambered into his hands, gripping firmly.</p><p>“There you are,” Mr. Scamander spoke softly, close to his ear. “Now, carefully, slowly, pull it out of the fire.” As Credence did, his heart raced with excitement. The baby dragon emerged, squeaking and staring at him. It was smaller than the other two, but just as black and scaly and beautiful. It clambered over his hands, trying to reach his face. It opened its mouth and hissed at him.</p><p>“Oh dear,” Mr. Scamander said. “Credence, you had better…” Before he could finish the sentence the baby dragon hissed again and reached up on its hind legs, digging its front claws into Credence’s shoulders. It cocked its head and stared him straight in the eyes, hissing again. Credence dared not move.</p><p>“Ye didn’t get rid of the Obscurus, did ye?” the woman asked calmly. Credence eyes darted to her, feeling the panic rising in him. She <em>knew</em>.</p><p>“I’ve been working on a way…” Mr. Scamander said, trailing off. He had indeed been, but nothing had worked so far. “It’s parasitic, and it really does put up a rather good fight…” he mumbled and wouldn’t meet her eyes. Inside Credence, the storm was brewing and he could feel it rising.</p><p>“Credence,” the woman said calmly. “Breathe. Just breathe with me. In, and out.” She instructed him with a calm and steady voice but it had the opposite effect on him. Lord have mercy, she reminded him so much of…</p><p>He tried so hard every moment of his waking hours not to think about that man. He really shouldn’t. Nothing good would come of it, Credence knew that. But his dark eyes and bushy eyebrows and greying temples kept making Credence heart race. He’d been so sure he’d seen… And the woman reminded him so much of that man. Credence felt a silly tear trickle down his cheek. The baby dragon reached out and flicked its tongue at it, wiping it away. Credence opened his eyes in surprise. The dragon looked at him and sniffed at his face, blowing small puffs of air and smoke onto his cheeks. The dragon squeaked then and rubbed its snout against his nose. It squeaked again before settling into his lap, curling up and falling asleep.</p><p>“There you are, m’boy,” the woman said kindly and Credence looked at her then, unsure of himself.  She really did look like him, like... Though her hair was auburn and her bushy eyebrows not nearly as thick as his, though her lips were fuller and her nose not quite as pointy, though her eyes were a piercing green and not a deep brown, she did look like him and it made Credence heart skip a beat. The dragon in his lap was sleeping calmly and Credence stroked it absentmindedly. The woman had turned to the baby dragons in her lap. Credence had to know.</p><p>“Mr. Scamander,” he said quietly and the magizoologist knelt beside him. “In that room, I thought I saw a picture of… Well. Someone I knew once. But that’s… That’s just a trick of the light, isn’t it?” Credence asked and wouldn’t meet Mr. Scamander’s eyes.</p><p>“Bleeding skies!” the woman muttered under her breath. “You didn’t tell him, did you, Scamander?” she said and scowled at the magizoologist.</p><p>“Well, I was in a hurry, wasn’t I?” the redheaded man said and shrugged in a slightly defensive manner. “Your message said it was urgent,” he said and looked at her with his head a little tilted to the side and defiantly meeting her gaze.</p><p>“Heavens this will be a long night, won’t it?” the woman muttered to herself. “Well. Get going. Sitting room, lads. Put the kettle on will ye?”</p><p>“Come along, Credence,” Mr. Scamander said quietly and helped him get to his feet. The woman mumbled something Credence couldn’t quite make out and the fire died down. The floor of the cave broke apart and reshaped itself in places and formed a ring of stones around the glowing embers. A shelf of rock jutted out over the embers and Credence realized it was a nest for the baby dragons. He gently put the one in his arms in the nook of the shelf and Mr. Scamander took one of the dragons the woman was holding and placed it too in the nest. The woman put the last of the dragons in the nest and straightened up.</p><p>“Right, off ye go,” she said and Credence couldn’t quite make out what the tone in her voice meant. “Kettle, Scamander. Be right there,” she said and busied herself with the stones and embers.</p><p>“Come along, Credence,” Mr. Scamander said again and ushered him to a door he hadn’t seen until then. They walked up a winding stone staircase and before long; Credence found himself standing in a splendid sitting room, a fire crackling cozily in the fireplace. He looked about him, confused. It looked rather a lot like the sitting room they had been in when they first met the woman, except this room was well kept and tidy, cozy and warm. The windows were whole and the bookshelves stacked with hundreds of books, all looking to be in rather good shape.</p><p>“But…” Credence mumbled to himself. “Mr. Scamander, this…”</p><p>“... Is what it looked like when we got here, yes. But I’d wager it looked rather derelict and uninhibited to you, didn’t it?” Mr. Scamander said with that barely noticeable crooked half-smile of his as Credence nodded. “Yeah, that’s Gertie’s way of keeping strangers away.”</p><p>“Gertie?” Credence asked, confused.</p><p>“Ah, yes, that’s right. She didn’t introduce herself. I’m sure she will. But, Credence, there is… Well, perhaps I ought to have told you before we came here…” Mr. Scamander trailed off. “You’d better see for yourself. Come and take a look at these,” Mr. Scamander said and pointed to a table with several picture frames Credence could only see the back of. As Credence came closer and saw photographs themselves, his stomach tied itself into a knot. About half the pictures showed the woman Credence realized was Gertie, along with another, astoundingly beautiful woman. They were dancing and laughing, the little figures moving and laughing and dancing forever captured in the magical photograph. In one of them, the women seemed to be having a fight with ice cream, their faces were completely covered in ice cream and they were laughing like they had never seen anything funnier in their lives. Some of the pictures showed Gertie taking care of different animals, mostly dragons but also creatures Credence had never seen, not even in Mr. Scamander’s case or books or drawings. One of the pictures showed her in a soldier’s uniform. Others showed people Credence didn’t know, but suspected were family or friends of the woman.</p><p>The largest frame contained a portrait of the woman he had seen in the other pictures with Gertie. The woman in the picture hardly moved. She blinked and smiled but else did very little. She was so beautiful, Credence thought; she looked like a movie star. Across one of the corners of the frame was a black velvet ribbon and Credence realized with a pang of sadness that the woman must have died.</p><p>“Alice,” Mr. Scamander offered as if reading Credence thoughts. “She and Gertie were… Close.”</p><p>Sadness twisted in Credence. Though there was hardly any family resemblance between the two women, there was something in the familiarity between them that convinced him they were sisters. Credence felt his jaw muscles tense. He too, had lost a sister and though there hadn't been any blood ties or family resemblance between them either, she had still been his sister. Credence looked at the beautiful woman again and she smiled kindly at him. He couldn't help but smile back.</p><p>Mr. Scamander cleared his throat and Credence forced himself to look at the three pictures that made his stomach tie itself into an even harder knot, made his lungs stop breathing and his heart skip a beat. The man he thought he would never see again looked back at him. In one of the pictures he was roaring with laughter, looking a few years younger than Credence, and playing with a happy child Credence realized must be Gertie, another showed a grim-faced, much older version of him, closer to the man Credence had thought he knew. The man in that picture barely moved, but when Credence turned away from it he could have sworn, that out of the corner of his eye,  he saw the man smile and wink at him. The third showed the man sitting in the light of a window; his eyes closed and leaning his head against the wall behind him and Credence realized that the picture had been taken here, in this very room. He looked to the window opposite him and his heart seemed to skip a beat again. He had been here. Not long ago, Credence realized.</p><p>“February 1927,” he whispered to himself as he read the date written in neat hand at the bottom of the picture. The man opened his eyes and smiled shyly at Credence. The man was as impossibly handsome as before but there was a darkness to his eyes now that hadn’t been there the first time Credence had met him. “He was here,” Credence he repeated softly.</p><p>“Yes,” Mr. Scamander said and looked at him from under his unruly fringe of ginger hair.</p><p>“MACUSA suspended him,” the woman’s voice was heard then and Credence startled. She was standing in the doorway, stepping out of the brown overalls. “Well,” she scoffed. “They <em>asked</em> him <em>politely</em> to take some time off, while they tried to sort out how their own security could be breached like that. Incompetent arses, the lot of them,” she muttered and threw the overalls in the air, making them zoom to another room. She wiped her hands across her face and the soot and dirt disappeared and Credence realized she must have used a spell for water, her hands were dripping now and she wiped them off on her pants and green, knitted sweater. “Have ye figured it out yet?” she asked and looked at Credence with a smile.</p><p>“Figured it out?” Credence echoed.</p><p>“He’s me uncle,” she said and grinned before disappearing into another room. “What happened to the kettle, Scamander?” she called, but before he could answer she had returned and a kettle levitated to the fireplace, filling itself with water from thin air as it went. Large cups and tea leaves came zooming by Credence, putting themselves neatly on the table, the tea leaves swirling in the air before falling down into the cups. She pulled a hand through the auburn mess that was her hair and threw herself into one of the armchairs. “Sit down, by all means, Barebone!” she smiled and waved at the other armchair. Credence glanced to Mr. Scamander who nodded as if to tell him it was all right.</p><p>“But there’s only one more armchair,” Credence protested quietly.</p><p>“Merlin’s beard, ye’re right,” the woman laughed and pulled out her wand from an impossibly small pocket in her trousers. She waved it lazily around and one of the cushions from the window leapt into the air, twisting and turning and reshaping itself into a third armchair. Though he had slowly begun to get used to the everyday sort of magic of Mr. Scamander and the occasional spectacular spells, Credence looked at the armchair in amazement.</p><p>“Ye know, ye’re allowed to take yer coats off,” the woman remarked with one bushy eyebrow raised.</p><p>“We shan’t be staying long,” Mr. Scamander tried with a quick glance to his suitcase.</p><p>“Poppycock!” the woman barked merrily. “Stay fer the night, at least! Surely, ye can’t miss their first meal, Scamander,” she added with something in her eyes Credence couldn’t quite place. She reminded him of a cat somehow. He glanced at Mr. Scamander and he could see the curiosity awaken in the magizoologist.</p><p>“All right,” Mr. Scamander said, looking up from under his fringe of unruly hair and taking a small sip from the cup that had gently been nudging his hand. Credence hadn’t even noticed when the tea poured itself. “One night,” Mr. Scamander agreed, his upper lip bending into that small half-smile of his.</p><p>Credence felt a jumble of emotions fighting inside of him. On the one hand he really did look forward to helping out with the dragons, but on the other, the woman reminded him painfully of the man he knew he must forget. And though she seemed all right enough, there was just something about her piercing green eyes that unsettled Credence and he didn’t know what to make of her. He couldn’t grasp her properly and that scared him a little. Reading people’s emotions and anticipating their reactions and states of mind had been his key to survival for so long.</p><p>“Ye had better take that cup before it spills the tea all over you,” the woman laughed then and Credence realized his cup, too, had been nudging at him for quite some time. It seemed to get wilder and wilder the longer he ignored it so he picked it out of the air quickly and took a large sip. It tasted sweet and rich of spices and somehow it made Credence feel a bit more at ease. He put down his cup to shrug out of his coat and scarf but when he had folded them in his lap he felt a bit at a loss for what else to do.</p><p>“Throw them in the air,” the woman said with a mischievous twinkle in her green eyes.</p><p>“I’m sorry?” Credence asked confused.</p><p>“Throw them in the air, Credence,” Mr. Scamander said and flung his peacock blue coat towards the ceiling. The coat immediately zoomed away and out of the sitting room as if someone had used a Summoning charm on it.</p><p>“Go on,” the woman said. “It’ll go straight for the coat hanger in the hallway. I should know, I made the spell up myself,” she added and looked as content as a purring cat. Credence hesitantly thrust his hands out and threw his coat and scarf into the air. For a split second he actually worried it wouldn’t work, or that Gertie and Mr. Scamander were only playing a cruel joke on him and that the coats hadn’t at all gone on their own accord, but by the flick of their wands without Credence noticing. But before the coat had barely left his hands, it zoomed away, followed by the scarf, twirling in the air.</p><p>“Now, I believe I haven’t properly introduced meself,” the woman said then. “Gertie Halloran, pleased to make yer acquaintance, Credence Barebone,” she smiled, baring all of her white teeth. As she got up to shake his hand, she pushed the sleeves of her green sweater up and Credence could tell the markings and letters and images continued all over her arms. He tried very hard not to stare.</p><p>“Mr. Scamander said we were going to Scotland,” Credence said as he shook Gertie’s hand. “But… Miss Gertie, you’re Irish, right?” he said, finally having realized where her soft rolling dialect came from.</p><p>“Well, I’m half and half, really,” Gertie laughed and settled back into her armchair, throwing her legs over one of the armrests. “And don’t call me ‘miss’. Gertie will do just fine.” When he tried to apologize, she just waved a hand to dismiss his stuttering. Credence felt his ears go pink.</p><p>“Me ma was an American witch and me da was an Irish muggle,” she continued. “I was born and raised in Ireland, yes. Thanks to Uncle Perce.”</p><p>“How come?” Credence asked, having a strong feeling of being the only one in the room that didn’t quite understand how it all connected. Mr. Scamander was looking at Gertie with his head tilted and not really meeting her eyes, occasionally glancing about the room or to his case.</p><p>“America has rather conservative laws,” Gertie began with a kind smile.</p><p>“Backwards,” Mr. Scamander added and Credence could hear a tone of irritation to the man’s voice he wasn’t used to hearing.</p><p>“Well. Yeah. America has very backwards laws regarding muggles and wizardkind, ye see. They’re not allowed to associate,” she added after seeing the confusion on Credence’s face. “That means, for example, that muggleborn witches and wizards are whisked off to Ilvermorny, never to see or talk to their family again. It also means that if a witch and a muggle were to fall in love, they wouldn’t be allowed to marry.”</p><p>“That’s horrible,” Credence said and when he stole a glance at Gertie, he felt like she looked right through his condemned soul.</p><p>“Yes. It is. Not all places are like that though. Here in Europe, well, for most places, we do things differently. Marriage is allowed, muggleborn children who attend Hogwarts still get to go home and see their family in the holidays. So. When me mother fell in love with an Irish muggle she met in New York, her rebellious little brother defied their father and helped his sister and her lover elope to Ireland where old Grandfather Graves had no jurisdiction or power. She was already with child when they married and I imagine quite a few charms were cast on the poor priest to make him wed them anyway,” she chuckled. “It was quite the scandal for both muggles and wizardkind involved.” Her eyes glittered mischievously again. </p><p>“That picture there,” she said and waved her hand at the one with the younger man roaring with laughter. “Is the first time I ever met me uncle Perce. See, old Grandad Graves forbade him to come, and he made sure he couldn’t, no Portkeys would be assigned in the name of Graves, the Floo-network wouldn’t connect to me mother’s house. Old Grandad Graves even made sure the entire non-magical american society thought uncle Perce was a dangerous criminal, effectively cutting him off from any sort of muggle transportation. The year uncle Perce turned nineteen, he figured out how to Apparate cross-continental, something only a few have managed before him. So one day, there he was. Splinched half his leg in the process, but there he was.”</p><p>Credence couldn’t help the small smile on his lips and the warmth spreading in his chest. Without even noticing it, he straightened up a little bit more. Ever since Mr. Scamander had found him broken and hurting in an alley, he had slowly, bit by bit, begun to walk with his head a little higher, his shoulders a little less hunched.</p><p>“Do the muggles still think he’s a dangerous criminal?” he asked, the smile widening at the very thought.</p><p>“Merlin, no!” Gertie laughed. “He returned to America with a copy of that picture and supposedly, he Apparated straight into his father’s office, throwing the picture on the desk, saying something very heroic along the lines of his father not being able to stop him anyway now that he knew how to Apparate cross-continental and there was a picture of his granddaughter now. The muggle police issued an official apology for the erroneous charges against him. Somehow, a few weeks after that, any muggle in New York who mentioned the name of Percival Graves would find themselves walking out of alleys and then not remembering why they went in there in the first place.”</p><p>“Mr. Graves did that?” Credence asked incredulously.</p><p>“To tell you the truth, I’m not quite sure,” Gertie smiled but her eyes glittered mischievously. “Between you and me, I think he’s exaggerating a little for the sake of the story. He always had a flare for the dramatic. I mean, just look at him! Have ye seen the coat he’s taken to wearing lately?” she chuckled. Credence couldn’t help his own smile widening and when he stole a glance at Mr. Scamander beside him, he thought he saw even Mr. Scamander giving his half-smile. Gertie cocked her head and studied Credence curiously with those piercing, green eyes.</p><p>“He really did charm you, didn’t he?” she said, seemingly more to herself than to him.</p><p>“Wh-what?” Credence stuttered and felt his cheeks redden and his shoulders cower protectively. Mr. Scamander seemed to have tensed. Credence felt the storm threatening to stir again. <em>How could she possibly know?</em></p><p>“Oh don’t worry, it’s nothing to be ashamed of. He is an old grumpy bastard but he is still dashingly handsome.”</p><p>Credence stole a glance at Gertie and although she was smiling kindly and without the resentment he had expected, he still felt naked, utterly exposed. </p><p>“It’s not a difficult one to figure out, lad,” she said kindly. “Though, admittedly the papers have been unusually quiet about that aspect of the story,” she added, taking a sip of tea from her cup. </p><p>“Gertie, don’t,” Mr. Scamander said softly but the woman seemed to pay him no heed.</p><p>Credence felt the first tell-tale trembles in his body. <em>No, please. No. Not now.</em>He clamped his eyes shut and tried to breathe in through his nose, out through his mouth. <em>In. Out.</em></p><p>“I’ve actually met Grindelwald. I know what he’s like. I know what he’s capable of,” she said with an air of indifference, but underneath all that, Credence sensed something different. “Me uncle may be a grumpy bastard,” she continued like she was talking about the weather, oblivious to the chord of pain she struck within him with her words, “but Grindelwald, he’s heartless. Cruel. He uses people until they no longer serve his purpose and then he disposes of them, discards them like a spoiled child tired of his toys.” </p><p>“And, sweet-talking though that slimebag of a man may be,” she continued and shot Mr. Scamander a look when the redheaded man slowly shook his head at her. “I have a hard time believing he turned up in New York and in less than a day, convinced ye that magic is indeed real and that witches and wizards are not of the Devil and promised ye that ye too could be a part of the magical society if only ye helped him look for a child. See, that doesn’t make any sense,” she carried on, turning her gaze to Credence. “No, dear, ye knew me uncle before that impostor strutted about New York, wearing me uncle’s face and fancy clothes.”</p><p>Credence felt his chest tighten, making it hard to breathe. <em>How could she know? And how, for the love of God, how could she be so casual about it all?</em></p><p>Mr. Scamander cleared his throat and coughed.</p><p>“What?” she snapped, turning to look at him.</p><p>“It’s getting rather late and we’ve traveled quite some way,” he said and Credence had the distinct feeling that wasn't at all what he was actually talking about. Then again, the storm had begun to ring in his ears so he couldn’t tell, really.</p><p>“Fine!” Gertie sighed. “I’ll show ye to the guest rooms,” she added and started to leave the sitting room. She stopped in the doorway to look at him. “I don’t have all night ye know,” she said and inclined her head to the stairs in the hallway. “Come along, Barebone!”</p><p>The sheer obliviousness of the woman brought Credence back to himself so fast his head was spinning. Had she really no idea how close she had been to having an Obscurus unravel in her sitting room? Credence glanced at Mr. Scamander beside him, but he didn’t seem to have noticed either. Credence had to run a few steps before he caught up with Gertie and followed her to the second floor and the guest rooms that were already made up for them.</p>
