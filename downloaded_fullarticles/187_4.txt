    <p>    Harry Potter, the infamous Boy-Who-Lived was standing in front of the large mirror and practicing his facial expressions. He still couldn't understand how people could notice the difference between the expression of fear and sadness. Like, come on, they are so fricking similar!  And plus he was having trouble with happiness. Wtf was this emotion?! It's like you smile but not in a cold and unemotional way like he always did. He had to make it sincere.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>   ' What is sincere anyways? I've never experienced any kind of emotion, so how am I supposed to do this?' he thought relentlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>    "Harry, Dumbledore is here! He is going to teach you some new spells today!" his mother shouted happily from the other room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>    The boy sighed heavily and came to the living room, where the great Dumboldwhore was waiting for him. He didn't care about those stupid spells the old man was teaching him. He didn't care about the war or Voldemort or anything for that matter. He didn't care If he was going to die tomorrow. Everything always was meaningless for him. As Dumbles started explaining some shit to him, Harry silently wondered what would the git do, If he threw a Killing curse at him right now. He was just about to do so when-</p><p>" Mummy, can I go to the Diagon Alley with Sirius?" asked a young plump boy, with reddish hair and brown eyes, his brother, Daniel Potter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>   " Of course, dear," his mummy answered immediately.</p><p>   Then Daniel started annoying him, for some reason his brother always wanted to know where he was going, what he was doing and etc. And he always asked whether he could go with him. The answer always was the same: no.</p><p>    If Harry wasn't a psychopath, then maybe Daniel would have had a different childhood without any trips to Diagon Alley with Sirius. But even though Harry tried to hide his problems, his parents noticed, they noticed it from the very beginning. He never cried as a child, never smiled either, he always looked and behaved differently and his first words were: "Avada Kedavra".<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>   Since the day Harry has got his letter from Hogwarts, he had to train every day, because for some reason the Headmaster believed that Voldemort would try to kill him the moment he was going to set his foot in Hogwarts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>   Just as he sent the third feather flying, Albus-Dumbles suddenly ordered him to stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>" Harry, I have to talk to you about something important. Listen to me, please. It's very serious," he said, staring right into the boy's intoxicatingly green eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>    " Okaaay," Harry agreed hesitantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>    " I've known for a while now," the old coot stated, his voice was calm and relaxed, yet his eyes betrayed him, of course, not that Harry noticed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>    "I'm sorry, Headmaster, I don't know what you are talking about."</p><p>    " You have no emotions or feelings, literally none. I thought Voldemort did something to you but I was wrong. You were born a psychopath. A person incapable of feeling anything, including love and any kind of empathy. Oh, I feel truly sorry for you, my boy."</p><p>     " Don't...Ahhh," the boy yawned. " This conversation bores me."</p><p>    " But you are still the Boy-Who-Lived, you are the child of the prophecy, you have a part of Voldemort's soul inside you...You have to defeat him..., please, I-I promise, it won't be boring."</p><p>     " I have a part of Voldemort's soul inside me? That sounds like a loooooot of fun. I wonder... If the scar connects us, then I must be able to do anything to this piece of his soul inside me... Oh yeahhh...", Harry has already started imagining wonderful things he could do to Voldie's soul when Dumby interrupted his train of thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>     " You need to defeat him, Harry! You ca-"</p><p>     " The only thing I need right now is to fuck a certain Dark Lord inside my head. So, please be so kind to fuck off," he said emotionlessly and went to his room.</p><p>     After 50 minutes of trying to talk to Voldie-Boldie someone knocked on his door. " Come iiiinn," he called lazily. His mother started shouting at him as soon as he opened the door:</p><p>     " Harry, how could you?! And I thought I raised you well! Why did you insult Albus?! He was telling the truth after all and-"</p><p>    " And I don't care. Goodbye, you can kill yourself, If this saddened you so much. I wanna sleep. Hm... And some coffee would be nice too."</p>
