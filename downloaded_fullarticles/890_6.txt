    <p>Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter or Bleach.</p><p>Side Note: italics= thoughts of the character</p><hr/><p>Our story begins in the wonderful and mystical school called Hogwarts, in the class of Gertrude Merriweathing, Hogwarts's conjuring and summoning teacher.</p><p>Mrs. Merriweathing could be described as a squat and round lady that had a stunning resemblance to the Pillsbury Doughboy. She was rarely ever strict with any of her students, whether they be a supposedly evil Slytherin or the occasional dim Hufflepuff.</p><p>Today they were practicing the Transfendio Summossa charm (a.k.a. another confusing Latinish written proper noun) which, allowed wizards/witches to call upon allies in times of need. However, for the first time in 150 years her patience was wearing thin due to two well-known Gryffindors, James Potter and Sirius Black, and the equally infamous Slytherin, Severus Snape.</p><p><em>Why isn't this bloody working!?</em> Was all our favorite potion wiz could think as he repeated the wand motions and the ever confusing incantation indicated upon the board for the seventh time in a row.</p><p>For the love of Merlin! Severus could feel his blood boiling<em>.No, no I can get this. Okay, it's just a flick to the left, a swish to the right annnd.</em></p><p> </p><p>"Hey Prongs, don't look now, but our future Death Eater seems to be struggling!" Sirius whispered loudly to James. Only to once again make the messy haired Seeker chuckle and break Severus' concentration.</p><p>"Now, Padfoot it isn't because he's a Death Eater that is the cause of his struggle." James muttered back to his friend loud enough to make absolutely sure their surrounding classmates were able hear.</p><p>"But, Prongs what other dilemma could there be?" Sirius questioned, going as far as to raise an eyebrow comically.</p><p>"Well, if you knew such a greasy git was summoning you would you appear?" James said, only to receive a chorus of laughter from all the students within earshot. All but, two sensible teens, which were Remus Lupin and Lilly Evans.</p><p><em>Come on, Remus just say," that's not funny.</em>" <em>Just do it</em> "Guys, come on. Look, I'm struggling too" muttered Remus, all the confidence abandoning him exactly when he needed it.</p><p>"Come off it Mooney, besides you know the snake deserves it" James answered back lackadaisically, still basking in the attention he was currently receiving.</p><p>"Yeah, what James said" responded Peter, trying to reinforce his hero's option like an obsessive fangirl.</p><p>Severus could feel his cheeks burning crimson and his head filling with thoughts that would make even the sadistic Dark Lord cringe.</p><p><em>Come on! I need something to wipe that cocky smirk of Potter's bloody face!</em> His wand movements changed from controlled to frantic as his thoughts began to race.</p><p><em>Anything, I mean I'm not asking for a Norwegian Ridgeback but, at least something. Now, this wouldn't be so frustrating if that fat idiot, Peter hadn't been successful in summoning a tiny Flubberworm. I'm better than that pitiful excuse for a Pureblood!</em> Severus thought as his blood pressure seemed to rise to dangerous levels.</p><p>After correcting the wand movements of some random Hufflepuffs did Mrs. Merriweathing seem to notice Mr. Snape's erratic wand swishing.</p><p><em>Maybe it's time to call it a da...wait a minute, isn't that…OH NO!</em> Mentally screamed our ball shaped instructor.</p><p>"Mr. Snape cease what you are doing at once!" screamed Mrs. Merriweathing as she bumbled through the row of desks towards the pale, long haired wizard. However, as all the staff and students know Severus tended to disregard most orders despite the consequences.</p><p><em>I can do this!</em> Snape chanted repeatedly within his mind. His wand movement no longer traceable to the naked eye and seeming to get faster and more chaotic.</p><p>Mrs. Merriweathing kicked it into high gear, her stubby legs waddling up the stairs trying to stop the impending doom bound to arise. "Mr. Snape, if you don't stop...I'll (huff) take 40 poi… (Gasp) points from Slytherin!" Mrs. Merriweathering gasped out, questioning every foolish decisions towards her health.</p><p>Students looked on with awe at the pandemonium occurring, some thinking they were hit with a Confundus hex. Despite her best efforts at defying Newton's law of Gravity she wasn't able to reach Snape before, he had shouted out "TRANSERFERMA SUMMENIOS!" The words echoing in the classroom like one's voice would in a cave or pit.</p><p>Upon hearing this the whole class either ducked under their desks assuming something big was bound to happen or did the Protego spell.</p><p>Fortunately, to all it seemed as if nothing happened except for a deafening silence to hush over the class. It was so silent one could clearly hear the wiggling of Peter's Flubberworm.</p><p>"Classic Snivellus! All bark and no bite!" Sirius gasped through laughter which, strangely resembled barking.</p><p>"Not only did he get the wand movements wrong he also messed up the incantation!" James exclaimed, the words echoing and rebounding throughout the classroom.</p><p>This was immediately followed by the chuckles and unrestricted laughter of the other students/groupies within the class. None seemed to take any notice to the hauntingly fearful gaze of their teacher. Nor the sickly, ash color that had replaced her usually rosy cheeks.</p><p>The laughter continued with no end in sight. "I know, right! I can't believe...Wha?" said James in response to the sudden appearance of white flakes within his unkempt hair.</p><p>"What the hey! What is this? Dandruff?" asked Sirius to no one in particular. This caused the previous silence to return with vengeance except, it was accompanied by a wave of fear and slight disgust.</p><p>"No, it's sand" injected Remus, holding a tiny pile of it within his hand. <em>Granted it's the color of snow</em> Remus thought as he inspected the snow colored sand particles closer.</p><p>"Look!" squeaked a mousy Ravenclaw as she pointed to the ceiling interrupting the long streak of silence. All eyes quickly darted towards the ceiling. Across the ceiling something akin to a rip in the air had appeared.</p><p>It wasn't circular but, had the appearance of what a series of floorboards that had drifted apart would look like. Within the space between the "floorboards" was nothing but, black and the steady flow of sand emptying from wherever it led to or from.</p><p>"Haahaha...kinda looks like...um…yeah." muttered Sirius dumbly, as he and others began to be creeped out.</p><p>"I can't find that shape or the spell within the textbook" said Lily, as she rapidly flipped through the book for info upon what resided over their heads. <em>It's not a portal…well not any shape mentioned within our textbooks. Not even the duds nor the irregularities look close to that thing</em> Lily thought while she continued flipping pages.</p><p><em>Sand…I summoned stupid, bloody, SAND!</em> Severus thought to himself while he basked in the shame, humility and a smidge of self-pity. <em>Once again the bloody Marauders have humiliated me!</em> Severus's thoughts repeated which, caused him to completely ignore the possible danger present since the whole fiasco began.</p><p>Just then a series of screams could be heard approaching at high speeds.</p><p>(To Be Continued….)</p><p>Please don't hesitant to review!</p>
