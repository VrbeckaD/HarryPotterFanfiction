    <p>The streets of Muggle London were bustling with mid-afternoon foot traffic as Draco Malfoy crossed the street making his way to nowhere in particular. It had become something of a habit of his over the last week or so, traversing Muggle London, much to his mother’s immense displeasure.</p>
<p>“Draco really, why are you bothering with the muggles? You could have anything you wanted, go anywhere you please in the wizarding world. What could you possibly hope to find outside it?” <em>Myself, </em>he thought, but never dared say. It wasn’t that he didn’t respect his heritage or his magical upbringing, but as he’d rounded into his mid-twenties, more and more he found himself gathering the attention of the <em>wrong </em>sort of wizards. Wizards who had more interest in cashing in on his family name than they did in actually being with Draco. It was tiresome, and Draco had grown weary of the same old thing and had decided to explore the Muggle side of things. </p>
<p>Several feet ahead of him, Draco noticed a large building, a shopping mall, the Muggles called it. Draco smiled excitedly heading for the entrance without really looking where he was going, when he collided with another person trying to enter the mall, a tall, handsome raven-haired man, with circular glasses, and a thick, black beard. Draco smiled up at him.</p>
<p>“Terribly sorry,” the man said, staring at Draco. For a few brief moments, time seemed to stand still as emerald eyes met grey.</p>
<p>“Quite my fault,” Draco said softly, not wanting to tear his eyes away from the man.</p>
<p>“Oi, get a move on,” shouted a voice from behind them, knocking them out of their trance. The man smiled, holding open the door for Draco. “Thank you,” Draco said, blushing furiously before he walked into the mall, moving confidently as though he knew where he was going. After a few moments wandering, Draco found a store that looked interesting enough, a candle store of all things, and began to look around. There were far more people in the mall than Draco was used to, even on it’s busiest days, Diagon Alley had never been this crowded, it was slightly overwhelming and there was something comfortable about the quiet little candle store with its appealing smells of flowers, and spring rain. Draco was impressed by how the Muggles seemed able to capture such incredible scents all without the use of magic. Lifting up one of the candles, Draco caught sight of the price, £22, Draco frowned trying to properly remember his conversion from Galleons to pounds. Quickly replacing the candle from where he’d picked it up, Draco stepped out of the store, once more colliding with someone.</p>
<p>Strong hands shot out to steady him, as Draco looked up to find the same raven-haired man standing over him, beaming down at him. “Well hello again,” he said.</p>
<p>Draco felt a blush rising from his neck to his cheeks as he stared into the emerald eyes he’d not been able to stop thinking about since they’d first run into one another. “Sorry,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Not at all. You’re more than welcome to run into me, anytime,” he said. Draco felt his face grow even hotter at that, as he nervously moved away from the other man, exiting the candle shop and trying to make his way further into the mall without looking back. He was sure he could feel the eyes of the other man upon him as he walked away. Swallowing a deep breath, Draco paused at a Diamond store in the mall, staring at the display case, he almost wanted to get a diamond bracelet for his mother, but he knew she would hate it. Narcissa had always claimed to be able to tell the difference between Muggle-mined diamonds and Goblin-mined. Something about the quality of Goblin-mined diamonds, Draco opted to skip it, making his way instead, to a busy looking coffee shop with what looked to be a siren for its logo. Draco eyed the logo curiously. <em>Muggles were so strange</em>, he thought, as he got into the queue. <em>Sirens and coffee, </em>Draco shook his head.</p>
<p>As he made his way up to the front of the queue, Draco stared at the number of curious names for coffee drinks, simply blurting out the name of one, a caramel Frappuccino.</p>
<p>“What size?” the woman asked.</p>
<p>“Er… medium?” Draco replied. The woman nodded, shouting something behind her about a grande caramel frap, taking down his name. Draco pulled out his wallet, staring at the golden coins there, <em>surely no one would notice, </em>he thought, wiggling his nose at the coins. Seconds later, the coins vanished and in their place were several crisp bank notes. Draco handed them to the cashier before he moved off to the side to await his drink order.</p>
<p>“Grande Caramel Frap for Draco,” a voice called out a few minutes later. Draco grinned, grabbing his drink from the counter and feeling particularly proud of his ability to get something completely on his own, and <em>mostly </em>without the help of magic. Grabbing a straw, Draco took a sip of his cold drink. It was sweet, deliciously so, with just a hint of coffee. Draco sighed happily, turning around and walking straight into the raven-haired man again, nearly spilling his coffee.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry,” Draco said, staring up at the man. He merely smiled.</p>
<p>“Perhaps we’d better sit down before we have an accident,” the man said. Draco blushed.</p>
<p>“I’d like that.”</p>
<p>“I’m Harry,” said the man, extending his hand out to Draco.</p>
<p>“Draco,” he replied, they shook hands, a warm feeling creeping up Draco’s hand. </p>
<p>“We can go to the food court,” Harry said. Draco stared blankly at Harry for a moment. “Or you know somewhere else if you’d prefer,” Draco shook his head quickly.</p>
<p>“The food court sounds lovely,” he said, though he couldn’t say for certain what exactly such a thing was. Harry led the way and Draco couldn’t help but be grateful as he followed him back down a different direction. Harry seemed to know the mall a lot better than Draco did, turning this way and that so that Draco almost had to run to keep up.</p>
<p>“You’re not from around here are you?” Harry asked, after a moment. Draco frowned a little at that. <em>How could he tell so easily? </em>He wondered.</p>
<p>“What makes you say that?”</p>
<p>“You look very unsure of yourself, yet somehow amazed by the mundane,” Harry said. Draco almost wanted to laugh at that. It was hard to see any of Muggle London as mundane, it was so lively and full of people, and so much different than anything Draco had grown up with.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re not wrong,” he admitted, not entirely sure where to say he was from. America seemed too unbelievable but the Continent wasn’t <em>so </em>far removed that it would make sense for Draco’s wide-eyed wonder at obviously fairly commonplace Muggle things. A moment later, Harry came to a stop outside a chip shop.</p>
<p>“This okay?” Harry asked. Draco nodded, hoping that the conversation about where he was from would be dropped as he allowed Harry to order for him and the two took their seats in the back corner, waiting for their orders to arrive.</p>
<p>“So what do you do for a living?” Draco asked. Harry smiled evidently accepting the change of subject as he unquestioningly went on at length about his job at Scotland Yard. Or at least, that’s what it had sounded like. Draco barely resisted the urge to ask the man why he worked all the way in Scotland, and what a yard had to do with it, but from Harry’s talk, it seemed to be a bit like the Auror Department.</p>
<p>“What about you?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“I’m independently wealthy,” he replied easily. It felt gross to say out loud, however true it was, but Harry didn’t seem particularly bothered by the description.</p>
<p>By the end of the date, Draco found himself standing outside the mall with Harry, as Harry waited for a cab.</p>
<p>“I had a great time,” Harry said.</p>
<p>Draco smiled. “Me too.”</p>
<p>“Could I have your number to call you sometime?” Harry asked. Draco froze. <em>Number? </em>Draco vaguely remembered hearing Muggle’s talking about their mobiles, or otherwise about a phone number, but Draco hadn’t a clue what it meant. Pulling out a card from his back pocket, Draco handed it to Harry, on it, was printed his full name, and a number that, Draco hoped would dial into his floo. Harry stared down at the card, “Draco Malfoy. What a lovely name.”</p>
<p>Draco blushed scarlet as the cab arrived and Harry stepped inside, waving at Draco one last time before the cab took off down the road, disappearing into the sea of traffic. Draco turned on his heel, making his way into an alley, and Disapparated on the spot.</p>
<p>It had taken no small amount of magic on Draco’s part to get his floo connected in such a way as to accept telephone calls but somehow Draco had managed. Shortly before dinnertime, Draco’s floo roared to life, and Harry’s disembodied voice echoed throughout his room.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Hi,” Draco replied, smiling at his floo.</p>
<p>“I thought I should wait a few hours before I called you so I didn’t look <em>completely </em>desperate,” Harry said with a self-deprecating laugh. Draco laughed too.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you did.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“Well we had such a nice date, and if you hadn’t, I might have had to,” Draco said somewhat sheepishly. He could almost <em>hear </em>Harry grin.</p>
<p>“It was really nice wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Best date I’ve had in a while,” Draco admitted. <em>Only date you’ve had in a while, </em>his mind reminded him.</p>
<p>“I’m glad,” Harry said. “I’d love it if we could do this again sometime. Maybe a proper dinner at a sit-down restaurant? You seem like the sort of guy who would appreciate that.” </p>
<p>Draco laughed. “Do I now?”</p>
<p>“You’re very <em>posh,</em>” Harry said.</p>
<p>“You got all that just from our first date?” Harry wasn’t wrong of course, but it was still amusing to hear him say it.</p>
<p>“Well, you <em>did </em>say you were independently wealthy, your last name is French, and you dress incredibly well.”</p>
<p>Draco was blushing now. “I… thank you,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“It took everything in me not to ravish you on the sidewalk before I left,” Harry admitted.</p>
<p>“Oh… my. Why didn’t you?” Draco asked.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t sure it would be welcome,” Harry replied. “Plus, as I said, posh so… I thought perhaps I ought to court your properly.”</p>
<p>Draco smiled at that. “Well don’t you worry, it would definitely be welcome. And there’s no need to court me, that’s all ancient stuff not really done anymore,” he admitted. Draco groaned inwardly at that. Harry merely laughed.</p>
<p>“Duly noted. Maybe I can see you again in a few days?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“I’d love that,” Draco said.</p>
<p>Their second date had turned into three, which had turned into a standing lunch date roughly five days a week while Harry worked, and spending the weekends at Harry’s house in London. Much to Narcissa’s clear annoyance.</p>
<p>“And <em>where</em> have you<em> </em>been all night?” his mother said from the dining room table, idly reading the Prophet as Draco had tried to sneak in at five in the morning on a Monday. <em>Bugger. </em>Draco thought. It had been a few months of this, and thus far Draco had been mostly able to avoid his mother entirely by sneaking back to the Manor just before everyone else would wake up, or so he thought.</p>
<p>“I was with Pansy,” Draco lied.</p>
<p>“Try again,” Narcissa said never looking up from her paper. “I’ve already spoken with Pansy. And Blaise, and Theodore. So I know you weren’t with any of them.” <em>Bugger it all to hell, why did his friends have to be so terrified of his mother? </em>Draco sighed, as Narcissa put down the paper at last. “Draco, if you were with another wizard, you know you can tell me.” It was true, his mother had taken Draco’s coming out remarkably well, but something told her she would take him dating a Muggle remarkably worse.</p>
<p>“I <em>was </em>out with a man,” Draco admitted. “I’ve been seeing him for a few months.”</p>
<p>“There, was that so hard?” Narcissa asked. “What’s the young wizard’s name?”</p>
<p>“Harry,” Draco said quickly, he supposed whatever his mother didn’t know couldn’t hurt him, after all, she had assumed he was a wizard, Draco just hadn’t corrected her. It wasn’t a total lie, just an omission.</p>
<p>“Harry what?”</p>
<p>“Potter,” Draco replied.</p>
<p>“Hmmm. Can’t say I know any Potter’s off hand, though it is a fairly common surname I think. Not a member of the Sacred 28,” It wasn’t a question but Draco shook his head all the same. “Hmm. Pureblood at least?” Draco shook his head again and Narcissa frowned, “Well when do I get to meet him then?”</p>
<p><em>Shite. </em>Why had he thought he could get away without his mother demanding to meet Harry? It was bound to happen eventually, Draco supposed. Even if they had never <em>discussed </em>meeting one another’s parents. Draco knew Harry’s parents lived in Scotland, not far from Hogwarts funnily enough, not that they <em>knew </em>that.</p>
<p>“Well you see,” Draco stammered. “He’s very busy you know.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Is he at least of means?” she asked.</p>
<p>Draco considered this. Harry had an incredible house in Muggle London, it had been gifted to him from his godfather many years ago, but as far as money went it hadn’t exactly come up as such.</p>
<p>“He’s not <em>us </em>rich, but he seems well off enough,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Well darling, few wizards are as well off as <em>us,</em>” Narcissa said. “Still, I think I should meet your young man. Owl him today, invite him for afternoon tea.”</p>
<p>Draco swallowed hard then, he wondered how Harry would react to seeing an owl delivering a letter to him at work.</p>
<p>“That’s a little short notice don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, he can apparate in on his lunch hour I’m sure.”</p>
<p>Draco groaned, he <em>had </em>to do something about this. “He’s not… a wizard,” he said finally. </p>
<p>Narcissa raised an eyebrow at that, “What?”</p>
<p>Draco steeled his resolve, <em>in for a knut, </em>he thought. “He’s not a wizard,” he repeated.</p>
<p>“I see, you’re dating a muggle,” she replied. It was hardly a question but Draco couldn’t help but nod anyway, waiting for the diatribe that never came.</p>
<p>“I take it he’s unaware of your magical upbringing?” Draco snorted, Narcissa <em>knew </em>the answer to that one. The Statute of Secrecy expressly forbid a wizard telling a Muggle about the magical world, until marriage. A foolish law if ever there was one, and yet, Draco was grateful for the excuse to keep things to himself for a little while. “What do you suppose will happen when he learns? Muggle’s aren’t very good with surprises like this,” she said, though there was no hint of malice in her voice.</p>
<p>“If he loves me he won’t care,” Draco said.</p>
<p>At this, Narcissa laughed, “Oh darling, you’ve been reading cousin Samantha’s diary again haven’t you?” she shook her head. “What’s next, giving up your magic for him? You think you can live like a Muggle?” she smirked.</p>
<p>“And why not?” Draco demanded, folding his arms across his chest. He had watched Harry do quite a lot over the past few months, and he was pretty sure he could get the hang of it well enough.</p>
<p>“Doing laundry, making breakfast and tea, all without a house elf? Without magic?” she laughed. “Why on <em>earth </em>would you want to live without it, when Muggles <em>wish </em>they could have it.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think I can do it do you?” Draco demanded.</p>
<p>“You? Draco, please. You wouldn’t last a week living without magic.”</p>
<p>“Is that a challenge?”</p>
<p>“More like a fact darling,” Narcissa said with a smile, “But if you wish to take it as a challenge, by all means. And if you lose, you tell your Muggle boyfriend about your powers, and then when inevitably he takes it badly, you’ll come home,” she said.</p>
<p>Draco glared, “Challenge accepted. But I have no intention of coming home,” he said. “Because Harry won’t care.” Narcissa smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re very confident in this man. I do hope for your sake, you are correct,” she said. Draco turned on his heel and disapparated from the room, determined to learn to do things the Muggle way.</p>
