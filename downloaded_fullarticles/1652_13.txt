    <p>
  <span>Percival Graves did not get paid enough for this shit.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two tours carried out with honor, and the best that the world could manage as payback was a thankless job “molding young lives,” whatever the fuck that meant - in reality, he spent his time shouting out counts for push-ups and scaring the snot out of teenagers who made no secret of the fact that they hated his guts. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Well, he wasn’t there to make friends with a handful of egotistical sixteen year olds, all of that “mentoring” bullshit was never really his thing, and as long as he covered the federal fitness mandates the school board could take his “recalcitrant attitude” and shove it up their lily white country-club fed asses. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But nowhere did the state require that he babysit the waking nightmare that was a public high school locker room. He was going to crack Abernathy like a Rubix cube once that damn suckup got back from New Jersey. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Level Two class was in the middle of the quarterly athletic tests, which, afterward, translated to a lot of bitching and thick globs of sweat streaming from hair-matted armpits. Immature hoots of laughter - like gorillas - bounced off the yellowing tile wall as searing hot water gushed over acne-scarred flesh and wide brown nipples, vanishing eventually into a forest of dark hair over thick shin bones. A few towels were snapped across the unwary. Chimpanzee shrieks echoed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Percival sucked at the dregs of his travel mug, clinging to the forlorn hope that cold coffee might metamorphose into liquor. Planning period be damned, he was heading home as soon as the 9:30 bell rang and continuing the short-term intimate encounter with a half-finished six pack in his fridge. Sera would kill him for ditching so early in the day, leaving administration to carry out a mad scramble to find a substitute on virtually no notice, but she’d been in the habit of forgiving his every transgression since they were both as old as those screeching hyenas in the shower cubicle. Perhaps one day she’d decide his chances had run dry, but he doubted that day would come over one MIA.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The spigots were gradually cranked off, boys climbing out of the slick-tile arena. One of them fell on his square-hanging ass, nearly giving Percival a heart attack until the kid’s fellow neanderthals began snorting out throaty laughter. Towels were whipped off, boxers pulled on.The air thickened with acrid body spray, and Percival leaned back against the vomit-colored locker bank, rolling his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Let them believe the lies a bit longer; that the world gave a fuck about them, and that a single one of their little lives mattered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d just dumped the last of the coffee into a cracked sink when the screaming started.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>*</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Credence Barebone slipped quietly between the rows of beige lockers, a gangly little stork among the apes. A snicker rattled past his ear as he crept towards the shower cube, and he fought the familiar urge to look over his shoulder, to try and understand what he’d done that was so funny. It was impossible to tell; they always laughed, no matter what he did.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It had been a class period much like any other; feeling the stares constantly, hearing the whispers behind hands, always self-conscious of where he stepped, where he looked, what he said or didn’t say - silently praying not to be called on, not to be forced into humiliating himself and doing their work for them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d managed three sit ups in sixty-seconds; an all time low. But at least this time, he’d only been informed that he ate shit or sucked cocks twice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The tile was slippery-wet under his bare feet, as he gingerly unwrapped a threadbare, colorless towel from around sharp-angled hips, glancing carefully around the cubicle, just to be certain. Two apple-red swathes blossomed across his cheekbones, like smears of blood on pallid skin. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As if he were being timed, he cranked the spigot open; scalding water spluttered out of the pipes in a weak dribble, and Credence’s eyes fluttered shut in helpless rapture.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They didn’t have a shower at home, or hot water. Ma said showers were sinful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In moments the white t-shirt on his back - never once removed - was plastered down with moisture, stuck to the knobs of his spine; a grotesque ladder of bumps flanked by chicken-weak ribs. Carefully, hesitantly, he reached for an abandoned brick of medicinal-smelling soap and cradled it just until both palms were slick - memories of past, stinging agony an inescapable deterrent - before delicately slathering himself. Baby-fine hairs were rumpled on both slender thighs, under his fingertips.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>shit </span>
  </em>
  <span>-!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He started at the voice, badly - one shoulder bumped against the tiled wall, water trailing through his feathery black hair and smothering it over his eyelids.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hunnh?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was a high, reflexive sound, and only deepened the ecstatic revulsion etched across Langdon’s ratlike face.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What the fuck </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>that -?!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Credence couldn’t speak, might have spoken, he was only vaguely aware of the nonsensical babbling that escaped his lips, begging and pleas for silence, desistance, to just be left </span>
  <em>
    <span>alone</span>
  </em>
  <span>, which were simply ignored the way they always had been, for as long as he could remember.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What the hell -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lang -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There were faces, others slipping round the dividing wall now, curious as to what the noise could have been about. They craned over each other the same way whenever a fight broke out in the bleachers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Holy </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck-</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” one of them exclaimed, his jaw curling with disgust and the first sucking breath of astonished laughter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One by one they all followed suit, shock, horror, nausea crossing their faces with sudden, abrupt understanding. Had it been any one of </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span>, oh no, that would be different, but this wasn’t one of </span>
  <em>
    <span>them,</span>
  </em>
  <span> one of the guys that mattered, that would be a joke alright, something to holler about in late nights and early mornings over stolen shots of jager, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>this,</span>
  </em>
  <span> this was too fucking perfect -</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was trying to squeeze past them now, trying to hide himself, hide </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>; face to the wall, hunched over, scrawny-stick arms tight around his ribs, then yanking down that fucking stupid shirt he always showered in, even though the collar was worn out and the fabric was stained brown-yellow under the arms, fucking retard, fucking-</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Freak!” came the silently awaited holler from Henry Shaw, and they all laughed - sneering, wild laughter bouncing off the tiles and echoing into infinity - because when Henry spoke, they responded. It was simple. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Credence’s head swam; his guts felt hollow. The cubicle spun, and for a millionth of a second he wondered if he had fainted and managed to escape his long-dreaded nightmare that way, but then came the impact as his head bounced off the wet floor, and he realized - from the residual tingle in his skin - that someone had shoved him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He landed on his back, still begging, that damn shirt bunched up on his chest in a puddle of sodden cloth and exposing the whole fucked up </span>
  <em>
    <span>mess</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Someone made an exaggerated retching noise. A few others guffawed, adding to the quickly growing racket.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Trying to stand, Credence stumbled awkwardly as a sharp twinge shot up his ankle; a hand grabbed him, thick fingers closing over both fragile wrists -</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One of the overhead lights flickered and blew out with a crack. No-one noticed, they couldn’t have heard it anyway.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Could you even jack off with that-?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bet you wouldn’t try and -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, dude - how much’ve you got?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It really wasn’t a big deal, one or two must have told themselves - just another way to fuck the Barebone freak up the fucking ass. Not like he didn’t have it coming. He was annoying as hell. Just another “thing”, like the towering F-A-G written in shit over his second floor locker, or snow and ice shoved down his throat in the parking lot, or the crumpled, unwrapped condoms - like shriveled up ballsacks - stuffed into the outer pocket of his retarded, hand-sewn backpack, or every single “too bad your mom didn’t have an abortion so we wouldn’t have to look at your fucking face.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just joking around.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It must have stuck in their minds, like a shield of protection, a charm of sorts, reassuring them they weren’t doing anything that anyone else wouldn’t do, when Henry pulled a proudly emblazoned, US army knife from the pocket of his unzipped jeans.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They shoulda just cut it off when they fucked it up -!” he sneered, flipping the blade open from it’s casing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Their self-confidence - born solely from being someone other than the fag they had pinned on the floor - was still holding up, when all at once, Credence began thrashing and twisting in their ape-like hands, and started to scream. His eyes rolled in his head, mindlessly begging it seemed, words like “stop” and “please” and “help” just distinguishable through the hysterical shrieking.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Several of the donkey grins around the shower faltered, just a little.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were still laughing, when Mr. Graves shouldered them out of the way.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>* </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It took Percival about five seconds to understand what he was seeing, and roughly another five to believe it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sure, that weird Barebone kid had always been the scapegoat - there was </span>
  <em>
    <span>one</span>
  </em>
  <span>, invariably - but this went a little beyond tripping him up on the running track or “accidentally” shoving him into the volleyball net: there were smears of blood on his curled thighs, where Henry’s knife had nicked him. He was still screaming, as if he were being gutted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uh-oh -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wha-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh shit -” came a mutter from Terrance Rowle, a blonde, twelfth grade boy built like a goddamn trucker, his blue eyes widening in quickly perceptible fear. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Percival didn’t have much time to enjoy the obvious effect that his months of self-vilification had elicited, before the kid frantically wriggled free of his tormentors and curled into a sopping wet ball in the corner of the shower, quivering with every hysterical sob.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For one embarrassing second there was dead silence, broken only by his whimpering, until Percival realized that he was unfortunately still on the clock.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright…” he muttered uncomfortably - this was out of his depth, Abernathy was going to pay in </span>
  <em>
    <span>blood</span>
  </em>
  <span> for making him deal with this shit -</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright - Clarence - get it together -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He reached for the kid’s shoulder, and it was like touching a live cable; one earsplitting screech before the boy huddled up even tighter, shaking his head wildly, bleating something too garbled to understand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“C’mon -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Kneeling now, he pulled him upright - contact prohibition laws be damned - gaze travelling brusquely from his snot-covered, wailing face to the drops of blood on his leg, and… what the…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy was hyperventilating now, gasping for breath around each maddened noise. Percival’s ears were ringing, and in a sudden attack of frustration he slapped him sharply across the cheek.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His knuckles came away sticky, but the kid stopped bawling, staring up at him and blinking like a fish.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“M-M-Mr. Gr-Gr-Gra-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Someone behind them tittered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were actually finding the situation funny, crowding around like gawkers at a house fire, and for a moment Percival stunned himself when the sheer, unguarded truth of how much he </span>
  <em>
    <span>hated </span>
  </em>
  <span>every single one of those pampered little bastards bled through from his subconsciousness.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fission reached: Explosion.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“OUT! GET THE </span>
  <em>
    <span>FUCK </span>
  </em>
  <span>OUT!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That seemed to pull them up short, all suddenly stunned into silence. “Fuck,” that ugly coarse word, used in the hallowed halls of learning? What a thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Langdon Shaw tucked an iPhone into his back pocket.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>What </span>
  </em>
  <span>did you not understand?! I said GET! OUT!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Slowly, stupidly as cattle, they went, leaving Percival alone with the (now mercifully silent) weeping boy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was shaking, just slightly, his own groin tightening up a bit in sympathy as he carefully pushed the kid back into a sitting position against the wall, and eased his thighs a few inches apart. Evidently undone past resistance, he let himself be moved around like a doll, still crying. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Some of the blood that had apparently been drawn while he was struggling had smeared across his groin, and for a fraction of a second Percival was stuck between wild confusion and nauseated horror, wondering if he’d actually been landed with a group of kids who were that sick, who would actually chop off someone’s -</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>No. They hadn’t. But someone else had obviously tried.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d seen guys, boys, who’d been cut, some who’d clearly had the benefit of expensive, better trained pediatric surgeons versus the others, but this…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A long scar went raggedly up the length of the shaft, where flesh and muscle had been hacked into and torn away with the excess skin. A too-deep ridge surrounded the glans, and the upper quarter of the pale pink head was simply gone altogether, replaced with a rough, ridged pad of scar tissue.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The only word possible was mutilation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who the hell did this to you?” Percival finally asked softly, too taken aback for any of his usual acerbic harshness.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Whimpering, the boy shook his head even more frantically, and refused to meet his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Clar -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“THAT’S NOT MY NAME!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>he screamed abruptly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The water dispenser in the corner - an aged, molded thing that had been urinated into countless times - suddenly exploded in a shower of liquid and shards of blue plastic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Startled, Percival shook himself and turned back to the kid in front of him. After a hour like this shitshow, his brain could play any number of tricks on him. Anyway, damn place was crumbling in on itself…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“C’mon…” he mumbled, grasping his upper arms and pulling him to his feet carefully. “C’mon, let’s get you cleaned up…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>*</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The second period late bell rang about two minutes after Sera ushered them into her office, brows knitted beneath her artfully streaked hair.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is this a disciplinary problem or an incident report?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Percival braced both hands on his hips, groaning uneasily while Credence (Credence! Holy shit, the kid was better off with some trainwreck like “Clarence”) shrank down into one of the brown leather chairs in front of the desk, clearly intent on making himself as small as possible.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Neither, maybe… maybe both, I, uh, I wasn’t sure how to…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He broke off, coming to a quick realization that evasion wouldn’t get them anywhere.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Anyway, he needs to go home early - rough day.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sera opened her mouth briefly, as if about to protest, but caught the warning look in his eye - one she’d been amply familiar with since their junior year of high school, and Percival had rushed her from the house the instant his father’s car headlights appeared outside the window.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One french manicured finger hit the intercom on her desk, and while she asked the secretary for a dismissal form, Percival got on his knee beside Credence’s chair.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was still damp-cheeked and his chin was wobbling, hinting at another crying jag in the near future.  Ultimately, it had taken well over ten minutes to calm him down, while Percival - in a rare show of compassion - gave his face a firm rubdown with a dry towel to bring some of his color back, before helping him stuff trembly, fawn-like limbs into his clothes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Some deep, twisted part of himself that he didn’t want to acknowledge whispered cruelly that if he hadn’t seen the whole atrocious incident with his own eyes, he might have dismissed him as another too-modest little wimp - the loose white button down and ugly, badly-fitted khaki trousers held up with bracers completed the stereotype but to perfection, and the silver crucifix displayed blatantly around his neck didn’t help.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Somehow, he doubted any of it was the kid’s decision. Heartbreak leaves a very clear impression, and it was already stamped indelibly into Credence’s brown eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Look, um - ‘M sorry about the smack, I could’ve thought that through more..”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Credence kept his gaze - wide, shell-shocked - fixed firmly on the ugly grey carpet, hands squeezing at his ribs like a shield.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, uh…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Self-shame was doing an ugly battle with conscience in Percival’s chest, eventually manifesting itself into an awkward cough while he scrubbed a hand through his unwashed hair.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“- Don’t worry about coming to the gym for the rest of the week, we’ll, uh - we’ll work something out.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sera added her signature to the yellow dismissal slip with the usual aggressive flourish, and slid it across the desk.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just take that to Ms. Walthers out front - she’ll give your mother a call.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was like flicking a switch on an electric chair - Credence’s head shot up, his eyes coming into terrible focus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What -?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sera sighed again, and Percival could already tell from experience that she was struggling not to rub her temples.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s the school policy - we’ll need to call your mom and -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No - no no no…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For a moment it looked like he might vomit or faint, and the suspicion already seeded in Percival’s mind began to grow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can see you’re upset, but this isn’t optional -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“NO!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>he shrieked suddenly, just as the chic glass clock perched on the desk seemed to throw itself off the surface and shatter across the floor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Flushing, horrified, he jumped up from the chair as if something had burned him and raced back out to the main office.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Let him go,” Sera muttered quietly, finally standing and coming around the desk. “All the main doors are locked anyway - he probably just needs some time to himself.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She plucked a clean sheet of paper from the printer drawer and began delicately sweeping up the broken shards of glass with a sapphire blue ballpoint pen. Once everything had been disposed of cleanly in the dustbin and she’d begun nursing a nicked finger, Sera finally glanced up at him, her expression betraying the full extent of her exasperation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Percy, what the hell is this all about?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Someone botched a circumcision on him.” he muttered, bluntly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her face paled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I-I don’t see why…?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re talking </span>
  <em>
    <span>deformity</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Sera, I - some of the others must’ve caught a glimpse and decided to give him crap.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She sighed, eyes fluttering shut.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There’s not much I can do with ‘must’ve’ Perce, you know that -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You didn’t see him in there - he was shaking, screaming, his eyes were rolling around - I’ve only ever seen advanced combat vets display those kinds of symptoms, flashbacks to civilian bombings, limbs being blown off -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What did you say the last name was? Barebone?” Sera awkwardly shuffled around a paper or two.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, but -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, that explains some things… she’s the nut who went on the warpath about a year ago over the Anthropology class; something about how Satan would claim us for doubting the Lord… there were rumors though, before your time, things that...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She paused, suckling her wounded finger a moment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you have names at least, for the… incident?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Both the Shaw brothers, as usual. And their goon squad.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Christ have mercy…” Sera groaned. “Have you spoken to them?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Honestly, I just wanted them out of there - couldn’t stand to look at their faces anymore, not while he was that fucking hysterical -” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, without a complainant pointing the finger, my hands are tied, but… look, if I let you -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll deal with it. Rip them down one side and up the other.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Picquery sighed heavily.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Percy, please - you don’t need another probationary period on your record, not this late into the semester -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“‘Appreciate the concern, but this job isn’t worth saving with a blind eye. You can tell me off later.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He turned and left without a by-your-leave. Sera’s eyes fixed on the aged scar half-hidden by the strap of his tank top as he closed the door.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The things we do for love.” she mumbled under her breath, before buzzing a secretary to pick up the still abandoned dismissal form.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>*</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lectures and half-hearted classwork droned behind closed doors down the hallway, while Credence sat quite still on the varnished oak bench near the visitor’s entrance. A death row guard would have recognized his expression. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two boys in the opposite seats were snickering, and one of them hissed to grab his attention before miming something obscene, his tongue moving in his cheek.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Credence flinched, and turned his focus back to the speckled floor tiles. If he concentrated enough, he could almost see shapes in them. A piece of dried chewing gum was smeared next to his shoe.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was the little things he’d taught himself to notice, the empty candy wrappers and lost pencils abandoned in the hallway and senseless, indistinguishable graffiti etched into the cinderblock walls. The little sadnesses of life that took his mind away from other, greater sorrows.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ma told him constantly that the Day of Judgement was coming, that not a moment could be wasted in preparing to be taken up, to make himself one of the worthy ones; all the others, the grinning, cackling children that pointed and jeered, He would smite them down, there would be an angel with a flaming sword…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Those thoughts had been a comfort once, when Credence was very small, but as he grew, and the tolerance of those around him for anything different shrank into obscurity, he couldn’t help feeling that he’d much rather enjoy what this life had to offer, instead of readying himself for the next one.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Besides, if the angel was going to turn up, surely he would have by now.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He’d tried to fit in, tried to un-become the freak. He hadn’t gotten on his knees to pray in public since third grade, when Ma had been forced to stop homeschooling him. By the end of the first day, he knew better. He tried to cover up the agony and laugh with them, whenever the joke was on him (and it always was.) A million tiny little disobediences, all of them worthless. Once you had been labeled the outcast, there was no salvation from the pit.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wouldn’t even have showered at school, any time or day, would have taken the half-credit for the day rather than risk exposing that horrible, horrible secret, but he’d hoped in a weak, forlorn way, that perhaps sharing in that shameful ritual, groaning whenever Mr. Abernathy blew that plastic whistle and pointed them towards the shower block, perhaps that could have deteriorated the walls surrounding him just a little.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But today… oh Lord, why today?...</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Credence had been a little frightened of Mr. Graves ever since he’d seen the man from across the gym for the first time, and gave silent thanks that he’d been placed in the much smaller, jumpier Mr. Abernathy’s class. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If his own teacher were a pecking seagull, Mr. Graves was a tiger - strong, slow moving, often benign but quick to anger, and when that happened… Credence shuddered to imagine it. The almighty descending from Sinai, beautiful and terrible surrounded with blazing fire…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He gasped a little at his own blasphemy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Class had been humiliating enough, showing himself as a weak, worthless thing in front of not just the usual snickering carnival, but that dark-eyed, firm jawed man, with hands that could crush the wicked and a smooth, heavy voice that shouted and terrified him…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And afterward… oh why, </span>
  <em>
    <span>why </span>
  </em>
  <span>did he have to have seen</span>
  <em>
    <span>?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bell clanged over the speaker system, drawing hundreds of teenagers from the classrooms in droves, but it was the unmistakable scent of talcum powder and sweat that drew Credence’s gaze up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ma always wore the same black clogs over wrinkled, drooping nylons, and as the enormous shoes - drowning her tiny feet - came to a pause in front of the bench, Credence felt something in his belly quiver.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was drawing eyes and whispers, standing there in her black cotton dress that hung like a sack, the gigantic black satchel purse and King James bible (covered in black) under her arm, the fuzzy, xeroxed tracts of Jack Chick comics - Ma seemed to believe it was the best way to reach children - clutched in the bony hand that wasn’t currently reaching out to grasp his arm. She didn’t notice how people stared at her, she never noticed. She had had torn herself free of shame long ago, knowing she was the messenger of Truth. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Let’s go home now.” she murmured, in her fragile, pretty voice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Helpless, Credence stood and allowed her to lead him out through the current of gawkers, out to the parking lot. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was only when they were trundling down the back road in the old woodgrain station wagon, a little silver, looped fish ornamenting the trunk hatch, that he finally managed to speak, weakly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“...I’m sorry you had to come to school, Ma.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She didn’t reply.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Credence swallowed, tracing one fingertip along the car seat, the beige felt flattened and shiny with age.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He didn’t know how much the office had told her, what they had said to her, and the dread was beginning to cramp his insides up like a knot. Sometimes he wished she’d scold, shout at him in front of the school doors like he’d seen other mothers do whenever they’d been called fetch their sons - then at least, he’d know what she was thinking.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gravel crunched under the thin wheels as they pulled into the car port, and Ma breathed in deeply as she cut off the ignition.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Let’s go inside.” she muttered. “We’ll go inside and pray.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Credence choked on a whimper.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They laughed at me, Ma.” he half-whispered, trembling. “I - I thought they were going to -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>To do what you did. Do more than you did, he couldn’t manage to say.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ma didn’t say a word, as usual - her blue eyes focused directly in front of her, unblinking.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’ll talk about this inside, Credence.” she murmured softly, climbing out of the car.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a sudden burst of courage he never would have thought he possessed, he jumped out of his seat just as she reached the whitewashed steps to the front porch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, Ma, I - I wanna talk about it here, I - I don’t wanna go inside with you…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His voice faltered at the last, while her frigid stare chilled him through to the bone, and he immediately felt a sickening churning in his gut.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That one spark of defiance would cost him dearly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Broken down, subdued, Credence shut the car door and followed her silently up the steps and into the small brick house.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Light never seeped through into the dingy rooms, partly because Ma kept the windows covered up with thick yellow curtains, and partly because electricity in abundance was sinful. Two rattan chairs stood sentry by a folded futon with a lumpy, orange mattress, a thick-framed engraving of the ten commandments in silver hanging on the wall behind.  Dust clung to every corner and edge, to the heavy sewing table in the corner where Ma made all their clothes, across the green linolieum tile in the kitchen and the knobs of the gas stove. Everything heavy, thick, and ugly, and God’s face watching from every wall and over every doorway. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ma set her purse down on the salmon-plastic table in the kitchen, her every breath whistling.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Go to the altar.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ma…” his voice quavered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Go to the altar and pray.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ma… it wasn’t my fault -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Go to the altar and pray for forgiveness.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Please -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Pain exploded across his scalp, throbbing in his skull and blinding him for a moment, and it wasn’t until he saw the black cover multiplied fuzzily against the hooked rug, a threadbare thing depicting Eve and the serpent, that he realized she’d struck him with her bible.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was crying by the time she had pulled him in front of a card table opposite the futon, shoving him to his knees. The rice scattered across the floor dug through his trouser legs and straight into bruised skin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The Sun was risen upon the Earth when Lot entered Zoar…” Ma crooned, immovable. “And the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A sob ripped free of Credence’s strained throat as she yanked his head back, fingers knotting tightly in his hair. Both eyes were forced directly in line with the head of the altar - the wooden cross atop a gleaming white cloth, two candles in silver holders. Behind the cross hung two rummage sale Lovis Corinth posters on glossy paper; his </span>
  <em>
    <span>Large Martyrdom </span>
  </em>
  <span>and </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Temptation of Saint Anthony. </span>
  </em>
  <span>A twisted rictus of blood, torture, and cruel faces - thick, wobbling thighs and buttocks, faces that were even crueler.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“For know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God - Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Please, stop-!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Pray now - pray for His forgiveness, that the sin of Lust may be washed away-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t sin, Ma!” he shrieked, struggling under her deceptively small hands. “I couldn’t - there were too many - I -!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“- You brought the Lord’s vengeance upon yourself…” she whispered, her lips drawn thin across her teeth. “I washed you clean; I made you pure. And you cavorted yourself among them, wicked, tempting -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No-! </span>
  <em>
    <span>You hurt me, Ma! </span>
  </em>
  <span>You hurt me, and they all laughed! I didn’t sin - </span>
  <em>
    <span>you sinned!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She sucked in a breath, her eyes fluttering shut as if in horror. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh God…” she moaned quietly. “Oh, show this devilspawn the error of his ways, that this is your loving, vengeful hand at work -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His head smacked the edge of the table as she pushed him down into a humble posture. He sagged in her grip, dazed, her frenzied, mumbled prayers a buzzing in his ears, and finally he did pray, prayed silently for it all to just </span>
  <em>
    <span>stop</span>
  </em>
  <span>...</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Credence couldn’t be certain if the prayer were answered, or if his body merely gave out under the stress, but mercifully everything faded away.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>*</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>It was a light, warm day in the center of July mugginess, and Miss Goldstein was sunbathing again. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>She had on a tiny bathing suit - pink, like melted peppermint candy - that showed her stomach and the tops of her breasts, and every inch of her skin glistened with suntan lotion.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Ma hated Miss Goldstein’s bathing suits. She called her a whore of Satan. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Credence thought she looked beautiful.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The fence slats creaked a bit as he leaned against them, one small arm cradling a ratty felt lamb as he looked curiously into the Goldsteins’ yard. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Miss Goldstein murmured softly as she turned towards the noise, and she squeaked when she saw him. She pushed up her sunglasses - big, purple, and covered in sparkly sequins - before tightening the laces behind her neck with a pretty grin.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“You scared me, honey!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Credence blushed guiltily, and cuddled his lamb closer. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>It was old and there were stains on it’s wool; some stuffing had started to come out and one of it’s button eyes drooped, making it look sad on one side. Credence didn’t like looking at the sad side, because then it looked like someone had hurt the lamb, and that hurt to think about. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Credence didn’t like hurting.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Miss Goldstein was standing up then, coming over to the fence. She had long, white legs - pretty legs, he decided, and there was a freckle on one of them just above her knee…</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He hadn’t understood for a long time why some ladies didn’t wear as many clothes as Ma did, until she explained that all those other ladies were going to Hell. He was sorry for that. Miss Goldstein was so nice - she’d brought them soup once, when he was sick, but Ma wouldn’t let her in the house.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>She knelt down, so that they were eye to eye, and smiled at him, nodding towards his lamb.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Who’s your friend?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He was still chewing on his dry lower lip, wondering if he should answer, when the screen door clattered shut behind him, and he already knew Ma was there, on the porch, knew she had seen him…</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Credence…” came a low, terrible hiss from the doorway, and his face crumpled before he could help it, his throat closing up, because he’d disobeyed again, and that meant he’d sinned, and Ma would scourge him -</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Credence, what have I told you?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Ma never raised her voice once, and somehow that made it so much worse, worse than if she had screamed and bayed and roared at him.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He whimpered softly.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Get in this house, now.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“There’s nothing to get upset over, Mrs. Barebone, we were just saying hello…” Miss Goldstein was saying, weakly, but it made no difference to the way Ma strode down from the door and grasped Credence’s arm hard enough that he could feel the bones pinch together. He cried out, but Ma didn’t look back while she dragged him back towards the house.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don’t you touch him like that!” a new voice suddenly shouted from across the lawn, as the other Miss Goldstein - her sister, the one with dark hair and denim shorts who always looked angry when he and Ma walked down the street - running from their back door to the fence. “You should be ashamed of yourself-!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Ma turned and looked back at them, and her eyes almost seemed to glow, in that awful way that gave Credence bad dreams at night.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Whores.” she whispered, just loud enough for them to hear, and she was just pulling him through the door, ignoring his tears, when something heavy smashed against the tin porch roof. It made a loud noise, like the time he had dropped the cutlery sorter on the kitchen tile, and they all jumped, but then another crash came, higher up, and then another, and another, before a white chunk of </span>
  </em>
  <span>something </span>
  <em>
    <span>hurtled down and burrowed into the lawn.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>It was ice.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Ma went very pale, staring at him as if he had changed into something ugly and terrible right in front of her.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Sin!” she muttered. “Oh, Sin!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Then she had snatched him up, and he screamed, frightened because everything was moving too fast and he couldn’t see where they were going, what was happening, and the ice was still smashing against the roof and the walls of the house, faster and harder with every second, like it could break right in - </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Credence felt his back hit something hard, and suddenly he recognized the dark wooden blades of the ceiling fan and realized they were in the living room, he was lying on the altar, and there was something on his wrists, something thick and tight, and he couldn’t move - </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He cried harder. He’d dropped his lamb outside.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Ma was praying, shaky and excited; “Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire…”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Something gleamed in her hand; the big kitchen knife that Credence wasn’t allowed to touch, laid on the altar cloth beside him...</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>She pulled his clothes down and up, until he felt warm, summer air on his belly, his shirt pushed over his face so that he couldn’t see - he cried harder than ever, frightened, and then… then… then… </span>
