    <p>10 July<br/>Dear Harry and Ron,</p><p>I'm settling in well back at Hogwarts. It's a bit strange to be here again, but I'm excited about this internship. The staff is thrilled to have me back - yes, all of them - and I'm slowly getting used to eating at the head table and calling everyone by their first names. Poppy promises that we'll begin work tomorrow, so I should not stay up too late writing this.</p><p>Work over the summer consists of doing inventory and restocking, updating and reorganizing records, staff physicals, and whatever may come up. Poppy assures me that the summer is an excellent time to ease into the work but will not be boring by any means. There are always hangovers, minor sprains, sunburns, and at least one exploding experiment over the summer. There is apparently something of a bell curve health-wise among the staff. The youngest and oldest always have something wrong with them, while the middle-aged are healthy as horses. I suspect I will be discovering much about the activities of the staff that we never dreamed as students. I have already spotted clotheslines strung out of windows that contain what seem to be bathing suits. Suddenly my wardrobe seems much too formal.</p><p>Love,<br/>Hermione</p>
