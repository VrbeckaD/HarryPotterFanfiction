    <p>George did not think he'd had a single epiphany in his entire life before Fred went and got himself bloody killed. Everything in their lives up until that moment had seemed like it was flowing to their natural destiny—from Hogwarts' prankster kings to Quidditch gods to successful entrepreneurs. Sure, there was a lot of damn hard work that went into it, but no denying that it was all there for Fred and George's taking. It never occurred to either of them that fate might have a cruel side, or that she could deal a bad hand to her favorite devils.</p><p>The first month after Fred died was a bit of a blur. Well, to be honest, that whole summer was a massive black spot in George's memory, with the exception of a few moments that flared to relief in his mind, brighter for being set against so much darkness.</p><p>The first had come one month after the damned Battle when Angelina finally got her very fine, but truant arse out to the Burrow. George could remember being vaguely angry with her, but mostly he remembered lying in her arms and having Epiphany No. 1: he wanted to try.</p><p>Prior to that, George had been keeping his options open. For one very short, and very scary moment, death had seemed a good option, but that idea had gotten the heave ho with alacrity. George Weasley did not commit suicide. He may very well be done in by one of his own inventions someday, but it wouldn't be on purpose. Alcoholism seemed a pretty decent option. It was one he'd tried out a few times, and one that still haunted him as a possibility. Really, in that month after Fred died, all George wanted was to spend the rest of his life lying in his bed and not existing.</p><p>It was about that point when Angelina showed up. She made him laugh. She took none of his shite. And when he was in her arms, George realized that he wanted to try to figure out how to live this new life that he never wanted—never even contemplated—but was saddled with all the same. He'd survived the bloody war when Fred had died. It was George's duty to live a good life for his twin, but he also wanted to do it for Mum and Dad, and his brothers and Ginny, and his friends and Angelina. But mostly he wanted to do it for himself. George was many things, but quitter wasn't one of them. He wasn't going to quit on his life, and that meant he couldn't quit on the dream he and Fred had shared.</p><p>What followed was the hardest, and loneliest, year of George's life. Yet he made it through, maybe a little worse for the wear, but in one piece all the same. Once he got his first lone birthday and the anniversary of the Battle behind him, George's life plodded on in the same singular direction until Epiphany No. 2.</p><p>The Holyhead Harpies were having a good year. George should know, he'd gone to enough games that the wizard at the gate knew him by name. The whole season came down to the last match. Win it, and they would play in the semi-finals. Lose it, they would go home and try again next year. George was in the stands with Lee and Alicia. Katie couldn't make it. Some tosh about her husband playing the same night in Puddlemere. Honestly, where were the girl's loyalties? Anyway, since Katie was off playing wifey, George bullied his baby brother into coming along. It was a banging good game. The four of them stood in the stands, cheering until they were hoarse.</p><p>Eight hours into the game, with the stars twinkling against an early summer sky, Angelina scored in the same precise instant that the Harpies's Seeker caught the Snitch. One moment, Angelina's face was set in that fierce, all-business mask George knew so well. Then in the next, her eyebrows sprang high on her forehead and a smile broke across her face. She was sweaty, and her hair was in a ponytail, but damn Angelina Johnson was radiant.</p><p>George hadn't been able to take his eyes off of her. Angelina was strong, but she wasn't particularly stoic. She was beautiful in all of her emotions, but none were as vibrant as Angelina in victory. Spinning her broomstick in circles, ascending high above the crowd, she was quite simply the most alive being George had ever seen.</p><p>And in that moment, George knew he wanted to do more than try. He wanted to live a full life. He wanted more than carrying on the dreams he made with Fred. George wanted to live his own dream. Namely, he wanted to be with Angelina. It wasn't even a new dream. This was something he'd wanted for so long, he couldn't even remember when it began. All he had to do was somehow trick Angelina into agreeing.</p><p>Not that anything that followed Epiphany No. 2 was simple or straightforward. First, he had to survive what he would forever remember as the single most bloody mental summer of his life. It would involve his horny younger brother, Luna Lovegood, a good-for-nothing Slytherin, a lot of sex, and some of the most humiliating moments of George's entire life. So, he reckoned it all began the Sunday after that fateful game, when he went around the Burrow for dinner and ended up with a roommate.</p><p>oOo</p><p>"Dinner was great as usual, Mum," Ron said, as he pushed his plate away from him. It was, by George's count, Ron's fifths.</p><p>"Thank you, dear," Mum said, smiling.</p><p>"You worked so hard, you deserve a break. George and I will just clean up then."</p><p>George might only have one ear, but he distinctly heard his ruddy little brother volunteering him for dishes. This was the time of day when George weaseled himself out of clean up with some invented excuse or another. It was all a part of the tradition, and George did not like Ron spoiling his fun.</p><p>"Oi, speak for yourself," George grumbled. "I'm needed at the shop."</p><p>"Whatever for?" Bill asked as he stood from his chair and offered a hand to his wife. "You're closed on Sundays."</p><p>"What better time is there to do inventory?"</p><p>"I did your inventory last month," Percy said.</p><p>"And you can't tell me Percy wasn't thorough," Audrey put in with a dimpled smile.</p><p>George felt his ear burn red. Dammit, there was that sly look in Audrey's eyes as she placed her hand on Percy's lower back. She always had a way of making it sound like she was talking about the Prat's performance in bed, and it was damned uncomfortable. The last thing George wanted to picture was Percy shagging his girlfriend. Fit little bird that she was.</p><p>"The books, then," George said, tugging on his collar.</p><p>"And since when have you done your own books?" Bill said and slapped George on the back as he left the table. "If you've developed a head for maths, I'll gladly relinquish those to you."</p><p>"Thank you, boys, for volunteering," Mum said, clearly ending any of George's attempts at escape.</p><p>When everybody else had scarpered, George flicked Ron with a towel.</p><p>"Ow!"</p><p>"Bloody dishes!" George snapped. "Are you effing mental?"</p><p>"Look, George, I wanted to have a word with you. You know, just the two of us."</p><p>"And we couldn't have done that while hiding from Mum in the broom shed?"</p><p>"Fine!" Ron huffed. "I'll do the cleaning—"</p><p>"Damn straight!"</p><p>"Just hear me out, will you?"</p><p>"I'm all ear."</p><p>
  <em>Bloody ear humor.</em>
</p><p>George tipped back in his chair, picturing his twin shaking his head in dismay over the lame joke. Of all people, Fred had been uncharacteristically sensitive about the whole ear thing. He acted as if all George's attempts at poking fun at it were pathetic, but George reckoned that Fred was genuinely upset. Sure, it was George who was left maimed, but one stroke of bad luck had made them not-so-identical twins. Of course, another stroke of bad luck would leave them not twins at all.</p><p>"Look, George," Ron started as he cleared plates. "Hermione's graduating in a couple of weeks."</p><p>"Yeah, so is our sister. You remember her? About yay-high, red hair, bigger bollocks than you. We call her Ginny."</p><p>Ron looked at George as if he were having serious second thoughts, but must have decided it was worth it because he carried on.</p><p>"Anyway, Hermione's going to live with her parents over the summer. You know, trying to make up for lost time. And I live here, which always seemed temporary, but I'm still in Auror training and the pay's not that good. I thought about me and Harry living together, you know, but Harry's pretty chuffed to live on his own for the first time…and well, him and Ginny…ugh!"</p><p>"Eloquent," George deadpanned. Although, if pressed, he would have to admit that "him and Ginny…ugh" was a pretty astute observation on the subject of their baby sister shagging the Chosen One.</p><p>"Well, I just thought, you have that second bedroom…"</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>"I know it was Fred's. If-if you're not ready to have somebody move into Fred's bedroom, I understand, but I just thought we could be…roommates."</p><p>All four legs of the chair banged to the floor. George eyed his brother for a long moment.</p><p>"Let me get this straight," George said. "You want to move into Fred's room so that you can shag your girlfriend without any parents around?"</p><p>"No? Well, that isn't the only reason."</p><p>George took a moment to consider this request. In part, to see Ron squirm, but also because he really needed a second to process this. George had been in Fred's room since he died, but mostly it had stayed closed up with all of Fred's things and dirty laundry. Still, if George wanted to move on, didn't he need to deal with Fred's things? Maybe stop thinking of a room where Fred had done little more than sleep and take the occasional date as off limits?</p><p>"Yeah, okay," George grunted.</p><p>He got up and went outside. He didn't stop until he was in his shop. Anyway, that was the story of how George ended up with a roommate.</p><p>oOo</p><p>As for Angelina, she had never thought much about epiphanies. She was much too practical for the whims of fate and sudden, magical realizations. Even as a third year, Angelina had known that an easy mark was not worth the twaddle of false magic that was Divination. Never mind that her own mother, and even Muggle granny, were massive champions of the so called art.</p><p>Two days after George got himself a roommate, Angelina's teammates were dragging her out for a pre-match kip to the pub to cool their nerves. The next day was the semi-finals, and the young Harpies team was wound so tight they might snap rather than spring.</p><p>"Remember, ladies, no more than three drinks," team captain, Gwenog Jones, called.</p><p>"Five!" returned the Seeker, the 102 pound Calista Fife. For such a small woman, she could put away the alcohol.</p><p>"Three, Fife," Jones barked. "And no men. I want you lot sharp on the pitch tomorrow."</p><p>"Jones obviously doesn't know what a good orgasm can do for your on pitch performance," Chaser Daphne Swift quipped with a smirk before throwing back a tumbler of Firewhisky.</p><p>Angelina was glad that her dark skin hid her blushes from the unobservant. The Harpies were a young team, it was true, but Angelina was the youngest. Gwenog was a decade older than Angelina, and still the fiercest player Angelina had ever met. Maybe it was because she was a female Beater with something to prove, but Jones could drink, curse, and screw with the best of them. In comparison, Angelina felt a complete prude. It would seem some of her mother's stern, Pentecostal diatribes about boys leading her oldest daughter astray had sunk in. Since Hogwarts, Angelina had a strict rule regarding dating and the Quidditch season: the two did not mix.</p><p>Her teammates called Angelina The Great Virgin. Which wasn't true, but it certainly felt that way in comparison to the rest of them. No boyfriends and no casual sex for Angelina Johnson. She'd tried that on in her early days with the team, and it had not fit.</p><p>So, as the team easily slipped past Gwenog's three drink maximum, Angelina escaped into a lonely corner of the pub with her Butterbeer. Only the corner wasn't as lonely as she had first assumed as she found a familiar face lurking by the door.</p><p>"Adrian Pucey?"</p><p>The man in question smiled. He was by far the best, and most honest, Slytherin Chaser during Angelina's time at Hogwarts. For his efforts, he'd been chucked off the team in favor of some half-troll willing to bash a Gryffindor's head in, on the pitch of course. Pucey was also damn fine. If he hadn't been a Slytherin, Angelina could have fancied him.</p><p>"Good evening, Chaser Johnson."</p><p>"What brings you to this corner of Wales?"</p><p>"I was meeting a friend," Pucey said, motioning with his Butterbeer towards a ginger man who was chatting up Calista. "But it would seem he's found more…delightful company than I could provide."</p><p>"You could join him," Angelina said. She eyed him appreciatively. He must be six-foot-three, maybe taller, and leanly muscular. Black hair and hazel eyes, and the kind of perfect features that managed to be beautiful but unmistakably masculine at the same time. "I'm sure the team would love you."</p><p>"That's what I'm afraid of," he said, still with that smile. "I think they might eat me alive."</p><p>Angelina laughed and sat at a nearby table. "They would, too."</p><p>"Do you mind?" he asked, hand on the back of the opposite chair.</p><p>"Not at all."</p><p>"Are you nervous for tomorrow's game?" he asked, leaning in.</p><p>"I try to tell myself it's like playing for the Quidditch Cup at Hogwarts," Angelina said. "But…"</p><p>"It's not at all?"</p><p>She shook her head. "No, it's not. It's the biggest match of my life and no amount of Butterbeer is going to cool my anxiety."</p><p>"Still, you're living the dream, right?"</p><p>In so many ways Pucey was right. From the first time her father took her to a Quidditch match, Angelina had wanted to play professionally. But she couldn't help looking at her teammates and feel as if the dream wasn't all it should be. Oliver had a comfortable position in Puddlemere. Most of the team was older than him, a good mix of men and women, several of them married, including Oliver. Puddlemere was renowned as a very family oriented team, with strong community roots. The Harpies, on the other hand, were the rebels. A group of witches out to prove their worth. Marriage and family wasn't strictly forbidden, but the underlying attitude was that those things were frowned upon. How many witches lasted in this league after babies came along?</p><p>"Yes," Angelina said. "It's everything I've always wanted."</p><p>Some of Angelina's conflicting emotions must have played across her face because Pucey's hazel eyes had some uncomfortable, and all too knowing, questions behind them. "I know something of living with a group and not feeling a part of them."</p><p>"Do you?" Angelina cocked one eyebrow. "So, I hear you're the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Are you hiding any scandals that will end your career? Are you secretly a vampire? Or maybe you have a string of bastards across England and Wales."</p><p>"Guilty as charged," Pucey said with a laugh. "I have a litter of vampire babies hidden away in the wilds of Scotland as we speak."</p><p>"Careful. That's the kind of thing that we Gryffindors would absolutely believe of a Slytherin." Angelina leaned in and pitched her voice low. "Even one who fought in the Battle of Hogwarts."</p><p>"I hate to disappoint, but I've given up all my deep dark secrets, and I hope that they are the type to do me credit, rather than harm."</p><p>"How did you end up as Defense professor?"</p><p>"The same way everybody else does: No one wanted the job and I needed one."</p><p>"And do you like it?"</p><p>Pucey stroked his chin, looking far off for a moment. "I do, much to my own surprise. It's had its moments, but—"</p><p>"Such as?" Angelina asked. She was picturing Puking Pastels and dung bombs, but was delighted when Pucey blushed.</p><p>"Well." He cleared his throat. "Some of the sixth and seventh year Slytherin girls remember me, and it's been, er, awkward."</p><p>Angelina laughed. "You can't leave it there. What are we talking about here? Love potions? Bad poetry?"</p><p>"Um, yes, there's been some of that." Pucey's face was now bright red.</p><p>"C'mon, Pucey, you can tell me."</p><p>"Adrian."</p><p>That caused Angelina to pause for a moment.</p><p>"I'll call you Adrian," she said, eyeing him from under her eyelashes. "<em>If</em> you tell me what these girls did to make you so flustered."</p><p>"I can see the Gryffindor chivalry does not extend to its female members." He sighed heavily, but grinned. "My quarters are on the same corridor as the Slytherin common rooms. I'm being groomed, you see, to take over as Head of House when Slughorn leaves. And well, all of the students need extra support this year."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Nightmares, flashbacks. In Slytherin, there is a lot of infighting, and bullying from the rest of the school."</p><p>"Oh." Angelina had never imagined that the Slytherins would be affected by the war the same way that other Houses were. She'd heard about the kind of intimidation tactics that had been allowed at the school in the last year of the war, largely carried out by Slytherins. Yet, she couldn't imagine Adrian taking part in torture sessions, so maybe there were other Slytherins of his ilk.</p><p>"Anyway," Adrian plowed ahead. "Once, early in the year, two of the older girls came around my rooms in their, um, silk dressing gowns. And nothing else." Fascinatingly, his entire face turned the exact shade of a Bing cherry. "Which they proceeded to show me, along with a highly inappropriate offer."</p><p>Angelina laughed. "Do I want to know what the offer was? I think I do."</p><p>"No, you decidedly do not." His face went from Bing chery to eggplant, causing Angelina to chuckle.</p><p>"Well, what did you do then?"</p><p>"I took two hundred points from Slytherin and gave them a month's worth of detention with Filch. Then the next day, I installed a magical peephole. I was not going to be caught unawares again."</p><p>"Who knew that being a Hogwarts professor was so exciting?"</p><p>Adrian collapsed against his chair. "Who knew, indeed."</p><p>Somehow an hour passed by, then two, and Angelina never noticed until she saw Calista stumbling out with Adrian's ginger friend. Their conversation had carried on seamlessly from Hogwarts to catching up about friends and classmates. Adrian had known about Lee and Alicia, but not that Alicia had lost her family in the war. Meanwhile, Angelina was astonished to find out that Adrian had been close with David Smythe, a Muggleborn Hufflepuff from their year. David was killed by Snatchers, but he'd been a mate of Angelina's ex-boyfriend, Paul Young, who'd also been a Hufflepuff. That small world feeling had pressed in on Angelina until she realized that her team was pissed and she needed to get her sleep.</p><p>"Thank you for keeping me company," Angelina said, pushing away from the table.</p><p>Adrian automatically stood. "Th-this has been nice…Angelina. May I call you Angelina?"</p><p>Pursing her lips, Angelina curtseyed. "You may." She burst out laughing when he blushed.</p><p>"I know, my manners can be stuffy, I reckon."</p><p>"It's nice."</p><p>"Antiquated might be more to the point. What I really wanted to ask is if you'd like to go out sometime? On a proper date? Or-or just drinks?"</p><p>Angelina's breath caught. It had been a long time since she dated anybody—since Katie touched that cursed necklace actually. After all was said and done, so many of her friends had been left hurting or grieving, Angelina just hadn't felt the time or need for romance. But everybody was getting on with their lives, weren't they? Aside from Katie and Oliver, who had dashed down the aisle with a bun in the oven, Lee and Alicia were seeing each other, too. In fact, Lee's star was on the rise with the Wizarding Wireless Network, and Angelina had hopes that Alicia would return to her Healer's studies this summer. George had the shop and his family. She knew her friendship was important to him, but surely he wouldn't begrudge her a spot of fun, would he? George didn't even need to know. One date was nothing, it probably wouldn't even turn into two dates muchless a relationship.</p><p>"I don't date during the season," Angelina said. Taking all of her Gryffindor courage in hand, Angelina looked at Adrian from under her lashes and offered him a red-lipped smile. "But owl me when it's over."</p>
