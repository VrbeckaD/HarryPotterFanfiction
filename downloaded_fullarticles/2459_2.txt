  <strong>Marriage Law Sweeps Britain</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">Over the last few days, members of Wizengamot have been locked in session, in attempts to decide the fate of the wizarding world.  For those of you out of the loop, Wizengamot was called to session on the 6<sup>th</sup> October 1999 due to the decrease in Britain’s wizarding population. Our numbers have been in steep decline since the days of Grindlewald’s attempt at rising to power and despite his defeat by the late Albus Dumbledore in 1945 (see page 8 for more information), we were hit by another Dark Lord two decades later, this time he went by the name of Lord Voldemort. Lord Voldemort or Tom Riddle as he was named at birth (see page 6 for more on this), caused chaos for over a decade before young Harry Potter defeated him.  Tom Riddle returned in 1994, though earlier attempts are believed to have been made, and Britain once again was hit by war.   Over the last 50 years, the numbers of wizards and witches in Britain has hit an all-time low. Census’ show that since 1940 the population has dropped by nearly 60%, and the number of Hogwarts students in each year has gone down from figures reaching over 100 in previous years to having 40 students.  </p>
<p align="center">The reasons mentioned above have lead Wizengamot and our new Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt to call into power a marriage law, to be known simply as Marriage Law 99. Unmarried or betrothed Witches and Wizards between the ages of 18 and 65 are subject to the law and should expect to receive the name of their future spouse in the post within the next few days. Those under the age of 18 but over the age of 10 will be matched with another during their final year of Hogwarts.  Marriage Law 99 stipulates that couples should have at least four children within the first ten years of marriage. This according to Arithmacy experts should increase the population within the next thirty years by 50%. At this time the Ministry states that no one under 10 will be affected by the marriage law nor will be expected to be married to someone, not of their choosing, and the biggest age difference between spouses will be ten years.</p>
<p align="center"> The Ministry also hopes to track down the Muggleborns students who were born between 1985 and 1998 that would have never received a letter to Hogwarts due to Tom Riddle wiping their names from Ministry records. They hope this will also increase our numbers.</p>
<p align="center">Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt had this to say, “It is unfortunate that this has come into effect. The member of Wizengamot and myself spent many hours discussing different possibilities and the potential outcomes. The only idea which despite not being the ideal solution for many is the only one that can positively impact our numbers in the timescale needed for us to thrive. I myself will also be subject to the law.”</p>
<p align="center"> So you heard it here first, marriage law has been decreed for all those born in wizarding Britain. After facing a decade of war is this really what we need.</p>
<p align="center">For more information on Marriage Law 99 please turn to page 3, this includes details of what will happen if you try to flee, and let me tell you, it isn’t pretty folks.</p>

<p>“You have got to kidding me,” Hermione cursed as she read the article. She was currently sat at the dining table in the Burrow and had decided to read the morning paper as she waited for Molly to finish cooking her breakfast.  Hermione had learned over the years that no matter how many times she told Molly she was happy with a slice of toast, the woman would always give her a heartier breakfast.</p>
<p>“What now dear?” Molly asked from her position at the stove.</p>
<p>“They are forcing us to marry,” Hermione sighed, “And not of our choosing either.”</p>
<p>“No,” Molly replied aghast, “We haven’t had a marriage law in place since the 1700s, are our number really that bad?”</p>
<p>“Apparently so,” Hermione commented, “The population has dropped over 60% since the 1940s.”</p>
<p>“This is bad,” Molly muttered.</p>
