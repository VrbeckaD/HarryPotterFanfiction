    <p>It wasn't extremely hard for Harry to leave the Wizarding world behind. Emotionally - it was much harder. After all, he was leaving the place that he only ever really fit in, was leaving all of his friends and was leaving his godson Teddy, Remus and Tonks’ baby, behind. He wasn't going to leave them forever, of course, but he knew it would be a while before he would contact them again. Physically - leaving the Wizarding World was all too easy.</p><p>Being in the good graces of the Goblin's once again and his title as the Master of Death, encouraged them to work faster than they usually would to meet his requirements. Before he knew it, Harry had a quarter of his bank turned into muggle money, both American dollars and English pounds, an apartment in the USA bought out by him and a one way plane ticket to the Sates. He had no intentions of stepping foot in England for some time...</p><p>Now, he was on the plane, his new phone turned off and switching between gripping the wide arm rests or tugging at his blue hoodie. He didn't know what to do with himself, after all, he had never flown in a plane before - the Dursley's would never pay for him to come with them when they went abroad. Instead, they would lock him up in the house, turn the heating and electricity off with a bare minimum of food in the fridge, before they told him they would be back in two weeks. Dudley would never fail to show Harry their family photos, bragging about all the things he did, what they ate, where they stayed, aiming to rub it in Harry's face that he could never go. But Dudley didn't know was that Harry loved the photos, seeing that there was a wider world beyond his little cupboard under he stairs, a world where no one knew his face or cared for his past - it always gave him hope for a better future.</p><p>Sure, Harry loved to fly. He loved the wind in his hair, loved skimming his fingers through the fresh water below as he smiled at his reflection, loved that feeling in his gut as he dropped to the ground, hearing the terrified and concerned tones of the people around him, before he pulled up at the last possible minute. This was nothing like those times... This was a plane, a metal contraption that expanded and contracted to the pressure of the air, a metal cocoon that was flown by electricity and was guided by two men at the front. If this went badly, Harry had no way to escape safely, no way to save these people.</p><p>His breath started to pick up, chest visibly heaving as his nails dug, painfully, into the cushion of the armrest. He could feel his restrained magic beginning to flux, reacting to his mild panic. Desperately, he tried to keep a hold of it, tried to bring it within himself once again. After all, magic and technology just didn't mix well...</p><p>Suddenly a warm hand enclosed around his, the texture of the hand seemed to be bronzed by the sun in a natural way, small and delicate with short fingers to fit her petit hand. The nails weren't painted, but they shined with a varnish, kept short and well rounded with care. There were no other accessories around the area and so his green eyes trailed up to a delicate limb and to the face of a girl that was a head shorter than him, but older by a year or two, brown eyes, almost black, shined with kindness and concern, her black hair was tied back in a strict pony-tail with small curls falling to frame her thin face. Her nose was a little longer than average, ending in wide nostrils, and her lips were full, shimmering in the plane light with a soft, neutral pink.</p><p>"Hey, kid," came the thick feminine American accent, "You okay? Not gonna throw up are ya?" she questioned, smiling at her little joke while she shifted away half teasingly and half serious.</p><p>"What?" Harry asked dumbly, before he used his other hand to lift his glasses and rub firmly at the bridge of his nose. He shook his head, "No, I'm fine."</p><p>"Scared of heights?" she questioned, eyebrow raised.</p><p>"No. Scared of planes." Harry corrected as he forced himself to sigh and sit back in his chair, ignoring the comical way that the girl's other eyebrow had raised with the first. "I quite like heights, it's calming and thrilling. But I like to be in control so that I can save myself if something goes wrong." he admitted, wondering absently when the last time was when he had played Quiddich, or had just grabbed his broom and took off flying for no reason. He found himself missing those times...</p><p>"Okay," the girl nodded with acceptance, "I can understand that," she smiled, "I'm the opposite. I'm terrified of heights, but if someone else is there for me, I can deal." They lapsed into a comfortable silence as she traded a small smile with him. Then her dark eyebrows drew together, as if realising something, "Where're your parents? You don't look old enough to be going to the States alone."</p><p>"I'm seventeen," Harry frowned in confusion. Surely he was old enough to travel on his own by muggle standards?</p><p>"Oh," she uttered, slightly surprised, "You look a bit younger than that... So, what? You taking a gap year, travel the hell out of the country before going back?"</p><p>Harry nodded in contemplation. That was the gist of it anyway. He couldn't very well tell her that he was a war hero and he just wanted to get away from the nightmares for a little while. "Yeah. More or less," he saw her raise another expectant eyebrow making him quickly add on an awkward explanation of "It's complicated."</p><p>She nodded in acceptance and leaned back, then suddenly realised that she was still holding his hand and quickly retracted the contact, making a smile tug at his lips. He gave a small laugh when she caught his amusement and glared at him playfully, making herself laugh in turn.</p><p>"I'm Lucy Steale."</p><p>"Harry Potter."</p><p>They shook hands.</p><p>Throughout the rest of the flight, the pair talked, distracting one another from their fears, and finding that they got along like a house on fire. She told him that she had a twin called Daisy that had elected to stay at home, due to exams and studying that she had to do, while Lucy visited their grandparents, who had decided to move out to the bitter UK to live out their remaining days - her grandma was originally from the UK. She had stayed in their small country house for two weeks before she had to go back to her small town in California and to Los Angeles where he attended University.</p><p>"You're kidding." Harry deadpanned, disbelief and hope churning in his chest. "You're going to LA?"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"That's where I'm heading. Got an apartment sorted for myself and everything. If its close enough, I bet you could stay with me, there's plenty of room and the rent's quite cheap if I'm honest and I was going to be looking for a roommate anyways. Might as well be someone with a friendly face than a stranger." he offered, thinking about the things he would need to do in order for someone to stay with him. However, he may have told her a small white lie as he had technically bought the apartment for temporary use and so if Lucy were to live there, she'd be paying <em>him</em> rent. Though, she might not even take it...</p><p>Shaking himself out of his contemplations, Harry looked at the girl beside him, suddenly realising that she hadn't spoken in the past few minutes. He wondered what was wrong. Suddenly, he was enveloped by an enthusiastic American as she squealed loudly in his ear, shocking him into stillness.</p><p>"Excuse me, can you please be quiet?" a stewardess chastised them with a judging stare and Harry blushed lightly at the looks the two were being given in the surrounding area.</p><p>Lucy didn't seem so embarrassed as she smiled brightly up at the stewardess, who still wore a slight frown of contempt, as she whispered an unapologetic, "Sorry." before promptly ignoring the people around them. She stared at Harry with bright, hopeful eyes, "I would love to live with you," she gushed, "I've been looking for a place for a year, but there's been no luck. I thought I was going to have to drop out of University because the accommodations were so expensive. How big is it? How many bedrooms does it have? Is it near the University of California, LA? How much-"</p><p>"Lucy," Harry interrupted, cutting her off sharply, and gave her a small smile to show that he meant well, "How about I tell you after the flight? Then I can show you the place as well. I haven't really looked at it, apart from the pictures." he smiled, pleased by her enthusiasm and easy acceptance of his offer. It made him feel like it was the right choice in going to America. It made him smile and feel something light and warm within his chest, something that took him a moment to register as happiness. Merlin, how long had he been unhappy for?</p><p>The rest of the flight was completed with idol chatter, mainly Lucy gasping and exclaiming in a scandalised manner whenever he claimed not to know of this movie, that song, or that actor (a Wizard became extremely detached from the muggle world, whether they were raised in it or not) and ended up making a list of things that he <em>had</em> to catch up on. She seemed happy enough to introduce these things to him though, despite looking so horrified and shocked at his lack of knowledge. Harry found himself smiling more than he had in ages, his cheeks hurting from laughing and smiling so much during the flight. Lucy’s attitude and personality so utterly fresh and new to him that Harry found himself wanting to spend more and more time with her.</p><p>Before he knew it, the flight was over and the two were talking about splitting a cab together, Lucy wanting to see Harry’s place before she shook off her jet lag. Hours later, having spent more time with the young woman, had Harry smiling even more, relaxing for what felt like the first time since the Triwizard Tournament, when Cedric had died and Voldemort had risen in the physical world once again...</p><p>“Hey,” interrupted Lucy’s voice, her American accent tinted with concern and when he turned to look at her, her expression had creased into concern as well, “You okay? You look like you went into a dark place, right then.” Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat, eyes unconsciously shifting to the window as to avoid her assessing gaze, effectively closing himself off. “You don’t have to talk about it, but I’m here if you need me,” she smiled reassuringly, face open and free of any judging emotions, “We are friends after all."</p><p>A smile twitched at his lips. To think that people could make friends this fast, Harry would have thought it nuts, impossible. Yet, here he was, with a girl that he actually considered his friend, someone that he actually wanted to console himself to. He decided to go for the leap…</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine,” he started softly, “Just thinking about a friend that was a bit like you. He was nice to everyone, even when they didn’t particularly deserve his generosity…” he trailed off, thinking of the time that he saw Cedric directing Draco and his friends to the correct classes in their first year, after an older Slytherin had pointed them the wrong way. He remembered Draco’s sneer at the older student before he turned on his heel and headed to where Cedric had directed them with a kind smile on his face, not a nod of gratitude or word of thanks from Draco or his friends. The Hufflepuff had only waved off the rude first years before he followed the rest of his group to class.</p><p>“Was?” Lucy picked up.</p><p>“Yeah, he died about... two years ago. God, it seems like only yesterday…” he muttered as he stared into nothing ahead of him with haunted green eyes.</p><p>“You saw him die didn’t you?” came the all too uncertain question, staring intently at his face as if measuring his reaction to the inquiry. His flinch gave him away… “Oh, honey… I’m so sorry for your loss. I wont bring it up again. I promise.” she insisted gently, dark brown eyes practically pleading for forgiveness after picking at such an old wound of Harry’s.</p><p>In response, Harry could only give a small jerky nod, untrusting of his voice. Clearing his throat, he aimed a half smile at the girl next to him, “You seem too good at all the comfort stuff… Any chance you’d be studying in that kind of thing?"</p><p>Lucy gave a smile of her own, all too glad for the change of subject, “I’m majoring in psychology. Top of my class.” she half gloated, shifting her dark locks of hair like they were highly preened feathers that were a mastery of art, “My twin is majoring art and design in the same university. She’s really good too, getting some recognition from some high people in the art world. Her signature is actually a small daisy in the corner. I think it’s brilliant.” she gushed, practically beaming with pride at her sister’s accomplishment, something that was so different from Ron and his regards to his older brothers.</p><p>They spoke for the rest of the car ride about light subjects, not once lapsing into an awkward silence, like two friends that had known one another for years.</p><p>When they arrived at his new home, the place was already filled up with his boxed possessions (though there weren’t many boxes, in all), ready for him to unpack and make a home out of the bare rooms before him. The space around him was quite large, larger than what he was expecting with a kitchen and living room conjoined into one space nearly as big as the Weasley’s ground floor. To the left of the front door was a small bathroom, the door a light shade of oak wood, the space equipped with a toilet, sink and standing-shower crammed into one space. Stepping further into the living room, away from the door, there was a wooden door, the same shade as the bathroom’s, that led into a bedroom that was already decorated with a double bed and a nightstand, the wide window making the space more open. A few paces down revealed a room of a similar state to the first, both sharing a large bathroom that had doors connected to it at both ends. On the wall adjacent to the first two rooms was another room, a bedroom that shared the same qualities of the previous two. In all, it was a rather comfortable living space and Harry was shocked that the Goblins had taken so much time as to finding him a living space that accommodated his fear of small spaces due to his childhood room, that had been a dark cupboard under the stairs. How they knew of such a thing, he didn’t know but wasn’t much surprised that they did.</p><p>“Wow…” Harry slowly spun on his heel as he eyed the surroundings, green eyes wide and sparkling with delight, “It didn’t look this big in the photos…”</p><p>However, before he could get comfortable, a tentative “Harry.” was spoken behind him, making him spin around to face Lucy. Lucy who looked depressed, disappointed and worried. It made Harry wonder what could have dampened this bright girl’s mood, and if he could possibly change it.</p><p>“Lucy, what’s wrong?” he took a hesitant step forward, breathing a subtle sigh of relief when she didn’t flinch back from him.</p><p>“Harry…” she sighed, a hand coming to her head, rubbing it as if to rid herself of an oncoming headache, “I don’t think I can afford this. I mean, the place is great, awesome actually, but I don’t know if I could ever afford a place like this with the paid work I do and classes. You probably can because your parents are probably paying for you-"</p><p>“My parents are dead.” Harry stated flatly, stopping Lucy in her tracks. She stared at him with wide eyes, uncertain of how she could possibly respond to such a terrible and sudden reveal, “They were murdered when I was a baby. The murderer tried to kill me as well, but they never got the chance,” he lifted his hair to show his scar, evidence of his attack, “I was placed in my Aunt’s care, but she and her family hated me and my parents... I bought this place with the money I got from the government as the authorities never caught the murderer and for my abuse that I had tried to plead help for, but was dismissed. That’s how I can afford this place. And I’d like you to live with me, and share in paying the bills, because rent is not an issue here.” he finished, a shaky smile on his lips, before he just couldn’t take her continued silence and quickly looked away, jaw clenching with emotions that he just didn’t want to think about at the moment…</p><p>Suddenly, all the air was squeezed out of his lungs as a force slammed into him, casting both him and his attacker onto the old-looking sofa. His vision was filled with smothering dark hair and a female voice speaking in a rapid tongue that Harry could barely differentiate. He blinked out of his stupor as Lucy drew away from her bombarding hug and kissed him on the cheek, smiling as bright as a thousand suns.</p><p>“I guess that’s a yes to wanting to be roommates?” Harry wheezed out, laughing slightly when Lucy squealed an ecstatic ‘yes' and proceeded to hug the life out of him.</p>
