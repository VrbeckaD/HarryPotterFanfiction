    <p>When Hermione was seven, her aunt - in the loosest sense of the word, for she was neither a blood nor a relation by marriage, just an old family friend - Minerva sat her down and told her that the only person she could ever rely on would be herself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Everyone has a motive my dear,” she said around sips of tea - one of the few British staples she’d refused to leave behind when she’d moved to France with her husband. It wasn’t the first time the woman had imparted her wisdom, but it was perhaps the first time Hermione really listened - paid attention and remembered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So when her parents shipped her off to the Potter’s later that summer, she remembered what her aunt had said and learned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Learned that James and Lily Potter’s marriage was not as rosy as it seemed. That full conversations could be held in glances. That promises made by parents who vowed to return at the end of summer and bring her home to England meant nothing when they didn’t, couldn’t, because they were dead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Potters took her in. Treated her like she was their own. Harry was certainly possessive of her, arguing and threatening anyone, especially the Weasley boy that served on the vast Potter estate, who had a knack for bothering her more than anyone else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can look after myself you know,” a twelve year old Hermione told him one afternoon as she helped him bathe his bloodied fist in a bucket of ice. He snorted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But why should you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It bothered her at first, his possessiveness. He was always there, always watching her - it was only when she was older that she realised how much power she had over him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That she had a lot of power over all of them.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>She was seventeen when Tom Riddle and his family moved into the estate beside the Potter’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m Harry,” her best friend, her intended for all intensive purposes, said, curling his arm around her waist and pulling her tighter into him, “and this is Lady Granger.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hermione,” she corrected, shrugging out of his embrace and stepping forward to greet their new neighbour. She didn’t miss the flicker of <em> something </em> in his eyes when he met her gaze and took her hand in his, bringing it to his lips and pressing a chaste kiss against her knuckles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Pleasure.”</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>They didn’t talk about anything when she slipped away from the Potter’s and met him in the abandoned guest house on his estate.They simply tumbled together in a haze of lust and tangled limbs and harsh breathes and <em> oh god Tom, yes, please harder </em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione was under no illusion about what he wanted from her, it was the same thing she wanted from him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The war between Dumbledore’s rebel forces and Grindelwald’s loyalists continued to rage around them. It was only a matter of time before it all came to a head and with both Harry and Tom’s fathers front and centre of the conflict, it was also just a matter of time before they were dragged into it too.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“When we win this,” Hermione mumbled, running her hand through his hair, even as Harry breathed into the space between her neck and shoulder, his tongue sliding along her neck, tasting the sweat that had gathered there in the moments before, “I want to get married.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Presumptuous,” he nipped against her collarbone and she whined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She rolled them over, sliding his still hard length back inside of her and sitting atop his lap. His hands slid up her thighs to caress the curve of her breasts, his thumbs flicking her nipples and she ground against him. “I’m serious,” she moaned, moving above him, her clit rubbing deliciously against his pubic bone, “I want to be Empress. I want that fucking crown atop my head and I want everyone to bow down before me,” she said, her eyes closed and her head thrown back, words she’d never dreamed to speak aloud before slipping past her lips without permission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry only hummed beneath her.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You need to leave now,” she murmured, when they stepped back into their tent amongst the camp. Dumbledore had been found dead not an hour ago, the result of a long hatched plan between herself, Harry and Tom, and they’d just returned, along with half a dozen other commanders in the army, from overseeing the pronouncement. “We need to gather the army as quickly and quietly as possible and head straight for Paris. Gellert will not be expecting us. It will be easy. All of the others will support you Harry,” she insisted. “They supported your parents before they died and they will support you now too.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tom-” he started to object</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s eyes widened in shock at the insistence in her tone. “Herm-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tom wants to be Emperor Harry,” she hissed, stepping in front of him. She jerked her head in the tent opening’s direction, “you know he will be thinking the same.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He wouldn’t betray me,” he protested weakly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She rolled her eyes but relaxed her stance and stepped forward so that they were face to face, his breath ghosting across her forehead as she looked up at him and he down at her. “Maybe not. But at least this way he won’t ever get the chance.”</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She fell into one of the palace’s many bedrooms alone. Bloody and bruised but giddy and delighted at the outcome of the battle. Harry was still overseeing the logistics of where their army would stay and the state of the capital in general after the battle they’d just fought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She’d felt a momentary pang of regret at the look of hurt she had seen flicker in Tom’s eyes when he’d finally arrived at Tuileries, until to discover that he wasn’t needed. That he was too late. But her aunt’s warning was always at the back of Hermione’s mind and when Tom left, his men following behind diligently, she closed her eyes and thought of the crown she would soon have on her head, all thoughts of Tom Riddle and the time they’d spent together disappearing.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Except.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was gone the next morning. And the next. A week passed. A month.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No word except what she heard from Neville, who only told her everytime a letter arrived that he was making concessions across the continent. Rewarding those that had stood up against Gellert’s regime and punishing those who had supported him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She entertained in his absence - holding <em> their </em>court up by herself. Making sure everyone was happy - that nobody needed anything - that nobody went without. Nobody protested against her doing so, pledging their allegiance to her and Harry like they were simply agreeing to tea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Until finally, they received word that he was on his way back to them. To her. Everyone was excited, eager to see their <em> saviour </em>. To have their salvation, their Emperor, returned safely to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nobody was expecting a <em> different </em>Empress to step out of the carriage beside him though.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They couldn’t meet her eye.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She hadn’t seen them in months, having escaped to her aunt’s palace in Versailles as soon as it had been possible and yet not a single one of them could look her in the eye, even as they fell over themselves to fawn over her with their ‘Lady Hermione's’, their air kisses, their pitying glances and their complete and utter stupidity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’ll find a nice husband dear,” Lady Black, a woman who Hermione had endured plenty of summers with as a ward of the Potter’s said, patting her hand and smiling down at her condescendingly. Hermione knew she was thanking her lucky stars that both Lords Regulus and Sirius were already betrothed, for who would want the cast off of the Emperor himself, even if they’d never been publicly declared as a couple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lady Longbottom was more subtle, but she still squeezed Hermione’s hand gently and told her not to give up hope. That there would be plenty of time to settle down and have children of her own. Hermione smiled wanly at the woman and nodded, holding her tongue in the process. It would have done no good for anyone to witness her lashing out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lady Nott, nee Greengrass, was contrite in her greeting and Hermione allowed the other woman to pull her into a gentle embrace. “I am sorry you know,” she mumbled into Hermione's ear, squeezing Hermione’s hand firmly within her own, “I warned her not to do this.” Hermione tensed at the mention of Daphne’s sister but then Lord Nott appeared and whisked his wife away and Hermione was left to stand, alone, again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Lady Granger,” Lord Draco Malfoy smirked, gracing her gloved hands with a chaste kiss against the silk. Hermione rolled her eyes and pursed her lips at his antics. He was the only one, <em> the only one, </em> who deigned to look her in the eye and she could see the pain and anger reflected in his eyes as if it were her own, even if his face wore an impassive mask. “Have you met my mother?” He asked, stepping aside to reveal Lady Malfoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No,” Hermione murmured, swallowing nervously, “I’ve not had the pleasure.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lady Narcissa Malfoy waved off the slight curtsy Hermione had been about to dip into and took Hermione into her arms. “There’s no need to be so formal dear. Especially not now.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione chanced a look in Draco’s direction, but he was carefully avoiding her gaze and engaging some other Lord in small talk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“‘Not now?’ Lady Malfoy. Whatever do you mean?” She asked, quirking her head to the side as she pondered the older woman’s words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione watched Narcissa’s posture tense and straighten.  The woman levelled her with a look so intense that Hermione felt goosebumps erupt along her arms and for how much she knew Draco was often told how much he resembled his late father, she’d never thought he looked more like his mother than in that moment. “Karma, my dear, is a wretched thing,” she said quietly against her ear, “they will both get what is coming to them. I know they will.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione tensed her jaw and nodded. “I hope so,” she murmured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Narcissa pulled back, squeezed her forearms and nodded. “I know so.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Lords and Ladies may I present to you, your new leaders. The Emperor and Empress of France.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione stiffened in Narcissa’s grip but it was Draco who turned and stomped away from the sight of their new rulers entering the room. She didn’t blame him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Empress, Draco’s former fiancée, Astoria Greengrass, had her arm hooked through the Emperor’s and was smiling so widely, Hermione thought it must have hurt. She looked beautiful, Hermione admitted, with her pale pink corseted ball gown - that emphasised her narrow waist and accentuated what little cleavage the conniving chit had - and her matching lace gloves. Her blonde hair was crowned on the top of her head, numerous jewels scattered through it and she wore a dusty pink lipstick and blush. She fluttered her eyelashes and smiled demurely when the guests curtsied and Hermione’s free hand clenched into a fist. She was sure, if not for the gloves she wore, that her nails would have broken the skin of her palm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She heard Narcissa mutter a quiet “that boy” before she too abandoned her glaring and followed after him. Hermione didn’t move. She watched the pair of them make their way around the opulent ballroom, her chin raised defiantly against all the whispers and pitying looks that were being shot her way once again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She didn’t falter when the couple approached her and bent her knee in supplication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Her Imperial Majesty, Empress of France.” She said through clenched teeth before turning to face the Emperor, never raising from her curtsey. “His Imperial Majesty, Emperor of France.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He laughed and Hermione tasted blood on her tongue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh ‘Mione,” he chuckled affectionately and a shudder of disgust trilled through her at the way the nickname he’d used since they were children, that she’d always abhorred but put up with from him, rolled off his tongue. “There’s no need to be so formal with me,” he said, stepping away from Astoria and pulling Hermione up and into his embrace. She remained stiff in his arms and bit her tongue when his hand rested against the small of her back. “I’ve always been Harry to you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She stepped back from him and concealed her grimace with a simpering smile. “Of course Harry. Congratulations,” she said, giving them both the smallest of nods and hoping that that would be enough for them to leave her be. She didn’t want to be there after all, but she’d be damned if she’d give any of them, especially Astoria Greengrass, the opportunity to ridicule her for her absence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She was still a highborn Lady after all. There would be no escape from attending these lavish balls, especially while she was unwed. After all, how was she supposed to meet her future husband if she stayed at home alone every evening?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Astoria made to move along, but Harry had other ideas. He took Hermione’s hand in his, caressing her palm with his thumb. “How have you been? I haven’t seen you in months,” he murmured lowly. Hermione blinked at him and flicked her eyes to Astoria. The Empress was glaring at her accusatory,  like it was her fault her husband was behaving so uncouthly. “I’ve missed you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione cleared her throat, averted her eyes and folded her hands prettily along the skirt of her own ball gown. A cherry red masterpiece that her aunt had sent with her from Versailles. With her own loose mahogany curls hanging down her back and the earrings, that Harry’s own mother had given her when she was just a child, adorning her ears, every head had turned her way at least once. “That’s nice,” she muttered, but Harry ignored her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re going to have to make more appearances at court now you know,” he teased, “can’t have you hiding away in that lofty estate home your parents left you with your books and Crookshanks.” Hermione bristled. “We need to find you a nice young Lord of your own now. Someone who’ll challenge you, keep you on your to-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh I think I keep her on her toes alright Potter,” a voice interrupted. Hermione’s head snapped up and her lips pursed in disapproval when she saw just who had come to her rescue. “Don’t I love?” He asked, arching an eyebrow, his dark eyes gleaming wickely down at her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“His Imperial Majesty, Emperor of France.” Astoria cut in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom’s eyes widened at Astoria’s words, but Hermione was sure no-one but her saw it before he dipped his head curtly. “Of course. My apologies. His Imperial Majesty, Emperor of France.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Lord Riddle,” Harry grit out and Hermione’s eyes flicked back to see Harry clenching his teeth. “I didn’t realise you and Lady Granger were so <em> close </em>.” The way he said that word made Hermione shudder. They hadn’t been this close in months. She hadn’t even known he’d be there tonight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione blushed, but Tom pressed one hand against the small of her back, settled the other on her hip and brought her closer, so that she was stood in front of him. “I think acquainted would be an understatement given how,” he paused, his gaze leaving Hermione’s to meet Harry’s, “<em> intimately, </em> we know each other,” he leered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione moved her foot to press the heel of her shoe into his. “Lord Riddle!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes ‘Mione,” he said, never taking his eyes off Harry. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When she opened them again she could see how close Harry had stepped into their personal space and shuffled back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m suddenly feeling rather faint. Walk with me?” She asked, though her tone brokered no argument. Tom dragged his eyes from Harry to her again. He smirked and nodded, bringing one of her hands into his and lifting it to press a kiss against the palm of her hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Of course,” he replied, and bowed his head in their new rulers direction. “Excuse us,” he murmured, though he didn’t wait for either of them to give him leave before he was whisking Hermione across the ballroom towards the patio doors that led to the balcony. Hermione could feel the eyes of almost everyone in the room burning into her back along with a chorus of muffled whispers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Tom opened the doors she stepped quickly through them and out of his embrace. She braced herself against the balcony railings and exhaled quickly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why did you do that?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Do what?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Lord Riddle.”<br/> </p>
<p>“Lady Granger.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They stared at each other for what felt like minutes but what must only have been seconds before Tom stepped towards her. She felt her fingers dig into the stone beneath her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Would you prefer I hadn’t interrupted?” He asked, his head cocked to the side as he raked his eyes over her. Hermione shifted uncomfortably under his gaze, even though she could feel her arousal pooling in her knickers. Her nipples pebbling against the velvet of her dress, and not just because of the cool Parisian night. “Let him embarrass himself, embarrass you in front of everyone? In front of his wife?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do you care?” She snarled, pacing towards him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh I don't care at all,” he snapped. “All the better for me if the Emperor chooses to get his dick wet in someone other than his wife.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She slapped him and his head reeled back with the ferocity of it. “How dare you?” She hissed, shoving him away then advancing on him again. “You have no idea, no idea what I have been thro-”<br/> </p>
<p>“Been through?” He scoffed, taking a hold of the wrist that was currently jabbing its finger into his chest. “Oh please. You’re upset that he didn’t choose you. Cast you aside for some foreign little chit instead. One who will spread her legs far and wide for his heirs and ignore all the other woman he spends his nights with,” he sneered. “You and Malfoy are the same. Angry and upset because the person they are in love with isn’t in love with them.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione froze at his words. <em> Loved. He thought - he though…. </em>She laughed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t stop speaking. “You know nothing about betrayal. He stole this from me,” he hissed, ignoring the way she was laughing hysterically into the night, her head thrown back and her chest heaving with the exertion. He stepped forward and gripped her by the arms, turning her until she was the one pressed against the wall. “I was meant to be Emperor. ME!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“SO WAS I,” she snarled, finally snapping from her laughter and shoving him back. He was too close to her and she couldn't breath with the scent of his cologne washing over her and his breath hot against her face as he stared down at her, memories of all the other times they’d been so close together flashing across her mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I was supposed to be Empress. Me! Not some simpering little girl like Astoria Greengrass. I was the one that made him into the man he is. I’m the one who stayed up all night talking about war plans and defensive strategies.” Tom flinched at her words, his grip loosening on her arms as the truth was revealed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t love him,” she sneered, “I needed him. That title was mine and I did everything, <em> everything,” </em> she said firmly, her eyes narrowing as more memories flitted across her mind, “to get it. You think Harry was smart enough to come up with the idea to betray Dumbledore? To betray <b>you </b>on his own?” She mocked and when Tom’s eyes flicked to her’s she knew he knew what she meant. “Oh yes,” she smirked, running the tip of her tongue over her teeth as the realisation struck him. “I’m the one that told him to betray you. To abandon you in the woods. Alone. Left behind whilst we marched on Paris ourselves.  It was me. It’s always been me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She was panting heavily by the time she finished. His eyes were impossibly black, with lust or anger, Hermione didn’t know. But his left hand was holding her arms above her head and his right was digging into her hip possessively and his eyes kept flicking to the significant amount of cleavage that her dress revealed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You bitch,” he growled, before he pressed her against the wall and himself into her. Their mouths met in a furious clash of teeth and tongues. Biting, tugging, nipping as they fought against one another for dominance. Tom’s hand abandoned her wrist to grab under her bum and hitch her against the wall. Her legs wound around his waist and her hands scratched at his neck, even as he rolled his hips against hers. “This fucking dress,” he groaned into her neck, latching onto her skin with his teeth and using his hips and the wall behind her to keep her up while he fumbled with the material. He ran his hands up her legs, and nipped at her neck when he reached the strip of lace that marked the end of her stockings. “Stockings, Granger,” he murmured against her skin. “You’re trying to kill me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hurry up,” she whined rolling her hips and jolting him back into action. He continued moving his hands until they cupped her bum, then slipped one of them between her legs and pressed against the wet scrap of material separating him from her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re so wet. Is this for me?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She yanked his head back roughly from her neck and glared down at him, rolling her hips against the palm of his hand all the while. “Well it’s not for anyone else, is it?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom clenched his jaw and removed his hand from between her legs. Hermione let go of his neck and gathered the material of her dress in one hand, holding it for him as he quickly unlaced his trousers and pulled his erection free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“God!” He groaned, when he looked back up from his cock to see her free hand had slipped under the lace and she was sliding her fingers against her folds. “Do you have any idea how fucking perfect you look?” He asked, lunging forward. One hand wrapped around her throat whilst the other worked his cock, smearing the pre-come that had leaked from the tip, over the length. He tilted her head so that she could look at him while he nudged against her fingers. She took the hint and held the scrap of lace aside so that he could slide into her dripping cunt with his cock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He pressed the tip of it against her clit. “You’re always so eager for it sweetheart,” he hissed, jerking forward and sliding into her when the door beside them opened and Malfoy stepped out onto the patio</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Riddl- Oh for fuck’s sake!” He hissed quietly, quickly shutting the door behind him and stepping away from it <em> and them </em> “You two are ridiculous. We’re at their fucking coronation for God’s sake. Don’t you have any sense of propriety?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m going to fucking kill him,” Tom mumbled quietly into Hermione’s neck, stepping back and slipping from inside her. Hermione whimpered but let her legs fall from his waist, her dress shifting to hide her modesty. Tom gripped her waist and took a deep breath before he flicked his eyes in Draco’s direction. “What is it?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco glared at the pair of them. “You know better.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Drac-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My mother is looking for you Granger,” he interrupted, finally turning to face the pair of them. “Potter too.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Surely you mean ‘His Imperial Majesty, Emperor of France’,” Tom mocked. Hermione ignored him, stepping around his stiff form to face Draco.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why is your mother looking for me?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco shrugged. “She mentioned something about tea. And revenge,” he added quietly, meeting her narrowed eyes with a hard look of his own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t want revenge,” she said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco scoffed. “Of course you d-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I want his fucking head on a platter.”</p>
