    <p>Harry trudged his way to History of Magic along with Ron and Hermione, already not looking forward to another boring lesson of names and dates that he would never remember. But there was no Binns. No ghost that would drone on until all the students were in a stupor. In his place was a man, his robes clearly well made, black with silver trim around the collar. His hair was black and long, but more elegant than Snape’s.</p><p>“Professor Black was introduced at the Welcome Feast. He’s taken over History of Magic for first through fifth years so Professor Binns can work more closely with the NEWT level students.” Hermione supplied before Harry or Ron could ask. “I’m quite excited – he must have a very different perspective than Professor Binns did.”</p><p>It was as if the new professor had been listening in to their conversation, a smirk spreading smoothly across his face in a way not dissimilar to Malfoy or Snape. A tiny furl of distrust bloomed in Harry’s stomach, though he did his best to push it down. There was nothing to prove the man was as bad as them. The man’s wand tapped the blackboard.</p><p>Regulus Arcturus Black appeared in neat writing followed by a list of course expectations. Grey eyes scanned coolly over the second years briefly before he began speaking. “As a former student of Professor Binns myself, I understand the general impression you would have been given about this subject last year. I understand that many of you don’t care about the actions of wizards and witches from a thousand years ago.” There was something wry in his voice. “However, as we will have to suffer through the next four years together, I’ve only three rules for you. Come to class prepared with any questions you have. Do not talk while I am speaking, that’s what raising your hand is for. If you mention Gilderoy Lockhart, I will automatically deduct five points from your house. Understood?”</p><p>Any misgivings Harry had about Professor Black disappeared with the third rule, though he saw Hermione and many of the girls frown at it. There was a brief moment of silence before the professor nodded. “Let’s begin, then.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The change in attitude around History was astonishing. The night after their first class had Harry searching the staff table for Professor Black, but he wasn’t there. He didn’t remember seeing him any of the other nights either.</p><p>“Sometimes teachers prefer to eat in their rooms. I’m not surprised Professor Black would be the type. He’s free to do it.” Percy told him when Harry brought it up. “Now if you’ll excuse me-” And he moved, bee-lining down the row to where Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were huddled together. But besides the enthusiasm for History that was sweeping his year mates and careful avoidance of Gilderoy Lockhart and Colin Creevy that Harry had to take up, not much was different around the castle.</p><p>Until, of course, Halloween.</p><p>Harry stood, Hermione and Ron flanking him as they all stared at the words written on the wall, shiny red with blood. The sounds of the rest of the student body had fallen from a loud roar of excitement to hushed whispers, eyes on the trio. Malfoy’s voice cut through the crowd, as unpleasant and unwelcome to Harry as always.</p><p>“’Enemies of the Heir beware?’ You’ll be next, mudblood.”</p><p>Before any of them could react, Professor Black’s voice came from the throng of students, cold and unwavering in a way Harry had never heard from him. He wouldn’t stretch so far as to ever call the young professor warm, but there was something in the man’s voice. Something glaringly missing in it at that moment. “That’s enough, Mr. Malfoy. Twenty points from Slytherin. Now all of you back to your dormitories.”</p><p>The effect was immediate – the other students dispersed quickly, whispers growing back into a roar of gossip and speculation. McGonagall stopped the trio before they could vanish into the crowd, taking a moment to address the younger professor. “Thank you, Professor Black, for your defense of my student. Particularly against your own house.”</p><p>Black nodded and Harry blinked in surprise. He hadn’t realized his new favorite professor had been a Slytherin. Black’s eyes were trained on Snape, expression closed. “If we do not make it clear that certain behavior is not acceptable, we are destined to make the same mistakes over and over again.” He looked to Dumbledore instead, eyes flickering briefly back to the writing. “If my presence isn’t necessary, I beg my leave. I have papers to grade and the Weasley twins’ require diagnostic spells before I dare touch them.”</p><p>“I believe the rest of the staff shall be sufficient, Regulus. Good luck with your grading.”</p><p>He inclined his head slightly at the Trio, taking a moment to stare again at the words on the wall, brow furrowed, before he departed.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rumors began spreading across the school rapidly. Harry wasn’t all that surprised – the entire school had seen the message on the wall. So when Hermione’s hand shot up at the beginning of History of Magic, no one was particularly surprised. Professor Black regarded her for a moment before letting out a soft sigh. “I’ve an idea what you’re going to ask about, Ms. Granger, but go ahead.”</p><p>Hermione didn’t hesitate. “I was wondering, I think we were all wondering, about the Chamber of Secrets.” The class nodded and Professor Black sighed again, shaking his head and tapping his wand against the blackboard. Harry nearly grinned and shared a look with Ron as the text was replaced with the words ‘Chamber of Secrets’.</p><p>“I expect all of you to take notes and be prepared for this to be on exams in the future.” There was a scramble to gather quills and ink, Black waiting for it to quiet again before beginning. “The legend of the Chamber of Secrets is one shrouded in mystery. It stretches back to the time of the Founders of Hogwarts. There’s little hard evidence regarding the stories of that time so most historians consider it simply an old myth with little truth. Now, who here remembers the names of the four founders?” Hands shot up across the room. The professor nodded, leaning against his desk. “Mr. Thomas.”</p><p>Dean answered, “Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.”</p><p>“Well done.” The names spread across the blackboard as he continued to speak. “That is our alliterative list of Founders. They were among the brightest of their age and were willing to put that talent to use instead of hoarding their knowledge as lesser scholars would. They came together despite inherent ideological differences to build this school and teach the generations to come.” He paused there, letting them finish scratching notes. “Those were dangerous times to be of magical descent. The secrecy laws we have today did not exist then. Muggles distrusted magic and were willing to persecute wizard kind for it. The Fat Friar is among those that could attest to that sort of thing, as such, until the founding of Hogwarts, most wizards were only taught by family, most muggleborn being victims of anti-magical sentiment as they lacked the training to protect themselves.”</p><p>Seamus’s hand rose. “No offense, Professor, but what’s this got to do with the Chamber of Secrets?”</p><p>The professor let out a soft huff of laughter but relented. “Context, Mr. Finnegan, context. There are certain… ideas associated with the founders and their houses that may or may not be entirely accurate. This legend in particular considering the reputation of Slytherin House.”</p><p>“The Chamber was Slytherin’s?” It was Lavender Brown’s hand up.</p><p>“Quite. The legends say that Salazar Slytherin was against the admittance of muggleborn students. There’s no surviving writing to support it, but it wouldn’t be unheard of at the time. It’s a generally accepted belief in academic circles at the very least, though it tends to be divided on whether that wariness was because he saw them as lesser or if it was fear that they would unwittingly put the rest of the students at risk. This fear reportedly lead to a quarrel between Slytherin and Gryffindor - thought to be the beginning of the feud between the Houses that exists even today.”</p><p>He paused, lips quirking into a smile as if remembering something. “But I’ll get to the point you’re all so eager for. Before leaving the school, people believe that Slytherin made a chamber that no other founder knew about and hidden inside was a beast to be controlled only by him or an heir.”</p><p>Another hand rose, Neville’s this time. “What- what sort of beast?”</p><p>“The legends are unspecific. However, Mr. Longbottom, what creature comes to mind when you think ‘Slytherin’?”</p><p>“A… snake, sir.”</p><p>“Quite. That would be my personal theory, a snake or something similar to one.” His attention turned back to the board tapping it for a third time. The name of the founders cleared, leaving the words CHAMBER OF SECRETS with quick bullets covering everything he’d lectured on. “Professor Binns would tell you that this is only a legend. That the castle has been searched many times and no Chamber revealed. And perhaps he’s right. It’s just as likely the attack on Halloween was a distasteful assault on Mrs. Norris in ‘the holiday spirit’ by someone who knew the legend.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t stop himself, hand raising as the words left him. “What do you believe, professor?”</p><p>Grey eyes met Harry’s, something serious crossing his face before it smoothed out. Unreadable. “I believe it’s likely Chamber exists. No witch or wizard alive could claim to know all of Hogwarts’ secrets. Anyone that does is a fool and a liar. It’s why the legend has staying power. Why any legend can last generations.” He glanced around the room. “Any other questions?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“What do you think, Harry?” Hermione asked. The three of them were huddled together by the fireplace. His head shot up to look at her, startled by the question. He’d been so caught up in everything they’d learned in History that he’d lost track of conversation.</p><p>He hesitated. “I think there really is an Heir of Slytherin. I think the Chamber of Secrets is real. That voice I heard in Lockhart’s office was real and it wanted to kill, Hermione. If it’s the monster from the Chamber and someone’s controlling it, Mrs. Norris won’t be the last attacked.”</p><p>His friends nodded, Ron with a thoughtful frown. “It could be Malfoy. He didn’t seem all that phased by the whole thing and we know he hates muggleborn. His family’s old enough to reach back to Slytherin too.”</p><p>“We could find out.” There was a mix of apprehension and excitement on Hermione’s face as she continued. “We could ask him ourselves.”</p><p>“Right, because he’d just tell us. I can see it now. ‘Hey Malfoy, are you the Heir of Slytherin?’ ‘Of course I am, Weasley, death to the muggles’.”</p><p>Hermione scowled at him. “He won’t tell us, but he’d tell his friends. Polyjuice potion could let us pose as Slytherins and get the information. It’ll take a while, though.” Annoyance faded to concern. “And we’ll need a teacher to sign off on us getting the book it’s in. No Professor would agree to that.”</p><p>Ron grinned and leaned back. “One might.”</p>
