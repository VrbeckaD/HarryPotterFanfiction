    <p>There are suddenly less than two months until James’s ridiculous wedding, so Harry isn’t keeping upon everything at the Ministry when it happens.</p><p>Albus knows, though. He’s thought of almost nothing else for six years.</p><p>Here, on the stormy shores of the sea, he watches the boat sail towards what passes for a dock. He’s been here before. Last year, and the year before that. He’d never gone further than the shore.</p><p>It doesn’t matter. She’s the one crossing the churning waters now. Slow, down the gangway, slower down the dock. She’s in the tattered grey robes that everyone knows from the war, but as he watches, she draws some of the darkness up from the waters and fashions herself a cloak. It’s all the lone guard needs to abandon her, stumbling as he hastens back to the boat.</p><p>Somehow she still looks as grey as the sky. Her hair is black now, but her skin is lifeless, dead. Her dark eyes could have been plucked from the black rock of the island itself for all the life they have. She doesn’t even look surprised to see Albus ― if she recognizes him.</p><p>Delphini’s first free steps on the ground go unnoticed by all but one other.</p><p>She stops in front of him.</p><p>Albus clears his throat. Greetings die there in his lungs, before they get a chance to turn into breath. She’s watching him. He has her attention for now, but he doesn’t know how long that might last.</p><p>“Where will you go?” he asks. His voice is rough.</p><p>Maybe she’s confused by his presence, Albus is confused enough himself, but she only looks wary. Mistrustful. She should be.</p><p>“I have a place you can stay,” he says, looking away, back out to the sea. He can only just see Azkaban from here. He doesn’t think about what it’s like there. He thinks of other prisons. Ones you can never be set free of.</p><p>“All right,” says Delphini. It’s not her voice, the bright voice of a charming young woman, the one Albus first knew. It seems right, somehow.</p><p>He’d been prepared for this ― too prepared. Obviously he wouldn’t want to touch her for a side-along apparition. The logical solution was a portkey, but was he really going to offer <i>his ― their</i> daughter the other end of a spatula to hold? But then why shouldn’t she? Her heritage held nothing respectable, to say nothing of her own deeds. Something from Grandad’s workshop would be too good to offer her.</p><p>He holds out a quill.</p><p>“It’s a portkey,” he says, initially planning to go with her. Instead, he steps back as she takes it. He steals a final look at her and apparates away.</p><p>If she follows, she follows.</p>
