    <p>Remus was admitted to the ICU at St. Mungos once he started breathing again.</p><p>Harry stayed by his side, worried and terrified of what would become of him in the end. War hero or not, Remus was still a werewolf and despite that…</p><p>Harry didn’t understand how being a werewolf would interfere with Remus’ ability to work. It didn’t make any sense! Sure, the moon didn’t help things, but that aside, he managed just fine as a teacher that one year.</p><p>If not for Snape revealing that one little fact, they would have had a permanent Defense Teacher, werewolf or not.</p><p>He never did forgive Snape for that. Remus was his favorite teacher, aside from Minerva.</p><p>Harry sat beside him, reading <em>Quidditch Through the Ages</em> as he waited for Remus to wake again.</p><p>Every day, Teddy and Andromeda would come by to see him. And every day, after an hour, they would leave. Remus’ breathing remained steady and he never woke.</p><p>The days became weeks and while he breathed, he didn’t wake. When the week of the full moon came, they force-fed him the wolfsbane potion.</p><p>Harry insisted on staying in the room despite the warnings of the healers that it wouldn’t be safe. He’d seen Remus when he wasn’t medicated on the potion. How worse would it be <em>with</em> it?</p><p>That night, Harry woke to whimpering. He grabbed his glasses and blinked. He lit his wand:</p><p>The clock read midnight.</p><p>Harry turned to Remus, who was in the midst of transforming. His face elongating, teeth growing sharp as his nails became claws. Harry took one of the hands and squeezed it.</p><p>“You’re okay. I’m here,” he said. “I’m here, Remus.”</p><p>The wolf turned over onto his belly and he stared at Harry for a moment before curling into a ball and sleeping again.</p><p>Would he wake in the morning?</p><p>Would the moon allow him to heal and perhaps go home?</p><p>He stroked the top of Remus’ head, running his hands through the brown fur and down over his body, trying to help the great wolf sleep more soundly if he could. It couldn’t be comfortable for him like this.</p><p>Harry scratched Remus’ back, trying to help him sleep. In the end, he went back to his seat and began to doze. He woke again to the wolf whimpering as the sun crept in the sky. Harry hushed him, helping him through the transformation back to human.</p><p>Remus shook, looking worse for wear. He opened an eye and blinked.</p><p>“Harry?”</p><p>“Hey, Professor,” he said. “Welcome back.”</p><p>“Back?” Remus repeated, “Where…”</p><p>“St. Mungo’s,” Harry said, helping him sit up. “It’s been about a month since the battle. We thought you died at first, but—”</p><p>“What about Dora?” Remus leaned against the pillows. “Where is she?”</p><p>Harry bowed his head. “I’m sorry, Professor. She was hit with a killing curse.”</p><p>Remus blinked, staring at his hands.</p><p>“They already had a funeral for her while you were in a coma. Mrs. Tonks and Teddy come by often. They don’t stay very long, but now that you’re awake, they might stay longer.”</p><p>Remus didn’t respond right away. “Could I be alone for a bit, Harry?”</p><p>“Sure,” he said. “I’ll let the healers know you’re well and get something to eat. Curtains closed?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you.”</p><p>Harry closed them and left the room, wishing there was more he could do to ease the pain Remus must’ve been feeling. He figured he’d get something to eat first before letting the healers know. Give Remus a few minutes to collect himself.</p><p>Harry sat in the cafeteria, eating a bagel and a black coffee while trying to decide what to do next. He’d stay, that was certain.</p><p>At least until Remus didn’t need or want him around anymore. The idea of being sent away didn’t sit well with him. Harry didn’t like it. But then again, it wouldn’t be the first time he had been forced to part from Remus.</p><p>It was always a come-and-go sort of thing. In his third year, he developed a bit of a crush on Remus. He understood the consequences of acting on it and avoided acknowledging his feelings because of the dangers. After he left Hogwarts, Harry had managed to get over his crush, deciding it would be better to pursue girls closer to his age rather than his prolonged crush on Remus.</p><p>That’s all it could be. Harry understood that and for the most part accepted that. Yes, it had hurt when Remus and Tonks married, but he was happy for Remus; also when he was given the honor of being Teddy’s godfather. He didn’t think Remus would see him worthy of being a caretaker or godfather…</p><p>“Hey, Harry,” Hermione said, joining him at the table. “How are you?”</p><p>“Good,” he replied. “Remus is awake. Just giving him time to process…”</p><p>Hermione hummed. “You told him about Tonks.”</p><p>“He asked and he would have found out eventually. It seemed crueler to not tell him.” Hermione took his hand and squeezed it.</p><p>“You don’t need to stay, Harry. He’s awake now.”</p><p>“I know I don’t, but I also can’t leave him. I know he’ll be okay, but…I don’t know.” Hermione arched a brow at him.</p><p>“You love him, don’t you?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t say love.”</p><p>“Harry, you’ve been with Ginny and Cho and have hundreds of girls—even boys—willing to be with you. You can have anyone you want, but you’ve always gone back to pining over Remus.” She grinned. “I think this…crush you keep getting on him isn’t a crush.”</p><p>“Hermione, he doesn’t even like me like that.”</p><p>“How do you know? Maybe he did.”</p><p>“And probably felt guilty over it. He’s my dad’s best friend, Hermione. I can’t just…why would he want me? Probably changed my diapers before.” He shuddered at the thought.</p><p>“Well, I see your point,” she said. “But he didn’t watch you grow up. He didn’t see you until you were thirteen, then only here and there afterward. Now that you’re an adult…let me say I’m not saying take the chance while you can, but you at least have more of a chance now.”</p><p>“Hermione, please shut up.”</p><p>“Just saying,” she said, shrugging.</p><p>“How’s Ron?”</p><p>“Doing better,” she said. “He hates how long it’s taking to get used to his new leg, but there you are.”</p><p>“I’ll visit him around lunch.”</p><p>“He’ll like that,” she said. “Just don’t let him tease you too much, Harry.”</p><p>“As if he could,” Harry said with a snort.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Remus let the healer poke and prod him, making sure that the worse injuries he’d overcome would heal properly. Once the healer left, Harry entered. “Hungry?”</p><p>“More nauseas,” Remus confessed, “For now it’s just focusing on getting hydrated. Broth’s being brought up right now.”</p><p>From there, they entered an awkward silence.</p><p>Harry stretched, letting Remus rest as much as he could with an unsettled stomach, and resumed reading his book. A few minutes pass and the broth is brought up and Remus thanked the witch before spooning it into his mouth little by little.</p><p>Three knocks alerted them to newcomers, so Harry excused himself to admit them. “Remus, would you like to see Teddy?”</p><p>Remus paused and set the spoon down. “He’s here?”</p><p>“Yeah, he and Mrs. Tonks are outside the door.” Remus nodded slowly, pushing the tray and wheeled table away. Harry pulled the screen back and Andromeda sat beside Remus. “I’ll let you catch up,” Harry said, leaving the room.</p><p>He leaned against the door for a moment, contemplating his next move. It wasn’t quite noon yet, but he doubted Ron would be against seeing him sooner than he noted to Hermione.</p><p>So with that, he went to visit his friends in the physical therapy room. There, he saw Ron, face scrunched in pain, trying to walk with his new prosthetic. Harry entered as he finished the exercise and leaned back in his wheelchair.</p><p>“Looks painful,” Harry said. “Or do you also plan on getting a fake magical eye.”</p><p>Ron snorted. “As awesome as it would be to be the next Mad-Eye Moody, I’m not keen on getting my eye gouged out, you see. The leg was enough, thanks.” He approached Harry. “Strange to be looking up at you, Harry.”</p><p>“Strange to be looking down, Ron,”</p><p>“You two are so corny,” Hermione chuckled, closing Witch Weekly. “Who’s hungry?”</p><p>“Starving,” Ron said.</p><p>“Famished,” Harry said. “But not for St. Mungo’s cafeteria food. There’s a McDonald’s a little ways away if anyone likes. Some hamburgers and chips sound good to me.”</p><p>“Same,” Hermione said, pushing Ron’s wheel chair out of the room with Harry holding the door open.</p><p>“McDonald’s?” Ron asked.</p><p>“Muggle fast food place. Like the Leaky,” Hermione said. “Just greasier.”</p><p>“Wicked!”</p><p>“Oh, Ron,” Hermione giggled. “You’re adorable.”</p><p>“You love me anyway.”</p><p>“PDA, guys,” Harry sighed. Ron made kissy noises in retaliation. Hermione punched his shoulder for it.</p><p>“Woman, I’m an invalid! Be nice!”</p><p>“You’re fine, Ron. The worst of your injuries have healed already. It’s just adjusting to your new leg that’s left.” Ron shrugged. Harry signed a couple release papers with the agreement to be back in two hours. With that, they left the premises of St. Mungo’s and headed into London.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>He barely listened to a word Andromeda said, all attention settled on Teddy who had made a game of blowing raspberries at his father in hopes of getting raspberries blown back. Remus was only happy to oblige. “Remus, this is a serious matter,” Andromeda said.</p><p>“Hmm?” He glanced at her and swallowed at the raised eyebrow she gave him. “Sorry, Andy. I just…”</p><p>“I understand. And you need to do something about it quick. The Ministry recognizes your contributions to the war, but they are worried about Teddy.”</p><p>Now he would listen, facing his mother-in-law in rapt attention. “Why? Because I’m a werewolf? I wouldn’t let—”</p><p>“I know. The past arrangements worked out perfectly and I told them as much. But without Dora the situation’s become more complicated. It’s not just the full moon that’s an issue, Remus.”</p><p>He shut his eyes. They planned to fight, intent on surviving. Then…he recalled a flash of green, then a force pushing him aside down a flight of stairs.</p><p>Then all went black.</p><p>He hugged Teddy closer to his chest. “I can’t lose my son.”</p><p>“You won’t. You’re not losing him, Remus. I’ll be taking care of him while you figure it all out.” Andromeda sighed. “I miss her, too. I didn’t want her to be an Auror, but she was always headstrong and raring for a fight or challenge.”</p><p>“I know.” Half of the attraction was how much she was like Sirius. Seemed he was fated to lose those he loved too dearly. He exhaled slowly, nausea overcoming him again. It was too much and he tried to keep the tears at bay, but…</p><p>He handed Teddy back to her reluctantly. “I can’t do this.”</p><p>“You can. You’re stronger than most of us, Remus. You’ve endured so much. You can do this. You can overcome anything. You <em>have</em> overcome so much all ready.”</p><p>“Not alone,” he said, hiding his eyes from her. “Not alone.”</p><p>“You’re not alone,” she said, taking his shoulder and squeezing gently. “You’re still my son-in-law, and the father of my grandson. You have my support. I’m not going to stop you from seeing Teddy. I would never do that.” Remus took her hand and squeezed back. She sighed. “Perhaps I’m pushing too hard, but I don’t want you to be uninformed of what’s going on.”</p><p>“I just woke up. Find out I lost Dora, and now they want me to surrender my son even though I’m here.”</p><p>“That depends on you, Remus. You <em>can</em> fight this. You <em>are</em> a fighter. And I think it’s just as ridiculous that they even <em>think</em> you’d be dangerous to Teddy.” She kissed his forehead. “You’ll be all right.”</p><p>Andromeda stood, Teddy secure in her arms. “We’ll be back tomorrow and see what we can do to set you up at my place. I don’t want you to go to an empty house with just memories to keep you company.” He nodded, kissing the top of Teddy’s head in goodbye before they left. He laid back on the bed and wept anew.</p><p>All of it was overwhelming. It was far too much.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>“You will regret introducing me to McDonald’s,” Ron said between bites of oreo mcflurry. Harry and Hermione laughed. He moaned. “Definitely going to regret it, mate.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head as she licked fudge off the plastic spoon. Harry snorted, dipping a chip into his milkshake. Ron stared at him.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Try it,” Hermione encouraged him.</p><p>“Join us,” Harry said.</p><p>“Join us,” Hermione added, chanting with him. Ron dipped a chip into his mcflurry and tried it. He leaned back in his chair and moaned again.</p><p>“If I get fat, I blame you two.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m sure Hermione will keep you in shape one way or other,” Harry said. Hermione punched his arm. “Ouch. You are a very violent lady, Hermione.”</p><p>“You love me anyway.”</p><p>“That’s beside the point,” Harry said.</p><p>It’d not even been a full month yet and the effects of not fearing for his life anymore…Harry still found it surreal. It took him ages to find it in himself to relax. And yet he still fully couldn’t shake the feeling of caution that had ingrained in him since he was eleven.</p><p>But here, just hanging out in a fast food chain with his best friends, he finally felt something akin to normal despite who he was. No evil wizards trying to kill him. No paparazzi hunting him down in hopes of ruining his reputation. No ministry attempting to discredit him. No one trying to bully him or suck up to him. None of it.</p><p>“So…I told Ginny not to hold her breath but she still might expect you to get back with her,” Ron told Harry. “With how close you’ve been to Lupin, doesn’t seem like you’re interested in getting together with a girl again.”</p><p>“Well, I’m not interested,” he said. “Just I guess I want to figure out who I really am now that I’m not just the Chosen One or the Boy Who Lived. That’s who I am to the rest of the Wizard World, you know? But I’ve never really had a chance to figure out who <em>I </em>am. Does that make sense?”</p><p>“Of course it does,” Hermione said.</p><p>“Yeah, Harry,” Ron added. “Course it makes sense.”</p><p>“And we’ll be right there with you as you figure it all out, if you like.”</p><p>“Always,” Harry said, hugging them both. “More chips on me,” he said.</p><p>“You already paid for the whole lunch and dessert,” Hermione snapped at him as he went back to the front counter. She shook her head. “At this rate, we really could get fat, Ron.”</p><p>“Blame it on Harry. That always works.”</p><p>Hermione arched a brow at him. “Really?”</p><p>“Yes, really.”</p><p>“I can hear you two, you know,” Harry snapped at them from the counter. Ron laughed, clutching his middle, and Hermione blushed.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>When Harry returned to Remus’ room, he found him asleep on his side. The broth had only been partially eaten. Harry frowned at that, but pushed his worry aside. Harry sat down. The chair squeaked under his weight and he picked up where he left off in <em>Quidditch through the Ages</em>.</p><p>“Did you know?” Remus asked.</p><p>“Know what?”</p><p>“That the Ministry wants to take Teddy from me.”</p><p>Harry shut his book, fury boiling his brain. “No,” he said. “I didn’t know. Andromeda never told me.” Remus didn’t respond immediately. “I’ll help in whatever way I can to prevent that, Professor.”</p><p>“I’m not a professor, Harry. They won’t hire me at Hogwarts or any school. Anyplace.”</p><p>Harry silenced.</p><p>He wanted to assure Remus otherwise, but he knew that it would be empty promises and assurances. Instead, he crossed his legs and held the book, trying to think of a way, any way, to help him.</p><p>In the end, he set the book down.  “What if…I hired you?”</p><p>Remus sat up, glaring at him.</p><p>“What? Think about it? I have plenty of money and a house that needs remodeling. At least think about it, won’t you?” He didn’t see why Remus wouldn’t jump at the opportunity, but perhaps he needed time to think it through. Harry would allow that. After all, Remus still had healing to do.</p><p>“I’ll think about it,” Remus said after a moment.</p><p>Harry grinned. “Great. Let me know what you decide to do.”</p><p>“I will,” Remus said. “Thank you, Harry.”</p><p>“Think nothing of it. I’ll see if I can get you some more broth or something.”</p><p>“I’ll take mashed potatoes if they’ll allow it.”</p><p>“Probably not, but I’ll ask.”</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Harry thanked a healer for their help as the order for more broth to be brought to Remus with a <em>small</em> cup of mashed potatoes to go with it. He turned to head back to Remus’ room to let him know food was on the way only to pause in front of Ginny.</p><p>“Still here,” she stated.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“But you’ve healed. You can leave.”</p><p>“I was discharged ages ago. I stay for Ron and Remus.”</p><p>Ginny crossed her arms. “You’ve seen Ron, then? I never saw you.”</p><p>“Well, I think it’s more important for him to be doted on by your mum than me, don’t you think?” Harry stated a little more sharply than he intended. Ginny’s eyebrows rose. “Sorry,” he sighed. “I don’t mean it like that. Yes, I’ve visited. But Ron’s strong. He’ll be okay. He doesn’t need me around much to feel better about where he is.”</p><p>“And Remus?”</p><p>“Woke this morning. He’s still…he’s shaken, you know. After what happened to Tonks…”</p><p>Ginny hummed. “Ron’s convinced you won’t get back with me.”</p><p>“I’m just not…I don’t know if it’d be the best idea.”</p><p>“Harry—”</p><p>“You’re a good friend, but I that’s all I want from you, right now, Ginny. I can’t…I don’t want to be in a relationship with someone right now.” <em>Someone who’s not Remus</em>, his subconscious provided. “I have some soul searching still to do. You do understand, don’t you?”</p><p>“Not really,” Ginny said. “But if you still need time, then take the time you need. But I don’t know how much longer I can wait.”</p><p>“I don’t want you to,” he said, shrugging. Ginny inhaled, unable to mask her hurt. “I’m sorry, that came out wrong.”</p><p>“I don’t think it did. It was what I needed to hear. I tried not to be the over-obsessed fan girl, but I suppose there was only so much I could hope for. I’m sorry for pushing it, Harry.”</p><p>“You didn’t push it. I did love you and I did want to date you at the time. I don’t regret that. I just…I suppose I just don’t know who I am anymore.”</p><p>Ginny squeezed his arm. “If you’re all right with just being friends, then okay. That’s what we were before. I don’t mind being friends again.”</p><p>Harry smiled gently. “Thank you for understanding, Ginny.”</p><p>“Always,” She said.</p><p>With that, she strode past him.</p><p>Harry watched her, quite certain Ginny was more hurt than she let on. He sighed, certain she’d get over him now that she knew he wouldn’t renew their relationship.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t love Ginny. Harry did, just not in the way he thought. The more he thought about it, she, like Hermione, was too much like a sister to him for it to truly be a proper romantic relationship. He ran his hand through his hair and scratched his neck.</p><p>She’d be all right, though. He knew that much. Ginny was a strong woman and a stronger witch. With that assurance in mind, Harry returned to Remus’ side, wondering what would come next.</p><p>For all of them.</p>
