    <p>Lucius Malfoy had fallen in love with Hermione, it was a simple as that. The war was over and it had been revealed that his wife Narcissa had forced him, Lucius, into service to the Dark Lord against his will. She had done it to be closer to her sister.</p><p>He had been freed from Azkaban, where he had been sent after the war, and all charges were dropped. He had applied for and was given a position at Hogwarts teaching Defence against the Dark Arts. Hermione had been given a job as the Potions Mistress at around the same time.</p><p>In the months that followed their dual appointments Lucius had become aware of just how beautiful Hermione had become and how very much she had matured. She had quickly become the object of his darkest and most secret fantasies. His lust for her was starting to take over most of his waking thoughts. He wanted to get closer to her. He needed to find a way he could get closer to her.</p><p>He had a plan, though. He would ask her to make a speech in his class about how potions could help when it came to protecting oneself from the Dark Arts. He had run the idea past the HeadMaster and he had given his approval. He planned on having Hermione give the speech on Friday afternoon, and then he would ask her to join him for coffee the following day. It would be the weekend and the students would not have lessons.</p><p>Hermione arrived at his classroom very early as she wanted to make sure she was well prepared to give her lecture. She knocked on his door.</p><p>"Enter," came a voice so smooth it made her wet almost instantly, much to her surprise. </p><p>She pushed open the big wooden door and with a creaking sound it opened. Lucius was standing at the front of the classroom wearing black trousers and a crisp white shirt underneath his black teaching robes which were unbuttoned. His golden blonde hair was tied back in a black ribbon.</p><p>She never realised how how stunning a man he was and was taken aback at her own reaction to him. He looked like a God!</p><p>"Hello, Professor Malfoy, I am sorry that I'm so early, but I was hoping to set up my stuff before my lecture?"</p><p>"Call me Lucius, my dear, we are colleagues, there is no need to be overly formal."</p><p>"Only if you call me Hermione."</p><p>He nodded in reply.</p><p>Hermione walked to the front of the room and placed her purple beaded bag on the desk. She'd had this bag since before the war and wouldn't dream of using anything else; it had an undetectable extension charm placed upon it. She opened it up, reached inside and started pulling out everything that she would need to teach her lesson.</p><p>Lucius watched as she unpacked everything. She was extremely organised; making sure that everything was in its place. He knew that she had always been like this, everything had to be perfect; everything had to be in order.</p><p>As she was setting her potion bottles on the desk, she accidentally tipped one over and it rolled off the table. She reached over to pick it up, bending down. She had the most stunning arse of anyone he had ever seen. Oh, how he wanted to bend her over and take her right there on the desk.</p><p>He reached down and buttoned up his robes to cover up his massive bulge. He did not want her knowing just hot and horny the mere glimpse of her arse had made him.</p><p>Hermione, however, had noted his reaction only too clearly. Seeing what bending over had done to him she decided to tease him a little bit. She wanted him and could tell that he wanted her as well. They had time before the students showed up, they could ward the doors and have a bit of fun.</p><p>She bent over again, pushing her arse up just enough so that Lucius could see she wasn't wearing anything under her skirt. A very low growl came out of his mouth.</p><p>"Did you say something, Lucius?" Hermione asked, innocently.</p><p>Lucius knew that this was his chance. She wanted him as bad as he wanted him. He pulled out his wand and warded the door. He walked over to her and she stood up.</p><p>"Hermione, let us get past all of this petty teasing," he started to kiss her neck.</p><p>"We both know you want me as badly as I want you."</p><p>He slowly lowered his hand and began to unbutton her shirt in a leisurely fashion as he kissed the other side of her neck.</p><p>"We both want this and we have time. Before the students get here."</p><p>He started to rub her breasts before sliding his other hand behind her neck and pulling her in for a kiss. He started slowly as to not scare her. She deepened the kiss and began to bite his bottom lip. He reached down and started rubbing her opening, she was already dripping wet. He lifted her up and she wrapped her legs around him. He spun her around and placed her on top of his desk. He knelt before her and spread her legs open.</p><p>Her scent filled his nose, he needed to have her, now.</p><p>He started rubbing her again and slowly pushed his finger inside her. Damn, she was tight. He started licking her, circling over her clit. She was so reactive and so wet he needed to be inside her, and fast. Flipping her over so she was bent over his desk, he saw her brace her forearms for support. He pointed his wand at her and muttered a contraceptive charm.</p><p>He unbuttoned his pants and pulled out his massive erection. Placing it at her opening he let it rest there for a minute, teasing her, making her want it.  </p><p>"Please, Lucius, I need you in me. Now."</p><p>Oh, how delightful it was to hear this little Gryffinwhore beg. He thrust into her in one hard fast motion, waiting a few seconds to let her recover before continuing.</p><p>"Please ," she begged. "More, I need more."</p><p>He started thrusting hard and fast into her tight cunt. Her breasts were bouncing off the surface of the desk.</p><p>"More! Fill me! More ..." she panted, in between her gasps for air.</p><p>"You want more? I'll give you more, my little Gryffinwhore Princess."</p><p>He pulled himself out of her.</p><p>"What? Lucius ... please, I need you. I need you back inside me now, please don't stop!"</p><p>He placed his member at her back hole.</p><p>"Oh, my dear you will indeed have more. As much as you can take."</p><p>He slowly pushed into her puckered hole. She let out a scream. Good thing he kept his class room warded and silenced.</p><p>Just then the classroom door opened; someone had broken his wards but at that moment he couldn't care less, he had a sexy young witch bent over his desk and his cock in her arse. Also it was not just any witch but Hermione-fucking-Granger, war heroine.</p><p>He heard footsteps and looked up to see that it was his closest friend, Severus Snape.</p><p>"Well well,  Lucius, it appears you have finally procured a good one."</p><p>Hermione reacted instantly. She knew that voice. Very well, in fact.</p><p>"Severus. Why don't you come and join us?" Lucius drawled.</p><p>Severus walked over to them, raised his wand and transfigured the desk into a king sized bed. Lucius climbed onto the bed pulling Hermione on top of him. He plunged back into her tight arsehole.</p><p>Severus climbed onto the bed, already naked. He placed his member against Hermione's opening. He thrust into her, and him and Lucius soon found a perfect synchronisation of their movements. She was so very close.</p><p>"My dear, come with us." Severus said in his dark velvet voice.</p><p>They each thrust into her harder, releasing themselves into her holes, filling her up. Her toes curled and she let out a scream of pure pleasure. They lay there together for a few minutes trying to catch their breath.</p><p>"You, my lovely Princess, really must take us both on another time. Might I suggest tomorrow? There are no classes so we will have all day. Meet us at Malfoy Manor at nine am sharp, and don't expect to leave until Sunday night." Lucius said.</p><p>They all got up and dressed. Lucius transfigured the bed back into his desk. Severus pulled out his wand.</p><p>"Accio Potions."</p><p>Almost instantly three energy replenishing potions were in his hand. He handed one to Lucius, one to Hermione as he drank one himself.</p><p>"Hmmm, I must make more for this weekend." He mused.</p><p>Severus turned and left the room as the students began to enter the room and find their way to their seats. Lucius could only sit at his desk and watch this beautiful witch teach her lesson. This weekend would be the best weekend of his life.</p>
