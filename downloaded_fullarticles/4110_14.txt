          <div class="userstuff"><p>You slump there on the ground, in the midst of the fire and chaos.<br/>It lights your face up, and I have never seen such beauty. <br/>Is this what love is?</p><p>***</p><p>You are a mess. I watch you. If only you knew. <br/>Tears drip down your cheek. <br/>You deserve better than Dumbledore. But you can’t see it. <br/>Wonderfully oblivious. </p><p>***</p><p>My love for you is like a rose. Beautiful but sharp. <br/>You are dazzling. You are the sun, and I am just the planets, spinning around you. It’s always been that way, before I myself knew it. </p><p>*** <br/>I watch you. You look happy. <br/>But why? You have nothing. <br/>We are opposites. And yet I’m falling, falling, falling for you.<br/>Will it always be like this? <br/>My love is dragging me under. </p><p>***</p><p>You are crushed. I heard the criminal, Sirius Black, was finally extinguished. <br/>You attempt to hide it, but you are bad at that. You always have been. <br/>You’re too young for this evil.<br/>We all are. <br/> I want you. So badly.</p><p>*** </p><p>It’s been too long. But now I have you. <br/>Thank God. <br/>You admit that you always wanted me. <br/>How happy that made me feel, you will never know. <br/>We are like magnets. <br/>Pulling to each other. </p><p>***</p><p>You grasp my hand in yours. <br/>I beg you not to leave. <br/>You say you must. You say it’s for the greater good. <br/>Fuck the greater good, I reply.<br/>I need you.<br/>You shake your head slowly. A tear drips down from my cheek. You reach to wipe it away. <br/>I’ve waited for so long. Will it come to nothing?<br/>You pull me into a final searing kiss. It burns me from the inside out.<br/>Will it be our last? </p><p>***</p><p>You were too good to be true. Gold-plated. <br/>And now you’re gone. To him. <br/>I never knew heartbreak before now. <br/>He laughs. But he never knew love, so he wouldn’t understand. <br/>Screams of anguish rip from our throats. <br/>You are our flag. You are our patriot. <br/>You are my love. </p><p>***</p><p>You are not dead. How? <br/>I am glad. There’s nothing like love. <br/>The first thing I do is kiss you. You pull me close.<br/>I don’t think I can let go.</p></div>
