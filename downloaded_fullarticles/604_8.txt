    <p>Harry took a shuttering breath as he passed through the courtyard and around the bends of the once familiar grounds. Passing Hagrid's hut where students were happily chattering on about summer plans soon to come. The walls had long since been fixed but there were just some things that spells and plasters couldn't fix. Such as the fact that, even when awake these days, Harry would blink and see the battle behind his eyes. </p><p>The dreams had been coming for sometime- since Cedric Diggory if he were honest- but with each new fallen friend, foe or classmate they had grown. It coming to head recently, some near ten years the day, that the dreams had begun making him wild. Recently, with the tenth year approaching fast, old aches had been coming back. Then with the recent deaths of some of his fellow aurors..... Well, the man deemed himself ready for a change of pace. He needed closure...and perhaps a change in profession. </p><p> He'd felt truly himself when training the other students in secret all those years ago, and had honestly been contemplating such for a few years. When he finally made it to the shack, sliding down with a wince from his old knee ache as he did, the young man of 29 breathed a heavy sigh.</p><p> His clothes were rumpled, hair a nest befitting a rat mightier than Wormtail and eyes hollowed and bagged. The flask in his pocket clanged a bit on the hard ground, the shack in mere remnants of what was left. </p><p>"Well hello professor." he sighed to no one.</p><p>"I just may have had a taste of that fish oil that made you so bitter."</p><p>Severus wondered aimlessly around the room. It had been a long and lonely ten years with nothing to do but explore the dead property. The wallpaper was graying with age, the wood floors were dry and cracked, everything was covered in a thick layer of dust. An irritant that could have been fixed with the simplest of magic that he could no longer use. </p><p>Every day he wondered the grounds, exploring every room of the shrieking shack. He knew every piece of furniture, every crack in the walls, he knew how many stairs there were, every grave on the property. What he didn't know was the last time someone had been to the shack. He relived nearly daily the way in which he died, he knew Voldemort would kill him, and if he hadn't drunk that potion before the battle, his soul would have been lost, doomed to the life of a painting forever sleeping. </p><p>Instead he was able to attach his soul to a stone nearby, in the shrieking shack. What he didn't anticipate was only being able to travel within the property in which the object was. As much as Severus had fronted his hatred for everyone in his life, he was alone, he craved interaction, he missed his potions, his fellow teachers, he even thought for a moment that he might miss the heathens that were his students. </p><p>He was sure after ten long years he would have been forgotten by now. Who would care to remember their greasy potions master. He continued to wonder around, laying in the bed, though he couldn't feel it, or really lay in it, but only float near it. He heard just then the scraping of dirt on the ground floor, and the voice of a man. He waited there silently, hiding himself.</p><p>Harry leaned more heavily against the wall, exhaustion tugging his eyes shut temptingly only to snap open once more. His breath came in pants as he forced himself up off of the dirt floor. His glasses skittered off with the jolt, forcing to groan. He leaned even more so against the wall, his hand rubbing his trick knee. He'd acquired it long ago- another skele-grow incident with far less success.</p><p>The potion had been faulty and left him with an aching knee to nurse as well as a drained ego. </p><p>"That's bloody brilliant" he chuckled, stifling a groan.</p><p>"Now my knee and my eyes are determined to age me." His voice was chuckling, but it held no humor. </p><p>"How did you deal with them? Those sleepless nights? I'm sure you've had your share."</p><p>Through the walls and many flights of stairs that lead from the top floor of the shrieking shack to the womping willow that stood on Hogwarts grounds, Severus went, leading him to a crippled looking man, probably near 30, with round glasses. He was dressed nicely but sloppily and hastily making a pathetic attempt to pick up his glasses whilst clutching his knee. </p><p>He floated there in front of the man, invisible for now, puzzled until the moment the man stood up right once more, revealing a faded white lightning bolt scar on his forehead. Potter. He thought of revealing himself then but held back, wondering Potter's intentions. He must be 28... no 29. He noted then the missing wedding band on his finger. What was a 29 year old Harry Potter doing at the shrieking shack.</p><p>The man seemed lost in thought, gritting his teeth before letting out a defeated sounding sigh. A sigh that seemed blasphemous from the lips of a Gryffindor. The deflating of tired shoulders as he used the wall for support revealed just how little the man had grown. He was no where near the height of one James Potter in his 21 year of life. Hell, this man barely scraped Lily's height of 5'4. He had the telling first flecks of silver roots on the side that broadcasted the lightening scar; no doubt stress gray from the placement of it It could fade with proper food and a new-apparently less vigorous-lifestyle. </p><p>"Twenty-four" he said suddenly, reaching into his pocket for an ornate flask, the proud symbol of the Auror emblazed on it. </p><p>"I managed to kill twenty bloody four more men with a single mistake." he chuckled, the sound....hollow.</p><p>It left a pike of ice to skewer Severus' chest. He took a hearty swig straight from the flask as he stared out in the distance. </p><p>"24 more faces ill be seeing.....well, cheers to the happy few." He said,raising the flask to dry lips, still missing his glasses. Until something that almost felt like a...smack to hand sent his flask skittering away from him. </p><p>"Ah for Merlin's sake!" he growled, seeming for a moment to get that spark from his early school days before it left him, the exhaustion from clearly several weeks-or longer-without proper sleep had worn him. It was also clear from his blind groping about that he may need a little help in locating his two items, the flask having skidded not too far from the spectacles. Luckily it seemed that first drink of the flask was the only one Harry had, had that day.</p><p>Severus was shocked, how pathetic he thought to himself. Potter was once a proud, irritating child. These days he thought they sounded more alike than different. And alcoholism, a shameful addiction. Admittedly Severus used to enjoy a half glass of smooth white rum from time to time, but he had never been so ashamed as to carry a flask in his robes whilst he stumbled about the castle mumbling about his many murders! Severus took the flask and hid it in a nearby wall, careful that Potter didn't notice. Perhaps he meant to stay here to get away from that greedy job of his, he could then observe his behavior, attempt to contact him, he wondered if Harry could get him out of this wretched creaky shack. He continued to hide in the shadows.</p><p>If Potter was traumatized by his job, he could more than understand. Being a death eater did not come easily, but it did come at a cost. Killing innocent wizards and muggles alike, along with his friend, Albus Dumbledore, someone who cared for him and watched over him not only during school but in life as well. He knew Dumbledore would have died anyway, but it didn't make killing him easier. He quickly put it from his mind, bringing his attention back to Potter.</p><p>The man moved with difficulty, clearly used to being able to move fine on the leg. It being affected by the misty weather would explain why the young man didn't appear to own a cane. It would normally be fine if not for sudden temperature drops. But at the moment it seemed to pain the man to a point of needing the walls and broken furniture like crutches, his feet shuffling and sliding cautiously, as though expecting his spectacles to materials under them and be crushed </p><p>"Right bloody mess ya've got ya'self in Potter" he growled to himself in self deprecation. </p><p>"Ya take ya first sip of the creature in three bloomin' years and ya lose your specs like a bloody primary schooler on his way to the swing set!" </p><p>Honestly, he had hated fire whiskey, especially the green apple kind that was currently in his flask; but he liked the reminder of a particularly handsome fellow by the name of Andrews who'd often invited harry to partake though he'd always said no. If he had had the sight to see what would have happened to the ginger, he never would have gotten out of bed.... Hell, he may have accepted Andrews's invite to a private drink the night before. Then neither would have been at work to receive that mission. </p><p>If potter hadn't been there, maybe there would not have had to have been 24 bloody memorials set up in the lounge of the Auror HQ. After that, he went home and got out the flask. They had all received them as graduation gifts, but his had remained unopened from its box until that day. He then filled it with that scorching, over sweet liquor and headed out, no clear destination in mind. He'd just ended up here. It felt like he belonged there,like something was calling him.</p><p>As all this time had gone by, his shuffling had stopped without his knowing, he slowly sank into one of the old chairs, head rested in hand. And then ended up on the floor with a solid clock to his head when the dilapidated seat gave way. He grabbed something, thin, smooth and dark and he grasped it with a groan, thinking it one of the supports of his glasses only to find-with an odd wrenching jolt to his chest-that it was a mist polished stone. </p><p>He felt a sudden rush overcoming the numbness in his chest, anger, pain, loneliness, annoyance, But found-when he'd raised the cursed rock over his head in petulant indignation-that he couldn't let it go. In fact he found himself lowering it back down to stare at it, feeling an odd surging need to just....cry. Or sleep. Or both. He of course refrained from either. And, as he pocketed the stone and continued on hands and knees until his glasses were recovered, found that he did not much mind the feeling. Nor did he notice that he was not alone in the odd jolt that had plagued him a moment before.</p><p>Snape watched as Harry picked up the stone he attached his soul to. A small, smooth, black stone that sat there on the floor. As he picked it up he felt a wild mix of emotions sadness, regret, all of which he presumed to be Potter's. Without having to ask, he understood in that moment exactly how he felt, almost as if he shared Potter's emotions, as if he had been there. He approached then, still keeping his distance in the corner of the room, he appeared then, faintly, watching him from the darkness. </p><p>"Why are you here Potter"</p><p>The man shot up, wand out and eyes searching. If it was ghost, he'd have been fine but this felt.....different. The timber of the voice warning but acting like an almost poisonous catnip to the Auror. It was familiar in a way that sent shivers down his spine, but....distorted, like he was hearing the tail end of an echo from a jagged cliff face. He found his hand clutching the stone in his pocket, his momentary leap in anxiety assuage by the odd grounding, protective effect it had. </p><p>"Show yourself before i send you to meet the reaper." he barked.</p><p>His caution and anxiety overflowed to the specter, even though Harry's voice masked it with dangerous confidence he'd learned to fake.</p><p>It was then that Snape saw the clear details of Harry's gaunt face, eye bags purple like Dumbledore's favorite robes, skin ashen and lips chapped. His eyes were so blood shot the dark lord could take notes. All in all, the man looked like death warmed thrice over.</p><p>He watched the fear in his eyes grow, masked by skill but not hidden from him. Teaching the boy occlemency as a student was irritating and difficult, he taught the boy some but gave up after his intrusion of privacy. He felt Potter's emotions flow through him as he clutched the stone in his pocket, empty threats he thought to himself. </p><p>Severus moved out from the shadows, arms crossed, face stern, his ghostly cloak seemed endless. Potter looked tired- worn even, like he hadn't seen a stress-less day in all those ten years. </p><p>"I am the reaper" he joked sternly</p><p>"Lumos!" He said suddenly,his throat tight....but not completely in fear. </p><p>He remembered that tone, the mocking baritone.....if only he could hear it clearly. He felt....hope. But quickly it was squashed to be replaced by dizziness, the quick movements eating away and instilling him a bit of vertigo. His Auror training kept him calm and upright, Snape feeling it as the young man tried to detach himself and focus. The light revealed nothing but his own shadow and features. New scars riddled his neck and arms from hexes, as well as the old one from Umbridge's quill. </p><p>"Stop being a bloody tosser and show yourself!" he finally snapped, that Gryffindor pride and reckless bravery rearing its head in a mixture of potters own bravado and annoyance at the situation.  </p><p>He began to slowly back up, close to the stair that would take him to the loft bedroom. If he could get there he might be able to call his broom. But not before he gave this ass a proper left hook. All of these longing and emotions being firmly broadcasted to the professor from the near skin breaking grip harry unwittingly had on the sharp stone.</p><p>For in his eyes, all he saw was a shadow attached to his own, while the voice rippled all around him. He longed for rest, and even though some traitorous part of him cooed that he knew exactly who the ass was, his barriers told him to escape, not step closer as he was wanting.</p><p>He felt a spark of longing in Potter, some motive keeping him there still, waiting to see what happens next, knowing deep down somewhere it was him. Severus emerged slowly into the light where his apparition was fully visible. He stood there nearly 6 feet from Potter who was still shakily trying to get up, trying to pretend not to run the other direction. He watched as the young man calmed some, no longer wishing to attack. </p><p>"What have you done to yourself Potter.."</p><p> </p>
