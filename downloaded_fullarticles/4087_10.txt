          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco and Harry were relaxing in bed with their arms around each other, listening to music and talking in low voices. Needless to say, they were having a nice time just being each other. That was until all of a sudden the door burst open.</p><p>Seamus Finnigan stood there. And weirdly enough, in his arms was a sheep. </p><p>"Guys!" He said excitedly. "Guess what I just named my sheep!"</p><p>"Uh, I dunno," Harry said. </p><p>"I don't really care." Draco deadpanned from his other side. </p><p>"I named it 'drarry'!" Seamus said, ignoring Draco, and still sounding way too excited for either of the others. "Because I 'sheep' you guys!" </p><p>"..." said Harry. </p><p>He could've named it 'deamus', he thought with a small smirk, but Seamus liked Dean Thomas more than just as a friend. </p><p>"...and I still don't really care," was Draco's answer.</p></div>
