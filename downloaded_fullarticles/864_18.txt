    <p>   "Harry Potter! Who is the best legal guardian you know?!" A loud boisterous voice yelled from down in the living room. The front door slammed closed and Harry smiled. Sirius had come home with a surprise. He jumped off his bed and raced down the three flights of stairs between his room and the main level, almost running over Kreacher in the process. The small house elf was carrying a stack of freshly cleaned laundry for Sirius that blocked his face from sight. Harry darted to the left to avoid him.</p><p>   "Watch yourself, there!" He grumbled through the clothes. Harry laughed out an apology and jumped the last few steps.</p><p>   "Did you get them?" He asked panting. "Them" being tickets to the Quidditch World Cup which Harry and Sirius had been planning on attending for over a month. Sirius smiled and waved the tickets in a flashy manner. Harry cheered and ran over for a hug. He broke away to look at the tickets. He studied them hungrily. This only added to the anticipation.</p><p>   "Now, Arthur and I got our tent site all arranged so their next to each other. We're going to have a tent for the adults, the kids and one for the girls, Hermione and Ginny, and of course Hermione is coming. I bought her ticket and I already talked to her parents. She's on her way over here, now! Ron is too.They're going to stay the week. We'll be meeting the rest of the Weasley's and the Diggary's as well, I believe, Monday morning to catch the Portkey to the stadium. This is it, Harry, your first world cup!!" Sirius excitedly recited the plan. He went to the kitchen and broke out the butter beer. Harry took a mug and sat down in the newly renovated kitchen. They had painted it a light sandy color and put in white cabinets and counter tops. Six wood stools stood around half the kitchen island. Sirius had been working hard to lighten up the originally Gothic house. They'd even gone so far as to knock down a couple walls.</p><p>   "What was your first World Cup like?" Harry asked. Sirius smiled reminiscently. </p><p>   "Well, it was in Europe at the time. Ireland vs. Someone. Almost everyone spoke different languages but that's just part of the World Cup's atmosphere anywhere, I think. It was just your dad, Lupin and I. Peter didn't go. Neither did your mum. It was so fun. We got so hammered. And of course our team won. We partied until dawn." Sirius said raising his eyebrows. Harry laughed. </p><p>   A knock at the front door interrupted their conversation. His friends had arrived. Harry excitedly ran to the front of the house and threw it open. Ron and Hermione stood on the porch, suitcases sitting behind them. They all crashed together into a group hug. Harry had been a bit lonely over the summer while his uncle worked. Seeing his friends again was a bit of a relief. Sirius walked in from the kitchen and greeted the pair of kids at his door.</p><p>   "It's good to see you again, Ron, Hermione!" Sirius said grabbing them each into a quick hug. He grabbed their suitcases and picked them up. He smiled at a neighbor and then came inside. Since they removed the hiding spell from the house, it had become a lot easier for visitors to find them. They weren't quite as worried about hiding anymore.</p><p>   "So this is the new house, aye Harry?" Ron commented looking around. They were standing in the living room which had been decorated in warm colors.</p><p>   "Yeah, Sirius inherited it from his family so we've been fixing it up and trying to make it less gloomy and depressing. It took awhile, we're still not done with Kreacher's room and the attic." He explained. Hermione beamed.</p><p>   "I think it looks lovely!" She exclaimed.</p><p>   "Thank you, dear. Let me show you to your rooms. I had Kreacher set up two rooms on Harry's floor, it's three flights up, hope you don't mind but that was Harry's choice." Sirius started leading up the stairs. Harry liked being so high up in the house. It would take longer for anyone to reach him up there. They passed the second floor landing which had various photos of Harry, Sirius, James and Lily. Hermione stopped and looked over them. She smiled and touched the corner of a framed photo of Harry as a baby. He was flailing in a bath tub looking happy. They continued back up the stairs. When they reached the top Sirius led them into the first room.</p><p>   "Hermione, this is you. There's an attached bathroom too." Sirius pointed. He put her suitcase on the big canopy bed. The room was decorated in a pink frilly manner.</p><p>   "Ron you're next door." Sirius explained. He pulled his suitcase into the next room which was mostly blue.</p><p>   "You'll be using the bathroom across the hall." Sirius pointed out. Ron and Hermione joined them back in the hall.</p><p>   "I'll make dinner, you three can catch up." Sirius said leaving the friends to stand in the hall.</p><p>   "This is my room down at the end." Harry pointed. They followed him to the room which had been decorated in foresty colors. His Firebolt hung up on the wall and an ornate perch stood in the corner where Hedwig slept. Harry sat back on his bed so Ron and Hermione made themselves comfortable too. </p><p>   "I can't believe the World Cup is only in seven short days. The best night of my life is in seven short sweet days." Ron blurted. Harry laughed. He was excited too but Ron's enthusiasm still seemed to outweigh his own.</p><p>   "I'm excited to meet all the fantastic witches and wizards in attendance. You know, <em>all</em> of the Ministry is going to be there." She said excitedly. Ron looked at her incredulously.</p><p>   "Hermione, it's a Quidditch match! You go for the game, not the people!" He shouted. Hermione rolled her eyes. Hedwig woke up and screeched.</p><p>   "Oh look, you woke the owl." Hermione scolded. Harry laughed again. He got up and opened the huge window so Hedwig could fly out. Then he closed it and sat back down.</p><p>   "How's life, Harry? What are you and Sirius up to?" Hermione asked.</p><p>   "Good, really good. Sirius is an Auror for the Ministry. He loves the job. It was hard at first, since he's been gone so long but he's adjusted to work well. He's dating a muggle right now. She owns the coffee shop down the street. Her name is Alma. She's pretty sweet. We've also been catching up on all the Wizarding World's news and sports since both of us were kind of isolated. The house already came with Kreacher, the house elf, who was foul but he's getting better now. It's been a bit lonely here by myself though." Harry explained. Life had been going pretty well for Harry and Sirius.</p><p>   "What about you guys?" He asked.  </p><p>   "Well, everyone's been well. Percy got a rubbish job at the Ministry, now he's all high and mighty. He's only an assistant. Fred and George have been working on these new joke products that are brilliant in my opinion, been experimenting all summer. They call 'em Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Mum's furious though. They didn't get as many O.W.L.s as she was hoping for. Then she found out about their Joke stuff and how they were planning to sell them at Hogwarts. That was a big fight. Oh, and the owl Sirius gave me, he's on his way right now. He's amazing. He's so big the only window he fits through is the one in the kitchen. He likes to talk to my mum too. She just loves him. Also Bill and Charlie are in town for the cup! They'll be going with us. They're really cool you'll like them." Ron blurted.</p><p>   "I've spent all summer reading up on Quidditch history. Britain hasn't hosted the world cup in thirty years! It'll be so cool to be a part of this historical match." She said excitedly. </p><p>   "Oh shut it, Hermione!" Ron replied. They all laughed again.</p><p>   "Hey, earlier Sirius mentioned we would need new dress robes for school, any idea what that's about?" He asked. The others shook their heads. </p><p>   "Bill and Charlie keep dropping hints that something out of the ordinary will happen this year but they won't say what it is. Probably has something to do with that." Ron suggested. Harry scratched his head in thought. A quiet knock on the door interrupted his thinking. Kreacher shuffled in the room liking a bit sour. He looked at each of them before speaking in his gravely tone.</p><p>   "Dinner is ready in the dining room, masters." He said with a bow. </p><p>   "Thanks Kreacher, we'll be down in a minute." Harry responded. Kreacher shuffled out and disappeared, the way he often did which was very suddenly and without explanation. They all stood up and followed him out. Ron and Harry raced down the stairs while Hermione trailed behind admiring the house as she descended. They went to the dining room and sat down at the table with Sirius. It was covered in steaming dishes of delicious food. Sirius and Kreacher could whip up a good meal when they were getting along. The four of them feasted, joked and laughed all night. Harry was starting to feel the warm glow that being home left in his heart. He'd never have thought just a few short years ago that this would be his life now. </p>
