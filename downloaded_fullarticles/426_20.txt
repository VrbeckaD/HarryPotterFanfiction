    <p>Warm soapy water cooled rapidly on his hands as he dried the dishes. Each dish he carefully put away, so not to break them and gain a punishment. Except for the last utensil, a sharp carving knife. As Harry dried it, the knife cut into the tip of his finger. In shock Harry dropped the knife and examined the bead of blood glistening on the tip of his finger, the pain had disappeared as soon as it had come. </p><p>Quickly he picked up the knife from the floor and hid it in his pocket, mentally thanking Dudley for being overweight. It meant the pockets in his pants were bigger allowing for the knife to be hidden. Harry hung the drying towel in the cupboard under the sink and placed the drying rack there as well before making his way back to his cupboard to await further orders.</p><p>Once back in his cupboard Harry pulled the knife from his pocket and examined it. The blade was thin and about as long as his hand, and sharp, very sharp. He liked the way it shined it the single ray of light that came in through the vent. The handle was an ordinary black plastic, that fit his hand almost perfectly. The handle was slightly too big for his hand, the black edges gently cut into his skin, giving Harry a sense of comfort. </p><p>A door opened. Harry’s eyes widened as he rushed to stash the knife under his pillow. He almost didn’t hide it in time as Vernon Dursley yanked the door on the cupboard open. </p><p>“Freak! Clean this floor. How dare you leave the floor muddy!” Vernon said, harshly pulling Harry from the cupboard, showing him the fresh mud he had tracked in.</p><p>“Yes Uncle Vernon,” Harry looked morosely at the mud.</p><p>He went back into the cupboard as soon as Vernon released him and grabbed the mop, bucket, and cleaner. He carried the bucket into the kitchen and put it into the sink and turned on the water. Carefully he measured out a bit of cleaner and poured it into the water before turning the tap off. Using what little strength he had Harry lifted the heavy bucket from the sink and went back to clean the mud from the hallway floor. </p><p>Harry took his time cleaning the mud, making sure he got every speck there was, so that he wouldn’t be punished. He then grabbed the bucket and made his way back to the kitchen and dumped the dirty water down the sink. making sure to thoroughly clean the sink afterwards. Glancing toward the clock Harry went to the fridge to get the food for dinner. He knew he had to start it before Aunt Petunia got home from her weekly gossip group.<br/>
He took out a cooking sheet and placed the meat on it, putting it in the oven. Then he cooked the corn and sliced up vegetables for a salad. Sneaking bits for himself, knowing that he wasn’t going to be permitted to eat. It had been three days since his last meal.</p><p>Just as he was placing the food on the table, Aunt Petunia entered. She started squabbling on about the neighbors and their drama. He sighed, quietly, before walking into the parlor and stating that dinner was ready. Luckily for him Dudley was staying over at a friend’s house. </p><p>“Go to your cupboard, I don’t want to see you,” Petunia glared daggers at him.</p><p>Not bothering to respond he did just that. Anything to get away from his relatives. Why couldn’t he have a loving family? Why did they have to be drunks and get themselves killed?</p><p>Harry wondered about his family all night before the darkness overtook him. When he woke, it was still dark out. With no clock to glance at, he took the darkness as very late in the night. He pushed himself to a sitting position, his hand brushing over something cold. It was the knife. Carefully he pulled it out from under his pillow. Holding it up he was barely about to make it out in the darkness. </p><p>He touched the blade, the coolness was a nice little shock. He stared at the blade, running his finger over the smooth metal surface , envying the sharpness of the blade. He gently placed the blade on his wrist, pressing down. But not hard enough to cut.</p><p>Would anyone care if he died?</p><p>Why should he live? He’s a freak.</p><p>He wasn’t good enough.</p><p>Freakish things happened around him.</p><p>Nobody wanted him.</p><p>Harry’s list went on. Finally he lifted the knife and venomously slashed as his left wrist. </p><p>He gasped at the pain, but was in awe at the blood heavily flowing from the cut. Then he cut his other wrist and laid back. The loss of blood was starting to make him light headed. </p><p>Then it went dark.</p><p>___________--------____________--------________</p><p>“Harry James Potter. Born July 31st 1980. Died  August 1st, 1988 at age eight. Cause of death suicide,” a deep ominous voice called into the darkness, jolting Harry awake. “You Mr. Potter are to be punished from taking your own life.”<br/>
“What do you mean?” Harry tried to see the person through the dark.</p><p>“You are to become a Shinigami or Grim Reaper as punishment. You will reap souls until you're forgiven. When you wake, get dressed and meet us in room 203.”</p><p>Harry felt himself fall. </p><p> </p><p>__________----------__________----------__________</p><p>He jolted awake to a sitting position. Blinking at the blurriness. He held a hand to his face, noticing it wasn’t blurry. He was nearsighted, it seemed. He hadn’t needed glasses before. Looking around Harry managed to make out a pair on the nightstand. He grabbed them and shoved the nuisance on his face. Finally able to Harry looked at the plain white room that held a bed, nightstand, wardrobe, and washbasin. </p><p>Hanging off the wardrobe was a freshly pressed charcoal colored suit. Reminding him to get dressed and find room 203. </p><p>Quickly Harry got up and splashed his face with the frigid water in the basin, shivering a little. Then dressed in the charcoal trousers, white shirt, vest, and coat. Turning he caught his appearance in the small mirror above his basin, he was a tad paler than usual and his hair was parted in the middle gently waving away from his face. Lifting one eyebrow he shrugged, at least his hair wasn’t a bird’s nest anymore. But his eyes were a sickly bright yellow green. He stepped back unsure of them. Harry quickly turned from the mirror unsettled by his sickly green eyes, and headed for the door.</p><p>Leaving his room was harder than he expected it to be. He wasn’t prepared to be lost in the endless white hall outside his room. Quickly turning back into his room, he pushed back against his door groaning. He slid down into a crouch, overwhelmed. He sat there unaware of the time passing.</p><p>“Mr. Potter?” A sharp voice pulled him from his thoughts, “Are you in here?” </p><p>“Um, yes! Give me one second please!” Harry jumped up from the floor and opened the door to a black haired man. </p><p>“Mr. Potter, I’m William T. Spears. I was asked to locate you, when you didn’t show up to room 203.” The man looked down at Harry, eyebrows lifting at how young he was.</p><p>Harry put his head down, “I’m sorry. I wasn’t sure where room 203 was.”</p><p>“No matter. Follow me.” William started walking, making Harry trot along to keep up. </p><p>Harry looked around the hallway, noting each room number as they passed. They continued walking, eventually walking past room 203.</p><p>“Mr. Spears, sir. We’ve walked past room 203.” Harry spoke gently tugging at his coat. </p><p>“Room 203 is not of importance anymore, Mr. Potter. I was asked to personally train you to be a grim reaper. Please follow me, we are behind schedule and I do not want to work over time.” </p><p>William left Harry behind as he digested the information, he had to rush to catch up to WIlliam. </p><p>__________----------__________----------___________</p><p>“The first thing you must know about being a grim reaper is that we don’t kill anyone who is not on the To Die List. We are here to decide whether or not someone dies, then we collect their souls. We do this by watching their cinematic records…”</p><p>Harry listened as William went on about soul collection.</p><p>__________----------__________----------___________</p><p>Harry had passed his exams. He had worked hard, pushing himself to the limits to learn about his endurance and agility. His first soul reap had been a success. And he had done it on his own, being the odd reaper in the new recruits, and since no one wanted a boy to be their partner.</p><p>He was finally part of the Retrieval Division, his dream. Now he was able to get a special pair of glasses made by Pops. </p><p>Harry went up to the floor where Pops had his special room for his glasses. A while later Harry was wearing a delicate pair of ornate glasses, that seemed to have been made in the Victorian era. While he was out and about he also took his request to change his death scythe to Administratives, to change the simple and small scythe to something more, him.</p><p>Getting permission, Harry went back to his empty white room to change his scythe. For hours he worked. Other reapers who walked past his room heard the clanging of metal. Harry grunted and hammered away, sweating. Until it was finally complete.</p><p>A steampunkish ornate scythe stood proudly in the corner, gold and silver mixed as a deadly duo. It stood a couple heads taller than Harry. Thorny rose vines wrapped from top to bottom. The roses gave off a golden glow in the light. The silvery vines seemed to float around the handle, giving the impression of hand holds. Pushing his glasses back up his nose, Harry smiled at his scythe.</p><p>“Hello Azriel,” He whispered to the scythe.<br/>
Taking it into his hands, he felt the rush of power. He bathed in his magic, hair flaring and eyes glowing, as it melded with the scythe. Rapidly roses grew and died on the vines, until they grew one last time, staying in a fully blossomed state. </p><p> </p><p>__________----------__________----------___________</p><p>William sat at his desk looking through reports, remembering the first time he saw Harry. He was one of the youngest reapers he had ever seen. Despite his age Harry was one of the best. When his soul was reaped Will had to destroy a horcrux in the boy’s head, unfortunately leaving him with the scar. Will had told him later about it asking if he knew how he got it, but Harry had been surprised when he had been told about it, unsure where he had got it from. </p><p>William felt almost like a father to the young boy, proud of him for everything he accomplished. And William was proud of himself for keeping Harry from Grell. For the few years Harry had been a reaper he had no interactions with the red headed reaper, to William’s relief. </p><p>Sighing he went back to his paperwork, hoping to finish before six o’clock.</p><p>__________----------__________----------___________</p><p>Harry stood on the roof of some fancy place in London, looking through his To Die List. A leather bound journal about the size of his palm, attached to a chain. Harry had bent the rules to the dress code by adding a chatelaine to his attire. It was a modified version which attached to the pocket of his vest and carried his To Die List, Azriel when it was shrunken down, a spyglass, and a pocket watch. </p><p>Releasing the journal, he grabbed his spyglass. John Rhodes was the next on his list. He was to die in the next couple of hours, an accident of course, jaywalking on a busy street never kept anyone alive. </p><p>Starting at the left of the street he looked for John Rhodes. Nothing. Where was he? Harry sighed, taking the spyglass from his eye, he let it dangle from the chain it was attached to, he rubbed his eyes before picking it back up. Finally! There he was. Harry caught sight of the man. </p><p>Releasing the spyglass, Harry let it fall back against his side and buttoned his coat to make sure that the chains of the chatelaine didn’t tangle while he followed John Rhodes.</p><p>Finally the time came and Harry pulled out his pocket watch and Azriel, counting down the last seconds of John Rhodes life. Jumping down from the top of the building, Harry swung his death scythe at the fallen man, watching as the cinematic record started playing. </p><p>He cut the records and stamped the page of John Rhodes life, with the completed stamp. Finishing in time to see an owl fly towards him.</p>
