    <p>Four families stood, quite apart from each other, on platform 9 3/4, watching the Hogwarts Express pull into the station with a squeal and a rush of steam.<br/>
Each family quickly said their goodbyes, in the form of a few words, a hug perhaps, with varying degrees of affection.<br/>
“<em>Make us proud.</em>” The tall, cold parents of a tall, cold boy patted him on the shoulder, his mother pulling him into a stiff hug. He pulled away from her quickly, ruffled his younger brother’s hair affectionately, and walked onto the train, not looking back for even a moment.<br/>
“<em>Good luck!</em>” A round woman with short, dusty hair and a wide smile hugged her son. He squeezed her back, gave a one-armed hug to his distant-looking father, and leaned down to wish a lengthy goodbye to each of his five dogs.<br/>
“<em>Have fun, sweetheart! Write us as soon as you arrive!</em>” Aging parents, old enough perhaps to be mistaken for a young set of grandparents, enveloped their messy-haired son in a warm hug. He pulled away, protesting loudly but with a grin on his face. As he dashed onto the train, owl and trunk in hand, he took in their smiling faces, noticed tears on their cheeks, and walked onto the train.<br/>
“<em>Be careful.</em>” These were words the boy had heard thousands of times, but whispered into his ear under the guise of a loving hug from his father made them feel cold. No goodbyes were said, and the boy dragged his battered trunk onto the train, turning back to look at them and waving a sad, silent goodbye.<br/>
The train left. The first boy sat in a compartment with the third, while the second and fourth went their separate ways, not seeing each other, not knowing.<br/>
The first was Sirius Black. At eleven years old, with black hair he was growing as long as he could to elicit a response from his family. He smiled bravely, sadly, out the window, for a reason he didn’t quite understand, and the boy opposite him mistook his expression for homesickness.<br/>
“Don’t worry,” the other boy, the third, the one the other boys would always envy for his perfect life and perfect family. “I’ll miss my parents loads too.”<br/>
Sirius snorted. “I don’t miss them.”<br/>
“Sounds like something someone who missed their family would say.” The other boy remarked.<br/>
Sirius had to admit he was right. “Sirius. Sirius Black.” He stuck out a pale hand for the boy opposite him to shake.<br/>
“James Potter,” the other said. His handshake was warm and friendly. “Delighted to meet you.”<br/>
Sirius grinned. “Likewise.”<br/>
Two others sat in the compartment — one boy, sallow skinned, greasy haired, with robes that hung off his painfully thin frame, by the name of Severus Snape. Seated next to him was Lily Evans, a girl with glowing pale skin, her nose sprinkled with freckles, red hair hanging down her back in a wavy curtain.<br/>
Both James and Sirius, upon seeing her, noted that she was pretty but was currently holding hands with Snape, and resolved to speak to her when she wasn’t accompanied by a boy who looked like an oversized bat. Hogwarts, suddenly, seemed full of potential not just for magic, but for a chance to meet girls such as the one sat in their compartment at that very moment.<br/>
Severus and Lily were in quiet conversation, and James and Sirius were trying to avoid looking at them as the girl wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her robes.<br/>
“You’d better be in Slytherin,” Severus said, pushing back his greasy hair.<br/>
Sirius stiffened, his jaw tightening as he glared out the window.<br/>
“Slytherin?” James made a face of disgust. “Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” His second statement was directed towards Sirius, whose face remained stiff, fighting not to betray his emotions.<br/>
“My whole family have been in Slytherin.” he said quietly.<br/>
“Blimey, and I thought you seemed alright!” James exclaimed.<br/>
Sirius grinned despite himself. “Maybe I’ll break the tradition.Where are you heading, if you’ve got the choice?” He lounged back, comfortable now that the conversation was turned away from his family.<br/>
James lifted his arms as if raising a sword. “‘<em>Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!</em>' like my dad.”<br/>
Severus stifled his distasteful snort with a cough at the back of his throat.<br/>
“Got a problem with that?” James asked defensively, spiking up his already extremely untidy black hair with one hand, almost as an instinct.<br/>
“No,” he smirked. “If you’d rather be brawny than brainy —“<br/>
Sirius didn’t know much about Slytherin — all he knew was that he’d never met one he’d liked. “Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” He interjected.<br/>
James laughed hysterically. “Nice one,” he gasped in between guffaws.<br/>
Lily stood up, her pale cheeks flushed, her small hands shaking with anger. She glared at James and Sirius, clenching her jaw.<br/>
“Come on, Severus,” she said, grabbing her trunk from the shelf above them. “Let’s find another compartment.”<br/>
“Ooooooooooooo…” James imitated.<br/>
Sirius laughed. “<em>Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.</em> Who does she think she is?”<br/>
James stuck his foot out as Severus passed him in an attempt to trip the other boy.<br/>
“See ya, Snivellus,” Sirius shouted as the compartment door slammed behind them.<br/>
“Snivellus?” James chuckled.<br/>
“It slipped out.”<br/>
“Whatever. He’s a prat.”<br/>
“Making enemies on your first day, eh?” Sirius said.<br/>
“Everywhere I go. My parents would be proud.”<br/>
“Mine too,” Sirius said. Only one of them was joking.<br/>
Still, Sirius was glad to make friends on the first day, just to rub it in his parents’ faces. His mother and father had spat over dinner one night that he would be alone for seven years, a disgrace to the Black family name, but he hardly cared. He’d already proven them wrong.<br/>
———————————————————————————————————————<br/>
“Firs’ years! Firs’ years!” The Hogwarts groundskeeper, known only as Hagrid, standing feet above even the tallest of students, waved his hands and ushered them over.<br/>
He piled them into boats, Sirius and James sticking tightly together, while the other two boys, sat in a boat slightly apart from them, not speaking to each other, but the proximity of them was exciting, almost, to those who could sense, somewhere deep inside themselves, that these four boys were destined for each other.<br/>
After crossing the lake, the first years were greeted by a tall, stately woman in a witch’s hat, her hair pulled back tightly underneath it. Her mouth was thin and stern, and she stood exceptionally stiff and poised. There was something in her eyes that flashed before she spoke, it spoke of a composure and strength that most of these children would never understand.<br/>
“Welcome, first years,” she said. “I am Professor McGonagall, the Gryffindor head of house.”<br/>
“If that’s where that absolute toe rag from the train ends up I surely hope I won’t be placed there,” Lily hissed to Severus, who grinned gleefully.<br/>
“Before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into one of four houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Doing well in classes will earn you points, and breaking rules will cause you to lose points.”<br/>
Sirius snorted, and she gave him a rather direct look, her mouth pursing into a thin, threatening line. James laughed.<br/>
“Shall we proceed to the Sorting?” Professor McGonagall asked, leading them through a wide set of double doors and into a grand hall.<br/>
They all stood in a group together, full of fear and anticipation as the Sorting Hat burst into song. After singing for the better part of ten minutes, most of the returning students joining in, McGonagall started to read out names.<br/>
It didn’t take long for her to reach, “<em>Black, Sirius!</em>”<br/>
Sirius sat on the stool as if it was his birthright, but his knuckles were white under the edge of the wood. He was sure the answer was Slytherin, and sure that his parents would send him a note of encouragement, “<em>congratulations on making Slytherin! Carrying on the tradition, that’s our boy!</em>” A boy from the noble and most ancient house of Black, he’d be sent a Howler for anything less than perfection.<br/>
The Sorting Hat smirked. <em>So you don’t want to be a Slytherin,</em> it said in Sirius’ head, sly and devious.<br/>
<em>I don’t want to be like them!</em> Sirius himself was surprised by the vehemence with which he thought it. I don’t want to be a Black. I don’t want to be a Slytherin.<br/>
<em>Not Slytherin?</em><br/>
<em>Not.</em> Sirius thought, screwing up his small, scared face.<br/>
“Gryffindor!” The Sorting Hat shouted out, loud and clear, without hesitating for a moment.<br/>
“Save me a seat, mate!” James called, clapping along with the rest of them. Sirius took off the hat and sat down in an empty spot at the Gryffindor table, as if he had never questioned for a second which house he would be in.<br/>
He watched Lily Evans be sorted into Gryffindor — well, less watched, more gloated at Severus’s heartbroken face. Lily gave a regretful look back at Severus and sat down as far from Sirius as she could get.<br/>
“<em>Lupin, Remus!</em>” McGonagall read out, and the headmaster gave an odd sort of nod to the boy as he sat on the stool. He stared at his shoes instead of the throng of people.<br/>
Sirius looked at him and recognized him from the train station, remembered how his parents had hugged him gingerly, like he was made of glass, and how he’d pulled a Hogwarts wizard’s hat low over his head and was now crumpling it in his lap. This was the fourth boy, and how important he was and would be.<br/>
It took just a few seconds until Remus was sorted into Gryffindor, and he walked quickly, with a slight limp, to the table. Lily smiled at him, and he couldn’t bring himself to smile back at this strange girl who smiled at a boy with so many scars, but when she gestured for him to sit down, he did.<br/>
“<em>Pettigrew, Peter,</em>” McGonagall called, around ten minutes later. A few seconds of silence, a lull in the conversations, and then a small, plump, unassuming boy scurried up to the stool and sat down. There was something rodent-like in his visage, the sharp, small nose, the terrified eyes. Despite all this, the Sorting Hat roared,<br/>
“Gryffindor!”<br/>
The boy sat down next to Remus and introduced himself shyly, as Peter.<br/>
“You’re Remus, right?”<br/>
Remus nodded. He remembered seeing Peter at the train station, and took a deep breath. You can do this, he thought. “I saw you at the platform. You have a lot of dogs,” he managed. He exhaled as Peter’s face lit up. Thank Merlin.<br/>
“Yeah, I have five. We see all these strays around our house, and we take them in a lot of the time. My mum loves them, but she’s not fond of dirt, so she makes them sleep outside a lot.” Peter said excitedly. “Do you have any pets?”<br/>
Remus shook his head. <em>Does the fact that I turn into a murderous beast every month count as a pet? I suppose not.</em> “No, no pets. Always wanted one, but animals seem to back away from me in fear.”<br/>
“I’m sure you’re exaggerating.” Peter said graciously.<br/>
“I wish.” A Ravenclaw’s cat hissed at Remus when he reached down to pet it. “You see?”<br/>
“I reckon it’s the, er, scars.” Peter said. <em>Why on earth did I say that? That was so rude! He must hate me…</em><br/>
Remus let out a shocked chuckle. “Yeah. Must be.” This was the most he’d ever talked to someone his age, and he felt equal parts special and uncomfortable.<br/>
James Potter sauntered over to the table, with a natural arrogance that looked almost comedic on a boy of his age and size. He sat down next to Sirius, exchanging congratulatory remarks. Both boys grinned.<br/>
“Hello,” Mary MacDonald turned to Lily and shook her hand. “I’m Mary. You look upset, is everything alright?” She had a direct way about her, a way of asking questions no one else was going to ask.<br/>
“Lily,” Lily replied, her green eyes fixed on the Slytherin table, where Severus had sat next to a tall, blonde seventh year with steely eyes. He looked perfectly at home without Lily, and she had to admit it hurt.<br/>
“It’s nice to meet you.” Mary said with a smile.<br/>
Lily smiled back, momentarily looking at Mary before thinking,<br/>
<em>I never thought Severus and I would be separated. Are we even going to see each other? He’s my best mate.</em><br/>
Albus Dumbledore stepped up on a platform, casting an amplifying spell so the entire Great Hall could hear him. “Welcome back to Hogwarts, for all our returning students, and welcome to our first years. I trust you had good holidays?”<br/>
A few people whistled and applauded.<br/>
Dumbledore raised a hand. “There is, however, one thing I’d like to discuss with all of you before we begin the feast. You may have noticed the presence of a Whomping Willow outside the school —“<br/>
Remus Lupin’s face grew red. <em>Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop</em> — he wanted to cover his ears so as not to hear Professor Dumbledore continue to talk about the Whomping Willow, which he knew had been planted solely for his benefit, as a passage to an abandoned shack near Hogsmeade.<br/>
“What’s a Whomping Willow?” Lily whispered to Mary.<br/>
Mary grinned mischievously. “Oh. You’re Muggle-born.”<br/>
“Yes,” Lily said, her eyes narrowing. “What is it?”<br/>
“A tree. Professor Dumbledore will explain why it’s there. It kind of…moves around and smashes things.”<br/>
“Maybe it’s to guard the school…or something?” Lily managed, in an attempt to redeem herself. Already, she could see, Mary knew how different she was. She would never fit in. Not with Muggle parents. Severus had lied to her to make her feel better about leaving her family. Severus had abandoned her. She clenched her fists in the pockets of her robes.<br/>
“Professor Sprout had requested the planting of a Whomping Willow for Herbology. As such, I do recommend you avoid antagonizing it. I trust the prefects will keep the younger students in line?” Dumbledore said.<br/>
The blonde boy next to Severus nodded proudly.<br/>
“But enough chatter,” Dumbledore said, waving his hands. “It’s time for the feast.”  	Lily looked down at the food that had appeared in front of them and gasped audibly. “Is that even possible?” she asked.<br/>
James turned to her, his black hair sticking up in back, his hazel eyes full of amusement. “Of course it is.”<br/>
Lily glared at him. “Oh, of course it is,” she mimicked, scooping cranberry sauce onto her plate.<br/>
After an hour, the Gryffindor Head Boy and Girl escorted the first years up to their dormitories. Peter, Sirius, James, and Remus shared a room, walking in together to find their trunks already placed on beds for them.<br/>
Remus’s bed was by the door, furthest from the others, and he sat down on it with a quiet sigh, pulling a Muggle book out of his trunk.<br/>
“Are you a Muggle-born, then?” Peter asked, walking around James and Sirius, who were having a heated pillow fight on James’s bed.<br/>
“Half-blood.” Remus said. “What about you?”<br/>
“Pureblood.” Peter shrugged. “You know, I —“<br/>
He was interrupted by Remus getting hit in the face by James’s pillow as it flew across the room.<br/>
Remus threw it back, rubbing his eye.<br/>
“Oi, sorry, mate,” James said, putting out his hand to shake. “I’m James.”<br/>
“Remus,” Remus said, looking at the ground.<br/>
Sirius jumped onto James’s back and attacked him with a pillow.<br/>
“Hey! You!” James smacked Sirius with a pillow, looking at Peter. “What’s your name? Also, come help me attack Sirius!”<br/>
“It’s Peter,” Peter exclaimed breathlessly, snatching the pillow off his own bed and hitting Sirius with it.<br/>
Remus watched with mild amusement over the top of his book.<br/>
“Remus, you want to join us?” Sirius asked.<br/>
Remus shook his head.<br/>
“Alright.” Sirius shrugged and threw his pillow at James.<br/>
Remus fell asleep in his Hogwarts robes, waking up late to Peter sitting on the edge of his bed pelting rolled up pieces of paper at him. He rubbed his eyes and tried not to look angry.<br/>
“Remus, you’re going to miss breakfast,” James said, rumpling his black hair.<br/>
“I’m not that hungry.” Remus said, brushing his scruffy hair with his fingers. It had an odd, chopped appearance, having been cut over the kitchen sink with a dull pair of scissors.<br/>
James crossed his arms. “No offense, mate, but you look like you’re starving. And I’m warning you now, if you miss a single meal I swear to Merlin I’ll start shoving food down your throat. I suppose I really am my mother’s son.”<br/>
Remus chuckled slightly, glanced about the room, and followed the others downstairs to breakfast.</p>
