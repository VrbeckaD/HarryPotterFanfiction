    <p>They arrived in a frenzy of shouts and screams, blood dripping hands and sand-covered shoes. Bill had nearly stopped his brother, demanding that he prove himself, but when he saw the state Hermione was in and the anxiety on his brother’s face, he knew it wasn’t an imposter. </p>
<p>The first few hours were the worst. Hermione lay unconscious while Fleur tended to her, Ron all the while by her side. “You are in ze way,” Fleur clucked at him, but he refused to let go of Hermione’s hand. Once Hermione’s conditioned had stabilized, the news of Dobby’s fate traveled throughout the house. Ron only agreed to leave Hermione alone in Fleur’s care when he saw Harry through the window, digging a small, elf-sized grave. </p>
<p>“She ‘ill be okay,” Fleur reassured him, giving him a pat on the shoulder as he glanced back at Hermione, who had begun to stir. “Go. ‘Elp your friend.”</p>
<p>Ron stood and felt the weight of the world on his shoulders, blinked and saw Hermione’s small frame laying before him, bloodied and bruised. He could still hear her screams in the back of his mind, and as he walked outside the room, he found himself leaning against the wall, tears threatening to escape. Just hours ago, he thought he’d cried all the tears he could, his face soaking wet as he screamed from the dungeon in Malfoy Manor. But somehow, they had survived. The weight of it was crushing. </p>
<p>He closed his eyes tightly, willing himself to calm down. He wanted to go help Harry. Then, he could come back and see Hermione, check that she was okay. Fleur was a competent Healer. And Harry shouldn’t have to dig the grave by himself…</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a hand on his shoulder, squeezing softly. There before him stood Dean Thomas, his classmate since the age of eleven, who had grown nearly as tall as Ron, who’s hair was now long and curly after months on the run. “Hey,” he said, “All right, mate?”</p>
<p>Ron nodded and sniffed. A year ago, he might have felt embarrassed that Dean Thomas was seeing him cry. But after the day he’d had, he no longer cared about anything, other than Hermione’s safety. </p>
<p>“She okay?” asked Dean, wide-eyed as he motioned towards the closed bedroom door, which Hermione and Fleur were behind. </p>
<p>Ron nodded, unable to get out any words. </p>
<p>Dean stared at him for a moment, as if he was about to say something but wasn’t sure how, and then sighed. “Imagine if McGonagall could see us now.”</p>
<p>Ron laughed, a somewhat watery, garbled noise escaping his mouth. “Shite, I reckon she’d take away house points.”</p>
<p>“Prob’ly for your bloody language, mate.”</p>
<p>Ron shook his head and grinned. He could hear Fleur bustling around in the room behind them, humming softly to herself as she cleaned up potions and remedies. </p>
<p>Dean cleared his throat, squeezed Ron’s arm one more time, and then spoke up. “I saw...Harry outside. Thought maybe you and I could go help him, he’d digging a grave…”</p>
<p>Ron nodded. “That’s where I was heading.”</p>
<p>“Brilliant.”</p>
<p>Ron hesitated before stepping away, images of Hermione’s cuts and blood still on his mind. He glanced down at his own hands - they were covered in her blood, and probably some of his own, with all the cuts he got from running into the path of the falling chandelier. </p>
<p>“You can stay here, if you want,” Dean said, noticing Ron’s hesitation. </p>
<p>Ron shook his head. “Fleur’s taking care of her. And she’d, well...she’d probably want me to help Harry, I reckon…”</p>
<p>Dean grinned. “Even from her sickbed she’s bossing you around.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well…”</p>
<p>“She’ll be okay,” he reassured, throwing an arm around Ron as they began to descend the stairs, “She’s got you, mate. She’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>Ron nodded and together, they made their way outside into the blistering beach air, and joined Harry with shovels in their hands.</p>
