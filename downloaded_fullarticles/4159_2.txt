    <p>December 29th, 1997</p><p><br/>
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry sat silent beneath a heavy blanket of snow. The castle loomed ominously in the darkness with only the odd window lit here and there. Not surprising since the school was still on holiday, most students fled home, and the fact that it was half past three in the morning. The skies were overcast, the moon casting long shadows in the glittering snow one moment, then the clouds obscuring everything in darkness the next.</p><p><br/>
It was during one of these dark moments that Whomping Willow started to stir slightly, casting falling sheets of snow to the ground with quiet whumps, before it straightened rigidly. It would have only taken a very keen observer to notice the difference in the dark. If there was such an observer, he would have had an even more difficult time seeing the dark figure who emerged from under the tree into the black night.</p><p><br/>
The mysterious figure quickly made their way towards the castle, away from the tree before it recovered from its temporary paralysis. The moon chose this moment to peak from behind the clouds as the night time visitor made it to a safe distance and quickly turned to cover the deep trenches in the snow that had been left in their wake. After all hint of their passing was smoothed, the individual continued quickly and silently towards the side of the castle, this time their foot step were wiped clean in a shimmer of magic behind them as they walked.</p><p><br/>
The dark figure soon came to a small side door and reached up to make sure their hood was still in place before casting a quick silencing spell on the hinges of the door and easing it open just enough to squeeze inside. No hint of their passing remained in fallen snow.</p><p><br/>
As soon as the door was safely shut behind them the intruder quickly spelled the snow off their clothes and cast a quick drying spell. It wouldn't do to leave a trail of water for anyone to follow. Finally dry and snow free the silent intruder sped on muffled feet towards the Headmaster's office. </p><p>Keeping to the shadows and casting furtive glances every few steps slowed down their movement but it still only took a few minutes for the interloper to reach the stone gargoyle protecting the entrance to the office of one Headmaster Severus Snape. Another furtive look up and down the hall to make sure the coast was clear, and then the cautious person raised a hidden wand and cast a barely whispered muffliato spell. The figure turned to the gargoyle and whispered in a low voice, "Please tell the Headmaster there is someone to see him. It's a matter of utmost urgency."</p><p>The stone gargoyle blinked once and the figure quickly stepped into the shadows across the way blending into the darkness. It was only a matter of moments when the gargoyle stepped aside casting a bright glare of light across the hidden intruder, before the light was blocked by the imposing figure of the Headmaster. </p><p>The silent person quickly reached up and tugged the hood of their cloak down further, hiding in the recesses, but not fast enough. A look of pure shock crossed the usually sneering countenance of the Headmaster. It only lasted a moment though before he sent a searching look up and down the hall before beckoning the unexpected visitor to follow him. Quickly he turned, hearing the soft footsteps of his 'guest' following closely behind him as he walked swiftly back into his office. As soon as the 'guest' came into the room he quickly cast various privacy spells over windows, doors, and even the fireplace before turning back to the silent creature standing nervously in front of him.</p><p>"Miss Granger, what an... unexpected surprise." Severus finally addressed the person in front of him who finally lowered the hood of her cloak. Her bushy hair was wilder than ever, caught back into what might have been a bun at one point but was now a knotted mess on the back of her head, littered with what looked like leaves and twigs. Her face was sallow, sunken, as if she hadn't had a good meal in months (which he supposed she hadn't). Her eyes however were still as clear and bright as he remembered, though now they were filled with fear, hurt, and the smallest glimmer hidden in their depths that Severus could not place. </p><p>He felt a pang in his chest at the sight of the bedraggled and weary girl standing still before him. He didn't know exactly what they had been up to in the last months following Voldemort's rise to power (the portrait of Phineas Black could only tell him so much), but it looked like she had been through hell. It showed in the dirt crusted cracked nails on her fingers, the worry lines already forming on her young face. Her already delicate features where now pinched, her cheek bones a testament to too many days without proper food. Her robe covered most of her body still and Severus was glad to be spared, at least for the moment, to see how thin she must have become, and how baggy her already small clothes had to be on her small frame. He felt another small pang of regret that anyone, especially her, would have to go through so much so young. He forced the regret down, burying it under the anger, the fear he was feeling at her coming here of all places.</p><p>"Please Headmaster Snape, I come begging sanctuary. They left me and now I have nowhere else to go." </p><p>Tears swam in the big brown eyes that stared unflinching into his own. He didn't know what had happened between her and the two idiots but it must have been big if she was standing here now. However his anger at her and his fear towards her had him sneering at her. </p><p>"You say you have nowhere else to go? So you come here? To a Death Eater riddled school to the ask the murderer of Albus Dumbledore for what? Sanctuary?" Severus let out a bark of bitter laughter. "What did you expect? That just because I was once your professor I would welcome you with open arms? That the Dark Lord's right hand man would hide you away and keep you safe?"</p><p>Severus watched as he belittled the girl. He expected her to flinch at his biting questions. Instead he saw resolution stiffen her spine as she met his gaze steadily. 'Foolish girl. She should never have come here. For all she knows my words are true. For all she knows, I am a loyal follower of him. Why did she risk everything to come to me, the greatest traitor of all time?'</p><p>"Because, sir, I saw you that night." Severus stilled. There were many nights she could be thinking of, but which one? He waited, staring at her with his cold indifferent mask firmly in place. She straightened even more, puffing out her chest in righteous conviction as she continued. "I saw you just three nights ago in the woods. It was you who cast that Patronus that lead Harry to the sword. It was you who put the sword there to be found in the first place. What ever happened between you and Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy tower is between you and him. I know there is more to the story than what Harry saw. I know that you are not the big bad Death Eater you claim to be. I also know that the best place for a spy to be is at the side of the man he is trying to take down. All the little things clicked into place that night as I saw you follow Harry, because I was following you. I saw you go to protect him. I saw you step forward to help him when he didn't surface from the pond right away. I saw you hide again when Ron stepped forward. You waited Professor, until you knew they were both alright before you Apparated away." At this point she drew a great breath. Her gaze was steel and her words strong, unwavering. "I knew that I could trust you. That is why I came. That is why I am here asking 'the right hand of the Dark Lord' for protection. It's because I know that of all the people out there that, you are the only one I am absolutely sure I can trust."</p>
