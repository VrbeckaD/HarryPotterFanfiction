    <p>Caw! Caw! </p>
<p>A flock of ravens scattered into the darkening sky although one remained, a white raven with three burning red eyes. </p>
<p>He, for it was a male, looked straight into wide amber eyes belonging to a young witch. </p>
<p>Staring at her, he cawed, “Flames and ashes! Flames and ashes! Born anew from flames and ashes! The Phoenix arises to fight the Night but what use is Two when there’s need for One. If mankind is to see the Light of Dawn.”</p>
<p>Then, before the witch’s eyes, the raven began to change and to her horror, there was a rotten decrepit body and just as it was reaching, reaching towards her, she felt herself falling and somewhere in the distance, she heard her name being called…</p>
<p>“Hermione!”  </p>
<p>Gasping, Hermione Granger jerked upwards, small hands flying up and glowing with what looked to be sparks of fire.</p>
<p>“Whoa! It’s just me Mione! It’s Harry!”</p>
<p>Instantly dousing her magic, which Harry noted with some sense of forebearance was all done wandlessly, the young witch smiled sheepishly up at her best friend’s alarmed and concerned face.</p>
<p>“Harry! Oh Merlin, I’m so sorry! Guess even though the war’s over, I’m still feeling a bit…skittish…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can see that,” her friend said wryly. “But I thought you would like to  know that I made breakfast and the twins have already eaten so you don’t need to worry about feeding them.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widening in surprise, she breathed out, “Wh…What time is it Harry? While I appreciate you helping out with the twins, I feel like I’m somehow taking advantage of free babysitting duties when I could easily do it myself…”</p>
<p>“Stop it Mione. I know you can, we all do. But it’s normal to slack off once and awhile and let us, your friends and family help you out. You know Molly adores the twins and doesn’t mind watching them along with Teddy when Tonks and Remus need time to themselves.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know,” Hermione replied softly. “I just…I don’t know what’s happening to me Harry…I just feel so tired and I’ve been getting these weird dreams lately…”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re Hermione Granger. I’m sure you will find out what’s going on with you and in the meantime, let us help you with the twins, alright?”</p>
<p>Sighing but knowing that Harry wouldn’t give in on this, stubborn as he was, much like herself she admitted wryly, Hermione complied. </p>
<p>“Very well. If you can watch the twins for me today, I’ll be heading to Hogwarts to do some research. It’s about time I figure out why I’m getting the same dreams almost every night…”</p>
<p>“Oh Hogwarts,” Harry exclaimed, his green eyes lighting up. “You don’t mind if I tag along then, Mione? I could show the twins around, like a mini tour while you enjoy the library as usual…”</p>
<p>“Well, if you want to,” Hermione began slowly, biting her lip. </p>
<p>“Great,” the Magical World’s Savior cut in. “I’d love to see how McGonagall is doing with the school and I can’t believe Fred and George are the Defense against Dark Arts Professors for this year…What McGonagall was thinking hiring them…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a low growl of frustration, Hermione slammed yet another useless book of dreams shut. Rubbing her eyes, she had to finally admit that perhaps the answer she was seeking wasn’t to be in Hogwart’s archives. </p>
<p>But if not here, then where else could she go look?</p>
<p>Lost in thought, she almost missed her name being called.</p>
<p>“Mione? You ready to go? The twins are getting tired so I figured we should go home and get them down for their nap.”</p>
<p>Looking up and seeing Harry with her children nodding off in his arms, the witch agreed.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m done. There was nothing that could help me anyways. I’ll have to try somewhere else. But where to go next?”</p>
<p>“Maybe Grimmauld Place might be where you need to go, Mione,” Harry suggested. </p>
<p>“If what you are seeking might be…a bit dark, you can bet the Black library will have it.”</p>
<p>Her face lighting up, his best friend exclaimed happily, “Harry Potter I love you! If you weren’t like a brother to me, I’d marry you in a heartbeat just for that brilliant idea alone!”</p>
<p>Smirking, Harry said humbly, “Oh you know me Mione. Every once and awhile I think of brilliant ideas. And I’d marry you too if you weren’t like a sister to me. Hell, I’d probably marry you  just so I can keep these pups with me forever.”</p>
<p>Her eyes going a bit sad, Hermione said softly, “I’m sorry things didn’t work out between you and Ginny, Harry. I know you cared for her and she for you…I really thought you two would make it and have the big family you always wanted.”</p>
<p>Shrugging, acting like it didn’t bother him, although she knew it did, Harry said flippantly, “Ah well, we tried Mione. It just wasn’t meant to be, I suppose. She found another bloke and they are happy now and I’m glad for them, I really am.”</p>
<p>“Even though it’s a Slytherin she fell in love with,” Hermione questioned gently. </p>
<p>“Yes,” Harry said firmly. “Blaise might be a Slytherin and Malfoy’s best friend but he’s a good man Mione and he loves Ginny and makes her happy, more than I ever could. So yes, I am happy for them.”</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment before Hermione said brightly, “Right, let’s get these kids home and tucked in bed.”</p>
<p>Then, tucking her hand in Harry’s arm, she let him escort her out of the school and off to Hogsmead where they could apparate home to their London flat.</p>
<p>They were walking to their destination when out of nowhere, they were ambushed. </p>
<p>“It’s Potter and his Mudblood! This is for our Lord, Potter!”</p>
<p>Barely dodging the flash of hexes hurled his way, with a loud curse, Harry quickly shoved the now wide awake twins into their mother’s arms. </p>
<p>“Quick, take the kids Mione and get them out of here!”</p>
<p>“But Harry,” Hermione protested.</p>
<p>“NO MIONE,” Harry shouted fiercely. “GET OUT NOW!”</p>
<p>Swallowing thickly but knowing she had to go, she had to protect her children first, Hermione made to spin and apparate but unfortunately their attackers had other plans. </p>
<p>With multiple hexes hurled at her, two that were aimed at her children, Hermione didn’t have to think. </p>
<p>She covered her twins with her own body and just barely managed to cast a shield over themselves…<br/>
Next thing she knew, she was blacking out…</p>
