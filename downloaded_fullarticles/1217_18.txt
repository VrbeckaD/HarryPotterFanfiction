</p><p>Arriving at the destroyed house, Hagrid choked back a sob at what he saw. Taking several deep breaths, he pushed himself into calming down. He had a job to do here.</p><p>He slipped inside as carefully as he could, making his way up the ruined stairs and towards the nursery. He stifled another sob as he stepped over a man’s body, taking utmost care not to even step on a thread of cloth.</p><p>The whimpers of a child could be heard, the half-giant feeling tears form at the sight of the little babe in his crib, forehead bleeding. On the floor was the child’s mother, life gone from her eyes. Taking several more deep breaths, pulling himself together, he reached for the baby and gathered him up. As he set to procure some warm blankets to wrap the little one up and clean the blood off, another whimper caught his attention.</p><p>Crumpled on the floor was a squirming bundle of discarded robes. He found that rather strange, but pushed it from his mind. He tentatively reached a large hand down, moving them, revealing a second baby.</p><p>“But Harry be the only one they have,” he muttered. Could they have been babysitting when they were attacked? No, that couldn’t be it. They wouldn’t endanger another couple’s child like that.</p><p>Shaking his head, he gingerly scooped the small child up. He found the unknown child naked and shivering, face wet with tears like the other. He took the cloak the child had been found in and wrapped the babe up. He proceeded to fish for what he could to wrap both children in warm blankets. The moment they were tucked together in a large arm, they settled, tiny hands clasping one another.</p><p>“Bless them,” he sniffed. He grabbed one more blanket to make sure they were bundled as one, allowing them to snuggle closer.</p><p>The last thing he got was a smaller cloth and went for the bathroom. Wetting it slightly, he dabbed the injured one’s forehead, cleaning most of the blood off without aggravating the wound. When he finished and dried him off, he slipped out of the house undetected. He made some distance before a haggard man appeared on a motorbike.</p><p>“Hagrid!” he shouted. He gasped at the ruined home not far from where they were, people already gathering. “What…what the bloody hell happened?”</p><p>“Lily and James… They’re…”</p><p>“No…” the man whispered, tears forming. Taking note of the unusually large bundle of cloth, he felt his eyes water further. “Is that… Is that <em>Harry?</em>”</p><p>“Be him and ‘nother.”</p><p>“Another?”</p><p>Hagrid nodded, bringing the bundle lower, revealing two pale faces sleeping.</p><p>“One on the right is Harry.”</p><p>“He’s hurt… Let me take him. He’s my godson.”</p><p>“Can’t, Sirius, Dumbledore’s orders, sorry…”</p><p>“What? But I’m his godfather! I-I… Fine, whatever. I’ll talk to him later about this. What about the other baby?”</p><p>“Don’t know. He was in the same room as Harry. They could have been babysitting or somethin’. Poor thing was all bare and shiverin’.”</p><p>“What are you going to do with him?”</p><p>“Take him to Dumbledore. He’ll know what to do. He’ll find his family if he has one and return him. Do it but…”</p><p>“Right, right… Look, take my bike. It’ll be a tight squeeze, but it’ll get you where you need to go faster and safer than trying to Apparate or Floo.”</p><p>“Thank yeh, Sirius, yer a good man.”</p><p>“Right, I’m gonna find out what the hell happened. How <em>could</em> this have happened?”</p><p>The man hurried off, running for the destroyed house, his form changing from man to dog as he ran. Hagrid took the bike, getting himself as comfortable as possible, taking great care that both children were secure before revving the engine and taking off. When it was safe, he aimed it for the sky, taking them high above homes, out of sight of muggles.</p><p>During the long trip, the infants briefly woke, giggling at each other. The unknown child playfully pawed at Harry, the raven-haired one doing the same. When feeling the half-giant’s beard, they giggled louder, making the man give them a watery smile.</p><p>By the time he arrived at Number Four Privet Drive in Little Whinging, Surrey, it had been a full day’s worth, night falling again. The gamekeeper landed, greeting the professors who waited for his arrival.</p><p>“<em>Must</em> he stay here?” Hagrid asked, gazing down at the little infants. They were both asleep, tiny hands once more clasped around each other.</p><p>“It’s for the best,” Dumbledore sighed, an aged brow rising. “Hagrid, why are there <em>two</em> infants?”</p><p>“’Bout that…”</p><p>Hagrid proceeded to tell them what happened when he went to the house and his uncertainty of what to do with the child, unable to leave simply leave him behind. He wasn’t sure how long he had been in the cold or how soon the muggle police, the Aurors even would arrive to investigate and discover him.</p><p>“The poor thing,” Minerva whispered sadly.</p><p>“How peculiar, you said you found him in discarded robes. What did it look like?”</p><p>“He’s all wrapped up in it. It’s all black and hooded, looked to have been a man’s. Why you ask?”</p><p>“Let me see the child, Hagrid,” Dumbledore requested.</p><p>With a little work, the blanket that encased the infants was removed, the children whimpering when separated. The old wizard cradled the unknown child, a long finger tracing alongside the child’s pudgy face. The action was enough to rouse him, dark brown eyes fluttering open briefly. A bright innocent smile bore on his face as he reached to grab and tug the silvery beard.</p><p>“Well, this is quite a predicament you put yourself in, haven’t you, Tom?” Dumbledore sighed.</p><p>“Tom? What are you talking about?” Minerva inquired.</p><p>“My dear friends, this child here is the very wizard we thought to be dead,” he answered. With gentle hands, he found an object hidden in the robes, withdrawing a wand from inside. “Even his wand came along.”</p><p>“Thought to… You don’t mean that’s <em>Him!</em>” Hagrid almost bellowed. He had been silenced with a sharp glare from the woman and a whimper from the baby still tucked in his arms.</p><p>“Indeed it is. It appears that his assassination attempt on young Harry had <em>quite</em> an unexpected result.”</p><p>“What should we do then, Albus?” Minerva asked, voice trembling.</p><p>“I’m not entirely certain. I don’t see the evil that once clouded his eyes. When he changed, he may have inadvertently wiped himself of all his memories.”</p><p>“So he be a blank slate?”</p><p>“How…how can you be certain this is <em>him</em> though?”</p><p>“The features are there. While I never met him as an infant, I’ve had him as my student for a number of years. One doesn’t forget a face, no matter <em>how</em> much it changes.”</p><p>Both the gamekeeper and teacher looked to one another as Dumbledore walked back to Hagrid, passing him the infant.</p><p>“Dumbledore, sir?”</p><p>“Just for a moment, I need to take Harry.”</p><p>Realizing what this meant, Hagrid tearfully accepted the quizzical boy back, passing him the sleeping infant. Tom whimpered seeing this, his lips quivering as he reached his tiny hands out towards the other whose eyes twitched in response. Green eyes opened, blinking briefly before noticing his companion was gone. Confused and scared, tears filled his eyes and began to cry. Tom started to cry louder the further they were apart, Harry doing the same.</p><p>“There, there now, it’ll be alright,” Hagrid tried to comfort. Dark Lord or not, this was a helpless baby and he couldn’t stand seeing the little one weeping.</p><p>The child wouldn’t settle, becoming fussier and louder, Harry entering a similar state, making Dumbledore pause as he tried to settle the child. Lights that should have been de-lighted began flickering to life, letterboxes shuddering and groaning. The sounds of parked cars groaned and rattled, threatening to buckle under an unknown pressure.</p><p>Realizing what was about to happen, Minerva quickly gathered Tom and ran to her friend and coworker. The moment the children were reunited, their crying softened as they pawed at one another, their magic settling.</p><p>“They can’t be apart it seems,” the headmaster sighed, glancing at the second child with tired eyes. “You never made things easy, did you?” He ended this with a small chuckle.</p><p>“So they’ll <em>both</em> be here?” Minerva asked warily.</p><p>“It appears so,” Dumbledore nodded. He thought back to the prophecy, wondering if it still had some hold on these children. This was certainly not a part of his plans stopping the de-aged wizard. <em>“We’ll just have to see what fate brings us.”</em></p><p>Setting Harry down first, he took Tom, setting him down alongside the other. Both immediately squirmed and rolled until they were facing one another. Their foreheads touched, their breathing evening out with small puffs from the cold, warming each other’s faces. Slowly, their eyes closed, sleeping taking them, tiny hands grasping one another.</p><p>Dumbledore held back a sigh, having felt their power. He found it curious that they would react given how brief they know each other.</p><p><em>“Children are truly curious things,”</em> he hummed.</p><p>He pulled out the letter he had written ahead of time for Harry and laid it beside the child. He called up a fresh roll of parchment, ink, quill, and envelope. He wrote what was needed to be said about the second child, leaving certain details out. He gave explicit instructions that both children must be raised together. Therefore, the family couldn’t abandon one or both of them. He wrote down Tom’s name and with a quick wave of his wand, determined what his age is now and wrote it down along with his birthday.</p><p><em>“Just what did you do, Tom?”</em> Dumbledore wondered as he finished, the ink dried and parchment folded up. He placed it in the envelope, closing and sealing it up. He signed it similarly as he did with Harry’s.</p><p>For the wand, the headmaster tucked it inside his robes. It was much too dangerous to leave it with the children. Even if he wrote to have the wand remain hidden, it could call out to its master and draw him in. Who knows what sort of mischief the boy could get into should he reclaim it?</p><p>“We should run along. I hear there are some lovely festivities going on now that these dark times have finished.”</p>
