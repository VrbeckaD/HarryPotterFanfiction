    <p>Sabrina, a gryffindor, marched over her friend Mark, a big smile on her face.</p><p> "Mark, I have the best idea!"</p><p> Mark looked up from the book he was reading and smiled. Their friend Riley, a ravenclaw, kept her face in her book and mumbled, "Suuureeee you do."</p><p> "I have the perfect way to get that slytherin to marry you," Sabrina beamed. "It's a three step plan."</p><p> Mark closed his book and sat it down, "I'm listening."</p><p> "So basically, with this plan, he has to marry you even if you're a hufflepuff."</p><p> Mark crossed his arms and scoffed, "What's wrong with m-"</p><p> "Nothing! Step one! Get him to play truth or dare with you," Sabrina cut Mark off and sat down next to him.</p><p> Riley sighed, "Oh no.."</p><p> Sabrina hopped up and glared at the ravenclaw.</p><p> Mark sighed too, "Oh no..."</p><p> "It's a good idea, I swear! Step two. Wait until he picks dare."</p><p> Riley looked up from her book as Mark rolled his eyes.</p><p> "Step three," Sabrina said, "Dare him to marry you."</p><p> "It could work," Riley piped up.</p><p> "No," Mark said, "I'm not doing it."</p>
