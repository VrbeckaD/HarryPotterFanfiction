    <p>Remus was curled up on a sofa in the Common Room. It was two days after a full moon, and Remus was still feeling exhausted from the experience. Sirius was sitting right next to him, letting Remus rest his head against his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Remus loved having Sirius close like that. A couple of years back he’d caught himself thinking about Sirius a whole lot, missing being near him, craving to touch him. He’d never felt that way about anyone else before, and it had scared him a bit at first until he’d realized he was actually falling for him. After that, he’d been <em>terrified.</em></p><p> </p><p>There was no way he was ever going to tell Sirius that. Their friendship had always been very touchy-feely, and Remus didn’t want to make things awkward between them. He was happy with the way everything was.</p><p> </p><p>So he’d been trying to push his feelings down. Pretend they’re not there. But despite his best effort to ignore them, the feelings had been growing stronger every day for years.</p><p> </p><p>“Remus? Can you help us?”</p><p> </p><p>He opened his eyes. The speaker was a tiny first-year student, a brunette girl with glasses. Remus had helped her and her friends with their homework for the whole year.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Sophia,” Remus answered.  “I’m a little sick. I don’t think I can be any help right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” said Sophia, her face falling, and Remus felt immediately guilty. “I just thought - it’s a really hard Herbology assignment about Devil’s Snare and none of us really get it.” She waved at her friends’ direction. The other first-years were standing beside one of the tables, observing them quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Remus closed his eyes, being too tired to keep them open any longer. He leaned closer to the warmth of Sirius’s body. “I’d love to help, Soph, but I can’t. I’m really sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>He couldn’t bear looking at the girl’s face fill with disappointment, which he knew would happen. Not once had he had to say no to her before, nor to any of her friends.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when he heard Sirius speaking in a gentle voice, but not to his direction.</p><p> </p><p>“Devil’s Snare, you said? I might know a thing or two about it. Want me to help?”</p><p> </p><p>Remus opened his eyes again and looked at Sirius, feeling surprised. <em> This wasn’t like him </em>. The boy barely did his own homework. Not that he couldn’t. He was really smart, actually. But he never bothered.</p><p> </p><p>But Sirius got up and followed the girl across the room, to the table where her friends were waiting. The kids looked a bit startled to see this stranger joining them instead of Remus, but they soon gathered around him, forgetting their nervousness as Sirius started to teach.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in ages, Remus remembered that Sirius was, in fact, a big brother.</p><p> </p><p>He was flipping through pages and pointing out pictures and helpful paragraphs for the first-years. Sophia and the others seemed to absorb every word Sirius was saying, writing notes, asking questions. Just everything about the way he was helping the children around him was genuine and loving.</p><p> </p><p>Remus felt a bit more awake, not being able to stop staring at the boy. Sirius had always been playfully mocking him for spending so much time with the younger students, helping them whenever they asked. Seeing him taking his spot as a tutor - in Remus’s eyes - was the cutest thing ever.</p><p> </p><p>And as Sirius raised his look from the books for a moment, finding Remus’s face and smiling at him radiantly, Remus felt like his heart might give out. He was filled with a warm feeling, the one he’d been trying to push down for years now in a fear of disappointment and rejection, but he could no longer help it.</p><p> </p><p>At that moment he couldn’t pretend that what he was feeling for Sirius was just his imagination or something that would pass if the just tried not to think about it.</p><p> </p><p>Seeing the punk-rock prince of the whole Hogwarts suddenly being so brotherly and patient with a bunch of children had made him see it; how hopelessly in love he was with that kind, sweet soul under the leather jackets and macho attitude.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Remus felt someone crash down on the sofa right beside him, taking Sirius’s spot and stretching one arm over Remus’s shoulders. It was James, returning from Quidditch practice, still wearing his bright red robes.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s up? All good?” James asked, his voice slightly colored by worry, as always after full moons.</p><p> </p><p>Remus didn’t answer for a moment. He was still staring at Sirius, who was now high-fiving one of the first-years, and only realized James was still waiting for an answer as he gently bumped his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>He just couldn’t tear his eyes from Sirius. He wished he could just gaze at him forever.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m in love with him.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus blushed and pulled the collar of his sweater over his mouth. But as he’d finally said it out loud he knew it was true. He glanced at James anxiously.</p><p> </p><p>James looked at him, then shook his head, chuckling. “You figured that out just <em> now? </em> Man, I thought you knew.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus buried his face deeper into the collar. “That obvious?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that obvious. But don’t you worry.” James ruffled Remus’s hair. “Sirius is even worse.”</p>
