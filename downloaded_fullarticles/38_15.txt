    <p>Now, she sighed lightly while rubbing her eyes with the back of her too small hands. Being born again sucked, it was such a weird and odd sensation, like…ewww. Though she did find it amusing that she was born on the same day as her first life, go figure.</p><p>But still she smiled up at her Mama, Nana was even more beautiful in person. She was a bubbly and energetic person. A person who loved with all her heart, then she looked at her father and made a face, che what a loser.</p><p>She yawned a little while the idiot fussed over his Princess, sobbing dramatically saying his goodbyes to herself and Nana after a couple weeks after her birth.</p><p>She yawned again while looking at his retreating form and sighed a little. Sure, he would visit randomly during the year but, but Mama was going to be so upset and stressed about it. Being a first-time mother with no help at all is always so hard to do. She mentally shook her head while mentally kicking her father in the nads.</p><p>Hmph, watch when I am old enough, I am so kicking his ass for doing this to Mama.</p><p>Well, she mused to herself, my first few months of life where…utterly boring. All I did was eat, sleep and poop. She snorted mentally while playing with some colorful balls, while keeping an eye on her Mama. She has been acting strange, a month before her first birthday, she has always been feeling sick, and her emotions being so volatile from time to time.</p><p>She hummed to herself, while waiting anxiously for Father to answer the phone. I swear I am going to kick his ass when I can, hmph doesn’t deserve someone like Mama.</p><p>“Iemitsu...” Nana finally whispered into the phone.</p><p>Natsuki focused on her mama now…she noticed the small quiver in her voice, it was a nervousness and excitement all mixed together.</p><p>“Iemitsu...I…I’m pregnant again…” Nana said in a nervous, excited and slighty scared voice.</p><p>There was a small pause and I resisted the urge to smack my forehead hard against a wall. Of course, it was that, how could I be so dumb, she grumbled to herself while rolling her eyes. All the signs where there, the odd eating habits, the morning sickness and sore back and feet.</p><p>Then Nana started crying, happy tears rolling down her cheeks, controlling herself slightly and taking a deep breath she answered. “Apparently after your last visit…I am a few months along, should be born around October.”</p><p>Then she simply nodded a happy smile on her face, answering with a yes or no, a small blush creeping on her cheeks from time to time. As soon as the call ended, she walked over to her cute little girl and gently picked her up, settling her on her lap while she sat down on the couch.</p><p>“Guess what little Moon,” she hummed happily while poking Natsuki on the cheek. “You are going to be a big sister.” She exclaimed in glee while bouncing her up and down gently.</p><p>Natsuki looked up at her Mama and smiled gently patting her face happily her sky-blue eyes shining in baby glee at the news. Soon, soon her little brother will be here. She grinned a baby grin and settled on her Mamas chest intent for a good nap.</p><p>The months passed quickly, and October rolled by and Tsuna’s day was on them, Mama went into labour while out for a walk with her precious daughter in her stroller. She lightly clutched her stomach and screwed her eyes shut as her water broke.</p><p>Natsuki looked up at her Mama, concern and worry in her eyes.</p><p>“Do-don’t worry my little Moon, Mama is going to be fine.” Nana said in a slightly strained voice. She composed herself a little looking for some help, luckily for her, Mrs. Sasagawa was out for a walk as well with her son and daughter, who was born a few months ago.</p><p>Mrs. Sasagawa walked over to her, and lightly laid her hand on Nana’s shoulder.</p><p>“Is everything alright Nana??” Yuki Sasagawa asked, a little concerned, now she has heard about Nana through the gossip vine, but has never actually paid it any attention.</p><p>“Yu-Yuki!” Nana breathed out a little heavily holding herself upright thanks to the wall behind her. “Ho-Hospital…”</p><p>Yuki looked at her a little perplexed. “Hospital…” She repeated to herself, then finally noted her slightly damp dress and a small puddle of water below her feet.</p><p>“Oh…OH!!!” she took in a deep breath and pushed over her doubled stroller next to a concerned looking Natsuki. “Don’t worry little one, your Mama is going to be fine.”</p><p>She pulled out her phone and dialed for an ambulance while helping Nana with her breathing exercises. “I just called, they will be here in 10 minutes Nana, now breath with me.”</p><p>Nana smiled lightly, her face slightly flushed, and gently patted her dear Little Moon on the head. “Everything is going to be fine Natsuki-chan.”</p><p>Nana followed Yuki, while internally she was freaking out. “Oh, dear oh dear,” she mumbled before asking Yuki to use her phone, after dialing her husband and freaking out more, she explained what happened quickly as the ambulance arrived and she got in.</p><p>“But…but” Nana fussed a bit looking at her daughter.</p><p>Yuki catching her line of sight smiled and nodded reassuringly. “Don’t worry Nana, we will meet you there in a few moments I promise.”</p><p>Natsuki looked at her mother and nodded, god she wished she was older. She groaned internally while clutching her stuffed wolf. Being stuck in a child’s body royally sucked big time.</p><p>Nana smiled and gently patted her darling Little Moons head then she nodded to the paramedics, the ambulance doors closing and speeding off to the hospital after her nod.</p><p>“Now,” Yuki nodded and settled Natsuki in-between Ryohei and Kyoko. “Time is of the essence, Natsuki-chan is going to be a big sister!” she smiled and folded up the light weight stroller, attaching it to her back with ease and help of her scarf. “Off we go!!”</p><p>She power walked back to her house, just in time as her husband pulled into the drive way.<br/> <br/>It was a grueling few hours for Natsuki, she was hugging her stuffed toy, lightly leaning on Ryohei, his tiny hand gently running through her hair. He babbled baby talk, and the occasional, “I’s kay, yew Mama kay.”</p><p>She smiled lightly and snuggled into him, finally dozing off after a few hours of waiting.</p><p>Iemitsu barely made it, a few minutes before Tsuna was born.</p><p>Natsuki scoffed mentally looking at her Father, his antics and loud noise waking her from her nap. Ryohei and Kyoko also waking up and gently squeezing her. She sniffed internally at his dramatics, not impressed at all, and from the Sasagawa parent’s looks they shot him, they were not impressed at all.</p><p>About 30 minutes later, Mrs. Sasagawa picked her up and carefully walked into the room. She wasn’t very impressed with how her Father was acting, but let it slid, though how he kept calling Tsuna, Tuna Fishy was annoying as hell. Mrs. Sasagawa gently placed her on her Mamas lap. Her father gently handing Tsuna over to her Mama.</p><p>“Look Little Moon.” Nana gently spoke while carefully angling her arms so she could look at her baby brother better.</p><p>“This is your baby brother, Tsunayoshi Little Moon.” She smiled at her daughter gently poking her nose.</p><p>Natsuki stared at her baby brother, and smiled as the biggest and most beautiful chocolate brown eyes stared back at her. She reached out her tiny hand and gently stroked his hair. “Ts-Tsuna.” She mumbled out, grinning internally as she watched her Mama and Fathers eyes widen, because that, that was her first word.</p><p>Nana smiled and lightly kissed the top of her head, while Iemitsu cried dramatically over the whole thing.</p><p>“Don’t worry Tsuna,” she hummed lightly to herself, “I’ll take care of you and make you strong!” she smiled and stroked his fluffy brown hair again.</p><p>From there, Iemitsu stayed two months, semi helping around the house, and helping take care of Tsuna and Natsuki. Though he always backed out when it came to changing the diapers.</p><p>After those two months, he left, dramatically again. Crying and kissing us all repeatedly. Nana had a sad smile tugging at her lips, her eyes slightly moist. After he left, things settled down, the first few months, things where tense, and slightly stressing for Nana, raising two children on her own was difficult.</p><p>But around mid-January, she had an unexpected visit, in the form of one Sasagawa Yuki!</p><p>“Yu-Yuki-san!! What a surprise, what are you doing here.” Nana asked in a little surprised and slightly stressed out voice.</p><p>Yuki took one look at her and pushed her back inside, being careful of her children on the carries strapped in her front and back, and the bento boxes she had in her arms. She directed Nana to the kitchen and sat her down at the table placing a bento box in front of her. “Eat, I shall be right back.”</p><p>Yuki walked into the living room where the kids where napping, she carefully undid Kyoko from the front baby holder, and laid her down next to Natsuki, then she did the same to Ryohei, laying him down next to Tsuna. She covered them up and then walked back into the kitchen.</p><p>She smiled a bit as she watched Nana eat, she pulled out a canister of tea from her bag, then she grabbed a clean glass from the drying dishes. She poured Nana some tea then spoke in a firm but caring tone “As soon as you are done eating, you will march upstairs, shower and take a nap.” She said in a no-nonsense sort of voice.<br/> <br/>Nana looked up at her, blinking a couple of times. “Oh…Oh Yuki-san its fine, don’t worry. I’ll be ok….</p><p>She was cut off sharply. “None of that Nana-san!” she said sternly. “This is difficult on you Nana-san, basically raising your two children alone. I know this must be stressful and difficult for you, no need to deny it!”</p><p>Nana stared at her for a few minutes, not noticing silent tears rolling down her cheeks, or that Yuki moved and gently hugged her, rubbing comforting circles on her back. “It’s okay, it’s okay.” This went on for a few minutes until Nana calmed down, finished her food, went upstairs showered, got dressed and fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.</p><p>Yuki gently shook her head grumbling to herself for not doing this sooner.</p><p>And since that day, Sasagawa Yuki and Sawada Nana became close friends. Their children had play dates every other day. Would spend birthdays or holidays together. Nana still got excited for Iemitsu rare phone calls or post cards. But it didn’t hurt as much, after reading them or ending a call.</p>
