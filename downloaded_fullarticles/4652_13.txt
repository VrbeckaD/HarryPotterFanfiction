</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Amazingly, the drugs hadn’t worked its way completely out of Graham by 5:42 in the morning. </p><p> </p><p>After a night which left Percival’s ass, back, thighs, mouth, throat, arms, and even hands significantly <em>sore</em>, Percival would’ve thought the aphrodisiac that got into Graham’s system last night would’ve been spent by the morning. Evidently, there was still some left, because when Percival groaned, only semi-awake and face-down holding two pillows, there was still movement sliding in between his thighs, a little sluggishly aimed as though Graham couldn’t bother to open his eyes at this point. </p><p>It would make sense, because fucking non-stop for nearly six hours straight in every way possible since Graham returned home at mid-night just seemed - disastrous. </p><p> </p><p>Percival groaned a deeply tired, guttural noise into the two pillows he was holding, silently muttering something along the lines of ‘You can’t be serious…’ as the younger man looking equally fucked out, eyes still closed and hair sticking up in all directions, wriggled against Percival’s back. </p><p>“I think you need to—-go to a hospital….” Percival finally tried pleading, whining a little, perhaps. He’d checked last night - the potion that Graham was dosed with in a freak accident was merely overly concentrated for normal consumption, and lucky for them, Graham was in excellent health and at a young age where the kid could handle some fairly extreme heart rate and exercising. </p><p>Percival, on the other hand, felt his age ever so clearly after the whole night of obscene amount of sex. </p><p> </p><p>Graham made a grumbly noise against Percival’s nape, breath warm and puffing against the hairs their, jerking another exhausted little groan out of the older man as Graham’s cock seemed to have found the right opening to slot itself back into Percival. At this point Percival couldn’t even find it in himself to come up with any more creative ways to get the young man off. </p><p>There was another bout of sloppy rocking, Graham’s bleary murmur attempting to sooth his sore companion. “—Just a lil—m’re—sorry sorry sorry—-oh—-<em>oh</em>—<em>thank you—Perc—-thank you—-</em>” </p><p> </p><p>Percival felt it the moment he was truly filled to the brim, when anything new pouring into him drove the previous loads out. </p><p><em>Obscenely filthy</em>. </p><p>His sigh was a light one, at Graham who’d started snoring lightly—–<em>finally</em>—–after drooping against Percival, wringing out one last orgasm from this wild ride.</p><p>“—–you’re lucky I love you.” </p><p> </p>
