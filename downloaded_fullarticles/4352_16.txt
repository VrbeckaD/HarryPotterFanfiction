    <p>February 15th, 1965</p><p>Remus wiggled snugly into his canary yellow duvet, as his dad stood in the doorway and watched on fondly. His mother, Hope, tucked the corners beneath him, trapping him in like a caterpillar in a cocoon. </p><p>Not quite ready to go to sleep, he poked out his lower lip, widened his eyes in a way that he knew his parents couldn’t resist, and begged for one more bedtime story. </p><p>Laughing lightly, his mother bopped him on the nose with her index finger. “You’ve already had two bedtime stories baby. You should really be getting to sleep.” </p><p>“Please,” he whined. “Just <em>one</em> more.” </p><p>The corners of her lips twitched into an amused smile before she looked to his dad, who nodded, also smiling. </p><p>“Okay Remus, what kind of story would you like to hear?” </p><p>“Yay,” he shouted excitedly. “I want to hear the story of when Daddy saved you from that boggart.” </p><p>“That old story?” she asked, wrinkling her nose in mock exasperation. “You’ve heard it a hundred times.” </p><p>“But it’s my favorite mum,” he replied pleadingly. </p><p>“It’s a great story my love,” Lyall said from the doorway, eyes twinkling with amusement. “My heroics that day are unmatched. I fought the creature valiantly. Saved your life that day I did, and won the affection of the most beautiful women in Wales.” Hope snorted and shook her head while Remus giggled behind his hand. Even he knew that she hadn’t been in any true danger that day in the forest. But it was the day that his parents had fallen in love and he adored watching the two of them tell it. Neither could resist gazing at each other wistfully as they each told different parts of tale. </p><p>“It began in the summer of 1957,” his mother started while his dad made his way to the bed to sit and wrap a comforting hand around her. “I was walking through the forest near my cottage in Cardiff searching for the root of a wild leek-.”</p><p>“Allium am… ampeloprasum!” Remus supplied enthusiastically, proud of himself for remembering the name. </p><p>“That’s right,” she praised, beaming. “It’s known for its medicinal properties and I was sure that if I could dig up a few roots, I could transfer them to my garden. They aren’t bad in a nice stew either, if you cut them right.” </p><p>“They taste like onions, and give you stinky breath,” he said, crinkling his nose in a humored look of disgust. </p><p>“Do you want to hear the story or discuss the culinary merit of wild leeks?” his father asked as he tickled the boy. </p><p>“The story. The story!!” he gasped out between giggles. </p><p>“After walking a while, I found a small patch in a meadow. Just enough to carry in the basket I’d brought along.” <em>‘This is the good part,’</em> Remus thought as he settled back into his soft pillows. </p><p>“I bent down to dig up the roots when I heard a crunching noise behind me. Footsteps. When I turned around, a large man with yellow teeth and long matted hair was running toward me.” His mother’s voice became increasingly dramatic as she told the story. “I screamed and began to run, unfortunately I tripped on fallen branch and fell. When I looked up the man was gone and your father was standing there. He held out a hand to pick me up and said, ‘it’s all right, it was only a Boggart.’ I had no idea what he was talking about but I was so grateful that I jumped into his arms.”</p><p>“Suddenly there was this beautiful woman clinging on to me, thanking me for saving her life so I decided not to mention anything more about Boggarts,” his dad added with a sappy look upon his face. “It was love at first sight for me Remus. I knew right then that I would do anything for your mum. I offered to accompany her home and the rest is history.” Hope placed a sloppy kiss on his cheek. “A few months later I admitted that there had never been a big scary man. I was terrified that she would be angry but she wasn’t. She simply laughed and called me hopeless, which is of course what I was.”</p><p>“You still are hopeless,” Hope joked, causing Remus to giggle into his palm. </p><p>“Hopelessly in love,” Lyall countered, before kissing her soundly on the lips. “We got married a year later and you were born a year after that and we’ve lived happily ever after.” </p><p>Remus grinned broadly as he watched his parents affectionate exchange. His heart swelled every time he watched them interact because even though he was so young, he could see just how much they loved each other, and how much he was loved. </p><p>They had the perfect family and it would only get better, as his mum and dad were discussing having another baby. He’d overheard them talking about it the day before when they didn’t know he was listening. A little brother or sister for Remus to play with, he was practically bursting with excitement. He might even share all his favorite toys he thought, if the new baby didn’t slobber on them. </p><p>“Tell me the story of when daddy asked you to marry him,” he urged, attempting to take advantage of their good moods to stay up just a bit longer. </p><p>“Nice try kid,” his father said, poking him in the belly, causing him to laugh aloud and squirm beneath the covers. “It’s time for you to go to sleep, you have nursery school tomorrow and I have to be at the Ministry early.” </p><p>“But Daddy,” he argued. “Why do I have to go to nursery school with the Muggles? I’m a wizard, and I’ll go to Hogwarts. I’ll be in Hufflepuff like you, where the patient, loyal, and hardworking reside.” Remus lifted his arm dramatically, feigning the movement of a wand swishing through the air. </p><p>“Muggles aren’t so bad,” his mother said benevolently, causing him to dip his head guiltily. She was a Muggle and he liked the Muggle children at his school, he just didn’t like pretending he was one. He wanted to tell his friends about magic and the magical creatures he loved, but he couldn’t. “Besides, you can’t go to Hogwarts if you don’t know how to read properly or do arithmancy. Right?”</p><p>“Yes mum,” he mumbled, thoroughly chastised. </p><p>“You’re such a good boy Remus,” she cooed, kissing him on the forehead. </p><p>“Your mum and I love you,” his dad added, ruffling his light blond hair. “Now get some sleep.”</p><p>“Goodnight mum, dad,” he said, snuggling deeply in his bed covers while gripping his favorite stuffed dragon. A silvery blue Swedish Short-Snout that occasionally snorted blue smoke, much to Remus’ amusement. </p><p>“Goodnight,” they said in unison, hugging him in turn. With that they exited the room, hand in hand, his father clicking the light switch on the wall down. </p><p>The room was illuminated by the full moon that hung in the sky outside of his window. Clutching the plush dragon more tightly, Remus’ eyes fluttered closed.</p>
