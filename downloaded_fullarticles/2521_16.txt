    <p>When Hayato boarded the train, he had started walking around almost aimlessly. Among the crowd of students who were going back and forth between compartments, meeting up with other students and the like. </p>
<p>The shrinking charm he used on his luggage helped him avoid interaction with the helpful upperclassman. It wasn’t that he didn’t like them, it’s just that he wanted to be independent, and make sure he wasn’t relying on others as much as possible. </p>
<p>His pureblood family was very strict about that. Well, not strict enough to tell him to not make friends, but strict enough to remind him not to use other people for his own gain. </p>
<p>“If you want something, don’t hesitate to reach out with your own hands. We are not cowardly people Hayato.” His father had said, his posture and expression brimming with authority.</p>
<p>Then he had proceeded to grab a stuffed toy and buy it publicly. His stern expression unchanging as he put it into his own bag.</p>
<p>Honestly, Hayato had only learned shame thanks to his mother. </p>
<p>“If you want something you have to ask openly and be polite about it. We are not suspicious people Hayato.” She had said with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>Then she proceeded to emit a poisonous aura as she turned towards their house elf. “Excuse me Dali, but do you mind sending this package towards the Yukinoshitas? I’m sure they will find it very pleasant…” </p>
<p>….Or maybe he just owed it to his past life experience. </p>
<p>Right, he probably owed his change in character mostly to Hikigaya Hachiman from his past life, and this second chance in life. </p>
<p>Although he hadn’t acted on them, Hachiman’s words and advice were things that circled around his head even after he had become the head of his family’s fashion company. </p>
<p>He hadn’t seen him again after high school, though since he had met Yukinoshita maybe he will get to see him at Hogwarts-</p>
<p>Wait, what if he was reborn as a muggle, or what if he is a squib and was ostracized from his family. Although, if he were to be cast aside the orphanage that is one of the many businesses his family runs would have taken him in. </p>
<p>But what if he is being kept at home with his family despite that-</p>
<p>His thoughts came to a halt along with his feet when he saw a familiar face in one of the compartments. </p>
<p>Hachiman. </p>
<p>Hayato felt his face split into two with a smile as he slid opened the door and immediately closed it behind him before he could get hit by one of the other passengers. </p>
<p>He made a show of letting out a dramatic sigh and slumped down on the opposite end of the seat. </p>
<p>He then pretended to just notice the other kid, whose grey eyes had widened slightly out of surprise, and hands held his familiar (a black cat) closer. </p>
<p>He let out a smile and made a motion of waving with his hand. </p>
<p>“Sorry for barging in, do you mind if I stay here?” </p>
<p>Smooth criminal. He learned a thing or two about being a conman in his past life. </p>
<p>If Hachiman doesn’t remember his past life then his act won’t be noticed, and if he does, then surely Hachiman would notice with those keen eyes of his.</p>
<p>Hayato doubted that he remembered though, especially with how his eyes looked. </p>
<p>There was still something dark there, but less so, and his eyes had the childish curiosity any kid should have, and they were less gloomy, more pure and innocent.</p>
<p>Actually, Hachiman is really cute? </p>
<p>Hachiman as an answer to his question hunched his shoulders a little and darted his eyes away, a hint of pink tinting his cheeks.</p>
<p>“I-It’s fine.”</p>
<p>Hayato beamed, while an inner chaos brewed inside him.</p>
<p>
  <b> MOE MOE</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>WHAT IS WITH THIS MOE ATMOSPHERE</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>WAS HE THIS CUTE AS A KID?!</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>HACHIMAN MOE~~~~</b>
</p>
<p>At that moment he decided that no matter what house they both ended up in he was going to protect him. </p>
<p>Speaking of which…</p>
<p>“I heard you have to get shorted into houses in Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“Houses?”</p>
<p>Ah, seems he didn’t know.</p>
<p>“Ah, Hogwarts is divided into four houses, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, each baring the name of its founder…you get sorted depending on your qualities. Slytherin looks for ambitious qualities, Gryffindor is bravery, Ravenclaw is wit, and Hufflepuff is hardworking.” </p>
<p>“Did you get all this from a textbook?” Hachiman’s voice sounded like he wasn’t questioning that.</p>
<p>“I memorized it from ‘Hogwarts: A History’.”</p>
<p>“Plagiarism.” Hayato’s grins widened.</p>
<p>“But it can only count as plagiarism if I wrote it out the same way in a book, or an article. My hands are clean~”</p>
<p>Hachiman seems to pout at this. </p>
<p>Moe~</p>
<p>A few minutes of silence pass. The black cat meowing, the trains hooting. </p>
<p>It was a peaceful silence, less tense and uncomfortable than when he had first made it in here.</p>
<p>“…I wasn’t sure what I was until I got that letter.” Hachiman spoke again, scratching his (most likely) familiars head as it purred. </p>
<p>“Ah, so muggleborn than.” Hayato said. </p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, I guess…” suddenly he seemed to tense. Hayato could guess why.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing you met pureblood supremests.” He sighed scratching his head. </p>
<p>“There are different ways wizards and witches come to be. There are purebloods, half-bloods, then there are those who are born with magic from a completely muggle family. I think it’s because there were marriages between muggles and pureblood going on a long time ago but whatever, that’s another story. Getting back to topic, the one thing some of the pureblood families that are left can’t stand is the thought of muggles having magic. They have prejudices, thinking that muggleborn are thieves that stole magic.”</p>
<p>“That’s dumb.” Blunt as ever, but so true.</p>
<p>“I know.” Hayato agreed, his expression scrunched up as he thought of the times he had to deal with other pureblood kids. They were mostly arrogant, it was painful.</p>
<p>“Anyways, don’t worry about what they say. But you should learn a few protection charms before hand in case they hex you."</p>
<p>"Hex as in..."</p>
<p>"The worst they would to is a tickling charm, or stupify spell. They wouldn't kill you. But, well, there are children who might now be aware of the power they have, so it doesn't hurt to be safe."</p>
<p>Hachiman nodded, his expression looking serious.</p>
<p>Then he looked down at his familiar cat with an contemplating expression.</p>
<p>"Is it possible to cast a protection charm from a certain distance?..." </p>
<p>Hm? Perhaps Hachiman was talking about family members? </p>
<p>"Well, it is possible. But it might take a bit of work. Hold on."</p>
<p>He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his bag, enlarging the luggage in front of the others curious eyes before opening it and reaching into it.</p>
<p>It should be around-</p>
<p>"Here it is."</p>
<p>He pulls out a mirror. A charmed mirror to be exact.</p>
<p>"Now this isn't any ordinary mirror. This is a two-way mirror.” He grins while saying this.</p>
<p>"Not unlike the smartphones in the non magic world, you just, uh, call out the name of whoever holds the other mirror and… actually, it’s better if I just show you. Can I sit besides you?” </p>
<p>Hachiman suddenly looked like he had slightly tensed up, averting his gaze.</p>
<p>"Uh, sure."</p>
<p>His curiosity seems to have won out against his social instincts it seems.</p>
<p>Hayato got up to sit besides him, making sure not to breach his personal space too much as he held out the mirror in front of him.</p>
<p>He held it steadily, and called out the name of the place. </p>
<p>“Hayama Manor, living room.”</p>
<p>The reflection of the mirror changed shape in the blink of an eye, showing a huge living room instead of Hachiman and Hayato’s faces.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the huge living room stood a House Elf, dressed nicer compared to other house elves, taking notice of them she bowed.</p>
<p>“Hello young master, master and mistress are currently busy. Should Yuki fetch them?”</p>
<p>“No it’s alright Yuki-chan I was just showing my compartment buddy here how two-way mirror works.”</p>
<p>“…Young master, did you forget to ask for names again?” Yuki said, her expression unchanging.</p>
<p>Hayato froze before putting a palm of his forehead. “I’m so sorry.” He said.</p>
<p>Hachiman spoke “It’s fine. My name is Hikigaya Hachiman. It’s nice to meet you Yuki-san.”</p>
<p>Yuki immediately froze than hastily spoke “No need for such formalities, you may address Yuki as simply Yuki or Yuki-chan young Hikigaya.” </p>
<p>“Ah, alright…err…Yuki.” Hachiman struggled pronouncing her name.</p>
<p>“Please excuse young master Hayato as he doesn’t interact that much outside of the children from the Orphanage my master conducts.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, it’s fine, I guessed as much. He does know how to talk to other people at the very least.”</p>
<p>Hayato wanted to bury himself to the ground.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>He could hear the barest hint of a smile in Hachiman’s voice as he spoke again. “It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Well then, Yuki will be going to clean the other rooms.” With a snap of her fingers she vanished from sight. </p>
<p>Hayato ended the connection hastily, putting the mirror back into his luggage before using the shrinking charm again.</p>
<p>“….Want to redo?” Hayato stopped hiding his face in shame to look at Hachiman.</p>
<p>“…Hayama Hayato.” He says holding out a hand for a handshake, as his face takes a serious expression.</p>
<p>“Pfft, what an expression… Hikigaya Hachiman.” Surprisingly, Hachiman chuckled as he shook hands with Hayato.</p>
<p>Hayato beamed.</p>
