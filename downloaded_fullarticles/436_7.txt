    <p>With trembling hands, Harry hands the Resurrection Stone over to the ministry official. Draco watches it happen; watches as Harry, small, hunched, hair unkempt and eyes haunted, takes in one slow, painful breath before placing the stone on the woman’s hand.</p><p>When they’re out of the office, Harry kicks a chair, startling the man that’s waiting by the office door. Then his face scrunches, his fists curl—he starts to cry.</p><p>Draco holds him. He holds Harry through the grief, the anger, the pain. He holds Harry and hopes that it’s enough; that <em>he’s </em>enough to fill in the gap of all of Harry’s lost loved ones, enough to bring Harry back to reality, to stop him from stepping over the fine line that separates life from death.</p><p>He holds him, hoping if he holds him tightly enough Harry will feel alive again. </p><p> </p>
