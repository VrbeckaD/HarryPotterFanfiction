    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The rain hasn’t let up yet and it’s after 5 in the afternoon now. Remus shifts himself uncomfortably on the sunken settee and wonders how many more episodes of Angelina Ballerina he’s going to have to watch today. Teddy stares forlornly out of the rain-streaked window during every advert break as if expecting all that bad weather to go away to be replaced by the sun they had been hoping for.<br/>“Looks like we’ll have to skip the park today, Teds.”</p>
<p> “Bu’ daddeeeee!” Whines Teddy, affronted. They go to the play park <em> every </em> Saturday apart from special occasion and today might be one of the few times that they can’t make it. Sensing a tantrum, Remus grimaces. <br/>“We can go tomorrow kiddo, promise.” Please, please, please let it work, don’t let Teddy start howling now. Remus has a cracking headache.</p>
<p> The Angelina Ballerina theme tune starts up again just in time. Teddy turns away, his face lighting up, and plops down on the rug to watch. Sighing in relief, Remus stands up slowly as if all his joints are creaking with the effort. Nipping into the kitchenette to make a cup of tea, he wonders how long it will be until Sirius gets home.</p>
<p> Sirius works in a five star restaurant in central London as the maître d’, meaning he usually works long shifts and barely ever has the weekend off. It’s not like Remus expects him to be here - they’re not together or anything, and he doesn’t have any parental obligations as such. He just likes his help and company sometimes - especially on Saturdays and Sundays when Teddy doesn’t have play group. Sirius is great with the energetic toddler and has a real flair for keeping Teds occupied. Apart from play group hours and the occasional crèche session, it’s the only break Remus gets from being a full time single parent.</p>
<p> Dumping the teabag in the bin and adding plenty of sugar and milk, he wanders back to the couch and sits down. Teddy glances up at him before climbing into his lap, snuggling up to his dad’s chest. <br/> “When dada home?” Remus groans, setting his mug of tea down on the floor next to the sofa. <br/> “Teds, we talked about this. Pads isn’t dada, <em> I’m </em> dada.” <br/> “No, you dadd-ee!” <br/> “Pads is your <em> Uncle. </em> Uncle Siri, remember? Or Pada. Depends on the day.” <br/> “Pada dada!” <br/> “Pada is not dada!” <br/>“Pada Teddy Dada! DADA! Pada! Pada dada!” <br/>“Teds, Pads isn’t your da-”<br/> <br/>The sound of the door swinging open can be heard throughout the small flat, accompanied by a familiar voice hollering.<br/> “Dada’s home!” <br/>“Oh my God.”</p>
<p> Teddy squirms out of Remus’ lap, nearly knocking the hot tea, which Rem quickly moves out of the way. Sirius appears in the sitting room with a huge grin on his face, holding a couple of Sainsbury’s bags in his hand and a plain white bag in the other. <br/> “DADA!” Shrieks the hyperactive toddler, grabbing Sirius’s long legs with his stubby arms. He steps onto Sirius’s feet and holds tight to the dress trousers he’s wearing. Grinning, Padfoot shuffles into the room with small steps with his hands holding Teddy’s shoulders protectively, causing him to stoop, juggling the shopping bags. Remus raises his eyebrows in half amusement and half exasperation, standing before Sirius with his arms crossed over his chest. <br/> “Hi, ‘ <em> dada’ . </em>I had wondered why my son had recently taken to calling you that.”</p>
<p> Sirius doesn’t even bother to look sorry when he apologises, smirking and flicking his long hair from his face. Sighing and smiling despite himself, Remus stops nursing his tea for a moment to return Sirius’s hug. “Good day at work?”</p>
<p> Rolling his eyes, Sirius dislodges Teddy from his legs and goes to the kitchenette to put away the shopping. <br/> “It was awful, as usual. Trying to keep the staff in check is hell and so many orders were being sent back today - we had two really picky fucks - I mean fluffs -  in at lunch time. Ridiculous - and their <em> manners </em>were atrocious! I don’t know why I bother, Rem, honestly. Oh, I brought you back some of the chocolate cake you like again.” He signals to the plain bag he placed on the counter next to him, turning on the kettle to make himself a coffee. “Anyway, I’m here now.”</p>
<p>“What did you get at the shop?” Asks Remus, taking a peek into the plastic bags Sirius brought back after yet again forgetting to take the reusable ones from the house. <br/> “Some pasta shapes, tomatoes, basil - we’re having pasta for dinner by the way. Also got the milk and bread you asked for. Oh, and strawberry milk for Teds, marshmallows and jelly beans for me, chocolate for you.” <br/> “Marshmallow!” Yells Teddy, running into the back of Sirius’s legs in his excitement. <br/> “I don’t know why you don’t just buy a jar of Ragu or something, Padfoot, it’s much easier.” Sirius looks at Remus in horror as he leans down to ruffle Teddy’s curly hair, so much like his dad’s. <br/>“Do you have any idea how much sugar is in that stuff? And I’m a fu-fluffing maître d’ Rem, I cook like a bloo-...blooming celebrity chef!”</p>
<p> Remus shrugs. He took Teddy to McDonalds for his lunch, but he’s not about to tell Sirius that.<br/> “Teds and dadee ha’ Micky D!” Pipes up Teddy helpfully, looking up at Sirius with adoration. <br/>“Micky D’s, huh?” Sirius scowls at Remus reproachfully, sweeping Teddy up in his arms. “Bad daddy!” He scolds, stretching a foot out to give Moony a kick. “There’s a Pret just down the road and you went to McDonalds. In fact, there’s leftovers from last night’s mushroom stroganoff in the fridge!”</p>
<p> Holding his hands up in an appeasing gesture, Remus pulls Teddy’s fingers away from Sirius’s nose patiently. His son scowls at him, an expression scarily like Sirius’ just a moment ago. <br/> “I can cook the pasta if you want.” He offers, hoping to quell Sirius’s sulking with his generosity. Sirius instead looks utterly horrified and holds Teddy closer. <br/> “You will cook <em> nothing </em> in my flat, Remus John Lupin.” <br/> “Actually it’s my flat.” <br/> “I live here, and you will cook <em> nothing </em>in this flat! You’ll blow it up!”</p>
<p> They sit down on the sofa again, Teddy clinging determinedly to Sirius’s shirt as he sits in his lap. Remus smiles affectionately as he watches his best friend and his son carry on with one another, Sirius tickling under Teddy’s arms while the toddler pulls at his long black hair, squealing.</p>
<p> Today at McDonalds, he and Teddy had run into Neville, a little boy from Teddy’s playgroup, and his mum Alice. Alice sat next to them at their little table and fed Neville spoonfuls of McFlurry while chatting away about typical ‘mum stuff’ to Remus. Teddy glowered at Neville as he got ice cream all over his Disney top, chewing on a chicken nugget as best as he could. <br/> “No dada today, Teddy?” Alice inquired kindly, absently wiping ice cream from her son’s face. <br/> “Dada work.” Teddy grumbled sadly into his then-mushy chicken nugget. “Dadd-ee say no park til no rain. Dada take me.” He shot Remus a scowl at this. <br/> “Ah, is dada more brave than daddy, Teddy?” Alice joked, shooting Remus a smirk. “Surely not. Daddy got you down here, didn’t he? Let’s hope you can get to the park.” <br/> “No, no. No park until it stops raining, eh, Teds? Or you’ll get a wet bum and Siri will be cross because you’re wearing the nice trousers he bought you.” <br/> “Oh, dada bought those trousers for Teddy? You’re lucky, my Frank won’t go near the clothes stores. You two are such a good couple.” <br/> “Ah, we’re not a - um… Couple. I mean, we’re not together. Sirius and I.” Alice had been shocked at this, raising her eyebrows. <br/>“No? Oh, I thought you were - sorry Remus. It’s just, he’s so good with Ted here, and the way you look at each other - I mean, you know. Sorry, Rem. Just an assumption.”</p>
<p> This was a pretty regular occurrence. Most of the parents at Teddy’s playgroup think that he and Sirius are together - Remus can tell by the way that they all ask where ‘dada’ is whenever he goes alone to pick Teddy up. He wonders if Sirius has noticed that too. Looking at him now, Remus feels a familiar and unwelcome stir in his chest which he quickly pushes away. No, he’s not going to let those feelings crop up just now. They just get in the way of things - they make him awkward. When he snaps back to the present, Sirius is looking at him quizzically and Remus blushes, realising that he’s been staring. <br/>“Dadd-ee! Me an’ dada watch Frozen! You!” <br/>“Oh god no.” Remus breathes, looking at Sirius in horror in a way that says ‘how could you let this happen?!’</p>
<p> Teddy recently got over his Frozen obsession, but it still crops up sometimes, like today. Remus and Sirius have been forced to watch it over 50 times now. While Sirius now sings along and even made up dances for him and Teddy to do while they watch, Remus feels like crying every time it comes on. Begrudgingly, he gets up and crosses to the telly. He almost wants to pretend that he’s lost the DVD to avoid watching it, but a glance back at Teddy’s excited face makes him change his mind.</p>
<p> Teddy sits on his lap while Sirius goes to change out of his work clothes. Remus wraps an arm around his son, resting his chin on top of the toddler’s head. Sirius returns in black joggies and a worn out band t-shirt he bought not long after finishing high school. His hair is pulled up in a bun, which causes Rem’s eyes to follow the lines of his long pale neck up to his face accidentally. Blushing (again), Remus jiggles Ted on his knee a little bit, humming along with whatever song is on at the moment.</p>
<p> “I’m going to start the dinner.” Remus jumps as Sirius murmurs in his ear, quiet so as not to disturb Teddy. He’s leaned over the back of the settee and Rem can smell his aftershave and the cigarettes on his breath. He nods his silent agreement, forcing himself to keep his eyes trained on the screen rather than following Sirius’ path to the kitchenette in the corner.</p>
<p> Sirius busies himself with cooking, trying to be as quiet as possible with the pots and pans in the cupboard. He’s excited to serve up - he’s found alphabet shaped pasta which Teddy will love, and since he can make his own sauce it’s healthier than the Heinz tins. With the pasta boiling in the pot, he sets about making the red pesto, toning down the chilli for both Teddy and Remus’ sake, as neither can really handle spice at all. He’s been feeling preoccupied all day after last night and he continues to feel only half-present as he tips his ingredients into the old, slow food processor.</p>
<p> The night before, Sirius had gotten out of work late to a text from James politely requesting his presence at a pub near the Potter family’s little house. He called Moony straight away to check if it was alright for him to head out - of course it was, Teddy is in bed already after watching enough Thomas the Tank Engine that a blind man could describe accurately Thomas’ shiny blue carriages and jolly face - and went on his way.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>James greeted him with a huge grin and a mildly painful thump on the back. <br/> “Hey Prongs!” Sirius winced slightly, flopping down next to his long-term best friend after ordering a beer. <br/> “Hey Pads, how’s Moony and Teddy?” <br/> “Ah, they’re good. Teds is getting more and more like Moony every day, it’s frightening.” <br/>“I get you, Haz is so much like Lily that I’m worried his first words will be to lecture me.” Sirius laughed at that, taking a drink of his beer and feeling himself relax after a long day at work.</p>
<p> The evening whiled away easily, James and Sirius talking crap about kids, asking about each other’s work - James is on the police force - and generally making fun of each other. After a few beers, James leans over the table with a serious look on his face.<br/> “So, Pads, how’s it going in, y’know, the… relationship department?” Sirius rolls his eyes, leaning back. <br/> “James I’ve told you, I’m not looking for a-” <br/>“Because you’re too busy pining after Remus, yes, I know.”</p>
<p>Sirius was shocked. First of all, he’d never told James about his feelings towards their mutual best friend. Secondly, he certainly hadn’t let on that the reason he had spent so many years single and celibate was due to some strange loyalty to a non-existent relationship with said best friend. James is looking him square in the face, confident in his assessment of the situation. Sirius has always hated how observant his often-dense friend can be. <br/> “I… Well, I just…” <br/> “Are you ever going to tell him how you feel, Sirius?” Sirius flinches at the use of his full name, a rare occurrence with James. He hadn’t realised he was coming out here to be interrogated about his love life and romantic feelings. <br/> “No! I mean, it would mess everything up - for one, we live together. And if he hated me for it, I mean, think about Teddy - he calls me dada for christ sake, James. It’d be hell for him if I had to leave.” <br/> “So you’re going to be single for the rest of your days, never dating a single person or starting a life of your own. All so you can be daddy for Teddy, who isn’t even your kid. Sirius, come on - that’s no way to go about things.” <br/> “I won’t not start a life of my own! I have my own life. I’m the maître d’ of a successful restaurant, James, and I’m quite well liked. And who cares if Teddy isn’t mine - his mum’s hardly in the picture after all. You should know - you work with her.” Sirius fumes, glaring at James. <br/> “I think you should tell him. I mean, you live with him - surely he deserves to know.” <br/> “It’s better he doesn’t know!” <br/> “Just think, Sirius. It’s a two bedroom flat and when Teddy grows up, he’ll want a room of his own. What are you going to do, sleep on the couch? Unless you and Remus get together, you’re going to move out at some point. Don’t you see that?” <br/>“Shut the fuck up James, how could you know that things will pan out that way? Just… Just… Fuck you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius had stormed off after that, but he still texted James when he got in to let him know he was back at the flat safely. Force of habit, he told himself at the time, but now he knows that he was never really mad at James - just mad at the truth of what he was saying.</p>
<p> Sighing heavily, Sirius stoops over the chicken pieces he’s frying up in garlic oil and herbs. Whether it would be better to tell Remus his feelings or not, he won’t do it. He’ll find a way to get over him, somehow. Better that than having to face the consequences of Remus knowing.</p>
<p> He tips the chicken in with the pesto pasta, stirring it through and ensuring everything is well heated before dishing it into colourful plastic bowls. Using a fork with a giraffe head and neck for a handle, he picks through the bowls to spell Teddy’s name out in the blue bowl and Remus’ out in the pretty pink one. In his own bowl, red, he spells out ‘cool’.</p>
<p> “Dinner’s ready!” He calls, hearing Teddy whining as Remus pauses the movie. “You want some strawberry milk with it, Teds?” <br/> “Stawberree milk!” <br/>“I think that’s a yes please, Sirius.” Remus calls after his son, standing up and stretching. He picks up Teddy and takes him to his high-chair. “Can I get a beer, Pads?”</p>
<p>“What’s the magic word, Rem?” He can hear Moony sigh from his place at the counter, pouring out the strawberry milk.<br/> “Please may I have some beer, Sirius?” The sarcasm is strong in Remus’ tone and Sirius  pretends he doesn’t hear it as he puts the bowls he’s been juggling down. He goes back to fetch the drinks - one strawberry milk, a beer and a tall glass of water - then sits down next to Teddy. <br/> “Dadd-ee! Mine say Tedd-ee!” <br/> “Yeah Teds, mine says my name too!” <br/> “It say dadd-ee?” <br/> “Nah Teds, it says my first name - Remus.” <br/> “Ree-mus…” Teddy considers slowly, looking down at his bowl of pasta. “No, you dadd-ee.” He turns to Sirius with a serious expression. “You dada? You dindins say dada?” <br/>“Nope, Teds, mine says ‘cool’ because I’m the coolest guy ever!” Sirius boasts with a grin, puffing out his chest. Teddy giggles excitedly, patting his hands on the table of his high chair. “Ok kiddo, open wide for the choo-choo train!”</p>
<p> Teddy chews his mouthful carefully before wrinkling up his nose.<br/> “Onion! You put onion in!” He complains, trying to spit out his mouthful. <br/> “No, Teddy, that’s <em> garlic. </em> ” Sirius explains, despairing at Teddy’s inability to tell the difference - just like his father. <br/> “Ga-lic?” Teddy asks, his mouth still full. He chews it again slowly. <br/> “Garlic.” <br/>“Oh. Ok.” The toddler finally concedes, swallowing his mouthful. He eats the rest of his pasta without complaint. Remus watches with amazement - he’s never able to get Teddy to eat anything he decides he doesn’t like.</p>
<p> After eating his dinner and finishing off his strawberry milk, Teddy begins to yawn. Once Frozen is finished he’s half asleep and hasn’t been performing his and Sirius’ dances half as well as usual. Once the credits come on he plops down onto the floor with a huff, leaning back against Remus’ legs sleepily. <br/>“Time for bed, guy?” Remus asks, leaning over his knees to look at his son. Teddy nods against him, eyes shut and his little mouth open wide in a yawn. “Let’s get you ready then.”</p>
<p> Sirius volunteers to put Teddy to bed, much to his delight. Swooping the tot up into his arms, he carries him off to the room he and Remus share. Once safely put to bed in his big cot under the window, holding tight to the stuffed black dog toy Sirius gave him for Christmas, Teddy begins drifting off. Looking down at him affectionately, Sirius brushes a blonde curl away from his face before heading back out into the living room to tidy up the dishes.</p>
<p> “Hey, I got the dishes.” Remus informs him as he enters the room. He’s spread out across the couch languidly with a cup of tea, looking calm and slightly tired.<br/> “Tah, Moony. He’s probably already asleep, tired little bug. You don’t look much more alert yourself.” <br/> “Nah I’m alright Pads. He had me up at 7 this morning even though there’s no play group, demanding to go to the park. He was so grumpy when he realised you were at work, by the way.” <br/> “Sorry, Rem. I did try to get the day off to help out, but we’re really busy just now. They’re pretty useless without me around. I’m the best maître d’ ever, after all.” <br/>“And modest, too!”</p>
<p> Sirius pulls a face at Remus for that, toeing at his friend’s legs to try and get a space on the sofa. When he’s sitting down, he pulls out his phone and starts to absentmindedly flip through his apps. Remus lies back, throwing his legs over Sirius’ lap contentedly. It’s so nice to be around Pads like this, all comfortable and quiet. He tries to slyly watch Sirius’ face as he studies his phone, before becoming curious about what he’s doing. Sitting up, he shuffles over to look at the phone over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” He asks warily as Sirius flips past numerous selfies of men and women Remus has never seen before.<br/> “It’s called tinder.” Sirius shrugs, his tone purposefully nonchalant. <br/>“Oh. I’ve heard of that.” Remus has to contain his grimace. Sirius is using an app for picking up people for like, dates and sex and stuff. The thought of Padfoot with anyone else causes a painful twist in his stomach. “What are… What are you using that for?”</p>
<p> Sirius looks at Remus carefully, considering his answer. He feels embarrassed about this for some reason and he suddenly has a strong desire to just delete this app from his phone and never think about it again. With Remus so close to him, he can’t remember why he’s looking for anyone else. <br/> “Dates. Guess I’m getting on a bit, so I should start taking this whole relationship thing seriously. You should get one, Rem.” <br/> “I’d rather not.” Remus replies curtly, shifting away from Sirius to return to his tea. Taken aback by this brusque response, Sirius locks his phone and sets it aside. <br/>“What’s up, Moony? Did I do something?”</p>
<p> Remus looks into Sirius’ worried face and feels guilty for his sharp reaction. He blushes and looks down at his tea, taking a drink while he steadies himself. He wishes he could just tell Sirius the truth.<br/> “No, Pads, just… Just ignore me.” Sirius, still concerned, places a hand gently on Remus’ arm, drawing his friend’s attention back to him. <br/> “I’m always here if you need to talk. You sleep in my room tonight - I’ll get Teddy if he wakes up.” <br/> “Yeah… Okay. I think I’m just gonna hit the sack, you know. Long day. Thanks for making dinner, Sirius. I really appreciate it.” <br/>“Don’t mention it, Rem. Sleep well. I’ll see you in the morning.”</p>
<p> When Remus disappears into Sirius’ bedroom, Sirius looks back to his phone guiltily. Picking it up and unlocking it, he swipes left a few more times. He sees a few people he knows from work, swiping left on each of them. Finally, one man, good looking and with some common interests - good food, wine, cats, motorbikes - comes up and Sirius scrutinises the selfies he’s uploaded. <br/>“Fabian Prewett, huh…” He mumbles, raising an eyebrow. He hums in consideration before finally swiping right. He glances again at his bedroom door, knowing Remus is in there. Something about this feels so wrong, like he’s doing it behind Remus’ back. But it’s nothing to do with Remus, is it?</p>
<p> In Sirius’ room, Remus pads around picking up a few stray items of dirty clothes from the floor and dumps them in the laundry basket, sighing exasperatedly. Sirius manages to mainly contain his mess to his room, but it always astounds Remus how someone so pernickety and pretentious can be this untidy. He stares around, feeling a little lost despite having been in this room a million times. He doesn’t know what he’s trying to grasp in his mind, but he feels like he should be doing something. Shrugging the feeling away, he strips down to his boxers before climbing into Sirius’s unmade bed. The pillow smells like Sirius’s shampoo and aftershave and he can smell sweat and herbs and peppermint throughout the room. Remus lies his head on the pillow, feeling a little embarrassed at himself as he takes deep breaths through his nose. He feels himself drifting off, wishing he could be near Sirius to breath in his scent from his skin and his hair rather than his sheets. When sleep takes him, he dreams he’s looking in a mirror that shows the onlooker whatever he or she most desires. He’s holding Teddy, and next to his reflection stands Sirius, tall and beautiful as ever, smiling at him like he’s in love.</p>
