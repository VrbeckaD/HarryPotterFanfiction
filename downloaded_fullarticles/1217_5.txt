<span>“What do you mean, closed?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I mean that the nursery is not open today.” Hildith Pippery, the manager of Little Owls, surveyed Harry disapprovingly. She was a plump witch with silver hair in a dove-shaped clasp and glasses that she wore on a chain around her neck, but still managed to be rather intimidating. “We </span>
  <em>
    <span>did </span>
  </em>
  <span>send out a communication. A fortnight ago, in fact.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Well, I didn’t get it.” Harry shifted his daughter in his arms; she was playing with the fringe of his scarf, blithely unconcerned by what was going on. “I’ve got to teach all day - what am I supposed to do?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I’m sorry, Mr Potter, but we expected parents and guardians to make alternative arrangements when they were informed of today’s closure. Those arrangements are not our concern.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He could tell she was slightly judging him and Ginny for being such disorganised parents that neither of them had known. It was possible that Ginny did know, but in her rush to leave earlier had forgotten to remind Harry. Moreover, if Harry himself hadn’t been running late he might have discovered his predicament in good time to sort it out. Whichever way you looked at it, they’d cocked up. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Bugger. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>---</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I do appreciate punctuality, but ten years early may be pushing it a little,” said McGonagall. “You may find some lessons hard to follow.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Lily blinked at her. They regarded each other seriously. Harry had the odd sense that a great many things were passing, unspoken, between the two of them. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I know this isn’t great, I’m sorry,” he said. “I thought maybe Madam Pomfrey might be able to look after her -”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>McGonagall straightened up. “Madam Pomfrey is needed in the hospital wing - Humphrey Grant attempted to transfigure himself into an octopus last night, on a dare, and currently has excess limbs.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Oh,” said Harry. “That was a bit stupid of him.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“To put it mildly,” said McGonagall. “And I am meeting with the governors shortly. If you are able to manage for an hour, I can take her when I am finished.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Y- you?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Me, yes,” she said, fixing him with a look that sent him right back to getting caught messing around in Transfiguration. “Unless you would rather find another alternative? Professor Heyes is free this morning, I believe -”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No!” Harry said, a little too quickly; he did not miss the flash of amusement in McGonagall’s eyes. “No, I mean … if you’re sure it’s OK …”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He looked down at Lily, rather disbelieving, as McGonagall strode away. “Blimey, I wonder what that’ll be like …”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yut-yut?” said Lily hopefully.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“I haven’t got any yoghurt, we’ve got to go and teach now, Lil. It’s the seventh years first, they’re not bad, but you can bet any work’ll go right out the window as soon as they see you …”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He kept up a stream of commentary on the way to his classroom, although Lily didn’t seem to be listening - she was craning her neck in great interest to peer at the portraits and suits of armour. Inside, he conjured a heap of soft cushions and plonked her down in front of his desk. She immediately got to her feet and started to wander off. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“No, no - Lilypad - Daddy has to work, OK? Can you sit and play? Look, here’s Dragon -”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>She took the plush red dragon from him and hugged it, frowning at Harry over the top of its head. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Ohmygod,” came a breathless voice from the doorway. “Baby!”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>The seventh years had arrived. They clustered around Lily like a flock of hens around corn scattered on the ground, cooing, and she gazed back at them without a flicker of emotion, sucking distractedly on Dragon’s ear. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“All right, this isn’t a zoo,” Harry called. “Sit down please, everyone.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“But she’s so </span>
  <em>
    <span>cute!”</span>
  </em>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Yes,” said Harry - he was not boastful, but even he had to admit that his daughter was exceptionally cute; she had insisted on choosing her own clothes that morning (“My do!”) and was sporting yellow dungarees over a top covered with unicorns, her bright red hair pulled into two untidy bunches - “but so am I, and I don’t want you goggling at me, either.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>That got a laugh, but it didn’t get them to sit down, especially when Lily pulled herself up and toddled over to Harry, thrusting Dragon out to him. He crouched down and accepted the (slightly soggy) toy with the enthusiasm of one who has just received something they have longed for all their life. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Lily looked pleased. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Dag’n,” she told him. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Have you been chewing Dragon?” Harry asked her. Her response was to blow a spit bubble - “so like your mother,” Harry murmured - and take off again, abandoning poor Dragon, in pursuit of whatever had caught her interest now. Harry grinned; all stages of childhood had their hidden joys, but he particularly loved this time, when they were still exploring the world that was opening up to them more and more every day. With James, when he was still an Auror, he’d missed a lot of it - so he wasn’t letting any moments with Lily slip through his fingers. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>He wasn’t the slightest bit surprised to see that she’d gravitated towards the shockingly pink and definitely non-uniform ankle boots that Trixie, one of his students, was wearing, although the rest of the class reacted like she had just sprouted wings and started zipping around the room. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>“Ohh, she is so sweet,” sighed Zwena, watching Lily stroke the suede of Trixie’s boots, completely absorbed. “Can’t we just play with her, sir?” </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Harry glanced, wavering, at the lesson plan on his desk. This was NEWT year for them, they really oughtn’t miss any time, he thought. On the other hand, what were the chances of them actually concentrating on a word he said with Lily there? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, go on then," he said, thinking that at least it would be good practice for those who went on to have children. Lily was utterly enthralled at being the centre of undivided attention - quite literally, when the class had moved the desks and arranged themselves on the floor around her - and happily zigzagged between the numerous pairs of welcoming arms. It was rather nice, too, Harry observed, to see the students having fun with magic as they competed to entertain his daughter; so often they were frowning over textbooks and learning spells for the sake of exams. Now these seventeen and eighteen year olds were sprawled across the floor like children, seized by fits of giggles in their efforts to produce the most interesting spectacle. He watched as Lily clapped her hands in delight at the sight of multi-coloured bubbles floating from the tip of someone's wand, and smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>None of them were paying any attention to the passing of time, and it was only Harry who noticed when there was a knock on the door. He called, "Come in!", and Gabe Hutchinson, one of his fourth years, stuck his head into the classroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Professor McGonagall asked me to pass on a message, she sends her apologies but there's some sort of problem so she isn't free after all … wow," said Gabe, clocking the scene before him. "Is this what we're going to be doing later, too?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No," said Harry, not entirely certainly, as he scooped Lily up. Gabe brightened. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey, that's the baby that got me a week off homework!" </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>"That is her full name," Harry agreed. "We mostly call her Lily, though."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Does she bite?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not hard."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gabe thought about it and decided he would rather not risk it. He left for his next lesson, leaving Harry wondering what on Earth he was going to do now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sir," said Zwena, apparently reading his mind (or perhaps the strained expression on his face). "</span>
  <em>
    <span>We've</span>
  </em>
  <span> got a free period next …"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can't pay you," said Harry. One of the boys looked disgruntled and picked up his bag.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, for free! We want to! Please? Then you won't be distracted … I've got four little brothers, sir, I know what to do with babies."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry hesitated; he wasn't at all sure about leaving his one year old daughter with teenagers, but he had the first years next and he doubted they'd be as keen on babysitting. For one thing, there were a lot more of them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes, OK," he said finally, to gasps of delight from those that had offered. "There's an empty classroom just down the corridor - don't go anywhere else - and if there's even the slightest problem -"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We know, sir," said Trixie earnestly. "We're </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> responsible."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry doubted that, but then he had become a godfather when he was seventeen, he supposed, and arguably he had been significantly less responsible, with his habit of getting nearly killed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first years arrived then, Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, clattering noisily into the classroom with none of the timidness they'd had just a month earlier. Lily, who had been drooling on Harry's shoulder, looked up at the sudden commotion and let out a deafening screech.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tegg-EEEE!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had somehow spotted, amongst the crowd, the light brown hair of Teddy Lupin, and reached her arms out desperately for him. He extracted himself from the herd of first years and bounded up to take her carefully from Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hello, trouble!" he said cheerfully to Lily. To Harry, he said, "I didn't know it was take your pet to work day."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please stop referring to her as an animal," said Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is she house-trained?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I seem to recall -" Harry raised his voice ever so slightly - "that when you were small, you would crawl around in your underpants and insist you were a dog."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy flushed scarlet. "I don't remember that -"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can find the pictures, if you like."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Teggy," said Lily happily, patting his head with a small chubby hand, as the assembled students laughed and Teddy closed his eyes, evidently wishing he knew how to disappear on the spot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry didn't get a lot of teaching done that day; however, it has to be said that Lily was the most popular guest ever to appear in a Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson - at least, until the nappy incident, but that is a story best left untold.</span>
