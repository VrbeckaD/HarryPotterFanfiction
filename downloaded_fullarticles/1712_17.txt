          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story begins in the headmaster's office, headmaster Albus Dumbledore is discussing the upcoming Triwizard Tournament with his girlfriend Minerva McGonagall. </p><p>Minerva asked, "Do you really believe that the boy put his name in?"</p><p>Albus smiled. "No, but we must keep quiet to find out who truly put his name in the cup."</p><p>Minerva muttered, "We have to keep it a secret?"</p><p>Albus said, "Yes, my dear Minnie. We must keep it under our hats until we discover who put his name in."</p><p>Minerva frowned. "It's dangerous and he's far too young to be competing."</p><p>Albus grinned. "Harry has proven his worth time and time again. So, I do not think we need to worry too much about the matter."</p><p>Minerva replied, "I hope you're right, Al."</p></div>
