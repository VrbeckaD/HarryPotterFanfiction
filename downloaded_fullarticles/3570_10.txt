    <p>Draco accepted the cup of tea and cradled it to his chest, allowing the warmth to envelope him. He almost sighed contentedly at the feeling. In that bubble of bliss, the sudden heat grounded him, and in that moment of overwhelming happiness he felt that he could face the day.<br/>
He watched Harry leave the kitchen in a hurry and the feeling died in his chest suddenly. It was as though a shutter had fallen over his eyes and he had tumbled into the emptiness again. He felt lethargic, his eyes and limbs heavy.  </p><p>‘I’m off to work, Draco. Do you think you could get some shopping in?’ Harry called from the lounge, following by a thud. ‘Tripped over the damn coffee table again!’</p><p>Draco followed, dragging himself into the spacious lounge. He smiled thinly, hoping it conveyed a feeling he hadn’t truly felt in a long time. Harry scrambled to his feet, flushed. He smiled brightly, adjusting his glasses.</p><p>‘Was thinking I could make a vegetarian meal for ‘Mione and Ron or-‘ Draco could feel his head lightly nodding to Harry’s suggestions, the smile plastered on his face as he watched his partners hands gesture widely as though he too was swept up in the conversation. It felt as though there were holes in his brain, and his thoughts would trickle through and his words would get stuck on his tongue. ‘Draco?’</p><p>‘Sounds delightfully boring’ Draco quipped, quirking an eyebrow and throwing a glance at Harry over a gulp of tea. Draco waited a moment with bated breath for the feint to be accepted. Harry nodded energetically, threw a thumbs up and darted from the room.</p><p>‘Catch you later!’ he called. Draco remained silent, sliding down the wall as soon as the door clicked shut. The sadness was creeping upwards from his toes, curling within his stomach. He could feel the unwanted wave tumbling through him and no amount of positive thinking, or hot tea, was going to keep him afloat. Draco launched the mug across the room. It exploded against the far window as he began to cry. He choked on the sudden sadness, sobbing loudly and uncontrollably. His body shook with the nausea. He felt unmoored from the moment of sanity he had just glimpsed.</p><p>
  <em>Why am I crying? Why am I crying?</em>
</p><p>His fingers wound painfully in his hair as he began to rock with the sobs. His body shook. Draco felt as though his brain were rotting; he could imagine it, the grey mass leaking, dripping his sanity down the drain.<br/>
Draco knocked his head back against the wall and gulped hungrily, screwing his eyes shut.</p><p>‘I-I can do this’ he hissed, his voice catching. ‘I’m a fucking Malfoy’ he slammed his head into the wall, hard. The crack of pain awakened him to the room around him, as though he was rising from a deep slumber. Draco’s eyes darted around the room as his chest began to rise and fall more gradually, he blinked in a daze, the tears gone, his face wet. He swiped at his cheeks with shaky hands, and like that he had shut himself off from the dam. ‘Now, we’re going to get up,’ he spoke aloud to himself, urging himself on. Draco clambered to his feet and flicked his ponytail behind him, rolling his shoulders back to stand with the pride he was well known to saunter.</p><p>The fireplace roared to life, Draco cast it a scathing glance as Hermione’s small frame clambered out and upwards. He had gone so long without being able to Floo that he had begun to find the transport to be pointlessly unclean and invasive.</p><p>Hermione bounced on the soles of her shoes, brushing down her skirt with a small hum.</p><p>‘Oh, Draco!’ she squeaked, robotically clamping her arms to her sides. Draco slouched into the wall, his mind telling him to be thankful that Hermione had finally moved on from pumping his hand every time she saw him. But he knew from the lines of the woman’s forehead that this wasn’t a casual run in. ‘I thought you would be at St Mungo’s, with Harry?’</p><p>‘Do let yourself in’ Draco retaliated, feeling just as tired as he had half an hour ago. He pushed past his new house guest, but Hermione’s fingers wound around his bicep, almost meeting. He stared blankly down at her. ‘And why, do tell me, have you latched onto me?’<br/>

Hermione rolled her eyes good naturedly. She was no longer scared by the dry blonde. His drunken apology five years ago had softened her to the man, it had also helped that he had fallen down the stairs afterwards and into Ron’s bewildered arms, the embarrassment cementing the trio. Prior to this Hermione had also helped Draco to secure a position within St Mungo’s, but she credited that to the man’s intellect and determination, and preferred to agree that the ice had broken when they clinked shot glasses over wry smiles.
<br/>
It had taken Ron the longest to come around to breathing the same air as Draco, but after pulling the bedraggled Slytherin from the Thames, he had slowly found time to truly speak with him and work towards a civil common ground. In fact, Ron had saved Draco on multiple occasions from sudden brutal retaliation acts. However clasping his shaking hands into a fist and slamming air into the man’s lungs had provided Ron with a glimpse of the burden Draco bore, and he would be damned if he was going to let Harry go on living without him.</p><p>‘Well, I’m technically here to water the house plants for Harry’ Hermione replied, her lie thick in the air. It was true that Draco was never one to keep the things alive without magical intervention, but Harry had already cast the spells the night before. ‘But maybe you’d like to have tea with me?’</p><p>‘I’ve already had one this morning’ he snipped back, silently cleaning the tea from the curtains with a nod of his head. The mug rolled onto the coffee table with a loud clatter. <em>And my appointment isn’t for another week, you pushy hag.</em></p><p>‘I was thinking we could go for a coffee then-‘</p><p>Draco tore his arm free, his head swimming. ‘Get off me’ he snarled, turning on her. Hermione shrunk back, her chin pointed defiantly. ‘You’re here to water the plants, not climb inside my arsehole’</p><p>‘Vulgar’</p><p>‘Can you not get the point I am trying to make?’ Draco rolled his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose. ‘Fucking Gryffindor’s. You’re here for a whole five seconds and you want to catch up, and I <em>do not </em>want to talk to <em>you</em>’.<br/>
Draco’s ugly pride clawed up his throat in jagged points. He knew he shouldn’t speak to Hermione like this, wouldn’t anymore, but he needed her to go. Draco needed to be alone.<br/>
Hermione huffed and stalked from the room, stomping upstairs to water the plants, and continue her charade, with a twirl of her cardigan.</p><p> Draco slammed his mouth shut against an apology.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Draco sat cross-legged in a guest room, his sleeves rolled up and elbows on knees. He stared intently at the blank wall before him remembering how Harry had once extended his hand to a bed bound Draco and lightly shook it, promising him that if he could stand on his own two feet, anyone could with the right help. Draco had found it almost ironic to be hospitalised upon the ward he worked, harpooned by his failing mental health and another sadistic attack.</p><p>‘And here we are again’ he breathed, outstretching his left arm and violently flicking his wand. He had promised himself that this would be the last time as a deep streak of crimson tore up the whites of his left arm. He hissed as an ebb of calm flowed through him. His Dark Mark had now long faded into light scarring that could only be seen in intense lighting, but that didn't erase the fact that he hadn’t previously spent years trying to scrub the black lines from his arm.<br/>
He flicked his hand upwards, nonchalant, and his skin tore from the crook of his elbow to half way down his inner arm. Close enough to scare him but far enough away that he wouldn’t bleed out. The bubble of bliss popped and Draco stared down at his arm in horror and frustration. <em>How could I? Harry?<br/>
</em>He kicked the wall accidentally as he jumped to his feet, wand clattering to the floorboards as his right hand clamped down on as much arm as possible.</p><p>‘Shit!’ he hissed, reality over-coming him. The wound was a clean cleave, deeper than intended. He was meant to have gone and bought food for the house, not ruin the floorboards of Harry’s home. He should be at work on the ward, not taking a forced holiday to take care of himself.</p><p> The blood ran quickly beneath his hand, trailing down the arm he held skyward, as he frantically attemptied to stem the flow. The wound was magically inflicted, a spell of Draco’s own design, one not easily remedied.</p><p>Draco tripped on his feet as he fled from the room, he steadied himself on the far wall of the hallway, a bloody handprint streaked behind him. He shoved himself off the wall and ran for the guest bathroom at the end of the hall.<br/>
His right hand was slick against the door handle. The panic was squeezing his lungs. If Harry didn’t kill him, Mrs Bradding surely would.<br/>
‘Alohomora!’ he shouted, stumbling into the tiled room as the door sprung open, wandlessly. Draco crashed into the bath mat, snatching a thick towel on his way down. He’d have to do this the muggle way; how fitting he had made his punishment all those years ago.</p><p>Draco bundled his arm into the towel and balanced it against the lip of the bath tub before him, resting his face into the towel. He was bone tired and his arm ached something chronic. The lull of sleep came suddenly, more inviting than the sadness that morning. He leant into the motion of falling and closed his eyes to the soft spiral of sleep. <em>This must be how my patients feel.</em><br/>
Draco sighed contently, his legs going limp beneath him. He could feel the last pull of sleep, like an anchor around his neck, and he plunged hard.</p>
