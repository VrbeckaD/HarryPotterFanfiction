    <p>"Potter! What in Merlin's name have you done!" Draco spat, gripping at his now ebony coloured hair. Across the room, sitting amongst empty vials and splatters of the potion they were brewing, sat a very pale, very blond, Harry Potter, still struggling to regain focus due to the ringing in his ears.</p><p>"What's got your wand in a twist, Malfoy? It was just an accident. Calm down, would you?"</p><p>"Calm down? Calm down?! Look at us, Potter!"</p><p>It was only then that Harry made eye contact with the source of the commotion. He blinked once; then again, followed by several more as a frown started to etch its way onto his features. In front of him stood... himself? Harry reached up to readjust his glasses; only to find them missing. The ringing in his ears were but a dull whisper now as he recalled the brief moments before the explosion that had occurred but moments ago.</p>

</center><p>"This is your bloody fault, you know."</p><p>"How exactly is this my fault, Malfoy?"</p><p>The two boys were standing across from each other in the potions classroom; both on edge since Slughorn had decided to pair them up for the term's project. Both of them had initially refused; but after they received an academic detention in which they had no other choice but to make the potion, they reluctantly showed up that Saturday morning, while everyone else went off to Hogsmeade.</p><p>Needless to say; the tension in the room continued to rise. Harry could not afford a demerit now; not when he was so close to becoming an auror. And Draco... After his involvement in the war, he was lucky to have escaped a sentence to Azkaban. Instead, he had to complete 720 hours of community service, and his eighth year at Hogwarts. He also couldn't afford a demerit now; lest the Ministry reconsidered his sentencing.</p><p>"You and that know-it-all Granger just had to make things difficult this year, didn't you? I can understand her coming back, but why you and that Weasel?"</p><p>"You think we wanted to come back after you helped Voldemort attempt to destroy this place?" Harry replied gruffly, throwing a bunch of fermented spider eggs into the potion. Draco winced ever so slightly at the mention of the dark wizard's name that had tormented him these past two years. Unaware of this, Harry continued.</p><p>"Do you know how many people died during the war trying to stop him; <i>trying to help you?</i>" he turned around and grabbed the jar labelled Blaze Powder, before throwing generous amounts into the cauldron. He glanced at the textbook that was splayed open on the table.</p><p>"I never asked for your help, or anyone else's! I was-"</p><p>"What? Fine? Were you? Or do you need a reminder of what happened during sixth year?"</p><p>Draco moved over toward the cauldron, adding in a few twigs of Aconite and gripping the edge of the table firmly. Guilt was a terrible thing to bear; and at that moment, it was rearing its ugly head.</p><p>"You have no idea what it's like to be on the other side, Potter," he grounded out, his gaze intensifying on the bubbling liquid in the pot. "You think it was a dark time hunting horcruxes? Well, let me tell you, it gets darker."</p><p>Draco looked Harry dead in the eye, his face contorted in anger.</p><p>"You have no idea what happens in the dark, Potter! You've never been so low, you've had to look up to see rock-bottom! They took my life from me; said that when I got stronger, I would get it back," he snarled. <i>"But I never got it back."</i></p><p>Harry was clutching the jar of bat spleen in his hand tightly; his brow furrowed and expression a mixture of pity and growing anger.</p><p>"I have had to work harder than anyone to get to where I was!"</p><p>"And where exactly was that?" Harry asked, emptying the jar; not looking in the book anymore. "It's always going to be about you, isn't it?"</p><p>"Me?" Draco exclaimed, adding a few more ingredients to the cauldron. "Says the one who's had his name in lights since birth! You barely even breathed without getting praise from Dumbledore; from anyone!"</p><p>"I never asked for that!" Harry said, slamming his fist onto the table. "You think I wanted my parents to die? Believe me, I would've traded all that just to have them here with me!" Harry was no longer paying much attention to the instructions; throwing in ingredients as he went about on his rant.</p><p>Draco's eyes widened slightly.</p><p>"Their death brought a great deal of things my way; but the things they never tell you in the newspapers and books is that the loneliness and anger came with it. I was alone! If it weren't for Hermione and Ron..." he paused, putting down a vial he had just emptied.</p><p>Draco was about to say something, his gaze fixed on the bubbling potion, when Harry beat him to the punch and started approaching him.</p><p>"I know life hasn't been easy for you, Malfoy. But that doesn't mean it's been easy for the rest of us."</p><p>"Potter-"</p><p>"You've always had something against me; Ron and Hermione, too. What have we ever done to you?" Harry asked, missing how Draco's gaze continued to flit from him to the cauldron.</p><p>"Look-"</p><p>"This year is a new start for all of us; to put the horrors of the past behind us. So why can't you-"</p><p>"WILL YOU SHUT IT? LOOK!"</p><p>Both heads turned towards the table, the cauldron rattling and liquid pouring off it's sides. Draco shoved Harry out of the way and grabbed the textbook on the desk; his eyes widening slightly as he read over the page. Harry then made his way to the cauldron; attempting to salvage their sorry excuse for a project.</p><p>"This is very bad. What in Merlin's name did you put in- Potter, stop!"</p><p>Before Harry could register what Draco had said; the cauldron in his arms stopped rattling and the bubbling came to a pause.</p><p>Then came the explosion.</p><p>The last thing Harry remembered before passing out, was the odd weightless feeling that had settled over his body.</p>

  <p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
</center><p>Harry now looked at the strange scene in front of him as a knot started to form in his stomach. Looking at himself restlessly paging though the potions textbook brought back the memory of his third year when he and Hermione had used the time turner. Only this time, they weren't in the past.</p><p>"This is insane! Potter, do you realise what you've done?!"</p><p>Harry swallowed the lump in his throught before he got to his feet and made his way over to the mirror by the storeroom. However, looking back at him wasn't his piercing green eyes, but rather the pale blue ones that he had come to associate with the enemy. He stood about a foot taller with a more slender build. This time, he couldn't blame the occurrence on his eyesight.</p><p>Harry stood, rooted to the ground as Draco went on muttering behind him. He mulled the situation over, trying to process what had just happened. What they had done should not have been possible. It was unheard of; at least to Harry it was. He then turned to face the now dark haired Draco in the room, scrunching his face as he tried to make out what was written in the book; his glasses somewhere on the ground.</p><p>"How the bloody hell- Merlin, are you blind?!" Malfoy spat, frustration seeping into his voice.</p><p>"You need to find my glasses."</p><p>At this, Draco stopped his antics and fixed Harry with a glare. "I would rather be blind."</p><p>A sigh escaped Harry's lips as he thought about possible solutions to their problem; coming up short once again. If only Hermione were here...</p><p>"I think we should inform Professor Slughorn."</p><p>"Have you lost you mind, Potter? Do you know what will happen if you tell him? I'll get shipped off the Azkaban for breaking the rules of my probation. After all, they won't blame you for this incident. Everyone points their finger at the Death Eater," Draco spat out.</p><p>"Well, we can't just sit here and do nothing." Harry paused for a brief moment. If word got out; he knew Draco would most probably be sent to Azkaban, even if this was an accident. It would also jeopardise his chances of having a career in the Ministry. Harry knew they required expert advice on this; and while he thought of it, only one name came up. "I could talk to Hermione?"</p><p>"You will do no such thing."</p><p>"Malfoy..." Harry ground out. "She is our only chance. If you insist on keeping this from the professors, then I insist that we go to her."</p><p>"And do what? Do you honestly think this will stay a private matter?"</p><p>Harry thought for a moment, considering the possibility of her informing McGonagall.</p><p>"I trust her, Malfoy. She won't tell anyone-"</p><p>"It's not Granger I'm referring to, Potter. It's the Weasel."</p><p>Memories came flooding back of their first few weeks at Hogwarts. Upon seeing Malfoy, Ron very nearly lost his control and pulled out his wand. Out of the three of them, Ron was struggling the most with the events of the war. Hermione had chalked it up to his experience with the locket and the loss of Fred; however, Ron desperately wanted someone to blame. And that someone just happened to be Draco. After what had happened to Hermione in Malfoy Manor and the Room of Requirement; he felt Draco's sentencing was watered down and he deserved to rot in Azkaban like his father. Ron had vowed that if Malfoy stepped out of line once this year or caused them the least bit of trouble, he would make sure he paid the full price this time around.</p><p>Harry shook his head at the memory. He knew Hermione would eventually tell Ron about the situation; considering their relationship status. Even if she didn't, he would find out that she was researching the case and discover that Harry was not so Harry anymore.</p><p>"Alright then. We won't tell her about us; but we'll need to tell her something. She's the only one who can help right now."</p><p>"Of course she is," he mouthed off, remaining silent for a while. "You realise you will have to act like me to avoid suspicion. You better not mess this up, Potter."</p><p>"I'm not the one who should be worried. You know next to nothing about me; and while Ron might not notice a slight change; Hermione most certainly will."</p><p>A scowl formed on Draco's face as he considered what Harry had just said. This was his idea after all; therefor he couldn't be angry at how the cards had fallen. But he was. If he went through with this; he would be forced to spend time with the boy who wanted him dead; and the girl who's death he was almost responsible for. Draco was tempted to back out of this plan, when the vision of his father in shackles appeared before him. <i>Azkaban</i>. Draco swallowed hard, feeling the walls close in around him and cringing as the throbbing of the dark mark that marred his pale skin intensified. He promised his mother he would be safe; that he would not waste this second chance. He owed her everything...</p><p>Draco shuffled over to the desk that they had used earlier and leaned against it, crossing his arms. A tired sigh escaped his lips as he shot Harry a weary look.</p><p>"What do I have to do?"</p>
