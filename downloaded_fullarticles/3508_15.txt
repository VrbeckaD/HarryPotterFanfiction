    <p>He had been in there for seven years.<br/>
Seven years of solitude.<br/>
Seven years of torture.<br/>
He was supposedly free.<br/>
But he wasn’t. He was going to be banned from magic.<br/>
His bank accounts frozen.<br/>
He was not going to be a free man; everyone who has been there knows that there is no such thing as freedom.<br/>
That was clear when he was put in there without a trial.<br/>
That was clear when they did not ask him what he had actually done.<br/>
They may be free, but no one else is, as their type of freedom relies on power.<br/>
Their Freedom relies on someone being imprisoned to kid the others into thinking that they are free.</p><p>“Oi Nott, stop fucking dawdling and hurry up, so I can get to the pub sooner” grunted auror Robertson who was escorting him from Azkaban into the ministry.<br/>
He climbed out of the hole he had been kept in, muscles weary as they had not been used in years. Their footsteps could not be heard over the delirious sounds of inmates . Their screams  and shouting reverberated of the walls. Robertson looked uncomfortable, but he didn’t notice- he had grown accustom to it.<br/>
The noise gradually faded away as they walked through corridors towards the exit. Each time a guard checked them and let them go through the magical barriers. The first security guard looked bored- like he had been there a long time; the last looked afraid of him, which he thought to himself was ridiculous as he was a pale, thin, bony man who had not been fed properly in the past seven years. He was not even a shadow of his former self. The guard must have been new to the job or he was just very out of touch, or both.<br/>
When they were at the fireplace, he realised what did he actually have to go back to?<br/>
His parents were dead.<br/>
His friends if not locked up would want nothing to do with him; They would have forgotten him anyway, seven years have passed, they will have their own lives- they will be unrecognizable to the teenagers he used to know.<br/>
He had no job, little money, a house that had been empty for seven years.<br/>
What did he have to go back to?</p><p>He was currently in a green tiled room filled with doors all insignificant compared to the fireplace he had just stepped out of; the one way in and out of Azkaban. Robertson opened the door pushing him inside.<br/>
“Theo, oh God.”<br/>
He turned around to the source of the noise. “Matt, what are you doing here?” he asked unsurely, he had not been forgotten after all.<br/>
“Come to take you home, of course.”<br/>
“You didn’t have to" he replied.<br/>
“’Course I did, I am your friend aren’t I? I’ve got some clothes here for you to change into.” Matt looked up at Robertson as he held out the clothes to Theo, Matt’s eyes were full of compassion- something of which Theo had rarely seen. Robertson nodded and led them into another room.<br/>
Theo slowly took of his rags. It felt like a significant moment, him discarding the past few years. Hands shaking as he did up his buttons, realising only how thin he was when he had to use Matt’s belt- he was still swimming in his clothes.</p><p>He remembered the sea. The sea that surrounded him.</p><p>“Theodore Nott, you have been released from Azkaban on the first of June, in the year two thousand and five. Witnesses, myself, Arthur Morray, auror Robertson, and Matthew Wade.” He was sat in front of a desk looking at the man speaking into a recording device. Matt sitting behind him and Robertson by the door. “Conditions of your release are the following; no magic to be used, no wand to be used, all previous bank accounts cannot be opened however a small sum will be sent each month, you will be subject to visits by aurors, your property can be searched without warrant, you can be detained without a warrant, you can be tracked at any time, you can be asked to leave land by aurors if you are causing a disturbance and have no reason for being there -This will go on your record. You now have a criminal record which will make it near impossible to be employed.” Arthur Morray continued like this for some time, Theo just stared at the pen lying on the desk. “Goodbye, Mr Nott. If you go out the door to the left you are free to go.” He said whilst going back to his paperwork.</p><p>The two friends embraced outside. Matt looked back at Theo and said “ I am so sorry mate,” Theo smiled back at him “I parked the car over there.”<br/>
“Thanks for coming to get me. I thought everyone would have forgotten me.”<br/>
“Well I didn’t, I tried so hard for them to give you a trial, but they were like animals waiting to rip apart prey. I think the ministry hate me now.”<br/>
Theo was shocked, he had had no idea,”thank you, there was no way they were going to budge.”<br/>
“Well you may not be thanking me in a minute. Oh, I forgot, I ate lunch before I came to the ministry but I have a sandwich for you in the bag behind you.”<br/>
Theo reached over and smiled, it was coronation chicken- Matt had remembered that he liked it.<br/>
“Well I’ll tell you everything that has happened. Right so as I said earlier, I tried to get you a trial but that lead nowhere. Then as you know they introduced new laws about money, so I took quite a bit out of your account-." Theo interrupted “How did you manage that?”<br/>
“I pretended to be your brother.” Theo grunted at this response.<br/>
“Well there is a slight catch. I put half of the money in a muggle bank account for you,” Matt responded slowly.<br/>
“What did you do with the rest of the money?”<br/>
“I used it as a start up loan to set up a company in printing and editing, we do both magic and muggle stuff- but the staff are muggles,” Matt said quickly.<br/>
“Oh, that's fine, it doesn’t need to be a loan. The way you said it made me think you’d spent it on drugs or something,” chuckled Theo.<br/>
“Well next week you can start your job, you can do the accounts as you are good at arithmacy, I’m crap so they have been neglected,” Matt sounded more sure now.<br/>
Theo nodded and said “Thanks, I look forward to being in your employment.”<br/>
“Well there is one other thing. There is this girl at work-“<br/>
Theo interrupted “oh?”<br/>
“no, no I don’t like Rosie- that’s the girl. I actually like Penny- don’t tell her I said that. Well anyway,  around six months ago Rosie’s family were killed in a car crash. She was left to look after her sister’s kids. But then on top or that she was kicked out of her home- she was living with her parents- because of something strange thing with her parents will. So she got kicked out without any money from the house and some of their possessions were also taken away. So a few months ago I said they could stay in your house. They are not paying rent until you come back, and Rosie will talk that through with you. I also said that we can always clear out somewhere else for them. I’m sorry I did all this without your permission.”<br/>
“It’s hardly like you could have asked me anyway. I don’t mind, it’s just poor them having to go in the house,” Theo exclaimed, Matt breathed out as they went round the roundabout, Theo then continued “there is just one thing. You know the house has got loads of weird pureblood, magical stuff and even house elf heads and they are muggles....”<br/>
“Oh, her sister’s husband was a wizard, so the kids probably are magic, so she knows about magic.”<br/>
“That explains a lot.”<br/>
Silence lulled over them. He was finally out of there. He was going home, he thought as they were on the motorway. The roads narrow as the sun moved slowly in the sky. They were winding through small road with cow parsley bursting out of the wayside and birds singing in the trees.<br/>
He was finally home.</p><p> </p><p>                            ~<br/>
Her alarm clock woke her up with its insistent buzzing, she turned it off and looked out of the window; it was a lovely day, the sun was rising, giving a golden glow to the fields and the birds were chirping loudly.  She got up hastily. The water in the shower reminded her of them. It made her remember that day. The kids running from the car in the rain hugging their grandparents as they walked in the door. She waved to her sister and her husband and said 'have fun', saying see you later to her parents as they went outside. She remembers opening the door to the policeman in the rain.</p><p>“Aunty, is the man coming later?” asked Ann as they sat down for breakfast. “Where has he been?” Tom asked. “prison.” The answer did not satisfy Tom. “ normal or wizarding?”<br/>
“wizarding prison.”<br/>
“oh, okay.” Tom fell silent.<br/>
Rosie looked at the children who were devouring the toast, “You are going to have to be on your best behaviour.”<br/>
The children gave a muffled response of “we will.” As they sat waiting to get down from the table.<br/>
“You can go and play in the garden, be nice to each other please. Matt said they should come around dinner time. So I’ll be cleaning.” The children nodded and ran off out of the door, shouting at each other.</p><p>She started cleaning downstairs. She wanted to make a good impression- to show that she was respectful, so she vacuumed in all the corners, fluffed up all of the cushions, and polished everything.<br/>
She paused as she was cleaning photographs, she recognized Matt first. He was younger in the photograph, had that youthful glint in his eye that only teenagers have when you still believe the world is yours  to conquer. He had his arm around a good looking boy next to him; he had sharp cheekbones,  dark hair flopping over his face, smiling in a way that entices you in to him. They seem to radiate happiness from the  photograph, as if in that moment they had no cares in the world, it was just them- two friends laughing in a garden on a hot summers day. The picture seemed significant, like the brightest star in the night sky. Just like a star in the night sky it seemed to hold a dear memory.<br/>
She was making his bed with great precision; tucking the edges of the sheet under tightly, fluffing up the pillows, making sure that the duvet was evenly spread out inside its cover. She put one of her old quilts on the bed, she thought he would want something homely and personal after all his time away.  She put a jug with two purple hydrangeas in on the drawers which seemed to make the room warmer. She folded clothes and pyjamas for him on the bed putting slippers on the floor. Next to it she put a pile of towels and a razor. She asked herself why she was doing all of this? She answered with to be kind and to make a good impression but deep down she knew that it was something else.<br/>
Later she was looking at the children in the garden, amazed by how they seemed fine, their grief gone. She thought why, why was their grief gone? She decided it was the house, it was the house that made the difference.<br/>
The house felt like home.</p>
