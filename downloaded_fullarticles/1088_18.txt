    <p>Harry heard a noise behind him in the forest, and turned slowly. “Professor Snape.”</p><p>The sneering man stepped out from behind a tree. “What are you doing out here, you imbecile? Trying to get yourself killed? For Merlin’s sake, we’re only a week into term!”</p><p>“No, sir,” Harry smiled, “I would say I’m safer out here than at Hogwarts. There are no spying Headmasters or backstabbing friends out here.”</p><p>“Just how much of an idiot are you, Potter? There are any number of Dark creatures out here.”</p><p>In response, Harry jumped behind a tree, immediately blending with the shadows. When he spoke he was pleased to see Snape turn in a circle, as if his voice was coming from every direction at once. “Oh I assure you Professor, I can more than handle anything that may come at me.”</p><p>Growling, a wand was pulled. “Show yourself, Potter!”</p><p>Harry stepped out of the shadow of a tree behind the man. “Here I am.”</p><p>Whirling, the professor found a wand at his throat. Stepping back, he gave the teenager a calculating look. “How did you do that?”</p><p>Without answering, Harry gave a small smirk and a wand twirl before stepping back into the shadows once again. When he reappeared, he was sitting on a branch just to Snape’s left. “Shadow travel." The Professor answered his own question. "How?”</p><p>Green eyes flashed before he leapt off the branch, transforming midair. When he landed, he was a cat about the size of a small horse. Bigger than any normal cat. Large claws kneaded the soil beneath paws the size of a man’s face. Eyes widening, the Potions Master whispered, “The Strange One.”</p><p>Harry stalked forward, tail twitching and green eyes wary. Snape slowly put his wand away, and held out a hand. “I can see why you wouldn’t want Albus knowing about this. He’d figure out a way to work it for the ‘greater good’.”</p><p>Eyes never leaving Snape’s face, the Nunda tentatively rubbed his nose against the outstretched hand, memorizing the scent of asphodel and vanilla. Snape moved his hand to rest on the boy’s head. “May I?”</p><p>Nudging the hand further down, the man took the hint and began to stroke the fur. Pale skin contrasted with grey and black fur as the professor stroked the cat’s neck, and took note of the many scars and wounds that adorned the large back. Soon, the Mngwa stepped back and turned into the boy-hero. Opening his mouth, but quickly closing it and frowning, “I noticed some scars on your back.... familiar looking scars. I’ve blindly believed whatever Dumbledore has told me about you. It was only too easy to hate you for your fame, for who your father is. None of it is true, is it?”</p><p>“Can we go back to the castle?” Harry shivered in the late-night chill.</p><p>Snape took in the ill-fitting clothes and nodded. “We’ll go to my quarters. They're warded by me personally.”</p><p>“I don’t have my cloak. How big are your pockets?”</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, the elder wizard whipped his teaching robe out of the way, and Harry frowned at the close fit of the frock coat. He turned into a form no bigger than a house cat, and trotted up to the scowling man's side. The two quickly made their way back to the castle to the dungeons, running into no one but Mrs. Norris since it was long past curfew, and Harry had no problems chasing her off.</p><p>Whispering his password, Harry’s feline hearing caught it anyway, and he rumbled a purring laugh at hearing, “Morsmordre.”</p><p>Raising an eyebrow at the cat he stepped in, closing the door after them. Turning back to normal, Harry gratefully accepted the offer of tea and a seat by the fireplace. Sitting across from each other in plush chairs it was quiet until Harry set his empty cup on the small table between their wingback chairs. Taking a deep breath he said, “I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.”</p><p>The professor raised an eyebrow over the rim of his teacup. “I assure you, Mr. Potter, that I have no desire to disrobe for you.”</p><p>The boy savior rolled his eyes. “You said my scars looked familiar. I’m guessing you didn’t have a childhood full of sunshine and rainbows either.”</p><p>Snape set his tea down before standing and sliding off his teaching robe, Banishing it to his wardrobe. He slowly unbuttoned his frock coat and the white shirt underneath. Noticing there was no pity in the fourteen year old’s eyes, he turned so his back was to the boy. Circling back, he saw understanding in the boy’s eyes. Snape knew all too well that he had JP and SB cut into his back their final year of school. Their bullying had reached unimaginable heights that year and the Marauders didn’t hold back.</p><p>Harry stood and pulled his own t-shirt over his head, letting it drop to the floor. Taking in the bruising, scars, healing cuts, and protruding ribs, black eyes widened when the boy turned. Carved into his upper back was the still-healing word ‘freak’. There were an assortment of horizontal bruises and welts that had scabbed over wounds at the end of them. Snape could count each vertebrae as his eyes took in the sad state of the teen’s back. “I’ve seen enough.”</p><p>They sat down at the same time while Harry slid on his t-shirt and Snape buttoned his own shirt. Taking a calming breath the professor spoke softly, “This year is the Triwizard Tournament. Based on your track record, you’ll probably be pulled in somehow. You need to heal and you could stand to gain a stone.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes narrowed, “Yes, because I have full access to potions and salves in order to do that. I’m not going to Madam Pomfrey either. She’s bound to report to the Headmaster if she suspects abuse and then I’ll have to suffer through a speech about how it’s for the greater fucking good.”</p><p>Ignoring the expletive, Snape nodded. “I guess I shall have to suffer through assisting you.”</p><p>“Am I really that horrible?”</p><p>“No,” he shook his head, “You’re competent at Potions, despite Mr. Malfoy trying to sabotage you. You know how to counteract whatever he throws in. You do not seek to exploit your fame. I’d go so far as to say you resent it. You’re nothing like your father, but I have my own part to play in this war.”</p><p>Harry leaned back against the chair as he laughed, before flinching and sitting forward again. “I should hope I’m nothing like James. He was a bully and an arrogant, good-for-nothing child. I have a request though…. Will you teach me about the Dark Arts, and maybe some defense? The lack of a half ways decent teacher in DADA is not conducive to learning. I’m trying to learn on my own, but there’s only so much I can try without a proper teacher. I don’t want a nasty spell to backfire and not have someone on-hand for the counter curse.”</p><p>“I believe it would be beneficial to see if you have the ability to become a Occlumens.”</p><p>Harry snorted. “Have you ever tried to get into my mind, sir?”</p><p>Raising his wand, he cast on his new ally, “Legilimens.”</p><p>Entering Harry’s mind, he was met with a swirl of memories, but none that held any meaning. Studying, sitting by the lake, talking with housemates. He heard a voice echo around him. “It’s worked so far. Dumbledore believes I’m still his little pawn, and that Ronald and the know-it-all are my best friends.”</p><p>“They aren’t?”</p><p>“Merlin, no!” Harry exclaimed. “The old man’s been paying them off. You wonder why my essays are so abysmal? I let Hermione correct them. I expect the Weasley girl will be after my arse any day now waving a marriage contract. My friends are Draco, and Neville.”</p><p>“Draco? Really?” Snape couldn’t hide his incredulity.</p><p>“Yes. He really wants to tell you, but I needed to make sure I knew who you were loyal to.”</p><p>“Have I passed your test, Potter?”</p><p>“Call me Harry.” Was the only answer he got.</p><p>Snape stepped closer to Harry, and held out his hand, hoping to start over. “I am Severus Snape, Potions Master and Head of Slytherin.”</p><p>Harry shook it firmly, “I’m Harry. Just Harry.”</p><p>“Pleasure to meet you, just Harry.”</p><p>The teen smiled up at the elder, “The pleasure is mine, sir.”</p><p>“Wait here, I’ll fetch some things to help you heal. Would you also like a nutrient potion?”</p><p>“Yes, please.”</p><p>Turning, and going into what Harry assumed was his private lab, he heard the clink of vials, and the Potions Master returned with a black leather messenger bag. It looked worn, but expensive, and there was a tiny hole where it looked like the corner of a book had worn through. “This was mine. I used it all seven years I attended here. There’s a hidden pocket inside with an undetectable Expansion Charm, which is where I kept my stash for when the Marauders decided to have some fun. If you would please take care of it, I would like it back when you graduate. It’s… special to me.”</p><p>Harry took the bag gently, turning it over and checking out the different pockets. The largest would easily fit all the books and parchment he’d ever need, and the rest were a nice size too. The undetectable pocket was in a zipper pocket that was inside the largest pocket on the back side, against his leg. Slipping it over his shoulder, he quickly bowed to Snape. “Thank you, sir. Now I must be getting back to the tower. When should I be back for lessons?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about that, I’ll take care of it during class tomorrow.”</p><p>With that, Harry sank into the shadows and was up to the portrait of the Fat Lady in seconds. He ignored her disapproving look and spoke the password. “Balderdash.”</p><p>She swung open with crossed arms, and he snuck up to the dorm with shadow travel, avoiding Ron and Hermione, who were waiting for him in the Common Room, staring at the opening portrait hole in between working on their homework. He sat on his bed, emptying out his own bag, and transferring all his books, parchment, and quills to the bag from Snape. Closing his bed curtains, he took his shirt off and opened the pocket with the potions and such.</p><p>Downing the nutrient potion as well as a Dittany potion that would speed up healing he frowned at the bruise salve. Standing, he cast a Sealing Charm, Silencing Charm, and a ward that would tell him if someone tried to break either of the charms on his curtains, and melting into the shadows he made his way back to the dungeons, not bothering to put his shirt back on. He knocked on Snape’s door lightly, staying in the shadows. When the door was opened, he stepped out and slipped past the man. “What do you need? Did I forget something?”</p><p>Harry held out the bruise salve as Snape closed the door. “I can’t reach.”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, the man took the salve and motioned for Harry to come inside. He stood in the living area and Snape pushed his hair out of the way.</p><p>Harry took a deep breath, but he couldn’t help but groan in pain as thin fingers rubbed the salve into his back. His hands tightened into fists, and he looked back, noticing the man was still dressed in his clothes from the day. “Still dressed?”</p><p>The man scoffed, “I was recently informed that the student occupying the spot Bane of my Existence isn't who I thought he was. Forgive me if I need some time to take that in.”</p><p>Harry chuckled, only to grit his teeth as a palm rubbed over a particularly tender spot on his shoulder. When he heard the lid being put back on the salve, he sat up. “Thank you, sir.”</p><p>“Good foods to help you gain weight are different dried fruits, whole milk, whole grains, and fattier cuts of meat. Now get back to bed, brat.”</p><p>He took the jar from the professor, nodded in thanks, and slid out of the chambers. He made his way back up to the tower, but paused when he heard Dumbledore talking to Hermione and Ron. “Are you sure he’s not in bed?”</p><p>He made his way closer with a scowl in place, being sure to stick to the shadows.</p><p>“Yes, we’re sure!” Came Ron’s annoyed reply, “I checked! He only puts a Sealing Charm on his curtains if he’s not there!”</p><p>Bypassing them and the Fat Lady and stepping away from the wall next to his bed. Cancelling the charm and quickly changing into a set of pajamas, he set his glasses on the nightstand. Harry gingerly got into bed and waved his wand to reset the charm, knowing Dumbledore would probably be up to check on him. Sure enough, not five minutes later the door creaked open and he heard Ron grunting while trying to open his curtains. Harry hid his face so as not to give anything away as Dumbledore broke the charm and parted his curtain.</p><p>“As you can see, my boy, Mr. Potter is just fine. Now get to bed, both of you.”</p><p>After they left, the exhausted teen fell asleep quickly.</p>
