    <p>The booming echo of the curses sounded through the area and was closely followed by an eerie silence. The quiet dragged on for what felt like ages before the screams of utter joy made their way through the near completely ruined grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The Dark Lord Voldemort was destroyed at the hands of the boy who lived, Harry Potter. Through tears of joy, loss, and pain, the crowds rejoiced. Total strangers held one and other while hordes of people flocked Harry. There were even some death eaters who looked relieved, a few of whom were forced to be pawns during Voldemorts cruel reign. </p><p>	Hermione Jean Granger was the first person to make it to Harry Potter's side. Quickly throwing her arms around his neck, she allowed her tears of relief flow down her cheeks. Harry reciprocated immediately and gently rocked her back and forth to calm her. He bent down to whisper something into her ear, whatever it was that he had said caused Hermione to release him quickly. Looking up into his eyes with slight determination, she nodded and wiped the tears away. Her hair whipped across her face as she turned towards the crowd, her honey-brown eyes scanning the area before locking on a group of three people with distinct platinum blonde hair. A smile graced her face as she studied the unmistakable group of whom she was surprised to find were locked in an embrace. Hermione still grinning made her way towards the trio who stood farthest away from the celebratory crowds. </p><p>--------</p><p>	Lucius Malfoy breathed a sigh of relief, against all the odds they had survived. With eyes the slightest bit moist he pulled his family into a very uncharacteristic embrace. Such displays of affection, in public no less, caused both Narcissa and Draco to stiffen before, albeit hesitantly, reciprocating. While Lucius and his wife Narcissa did defect, that fact did not change the man's views. He had to agree with his wife, though, Draco's future was far more critical than this ridiculous war. While he could never be handed a father of the year award, nobody could deny that Lucius Abraxas Malfoy loved his son very much, and it was well known that the feeling was mutual. What felt like hours were mere minutes before the family broke their embrace. Lucius watched as Draco leaned down and placed a quick peck onto his mother's forehead before turning to look towards the crowd in search of something. Whatever it was that had managed to catch his eye resulted in a slow smile spreading across his face. The Malfoy patriarchs eyebrow raised as he watched his son walk away from them without uttering a single word.</p><p>	Lucius observed as Draco made his way towards the crowd, a scene that he now knows will forever be etched into his memory, because what happened next could have never been predicted. A rustling of robes, a screech of blood traitor, a flash of green, and a resounding thump of something hitting the ground; all of which happened at such a speed that the Malfoy Patriarch could not even comprehend what he had just witnessed. It was the blood-curdling scream of Narcissa Malfoy that brought him back to reality, and with that came the realization of his worst fear, his son was hit by an unforgivable. This exact moment would be the coin that flipped Lucius Malfoys life upside down because nothing else mattered blood purity, status, money, nothing was worth this outcome. His son, Draco Lucius Malfoy, was dead. Lucius fell to his knees as he watched Narcissa run towards their boy. The pain in his chest could not be described, and it was a pain no parent should ever have to experience, the loss of their child.</p><p>	How could ten seconds truly change so much? This outcome was not fair. This was not what was meant to happen. Voldemort was defeated, his son had survived, Draco had survived. Only to be cut down by some rogue death eater. It wasn't until he felt the water droplets on his hands did he realize he was on his hands and knees with silent tears dripping from his eyes onto the moist ground. Another heartwrenching scream reverberated through the air causing his head to shoot up and watch as a person with unmistakable curly brown hair fell to her knees near his son's body.</p>
