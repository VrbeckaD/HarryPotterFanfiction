    <p>“Harry Potter, why can I hear a man singing in our shower?” Hermione stormed into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place.<br/> <br/> “Hmmm?” A muffled noise came from the open pantry.<br/> <br/> “I can hear a man singing in our shower!” she repeated while Harry appeared through the doorway, with a bag of flour and a mixing bowl.<br/> <br/> “Oh that’ll be Charlie.” Harry said, dumping the ingredients on the long wooden table between them.<br/> <br/> “Charlie? Charlie Weasley?”<br/> <br/> “Uh yeah.” She watched as Harry opened more cupboards, he crouched down to rustle around in one. “I told him he could stay here for a bit, you knew he was coming back for a while yeah?”<br/> <br/> “Yes I knew that but I didn’t realise our home was being offered to him. Don’t you think that’s something you might have discussed with me first?”<br/> <br/> “Where is that bloody...oh forget it, accio yeast.” Hermione glared at him as the yeast flew into his hand and he started laying everything out on the table. “Of course I’d have asked Hermione but its Charlie, he needs somewhere to stay, would you have wanted me to say no?”<br/> <br/> Hermione huffed, “Well no, of course not, but you’ve got to admit it’s a bit weird him being here after everything with Ron.”<br/> <br/> “Why?” Harry stopped weighing out the flour and looked up at her bemused. “Ginny’s here all the time and that’s fine. Honestly Hermione you worry about this Ron stuff way more than anyone else. No one blames you for ending it!”<br/> <br/> “Molly does.”<br/> <br/> “Okay, but it’s not like she’s cut you out of her life. She said her peace and that’s it...I really think you’re the only one still holding onto it.”<br/> <br/> “It still feels weird...and you should have told me.” Hermione said as she reached for the sieve and held it over the mixing bowl.<br/> <br/> “I know and I meant to but there wasn’t much time. Anyway, you like Charlie; I really didn’t think it would be an issue.”<br/> <br/> “And it’s not...it’s not. I guess I just wasn’t prepared.” Hermione hoped to stop the blush that threatened to rise up on her face determined not to let this get the better of her. Harry wasn’t to know of her silly crush, no one knew.<br/> <br/> She looked up as footsteps padded down the hall and the large figure of Charlie Weasley filled the doorway, he was wearing soft jogging bottoms and a tattered green t-shirt that stretched tight across his shoulders and arms. He was ruffling his hair, still slightly damp from the shower, when he grinned over at Hermione.<br/> <br/> “Alright there Hermione.” He walked over and to her surprise wrapped a large hand round her waist and planted a quick kiss on her cheek, the stubble he always sported tickling as he did. There was no fighting the blush now, his hand was warm and she felt it long after he’d pulled away.<br/> <br/> “Whatcha making here?” he asked moving over to Harry.<br/> <br/> “Bread” Harry beamed up at him, “I think I’m about to crack this rye loaf!”<br/> <br/> Hermione was suddenly very aware she hadn’t even said hello and must have been stood gawking at Charlie for the last 30 seconds. He stood with his back to her, chatting to Harry.<br/> <br/> It had been a nearly a year since she’d last seen him but he never changed. His body was all freckles and muscles and tattoos; his hair was still long and wavy, not quite enough to tie back but enough to run fingers through and the way it curled up on his neck just above the collar drove Hermione a little crazy. She looked at his broad shoulders and couldn’t help looking further down eying up the most glorious bum she had ever seen, she bit her lip and looked away before she was caught staring.<br/> <br/> Charlie chuckled, “Ah well good...quite the baker are you Harry?”<br/> <br/> “It’s therapeutic.” Hermione heard herself blurt out and Charlie’s blue eyes sparkled her way.<br/> <br/> “Is that right?” he smiled at her leaning back against the counter to give her his full attention.<br/> <br/> “Err, yes. Studies show that baking is comforting, especially bread. Something about the process, plus eating comfort food releases endorphins.”<br/> <br/> “Hmmm.” Charlie kept his gaze on her in a way that was starting to make her a little breathless. “Endorphins...I’ve always found a pretty good way to keep mine up!” he said with a wink.<br/> <br/> Harry laughed loudly hiding the fact that her mind stalled and she had no response to the thought of what Charlie Weasley did to get his endorphins up.  Gods Hermione get it together.<br/> <br/> “I’ve...err, if you’ll excuse me I’ll have to go check on Crookshanks.” Without waiting for a reply she walked purposefully out of the kitchen and headed towards the stairs of the old house. She stopped for a moment, resting her hand against the banister and took a long breath in.<br/> <br/> She’d had a crush on him since she was a teenager but seriously, who wouldn’t? He’d always been gorgeous; add to that a cool job and an unreasonable amount of charm and anyone could understand why Charlie held onto the heartbreaker reputation. Luckily he wasn’t around that often so it was easy enough to overlook. It wasn’t like she could talk to anyone about it, Ginny was out, obviously and that meant she couldn’t tell Harry either. Even before they were dating she’d have hardly said to Ron that his brother was so good looking he made her turn into a gibbering wreck.<br/> <br/> “Hermione!” she heard Charlie calling from down the hall the moment before he spotted her. No getting away now she thought and turned to face him.<br/> <br/> “Look, sorry about that. I was only joking but I know it was a bit crass.” He ran a large hand through his hair ruffling the curls. “Guess I’ve been spending too much time around dragon keepers, we aren’t the most civilised bunch.”<br/> <br/> Great now he thought she was a prude on top if not being able to string a sentence together.<br/> <br/> “Oh no, it’s fine! No, I wasn’t leaving because of that. I really do have to check on Crookshanks. I didn’t realise you were moving in and he can be funny around new people.”<br/> <br/> She watched as his blue eyes widened, “Oh shit...did Harry not tell you? I’m sorry Hermione I didn’t realise. I just assumed you knew. It is alright isn’t it? I just didn’t really fancy moving back in with Mum after all these years being on my own. I mean, I love her to bits but you know what she’s like. I really am grateful Harry offered up the room but if it’s not ok with you I can find...”<br/> <br/> “No” Hermione burst in, “No...really it’s fine.<br/> <br/> “You sure? Because you seem a little...I dunno cagey. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”<br/> <br/> “Honestly, it’s fine. I’m glad to have you here.” She reached over to reassure him and put her hand on his forearm. She immediately wished she hadn’t when she felt a hard wall of muscle that she wanted to grip onto forever. She pulled her hand back quickly only to see that cheeky grin of his that made her knees weak.<br/> <br/> “Well great. I’m glad to be here truth be told. It’s been a while since I’ve felt like being back home for any length of time. And the new section of the dragon reserve here sounds awesome. You’ve seen the plans right? Isn’t it your department?”<br/> <br/> “Er yeah, kind of. I work there but I haven’t really been involved in the dragon side of things.” Hermione admitted.<br/> <br/> “I’ll be back and forth to the reserve all the time, you should come along.” He’d moved a little closer to her, resting an arm on the banister.<br/> <br/> “Me? Why?” she really had to stop blurting stupid things out. Engage brain Hermione.<br/> <br/> Charlie didn’t seem to mind though, “I could use a second opinion. We’ll be living together and working under the same department, seems daft if we don’t put the two together. It would be nice to have someone to bounce ideas off. If you don’t mind that is?”<br/> <br/> “Of course not. That’d be good. I’ve been desperate to see it actually but I’m heading up the new Werewolf laws so it’s not really my area. Thanks Charlie.” His name sounded sinfully good on her lips and she wanted to say it again.<br/> <br/> “No probs.” He grinned at her again and brushed past heading up the stairs. “I’ll let you get back to seeing to your cat.”<br/> <br/> Hermione managed a weak smile as her eyes followed him up the stairs.<br/> <br/> She really needed to calm it down. She waited a minute before racing up the stairs and locking herself in her room, she could hear music rumbling next door and guessed Harry had put him in the empty bedroom next to hers. It wasn’t a problem really, the house was huge and it was just her and Harry rattling round in it, there was just the small matter of her infatuation with the man. Something about Charlie Weasley short-circuited her brain and it was becoming hard to ignore.<br/> <br/> Since breaking up with Ron, Hermione had gone through a bit of a sexual awakening; she realised she wanted passion, lots of passion and while she had no real interest in a relationship at the moment, sex was quite a different matter. She’d discovered that she rather liked it, the trouble was finding a man who didn’t treat her like a delicate little flower. They all seemed to think they had to act the perfect gentlemen around Hermione Granger, as if she was some prim golden girl. What she really wanted was crazy, passionate, rip your knickers off sex. Charlie Weasley was the epitome of all those things and it was enough to make her throw herself at his feet and beg for him to take her.<br/> <br/> However, the sexy Hermione just didn’t seem to come out around Charlie. He’d been home the previous Christmas and it was then she started to realise that the crush she’d previously had on him had progressed into full on lust. She was single and had battled through a couple of disappointing sexual encounters, one of which she’d actually had to stop the man in question and direct him to her clitoris.<br/> <br/> She’d taken one look at Charlie and realised that he wouldn’t need any direction at all. Most of the Christmas holiday had been taken up with thoughts of how his calloused fingers would feel between her legs. She was often caught staring at his hands. He’d always made her flustered but it seemed worse since that stay at The Burrow. And there was the slight problem of him being her ex’s brother, the same ex she was cautiously trying to build a friendship with again...and also she was sure that Charlie wouldn’t see her as anymore than that.<br/> <br/>  There was no way she could do anything about it, she told herself, even now she was a grown woman. Going after your ex’s brother was surely bad form...but there were a lot of them. Hermione sat on her bed, mindlessly curling her hair round a finger wondering if she actually could get away with doing something about it. No, it probably wouldn’t be right. Although it wasn’t like she wanted to actually date him, he just made her...she shivered, gods he made her want to do all manner of things she’d never had a urge to do with anyone else. He was so big, and he looked hard everywhere, his tattoos peeked out under his clothes and she wanted to see where they led to. She imagined his large hands round her naked waist, hoisting her up and pushing her against a wall...no, stop it Hermione. If you can’t do anything about it then stop thinking about him, she sighed and flopped back on the bed, plagued with images of a strong dragon keeper and what it would be like to have him lying next to her.<br/> <br/>  ~~~<br/>  <br/> The next day Hermione woke early, stupidly early, to avoid bumping into Charlie or having to fight over the bathroom. She’d made tea in her travel mug and apparated straight to work, she really did have a lot to get through anyway. There would be plenty of time to torture herself over the sight of Charlie Weasley.<br/> <br/> Last night’s dinner had been a struggle; just her, Harry and Charlie sat round the big table. It should have been nice, it was nice really. Harry hadn’t quite cracked his rye so instead whipped up a focaccia which they had with big bowls of pasta and glasses of red wine. Charlie sat and ate everything, including a second bowl of pasta, chatting good-naturedly to them the whole time. He seemed fascinated with Hermione’s work and wanted to know everything. She thought she managed to answer his questions quite well considering all she could actually think about was stripping off his t-shirt and lying him down on the big oak table while she climbed atop him and...well, her thoughts were not on werewolf rights.<br/> <br/> He had her in a spin, he was gorgeous and charming and funny and smart and he seemed genuinely interested in her job. She’d hoped maybe living with him would make her realise that he was actually awful, that he had some disgusting habit or he was a horrible bigot but no. She got to her desk and sighed, thinking of how she tried to relieve some of her frustration last night, imaging big hands trailing over her body and hot lips pleasing her all over as red wavy hair tickled her skin. She’d brought herself to orgasm twice last night, thinking of Charlie Weasley but this morning she felt as frustrated as ever.<br/> <br/> Taking a big gulp of tea she grabbed some files and started to work, determined to keep her thoughts off their new house guest at least for the rest of the morning.<br/> <br/>  ~~~<br/> <br/> Hours had passed before Hermione even looked up from her desk, the office had filled and people were busy. She sat up straight and stretched, realising that her hair had already started to escape from the bun she’d tied it in this morning. She stood up to refresh her tea and retie her hair when she spotted him across the office. There was a bit of a kerfuffle, rolls of parchment flew up in the air and she could hear the squeal of Judy, their office assistant. “Charles Weasley!” Hermione rolled her eyes, Judy treated dragon keepers like celebrities in their own right. She could hear her clearly from over the other side of the office as she gushed. “Oh I can’t believe it, you’re here in our office. Oh I’m such a huge fan, your work with dragons has been outstanding! Would you sign my Horntail?”<br/> <br/> Hermione sat back down, her quest for tea could wait. She didn’t want to get caught up in the fan club over there. She heard Charlie’s laugh and scowled down at the files, hating it a little that she felt jealousy flare through her. She tucked the escaped curls behind her ear and carried on working, blocking out the sounds of the office until a shadow fell over her desk.<br/> <br/> “Alright there treasure? I’ve been looking for you.” Charlie placed his hands down flat on her desk, leaning over to grin at her. She looked up at him, trying to keep her cool, determined not to act like another one of his fangirls.<br/> <br/> “Hi Charlie, I didn’t realise you were coming in today.” She looked back down and picked up her quill, pretending to annotate the work in front of her.<br/> <br/> “I’m here for you. I tried to catch you this morning but you must have been up with the lark. Wanted to see if you fancied coming to see the reserve today? I sent an owl to my boss last night, asking if I could bring you along.”<br/> <br/> Hermione looked up at him the quill forgotten, “Really?”<br/> <br/> “Yeah, said I would didn’t I? So whatcha think, fancy it?”<br/> <br/> “Now?” Hermione stood up, forgetting to be cool. She’d dreamed of getting in on this dragon reserve.<br/> <br/> Charlie nodded at her, “I’ve checked with your boss, Morris is it? Told him there is no one else I’d rather work with.” At this he unleashed a smile so charming Hermione felt the need to sit down again.<br/> <br/> Instead she let out an undignified squeal, not dissimilar to Judy and darted round the desk to hug the gorgeous wizard, propriety be damned. A laugh rumbled through him and his arms wrapped around her as if it was the most natural thing in the world. She felt the heat from his body and realised what she was doing. She quickly stepped out his arms, flushing crimson.<br/> <br/> “Ok, so err, how do we get there? Do I need to bring anything?” she looked down at the dull ministry robes, “I’ll have to get changed, we have clothes here for when we’re out in the field, if you don’t mind waiting.”<br/> <br/> “Nah, go ahead. I’ll wait here.” Charlie replied, sinking down on the chair opposite her desk and looking around at the office. Hermione left to get changed quickly, excitement coursing through her at the thought of visiting the dragon reserve.<br/> <br/> Hermione emerged after changing her clothes. She put on her usual muggle jeans, a chunky knit green jumper and big black combat boots. She’d got her hair back under control again and walked back out to find Charlie. He wasn’t alone. As she got closer she saw Judy perched on her desk right in front of him, robes open so he had a view of her tight white blouse and short skirt. He was looking up at her smiling in his usual cheerful way and Hermione gritted her teeth. Why did he have to be so nice to everyone?<br/> <br/> As she got closer she could hear Judy telling Charlie about a new restaurant that had opened in Diagon Alley. She walked over quickly determined to put a stop to that conversation. Charlie’s attention shifted to her as she stood by the desk, trying not to glare at Judy.<br/> <br/> “Sorry Judy.” Charlie stood quickly. “Have to be off, this wonderful witch is going to teach me a thing or two about dragons. See you another time.”<br/> <br/> Hermione tried not to look too smug as Charlie turned away from Judy to walk her out of the office.<br/> <br/> They headed towards the apparition point and Hermione couldn’t stop herself from asking, “Does that always happen? You walk into a room and straight away a girl is asking you out?”<br/> <br/> “I wouldn’t say always.” He smiled easily as he replied.<br/> <br/> “But often enough?” Hermione pushed.<br/> <br/> He shrugged in reply, still smiling, and reached for her hand. She was startled to feel the rough calluses wrap around her own hand but realised they had reached the apparition point and before she could say anything more they’d disappeared with a loud crack.<br/> <br/> “It’s about a two mile walk.” Charlie said as soon as they’d arrived. “We didn’t want apparitions happening too close to the reserve, it would mess with the wards.”<br/> <br/> Hermione started to follow him as he trekked up along a path over rocky ground. She looked around and saw they were already pretty high up, the valleys of Wales flowing out all around them. It was so quiet that for a moment neither of them said anything, Hermione just enjoyed the peace and the rhythm of their boots scuffing on the path as they walked side by side.<br/> <br/> “I’m sure you don’t exactly have a shortage of interest when it comes to wizards.” He spoke up suddenly.<br/> <br/> “What?” Hermione said, looking at him in confusion.<br/> <br/> “You said I have witches all over me, you must be the same?” Charlie continued, catching her eye. “Hermione Granger, war hero, clever, funny and beautiful to boot. I bet the guys are lining up to date you.”<br/> <br/> Hermione wanted to ask if he really thought she was all those things but instead she said, “Hmmm, you’d be surprised.”<br/> <br/> “Would I?”<br/> <br/> “I’m not exactly beating them off with a stick” she said, thinking she’d be happy with just one guy being all over her right now.<br/> <br/> “You’re not seeing anyone then?” he threw out at her, much to her surprise.<br/> <br/> “No, no I’m not.” She waited a minute but couldn’t stop herself from saying, “How about you?”<br/> <br/> “No love, I’m not seeing anyone.” He grinned at her but didn’t say anymore, neither did she but her heart rate ratcheted up a notch.</p><p><br/> They were climbing higher and Hermione could feel the thrum of magic as they got closer to the edge of the reserve. To the naked eye there was nothing ahead but more hills but she could sense the wards. Charlie must have caught her looking, “We’re pretty close now. The wards should let us both through, since they’re expecting you.  <br/> <br/> It felt as though the magic was shimmering around them as Charlie again reached for her hand to pass over the wards and into the reserve.<br/> <br/> She looked around almost as if a dragon would leap onto them any moment but all she could see were a few log cabins dotted around and an endless rugged landscape that stretched off beyond.<br/> <br/> “This bit is shielded from the Dragons,” Charlie explained, “we can see them but they can’t see or reach us. We have a few bunks here and research cabins. There are a few of these sites dotted all over the reserve but this is one of the new ones.”<br/> <br/> Hermione nodded but her eyes were wide as she’d seen a shape flying off in the distance. A thrill went through her at the sight even if it wasn’t the first time she’d seen a dragon up close. She’d ridden on the back of the Gringott’s one for Godric’s sake but still, the sight of them was spectacular. Especially out here where they were looked after and allowed to roam in safety.<br/> <br/> “Just one of our little Welsh Green’s over there.” Charlie spoke up next to her. “We’re on one of the newer parts of the reserve so you probably won’t get too many up close, they’re bringing in a few of my Longhorns soon though. This is going to be my division to run while I’m here.”<br/> <br/> Hermione watched amazed as the dragon looped in the distance, it looked to be having the time of its life.<br/> <br/> “Is anybody else here?” Hermione asked. It seemed so quiet, like a forgotten land.<br/> <br/> “Not yet. I’ll be checking out the former employees this week and hopefully hiring a few new ones. They’ve done a great job here but they aren’t as used to the different breeds as we are in Romania. A few of the guys are coming over with the dragons to help me get it up and running, we’ll just be here support them while they get the new dragons settled.”<br/> <br/> “So what are you doing here today, can I help?” Hermione looked towards him.<br/> <br/> “Actually, it’s my day to catch up on paperwork.” He looked a little sheepishly at her, “I just thought you seemed so keen to see it that I’d bring you up here, I hate being stuck indoors all day.”<br/> <br/> “I can see why you’d choose this over being stuck behind a desk. It’s amazing.” She went back to watching the dragon; spiralling downwards looking like it was going to land. “Thanks Charlie.”<br/> <br/> “Anytime.” Charlie replied. “Actually, I’d asked your boss if you could be freed up to visit again in a couple of days, hope that’s alright. I’m meeting some of the other workers and they could do with some ideas for equipment in the research cabins. They’ve never been set up with that kind of thing before and I know you have some pretty amazing labs over at the ministry. We could use your professional opinion.”<br/> <br/> “I’d love to.” Hermione was thrilled to be asked to help, she’d felt a little looked over when it came to the new dragon reserve plans, she’d gone out of her way and asked to be part of it but they kept her working on the werewolves laws. “Although you know there are others in the office far more experienced with dragons than me.”<br/> <br/> “Yeah, but I like you. No offense but some of those ministry workers are pompous twats, think they know everything about dragons without even setting foot on a reserve.”<br/> <br/> Hermione grinned at that, “Unfortunately I’ve come across a few of them.”<br/> <br/> They stayed on the reserve for another hour while Charlie showed her round; she was gradually finding it easier to talk to him although it still made her heart beat wildly whenever he came into her personal space. He’d apparated them back to the ministry before saying good bye with another kiss on her cheek and she went back to work in a bit of a daze, her mind flitting between dragons and Charlie.</p>
