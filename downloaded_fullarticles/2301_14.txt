    <p>The familiar warmth of Newt's case was a welcome feeling after spending all day in the harsh winter cold, the cold that made her breath fog up in diminutive puffs and fingers go stiff and turn a deep crimson shade. Tina sighed contently, rejoicing in the warmth that thawed her frozen fingers. She surveyed the area, looking for her husband, and when her eyes laid on him a bright smile appeared across her face. He was near the new nundu babies; a sheen of sweat worked itself on his forehead as he tended to one of the more difficult ones. The majority were well behaved, but there was one nundu that seemed to have quite a distaste for him. Newt turned around when he heard Tina's footsteps and gave her a timid smile. </p><p>       "How was work, dear?" He asked her, setting down the baby nundu in order to turn his body toward her and give her a light peck. He took note of how exhausted she looked. Newt knew, however, that she was simply worn out from the day's events; he had no doubt she'd had a work-filled day. </p><p>       Tina sighed, shrugging off her coat and leaving it to hang on a nearby tree branch. "Tiring. There was a crackdown on Grindelwald's case yesterday... we think we might have a lead somewhere. How about you? Did the new baby nundu give you any trouble?"</p><p>       Newt simply shook his head, embracing Tina when she was closer to him. Tina sank into the hug, finally relaxing after her tiring day at the congress. "I missed you," she mumbled into his shoulder, a true statement. It's been such a long day at work, causing her to come home much later than usual, and she would be lying if she didn't say she'd missed Newt tremendously. </p><p>       Newt chuckled at her proclamation. "I missed you too, love," he said, his hand stroking her hair absentmindedly. Tina stared at the baby nundus, thinking to herself. Suddenly an image crossed her mind: an image of her holding a small child, with her hair and Newt's eyes. It was an unexpected thought, though she didn't find it intrusive. The thought merely caught her off guard, and she felt a longing she hadn't felt before. </p><p>       It was Tina who broke away once the nundu started screeching again. She crossed her arms and suggested, "I think... that we should name them. The nundus, I mean."</p><p>       "I think that's a lovely idea. Let's see, there's five... and three are female, so I guess I'll let you name the three."</p><p>       Tina observed the occamies intently. "How can you tell if they're female or not? I don't notice any difference," she asked, her face screwed up in confusion as she placed her hand on the side of the enclosure. From below, a nundu bit into the air, trying to reach her hand. </p><p>       "Well, the females are more aggressive, it's a natural instinct to protect their young. Like that one, the one that just tried to bite you, that one is a female. It's also evident by their prickers- females have more silver highlights than their male counterparts. It's all about the natural behaviour of them. It's not quite a large difference, but if you know what to spot it's rather easy to tell," Newt explained excitedly. Tina smiled to herself. Whenever Newt was talking about his creatures, she found herself happier than before. Seeing him happy made her happy. It's how she realized she loved him. </p><p> She rested her head on Newt's shoulder, and he took ahold of her hand. "You must've missed me very much," Newt said with a smile. </p><p> "Of course, but... I've also been thinking," Tina said, plucking up courage. "How would you feel, or how do you feel, about having children? Not now, but someday, of course. It's just... seeing you with the nundus got me thinking about it."</p><p>A brilliant smile spread across Newt's face. "Tina," he said, pure shock evident in his facial expression. "I've been wanting to ask you that for the last three years." </p><p> </p><p>+</p><p> </p><p>       Tina didn't feel at all disappointed when her monthly came for the first time. They'd only been trying for two weeks- surely that wasn't enough time. Her and Newt had only just began, there was plenty of time between this month and the next for her to get pregnant. </p><p>       Only the next month she wasn't either. Again, she knew it'd only been a month and a half of trying, and the idea was still fresh and exciting in her mind. But she couldn't help but begin to feel a bit disappointed. Newt consoled her, however, once she expressed these doubts. "It's only been seven weeks, love. Babies take more time than that. I've seen my creatures take years and years to conceive, and while I doubt that's the case with you, I know for some mothers, things take a tad longer. Next month," he told her, showering her with loving kisses afterward. His words lifted her spirits, but she felt troubled that he'd stated that for some creatures it had taken a profusion of years. Don't be silly, she told herself, you're not a creature. </p><p> Another month passed. Then another. Then two more, then it'd been nearly a year of trying and still nothing appeared to be happening. At this point, Tina had grown quite pessimistic about the concept of trying for and having a baby. She was starting to feel like one of the creatures he'd talked about, trying and trying but to no prevail getting what she- what they- had wanted. It was no secret Newt was absolutely dying to have children. He wanted them so badly, but even if Tina didn't know it, he wouldn't mind if they didn't have children. He had Tina, and she was enough to make him feel content.</p><p> They sat at dinner one night, both exhausted from the day's work. Newt was finishing up the fourth draft of his manuscript, and Tina had more paperwork than she had fingers. That, and the fact that she'd begun menstruation at work. She had to tell Newt and see the undeniable disappointment in his face. Tina was close to tears at that thought. She wanted this baby as much as Newt did, perhaps even more. She'd never pictured herself as a mother, even as a child, but now... now she knew that it was her greatest desire in the world. Newt cleared his throat and spoke up. "How was your day, dear?" He was cautious with his words. He could sense Tina wasn't in the greatest mood, and he knew it was more than work. </p><p> "Fine, I guess," Tina replied, staring down at her spaghetti. "Just... paperwork."</p><p> Newt frowned. "It's got to be more than that."</p><p> "I said I was fine." Tina said through clenched teeth. At Newt's look, she faltered. "I'm sorry, it's just that I..." Her eyes began to water. "I started my monthly." It was as if flood gates had open. Tears streamed down her face, and she put a hand on her head to stop it. Newt got up immediately and rushed to her side. </p><p> "No, Tina, it's okay, I understand," he said softly, crouching beside Tina's chair and grabbing her hand. "You're perfectly fine, love."</p><p> Tina looked at him through red rimmed eyes. "But I'm not. I can't even... I can't even conceive a baby for you." Another wave of tears hit her, and Tina hid her face once again. Newt gave his wife a sad look, stood up, and held her against his chest. He wasn't sad for himself, no. He was sad because his wife was. And he couldn't help but feel partly to blame.</p><p> "You don't owe me anything, Tina," Newt said,  rocking Tina and kissing her forehead. "Always remember that. I just want you. You're all I need. You're all I want." </p><p> Tina stood up and embraced Newt properly. "But what if I'm not enough?"</p>
