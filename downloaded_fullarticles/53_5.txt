</p><p>Alastor Moody, a retired Auror, was at his home watching a baby crawling on the living room floor. The baby was none other than the son of James and Lily Potter, Harry James Potter. He was very devastated by the death of Lily and James Potter. James told him if Sirius didn’t show up in an hour after they died, he asked him to take and raise Harry. He asked him because he heard Dumbledore say that if he and Lily died, he would take Harry to the Dursleys, which was against their will.  </p><p> </p><p>Lily was glad that there was a back-up plan but was a little worried that Alastor was the back-up. She didn’t have anything against him, in fact, she thought highly of him but the problem was that he took cursing someone from behind very seriously. She did agree that cursing someone from behind did make you a coward but, he took it a little too seriously. Also, he didn’t know the difference between a handshake and an attempted murder. Luckily, after a while of James convincing Lily that this was going to work out, Lily agreed.</p><p> </p><p>Before Harry turned eleven and went to Hogwarts Alastor’s plans for Harry was to train Harry physically and tell him that there are a lot of witches and wizards who thought that they didn’t need to be physically fit, tell Harry about the corruption in the ministry when he turns five years old, tell Harry the death eaters that got out of charges for ‘regretting’ what they did, saying names of other death eaters, and claiming that they were put under the Imperius Curse when he turns six, teach him about constant vigilance when he’s eight. When he turns nine, teach him advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts and advanced Potion brewing and when he turns ten, he planned to teach him occlumency. </p><p> </p><p>For a while, that wouldn’t be happening. He was only one. His first set of training wouldn’t start until he turned four.</p>
