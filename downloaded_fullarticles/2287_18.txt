    <p align="center">Family is not a home but friends.</p>
<p align="center">Chapter one: You are not my family.</p>
<p>              Sirius Black woke to his mother pounding on the door. It was a few weeks into summer, Sirius along with his friends just finished their fifth year at Hogwarts. “What?!” he asked in an annoyed voice. Sirius was not a morning person, he never has been one.</p>
<p>“Get up now you little traitor. I need to talk to you!” Sirius rolled his eyes. He wished that he was with James, Remus, Peter, anyone other than here with his family and the hell that he lived in. Sirius let out a sigh and got out of bed. Sirius then opened the door to see his mother looking at him with her usual stern look and anger and a disapproving look in her cold dark eyes.</p>
<p>“What?!” Sirius said in an annoyed and tired voice. However, Sirius did not meet her eyes.</p>
<p>“Your brother says that you pushed him on the train back from your precious school!” Sirius did not answer. He knows that Reg was making this up. Classic little brother. Sirius let out a sigh and made his way back to his room only to be stopped by his mother’s death grip on his arm. “Answer me you little……...” Sirius never let her finish for he rolled his eyes and muttered:</p>
<p>“Mother is an idiot,” he knows that he should not have said this, but he wanted to anyway. Sirius’s mother stared at him for a long time before she said as she tightens her grip on Sirius’s arm:</p>
<p>“What did you say?” her voice was dead calm, but Sirius heard it slipping with anger.</p>
<p>“I said that mother is an idiot,” Sirius’s voice was strong, but it was dripping with anger as well. Sirius did not care what his mother did to him at this point, however. Sirius’s mother then dragged her oldest son down the stairs and pushed him against the wall. She pushed him so hard that Sirius felt his ribs brake and he blacked out.</p>
<p>      When Sirius came to, he noticed that everything hurt. He knew that his mother cursed him again however he did not expect her to really hit him. <em> ‘Maybe father did it.’ </em> Sirius thought as he tried to stand. This is when he realized that he was not on his bed but on the floor were his unwanted dark magic books sat. Sirius sighed as he slowly got to his feet as pain went through his body. Sirius then made his way to the door and turned the nob to find it locked. Sirius cursed himself as he went back to his bed. He then closed his eyes however they opened when he heard:</p>
<p>“Sirius Orion Black. You are going to stay in there until your mother and I decide on what we are going to do with you!”</p>
<p>“Go to hell!” Sirius called back through the door. However, when Sirius made his way to punch the door, he realized that he was bleeding. Sirius looked down on the floor to see blood on the floor and dripping through his shirt. Sirius let out a noise as he made his way to the window. <em> ‘That’s it.’</em> Sirius thought as he made his way to the closet after he opened the window. Sirius opened his closet and pulled out his school trunk and then he started to pack all of his clothes and everything that he owns or can carry. Sirius closed his trunk and pulled it to his nightstand and picked up his wand. Sirius knows that he was not allowed to use magic outside of school be he knew that he needed to get out of this house and the only way was not to pull along a heavy trunk, so he shrunk it and put it in his pocket. He did the same thing with his wand. Sirius looked around him to see if he had missed anything and then walked over to the window. Sirius sighed knowing that he will be walking for a while however he knew that he had to get out. Sirius sighed again and then started to climb out and then down the side of the house. “They can go to hell,” Sirius said with a laugh as he turned into a dog and trotted, well more like limped down the road.</p>
<p>       Sirius did not know how long he was limping down the road nor did he know where he was. The young Black then limped into an alleyway and turned back. It took a while to do this however because he has lost a lot of blood and because of his broken ribs.  When Sirius did manage to turn back, he sat on the ground for a while holding his side in pain as he closed his eyes. “Are you ok young man?” Said a voice that made Sirius open his eyes with fear displayed in his warm gray eyes. Sirius has never been called this before. Sirius looked up at the woman who was sitting at his level with worry and kindness displayed in her green eyes. Sirius, however, did not answer as he looked at his bloody hand. She followed his eyes and looked at him with more worry in her eyes. However, despite the worried look, she kept calm as she asked: “Can you tell me your name?” when Sirius did not answer she asked: “Can you speak or are you in pain?” Sirius looked up at her sharply for no adult asked him this. Sirius let out a shaky sigh and said:</p>
<p>“S-Sirius. My name is Sirius Orion Black,” Sirius did not say anything else as his throat closed and he closed his eyes in pain once again. The woman took this as a sign to get him to the hospital. She then got to her feet and gently picked up the boy and carried him back to her car.</p>
<p>              By the time she put Sirius in the front seat Sirius had opened his eyes for he had passed out when that woman picked him up. The young Black looked around the car with fascination. The young heir has never been in a muggle car before, let alone seen one. The woman looked at Sirius as she started the car. She was still worried but also intrigued by him as she watched him look around the car with fascination in his eyes. She wonders if he has never seen a car before as she drove away.</p>
<p>              Sirius had passed out in the middle of the car ride to the hospital. However, he had woken up for a few minutes to see where he was. However, Sirius could not see very well because of the loss of blood and the tiredness that he felt. However, the song playing on the radio made him smile. Sirius focused his site and looked at the name of the song.  The song was titled: ‘Carry on my Wayward Son.’ Sirius listened to it for a few minutes before he passed out again.</p>
<p>The woman rushed Sirius into the hospital calling: “Help, please, someone help!” this is when doctors came out to help the sixteen-year-old.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Someone asked</p>
<p>“And what's his name?” another added.</p>
<p>“And what’s your name?” someone else asked her.  The woman nodded and said:</p>
<p>“My name is Lucy. I do not know what happened and his name is Sirius Black,” the doctors nodded as they took him and rushed him into the back, leaving Lucy alone in the lobby. She is unsure why she felt a motherly feeling for this boy, this is why she stood in the lobby waiting to hear the news about him.</p>
<p>              James Potter looked out his window as he waited for a letter to come back from his friend, however, he did not get one.  This made James nervous for Sirius. He knows that he can’t write to Remus because Remus just went through another full moon because Remus is a werewolf. James got more worried when he got the letter that he sent over to Sirius back. “Something’s not right,” James said to himself as he looked at his door when he heard a knock. With a shaky voice, James said: “Yes?” The door opened. In the doorway stood James’s father looking at him with a small smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Hello, James. Can we talk?” James nodded still worried about Sirius. He pushed that aside as he sat on his bed with his father doing the same.  James’s father took a breath and said: “James do you know anything about the Black’s?” James nodded when he knew what this was about.</p>
<p>“Yes father,” James said as he looked away from his father’s gaze for a minute to look out the window.</p>
<p>“Well, it turns out that the oldest son went missing this morning,” James looked back to meet his father’s eyes. “Do you know why son? I know that you are friends with the Black heir. Do you know what happened?” James sighed and said:</p>
<p>“Sirius, his name is Sirius and I don’t know what happened. I tried to write to him, but I did not get a letter back. However, I think Sirius ran away,” Mr. Potter looked at him. Off of his look, James said: “He does not have a good bond with his family. I think his mother hits him. He told me this in one of his letters,” James’s voice was firm. He then looks at the window and then looks back to his father. Mr. Potter nodded and said:</p>
<p>“So, he ran away because his mother hurt him?”  James nodded and looked to the floor thinking before he said:</p>
<p>“We need to find him before his mother does,” Mr. Potter nodded as he stood up. James did the same thing as they both walked out of the room.</p>
