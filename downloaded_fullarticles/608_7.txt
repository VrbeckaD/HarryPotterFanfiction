    <p align="justify">Hermione Granger was really, truly thrilled to learn, at the age of eleven-and-three-quarters, that she was a witch.</p><p align="justify">It certainly helped to explain a great many odd things that had happened to her as a child. There was the time when Amelia Turner pushed her in the playground and made her skin both of her knees something awful, only to have all her scrapes and bruises disappear by the time she reached the school nurse; or that incident in year four when Eddie Scott stole her favourite blue pencil, and suddenly every pencil he picked up only produced an ugly shade of snot-green for the rest of the day.</p><p align="justify">Hence, when a tall, stern-looking woman knocked on the door of the Granger household on a chilly Saturday in the middle of July and introduced herself as Professor McGonagall from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry – a school that Hermione would be allowed to attend, since she was a witch – Hermione was so excited she could barely contain herself. In her opinion, she did a remarkable job of holding her tongue until Professor McGonagall asked: “Now, do you have any questions?”</p><p align="justify">Before her mum or dad could so much as open their mouths, Hermione began asking questions at a breakneck pace. How come she was a witch even though nobody else in her family her could do magic? What subjects did Hogwarts teach? How did the wizarding world hide from muggles and why? Most importantly, when does school start?</p><p align="justify">Professor McGonagall, to her credit, did her best to answer as many of Hermione’s questions as she could, detailing the Hogwarts curriculum, the four Houses, the exam system, and her knowledge of the wizarding world in general. She indulged Hermione’s endless curiosity with a fondness Hermione had only previously experienced from her parents and her favourite primary school teacher, Mrs Collins.</p><p align="justify">When the time came for the two witches to leave to get Hermione’s school things, Hermione couldn’t help but ask how they were going to get from her sleepy little town in Cheshire all the way to London before the shops closed. It was already one in the afternoon, and it took at least 3 hours by train to get to London. In response, Professor McGonagall gave a brief but impressively detailed explanation of the basics of Apparition before warning her that much like muggle driving, Apparition required training and an age-restricted licence. Attempting it before she was of age, Professor McGonagall warned her, would almost certainly result in the gruesome side-effect known as ‘splinching’.</p><p align="justify">Side-Along Apparition, on the other hand, was perfectly safe for children, and not a minute later Hermione found herself and Professor McGonagall stood in a quiet corner of a small, dark pub – or rather, Professor McGonagall stood as Hermione crouched on the cold stone floor with her head between her knees as she willed herself not to vomit in front of her new role model. While Side-Along Apparition may be safe, it certainly didn’t resemble anything close to pleasant.</p><p align="justify">“I must say, Miss Granger, I’m rather impressed with your constitution,” Professor McGonagall remarked, half-heartedly examining a poster on the wall. “It’s quite common for people to vomit after their first Side-Along Apparition, especially children.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione almost protested that she was eleven-and-three-quarters, and therefore <em>not a child, thank you very much</em>, before deciding that protesting would just make her seem all the more childish. She settled for a simple, “Thank you,” as her stomach settled enough for her to get to her feet. She was still a little wobbly, however, and managed to nearly topple over almost immediately.</p><p align="justify">As she fell, a warm hand reached out to grab her arm, steadying her in place. “Careful, love!” Hermione looked up to see who had saved her from a rather embarrassing fall and was met with a short, red-headed, friendly-looking woman, accompanied by four equally red-headed teenaged boys.</p><p align="justify">Hermione opened her mouth, apologies on the tip of her tongue, but she was interrupted by the red-headed woman speaking again. “Are you alright, dear? You look as though you’ve seen a Boggart!”</p><p align="justify">“I-I’m fine, thank you,” Hermione replied, still a little shaken.</p><p align="justify">“First Side-Along,” Professor McGonagall interjected, directing a wry smile downwards at the other woman. It was almost comical how much the Professor towered over the redhead.</p><p align="justify">“Ah, of course! Nasty thing, Apparition. Never had the knack for it myself, always preferred the Floo. This must be one of the new muggleborns, Professor?” the other woman asked, in that way that people ask things to which they already know the answers. She looked at Hermione as though expecting her to jump in and introduce herself.</p><p align="justify">Hermione’s brain, however, was still stuck on an unfamiliar word from a few minutes before, and all she could think to say was: “What’s a Boggart?”</p><p align="justify">The woman looked perplexed at the unexpected question, but seemed to gather herself after a few seconds of waiting and realising that she was not going to get an introduction before answering the question. “I’m sure you’ll learn soon enough, my dear, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher is supposed to be an expert on Dark creatures! My Ron is starting his first year too, I suppose you two will probably end up in the same class.” She gestured at the shortest of the four boys. He very much resembled his mother, round-faced and freckle-covered, but was lankier in build, and his eyes were sharp and blue instead of his mother’s kind brown ones. He smiled awkwardly at Hermione, clearly unused to being the centre of attention.</p><p align="justify">Two of the taller boys, clearly twins and probably Ron’s brothers judging by the resemblance, snickered at his awkwardness – and probably at Hermione, too. She determinedly ignored them both, accustomed to being the object of ridicule for stupid boys, and extended her hand to the boy in front of her.</p><p align="justify">“It’s nice to meet you, I’m Hermione Granger,” she introduced herself. Ron stared at her outstretched hand, bemused, before hesitantly reaching out his own. His hand was warm, Hermione noted, and bigger than hers despite their similar heights.</p><p align="justify">“Ron Weasley,” he mumbled, looking down at his feet.</p><p align="justify">Professor McGonagall cleared her throat, drawing the attention of both Hermione and the other Weasleys. “I don’t mean to interrupt, Molly, but I’m afraid that Miss Granger and I have quite a lot of shopping to do, and if we don’t get on our way I fear we’ll be stuck at Gringotts until every other shop on the Alley closes.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, of course, Professor!” Mrs Weasley exclaimed, shuffling the boys out of the way to allow them to pass.</p><p align="justify">Hermione trailed after Professor McGonagall as she headed towards the door at the back of the pub, waving bashfully at the family of redheads.</p><p align="justify">“Before I forget, do congratulate Charlie on his N.E.W.T. results for me,” Professor McGonagall added. “I believe Professor Kettleburn was particularly pleased with his ‘Outstanding’ in Care of Magical Creatures.”</p><p align="justify">Mrs Weasley beamed at the praise and thanked Professor McGonagall profusely.</p><p align="justify">Outside the pub – the Leaky Cauldron, according to the weathered sign above their heads – the two witches stood in front of an ordinary-looking brick wall, and Hermione wondered how this could possibly be hiding the entrance to the wizarding equivalent of Oxford Street. As soon as the thought crossed her mind, however, Professor McGonagall removed her wand from beneath the long sleeve of her dress and tapped a brick in the wall, which immediately began to move. Bricks shifted and reassembled themselves before Hermione’s eyes to form an archway, beyond which lay Diagon Alley.</p><p align="justify">Hermione’s jaw dropped at the sight. Hundreds of people clad in what she assumed to be wizarding robes of every colour, pattern, and style imaginable, although she could see some muggle outfits now and then. The shops, too, were unlike anything she had ever seen before. The street curved out of sight before long, but what Hermione could see was lined with shops boasting magical items, books, food, services, and anything else a witch or wizard could possibly need.</p><p align="justify">Professor McGonagall gave her a few moments to simply gape at the sight before her, but soon enough Hermione was ushered out of the archway and down into Diagon Alley itself. She let herself be guided through the crowds by Professor McGonagall, still too overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of the Alley to pay any attention to where exactly they were going.</p><p align="justify">Every way she turned her head, something new and fascinating caught her interest: a shop selling owls of every size and shape; two elderly wizards complaining loudly about the price of powdered moonstone – “Three galleons an ounce they were asking for at Southwood and Stott! Never heard such cheek before in my life, and I’m one hundred and five”; a busker conducting the instruments – <em>just</em> the instruments – of a string quartet with his wand.</p><p align="justify">Hermione was so caught up in trying to absorb every detail of the street around her that it was several minutes before she thought to look <em>ahead</em> of her. When she did, she was confronted by the sight of an imposing building, gleaming in the Sun. It dwarfed the shops on either side of it, which were clearly older and built from grey stone instead of the clean white marble of the giant building at the end of the Alley. Above the massive double doors, gold lettering spelled out GRINGOTTS.</p><p align="justify">“Welcome to Gringotts, Miss Granger,” Professor McGonagall interrupted her staring. “The oldest wizarding bank in England and by virtually all accounts, the best. I must warn you, it is run entirely by goblins – they aren’t exactly the friendliest beings, but they do good work.”</p><p align="justify">“Goblins?” Hermione questioned, eyes widening.</p><p align="justify">“The magical world is home to  beings and beasts of all kinds, Miss Granger, and you would do well to treat them with as much respect as you would afford any human being.” With that, Professor McGonagall led Hermione through the doors and into the building.</p><p align="justify">The interior of the building was just as impressive as the outside, and Hermione quickly discovered that the older witch had been entirely correct in her assessment of the goblins. They were brusque and unfriendly, but incredibly efficient, and before long Hermione found herself relieved of the muggle money her parents had given her, which had been replaced by a heavy pile of wizarding coins that seemed to have no logical reason behind their value. Professor McGonagall had explained to her how much each coin was worth, but Hermione was of the opinion that the wizarding world would greatly benefit from adopting the decimal system.</p><p align="justify">They made quick work of most of Hermione’s shopping, picking up a set of scales, a cauldron, several interesting-looking books and a few sets of robes in rapid succession. Eventually, the only essential item left on her list was a wand.</p><p align="justify">Hermione followed Professor McGonagall to a small, dark shop, barely noticeable tucked between its brightly-coloured, bustling neighbours. Looking at it gave Hermione a strange feeling in the pit of her stomach – not bad, but nothing she’d experienced before. Somehow, she knew that this was a place of powerful magic, even compared to the rest Diagon Alley.</p><p align="justify">Once they were inside, that feeling doubled in intensity. Despite its dusty, deserted appearance, the shop practically radiated <em>power</em>. An elderly man emerged noiselessly from behind a shelf stacked high with long, thin boxes – containing wands, Hermione presumed – and stared at the two witches with pale, unblinking eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Minerva McGonagall,” he said eventually. “I remember you well, Professor. Nine and a half inches, fir with dragon heartstring, yes?”</p><p align="justify">“Indeed, Mr Ollivander,” Professor McGonagall replied. She sounded slightly stiff; Hermione wondered if the shop gave her that same strange feeling Hermione felt.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, an excellent wand if I do say so myself, on the stiffer side but excellent for transfiguration. Your career choice after you resigned from the DMLE came as little surprise to me, Professor.”</p><p align="justify">Mr Ollivander turned his attention to Hermione. “This must be one of the new muggleborns students, of course. Your name, please?”</p><p align="justify">Hermione blinked, startled at being addressed so suddenly. “Hermione Granger, sir,” she replied.</p><p align="justify">“Miss Granger, very good. Now, which is your wand hand?” he asked, turning to one of the wand-filled shelves.</p><p align="justify">“Er, my left, sir?” It came out as a question. Hermione didn’t know if one’s wand hand was necessarily the one she wrote with, but it made sense to her, and she didn’t particularly want to ask.</p><p align="justify">“Excellent, excellent,” he mumbled, grabbing a box from the very top of the shelf. “Here we go, try this, Miss Granger. Eight inches, birch and unicorn hair. Good wand for charms work.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione found herself holding a pale wand and not having a clue what to do with it. She looked at Professor McGonagall. “Just try waving it, Miss Granger, to see how it responds to you. Wands contain powerful innate magic and as such some not respond well to a wizard or witch’s own magic. Mr Ollivander is rather fond of telling people that the wand – ”</p><p align="justify">“ – Chooses the wizard,” Mr Ollivander interrupted. Professor McGonagall gave him the same glare that Hermione’s primary school teachers had given misbehaving six-year-olds. “And, of course, the witch.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione, despite feeling rather silly, waved the wand in her hand tentatively. As far as she could see, nothing happened.</p><p align="justify">Mr Ollivander didn’t appear disappointed. On the contrary, he seemed oddly delighted as he took the wand out of her hand and replaced it with another. “Not to worry, perhaps this one – ten inches, oak and phoenix feather, might be a better fit…”</p><p align="justify">She had barely lifted the wand this time before Mr Ollivander snatched it back, again mumbling about it being “not the right fit.”</p><p align="justify">Several more boxes and the wands within them came and went, and Hermione, although she had the good sense not to say it out loud, was growing impatient. Eventually, Mr Ollivander handed her another wand – ten and three-quarter inches, vine and dragon heartstring – and instead of the decided inactivity that Hermione was used to, the tip of the wand produced a shower of coppery sparks when she waved it. The feeling was incredible, as though the powerful magic that Hermione had felt when she first entered the shop was being channelled through her.</p><p align="justify">“Well, Miss Granger, I do believe that you have found your wand,” Professor McGonagall said with a small smile, returned by Hermione’s beaming.</p><p align="justify">“Or rather, your wand has found you,” Mr Ollivander interjected. Professor McGonagall’s expression abruptly returned to its former disapproval, an expression that Hermione was already growing to fear above all else.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, thank you, Mr Ollivander,” she said, her voice clipped. “If you could let Miss Granger know how much her wand will be, we must be on our way.”</p><p align="justify">“Of course, of course,” Mr Ollivander replied, seemingly unaffected by Professor McGonagall’s expression – which only cemented Hermione’s first impression that he wasn’t quite right in the head. “That will be six galleons and twelve sickles, Miss Granger.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione paid and followed Professor McGonagall out of the shop, still clutching her new wand tightly in hand. She had never felt so powerful as when she had managed to produce those coppery sparks, and resolved quietly to herself that she would never forfeit that power for anything.</p><p align="justify"> </p>
<hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The summer dragged.</p><p align="justify">Hermione was well aware that most other children her age would be delighted at the prospect of a summer that never seemed to end, desperate to make the most of their last days before the looming prospect of secondary school grew too close for comfort. To her, however, the slow drag of lazy summer days was almost intolerable. She found that she just couldn’t enjoy her ordinary little summer in her ordinary little town when she knew that there was a whole new world of the <em>extraordinary</em> waiting for her in September.</p><p align="justify">She occupied herself, mostly, with her new school books. She had never turned down an opportunity to learn something new, and she was acutely aware that not growing up in a wizarding family like the ancient families in <em>A History of Magic </em>would put her behind by default. Astronomy and Herbology, she had to admit, didn’t particularly excite her except where they related to the subject of Potions, which did. Along with Potions, Transfiguration and Charms were quickly rising among the list of subjects as potential favourites. She was itching to try out some of the spells from her textbook, but Professor McGonagall had warned her that now that she had her wand, doing magic outside of Hogwarts would land her in serious trouble – and that attempting spells for the first time with no way to fix anything that might go wrong was probably a bad idea anyway. So for now, she contented herself with the theory, which was fascinating enough in itself that she didn’t feel the loss too keenly.</p><p align="justify">When Hermione wasn’t reading, she was writing. Hogwarts, apparently, required the use of feather quills and inkpots. On a purely aesthetic level, Hermione could see the appeal; on the level of an actual human being, however, she hated quills. Everything took twice as long to write with a quill due to having to dip the nib in ink every few words, and that didn’t even account for the fact that quills were absolutely not designed with left-handed people like Hermione in mind. She couldn’t rest her hand on the paper she was using to practice without smudging her words so badly they were barely legible. She was determined to master quills before the start of the school year – surely the wizarding world had other left-handed people?</p><p align="justify">The end of August came, and with it an uptick in stress at the Granger household. Trains to London were booked, textbooks were anxiously reread, and the large, old-fashioned trunk that had sat empty in the corner of Hermione’s room since July slowly started to fill.</p><p align="justify">“Dad, have you seen my Herbology textbook?” Hermione cried two days before she was due to leave for Hogwarts, tearing through the stack of books-to-reread beside her bed.</p><p align="justify">“You packed it last night, Hermione!” her dad replied. “And don’t even think about taking it back out! God only knows how we’re going to get all your things packed if you keep refusing to put a single book in your trunk!”</p><p align="justify">Reluctantly, Hermione resigned herself to the fact that she would have to put a hold on her plans to triple-check the optimal planting season for bouncing bulbs. After an extended argument with both her parents, she allowed most of her books to be stowed away at the bottom of her trunk, except for the one non-essential book she had bought for herself at Professor McGonagall’s recommendation – <em>Hogwarts: A History</em>, by Bathilda Bagshot, who had also written Hermione’s History of Magic textbook. In the last few days of August, Hermione pored over it almost obsessively; memorising the map of the castle, studying the histories of the four Houses and their founders, marvelling at the layers upon layers of complex protective enchantments that kept Hogwarts safe from the muggle world beyond its grounds.</p><p align="justify">The first of September 1991 dawned bright and warm. Hermione knew this because she had been awake for over an hour when dawn broke. Despite this, she had yet to drum up the necessary courage to get out of her bed and face that this was the day her magical education began.</p><p align="justify"><em>Perhaps if I just stay here I won’t have to think about it,</em> she lamented to herself, conveniently ignoring the irony of the thought before proceeding to think about <em>it</em> excessively. <em>What if the Sorting Hat decides I don’t actually deserve to be in any of the Houses and they send me home? Or I’m really rubbish at magic compared to everyone who grew up with wizarding parents? What if I get Sorted into Slytherin and they all hate me because I’m muggleborns? </em>Hogwarts: A History<em> says that Salazar Slytherin hated muggleborns and a lot of people who still hate muggleborns were Slytherins!</em></p><p align="justify">She continued in her panicked train of thought until her mum came to tell her that breakfast was ready, and was greeted by the sight of her very stressed-out daughter practically jumping out of her skin. Hermione was so preoccupied with her own thoughts that the sound of her bedroom door opening had startled her.</p><p align="justify">“’Mione, darling, what’s wrong?” her mum asked, setting herself down gingerly at the end of Hermione’s bed.</p><p align="justify">Hermione, according to everyone who cared to comment on such things, looked very much like Amorette Granger. They shared the same sort of round face, the same dark, clever eyes, and the same deep brown skin tone – much darker than the comparatively light-skinned Thomas Granger. The only major difference, the one that people loved to point out as though neither Hermione nor her mum had noticed before, was their hair. Amorette kept hers tightly braided and pulled back, whereas Hermione’s was a riot of untamed curls.</p><p align="justify">“What if I’m not good enough to go to Hogwarts?” she blurted out before she could stop herself. “Every book I’ve read says that Hogwarts is one of the best magical schools in the world, what if they don’t think I’m good enough to stay? What if this is all a big mistake and I’m not really a witch after all?”</p><p align="justify">Amorette reached out and clasped her daughter’s hands in her own. “Hermione Jean Granger, you could tell me right now that you don’t want anything to do with Hogwarts, and that you just want to go to a muggle school and completely ignore that wizards exist for the rest of your life, and I’d be okay with that. Even if you're the worst witch in the universe, even if you're not a witch at all, that wouldn’t change the fact that me and Dad love you, and we’re so incredibly proud of you whatever you choose to do, because nothing will.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione smiled weakly, breaking free of her mum’s grip to wipe away a stray tear that had escaped onto her cheek without permission. “Thanks, Mum.”</p><p align="justify">The sound of Hermione’s dad shouting from the kitchen that they were going to miss their train unless they ate breakfast <em>now</em> ended the moment, and Hermione quickly found herself rushed off her feet, entirely too busy with locating misplaced odds and ends to worry about what came next.</p>
