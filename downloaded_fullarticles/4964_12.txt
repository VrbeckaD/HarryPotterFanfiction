    <p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
<p>When Fleur Delacour's name was called from the Goblet of Fire, she feels like she's going to puke.</p>
<p>"Fleur!" Anna hisses. "Fleur, get up there!"</p>
<p>Fleur slowly nods and pulls herself to her feet amidst cheering from the Beauxbatons students. She forces herself to smile and nod at her well wishers, waving to Anna and the Ravenclaw table as she begins to walk away.</p>
<p>"Good luck, Fleur," says a pretty black-haired girl sitting at the table. She smiles warmly at Fleur, and something in Fleur's stomach nervously twists.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Fleur mumbles.</p>
<p>She walks up to the podium and nods at Professor Dumbledore before slipping behind the curtain with Viktor Krum, the Durmstrang champion. Once she is in the room, she discovers it to have a few armchairs and a single brown couch. A warm fire blazes on the right side of the room. Krum is standing against the wall, eyeing her with beady eyes and a thick nose.</p>
<p><i> He looks rather like Professor Snape when he looks like that, </i> Fleur thinks. </p>
<p>She takes a seat on the armchair facing towards the curtain, and has just begun to wonder how long this will take when the Hogwarts Champion walks through the curtain.</p>
<p>"Finally," mumbles Fleur.</p>
<p>"I'm Cedric Diggory," the boy says breathlessly. For a male, he is rather good looking. Fleur arches an eyebrow at a tear in his robes before returning her attention to a scratch on one of her white nails. </p>
<p>Gabrielle did those nails.</p>
<p>Fleur tears her gaze away from them and back onto the boy. "Diggory, you said?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," he says.</p>
<p>"Krum," mutters Viktor from the back of the room, and Fleur nearly jumps. She had no idea he was listening.</p>
<p>"I'm Fleur Delacour," Fleur said, extending her hand to shake Diggory's.</p>
<p>She is suprised when he brushes a kiss across her knuckles.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she exclaims.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I just thought..."</p>
<p>"Oh no, I'm just pleased," Fleur assures him. "That was very chivlarous of you."</p>
<p>Diggory blushes at her praise. "Thank you." </p>
<p> He puts his hands behind his back and stares into the fire, conteplating something. </p>
<p> Alll of a sudden, another boy walks through the curtain. He is small, and Fleur eyes duct tape on the bridge of his glasses and wonders whether the boy is alright. </p>
<p> "What is it?" she asks, trying to make her voice as soft as possible. "Do they want us back in the Hall?" </p>
<p> The boy stands there. </p>
<p> Ludo Bagman enters the room, and Fleur frowns. She's never liked the Ministry man, he seems ridiculously incompetent. </p>
<p> "Extraordinary!" he exclaims, squeezing the boy's arm. "Absolutely extraordinary! Gentlemen... lady. May I introduce - incredible though it may seem - the fourth Triwizard champion!" </p>
<p> Fleur wonders whether he's gone mad. She tosses her hair over her shoulder and smiles. "Oh, very funny joke, Mr. Bagman." </p>
<p> "Joke? No, no, not at all! Harry's name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!" </p>
<p> Fleur wants to scream at him that clearly this boy is too young, he's too small, and you should wrap him in a blanket and force feed him something because he's skinnier than the quills she writes with. "But evidently there has been a mistake, He cannot compete. He is too young." </p>
<p> Mr. Bagman flounders for excuses, but Fleur is having none of it. When Madame Maxime walks through the door, she walks over to her headmistress. </p>
<p> "Madame Maxime!" she says. "They are saying that this little boy is to compete also!" </p>
<p> <i> And the boy can't compete, he's young, he's scared, and he has an expression on her face that reminds her so much of Gabrielle she feels like she might crumble to pieces, because the boy will </i> die. </p>
<p> The adults argue about Harry competing in the Tournament for a long time, but Fleur hardly cares what they're saying. She sits on her armchair and stares into the fire angrily until Mr. Crouch says her name. </p>
<p> "Fleur, Viktor, Cedric, Harry... the first task is designed to test your daring, so we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is a very important quality in a wizard... very important..." he says. "The first task will take place on November 24th, in front of a panel of judges..." </p>
<p> Fleur tunes out the rest of what he's saying about rules and guidelines and instead thinks about the pretty Ravenclaw who wished her luck, and she feels a pleasant feeling in her stomach, almost like butterflies. </p>
<p> Madame Maxime comes over to her, putting an arm around her shoulders and leading her out of the room. "Fleur dear, I do hope you come up with a good plan. Beauxbatons has two wins over Hogwarts in the Triwizard Tournament, and we wouldn't want them catching up, right?" </p>
<p> "Of course not," Fleur says. </p>
<p> Madame Maxime looks placated. "Off to bed with you, you've got a lot of research to do tommorow!" </p>
<p> Fleur nods and walks off to the Beauxbatons carriage before Madame Maxime calls out once more. </p>
<p> "Oh, and Fleur?" </p>
<p> "Oui?" </p>
<p> "Try not to get involved in... boyfriends. I know you want to find romantic love, but during the Triwizard Tournament is not the time, okay?" </p>
<p> "Of course not, Madame. </p>
<p> Fleur heads straight to bed, and even if dreams of the Ravenclaw girl haunt her all night, that isn't <i> her </i> fault. </p>
<p> After all, Madame said no boyfriends. </p>
