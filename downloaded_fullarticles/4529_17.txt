    <p>"I have to win," Oliver muttered to himself as he ran through the list of drills for the next practice.</p><p>The championship game that would determine whether Gryffindor won the Quidditch cup or not was three weeks away and Oliver was losing his mind. He was behind in his work, his sleeping schedule was out of whack, and to top it all off he was trying to wrap his head around graduating.</p><p>"Go to sleep Wood," Percy mumbled hoping it was loud enough for the Quidditch Captain to hear. It was almost two in the morning and while Percy considered himself a night owl he also enjoyed sleeping.</p><p>"Can't," The candle that was providing Oliver light to see was slowly diminishing "Have to win."</p><p>Percy threw the covers off his body and walked over to Wood's desk. He peered down at Oliver's messy handwritten notes. The Prefect blew the candle out and dragged the brown-haired boy to bed.</p><p>"Percy, I don't need to sleep." Percy pushed the boy onto the bed "I need to plan."</p><p>"Listen Wood," Percy ran a hand through his hair. "The more you worry about the game the worst it's going to get"</p><p>"I don't have a clue what you're talking about Weasley"</p><p>"Your anxiety"</p><p>Oliver went to talk but Percy shushed him. The redhead knew what was about to happen. The first few years they lived at Hogwarts Oliver didn't let anyone in. The walls that he had built weren't coming down anytime soon, but that didn't mean they weren't transparent.</p><p>Percy had managed to read Oliver like a book and that's why they never got along. The Weasley knew all about Wood's anxiety which had seemed to go away after their third year. Percy knew it was because of Charlie who was the one that got Oliver to be confident in himself.</p><p>Charlie was the one who stayed behind every practice to help Oliver. He ran extra drills with the younger boy and basically adopted Wood as a younger brother. That's why Percy always held a bit of resentment towards the Quidditch player.</p><p>The two boys sat in utter silence for a while on Oliver's bed. Percy didn't know how to continue his train of thought.</p><p>"How do you know about it?"</p><p>"I started noticing it in Second year when you got hit. You stopped sleeping every time a match rolled around, your hands would shake, and you got behind in your work." Percy took a shuttering breath "That's why I asked Charlie to help you"</p><p>Percy asked his older brother to help his roommate in the hopes that maybe Oliver would become his friend. They got along fine First year and Percy really needed friends. But then Oliver took to Charlie and quickly stopped talking about anything other than Quidditch.</p><p>"Why did you do that?" Oliver's mind was racing "You hate me."</p><p>"I actually wanted to be your friend but you were always with Charlie" Percy started picking at the skin on his fingers "I got a bit jealous"</p><p>Percy wished he had a muggle camera so he could have immortalized the look on Wood's face. With the rush of Gryffindor courage that was racing through his blood, Percy went to tell Oliver the real reason behind helping him.</p><p>"But I soon realized that I didn't want to be your friend," The last sliver of courage was slipping "I wanted to impress you."</p><p>Percy thought he was going to actually manage to say it this time. But he couldn't utter the words no matter how hard he tried. After seven years he still couldn't admit what he was feeling. He wondered how he even got in Gryffindor most days but he really questioned it in that moment.</p><p>"People only want to impress people they like not prospective friendsâ€¦" Oliver trailed off in the end realization hitting him. "You know what I think we should sleep now"</p>
