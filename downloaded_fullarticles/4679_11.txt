  <u><strong>Augustina POV</strong> </u>
</p><p>Augustina was sitting beside Simon in the coffee shop which was their regular hangout. Steaming coffee and a plate of biscottis at hand, they sat, anxiously waiting for their best friend Clary to return. Clary had gone for her interview at The Brooklyn Academy of Art. They both knew how much Clary wanted to get through. Simon was going on about the latest Sci-Fi flick he saw, eyes alight and hands gesticulating. Augustina felt a surge of fondness for her friend. She had just returned after a year out in the field. Neither Simon nor Clary knew what she did for a job. All they knew is that she graduated at 17, from an apparently exclusive school. They did know she was different though. Not different as in as a person. Different as in having some kind of power. And they were right.</p><p>Augustina remembered vividly the day she came to this life. Living the life of a no-maj, while trying to control the surges of magic that would flow through her. But that was years ago. She was now a fully trained auror. Yet she remembered that day like it was yesterday. The day she lost her mother and gained another.</p><p>
  <em>17 Years Ago</em>
</p><p>
  <em>2 year old Augustina clung to her mother, anxious at the fear in her brave mother's eyes. She was wrapped up in her favorite blanket, but was still shivering owing to the chill the air seemed to carry. Her mother knocked on the simple yet elegant door thrice, her trembling hand giving away her panic. The door opened to reveal a pretty  middle aged woman, with brown hair and warm brown eyes. She took one look at the mother and daughter and moved to open the door, silently indicating them to enter.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The lady closed the door after them. Augustina took her time to study the woman, something telling her that she was not ordinary. "I'm sorry Dot, but I didn't know where to go and..", her mother's quivering voice scared Augustina. She now recognized the woman, of whom her mother used to speak. A dear friend, in times when there were none.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"It's okay, Margaret. What happened? Where is James?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Her mother began to tremble even more. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"They found him."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>At this, Dot gasped. "Oh my God. What are you going to do Maggie?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"That leads me to why I came here. We kept it hidden that we have Tina. We couldn't have exposed her to the danger.Will you take care of her Dot? Look after her? Because I'm their next target. They can't find out about Tina. No matter what. Especially with her abilities..."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Her other's voice had grown stronger as she spoke. Dot looked at her for a few moments before giving a determined nod. "I'll protect her Maggie. You can trust me. I'll ask Magnus too."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The relief in Margaret's eyes was profound. "Thank you Dorothea. I'm indebted to you. And Magnus too. Would you do one more thing? Would you guide her when her magic sets in? Explain to her who she really is?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Of course. We Warlocks know how it feels to stumble through discovering our powers. I'll ensure she knows everything by the time she's ready to go."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For the first time Augustina spoke up. The voices in her head were becoming too painful for her to handle. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What is happening Mommy? Are you leaving me? And when I'm ready to go where?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dot looked at her in awe, while her mother smiled, albeit sadly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"How is she already so intelligent? Surely she couldn't understand all of that?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Margaret shook her head. An obviously fond gesture. "I told you why she's so special. Her perceptiveness is only one of her abilities. When she realizes the others, please help her will you?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What other abilities does she have?"Dot asked, intrigued.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Not now. I have to leave now. Thank you Dorothea. You'll never know how grateful I'm to you for doing this."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dot smiled, a smile full of sadness, and hugged her dear friend. "No my dear. You know I'll do anything to help you. As you and James have helped us so. We can never forget that. The Circle would not have crumbled without you."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"We did what we had to. Good bye Dot." Margaret whispered. She then knelt down to her daughter.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Augustina looked up at her mother. She may not know what was happening precisely, but the emotions in the room were those of sadness, loss and separation. None of which her 2 year old mind liked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"My sunshine. Never forget yourself.You are stronger than you know. I'll always be with you."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Augustina wanted to cling on to her mother, never draw away from her warm arms and comforting smell. But she had to. And she could never be in those arms again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Both Dot and Tina, hand in hand, watched as Margaret stepped out. It had begun to drizzle. They watched as she walked down the street, scarf drawn closer, until suddenly, she wasn't there anymore.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That was the last time either of them saw her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Present</em>
</p><p>Augustina had buried the grief of her parents' passing long ago. She still saw the lingering sadness  in Dot's eyes. It made her wonder, what her mother could possibly have done to gain the trust and goodwill of such a powerful being. Even more so how she could possibly have gained<em> Magnus Bane's</em> goodwill.</p><p>She was drawn out of her thoughts as a familiar flash of red hair caught her eye. Clary was making her way over to them. Clary was like the sister Augustina might have had. Her short stature completely belied her fiery, passionate personality.Even as a child she was fiercely protective of her small family. Augustina had sworn to protect her, even before Dot told her of Clary's past. A past which Clary herself was unaware of. </p><p>Augustina frowned as she took in her sister's expression, or lack of thereof.</p><p>"So whom do we have to kill?" Trust Simon to jump to the worst conclusions.</p><p>Augustina rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Congratulations Clary! I knew you would have gotten it!" Augustina tried not to sound as teary and proud as she felt.</p><p>Simon looked at Clary for confirmation. When Clary could no longer keep up her facade, she burst into a radiant smile and nodded.</p><p>"Yes. I got it! But it's creepy how easily you saw through my poker face." Clary smiled cheekily, though her happiness covered up the teasing.</p><p>"You don't possibly read minds do you Tina?"asked Simon, his expression curious. </p><p>Augustina smirked. "I do a lot of things Simon."</p><p>Simon rolled his eyes, but then he grinned. Which sent off warning signs in Augustina's mind.</p><p>"So.... to celebrate Clary's birthday we're going to Pandemonium. And you're coming with us. No arguements." </p><p>"Simon you know I hate clubs. Especially that one. I won't be caught dead there." she shuddered, imagining the amount of strength it would take to contol her mind in such a crowd. That and the fact that Magnus's club could actually have dead people in there. As vampires.</p><p>Simon was about to speak when Clary interrupted him.</p><p>"Where's my biscotti?" she pouted, scrunching her nose adorably. "I swear it was here."</p><p>"You must have eaten it. Don't worry we'll get more, okay?" </p><p>"Yeah...okay..." Clary's response seemed off. Augustina followed her curious gaze, which was focused on the napkin beside her plate. She spotted the very much real looking biscotti on the paper,  only now it was 2D. Augustina's eyes widened. </p><p>
  <em>It's beginning.</em>
