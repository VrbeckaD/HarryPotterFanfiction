    <p> </p><p>PART ONE</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The air was damp and cold, understandable for the time of year, and Harry was eager to get in from the miserable October night. His home, 12 Grimmauld Place, was a short walk from the apparition point. It had been a long day and he'd been looking forward to a hot chocolate and hotter shower since about lunchtime. Now, at almost midnight, lunchtime seemed like a lifetime ago. Finally he reached the looming black door of his home and he tingled with anticipation for the relaxation he had craved. After being out in the field (literally at some points) for almost a fortnight he had been granted a week off from his Auror duties. Time to relax, recharge his batteries and catch up with his nearest and dearest. Home-cooked food from Mrs Weasley and a butterbeer or ten with Ron was all he had to look forward to for the next seven days. That, and some serious catching up with his....well he wasn't sure what Draco was. Boyfriend? Companion? Fuck-buddy? They hadn't actually defined their relationship and in all honesty it wasn't something Harry wanted to think too long on, especially when he was aching all over and smelled like the field he'd been living in for the past week. </p><p> </p><p>Harry opened the door and stepped inside. He felt the change in the air instantly. His Auror-senses were tingling. With a flick of his wand he quickly established that there hadn't been an intruder in his home. His wards were all still in place. But something was different. He shrugged it off and headed to the kitchen, kicking his boots off on the way. He discarded his thick outer robes and left them on the back of a chair in the kitchen. He was about to make his hot chocolate when a cold voice broke into his blissful silence. </p><p>"Where the fuck have you been?"</p><p>Harry reeled around, wand raised and ready to hex whoever had broken into his home. He came face to face with Draco Malfoy.  And Draco looked pissed. </p><p>"Draco! Fucking hell! Are you trying to kill me?" Harry gasped as he lowered his wand. </p><p>The usual slate-grey eyes had been replaced with glittering silver as Draco glared at Harry from the doorway. </p><p>"Potter. Where have you been?"</p><p>"Working! How did you even get in here?"</p><p>"Working? I haven't heard a word from you in SEVENTEEN days! Not a single word!"</p><p>Harry was squinting with exhaustion and trying to focus on Draco.</p><p>"Harry!"</p><p>The use of his first name made him snap his head up. Anger flooded him. </p><p>"What do you want me to say Draco?! I was working. I've spent the last two weeks in the field tracking a deranged madman intent on killing as many people as fucking possible. I've lived in makeshift huts and washed in freezing cold dirty river water. I've had no viable way of contacting ANYONE and I've been hit with three consecutive stinging hexes. And you have the nerve to break in here and demand to know where I've been? You're not my fucking keeper Malfoy. You were the one that left last time, during the night so I was alone when I woke up. Now I'm cold, hungry, tired and aching from my eyebrows to my toenails so kindly fuck off and leave me be. Please." Harry spat angrily. </p><p>Draco gazed back levelly before raising a perfectly groomed eyebrow. "You were hexed?"</p><p>"Many times. Why are you still here?" Harry retorted. "And how are you here in the first place? Never mind. I'm too tired to care."</p><p>Draco strode into the kitchen and waved his wand in several directions. The fire burst into life, glorious orange flames dancing and warming the room. The kettle on the stove began to warm up. Cups appeared and dishes moved around. </p><p>"Sit down Harry. Before you fall down." Draco instructed. </p><p>Harry stared in disbelief at the scene in front of him but did as he was told. He sank into a chair at the dining table and watched as Draco worked his way around the kitchen using his wand to make two hot chocolates laced with firewhiskey and a cheese and pickle sandwich for Harry. It all arrived on the table in front of him and he couldn't help but stare at the blond opposite him. </p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>"You're welcome. Are you hurt?"</p><p>Harry shook his head as he chewed his food. "No, just sore."</p><p>"Did you catch him?"</p><p>"Yes. In Oxfordshire. He was hiding out in the forests."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Silence descended upon them as Harry finished his sandwich. He pushed the plate away and sipped his drink, the warmth of it reaching his insides and making him tingle. </p><p>"I'm a Black. This is my ancestral home. That's why I'm able to come here. The wards recognise my magic."</p><p>Harry listened to Draco's explanation and nodded once. "Makes sense."</p><p>Draco sipped his drink elegantly. </p><p>"So...you missed me then." Harry tried to joke. </p><p>Draco rolled his eyes. "I never said that Potter."</p><p>"You didn't need to."</p><p>Draco sighed. "I should let you get some rest."</p><p>Harry nodded. "That would be nice."</p><p>"Do you need anything before I go?" Draco asked quietly. </p><p>Harry smiled weakly. "Maybe just a hug."</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes again. "Malfoys don't hug Potter."</p><p>"Don't hug Potters or don't hug in general?"</p><p>Harry stopped smirking at Draco's withering frown. </p><p>"Fine. Just some peace and quiet then please. You know where the door is, see yourself out. I'm going for a shower."</p><p>Harry made it to the doorway before Draco grabbed his wrist and pulled him closer. He tentatively wrapped his arms around Harry, who immediately winced as Draco came into contact with the remnants of the stinging hexes on his back. </p><p>"Are you ok?" Draco pulled away. </p><p>Harry nodded. "Yeah. I'll be fine. Ginny will be here in the morning, she can check me over."</p><p>Draco's expression hardened at the mention of Harry's ex-girlfriend. </p><p>"Right." He said acidly. "I'll be off then."</p><p>Harry leaned closer and gently pressed his lips to Draco's before pulling away again. "Thanks for this Draco. You're the first person I've seen other than a lunatic serial killer in two weeks. It's been nice."</p><p>Draco, softened by the brief kiss, smirked. "With the bar set so high I'm so glad I could be of some help. Goodnight Harry."</p><p>"Goodnight Draco."</p><p> </p><p>Ginny arrived a little before 11am to feed and check on Harry's owl Toby and realised immediately Harry was home. She headed up to his room and found Harry was still fast asleep. She grinned at the sight of him sprawled across the bed on his stomach and buried under the thick blankets. </p><p>"Harry love. Time to get up. I'll make you some coffee and a bacon sandwich." She called out softly. </p><p>Harry grunted in response so she left him to wake up and headed to the kitchen. </p><p>"Strange." She smirked as she cleared away two cups and one plate from the dining table. "He's had a visitor already."</p><p>She set about making breakfast for Harry and heard him moving around upstairs. The shower came on and ten minutes later Harry padded into the kitchen wearing cargo pants and a black t-shirt. Quidditch and Auror training had sculpted his body to lean muscle. He was just over 6ft tall having had a growth spurt in his late-teens. Now 25 he was the dream date of many a girl. And boy. </p><p>"Hello Gin." He greeted with a warm smile. </p><p>She embraced him tightly. "Welcome home."</p><p>"Thanks. Everything ok with you?"</p><p>"Fine. Busy with work, St Mungos has me doing 14 hour split shifts. They're a killer. But only for a few more weeks. Then Blaise is taking me to Italy for a week of sun, sea, sand and something else..."</p><p>Harry chuckled. "Dirty girl."</p><p>"Don't you dirty girl me. I saw the two cups on the table this morning. You had company last night. Fast worker."</p><p>Harry barked a laugh. "I'll take that as the compliment I'm sure was intended."</p><p>"Draco?"</p><p>"Yup."</p><p>"He's been worried about you. Or so Blaise says. Apparently Draco has been more irritable than usual, which is a sign of things on his mind. The inner workings of Draco Malfoy are not my specialist subject though."</p><p>"Not mine either. I kicked him out."</p><p>"What?" Ginny gasped. </p><p>"I was tired and sore and in no mood to play his games."</p><p>"Sore? Were you hurt?" Ginny was suddenly in Healer mode. </p><p>"A few stinging hexes. Nothing major."</p><p>"Can I be the judge of that?" She raised an eyebrow. </p><p>"By all means." Harry agreed and pulled the t-shirt over his head to reveal rock hard abs. </p><p>"Bloody hell Harry. Give a girl some warning. I could've injured myself swooning there!" She teased. </p><p>"Funny." He grinned and turned around to show off his back. It was covered with what resembled the worst nettle rash ever seen. </p><p>"Oh Harry..." Ginny frowned. </p><p>"It's nothing. I've had worse."</p><p>"It's not nothing you idiot! This should have been looked at last night. It needs dittany."</p><p>"There we go then. Problem solved." Harry flashed another diverting grin. </p><p>Ginny reached into her bag and pulled out a bottle. "It will be easier to do this if you're sitting down, Beanstalk."</p><p>Harry straddled a chair backwards and leaned forward, stretching the planes of his back out for Ginny to see. She carefully applied the potion and instantly Harry felt the burn dissipating. He moaned with relief. </p><p>"Well this is interesting..." A voice drawled from the doorway. </p><p>"Draco! What the fuck...?" Harry jumped. </p><p>Ginny stilled him with a hand on his shoulder. "You need to stay still for a while."</p><p>Harry glared angrily at the haughty blond. </p><p>"I thought I made it clear last night that I didn't want you just barging in here unannounced! Do I have to get Ron here to arrest you?" Harry snapped. </p><p>"Better off getting Hermione here to fix your wards..." Ginny muttered. </p><p>Draco turned his steely gaze on Ginny. "Well there's no chance of either of those things happening. Both would require Potter to admit to his closest friends that he's been in contact with me without their knowledge. And we all know Voldemort would rise again before that will happen..."</p><p>Harry exhaled through his nose in an effort to remain calm. "I'm not the one with the problem when it comes to people knowing about us. That's all on you!"</p><p>Draco narrowed his eyes. "All on me? Come off it Potter. You'd do anything but tell Weasley and Granger the truth. You know very well how they'd react and that terrifies you. So put all the blame on me. Yes, I admit I don't want all and sundry to know my business but I certainly don't skulk around in shadows and lie to my best friends about who I spend my time with!"</p><p>"Ginny is my best friend and she knows about us!" Harry yelled. </p><p>Ginny glanced from one man to the other. They were both beautiful men and their anger only made them more attractive. Sparks flew between them in a way Ginny had never experienced with any of her ex-boyfriends. Only Blaise incited that level of passion in her. It was comforting in a way. </p><p>"Honestly! How did the pair of you ever stop fighting long enough to fuck?" She shouted louder than both of them. </p><p>Harry shut up immediately and Draco turned to Ginny. </p><p>"I beg your pardon?"</p><p>She shook her head. "I'm genuinely curious. At no point have either of you shared a civil word today and yet somehow you've been intimate with each other. How? How did you get there?"</p><p>"It's none of your business." Draco snapped. </p><p>"I just don't see the point. Both of you are good looking blokes. You could score a shag any day of the week. Why put yourselves through this...hysteria...for the sake of a shag? I'm baffled."</p><p>Harry frowned. "It's not always like this."</p><p>"Oh? You don't always threaten to have him arrested?"</p><p>"No..."</p><p>"And you sometimes care enough about Harry to make sure he sees a Healer when he's injured?" She asked Draco. </p><p>"Of course." Draco replied through gritted teeth. </p><p>"So why don't you do us all a favour and stop this pathetic charade? You're both useless at it. Now I have to get to work. Harry, it's great to see you back. Don't forget to feed Toby. Ron will be over later no doubt. He was saying yesterday he was hoping you'd be home in time for...well, you know."</p><p>Harry gave her a weak smile. "I know. Thanks Gin."</p><p>She hugged him carefully. "See you soon."</p><p>With a look of contempt at Draco she left them alone. </p><p> </p><p>Harry pulled his t-shirt back on as he waited for Draco to speak. He didn't have to wait long. </p><p>"What are you home in time for?"</p><p>Harry shrugged. "Nothing."</p><p>"Didn't sound like nothing." Draco shot back. </p><p>"Why do you care Malfoy? Why are you here? We keep going round in circles. Nothing ever changes. You want to fuck? Is that why you're here?"</p><p>"Don't be so coarse Harry." Draco scolded. </p><p>"Oh it's Harry again is it? You change your tune so often I get whiplash." Harry snarled. He really wasn't in the mood to play Draco's games today either. </p><p>"What the fuck is your problem? I came to see that you were ok. I was worried..." Draco snapped. </p><p>"Worried I was ok, or worried I was shagging Ginny on the kitchen table?"</p><p>Draco flushed and pursed his lips. "Don't be ridiculous."</p><p>"I'm not ridiculous Draco. You're the one that can't stand to acknowledge any relationship with me yet still gets jealous of a girl I dated nine years ago, before I worked out I was gayer than Christmas in a pink tent. And she's very much involved with your best mate. So knock it off with the act eh? It's getting old." Harry ranted. </p><p>Draco gazed at him calmly. "She just has this...way...with you, with Blaise, with life. She's comfortable in every situation, even the most uncomfortable. I've never been like that. I envy her sometimes..." Draco trailed off as he blushed deeper. It was all coming out now!</p><p>"Really?" Harry looked unconvinced. </p><p>"Really." Draco replied coolly. "Not that we need tell her that."</p><p>"Of course not." Harry rolled his eyes. </p><p>"What are you home in time for?" Draco repeated. </p><p>Harry sighed loudly. "Nothing. It's nothing really..."</p><p>"Please tell me."</p><p>"It's Halloween today." Harry spoke softly, his voice thick with emotion. "The day my parents died."</p><p>Draco felt the air leave his lungs in a rush. </p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Harry straightened himself up in a visible show of strength that he didn't really feel. </p><p>"It's nothing. Do you want some tea?"</p><p>Draco nodded. "Coffee please."</p><p> </p><p>The urge to touch Harry was too much for Draco. Not in a sexual way. He needed to feel him. To feel that he wasn't broken. He couldn't remember the day everything changed for Draco. He'd fallen into a pattern of one-nighters with Harry several months ago after meeting him in a pub while out with Blaise. They may have despised each other at school but Draco wasn't blind. Harry was gorgeous. Tall, messy dark hair, piercing green eyes and a lean body. Just Draco's type. He'd known he was gay from a young age. The thought of sleeping with Pansy Parkinson was disgusting to him, even though she was the most popular and pretty female Slytherin (the only house he would consider touching). He knew from about 15 that he fancied boys but he did nothing about it until after the left Hogwarts and could experiment privately. Finding out Harry was the same way inclined had come as a shock, to Draco's knowledge he'd always dated girls, but the attraction between them was clear. Physically, at least. After several drinks Ginny and Blaise had bailed on them and left the former enemies to make drunken conversation. When that led to arguments and bickering Harry solved the problem by pushing Draco against a wall and snogging him senseless before taking him home and showing him how tidy his bedroom was. Draco fled in a panic while Harry was asleep but it was a matter of days before Draco found himself back in Harry's bed. And so began their bizarre relationship. Only Ginny and Blaise knew about it, which suited all parties perfectly. Until now. Something along the way had changed. They talked more. They shared a meal sometimes. They had breakfast together before they parted after a passionate night. They owled each other when they were apart. Somehow, they'd become a quasi-couple without either of them even realising it. A secret, forbidden couple. </p><p> </p><p>Harry jumped slightly when Draco placed his hands on Harry's hips from behind. He was close, chest against Harry's back. </p><p>"I was so worried." Draco whispered. </p><p>"I'm fine Draco." Harry exhaled. </p><p>Draco's lips ghosted across the back of Harry's neck, goosebumps appearing instantly. Harry turned in his arms and Draco immediately kissed him. It was soft and gentle. Lips moving so slowly it was impossible to tell they were actually kissing at all. Harry let Draco press him back against the kitchen counter. His hands found themselves in Draco's neatly cropped blond hair, tugging gently and directing his lips as they moved over his own. Draco let out a little whimper as Harry's tongue traced his lips. Things were just heating up when the floo in Harry's lounge roared to life. Harry went rigid and pulled away from Draco. </p><p>"Harry? You here mate?" Ron's deep voice boomed. </p><p>Draco gazed calmly at Harry as he waited for the inevitable. He would be cast aside and told to keep out of the way until Ron had left. It had happened before and it would happen again now. </p><p>Suddenly Harry grabbed Draco's face in his large hands and stared into his eyes. </p><p>"Tell me this is worth it." He implored. </p><p>"What?" Draco frowned. </p><p>"Tell me this...whatever we have...is worth it. Tell me we really have something here and I'll tell my friends about us."</p><p>"Harry..."</p><p>"I can't risk losing everyone I love for you if you can't tell me we are worth it." Harry stated quietly but firmly. </p><p>Draco felt his face break into a huge smile. "Of course we're worth it."</p><p>"Really?" Harry looked stunned. </p><p>"Ginny is right. We need to stop the charade. I can't pretend it's just about sex anymore."</p><p>"Neither can I." Harry agreed. </p><p>Draco pressed his lips to Harry's. "You don't have to tell them now..."</p><p>"Good a time as any." Harry shrugged. </p><p>Just then the kitchen door burst open and the gangly ginger frame of Ron Weasley appeared. </p><p>"Harry!" He greeted warmly, the smile only slipping when he saw Draco Malfoy standing next to his best friend. "What's he doing here?"</p><p>Harry took a deep breath. "Well...that's something I've been meaning to talk to you and Mione about..."</p><p>Ron caught on immediately. He might not be known for his brain cells but he was actually very astute. "Oh no! Harry no! Not him!"</p><p>Draco coughed. "I'm standing right here Weasley."</p><p>"That's the problem Malfoy." Ron retorted. </p><p>"Ron..." Harry sighed wearily. "This is still really new. We're working things out. Please try to be civil."</p><p>Ron curled his lip. "Civil? Are you joking?"</p><p>Harry drew himself up to his full height. "Yes. Civil. I'm sure it will be tough for Draco too but he's going to work on it. You can do that right?"</p><p>"Harry...have I been Confunded? This is Malfoy! What the hell have I missed?" Ron spluttered in disbelief. </p><p>"Look Ron...I know it's a shock, it shocked me at first, but we've decided we want to see where this goes between us. I need you to be ok with that." Harry explained. </p><p>Draco raised an eyebrow. "I should leave you to talk. Owl me later, right?"</p><p>Harry nodded. "Thanks for coming over."</p><p>Draco gave a small smile as he walked to the door. </p><p>"Weasley." He nodded to Ron as he passed. </p><p> </p><p>Harry sipped his coffee and waited for Ron to explode. </p><p>"Harry...how long?" Ron struggled to articulate. </p><p>"Not long. Not really. We hooked up a while ago but it wasn't anything...just...you know. But recently we've hung out more. This morning we talked and decided it was time to be honest with everyone. So that's it." Harry explained. </p><p>"How did you even meet up with him?" </p><p>Harry rolled his green eyes. "Your sister's fault. She invited me out for a drink and ended up meeting up with Blaise, who was out with Draco."</p><p>"I might have known she'd be involved! It's bad enough that she's dating a bloody Slytherin without you joining in! For Merlin's sake Harry! Malfoy? Why him?" Ron was distraught. </p><p>Harry couldn't help the cheeky smirk. "He's nothing like he was at school. He's funny. Not what I thought."</p><p>"Funny? Malfoy? He's...I can't even find the words..."</p><p>"Ron. Please understand something. I didn't go into this lightly. If he wasn't right for me I wouldn't be doing this. I thought long and hard about what this means for me. I decided I deserve to be happy. You have Mione, the baby will be here soon, Ginny and Blaise are showing no signs of imploding like everyone predicted...I love you all, you're my family, but I need more. For me. I need to explore the possibility that Draco could make me happy."</p><p>Ron stared at his best friend. He'd known Harry for nearly 15 years. They'd gone through the hardest of life experiences together. He knew Harry was lonely. Hermione knew it too. They had kissed during the final battle and had been inseparable ever since. Their wedding three years earlier was perfect and Harry grinned all day, but Ron and Hermione knew he felt the sadness of being alone. Coming out was a very difficult decision for Harry but they supported him fully. Now they just wanted him to find his Mr Right and live happily ever after. Ron never for a second thought it could be Draco. Now faced with that possibility he didn't know what to do. He needed Hermione to tell him everything would be ok. He needed to feel the kicking of his baby to make him see that the world hasn't ended. </p><p>"I hope you know what you're doing mate." Ron finally said. </p><p>Harry smiled again and shrugged. "Who does?"</p><p>"Promise me something..."</p><p>"Anything." Harry nodded. </p><p>"This isn't a knee-jerk reaction to the emotion of today..."</p><p>Harry frowned. "Not at all. I promise."</p><p>"Ok."</p><p>"Are you alright? With today, I mean."</p><p>"Yeah. It's a weird day. The thing that upsets me most is that I get sad today but I never knew my parents. They knew me but I don't know them. It's a tough feeling to describe..."</p><p>"I get it. Don't worry about explaining it."</p><p>"I knew you would." Harry grinned. </p><p>Ron hugged his friend and slapped his back. "So we going to get pissed or what?"</p><p>Harry laughed heartily. "Definitely."</p>
