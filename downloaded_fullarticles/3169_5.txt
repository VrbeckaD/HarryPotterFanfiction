    <p>   The blissful peace and quiet of what some would call monotony was something that Remus found himself enjoying and valuing all too often. Life’s quiet moments were the ones he chose to notice, in a harsh comparison to the rest of his memories. It wasn’t like having a life-altering disease was socially crippling or anything, whether your secret was known or not. The next full moon’s looming shadow was beginning to dawn quickly, and by the same time next week would have done its damage to his body once more. Already he had some terrible scars, but could only hope that should he earn any more, they not be on his face. As a teenager, his condition was especially debilitating. Just like any other he wanted to fit in, and he could barely face his reflection in the mirror for fear of seeing just how abnormal he was.</p><p>   Underneath the criss-cross of scar tissue that felt like it covered his entire body, Remus Lupin was very much a normal boy; fluffy brown hair that fell in his face, a pair of kind eyes the color of tree moss, <em> and </em> he was one of the tallest in his class. Every time he looked at himself, he noticed the things he should have liked to change. The markings, obviously. Then he’d notice the slight slouch in which he stood to keep from hitting his head- oh and the nails bitten to the quicks. It was such a nasty habit, but trying to stop seemed like a meaningless effort at this point. But even further beneath all that, down to his heart and dreams even, he was just like anyone else. He was not so audacious as to hope for a family- let alone a partner to grow old with- but he could resign himself to a humble little place of his own. Maybe he’d get a cat?</p><p>   The future was a little hard to focus on when the present was already so hard to get through. Remus was the only one of his kind he knew of, save for the monster that changed him. Every day he was reminded of how alone he was in this struggle by the ease with which the people around him ebbed and flowed. Oh the tides would change every once in a while, but the fish still swam in schools. Besides, he was no fish. He was a shark, with big teeth hidden underneath those comfy sweaters. He deserved the isolation, because it kept them safe. That’s why he’d been homeschooled every year up to this one. It felt like being thrust into society in Vanity Fair or Pride and Prejudice. That was one of his favorites, but he didn’t really tell anyone about that. Not only because it was <em> way </em> too predictable as an Austen fan, but because he kind of didn’t talk to anyone in general. Yes, he was a classic introvert, but he personally felt it was for good reason.</p><p>   That same peace and quiet he had come to appreciate so much enveloped him at this moment. Eyes hidden in his hair, (his mother needed to cut it again,) Remus sat beneath his favorite alder. Although this was his safe haven during the day, it was a firm reminder of his nightmares. No one dared enter these woods for they might be met by the same ferocious animal tearing it to pieces in the past. There was no fear present for his own safety, and that was partly because he felt he was the most dangerous thing out there. As for it being a reminder- well, he just thought it was realistic. There was no such thing as an unspoiled memory, anyway. If he could turn anything bad into something good, it might as well have been the trees. Books originated from trees anyway, didn’t they?</p><p>   Their family didn’t have very much money for a plethora of reasons, so the books he unpacked were all second-rate and beaten up. That didn’t make a lick of difference to him anymore. When he was young, seeing all the other little boys with new clothes and fancy Peechee folders was upsetting, but that soon became the furthest thing from his mind. Once on a trip to the library, he’d read about a man who made sculptures out of matchsticks, another who used chewing gum, and a third that exclusively used dirt. It was the artist that guided the tool, not the other way around. This was inspiring, but it was a comfort and protector against material envy as well, even if he didn’t plan on making an outlandish sculpture anytime soon.</p><p>   He took a deep breath of cool air and let it ruminate in his chest for a moment. This was his last weekend of freedom, and he wanted to savor it. He was dreading Monday morning and the hundreds of eyes that would be on him. He could feel them like bee stings, making his skin itch and lungs contract. He didn’t feel any of that- at least while he was able to relax, let himself enjoy nature, and read. Aside from his studies, this was what he liked to do with his time. The Lupins knew from an early age that their son was going to be lonely, so they’d cultivated his independent interests as best they could. Now a bookworm through and through, it was easy to fit into the recluse stereotype that’d been tacked onto him so barbarically. They were always-</p><p>   “Hey, sorry to interrupt, but I’m a little lost- ‘you know the way to a petrol station?”</p><p>   There was a moment of confusion as Remus realized that he was being spoken to. How had he not noticed him before? A smirk accompanied eyes the color of-  well, headstones came to mind, though it was grim. Together they completed the haughty features of this stranger, whose face was framed by wavy black locks of wind blown hair. He looked like he’d just stepped out of the pages of a punk rock magazine. It was hard to believe he was real. In his eyes, this was Loki, this was Hades, this <em> boy </em> was the epitome of mischief. He started getting his things together as quickly as he could. “No.” Books were shoved in a bag.</p><p>   There was a scoff from the other. “I scare you off that easily?” The black polish on his nails was chipped, worn off of half his fingers. It was only noticeable as he ran his hand through that dark hair. Honestly? Yes, a little bit. What good could come of <em> this </em>?</p><p>   Remus averted his eyes and stood, fastening the buckles on his bag. “I’m not scared of you.” There was a glance from beneath those chestnut bangs.</p><p>   Although he was a little shorter, the confidence exuded in his posture was still enough to intimidate. “Then why’re you off in such a hurry?”</p><p>   He slung his bag over his shoulder and shifted in place. How could he get this guy off his back? All Remus wanted was some time alone to read. “Just follow the river- it leads into town.” Hopefully that would satisfy all of his questions.</p><p>   “Right, uh… thanks.” Clearly, he thought Remus was a little odd, but that hint of a smile seemed to persist nevertheless. It was a little annoying. The guy shouldered a dingy rucksack. “I’ll leave you to Raskolnikov’s quandary.” He just gave a smug little raise of his eyebrows and started on his way.</p><p align="justify">   This made his head jerk up to watch the other go. <em> He </em> was a reader of Dostoevsky? That rough young rogue? Well, he should have known not to judge a book by its cover. Still, it didn’t seem prudent to start getting to know handsome strangers, especially so close to his first day of public school. That, and he’d never really ‘gotten to know’ <em> anyone </em> for that matter. And yet, with the sound of leaves crushing beneath those black boots a small part of Remus hoped to see him again, no matter how unrealistic that was.</p>
