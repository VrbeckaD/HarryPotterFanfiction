<hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Tina stretches and turns over in bed. Despite the hour, she is somehow not tired enough to fall back asleep. Instead she settles against the pillows and watches Newt in the dim moonlight. His hair is a mess of curls, his brow slightly furrowed in sleep, his deep breaths and occasional murmurings loud in the quiet room. She gives in to the urge to brush a curl from his forehead.</p><p class="p1">They have been married only a week, but his features have long been as familiar to her as her own. As has his voice: his easy banter with his creatures; the stubborn push of his words in defending them; the shaking, gentle force of his empathy; and the way joy makes his words tremble.</p><p class="p1">Newt sighs and resettles in his sleep, and Tina breathes out a soft laugh to see the sheets tangle further around him. She has pulled on cotton pajamas, but Newt is still bare, the outlines of several scars visible beneath the cream fabric.</p><p class="p1">His body is not yet as familiar as his face and his voice, but it is becoming so.</p><p class="p1">(They’d both been nervous, not sure where to start.</p><p class="p1"><em>Have you slept here before? </em>she’d asked of the sparse bedroom with its neatly made bed and heavy curtains. They’d hovered in the doorway, Newt tugging at his bowtie as Tina unfastened and pulled off her shoes.</p><p class="p1"><em>Yes. Er, a few times. I think</em>, he’d said, looking a bit lost as he glanced at her.</p><p class="p1">She’d paused, thinking, and reached for him. <em>Take my hand</em>.</p><p class="p1">And she’d drawn them both back to the menagerie and the shed, his touch grounding her with each step.)</p><p class="p1">Tina smiles. The memories from that night are so easy to touch. His trembling, eager hands; her breath stuttering from her lungs; his gasps pressed into her neck; her hand searching out and grasping his.</p><p class="p1">She finds his hand now, resting on the sheets between them. The moonlight glints off the smooth surface of his wedding band. On his palm she sees a scar that she has felt many times as his hand grazed her cheek or brushed over her arm. She pauses a moment, then reaches out to trace it.</p><p class="p1"><em>Tina</em>, he’d whispered gruffly the first time she made a study of his hands and their scars. The heat in his eyes and the press of his pulse against her thumb had felt intimate then. This touch feels even more so now. She hadn’t quite been able to imagine a week ago that they would feel even closer now, when they had been so close already.</p><p class="p1">Her finger moves from his palm to his wrist, tracing the mottled skin of a burn mark that wraps from inner wrist to outer.</p><p class="p1">When had she first noticed his hands?</p><p class="p1">At the docks, perhaps, when he’d touched her hair? Her eyes had been on his, but she had felt the way the touch mirrored everything about him. Hesitant, purposeful, gentle.</p><p class="p1">But no, she thinks, fingers sliding along the back of his hand to his knuckles, it had been earlier. She had seen his hands restrained behind him at MACUSA and had watched them turn white as he’d tried desperately to protect his creatures. <em>They’re not dangerous. They aren’t dangerous. </em>His hands had trembled as he’d watched the floating image of the obscurus, and he had twisted his fingers together nervously in the cell as she’d apologized about his creatures and he’d explained about the little girl in the Sudan. That had been the first time she’d truly seen him. His empathy, and his loneliness.</p><p class="p1">Or perhaps she’d caught a glimpse of it even earlier, when he’d gripped the chair in the apartment and stumbled through an awkward dinner almost silently. Perhaps that was when she’d first wondered if they might be just a little bit similar.</p><p class="p1">She shakes her head.</p><p class="p1">Two years ago, after Paris, he had hidden himself away in his case. After hardly seeing him for two days, she had climbed into the space for the first time since she had been there with him and Leta. His red-rimmed eyes had caught hers, with his hand extended toward her, and had fluttered shut when their skin had touched. She’d imagined it so often, in the months when they’d been separated by the Atlantic. His hands scrawling out the pages of his letters, or even typing the pages of the book she’d kept beside her bed, surrounded by creatures in his case, his clothing a little mussed and his hands sun-tanned and freckled as she always remembered him. (And sometimes, after Queenie had fallen asleep, she’d trace the letters and imagine him reading hers, and wonder what it might be like for his hands to hold hers again, as they had when they’d run from MACUSA. But this time not to catch her, or to pull her along at a run. This time, merely because he wanted to.)</p><p class="p1">Tina breathes out a nearly silent laugh. She’d been so <em>angry</em> at him, and yet so desperate to see him again. She hadn’t let herself imagine, as she’d knelt on the floor beside an unconscious Kama and passed Newt his wand, her dark, hurt, yearning eyes fixed on him, that he had traced the ink of her letters and wondered the same. Had not let herself think that as they knelt beside each other in Flamel’s house, he had also been painfully, blissfully aware of their near and often brushing hands.</p><p class="p1">The rush of tenderness chokes her even now, to remember him dropping his wand in the records room, his fingers fumbling with the photograph from the newspaper.</p><p class="p1">“You can thank the niffler for that one.” Tina blinks and looks up, her thumb resting over a small bite mark at the juncture of his thumb and first finger. “Although it was an accident. I think.” His voice is rough with sleep, his eyes intently fixed on hers.</p><p class="p1">Tina looks down at their hands as they each touch and trace absently.</p><p class="p1">“Are my hands so very interesting?”</p><p class="p1">Tina smiles, teeth digging into her lip.</p><p class="p1">He lifts her hand and his lips brush her knuckles. Then he rests her hand against his chest, his thumb stroking the back of her hand.</p><p class="p1">It has always taken her breath away to see him with his creatures. The way he touches each differently; the language he shares with them as he eases their fears and prepares their food and soothes their injuries, his hands sometimes gentle and sometimes firm, his fingers capable of delicacy or strength, but always kind.</p><p class="p1">“What?” he murmurs, and she realizes that she has been staring.</p><p class="p1">She leans closer to kiss him. Her fingers curl into his chest, and his hand moves from hers to touch her cheek, then her shoulders, her back, pressing her closer.</p><p class="p1">When they break apart, she rests her forehead on his, sighing happily at the way the pads of his fingers graze her skin. She has not answered his question, at least not in speaking, but the words <em>I love you</em> seem so inadequate for the warmth that fills her chest when she looks at him. He closes his eyes, leaning into her, and she knows he understands.</p><p class="p1">They are developing their own silent language. Tina takes his hand, twining their fingers together. She cannot wait to watch it grow.</p><p class="p2"> </p>
