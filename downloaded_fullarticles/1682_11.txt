    <p>I was hiding from the storm; hail, rain, wind, thunder, lighting, ice. I was so close to death going outside would be suicide, my friends couldn't help, we were just ten. I heard someone come in, probably to get away from the storm. They found me.</p><p>He kneeled down and leant out his hand, I slowly moved out from under the pew, towards him and took his hand "What is your name, and what are you doing here?" he asked, I sat down as he stood up "Stephaine Cordato, I'm hiding from the storm, I will die if I go outside, doctor."</p><p>His face changed before speaking again "Stephaine, can I propose something to you?" I looked at him and nodded "My family and I need a maid for our son, he's the same age as you, in return for you accepting, we'll give you somewhere to live, food and clothing as well as send you to any school you wish to attend." I thought about it, I bit my lip and answered.</p><p>"Could I continue going to the same school I currently go to, doctor?" he nodded and smiled before helping me stand, he ended up completely picking me up "That can be arranged, so do you agree?" I held his robe and he carried me and nodded "Yes doctor." <br/> <br/>He was about to walk out of the church when he rethought it "I am not going to risk taking you out there Stephaine,do you mind appreciation?" I shook my head and hid myself in his robe, as I felt the pull of being sucked through a tube, before breathing again, and evening out my breaths. I could hear someone, running "Are you alright? Who are you holding, Lucius?" I slowly poked my head out, from where I was hiding. "Um, Hello?" I said meekly, at the well dressed woman who's face showed nothing but worry.</p><p>"Her name's Stephaine Cordato, she's the same age as Draco, I'll explain the rest later." He said placing me down on the sofa, I wasn't by any means small for my age, but just very ill. He soon returned to take me to my room, I told him I felt fine to walk, surprisingly I manged to walk up to the third floor. I remember begin told to sleep and that I could have something to eat once I woke up before I fell into a subconscious state of sleep.</p><p>I woke up to the feeling of someone looking at me, I opened my eyes and screamed. Trying to get away from the bony, elf-like creature that was looking at me, unblinking. Within seconds three people are in the room, as I'm huddled with the duvet, reciting very prayer I know, hoping that thing would go away. "Stephaine what's wrong?" my eyes snaped open "Is it gone?" I ask immediately, when I got a nod in return I actually looked at them, Lucius was tall with long blonde hair, wearing mostly black, the woman beside him has long wavy black hair that was tied back and was wearing a light green dress, while a boy, about my age, was standing between them, wearing a pale dress, with his hair obstructing part of his face, probably wondering who on earth I am. "Draco, stay with her, don't ask questions that are intrusive." Is what i heard Lucius say.</p><p>"What's your name?" Draco asked me, sitting on the plush bench in my room "Stephane Cordato, your father found me last night, I think- How long was I asleep for?" I said looking at him, he sighed and told me that I'd been sleeping for a week, <em>Oh, longest time I'd been asleep, I feel a lot better though</em> "Sorry if I seem rude, I'm not used to other children here, my family aren't well liked my many." I looked at him and nodded "I didn't think you were rude at all, anyway." He smiled and got up "You got a few rather big things sent to you, I'll leave so you can get dressed." He said before walking out of the room and standing by the wall as I got into a simple while the top and black skirt with white tights and red shoes.</p><p>Walking out he took me downstairs to the small wooden hut, in the back garden, with a swing and some other thing that I couldn't see from where we were. "Ooo Mat has one of these, although his is made of glass!" I said instantly, "Who's Mat?" I was asked by all three, my face red and looked at my plate<em> Ooo, pancakes!</em> "He's one of the friends, along with Nathan, Jason, Chris..."I faded out at the looks I was getting, especially from the woman, who I'd ducted was Draco mother and therefore Lucius wife "You don't have any friends that are girls?" She asked as if every girl was meant to have female friends "No, I don't see why I should, I find the girls in my class highly annoying and insensitive as well as rude and ignorant." She looked taken back but at least I didn't get questioned on my friends anymore</p><p>After breakfast I asked if I could stay outside for awhile, I spent the hour or so just laying on the soft grass, I couldn't see any bugs, flies, or any garden animals anywhere, I couldn't even see ants! Staring up at the clouds I smiled, until I felt someone walk behind me, sitting up and turned around to see Lucius, he smiled maybe he was looking for me? "Stephaine, could you follow me, you can come back outside after." I got up, went to brush off grass off my skirt to see none "My wife, Narcissa didn't like getting grass on her, and still doesn't, and my family never liked incests, the most you'll see here are bees." I nodded and followed him into a lit room, with candles that emit blue and green flames "Copper and Barium." I mumbled under my breath as I looked around "Excuse me?" I looked at him and shook my head "I was just mumbling about the flame colours."</p><p>He smiled and told me to sit down, I did I nearly fell into the chair, "Sorry, doctor" I mumbled after he helped me sit down "Don't be, Draco does the same thing." The talk was about me being there and my role as a maid, which soon went on to my going to school "Which school did you go, exactly Stephine?" I closed my eyes as I prepared the same thing I say everything I get asked this, taking a deep breath.</p><p>"I used to go to Ilvenmorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, they had a muggle counterpart, as America had no Statute of Secretary as MACUSA realised how useful muggles knowing the magical community was, although not everyone liked the idea, it wa s erased after Britain's Wizarding War, the muggles that go, mostly learn theory and how magic is actually used along with our normal muggle education. It's mainly hidden by a cloud, although some of the students can't see it, I can as well as every other Magical school there is, I'm sure, the only girl I liked was Georgina Parkinson, she was the only one that was down-to-earth, and Matthew Patrick and Nathan Smith, Jason and Chris are two muggle boys, when we all met, we all made friends quickly, I was about to start my 'first year' as my birthday was two weeks ago, doctor."</p><p>He nodded, although clearly surprised "I'm happy to let you go back, as there's very little chance I could get you into Hogwarts, but I have two questions. Firstly, how would we get you to Ilvenmorny, and secondly why do they let you take magical classes?"</p><p>"The easiest way to get me to school would be to let me go to either Nathan's or Mat's a week before the start of school, and well I'd have to show you, but it's difficult, doctor" I explained Lucius seemed to understand "Okay, then show me." I stand up and look at him "You're going to need to fire a spell at me, I actually have no idea how I can do this, no one does, but it's really cool." He looked shocked but fired Aguamenti, as soon as the spell hit my chest, it shrunk into a small version of its wand movement in see-through shell, and floated I held it in my hand I threw it up into the air and jumped to receive it, as they failed to adhere to laws of gravity. "That's why, I can stop spell suddenly, turning them into these, the teachers at school believe that in theory I should be protected against every spell, but they've told me not to try to find out myself, doctor." With that, he told me he'd look into getting me to one of my friends in a week and that I could go back outside.</p><p>When I opened the door and stepped on the grass I saw Narcissa sitting on a chair, I stopped mid-step as she turned around, I wasn't going to lie, she scared me. "Oh hello Stephine, I was actually wondering if I could ask you few questions, just to get to know you?" I swallowed and nodded, holding my arm behind my back before walking towards the table and sitting down in front of her.</p><p>"What takes up too much of your time?" I thought about it, before smiling, Maybe this could be fun "I'd say homework, I spend normally about two hours on one pice of homework.", she smiled and most likely made a mental note of my answer, "Okay, what’s your favourite drink?" I spent a long time thinking, before answering with mint tea. About twenty minuets later, she began to ask more personal questions "What are three of the most significant numbers in your life?"<br/>I didn't have to think, "393." she smiled and actually wrote it down a piece of paper! "What’s the most immature thing that you do?" I though for awhile "I still have a money box." she took a deep breath and asked me, something I'd never thought I'd get asked, "What keeps you up at night?" I paused and looked down, before answering the question "Memories." By that point, it was lunch time, so we both stayed sitting down, as that thing came back, I jumped and hid behind her "They scare me." I said trying to get as far away from them as possible.</p><p>"Stephaine, are you alright?" Lucius asked as I slowly sat down normally and returned to where I was sitting."Lucius, I think we should keep the house elves away from her, she has some sort of fear around them." He nodded as Draco sat next to me, and held my hand. I smiled at him and lunch went on with out drama."Hey Steph, what odd smell do you really enjoy?" I looked at Draco and blinked Why does he want to know? "Umm, the smell of Sharpies, there these inky pens that have this toxic smell, but I love it, I have a packet of them, there mostly colours, although I have gold, sliver and the metallic ones as well."</p><p>Walking into my room, I saw eight dresses laid out on the bed, with a note on top, saying that I could wear the dresses if I wanted, but when I actually start working, I should wear the blue and white maid dress thing or anything similar. Most probably Draco chose the colours, well it makes sense. At that moment I heard a someone tap my bedroom door, I slowly walked up to it and opened it, to see Draco. Speak of the devil and thou shall appear "Yes?" he looked down before asking if he could talk to me, For someone I'm working for, he does seem to be more afraid of me. "Hey, Draco what's wrong? I know somethings up with you." He carefully sat on the bench and looked right at me "Can I trust you, to keep a secret, don't tell you friends, or any other family you might have, don't tell a soul, can I trust you to do that?" I sat in front of him, and held his hand, "Draco, you can trust me with any secret, honestly." He took a deep breath before beginning his explanation.</p><p>"Stephaine, you know how I look like one of those dolls that everyone loves and wants, or like anime girls that many people wish were real." I nodded and stayed holding his hand, he didn't seem to mind so I didn't move "Well, it's because I'm a GlassDoll, I'm like a veela, but I can crack, break, and snap as well as shatter, if people look closely enough, they can see a literal layer of glass on my skin and eyes, but I can also bleed, cry, bruise an follow normal human biological process, but because Dolls and Glass in magical world are submissive creatures, yes they are two different magical creatures, the Blacks were Dolls and the Malfoy's were Glass. Their bodies work a lot like betas, well you can imagine what I could get put through at school, I'm practically a toy for people to use at there own will, not caring how I feel about it, because I'll just react accordingly to what's begin done to me. Sometimes, I'm even afraid of my own family, or my friends." He finished, I was shocked and sat next to him, running my hand through his hair "Draco, you're better than that, your better than to let people use you, I've only know you for today, but I can already see that Draco, don't be so scared and if anything helps, you can be assured that I'll never do anything to you." He looked at me and wrapped his arms around me, "Steph? C-can I stay with you tonight?" He whispered looking at me, his eyes shorn with fear and something else, something I couldn't place, but it looked raw, bear completely out, exposed, I nodded immediately, it was then that I could have sworn that I saw red marks on his skin, and handprints on his neck.</p><p>"Two weeks ago, we were at a party for a friend's birthday, someone, took me." Was all he gave me as an explanation, I stayed with him the whole day.</p>
