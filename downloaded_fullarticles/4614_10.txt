  <em>Harry’s retirement cottage, Saturday, 31 January 2099</em>
</p><p>Harry looked around, and realised that he was happy. The simplicity of that emotion was a surprise, and he took a moment to just experience it. This was safe. This was comforting. This was <em>his Retreat</em>.</p><p>In his younger years, he had thought the very custom of a Retreat absurd. He had thought it superannuated and sexist and sad. If a man didn't wish to retire, then he shouldn't. If he did want to retire, then what was wrong with staying in the house he lived in? Leaving every morning to spend the day somewhere else had seemed such a pathetic mockery of working life. But now he looked at the soft dragonhide couches and the diricawl rugs -- which didn't match the couches or each other -- with a great deal of satisfaction. This was his place, and the first place in his entire life he could truly call his own.</p><p>The protected courtyard had been set up for the house-wakening ceremony. He didn't need the extra magic from his friends to raise the wards, of course, but he found himself wanting to share the moment with the people he loved. It was a chance to relax, a chance to show off, and a chance to be himself. Not even the disapproval of his wife was going to take this away from him.</p><p>Ginny herself stood in the courtyard, stiff and solemn, glaring up at the decorations. By convention, this was the first time she had seen the place, and she would not return until it came time to strip everything away again after his death. It was the one thing Harry hadn’t been forced to fight for, even though Ginny had been visibly unhappy. Retreats were a tradition that even the lightest and most progressive of families respected. Molly had certainly never invaded Arthur's shed without explicit permission, and Ginny bowed to that convention.</p><p>Ginny whirled when he stepped out, gesturing to the middle of the courtyard. “Couldn't you have put your foot down about the... the... that?”</p><p>Harry grinned at the 'that' – a fountain made of cake. Layers of vanilla and strawberry and chocolate and pumpkin and mint, reaching from the floor to all the way to his shoulder. Over them all, founts of fudge and caramel and butterbeer cascaded from one level to the next. Charmed chocolate and marzipan and sugar rocks clinked into each other with the sound of bells. It was absurd and wonderful and ridiculously indulgent.</p><p>“It was a gift from Ron, Ginny. It would have hurt his feelings if I'd refused it,” said Harry.</p><p>Ginny moved he arms to her hips. “We both know the only thing it would have hurt was his stomach, because he would have eaten the whole thing by himself. In fact, I wouldn’t be in the least surprised if that’s what Ron had intended in the first place.”</p><p>“Oi, oi! Who's using my name as a hex, then?” called Ron.</p><p>Harry moved to the entrance to rescue some further trays of food from him. From how harassed Hermione was looking it wasn’t the first time they’d nearly come to disaster.</p><p>Ron walked over to the fountain and sighed in deep satisfaction. “You can’t be saying anything bad about the cake. That’s against some sort of rule, that is. I mean, that’s the King of all cakes. You can’t just go around criticising a king.”</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes and then deliberately turned her back on Ron to re-arrange the already adequately arranged trays.</p><p>“Hi Hermione, Ron. Where are Rose and Hugo?” asked Harry.</p><p>“They got waylaid by your own kids and conscripted into bringing through more tables,” replied Hermione, accepting a hug and kiss from Harry now that her hands were empty.</p><p>“More tables?” asked Ginny. “How are we going to fit <em>more</em> tables anywhere? Don’t you think you’ve over catered a bit?”</p><p>Harry refrained from pointing out he hadn’t catered anything, and that it would be ungracious in the extreme to refuse the offerings his guests brought with them. Ginny already knew that.</p><p>“And another thing,” continued Ginny, swinging around to face Harry again. “I thought we agreed you wouldn't have fairy lights at events.”</p><p>“I like them,” said Harry calmly. “In fact, I'm considering keeping them up permanently. They're friendly.”</p><p>“Harry,” said Ginny. “Please, try to be a little serious. What will people think of you? This whole place looks like you’re throwing a children's party.”</p><p>Harry replied, “They aren’t going to think anything of me. Everyone coming already knows exactly who I am.”</p><p>“You have your position—“ started Ginny.</p><p>Harry immediately cut her off. “No I don’t. Not anymore, and definitely not here. These are our friends and family, Ginny. If any one of them still expects me to be the next coming of Merlin, then it’s about time they learnt better anyway.”</p><p>Ginny didn’t look mollified. “It will get out into the papers, and you know it will. You can’t afford this. In the current situation –”</p><p>“Oh, not that again,” groaned Ron.</p><p>“Oh, yes, this again!” said Ginny, still looking at Harry and pretending Ron wasn’t there. “You <em>know</em> how scared people are getting. What possessed you to have a house-wakening of all things?”</p><p>Harry closed his eyes and recited the alphabet backwards in Elder Futhark. “Firstly, house-wakening is just a name. No-one has ever actually tried to waken a living land at one of these things. 'Everyone' knows that. Secondly, I didn’t fight my entire life just to give into bigotry at my age! There's nothing wrong with living lands.”</p><p>“It isn’t bigotry, Harry!” hissed Ginny. “If there’s nothing wrong with them, then why are they getting stronger while places like the Redlands have been robbed of magic?”</p><p>Hermione sounded as impatient as Ron with the argument when she interrupted. “They aren’t getting stronger. They just aren’t failng as quickly. They have higher intrinsic levels of magic, so they have more protection against the information dense wireless technology the muggles are using these days. In fact, the main reason we are so exposed at the moment is because all the lands orphaned during the Second Voldemort War are now reaching the end of their Sleeping Beauty centuries, and are no longer living. We <em>should</em> be trying to waken the land. If we had more of them around, we’d be better off.”</p><p>The table bearing brigade had arrived during the speech, and James said in his ‘official comforting the masses’ tone, “the ministry hasn’t found any evidence that the problems have anything to do with the actions of muggles.”</p><p>That immediately raised Hermione’s hackles. “The ministry, present company excluded, are a bunch of idiots. They just can’t bring themselves to believe that the muggles have finally become stronger than us.”</p><p>Harry could see the whole evening in jeopardy, and spoke to keep things calm. “Perhaps the ministry wants to wait until they have a solution before they announce anything. You have to admit, Hermione, there are still people around who would use it as an excuse to speak out against muggles and muggleborns. The last thing we want is to raise new tensions in that direction.”</p><p>“Well, there is that,” she replied.</p><p>Harry hurried to start giving directions on table placement to prevent the conversation from restarting. It seemed to work, and by the time the last of the guests had arrived, everyone was once again cheerful, or at least doing a convincing job of acting like it.</p><p>Harry probably should have remembered that nothing ever went his way. He felt the shift, but he refused to believe it. Everyone knew that the number of people present put stress on the magic of a place, but even Ginny had been worried about the appearances of things, not about the risk they were running. He had powered the wards personally, and Harry’s magic did not fail.</p><p>But within minutes, it was too obvious to deny. Harry’s magic <em>was</em> failing, disappearing like water into a sinkhole.</p><p>Harry had heard this process described, and he was ashamed to realise how dismissive he’d been of the experience. He’d imagined it to be like going through Thief’s Downfall. Disorientating and embarrassing certainly, depending on how much one relied on support spells, warming charms, glamours and the like. But ultimately harmless. After all, Harry went without magic every time he stepped into the muggle world.</p><p>He’d underestimated how much difference it made when the process was involuntary. He’d underestimated just how much of his every day surroundings depended on magic. He underestimated how much it would hurt. Chairs and tables cracked and crashed as they took full weight for the very first time. Winter howled in through the missing barriers. Streamers fell from the air like dying swarms of birds.</p><p>Harry and the more sensible of his guests froze in place. Spells would just make things worse and there was nothing to do but wait for it all to finish and settle in a new equilibrium. In the chaos and the screaming and the fear, the only thing Harry found himself paying any attention to was the cake. The ‘That’, the ridiculous every-colour every-flavour fountain cake. Bereft of their support, the layers slid off one by one to drown in the growing pool of muddy sauce, like a caricature of a murder scene. At last, the cake simply gave way, and collapsed into a mess of colours.</p><p>Harry took a deep breath, and judged it finally over.</p><p>There would be no more celebrations after this. After a brief census, Harry was reassured that his guests were more shocked than injured. From habit borne of a lifetime of crisis management, Harry calmed them all down and arranged transport for them back to a still magical environment. Hermione cast an apologetic look over her shoulder as she left, but Harry waved her off. She had to get Ron home, and it wouldn’t be safe to start the clean up here without magic. Eventually, it was just Harry and Ginny left, and Harry had nothing left to take his mind off things.</p><p>Harry stooped to pick up a fragile sphere that still tried to glow. He blew on it, hoping that at least this one little living thing would survive. For a brief moment, the light swelled and Harry hoped… but it faded away just as quickly. His second breath had less effect, and his third had none at all. It went dead in his hands, and he laid it carefully back on the ground to rest amongst its brethren.</p><p>He looked up to find Ginny glaring at him, her hair a fright of frizzled whiteness after the collapse of her glamour charms. “I told you not to have fairy lights. Now look what you’ve done.”</p><p>Harry bit down hard enough on his lip to draw blood, then followed Ginny as they apparated back to their house. His Retreat was gone, and nothing he could do now would change that.</p>
