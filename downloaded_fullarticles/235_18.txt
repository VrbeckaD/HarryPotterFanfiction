    <p>“Hello, Leta. This is a surprise.” Of course, Albus was lying. He knew full well that Leta Lestrange accompanied Theseus and his buddies on this not-so-friendly call to Hogwarts.</p><p>Taking her hand away from where she had been tracing her and Newt’s initials, reminiscing on times long gone, Leta quickly closed the desk and stood up. “Finding me in a classroom? Was I such a bad student?”</p><p>“On the contrary,” Albus took a step toward her as she took one away, “you were one of my cleverest.”</p><p>Quickly and angrily, Leta shot back “I said bad, not stupid.” Sighing, she gave him a sad smile after that. “Don’t bother answering. I know you never liked me.”</p><p>Albus shook his head and spoke entreatingly. “I never thought you bad.”</p><p>“You were alone then.” Leta took a few steps toward the exit, and Albus knew he was missing his window to get his point across. </p><p>“Leta, I know how painful the rumours about your brother Corvus must be for you--”</p><p>Leta spun around angrily, her exit plans temporarily forgotten. “No, you don’t. Not unless you had a brother who died too.”</p><p>“In my case, it was my sister.” Albus’s voice was quiet, but strong and earnest. Lena didn’t doubt his sincerity. </p><p>“Did you love her?”</p><p>Albus walked forward until he was only two steps in front of Lena. “Not as well as I should have done.” Holding her gaze with his for a long moment, Albus desperately tried to convey his warning. “It is never too late to free yourself. Regret is my constant companion. Do not let it become yours.” </p><p>Leta scoffed, but looked hopeful beneath everything. “Free myself? And how do you suggest I do that?”</p><p>“I’ve heard confiding in another works wonders.”</p><p>“You want me to confess?” Leta asked angrily, and Albus did not fail to notice her subconscious changing of the word ‘confide.’ “What, to you? While you sit here, the superior coward?”</p><p>“I just want a better life for you than the one you are giving yourself, Leta.”</p><p>Leta looked away, nearly crying. Suddenly she turned back and fixed him with a stare. “I will if you will.”</p><p>“What?” Albus was shocked.</p><p>“If you confess, so will I. Otherwise I’m taking my secret to as early a grave as I can manage without bringing shame on my precious family name.”</p><p>Albus closed his eyes, frightened of his secret, of himself. “I cannot.”</p><p>Lena tried not to let herself think about the regret she felt in that moment, and instead scoffed and said “Then goodbye.”</p><p>She made it to the door and was turning the handle when she heard a strained voice behind her say “Leta, wait.”</p><p>She turned around, not sure what to expect, but an Albus Dumbledore sitting with his head in his hands and shoulders hunched was not it. And she certainly didn’t expect his next words. </p><p>“I killed her. I killed my sister.”</p><p>“Wh-what?” Leta choked out. </p><p>Albus looked up at her with pained eyes and a heavy heart. “I got in a fight with my brother, and it came to drawn wands. My spells mixed with Gellert’s,” Leta’s face showed immense surprise at that, “and his mixed with Aberforth’s and somewhere in there… it happened.”</p><p>He looked up at Leta, gripping the edge of the desk he was leaning against like it was a lifeline. “I wake up every night in a cold sweat reliving that moment. Because I killed her. Even if it wasn’t my spell that struck the death bell, it was my arrogance, my neglect, my temper, my love for Gellert and our obsession with power…”</p><p>“You wanted a confession, Leta? I killed my sister. How’s that?” Albus spoke the last words with defiance and pain, willing her to condemn him with the vehemence he deserved. He turned around, putting his back toward her, and waited to hear either the muttered spell or the slamming of the door. Instead, he felt a small hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Turning around gently, he found himself looking down into the dark and understanding eyes of Leta. “How do you live with it? How do we live with what we’ve done?”</p><p>“We?” Albus watched her with confusion. Instead of the disgust in her eyes that he expected, he saw only a mirror image of his own. Understanding, pain, regret, every unspoken secret and burden that he carried within himself.</p><p>Leta took a half step back and visibly steeled herself. “Yes, we. I killed my brother.” </p><p>Albus hardly dared to breathe.</p><p>“I- I was tired of his crying so I switched him with a quiet baby. His life raft went down. Mine didn’t.”</p><p>She took a hold of Albus’s hand and squeezed it tightly. “I didn’t mean to.”</p><p>He reached up to wipe a tear from her cheek. “I know.”</p><p>“We’re monsters.” Her voice was factual, not questioning.</p><p>“Yes.” His was the same.</p><p>“So what do we do?”</p><p>Albus gave a wet chuckle. “Beyond wallowing in self pity I don’t have much of a plan.”</p><p>She smiled a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Yeah. Mind if I join you some time?”</p><p>“Join me?”</p><p>“For wallowing. I think I could use a good wallow.”</p><p>“Yes. Yes, I think that would be amenable. I believe you know where I live,” he gestured to the building around them.</p><p>This time her smile touched at the corners of her eyes. “I’ll bring the booze.”</p><p>“I’ve no doubt you will, Leta. No doubt at all.”</p><p>The door banged open then and Theseus came in. “Leta, there you are!”</p><p>He pulled up short as he saw Leta take hasty steps away from Albus, who she had been far closer to than was appropriate in Theseus’s mind. Leta silently made her way toward the door while Theseus and Albus had a stare down.</p><p>“Theseus,” Albus broke the silence with a jovial smile and a wink.</p><p>Theseus’s hand twitched for his wand, but his desire to live kept it firmly in its sheath. He knew better than to goad Albus Dumbledore into a fight. Getting out a terse “Albus,” Theseus stalked after Leta and left the room.</p>
