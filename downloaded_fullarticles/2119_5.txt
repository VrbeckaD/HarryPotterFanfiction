    <p>It had been three years since the end of the war. Hermione Granger only allowed herself a few moments now and then to think about her old schoolmates, at least the ones she didn’t see often. Anything more than a few minutes at a time was too much.</p><p>She began her day reading the paper and stumbled across the engagement of Pansy Parkinson to the heir to some large company. Hermione had always greatly disliked Pansy, but feeling nostalgic she allowed her mind to wander to an interaction in their third year.</p><p> </p><p>Pansy handed Hermione a sealed letter.</p><p>“What’s this about?” Hermione took the envelope suspicious.</p><p>Pansy smiled wickedly, “Just a little note for you. He didn’t want me to tell you who it was from.”</p><p>Hermione took the letter to the empty common room and cast several spells over it to see what malicious hex was on it when nothing happened she carefully opened the letter and read.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I’m sorry. I knew you’d never take this from me so I told pansy it was hexed so she’d give it to you without opening it. You probably won’t believe me but I am sorry. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>D.M. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It threw her, so much so that she didn’t mention it to anyone. Ever.</p><p>Hermione knew what he was talking about, hell everyone in school probably knew by then that he’d called her a “mudblood” and she’d decked him for it.</p><p>She took the apology as some sort of game, but at the same time, he’d never called her that again. And other encounters had shown he’d changed.</p><p>Later on, the term didn’t bother her, but when she was very young it hurt her deeply.</p><p>She tried so hard to prove her worth at school that to be taken down for something that didn’t affect her work and wasn’t something she should be ashamed of. Her parents were good people, and magical blood didn’t change that.</p><p>There was absolutely zero love lost between herself and Pansy, but the idea floated through her mind that she hadn’t heard anything about Malfoy in years. He’d been cleared of charges after the war when Harry had spoken on behalf of Draco and his mother but slipped out of the spotlight unlike many of the rest of them.</p><p>She finished her cup of tea and finished getting ready for work for the day.                   </p><p>Memories of the past were best left till later.</p>
