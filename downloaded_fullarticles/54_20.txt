    <p>As the sun rose in the east, signalling the beginning of a new morning within the Enchanted Forest, all was calm and all was quiet. It was the perfect setting for a new young mother and her newborn baby to get to know one another. Mallory Mills, fiancée of Prince Charles of a wealthy kingdom not far from her own, lay peacefully upon her bed, inhaling the fresh spring air coming through the open door to the balcony in front of her.</p><p>Mallory had never thought that she would have anything like this. A soon-to-be husband, a child born only a few week before the wedding, a lovely castle to live in. For the longest time she had thought herself to be cursed - and perhaps she was, but her life was turning out just fine regardless. Soon she would be royalty, and her sister and parents would no longer be able to speak ill of her again.</p><p>She had longed for this life or as long as she could remember, and finally it was happening. She was to be married tomorrow at early noon, and the thought of it caused happiness and excitement to bubble in her kind heart. Her gaze shifted over the crib her child, Harry, was sleeping peacefully in. Such an adorable child he had turned out to be with his father's dark, raven hair and mother's warm green eyes. She could only hope that she'd be able to raise him properly unlike her parents and how they had raised her.</p><p>Tomorrow, she would no longer be the miller's youngest daughter - she would be the beloved prince's loyal and beloved wife. The idea of it was exhilarating.</p><p>"Do not think so much, love. You mustn't give yourself a headache so early in the morning," Charles speaks from beside her lovingly, stroking thin strands of her long, blonde hair. Mallory smiles warmly as she closes her eyes, enjoying the soothing sound of her love's calm and quiet breathing. "Mother and Father wish to dine with us this morning, it would be wise that we rise now before Harry wakes and requires our attention."</p><p>She nods along tiredly, a small yawn escaping her as she finally sits up.</p><p>It was important to keep up a good impression with the current king and queen of the kingdom, as they could easily deny her the right to marry their son and throw her and her child to the dirt. It was a miracle that they had approved to begin with - and what convinced them was the impossible tasks she had completed just to prove herself to them. She simply could not let that go to waste now.</p><p>As if he had heard them and was feeling mischievous, Harry awoke and began to cry - tiny hands rubbing at his adorably large eyes to wipe his own sleepiness away. Mallory chuckles quietly as she rises from the bed and shuffles over to her precious baby, cooing comfortingly as the young lad sniffles and whines when she picked him up and held him to her warm chest. The baby ceases his crying and cuddles into his mother's chest happily.</p><p>"I shall call the maid to change and dress him, love. You will have plenty of time to hold and care for him after we eat." Then the maid entered and the young one was handed over to the busy but caring woman. Only after Mallory gave the woman a protective warning about handling her child would she leave to get ready for the day ahead of her. It was to be filled with more fittings and etiquette lessons for when the big dinner with their guests would arise. That was the only downside to this new life - she hardly had any time to herself.</p><p>At least they had allowed her time to spend time with Harry after each meal, she would have gone mad if they hadn't. To not see her child for a few hours a day would be torture for her, and it was the queen's understanding and mercy that allowed her such a privilege.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> It was with a heavy and rather guilty heart that the Blue Fairy flew into the opened balcony window of the room she knew the child she needed would be in. This was not something she wanted to do, but it had to be done. Who knows what the child's mother would do to him once she realized just how powerful she truly was? The child was not safe - and besides, she had a wish to fulfill and this child fit the criteria perfectly.</p><p>As much as she was kind she was also loyal to her word. She had owed an old and wise wizard from another realm a favour and he had used it up - asking to be brought a child with rather specific looks. Harry was the first child to come to mind, the only in fact - she would kill two birds with one stone, as the humans sometimes said.</p><p>Blue truly did not want to hurt Mallory in this way, for she knew that the woman’s life had never been easy from the start and this would be like ripping a part of her heart away from her, but it had to be done. The child would only suffer under the care of a woman born with such a monstrous curse.</p><p>”It is in the child’s best interests...” Blue mumbled to herself as her heart gave a painful tug and she waved her wand over the small bundle sleeping in his crib. “it’s for the best and nothing more.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><div class="WI9k4c">
  <p>The first meal of the day had gone by slowly yet uneventfully. Mallory’s future mother-in-law had expressed her growing fondness for her the woman who had captured her son’s heart and the grandson she now had. The king, although a bit more critical about the fact that their grandson was technically a bastard, had agreed over all. Mallory had felt great relief at this news.</p>
  <p>It wasn’t until they were preparing to depart for their separate duties that the quiet morning was rather abruptly interrupted. Guards rushed into the room, standing in front of them as of to protect them.</p>
  <p>”My king, there is an intruder in the castle!” one of them spoke, making Mallory gasp in fear as her first thought went to Harry. It was with trembling hands that she placed down the saucer of tea she had been holding to her lips.</p>
  <p>In the span of seconds, a cloaked figure came running into the dining hall holding what looked to be a dagger. Mallory clings to Charles fearfully as the figure manages to take out one of the guards surrounding them.</p>
  <p>”Worry not, my love, the guards will keep us–“ silence. The hall became silent as the figure had launched themselves at the prince and stabbed him through the heart. Blood hushed out of Charles’ mouth as he keeled over, the life dimming from his eyes.</p>
  <p>What happened next was a blur in Mallory’s widened eyes as she held her dying lover to her chest, shock coursing through her. Her mind was slow to process everything as she stared down at Charles’ now bloodied clothing and her now trembling hands, covered in blood. </p>
  <p>It wasn’t until a shaky hand was placed delicately upon her shoulder that she looked up. The king and queen were kneeling beside her, taking in the sight of their now dead son and their would-have-been daughter-in-law. Pain was evident in their eyes, and she was sure that her own eyes reflected the same.</p>
  <p>”Find the one who did this,” the queen spoke quietly, however the anger and grief was clear. “Find the one who has done this and make them pay!” </p>
  <p>The guards were hasty in their retreat from the now silent dining hall, eager to deliver justice to the now missing criminal that dared to assassinate the future king of their kingdom.</p>
  <p>Two more guards, when given permission, carried Charles’ corpse out of sight. Mallory felt her heart tightening in pain as she sobbed quietly, despite knowing how much the king and queen would disapprove of her showing such emotion out of the confines of her rooms.</p>
  <p>There was no scolding, however. “Come dear,” Queen Priscilla voiced out shakily, “your child, my grandson, needs you now more than ever - if he is to be the future king one day.” Mallory did not quite understand, for now that Charles was dead she was sure she and her baby boy would be tossed back into the pit of commoners she once resided in.</p>
  <p> “You have worked hard to earn our respect and love, child.” King Maximus spoke kindly, almost fondly despite the gruffness of his voice. “Our son chose well, even if we had not approved of him marrying a commoner at first. He would wish you to continue in his absence, that I am certain.”</p>
  <p>Mallory nodded, now understanding the implications. It was more than likely that the royal family would adopt her, therefore making her their only heir. This did not excite her as much as it would have in her younger years, she found as a her heart gave another painful tug.</p>
  <p>It was in silence that the family made their way to Mallory’s rooms. The king and queen, she knew, would later grieve in silence for their lost child. A royal’s grief was not to be seen by those that depend on them.</p>
  <p>When a guard stationed in front of the room opened the door, Mallory’s eyes widened and her chest swelled with anger and a great sense of loss. “Harry!”</p>
  <p>She ran towards the now empty crib. She checked for blood but there was none. Her body trembled as she grinned the bars to the elegant crib tightly. Looking out the window she saw a glimpse of a blue light carrying a baby away from the palace - her baby. Her Harry.</p>
  <p>Anger clouded her thoughts, twisted her heart until she felt numb. She screamed out in agony as the Bue Fairy carried her baby away to a place she could not find. <br/><br/></p>
  <hr/>
  <p><br/>Many years later, with a now hardened heart and a desire for what she had lost, Mallory was now queen. This title, however, was not what she was known as to the people within the Enchanted Forest.</p>
  <p>Her power from that wretched day on had grown and grown. A darkness she could not describe or identify had clouded over her, had infected her heart and caused her to hurt those that displeased her with her magic. </p>
  <p>She had become the Enchantress, a woman whose power rivalled Rumplestiltskin’s. She was known for helping those in need in exchange for favours that could not be ignored. No one could say exactly why she didn’t take anything valuable from people, but they did not care to know either.</p>
  <p>Mallory had spent years plotting and researching anything that could link to her lost child’s whereabouts. The only information she had gathered on his whereabouts, however, was that he was in some other world where magic and time worked differently. How differently, she didn’t know.</p>
  <p>Was her son an old, aged and weathered man now? Or was he still young? She wished she knew, for perhaps it would ease her worries.</p>
  <p>Her focus had then shifted to realm travelling, something she was not capable of yet knew existed. There was that dark curse Regina was currently attempting to get her hands on, but that was too costly and unobtainable for her.</p>
  <p>These obstacles mattered not, of course. She was going to find her child, even if it meant destroying everyone else’s happily ever afters as a result.</p>
