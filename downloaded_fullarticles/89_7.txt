    <p>Ben sat silently through most of the sorting, politely clapping while the rest of his house whooped and cheered for each new Slytherin. It wasn’t that it wasn’t exciting, or fun— it was. The problem is that when you have three uncles and one aunt at the head table, there’s always a niggling fear that they might report back a lapse in manners to his mother, and he was trying to postpone the inevitable howler for as long as he possibly could. </p>
<p>Who was he kidding? If his first year was any indication, he probably wasn’t going to last a week.</p>
<p>The crowd of first years seemed to be about half the size as when the evening had started, and Ben’s mind was drifting to the feast that was about to start when Hux’s voice brought his attention away from thoughts of food.</p>
<p>“What kind of name is <em> Johnson </em>?”</p>
<p>Ben rolled his eyes at the sound of Hux’s disdain. “It’s a muggle name, Hux.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t until he saw his housemate’s eyes light up with cruel interest that he realized his mistake. Hux was usually alright, but like some wizards who had hardly stepped foot out of the wizarding world, he tended to have a hang-up over blood status.</p>
<p>When the redhead turned eagerly toward the ceremony, Ben caught Poe’s eye across the table, a sympathetic grimace on his face when he saw Ben’s unease. He swallowed thickly and turned to the poor first-year student he had unintentionally put in Hux’s line of fire.</p>
<p>Walking toward Professor Holdo for a turn with the sorting hat was a small little thing, her hair pulled up into three buns arranged vertically, swinging back and forth as her wide eyes took in the hall, darting up toward the ceiling as if she’d never seen magic before.</p>
<p>“Definitely a muggle-born,” Hux murmured low enough for his friends’ ears only.</p>
<p>Kriff. Maybe he deserved that howler. </p>
<p>“Cute though,” Poe voices, as if that would suddenly change Hux’s prejudice. Leave it to the romance crazed second year to point it out. “Maybe you’ll finally get a friend, Zorii.”</p>
<p>The girl in question elbowed Poe, eliciting a solid grunt from the impact to his stomach.</p>
<p>The first year finally reached the stool, sending a tiny wave toward the head table and receiving one back from Chewbacca before turning toward the student body and waiting for Holdo to place the hat on her head. It became very obvious that this was not going to be a normal sorting once the hat was settled, its fabric eyes widened comically before it bent over, as if trying to sneak a peek at the student who wore it.</p>
<p>“How interesting,” the hat boomed, making Ben flinch in sympathy. There was no greater horror as an eleven-year-old than having a sentient hat hold you hostage in front of a room full of people.</p>
<p>The hat remained puzzled, and though the mouth continued to move, its words were no longer public knowledge. It seemed to waffle for a while, and yet the girl, Johnson had not responded. Minutes dragged on, nothing but the <em>hmms </em>and <em>ahhs </em>audible to the crowd. Murmurs began around the hall, wondering if this girl was going to join the small list of hat stalls, anticipation growing over what house would finally win out. </p>
<p>When the hat reached the five-minute mark, it released an annoyed grumble, as if frustrated to be well and truly stumped. Now even the teachers were murmuring. Ben could have sworn he saw Lando pass a galleon into Chewbacca’s giant hand with an expression of disbelief.</p>
<p>Apparently, the hat had forgotten about keeping its monologue quiet at the very end, and Ben could’ve sworn he heard the question, “What do you think?”</p>
<p>With a deep breath, the girl whispered her answer back, and the hat’s mouth pulled into a smirk.</p>
<p>“I see…” It closed its eyes in deliberation before announcing proudly, “Hufflepuff!”</p>
<p>Holdo plucked the hat off her head, and the girl sent a smile back towards the head table before bounding down toward her house table.</p>
<p>Hux snorted, his face scrunched up in annoyance. “All of that for Hufflepuff? The hat could have saved itself five minutes if it just listened to her name.”</p>
<p>Poe leaned back and kicked the redhead, who hissed from pain. Hux opened his mouth, looking ready to fight when Zorii pinned them both with a glare.</p>
<p>“Behave.”</p>
<p>It was a true testament to how hard Zorii hit that Poe went quiet. Or perhaps he was just hoping to make it to the feast without being hexed. Probably both. </p>
<p>By then the Hufflepuff’s cheering had died down, and the next student’s name was called: Finn Kanata. Probably related somehow to the Divination professor if Maz’s smile was any indication when the boy marched up to the stool. Luckily, this sorting went much faster, though Ben assumed that was more because the boy appeared to be chanting something that looked like “Please Hufflepuff” repeatedly, ignoring the hat’s attempts to reason with him. </p>
<p>“Since you are so sure, then: Hufflepuff!”</p>
<p>Hux scoffed. “First years are <em>asking </em>to be placed into Hufflepuff now? The <em> leftover house </em>?”</p>
<p>Finn Kanata looked so relieved and excited that he was already off the stool before Holdo could pluck the hat from his head to ready it for the next student. The boy practically sprinted for the Hufflepuff table, shaking hands eagerly with the prefect greeting new students before rushing to sit next to the Johnson girl.</p>
<p>Poe started giggling, grabbing Zorii’s arm. “Guess that explains Finn’s enthusiasm, huh? Someone’s got a crush already.”</p>
<p>Across the table, Ben met Zorii’s gaze and both sighed in solidarity. As nice as Poe and Hux could be, being their friend was truly exhausting sometimes.</p>
<p>Silently, Zorii pointed to herself, a non-verbal <em>don’t worry, I got this one </em>before leaning into the table to speak to Poe and Hux both.</p>
<p>“Alright, morons, listen up. Hux, say another idiotic thing about the other houses again, and you’ll be stuck with Poe as a partner for Potions for the rest of the year.”</p>
<p>Ben would have laughed at Hux’s appropriately horrified face if it wasn’t for the fact that <em>he </em>was the one who had to partner with Poe in Potions. It was like having a well-meaning blast-ended skrewt for a deskmate. </p>
<p>“<em> What </em>—”</p>
<p>“And you,” Zorii turned to Poe. “Shut up about crushes and people’s personal lives for at least the next week, or I won’t help you practice for Quidditch tryouts. Try getting the kind of experience you need to score a first-string chaser spot without someone to guard the hoops.”</p>
<p>“But <em> Zor</em>, I—”</p>
<p>“—have to make the team. I know. So keep your trap shut.”</p>
<p>Ben pressed his lips together to prevent a smile, but met Zorii’s gaze, communicating a silent thanks before turning back to the ceremony.</p>
<p>The smirk on her face told him he owed her for the next time. At least he could make it through the first night without his mom getting an owl.</p><p align="center"> ⟢⚔⟣ </p>
<p>Rey wondered if there was ever going to be a point in time where magic was not completely overwhelming. Getting onto the platform, the candy Finn shared with her on the train, heck, the <em>ceiling</em>. If someone had told Rey a week ago that magical ceilings were a thing, she probably would have looked at them like they were a lunatic.</p>
<p>And then they brought out a hat. A hat that talks. A hat that somehow knows the values you hold dear, judges you on them, and then puts you into a place where you have to spend the next seven years. Magic’s not just overwhelming. Magic’s a little <em>terrifying</em>.</p>
<p>Waiting for her name to be called is torturously slow, and comes too fast all at the same time.</p>
<p>“Rey Johnson.”</p>
<p>She swallows, pushing past the few rows of students still waiting their turn to make her way up the stairs. Having this many eyes on her makes her heart rate skyrocket, but she just takes a deep breath and remembers that Chewbacca is right there. That he hasn’t let anything bad happen to her yet since he picked her up from the orphanage. That he wouldn’t let anything bad happen to her right now. She waves at him— a rush of relief floods her veins when he smiles and waves back— and then she’s sitting, the hat placed on her head by the graceful professor in lavender-colored robes.</p>
<p>“How interesting,” the voice above her boomed as it settled on her head. Rey crushed the urge to flinch, willing herself to keep her features even. The hat didn’t mean it, at least, not in the way she’s used to from the other kids at the orphanage or foster homes. Not in the way passive-aggressive way adopting families described her to avoid using the words strange, or weird, eerie, or unnatural. No. If an animated hat said she was interesting, it probably meant it.</p>
<p>When the hat spoke next, its voice had lowered for her ears only. “It is always refreshing to sort someone with no idea of the history of the houses or their characteristics. No expectations, no fear. It’s a beautiful thing, Miss Johnson.</p>
<p>“But that’s not what makes you interesting, oh no-no. I’ve faced some tough sorts throughout the years, sometimes with people split right down the middle between two houses, but rarely have I seen someone who could do well in any of the Hogwarts houses. Even then, they all had some kind of preference.”</p>
<p>Rey breathed deeply, keenly aware of all the eyes on her. She wished she was facing the head table rather than this sea of students.</p>
<p>“Resourceful and ambitious, to have made such strides with the hand you’ve been dealt. Bravery and nerves like steel to face down hopelessness. Constantly learning, pushing the bounds of knowledge where others might shy away. Yet so much patience you display. So much loyalty and hard work, even when it feels like there will be no reward.”</p>
<p>Rey swallowed, waiting for the verdict, but the hat continued to pick at his reasoning, trying to find a clear winner. It seemed to go on forever, and Rey had to cross her ankles to keep herself from squirming.</p>
<p>“Ravenclaw would feed your creativity, the need to know more. Hufflepuff could show you that sometimes patience has a reward, reaffirm your drive to work hard in everything you do. Gryffindor could cultivate that brave spirit that flames in your heart, help you face your fears. Slytherin would help you grow your ambition and natural cunning. There is not a house here that would turn you away if they knew your potential for great and wonderful things, Miss Johnson. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“I just— I want to go where I’m most wanted,” Rey whispered in response. “Not for what I will be, but for what I am now.”</p>
<p>“I see,” the hat answered, and she wondered if she was imagining the smile in its voice. “Hufflepuff!”</p>
<p>Truthfully, Rey still didn’t know enough to know exactly what the significance was— she was still just trying to wrap her head around the existence of Hogwart after all— but the second table from the left was cheering wildly at the proclamation, and so, like all the first years who had been sorted before her, she made her way down to her new housemates.</p>
<p>Finn was sorted right after her, into Hufflepuff as well, which is a relief, because at the very least there will be one familiar face at the table. Rey has to admit, the sorting is a lot more enjoyable when you already know where you’re going to sit for dinner. She hadn’t been paying close attention to who had been sorted where earlier. She had been too anxious about her placement to worry about the other kids in her year.</p>
<p>But now, Rey could clap for her fellow first-year Hufflepuffs, exchanging smiles with Finn as names like Bodhi Rook and Ralo Surrell and Pendra Siliu joined their ranks. Finn had rushed down after his sorting to sit on her right, and to her left was Kaydel Connix, another first-year, her blonde hair pulled into a crown braid. She had smiled at Rey when she slipped onto the bench next to her, introducing herself and announcing proudly, “We’re going to be roommates.”</p>
<p>Magic itself was overwhelming, but this friendliness? It was just plain strange.</p>
<p>Once the sorting was over, the last eleven-year-old shuffled to their house table, the man in the center of the head table rose to address the room. According to Kaydel, once he finished talking there would be an entire feast of food, and Rey had to admit that she was pretty excited by the concept.</p>
<p>“To all our new students, welcome. And to all our old students, welcome back.” The man opened his arms in a friendly gesture and smile before speaking again. “As many of you know, I am Professor Skywalker, headmaster of Hogwarts, and it is my great honor to have you all here this year. Before we eat, allow me to address some basics. Curfew is strictly enforced, not only by staff but by the prefects in the student body. Good behavior and excellence in your coursework can earn your house points towards winning the coveted House Cup at the end of the year. Breaking the rules will result in points being taken from you and your classmates. Remember this before doing something reckless.”</p>
<p>Rey can’t tell if the energy in the room is out of competition for the House Cup or a dread of being caught breaking the rules, but the students are silent for Professor Skywalker’s next words.</p>
<p>“A reminder to you all that the Forbidden Forest is named such for a reason. It is <em>forbidden </em>for students to enter without a proper chaperone. Failure to adhere to this rule will likely result in bodily harm, as well as the official punishment, so please, out of respect for Madame Cilghal’s time and your well-being, stay out.”</p>
<p>There are a few snickers behind her at the Gryffindor table, which makes her suspect that this is a rule students have broken before. Probably with varying levels of success.</p>
<p>“On the note of personal well-being, there is a bit of significantly more interesting news. This year, as happens every five years, is the Triwizard Tournament. The winner of this year’s tournament will be awarded one-thousand galleons, the Triwizard Cup, and eternal glory, naturally.”</p>
<p>There was a ripple of excitement throughout the hall, but Rey was just confused. Kaydel looked eager, so it couldn’t be a bad thing, she supposed, but the idea that Professor Skywalker began this announcement by warning of personal well-being isn’t the greatest endorsement.</p>
<p>“Durmstrang is holding the tournament this year, so I will be taking a group of students who wish to put their name in for the selection. I will only be accepting volunteers among students who will have their seventeenth birthday before Halloween. The contest is dangerous and potentially deadly. Remember that before submitting your name, for if you are the chosen representative there is no backing out.”</p>
<p>Rey tried and failed to repress a shudder. Why anyone would put their survival at risk to win— what Rey gathered was— a game was beyond her. But then, Rey had never understood the fascination of wealth and fame in the non-magical world either. Magic or no, humans were still humans, she supposed. </p>
<p>“As headmaster, I will be one of the judges for the tournament, and therefore I will be gone for the majority of the school year. I trust that each of you will treat Professor Kenobi with the same respect you give me while he is in charge.” Professor Skywalker gives a small smile to the student body as if there is a joke there that the students are meant to understand. And maybe a few do because there is another light round of snickering coming from the Gryffindor table.</p>
<p>“But all of that will sort itself out later. For now, let’s eat,” he says with a flourish of his arms. She is not prepared for the immediate appearance of food now filling the table. It was as if it had appeared out of nowhere, and the sheer volume of everything on the table is the only thing that convinces her that this is not a dream.</p>
<p>Even in her dreams, there wouldn’t have been this much. </p>
<p>She’s too shocked for a moment that it doesn’t even register that her housemates are serving themselves up with a fervor, taking whatever they please from the platters between them. Finn notices, that she’s yet to touch any of it, and he has to swallow the bite of bread roll that is already in his mouth.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you gonna eat, Rey?”</p>
<p>It snaps her out of her disbelief, and she starts reaching for whatever looks good, which is pretty much all of it. She’s not choosey. Never had the opportunity to be choosey. She tries to hold herself back just a bit, reigning in her instincts to hoard away as much as possible. While everyone is excited to eat, no one, especially none of the older kids are looking at the food as if it might be taken from them. She takes a bite out of a bread roll, the same kind Finn had stuffed his face with and hums appreciatively. It’s still warm, and so soft. It doesn’t even need butter, though that doesn’t stop her from adding some, just because she can.</p>
<p>Finn’s grinning at her, happy that she’s joined in, and Rey can’t help but ask: “Is it like this every day?”</p>
<p>He shrugs with one shoulder, digging into his steak and kidney pie. “Pretty much. I mean, it won’t always be so extravagant, just on the holidays and such, but my grandma says there’s always more than enough.” He pauses to eat another couple of bites. “She also told me the password to get into the kitchens,” Finn tells her with a grin. “If they aren’t too swamped with work, and you ask nicely, they’ve been known to give students snacks.”</p>
<p>“Really?” She forgot herself in her excitement, speaking with her mouth full of food. She snapped her mouth shut, focusing on swallowing before she embarrassed herself further.</p>
<p>But Finn didn’t notice, or if he did, he had nothing to say about it. “Yeah,” he laughs. “This is loads better than my grandma’s cooking for sure.” She offers a smile, even as his face pales. “But don’t tell her I said that.”</p>
<p>A little bit of her anxiety fades away as she promises not to say anything, and suddenly Kaydel is stealing her attention away, flowing easily into a rather one-sided conversation about how excited she is to start classes. But even as thrilled as Kaydel seemed, there was an undercurrent of nerves that colored her eager statement of: “I can’t wait to finally do some magic with my wand. It’s going to be amazing!”</p>
<p>And Rey breathes a sigh of relief as she continues digging into all the food laid out before her. It’s comforting to know that she’s not alone. Maybe they knew about the magic world longer than she did, but she suddenly realizes that she’s not starting from the back of the pack. No first-year has used a wand yet. Everyone is on equal footing in their ignorance of practical magic applications. She is not alone.</p>
<p>She still has a chance to prove that she belongs here, in this crazy magical world. It was a lot of change, but Rey knew one thing for sure: if she got to eat like this every day, she could deal with this overwhelming, slightly terrifying new existence.</p>
