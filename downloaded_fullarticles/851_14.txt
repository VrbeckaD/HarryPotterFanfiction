    <p>The ring on her finger flashed in the light of the last picture she would allow the photographs to take for the night. Angelina rushed into the car waiting for her outside of the stadium, throwing her bag first in front of her.</p><p>"Hey" a deep voice groaned, in return.</p><p>When she recognized the man sitting on the other side, the door had already been locked. She heard the engine start at the exact same time Marcus Flint's face appeared from the shadows.</p><p>"What are you doing in my car?" She barked at her opponent.</p><p>"This is my driver, Johnson. That bludger actually cause damages to your brain, eh? Let me tell Alfred to make a stop by St Mungo's."</p><p>"Please shut it."</p><p>Her head did hurt though the medic had cleared her to play the other half of the game. She'd lostbut that was the new seeker's fault. This was the right car, no doubt about it and she wasn't in the mood to investigate.</p><p>"I'm sure you live in one of the obnoxious neighborhoods," she let out, irritated, before scooting up and addressing the driver, "Alfred, would you please drop me off on..."</p><p>"Wait, you really thought that was his name?" Marcus cut off with a mischievous smile.</p><p>"Nevermind," she groaned, leaning back in her seat with a long sigh.</p><p>After all, she could wait, enjoy the long way home, forget her problems for the ride. They woukd be waiting for her at home.</p><p>Marcus picked up a bottle of Champagne from the refrigerated area next to him and offered it to Angelina, arching a brow.</p><p>"You lost, have a sip. It's tradition."</p><p>"A Slytherin one, surely, from all the losses you took back at Hogwarts."</p><p>He permitted a hearty laugh to her sass. His hand still offering the beverage.</p><p>"I don't drink," she consented to explain, disdain on her lips.</p><p>"Me neither," Marcus replied before opening the bottle with an expert move and gulping down the foam before it escaped.</p><p>Angelina turned her gaze away. It was silly. Something in the way he did that moved her body, contracted her lower stomach. She crossed her legs, retreating the feeling back in her mind, replacing it with George waiting for her at home with his charming smile.</p><p>Who was she kidding? George had never waited for her at home. Or in life. Date, move in together, propose. Sometimes she worried going home more than three times a week would mean a discussion about having children. She only wanted to relax in a hotel room, by herself. This was the next best thing, short of Flint staring.</p><p>Marcus hadn't seen her coming. One second and she was in his car, in his space. In truth many women had broken in his car, room, penthouse. His first thought was to assume she wanted him, the way the others craved his presence.</p><p>One look at her reminded him who Angelina was. A former Gryffindor. An opponent, a fellow player, one who knew better.</p><p>"So... what's your poison?" He asked, not expecting an answer. He filled silence with pickup lines and dry humor. Except she couldn't be picked up and he'd never seen a smile on her face, even through victory.</p><p>"Quidditch," she whispered, to his surprise.</p><p>Marcus put the champagne down, licking his lips. Because for the first time he didn't fill the silence - granted he didn't know what to say - she expanded.</p><p>"I play to the point of exhaustion, I played through fractures and broken bones. I missed friends' birthdays, family reunions... hell I missed my own engagement party for practice."</p><p>She spared him a glance. For approval? No. Fear of being judged. Nuance.</p><p>The way she fidgeted with her engagement ring. She was taken. It filled the air. She seemed to suffocate, hunching under the weight of this not-so-big ring.</p><p>But she was Johnson, she couldn't care less about eternal stones, he deducted. Or was she trying not to bruise Weasley's ego? She could buy herself ten times that jewel.</p><p>"I missed my father's funeral. Well... avoided it, if we're being honest," he retorted.</p><p>"Why are we by the way? Honest I mean."</p><p>It wasn't like they'd been friends, acquaintances or even cordial enemies. They were nothing to one another. Not ever once shared a page in QuidFan.</p><p>He shrugged. Because players didn't reveal secrets to outsiders. This was a relative safe space. The silent code. On the arena and outside of it. They had enough of the press trying to burn them at the stake.</p><p>"Because players are usually too drunk to withhold the truth. We can pretend to be, although I haven't been in months."</p><p>She shifted on her seat, relaxing. She liked straightforward answers, he realized. No BS. She spread her legs, stretched her arms and let her head fall on the leather. He had noticed her before, at school. Every player did, no matter the house.</p><p>They used to talk about her ass in the lockers. Truly, they compartmentalized her body in more ways than he could remember.</p><p>He would not forget however, how he felt when she stormed on him, enraged and half naked talking about him cheating or helping Draco doing so.</p><p>Until her friends dragged her out, the boys whistling and yelling.</p><p>"If only I could go back to being a 7th year player at Hogwarts... Hating you for your house."</p><p>She grinned at him and he couldn't help but smile.</p><p>"Are you mad? Go back and let go of the money, the fame, the favors, the respect?"</p><p>"Didn't you enjoy those as a teenager already? I, on the other hand, could do without if it meant..."</p><p>She caught herself, sitting upward again, gazing through the window. "Where are we heading?"</p><p>No fear in her tone. Either she trusted him, which was unlikely, or she knew she could win in duel. It was true, he'd seen her upset. And he had never been great at spells anyway, or potions.</p><p>"Not home. I'm going to an after-party. You can come. Miss another one of your boring family nights."</p><p>She did not like the comment. He saw the wince, yet she was considering it.</p><p>"What kind of party, Flint?"</p><p>No BS, he remembered just in time, catching himself.</p><p>"The sort you probably loathe. Alcohol, drugs, women of little virtue, men of small intellect coupled with bad manners. But I'll stay with you, I won't leave you to the wolves. Honest."</p><p>"I can defend myself."</p><p>"I know. I've seen you on a broom. I meant..</p><p>He stopped, choosing his words. I'll give you attention and stay close to you, I'll make you forget your bad romantic choices and have you remember that fire you had outside of the game, when you looked at me like you wanted to punch my face and I wanted nothing else but to burry it in between your thighs.</p><p>"I will make sure you don't get bored. I'm a great entertainer. I get paid the big bucks."</p><p>He smiled. One wink.</p><p>One wink, and she felt it again. The twitch inside her that she should not feel. Not right then, not with him. The one she hadn't felt in months in George's presence.</p><p>She could cry, knowing she forced herself so many times with George and this stupid ex-Slytherin appeared, flashing her a few smiles, opening a bottle - not even sabering it - and she went weak in the belly.</p><p>Instead, she smiled, tears retreating in her throat.</p><p>"I know that. I've seen you on a broom. On several magazine covers. And commercials," she repeated, mocking. "I'm not dressed for a party though."</p><p>"We can stop anywhere."</p><p>"Shops are closed at this hour."</p><p>"Not the good ones. And not for us. Don't tell me you buy at department stores."</p><p>He laughed, genuinely mocking her. Her mouth clamped shut and his hilarity doubled.</p><p>"Bloody hell, Johnson! Why are you so scared of showing off your money?"</p><p>He was choking on his own mockery now.</p><p>"If you must know, I find it obnoxious, arrogant and insensitive."</p><p>"Why?" He shouted, astonishment on his features, "Don't you work hard for it?"</p><p>"I do but... well I play quidditch. It's not the hardest job in the world. No 8 to 5 slowly dying behind a desk or freezing in the cold, mending roads, or running into fires to save people. And none of those jobs are paid as decently as they should."</p><p>His jaw dropped. That angular, square, manly jaw of his.</p><p>"What's the point then? Of having all this, not enjoying it and feeling guilty?"</p><p>Curiosity spread on his face.</p><p>"I can help people, my family, my friends, charities."</p><p>She held her chin high, ready for the crushing wave of his tease.</p><p>Marcus' body, too big for the small space, turned towards her, grave.</p><p>"Johnson. Those charities are scams. You must know this. The only people getting your money are the board of directors and the founders. Some business partner withdrawing the money from some overseas account."</p><p>She fell silent.</p><p>"Okay, you don't have to spend your blood diamond money on an outfit, I'll pay it for you. My dad actually mended those roads you mentioned and my mom repaired the computers that those employees spend ten hours staring at. They didn't find it arrogant nor obnoxious when they saw my first check, or the car I picked them up in."</p><p>Angelina almost broke her neck, trying to look at Flint. She heard the crack sound and ignored it.</p><p>"Wait, you weren't already rich?"</p><p>"No. Not sure why everyone assumed all Slytherins have trunks overflowing with gold. That's completely unrealistic and not highly probable."</p><p>In one second, her long-lasting prejudice shattered</p><p>"How many other truths about your old house did everyone get wrong?"</p><p>There it was. The gleamer in her eyes. Curiosity, interest. He had found what she was missing in her life. Novelty.</p><p>And to give that to a national player who traveled weekly, met new people daily and was offered more opportunities in a month than regular lads only saw in a lifetime, that was going to be hard.</p><p>Back up, he thought. What was he doing, making plans to impress Angelina Johnson? Why was he entertaining the possibility that she could be swayed or that he even wanted to make the effort?He didn't know her.</p><p>He knew of her, he had known her from afar.</p><p>What's in it for you, Marcus?</p><p>Sex? He could have that anywhere, anytime, without lifting a finger.</p><p>Company? He had in his teammates, cousins, friends.</p><p>Intimacy? She couldn't be the one to give him that. She was taken and he didn't need any.</p><p>Fun conversation? A verbal joust with a Red and Gold alum had its perks. Nostalgia. For old time sake. He did miss Hogwarts from time to time, common room talks and evenings. But surely that couldn't be enough to make him elaborate plans to woo her.</p><p>Marcus Flint was a simple man, with simple needs. Ones that were being met on a daily basis. Therefore the need of her made little sense to him.</p><p>They arrived on Pegasus avenue, the new, fancier and more expensive Diagon alley.</p><p>The driver opened the car for Angelina while Marcus waited for her outside.</p><p>"Malfoy wasn't Astoria Greengrass' first," he said, equivocally pointing to himself.</p><p>"Ew, Flint. No one even talked about that. And how did your driver know where to go?"</p><p>"I texted him. Since the post war reforms, my PR team thought it best for people to see me overtly welcoming of muggle inventions and customs. Cellphones are not hallway bad. Heard of 'em?</p><p>He guided her towards an Elsa Cove boutique, still open and was greeted by the manager, two champagne flutes in her hands.</p><p>"Mr Flint, I am so glad you know a lady's taste best," she simpered.</p><p>Marcus grabbed the two glasses, whispering in Angelina's ear. "I had a date, who made a list of what she required me to buy her to be in her company. Half the list mentioned this brand, considering she was a model... I didn't think I could go wrong."</p><p>The manager was babbling about seasons, textiles, handmade seams and events while Angelina nodded and fake smiled, responding in her opponent's ear.</p><p>"I'm an athlete, Flint. Do you think haute couture is going to fit?"</p><p>He finished his second drink. "Fitness model. Not runway," he added innocently.</p><p>Angelina sighed and consented to give some information to the woman. He sat on an ottoman, waiting for her to showcase tight outfits.</p><p>Nothing happened. The door of the fitting room flung open and a on out-of-breath Angelina came out.</p><p>"Did you pick the cheapest, most casual thing you could find here?" He asked.</p><p>The manager shot him an "I did everything I could" apologetic look.</p><p>Angelina had picked a two piece ensemble that seriously made it difficult not to want to touch those thighs.</p><p>"I picked what I liked. Plus shorts look good on me. You still havent answered. What's the Slytherin Untold scoop?</p><p>Marcus dropped a bag of gold in the manager's hands which she repaid with a smile.</p><p>"Ms Johnson I hope to see you become one of our frequent select customers."</p><p>Angelina waved to her, walking out of the overlit store. Marcus brushed her lower back, showing her out. He didn't think any of it, truly. Nothing more than a habit of getting close to beautiful women who wanted nothing else than to be touched.</p><p>Angelina startled, like struck by a stupefix. She recalibrated her walk and carried on without a comment. She too wanted to be touched and she hated it.</p><p>That curve between her back and her ass, Marcus could picture it. Against a wall, angled on a couch, or right there in the limousine.</p><p>"Let's not go to the party," she suggested. "Let's just keep riding this muggle transport."</p><p>And she looked like Christmas morning, full of hope and promises to unwrap. How could he argue?</p><p>"You're really serious about those Hogwarts Uncovered questions, huh?"</p><p>She was serious about not being photographed with Flint. She had already been reckless just then. She was serious about not going to a party full of people who would ask questions she wasn't ready to answer. She just wanted this weird moment, lost in space and time, to last, in a car, not drinking Champagne with an old classmate.</p><p>One who somehow reminded her that she wasn't all about practice, press conferences, George's dream of expanding the store, George's dream of having weekly family dinners, George's dreams of enacting Fred's dreams, Molly's dream of grandchildren, Fleur's dreams of double date nights.</p><p>"I've always liked you" she heard, jumping out of her thoughts and almost out of her body, heart leaping into the void of what her emotional life had become.</p><p>"As a player," Flint added when she turned her eyes on him. "You weren't like Potter swooping in at the last minute and getting all the credit, or Wood tiring himself out from the start. You wanted to enjoy the game, no matter what."</p><p>She flashed him an affectionate smile. Affectionate towards the old her. The fierce teenager.</p><p>"Once, I made a game last an extra half hour, in the rain, because I didn't want to go through Wood's stretching exercises afterwards. Also I had a paper to write and I kept procrastinating."</p><p>"Wood lived up to his reputation, didn't he?"</p><p>She chuckled, full on fond memories, "He was a great captain. He molded his players. Guess he still does as a coach. People say players surpassing him is a tell on his lack of abilities, I say it's the opposite. He is that good that he sent dozens of students to become professional players."</p><p>"What do you think of me? As a player?"</p><p>She wondered if he ever asked someone their opinion on it before. Did he value her game that much? Was it a play? He couldn't think he had a chance with her, could he? No matter the twitches, she would never.</p><p>He was eye candy and she didn't eat sweets.</p><p>"You were ruthless, in Hogwarts. Blind rage and untamed force. You were a hazard. Wood couldn't predict your moves and it made him mental. Everyone hated you."</p><p>He locked eyes with her, taking in the critique.</p><p>Taking it like a champ, she thought, laughing internally. She grudgingly continues. "Now you're all refined strength, polished technique. You're an asset. A time-tested value."</p><p>"A sound investment... a quality product. The press favorite descriptives, indeed."</p><p>She recognized it, the glimpse of cynicism, the aftertaste of disappointment.</p><p>He was giving her this moment. This time she desperately needed, so she decided to give him what she thought he needed in the moment.</p><p>"People see you as a product yes, however, they like you as a person. You're hard to crack Flint, or so I presume. But you've had the same friends for over a decade, you don't parade with a different girlfriend bimonthly. I've never heard of any drunken bar fights or disorderly conduct. You hold your own and you even share you car with an opponent. A former Gryffindor."</p><p>He nodded, approving and satisfied, letting his head rest on the seat. He glanced at her, once again.</p><p>"Why are you wearing this ring, Johnson? You're with me, instead of him. Just break it off."</p><p>She swallowed, tears threatening to flood again.</p><p>"To do what? Haunt the parties, searching for shallow love? Celebrity is a catch 22. I knew him from before. I know it's real. He's... good."</p><p>Funny. No, hilarious. Slap your thighs funny. Knows whats important, has family values, educated, financially literate.</p><p>"But not good for you. Not your fault. Not his. You're not shallow or ungrateful for wanting something different."</p><p>She couldn't believe Marcus Flint was trying to give her relationship advice.</p><p>"If you follow this by telling me you went to uni for psychology, I will slap you Marcus."</p><p>And out of nowhere, she had said his name. She heard herself moaning it against a pillow, murmuring it in his ear, screaming it, muffled against his skin. The twitch again. And a pulse in between her legs.</p><p>Stop, she told herself at once.</p><p>"I almost dropped out of Hogwarts, I didn't bother enrolling in university. I know nothing about psychoanalysis other than the word. But it doesn't take a diploma to know this, I just took one good look at you."</p><p>"Oh really? You're supposed to be a brute, Flint, not some observant gentleman. Since when do you think?"</p><p>She had yelled it. Mean. Unfair words he didn't deserve.</p><p>"Well shit, Johnson, classist much?" He replied back, calm and collected.</p><p>He had heard it before, she could tell. It bounced back on him like a bludger. Thick skin.</p><p>She leapt forward, her belt half strangling her.</p><p>"Oh Gosh, I'm sorry. I am. I... You..."</p><p>"Don't bother. Outside of tonight, this is what you really think. We both know it. You can't even lie and say you didn't mean it."</p><p>"I dont know you!" Angelina defended her position. " I knew you as a teenager. I've seen glimpses of you as an adult. They can't erase seven years of gratuitous violence."</p><p>"People can't change? Or grow, in our case. Who's the arrogant, insensitive one now?"</p><p>The words stuck on her tongue, she had nothing to say that would not make it worse, make her look hideous.</p><p>"Well," she finally attempted, "moment's over. Your driver can drop me off on King's street. I'll walk."</p><p>"Didn't think you were a quitter. See, I'm not scared of a heated conversation. You, however, can't take the truth being thrown in your face and if we stay here I guarantee you it will happen again, therefore we're going to the party now. Unless you still want to go home."</p><p>She tried extremely hard not to compare but her mind overlapped. George's multiple exits in the middle of an argument or a conversation rot going his way, one he couldn't lighten up with a joke. He'd reappear a few hours later, silent or full of sorry's, letting Molly console Angelina, explaining that emotional pain was hard to endure for her son, since the loss of his twin. Angelina knew that. She understood. Forgave him time and time again for choosing silence over her.</p><p>Grief is not a choice, honey, Molly would remind her.</p><p>"Fuck the paparazzi. Let's go."</p><p>He felt on top of the world with Angelina by his side. Guests shot him incredulous glances. Johnson was a free spirit, unapproachable outside the stadium. There she was, with him, in an outfit so tight he could barely go two seconds without thinking about her moaning for him.</p><p>He could tell she wasn't moaning for anyone else, certainly not for Weasley. He brushed the dip of her lower back again, guiding her through the crowd, towards the buffet. She didn't startle this time. He could swear she started rolling her hips. Right then, he knew it was worth the effort to make plans. There was a chance. Still, he couldn't figure out why her.</p><p>"We didn't like Snape. Most of us wished for a different house director. We always thought McGonagall was more Slytherin material than she'd ever admit."</p><p>She stopped, her bite halfway through her lips, dropped it back on the plate, rolled her head back and let the burst of laughter explode.</p><p>"No! Nononno. I can't!" She laughed so hard she started choking, Marcus slapping her back. Angelina was snorting by then, tears in her eyes.</p><p>She managed to take a full bite this time before the laughter rolled up.</p><p>"Shit, are you going to make it?" He asked, contagiously chuckling.</p><p>He realized it too late. Being dangerously too close. Brushing her arms ad stroking her back. She would pull back. Why was he so close to begin with?</p><p>Angelina looked up, chewing.</p><p>"Yeah, thank you. I'd definitely want you by my side if a piece of starch gets stuck in there. You almost popped my lung."</p><p>That was it. He had ventured too close, to the point of no return. How could he go back knowing her curls smelled like coconut and vanilla?</p><p>How could he ignore the pride of being the one responsible for the first ever laughter he'd ever seen her indulge in, in public or otherwise. And, truly, Flint didn't consider himself the funny type.</p><p>How could he, forget how she felt in his arms, shaking from hilarity, eyes wide open by genuine surprise at his revelation.</p><p>He wanted her. He wanted her more than he had wanted to win the game that night.</p><p>She recognized something in the way he looked at her and composed herself. Two steps back. That's all it took to suck the warmth out of the room.</p><p>He knew what was happening, of course, and what would come next. She would lower her eyes, pretend an early start and busy schedule, only to never acknowledge him again.</p><p>"Don't look at me like that, Marcus Flint." she demanded, eyes fixed on him.</p><p>"Am I making you uncomfortable by wanting you?"</p><p>No point hiding his intentions. She had seen it and he never once played coy with women. If he wanted them, he would not keep them guessing.</p><p>"You're making me way too comfortable. That's the problem. You're my true opposite. I shouldn't even toy with the idea of letting my guard down with you. And of course there's..."</p><p>"Weasley. Have you ever screamed his name during sex? Moaned whatever you call him at home, so he knows he's got you?"</p><p>She blinked, trying not to betray shock. She wasn't used to Flint's ways outside of the arena. He had a way with words. Mostly throwing them right at her with perfect aim and without warning.</p><p>She thought about her answer. She could not remember. Had she ever stamped her love for George? Had he?</p><p>"I don't see how that's relevant to any..."</p><p>"Because you just said mine and I could tell how it felt on your tongue. More importantly, you wanted to say it and you wanted me to hear it. Well I've heard it and I'm listening."</p><p>Angelina blinked again, half startled to find out he was right. She did want to see his reaction at his name between her lips. She'd never felt necessary to say George's name in intimacy or not.</p><p>With Marcus there was a sense urgency. A compulsion. A disorder. Don't let it become an obsession, she thought.</p><p>It was urgent he'd drop hints of his attraction. Pressing she'd deny flirting with him or forbid him to lay hunting eyes on her. The preying glance he had during the game, focused on one goal.</p><p>"I'm going to throw up," she suddenly blurted, hurrying towards the front doors.</p><p>"Not there," he said, guiding her towards the bathroom as she remembered anyone could photograph her outside.</p><p>She did not throw up in fact, only disgusted herself to the point of violent nausea.</p><p>"I know what I'm feeling is merely the result of bigger and deeper issues in my relationship. But I can't help but thinking I'm a terrible person for even entertaining the idea of..."</p><p>Having sex with Flint? Never. Absolutely not. No. Yes, please but not in this life or the next.</p><p>Kissing the full lips that had made magazine covers? What was it, cover of the month at least three times? Dangerously so.</p><p>Reveling in broad shoulders and firm torso built to resist stringent weather? Definitely.</p><p>Sharing intimate details about herself and her fiancé? Sadly, already done do.</p><p>Clearly she needed therapy. If only not to divulge her private life to professional rivals and former school neneses at the first overflow of emotions.</p><p>"...Betraying him." She finished, purposely vague.</p><p>She pushed her palms on the cold marble counter, trying not to look at her guilt in the mirror. Flint on the other hand, for some reason unafraid of her to-big-to-contain emotions, applied his hand on her cheek, brushing the soft hair above her ear. She'd never seen him with such soft features painted on his face.</p><p>He made a suggestion neither of them ever considered him saying. "Then go back to him and figure out what those issues are. Maybe come find me later. You know which car I ride."</p><p>He knew it and so did she, this fleeting silly time bubble between them proved far more serious than they intended or could ever have foreseen.</p><p>Him releasing them both from the moment - knowing chances were she would never find her way back to him - was the most show of respect she'd ever received. How maddeningly sad.</p><p>Oh how she wished she could lean on him. She wouldn't. He could not help her solve her problems and his presence would only be a crutch preventing her from making the effort necessary to walk on her own again.</p><p>He could kiss her right then, one time, but possessed enough emotional intelligence to understand his last statement would get him further than any physical attempt at closeness.</p><p>She could grab his hand and seamlessly dive into his chest for optimum comfort. Except, the bitterness of betrayal would only spoil the sweetness she was craving.</p><p>And just like that they parted ways.</p><p>Marcus Flint did not mention his evening with Angelina Johnson to any of his friends. He managed to push the experience far enough in the back of his mind that only the scent of coconut and vanilla would provoke an involuntary leap of his heartbeat.</p><p>As for Angelina Johnson, she was never better. At the top of her game. Married, also. He heard somewhere. She only thought about him in front of white marble sinks, a familiar twitch taking her back.</p><p>Lives had not been ruined. Games had carried on until the Prophet announced the purchase of two infamous players by the national team, for the first time playing on the same side.</p>
