  <strong>Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lied</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>One terrible thought crossed Harry’s mind while he was waiting for the entire Wizengamot to decide upon his fate as a student of the renowned School of Wizardry and Witchcraft of Hogwarts.</p><p>What if they wipe my mind, mine and the Dursley’s and everyone else’s? What if I’ll have to go back to the Muggle world and be a Muggle, and forever forget about magic and my friends and Sirius and my parents and… He breathed deeply, trying to focus on the chaotic voices of the members of the court.</p><p>No. If they tried to do <em>that, </em>he would attack the Minister himself until they would have no choice than putting him down as the rabid dog they thought he was, for he would not let anyone made him again that boy. He was Harry Potter now, he knew his parents’ names and faces and he would not let anyone erase that.</p><p>Before his mind could go forth with that kind of thought, they judged him and he could start breathing again. He saw the iridescent robes o the Headmaster leave the room while the last echo of his voice pleading him disappeared in the hall.</p><p>*******</p><p>There was something different about Grimmauld Place 12 when he came back. The first thing he noticed was the noise, as no one was attempting to lower their voices and, incredibly, there was no trace of Sirius’ mother’s portrait or of the elves’ heads in the hall. </p><p> “They managed to put that thing down then?” he asked turning around to meet Mr. Weasley equally disconcerted expression.</p><p>“I don’t know how they did it, Harry. We tried for weeks and nothing, and now it’s down and this place even looks… brighter… more colourful too. I would say it’s like magic” he laughed before heading toward the meeting room, “but it’s not like we didn’t tried plenty of that! Go upstairs Harry, join the others with the good news.”</p><p>Harry would have tried to join the meeting, had he not already heard the slimy voice of Snape. He walked to his room, Hermione, Ron and the others already there, waiting.</p><p>“So?”, asked the muggleborn. “They let you go, right? They had no basis to even expel you on the first place, I read all about the processes for use of magic and, in accordance with the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery they simply can’t”</p><p>“In Merlin’s white beard’s name Hermione!” interrupted Fred. Or maybe George. “Let him enter the door at least.”</p><p>“And take a breath.” Another voice said, nearly inaudible. Harry knew it was Ron’s.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah” started Harry before they could start arguing over it, “I’m free. They thought there were actually Dementors. Mostly of them, anyway. Dumbledore came to defend me. I tired to speak with him, but he left without even… looking… at me.” A headache started to form in his forehead. It sounded all a bit stupid when he said it aloud, but none the less it hurt. To be ignored that way…it was too similar to his years growing up with the Dursleys for his comfort.</p><p>“Well Harry” Ron’s voice was unsure, “probably he was busy with some Order’s thing. Since that woman came after you and dad left this morning everyone went a bit crazy, honestly. I don’t understand it, really. They send us up here; we can’t even go in the kitchen, there’s some kind of spell that doesn’t let us. And George and Fred’s Extendable Ears don’t work either so”. Ron stopped abruptly.</p><p>“Woman?” Asked Harry, hoping to have Ron restart his speech. “Which woman?”</p><p>“This one here.” Said a voice behind him.</p><p>He turned around. There was a woman at the room’s threshold, <em>just behind him. </em>He hadn’t heard her. <em> How did she managed to sneak upon me? </em>It was years that no one could do that. The only one who could manage it was Snape, with his bat-likely movements.</p><p>She was, without doubt, beautiful. And something about her seemed known, but Harry was sure they had never met before. Long, curly, black hair that looked longer due to her small figure, and a pale skin. Big, bluish eyes whose shape was familiar. She was slightly smiling, and her dark lipstick made her mouth resemble that of a wild predator, somehow. It was scaring ad a bit disconcerting; Harry had never seen anyone wear a grey shade of lipstick, not even a witch. Not even a witch clothed in leather pants and a white blouse that was way too transparent.</p><p>Danger. She screamed danger. Harry knew the feeling all too well.</p><p>And suddenly her demeanor was softer, even with those lips and clothes she looked friendly now. Kind even, one could’ve say. Harry would’ve not.</p><p>“The launch is ready. You can come down now if you want; the reunion is over.” Her voice was sweet too, but she was gone before he could make a sound.</p><p>He heard a soft moaning from one of the twins, or maybe both of them.</p><p>“That woman...”, one started.</p><p>“…it’s too good for this world…”</p><p>“.. too pure...”</p><p>“…too…”</p><p>“For Morgana’s sake, both of you!” Ginny half-screamed angrily, “Have a bit of common decency, would you?” And then she started descending to the dining room, followed by Hermione and an irritated Crookshanks.</p><p>Harry, Ron and the twins looked at each other and laughed, before going after the girls.</p><p>*******</p><p>The dining room was nicer than at breakfast. Everything looked cleaner and brighter, and there were even some plants in the room. Plants with bright flower, red and yellow. If someone had told him that that room could look like that, Harry wouldn’t have believed it.</p><p>Mrs Weasley was serving lunch, and the strange woman was sitting at one end of the table, Sirius at her right. They were chatting and smiling at each other, and it all looked very natural. When his godfather saw him, he raised on his feet and invited him to come closer, putting an arm around his neck when he was close enough.</p><p>“Harry, I have the pleasure to present you my little sister, Selene Black.” He said, a bit overexcited.</p><p>The sense of resemblance that Harry couldn’t point mere minutes ago was obvious, now that he saw them near each other. While she was certainly smaller that Sirius, they had the same lustrous hair and the shape of their eyes was the same, even though hers were more blue than grey. They were both charming, in a wicked way.</p><p>She smiled at him and extended a hand, which Harry shook. When he let her hand go, he felt he did something wrong. Her hand wasn’t in the right position for a handshake. Maybe he should’ve kissed it? His confusion was probably showing all over his face, because she smiled at him and spoke with the same low voice she used before.</p><p>“Don’t worry, dear. I shouldn’t expect you to know these things; hardly no one uses them anymore.” She didn’t look angry. Not like Mrs Weasley, who was eying the other woman with a disapproval. Harry thought it was because of her transparent blues; one could clearly see some lace underneath it.</p><p>“Then why putting the hand in that position, Selene?” Yeah, Mrs Weasley didn’t like her. Not. Even. A. Bit. It would’ve been amusing if only Mrs Weasley wasn’t also so scary.</p><p>“A habit, I must say.” Sirius’ sister took a sip of water. “It’s like every lesson I learnt in this house is coming back all at once. And I’m a bit afraid my mother’s ghost will just appear from the walls if I do not follow every lesson.”</p><p>Both Sirius and her laughed a bit at that, and then the launch started amidst friendly, idle conversation.</p><p>*******</p><p>The next morning there were the Hogwarts letters waiting for them at breakfast.</p><p>“Fat time they arrived”, said Ron, “Usually they come much sooner. Only three new ones: <em>The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, </em>by Miranda Goshawk;<em> Defensive Magical Theory</em>, by Wilbert Slinkhard, and <em>In The Name Of Lady Magic, </em>by one Cricco Di Teodoro.” Ron looked a bit pained after reading the name of the last author, like it was too much for him that soon in the morning. And then he looked completely speechless. Harry supposed he would’ve bee too, if he was chosen as Prefect.</p><p>He had totally forgot about that.</p><p>It wasn’t that he thought he deserved to be one, but… he didn’t thought Ron should’ve become one either. There was no way Ron could make people respect any rule. But all of that went in the shadows while he looked at his own letter.</p><p>
  <em>This is an error, surely.</em>
</p><p>How else was possible that his letter was <em>“pleased to inform him that he has been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</em>”?</p><p> It could only be an error, right?</p><p> </p>
