  <em>"Severus...please..." Dumbledore's final words words seem to echo, hollow and heartbreaking.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A part of him, somewhere deep, knows he is dreaming but the nightmare is in full swing. The memory is too raw, too visceral, too fresh to stop it now. Harry watches himself watching the scene, mute and horrified, immobilized by the inevitable.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Snape's arm is rising, Harry feels his jaw unhinge to scream, to protest, to stop the horror in front of him. He is powerless to stop it: motionless, suffocating, helpless.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Avada Kedavra," the words pouring out of Snape's mouth like poison. Vile. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Green, everything awash with sickly, sinister green. Illuminating the tower. Hitting Dumbledore square in the chest. Frozen, silent, Harry's screams never leave him...he just watches. Watching Dumbledore blasted into the air, body suspended for just a moment below the shining skull of the dark mark looming in the sky...then falling...tilting backward over the battlements...like a rag doll...falling....falling.</em>
</p><p>"No!" Harry's scream ripped its way through his throat as he bolted upright in bed, chest heaving with the difficulty of drawing air into his lungs. His body drenched in sweat, messy raven hair matted against his skin as his eyes darted wildly around his bedroom. He was "home," not back on the Astronomy tower. The thought of either place made his stomach churn dreadfully. Dumbledore was dead...he was stuck at the Dursley's, plagued by his nightmares, and there was a deep, heavy aching in his heart. A sob bubbled up to the surface, loud and watery, his tears streaming down his face quickly as he twisted his fists in the thin sheet pooled around his waist. He couldn't help himself, couldn't keep the wave of emotions threatening to drown him at bay any longer.</p><p>His body wouldn't allow it, too sick of swallowing his emotions down day after day. </p><p>"Boy!" Uncle Vernon barged into the room, his face screwed up tight and an alarming shade of red. His voice a thundering roar as he slammed the door with such force that the top hinge gave away and hung haphazardly against the frame. He closed the gap between them in one stride and grabbed Harry up by the collar of his shirt.</p><p>"All this noise," he snarled, low and feral.</p><p>The back-handed slap to Harry's face was so sharp it echoed for a brief moment through the still quiet of the room. Of all the abuse Harry had suffered at the hands of the Dursley's, none of them had ever gone so far as to hit him in the face. No, it was always out of sight.</p><p>"We feed you," Vernon huffed "we clothe you, keep a roof over your head and put up with your <em>freakishness</em>," the sneer that his lips contorted into was a most unpleasant thing. Every utterance of the word 'you' was punctuated with a sharp blow to whatever part of his body Vernon landed on. It seemed, Harry thought darkly, that Vernon wasn't even aiming anymore.</p><p>He just wanted to hit Harry.</p><p>He'd probably always wanted to hit Harry.</p><p>"I've had it! " Vernon shoved Harry away from him as if he'd been burnt. The loud <em>thwack </em>of Harry's head colliding against the wall seemed to bring a sick pleasure to Vernon, his grin wide and malicious under the scruff of his mustache. "Justice," he dragged the word out slowly before he grabbed Harry up by his collar and swiftly sucker punched him in the face again, chuckling faintly as blood slowly flowed down over his knuckles. Something had been started that Vernon quite intended to finish. Punching Harry felt more delightful than anything he'd had felt within the past decade. He didn't seem able to stop. The <em>freak </em>deserved this, he reconciled, and Vernon was a man who firmly believed in people getting precisely what was coming to them. Comeuppance was a needed and gratifying thing.</p><p>The room was filled with a cacophony of noises. Hedwig hooted frantically in her cage. Her wings fluttering frantically as she tried and failed to flee, to help. Rushed footsteps pounded against the floorboards as Petunia and Dudley came rushing into the room. Petunia's voice, tight and quiet, urged Vernon to "leave the boy before the neighbors hear," her excess of neck craning over the scene to peek out the window.</p><p>Dudley sniggered and encouraged his father "More nightmares about your boyfriend?" he taunted.</p><p>"Not Cedric!" he was downright cackling while Vernon landed a deathly blow. The sharp crack of it resounded through the room and Dudley merely smiled. After all, Harry had been his favorite punching bag growing up, it seemed only fair that his father should finally get his turn.</p><p>They both stood in the doorway watching in fixated silence as Vernon drove his fists into every part of Harry he could reach with wild abandon. Vernon was a man outside of sanity and there seemed to be no talking him down. Not that Petunia tried particularly hard. She'd been protecting the boy for as long as she could, after all, protecting him from Vernon's wrath. If it weren't for her, Vernon probably would have drowned the boy in the bath before he'd even turned two. Petunia had done her work and she hadn't seen Vernon so riled up since the incident with all the letters. She still remembered the way he'd forced them to pack up and herded them into the car with no destination in mind all because of the <em>boy's </em>freakishness. The freakishness he got from <em>her</em> side of the family. Her husband had finally lost all patience, and in her opinion, he was well within his right.</p><p>It had all become too much. </p><p>Vernon had only ever agreed to keep the boy because of her in the first place, because of the love she harbored still for the image of Lily in her mind. The stipend they received for the boy's care helped as well, helped them live comfortably, and keep Dudley the happy boy he'd always been, but the boy was nearly an adult now. A foolhardy adult just like his mother, prepared to go and get himself killed the same way she had. It was all distasteful business. It was bad enough the boy was a <em>pickaninny</em> -which was hard enough to hide from the neighbors- but from the moment he first opened his eyes, Lily's eyes, Petunia felt an unfortunate lurch on her heartstrings. There was still a piece of her, as loath as she was to admit it, that mourned the Lily of her youth before that greasy haired urchin stole her away, before that awful James Potter ruined her, before their silly war killed her...Petunia had enough of heartbreak. They had agreed to keep him so long as they could manage his freakish qualities, beat and exhaust the impurity out of him...</p><p> </p><p>But it was only getting worse. The nightmares, the screaming, the lights in other houses flicking on in response, the questions and concerns, the whispers from the neighbors about the dreadful, nocturnal noises that come from Number 4 Privet Drive in the wee hours in the morning. It had all become too much. Vernon couldn't tolerate anymore of it. Petunia didn't blame him nor hold it against him. They'd kept the boy for sixteen years, nearly seventeen, but at some point enough had to be <em>enough. </em></p><p>"Let's have some tea, darling," Petunia muttered quietly, resting her hands on Dudley's shoulders as she gently turned him away and toward the stairs. He huffed but brightened considerably when she reminded him there was ice cream in the ice box. He practically flew down the stairs.</p><p>"Vernon, dear, do try to keep it down," she murmured, pausing ever so briefly for a final look at Harry before she gingerly closed the door. She hoped Vernon saw whatever he was doing to completion and she'd never have to open that door again. She wanted to close the door on all memories of her sister. </p><p>"Yes dear," Vernon's tone was distracted but obliging, blinking at the door for a moment as if he hadn't registered that his family had been there until they left. All it took was low groan from the direction of Harry's battered body to draw his attention back. He was finally going to end his family's strife and he was damn well going to enjoy it for the all pain and suffering he'd endured while having the boy in his care.</p><p>He punched Harry in the gut forcefully.</p><p>He was dispensing justice, acting as judge and executioner.</p><p>He made sure to remind his nephew just how much he was abhorred, shouting every obscenity at Harry he could think of and when that failed him, he resorted to reminding him of his worthlessness.</p><p>"Godless freak."</p><p>"An abomination just like your <em>mongrel</em> of a father."</p><p>"Worthless burden."</p><p>"Stupid boy."</p><p>"Disgusting filth."</p><p>"This will shut you up!" Vernon wrapped both of his hands around Harry's frail neck, dragging him down to the floor and leaning all of his monstrous weight into him. Green eyes snapped open, darting frantically across his uncle's face. Harry could just barely register Hedwig's cries past the ringing in his ears.</p><p><em>This is it, this is how I'm going to die, </em>he thought numbly, desperately drawing wheezes of air in through his nose and feeling his chest hiccup as the air died halfway down to his lungs. He'd been fending off Voldemort since he was eleven yet this, being strangled to death by his own uncle, would finally be what killed him. There had to be, he reasoned, some deep irony there he wasn't seeing. Hermione would see it, if she were there.</p><p>
  <em>I'm never going to see Hermione again...</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm never going to see Ron...or Gred and Forge</em>
</p><p>As his eyes rolled back in his head, he caught sight of a blur of white he figured had to be Hedwig.</p><p>
  <em>Sorry girl, you were the best owl a guy could ever ask for.</em>
</p><p>He could feel his extremities tingling, a deep cold creeping over his body. He always imagined his death to be sudden and painless, a quick <em>Avada Kedavra </em>to the chest, like Dumbledore, and dead before he even fell to the ground. Yet here he was, death creeping over him like a snowfall, cold and slow.</p><p>A light flicked on in the house next door. Vernon paused,suddenly feeling as though he had an audience. He strode over to the window and peered out, huffing softly as he close the curtains tight. His nephew was dead -or if he wasn't he would be before morning- and he felt as though a humongous weight had been lifted off his shoulders. A small, pleased smile tugged at the corners of his lips as he gingerly opened up the door. He could dispose of the body in a bit. Few people in his life even knew of the boy's existence. Most of the neighbors never saw him, it wasn't like they let him out of the house all too often. Of the neighbors that did see him, most thought he was simply a lowly at-risk youth and found the Dursley's ever so charitable for keeping the miscreant around as their gardener. So long as none of their possessions turned up missing and their homes remained unburgaled, none of them seemed to mind having a delinquent in their midst. There was Mrs.Figg, but the old bat with all her cats was so off kilter, the only people who'd listen to her would have to be just as off center as she was. No one, Vernon Dursley wagered, need know about the Potters. That was the thought lingering with Vernon as he closed the door to the tiniest bedroom of number 4 Privet Drive.</p><p>As the door creaked shut, Harry Potter, the boy that was destined to save the Wizarding World drew in his final wheeze of a breath. His magic crackling, erratic and static-y like the snowy scramble on the telly as his final thoughts swirled around his in his brain. His body was trying to fight, it was so used to fighting, but there was no escaping Death. He couldn't escape it anymore than Dumbledore had. All he could do, in his final moments, was be honest with himself... <em>I just wish....wish someone was here with me. Don't wanna die alone..I wish someone who loved me more than anything was here, someone who loved me so I wouldn't....have to die....alone. I wish... </em>The last thing Harry heard before death finally came for him in the tiniest bedroom of number 4 Privet Drive was a sharp intake of breath and his surname, whispered by an eerily familiar voice.</p><p align="center">--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Harry had not been expecting death to be so blindingly bright. With a great amount of effort, he slowly cracked his eyes open -the action making him fully conscious of just how tightly he'd screwed them shut- and looked around. Everything was shrouded in white that was -somehow- both misty and piercingly clear, but, he was fairly certain that he was at Kings Cross of all places.</p><p>"Hullo, Harry," a voice called to him, making him whirl around suddenly. His heart -because apparently dead people still had hearts somehow- dropped to his stomach. Sitting on a bench, clad in all white, messy raven hair framing his brown, chiseled face, was his father. Harry's feet shuffled forward on their own accord until he was standing in front of James Potter, feeling as though he were looking in a mirror that just happened to get your eye color wrong.</p><p>"Prongslet," James breathed, standing up and drawing Harry into his chest, holding him close against him.</p><p>Harry threw his arms around his father and his tears were leaking out of him like a broken faucet. His dad! He didn't understand it, he didn't care if this were just some sort of oxygen-deprived death dream or afterlife limbo, his dad was hugging him! He could feel the warmth of his skin and the rumble of his voice as he whispered soft, soothing comforts into his ear. Harry had no idea what he was saying but his voice was steady, low, and calming as strong, large hands rubbed soothing circles into his back.</p><p>"Come have a seat with your old man," James said after what felt like a forever hug. He pulled away and Harry nearly sobbed at the loss of contact. The minute that they sat down, his dad drew him into his side and kissed the crown of his head.</p><p>"Where are we?" of all the things he ever wanted to ask his father, Harry was irritable that his curiosity got the better of him.</p><p>"Mm, bit of an in between place," James shrugged, something in his tone struck Harry as suspiciously noncommittal.</p><p>"You've your mothers eyes," the smile on James' face was wide, genuine, lopsided, and so utterly Harry's that the youngest Potter could feel more tears forming.</p><p>"I've heard that a lot the past couple years but I don't think it's ever meant anything to me until now," he mused.</p><p>"Cause I'm dear old dad and, as such, I'm more important than nearly everyone, 'cept your mum, and Moony, and Padfoot....and Ron....and Hermione, And well, aren't you Mr.Bloody Popular?" his lips twisted up into a fearsome pout, brown eyes glittering with an ecstatic mirth.</p><p>"You know about Ron and Hermione?" Harry couldn't keep the shock out of his voice even if he tried.</p><p>James stared at his son critically before heaving a dramatic sigh "you clearly get your cluelessness from Padfoot's side of the family," he muttered. "I'm your father, just because some sodding arsehole saw fit to scratch me out of the equation, as it were, doesn't mean I've ever left my little Prongslet's side," the <em>duh</em> seemed to be heavily implied. Harry couldn't help but chuckle, fiddling with the hem of his shirt.</p><p>"I'm so sorry Prongslet," James whispered, all lightheartedness fleeing him. He withdrew his arm from around Harry and stared down at his hands. "I-I met them once, you know? Your aunt Petunia, oh well she certainly hated your mum the minute Lily's magic started to blossom. Everyone thinks that it was Lil's magic that wrecked everything with her sister, but strictly between you and I, Prongslet, I'll tell you it was me. I wrecked it all. Before your mum and I got together, Lil and Petunia they were <em>trying </em>to have some sort of relationship, even if it was just very vague Christmas cards once a year accompanied by some cheap, noncommittal gift that at least had them on speaking terms. But then the war was starting to turn, Voldemort was gaining followers rapidly and well, your mum, ever practical as she was...she knew we might not survive. So, one night, she took me to meet her parents. She wanted one night, one final family dinner with them just in case," he swallowed thickly.</p><p>"Just in case it was her last," Harry finished, looking up at his father with watery green eyes.</p><p>"Yeah, Prongslet, in case it was her last. So, we went. Of course I was going to go. Your mum, oh your mum was magic. She had me wrapped around her little finger and it was partly because she was so independent. Your mother didn't need me, she wanted me. I was a <em>choice </em>and you can bet your last galleon that she had a hell of a lot better prospects than James Potter but that never mattered to Lily. She chose me. She was <em>proud </em>of me and that woman never asked anything of me other than to love her every day as if it were our last," he sniffled, pressing the heel of his hands against his eyes to stop the tears. He didn't want to cry in front of his son. He'd experienced so much heartache, so much, and so young, but he felt the need to apologize. He felt so responsible for all he had endured.</p><p>"She never asked me for anything, so when she came to me and said so sweetly 'James, darling-' she only called me darling when she was nervous, you know, Padfoot teased her constantly for it. 'James, darling, I'd like you to come have dinner with me and mine.' Well, I was dressed in my finest that night, James Fleamont Potter even managed, by the grace of the Gods to have presentable hair that night. I met your gran and grandpa for the first time, they were lovely people, they would have adored you, Prongslet but they died a few months before you were born. Car crash, I guess that's where Petunia got the idea," he laughed bitterly, his scorn for Petunia seeming to drive back the tears.</p><p>"The dinner was lovely, your mum had a bit of wine and kept making googly eyes at me, bless her. Then Petunia came, with Vernon and the night quickly took a nosedive and turned to pure shite. Vernon kept making snide remarks as your mum and I had to skirt around what we did for a living, Petunia kept egging him on, knowing we couldn't be one hundred percent truthful so Vernon finally came to the conclusion that I was a drunk and your mum was just in it for the money. Your poor mum, she was devastated. Vernon went to the loo, your gran and grandpa went to the living room to put on some music thinking it would calm everyone down, and your mum practically dragged Petunia into the kitchen. I've never told anyone this," he glanced over at Harry, nodding softly, knowing he had to continue.</p><p>"I was headed out back to the garden. I just...needed some air and I had to pass the kitchen to get there...and I'll never forget what I heard as I passed."</p><p><em>"I just wanted </em> <em>one </em> <em>night, Tuney, one! One night with my husband, with mum and dad, one night with you! But you've gone and wrecked it all!" Lily's voice was dropped down to a whisper but James knew his wife all too well. Knowing Lily Potter, her face was nearly as red as her hair and her hands were balled into tight fists at her side.</em></p><p>
  <em>He knew he shouldn't be listening in but something had his feet glued to the spot. He waited, listening to the exasperated sigh leave Petunia. He didn't know her very well but he imagined that her arms were crossed tightly over her chest as she looked down her nose at her sister.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You always were so dramatic," Petunia huffed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"It isn't dramatics, you just don't understand what I'm going through on my end. I'm pregnant in the middle of a war and I just..." Lily's voice faltered and James had to resist the urge to barge into the kitchen, resist the urge to be the most impolite guest and break up their very private moment so he could hug his wife and remind her that he promised to keep her safe. His hand was hovering over the door knob when Petunia's words bit into his very soul.</em>
</p><p><em>"Well maybe if you hadn't gone and let a worthless </em> <em>nigger </em> <em>stuff you up the duff, this evening would have been more enjoyable, hm?"</em></p><p><em>The kitchen was a silent graveyard "How dare you, you miserable bitch. Don't you </em> <em>dare </em> <em>to speak of James that way, don't you dare to speak of </em> <em>anyone </em> <em>that way." Lily's hiss was as venomous and deadly, the windows in the kitchen rattling in their frames dangerously close to breaking.</em></p><p><em>"You are a racist, ridiculous, repugnant wretch. I'm sorry that I ever tried to reconcile with you. I can clearly see this was all mistake on my part. Goodbye, Petunia, and thank your lucky stars that it is </em> <em>highly</em> <em> illegal for me to hex you six ways to Sunday like I really want to right now." Lily gasped when she walked out of the kitchen and straight into James. She looked at him with nothing but love and adoration in her eyes, running a comforting, gentle hand down his arm until she took her hand in his and Disapperated them back to Godric's Hollow.</em></p><p>"All things considered, as a black man, I led a pretty privileged life growing up in the Wizarding world....I had....I had never experienced racism before until that night. I never grew up ashamed of my skin colour. I never thought anything of it until that night, until tonight...'cause I can't help thinking that maybe...just maybe if I had been white, you wouldn't be here right now. Maybe they would have treated you better..."James sighed, carding his fingers through his hair, refusing to meet Harry's gaze.</p><p>"I'm proud of who I am, Dad," Harry whispered, reaching forward to grab his father's hand, dark skin against dark skin.</p><p>"No, you aren't, but I am <em>damn </em>proud that it doesn't have shite to do with your skin colour. You're ashamed of who you are, but it's because everyone expects you to save the world when you know you can't even protect yourself. You haven't learned yet that you've gotta let the right people in, people who can help save you. You have to remember that it was mine and your mum's choice to die for you, that you aren't a burden because we died for you. You're just loved. You are so loved, Prongslet and when people love you they will walk to the ends of the earth for you, walk through fire, go through Hell and back again, and every other tired cliche but it's the <em>truth. </em>Love is so fucking powerful, Prongslet." James looked off into the distance, at something far beyond Harry but when he turned around, the younger of the two didn't see a thing. There was nothing but eerie white train station all around them.</p><p>"They told me I would get to tell you one thing before I sent you back and in true Prongs fashion, I've managed to spend most of our time rambling my arse off," he chuckled, shaking a mass of black curls.</p><p>"Back? Back where?"</p><p>"You have to go back, Prongslet." James was standing suddenly, pulling Harry to his feet. He cursed under his breath when he saw the panic and fear in Harry's eyes, Lily's eyes. He pulled his son close and pet his hair tenderly.</p><p>"Not back to the Dursley's, your magic took care of that bit," a smirk tugged at the corners of his mouth as he leaned in close to Harry's ear, chuckling "Here's my one thing, Prongslet, listen close. When you finally realized you got exactly what you wished for; you have mine and your mother's blessing."</p><p>With those final words, James became less and less corporeal until he faded into nothingness. Helplessly, Harry looked around as the fuzzy white clarity of the empty Kings Cross station became dimmer as the seconds slipped by until he was plunged into darkness and the warmth of his father's embrace melted away into a searing, inescapable pain.</p><p align="center">-------------------------------------------</p><p>"Potter." In the tiniest bedroom of number 4 Privet Drive, Draco Malfoy stood rigid and open mouthed as he stated at the bloody, battered, broken body of Harry Potter. Cool grey eyes took in the cramped, bare surroundings of the room and felt a lump settle square in the middle of his throat as he leaned down, his fingers feeling around the bruised skin of Potter's neck. Draco swore under his breath, feeling around incessantly. He'd dabble in Necromancy -the manor had books on it, he just <em>knew</em> it- and bring the git back from the dead just to kill him all over again if he had the audacity to die on him. He pressed down hard against Potter's jugular, swearing softly. It took several moments until he felt it.</p><p>A pulse.</p><p>He sighed, a nervous, airy laugh shaking its way out of him. He reveled in the feeling of the weak pulse against his fingertips.</p><p>The stupid git was alive, thank Circe.</p><p>The faintest of smiles graced his face as he, and Harry Potter -the bane of his existence and love of his life- slowly faded into nothingness with a crackle of errant magic.</p>
