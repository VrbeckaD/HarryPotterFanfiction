    <p>Here’s the thing: I didn’t actually realize that I’d reincarnated into a <em>fictional universe </em>until I was fifteen.</p><p>I knew from the get-go that I had reincarnated. Memories of my past life came to me in drips and drabs as I grew. The memories were there, but I couldn’t really make head or tail of them until my mind developed the tools to deal. I sat my mother down and explained everything to her via trifold presentation when I was 10 years old. That probably says a lot about me. My mother believed me by the time I’d finished going over the first section of the triptych. That probably says a lot about <em>her</em>. I lucked out in that I was born to a capital ‘h’ <em>Hippie</em>.</p><p>Here’s her story, as I knew it: Elizabet Gruzinsky left behind everything she was and had to join the Good Faith Fellowship, a loose organization of musicians, hitchhikers, truth-seekers, and spiritualists, when she was fifteen. From what I gathered over the years, who she was and what she had didn’t amount to much worth missing. She renamed herself Serenity Sky and soaked up as much knowledge as she could from anyone who would stop a moment to try and teach her. Her skills were, by the time I came along, eclectic: she could fix just about any basic appliance and vehicle, play three instruments at a decent level and two at near-professional. She spoke a smattering of four or five languages and had first-hand accounts of the practice of as many religions, most of which she attempted to follow as best she could long enough to get a ‘feel’ for them.</p><p>She tried out all the labels that the Fellowship had to offer, but only truth-seeker seemed to fit in the end. Maybe that’s why she didn’t stay.</p><p>She was with the Fellowship when she met my sperm donor. They didn’t have a whirlwind romance so much as a mutual understanding. It ended when I showed up on the horizon and she decided that she wanted to set down roots in order to help me grow. He fell under both the ‘musician’ and ‘hitchhiker’ headings, from what I can recall of him. I barely remember him. I refer to him ‘sperm donor’ and not dad because he wasn’t my father in any way that mattered, and that was okay. Sperm Donor came through town, visiting our little house every now and again until I was about five, then he disappeared. Whether he was dead or just gone, we never found out. I know mom missed him, but his absence didn’t really impact me. My dad in my last life was fantastic, my mom in this life was stellar, and between them I felt sufficiently parented.</p><p>Remembering my past life was weird. It really did come to me in piecemeal bits. Once I’d explained myself sufficiently and she got used to the idea, my mom adjusted to the new order very quickly. She got in the habit of asking me every day: “How was school? Did you Remember anything interesting?”</p><p>See? <em>Stellar</em>.</p><p>The weirdest thing about it was that the world I remembered didn’t quite match up with this one. History class was a drag and a half because I kept getting dates and people mixed up, it got me all twisted up and anxious every time I had to take a test. I focused the entire third section of my trifold presentation on the differences, especially the whole soulmate thing.</p><p>My old world hadn’t had soulmates, my new one did. Of course, not everybody had them. The census in America put it at something like one person in ten. People started getting marks as early as seventeen and the rule seemed to be this: you got your mark only once the soulmate was <em>also</em> at least seventeen. People who got their marks right away knew that their ‘mate were probably older than them. Some lucky sons of guns got more than one mark.</p><p>I figured at first that it was the whole ‘soulmate’ thing that most differentiated my old world from my new, that it must have been the key factor in changing the way that history ran. The world seemed kinder in some ways than my old one, less charged with unreasoning hate. On the flipside, there were all sorts of weird venerations of soulmate lineages: people who had soulmates and could prove that the marks had ‘bred true’ for generations. The stigma against choosing to have a relationship with someone who wasn’t your ‘mate was very real. It was, in its own way, a new kind of prejudice. Mom and I were both impacted, on account of the fact that my dad was real obviously not around and my mom didn’t see the point in lying about the fact that he wasn’t her destined mate. I didn’t think it was quite as bad as all the crap I remembered from my old world, but most people didn’t have the basis for comparison that I did.</p><p>Mom had a mark, a twisting fern that scrolled down her left knee until its fronds wrapped around her ankle. Oblique marks like hers were commonly referred to in our community as ‘found marks,’ and it was assumed that on the other end would be a person with a ‘seek mark,’ that, presumably, was a bit clearer. It seemed like usually one person would have a name and the other some sort of symbol. Sometimes both people had names or both people had symbols, but that was significantly less common.</p><p>I made a study of the whole thing when I was nine because it was <em>fascinating</em>. If I’d stayed in the regular school system, I probably would have tried to break into the hard sciences to <em>keep</em> studying it, gender bias be damned. It didn’t work out like that because it turned out that my new world had something else going for it, something I wouldn’t have known about except I’d been born smack-dab in the middle of it.</p><p>Magic was real, and I had the talent.</p><p>Now, I suppose I could have started to suspect then, if I was wired for suspicion. I wasn’t, though. It’s not as if I had anything else to draw on that could have lead me to that conclusion. Magic alone wasn’t enough to make me think: “Ah, yes, I have been reborn in a universe I vaguely recall from books I read as a child.” Magic happened in lots of books I read, in the before place and in my new world. There was no reason to suspect. On top of that, the magic I encountered and learned was completely different from what the books had described.</p><p>The United States’ system of magic was based around four schools that offered basic instruction as well as apprenticeships. The four schools were located in the vicinity of Seattle, Santa Fe, Salem, and Sault Ste. Marie. Each had roughly the same set-up with core classes you could take and specializations for the upper years that were supposed to fill in the blanks around the expected apprenticeships. The magical world in America had been largely divorced from the mundane since nearly a century before the first ‘settlers’ had arrived from the old world. The indigenous wizards had needed to protect their communities and had done so quite effectively. Plague had been the impetus for the divide. What it meant was that there were massive swathes of America that had been slipped sideways, hidden, or otherwise obscured from mundane access.</p><p>Magical history was infinitely easier for me to understand and keep track of than mundane.</p><p>But I focused on America.</p><p>That was my downfall.</p><p>The first time I heard the word ‘Hogwarts’ and it actually registered, I was fifteen, halfway through my second apprenticeship, and I sat down <em>very</em> hard. For almost a full hour. Then I ‘ported to my mother’s place. She took one look at me and steered me to sit down in the kitchen, shoving my head between my knees till she could get me a compress and a mug of sweet tea.</p><p>“What did you Remember?” she asked.</p><p>I made vague groaning noises then tilted my head up enough to gulp some tea. <em>Where to begin?</em> “I remembered a book,” I said haltingly. “In the book. There was a school. The school was called ‘Hogwarts’ and they taught magic. It was an adventure series, centered on a boy and his friends. I loved the books. Devoured them. I had forgotten.”</p><p>“Why are you so upset about Remembering this?”</p><p>I pulled the compress from my face. “Mom, <em>Hogwarts is a real school here</em>.”</p><p>Her eyes went wide as that sunk in.</p><p>I stood, pulling the compress from my face, and began to pace. “But there were no soulmates in the books. But then again the author wasn’t the best about including anything not directly impacting the story? But soulmates probably would have warranted a mention. But-“</p><p>She grabbed my hand and yanked me down to sit again. “Talk it through,” she instructed me. “What does it mean if the books are real?”</p><p>“I know the future? No, I don’t. No more than I know America’s future. I know things that might happen. Vague things. I – it’s been so long since I read them. I remember things. They might help? But it’s different.”</p><p>“You don’t know <em>the</em> future, you know <em>a</em> future,” she said, rubbing a hand back and forth over my shoulders. We’d gone through this before during the <em>first</em> talk about reincarnation, after I’d finished the second part of the trifold. It had been entirely focused on the fact that in my <em>past</em> life I’d been born in the year 2000 and died at twenty, whereas in <em>this</em> life I’d been born in the year 1965 and was really hoping to see at least thirty.</p><p>“I know things that might happen, but I don’t remember exactly when.”</p><p>“You are not responsible for the fate of the world, baby girl.”</p><p>“But if I know things, and do nothing…”</p><p>She fixed me with a compelling look, dark eyes equal parts affectionate and serious. “You are <em>fifteen years old</em>.”</p><p>“Technically-“</p><p>“In mind and body, you’re <em>fifteen</em>. The most mature fifteen year old to grace this Earth, but you’re fifteen right now. You were ten once, you were five, you were a toddler, you were an infant. You’ve got the memories of a grown woman, but you’re not grown, and you <em>know it</em>. You’re borrowing trouble and responsibility that was never yours to begin with.” She pulled me out of my chair and into her lap, even though she had to tuck my legs to make me fit.</p><p>“I’m too big for this,” I said. It didn’t stop me from ducking my head down to rest on her shoulder.</p><p>“You’re never too grown for hugs,” she said firmly.</p><p>Her words didn’t stop me from being equal parts anxious and curious. What I remembered of the history of my old world wasn’t accurate here. Soulmates and magic had changed things. What I vaguely recalled about the books probably wasn’t entirely correct either, soulmates would definitely have an impact on the development of the magical world, of this I was certain. Whether that impact would prevent the rise of Voldemort, I didn’t know.</p><p>Grindelwald had still been an issue, he showed up in American wizarding history books, inextricably linked with WW2 and the drastic expansion of the areas wizards set aside to be protected from the mundanes. I lived a childhood under the threat of nuclear war, with a community determined to prevent a nuclear apocalypse or – if it became inevitable – ensure that magic would allow us all to survive it. Grindelwald was to the wizarding world what Hitler was to the mundane. Both men had been born, lived, caused untold carnage, and died in both worlds. They were fixed points.</p><p>Was Voldemort?</p><p>I saved up my allowance and bought a subscription to the largest British wizarding paper, The Daily Prophet, and started reading.</p><p>I was so naïve. It never occurred to me that Voldemort might have infiltrated the paper.</p><p>Like with many events, we only really learned what happened afterwards, from the victors.</p><p>POTTERS SLAIN screamed the headline the day after my sixteenth birthday. I was shocked to see it, there’d been little to no reporting on the fighting. I’d been learning more about the state of wizarding Britain from America’s talk radio than from the paper. The byline was, somehow, even more shocking: TRAITOR REVEALED, it said, just over a picture of a sharp-faced man identified as Peter Pettigrew.</p><p>“It’s <em>different</em>,” I explained to my mother, who was watching me with concern writ large across her face.</p><p>“That’s good, isn’t it?”</p><p>“They still died, though.”</p><p>“But the true traitor was revealed, you said that the traitor got away in the books.”</p><p>“Yeah, but,” I stared down at the paper, tracing my finger over another picture further down: a dark-haired man was twisting, keeping his back mostly to the camera and shielding a bundle in his arms. SIRIUS BLACK TAKES CUSTODY OF HIS GODCHILD, THE BOY-WHO-LIVED. “If that’s changed, what <em>else</em> has changed?” I asked.</p><p>Even though it felt sometimes like I was constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, I was able to put it out of my mind for a year, during which I finished up my second apprenticeship. I planned to graduate from the Seattle Academy of Magic as a certified ward magus with a runic specialization. My final year would be spent preparing my masterwork: a portable ward array designed to guard its wearer against all manner of ill intent. Home is where the heart is, after all, and after dying young once I intended to preserve my hide as long as possible in this new, arguably more dangerous life.</p><p>Of course, my seventeenth birthday changed everything. On November 1st, 1982, I woke up to find three words scrawled on my previously unblemished skin. My soulmate’s full name, written in his hand: Sirius Orion Black.</p><p>There was a loud <em>thunk</em> sound as I flailed out of bed.</p><p>I supposed then that I could consider that other shoe to be well and truly dropped.</p>
