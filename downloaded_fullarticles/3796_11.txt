    <p> </p><p>Upon entering the little house, Sirius threw the front door open, and shouted “I’m here, I’m queer, I like it up the- “</p><p>“Sirius! Harry is right there!” He was cut off by a red headed woman, who was busy trying to make a small boy eat his breakfast, which consisted of a sandwich, with god knows what on it. It did not look appetizing to Sirius. The kid thought so too, as seen as he was pulling some strange faces, which seemed to be the face of disgust. The boy had dark hair, which poked out at every side. He wore a pair of round glasses, a red and gold jumper, a pair of dark blue trousers and some mis-matched socks.</p><p>“Oh, the child will have to learn at some time that women revolt me. Better soon than never.” He remarked, walking to the kitchen to grab himself a snack. the kitchen wasn't big, but it was quite cosy. He looked over to the far wall, and looked in the mirror. Only then did he seeror how he looked for the first time that day. He didn’t have a lot of time to pay attention to what he put on, as seen he was in quite a hurry that morning. His hair was in a bun on the back of his head, quickly done as seen as some of his hair was sticking out around his face. It looked messy, but in a good way. A bit of a five o’clock shadow was on his chin, he had not shaved in three days. He was wearing an old faded gray band tee, with overtop his favourite leather jacket. Some worn jeans and a pair of old hi-top vans completed the look. He looked around, opened a few cabinets, and found a box of cereal. He walked back to the room he came from and sat down on the couch.</p><p>“Thank you so much Sirius. I’m sorry that you have to wake up earlier this week, but I just got the call. I’m really glad though, because, my boss said that if I come in earlier this week every day, I’ll get a pay raise!” the woman, Lily, was now running around to get her coat and bag, so that she could get to work.</p><p>“Where’s James, anyway?” Sirius asked, when she walked past him so that she could give Harry a goodbye kiss.</p><p>“He went away yesterday, some mission with the other aurors. I don’t know when he’ll come back. As long as he’s away, you’ll have to bring Harry. I’m really sorry, Sirius, but there’s really no other way. I know you don’t like getting up early.” She kissed the boy goodbye, said bye to Sirius and was gone.</p><p>“Well little tyke, I see it’s almost time to go, want to grab your stuff? I’ll be down here.” The man said to Harry, who shot up out of his chair and raced upstairs to get his bag. Once downstairs again, Sirius had already put away his cereal.</p><p>“Where are your shoes, prongslet?” he asked.</p><p>“Over here!” Harry ran over to the rack where the Potters kept all their shoes. He grabbed a pair of blue ones, which apparently lit up when you stomped, as Harry demonstrated many times.</p><p>In a few minutes, they were out the door. It was a chilly but beautiful autumn morning. Sirius took his phone out of his pocket and looked at the time. He suspected they might be a bit early. Harry felt the need to jump into every mound of leaves he could find, dragging his godfather with him every time. At the beginning he tried to resist the urge, having to be a ‘responsible and rational adult’ when he was around Harry, but he eventually gave in and jumped in the last few with the boy. In no time they were at the school.</p><p>The school sign read ‘Hogwarts Primary School’. All young witches and wizards around the area went to this school, to introduce them to the first bits of magic. There was a big playground, with few kids running around. Just as Sirius thought, they were too early. Normally there were a bunch of kids running around, playing games and chasing each other whilst their parents caught up with each other.</p><p>“I think we’re a bit early, Prongslet.” He said to the little boy, who was holding his hand.</p><p>“Doesn’t matter, I wanted to show you around my classroom anyway, you can see where I sit. I’m right in front of mister Lupin!” he said enthusiastically, practically dragging his godfather around the corridors, which were all decorated with kids’ drawings and just a few bits of coloured paint showing through, as seen as the whole walls were full of pieces of paper. They passed a few doors, until they stopped at a door, which had a small sign on it which read ‘Mister Lupin’s classroom’. Harry opened the door and took his godfather with him. There was nobody else in the room, except for a man sitting behind a neatly organized desk. The man looked up at Sirius, smiled, and said “Welcome, mister…”</p><p>“Birius Slack, oh uhh, shit, no, sorry. Sirius Black, Harry’s godfather.” He stammered out, completely captivated by the other man.</p><p>Oh dear… he got himself a problem. </p>
