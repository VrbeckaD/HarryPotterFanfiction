  <em>What does it means to be Death’s Master?</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center"><strong>XXXXXXXXXX</strong> </p><p>“Come on, please, Kris! Stay awake!” Ron Weasley almost begged, supporting his best friend on one side—almost carrying her—either ignoring or not caring for the blood that had almost drenched his robes. “Keep your eyes open!”</p><p>Hermione Granger—soon to be Weasley—ran up the marble steps of the Longbottom mansion, banging on the door frantically, hoping that their closest friends are home on that day. “Neville! Luna! Open up!” </p><p>It almost seem like an eternity before the door opened, and a wary Neville Longbottom appeared with his wand in hand before relaxing when he saw who’s at the door. “What’s going on—” He then froze, his voice caught in his throat when he saw who’s behind Hermione. “…Oh Merlin…! <em>Luna!”</em> He called for his wife who was present in the sitting room, and she froze when she saw all the blood as both Hermione and Ron supported the blood drenched Krystal into the pristine chamber.</p><p>“I’ll floo Madam Pomfrey!” Luna volunteered as she ran straight for the fireplace and threw in a pinch of Floo powder, sticking her head into the green flames.</p><p>“What happened?” Neville demanded as he fell onto his knees by Krystal’s side as he used as many healing spells as he knew, all the while ordering his house elves to get every single healing potion in the house.</p><p>The Longbottom Lord grimaced as his diagnostics came up.</p><p>Cutting Hex in the throat.</p><p>It had been nearly two years since the Fall of Voldemort and the Battle of Hogwarts, and the people of Magical Britain are still trying to pick up the pieces and rebuild their life, as however short that the war had been, it had been disastrous—not unlike the first war with Voldemort over a decade ago.</p><p>And all their classmates—or at least the ones that have survived were slowly picking up the pieces that is their life.</p><p>Neville knew that Seamus Finnegan had joined the magical art studio in Diagon Alley as an apprentice whilst his best friend Dean Thomas had signed up with the <em>Daily Prophet</em> as a reporter. Parvati Patil had opened a shop in Diagon Alley in honour of her late friend, Lavender Brown—with their shared dream being to open a shop that stocks robes, dresses and accessories. Ron Weasley had taken up an apprenticeship with the Auror program whilst Hermione had signed up for the Healer Academy. Luna Lovegood had chosen to help her father full-time with the <em>Quibbler</em> that is fast gaining a reputation as a reputable magazine. Neville on the other hand had taken up an apprenticeship with their old Hogwarts Herbology professor, hoping to gain a mastery in Herbology.</p><p>In fact, Neville and Luna had gotten engaged just a year out of Hogwarts, and had held their wedding just six months prior. Hermione and Ron were dating for just as long, and though Neville knew from his talks with Krystal and Ron that Mrs Weasley had been hinting at Ron to propose, the couple were willing to wait until both of them have gained a permanent position in their chosen careers.</p><p>As for Krystal, she had kept well out of public eye ever since the war had ended. No one had really seen her save for the Weasley family. Neville knew from his talks with Ron, and even from what he’d heard from Luna that Krystal is having problems coping with the nightmares of the war. It was actually Hermione who had suggested that she take some time off to travel and see the sights before deciding what she wants to do. Although public opinion had decided otherwise, many of Krystal’s classmates and friends knew for one that the last thing that Krystal would do is enter the Auror program.</p><p>Krystal had already been involved with too much battle and bloodshed. It isn’t something that she would fathom doing as a career.</p><p>In fact, Krystal had just returned to Britain six months ago to attend Neville and Luna’s wedding—attending as Luna’s bridesmaid. And after that, it was Mrs Weasley who had persuaded her to stay for awhile before leaving again.</p><p>So why the hell is Krystal bleeding out on his floor right now?</p><p>“She was attacked!” Ron said frantically, trying to stem the bleeding from his best friend’s throat with his robes—trying to recall as many techniques what to do in the event of an emergency from his Auror training. “It was just…outside my house! It was a rogue Death Eater! We…didn’t…know…” Ron was choking back tears. “I stunned the Death Eater and dropped a word at Auror headquarters before we decided to come here!”</p><p>Neville gritted his teeth as Hermione performed spell after spell, but to no avail. “Luna!” Neville screamed for his wife as Luna popped her head out of the fire.</p><p>“Madam Pomfrey’s not at Hogwarts!” Luna cried.</p><p>“Oh Merlin…!” Hermione was on the verge of tears, now already resorting to muggle first-aid as her spells just aren’t helping, and the potions that Neville had his house elves brought isn’t helping either. “Please…! No…! Krystal! Stay awake, do you hear me? Keep your eyes on me!” Hermione urged urgently, seeing the dazed expression in her best friend’s eyes, and that the light in those green eyes are fading. “Don’t fall asleep!”</p><p>Her voice was shaking as she tried to stop the bleeding. From what she could tell, the Cutting Hex had severed several major arteries in her throat. Even with magic, there is no way to heal that. Even as a trainee Healer, Hermione knew that her best friend is losing lots of blood.</p><p>Hermione blinked away tears, feeling frustrated and angry with herself. She became a Healer in order to save people—like the lives she couldn’t save during the war. Please… She doesn’t want to lose her best friend too…!</p><p>Krystal coughed out blood, with the crimson liquid spilling from the edges of her lips, much to her four friends’ horror. “…No… Her’m’ne… It’s okay…” Krystal’s speech was slurred even as she grasped a hand slick with warm blood onto Hermione’s hand. “…It’s…too late…”</p><p>Hermione shook her head, her bushy hair following her movements even as tears spilled from her eyes. “Idiot! Don’t say it!” she protested, her voice shaking. “I… I’m not letting you die!”</p><p>“…No…” Krystal slurred. “It’s…fine…” She felt so tired. She just wanted to sleep. “…Ron… Did…you get that guy…?” Ron nodded his head, increasing his grip on Krystal’s hand as if doing so can help her to cling onto life a little longer. “…That’s…good…” She coughed, spilling more blood out. “…Hey… Can…you take care…of Teddy for me?”</p><p>“Do it yourself, Kris.” Neville begged, his voice shaking. “You’re his godmother. He’s already lost both his parents before he is even old enough to know them. You can’t let him lose his godmother too. Kris… Please…! Stay awake!”</p><p>Krystal coughed, with more blood spilling from the edges of her lips. “…It’s fine…” she slurred, tears prickling at her eyes. “It’s…too late… I…never had a chance…to live life…the way I wanted to… I…just want to feel…needed…” She whispered.</p><p>Hermione cried. “Please, Krystal…!” she grasped her hand. “Don’t do this!” She pleaded. “I…want you there at mine and Ron’s wedding! To be the godmother to our children! Krystal…! Don’t leave us…!” </p><p>Krystal coughed, spilling more blood from the edges of her lips. “…I…never asked…to be the…hero…” she slurred, her vision blurring because of her tears. “I…can’t even sleep at night…seeing the faces…of the people…whom we couldn’t save…” She coughed. “All I wanted…was just a normal life… To be a normal person… So why…can’t I have that…?”</p><p>Luna covered her lips with her hand, her tears spilling out of her eyes. Why had she never seen Krystal’s torment? Why did none of them see it? How long had Krystal been keeping all these inside her?</p><p>“Don’t fall asleep, Kris!” Ron said fiercely, but the way his voice shook and his hands trembled badly gave away his inner torment. “We’re right here! We’re right here with you!” He begged, tears spilling from his eyes. “We’ll get over this, just like we did everything! Remember? The time with the Philosopher’s Stone? And the Chamber of Secrets? Even when we thought Sirius was after you? And then the Goblet? I never apologised for that, by the way. I’m sorry! And then when we went hunting for the Horcruxes? We got through everything! I want you to stand witness at mine and Hermione’s wedding. We’re right here, Kris! Please…! Please don’t close your eyes! Don’t fall asleep!” Ron begged, and Neville’s heart went out to him.</p><p>“…So…tired…”</p><p>“Kris, please!” Hermione begged. “Don’t…! Don’t leave us behind…! Don’t die…!”</p><p>Krystal could see her friends’ faces clearly for the first time even through her tears, and she was then filled with so much regret. So many things that she hadn’t done that she wished she had. If only she had tried just a little harder… If only she didn’t shut herself off from everything…</p><p>Then she saw a figure with a black cloak in her vision. She’s seen him before once—back when she had first taken on the role as Death’s master in order to deal with Voldemort. Death stretched out a hand towards her, and Krystal knew at that moment that if she took that hand, everything would really end for her. </p><p>But somehow, that didn’t matter.</p><p>She’s just so tired.</p><p>She’s been fighting an uphill and losing battle since she was eleven. She doesn’t want to fight anymore. Death… He’s the one being that had kept her safe from everything. He never demands things from her.</p><p>He’s…like her protector.</p><p>She stretched out a shaking hand and took Death’s hand in her grasp.</p><p>Somehow…</p><p>Dying isn’t so scary.</p><p>She’s just so tired.</p><p>She just wants to sleep.</p><p align="center"><strong>XXXXXXXXXX</strong> </p><p>Death took the orb of light in his hands—the soul of his master. </p><p>The first person in eons to have the capability to command <em>him—</em>to be worthy of being called Death’s Master. After all, he had been with her since she was a baby that night when both her parents have called on sacrificial magic to protect her. He’s seen everything through her eyes since.</p><p>And to say that Death is disgusted with the world that Merlin, Arthur and Morgana have created is an understatement.</p><p>Are humans really beyond saving in the end?</p><p>After all, they’ve desecrated Merlin’s teachings. Arthur too was assassinated by his own brother with his own Holy Sword. Excalibur is lost now to the dawns of time because there is no master worthy of wielding him. And Morgana, the Dark Lady… The true story of her history has too been desecrated just because she had different beliefs from those during her time.</p><p>And now his master has to die because of the idiocy of the humans whom she had suffered for and killed for time and again. </p><p>Why should he stand for it?</p><p>Why should he stand by and watch as his master suffered? </p><p>Why shouldn’t he take her to another world and allow her to live the life that she would want to—a life that she never had the chance to lead? To have a normal life—with no one expecting her to be the hero. To have someone who would walk over fire for her.</p><p>His decision made, Death then walked through the Boundaries once more—his destination set for a world that he knew has more magic than the world that he’d just left—one whose people wouldn’t be such close-minded fools.</p><p align="center"><strong>XXXXXXXXXX</strong> </p><p>It is a cold winter night, and the fire cackled merrily as the two women sat in front of the fireplace—both in rocking chairs, with a shawl over their shoulders to keep the cold out, and slippers on their feet.</p><p>The first woman looks heavily pregnant, with the tunic of her dress almost stretching over her rounded belly, and she looked lovingly down at her unborn child. Her companion—a woman with black hair and dark eyes had a small sleeping infant maybe just a month old or so being wrapped in a blanket in her arms. </p><p>“I wonder if it’ll be a girl or a boy?” The first woman smiled, rubbing her hand over her baby bump. “It’ll be nice if it’s a girl.” </p><p>“As long as your baby is healthy, do you really care either way?” Her lady companion teased her, and the woman laughed. The infant in her arms whimpered, his eyelids twitching—almost as if he’s about to wake. The two women quietened down, and the second woman patted the sleeping infant in her arms on the back, gently lulling him back to sleep. “And if it’s really a girl like you wished, maybe she can be Zeref’s friend, and maybe even something a little more.” She teased.</p><p>Her friend laughed. “That’ll be nice,” she said with a warm smile, rubbing her hand over her baby bump.</p><p>“Have you thought of a name already?” The second woman enquired, curious.</p><p>“I have.” The pregnant woman nodded, a warm smile on her face before it faded to a sad one for just a moment. “Alexander suggested the name before he’d died.” She said wistfully, and her friend looked solemn, before placing a comforting hand on her arm. “If it’s a boy, Orion. And if it’s a girl…” She smiled, looking down at her baby bump. “…Krystal. Krystal Nightray.”</p><p align="center"><strong>XXXXXXXXXX</strong> </p><p>Death turned away from the window of the house, satisfied with knowing that he’d given his master another chance at life. Maybe in this life, she’ll answer his call. But regardless, he had made up his mind a long time ago.</p><p>His master has suffered enough. And whether it be god or human, he swore that he would never let another hurt her ever again—not like how she’d suffered as Krystal Potter. </p><p>After all, Death only follows <em>one</em> master.</p>
