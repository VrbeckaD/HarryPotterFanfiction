<br/>
“Hey, can I sit in here with you?”<br/>
<br/>
“Sure...there’s plenty of room.”<br/>
<br/>
When Stiles Stilinski entered the booth and sat across from him, Scott had no idea he would quickly become his best friend. Scott shyly offered him a small smile, then avoided eye contact by staring out the window.<br/>
<br/>
But the other kid would not shut up.<br/>
<br/>
“Ooooh man I’m so nervous! But I’m so excited!! This is insane. This is all craaaazy! But it’s all so real, you know? I can’t exactly deny anything. But at the same time I have no idea if I’m dreaming all of this and I’m just doing some crazy sleepwalking episode again and my dad is going to wonder why I’m making a sandwich in the kitchen at three in the morning.”<br/>
Scott chuckled softly as he brought his attention to the kid who decided to sit with him. “You sleepwalk?”<br/>
<br/>
He scoffed. “Yeah. Quite a lot. In fact, that’s partially the reason how I found out I’m a wizard. Apparently I would sometimes make objects move on their own when I sleepwalked. Sleptwalk? Sleepedwalked. Stelptwalked. I don’t know the proper term.”<br/>
<br/>
“You didn’t know you were a wizard?”<br/>
<br/>
The kid across from him stilled like a cat hiding under the bed. “I....I’m...neither of my parents are…magical.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh...” Scott frowned, lowering his eyes a moment before returning them to the boy. He smiled to ease the conversation. “That must be hard. How’d your parents take it?”<br/>
He still looked uneasy, but right before the kid was about to answer him, Scott spoke up with concern in his voice.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m sorry, I don’t mean to- I mean I didn’t want you- you don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.”<br/>
<br/>
“No, it’s okay. I just...” The boy tilted his head and narrowed his eyes curiously. “Hold on, I don’t even know your name! Sorry I suck at manners. I’m Stiles.” He held out his hand to shake.<br/>
<br/>
“Stiles?” Scott smiled as if to hold back laughter. “Is that short for something?”<br/>
<br/>
Stiles deadpanned so hard Scott was afraid he might be plotting to kill him. “It’s a nickname. How about that? My last name’s Stilinski. That’s where it comes from.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh okay. That makes sense.” Scott nodded as if that validated Stiles’ name as normal, but deep down he still thought it was strange. “I’m Scott. Scott McCall.” He shook his hand and waited for some kind of response from Stiles at the mention of his last name, but then he remembered he was muggle-born.<br/>
<br/>
Stiles smiled warmly. “Nice to meet you, Scott.”<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Sooo....how much do you know about everything?” Scott asked idly as he broke into a chocolate frog.<br/>
<br/>
“How do you mean?”<br/>
<br/>
“About magic. Hogwarts. The wizarding world.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, right. That.” Stiles swallowed hard. “Next to nothing? I mean I tried to research as much as I could but there was nothing to research unless I went to Diagon Alley, and I was only able to go there yesterday. I bought a bunch of books to study, but I figured I would be too anxious on the train to focus so I didn’t bring any on my person.”<br/>
<br/>
“Do you know about the houses?”<br/>
<br/>
“Houses? No not really. I just know what was in the acceptance letter. And...what I observed in Diagon Alley.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well there’s four.” Scott explained. “When we get to the school we’ll be sorted into a house, by the Sorting Hat. It determines what house you are based on your personality and stuff. Supposedly the Hat can see your potential, so its sorting is always accurate.”<br/>
<br/>
“What are the different houses?”<br/>
<br/>
“There’s Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. My mom’s a Gryffindor, and my dad...he’s a Ravenclaw.”<br/>
<br/>
“What does it mean? Are there certain traits to each house?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, there’s also animals and colors for each house, and that kind of represents the house too. Gryffindor is a lion, Hufflepuff a badger, Ravenclaw an eagle, and Slytherin a snake.”<br/>
<br/>
Stiles pondered quietly a moment. “What house do you think you fit into?”<br/>
<br/>
Scott shrugged. “I really don’t know. Some wizarding families have everyone in the same house, but with my parents being different houses, I’m not so sure.”<br/>
<br/>
“Can different houses interact with each other?”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh yeah. classes are just by year, so they’ll have students from all houses. But your dormitory will be in your house, and most people usually spend time with those of their own house. But my mom said it’s easy to interact with anyone.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ah. That’s good, I guess.” Stiles wondered if he and Scott would be in the same house or not. Either way it was reassuring to know he could still see the only person he met so far. “Do they...is there a mailbox at Hogwarts?”<br/>
<br/>
Scott snickered. “Wizards don’t use the post system. We have owls. It’s much faster. But yeah, there’s lots of owls at Hogwarts just for students to use.”<br/>
<br/>
“Right. I wasn’t too fond of getting myself an owl, but I need to write my dad so he doesn’t worry about me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Do you have any pets?”<br/>
<br/>
“I have a cat. Her name’s Roscoe.”<br/>
<br/>
“Isn’t that a guy name?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, but it also means handgun. And she’s black.” Stiles shrugged. “I had her before I got my acceptance letter, and it said we could bring a cat. Do you have any pets?”<br/>
<br/>
“No...I thought about getting an owl too, but I have no idea how to care for owls.” The train lurched, and when Scott glanced outside the window, he beamed at Stiles. “It looks like we’re almost there!”<br/>
<br/>
“Finally.” Stiles said as he tapped his fingers nervously on his knee.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Scott McCall.”<br/>
<br/>
When deputy headmistress Braeden called Scott’s name, Stiles had to nudge him to pull him out of his trance. He looked over at his friend and gave a sad smile before heading up to the stool that would decide his fate.<br/>
<br/>
It didn’t take the Hat very long to announce, “HUFFLEPUFF!”<br/>
<br/>
From what Stiles had gathered, Hufflepuff was the kindest house, and he felt it was fitting for his new friend Scott. The table of golds and blacks welcomed him warmly with applause and cheers. Stiles wondered if he would be welcomed the same.<br/>
<br/>
Several more names were called, and Stiles could feel the dread intensify as he cursed his dad for having a name that was so far down the alphabet. He stole a couple of glances at Scott, and he occasionally found his gaze and offered an encouraging nod.<br/>
<br/>
It felt like such a defining moment. What if he was sorted into a house he didn’t belong? What if he was sorted and everyone there hated him? What if he didn’t fit the characteristics of that house?<br/>
<br/>
Stiles had to remind himself it was magic. The hat was magic, it would magically know what house he belonged. Everything would have to work out perfectly, because magic was involved.<br/>
<br/>
“Stiles Stilinski.”<br/>
<br/>
Exhaling deeply, Stiles went up to the stool and had the hat placed on his head. He closed his eyes tight as he prepared for the worst and hoped for the best.<br/>
<br/>
“SLYTHERIN!”<br/>
<br/>
Stiles opened his eyes to see the thunderous applause and whooping that came from the table of green and silver. The Slytherins were spirited, that much was certain.<br/>
<br/>
He recalled rumors of Slytherin being the house of dark witches and wizards, but the negative doubt in his mind was cleared instantly when he found himself sitting next to the most beautiful strawberry blonde.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
