    <p>“When are we going to tell them?” Nymphadora Tonks asked, listening to Remus’ steady heartbeat as he ran his fingers through her hair contently in his bed. “Someone is going to notice me sneaking into your room each night, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>“This just isn’t the time, Sweetheart. The last thing the Order needs to be worrying about is inter-team relationships right now.” Remus reasoned. They’d been over this a million times since they started secretly dating a few months back.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s <em> never </em> the time, Remus. It never will be.” Tonks nearly whined. “There will always be something going on that will make it a bad time. What would they do, anyway? Fire us from the Order of the Phoenix? They can’t--we need all the support against the Death Eaters we can get.”</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud crack in the silence and a flash of bright blue light that filled the room. It was gone as quickly as it came, but when the room returned to the darkness, nine more figures were standing in the corner of the room than there were previously.</p><p> </p><p>“Intruders!” Remus shouted, swiftly grabbing his wand from his nightstand while Tonks pulled the blanket up over her bare chest to cover herself. Within seconds, the bedroom door flew open and Alastor Moody, Fleur Delacour, Bill Weasley, and Hestia Jones burst into the room. The light flicked on and the intruders--now obviously teenagers and children, not adults--had five wands pointed at them.</p><p> </p><p>“Dead Eaders!” a small voice cried out, drawing everyone’s attention to the young boy hiding behind the teenager’s legs.</p><p> </p><p>“No, they aren’t.” The boy who Remus assumed was the oldest said, moving slowly to shield the others with his body the best he could. He had vivid blue hair with platinum tips and steel grey eyes, and Remus was positive that he had never seen him before, yet something about him looked familiar.</p><p> </p><p>“Who sent you?” Alastor questioned, stepping closer to them.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, I suppose our father?” A boy with piercing blue eyes shrugged. “In a way.”</p><p> </p><p>“I meant a name, you little--”</p><p> </p><p>“They’re only kids, Alastor.” Nymphadora reminded him, cutting him off and drawing attention to herself. She seemed to remember her current situation and pulled the blanket around herself tighter.</p><p> </p><p>“What the bloody hell are you two doing in a time like this?” Alastor exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>“Remus, I think they know.” Tonks said under her breath, causing her now-public boyfriend to bury his face in his hands.</p><p> </p><p>One of the younger girls leaned down to pick up the crying child and the movement snapped Alastor back into what was going on. “Don’t move, if you want to get through the next few minutes without getting hexed into next week.”</p><p> </p><p>Teddy whipped out his wand and everyone tensed. “She’s going to pick up our crying brother, who has had one hell of a day, and hold him because Axel is scared seeing everyone pointing wands at us...and you aren’t going to threaten my sister again, unless you want me to hex <em> you </em>into next week.”</p><p> </p><p>“You dare come into our house and draw your wand at us--”</p><p> </p><p>“Let us all calm down.” Fleur suggested.</p><p> </p><p>“They could be Death Eaters--they recruit young, you know. I’m just trying to get answers.”</p><p> </p><p>“Zere is a young child present.” Fleur argued.</p><p> </p><p>“And you think the Dark Lords goons would think twice about killing us where we stood, if we had a young child?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ve are supposed to be better zen zat--are we not?”</p><p> </p><p>Axel, seeing Fleur, ran out from between his siblings’ legs towards her, causing one of the sisters wearing black skin-tight leather gloves covering her forearms to leap forward in an attempt to stop him. Alastor, seeing her sudden leap, took it as a threat and grabbed the upper exposed part of her arm. Instantaneously, they froze and Alastor found himself in a different place.</p><p> </p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> He looked around curiously at his slightly blurry and distorted surroundings. Everything was a little too bright and rather surreal, but he felt that he almost recognized the house he was in. He was pretty sure it might have been the kitchen’s dining room at 12 Grimmauld Place, after a bit of cleaning and decorating. Looking down, he saw the familiar gloves and determined that he was seeing through the eyes of the girl he grabbed at whatever memory he somehow got sucked into. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “It’s your turn, Lyra.” a woman said, smiling. She had messy brown hair tied back into a bun with loose curls falling out here and there around her face and shoulders, and intelligent brown eyes that Alastor had seen countless times. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Hermione. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Axel was reaching across the table, trying to grab the pieces of the game of Wizard’s Chess they were in the middle of and he nearly reached one, when a loud crash sounded beside them. The door had been kicked open and three large men burst into the room. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Alastor saw Hermione’s eyes dart to her wand sitting all the way across the room on the counter and shout, “Lyra, run!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Lyra jumped up, grabbed Axel and turned towards the men just in time to see a green light flying towards them. She flinched and clutched her younger brother, but the spell never hit them. She opened her eyes and felt her stomach drop. Hermione lay motionless by her feet. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Mummy?” Axel called, starting to cry. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Close your eyes, Axe.” Lyra instructed, before making a break for the stairs. She flew up them two at a time and grabbed her wand from her boot once she reached the hallway. She quickly turned on her heel and yelled “Bombarda Maxima!”, causing the stairs to explode and fall, the three men with them. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “What’s happening?” a boy asked, running out of a nearby room with two others of the same age. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Silas! They’ve found us. Take Axel and get to the Safe Room.” Lyra instructed, handing over the three year old. “Quickly, go!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The four of them took off down the hallway and Lyra turned back towards the sound of the men unburying themselves from the rubble. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You stupid girl, you can’t hide!” one of them shouted. They were right--there really wasn’t anything to do but fight. She had to protect her siblings. Good thing her parents didn’t raise a coward. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> A thick black cloud shot up from where the stairs were destroyed and hit Lyra square in the chest, knocking her backwards into the wall. She accidently dropped her wand and before she had time to grab it again, one of the Death Eaters had his hand twisted tightly in her hair holding her head cocked upwards almost painfully. He softly traced her exposed collar bone with the tip of his wand, a sickening smile playing on his chapped lips. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Well hello, again, Beautiful. It looks like nobody has trained manners into you...yet, anyway.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> A thick wave of fear and repulsion washed over Alastor and he wasn’t sure if it was from Lyra or his own feelings--probably both. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Get off of her, you piece of shit!” a tall boy with shaggy blonde hair yelled, shooting a curse at the Death Eater, making him let go of her to deflect it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>~~~</p><p> </p><p>A sharp pain in the side of Alastor’s throat brought him back to reality, where the oldest teenager had his wand against his neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Get away from her. She was only reaching for Axel because he recognized Fleur and tried to go to her, you incompetent fool--now <em> back up. </em>” Teddy ordered, his eyes and hair turning jet black. The members of the Order were about to attack, seeing Teddy’s aggression, but Alastor held up his hand to stop them. He stepped away from Lyra, who held her hand over the spot on her arm that he touched.</p><p> </p><p>“Bill, send for Albus and Severus--tell them it’s urgent.” Alastor instructed.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a metamorphmagus.” Tonks pointed out. “Like me.”</p><p> </p><p>Teddy looked over at her and his breath caught in his chest. He’d only seen his parents in pictures, but here they were. As gross as the whole not-wearing-clothes situation they were in was, this was really them. In the flesh.</p><p> </p><p>“Er, yeah...yeah, I am.” Teddy replied, realizing that he was staring.</p><p> </p><p>“What could possibly be so urgent at one in the morning?” Severus asked, appearing in the doorway. “I have self-entitled idiots to teach potions to in a few hours.”</p><p> </p><p>“Bloody hell--is that <em> the </em>Albus Dumbledore? The greatest wizard of all time?” one of the triplets exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>“Scorpius, stop drooling.” Sawyer laughed at her brother’s awe.</p><p> </p><p>“He can’t--he’s meeting both of his boyfriend’s namesakes.” Silas snickered.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t mention Albus to him, you inconsiderate arse.” Sawyer hissed, elbowing him.</p><p> </p><p>“What is going on? Who are you all?” Severus asked.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re the Malfoys. I’m Scorpius.” the boy said, causing the whole room to tense. “Merlin, It’s so odd to not have everyone automatically know who we are. Where we come from, our mum is Minister for Magic, our dad is the owner of Malfoy’s Broomstix--the most popular broom shop throughout England--and we take up half of Hogwarts.”</p><p> </p><p>“Scorpius, that’s enough.” Teddy cut him off. “It’s not safe to discuss the future with people of the past.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re from the future?” Tonks asked, interested.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s impossible--the most anyone has been known to safely travel is several hours. This would be years...it’s not possible. Even if you were, being a Malfoy is all the more reason to not risk trusting you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you calling me a liar?” Scorpius asked aggressively.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up, you bloody idiot.” Sawyer growled, elbowing him roughly in the ribs.</p><p> </p><p>“Can somebody just explain what is going on?” Hestia Jones asked, speaking for the first time since she entered the room.</p><p> </p><p>Scorpius rose to the occasion, stepping forward to explain everything. He’d always been one who loved the spotlight.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re from the year 2014. My older brothers are Teddy Lupin Malfoy, Hyperion Malfoy, and the twins: Lysander and Lorcan Scamander Malfoy. They are all super boring and literally started a <em> book </em> club at school. They meet once a week in the library. How ridiculous is that? I like to pretend I don’t know them most of the time. My older sister Lyra, though...she’s the most talented Quidditch player at Hogwarts. She’s gotten offers from the Foulmouth Falcons <em> and </em> Puddlemere United...they want her as a Chaser already and she’s only fifteen. I hope she chooses the Falcons. She’s the only cool sibling I have, really.”</p><p> </p><p>“Scorpius, again with too much information. They don’t care.” his sister cut him off. “I’m Sawyer and this is Silas. We are the two that shared a womb with that idiot for nine months. I wish sometimes that I wasn’t related to either of them, but I look too much like them for it to be believable. And to wrap us all up, the three year old is Axel.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet all of you.” Albus smiled, as if this wasn’t totally bizarre.</p><p> </p><p>“I saw Hermione Granger, didn’t I?” Alastor said suddenly. “When I grabbed your arm and...whatever that was, happened...that was her, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione Malfoy in our time, but...yes. She is--<em> was </em> our mum.” Lyra answered, her voice straining towards the end.</p><p> </p><p>“Am I understanding this correctly? Our Hermione had <em> nine </em> children with <em> Draco Malfoy?” </em>Remus asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not surprised--Draco has had a ridiculous crush on the Granger girl since he was twelve. It was only a matter of bravery and time, really.” Severus informed them.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, technically they only had six biologically. They adopted Teddy before any of us were born, and Lorcan and Lysander right when they had Hyperion.” Silas clarified.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I actually think that the rest of us were accidents--they already had four then. It would have been a good stopping place.” Sawyer said, shrugging. “Mum said we were all planned, but I think that was a load of rubbish, to be honest. Especially with Axel.”</p><p> </p><p>“This still doesn’t explain why you are here.” Tonks reminded them.</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps we should keep it to a need-to-know basis. Teddy is right--the future’s secrets shouldn’t be revealed before they happen.” Albus agreed.</p><p> </p><p>“We are here on a mission to change the future we came from. We can’t go back without the mission completed--no matter how long it takes or how complicated it is. We need a place to stay in the meantime--especially for the younger kids. Can you help us with the latter?” Lysander explained.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, I may be able to help with both. If your stay will be extended, you will obviously need to continue school…” Albus trailed off.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re bringing us to Hogwarts?” Silas sighed. “I thought we were on an extended vacation.”</p><p> </p><p>“Albus, you think it <em> wise </em> to bring them there?” Severus questioned. “We don’t even know who they really are for certain. We have no idea why they are really here.”</p><p> </p><p>“I trust them, Severus.” Albus said. “And I’m sure young Mr. Axel could use one of the empty rooms here for the time being, right, Alastor? We can make a portkey between here and there in order to visit him.”</p><p> </p><p>It was obvious that Alastor didn’t trust the children as much as Albus did, but there was no point in arguing it with Dumbledore, so he gave him a soft nod.</p><p> </p><p>“Perfect!” Albus clapped his hands together merrily. “Well, then, let’s go. Everyone grab ahold of Severus and I.”</p><p><br/> With a quiet <em> pop </em>, they were gone.</p>
