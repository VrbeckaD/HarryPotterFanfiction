    <p>The red haired woman stood in a defencive stance as she looked at the two golden eyed statues in front of her. They weren’t standing exactly in front of her but Hariel’s vision could make them out from a mile away. This wasn’t her first encounter with other vampires but the fact that their eyes were gold and not red made a big difference, this tiny anomaly made her instantly cautious even though her eyes were of the same hue.</p><p>Hariel Potter also named Harry by her friends was just done hunting in the forest when she saw the couple, they were walking her way holding hands while the tall dark haired man looked lovingly at the short woman with a pixy cut hairstyle. Harry had smelled them but immediately froze when she got a glimpse of their eyes, this in part made the couple react in a similar way. The three of them were sizing each other up but Harry got the idea that the girl wasn’t as shocked to see her as the man, she was also the first of them all who moved. She looked up at her partner and said something that was to soft even for Harry’s sensitive ears, he relaxed immediately at her words but Harry could sense that he would go back to the defencive as soon as she gave him a good reason. Harry also relaxed but she was still weary of them, she kept standing still as the couple walked towards her. They would be a blur to the human eye but Harry could see them clearly, she could also see that this pair of vampires were less predatory than the others she had met, they were more like her in some ways.<br/>        The woman didn’t lose any time in introducing herself to her, she spoke in a bubbly and exited voice, “Hello there, my name is Alice and this here is Edward.” She said as she gestured towards the man who was still holding her hand. “We are part of a clan living nearby.”<br/>        Harry smiled at the tone of Alice’s voice, “I didn’t know there were more of us who are like me.” She said this wile she looked at their eyes.<br/>        “You mean vampires who live on animal blood?” Edward asked with a small smile. “We call ourselves vegetarian, just as a joke.” He looked down at Alice who giggled at this.<br/>        “Our diet allows us to stay in one place for a longer amount of time, mingle with the humans and almost have a life.” Alice said this while she stared off into the distance as if she was remembering the past.<br/>        “You speak like there are a lot more of you.” Harry suggested.<br/>        “Oh yes, we can introduce you if you want.” The girl answered and Harry couldn’t stop smiling at her answer as she agreed to come with them.<br/> This is how Harry met all the Cullens.</p><hr/><p align="center">One year later.</p><hr/><p align="left">The Cullens had welcomed Harry with open arms, she hadn’t expected to stay around but the more she got to know the seven vampires the more she wanted to stay. The Cullens hadn’t shied away from making it known to her that she was welcome to stay and be a part of their family, Harry had agreed to this when she had been with them for over a month. Time had gone fast even for the standards of a vampire, all of the other vampires Harry had met were more like predators, always looking for their next meal, always on the lookout for danger and always on the move. Harry had made some friends with them but never like this, this was a family, not a clan.<br/>        The Cullens liked Harry and over the year she became one of them, Alice had seen her coming but she had also seen that the woman was surrounded by mystery. This became apparent when Edward couldn’t read her mind and none of them could make her open up about her past, she was also skittish and always kept an eye on everyone in the room, keeping track of everyone’s movements. All these things screamed PT-SD syndrome but the family respected her to open up about her past when she was ready, they suspected she was a shield but she never really confirmed this leaving them to think she held greater powers.</p><hr/><p>The truth was that Harry had never gotten over the war and her relationship with her once friends had watered down due to them moving on and living their lives while Harry rather kept to herself. The press had made it impossible to forget or cope with all of it as they constantly flocked around her with invasive questions and cameras.<br/>        Harry had been turned three years after the war by a rogue vampire, she had instinctively apparated away from him to Grimmauld place when she had felt the burning of the bite. Kreacher had immediately seen what had happened to his mistress and provided her with animal blood after she had turned, she stayed inside for two years apart from the occasional hunt here and there. Harry’s magic had persisted throughout the turn and even improved, she could now do wordless and wandless spells much like telekineses. It was now nineteen years after the battle of Hogwarts and Harry was happy to have a family again.</p><hr/><p>Harry was currently riding her motorbike down the highway when she noticed a car speeding by, these were of course her brothers and sisters driving way above the speeding limit. Harry smirked as they passed her, they were trying to show off their speed to her but they could never best her though. The bike she rode on was the one she inherited from Sirius, she switched on the invisibility when the speeding car was out of sight and switched the flight mode on immediately after that. This is how she made it to their new home just before her siblings, she was just pulling her helmet off when they arrived making her long red locks flow down.<br/>        Harry felt a gush of wind pass and suddenly Jasper was standing in front of her. “How did you reach this place before we did?” He asked. By this place he meant their new house in Forks, the Cullens had overstayed their welcome in the last city when people started to notice that they didn’t age.<br/>        Harry smirked as she looked up at the slightly taller blond vampire. “Trade secret.” She answered in a singsong tone, it was her standard answer when they asked her about something she had done using her magic in some unknown way.<br/> Jasper huffed at this answer but in a good way. “Some day Potter,” Jasper began to say with a playful smirk on his face. “Some day I am going to figure you out.” He looked down at the red head who suddenly wore a innocent expression on her heart shaped face.<br/>        Harry made her eyes look big and puckered her lips somewhat, “Going to figure what out mister Hale?” she asked while she looked into his golden eyes and immediately lost her composure when she saw her reflection in them. “Well, I need to do some stuff before tomorrow” She said when she recovered from laughing.<br/>        “How so?” Jasper asked with his brows furrowed.<br/>        “Tomorrow will be my first day as an official Cullen and I need to prepare.” Harry answered with raised eyebrows.<br/>        “You’re going to hunt.” Jasper said this as if it was a sudden realisation and Harry let out a giggle at his tone.<br/>        “Of course you dummy, it would be rude of me to eat any students on my first day of school.”<br/>        “Well I’m not holding back. If one of them even looks at you in a certain way I will hunt them down.” He said this in a playful tone but Harry could sense a certain seriousness behind it.<br/>        “Don’t even start Whitlock,” Harry playfully swatted his shoulder with a force that would break a human bone but Jasper didn’t even feel a thing. “They are all mine when they even try to do such a thing.”</p>
