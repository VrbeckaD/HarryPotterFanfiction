    <p>Hermione had a date tonight, with herself. She knew that sounded silly that she was calling a Monday night, home, alone, a date with herself but it was what it was. She curled up in front of the fireplace, after flicking it on, a trashy romance novel next to her, a glass of her favorite peach-infused sparkling wine, and a bowl of grapes to nibble on.</p>
<p> She didn’t really date anymore, not since the male she wanted wasn’t really available to date per se. </p>
<p>The witch thought about him,  and how close they had become, how he had become her best friend. She felt as if she was extremely lucky to get to have him even as a friend, with their... complex history. She smiled as she thought about how they had learned to get past the war, and all the drama before then, and now,  He was as close to her as Harry was, if not more so.</p>
<p>That ice blonde with the ice blue eyes tended to have his witch of the week, and parities with his Snakepit, and with Harry of course. And sometimes, he would come over and they would watch a movie and drink hot cocoa in the quiet, but those days .. well it had been a long time. </p>
<p> A soft sigh escaped from her lips as she leaned back, and thought about how he had captured her heart, but he would never know. He had shown her in a thousand ways that he was her friend. He had been supportive, encouraging, and for a while now, she had wanted more than mere friendship, but she didn’t dare ruin what they built over the years. He was her friend, nothing more, nothing less. </p>
<p> The dark-eyed bushy-haired brunette felt .. sad as she looked into the flames, and she realized life was changing, more and more. She had become more isolated, timider as time had gone by. Perhaps the months and months of mind games and external pressure.. And death, and loss was.. Catching up to her. </p>
<p>Was she.. Crazy for staying, knowing things would never be what they were, that her.. Feelings weren’t changing... If anything they were getting stronger. She knew she was running on fumes… and it was getting harder to keep her distance, to... not react when she heard them talk about their conquests. </p>
<p>She wasn’t exactly known for her calm demeanor.  She remembered the last time he had been here…  And the row they had over his behavior and She had called him a bloody prat, and he had called her a schoolmarm prude.</p>
<p>Hermione stood, wondering what would happen now...</p>
<p> And she knew, in her heart, one day soon, she would need to leave London, and Draco behind... </p>
<p>So he could move on with his witches of the week, and his parties, and she.. Could possibly just.. </p>
<p>Find some peace.</p>
