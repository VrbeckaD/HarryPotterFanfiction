    <p>The bell rang signalling the end of lunch time. I quickly dumped the rest of my food in the nearby trash bin and proceeded in the Philosophy room. Students were rushing in the halls and I carefully made my way to avoid unnecessary bumps and shouts of "Hey!".</p><p> </p><p>I reached the Philosophy room and quickly went to the side of the window and put my earphones on. The soft voice of Phillipa Soo lulled me into daydream world.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>"I saved every letter you wrote me</em>
</p><p>
  <em>From the moment I read them I knew you were mine, you said you were mine, I thought you were mine" (1)</em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <strong>"Harry, come back here!" I ran as fast as I could, still laughing.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>"You won't get me old geezer! Hahahahaha!" I panted as I ran. Coincidentally, it started raining. I looked at him and and grinned. He looked back, eyes wide.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>"No no no we're not." He immediately said, hands waving in front of him. I laughed and continued to ran.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>"Watch out! You're gonna slip!" I heard him say. I turned my head back laughing and I slipped. I yelped.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>He grabbed my hand so I won't fall but the momentum was too great so we fell with me on top of him.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I giggled. He shook his head, smiling.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>"Don't do that again." he whispered. "You scared me."</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I stopped giggling. "I'm sorry, Tom. It won't happen again."</strong>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>"You and your words flooded my senses</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your sentences left me defenseless</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You built me palaces out of paragraphs</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You built cathedrals" (2)</em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <strong>"I'm sorry, Harry." he sai</strong>
  <strong>d, full of regret. Drops of rain being heard around us.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>"Why? Why do you have to do this?" He was breaking up with me.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>"We can't do this anymore. I loved you, but I don't anymore." He reached for my hand but I slapped his hands away.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>"You promised you won't let this destroy us. It's not worth it! But then you became the very man you said you will never be. I hate you, Tom Gaunt." I spat and then I ran letting the tears fall with the rain, letting my heart cry and body ache. I ran as fast as I could. He told me he would never leave me. He told me we'll be okay. Why? Why am I not enough?</strong>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>"I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm searching and scanning for answers</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In every line</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For some kind of sign</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And when you were mine</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The world seemed to</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Burn" (3)</em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>I was pulled out of my memories when my seatmate, Draco, shook me. I pulled my earphones and stared at him. 'What?'</p><p> </p><p>He pulled out his handkerchief and offered it to me. I stared.</p><p> </p><p>"You're crying, Harry." he stated. I touched my cheeks. Oh. I thanked him as I wipe my tears and he nodded.</p><p> </p><p>Our Philosophy teacher barged in the room and we looked at him. More like, they looked at him.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello everyone, my name is Tom Gaunt and I'll be your Philosophy teacher for the rest of the semester. When I call your name, just say "Here!" okay? Don't call me professor, it makes me sound old. Just Tom." he said with a smile and oh how I missed his voice. It was a long time ago since we last talked, mostly me trying to avoid him throughout the school year.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <strong>"Harry, talk to me. Please." I heard him say. I walked fastly. We were in the Institute's courtyard now. There were no students left because it was nearly dinner time. I was going to skip dinner and head to the kitchens when we, by chance, crossed paths in the hallway.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>"What for?" I stopped waking and faced him.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>"It was not my choice to fall out of love with you." He said. "I know." I said.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>"Then why are you ignoring me?" he asked, angrily.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>"Do you really think I'll be okay with it? Like I would say 'Oh is that so?' and be friends with you? And I knew part of the reason you broke up with me because Igor knew something was up between us and you let him ruin us! Do you really think I will fall out of love with you, too? Just as easily you did?" I shouted.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>"At least now I know how important was I to you. I was nothing, our relationship was nothing. Everything we had, you took for granted. But for me? I love you. And I don't fucking care if I was going to be expelled just for you. Everything was my world. And now it's gone. And you expect me to be close to you? How insensitive. Fuck you, Tom." And I dashed out in the gates into the forest.</strong>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>"Evans.. Harry" He paused but it was too quickly for anyone to notice.</p><p> </p><p>"Harry." Draco whispered.</p><p> </p><p>"Here." I said without looking.</p><p> </p><p>And the class continued as if there's no tension between us and Tom. Girls giggled while boys groaned.</p><p> </p><p>"Aesthetics. Who can tell me about that branch of Philosophy?" He asked to the class. Girls raised their hands.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, miss?" he inquired.</p><p> </p><p>"Brown, sir. Lavander Brown." Lavander said.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes Miss Brown. What is aesthetics?"</p><p> </p><p>"Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature and appreciation of art, beauty and good taste. It has also been defined as "critical reflection on art, culture and nature". The word "aesthetics" derives from the Greek "aisthetikos", meaning "of sense perception." she answered and as she sat down, girls giggled again.</p><p> </p><p>"That is a very good meaning of aesthetics, class. So is aesthetics, subjective? Any other more answers?"</p><p> </p><p>I raised my hand. Draco raised his eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>He turned to me. "Yes, Mister Evans?"</p><p> </p><p>"Beauty, because aesthetics is all about beauty and art, is when your eyes dilate when you're with someone you love. Those secret smiles and eye contacts you share. Beauty is the way your whole being glow when you're happy. Beauty is the imperfections of someone that would make them perfect in another's eyes. Actually, beauty is everything. Beauty is you. We are the definition of beauty, and that makes human beings an art of their own."</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Prompt: Beauty</p>
