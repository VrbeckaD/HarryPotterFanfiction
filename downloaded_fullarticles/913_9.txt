    <p>He hadn’t planned to run. Tom’s original plan had been to work out the debt-indenture at Hogwarts, the way most indigent students did. It was only 7 years - one year for each year he’d been educated, and wizards lived a long time. It was going to be awful and degrading, but survivable. And for the first six months, it was.</p><p>But then Dippet had died in a carriage accident, and Albus fucking Dumbledore had been appointed in his place. </p><p>The idea of being in indentured bondage to Albus Dumbledore was intolerable. So Tom had run. He had gambled that he could get out of the country before being recaptured and returned in chains. He’d run, despite it being winter in Scotland. Despite not having his own wand. He’d stolen a wand from a careless firstie and a broom from the broom shed and he’d taken off in the middle of the night. </p><p>Of course a storm had blown up. Could Dumbledore control weather? Had he designed the storm when he’d noticed Tom Riddle missing? Well, possibly. He tried to keep to the air, but the old school broom was losing integrity fast, so he’d eventually landed and gone for a blind apparition. When he didn’t splinch himself, he did another one. And another. When he ran out of magic, he walked.</p><p>He never found shelter. Eventually, he let the cold take him.</p><p>At least Dumbledore wouldn’t win… was his last thought.</p><hr/><p>He lived. Somehow in his wanderings, he’d triggered someone’s wards, and they’d brought him inside and tended him back to health.</p><p>“Riddle,” a slightly familiar voice said. “Shouldn’t you be at Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Don’t send me back there,” he rasped. “Please… I’ll do anything.”</p><p>A hand brushed his hair back from his forehead. “Anything? It’d better be a pretty good <em>anything</em> to make harbouring a fugitive a good deal.”</p><p>Tom finally was able to focus on the face looking down at him. Black hair. Startling green eyes. <em>Potter</em>. An orphan like him, who had graduated from Hogwarts a couple of years ago. Except <em>not</em> like him, because his parents had left him wealthy. Riddle’s parents had left him with nothing.</p><p>“If you buy out my indenture you wouldn’t be harbouring. You could… <em>own me</em>… for seven years…” Tom whispered.</p><p>Potter’s hand grew still against his forehead. “How is that a better deal for you? You have far more rights as a Hogwarts indenture than if you’re sold on.” At Hogwarts, the school had a duty of care towards its servants. Corporal punishment was allowed, but sexual servitude was not. But the laws had not caught up to give any rights to indentured servants or people in debt bondage to individuals. </p><p>“It’s a better deal because you’re not Albus Dumbledore. Do you want me to suck your dick, Potter? Bend over for you? Crawl at your feet and call you Master? I. Do. Not. Fucking. Care! - you don’t know how that man has treated me since he first met me. He’s just been waiting to have me fully in his power.”</p><p>Potter breathed heavily. “Riddle, understand this. If I do this, I <em>can’t</em> go easy on you. I’m an Auror trainee, and if there’s the least idea that there was collusion on my part, to help you run away, I’ll be thrown out. I might even get an Azkaban sentence. This cannot look like me trying to help out a former school friend.”</p><p>Tom sneered. “Then it’s a good thing we were never friends, isn’t it? Master?”</p>
