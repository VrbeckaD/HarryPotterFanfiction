    <p>Second Lives</p><p>　</p><p>Draco waits until everyone is far enough away before approaching. He still doesn’t know what he is going to say to her. Glancing away from the only remaining seated mourner, he looks up to his former classmate, Harry Potter, hoping for an answer. They lock gazes. Harry’s gaze narrows in warning even though his arms are latched tightly around his own grieving wife, Ginny. Draco stalls in his approach to Hermione who is still seated before the closed casket.</p><p>Drooping his shoulders, the tall blond man makes it clear to his former rival that he comes to this place of mourning with only peaceful intentions. He will make no further move until he is sure that Harry understands this.</p><p>Harry looks down to his pregnant weeping wife and then to the rest of Ron’s family that are heading back to the family home to continue the wake. As brother in law to the deceased, he has a responsibility to the family, but as one of Hermione’s best friends he can not leave her either. He’s torn and knows the former bully can see it. Is he going to take advantage of this or is he really here peacefully?</p><p>With a soft hand crossed to his chest, Draco silently lets the other man know he will take over Hermione’s protection so the other can do his family duty. He is well aware that Harry has not had a true family and now finds himself torn. Hermione and Ron had been as close as any siblings Harry could ever have hoped for and now he is torn between sitting with consoling his friend or his wife and now family. Draco flicks his fingers off his chest to shoo the married one away.</p><p>Draco himself may not be married, but he understands by example the duty of family. After all, it was family loyalty that made him quite sick that year of the final battle. Not just in his heart to do what he didn’t want to, but also the toll it took on his body. It took a lot out of him not just because of his family but choices he had to make about Slytherin friends as well. Power comes at a cost of relationships. In the end, power means nothing compared to relationships, though.</p><p>He saw that quite well with Ron, Hermione, and Harry. He may never openly admit it, but was a bit jealous of how honestly loyal they were to each other.</p><p>Now that his body has recovered and is feeling healthier, he is also finding himself wanting to be healthier in relationships as well. Yes his parents have told him who they WANT him to marry, but they are backing off of that arranged marriage deal as well. That war didn’t just change Harry or Hogwarts, it changed everyone.</p><p> </p><p>Harry opening releases a sigh then gives a soft nod in accepting Draco‘s honest expression. He really has no other choice even though it is killing him to leave his grieving best friend in the care of another, one that he used to not trust, no less. Still, in the end, Draco is not such a bad guy, he has to admit. He saw the angst on his face when he was supposed to kill Dumbledore. .</p><p>When Draco takes two more forward steps, Harry curls Ginny into moving away.</p><p>Draco says nothing to the silent yet tear streaked woman as he slowly lowers himself into to chair at her side. In her hands is a bouquet of flowers a bride is supposed to carry on her wedding day, but her clothing is a stiff black suit. The rest of the flowers that were meant for the wedding today now ring the wooden casket just a few feet before them. Today is not at all what it was supposed to be. A freak accident yesterday instantly turned a bride into …what is she? She can not even be declared a widow for the vows were not declared.</p><p>“What am I going to do?” Hermione mutters plucking a rose apart letting the petals float down to the ground.</p><p>“Your parents?” He inquires softly.</p><p>Her head shakes, “I didn’t release the spell yet. We planned to honeymoon down there and let them know then. It seemed like an easier way to …,” the rest trails away as she bites her lip.</p><p>He knows she is hiding something more. “Won’t the Weasley’s take you back? Certainly they don’t blame you for the accident!” Even if his family can be proud and haughty, the Weasley’s have been nothing but kind and compassionate people.</p><p>Hermione jerks her head sharply right and left but says nothing more just continuing to tear a second rose to bits.</p><p>“Hermione,” his hand actually lays over hers to still it’s destruction.</p><p>In the past she would have recoiled from the bully‘s touch, but this isn‘t that little kid any more trying to prove his snark is bigger than his height. Beside her now sits a tall man with a compassionate touch and supportive words. If he has taller schemes brewing at this time, she is too numb to care. Right now she has her own secret worries to deal with.</p><p>“I can’t go back right now, Draco,” she whispers with a trembling chin. “I can’t face Ron’s family.”</p><p>Without a second thought, his hand slides away from hers to wrap around her shoulder pulling her against his own.</p><p>To her own surprise, she leans into the Slytherin’s perfect frame. Everything is immaculate about Draco Malfoy, so unlike her Ron. Where Draco is pressed and poised, Ron was goofy and softly rumpled. Not a hair out of place verse hair that went everywhere it pleased…like her own normally does but right now is pulled taught in a severe braid due to the severity of her adult situation. Hermione knows she shouldn’t find comfort against this man, but she does. No she doesn’t blame Harry for seeing to the comfort of his own wife and now family, she just wishes she could feel comfortable there too. Instead she is feeling most comfortable against a pristine man who used to have his own serious secrets.</p><p>The flowers fall from her hand into his lap. He folds his other hand around hers that still bears an engagement ring and brings it up to his chest, “You don’t have to face them or anyone, Hermione.”</p><p>“B-but where will I go? Wha-what will I do?” Her body racks in sobs against his chest. Mentally she curses herself for breaking down with him of all people, but grief can not always be controlled. Sometimes it eats through protective shields of propriety.</p><p>Her racking body is the confirmation that he needs that there is more to her grief than just Ron’s death and a promised marriage that will never begin. He also knows that he will get no further answer from her now. This is just not the time or place. Right now she needs shelter, protection, and comfort. Yes it’s something that people do not think his black heart possess, but in fact it’s something very deep to him. His parents love him ever so much and would -and did!- do anything for him. Time he gave that same comfort back, if the Gryffindors shown him anything.</p><p>There’s a strength in Granger that he always found vexing and somewhat appealing. Irritating but also a constant challenge during their school days. When he had started delving further into his work for the Dark Lord, he certainly missed his sparring and spatting matches with her.</p><p>Maybe that is why it is so heartbreaking to see the strong and tenacious woman so lost right now. In a very soft voice, he hopes that she will hear all his sincerity, “Hermione, it’s time to go. It will be dark soon and the rain is coming in. Please, let me take you to my manor. You can stay as long as you like.”</p><p>Hermione turns her cheek against his expensive suit lapel to look up into his caring silver eyes. There she sees a sincerity she’s never seen before. This is no ruse or trick. “But your parents--,” she has to try objecting.</p><p>He pushes the objection aside easily, “Aren’t home right now and even if they were, I would deal with them. Now, let us … let him go,” he gives her hand a squeeze.</p><p>It takes her a few deep breaths before she can take a last look at the casket holding the body of her fiancé. Draco presses the bouquet back into her hand along with a bit more encouragement. Together they rise and with his arm around her shoulder for support, they step up to the casket. Hermione lays her bridal bouquet on the top of the casket then leans over to give a last kiss.</p><p>Draco is quite surprised that she says nothing to the deceased man after all they years she had with him and was supposed to continue having with him. She just says a silent blessing, lay a soft hand to the lid and then turns away. Draco himself lays his hand down and silently promises Ron that he will look after Hermione before returning to her side. Still silent, he tucks her hand into his elbow as a gentleman of his class should and guides them back to his family home.</p><p>~~</p><p>By the time they make it back to the Malfoy Manor, the last few days have finally taken their toll on Hermione. Past the threshold is her last step. There is no way she is going to make it down the long halls or up the three flights of stairs to the guest room. Draco does not give her a chance to object, just scooping her up into his arms leaving a house elf to secure the door behind them. Hermione gives no argument to his gentle actions. Even if she wanted to verbally argue, her body just couldn’t allow it. His smooth gate, comforting arms, upper-class cologne, and even the fact that his body is so different than her past love’s is a safe place to relax. She doesn’t have to feel guilty about comparing Draco to Ron because they are so different that her heart won’t confuse the two and take advantage of the situation.</p><p>For Draco, this isn’t infatuation or even love, its…the right thing to do. To look after and protect one of his own classmates. After everything their class went through and how many they have already lost, he just can not bear to watch another die. He was even looking forward to another couple of nerdy Gryffindor bonding in marriage. Most of all these two who truly cared for each other. He may not have a love of his own, but the least he can do is take care of another.</p><p>With each step, Hermione leans heavier and heavier into the Slytherin Knight.</p><p>With each step, he tucks her closer breathing in the warm scent of a resting woman.</p><p>By the time they make it to the guest room closest to his own private room, the witch is sound asleep. A house elf has already scuttled ahead to leave the door open and the lighting low. Even the bed linens have been turned down for her making it easier for Draco to tuck her in.</p><p>It makes him smile to smell the scent of soft lavender from the crisp mint green sheets. His mother always insisted that guest linens have the soothing scent of calming lavender. Not that Hermione needs the lavender to help lull her to sleep, but certainly it shall be a comforting scent for her when she awakens in a strange room.</p><p>Ever so gently he lays her head upon the downy pillow. He ponders for a moment if he should release the braid in her hair or will the loose lock just make it more tangled in the morning? As he ponders that thought, he looks to her sweet face finally at peace while sleeping. They have all been through so much. These are supposed to be the happiest days of their lives, why did fate have to take the love of her life just as peace has come!?</p><p>With a soft deep breath, he pulls his attention away from her face and down to how to make her more comfortable. First he cups her calf to slip the pumps off her feet and tuck them at the foot of the bedside. Now for the snug suit jacket with the hard brass buttons. This is a more delicate procedure. For if she awakens he certainly does not want her to think he is trying to take advantage of her! Does he dare to touch her or just use a spell?</p><p>“Ron…,” she mumbles, rolling over, and buries her face into the pillow.</p><p>Well that answers the question for him. With a flick of his wrist and a soft incantation, her jacket and subsequent skirt with matching large brass buttons slip themselves off and fold respectfully over the dressing chair before the mirror.</p><p>He does use his own hands though to pull the bedcovers over her shoulders and tuck her in. Now he just isn’t sure if he should leave the room or stand vigil over her in case she should need anything in the night.</p><p>Hermione is a tough woman but she is still a grieving woman who has had the rug yanked out from under her with a simple slip and fall. There is no magic spell that can save anyone from a freak accident. From what he heard, it just happened so fast. One moment Ron was standing on a chair to tie up the canopy for the wedding reception and the next his foot slipped. He didn’t even have time to cry out before his head struck the sharp rock down below. Not only did he get struck in the temple, but the blow had snapped his neck to the side. Life is mortal. Everyone who is born dies at some time.</p><p>Draco finally moves to blow out the light on the bedside and leaves the room. He asks an elf stand to guard in case she should need anything.</p><p>As he turns to his own room, sighs again. If he could, he would trade places with Ron. Its not like he had anyone waiting for him other than his parents. Unlike Ron who had a best friend, a sister, a brother and loving parents not to mention a wife waiting for him to share the rest of his life with. This just isn’t fair.</p><p> </p><p>Sleep does not come easily to the tall blond man that night. The final battle at Hogwarts has left him with a lot to think over. Sure to most everyone he looks like an arrogant snot, and yes he will admit, he can be. But war changes people, too. Boys become men. It’s a time to prove your true character and find out what really matters. This is where you find out where your true friends are, or what you want in a true friendship. Yes, they maybe of different houses, but in the end they are all under Hogwart’s Shield.</p><p>When sleep does finally come, it is restless and wrought with nightmares. The nightmares are not what brings him awake in the morning though. It’s an elf pounding on his door.</p><p>“Master! The lady is sick! Please come quickly!”</p><p>Draco launches from his bed in nothing flat, tugging on his robe as he runs to Hermione’s room.</p><p>~~</p><p>Hermione herself had a restless night, which not too surprising. What brings her up in the morning though is her stomach rebelling on her. She is ever so grateful that this strange room she finds herself in at least has a typical basin and pitcher near the bedside. The basin becomes the recipient of what very little she had in her stomach. In three heaves, it becomes a dry vomit which is probably even worse than if she’d had a full stomach.</p><p>She is still hanging over the basin when she feels a long fingered hand brush her loose tendrils from her face. “Hey, are you alright?”</p><p>Slow breaths and rubs fingertips into her forehead. “I will be, just give me a moment.”</p><p>With a roll of his wrist, a cup is half filled with water and brought to his other hand so he can help her drink from it. Hermione takes a small sip to rinse her mouth and spit it into the bowl.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Draco. I… feel…” She’s grateful he can’t see her face, but then makes the mistake of lifting her head. There he can see her face by the reflection in the mirror. Even though her face is quite pale, her cheeks flush deep in embarrassment.</p><p>There is something else she sees though. Disheveled Draco’s face is frowning in deep concern for her. He is not disgusted by her illness. If anything he is quite worried and searching her face for signs of what ails her. “Should I get a potion for you?”</p><p>Her eyes look into his with the help of the mirror. “Draco, there is no potion that can ease this.”</p><p>The tall reformed gentleman will not accept that answer and turns her away from the mirror by her shoulders so she is looking into his true eyes. “No, tell me what is wrong. Something must be done to comfort you.”</p><p>The color begins to return to her lips a tugs up into a half smile. “I’ll survive.”</p><p>“I know you will,” but he doesn’t smile back. It’s a hard statement of fact, “That’s not what I asked, though.”</p><p>Hermione softly wraps her hands around his narrow wrists gently pulling them off her shoulders. She is grateful that he allows her to break the contact. For that, she feels she must offer him some sort of answer. How to break the news that only a select few know?</p><p>Draco might let her break the contact, but he is not going to leave the room until he is sure she is truly going to be fine. When she sits back down on the bed resting her back to the headboard, he steps forward to help her tuck the coverings back up. The one piece slip she wore under her suit might have kept her discretely covered but it’s certainly isn’t warm enough for the morning chill of this room. If she is already sick, he doesn’t want her getting any worse on his account.</p><p>She tucks the coverings under her arm pits folding her hands into her lap. There she leaves her eyes on the tiny sparkling ring. “There’s another reason we rushed the wedding.”</p><p>Draco snorts turning the dressing chair backwards before straddling it. “Rushed? Come on Hermione, you and Ron should have married before even Potter. Everyone knows that!”</p><p>“We weren’t as perfect as everyone thought. He was easily jealous and intimidated. It could get to be a bit frustrating sometimes. A few times I was even ready to break it off completely and go my own way. But now…”</p><p>“’But now’ what?” He rests his chin on folded hands over her suit.</p><p>There‘s a long silent pause and then, “I’m…. pregnant,” she finally whispers not even lifting her eyes.</p><p>The shyness to her answer leaves him speechless. This was not at all what he was expecting. Basic protection had been covered in health class so it’s rare to hear of anyone of the wizarding world to become pregnant accidentally, let alone a couple as in love as Ron and Hermione to be shy about it.</p><p>“A baby?” Draco looks to where her hands softly lie against her belly He didn‘t notice anything last night so she must still be in the early stages. “Who knew?”<br/>
“Harry, Ron and Ginny. That was one of the other reasons we were going to wait to see my parents. Now, I just don’t know.” She takes a few more breaths then looks up to him. “How am I supposed to tell Ron’s parents I am carrying their bastard grandchild? How am I supposed to release the spell on my parents only to arrive home unwed and carrying a child and a an excuse that sounds like a bold faced lie? What am I going to do?” Then once more ashamed, she turns away when his chin starts to rise off his crossed wrists.</p><p>“Hermione…” the soft release of her name also has him rising off the chair.</p><p>“If you leave, I will get dressed and-”</p><p>“Go where?” He sinks to the bed by her feet. Not close enough to intrude on her space, but close enough to lay a soft hand to her covered ankle. “Stay.”</p><p>The auburn head of loose tendrils snaps back to look at him. “With you?”</p><p>Draco shrugs his elegant shoulders. “Why not? My parents are going to be away for a long time. This place is huge and it has a plenty to offer.”</p><p>“What do you want in return, Malfoy?” Her eyes narrow and nearly spits.</p><p>The long fingers pull back from her ankle to his own lap. Clenching his jaw he takes a deep breath and then pierces her wariness with all the truth he can project. “Nothing.”</p><p>“Why would a Slytherin ever give shelter and comfort to a Muggle-born Gryffindor ?”</p><p>Hermione knows that spitting in the face of one who has just offered her protection and shelter is probably not the smartest thing to do, but on the other hand, Draco Malfoy has had a tainted past with herself and her closest friends. He isn’t known for being the kindest of boys and certainly has made it clear how he feels about Muggles. Now with the power of being a man, he is even more dangerous. His father, mother, and aunt doing whatever they are up to, but where do his own loyalties lie now?</p><p>Yes she knows Harry would easily take her into his home, but he has Ginny and their own child on the way. The last thing they need are two more mouths. And yes the Weasley’s would probably always care for her, but honestly, she wants to be her own independent person like things would have been if she had broken up with Ron like she planned before she found out about the child.</p><p>Last of all, why would she want to be caught in a trap with a former Death Eater and a Malfoy at that!</p><p>The wizard who surpasses her own cunning skills stands up and steps back. Her verbal strike at him isn’t that surprising. He knew it would come sooner or later. In a way, he is very please it came now and he doesn’t have to wait any longer for it to happen. Still, it did sting a bit. For all the evil he had done in the past in the name of family and now here he is trying to help one of his own classmates, even going so far as to cross house-lines…</p><p>He shoves his fists into his robe’s pockets, “You are free to leave whenever you want. There is an elf just outside your door if you care for a meal before you leave.” With that said, he pulls his back up taught, and with his natural haughty pride, strides right out the door, closing it softly behind himself.</p><p>The elf who had brought the news to him earlier looks up to his master for further instructions. “Whatever she wants, take care of it,” Draco huffs the order out then silently strides back to his personal room to change. There will be no further sleep for him this morning, so mind as well get started on the day.</p><p>Hermione is left looking at a softly closed door. She’s angry but split on who she is angry at. Partly at Draco and his audacity to offer hospitality and not tell her up front what he wants in return. A Malfoy never does anything out of the kindness of their heart for they don’t even have hearts only desires for power and glory!</p><p>There’s where the other half of her anger rises: at herself. That was a bit harsh. She hasn’t seen or heard much of what Draco has done since the final battle and her graduation. It is a bit presumptuous of her to so easily dismiss that fact that he too could have changed. She witnessed it herself when his family turned their back. Yeah sure they fled, but they also did not assist the Dark Lord any further so they can’t be all bad right?</p><p>A nagging piece of her conscience is telling her to give Draco a break. To give him a chance. If nothing else to have a decent conversation with him and find out who he is without the influence of his family’s pressure.</p><p>Hermione looks down to her hand with the ring that Ron had given her in a promise to make a new life with her. Slowly she eases it off and sets it on the beside table. That promise is gone now leaving it up to her to decide what her future will be with out his influence. The pressure to keep him happy is off her shoulders now. No more wondering if saying something to someone else is going to make his jealousy flare up and cause more problems. From here on out, any problems that arise will be of her doing.</p><p>Sliding out of the bed she decides that there is one problem she should probably fix right now.</p><p>After a nice warm shower, a cleaning spell to her clothing, she redresses in her suit and makes her way to the door. She’s not surprised to see the elf Draco had left to attend to her. She gives him a smile, “Hello, could you ask your master if he would be willing to speak with me?”</p><p>The elf nods and dashes away. Hermione slowly makes her way down the hall that she did not see when she arrived last night.</p><p>She may not like the fact that there are still homes that use elves, but there is no reason to take it out on the elf himself. No, that discussion is for the master of the home that holds the power over them. Yes during school she had been on fire to stop the abuse of house elves. Now that she is an adult and there are more mature ways to handle things.</p><p>Hermione stops in mid stride going down the main staircase. Her naked left hand lays over her belly. There is going to be a new life she is going to be teaching her values to. A new life looking to her for direction.</p><p>“Ma’am, Master has asked me to lead you to his study if you would care to join him for a light breakfast.”</p><p>The mother-to-be lifts her head from her child to the large eyes of a small being at the foot of the stairs. “That would be kind of you. Thank you,” she makes her way down the steps.</p><p>Instead of starting her new life this morning as Mrs. Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger is starting her morning in Draco Malfoy’s home.</p>
