    <p>What are you willing to lose?<br/>
You cover your wounds, but underneath them<br/>
A million voices in your head that whisper, "Stop, now"</p><p>Another twist of the knife, turn of the screws<br/>
It's all in your mind and it's fighting you<br/>
Arm yourself, a storm is coming<br/>
Well, kid, what you gonna do now?</p><p>(See end notes for citation)</p><p>________</p><p>The Beginning</p><p>       They met in passing, an acknowledgment of magical strength on a battlefield at first. A curse was thrown at a death eater and Kai found it impressive in magical strength. She followed her instinct in finding who cast it. Kai proceeded to put up a shield for the one throwing a hex at yet another death eater. This boy clearly either had a death wish, or was oblivious to his own safety. Due to the boy protecting so many others Kai decided to try and keep an eye on his back, it would be a shame if his death caused a chain effect of many.</p><p>       Kai has multiple magical peculiarities due to her life’s circumstances. Her family is an ancient and very powerful bloodline. They are very far from being a “pure blood” line due to all the muggle borns married in, the humanoid creatures married in, and the occasional minor god/goddess or demigod/demigoddess mixed in as well. This makes them very strong and the magical community respects and fears them, even if they don’t agree with their lifestyle. Due to this unconventional lifestyle Kai underwent three magical inheritances by the age of 15. For a normal witch this would be way too much and the sheer magical strength would tear their body apart. The line of Thunderflame is well known for their beastial qualities. From the age of 2 all legitimate children undergo a creature inheritance. Kai is also a learned Metamorphmagus like Harry Potter’s Auror friend Tonks. She doesn't change her appearance much besides the color of her hair most the time. She likes her appearance, but everyone gets insecure sometimes. This learned skill is also good for stealth ops, such as wandering around in public during a war. Kai is also forced to endure extreme physical training so her body can handle the sheer magical power she contains as part of the Thunderflame line. Not all the training was weightlifting and endurance, she also got to play sports like dance and gymnastics, and learned muggle fighting styles like Krav Maga and Tai Chi.</p><p>       Harry also has great magical strength due to his life of survival. His destiny of saving the magical community of Great Britain from the dark lord who marked him as his equal. This life of destiny *coph Dumledore’s manipulations coph* put him through great magical training since his early childhood with the abusive Dursleys. He also contained a soul shard in his forehead scar, which was always draining on his magic growing up. This shard was an unintentional Horcrux made by Voldemort. Harry Potter was also shockingly strong for all his stunted growth. Harry had to run from his cousin and company as a child, then played Quidditch at Hogwarts. His strength was accumulated from years of surviving attacks from Voldemort and all the tests Dumbledore put him through. Harry was forced to be creative if he wanted to win this war as a child soldier against well trained adult death eaters out for his blood. He also had his best friend Hermione to thank for making him learn lots of different magics.</p><p>       After the brutal and bloody battle was over and Harry Potter’s army of children stood as the obvious winners, Kai and Harry shook hands. The battle would be known as the Battle of Carnage and the official end of the war. Kai introduces herself to the boy with wild magic and extreme concentration to protect his friends. Kai noticed during the battle how this strange boy had a total lack of self preservation beyond blocking and dodging spells sent his way. </p><p>***</p><p>       “Er... Hi. I’m Harry Potter.”</p><p>       Taken aback, Kai does not bother to hide her surprise. She was shaking hands with Lady Magik’s chosen hero.</p><p>       “Um, Hello.” looking at this small boy covered in scars she reevaluates the situation. “My name is Kai Thunderflame.”</p><p>       Harry Potter thought everyone knew who he was so when he introduced himself he didn't expect this girl to be so surprised. He figured this girl knew exactly who he was, and was expecting something from him, or rather wanted to shake hands with the boy-who-lived and all that rot.</p><p>       Kai on the other hand (lol puns because they were shaking hands) didn’t read the tabloids due to all the absurd propaganda, not to mention it was bloody depressing due to the war and the many deaths always being the main topic. This means Kai had never really looked at Harry Potter's face plastered on all the newspapers. Scrying is Kai’s prefered method of updating herself on current events. Scrying is not only a tool for divination, it can also be used as an informative tool of the goings on in the world present and past; not to mention, it is far more accurate than attempting to look at the ever shifting future.</p><p>	Harry Potter did not think he saw any alternative motives in this girl’s face and decided he didn’t dislike this girl, who fought beside him in the battle against death eaters. She didn’t look at him with the over hyped awe everyone else seemed to these days. He didn’t want to be put on a pedestal and treated like some kind of savior.</p><p>       With a shy smile that made Kai tilt her head to the side, Harry Potter began speaking once more. </p><p>       “It’s nice to meet you Kai, but um… Can I have my hand back now? Please?”</p><p>	“Oh! Of course,” Blushing at the awkward situation, “Sorry about that.” Kai realised then why Lady Magik had chosen this boy. The kindness she saw in his face, after all he had been put through, was astounding. This boy was amazing. Kai smiled apologetically, rubbing the back of her neck.</p><p>	“Not to offend you or anything,” Kai began, and Harry could already feel the disappointment as he expected her to say something along the lines of ‘you're not what I expected.’</p><p>	“But you have a ridiculous lack of self preservation. It's a miracle you've survived this long.”</p><p>	Harry’s brain stutters to a stop. “Er, wait. What?” he didn’t think he heard that quite right.</p><p>	“It is amazing that you are still alive Mr. Potter. You seem to have little to no sense of self preservation.” Kai felt bad about scolding him, but if she hadn’t been in that battle with him, she didn’t think he'd still be standing here in front of her.</p><p>	Harry Potter could not believe his ears. This strange girl awkwardly blushing and shifting from foot to foot in discomfort was actually scolding him for the very same thing everyone else praises him for, for diving into danger and throwing himself in front of everyone else. He was meant to be on the front lines. He was considered brave.</p><p>	“Most people just praise me for my bravery.” Harry manages to say.</p><p>	That made Kai look at his face more intently, she didn’t like what that insinuated. Kai is aware this boy was one in a million chosen by Magik herself, but he still deserved to be protected like every other child.</p><p>	“Bravery doesn’t mean protecting everyone else but yourself, in a war that never should have happened. You might be special, but you’re still just a normal human witch.” Pausing a moment to rein in a rant she could feel coming on, she took a deep breath. “Merlin himself even had a sense of self preservation. All I'm saying is you’re not immortal. Hopefully this is the last battle you’ll ever have to fight, but if it’s not, I highly recommend protecting your own skin a little more. Next time I might not be there to do it for you.”</p><p>	In that moment a gentle ball of glowing golden light emanated between them. This was the universal sign of an acknowledged life debt. Harry had it happen many times before, having saved many people in the war. However, this time the life debt was not his to collect, it was Kai’s. This strange girl really had saved his life at least once.  </p><p>       Looking up from the acknowledgment of a life debt at Harry’s face as the light faded, Kai began to speak once more. “Voldemort may have been killed at the Battle of Hogwarts, but clearly this battle proves the war was not yet over. Hopefully this was the last of it truly. But if this is not the end, you really shouldn’t be so negligent of your own safety.” As far as the Aurors who arrived late to the Battle of Carnage know, this was the rest of the death eaters attempting one last desperate battle for change in the war’s end result. </p><p>       Quietly Kai tried not to push, as Harry had begun to look a little ashamed, “As a person so many have a great respect for and at such a young age, you shouldn’t be so reckless is all I'm trying to say.”</p><p>       “Thank you. No one ever really thinks of me as a person just like them.” Harry felt a warmth forming in his chest, he felt like he could really become friends with this girl who didn’t treat him like the-boy-who-lived but rather just Harry. It's all he ever really wanted. Even Ron and Hermione sometimes did the whole treating him like a savior act. It was all so exhausting.</p><p>       Parting ways to help clean up some of the damage done and collecting the wounded and dead, Harry made the decision to find Kai again and maybe get to know her a little better.</p><p>***</p><p>       “Hey Thunderflame! Wait up.” Harry called out as he passed people who had been willing to volunteer their help after the battle. Most people were getting around to go home, or what was left of them anyway. Kai was carrying a tray full of medical supplies to help the injured not hurt badly enough to get sent to the overcrowded hospitals but still injured enough to need medical attention.</p><p>       “Hello Mr. Potter. Would you like to help me?” Kai gestured to the bag full of bandages sitting on the tent floor. </p><p>       Harry picked it up and proceeded to follow Kai to the Mediwitch calling for the supplies. Once receiving what she wanted she shooed the young adults away so she could concentrate on her work. There wasn’t much more for the two to help with since they didn’t have a healing licence and therefore shouldn’t be performing dangerous healing spells on anyone.</p><p>       Exiting the medical tent the two walked over to the conjured benches meant for people to relax on. Many people were drained and still processing the brutal battle they just experienced.</p><p>       “So um, did you want to talk about something Mr. Potter?” Kai gently inquired as the two got comfortable. </p><p>       “Er…” Sorta blushing Harry figured the conversation would be more comfortable if it was a bit less formal. “You can just call me Harry. We did just fight a battle together and you saved my life.”</p><p>       “Oh!” Though a little surprised, Kai figured that made sense. “I suppose that does make a bit of sense. In that case you may call me Kai.”</p><p>        “Sure. Kai it is then.” Harry shifted in his seat then decided to just get right to it then. “Thank you. For saving my life and treating me like a normal person. This might sound strange but there aren’t many who talk to me like I’m just like anyone else.”</p><p>       “Of course. And it doesn't sound strange to me at all actually. Many people are afraid of me due to my powerful magical aura that it can sometimes be exhausting. I tend to hide the majority of it just to walk around like anyone else.”</p><p>	As the two chat in quiet voices they find they have a lot in common and start to bond. The two like the basic comfort of being with another misfit. </p><p>	“Why are you fighting in this war if you’re from Northern Ireland? That's not exactly part of the United Kingdom. This war isn’t as close to home for you. Why force yourself to be a part of something so unpleasant?” </p><p>	“Some of my family members go to Hogwarts. During the war they were pulled out and brought home. I didn’t like the way that made me feel. My cousins really seemed to like Hogwarts, and while they were home away from the violence they worried about their friends who were not as fortunate.” After a pause of contemplation Kai continued, “One of my little cousin’s friends died in the battle of Hogwarts. His name was Creevey. Colin Creevey. And it broke his heart that he could do nothing to protect him so far away. One night I packed up a small travel bag and left. I did some scrying and hoped to see if there was anything I could do to help. Shortly after my search started, this battle broke out and I knew that if I joined I could die, but if I didn’t other little Colin Creeveys so to speak probably would die. So I decided to fight in the child army led by one Harry Potter. I had no idea that I’d actually meet you. As that was not my intention. I just wanted to save those who may not be strong enough to make it out of the battle on their own.”</p><p>	Harry sat there in quiet contemplation. He had no reason to believe Kai was lying, and she seemed genuinely upset about the death of the young student who used to love taking his picture. Colin always had a smile for him. </p><p>	“I also want you to know,” Kai broke the silence that hung between them, “I have no intention of taking advantage of you. With the life debt and all. I didn’t save you for some selfish knowledge that Harry Potter would owe me one. I just didn’t another child soldier to die in this stupid war.” She fell silent yet again this time looking at his face clearly hoping he believed her.</p><p>	That decided it for him, Harry Potter was going to trust this strange quiet girl in front of him and he truly hoped they could become friends.</p><p>	“Kai?” Harry started, not really sure how to go about this. So in his usual blunt manner, “would you like to come over for dinner tonight? I mean I’d like to be your friend. Err… And um. Well eating dinner together is something friends do, so would you? Like to eat dinner with me, that is?”</p><p>	Kai smiled brilliantly at him and Harry knew he didn’t mess it up this time. She nodded and started to stand up. “Do I need to get cleaned up or is my post battle attire acceptable?”</p><p>	Harry smiled back, “You are fine the way you so long as you’re comfortable with it.”</p><p>	“Brilliant!” Kai held out her arm, “Shall we go? I believe our usefulness here has expired and I am honestly famished.” </p><p>	Harry reached out and took it. Apparating away to number 12 Grimmuwald place, Harry’s only place he has left to call home now.</p>
