    <p>The funeral service had been beautiful. </p><p>It started first in an ancient, limestone cathedral hidden away from the muggle world in a forest just outside of Bristol. The pews had been heavy with attendance. The grey and watery light, pebbled rainbow by the stained-glass beyond the black casket, painted somber faces with jades and violets. White and brown flowers had hung from every flat surface. </p><p>It ends now, at a quiet, ageless graveyard, where the dirt is a colorless black and the tombstones are all a blinding, bone white. The casket has since been lowered into its plot, the dirt securely returned to its rightful place. They who have been buried made one with the Earth as all must be. Placed gently beside their partner, as close as a kiss. A yard over from their child, all three of them too quickly put beneath the ground. </p><p>It is Draco Malfoy’s twentieth funeral.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Andromeda Druella Tonks</em><br/>
<em>November 8, 1951-September 29, 2000</em><br/>
<em>Homo sum humani a me nihil alienum puto. </em>
</p><p>“I am a human being, so nothing human is strange to me.” Draco whispers, his breath slipping from his mouth in a white phantom, ghosting towards the gravestone as though to bless it with the translation. “Wiser words could not have been chosen to grace your grandmother’s tomb.” </p><p>Draco hikes his cousin further up his hip, and encourages the boy with two gentle fingers on his chin to meet his eyes. Edward’s appearance conveys his mood, his eyes heavily-lidded and a deep black, his hair limp and grey. He’s confused, somber. </p><p>“Grand’Mere no come back.” Edward says in return, and Draco nods. </p><p>No, indeed. Andromeda is not coming back. Draco’s eyes flit once more to his Aunt’s tombstone, and he feels the familiar jackals of grief nip impatiently at his heels. </p><p>He hadn’t known Andromeda for long, just since the war, when he had nowhere else to turn to. With the Manor’s foreclosure and his parents mutual life-sentence in Azkaban, she’d been his only kin and only willing refuge. These last two years of company with Andromeda has taught Draco more than twenty with his mother and father ever did. It hurts all the more profoundly to realize this. </p><p>“That’s right, Edward. I won’t lie to you.” Draco sighs, adjusting the downy, white blanket he’d thrown around the toddler before they’d apparated from the church. The boy’s cheeks are getting red from the approaching frigidity in the air. </p><p>“Well, she’s not entirely gone, now is she?” </p><p>Draco stops his finnicky ministrations, and scowls. He’d sworn they were the only ones still left. He’d waited patiently until the Weasleys and everyone else had paid their respects. Now the bloody worst of them all is here. </p><p>“Harry!” Edward exclaims, wiggling in Draco’s hold until he is forced to set him down, rolling up the blanket at once to keep it from the freezing, black muck. Draco almost laughs at the sight of it. He wouldn’t be surprised if that’s what his insides look like. </p><p>Finally, Draco swallows his pride and brings his eyes up from the ground to settle instead on Harry Potter. He’s dressed smartly in a muggle suit and a black dress robe. His hair is even tamed beneath a genderless, grey headband. He picks Edward up with a smile that rivals the tenacity of the sun, though it hides behind the clouds today. Just as the smile doesn’t reach Potter’s eyes. </p><p>“Teddy, Andromeda will always be with you. Here.” Potter tells him gently, pressing a long, spindly finger against Edward’s chest. Draco rolls his eyes. </p><p>“In my heart?” Edward asks in a small, wet voice, and Potter nods his head and ruffles the boy’s hair. As soon as Potter’s hand slips away, Teddy’s grey waves melt into a recognizable, raven mess.</p><p>“Yes, Edward.” Draco relents, stepping around Andromeda’s grave. The closer he gets, the more vibrant the green of Potter’s eyes become. They always look so much greener than they are on days like this, when the sky promises a proper storm. <br/>
Edward says nothing else, just lays his heavy head on Potter’s shoulder. Draco knows he’ll be asleep within the minute. He and Potter stare at Andromeda’s grave as they wait, the silence growing tenser by the second. </p><p>“How are we going to do this, Malfoy?” Potter whispers, arms tightening around the slumbering, little boy. Draco pinches the bridge of his nose, and heaves a great sigh. Leave it to Potter to skip the niceties, even here on the same day as his Aunt’s funeral. </p><p>“I don’t know, Potter. You’re his godfather. You could take him from me permanently if you wished, and no one would fault you.” Draco tries and fails to conceal the crack in his voice. There’s nothing Draco wouldn’t do to keep Edward Lupin in his life, and the fear of losing him is all-encompassing. Though as used to that feeling as he is. </p><p>Potter makes a disapproving noise. </p><p>“I wouldn’t do that to you, Malfoy. The two of you are blood, as meaningless as that is these days.” Potter promises, stepping in front of Malfoy to meet his eyes. There’s a conviction in his gaze, and already the heavy cloak of fatherhood seems to have lipped over his shoulders like a gargoyle. Draco feels one of his own.  </p><p>“Thank you.” Draco relents.</p><p>“I’ve got a pushchair in my bag, why don’t we go to a cafe? Speak of it there.” Draco catches Potter's eyes again, and this time there’s an earnest defeat about them. </p><p>Draco’s answer comes in way of another sigh, defeat of his own in place now. No, Draco supposes, there would be nothing wrong with a simple cup of tea with Harry Potter. </p><p>Anything for Edward Lupin. </p>
