  <strong>July 1997, Rosevale Manor</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>What wouldn't I give for some butterbeer…</em>
</p><p>Ginny perused her options carefully. On the pink silk-draped table were a variety of wines, champagnes, and mixed margaritas and cocktails, all set in beautifully engraved glasses. She had already tried the Veela wine, the dewberry champagne, and the lemongrass-fire margarita, all of which she rated somewhere between 'wouldn't drink to save my life' and 'might use to put out a fire'.</p><p><em>But of course, I shouldn't expect the biggest party of the year to have anything so low-class as </em>butterbeer.<em> Not when Daphne Greengrass is throwing it.</em></p><p>With a sigh, Ginny plucked a tall glass of a fizzy purple champagne and turned back to the dance floor. The main hall of Rosevale Manor was flooded with purebloods in their most aristocratic silks, posh accents ringing with fake laughter in every corner, and a flurry of dancing in the middle of the floor, mostly from the Slytherins.</p><p>
  <em>Only Slytherins enjoy Slytherin parties, after all. Although I suppose my date is enjoying it more than me, since he's nowhere to be found.</em>
</p><p>Scanning the room, she finally found said date enconsced in a corner with – was that Anthony Goldstein and Parvati Patil? And Neville Longbottom as well, all four of them whispering quietly to each other.</p><p><em>So, a Dumbledore's Army meeting. </em>Ginny swallowed the champagne – it wasn't quite as bad as the dewberry, but nowhere near as good as some old-fashioned firewhiskey. <em>He could have asked me. It's not like I wasn't there at the Department of Mysteries, too. Unlike Goldstein and Parvati…</em></p><p>
  <em>I shouldn't be bitter. He invited me here in the first place. And didn't I tell him I just wanted to see how the other half lives?</em>
</p><p>The answer to that question was, of course, 'magnificently'. Other than the Potters' own home manor of Queenswood, Ginny had never stepped foot in a house as ostentatiously pureblood as Rosevale Manor, home to the Greengrasses. Of course, Queenswood was kept homey and warm, despite its size. Rosevale loomed above her, an entity of gold and treasure. Her bedroom could probably fit in one of their bathrooms.</p><p>
  <em>I thought I'd moved past jealousy, but this is just excessive. And of course, they have to flaunt it for everyone under the guise of a birthday party. Wouldn't be purebloods if they didn't.</em>
</p><p>The purebloods in question, the elder Greengrasses, were standing in the other room, where the adults were gathered while the teenagers partied on the dance floor. She had spotted Nathan and Olivia Greengrass on her way in, the matriarch of the family resplendent in their House colors of forest green and bronze, and thoroughly felt the blood traitor stink-eye they'd given her.</p><p>
  <em>Their fault for inviting the Boy Who Lived, anyway. They're lucky Hermione couldn't come, or they'd have to deal with a muggleborn instead of just a blood traitor.</em>
</p><p>Her eye finally caught those of her date, and she raised her glass of champagne at him invitingly. Tristan Potter flashed her a smile – she knew this one, it was his most charming, the one he used on teachers all the time to get out of trouble – and then resumed his whispered conversation with Neville.</p><p>Ginny sighed. <em>What did I expect? He's a leader in an enemy zone. He's not here for romance or wine-tasting.</em></p><p>But her heart still sped up when she looked out at the dance floor and imagined Tristan twirling her onto it, right next to Daphne and Theodore Nott's smug faces. Though her blue dress was nowhere near as beautiful as Daphne's silver and green gown, she thought she had managed quite well with what she had.</p><p>"You know, the alcoholic content of mermaid champagne is actually pretty low."</p><p>Ginny jumped and whirled around. Green eyes set on a smirking face looked back at her, paired with the unmisteakable dark, messy hair and lightning bolt scar of the brother of her date – Harry Potter.</p><p>"Is that what this is?" she asked, lifting up her glass to look at it. "I thought mermaid champagne was blue."</p><p>"It comes in a variety of colors." Harry stepped around her to pick up a drink for himself, a glass of deep red wine. "But if you're looking to get drunk, I would try the wine."</p><p>Ginny narrowed her eyes at him. "Are you <em>trying</em> to get me drunk, Potter?"</p><p>"Don't flatter yourself. I know how you Gryffindors are about your alcohol." With a significant pause, he glanced over at his brother, who was currently laughing at some joke one of his friends had said. "The more the merrier, right?"</p><p>Not that he was wrong, but just to avoid admitting it, Ginny took another swig of the mermaid champagne. "I suppose being the brother of the Boy Who Lived makes you an expert on all things Gryffindor, right?"</p><p>Her eyes lingered pointedly on his green tie, the antithesis to his brother's red. Harry tugged on it once and grinned at her, as if she'd said something incredibly funny.</p><p>"It's not like Gryffindors are a particularly confusing species." Harry downed a gulp of his wine, then added, before she could retort, "I notice your brother isn't here. Or Hermione. Aren't they my brother's usual hanger-ons?"</p><p>Ginny shrugged nonchalantly. "Weasleys weren't invited. Too traitorous for these purebloods. He asked Hermione to be his plus-one, but she was going to Spain with her parents. Which left me."</p><p>Harry nodded. "Second choice. Must feel nice."</p><p>"Oh, fuck off, Potter," she sighed. "I didn't ask for your company. Why are you here? Don't <em>you</em> have a date?"</p><p>"I do." Harry lifted a hand and waved at someone on the dance floor. Ginny followed his line of sight and found Luna Lovegood, dancing an odd jig by herself, wearing an olive-green dress that flared around her knees as she spun in circles. "She seems to be enjoying herself, at least."</p><p>Ginny eyed him. "Isn't Daphne one of your best friends? You're not enjoying her birthday party? Her <em>debutante ball</em>, as the invitation put it?"</p><p>"She knows I hate parties."</p><p>"Your birthday's coming up," Ginny pointed out. "Tristan's having a huge party. Not for you?"</p><p>"Nah, I was thinking me and Blaise would just go out and get blackout drunk," Harry said, smirking again. "Beats hopping around the manor pretending I know how to dance."</p><p>"How festive," she muttered. "No wonder they call you the fun brother."</p><p>"Don't knock it till you've tried it," Harry said, raising his glass of wine towards her in a mock toast. "You haven't gone drinking until you've gone drinking with Slytherins."</p><p>"Tempting, but I'm going to have to pass." Ginny flicked her ponytail over her shoulder and looked around for a distraction. Tristan was still busy with his friends, of course. She supposed she could go talk to Luna, who was far more pleasant company than her date.</p><p>
  <em>Although… he could've brought any old Slytherin girl. Why would he pick Luna Lovegood? I'm sure Daphne's not a huge fan of Loony from Ravenclaw…</em>
</p><p>"How come you brought a DA member, Potter?" she asked, curious in spite of herself. "Luna's great, but I didn't think she was your type."</p><p>Harry snorted. "We're here as friends. Am I not allowed to fraternize with Dumbledore's Army?"</p><p>"Just thought you'd want to keep up your reputation as the scary, evil Slytherin brother," Ginny teased.</p><p>"Is that what you think of me?" Harry pressed a hand to his chest. "I'm hurt, Ginny."</p><p>"Please." Ginny rolled her eyes. "You love it. There's a reason you only have two friends."</p><p>"Hey, I have three friends," he protested. "If you include Luna."</p><p>Ginny opened her mouth to retort, but was cut short by someone loudly clearing their throat from center stage. All eyes turned to the middle of the room, where a path cleared for Nathan and Olivia Greengrass, both of them smiling beatifically at their audience.</p><p>"Today," said Nathan, his voice ringing clear over all the noise, "we are here to celebrate my eldest daughter and heiress' coming of age. On this night, Daphne Violetta Greengrass becomes a witch of seventeen years, and a woman in her own right."</p><p>He extended a hand to his wife, who took it and offered the other to her daughter. Daphne climbed up the steps and took her place at her mother's side, beaming around at everyone. They made quite a picture – Nathan, in his silver robes, Olivia with her green and bronze gown, and Daphne glowing in silver and green silk.</p><p>For the first time, Ginny noticed the emerald pendant dangling at her neck, glinting off the chandelier lights.</p><p>
  <em>A quintessentially pureblood birthday gift… Ron got a watch. I shouldn't be ungrateful.</em>
</p><p>But it was hard not to be jealous as Olivia spoke of Daphne's beauty and grace, what a pleasure she was to the community – <em>their community, pureblood community, Death Eater community</em> – and how she excelled in school.</p><p>"I thank you all for being here today," Daphne said when her mother finished, her voice clear and beautiful, words lilted by her posh accent. Her blond curls cascaded down her back, brown eyes bright. She looked like a princess.</p><p>Ginny glanced sidelong at Harry, who was focused on the stage. <em>What I don't understand is how she and Harry are so close… they couldn't possibly be more different.</em></p><p>At her other side, Luna appeared without warning, as if summoned from thin air, and whispered, "It's a beautiful ceremony, isn't it? So many Blue-Winged Traibells fluttering around. Daphne ought to be careful, though, because they love causing mischief as much as they love beauty."</p><p>Ginny nodded absentmindedly. "Yeah, she should be careful."</p><p>She found Tristan in the crowd, also watching Daphne on the stage, although with much less fondness than his twin brother. <em>Another thing I have never understood, in seven years of knowing them – how different can two brothers be?</em></p><p>Tristan caught her eye and made a face. Ginny quickly covered her mouth to stop herself from giggling and interrupting Daphne's speech.</p><p>"My dear," Nathan Greengrass was saying when she tuned back in, "we are honored, today, to place the House of Greengrass in your hands. You will be our heiress, our future, and the guardian of our home. In time, you will create a new family, and bring fresh blood into our House. Do you accept this honor?"</p><p>"I do," said Daphne solemnly, placing one hand in her father's palm and the other in her mother's.</p><p>"Why does this sound like a wedding?" Ginny murmured under her breath, either to Luna or to Harry, she didn't particularly care.</p><p>It was Harry who answered. "Because it is one. Or, an engagement at the very least. Watch."</p><p>"I ask Theodore Nott to join me on stage," Daphne said, dropping her parents' hands – and now sporting a new bracelet, which Ginny had missed her getting, a silver-and-pearl chain. "And share with me my first dance as heiress to the House of Greengrass."</p><p>Theodore Nott emerged from the crowd, a smirk on his face, no doubt at having been chosen above all the other eligible pureblood bachelors in Daphne's year. He wore his brown hair slicked back and a silver tie to complement Daphne's dress over his black suit. From his pocket, he removed another bracelet, this one of gold and emeralds, and slid it onto her bare wrist.</p><p>"I would be honored," he said, with a sweeping bow, before offering Daphne his arm. She beamed, accepted his hand, and let him spin her back onto the dance floor, everyone else backing away to give them the whole floor to themselves.</p><p>"So… now they're stuck with each other," Ginny mused, watching them dance as the music swelled around them. <em>I have to admit, they do make a good-looking couple, in that pointy-faced snooty pureblood way.</em> "Forever."</p><p>"Nothing's forever," Luna said. "But if they don't marry in the year after they graduate, the Jagbats will surely eat their homes."</p><p>"Surely," Ginny agreed. She glanced over at Harry to see him smiling. "What's so funny, Potter?"</p><p>"Nothing." He raised his glass – he'd gotten a new one, this one a blue-green cocktail of some sort – to take a sip. "I suppose this custom's fallen out among some families – like yours. And mine, I guess. But the Greengrasses are very traditional."</p><p>"What, you won't be having your own debutante ball later this month?" Ginny challenged. "You <em>are</em> the heir, aren't you?"</p><p>"I find myself lacking a fiancée," Harry said dryly. "Unless Luna wants to marry me."</p><p>"Oh, no," Luna said with a sigh. "You're very interesting, Harry, but I'm afraid the Lightbreaking Swivennes living in your scar aren't at all compatible with me."</p><p>Harry snapped his fingers. "Damn those Swivennes."</p><p>Ginny smiled at Luna. "You're dodging a bullet here. I heard a rumor he feeds girls he doesn't like to the Whomping Willow."</p><p>"That's right," Harry said solemnly. Luna giggled. "Better run fast or you'll be bark-bait."</p><p>Before Ginny could analyze the odd sensation of actually enjoying Harry Potter's company, the chandelier lights flickered and went out. The room sank into pitch black darkness. For a second, nobody breathed.</p><p>Then somebody screamed. Ginny snapped her wand out; on both sides she could see Luna and Harry doing the same by the Lumos spell she had cast. Pinpricks of light from others' wands appeared, but not before the unmistakable sound of –</p><p>"<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!"</p><p>The green light rushed towards her.</p><p>Ginny stared at it, wand trembling in her hands.</p><p>At the last second, two arms wrapped around her and shoved her to the ground.</p><p>The spell went whizzing by and a body hit the floor behind her. Ginny couldn't breathe, her throat closing up. Harry was still on top of her, shielding her with his body, one hand pressed to her mouth so she wouldn't inadvertantly make a sound.</p><p>More screaming. She could see flashes of red and blue – defense spells – and hear Tristan's voice yelling for her. But even if Harry had moved his hand, she couldn't speak.</p><p>
  <em>Someone tried to kill me.</em>
</p><p>Luna knelt down by the two of them, somehow unperturbed by the chaos. She passed something small to Harry and whispered, "I'll be fine. Go, quickly."</p><p>The next thing she knew was the compression of the world around her and the portkey taking them far, far away.</p>
