    <p>Over and over Harry had to write the same sentence until it filled the whole sheet of parchment. Halfway through, the mirrored words on the back of his hand stopped vanishing after each line. It burned and itched horribly. And then it was finally over, hopefully Umbridge would let him go now.</p><p>"I'm finished." He looked up at her, looked at her holding her wand in her stumpy fingers. She stood up and walked to him.</p><p>"Show me your hand Mr. Potter." She said in her sickly-sweet voice. She looked at it, then clucked. "Now I think it is time for us to talk, please come to my desk. Tea, Mr. Potter?"</p><p>"Ah, no, thank you." What did she want now? Talk about what?</p><p>"So, after this ... punishment, have you reconsidered your opinion on He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?"</p><p>What? "No, he's back! I saw him come back." Oh no, here went his temper again. And that after what McGonagall advised him.</p><p>Umbridge drew in a sharp breath, Harry looked closely at her, she seemed to be taken aback, maybe even shocked.</p><p>"If it is as you say, Mr. Potter, then you will be surely up to the task of giving more details on that encounter."</p><p>He can't do that, she was an enemy, but his body seemed to act on its own. He told her everything, from where Cedric and he touched the Cup to their return. From time to time Umbridge asked him to clarify something and he followed, it was terrifying to lose control like that. But the weirdest part of that conversation must have been her unsurprised face when Harry told her Voldemort's true name. Her response had been just as strange.</p><p>"I was some years under Tom Riddle, and when the same people flocked around He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named who surrounded Tom Riddle in school... Well, it makes one suspicious."</p><p>And it wasn't only that Umbridge's voice had lost the sickly-sweet tone, which was strange enough, but that she sounded as if she believed Harry.</p><p>"What did you do to me?" He asked her as soon as he could, after he told her everything from all his encounters with Voldemort (she had asked him to tell everything involving Him at some point), which was hours later. At some point he even began to drink her tea, his throat had been that starched.</p><p>“Nothing illegal, I assure you, Mr. Potter.” Her eyes were dark and her smile cruel. “A Blood Quill – which you just used – can form temporary contract between people. A contract that is in effect as long as the sentence written is visible on the hand of one of the contractors. Here, use that salve on the hand, then the words will vanish.” Desperately Harry uses the salve even as Umbridge talked on. “Curiously nobody has ever thought to forbid using a Blood Quill on one’s students.” The angry red welts on his hand vanished as he applied some salve. “Now, Mr. Potter, I have one last question for you. I know you and Headmaster Dumbledore have not seen each other since the beginning of the school year, so – How has he arranged your training?”</p><p>“What training? There is no training?” He was too surprised to even think about lying.</p><p>“No training whatsoever.” She coughs. “Tch, I didn’t think Dumbledore to be such a fool. Riddle is very obsessive, it is one of the most obvious traits of his personality. He is back, and you managed to flee, as such he will hunt you. And Dumbledore gives you no training.”</p><p>Still somewhat angry at Dumbledore because he ignored Harry at his trial, he kept silent.</p><p>“Well, Mr. Potter, this detention is over, be sure to remember to come tomorrow at the same time.”</p>
