    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p><p class="p2">Gretel was bored.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her brother was drunk, and his face was between big tits.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Gretel sighed and swallowed down her beer and looked around. They were in a tavern of a small village, searching for some ugly witches they could kill. But today... today they taking a break. It was their third evening and no sign of any witches.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She looked around for a woman.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There were too many drunken men, and too many filthy whores.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Yes, she was looking for a woman. No infection...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She was about to give up, when her eyes met the most beautifull woman in this shitty tavern.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She wore a white blouse and a corsette that pushed up two perfect round breasts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And she was looking at Gretel.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She almost stared at the witch hunter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Gretel felt her arousal rising.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She felt the growing heat.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She felt her own wetness.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The woman got up and approached Gretel. She passed a whore sucking on a man's dick.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She stopped infront of Gretel.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her sun kissed skin matched her dark brown eyes, and her long black hair fell down her back.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She took the jar out of Gretel‘s hand, and without lowering her gaze, she took Gretel‘s hand, and pulled her down the chair.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„Take me to your room...“ the woman whispered, and Gretel obligated without a single word, and without hesitation.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She knew what that woman wanted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And she wanted it too...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Gretel closed the door to her room, and looked at the woman.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„What‘s your name...?“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„I go by many names... but tonight, it doesn‘t matter...“ she said, and opened her corsette, and also pulled of her blouse.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„You are so beautifull...“ Gretel whispered, and cupped the woman‘s breasts in her warm hands, and leaned in to take one of her nipples in her mouth....</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">~&lt;•&gt;~</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Muriel was bored and she watched all those horny, needy, weak, pathetic humans.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She wanted some fun tonight.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Far away from her coven, and then she saw her...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She watched her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She watched her brother, that drunk prick. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was disgusting, throwing himself at every whore‘s breast.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She had deserved some fun tonight.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course Muriel knew them. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Muriel knew their story, but that witch hunter with her brown staring eyes was... hot...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">~&lt;•&gt;~ •• ~&lt;•&gt;~ ~&lt;•&gt;~ •• ~&lt;•&gt;~</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">{Many years later}</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She walked through a crowd of hundret of witches, and her eyes were fixed on Muriel who was sitting like a queen on a throne-like chair.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">None of the witches were touching her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">None of them would dare to touch her without Muriel‘s permission...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„You followed my invitation?“ Muriel asked, when Gretel stopped infront of her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„I wouldn‘t call it invitation when a hand is wrapped around my throat and I am hanging in the middle of the air.“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Muriel smirked: „But you came.“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„What do you want, witch?!“ Gretel nearly spat, and Muriel got up, and stepped closer.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„Talking.“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„Are you fucking kidding?!“ Gretel asked and added: „I should kill you...“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„Perhaps you should do that... but think about our night... think about the way I touched you... think about the way... you pushed your face between my legs....“ Muriel purred, and Gretel sighed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„Think about the way I took your inocent...“ Muriel whispered and briefly touched Gretel‘s ear.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„Are you getting wet, my sweet hunter...?“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„No...“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Muriel laughed, and licked Gretel‘s ear, and earned a moan. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„And you are sure-”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">„I want you...“ Gretel finally said, and was surprised by her own words.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She looked in Muriel‘s eyes, and repeated herself: „I want you... I want to be yours... I want to be your secret...“</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
