    <p dir="ltr">      Rubeus clutched his pink floral umbrella tightly as he waved to the tiny wizard on the platform.  He wished Da were coming with him to Hogwarts; Da could always make him feel better. Even the jeers about his size didn’t hurt as much when Da was around.</p><p dir="ltr">    “More of you to love,” Da always said with a fond smile.</p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus towered over the other kids in the train corridor.  He tried not to bump into anyone, but it was difficult in such a tight space.  He passed car after car, looking for someplace to sit. Eventually, he found an empty seat.</p><p dir="ltr">    He lay the umbrella beside him and dug in his pockets for his knitting.  Knitting always made him feel better and if he kept it up, the sweater would be ready for Da by Christmas.  It was a deep green, but he was planning on putting in horizontal pink stripes once he had knit a good amount from the hem.</p><p dir="ltr">    No other students came into the cart and he sat in a silence broken only by the clicking of knitting needles.  He could hear the other students in nearby cabins as the conductor called out “All Aboard!”</p><p dir="ltr">    The train started moving and still no one came in.  He sat contentedly knitting, occasionally looking out the window though he knew it would be hours before his first glimpse of the castle.</p><p dir="ltr">Rubeus’s trunk wiggled as the creature within struggled to get out.</p><p dir="ltr">“Shhhh, sh, sh,” Hagrid said to the trunk, eyeing the cabin to see if anyone would notice if he tried to slip the creature a treat.  Who wouldn’t be upset at being locked in a box?</p><p dir="ltr">“Is that a first year?!” a muffled voice asked from outside the cabin door.  </p><p dir="ltr">    “He must be; I’ve never seen him before.”</p><p dir="ltr">    “He’s huge!”</p><p dir="ltr">    “Probably got held back home or something.  Big and dumb.”</p><p dir="ltr">    “Maybe he’s a squib!”</p><p dir="ltr">    They all laughed as they continued down the hall of the train car.</p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus pulled his wand from where he’d stashed it in his boot top.  Squib!  I’ll show them!  Angry tears filled his eyes.  He made his way to the door but stopped with his hand on the handle, his father’s words coming to him from just the week before.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>    “Remember, Rubeus.  Some people hurt so much the only way they can think to make themselves feel better is to hurt someone else.  Sometimes that’s physical, but mostly it’s words.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>    “But, Da, they said that I was a dirty giant!”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>    “I know they did.  But if you push them around, what does that tell them?”  His father looked up to Rubeus’s six feet of height.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>    “That they’re right,” Rubeus mumbled, looking at his feet to avoid his father’s kind black eyes.  </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>    “And what do I always tell you to do instead?” Came the patient reply.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>“Keep my mind calm, my tongue still, my hands gentle, and my heart filled with love,” Rubeus quoted dutifully, as he always did.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>    “I know it is hard, son, but next week you will be going to Hogwarts and it will be all the more important.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus stepped back from the cabin’s sliding door, lowering his wand and returning to his seat.</p><p dir="ltr">“‘Snot worth it,” he muttered to the animal concealed inside his trunk.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The sun was sinking below the horizon by the time the Hogwarts Express pulled into the Hogsmeade station.  </p><p dir="ltr">    “First years!  First years, this way!” a scratchy, reedy voice called through the engine smoke.</p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus hurriedly pulled his trunk out of the car.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Leave that, son,” the voice said.  “You’re belongings will be taken care of.  Follow me.”</p><p dir="ltr">    “But,” Rubeus began, thinking of Chimera in his trunk.</p><p dir="ltr">    A strong callused hand gripped his shoulder and Rubeus looked around to see a tall, stocky man in a mud-stained robe of hunter green.  Rubeus knew the man was tall because the man was larger than himself.</p><p dir="ltr">    “No one will tamper with anything and you’ll be reunited with your luggage in the dorms after the Feast.”</p><p dir="ltr">    “I just need--”</p><p dir="ltr">    “Well, hurry it up,” the Groundskeeper said, not unkindly.  “I do have more than just you to get to the castle.”</p><p dir="ltr">    The man squeezed Rubeus shoulder, turned, and continued down the platform.  “First years! First years, this way! Step lively now. No, leave your trunk there, girl.  First years!”</p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus was not the only one attempting to bring his trunk, but everyone else obediently followed the man.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Rubeus glanced around before opening the lid to his trunk just wide enough for a cat-sized grey-furred creature o climb out and into Rubeus's arms.  He stuffed the large-eared, lion-tailed animal into an inside pocket of his robes.  He left his pink umbrella with a backward glance and followed the other first years.</p><p dir="ltr">    The Groundskeeper led the first years off of the platform, some timid and hesitant, others bouncing and and circling like a pack of puppies.  Rubeus took up the rear, trailing after the group until they reached a lake. A dozen small boats sat moored at the edge of the lake.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Four to a boat,” the Groundskeeper instructed, waving the students ahead of him.</p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus shifted uncomfortably.</p><p dir="ltr">    “You, too, lad.  Pick a boat. How about this one?”  He pointed to a boat where a girl sat by herself.  “Nothing will go amiss; these boats are sturdy to begin with and enchanted by the professors against any mishaps.”</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Rubeus’s heart lightened and he climbed clumsily into the boat and sat on the bench opposite the girl.  </p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">The Groundskeeper climbed into a boat with two students, pulled out a wand, and tapped it on the side of the boat.  As one the little fleet started across the dark water.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">    Hogwarts was grander than he’d imagined.  His father had described the building’s Medieval grandeur, but seeing it rise across the lake and grow ever larger as they crossed the mirror-smooth water was something else entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">    Chimera wriggle dinside Rubeus’s robes, sticking her head out the collar.  Rubeus’s nose itched and he rubbed it vigorously after shoving Chimera back into his robes’ inner pocket.</p><p dir="ltr">    An explosive sneeze sent the boat rocking.  Fortunately it did not tip over, though Rubeus had to grab the back of the only other occupant’s robes to keep them from tumbling into the lake.  The small sparrow-like girl huddled in the boat, clutching her seat and casting nervous glances at Rubeus whenever the little boat trembled as he shifted his weight.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Sorry,” he mumbled to her.</p><p dir="ltr">    “It’s… okay.  I just don’t like boats,” she whispered squeakily.</p><p dir="ltr">    Hagrid didn’t mind boats, though he’d never had much of an occasion to be on one; half-giants were large and heavy even as children.  </p><p dir="ltr">    “I’m sure the groundskeeper wouldn’t let anything happen to you,” Rubeus offered.  “And anyway, the merpeople would rescue you even if summat were to happen. Or I could,” he offered, reasonably, he thought.  She did not look particularly assured.</p><p dir="ltr">    He rubbed his nose again, but the itchy tingle continued and he sneezed again, rocking the boat once more.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Sorry,” he apologized.  “I think I’m allergic to summat.”</p><p dir="ltr">    The castle loomed over the lake, lights spilling cheerily out the windows.  Rubeus lumbered after the other students, eyes wide to take in all the sights at once.  He wanted to run up to the tallest tower and into the deepest dungeons. He really wanted to go looking for cool animals in the forest.</p><p dir="ltr">    Chimera wriggled in his robes again.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Hush.  I’ll let you out after the feast,” he whispered.</p><p dir="ltr">    The great oak doors swung open and the light poured over the first years like a wave.  Standing in the entry hall was a wizard in plum robes, his auburn hair and beard beginning to turn grey.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Welcome, students, to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft And Wizardry.  I am Professor Dumbledore.” The tall, thin wizard waved them inside.  “Thank you for escorting them, Ogg. Please, let the headmaster know that the First Years are here.”</p><p dir="ltr">    Ogg disappeared through a set of double doors, giving Rubeus a glimpse of the Great Hall beyond with four huge tables packed with students.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Professor Dumbledore smiled at the huddle of first years.  “In just a few moments we will go into the Great Hall for the Sorting Ceremony.  The Ceremony will put you into one of our four houses: Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin or—my personal favorite—Gryffindor.”</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Humor sparkled behind gold half-moon glasses.  “As the head of Gryffindor, I am slightly biased.  Soon you each will have a favorite, a place you will call home.”</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Professor Dumbledore lead the way to the double doors.  “I would like to get through the Sorting so we can eat. My stomach always believes tonight is the longest night before dinner.  I am sure you all agree.”</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">All eyes followed them from one end of the hall to the large table beneath windows where all the staff sat like kings looking down on their vassals.  A lonely stool sat before the table, a ragged hat sitting upon it. Dumbledore stepped up to it and waited.</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus towered over the other first years.  He shifted uneasily at the back of the group knowing that he stuck out like a sore thumb.  He felt like a beast on display at a menagerie. He stared fixedly at the stool with the patched and frayed hat, ignoring any looks cast in his direction.  Suddenly, the hat split at the brim and it began to sing:</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Gryffindor, my owner, and one of founders four</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Whose chivalry and loyalty he truly did adore</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Did love to teach those students of red and gold</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>He would often say that luck favors the bold</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Resourceful Slytherin had his very own plan:</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>To accept ambitions students into his green clan</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>He taught them about loyalty and also to be shrewd</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>He honored the heritage of those it was a certitude</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Hufflepuff the dedicated worker and kind to all</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Made a home welcome to anyone, you will recall</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>And chose those of tolerant and judicious hearts</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>To be the ones upon whom she taught all her arts</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Ravenclaw a woman most curious and creative</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Taught students research solo and collaborative</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Intelligence sparkled from her bright, sharp eyes</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>But never forget that she valued how hard one tries</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Now you know a bit of those who created me</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Put me on: your hogwarts house I will decree!</em>
</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus applauded along with the rest of the students.  Impressive!  I wonder if it is the same every time.</p><p dir="ltr">    Professor Dumbledore stepped forward with a scroll and began reading names off of the list.  Rubeus tried to pay attention, but found his mind wandering. He was antsy by the time, “Flitwick, Filius” was called up to take his turn.  The boy, who clearly had some goblin blood somewhere in his ancestry, had to scramble up the rungs of the stool in order to sit. A moment later, that hat roared “Ravenclaw” and the boy had to lower himself back to the floor.</p><p dir="ltr">    Three more names were called and then…</p><p dir="ltr">    “Hagrid, Rubeus,” Professor Dumbledore announced.</p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus made his way past the gaggle of other first years and approached the stool, steadfastly ignoring the murmurs that erupted about his height.  He sat on the stool gingerly, hoping it wouldn't collapse beneath him. He was just thinking he would stand for the sorting instead of sit when Professor Dumbledore placed the hat on his head.  It did not sink down below his eyebrows as it did for the other, much smaller first years. He froze.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Ah, a loyal and nurturing soul,” came a scratchy voice inside his head.  “I see you’re concerned with caring for others.  Not afraid of hard work and getting your hands dirty, either.  Good Hufflepuff qualities, all. You are quite brave and would do well in Gryffindor, and you have great ambition to be a magizoologist like that scamp Newt.  If I put you in Slytherin, that ambition would be well nourished. But you long for justice and fairness, too. I think you’ll do best in your father’s house, so we’ll put you in HUFFLEPUFF!”</p><p dir="ltr">    The last word was shouted, echoing into the Great Hall.  The table almost directly in front of him burst into applause.  Rubeus got to his feet as Professor Dumbledore plucked the Sorting Hat from his shaggy head.  He lumbered over to the table, a huge grin on his blushing face; he’d never had so many people happy to see him.  Usually, he encountered prejudice everywhere he went. In fact, it was a miracle that he’d even gotten into Hogwarts in the first place, being half giant and all.  Albus Dumbledore had come to his house earlier that summer to notify the Hagrids that Rubeus had been accepted after the school board had discussed the matter thoroughly.</p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus sat down on the bench between two students who scooted closer to their neighbors to make room.  The bench, used to holding many, didn’t even groan. The boy across from him frowned slightly and eyed Rubeus’s robes dubiously when the fabric moved as Chimera shifted in the pocket.  Rubeus patted the creature through his robes to calm them.</p><p dir="ltr">    His nose began to itch again and he held his breath as “Lippert, Hecate” was called.  The tiny witch was sent to the Slytherin table and she sat not far from where Rubeus hunkered down.  He clapped his hands over his nose and mouth just before he burst into another explosive sneeze, drowning out Professor Dumbledore as he called the next name on the list.</p><p dir="ltr">    The Great Hall was silent for half a moment.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Sorry!” Rubeus murmured, ducking his head and blushing more furiously than before. Several nearby Hufflepuffs whispered “Bless you!” and the witch beside him patted Rubeus on the back to sooth his embarrassment.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Bless you,” Dumbledore intoned solemnly, though his eyes twinkled brightly.  He continued the ceremony, repeating the last name he had called, “McGonagall, Minerva.”</p><p dir="ltr">    The tall and gangly 12 year old was placed in Gryffindor.</p><p dir="ltr">    More names were called and Rubeus’s stomach growled. He looked longingly at the empty gold plates in front of him.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Sprout, Pomona” was placed in Hufflepuff and then there were only three students left.</p><p dir="ltr">    At long last, “Williams, Dougal” was placed in Ravenclaw and the headmaster rose from his seat.</p><p dir="ltr">    Professor Dippet smiled to the students.  “Welcome to all students, the newcomers and those returning alike.  Before we begin the feast, I would like to make a few short announcements.  First, we have a new Flying professor: Madame Hooch.”</p><p dir="ltr">    The headmaster waved to a young witch with yellow eyes who stood for a brief moment.  She inclined her head in thanks at the round of welcoming applause and sat back down</p><p dir="ltr">    “Next, Professor Beery is already planning his next All Hallow’s Pageant.  This year he plans to direct<em> Queen Maeve and the Muggle King</em> by Susanna Shakespeare Hall.  Those wishing to audition should see him during their free periods any time this week.  Auditions will be held Friday after dinner.”</p><p dir="ltr">    Several enthusiastic theater-loving-students cheered as a jovial man stood and bowed several times before seating himself once more.</p><p dir="ltr">    “My last announcement is of utmost importance,” Professor Dippet continued, his tone somber.  “We will be monitoring the area closely due to Grindelwald’s movements. You can expect stricter security measures.  I expect the full cooperation of all staff and students.”</p><p dir="ltr">    There was a profound silence as the students considered his words.  No one was unaware of the murmurs of war. While the wizarding world was hardly inconvenienced by muggle conflict, Gellert Grindelwald was another story entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">    “Let’s put our fear aside and bein the fabulous meal prepared for us!  Let the feast begin,” Professor Dippet declared.</p><p dir="ltr">    The headmaster waved his hand and the golden dishes were suddenly filled with food of all kinds.  There was glazed chicken, roast beef, vol-au-vents, casseroles, soups and salads, mashed potatoes, green beans, multiple kinds of bread, pumpkin juice, Gillywater, Peachtree fizzing tea, and four kinds of dessert.</p><p dir="ltr">    Rubeus had never gone hungry, but it was difficult for a single parent to provide for a half-giant offspring.  He knew his father tried his best, but he also knew that he would be able to eat his fill for every meal of every day while he was at Hogwarts.  </p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Rubeus felt his lips spreading into a smile:  Hogwarts was going to be amazing</p>
