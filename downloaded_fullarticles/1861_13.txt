<p>
  <span>The night was freezing, except for the two people kneeling on the cold, snow-covered ground seemingly unaffected by it all. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Perhaps the cold they felt inside was too great for them to feel anything else</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Harry mused, as he helped Hermione clear the snow from the ground of the ritual circle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you have everything we need?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“For the last time, Harry, yes. I checked three times,” Hermione huffed as she put her bag down with a thud.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good, ‘cause I want to make these bastards pay and pay for the rest of their miserable lives for what they did to my son,” Harry said, anger blazing in his eyes as he remembered how his baby son, his James,  had died in his arms thanks to Ginny's jealous lover.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man had been trying to kill Harry so he could have Ginny and the Potter fortune, as well. It hadn't mattered to him whether the baby Harry had been holding had survived or not.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man himself,  Michael Corner, had not survived Harry's rage and grief, but Ginny had got off scot-free, and Harry couldn't abide that. Harry divorced her immediately, of course, but the courts had decided that she could not have known what Corner had intended and ruled her blameless in the death of their son. Most of the Weasleys had sided with Ginny in the court battle or stayed neutral in the background, and when Hermione had taken Harry's part, a lot of ugly truths had come out, which had led them to where they were right now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Like I'm going to take any chances with this, of all things,” Hermione said exasperatedly as she pushed a strand of bushy brown hair out of her eyes. “I want Ron to suffer just as much for potioning me sterile. God knows what other potions they've been feeding us over the years,” she said, her own anger evident in her voice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry shook himself out of his murderous thoughts and slung an arm around her shoulder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know. I'm sorry.  I'm being a bad friend right now, aren't I? I should have asked how you were doing.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry, it's fine. I'm fine. Just so angry, I could kill the entire Weasley family with my bare hands,” Hermione replied, returning his hug. “You are not a bad friend. I understand how you must be feeling, you know. You have enough of your own grief to deal with.” She sighed before returning to unpacking their supplies from her bag.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Instead of breathing down my neck, why don't you make yourself useful and get us our sacrifice.  You know we're gonna need one for the ritual,” Hermione said as she began to arrange the symbols around the circle. One for each Fate: A spindle for Clotho, a pair of shears for Atropos, and a blank scroll of parchment for Lachesis.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Any preferences?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How about we toss a coin? Heads it's Ginny, tails it's Ron,” Hermione said, pulling out a galleon.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sounds fair,” Harry said, and he watched the coin fall, coming up heads. Hermione pouted as Harry gave a wide predatory grin, “I’ll be right back,” he said and apparated away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione shrugged and waved him off as she went back to her preparations. They had to get their arithmancy exactly right, or they would just end up dead and not achieve a single thing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry returned twenty minutes later with a stunned and bound Ginny.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Any problems?” Hermione asked from her position, as she knelt in the circle drawing the runes necessary for the ritual.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were using the ritual circle in the forbidden forest as it was the one best suited to Harry's magic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nah, it was almost insultingly easy.  They hadn't even changed the wards around the burrow. Oh, and I killed Molly and Ron since they were there and tried to stop me from leaving with her. We better get this done soon before their bodies are discovered. I bought us a little time by bringing the house down on them, but still,” Harry said, shrugging as he placed Ginny on the altar.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine, come help me finish these runes,” she said, handing him a rune quill of his own.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As they bent to their task, a sharp noise startled them, causing them both to look up and draw their wands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, don't let me stop you. In fact, I'd like to join you in this endeavour,” Malfoy drawled as he strolled out of the trees.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If I'm not mistaken you're preparing a time travel ritual of some sort, and I want in,” the blonde said as he walked closer despite the wands pointed threateningly at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After the war, Harry and Draco had managed to forge an uneasy truce based on the fact that Harry had testified to save Draco and his mother from Azkaban. Draco had never apologised or thanked Harry for returning his wand, but the blonde had seemed to go out of his way to avoid Harry and his friends. This had suited Harry just fine.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>While Harry had mostly forgiven Malfoy for his past, the rest of the wizarding world hadn’t been so forgiving, and the only job he had been able to get was as the gamekeeper at Hogwarts after Hagrid had moved to France to be with Madame Maxime. Now here he was strolling toward them with not a care in the world.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry cursed under his breath, but before he could say anything, Hermione spoke.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>If</span>
  </em>
  <span> we allow you to join us, what guarantee do we have that you won't turn on us and help your father and Riddle kill us in the past?” she asked standing up and moving her wand threateningly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hermione!” Harry exclaimed, aghast.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What? If we don’t agree, he could do something to disrupt the ritual. Besides, the ritual works best with three. You know that” Hermione explained, keeping her eyes on Malfoy, even as she spoke to Harry. “Or we could just kill him. What’s one more in the scheme of things.” She shrugged, eyes hard and cold as diamonds.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco raised both hands in surrender. “I’ll make a vow on my magic. Easy there, I’m just taking out my wand to make the vow,” he cautioned when Harry moved forward threateningly. The blonde slowly pulled out his wand. "I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, do solemnly swear on my life and magic, not to join or help Voldemort or his Death Eaters in word or deed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, that’s not enough, I want you to swear that you will never work to harm us in any way,” Harry demanded before Draco could lower his wand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That might be a little excessive, Harry,” Hermione interjected.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine, Potter. I’ll vow on my magic to never work against you if you would do the same for me?” Draco huffed a little in annoyance.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Agreed,” Harry said, raising his own wand, and they made their vows together as Hermione watched.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, why exactly do you want to go back? I mean, I know you have a crappy job, and no friends or family left, but why would you want to risk your life with this ritual?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco fidgeted reluctantly before he began speaking in a low, angry voice, “Because the bloody Dark Mark took my soulmate from me. My grandmother had the Sight, and she noticed soulmate magic in me, but because bloody Lucius forced the dark mark on me, I can't connect to that part of myself anymore. I could be standing next to my soulmate and not know it. I want what my father and his master took from me. I would also like to save my mother,” He finished softly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not, Lucius?” Harry prodded gently.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That bastard can rot, for all I care. I would like him to rot in Azkaban for much longer this time for what he did to my mother,” Draco spat beginning to pace outside the circle angrily.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione finally nodded shortly, and Malfoy walked into the circle. She handed him a spare quill and list of runes he needed to finish and the three of them worked together in strangely companionable silence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When it was done, the men stood back in relief while Hermione checked their work to make sure it was perfect.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’ll need ritual robes,” Harry reminded Draco.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I guess I should go and get them,” the blonde said and turned to leave. “Don’t even think of starting without me,” he threw over his shoulder as he disappeared from sight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Draco returned with his robes, Harry awakened Ginny.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ha-Harry, what? What are you doing? Are you mad? Let me go,” Ginny screamed, struggling against her binds.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Shut up, bitch. You’re going to get what’s coming to you. Because of you, my son is dead. Because you were too stupid and too selfish to just ask for a divorce. Or is that too greedy? You wanted the Potter, and Black fortunes for yourself and your idiot lover didn’t you. I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole idea behind killing James </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> me was yours, to begin with,” Harry hissed furiously, his rage and grief causing his magic to flare around him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“James, James, James. That’s all you ever cared about. You’ve barely even looked at me since he was born. Your precious son. If you had only listened to me and stayed an Auror instead of moving to Europe for a year to train as a war mage, this wouldn’t have happened. You left me behind, all alone with that brat of yours,” Ginny spat back, eyes alight with malice and contempt.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You, bitch. I asked you to come with me. You were the one who refused, saying you couldn’t possibly leave your family behind. Or was it just your lover you couldn’t leave behind?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ever since the obedience potion stopped working you’ve been impossible to talk to. Why do you have to be so stubborn?” Ginny asked eyes alight with malice despite her situation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry lunged forward, as even Draco looked at the red-head with distaste.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hush, Harry, you wouldn’t want to accidentally kill our sacrifice before the ritual, would you? She’ll get what she deserves in a few minutes. And so will the rest of the family,” Hermione said glaring at her sister-in-law and drawing Harry away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re right, you’re right,” Harry said, casting a silencing charm on the still ranting red-headed witch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good, now, let's get started, shall we?” Draco said, stepping into the circle carrying his robes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They each stepped into a cistern to cleanse themselves before the ritual, turning away from each other to give themselves some privacy. When they were done, they each dressed in their ritual robes and stepped into the circle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry, we’re going to need the Hallows,” Hermione prompted softly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, right,” Harry said and closed his eyes to summon them. After that night when he had held all three, he was always aware of them and had always known that he could summon them anytime he wanted. A fact he had never shared with anyone other than Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait? What? Hallows? You don’t mean the Deathly Hallows? Those are just myths, aren’t they?” Draco asked voice rising with incredulity.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, they are not myths. Harry is the Master of Death. Now, hush,” Hermione shushed him and watched as her friend closed his eyes and pulled lightly with his magic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Harry opened his eyes, the Hallows were floating in front of him. With a wave of his hand, he sent them to their places in the circle; the wand embedded itself in the ground next to the shears, the stone sank into the ground next to the spindle, and the cloak draped itself over the scroll.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco stared wide-eyed at the proceedings. “Y-you…I-I,” he stammered much to Harry’s amusement.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I am Master of Death. Always have been. At least, since the night I defeated Riddle I have been. Now, can you move to your place in the circle?” Harry asked, sharing a smirk with Hermione as they moved to their positions. Draco shook off his surprise and moved to his position, mind spinning rapidly with the new information.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I call upon Clotho the Spinner, the maiden, the giver of life, grant us your favour in our endeavour,” Hermione chanted as she moved to stand next to the resurrection stone and spindle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I call upon Lachesis the Allotter, the mother, the judge, grant us your favour in our endeavour,” Draco continued, as he moved to his spot next to the cloak and scroll.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I call upon Atropos the Inevitable, the crone, death, to grant us your favour in our endeavour,” Harry added, as he stood in his spot next to the wand and shears.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We call upon the Moirai to help us and grant us the strength to achieve our purpose</span>
  <em>
    <span>. Placere auxilium, ut qui fata et ne nos omnes tribus. Mors place tut det nobis in praeteritum transit,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry chanted as he drew his holly wand and drew the runes for time and transport in the air in front of him. The runes glowed gold before darkening and sinking into the ground at their feet, and the dagger he had conjured flew straight and true, piercing Ginny's heart. A whirlpool of magic began to gather, moving over Ginny's body, moving closer and closer as it gathered them one at a time, dissolving first Hermione’s body, then Draco and finally Harry, before they could even call out in shock.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s last thought was that he really hoped they had succeeded or Hermione would never forgive him before his world went black.</span>
</p>
