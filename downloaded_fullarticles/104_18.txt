    <p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny hurried down the center aisle of the Hogwarts Express, looking for an empty compartment to call their own. School would start in a few short hours, and the end-of-summer blues were starting to take their toll on the foursome. Though Hermione enjoyed education, even she had to admit that given the war-charged atmosphere that Voldemort's resurrection had created left an unsavory feeling for those attending Hogwarts that year.</p><p>Ginny threw open the door of a compartment near the back of the train, only to find her brothers on the other side. Their heads were bent towards each other over a piece of parchment as they whispered quickly, their eyes gleaming.</p><p>"Sorry, but - oh. Hey Fred. George," Ginny said her eyes narrowing in suspicion. With the Weasley twins, anything could be afoot. "What are you up to?"</p><p>"Nothing," Fred said innocently, giving the group a dazzling smile as George shoved the parchment behind his back.</p><p>"You haven't been gambling again, have you?" Ron asked as he placed his trunk in the overhead compartment. He turned to help Hermione with hers. "Mum and Dad will kill you."</p><p>"Of course not, baby brother," Fred said, scoffing at the accusation. With a slight pause, however, Ron's older brother seemed to reconsider. "Actually," he said glancing towards George. "I think you may be of some use to us..."</p><p>"Oh no!" Hermione was quick to cut in. "We most certainly do <em>not</em> want to be involved in whatever lunatic plot you two have come up with-"</p><p>"Lunatic," George said with a frown. "Now you're hurting our feelings, Hermione. It's not lunatic at all."</p><p>"It's actually quite brilliant," Fred added.</p><p>"Well of course <em>you'll</em> say that," Hermione snapped. "Whatever it is, it's bound to be dangerous-"</p><p>"Dangerous?" George said with a chuckle. "Give us a little bit of credit, Hermione."</p><p>"We aren't <em>stupid</em>, you know," Fred finished.</p><p>Hermione looked as though she wanted to argue, but Harry interrupted her with a sigh. "Well, go on then. What is it?"</p><p>Fred beamed, thrilled that they had taken the bait. "Seeing as this is our last year at Hogwarts," he began.</p><p>George continued on his behalf. "We wanted to go out with a bang."</p><p>"And so we came up with a list."</p><p>"Two hundred things we're not allowed to do at Hogwarts," the twins said in unison.</p><p>"What <em>kind </em>of list?" Hermione asked, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>"Why, naturally, it's two hundred rules we're going to break before the year is over," Fred explained.</p><p>"And we think it would be brilliant if you'd help us out."</p><p>Silence ensued as the Golden Trio (and Ginny) exchanged weary glances, not exactly sure how to respond. The twins wanted their assistance in <em>breaking rules? </em>They'd never needed help with that before, and Hermione Granger wasn't exactly known for breaking the rules. For Ginny however, the answer was obvious. "I'm in," she said with a grin, high-fiving her brothers in turn.</p><p>"Excellent!" The twins turned simultaneously toward the other Weasley child. "Ron? What about you?"</p><p>"Break rules? Are you mad?" Hermione asked, shaking her head before Ron could open his mouth.</p><p>"Nothing <em>too</em> bad," George coaxed. "Just a few small pranks."</p><p>"Something to lighten up the year with," Fred continued. "It's a dark time, after all. Some humor will be good for student morale."</p><p>"You probably won't even be able to get a detention with this, let alone expelled."</p><p>Hermione snorted. "I highly doubt that."</p><p>"Come on, Hermione," George said, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>She bit her lip, shaking her head slightly. "No one will get hurt?" Hermione asked.</p><p>Fred shrugged. "There may be some mental scarring, but we doubt any physical pain will come from this game of ours."</p><p>"Do we get to play pranks on Malfoy?" Harry inquired.</p><p>"Do you even have to ask?"</p><p>"In that case," Ron laughed. "We're in!"</p><p>"Excellent, this is-"</p><p>"Hold on a moment!" The five celebrating teenagers turned to the killjoy of the group. Hermione stood straight, her eyes narrowed, as she quickly thought this through. Finally she sighed. "I suppose I'm in-"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"But only because this is your last year here! Don't expect any favors from me."</p><p>"Wouldn't dream of it," George said with a grin.</p><p>"There's just one catch," said Fred.</p><p>"I knew it," Hermione muttered.</p><p>"It's nothing bad," George said, holding up his hands in a stop-that-negative-thinking gesture.</p><p>"Just that we can't give you the entire list beforehand," Fred said.</p><p>"We'd like to keep the element of surprise, if you don't mind," George added.</p><p>"And we find that by giving people that much information, things tend to..." Fred exchanged a glance with George.</p><p>"Leak out," his twin finished for him.</p><p>"Fine," Ron said, rubbing his hands together in excitement. "Where do we start?"</p><p>And just like that, the end-of-summer blues and stirring national conflict suddenly seemed so far away from these six plotting students, despite the fact that it existed throughout the rest of the train. It would be an interesting year.</p>
