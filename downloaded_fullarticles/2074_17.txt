    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Draco burst into the room, wand-arm out, and screamed “Expelliarmus!” without even a moment to think about it. Dumbledore’s wand flew to the side, and Draco let his shaking hand fall to the side a little. The Dark Mark’s light cast shadows throughout the room, and Draco scanned the darkness for anyone else. There were two brooms in the tower, not just the one, and he narrowed his eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Who else is here?” he demanded, trying to control his breathing. He could feel his pulse in his temples, the blood flooding his head until he thought it might burst. Death Eater was in his blood, and he was trying to convince himself to do this. He could kill Dumbledore, he <em>could</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Dumbledore, of course, responded in his typical calm way, which would’ve irritated Draco if he didn’t look so pale already. The man looked sickly, perhaps white-faced with shock. “A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco shifted his gaze back to the sickly headmaster. “No,” he said, hoping Dumbledore didn’t hear the wavering in his tone. “I’ve got back-up. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco’s attempts to control his breathing had gone out the window, and he was vaguely aware he was panting, his chest heaving up and down. Dumbledore looked at Draco condescendingly through lidded eyes. “Well, well. Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yeah. Right under your nose and you never realized!” Draco noticed himself getting shrill, and made a mental note to dial it back. There would be no triumph if he sounded like a panicked schoolgirl when he killed Dumbledore. <em>Kill Dumbledore</em>, Draco reminded himself. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “They met some of your guard. They’ve having a fight down below. They won’t be long… I came on ahead. I - I’ve got a job to do.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,” Dumbledore said, as if he’d given up already. Something akin to fury flared up in Draco’s stomach, for the man wasn’t even planning on fighting this! Draco Malfoy was counting entirely on losing to Albus Dumbledore’s skill and experience - he had not prepared himself to kill an unarmed man who was now inexplicably smiling. “Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “How do you know?” Draco blurted, and his cheeks went hot. “You don’t know what I’m capable of! You don’t know what I’ve done!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Oh, yes, I do. You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts… so feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “It has been in it!” Draco insisted. “I’ve been working on it all year and tonight-“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco heard someone shout a few hallways away, and he stiffened. The only thing worse than killing Dumbledore alone would be to have the Death Eaters there to egg him on. Draco had never been fond of their energy, and it was so much worse since the Dark Lord had returned. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Somebody is putting up a good fight,” Dumbledore said, as if he was talking to Draco over tea and not in the last moments of his life. “But you were saying… yes, you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school which, I admit, I thought impossible… how did you do it?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco couldn’t respond, just kept his ears peeled for what was happening in the castle. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone. What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realized, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight, too. And after all, you don’t really need help… I have no wand at the moment… I cannot defend myself.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco flicked his eyes back to the headmaster ad swallowed past the lump in his throat. His wand arm felt too heavy to lift. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I see,” Dumbledore said, all condescending. “You are afraid to act until they join you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I’m not afraid!” snarled its way from Draco’s throat before he could stop it. “It’s you who should be scared!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe… so tell me, while we wait for your friends… how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco swallowed again and tried to clear his head. He knew Dumbledore was playing a game of some kind, trying to psych him out of doing what he had to do. With a trembling arm, he pointed his wand at Dumbledore’s heart. He tried to convince himself to cast the spell - <em>two words, Draco</em> - but he owed Dumbledore the explanation. It seemed to be the man’s dying wish.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one’s used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Dumbledore groaned quietly, and his eyes fell shut for a fraction of a second. “That was clever… there is a pair, I take it?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “The other’s in Borgin and Burkes, and they make a kind of passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the Cabinet was traveling between them, but he couldn’t make anyone hear him… in the end he managed to Apparate out, even though he’d never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realized what it meant - even Borgin didn’t know - I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hogwarts through the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Very good,” Dumbledore praised him quietly, and Draco tried his best to ignore the little bit of pride he felt from the compliment. “So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you… a clever plan, a very clever plan… and, as you say, right under my nose…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yeah,” Draco breathed, “yeah, it was!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “But there were times, weren’t there, when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the Cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands… poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind that stuff, did you?” Draco said smugly, and watched as Dumbledore began to slide a little closer to the floor. He looked bad, and Draco knew that it wasn’t his fault. He couldn’t understand why Dumbledore looked so feeble, but guilt ebbed in the corners of his mind. It was hardly fair, someone so vulnerable… </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “As a matter of fact, I did. I was sure it was you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>What</em>?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Why didn’t you stop me, then?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders-“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “He hasn’t been doing your orders, he promised my mother-“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but-“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “He’s a double-agent, you stupid old man, he isn’t working for you, you just think he is!” Draco exclaimed triumphantly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape-”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Well, you’re losing your grip, then! He’s been offering me plenty of help - wanting all the glory for himself - wanting a bit of the action - ‘What are you doing? Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything-’ But I haven’t told him what I’ve been doing in the Room of Requirement, he’s going to wake up tomorrow and it’ll all be over and he won’t the Dark Lord’s favourite any more, he’ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!” Draco had to draw in a large breath at the end of his proud outburst, keeping his eyes steadily on Dumbledore and trying to work up the nerve, the nerve to…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Very gratifying,” Dumbledore said, almost disinterestedly. “We all like appreciation for our own hard work, of course… but you must have had an accomplice, all the same… someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the - the-“ Dumbledore made a strange, pained noise, and Draco narrowed his eyes. “… of course,” Dumbledore continued, “… Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Got there at last, have you?” Draco taunted, in that same tone he typically reserved for Harry Potter. Potter - where was he now? Draco silently hoped that none of his companions would find his nemesis. Not tonight.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> The yelling from the castle was growing louder in the background, and Draco glanced over his shoulder at the door. It was still closed, the shadows around it dousing everything in a sheen of darkness. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead… well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present… yes, very neat… very neat… poor Mr. Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta’s… tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Ignoring the violent shaking of his wand arm, Draco continued to talk. “Enchanted coins. I had one and she had the other and I could send her messages-“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Isn’t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore’s Army used last year?” Dumbledore’s voice was gaining some traction, but he looked even weaker now. His pale face shone in the light from the Dark Mark in the sky above, casting strange shadows over his crooked nose. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yeah, I got the idea from them,” Malfoy admitted, smiling a little. “I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger, as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognizing potions…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco managed a laugh at the triviality of it all, even though he did feel guilty for saying Mudblood. Felt guilty every time he said it, in fact, but Father always encouraged it. “You care about me saying ‘Mudblood’ when I’m about to kill you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yes, I do,” Dumbledore’s shoes slipped on the floor and he had to grasp at the wall a little to keep himself upright. “But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now. We are quite alone. I am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco wished more than anything he could say it aloud: he was horrified at the notion of doing this. He knew he had to, for the Malfoy honour and to keep his own life, but looking at Dumbledore now he remembered al the times he’d seen the man in the hallways or the Great Hall, humming and smiling at every student without the slightest contempt for who they were, who their family was. Still, Draco had to kill him, he needed to.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Now, about tonight, I am a little puzzled about how it happened… you knew that I had left the school? But of course,” he didn’t give Draco time to answer, having solved the puzzle in less than a second, “Rosemerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I’m sure…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “That’s right. But she said you were just going for a drink, you’d be back…” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Well, I certainly did have a drink… and I came back… after a fashion…” Dumbledore trailed off, almost amused. “So you decided to spring a trap for me?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “We decided to put the Dark Mark over the Tower and get you to hurry up here to see who had been killed. And it worked!” Draco was proud, ridiculously so, and was happy to be telling all of his cleverness to Dumbledore. After all, it was gratifying to have this great wizard, however much of a stupid old man he was, admit that he’d been bested by someone so much younger.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Well… yes and no… But am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco shuddered. “Someone’s dead,” he said, his voice jumping in pitch again like it had before. “One of your people… I don’t know who, it was dark… I stepped over the body… I was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix got in the way.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Yes, they do that,” Dumbledore replied, not even asking about the body. Draco knew it was a redhead, that much was clear, and wagered it was likely a Weasley. After all, copper-red hair ran strong in that blood-traitor family of theirs. There was a bang from the stairs up to the tower, and more shouting. Draco stiffened and tried to listen to who was coming. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “There is little time, one way or another,” Dumbledore pulled his attention back. “So let us discuss your options, Draco.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “My options!” he all but shouted. “I’m standing her with a wand - I’mm about to kill you-”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “My dear boy, let us have no more pretence about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco tried to remember to breathe, to fill his lungs with the musty air of the Tower, but he could not explain to Dumbledore in the right words the terror, that he needed to do this, he had to.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I haven’t got any options!” Draco shouted, with conviction like he’d never had before. “I’ve got to do it! He’ll kill me! He’ll kill my whole family!” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> That much, Draco knew to be absolutely true. The Dark Lord had no issue with killing people, no matter what age or loyalty. Draco had seen it firsthand, had heard stories. His mother’s crying in the nighttime while his father spoke in hushed anxious tones told him enough. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I appreciate the difficulty of your position. Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I suspected you.” Draco winced when he heard the Dark Lord’s name out loud. “I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you. But now at last we can speak plainly to each other… no harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived… I can help you, Draco.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> The offer sounded sincere, but there was no way to trust those words. “No, you can’t,” Draco insisted, realizing he sounded close to tears. “Nobody can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got no choice.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban… when the time comes we can protect him too… come over to the right side, Draco… you are not a killer…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> It felt like a rock dropped in Draco’s guts. Months ago, that offer would have been something to consider, before he’d gone this far. Death Eaters were here, now, and there was nothing he could do to turn back now. And his parents? The offer of protection by the Order of the Phoenix would not bring them over. Draco would have to leave them behind, live in some awful little house like the Weasleys and spend the rest of his life alone and hated within the Order. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “But I got this far, didn’t I?” Draco said deliberately, as much to himself as the man in front of him. “They thought I’d die in the attempt, but I’m here… and you’re in my power… I’m the one with the wand… you’re at my mercy…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No, Draco. It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco’s breathed through his mouth, and his hand could not hold his wand steady no matter how hard he tried. Perhaps he could go with Dumbledore, perhaps… </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> The footsteps were thunderous and the door slammed open. There were four of the Death Eaters, and he’d made no move to kill Dumbledore yet. Amycus and Alecto - Draco hated them, and their stupid little faces. Greyback was there, looking as malicious as always.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Dumbledore cornered!” Amycus and Alecto met eyes with matching grins. “Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco shrunk under the gaze of the Carrows, hating the way their praise grated against his skin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Good evening, Amycus,” Dumbledore welcomed them pleasantly. “And you’ve brought Alecto too… charming…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Think your little jokes’ll help you on your death bed, then?” Alecto asked, through her insane little giggles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Jokes? No, no, these are manners.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Do it,” Fenrir Greyback barked, and Draco jumped a little. Greyback’s ordering him around was expected by now, but it still made his skin crawl with a mixture of terror and distaste.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Is that you, Fenrir?” Dumbledore asked, still playing the fool.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “That’s right. Pleased to see me, Dumbledore?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No, I cannot say that I am…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual… you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “That’s right. Shocks you, that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> It frightened Draco, for one thing. He’d seen Greyback with blood dripping down his chin many a time now, and it never got any less horrifying. He was sure it was like that now, because he could hear Greyback licking his lips while Draco kept his eyes fixated on Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little. And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I didn’t,” Draco insisted, meeting Dumbledore’s eyes and trying to say <em>‘I’m sorry’ </em>through the gaze alone. “I didn’t know he was going to come-”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore. Not when there are throats to be ripped out… delicious, delicious…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I could do you for afters, Dumbledore…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “No,” Draco heard Yaxley say sharply. “We’ve got orders. Draco’s got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco could feel the terror coursing through him, and he stared at Dumbledore while trying to muster up the courage. The old man was leaning so heavily into the wall it seemed he could barely keep himself upright anymore, and looking at him only caused Draco to swell with pity. There was no bloodthirstiness in him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “He’s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!” Amycus sneered, and Alecto giggled along. “Look at him - what’s happened to you, then, Dumby?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus. Old age, in short… one day, perhaps, it will happen to you… if you are lucky,” Dumbledore was still speaking bravely, but in a voice that slurred.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “What’s that mean, then, what’s that mean?” Amycus yelled.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Always the same, weren’t yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I don’t even know why the Dark Lord’s bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> There was more shouting on the stairs and someone was shouting.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Now, Draco, quickly!” Yaxley insisted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco couldn’t aim his hand, it shook so violently.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I’ll do it,” Greyback offered, appearing in Draco’s peripheral.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I said no!” Yaxley shouted, and hit Greyback with a hex that send him flying. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Draco, do it, or stand aside so one of us-“ Alecto was cut off by Snape himself, his wand drawn and his black eyes surveying the terror. Relief flooded Draco, because at last, here was someone who had sworn to help him. Snape would know what to do, how to help Draco finish Dumbledore off.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “We’ve got a problem, Snape,” Amycus explained, “the boy doesn’t seem able-“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Then, quietly, in a pitiful voice, “Severus…”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Draco snapped his head back to look at the speaker. Dumbledore was having a hard time looking up at Snape. Draco was shoved harshly aside, and when he tripped, he threw out his hand to break his fall. He hit something warm, a person - his hand caught the Invisibility Cloak and, in a silent moment of shock, Draco recognized Harry Potter’s hand. He could recognize it, of course, because of the Gryffindor sleeve that draped the fingers. <em>What other Gryffindor would be in the Tower with Dumbledore?</em> Draco looked to see if anyone was looking, but everyone’s attention was on Dumbledore and Snape. Quickly, his heart pounding so hard it marred his vision, he re-covered Potter’s hand and watched the scene unfold before him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Severus… please…” Dumbledore was finally begging for his life.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Snape’s expression didn’t waver. He raised his hand like he was a mechanism intended for this, and pointed it directly at Dumbledore’s chest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Avada Kedavra!” he shouted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> The green light hit Dumbledore’s chest and he was blasted over the battlements like a ragdoll. He went over the side of the Tower, and was gone. It had been done, and Draco hadn’t been the one to do it: Albus Dumbledore was dead.</span>
