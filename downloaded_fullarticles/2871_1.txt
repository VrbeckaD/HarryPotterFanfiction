    <p>A pounding headache accompanied his stinging eyes as a clear indication that Harry should stop for the day. Unfortunately he was far from completing all of his homework but he figured that in case he'd fancy keeping the remaining of his sanity he should impede it for the night.</p><p>Stretching out his aching back, he gathered up the cluttered parchments and books, heading to the Tower since it was already close to dinner time anyways. McGonagall has asked everyone to go at 6 pm sharp since they will have an announcement.</p><p>Trying to look as imperceptible as possible failed him this time just as much as ever before. At this point the situations he found himself in became ridiculous resulting him to be in need of the help of their matron, Madam Pomfrey, every week.</p><p>All he wanted was to blend in, the war was over he was not special anymore and everyone can move on. That's what he thought but the reality could not have been further from the little dream he has created for himself.</p><p>"Watch where you're going git. Are you truly this oblivious, an unsocialised, dim-witted waste of a person who cannot even walk anymore? My expectations are so low Potter, lower than public urinating yet here you are disappointing me. How are you still alive?" He stumbled back upon running into something, quickly realising that it was none other than Malfoy by the legit monologue that he poured onto him right after. It always made Harry wonder whether or not he should applaud when he finishes since at this point he's convinced that he practises this in front of a mirror. Coming back to his senses Harry plainly glared as they both went for the door again, struggling to go through first like the mature adults that they were.</p><p>With a final push Harry shoved Malfoy out of the way and took a step into the Great Hall with the grace of a troll, only to hear Malfoy's jinx. Not fast enough, the two soon became engrossed in a pointless fight, both of them suffering from some strange consequences such as ears that reached the floor or a nose that blew up like a balloon growing bigger with each passing second.</p><p>"Please gentlemen." McGonagall sent them off towards their own tables fixing both lads' face up. Trotting to his friends Harry felt way more content than he showed. Truth be told the only thing that remotely kept him from going mad was Malfoy and accepting that was a handful.</p><p>He needed to realise that nothing is the same anymore, the war changed everyone around them and it surely did the same to himself or the twerp but the endless bantering that they still kept up was the only fix point in his life, strangely consoling whilst most times he had way too many thoughts that usually ended with surges of panic washing through his body, worsening his life.</p><p>He's never shared that with anyone before. His attacks depended on his mood enormously however they usually came at night with the dreams. He has learned to fall asleep with his canopy drawn and silence spells. Telling someone could help his case but every time he tried he was faced with issues. They were all fighting their own demons and Harry had no right to force his on top of theirs.</p><p>Being back here felt wrong. Everything felt ill-fitting actually, even before they came back to finish. Harry did not want to, to begin with, but all the other options felt even worse, not wanting to go into training and become an Auror, he wasn't even sure if he'll ever want that again. He felt like he had no place in the world anymore. As a child he was convinced that the three of them will always be the team, just them against the world but Harry needed to realise that Hermione was a team with Ron and he was simply their downtime.</p><p>He knows it's not intentional, well-aware that he still has his friends but nothing is the same anymore and he simply does not fit anywhere. He had a fling going with Ginny but they were quick to recognise that neither of them wants the other for themselves but for the idea of being together, though it means little to nothing if your relationship is based on the fact that you yearn to be in one rather than being about the other person.</p><p>She has moved on since and it hurts to see. Harry wishes nothing but the best for her and he admittedly freaked out over his train of thoughts the first time he had them, guilt consuming him right off but at the end of the day it left him even more alone, feeling strange going to the Burrow like he doesn't belong there, getting aghast from staying with his friends because they deserved time on their own.</p><p>It was difficult to face at first and Harry wouldn't praise himself over his chosen way of handling this-which inconveniently turned out to be ignorance-doing his best to at least pretend that he's fine. That he is not convinced that his death truly should have come because it almost felt like he went against his destiny and now he's paying the price of that decision.</p><p>A brusque jab made him crunch to the side-worried for his ribcage as his name was called again by McGonagall, her tone a little less than patient so he'd assume it was not the first time.</p><p>"What?" He definitely should have paid attention but instead of an answer he was helped-<em>shoved</em>-off the bench and nudged towards their professor. She held out a woven basket with only a tiny opening at the top making him assume that he's supposed to get something out.</p><p>Pushing the irrationality of his thoughts to the side, truly doubting that something will bite him, he let his hand enter and grabbed the first piece of parchment he touched. Pulling it out he kept his eyes on McGonagall's cat-like orbs until he was shooed away.</p><p>Not once looking at the paper he sat back down, turning towards Hermione right off, making her eyes roll exaggeratedly, though still having the decency to lean over and explain.</p><p>"We're doing secret Santa this year to build the social strength of the community and encourage possibly blooming friendships between separate houses. You've just picked a name and you're not supposed to tell anyone who it is, when you gift them something you have the choice but it's not compulsory."</p><p>Nodding his head in understanding he stared down at his fingers as he worked the parchment open, in cursive bold letter it said a single name just like Hermione told it would.</p><p>
  <strong>Ronald Weasley</strong>
</p><p>Sighing happily he was glad that he did not need to worry about putting too much thought into this, he already planned to buy Ron and 'Mione tickets to an upcoming Quidditch game as a little getaway for the two.</p><p>"Who did you get?" Dean tried to whisper over the noise but he ended up screaming. Shaking his head with a grin Harry did not say a word, shrugging a shoulder when being called a foul.</p><p>"Draco Malfoy." Harry avert his attention away from Dean and Seamus mocking him, gauging the git sauntering towards the headmistress haughtily taking each step like he owns this place. Some things never change not even after going through the trial, having an awkward moment on the halls of the ministry where Harry just finished up his testimony and actually considered to go over and say something but he did not manage to figure out anything worth telling so he never did. He remembers how different Malfoy looked there, almost vulnerable although he soon stepped past that.</p><p>Pansy Parkinson has left and moved away just like Malfoy's mother whilst Lucius was convicted, but Malfoy himself refused to leave so he was given the Manor and left to fend for himself. Zabini was the only person left here for him, most looking at him with admiration or fear but none getting close. Malfoy was still Malfoy certainly enjoying to listen to his own voice as much as possible whilst Zabini did not seem to mind.</p><p>Malfoy read the name right away, pulling only his left eyebrow up, distaste evident in his face, his entire stance emitting aversion as he walked back to sit, without a care in the world, a scowl deeply etched onto his face he passed the paper to Zabini who apparently found the situation hilarious, laughing his arse off on Malfoy's dispense.</p><p>"Can we switch Harry?" Ron seemed pretty doomed about his own name, flashing them the paper that read Blaise Zabini, making Harry smile apologetically. "Don't be a moron, there are obviously rules, you cannot draw your own name and whoever you picked is documented automatically. Did no one actually pay attention?" All she received was a laugh in the face by Finnegan who kept nagging Neville to tell who he's drawn.</p><p>That night sleep did not come to Harry easily. He was having a hard time with dreams but he's gotten to the point where he can barely fall asleep so even if he dreams of getting skinned alive whilst watching everyone he ever loved die all over again, it sounded doable. He was going unhinged from the lack of rest he was getting, starting to take a toll on his body as well not stopping with his mind anymore.</p><p>Pulling out his map he watched all the teachers who were not in bed, the ghosts ambling around the castle, Peeves being up to no good for sure on the fourth floor, Filch rushing towards his distancing form, clearly playing with their caretaker.</p><p>His gaze soon fixated on a dot stubbornly staying in one place in the common room all alone. It was Malfoy and Harry felt uneasy from the fact that he was not in his bed asleep like he should be. For a second he actually considered the dim-witted option to go and see what he's up to but he stopped himself in the middle of sitting up, admitting that he's certainly mad for even thinking of doing such thing.</p><p>He ended up watching the dot with the levitating name until it came to dawn and he felt sleepy. Malfoy's dot moved effortlessly, making Harry imagine how he must be walking with grace, showing that he's superior even when no one is around, until he saw him getting into bed.</p><p>Almost as on demand his eyes slipped closed happy that Malfoy was not plotting anything evil for once-obviously sleeping-and not having the decency to himself to realise how insane his thoughts were upon imagining that Malfoy's dot moves differently, even the map knowing that he's a conceded git.</p><p>The usual ogling felt much worse than the days before making Harry assume that he's done something even if he's not aware just yet. Seating himself next to Ron he stared at his friends reading the Prophet. "What's up with you two?"</p><p>They both flinched, deep into whatever conversation they were having which usually wouldn't have been interrupted by Harry but he heard his name already a dozen times included in this particular one.</p><p>"Nothing." Ron replied swiftly, folding up the Prophet without a care if it'll rip or not. "He deserves to know..." Hermione's even tone, like he was arguing professionally was drowned out by Ron's hasty comments on how he has enough on his mind.</p><p>"Er...guys I'm still here." With a sudden twist the paper was taken from his ginger friend a soft blow planted on his forehead after which it was offered to Harry.</p><p>"Er...is it really bad? I do not read it ever." This time Hermione's face slipped into grotesque shock, almost like Harry would have admitted that he sometimes rides his unicorn to Diagon Alley and turns it into a dragon to scare children in his freetime.</p><p>"That is so irresponsible Harry, the news that it delivers are still crucial, I'd understand if you'd maybe skip the first page, I despise that myself, but the rest is very important. Like right now on the 11th page, second paragraph there's this perfectly edited article on the new law against brutality that has been committed towards the house elves. I, myself, have taken a huge part in its publishing and the least I'd expect is to have people read it..." Drowning her voice out after that, Harry gave up hope that he'll ever find out what the Prophet said about him since Hermione can get very passionate about elves.</p><p>"I know she's crazy sometimes but you gotta love her, the article simply explains how my sister got a new boyfriend and it goes into a spiral on how you take it with extreme heroism." Rolling his eyes, Harry can tell that Ron fully believed him when he told that he's over Ginny and their relationship.</p><p>It was true, it just made him feel even more stuck down. "Er...why is that news now, that happened months ago."</p><p>"Yeah I know but no one did back then." Ron's mouth was full as he was nodding his head in the appropriate times along to Hermione's little speech that was still happening. Harry was certain that Ron pays even less attention to it than he does though.</p><p>The day kept dragging along until it was finally over. Harry was heading out of Hogwarts, sauntering towards Hogsmeade. He has gotten permission to leave which is definitely a privilege that only they receive since they would be already free of school, adulating on their own if it wasn't for the war.</p><p>He stopped at Madam Puddifoot's tea shop and then headed into the post office. It's not often that he does this since most times he is more than able to just handle his businesses through the owlery but today he wanted to write without being seen there.</p><p>He made sure to pick the right coloured owl, wanting his letter to get to the Weasleys in time, making sure that his present will have no complications later on.</p><p>"Harry Potter?" In any given situation he would have groaned and try to hide, but that voice could be recognised by him at any time. Whirling around, he smiled at Dobby bashfully clasping a letter with neat scribbling across its front.</p><p>"Dobby, how are you doing lately? I've heard you got a job." Dobby's tiny face lit up by the mention right away, warming Harry's heart enormously.</p><p>"Yes Harry Potter, Dobby does have a new job. Dobby enjoys it very much and has no one but Harry Potter to thank for it."</p><p>"Please, I've done nothing so how is it?"</p><p>"Better than Dobby expected Sir, Dobby's master is a very kind man, who gives Dobby a wage and makes Dobby the worker of the months every month and Dobby gets Mondays off. Dobby never had a day off before."</p><p>"I am genuinely beyond happy for that Dobby, you deserve all of that. Does he have a lot of elves?"</p><p>"No, only Dobby, why would Harry Potter assume?" Scratching the back of his neck Harry shrugged before answering, not liking how Dobby seemed to take his comment to heart.</p><p>"Er...I thought that there were elves if you're the worker of the months...I just assumed."</p><p>"No it's only Dobby and Master, but Master is a lovely and considerate man, never giving it to himself, not even when Dobby was real bad and hurt one of the trees on accident. Dobby deserved punishment and Dobby knows how much Master loves those trees but Dobby was not made to pay and still had the title at the end of the month."</p><p>"I'm so happy that you enjoy yourself in the new place." Sticking around a little longer, they talked some more on how's Harry is doing whilst Dobby also paid for an owl sending a letter off to France.</p><p>After departing Harry tried to brighten his mood and not appear as if he is walking towards death, but plainly heading back to his school that he loves.</p><p>He did still adore Hogwarts and all of its little quirks but it was becoming harder with time to distract himself from how much has changed through the years. Strolling past the bridge, he wasn't overly enthusiastic to go up to the dormitory knowing that he will struggle to find his rest.</p><p>Still not having any excuses made up by the time he reached the main entrance he simply headed in and walked up until he was face to face with the fat lady. Muttering their password, Harry did his best to slip past his peers, not feeling up for the questioning of his emotional state after Ginny so rudely dared to move on with her life unlike Harry who was still a mess and had the social skill of an affronted hippogriff.</p><p>Finding the solitude of his dorm eerie if anything, Harry busied himself with a shower that took just a tad bit longer than it would be socially acceptable, although he was unable to make himself care enough to be bothered.</p><p>After his lengthy attempt to hide from his problems, he entered his room only to be already filled up. Theirs was one of the only ones that stayed full, all of them coming back unlike a lot of the pupils who felt too strongly after the war.</p><p>Yearning for seclusion as soon as his eyes fell onto the lads, made him question his sanity, truly baffled if he is actually unhinged enough to be keen for a lonesome life but not fairly able to handle it.</p><p>Mouthing a good night he was not stopped, getting into his bed and drawing the canopy. The silence was like deadweight almost as if he was floating just fine but as soon as he was left with nothing but his mind a thunderbird got settled on top of his chest, leaving him breathing heavily, unable to function properly.</p><p>Thinking how this is only getting worse, Harry still refused to do the smart thing and instead of seeking help he turned to his stomach and got out the map from under his pillow.</p><p>His gaze was taking in all the small detail that the map demonstrated for him but his orbs did not linger on anything, not until they fixated on the dot of Malfoy. He was walking along a corridor on the sixth floor, making Harry assume that he was at the library before.</p><p>The amount of knowledge that he could gather from such a simple place and turn into evil made Harry jittery, itching to grab his invisibility cloak and have a look himself, thinking that Malfoy would need closer monitoring than what is provided right now.</p><p>Instead of going to his own dormitory at the dungeons he headed for and stopped in the common room, certainly alone there. Pushing all of his rationality to the side Harry decided that he spends way too much time all by himself, probably planning some horrible things.</p><p>Grabbing his cloak and sneaking out felt almost natural. He made sure to keep the map with him as he avoided anything that might raise complications for him, heading straight towards Malfoy's mark.</p><p>Sliding into the room, he managed to stay unnoticed which was mainly due to his cloak but he also likes to believe that he is sly when it come to sneaking around.</p><p>Not entirely sure what he was expecting, maybe Malfoy brewing some poisonous angel's trumpet draught , or perhaps busting him upon practising unforgivable curses. He pretty much would have settled with such mundane idea as him sharpening knives sooner than the reality.</p><p>Which was plainer than anything.</p><p>Malfoy was sitting in front of the fireplace, a small flame litting his figure as he crunched forward, hugging his knees close to his chest. The side of his face was visible for Harry and it held nothing along his usual emotions or characteristics.</p><p>He looked tired and worn out, representing how Harry feels perfectly. His troubles are actually quite reflective on the outside but Malfoy never really showed anything he was presenting now. His features were arranged in a deep scowl as he stared into the flames like he was carrying the weight of worlds.</p><p>Harry moved around silently to the point where he was almost ahead of him, something capturing about the git. It was like looking at a whole new person and maybe the first time that Harry truly saw the toll the war has taken on him as well.</p><p>Under the trials he appeared anxious, even sad when his father was convicted but he's never shown such vulnerability than in that moment. Harry was far from pitying him, though for once he sincerely did not mean to bother the twerp.</p><p>However watching him had calmed Harry's own panic that was rising, almost like crippling pain creeping up along his spine. He was fixated on the idea that it's because Malfoy could be planning to burn down Hogwarts but in reality he was doing his best to avoid the real issue at hand.</p><p>Deciding that he deserves some peace from his mind, he seated himself voiceless onto the couch on the side, keeping his gaze on Malfoy. Ogling someone who was clearly fighting their own demons was not pleasant but Harry needed to realise that was not what he was doing.</p><p>His eyes kept taking in Malfoy just as he was, not trying to see behind his expression or figure him out, he was simply taking in his looks. How soft his hair looked, on top of his head already long enough to make a bun. His long digits that clasped each other, tangled in a mess around his legs, the shade of his eyes that appeared to be a lot warmer than Harry has ever imagined seeing them before. His face looked very pretty, almost like it was glowing, his pointy nose being complimented by that.</p><p>Harry was slightly horrified at his train of thoughts but he obviously meant his skin, not like he would be beautiful. Malfoy did not even have the decency to ever break out or anything that everyone else did whilst teens and Harry believes a lot of things told about the git but he would laugh in someone's face if they'd assume that he plainly charmed them away.</p><p>Harry had no idea how much time has actually passed by, he snapped out of his trance when Malfoy got up and headed off to-perhaps-go to sleep. Without presuming that he will kidnap a Hufflepuff second year and hang them out of the Clock Tower, Harry strolled back to his own dormitory leaving Malfoy to it.</p><p>Getting into bed, not able to explain it, he still checked if Malfoy made it as well which he did so Harry just let sleep take over, hoping that things will get better soon.</p><p>Weeks have passed and Harry has gotten into the habit of staying at the common room until Malfoy showed up. It was simply something to do for him, a side activity to do in his downtime instead of thinking until he loses the rest of his sanity.</p><p>Watching Malfoy just sit in the quiet was enough to keep him distracted, his panic attacks almost fully disappearing. When he had a nightmare he pulled out his map and focused on Malfoy's dot, trying to figure out if he's asleep or not. Sometimes when he was watching him at dawn, Malfoy just like himself was pacing, fairly not always able to sleep.</p><p>The difference was that Harry looked like a ghost the next day whilst Malfoy fixed up well, appearing as put together as ever like he hasn't got a single problem in the world.</p><p>The slight obsession that he has developed over the lad was starting to near 6th year but nothing was the same. Harry obviously had no intention to ever talk to the git or anything like that, he could have gotten addicted to goggle anyone it just happened to be Malfoy who came along first.</p><p>You bloody looked for him on the map idiot.</p><p>Ignoring that part of his brain-annoyingly trying to force the wrong narrative on his emotions and acts-like always, he swept all of that to the side, heading over to his friends.</p><p>It was already past holidays and on this week McGonagall ordered them to gift their secret partner. Well Harry believed Hermione who said that that's what was being said by her also trusting her on the part where they're allowed to do it however they please.</p><p>That's why he was clutching the thin tickets, wrapped up with a bow, in his hands and heading over to give them personally.</p><p>"Well happy Christmas guys, Ron I was your secret santa so here you go." They both smiled and while Hermione hugged him and wished him all the best as well, Ron exhilarated, ripped the wrapper off. The pair's delicate mood was brusquely crushed as Ron screamed at the top of his lungs tackling Harry to the ground in a bear hug.</p><p>He was not in any shape or form small so he easily took him down, the two of them struggling on the floor as Ron tried to kiss Harry for being the best whilst Harry tried to protest such thing happening.</p><p>He ended up thanking his fluffy-haired friend dragging him off of him whilst rubbing the saliva that has smeared across his cheek.</p><p>"It's for both of you actually so I hope you'll enjoy it as much as Ron 'Mione, I know you like Quidditch."</p><p>"It's perfect Harry, you're lovely for thinking of me as well." Dodging Ron's attempts to show his unusual amount of love and affection was how Harry has spent the rest of his day, wondering who might have pulled him. He had heard outlandish rumours on how Vicky, a Ravenclaw girl, has been the one to draw his name and he will be getting love potion.</p><p>He highly doubted that being true but in case there's chocolate on his bed he might need to throw it out.</p><p>The week has come to an end and Harry has not received anything at all, upon being asked by the headmistress he simply lied and told he got a gift anonymously, not wanting to get whoever drawn him in trouble. He assumed it was a young slytherin, hating Harry's guts and truly disgusted by the idea of getting him a present.</p><p>That night he walked up to his dormitory to grab his cloak and catch Malfoy but got distracted by the wrapped up box at the end of his bed.</p><p>It was either from a Gryffindor or placed there by a house elf. Harry tried to be careful as the covers were beautifully arranged, showing that someone took great care of this being wrapped in such a lovely way.</p><p>When he managed to extract the box out of the paper inside he saw the parchment on top and read that first.</p><p>
  <em>To Harry Potter:</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Firstly let me start this off by saying you are the last person I would have ever wanted to gift anything but here we are. I made this myself, charms and all. Maybe it is a feeble attempt but I for whatever reason decided to give you my trust and assume the best even though I do not see how it could happen. Still I made this for you, expecting a half-witted, unsocialised, saviour-complex struck git to appreciate the beauty.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It took me a long time and I will explain right now what it is because I can just see the stupid look on your face, far from understanding anything. I have gifted you an ancient charm. Obviously one puts these on inanimate objects-which was also done by me-to keep the person safe. The very first-known-time this was used, happened during the infamous wizarding war (you know Potty the one against Grindelwald and his follower). Apparently a wizard named Ackley Hadleigh casted this exact charm over his toddler's toy bear and she was the only person who lived after the fire that soon burnt down the entire building where they lived.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Now that could be incorrect, many argue that he was not even the one casting, or creating the spell but it is somewhat besides the point (by that I mean that you are the last person I wish to discuss something so intellectual since you are far from sharp).</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Have a merry Christmas Potter and I wish you all the best, maybe even some brain cells for this new year!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours sincerely, DLM</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ps: One does not have to take the charm ever so literally, it does not save lives but it can help you stay alive in the oddest situations and also helps to save you from yourself.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Pps: That means bad dreams, anxiety and such...god I can just see that unintelligent crease between your eyebrows as my words surely struggle to go through the denseness of your head.</em>
</p><p>With every sentence somehow managing to come out insulting, Harry had no problem figuring out that the initials belong to Malfoy. Although for whatever mad reason, instead of a dim-witted look-as it was predicted by the git-Harry's face was graced by a huge smile.</p><p>The words felt half-hearted and him telling the story, bothering to apparently give something meaningful and all together making an effort truly warmed his heart enough to look past the exact way of presenting it.</p><p>He read over the letter again, smile never ceasing, as it was so easy to just see Malfoy sitting down and writing that whole thing, smirking to himself and shaking his head with an eye roll remembering that he's writing to Harry.</p><p>Placing the parchment safely next to his map for the time being he opened the box to see what object Malfoy was talking about, wondering how an earth he would make an object.</p><p>His jaw dropped as he pulled out a gorgeous snow globe. It was the perfect size to fit into his palms, the glass shining brightly like it was polished to be that clear. It was standing on a narrow dark wooden plate, small pieces running up along the side almost like the branches were spelled to swarm around the globe and keep it in place.</p><p>That in itself was magnificent enough to get him flabbergasted until he looked at what was on the inside. Gasping loudly, he shook the globe like a child would, wanting to see what will happen. Sparkling snow started to whirl around but seemingly coming from above and not getting on top by the rocking motion whilst it started to play a tune.</p><p>There was a glorious castle placed in the middle and as the soft music started to play the front became transparent and Harry watched how a family of four was lounging around, dogs and cats racing to get towards the fire lit as they all hugged.</p><p>Harry could feel the enchantment of the gift, immediate warmth filling his insides, convinced that nothing bad could happen to him. He had no idea how hard could this spell be or how Malfoy even did it but he was solemnly focused on the pretty picture painted in front of him.</p><p>Each time the tune ended the globe stopped casting twinkling snow, the castle appearing back. Each time Harry shook it again he saw something different, almost like the castle was showing him all the ways of how one might be happy and there were a whole lot more ways than Harry would have ever counted by himself.</p><p>
  <em>With our hearts wide open</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We are ready to go</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Give someone who's broken</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A piece of our home.</em>
</p><p>The little song, that sounded strange at first knowing that Malfoy was the one writing it but now Harry could not imagine ever forgetting those words, was over yet again when the lads came into the room as well.</p><p>Without thinking Harry shoved it under his blanket not wanting to show something so beautiful. He felt guilty right away but he needed to reason with himself. It just felt way too personal and he'd have to admit it's from Malfoy and all in all it would just lead to complications and Harry was not ready for that. He wanted to be the only one who sees the globe because what if someone steals it.</p><p>The irrationality of the thought that his best friends would become thieves for a snow globe did not sink in fully but he also stopped worrying over him being a horrible person since Ron took advantage of his dozed out phase and jumped onto him, yelling to show his gratitude.</p><p>That night Harry did not go to the common room, nor get his map to stare at Malfoy's dot. He was simply watching his snow globe entranced, mouthing along the words to the lovely melody that was playing on repeat as he saw a tiny kitten being rescued by its mum. He has never in his life received something so amazing which led him to a worrisome thought.</p><p>How the hell does one thank such thing?</p><p>The next day Harry tried to approach Malfoy but it appeared to be a lot harder than he has originally assumed. They bumped into one another quite often but it always ended with Harry being a dense git and Malfoy walking away haughtily.</p><p>Not keen on giving up, he grabbed his cloak and headed for the common room where Malfoy was all by himself just like pretty much every single night since they came back, dropping the material onto his arm he strolled over, this time not minding to be noticed.</p><p>"How come your mum left?" Malfoy jumped 10 feet in the air, whipping his head around with speed that made Harry worried if his neck would break.</p><p>"What the hell are you doing here Potty?"</p><p>"I asked first."</p><p>"Jesus, how old are you?" Malfoy got up abruptly and before he could have come up with a better plan Harry did the first thing that came to his mind, wanting him to stay. "Please don't leave."</p><p>Malfoy definitely stilled but perhaps the whining, desperate tone was the one that casted such shock over him not the actual want to do as told.</p><p>Harry tried to think what he'll say but figured that it was always Malfoy who did the talking, making sure that their relation is right where it always have been so Harry went for the like-a-bandaid method knowing that Malfoy will be gobsmacked than he'll call Harry a twerp and they'll leave it at that.</p><p>"Er...I-I just came to thank you for the gift so yeah...er...thanks."</p><p>"Merlin you actually are even worse than I remembered, not even having the ability to talk anymore, stop being a sap anyways I pulled you so I gifted you, that's it. How can you function with that much social awkwardness?"</p><p>"I am aware. I just wanted to let you know that I appreciated it, how did you make it?"</p><p>"I believe I was clear when I said I wish not to discuss such intellectual things with you, did you even bother to read my letter? Honestly Potty you're such a spoiled, ill-fitted idiot we read the cards that people give us!"</p><p>"I've read it but you never went into detail, I'm just curious of the spell."</p><p>"Well trust me when I say it's way too advanced for a dim-witted Gryffindor like yourself, in addition no one deserves to learn unless they do their research. I've read exactly 11 books on this particular matter, 7 history based and the rest all advanced magic, none of which is within your capabilities."</p><p>When Harry refused to leave just sitting there he was certain that Malfoy will trot away like the bloody spoiled prince he was but instead he seated himself back, staring with an expression that Harry has learned to recognise through the years. He felt challenged by Harry and won't be the first to get up. Too bad for him since Harry enjoyed sitting in silence with Malfoy whilst the git was already twitching, clearly keen on doing something, saying anything.</p><p>He could never stop it, since they were kids Malfoy just loved the sound of his own voice so Harry plainly smiled when it filled the uncanny common room again, after not more than two minutes.</p><p>"You're so frustrating, I swear I've never met someone just so not made for life. How are even still alive? You have the grace of a busted, hangover unicorn, unable to form a decent sentence by yourself."</p><p>"I'm forming one right now, why did you not answer my question?"</p><p>"She just wanted to be gone from all the judging people who know shit about our family or conditions so she packed up and left, leaving the choice to go with or stay behind up to me since I am a responsible adult and she obviously knew that, see in case we would be talking about you..."</p><p>"Yeah I know I'm an unsocialised, thick Gryffindor who cannot do anything at all...er did I miss any of your main points?"</p><p>"Since you apparently are also unable to listen yes you've missed a lot actually. It is exceedingly discourteous to interrupt someone and I thought that at least you were a good listener but clearly you even lack that skill."</p><p>"So if I gather correctly you think I'm tuning your voice out whenever you speak."</p><p>"I used to give you the benefit of a doubt but now I'm afraid you even have to disappoint me in this way, I cannot believe that you have the decency to pay attention and are still refusing to learn some manner, respect, basic knowledge on how to stay alive, anything."</p><p>Instead of an answer or an insult Harry just grinned back at Malfoy, finding all of this way too amusing to actually take seriously.</p><p>"Can I ask you something?"</p><p>"Absolutely not."</p><p>"I still will, why didn't you keep it?"</p><p>Malfoy turned towards him, expression guarded, his face showing boredom and in no shape or form resembling the mildest of interests but somehow Harry still could tell he was waiting for him to elaborate so he did.</p><p>"You could have given me socks or whatever and keep the globe to yourself, enjoy its benefits but you still gifted it to me, why?"</p><p>"Because I'm not an incapable Gryffindor and also let me just tell you Potter you're one of the worst even amongst those. It is written all over your face, like you blame yourself for every bloody death that happened, like all the mistakes taken place in the entire world is on your shoulders, you are a dense martyr who is still beating himself up for everything that happened. Stop being selfish and think past yourself Potty because not everything is about you. However you clearly haven't managed to figure out such delicacy in life so I figured the globe would help that horrendous scowl that is etched on your face every two seconds when you're not distracted enough to stop being a masochist."</p><p>"I think that that was the nicest thing you've ever said to me, but I got to admit I've zoned out around the middle for a little, remembering all of my past mistakes that led me here, so many innocent people..." Malfoy's eyes were glowing with rage and Harry was unable to finish as he broke down laughing loudly.</p><p>It felt strange he could not remember the last time he crack up so hard but now he had tears running down his face from this encounter whilst Malfoy actually joined him, both of them chuckling on the stupidest thing ever.</p><p>"What the holy hell is going on in here?" Suddenly their confrontation was cut short by Anthony Goldstein the Ravenclaw prefect, behind him many others pilling into the common room. Malfoy was confused not making an attempt to explain whilst Harry felt the same both of them whipping their heads towards the windows.</p><p>It truly appeared to have turned to morning but neither seemed to accept that fact, certain that someone was pulling their leg. There was no one jumping out from behind the recliner though, confirming that it's just a spell and their friends might be messing with them.</p><p>They had a huge audience by the time that Malfoy reacted, standing and walking out without a single word. Everyone followed his form, sauntering towards the door and as soon as the blond strands weren't visible all eyes snapped back to him.</p><p>Wanting to pull the same stunt, Harry cradled his cloak to his chest whilst rising as well, his gaze locked with Hermione's as he backed away only turning at the exit and not looking back.</p><p>It was not a solution to any of his problems but his anxiety was forced down by the lovely melody of his snow globe while he pulled on his robe and fumbled around with his tie, attempting to be put together.</p><p>Although he soon gave up and accepted defeat at the knot like mess on his hands, figuring that maybe Malfoy is plainly correct and Harry is unable to do most things that should be normal for a human to know.</p><p>Harry has never thought that your life could turn a complete 180 in a single night but it did. Hours turned into days that formed weeks where Harry has fallen into a brand new routine which by now was woven into his bones the familiarity calming him whenever it was time.</p><p>The night after that talk Harry turned up in the common room and did not bother with his cloak. Malfoy insulted him, told him to get lost and held a lengthy discussion on how Harry is failing the basic ability to sit properly but they ended up falling into a conversation afterwards.</p><p>The next evening came and the mocking was shorter and the chat longer. That has kept its rate up, gradually turning their relationship into one that was scarily similar to what others might call a friendship.</p><p>*</p><p>Waking up to loud patting Harry rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, thankful that he has not had a nightmare since the globe was gifted to him. Smiling from the thought he got out of bed, refusing to ponder over the giddy feeling blooming in his chest from a singular object.</p><p>The lads were extremely obnoxious so Harry did not have a hard time adjusting to the Great Hall either that morning, stirring his porridge carelessly. Ron was talking away, his hands gesturing wildly around on how amazing the match was so Harry got some of his meal across his cheek a few times his elbow knocked out of its route and also had to be aware of his friend since he randomly remembered Harry being the reason of his happiness and tried to tackle him with his affection.</p><p>After a long day Harry was waiting for the lads to fall asleep whilst shaking his globe that kept twinkling with the majestic snow swirling around the castle.</p><p>As the walls have become transparent Harry's mouth dropped open, his fingers weakening and hold too loose, the globe slipping from between them and thumping gently against his covers. Harry refused to blink even after the castle solidified under the intense gaze he had on it.</p><p>He did not just see that. Impossible.</p><p>Licking his lips in attempt to make up for the fact that his entire mouth went dry he grabbed it again and shook it, holding his breath subconsciously.</p><p>Yet again it happened just like before and Harry needed a few seconds to collect his mind.</p><p>The globe was showing things that could make one happy before but for the first time the only thing appearing was Malfoy standing there. The next time he shook it, it was the two of them talking in front of the fire, the atmosphere soft, almost fragile around the image.</p><p>The idea did not seem so far-fetched, but at the same time it was the wildest thing Harry could think of. Sure he did go every night to meet Malfoy for 7 weeks now and they did talk hours on end each time but it's not like that made Harry happy.</p><p>Heading towards the common room Harry was determined to ask Malfoy why on earth he put pictures of the two of them or simply himself into the present he gave.</p><p>Malfoy was already there and as much as Harry tried to reason with himself he couldn't stop his heart rate picking up, just like every time he came. At first Harry was certain he will stop showing up when he sees that Harry is joining him every evening but it never happened and that filled Harry with nauseating amount of warmth almost making him feel safe from the presence of the blond git.</p><p>"See you're still not showing much development in the socialising area, Potter you do not stop and stare at someone without saying anything that's plain creepy." When Harry did not move just ogled the other lad, his mouth slightly open from all the emotions that were running through him in that moment, none making any sense or connecting with anything, Malfoy rolled his eyes and turned towards him with a single eyebrow arched in a questioning manner.</p><p>"How did you come up with all the things the globe shows?" The question appeared to have caught Malfoy off guard like he has long forgotten about the gift that started all of these odd <em>get-togethers</em>.</p><p>"Well that's a tad bit random but then again I don't know why I would expect more from someone who talks without ever thinking or the effort to try and construct sentences with any sort of care. How did you even became this illiterate?" Harry did not even feel offended or impatient he knew that Malfoy will say something along those lines and somehow turn this into a great lesson and reflect on Harry's poor upbringing.</p><p>Though like always his question was not ignored and all of Malfoy's insults have long lost their bite, sounding almost fond, the bickering they engulfed in never getting sharp in any shape or form.</p><p>"To answer your-<em>horribly</em>-phrased question it was not me who came up with them that would be pointless. Assuming that the ways I could think of being happy would make you happy is almost ludicrous but seeing we're talking about you here I'll look past the preposterous idea that must have led you to such conclusion. It's simply a charm, what brought this up? Did you see something spicy and you cannot accept that about yourself? I'm not sure I can think of anything else why you'd have a look on your face that shows you just walked into McGonagall and Flitwick making out or something." Chuckling at his own assumption, Harry had no desire to laugh right in that moment.</p><p>"Did you actually see something like that? Sweet Merlin that's hilarious..." Malfoy was clearly amused but Harry refrained from responding, tuning out Malfoy to some point until his next sentence came. "Seriously Potty it's okay, stop your martyr act right about now, the globe is probably getting to know you, it is supposed to get more and more personal the more you use it. I was just kidding, yeah? Are you actually that scared of what you saw?"</p><p>Sighing heavily Harry sank into the couch, making sure that there is a decently sized space between the two of them. "I'm not scared, it just simply showed something with a face that I recognised this time. So you are saying that it's normal to like see friends in it?"</p><p>"Of course Potter, don't be dumb. Friends, family, loved ones the people that make you happy will appear in the reflection of your glee, that's pretty much the point."</p><p>"And what if the first person I saw was not even the closest to me?"</p><p>"It knows your mind Potter and shows you what it desires to see, it does not rank your halfwits of friends according to how much of undying love you have for each. Sweet Salazar I should have known you're being absurd for something like this. Tell me did you see the redhead in it and felt bad for Granger, felt personally accountable that you preferred to spend time with Thomas instead of Finnegan when he blows up something?" Malfoy was still highly entertained while Harry stored everything that was said away into his brain and for now shut it all out because he was not ready to deal with the 'It knows your mind Potter' part.</p><p>"Anywho Quidditch is about to start up again, the first match is between you guys and Hufflepuff are you excited?" The shift was as seamless as it could have made and maybe even Malfoy admitted that since Harry was taking it so seriously there's was no way of forcing a smoother transition so instead of calling his ability to lead conversations out, Malfoy simply answered the question and the two fell into the usual ease of their chats.</p><p>Every time Malfoy bad mouthed Harry, he smirked back at him, the two easily stepping past the tone of each others' words without taking anything said to heart. It was rare they had a deep conversation and when they did it was usually about something in the past or just in the general world, never their own personal lives. They never discussed that.</p><p>Although Harry was fine no matter what, Malfoy was actually very perceptive and his opinions on things were quite fascinating, the knowledge he had gathered from stuff that interests him truly stunting Harry. He had to admit that the blond was great to talk to because of said trait, some might find it repulsive or annoying-maybe Harry used to as well-but he technically just got obsessed over the tiniest of things and once it was done there was nothing stopping Malfoy.</p><p>He did research, he got involved, he read whatever was regarding the matter and it might be over-the-top to some but Harry found it almost endearing. Everytime they talked about such event his eyes got this glint in them, shining brightly whilst he shared all of the knowledge he has gathered with Harry and he just accepted the fact that he actually enjoys that. He, Harry Potter, loves to listen to stories that has absolutely nothing to do with him, certainly do not interest him but still somehow when it comes from Malfoy his heart fills with warmth as he listens intently and watches the blond git with a lazy smile stretched across his lips.</p><p>"...oh you're such an uncultured swine, absolutely enraging how flopped your education must be so in 1927" Harry's smile only widened when he interrupted Malfoy, not getting what he had just mentioned about bowtruckles, and cut him off yet again.</p><p>"So why do you, such a higher spirit, a true reflection of something as unique as an ancient rare unicorn simply better than the rest of us fool mundanes, would talk to me about such things?"</p><p>"Because even if you're genuinely a lost cause, solemnly existing to annoy me with your dim-witted questions you actually listen." Malfoy's usual haughty tone deformed into one resembling sadness, making Harry's heart twist but he figured they should try to keep it light-hearted since they don't do the serious shit.</p><p>"Really not even Zabini he always pays so much attention to you." It was meant to be a silly little tease but Malfoy only smiled dejectedly.</p><p>"Blaise is nice, and in all shape and form better than any of the Gryffindors, but he doesn't care. Believe it or not, most simply think I'm obsessive and insane, that whatever interests me I go mad and dig so badly that it will ruin my sanity one day. They think that that's why I always read about old stuff because people in the present cannot handle my smouldering ways and how I overwhelm them, trying so hard to know the little things about someone."</p><p>Harry swallowed hard, not sure how to handle such a fragile moment with Malfoy, who was all of the sudden apparently fine to make himself vulnerable. Maybe the git is right after all and Harry truly is bad at social situations.</p><p>"I think that the little things are what make us who we are, that's actually what people should pay attention to not what everyone else can see, then why are you close to me, specifically you could choose anyone if they're all the same? And for what it's worth I like listening to you ramble about all of these things so please do tell me what happened in 1927?"</p><p>A gentle smile graced Malfoy's face, one that Harry's known to be rare so he cherished these moments, and he eased back into their conversation with what sounded almost like a relieved tone. Harry understood that though, he truly did. It is hard to open up and Harry felt like Malfoy is even more complex than he was.</p><p>Harry was never one to share his dreams, fears or most of his thoughts with anyone, perhaps raised to deal with things alone maybe it was just truly his personality he still felt that Malfoy was more than that.</p><p>It was almost like the blond lad was itching to share but refused to, like he made conscious decisions on how much he shows to the outside, able to just put on an act whenever he damn pleased and fool whoever was around to witness whilst Harry simply refused to talk about things that go on inside his head.</p><p>He never tried to hide them though, he wore his heart out on his sleeve so when one bothered enough to try and sense his mood they were more than capable to tell, with Malfoy you just could never be sure.</p><p>The fact that they used to despise each other made Harry feel safe with him in a sense, letting more of his inner debates to show to him. He was faced with his fame since he was eleven and he had to grow up knowing that most people just care about his name. They do not care how he drinks his tea, what he sings quietly to himself in the shower, where he goes to be alone. No one cared for him before, only the big Harry Potter, the-boy-who-lived.</p><p>And then there was Malfoy who could not give less of a crap about Harry's infamous past, his war glory or any achievements. He simply decided to hate Harry with all his might and now apparently he's come to the conclusion to hate him less and talk more. Not for a second was he trying to gain something out of this and Harry had no idea how much he needed that.</p><p>Besides his friends he's never met anyone like that, even amongst the gryffindors most look at him with admiration, some even with grudge about their losses but no one is like Malfoy. Maybe not even Hermione or Ron, they were always the ones there for him but now they got their own team and Harry's stuck to the side.</p><p>He sees how much they always try to include him and he had nothing but himself to blame for feeling left out when he repeatedly declines their offers but he feels like an intruder. They need time to spend together and Harry shouldn't always hang around, third wheeling.</p><p>But sitting there, watching Malfoy bundled in his deep green blanket, his soft blond strands messily caught by a rubber, taming the locks and holding his hair up in a bun like almost every night, his gaze boring into Harry's, orbs intense and sparkling whilst he forms words with such care his voice eager to share his thoughts but always gentle, tiredness showing the later it gets the more it turns into a soft purr, Harry had never felt more included.</p><p>It could be selfish, how he enjoyed the fact that Malfoy was never heard out properly so he settled to talk to Harry, it probably is not very altruistic to be so thrilled about knowing he's alone who gets to hear these stories, who gets to see that glint in his eyes but Harry felt like for once in his life he deserved it. He deserved to be happy and feel like he counts as someone, like if he were to die tomorrow then besides the whole world remembering the great hero who defeated Voldemort there would be one person, Malfoy, who would be faced with something different.</p><p>That it was Harry who died, Harry who was uncultured, and dim-witted but still listened, who was able to piss him off royally but still they met every night, who was his arch nemesis but they still managed to look past that in favour of conversing with each other.</p><p>When his goggle focused back on Malfoy he saw probably the only person who before thinking of anything Harry did would just think of him.</p><p>Spring was taking over fully, the weather almost punishing, making all the students glance outside with longing looks but snapping back to reality with their upcoming exams that are only a few weeks away from now.</p><p>Harry felt a lot better when he came here but that was solely for the nights spent with Malfoy. It was still strange to ponder about that, not completely able to wrap his head around the situation that the two of them has gotten themselves into but the closer the end got the more of Harry's anxiety came back.</p><p>The odd part was that Malfoy appeared to be the same way, they talked about it and agreed that neither has a single idea what to do next. They were both lost in the options, not knowing where to find their place in the world and whilst Malfoy might have been that way upon being left alone by his entire family, Harry plainly only found solitude from his own mind when he was with the blond git, the idea of losing that was scary.</p><p>Like always Harry refused to acknowledge the true meaning of that until the very last second when he was forced to deal with all of it. It's been a long time since he had a nightmare but tonight he ran out of his luck.</p><p>It was not just a simple nightmare, at first it was folding out almost like a play.</p><p>First act: Malfoy laughed in his face on the last day of school and humiliated him for ever trusting the Slytherin.</p><p>Second act: Malfoy left him, stating that he is simply bored of Harry</p><p>Third act: Malfoy and him lost touch after a while not able to pretend that whatever they got going is acceptable by anyone, peoples' judging eyes following them everywhere even in the most secluded areas</p><p>After those 'scenes' it was like Harry would have been awakened from the dream by Malfoy himself but when Harry started to feel calmer he felt cold, his eyes focused seeing they're outside in the dirt. Malfoy was clasping his shirt whilst blood was everywhere and all that kept running through Harry's head was a mantra that it's his own.</p><p>It was not though.</p><p>Sitting up panting, his hair sticking to his forehead from the cold sweat, Harry kicked off his blanket and grabbed his globe whilst pulling the cloak over his shaking form. His breathing came out in short pants, actually losing its length with each time his lung filled, cutting off just a little more air that he needed every second.</p><p>He tried to focus on his globe, the soft melody calming him enough to stumble down the stairs whilst he tried to stay as quiet as possible ogling the picture of him and Malfoy having a snow fight.</p><p>Reaching the dungeons Harry refused to think about consequences of his actions, poking his head out from under the cloak and saying the password. A few weeks prior they had been busted out past curfew so Harry-after showing Malfoy the Marauder's map which highly fascinated the lad-went prepared and whenever someone came close to them they fled the scene, usually ending up in the Astronomy Tower, Gryffindor tower or the dungeons.</p><p>The dungeon extends under the lake so its usual gloominess seemed even more eerie than ever before but Harry just headed straight up the stairs, not thinking about what he's actually doing.</p><p>Reaching the room he known as Malfoy's he slipped past the door without even looking at it properly. He tried not to sigh heavily when his eyes fell onto Malfoy's form, spread out in bed. For whatever reason Harry always imagined him to be a neat sleeper-not like he imagined this much-but in reality he was always a mess but in the most precious way possible.</p><p>Also, he never explained to Harry, but Malfoy refused to close the canopy unless Harry was sneaked into the room which was strange to him at first but got used to it after a while.</p><p>Undoing the ties manually not feeling up for magic he let them slide closed whilst climbing onto Malfoy's bed. He did not appear to be phased but Harry figured he should awake him gently.</p><p>Slipping a hand under his blanket Harry shook his shoulder gently murmuring as soft as his harassed voice let him. "Malfoy? Wake up please."</p><p>Light blue eyes opened fuzzy with sleep, unfocused as their sudden dullness made them appear greyer than they truly were. They soon blinked open fully, the haziness gone as they linked with Harry's own ones that shined brighter than usual from the tears.</p><p>"What's wrong Potter?" The question was gentle almost careful, like he could push Harry over the edge by the smallest thing and have a mess on his hands.</p><p>"I had a nightmare again and it was...I...er...I just cannot sleep and I..."</p><p>"Please breathe Potter, you're scaring me." Harry did not fully register the words, hearing them but unable to make any sense to the nonsense that they translated in his head.</p><p>"Potter, I need you to calm down, just breathe, breathe with me yeah? I'll count and we'll do it together...Harry." The sound of his name snapped him back as he watched Malfoy taking a deep breath, subconsciously trying to mirror it.</p><p>His hand got softly guided to Malfoy's chest, pressed against the warm skin that was exposed in the V line of the neck of his shirt, making Harry's palm lay flat against his thumping heart. The steady beat took over his mind, engaging with it and paying attention to it whilst losing focus of Malfoy's breathing.</p><p>Apparently that was not bad as he felt himself calm hastily, his senses coming back but not overwhelming him with their rapidity. He sensed that his head was uphold by something his nose pressed into soft, silky skin that smelt comforting. The scent was familiar and safe.</p><p>Harry recognised it as Malfoy's as he slowly understood that his face was buried into his neck, somewhere along the lines he must have leaned forward. A tender touch was running up and down his back, warmth creeping under his skin in its way, raising shivers along his spine.</p><p>"Shhh, it's all right Harry, everything is fine. It is all just fine, you'll see it is. It always is." Malfoy was talking and even though he did not make much sense the softness of his voice almost like velvet was lulling Harry's eyes closed ready to be out cold even though he faintly remembers stating that he will never fall asleep ever again.</p><p>"I'm sorry..." The hand halted on his back for a second, Malfoy clearly not fully realising before that Harry was slowly coming back to his senses. "Don't apologise it's okay Harry, just keep resting yeah? You need that."</p><p>The hand continued on, almost like just with a brush of his fingertips Malfoy was able to stop his muscles tensing, soothing everything in him. "I am truly sorry Draco." With that Harry had no mind paid whether or not he has gotten an answer, his eyes gave up the fight and he slipped away, everything taking a toll on his body that technically shut down, refusing to work for him.</p>
