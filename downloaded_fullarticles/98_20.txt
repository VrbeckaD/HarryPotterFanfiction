    <p>Harry Potter belongs to JK Rowling<br/>This story belongs to Honsuka Sara<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>Fred Weasley knew that he was a drop out student and without his NEWTS, it was impossible to get a work in the ministry. Fortunately, he also knew that he was a natural entrepreneur and both with his twin brother, George, he would make galleons from their upcoming joke shop named Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. They even had funds already, thanks to the chosen one, the one and only, The Mighty Harry Potter. A lot of work had been done by then for the shop. For the last three months since he set the lovely fireworks inside Hogwarts, there were more than ten new products already that they had invented. Now they felt like enough and had started to mass produced them, so Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes could be opened by the end of January. Many things to do---the shop’s interior, advertisements, etc. He should be busy. So, it confused him the most as to why he slept in a very comfortable bed from nowhere he knew and by the light from the window, it already past 9 at least.</p><p>	What am I doing here? </p><p>	He blinked his eyes repeatedly, trying to remember the last thing happened before he blacked out and/or sleep when the door in the farthest wall suddenly opened and not two seconds later, he was engulfed by a girl who looked like Hermione’s elder sister. George was right behind her, but something must be off with him. He looked like he had a gulp of that aging potion they made back then in Hogwarts as breakfast.</p><p>	“Hey, easy, easy,” Fred said. But it was more like whispers. Must be the sleeping, he thought. His voice was a little rougher and he didn’t like it very much. “Doesn’t mean I hate it being hugged by such a pretty girl, but who are you?”</p><p>	The girl in his arms suddenly froze. So did George. It looked like he said something wrong, but hey, what’s wrong?</p><p>	“Er, is it something I said?”</p><p>	Now the girl---hey, she’s looked like Hermione so much! Did Ron ever mention that Hermione got a big sister?---was standing, looking at him in disbelieve. Or was she Hermione? Fred didn’t know that a girl in puberty could change so much in a few months.</p><p>	“Fred, mate, what is the last thing you remember?” said George, pressing every single word carefully.</p><p>	Fred tried to remember again, but his head felt like it’d hit by hippogriff not long ago. Perhaps he’s here because a potion gone wrong? “Actually, I don’t really remember. Just know that now we’re out of school and Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes is coming soon! Have you heard that, young lady? That’s a place to make you smile all day!”</p><p>	“I’ll get the healer,” the Hermione look a like finally said. Then she stormed out of the room, leaving the twin brothers to talk to each other pore privately. </p><p>	“Hey, George,” Fred whispered not long after. “Is she Hermione or her secret elder sister? Thought no one from her family is a wizard or witch!”</p><p>	George walked to him, letting himself sat in one of the chairs beside the bed. “No, she’s Hermione.”</p><p>	“Merlin! How could she age that much? We just met her three months before!”</p><p>	“Hey Fred, weird question, do you think you can tell me how old are you?”</p><p>	“Weird question indeed! I solemnly swear that I am seventeen of course!” Fred grinned ear to ear.</p><p>	When he looked at George, his twin seemed like he wanted to throw up. “Merlin help us.”</p><p>	“What? Why?”</p><p>	“We’re twenty five, brother, and because of that reason, I thought I could left you unsupervised in the dungeon, working on our newest pastilles.” George grimaced. “I’m not kidding. I can’t just sugar coated everything before Hermione and the healer come.”</p><p>	“Next thing you say must be that Hermione is my wife.”</p><p>	“That I am. Any complaint?” The voice from the door said.</p><p>	Hermione came with the healer and Fred gulped. Merlin, he lost his memories for eight years? But the only things that came through his lips was, “You’re not with Ron?”</p><p>	“You git! If you haven’t got a bed yourself in St. Mungo’s right now, it’d be me sending you here.” Hermione, on the other hand, felt relieved that Fred could still joking. It meant that except from the memory loss, her husband is alright.</p><p>	“You should be scared, brother, for she knows more dark spells than anyone alive right now,” pressed George, a small smile slipped in.</p><p>	“George!”</p><p>	“What? It’s true! You read every single book in Black Library after the war!”</p><p>	“Wait. War? What war?”<br/>
