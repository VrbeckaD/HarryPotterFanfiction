  <em> <strong>Prologue</strong> </em>
</p><p>The war was won, Lord Voldemort had been defeated and the Light prevailed against the Dark.</p><p>Victory was bittersweet.</p><p>Celebrations were halted when a large unidentified object was launched into the sky and dispersed what appeared to be a unique firework makeup. At first, it was assumed to be part of the party, but exactly one hour later a dark and sinister discovery was made. There, at the LeStrange stronghold-previously Hagrid's cabin, lay a complicated system of runes and symbols on what appeared to be a launch pad. In the next room, a magically reinforced box surrounded by breached wards lay ajar-the lid adorned with carved symbols similar to the launch pad.</p><p>Identical discoveries were made in numerous locations around the world in Death Eater controlled shops, houses, everything they could find that seemed innocent and undisturbed. Lord Voldemort's backup plan: a magically weaponized disease unlike any other in medical history, was unleashed.</p><p>Wizards, witches, and squibs from all walks of life as well as several different countries were struck by the disease. No one was safe.</p><p>From what the Healers and Ministries could discern, the main victim pool were people from older generations, pregnant women with no pre-existing health or immune system issues and families of Pureblood descent-no matter how long removed. Squibs and Muggleborns were the largest percentage lost, but all groups were equally at risk in future.</p><p>A cure was frantically sought, but elusive.</p><p>The Weasley family suffered even more loss. Fred fell to the disease a mere two hours after it's release, Percy a few weeks later and died two hours after exposure. The older Weasley had been stubborn and it helped him survive longer than most, but not long enough. When a month had gone by without an illness related death, the entire Wizarding World dared to hope. The illness had taken almost eighty percent of the population.</p><p>Damaged and utterly destroyed buildings were beginning reconstruction, the dead put to rest by survivors. Their wounds-physical and psychological, began to heal.</p><p>Hermione attended the mass funerals and smaller services, crying more than she felt she could after everything. So many lives had been ended, so much fear and pain spread throughout the world through the year.</p><p>Now, at least, there was a chance for peace and healing.</p><p>Once the last of the fallen were laid to rest, the sole focus was rebuilding Hogwarts and other key businesses. Life moved on as it should.</p><p>When the majority of Hogwarts was complete, need spread like wildfire. Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt, elected two weeks after the final battle, had passed a new law-a sort of marriage law.</p><p>Specifics were not released, only the reassurance that all would be explained at a later date.</p><p>Exact one week later, the Daily Prophet held true to its word. The headline read: Marriage Law Matches?</p><p>Nervous, Hermione quickly flipped to the page number provided for more information.</p><p>
  <em>One week and two days ago, we received unconfirmed reports and rumors of a new law designed to repopulate the Wizarding community. Since then, there has been no word-confirmed or otherwise, leaving no small amount of questions unanswered.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Me, Myself and I is happy to inform you that has changed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>During an interview earlier this week, Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt confirmed the Marriage Law's existence. He also divulged some details on the mechanics of the Law.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>An elaborate system of complex, specially designed enchantments and current consensus profiles have been used to match one witch to the wizards that best suite her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I have been informed by Minister Shacklebolt that he has been working closely with MACUSA and Ministries all over the globe to set up a united network for this Law. This should prevent inbreeding in future with how low percentages are across the board in each country.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Witches and wizards starting from the age of fifteen and ending at the age of seventy are required by Law to participate. Failure to comply will result in a minimum sentence of six years in Azkaban and a penalty fine of fifty thousand galleons. Further failure to comply will result in a snapped wand, and a minimum sentence of ten years in Azkaban. Should this incentive prove unsatisfactory, the accused will have his or her magic bound and will be exiled into the muggle community.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The matches will be sent to each person eligible in the form of a sealed letter. The minimum number of matches allowed per witch is three, the maximum number is ten. All matches are to be wed no longer than three months from the date of receiving the letter and the marriage is to be consummated. NO EXCEPTIONS!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Two children are expected from each individual couple in the group marriage; two per husband. Failure to comply will result in a minimum sentence of twelve years in Azkaban and a penalty fine of one hundred thousand galleons. Further failure to comply will result in a snapped wand and a minimum sentence of twenty years in Azkaban.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Keep your eyes and windows open, your future will soon arrive via owl.</em>
</p><p>Hermione felt the blood drain from her face, leaving her entire body feeling cold.</p><p>There was a Law in place to force people to marry and procreate, some at the tender age of fifteen!</p><p>This couldn't be happening.</p><p>The entire Law went against everything the Light fought for in the war, everything they believed in.</p><p>She realized another horrifying thought. The article mentioned nothing about what happened to witches or wizards who physically couldn't produce children.</p><p>Anger began to boil in the young witches veins. Innocents had died to being the end to tyranny and corruption for the world. This Law was vile and immoral and disgusting! She wanted no part in it or anything to do with it!</p><p>Kingsley should know better, having fought with the Light. She was itching to find the man and demand answers, give him a piece of her mind. Hex his family bits off. Her rational mind told her that all that would get is time to cool off in a cell for attacking the Minister of Magic. The angry part of her delighted in the idea.</p><p>She wrote a short missive to Harry. He would help her keep her head and his support would be appreciated when the blasted letter arrived.</p><p>With Hermione's temper calmed, her mind turned to the other point in the matter. Her husband's.</p><p>There were chances that she could be matched with Death Eaters, men on the far side of the age requirement-wrinkled and soft minded. Cruel men, complete strangers from both sides of the globe, members of the Order, survivors she went to school with-the list of possibilities was near endless.</p><p>Damn Kingsley Shacklebolt. Damn the Ministry.</p><p>She was too young to be tied down, there were things she wanted to do before she started a family. Travel, start and maintain a steady career, find a good man she loves that understands both her and her love for her career.</p><p>Damn Kingsley Shacklebolt to any and all hells that may exist. She thought angrily.</p><hr/><p>Hermione paced the kitchen as she waited for Harry.</p><p>The waiting was the worst part. The unknown.</p><p>What if she had to marry Shacklebolt? She'd probably try to strangle the man before they made it to the alter. Even if not, he most likely wasn't exempt from the Law and that made her feel a tad better.</p><p>She ran through the known survivors of the war and disease, trying to guess the odds of who she may end up with. Not all of the news was good; a good amount were married, another decent chunk were Death Eaters, and the last group comprised of people she went to school with or knew as acquaintances and complete strangers.</p><p>Restless and impatient, she began to pace the path between the kitchen and living room.</p><p>Where was the blasted letter?!</p><p>The fireplace roared to life, the flames changed from a brilliant deep red to an eerie but equally bright emerald green. A familiar soot covered figure stepped out onto the hearth and dusted the excess soot from their clothes and hair. Harry strode across the living room and pulled her into a hug.</p><p>"Has it come yet?" He asked, pulling back to study her.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He sagged a bit, relief flooding his features. "I'll wait here. We'll read our letters together. It's going to be alright, Mione."</p><p>She wished she could believe that.</p><p>
