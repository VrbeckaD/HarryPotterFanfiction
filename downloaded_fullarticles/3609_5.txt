    <p>Hermione Granger had never felt a loss quite as deeply as the one that was currently tearing her heart to bits. It quite literally felt like she was being torn apart from the inside out. Though it had been nearly three weeks since the death of the man she had thought she’d marry, she still felt as broken and lost as she had the second she’d seen Fred’s body among the dead. Hermione had hoped to be numb by now, had hoped against hope that she would feel less pain. But no. No, she only felt worse and worse with each passing day. And the worst part? No one even knew. </p><p>No one had known that Fred and Hermione had been dating for nearly three years. Aside from George, that is. She and George felt alone in their grief, though they knew the others felt it. For them however, it was as if a piece of themselves had been taken away. Hermione herself felt like her left lung had been collapsed, crushed under the weight of his death. She couldn’t breathe properly, anyways. Felt like she was dying sometimes. And the nightmares didn’t help. Nightmares where Fred’s body was on top of her, crushing her and breaking every bone in her body. The weight of her grief was becoming something physical, something that could eventually kill her if she didn’t do something about it. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione and George had seen each other once since Fred’s death and that had been the day she’d found out that she was pregnant. She’d feared it since Fred’s death and, after missing her period, she’d gone in to a private muggle doctor for a check. Of course, it came out positive and Hermione was absolutely terrified. She knew that she’d have to tell the truth now. Tell everyone that she and Fred had been dating for three years and that she’d gotten herself knocked up with his baby. She avoided it for two months after the final battle but eventually George had convinced her to tell them at Sunday brunch. He’d be there the entire time, he said, and they wouldn’t hate her either. </p><p>Hermione woke up that morning with a pit in her stomach. She wanted to send a quick owl and tell Molly she wasn’t coming but...Molly was so happy that she was coming. Hermione couldn’t back out now. Besides, George was already preparing them for her announcement. And so she got up and put on a nice sundress. It was a nice day out and Molly had said they’d eat lunch in the garden. After slipping on some sandals and fixing her hair a bit, Hermione apparated over to the burrow with her wand. George had said that no one would attack her but she never could know for certain. She didn’t know Charlie that well, after all and Ron had a temper. As much as she loved and trusted him, she could not lose Fred’s baby because she’d been too naive. </p><p>George was there when she entered the back garden. He’d gathered his family and was warning them quietly that they were not to interrupt Hermione even once. He glared at Ron as he said this. At his side, Harry took this glare seriously and nodded, placing a hand on Ron’s arm. Hermione went quickly to George’s side and hugged him. He hugged her back, whispering a reassuring word in her ear. When she pulled away, Molly and Arthur looked confused. </p><p>“I’m sorry to bother you all but...there’s something you need to know. Something I’ve been keeping from you all. I...I’m sorry that Fred isn’t here for this. I wish he was because he’d know the right words.”</p><p>“No he wouldn’t. He’d stumble over them and look at you for the answer.” George put in helpfully, causing her to smile at the thought.</p><p>“What’s going on you two? What’s the secret?” Bill asked softly but in a voice filled with authority.</p><p>“Harry and Ron, you knew I was dating someone these past years. Someone I love with all myself, didn’t you?”</p><p>Harry nodded, seeming to understand. Ron hadn’t gotten there yet. He was nodding, looking terribly confused. George stepped in front of her for a moment protectively. </p><p>“Before Hermione says anything else, I’m going to warn everyone here. You will not judge her for this. It was her partner’s choice to keep this a secret, not hers. You will not harm my sister for this.”</p><p>Hermione pulled him back and looked to the crowed gathered before her. She felt the tears gather in her eyes and blinked them back. </p><p>“I was in love with Fred Weasley. He...we were planning to get married and we were going to tell you all. I...I don’t...I can’t...George please...” </p><p>She turned to the man who had become her brother, tears streaming openly down her face now. He pulled her against him and shushed her for a few moments before turning to their family. Molly was crying, her face hidden against Arthur’s chest. Ginny was crying as well, staring at Hermione with a look of heartbroken sympathy. Bill was comforting Fleur who seemed to be struggling against her own tears. Charlie looked calm but sad. Ron was in shock but his arm was outstretched towards Hermione as if he wanted to comfort her. Harry was sobbing, his glasses on his lap, his face hidden in Ginny’s shoulder. </p><p>“That isn’t all. Hermione can’t say it and I wish Fred were here to say it so that I didn’t have to. Lord knows he’d be so bloody proud right now. Hermione is pregnant. Twins. She’s already seen a muggle doctor and we’ve an appointment next week with St. Mungo’s. I’ll be supporting her throughout this entire ordeal because Fred would probably demand it. He loved her. Fred loved her more than he ever loved himself and I know that he would want someone to take care of her. Therefore, I will be stepping in to do just that.”</p><p>Hermione, still crying, unglued herself from George and turned to face the family. Ginny was the first to rise from her seat. She flew at Hermione, tears streaming down her face, and hugged her tightly. Sobbing, Hermione hugged her back. Molly got up and hugged them both tightly as well. When they pulled apart, Molly’s hands framed Hermione’s face as she spoke.</p><p>“You were afraid we’d be angry with you. Oh, my daughter. There’s no way I could be angry with you for this. This is a gift in the wake of something terrible. You’ll always be my little girl.”</p><p>The words sent Hermione into a new waves of sobs and she hugged Molly for all she was worth. Soon, everyone was joining in the hug. This truly was a miracle, George knew. He looked up to the sky and promised his twin that he wouldn’t let him down. Not now, not ever. Hermione and the twins would be cared for and loved until the end of his days.</p>
