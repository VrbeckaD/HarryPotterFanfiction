    <p><em>First day jitters.</em> It’s a feeling she hasn’t felt in <em>years</em>, not since she left Hogwarts for good. Truth be told, she’s never had them so badly. Yes, at Hogwarts, her peers had all heard of her. They had all heard of the rumours surrounding the Lestrange family name. She’s sure she heard a new one every day… but she was just a <em>child</em>.</p><p>Leta Lestrange is fully grown now. She’s a witch of many talents, so capable of so many things… So capable that rumours have become more believable than ever. The whispers have become more like white noise now as she’s led to her new office beside that of Torquil Travers. It’s still a mystery to most, including herself, just why the Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Department would hire a <em>Lestrange</em> as his personal assistant, but so far nobody dared to question his decision.</p><p>“Since when does <em>Leta Lestrange</em> work for the Ministry?”</p><p>Two wizards stand side-by-side, watching as the young witch settles into her new space. The first one, rather short with enough gel in his hair to lubricate a motor, stares with <em>disgust</em>. The second, however, wears an expression that is surprisingly fond.</p><p>“I mean, you know that family! They’re <em>evil!</em>” the short wizard, continues. “Surely her father must be paying somebody handsomely to have her here.”</p><p>The second wizard scoffs. “Shut up, Hembrooke,” he laughs, hands slipping casually into the pockets of his suit jacket. “You know, I’ve never met Leta Lestrange before. I’ve heard good things about her.”</p><p>“<em>Good things?</em> Of a <em>Lestrange?</em> Theseus, are you not feeling well?” Eyes wide, Hembrooke glances between his prodigy and their new peer.</p><p>“She’s friends with my brother,” Theseus explains. “Now if you’ll excuse me---“</p><p>Leta is still unpacking stationary when she hears a knock on her office door. When she glances up, her face remains stoic. “I’m here to <em>work</em>, not make friends,” she states sternly.</p><p>Despite that, Theseus still wears a warm smile. “Well, that’s unfortunate. I thought you might be tired of Newt and his shenanigans by now.”</p><p>She freezes at the mention of her best friend. How could this stranger know of their friendship? Surely, he’s nearly a <em>decade</em> older than her. She’s never seen him at Hogwarts, and no matter how popular she might be amongst the wizarding community, people talk about much worse things than who she associates herself with.</p><p>Eyes narrow slightly as she stares at the other, and then it hits her. Curly auburn locks, freckles mapped over his complexion like constellations… “You must be Theseus,” she says softly. Somehow, she relaxes a bit at this.</p><p>“Newt’s told me a lot about you,” the auror states, stepping further into the office as though taking her realization as an invitation.</p><p>“Well, he’s told me practically <em>nothing</em> about you.”</p><p>Although her words do <em>sting</em>, Theseus can’t pretend he’s surprised. Ever since he had become an auror, his relationship with his brother had been rocky. “What <em>did</em> he tell you?”</p><p>Brow raises at the question, and Leta moves to sit in her chair, gesturing for him to take a seat across from her. “That you’re an auror. And that you insisted on singing Christmas Carols for an entire hour three years ago.” He can’t help but interject with a snort before she continues, “What has he told you about me?”</p><p>“Well, he doesn’t really shut up about you,” Theseus begins, undeniably amused. Leta, on the other hand, appears unfazed if not defensive. Nonetheless, he approaches her, taking his seat. “He says that you’re good with plants, and you make all these amazing potions. He basically thinks you’re the greatest person in the world, and it appears he wasn’t lying when he said you were incredibly <em>pretty</em>.”</p><p>The statement should make her blush, but instead, her jaw clenches. Gaze flicks toward a stack of papers before her, fingers shuffling through them as an excuse to avoid eye contact. “And what has your friend had to say about me so far?” She can feel the other auror watching from the hallway, knows already he mustn’t be too crazy about her with the look of terror on his face.</p><p>The laugh that leaves Theseus’ chest is almost <em>overwhelming</em> to Leta, but she doesn’t let it show. “Oh, Hembrooke! He definitely thinks you’re wicked. I’d take advantage of that while you can.”</p><p>When she glances back toward the other, she notices him scurrying off. Somehow, it brings a subtle smirk to her lips. “Perhaps I should,” she agrees. Finally, she sits back in her seat, summoning a quill. “It’ll have to be later, however. Travers has already given me a nice pile of paperwork to fill out. First day on the job, and one of your peers has lost a <em>finger</em>.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’d be Danton. Get used to seeing his name in your incident reports,” Theseus grins. There’s hesitation before he does rise to his feet, offering out a hand to the witch. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you, Leta. Welcome to the Ministry Family.”</p><p>“<em>Lestrange</em>.” The name comes out almost <em>bitter</em>, but far more quickly than she can stop herself. After an awkward pause, she rises to take his hand in a firm handshake.</p><p>Rather than argue, Theseus offers a nod. “<em>Lestrange</em>.”</p><p>“And you as well,” she continues. Though forced, lips spread into a small smile. “I suppose I should thank you for the warm welcome.”</p><p>The gratitude seems to perk Theseus’ mood up again, putting that signature grin back on his lips as his hand falls back to his side. “Of course,” he shrugs, backing toward the office door once more. “If you need anything, don’t be a stranger.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>It’s half past noon by the time Leta sees him again. Oddly enough, it’s her failed attempt at <em>avoiding</em> all contact with her new coworkers that seems to catch his attention, has him jogging to catch up with the girl on her way out for some fresh air.</p><p>“<em>Lestrange!</em> Lestrange, wait up!” he calls, catches up with her effortlessly despite her increased pace. When he does, she comes to a halt, letting out a <em>huff</em>.</p><p>“Can I help you, Scamander?” she urges, brows raised expectantly. “Because I’m currently off the clock, so if you have paperwork, just leave it in my---“</p><p>He stops her with a shake of his head. “No, no. I just wanted to see how you’re making out so far,” he smiles. It’s sincere, which almost scares her. “First day in this department can be a bit overwhelming. Is Travers treating you well?”</p><p>She wants to roll her eyes, or run in the opposite direction as fast as she can, but that would draw too much attention. Instead, she folds her arms over her chest. “He’s keeping me occupied,” she replies plainly.</p><p>Theseus smirks. “Well, that’s good to hear. Say, why don’t you join us for lunch? I know you’re not here to <em>make friends</em>, but---“</p><p>“<em>Us?</em>” she interrupts. Brows knit in confusion until she spots her, and a leggy blonde skips up to take Theseus’ arms.</p><p>“Chenault,” he greets the woman with a kiss to the cheek.</p><p>“Schnookums!” Her voice is shrill enough to make Leta cringe, thankfully only on the inside. On the outside, she remains unimpressed. The blonde, however, seems more than happy to join the conversation. “Who’s this? Did the department finally get another maintenance witch?”</p><p>Leta almost looks <em>surprised</em> at the other witch’s boldness, eyes widening slightly as if to <em>challenge</em> her. “I’m working directly under Torquil Travers, actually. Is it <em>you</em> I see to place my coffee order?”</p><p>The immediate tension has Theseus’ eyes wide and face red, quickly searching for something to say to break the ice. “Chenault, this is Leta Lestrange, Travers’ new assistant. I was just inviting her to eat lunch with us; she’s friends with Newt.”</p><p>Chenault almost appears surprised that Leta even <em>has</em> friends, but almost hides it well. “Well, I made reservations at Maureen’s for us to have dinner. You know, to celebrate your promotion!”</p><p>“It’s not official yet, love,” Theseus reminds the other, clearly getting flustered. Still, she doesn’t give him much of a choice. “I’m sorry, Lestrange, but I suppose there’s no getting out of this.”</p><p>Chenault smirks, pressing a kiss to his cheek with a loud <em>smack</em> which leaves behind a bright pink smudge of lipstick. “Not a chance.”</p><p>The auror gives Leta a sheepish grin. “Perhaps another time, then?” he insists.</p><p>Leta simply shrugs. “Another time.” Unlikely, but she won’t admit it.</p><p> </p><p>After giving Leta a quick pat on the shoulder, Theseus takes his girlfriend’s hand and turns toward the elevator, leaving the young witch to gladly return to her lunch <em>alone.</em></p>
