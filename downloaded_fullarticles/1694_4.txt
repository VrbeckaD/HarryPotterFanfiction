    <p>“Do you ever post anything else?” Harry pointed the screen of his phone at his wife. She could see the picture she had posted only half an hour ago. There, reflected back at her, was Ginny herself phone up and pointing into the mirror, her other hand at her waist. The long white t-shirt that she was still wearing now was held in her teeth, the hem draped artfully, just covering her nipples while most of each of her breasts, massive for her slight frame, could be seen. The finger of her unoccupied hand was pushed into the red, lacy knickers she was wearing, pulling them aside slightly. <br/>“Does it bother you?” Ginny asked, laughing. She put on a mock-baby voice and whined, “Is poor Harry’s masculinity so fragile he can’t cope with his wife’s naughty pictures?”<br/>Harry coloured, annoyed. “I only wondered if you’d ever posted a photo that wasn’t likely to be used as wank-fodder for some creep.” <br/><em>By the looks of it, more than just one</em>, Ginny thought – the like count on the photo had just hit 7,000, a good performance. “It doesn’t bother <em>me</em>, if that’s what you mean,” retorted Ginny, “isn’t a girl allowed to be proud of her body? Do you think I should be posting some bullshit construction of my life instead, like everyone else?” Now she imitated a hyper-posh, Queen’s English tone, “Oh, such fun at the races today, what larks!”<br/>“No,” Harry was clearly angry now, “I’d just like it if you didn’t make everyone think you were such a slut all the time.”<br/><em>A WHAT?! </em> “A what, excuse me?” Her voice was quiet and cold now.<br/>“You heard me. You know your brother follows that account.”<br/>“If you don’t like seeing the photos, Harry, you know what your options are: unfollow the account or shove it up your fucking arse!” She leapt to her feet. <br/>“FINE!” Harry pointedly raised his phone and tapped through to her profile. He unfollowed the account, dropped the phone onto the sofa beside him and sat staring, waiting for her reaction. She turned on her heel and stalked out. <br/><em>It doesn’t fucking matter</em>, she said to herself, <em>my tits get me fifty new followers for every dickhead prude, anyway</em>. The word came back to her… <em> ‘Slut…’ </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the dinner table. Harry had served the food and they were waiting for Ginny’s descent from upstairs where she was changing. They had been waiting a little while and Harry was twitchy… he wondered if this was punishment for earlier. All three sat in their finest outfits, staring around at the room they all knew well. Dinner at the Potters’ was a regular thing and the room, while grand, didn’t yield much of interest after a couple of minutes in silence. Harry had realised how much his wife was the life and soul of these things. He had just opened his mouth to address his friends, unsure as yet of what he would say, when they heard footsteps. </p>
<p>Ginny entered. She was dressed in a long dress. It was midnight blue, formed of a material that had been woven into leaves and flowers, the darker areas forming the pattern and the rest showing through to her skin, shaded paler cyan by the thinner, translucent material. Harry stared at her, the dress was entirely new to him and the cut… the clothes clung to Ginny’s hips, it covered her navel, but the fabric had been cut away around the sides of her abdomen leaving large areas of skin exposed. It cupped her large chest from below but sheared off very early on, but for a thin strip that ran around, hooking over her long neck. It plunged between her breasts leaving the entirety of her cleavage exposed. She greeted all three of them, Harry perfunctorily, and gloried in the impression she had had on her husband. </p>
<p>Harry sat there, all through the first course, struggling not to goggle at her. <em>He can stew tonight</em>, she thought, a slight grin playing round her face, <em>I don’t give a damn how blue his balls get. </em>As they cleared starter plates Harry murmured something about a word with her in the kitchen. He followed her through and closed the door. Ginny took a breath and turned to face him, even in her preparation for the anticipated fight she couldn’t help but enjoy the feel of herself; the way the dress clung to her and the air rushing around the large amounts of exposed flesh. <br/>“What the <em>fuck</em> do you think you’re doing, walking around like that?” Hissed Harry.<br/>Ginny raised an eyebrow. Her question was implied, Walking around like <em> ‘what’? </em><br/>“Your brother and his wife are in there! They don’t want to eat their dinner with your tits in their faces, do they? Is this about earlier?” <br/>Ginny said nothing. <em>Yes, it bloody well is you arsehole! </em><br/>Harry threw up his hands in in furious exasperation. “How dare you do this! You waltz in here, tarted up like some whore and expect no one to notice?”<br/><em>Right. That’s how it is. </em><br/>“Is that what you think?” She spoke at last. Her tone was frosty. “Well, in that case you won’t want me distracting you, will you?” She started towards the door.<br/>“Where do you think you’re going?”<br/><em>Right. Fuck you. </em><br/> “I’m too tired to entertain tonight, Harry. I’m going to bed.” She left the room via the other door that let her out into the hall, rather than back into the dining room. Let him explain, she said to herself as she glided upstairs. His voice was still ringing in her ears. <em> ‘Slut… Whore…’ </em><br/><em>Right. Down to business. </em></p>
<p>She slammed the bedroom door shut but was undressing before the noise had faded. The silk that had so upset Harry pooled at her feet and she stepped out of it. She felt alive, buzzing with a war-like fury and a sudden burst of sexual energy. She picked up her phone and her wand. She reclined back onto the high-pillows of the bed and pushed her arms together, compressing the sides of her breasts so that they bloomed forward. Ginny slid her wand into her cleavage and clamped it there, between her tits. <em>I’ll show him a whore…</em> Her camera was front-facing and trained on her face. She had to frame it just right… Her breasts framed her face on the screen, the wand slicing the bottom of the image in half. Her hands adjusted minutely until the very edges of her nipples were visible, her long red, hair cascading down her face. The camera clicked, and an image flashed up. Her naked collar bones seemed deep and her eyes even deeper. There was a fiery glint in the eyes that stared down the lens. Her pupils seemed to burn bright in her pale face. Her skin was as smooth as her resolve as she typed in her caption: *Feel like a slut… I’ll pick someone random from the first 1,000 likes. If you win you can fuck me however you like. – G xx*</p>
<p>She hit send and lay back, casting her phone to the side of her. It didn’t stop buzzing for 15 minutes.</p>
