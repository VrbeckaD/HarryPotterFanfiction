    <p align="center">Prologue: If Wishes Were Horses</p>
<hr/><p>Tom was sitting alone in the playroom with a 30-piece puzzle in front of him, fully aware of the caretakers whispering about him. The other children were running around him paying little attention to the watchful eyes of the caretakers. He added another piece to the puzzle, smiling as he noticed he had less than half the puzzle down. A warm feeling of pride tingled his fingers and arms and Tom wanted to giggle at the feeling. He added another piece, then another, before one of the younger caretakers finally made her way over to him. She was new, her second week here actually, so she didn’t know to stay away from him like the other caretakers did.</p><p>When he saw her walking towards him, <em> something </em> wanted him to smile, but he just couldn’t. He didn’t <em> want </em> to smile at her. He was having fun and he didn’t want to get his hopes up with her. The others would tell her sooner or later and he’d be hated by her just like he was from the others. A warm breeze raised the hairs on the back of his neck and the urge to smile left, but that <em> something </em>stayed- he knew that it would never leave him for anything, and he could make himself smile for that.</p><p>She crouched in front of him, balling her skirts to keep them off the floor. She smiled pleasantly and Tom found it in himself to give her a small smile. Not because <em> something </em> wanted him to, only ‘cause he had manners and it would be rather rude. It didn’t stop the tingle of pride that danced from his fingers up his arm though, and Tom smiled wider at the feeling. The caretaker, <em> Martha </em>the something whispered, seemed to be encouraged by his smile and began asking him questions.</p><p>“What are you making Tom?” “Do you like puzzles?” “What is your favorite puzzle?” “Why are you playing by yourself Tom?”</p><p>The last question made Tom look away quickly- not out of shame or hurt, but to hide the scowl that he couldn’t seem to stop. Why would he want to play with the others? They were stupid and mean and they hated Tom, and he hated them right back. He didn’t answer her and went back to his puzzle. She sighed and tried to get him to answer him but he continued to ignore her as his own rage tingled in his lower stomach.</p><p>“Aren’t you lonely Tom?”</p><p>He looked up at her in both confusion and shock. Lonely? Who ever said he was lonely? How could he ever be lonely?</p><p>“No ma’am. I’m never lonely.”</p><p>She doubted that very much, but with no further answer from Tom and him going back to ignoring her, she decided to leave him to his puzzle. <em> What a dumb woman </em> , Tom thought to himself as he placed another piece in the puzzle. The last piece clicked in place and pride tingled his fingers and arms and Tom smiled brightly. <em> Maybe the other kids could be lonely, but I have you. </em></p><p>A pulsing warmth spread from the center of his chest and traveled up his arms and to his shoulders and Tom thought, this must be what a hug feels like.</p>
<hr/><p>Martha became just like all the other caretakers in the orphanage and grew weary of the silent boy who liked to play by himself while the other children laughed and played around him. The more time spent in the orphanage the more she learned to keep away. So far he hadn’t done anything wrong, not at all, but there was something about him that was just <em> off </em>.  He was only at the tender age of five, but she found it hard to stay around him without breaking out in a sweat or shivering from a sudden cold chill. She couldn’t find it in herself to hate the child like some of the other caretakers, or even the Matron on a bad day, but she wasn’t brave enough to stay around him.</p><p>Tom regretted smiling at her all those days ago.</p>
<hr/><p>Tom started calling the foreign entity <em> the something </em> . It didn’t feel right to call it by a specific name because he feels like it has a name and calling it by anything else but it’s name would just be rude. The Matron didn’t raise rude children. So Tom called it <em> it </em> and <em> the something </em> . Maybe others would find it more rude, but Tom also doesn’t know what it is exactly in the first place. Tom thinks it could be a person, since he could swear sometimes he could hear <em> words, </em>but how can a feeling and voices inside Tom’s head and under his skin be a person?</p><p>He looked at books once, on the random time he was able to successfully escape the orphanage and make his way to the library. Most of them were fairy tales and fiction and Tom barely gave them a cursory read through. The other books were medical tomes, and he consumed them with a fervor, but soon- when he learned about the mental studies and the experiments and the stigma- he wanted to burn the books out of existence.</p><p>He wasn’t crazy, and he’d rather die than be taken to the asylum.</p><p>And besides, he was confident that what he feels and hears isn’t near the same as the accounts printed in the books.</p><p>He hides the books deep in the library far far away from curious eyes. The Matron would never willingly step into this building, but Tom can't help the image of her finding them and reading the words and finding the perfect excuse to send him away from all the good people of society. If he thought he could pull it off without being caught, he’d burn the books himself.</p><p>He gave the fairy tales a second chance and found a deep hope that maybe, hopefully, it’s stories were closer to the truth of what he’s dealing with.</p>
<hr/><p>He didn’t dream often, and when he did, he rarely remembered them. He hoped desperately to remember this one, because in this one he was loved.</p><p>He dreamed of a room with red chairs and gold fixtures and the strong warmth of a roaring fire. The room was circular and the walls were made of old stone and Tom felt as if he was home. He walked the large room, trailing hands over the soft plush couches and letting his bare feet brush the rugs.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Tom spun around at the voice, never expecting another person to be part of this strange and wonderful dream.</p><p>A young man stood in front of him, with sun-kissed skin and dark shaggy hair and eyes the most captivating green he’d ever seen.  He was wearing dark robes that were thrown loosely over his clothes and beneath it were a simple white dress shirt and black trousers. A red and gold tie hung loosely around his neck and he seemed to be paused in the motion of stuffing his shirt back into his trousers. Tom was at a loss, as he’d never seen such a captivating person before. Had he? How could he not have remembered him?</p><p>His thoughts were stopped the second the boy smiled brightly, his eyes crinkling in actual happiness and Tom had to stop himself from getting too emotional. No one, ever, smiled this way at him before. Not even the nice lady who gave candy to the orphaned children, or the few people who came in to adopt one of them out. Not even the caretakers or the Matron who he has known his whole life.</p><p>The young man walked over to him quickly with raised arms and something instinctual took over Tom as he spread his arms wide so he can be easily pulled into the man's embrace. He had never been hugged before like this, but he learned how to accept hugs from watching all the other children and seeing the happy normal families from his window.</p><p>The boy was warm, almost hot to the touch, and Tom couldn’t understand why it felt comfortable. He didn’t care much for heat usually, rather preferring cooler temperatures, but this boy’s natural heat thawed Tom’s natural coldness and he coveted it. <em> Yearned </em>for it. Never wanted to let it go. Tom tightened his arms and the mystery boy’s only response was to laugh and tighten his own arms. Almost like he craved Tom’s cool touch to simmer down his own overwhelming heat.</p><p>Tom didn’t know how long they stood there standing in the middle of the room in their embrace. Tom never wanted it to end if he was being honest with himself, but soon the young man moved out of the embrace regardless of Tom’s silent protest. He kept his hands on Tom’s shoulders though, seemingly unable to fully separate himself from Tom’s person, and Tom was secretly pleased. He looked up at the mystery man and when their eyes connected he smiled warmly. Everything about this person screamed comfort and warmth to Tom and he wished desperately to soak up the heat the man gave off in waves.</p><p>“I never expected to see you in here, at least not for a couple more years.” The boy began as he lead Tom over to one of the couches near the fire. He sat next to Tom and draped his arm around his shoulder to pull him close and Tom found himself leaning against the mystery young man. <em> What a strange dream this was </em>, but Tom didn’t complain by the gesture and actually found himself pressing himself as close as he possibly could to the man’s side. It took him a moment to process the mans words actually, and he snapped his head up to stare at the man in confusion.</p><p>“Wait, what do you mean? Where is here? I thought I was dreaming…”</p><p>“Oh,” the boy began looking a little worried. “ I don’t know how much I should tell you given you’re only-”</p><p>“Don’t lie to me!” Tom hissed, separating himself fully from the boys side. How dare he. He didn’t care if he was pretty and warm and kind- he hated when adults lied and schemed and insulted him in this way. He was young but he wasn’t stupid! “Don’t hide things from me! I’m old enough to understand things a lot better than adults.”</p><p>The young man’s eyes widened in shock before a look of concern took over his face. He didn’t dare reach out for Tom again as he seemed to be ready to bolt.  “I’m sorry Tom, that’s not what I meant at all.”</p><p>Tom glared harder. “Then what did you mean? Tell me everything! And no lies- I can always tell when people lie.”</p><p>“It’s not your age that I’m concerned about, believe me, I know more than anyone else what goes on through your mind. You’re bloody brilliant Tom.”</p><p>Tom felt his face grow hot at the sudden praise. He looked away and crossed his arms. No one had ever complimented him and <em> mean </em>it like this guy did so easily. “Don’t try to distract me.”</p><p>The guy laughs, and Tom doesn’t understand why he relaxes when he hears it. Usually nothing good comes from other people's laughter and Tom always feels weary, but this mystery person doesn’t have that same effect on Tom.</p><p>“I can’t tell you much,” He raises a hand to stop Tom’s protest, “and it’s not because I don’t want to. But more than likely when you wake up you’re going to forget this whole conversation, this room, and especially me.”</p><p>“You don’t know that!” Tom hisses, feeling anger rise in him again. Just another adult who likes to keep things from him.</p><p>He sighs, “I do Tom, because you’re not really here. Your subconscious is here with me now, but when you wake up, it’ll be like a distant dream. And we both know you don’t really remember them.”</p><p>It should freak him out, and in truth it kind of does, but Tom is more shocked by how much he <em> knows </em> him. Knows things even people he regularly interact with couldn’t possibly know.</p><p>“When-” Tom stops. It’s hard to get the words out, because the slight fear of having a complete stranger know him so well is slowly dawning on him.</p><p>The mystery guy smiles knowingly and Tom can’t tell if he wants to cry in happiness or yell in anger.</p><p>“Soon. Very soon. Everyday I feel myself getting stronger and stronger. Do you ever feel me? The tingling in your fingers? The heat on your chest? The voice and feeling you call <em> the something </em>?”</p><p>Tom doesn’t know when he looked away, but his gaze snapped back to the bright green eyes in awe. “That’s <em> you </em>?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I feel you...more and more each day. I remember when there was quiet days in between <em> the somethings </em> reactions, but now it’s like you’re there with me constantly.”</p><p>“Tom,” the guy goes to crouch in front of Tom, and he grasps his small hands in his own tightly. “Every day I’m gaining my strength back little by little, and soon, I will be able to speak to you, and I’ll tell you everything.”</p><p>It took a long time for Tom to reply. He didn’t know what to believe. Everything that was happening was all a little overwhelming, and the guy was holding his <em> hand </em> . He didn’t cringe at Tom’s cold skin and he didn’t flinch away from him. This whole time <em> he </em> initiated all physical contact with <em> Tom </em>. He knows it’s stupid to base his decision on that alone, but, it was really nice and Tom didn’t want it to stop. If he had to sacrifice a little to get this comfort then he’d do it.</p><p>He wasn’t going to make it easy though. He gave his best glare, the one that made the caretakers shiver and little Ann cry. “You swear it?”</p><p>“I promise Tom.”</p><p>Tom pulled his hand away and crossed his arms across his chest. His brows furrowed further. “No! Swear it!”</p><p>He could see amusement in the green eyes of the mystery guy and Tom couldn’t help but bristle a bit. His hurt pride soothed a bit when the guy stood up and wrapped strong arms around Tom’s small frame.</p><p>“I swear it Tom.” The guy whispered, and Tom believed him.</p>
<hr/><p>When Tom awoke the next morning, he wasn’t surprised to find that he didn’t remember his dream at all. But what did surprise him was how warm he felt for many days after.</p><p>He had many more dreams after that night, and each morning he had little to no memory of what he dreamed about. The strangest part wasn’t the fact he didn’t remember them, but what was strange was the overlapping feelings left after each one.</p><p>One time he woke up with the feel of grass underneath his fingertips. Another time he kept shivering as if winter itself was nipping at his skin. The most bizarre feeling was the rushing feeling of flying and endless freedom. The best feeling had to be when he woke up feeling powerful, like deep in his bones he knew he was stronger, faster, and simply <em> more </em>than anyone else in the world.  </p><p>But the feeling that was constant and unchanging was the encasing warmth that followed him around for days.</p>
<hr/><p>Slowly, slowly, so painstakingly slowly, <em>the</em> <em>something </em>became a <em>person</em>.</p><p>Not flesh and bone and a child like Tom- that would be too easy and too perfect. But Tom wasn’t going to selfishly demand more when he’s already been given so much. <em> The something </em> that was simply a feeling under his skin and was barely a whisper in his mind became <em> more </em>. It had a voice and thought and feelings separated from Tom’s own. Or maybe it had always had its own thoughts and Tom had simply thought of them as his own?</p><p>Regardless, <em> the something </em>slowly became fully aware.</p><p>It was not constantly sentient, and it’s thoughts were scattered and more feeling then full words, but sometimes Tom would hear a full thought or it would speak directly to him. At most it was like words whispered in the wind that Tom had to concentrate hard to catch. But everyday, it would speak and feel more and more, until it finally was present with Tom constantly.</p><p>Before this new stage, Tom could only describe <em> the something </em> as always sleeping. It slept with him, present but not aware, every day since he could possibly remember- and he has an amazing memory. He could remember things clearly since he was two. <em> The something </em> was always there right under his skin, but it only became aware maybe once or twice a month, enough to send emotions and tingles in his skin, only for it to settle back in slumber until the next time. But it was always there, he could always feel it.</p><p>But now it was more, and sometimes it would speak to him, and Tom kept every instance close to his heart.</p><p>He prayed and wished and hoped that one day the voice would become more and more until he could feel actual skin on his own.</p>
<hr/><p>Summer was in full swing but Tom still found himself outside the orphanage making his way towards the park. Just moments before he had watched the Matron convince another couple to consider a different child to adopt- any child who wasn’t Tom. They had fawned over simple Billy Stubbs but Tom knew they didn’t come for him. They came with specific ideas and a checklist of what child they wanted. Young, polite, and intelligent.</p><p>He had heard them discussing this with the Matron and he made sure to make himself as presentable as possible. They were rich and really that’s all Tom cared about. The wife had instantly pointed him out and <em> -smile- - it’s your best feature- -mums love it- </em> he smiled. She instantly had pat at his hair and asked questions and even her husband seemed intrigued with him. He knew without having to <em> look </em> that these two would take him home. The children all sneered behind the couples back but Tom was still so incredibly happy and <em> -proud- -of course they’d want you- -you’re amazing- -so happy </em>- didn’t pay the stupid kids any mind..</p><p>But that all went downhill when he caught sight of Mrs. Cole’s look of contempt. His stomach filled with dread and <em> -anger- -how dare she- -why- </em> he watched her pull the couple away to speak to them in the privacy of her office. When they came back out they never even glanced at him, deciding to simply pretend he hadn’t existed. Tom felt numb and empty and so stupid for even <em> hoping </em> . He glanced once at Billy’s ugly toothy smile <em> -ugly child- -they won’t take him- -he’s stupid- -git- </em> before deciding to leave. It was clear the Matron ruined his chances of getting adopted again and he feared the kind of actions he’d resort to in his anger if he stayed inside.</p><p>He grabbed a couple rocks off the grassy floor and threw them in anger. The numbness that had racked his body earlier was replaced with rage, the kind that made his body shake. His mind tried to reason with his rage, but he couldn’t listen to the reasonable voice in his head. He was too upset to listen to reason because how much was there to reason the fact that the Matron ruined his chances of a decent life <em> again </em> ? Was he hated and thought of so little that he deserved this? <em> -NO- -no- -NO- </em></p><p>Voices laughing close behind him made him spin around and he clutched the last rock tightly in his fist. Billy and his three friends came into view and Tom fought hard to keep his scowl off his face.<em> -run- -don’t engage- fear- </em> What did they have to fear from stupid ugly Billy?</p><p>“Stupid creepy Tommy doesn’t get a family.”</p><p>Tom scowled at the stupid boy. “You don’t either stupid. If you did you’d be leaving with them.”</p><p>Tom pointed out into the distance and the boys followed his gaze. The rich family from earlier was escorted back to their car with no orphan trailing after them.<em> -ha!- -I told you- -stupid ugly git- </em> The older boys gave Billy a slightly pitying look but Tom could see the true emotions underneath the fake pity. The orphans might all like to pretend to be friends, but each one of them hated the lucky kids who won the affections of the adopters. Billy turned back to Tom with his fists balled and his face becoming a blotchy red. The other boys also turned their attention back on Tom.</p><p>Billy was as old as Tom, but two of the three boys with him, Eliot and George, were two years older and the youngest was little Pop, actual name Paul, who barely turned six a month ago. George had a stupid smile that matched Billy’s and Tom fought hard to keep a shiver down. Anxiety bubbled across his shoulders and Tom tried to quiet down <em> the something’s </em>emotions. What did it have to fear? Billy and his friends were stupid kids who knew better than to hurt him. The  something in his mind didn’t reply to his direct questions, but Tom could feel something building up under his skin. His limbs felt tight, like they do when he’s about to run.</p><p>His waring emotions, his own and with the something in his head, distracted him a lot more than he realized and he suddenly found himself on the floor, a pained grunt leaving his lips as the pain in his abdomen finally registered. <em> -up uP UP- -I’m so sorry- -RUN- </em> But he couldn’t, as his arms were pinned to the grassy floor by George and Eliot. He tried to struggle, he did, but soon kicks started to fall on his chest and stomach and Tom couldn’t find his voice to cry out. Pain was all consuming and Tom wasn’t half aware of what he was doing. He couldn’t hear his voice screaming, he couldn’t hear his pleas to stop, he couldn’t feel his body struggling with his little strength to get out of the boys’ hold. Panic settled in his bones, and below his skin and in the distance he could hear <em> the something </em> trying to speak to him.</p><p>He wanted it stop, he wanted them to stop, to leave him alone, to get them away. Far far away from him. A foot crashed into his face and suddenly all there was was hate and pain and heat.</p><p>Heat that tingled under his skin that didn’t go unnoticed as the pain continued from his attackers until it expanded out of him, escaping from every pore on his body, and unleashed on all the kids around him. The force of that power pushed the children away like a strong gust of wind and Paul found himself thrown a lot farther than the other boys. They all landed on the grassy floor with pained grunts and Billy felt something snap when he went down.</p><p>Eliot was the first to get up, and though he was scared and weary, he was so angry. How dare that little freak try to hurt them? They were older, stronger, and now Tom’s freakishness touched all of them. He stood up, ignored his shaking limbs and ran toward Tom’s still form. He got close, raised his leg, a yell on his lips, only for that same force of sheer energy to expand and release from Tom- pushing and flinging Eliot back into the air.</p><p>Eliot crashed back onto the ground and finally allowed himself to cry. George ran to Eliot and helped them to stand. He grunted a bit but easily went up, even as his limbs still couldn’t stop shaking and the tears wouldn’t stop streaming. Paul had crawled over to Billy and the two older boys finally realized that he was holding his arm close to his body and crying ugly tears. George barely gave Tom Riddle’s unconscious body a glance. He hoped the little freak died!</p><p>The older boys went to the younger ones and helped Billy up. George limped a bit but he pushed through it, instead worrying about dumb Billy. He hated Tom as much as everyone else in the orphanage, but he knew they shouldn’t have messed with him. And now Billy was hurt and Paul looked close to freaking out. The four boys limped back to the orphanage where the Matron took one look at Billy’s face and twisted arm and took him straight to the local doctor.</p>
<hr/><p>‘It hurts!’ Tom screamed, but his mouth did not open. His eyes could barely stay open, but even so, all he can see is darkness. He cannot see the trees from the park, or the blue of the sky. He can not see the cruel kids who hurt him so much. Only darkness, and he can feel the panic overwhelming the pain of his broken body.  </p><p><em> I know Tom, I know. I’m so sorry. </em>It was a voice he heard before, once before, in a dream perhaps. But it fills him with such hope that Tom couldn’t stop himself from crying out for that voice. ‘Why did they have to hurt me? I didn’t do anything to them!’</p><p>
  <em> I don’t know Tom. Muggles simply hate what they can’t understand. </em>
</p><p>‘I don’t…’ Tom wasn’t aware enough to ask the voice about his odd word. The pain was rushing through his body like the waves of a strong tide. He couldn’t tell if his heart was beating too quickly or too slowly now.</p><p>
  <em> I will explain in time I promise. But you need to listen carefully. </em>
</p><p>‘Please help me. It hurts so much. I, I cant breathe! Help me!’ Pain and hope raged war in his darkness but suddenly- a hand, strong and warm and burning. It pressed against his chest and he felt like he could breathe again.</p><p>
  <em> Shh Tom shh, I will take care of you. </em>
</p><p>Yes, yes, Tom believed it could. Whatever the hand had done made him able to breathe again and he trusted it to help him further. ‘Please help please. It hurts so much.’</p><p>
  <em> I need your full consent Tom. I need you to give me full control. </em>
</p><p>‘Anything! Anything please! I don’t- I don’t- I don’t want to die!’ Tom didn’t know what else he could possibly say. Though he could breathe his body still hurt and the pain was winning now. Everywhere hurt and he felt he was coming so close to his end. He...he was so scared, terrified, and Tom could feel hot tears trailing down his bruised face.</p><p>
  <em> I’ve got you now Tom. You’ll be alright soon. I’m here Tom. Just rest now, I will take care of everything. Sleep Tom. I’ve got you. </em>
</p><p>The darkness consumed him and he willingly gave himself to the press of warm limbs encasing his own.</p>
