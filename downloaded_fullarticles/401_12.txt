    <p>Filch bit back a snarl, as he paced the corridor. The school's discipline problem had been bad enough before, with Dumbledore being too <em> soft </em> on the brats for their own good. And then nearly two weeks ago, on Halloween night, <em> someone </em> had petrified Ms. Norris, leaving a threatening message to the muggleborn students for good measure. The Potter boy and his friends had been at the scene of the crime, but Dumbledore had refused to punish them, even when they were <em> clearly </em> to blame. And now a student had been petrified...</p><p>"Something needs to be done…" Filch growled, as he turned and walked the other direction. He felt empty, without the cat at his heels, like part of his soul was missing. "There needs to be <em> discipline, </em> and someone with the power to enforce it."</p><p>He'd tried, of course, but threats of detentions and hanging up by the ears were met with hidden snickers and rolled eyes. Despite his best efforts, he was still a Squib, and as a mere caretaker, he often found his authority subverted by teachers who were either too soft or too biased for their student's own good.</p><p>Filch turned back around. "What I need is a way to lay down the law, and make sure it <em> sticks </em>."</p><p>There was a slight rumble, and a door appeared in the wall, next to a tapestry of dancing trolls. Filch's eyes opened in surprise, then narrowed again. "What the hell…?" Doors were known to come and go in Hogwarts, of course, as passages formed and disappeared, rooms moved, and the castle in general spat in the face of common sense in a way uncommon even for the most arcane of magic. However, in his years as caretaker he'd grown used to the castle and its quirks, enough that he could usually predict the movements. This room, however, was unfamiliar. His eyes still narrowed, he pushed open the door and stepped inside. </p><p>Or rather, outside. Filch stepped onto a stony cliff side, twilit sky marked with unfamiliar stars. Standing at the edge of the cliff, facing away and arms folded behind his back, stood a dark-skinned man in a black and silver uniform. As Filch entered, the man turned to look at him, revealing a pale crescent-shaped mark on his cheek. </p><p>"Argus Filch. I've been waiting to speak with you."</p><p>“What the bloody hell…?” Filch looked past the man, catching sight of the moon- except the moon wasn’t normally that small and purple, right? Or having a second, blue counterpart starting to poke its way over the horizon. </p><p>The man held up a strange device, made of gold and several glowing gemstones. “Justice is a universal ideal, Argus Filch. The divide between us can not divide the true nature of it, and I have been watching. <em> They </em> have been watching.” Around the man, black lines seemed to form and open up, revealing starry backdrops before disappearing. </p><p>“I have no idea what the <em> hell </em> you’re talking about. All I know, you’re breaking into <em> my </em> school and we can’t have that, can’t we?” Filch growled, doing his best to look intimidating, but the man’s face never changed, nor the monotonous tone of his voice. </p><p>“I have not entered your school. I did facilitate a connection, but you were the one who initiated it. As I said, I have been watching, and waiting for you to meet with me. After all, I could hardly come and meet you without invitation, not without breaking in and defying your laws.” The man put his device down, and approached. “If you are serious about the need for law and justice in your school, then I can help you.”</p><p>Filch narrowed his eyes, but he had to admit, his interest was piqued. “How?</p><p>"Under normal circumstances, I would take you under my direct tutelage as a disciple, to follow and learn until you were ready to say the Words. However, given your normal… location," The man glanced behind Filch, who turned and saw the doorway back to Hogwarts, apparently opening out of a nearby boulder. "I can make an exception, provided I am given regular updates. As I understand it, the connection should open once every 16 days. I will make sure to be here, as shall you." </p><p>Filch glanced at the door again. <em> It opened as I was passing it… because of what I was saying, about a need for order? </em> He filed the thought away for later.</p><p>The man glanced towards his side, at one of the black slits in the air. “This is an atypical situation for us all. Normally, I seek out those suitable for recruitment. However, the Highspren have determined you worthy. And given that you were out of my normal reach, it was only with their help that I could bring you here.” He turned back to Filch. “Speak the word, and I will sever the connection, and we shall never see each other again. But if you truly value the law and wish to see it upheld in your world-”</p><p>“I do.” Filch nodded, glancing at the black slits. One opened wider at his gaze, showing flickering stars as it seemed to approach. It seemed to examine him for a moment, before shutting. </p><p>The man nodded, as the slit reopened next to him. “This will be more atypical than I assumed, it seems. The Highspren have already decided to bond with you. Normally, there would be a vetting process, of course. However…” He stuck his hand to the side, and with a puff of mist a sword appeared in his hand. He stabbed it in the ground between himself and Filch, and gestured him to step forward. “I can improvise as necessary. Place your hands on the hilt, and speak the Immortal Words, if you can.”</p><p>Flich put his hands on the sword, but narrowed his eyes again. “What words?”</p><p><b> <em>THESE WORDS</em> </b>.</p><p>Filch frowned, eyes going wide as nine words dropped into his head. He didn’t know where they came from, or where the voice had come from, but he knew what he had to say. </p><p>“Life before death. strength before weakness. journey before destination.”</p><p>
  <b> <em>THESE WORDS, ARE ACCEPTED.</em> </b>
</p><p>Filch breathed in, feeling somehow stronger from just saying those words. The other man smiled- it wasn’t much of one, obviously the smile of a man who rarely did so and may have forgotten how, but an honest one at least. He pulled out a glowing sphere from a pouch at his waist, and held it up to Filch. “Breath.”</p><p>Flich breathed again, and the light from the sphere darkened, as it traveled like mist into his nose and mouth. Raw power flooded his body, like a raging tempest. He felt strong, quick, like he could punch out a Nundu and escape before he was infected, if one somehow appeared. He looked up at the man, as several of the little black lines opened up to stare at him. “What…”</p><p>“Hold it in. You will not need air so long as you have Stormlight, all the better since you risk breathing it out.” The man lifted his sword back up, and it disappeared in a puff of mist. “Unfortunately, to my knowledge there is no Stormlight in your land, or any similar enough form of Investiture for you to use. I will provide you with some during our meetings, of course, though I advise you perhaps do some research into alternatives when you are not studying.” The man pulled from seemingly nowhere a stack of papers, bound by a gold clip with a blue gem on it. “I believe that in your land, men are permitted to read?”</p><p>“What? Of course, they are, why wouldn’t they be?”</p><p>The man said nothing, his face having long resumed its normal stoicism after his attempt at a smile. He instead handed Filch a small sack filled with more glowing spheres, to go with his papers. </p><p>Filch glanced through the stack, noting as he did so that they were in an unfamiliar script. “How am I supposed to read this?”</p><p>“The clip will translate into the language of your land, while you are there. Outside of it, it will translate to the local language wherever you are.” One of the black slits opened and shut, prompting a look from the man. “I do not know the exact details of how it works, just be warned when next we visit, you won’t be able to consult your homework.”</p><p>Filch nodded, and glanced back at the papers, leafing through them. “Yeah, I suppose.”</p><p>“Very well. Make good use of your Stormlight, and study carefully. I will be interested in seeing your unique perspective on things when next we speak. It isn’t often, after all, that a Worldhopper joins the order.”</p><p>The second blue moon had cleared the horizon by now, and the man turned away. “Return to your land, now. I will see you in 16 days, Argus Filch.”</p><p>Filch slid the pouch of spheres into a pocket, and looked back at the man, eyes narrowing. “How do I know you’ll be here? Assuming I can even get back. I don’t even know your name.”</p><p>The man didn’t turn around. “The Highspren who bonded with you will accompany you. I’m sure they will be willing to help, given how eager they were to have me seek you out.” The man paused, before glancing back towards Filch. “And I have many names. You may call me Nale.”</p><p>And with that, the man stepped off the cliff. Filch started to shout, only to stare as the man flew off into the distance, with no obvious way of doing so- no wings, no broomstick, nothing. After a moment, he closed his mouth, and glanced towards the door in the boulder. With a shrug, he walked back into Hogwarts, closing the door behind him as he did so. </p><p>It took him a moment to regain his bearings- for some reason, he felt heavier in Hogwarts than he did in that other world- or was he just tired? Had he just imagined the encounter?</p><p>Filch glanced down at his stack of papers. The gem clip glowed for a second, and before his eyes, the text changed to English letters. Out of the corner of his eye, a black slit opened up in the air next to him, revealing a field of stars, before closing and disappearing again. </p><p>“Well well well…” mumbled Filch to himself.<br/>
Mrs. Norris was petrified, yes. There was a vandal running around the school, scaring muggleborns, yes. And Harry Potter had stumbled on his biggest secret- or at least, what <em> had </em> been his biggest secret. But as Argus Filch began paging through his now translated “Homework”, he began to smile. Things were about to change.</p>
