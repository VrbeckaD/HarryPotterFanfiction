    <p>This couldn’t be right. Newt looked once again at the piece of paper in his hand, where a straight-forward New York address was put down in scrawly handwriting. Doubtful, his gaze flitted upward again to the row of glittering lights before him, proudly proclaiming the establishment’s name: <em>Varieté Noir</em>.</p>
<p>This was where his contact wanted him to go? A cabaret. Or at least a place of entertainment of sorts. Going by the posters and advertisements visible outside, possibly even a freak show. He grimaced at the thought. A couple brushed past him as he stood there debating whether to go in or not. For a few seconds the door opened to let some deep notes drift out from from the depths behind.</p>
<p>Newt sighed. He didn’t particularly enjoy loud places. Crowded with people, most likely dancing, laughing, drinking… It just wasn’t for him. But this was the only place where his informant could be found, according to his other sources. And he needed to talk to the man to finally move forward.</p>
<p>He squared his shoulders, took a deep breath, and stepped forward into battle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It wasn’t as bad as he had initially thought. A woman behind a counter greeted him friendly, took his overcoat and an entry fee before sending him on his way down the stairs and into the actual place of business. It wasn’t crowded down there, just as it wasn’t overly loud, and there seemed to be no dancing, either. The room and balconies were filled with wide circles of tables, facing a quite small stage and separated by partitions for privacy.</p>
<p>A rather strange thing of a night club, this was. But he wasn’t here for entertainment anyway, was he?</p>
<p>Newt found a table in the back corner of the lower floor, out of the way but still with a nice view of the stage should there be any interesting acts tonight. He ordered a drink (the alcohol here wasn’t even hidden but on their menus!), then inquired after the name he had been given, receiving nothing but a curt nod from the waiter as he left.</p>
<p>Soon enough, a man slid into the seat next to him. Tall, broad and muscled. Exactly what he had expected. “You been asking ‘bout me, I’m told.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Skender?”</p>
<p>The man gave a nod.</p>
<p>“Right. I’m looking for information.”</p>
<p>Skender narrow his eyes at this. “You police?”</p>
<p>“No, merely an interested party. You’ve been working with a certain group of people, I understand. Illicit night-time shipments at the harbour.”</p>
<p>“That kind o’ gossip’s gonna cost you.”</p>
<p>Newt nodded, taking a small envelope from inside of his jacket. “There’s 10 Dollar in here.”</p>
<p>A laugh. “I’m gonna need more than that to rat on those people, man!”</p>
<p>Fully having expected that answer, he rummaged through his jacket once more and showed the man another envelope. “An additional 15. Yours, after you tell me what I need to know.”</p>
<p>The man licked his lips, then nodded and reached for the first envelope to count the bills inside. “Yeah, that’ll do, I guess. What d’you wanna know?”</p>
<p>“Names, places. Anything you can tell me about their next operations.”</p>
<p>The man rolled his eyes, then turned around and flagged down the waiter. “I’m gonna need to wet my lips for all that.”</p>
<p>In the end it took Newt less than ten minutes to get all the information he needed, most of it matching with what he already knew from other sources or had suspected himself.</p>
<p>“But I don’t know nothin’ ‘bout any next operations. I get a call when they need an extra hand, that’s that.”</p>
<p>“I see. Any calls lately?”</p>
<p>A shrug. “Just the one I just told you ‘bout, man. Nothin’ since.”</p>
<p>“Anything you might have picked up that night?”</p>
<p>The man pondered his question for a moment. “There was talk about some big cash coming their way, soon. But that’s all I heard.”</p>
<p>Newt nodded and finally handed him the promised compensation. “For your helpfulness, Mr. Skender.”</p>
<p>The man quickly grasped the money and counted it out, before flashing him a smile. “Glad doin‘ business with you.“</p>
<p>And then he was gone again. For such a big guy, he had impressive skills of stealth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Newt sat in the half-dark, nursing a second glass of highly illegal whiskey as he mulled over this new information. Soon his eyes were drawn to the stage, though, where a lithe acrobat demonstrated the most impossible contortions of the body. <em>Snake-man</em>, he called himself: half man, half reptile. A scientific impossibility, Newt knew, but it was a better sale of his art than <em>man with years of training</em>.</p>
<p>The act was followed by very talented singer, who commandeered the stage to the sound of an invisible orchestra. He knew the tune of the song, but couldn’t decipher the language it was sung in.</p>
<p>“Cigarettes, sir?“</p>
<p>The voice pulled him from his trance and he blinked at the woman in front of him in confusion before her words registered with him. She carried a tray in front of her, secured by a strap around her neck, displaying different wares and goods. Most of them tobacco, some chocolates and mints… things the guests here might like to purchase throughout the night.</p>
<p>“Uhm. No, thank you.“</p>
<p>She cocked her head, the little black hat on top tipping sideways with it. “You must be new to the <em>Varieté</em>. None of the regulars are actually watching the show anymore. Enjoying it?“</p>
<p>Newt nodded, suddenly feeling the need to avoid any eye contact with her. He was no good with small talk, especially where women were concerned… let alone in a night club such as this. His gaze dropped down to the tray again, where her delicate hands held on to the worn edges of black-painted wood and gold-coloured tassels.</p>
<p>“Maybe some chocolates? They’re not even half-way through the program, you know.”</p>
<p>She shifted her stance, inadvertently offering him a glance at her stockinged legs instead… visible all the way up to her knees. Newt swallowed as his mouth suddenly went dry, ripping his eyes away from the enticing sight.</p>
<p>“N-no, thank you.”</p>
<p>“Well, I had to try.” She shrugged and chuckled. “You’re not much of a chatty person, are you?”</p>
<p>He gave her a wry smile, or tried to at least. It might have come out as more of a grimace than intended. No, he was certainly <em>not</em> made for this kind of situation.</p>
<p>“Well, if you change your mind, let me know. I’ll be around for most of the night.” She gave him a smile. “Enjoy your evening, sir.“</p>
<p>And with that, she moved on to the next table.</p>
<p>Newt hastily downed the rest of his drink, wetting his parched throat to unstick his tongue from the roof of his mouth. If only he had left earlier, he could have avoided this situation entirely… would not have made such a fool of himself just now. But, oh well. Better late than never.</p>
<p>Five minutes after, Newt Scamander had settled his bill, retrieved his coat and made his way back out into the cool air of the November night. He still had plans to make.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Newt sighed. Here he was again, inside the <em>Varieté Noir</em> with all its red and gold pomp hidden in half-light. Back for more information.</p>
<p>Despite his best attempts, those smugglers had slipped through his fingers before he could even try to liberate their living “goods”. Too quick and organized had their operation been, too professional. His next attempt would hopefully be backed up by the police, but for that he needed more on Grimmson’s current whereabouts and plans.</p>
<p>He took the same table as during his previous visit, nursing his drink while waiting for Skender to finally make an appearance. The waiter had been as curt as last time, taking his inquiry with a nod before vanishing from sight. That had been half a lifetime ago, though.</p>
<p>“Cigarettes, sir?“ The voice pulled him from his thoughts. The same woman as last time, smiling as she offered him her treats on a tray to choose from.</p>
<p>Nervously, he scanned the room behind her, hoping to find a glimpse of the man he’d been waiting for… but no such luck. Even though it was the same choice as the last time he’d been here, he let his gaze drift and hover over the tobacco and chocolates again, just to bide his time.</p>
<p>“No, thank you,“ he finally managed, barely in time to avoid any more awkwardness through his silence.</p>
<p>A hum of amusement. “And here I was, thinking after a whole month away you’d come to change your mind.”</p>
<p>He sharply looked up at her in surprise. She had recognized him? How?</p>
<p>“You’re British,” she chuckled, answering the question he hadn’t even asked yet. “We don’t get too many of those in here. ‘Specially not on their own.”</p>
<p>She leaned a little closer, adding in a mock whisper. “Your kind usually travels in little flocks, did you know?”</p>
<p>Newt couldn’t help but grimace at her keen observation. Little flocks, yes, she got that right. And any outing under three people was usually considered a pity party.</p>
<p>“I’m not like the others,” he acknowledged. “More of a… a solitary animal.” Risking a short glance at her after the admission, he found it had earned him a smile. An actual, honest smile, by the looks of it.</p>
<p>“Well, then. I’ll be around should you need anything after all. Enjoy your evening, sir.”</p>
<p>He watched her work her way around the room after that, offering her wares at every table and chatting amicably with those patrons buying from her. Even in the half-dark of the room, she was unmistakable among the people, in her red dress and the little black hat. It matched the décor of the whole establishment, he only noticed now. Red and gold, with a touch of black. He felt his mouth go dry again and took a sip from his drink.</p>
<p>There was another woman working the upper levels of the floor, blonde and rather more coquettish than this one. The sight made him glad not to have chosen a table up there on his first visit. He could deal with words and smiles, but a stranger putting her hand on him was a different thing entirely. By now the singer had vanished from stage again, making way for a pair of mimes. Where was Skender?</p>
<p>The next time he found the cigarette girl glancing in his direction, Newt finally worked up the courage and gestured for her to come over. She approached the table with a satisfied grin.</p>
<p>“Changed you mind then, have you. What can I do for you, sir?”</p>
<p>He shook his head and cleared his throat. “Uhm. Would you happen to know when Mr. Skender is available to see me?”</p>
<p>She frowned. “Skender hasn’t been in today. You’ve been waiting on him all night?”</p>
<p>He nodded and sighed in annoyance. “That waiter probably forgot to tell me.”</p>
<p>“Who, Johnny?” She nodded over to the liveried man two tables over. “Yeah, I can imagine. Anything to keep a table occupied.”</p>
<p>He reached for his glass, ready to finish the drink and finally call it a night. He needed to be at the Zoological Society early tomorrow morning. “Just have to try my luck tomorrow, then.”</p>
<p>“Monday is our day off, sir. You should come back on Tuesday.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Thank you for letting me know, miss.” He nodded at her in thanks.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome.” She gave him another smile and turned to leave, finally responding to the calls from a neighbouring table.</p>
<p>Newt knocked back the rest of his drink and got up to settle his bill. This time there would be no tip for the waiter, though.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>He was back at his table two nights later, just as the show was about to begin. This time he didn’t need to wait for a waiter to inquire after the man he was looking for, though. Skender slid in next to him mere moments after he had sat down himself.</p>
<p>“What d’you want now?” he asked gruffly. The man looked a little worse for wear today, with some distinctive scratches on on his cheek and the back of his hands. (Up his arms, too, Newt suspected.) Claw marks.</p>
<p>“You got a call, I assume.” Newt nodded at his face. Those would definitely scar, by the look of it.</p>
<p>Skender shrugged. “What about it?”</p>
<p>“Anything you picked up while handling those… goods?” He patted his jacket pocket.</p>
<p>“Besides the scratches, you mean.”</p>
<p>Newt nodded. “I’m sure they pay you well, but given the danger that seems to come with the jobs… is it good enough?”</p>
<p>Skender looked away for a moment, clearly thinking about the offer. “Who are you?”</p>
<p>“I told you, an interested party.”</p>
<p>“Scratch that shit, man. Who are you really?”</p>
<p>Newt nearly flinched as Skender raised his voice, but only nearly. “I’m working for the New York Zoological Society. There’s some concern about… exotic animals getting into the wrong hands.” His own concern, mostly. But Skender didn’t need to know that.</p>
<p>“What, you gonna try and stop Grimmson doin’ business?”</p>
<p>Newt nodded. “Hopefully. The animal trade, at least. He can ship in all the booze he wants, if you ask me.”</p>
<p>This time they spent a lot longer than ten minutes together, going over the details for Grimmson’s next shipment of exotic animals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Cigarettes, sir?”</p>
<p>A smile flitted over his face at the sound of her voice. “Thank you, no.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes, still refusing to to leave for better customers. “Got what you needed from Skender?”</p>
<p>Newt took a sip from his drink, his fourth one tonight, and nodded. The alcohol, and his success, made him feel a little more chatty than usual. “Thank you for sending him over. I assume, that was you?”</p>
<p>She nodded, then suddenly eyed the glass in his hands with suspicion. “You’re not police, though, are you?”</p>
<p>Newt chuckled, shaking his head. “Oh no, I leave <em>that</em> to my brother, miss.”</p>
<p>He glanced at her, still not all too comfortable with eye contact yet, and found her rather alarmed. He clarified. “He’s with Scotland Yard, in London. Your workplace quite safe from him.”</p>
<p>That made her chuckle and relax again. “In that case, you're welcome.”</p>
<p>Newt watched her busy herself, rearranging some of the cigars and cigarettes on her tray. He noticed her delicate hands, nimbly flitting over the wares on the heavy tray. It couldn’t be easy, lugging that thing around all night.</p>
<p>“Well, then.” He looked up just in time to find her smiling. “Enjoy your evening, sir.”</p>
<p>He watched her go back to work, again. The contortionist was back on stage, winding himself around hoops and causing a few of the people at a nearby table to gasp. But it turned out that the dark-haired cigarette vendor held his attention far more than anything the people the stage did throughout the night. </p>
<p>He felt a slight sting in his chest when he saw her give that lovely smile of hers to one of the other men a few tables over. <em>Really, Scamander?</em> he chastised himself. <em>You didn’t think you were the only one she had a smile for here, did you? You, of all people!</em> (The voice in his head suddenly sounded suspiciously like his brother.)</p>
<p>A puppeteer had entered the stage by now, pulling the strings behind a story only few people here were actually aware of. Most of the other guests were busy with each other, talking, drinking, laughing all over the little booths and secluded tables the <em>Varieté Noir</em> offered. Others… well, they seemed to be <em>busy</em> with each other. Couples, Newt noticed, and blushed furiously when he accidentally glimpsed where exactly the hands of one gentleman in particular had found occupation.</p>
<p>He had been right to stay away from those powders he’d been offered at the entrance and the bar. They limited all sense and inhibitions, it seemed.</p>
<p>He downed his drink and left. Hopefully for good. </p>
<p>The cigarette girl gave him one last smile as he passed her on his way out.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite his best intentions, Newt returned merely two weeks later, at the beginning of the new year. And kept coming back, even after Grimmson had finally been shut down and no more help from the informant was needed. But the <em>Varieté Noir </em>had still held his thoughts and dreams captive until he finally returned to the place itself. One unlisted attraction of the establishment did so in particular.</p>
<p>“Cigarettes, sir?“ Her voice brought a smile to his lips each and every time he heard it. It was a soft, pleasant sound he had come to associate with a friendly smile, little quips and a sort of silent companionship… just by being in the same room with her.</p>
<p>Their routine remained the same each night. He perused the goods on her tray, but declined with a smile. She voiced a remark or question. He answered with gestures or words, depending on his mood, before watching her move on to the next table.</p>
<p>And he kept an eye on her throughout the evening as she danced across the floor of the lower level, the same familiar pattern each night. Cigarettes, sir? Enjoy your evening!</p>
<p>Newt sat at his table in the back corner, nursing a glass of good whiskey and smiling to himself. Content with having gotten a few precious moments of her attention. And a smile.</p>
<p>(This was probably the most sociable he had been in months.)</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“Cigarettes, honey?”</p>
<p>Newt looked up in surprise. Today it was not the lovely brunette in front of him but the blonde he had seen work on the upper level before. The flirty, touchy one.</p>
<p>“Uhm.” He looked away again, trying not to let his disappointment show… or the discomfort that suddenly started crawling along his skin at the unwelcome change. </p>
<p>She sighed. “No, I didn’t think so." </p>
<p>He tensed as her hand came to rest on his shoulder, resisting the urge to pull away immediately. Her touch pricked his skin uncomfortably, even through all of his layers. "Don’t you worry, we‘ve only changed tables for the night. She'll be right back here tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Oh. He'd been that obvious after all, hadn’t he? He bit his lip. Of course she would have noticed that he wasn’t too happy to see her. </p>
<p>“Listen. I’m not gonna get involved in whatever your spiel here is, but… you’ll be making her life a little easier if you actually buy something from her once in a while, you know? And if it’s just a pack of mints.“</p>
<p>The hand vanished as quickly as it had come, but his tension didn’t. “Keep that in mind next time you come here to watch her, yeah? Bye, honey!”</p>
<p>With a playful grin, the blonde turned and left his table.</p>
<p>And, after gulping down his drink, so did Newt. The exchange had left him far too tense to <em>enjoy his evening</em>. </p>
