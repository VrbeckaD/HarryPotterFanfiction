          <div class="userstuff"><p>to the boy with the reckless smile</p>
<p>the smile that shines bright but doesn't reach his cool grey eyes</p>
<p>the eyes that seem like the moon</p>
<p>forever changing and cold</p>
<p> </p>
<p>but not to the boy who was scared of the moon </p>
<p>to him, those eyes were like the fluid silver of mercury</p>
<p>and for him, that reckless smile softened</p>
<p>and sometimes, it would reach the boy's eyes</p>
<p> </p>
<p>to the boy covered in scars</p>
<p>the boy whose honey tones were marred by pale marks and sadness</p>
<p>he hides behind jumpers and books</p>
<p>he hates how he looks</p>
<p> </p>
<p>but to the boy who had never been loved</p>
<p>those scars didn't phase him</p>
<p>the arms hidden by soft jumpers felt like home, more than any house ever had</p>
<p>and gradually books and sweaters stop hiding him</p></div>
