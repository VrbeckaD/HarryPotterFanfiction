  <span>~three days later~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry grinned at the group in front of her. “The three students who performed the best are Sirius Black.” The Slytherins grumbled. “Severus Snape.” Sirius shot him a glare. “And Albus Dumbledore. Two of the top three are Gryffindors, however, I didn’t think that would be fair, so I pooled the grades of all of you. The average of the Slytherins is 98%.” They preened. Harry smirked. “The average of the Gryffindors is 96%. The Slytherins win this match. </span>
  <em>
    <span>However</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she raised her voice over the grumbles, “this isn’t going to be the last competition. Starting this year, I will be grading each of you individually for the highest marks. The person who gets the highest of the year will get to keep this.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She raised her hand and showed off a small pocket watch. “It will allow you to bypass the soul summoning ceremony and simply say the name of whom you wish to speak to. For up to five hours, you may speak to several different spirits at a time with the re-charge of twelve hours.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grinned at them. “Let the games begin. Go and impress me. I’ll be grading you all on how quickly you learn. No more pairing. From now on, you are learning one on one with me. If you learn and master a skill, then I’ll teach you the next skill. The one who learns the most by the end of this year will get this little prize.” Her eyes glittered. “May the best Necromancer learner win.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape was practically salivating over it. Albus’ eyes were gleaming. So were Aberforth’s. Blaise frowned and then pointed to Black. “What about him?! He’s living with you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Smirking, Sirius shrugged. “Guess the watch is mine then.” His smile turned sharp. “What’s the matter? You scared a lion will beat you, snakeling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus hummed and then smiled at Harriet. He knew he would win. His only true rival would be Severus. The man in question looked at him with a dark smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise was worried. He looked at his mother. She nodded slowly and then waited until everyone was gone before approaching Harry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, all these competitions and pushing, is there a reason for it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. You see you and your son aren’t as pressed to learn Necromancy as the others are. Well, Sirius wants to learn it because he thinks it’s cool, but Severus is my guard at school against Grindelwald. Albus wants to learn it for obvious reasons, and Aberforth wants to help his brother.” Harry sighed. “There is a war coming, Blaise, Karina. A war that will sweep the world. If we are to win it, then we must master Death Magic. I can teach you both at a more sedate pace if you want, but the others can’t afford to waste time.” Harry looked at them. Blaise straightened. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom told me to take care of you. If learning Necromancy means I can do that, then I’ll master it faster than my own housemaster.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Karina smiled at Harry darkly. “I must protect myself and my son against Gellert Grindelwald. I will learn as much as I can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nodding, Harry smiled at them and then gave them a hug each. They left soon after.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sighed and looked over at Sirius. “You’re just about done with Energy Manipulation. All of you are.” He hummed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to jump straight to Soul Magic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can’t do that until you understand everything else. It’s the reason that Soul Magic is the hardest to master.” Harry frowned and looked out at the garden. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Soul Occlumency, Energy Manipulation…animation is supposed to be next, but I have to head straight for fighting, so I’m going to teach Shadow Manipulation instead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius listened carefully and then sighed. “Harry, you take too much onto yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can’t help it. It’s the life I was given.” She gave him a wry smile. “Sorry if the stress is catching.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snorted and shook his head. “No biggie. I’ll just go and bug Remus.” He paused and then looked at her again. “And don’t forget, we’re traveling to France to see the wineries that the Potters own. Also, I’m going to show you the estates we, the Blacks own, near the sea. It’s around Dover some, but mostly in Scotland. We also need to get your rings…” He frowned in thought. “It’ll take more than a week to fit all this in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry raised an eyebrow. “What rings?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Giving her a sharp look, Sirius groaned and shook his head. “Why did I assume you’d know? All families, great or small, wealthy or poor, have a ring worn by the eldest and heir of the estate, even if there isn’t anything to inherit from that estate. It’s just for show and pride of family mostly. Anyway, Dumbledore told me that you are his heir. That makes one ring from the Dumbledore Family. Snape said you’re his heir since he won’t have any kids and wants nothing to do with the Prince Family. That makes two rings. You are the heir of the Peverell Family, a direct descendant. That makes three rings. You are the heir of the Potter Family. That makes four rings. And, you’re also the heir of the Black Family. That makes five rings.” He frowned over at Remus. “Did I miss anything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not that I can tell.” Remus smiled at a shell shocked Harry.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~weeks pass by~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus jerked awake and stared at the ceiling. He rubbed his chest and then dressed quickly. Slipping past Aberforth’s room, he moved outside and apparated to Numengard Tower. When he pushed his way into the cell, he studied Gellert. The man was still strung up. His magical signature was suppressed. Reaching around, Albus felt the mark and brought his fingers back, wet with blood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without a word, he left. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His dream must have been nothing after all.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~days later~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry grinned as her godfather and uncle as they made their way to their tent. The Weasleys were also going to the final cup match. They were somewhere on the inner ring of tents. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“HARRY!” Turning, Harry grinned and waved at Tom and then rushed over to give him and Ron and Ginny hugs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She noticed how close Ginny and Tom seemed to be. They were even sharing a tent together so Ron could share with the twins and the parents could be together as well. It was…disconcerting.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“</span>
  </em>
  <span>Jealous?” She ignored a smug Death standing behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Of course not, who Tom wishes to spend time with is none of my concern. I only hope he does me the same courtesy’.</span>
  </em>
  <span> She sniffed and then noticed how the twins were serving Sirius and Remus hand and foot. She couldn’t help but laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The game was soon to begin the very next morning, so they all pitched their tents and went to sleep early. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they got to their box, they saw how high up the Weasleys were and smirked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom noticed that Draco had somehow managed to sit in Harry’s box. He frowned when he also noticed them sharing her Omnioculars. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jealous?” He turned and glared at Ginny. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re about to bore a hole into Draco’s head.” She smirked at him and then handed him some sweets. He rolled his eyes but accepted them anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not jealous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure.” She smirked and then gasped when Ireland scored.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom didn’t much care about Quidditch but had agreed to go since he knew Harry was going. He wanted to see her before school started. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kept having nightmares about seeing her die in the forest instead of him saving her life. Seeing her with a torn open throat. Tom clenched his hands into white-knuckled fists. Ginny soothed her own hand over his. He exhaled and nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His fits of anger were getting worse. They would have frightened him, if Ginny didn’t have the same problem. They weren’t getting their missing memories back and all the gaps were still irritating them. Ginny had to do extra tutoring to learn what she missed. Tom hadn’t needed it as much, but he had helped her with her learning so the Weasleys would have to pay a tutor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny leaned against him and exhaled. “Why don’t you just ask her out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She refuses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Straightening, Ginny frowned down at where Harry was sitting, talking animatedly to Draco about something or other. Sirius was busy glaring holes into Lucius Malfoy’s brain. Narcissa, thankfully, wasn’t there. “Why would she reject you? You two are as close as two peas in a pod.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know.” Tom gritted his teeth and growled. “I’ve made it clear that I love her. She deflects all the time and when I did corner her, she said she didn’t love me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, maybe she doesn’t…” Ginny frowned slightly in thought. Tom turned and looked at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just that she and my brother have loads of secrets.” Ginny rested her chin on her hand. “Ron always writes when he doesn’t think anyone can see him. I tried to sneak a peek at his letters once, but he caught me. I remember being surprised that he didn’t call Mum or Dad on me.” Ginny glanced over at her brother. “Instead, he looked downright petrified. After that, he started writing in code to Harry. It’s weird. He’s also reading books on how to apparate.” She snorted. “And when Ron reads a book, you </span>
  <em>
    <span>know</span>
  </em>
  <span> something is up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How come I haven’t noticed any of this?” Tom frowned at her. Ginny shrugged. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s extra careful around you. Like extremely careful. Only mails his letters or writes them when you’re out of the house. It’s strange. If I wasn’t certain that Ron liked Hermione, then I would have said he was dating Harry.” Ginny snorted. “But Ron is besotted with Hermione.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom smirked knowingly. “Even if he doesn’t know it yet.” They snickered together. Ron shot them a suspicious look but then went back to focusing on the game. Regarding him carefully, Tom decided he would watch his roommate a little more closely after this, including in school too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom had never doubted the close friendship between Ron, Harry, and Hermione. He knew that they had a Lion Loyalty that he would never share in, but Harry was the only one who mattered to him, so that was fine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t care less about Ron or Hermione. As long as they didn’t interfere with his relationship with Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wrapping his arm around Ginny, he watched the game, murmuring a warmth spell to stop her shivering. She sighed in contentment and whispered a thanks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“By the way, when are you going to stop mooning around for Dean Thomas and actually ask him out?” Tom smirked at her spluttering.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Ginny groaned. “This year maybe. I don’t know. He’s like nearly untouchable by me!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom snickered at her misery.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~meanwhile~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A rat scurried around the stands and then faltered when it saw Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. With a squeak, it raced away and then ran smack into nothing. Sniffing, the rat’s eyes widened when it recognized the smell of Crouch. But nothing was there!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With an eep, it realized that Crouch was under an Invisibility Cloak. Why he was here watching Quidditch and not in Azkaban where he should have been (but wasn’t, and his lord had been angered by that), the rat had no idea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the game, the rat followed the scent and the shivering House Elf.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~an hour later~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked up when she heard the sound of screaming. Tom tensed and then rushed to the front flaps. Sirius pulled him back and then drew his own wand. “Probably just partying.” He didn’t sound convinced in his own words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those were screams of terror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And rightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dark cloaked men and women with masks on were chanting and throwing a family of Muggles in the air. They were chanting anti-Statute slogans and Grindelwald’s titles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then everything seemed to freeze as someone sent up a spell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the dark sky was a mark. The Mark of Grindelwald.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The chanting that had been steadily increasing shut off. And then all was pandemonium. The crowds of fleeing and panicking people surged around her, and before she knew it, Harry was swept into the woods where she was promptly lost. Death was instantly by her side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are those in cloaks of invisibility around here. Be careful and use your energy sense to see them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and exhaled slowly, casting out and sensing different lifeforms. She found several, but all the magical signatures were ones she didn’t know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death moved closer to her and held her shoulders tightly. The temperature went even colder. Harry looked around, green eyes practically luminous in the night. She drew her rosewood wand and then faltered when she realized her holly wand was missing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mother</span>
  <em>
    <span>fucker</span>
  </em>
  <span>. My holly wand’s gone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“HARRY?! HARRY WHERE ARE YOU?! HARRY!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“OVER HERE!” Harry stepped closer to a frantic Tom and Ron. They pulled her into a group hug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where have you been?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I moved to go after the twins, but then I got cut off from you and dragged into the woods by the people who were fleeing that way.” Harry looked around and then up at the sky. “I wonder who put that there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron snorted as they hurried to where his father was waiting. “Those marchers, who else?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking his head, Tom looked around warily. “Then why would they run when they saw it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron had no answer, and no chance to answer since the adults found them soon after. Harry gasped. “My wand!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, that caused a stir.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~hours later~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the adults finally let Harry go, letting her keep her wand, the Weasleys, Sirius, Remus, Harry, and Tom all went to the Burrow to settle a bit after the fright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry leaned against the farthest wall and watched as Mrs. Weasley fussed over her children, including Tom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her lips stretched into a smile when she saw how uncomfortable he was. She slipped out quietly while everyone was distracted. Looking at the night sky, Harry nodded to Ron’s approach. “Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think Ginny should know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I hate lying to her. She’d think it would be cool.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t implicate her. Already I’m risking your own freedom. If the Ministry should find out what I am via Grindelwald, then you and Hermione will immediately fall under suspicion. The only fact that Hermione is a Muggle Born and can’t access books like that saves her. You come from a family of Light Wizards. That saves you, but only by so much. I can’t risk anymore. Ginny might crack.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Mione and I wouldn’t?” Ron looked flattered and worried at the same time. Harry shook her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t because you have seen hell and </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Hermione wouldn’t because she is just too stubborn to give in.” They both shared a laugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron sighed and slumped against her. “What about Tom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione told me what you had to do last year.” Harry turned away from her friend. Ron exhaled angrily. “You didn’t do anything wrong. He’s the one who’s being an idiot for not trusting you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry flinched at the reminder. Tom </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> trusted her. But he forgot again thanks to Grindelwald. “He’s…He’s suffered too much already because of me. My connection to him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So? Look, Tom wants power, okay fine, he’s got to realize that power isn’t going to be easy. You’re actually doing him a favor by putting him through the fire.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry barked a laugh. “Nice. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.” She stared at the clouds in the sky. “Like a tarantula in bed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh come off of it! You haven’t done-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh.” Harry turned around and watched as the back door opened. She grinned at Tom and waved him over. “Hi!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I worried you had apparated off someplace without saying goodbye.” He sat down on her other side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry snorted. “And when have I ever left you behind?” Her eyes glittered with hidden meaning. Tom nearly got lost in them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Several times.” He smirked and wanted to kiss her. Ron cleared his throat and then quickly stood up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whelp, I’m hungry. Want anything?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled at him. “No thanks.” Ron nodded and hurried off. Tom stared at Harry intently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She spoke first. “What a day, eh? Yesterday feels so far away.” She looked at her hands. Tom sighed slowly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, one </span>
  <em>
    <span>would</span>
  </em>
  <span> think that </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> would be the one who has trouble with love.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She scoffed and turned away. “The thing with you, Tom, is that you learn things too quickly. You were born with the need to </span>
  <em>
    <span>learn</span>
  </em>
  <span> how to love. You learned it too fast.” She rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you were born with the desire to be alone, but no one should live like that. I can help you with anything. The two of us together, we can take this world by storm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head slowly. “Tom, I don’t want this world. I only want to live a life of peace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bullshit.” He snorted and took her chin, forcing her to look at him. “Complete and utter bullshit. You know you want this world. You want power.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That's the reason that my boggart-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Power shouldn’t always be feared, you know. It </span>
  <em>
    <span>can</span>
  </em>
  <span> be used. Take it and change it to whatever you want it to be.” He smirked. “The world is separated into two things. Those who have power and those who don't, Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Funny, I thought it would be those who are alive and those who are dead.” She shrugged slightly. “Oh well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom gritted his teeth. “You have an unhealthy fixation on death.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with avoiding death.” Harry shot him a look. He stood up and started pacing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, we’re young and full of power-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“With the potential to destroy the world. Yeah, I know.” She stood up and brushed herself off. “You swore me off Necromancy, and yet you want me to take the world by storm with you, control it and become a leader in the Wizarding World. Why?” She tilted her head at him. “You need to think this double standard through. Necromancy is not as dangerous as half of the things you have planned for this earth.” Harry looked at the house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom snarled and pulled her around firmly to face him. “Necromancy will </span>
  <em>
    <span>kill</span>
  </em>
  <span> you, Harriet. Taking over the Ministry will make us thrive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stared at him and then stepped closer. “Tom, I do not want that power.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I know it will destroy me.” She smiled at him sadly. “I can’t let myself be destroyed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked stunned as she walked back into the house.</span>
</p>
