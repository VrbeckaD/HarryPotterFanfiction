</p><p>Harry had just gone through the barrier. He was still holding the letter in his hands that had been sent to him from a man called Professor Severus Snape right before he left to go to Kings Cross Station. It had taken him a while to find the barrier. To Harry, Hagrid had been a very good guide when he had introduced him to the Wizarding World. But, he did leave out on how to get through the barrier. Luckily, the man called Snape somehow knew that Hagrid would forget and told him how to get through the barrier. </p><p>When Harry was on the platform, he started to look for the bright pink-haired girl that Professor Snape told him to look for once he got on the platform. As Harry started to look for the person that he was told to look for, a bright pink-haired girl approached Harry. </p><p>"Wotcher! I've been looking for you, Harry. Uncle Severus said that you might need some help," The pink-haired girl said. "Oh, and my name is Nymphadora Tonks. But please call Dora or Tonks."</p><p>"Well first of all, hello Tonks and yes I am Harry and I'm assuming that Uncle Severus is Professor Snape?" Harry said. </p><p>"Yeah, that's Professor Snape. He had flooed my mother last night and asked if I could help you get situated."</p><p>"Well, thanks. It's a good thing that Professor Snape sent me a letter telling me how to get through the barrier. Hagrid may have been a good tour for the Wizarding World but, he did forget to tell me how to get through the barrier."</p><p>"Ah, he is known for forgetting a lot. I do like him though."</p><p>"I do too. He gave my muggle cousin who is bullying git a pigtail."</p><p>"Damn," Tonks said. "If I did that, magical or not, my mom would be pissed." </p><p>Harry just nodded. </p><p>"Well, I'll lead you to the train," Tonks said. "Follow me."</p><p>"Alright," Harry said.</p><p dir="ltr">Tonks led Harry to a train that said Hogwarts Express. Harry was shocked by how nice it looked. "Looks nice doesn't it?" Tonks said. "Yeah, it does," Harry said. "Alright," Tonks said. "When you get inside and find a compartment, I'll give further instructions." </p><p dir="ltr">When Harry went inside and found a compartment, Tonks said: "Alright, the compartment on top of the window is to put your luggage. When the train arrives, leave your luggage. Your luggage will be waiting for you in the house dorm your sorted in." </p><p dir="ltr">"Alright," Harry said. Harry and Tonks then sat across from each other. "What class are you looking forward to?" Tonks asked. "Well," Harry said. "I am looking forward to Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts," Harry replied in a neutral tone. Soon, a bushy-haired girl opened the compartment door. </p><p dir="ltr">"Can I sit here?" The bushy-haired girl asked.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sure," Harry said.</p><p dir="ltr">The bushy-haired girl walked in sat next to Tonks's left side. </p><p dir="ltr">"I'm Hermione Granger," The bushy-haired girl said. </p><p dir="ltr">"I'm Harry Potter," Harry said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Nice to meet you," Hermione said.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry was glad that now three people didn't freak out when they saw him. When Hagrid took him to the Leaky Cauldron, all sorts of random people wanted to shake his hand. It was a bit overwhelming for Harry. Luckily, Hagrid noticed that Harry started to get overwhelmed so, he let everybody know that they needed to get going. </p><p dir="ltr">"And my name is Nymphadora Tonks. But call me Dora or Tonks."</p><p dir="ltr">"Pleasure to meet you," Hermione said.</p><p dir="ltr">For the rest of the ride, the trio started to discuss what they were most looking forward to at Hogwarts</p><p dir="ltr">After a while, the train arrived at Hogsmeade Station.</p>
