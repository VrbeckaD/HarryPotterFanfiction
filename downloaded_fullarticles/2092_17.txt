    <p>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl named after Lilies.</p>
<p><br/>
With skin as white as snow, hair as red as blood, and eyes as green as fresh-pickled toads, she made quite the sight from her perfect, normal, picturesque, blue-eyed, blonde-haired family.</p>
<p><br/>
(Skin as white as snow, hair as red as blood and inhuman green eyes, really? That’s not <em>natural</em>)</p>
<p><br/>
So lovely was her face and so sweet <em><small>(oh sweet summer child)</small></em> was she in temperament that if you had met her, you would have remembered her <em><small>(she was………different)</small></em>, and you would have loved her <em><small>(for certain dark things are to be loved)</small></em>.</p>
<p><br/>
And so loved was she, and so, so lucky <em><small>(but she must have used up half her luck in life when she was born in the light kingdom)</small></em> for she was adored by everyone who knew her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>(Was she though?)</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They say she must have been blessed by the fae.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>(They forgot that fae never gives true blessing)</em>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Snow white and pale</p>
<p>Flesh bounding the soul</p>
<p>Paper skin and bones</p>
<p>Tear, cut and torn</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>
  <em>Ah, I’ve been amiss</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>But of course, what’s a story without its settings.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I ask you pardon, if I may, for I am not as young as I was then when everything unfolds</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Now, to let our tale move along</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Let’s talk about the place where she was born,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The territory of the South, The Light Kingdom</em>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a kingdom which was ruled by a king. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>No—to understand better one must go farther back. Further back, to a time where there were no kings, no kingdom, and there were no ‘once upon a time’s</strong>
</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Once upon a time where time was not upon once. (You see, this is where things go a <em>little</em>—a lot-- <em>confusing</em>)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were no kings nor queens nor princesses nor princes. For there were no kingdoms to be ruled and so they were not needed—nor wanted. There was no crown to be worn</p>
<p>and no power—magic to be flaunted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But what there were, once upon a time where time was not upon once, were <strong><em>gods</em></strong>. Old ones, new ones, benevolent ones, merciful ones, violent ones, ruthless ones, unkind</p>
<p>ones. All of them powerful in their own way, all of them amoral.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good and evil were relative because they were just ideas. Abstract little constructs. Made, and used, and wasted.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>
  <em>But that was then, <strong>for there are no gods now</strong></em>
  <strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Maybe they got tired of playing the human game or maybe they are still there, watching, waiting, being entertained. Feeding of human despair, egging on our greed. Or maybe they’re dead. What is a god to a non-believer? Either way, they can’t save anyone now, not humanity, and not themselves.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>But what of the humans, left to fend for themselves?</p>
<p>What of the monsters and men?</p>
<p>And what of the monsters who were once upon a time men?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Dense mist covered the land, and the moon was scarcely seen upon the sky as the sun disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>As if a dam was broken, creatures that are <em>Other</em>, creatures not of this land descended from the night.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A long war dragged across the years. Decades—Centuries—Millennia. And up to today, it’s still being fought.</p>
<p>
  <em>(But that’s another story, one which we won’t get into now.)</em>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>From the wars fought, and won, and lost, the continent was divided into four territories;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The largest of which is in the South; the Light Kingdom, where the ‘good’, ‘moral’ people reside. And in the center of it, the capital of the Light Kingdom: Grey London. From which Light Priests are born and made, and used and discarded <em>(hush now)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As per traditions made from centuries ago, back when the war was a little after its peak, each child born in the Light Kingdom at the age of eleven <em>must</em> test themselves for their potential in Light magic. As it is, not everyone was, ‘gifted’, <small><em>(muggles, whispered behind derisive sneers)</em></small> and not just anyone can be a light mage. Given the case, though that the land is severely lacking in heroes <small><em>(fodders)</em></small> to fight for the land, everyone with the barest hint of talent for it is ‘given the chance’ to join one of three prestigious schools on the Light Kingdom—<em>well, of course, <strong>given</strong> that (their) requirements are met.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Oh but <em>of course,</em> the Light-kingdom is <em>nothing</em> but <strong>fair</strong>)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Given a chance, the girl named after Lilies would have preferred a choice)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Flimsy, frail, and breakable</p>
<p>You scream but no one hears you</p>
<p>Why would they,</p>
<p>It’s all just in your head</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>She was a genius, a prodigy they say</p>
<p align="right"><em>A freak</em>, her dear sister spits in her face</p>
<p>One who has the potential, what it takes to become the next Bishop of her land</p>
<p align="right">A possession, something to be gawked at</p>
<p>She was beautiful, sweet, and kind</p>
<p align="right"><em>Desirable</em>, some<em>thing</em> to be tamed, some<em>thing</em> to be had.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>But then so it happens, as our not-quite fairy tale unfolds and moves along.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alas! The damsel must be in distress, why, how else would the hero’s virtue be shown. You ask if she needs help? What kind of question is that! Either way, she’ll get it, and then she’ll look pretty in her savior’s hands</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why of course she will marry him! He saved her. That’s the least she owes him. He DID save her after all, he must get his reward. Well her prize? What more could a pretty girl want?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’s handsome, that James Potter <em>they say</em>, and he’s chased her for all those years. Surely she must see that he loves her, and be contented and pleased.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Scarlet runs across the floor</p>
<p>And Red runs free from your veins</p>
<p>White paper skin scissored away</p>
<p>When the world fails and words break</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>That sweet little child called Lily, may she be able to rest in peace. </p>
<p>Goodbye, Lily Evans, who no one really knew. Little girl, society has decided, it’s time that you grew</p>
<p>The daughter, the prodigy, the Bishop that was once meant to be that will never be.</p>
<p>Where is your best friend? Severus Snape was it?</p>
<p>He ran? He blamed you? He accused you of betraying him with his old bully?</p>
<p>Why, surely, he must have known that you never wanted this.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The blessed one, the loved one, the favorite one, the popular one</p>
<p align="right">Is now drowning. <em>Dear sister,</em> will you help me?</p>
<p>She must be so joyful! Look at the tears running down her face. How touching</p>
<p align="right">
  <em>Touch me not</em>
</p>
<p>A muggleborn, marrying a pureblood lord, how envious!</p>
<p align="right">
  <em>She was beautiful, sweet, and kind</em>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Walking down the aisle, Lily Evans has butterflies in her stomach. With flowers in her heart and thorns in her chest, every step she takes forward feels as if she’s steeping on burning coal. Could anyone have the strength of will not to scream when burned? </p>
<p>She looks into his eyes, and she sees that he is a man in love. Not with her, but the idea of her he’s made in his mind.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Your eyes burn,</p>
<p>A testament of your pain</p>
<p>Your chest heaves,</p>
<p>A proof that you’re alive</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>He was not violent, <em>she thanks the gods she doesn’t believe in,</em> that he was not violent</p>
<p>He was gentle, almost apologetic with his actions. After everything that has to be done was done and over with, he held her close, and he brought his mouth to her ears and he whispers a quiet, <em>sorry</em></p>
<p>It’s not okay, things are still not okay. Just because he did what he did doesn’t excuse him on any of his previous action, but – Lily’s just--- <em>It’s a start</em></p>
<p>It’s more than she ever hoped for and while she wishes things could be different, goddamn it she wishes things could be different, things ARE NOT different, and it’s her life now so she got to make do of what she has and deceive herself that it’s not all going to crash down on her, this house of cards she’s building around herself made of pretty lies, ugly truths, teeth and claws, and red-rimmed truths in a smile.</p>
<p>
  <em>It’s all she can do to keep the monsters under her skin from breaking free</em>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>No good deed goes unpunished</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Things don’t necessarily become easy after that.</p>
<p>Lily is so tired but she can’t stop—she mustn’t stop</p>
<p>
  <strong>Mary did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A little girl randomly chosen as a sacrifice</p>
<p>By the gods, <em>what have you done?</em></p>
<p>A lord not necessarily of this land</p>
<p>His name?</p>
<p>We do not speak of it</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>He seems to love her; maybe he even believes it in his heart</p>
<p>Lily is falling; maybe she has been falling since the very start</p>
<p>She doesn’t need anyone to catch her, she can handle it just fine</p>
<p><em>Well, Ms. Lily Evans, top of her class, the smartest woman, no, person I’ve ever known, and the most amazing one too</em> ---stop your nonsense---<em> Hahahah, shhhhhh. I know you can handle it just fine, but let me have your back will you?</em></p>
<p>. </p>
<p>
  <em>There are bad days</em>
</p>
<p>But it’s a bad day, not a bad life</p>
<p>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You—you are not the bully I know</p>
<p><em>A mighty arrogant toe rag I was back then, huh? Don’t worry I never forgot,</em> he smiles, <em>but I like to think that even just a little, I’ve grown from the privileged jerk I was then to the</em>--, a short but belly-deep chuckle, r<em>ather dashing man I am today</em></p>
<p>What man?, she snorts, You are but a boy</p>
<p>And he is, just as she is just a girl—not men and women—whatever society may say</p>
<p>He is just as he is from the moment she was with him after their nuptials, all dramatic angles, and sincere eyes, and soft edges and big words as he mimed throwing his head back while clutching his chest.</p>
<p><em>Hit when I least expected it Lily-flower, how could you!,</em> a peal of unrestrained laughter, <em>I declare that you shall hug it better so it heals, oh powerful light mage!</em> </p>
<p>And that’s the thing, after the night of their wedding, she has never forced her to do anything against her will, and she doesn’t understand, for one fleeting moment, she wondered if it was because he doesn’t find her desirable enough, before she threw that thought away back from whatever hell it came from <em>(probably society)</em>, and then she was just curious—<em>desperate to know.</em> Why?</p>
<p>And so she asks, <em>Why?</em> , with so many things unspoken and left in the air</p>
<p>He looks at her, and he must have seen something in her eyes, something that shows her uncertainty—fears; that made him sit up straight, and <em>this— </em>this is the man James Potter has always had the potential to be in his teenage years, the leader behind the stuck-up bully, the privileged delinquent, and the entitled harasser he was. The one that got him the respect of his group of a rag-tag bunch of misfits. </p>
<p>She looks at him, and the words that have always been stuck in the back of her head after she met the seeming new him, <em>grow up, get a personality</em>, were slapped back to her. <em>Oh</em>, he has changed, she just hasn’t been looking</p>
<p>And then he talks.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Ahhh, where do I start?</p>
<p>I do not love you, Lily-flower</p>
<p>Ah, shit, wait—abort mission!</p>
<p>Damn, you James, you really fucked up this time.</p>
<p>Well, <em>*sigh*</em>, fuck shit, I’m just gonna go with it</p>
<p>I am not in love with you Lily—or to be more put</p>
<p>At least I think, <em>not yet</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>James Potter is not in love with Lily Potter</p>
<p>James Potter is starting to love Lily Evans</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Forgive me; I’m not very good with words, that is more along with your forte. </p>
<p>Funny how it works, huh?</p>
<p>I do not love you yet, Lily, because I’m still stuck up with my image of you and I’m trying to get to know you more.</p>
<p>I’m sorry if it’s a slow-going process. I really, <em>really</em> am.</p>
<p>And even right now I’m still unsure if I would be able to fall <em>in love</em> with you.</p>
<p>But me adoring you not because of whom you are but because of what I cast you as is something that no one ever deserves.</p>
<p>You can call me a hypocrite for claiming that with all the selfish things I’ve done.</p>
<p>I know you had to give up your dreams when you were married to me, and you must have felt choked up going to the altar thinking you were going to be meeting your jailer for life.</p>
<p>But please believe this one thing I’m going to say: I never wanted this for you, and I never wanted this for me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><em>I did not change for you</em>, he says solemnly</p>
<p>She jestingly shots back, <em>funnily enough, I’m not offended,</em> and she isn’t. </p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe this thing between them could work</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>One day, she asks him. <em>You know this no love story right?</em></p>
<p><em>But of course</em>, a smirk then a wink—this rascal,<em> this is a story about love</em>, he smiles</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Then the prophecy was delivered.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Mary did you know?</strong>
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>She watches, fall as they will, dew drops from the morning mist.</p>
<p>She is young, she is old, she is human, and she is a monster from prehistoric times</p>
<p>With paper skin and bones and tired inhuman eyes</p>
<p>A mindless puppet whose strings are torn tasked to face Earth once more.</p>
<p>To see the wicked path of destiny—all of mankind in death’s door</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You tell me we are one and same,</p>
<p>But I am not you.</p>
<p>You are the little voice inside my head</p>
<p>Telling me bad, bad things to do to myself,</p>
<p>Things I can’t talk about</p>
<p>For fear I’ll forget who I am and turn into you</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hush, now. No one can know.</p>
<p>Of the monsters in your skin,</p>
<p>And of the tiredness in your bones</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><em>I don’t love you yet, he says</em> </p>
<p>I don’t love you yet, she says</p>
<p align="center">I love you</p>
<p>Then everything was nothing</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>She watches, she waits, she grows up, and she dies young but all she can think about is—as the dew finally drips from the leaves – she is <em>tired.</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Pity, it was almost a love story</p>
