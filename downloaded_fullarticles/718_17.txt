    <p align="justify">Their story didn’t start in a coffee shop, in a library or in a park. Their story isn’t conventional by any means. They were, not to sound pretentious, a class of their own. You can’t mistake their relationship as cliché. And common was the world least used when it comes to them. They were not amongst those couples who met then felt the spark of love at first sight. They didn’t have the hate then love kind of relationship.</p>
<p align="justify">No, they were strangers first; strangers who knew their fate, kismet, their destiny could eventually lead them to each other. It did not mean they were actively looking for that day to come, no, it wasn’t important at the time. Don’t misunderstand the situation, it’s not that they were avoiding it; it was more along the lines of “if it will happen, it will happen, why waste time for something that only has a possibility come,” that and the fact that they had responsibilities, responsibilities that were more important than the names that were written on their flesh.</p>
<p align="justify">The year was 1985 the weather was quite mellow. It was obvious from the start, he was posh, quite possibly someone from the upper class or aristocratic even. She was just from a middle-middle class family. They were from two worlds, so near but also far apart. Worlds so different they should have not met at all. It started with a glimpse, but they did not see each other. There wasn’t love on that moment there wasn’t even a spark. It was just a ghost of what will be a ghost of future so far in the horizon.</p>
<p align="justify">They had the glimpse in the funeral. There were no negative feelings felt at the time, not to sound insensitive, the deceased wasn’t someone they knew well. The glimpse did make them catch their breath though; it was just a fraction of a second, where things made sense and everything aligned. And then reality had to make an appearance. One of them was young, too young, too immature, still developing into what they would be. The other was older, old enough to start pretending, to start making the façade. But just like in every story there needs to be a beginning, it was the first encounter.</p>
<p align="justify">When Hermione was born the peculiar name was already written in her right wrist. She was six when she learned its true importance, why she needed to cover it with a wrist guard, why it was there and why they called her by her second name in public places. Even as a young child she often wondered why her Dad had a name on his right wrist, Melissa it read, and why her Mum had none. After the first encounter, they made her sit in settee alone while they stood there, making her nervous. They seemed conflicted, but they exchanged looks and came upon an agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">“Darling I’ll make some tea.” They watched silently as her mother walked towards the kitchen, nearly tripping in a stray brolly. They heard her curse.</p>
<p align="justify">“Sweetie, are you alright?” her Dad asked.</p>
<p align="justify">“Yes, dear I’m fine—” she could feel the hesitation coming from both of her parents, “—just, just tell her Darling."</p>
<p align="justify">Her Dad was looking at her wrist curiously, making her feel more nervous. Hermione wondered if it was something she did, it must be; it was all her fault. She could feel her lips tremble, she wanted to cry but no, she was a big girl now; she was SIX! She can’t cry she didn’t do anything bad. There were too many emotions, she didn’t know how too stop it, she blinked rapidly, she needs—</p>
<p align="justify">“Sorry!” she blurted, her Dad looked panicky. She could feel wetness on her cheeks, she sniffed, “S-sorry, s-sorry Da-ad. I— I di-din’t mea-an i-it.” It was all she could say, before she needed to breathe, she made a sobbing sound. She felt a warm hug enveloped her. She heard her Mum ask her Dad, “What did you say to her, you berk.”</p>
<p align="justify">“I—” her Dad tried to say, but was stopped by the dagger like glare of her Mum.</p>
<p align="justify">“Shush, now Pumpkin, Mummy’s got you. Don’t listen to your Dad he’s just being a colossal berk.” Her Mum said while rubbing circles on her back, “Mummy’s got you, no need to be upset.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Bu-but it’s my f-fault!” she wailed, rubbing the palms of her hand on her eyes, desperate to stop the tears from flowing. It was futile effort, she could feel the conflicting emotions warring inside her, from fear, to worry, confusion and nervousness.</p>
<p align="justify">“No Pumpkin, no, it’s not your fault. You’re not in trouble,” her Mum said in a soothing voice, stroking the back of her head before patting her knees in efforts to calm her, “but your Dad probably is. Honestly, he can be such a clot.”</p>
<p align="justify">“I’m n-not?” she said in a wobbly voice.</p>
<p align="justify">“Yes, Pumpkin you’re not in any trouble. David—” her Mum said the name with an irritated tone.</p>
<p align="justify">“Yes Darling?” He said meekly.</p>
<p align="justify">“Get Hermione a glass of water will you? Oh, and David—” her Mum said in a calm, too calm tone of a voice.</p>
<p align="justify">“Yes?”</p>
<p align="justify">“The tea probably finished seeping, do go get it will you? And take your time.” From the tone alone Hermione knew that her Dad was banned from the lounge until further notice. Her Mum continued to rub circles on her back until she began to feel calmer. They heard a cough.</p>
<p align="justify">“I—” there was an awkward pause, “here’s the water and some biscuits for Hermione. I’ll just— I’ll just go back in the kitchen then.”</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione took a huge gulp from the glass. Both were seated in the settee. Her mum took hold of the wrist where the name was written. She avoided touching it, only making sure it was shown properly. “Hermione, Pumpkin, do you know what this means?” her mum asked.</p>
<p align="justify">“Ms Amy said it was a name and weren’t to speak about it,” Hermione said with hesitation.</p>
<p align="justify">“Do you know why?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Because not all people have them?” she answered with an unsure tone. She saw one of her classmate without a wrist guard, there wasn’t any name on her classmates’ wrist. Hermione also knew that her Mum didn’t have one.</p>
<p align="justify">“Yes and no. Soulmate marks are considered sacred and are supposed to lead you to your intended partner. Talking about it in public spaces may seem rude to others. And all first names are banned to be spoken out loud when you are still a minor, because some people believe that kids should be able to be ‘kids,’ ” Her Mum said calmly.</p>
<p align="justify">“It’s called a Soulmate mark?” she scrunched up her nose, making a confused face, “But you don’t have one, and Dad’s name is not yours. Plus I’m SIX; I’m not stupid, knowing the names of other people won’t scare me.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Yes, we know Pumpkin, but that doesn’t stop your Dad and I from loving each other. And Pumpkin, knowing the first names people are important and are a private thing only given to people that you trust,” Her mum said.</p>
<p align="justify">“Ok Mum I get it, it’s a private thing,” She nodded in agreement, trying to absorb what was said to her. Soon her thoughts were distracted so she said instead, “Mum… I know you and Dad won’t stop making that lovey-dovey face when you don’t think I was seeing you. ‘s there a book about Soulmates? ‘Cause I want to know everything about it.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Ok Pumpkin, we’ll go shop your book tomorrow. Your Dad and I just wanted to talk about it because we saw you look— uh… glowy? Is that the term? Luminous? No… I— never mind, you just looked happy yesterday. We think that you may have seen your Soulmate.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Really? I did feel a bit giddy yesterday, but not because we went to Mrs Thompsons’s funeral.” Hermione said with a guilty tone, worried that being giddy in a funeral is a bad thing.</p>
<p align="justify">“Well, some of my friends did say that things can happen when you meet your Soulmate,” her Mum said thoughtfully, “In some cases, they met each other plenty of times before even knowing they were Soulmates and only felt the pull when they were both ready.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Mum,” Hermione said carefully, feeling insecure, remembering all the time other kids rejected her because of her bookishness, “do you think— do you think he’ll like me? Or— or tha-that we’ll m-m-meet again someday?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Oh Pumpkin if he’s truly your Soulmate he’ll love you and cherish you till the day you perish from this world because you are the best, brightest and most beautiful partner anyone can have,” Her Mum said. It made Hermione feel a bit better and made her beam with happiness.</p>
<p align="justify">Her Dad walked in carrying a tray with tea on it. It wasn’t the end of the discussion, no, it was just the beginning. It was the first major revelation in Hermione’s life, it didn’t rock her world but it did change it fundamentally, it made Hermione feel better knowing that out there somewhere was someone for her. The second major revelation was more shocking and more earthshattering for her, it changed her life forever but that story is for another time.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Soulmate marks are curious little things, the fact that only 78.4% of the world’s pairings ever gets to find their intended partner, made Mycroft sceptical to it even though he saw True Bonds growing up. And that statistic was only for those who were born with Soulmate marks, about 2 out of 21 people in the world were born without a Soulmate mark. People seldom talk about Soulmate marks; it is only mentioned in private settings.</p>
<p align="justify">Many people do try to find their intended as there is something romantic about the notion of finding your one true love. Legends are often told about Soulmates finding one another; examples of these include Romeo and Juliet, Mr Darcy and Elizabeth, and plenty more. Despite its mysticism, there is century’s worth of scientific and philosophical papers dedicated to the phenomena and origins of the soulmate mark. Scientists and Philosophers alike would argue about its origins, have debates whether the marks are signs of love and compatibility or are the work of fate, or of a higher entity. And not all marry their intended; some just gives up trying after a long time of pinning and waiting for their Soulmate come.</p>
<p align="justify">When he was young he used to stare at his wrist for a long time wondering what his soulmate would be like. It was his third favourite pastime next only to reading and eating. His parents are part of a True Bond, soulmates who met their intended. He used to listen in the story of how his parents met, making him more determined to find the one. He was impatient and eager, wanting to show to other people that there is someone in the world who was meant for him.</p>
<p align="justify">It was his main priority back in the day; to find his soulmate but that changed when his brother was born. The year was 1980, he was mesmerized by the birth of his brother. The cherubic face and the sweet curls that his brother possessed made him feel protective. He hadn’t experience it before, that intense feeling of protectiveness. He made a vow that day he made it his priority; his brother came first before his own happiness, his brother’s safety before his. It changed him fundamentally in ways his seven year old self couldn’t comprehend. He began to loose interest in actively finding his intended. He was too preoccupied caring for his baby brother. And then Eurus was born. From the start Mycroft could already see that she was a strange child. But it didn’t stop him from making the same vow he made when Sherlock was born.</p>
<p align="justify">The thoughts of finding his soulmate hadn’t crossed his mind in years. But then 1985 happened, he was 12, his brother was 5, and his sister was 4. Things were doing fine back home. Sherlock had a new friend, Victor Trevor was his name. His Mummy decided to retire early, and his Dad’s garden was blooming. But there was something, something that Mycroft felt was missing.</p>
<p align="justify">That is until he turned. He saw her, someone ordinary, some girl he never saw before, someone— that is just <em>‘Her.’ </em> The Experience was, and yes with the capital E, unlike and yet so much alike the time he first held Sherlock. Mycroft felt something bubbling up in the pit of his stomach, it wasn’t unpleasant in fact it felt almost like anticipation. Then it was gone in a flash. The Girl turned her head away from Mycroft’s sight and the strange thing was before she did, her face broke into this blinding smile. A smile that was out of place in a funeral.</p>
<p align="justify">Mycroft shook his head. He scanned the place searching for Sherlock but the remembering that his brother was left with the Trevor’s. He rubbed his wrist unconsciously, contemplating if the Experience did indeed happen. He tried to scan the crowd but alas nothing happened, he did not feel anything similar for the rest of the day.</p>
<p align="justify">It was the year of change for Mycroft. And the only thing that He remembers from that moment, from the Experience was that ‘She” had nice eyes. A nice, very expressive set of eyes. Never mind that try as he might he couldn’t remember their colour. Many things happened after that and not necessarily for the best. Eurus started her Game, the Game that would become the foundation to everything. Sherlock forgot about his best friend. It would be a year later but the fire—</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">The<em> Fire…</em></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Everything was good… it was great but suddenly it was not.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>The Fire—</em>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Anything else could have been better.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>Musgrave… his home—</em>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">There was smoke. It was Dark. Nobody knew. <strong>Nobody.</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>Sherlock… Oh Gods Sherlock—</em>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">It was the last straw. His uncle, Rudolph "Rudy" Holmes, decided that Eurus— his baby sister was out of their reach. So they planned, Mycroft together with his Uncle and not with his parents because they were too irrational and because he was the responsible one, they planned to stop her madness. It pained Mycroft to hurt his parents, to hurt Eurus but his uncle convinced him that it was the right choice to make. That it was better to end their suffering. He grew up that year, faster that his parents could have imagined. He lost all of his baby fat, not due to diets or exercise but due to stress. Stress that someone his age should have never known.</p>
<p align="justify">It would be a long time before any thoughts of Soulmate would enter his mind, years even. He would have forgotten them entirely if not for the fact that he saw ‘Her’ again. Those eyes, he could never forget them. Even if he forget Soulmates, those eyes will forever haunt him.</p>
