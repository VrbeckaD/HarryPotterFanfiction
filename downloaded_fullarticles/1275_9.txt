  <span>“Taking interest, Tom? You could do better.” Abraxas says cheerfully in almost a teasing tone, drawing my eyes to his almost with an involuntary glare, but he notices as he always does with a sharp look of terror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever do you mean Abraxas?” I ask with a tone sweet, though Alphard and Lestrange still discreetly scoot back from their positions right next to me. Rosier grins mildly, at which Avery flicks him for, with both of them focusing their eyes back on me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were staring-I mean observing- that student over there. Should we investigate him for you?” Abraxas says quickly, almost bowing, though that would be far too dangerous under the watchful eye of Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who Is he,” I cast a quick glance at the boy, watching as he whispers to himself rapidly, “I should recognize the faces of my fellow slytherins, no matter how. Insignificant.” I look to Lestrange almost on instinct.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Transfer student, Mudblood.” He states, casting a quick glance at the kid's face, “Possibly the illegitimate child of some family, would you like me to investigate that further, sir?” The word makes me want to smile most evil, though I simply tap on the table once. The signal passes, and I want to make him pay for casting possible suspicion, perhaps I will. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No matter, we can talk about this more back in the common room, I am interested in the subject make sure to gather more of him. Do you know anything else Abraxas?” Alphard throws a mild glare at Orion, most likely due to Orion’s heirship, or the fact Orion still refuses to join us despite Alphard’s insistence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No offense, but it is not worth looking into him. He should be in hufflepuff, some poor excuse for a slytherin, spending our entire care of magical creatures class trying to befriend Gryffindors like some cretin.” Abraxas says, grimacing as we watch the other student greet the social outcast Myrtle, “Look, he is doing it again, associating with that pigeon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Most likely, though I will not risk him being more than he appears.” I stand, attracting the gaze of many throughout the hall as I walk down the path. I wonder if any of them know of the Slytherin King, that he is me, though guessing at the gazes of lust and admiration one would claim no.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlus Potter glares at me, causing the glare of Septimus Weasley and Ignatius Prewett to follow. Minerva looks up from a book near the trio with a sheepish smile, which I return as one laced with charm, but that will only bring about the ire of the reds. I plan to go to the library but the heavy weight of some very familiar eyes follow me as I walk, so I take a turn to the black lake as I walk out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She follows me the way there, keeping her near painful gaze on me in a way that turns my stomach to knots and question my actions, though I walk out in the open when she does not. I perch on the rock, waiting for her to see the right time to arrive. The form at the Hogwarts gates still watches me, her moonshine white hair standing out against the dark grey of the stone, though when the fog blankets her, the form disappears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a few moments the thin form of an albino snake slithers onto my hand, to which I raise to eye level. She curls in a way so that she can raise the upper half of her body in the air, though she is only a few inches long.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Have you found the information I asked for Riddle? If you prove to be timely perhaps so will I</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She hisses, before glaring in almost an expectant manner.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You first Rowena. I asked a much more, unlikely, request for you to find. And as I have already given you information, I would demand some in return.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It is well within my bounds Riddle, do not underestimate the power of the Ravenclaw Court, or you will face her wrath. Though you have a point, and I am sure you will enjoy the information we found.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Which is?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The chamber of Slytherin is real. If you manage to enter and retrieve some of the books we may offer you some even higher favors. Now, for the information about our newest target?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The favors I expect will be quite high if you truly manage that, I am the only option you have, and you know that your lizard speak isn’t true parseltongue. I am working on your new target, Hadrian Evans wasn’t it?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yes, Athena herself is invested in this, and we wouldn’t want a Hogwarts house war, would we? She only expects you to know the secrets of one of your own subjects, this is not too much to ask.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I will have the information soon, I wouldn’t want to offend Athena, would I? Perhaps we should meet in person to discuss some of the finer details of this new union between our houses, peace is so much better than war isn’t it Rowena?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Athena is not ready to reveal herself to any of the snakes, you must understand this as a King yourself. </span>
  </em>
  <span> And with those words she slides away, disappearing into the heavy fog, the only evidence of her return to human form is the movement of the doors seen from far away.</span>
</p><p> </p><ul>
<li><span>Later at night</span></li>
</ul><p> </p><p>
  <span>In an empty hallway, in an empty wing, on an empty floor I stand alone. The airy cool burns into my toes through the layer of my boots, I cast glances around myself before tapping four times on the thirteenth brick up from the bottom, with a smooth shimmer the wall becomes as is the platform 9 ¾.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When I enter Lestrange hands me a folded piece of parchment, which I quickly pocket. The rest of the knights are staring at me in silence. I take my place at the center of the room, walking with eyes on me from silent people.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Dark arts, can be used, can be harnessed. They are tools, and the rest of magic is, even though the stupider ones in our society attempt to ban them, we can utilize the advantage to show them our own power.” My speech continues, drawing in hungry eyes that just want to fit in in a world that tries to hurt them for what their families are. They flock to me, like a bee to nectar, like a moth to light, like a cow to the slaughterhouse, though none of them can see the harm they bring to themselves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Today you will be using the nerve burning curse.” I say, taking out my wand as everybody starts to stare with fear, “This curse Adrenti Nervum causes all of the nerves in one’s body to burn, and if used for long enough to cause permanent numbing. This curse is a close cousin of the cruciatus curse, though the main difference between these two is that the cruciatus curse affects the mind, causing the most intense pain possible by over stimulating the pain centers of the brain. This curse targets the pan centers in the body, which lets the mind remain intact as the body feels as if burning in hellfire.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Knights line up in the individual dueling areas, raising their wands towards each other without question. Lestrange does not though, standing near me as the rest fall to pairs, observing the rest at my side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You may hold your opponent under the curse for no longer than twenty seconds, and with that, fire.” After a few tense moments the first scream erupts from the far end of the room, Avery writhes on the floor with a disgusting amount of weeping and crying. Abraxas stands over him with eyes blown wide, and we all watch as the timer ticks down to 0, at which Abraxas reluctantly lets up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lestrange tenses at my side, as if he expects me to fire the curse at him next, though I resist the urge and instead mutter to him, “I need to discuss the information you just gave to me.” Lestrange nods, and follows me back to the sitting room area without hesitation. As he watches I unravel the parchment given to me.</span>

</p><p>
  <b>7:56 enters Gryffindor dormitories</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does he stare at the Quidditch pitch for 95 minutes Lestrange?” I ask, more bewildered than disbelieving, this whole report is mildly strange.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-h” Lestrange furrows his eyebrows, biting his lip, “I don’t remember.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you mind If I check for myself, Lestrange?” We pause for a moment, as the cacophony of screams becomes too much to talk over, in a way that makes me want to scream in joy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course not sir.” He stutters, closing his eyes for a moment in concentration before opening them to me, I look at his face before diving into the memory like a diver to molasses.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>I feel myself tingle under the disillusionment charm, footsteps falling perfectly in line to the ones of the man in front of me. The other walks about 20 meters ahead, and very slowly at that.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Hadrian sits down, and my head moves to check a pocket watch, taking note of this act. Evans watches something, but stays as still as a statue. I sit down as well after a few moments. </b>
</p><p>
  <b>My eyes get surprisingly heavy, but I keep them open, staring until I cannot anymore. When I blink the heaviness recedes, and a soft tone comes from the target.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>I check my watch to write down this behavior, the time reading 6:45. I feel the mind I inhabit try to think back to what happened, but only remembers a few short minutes. A haze of confusion pasees over until I can feel the mind forget about that strange occurrence. </b>
</p><p>
  <b>When I look up the target is staring at me directly in the eyes, with ones of chilling green.</b>
</p><p> </p><ul>
<li><span>The next day</span></li>
</ul><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the slytherin common room I lounge around, strategically close to Hadrian Evans who sits silently and reads a muggle novel. Watching as people gather for the mandatory meetings every morning. Everybody sits around, and the Slytherin Courtier of second year waltzes in. Thesius Parkinson holds his head high, carrying the next one of my orders to pin to the board. Pining a note that simply says:</span>
</p><p>
  <b>All Students in OWL or NEWT years must attend mandatory tutoring if their class grades are Acceptable or Less</b>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is a decree directly from King Cobra himself. You will do well to all follow it.” Parkinson states in an almost boasting manner, walking off to the chairs himself silently. The students around us whisper questions, wondering who the slytherin king is and why he might do this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the novelty I lean over to Hadrian, “Who do you think Cobra is?” I whisper, close enough to smell a faint burning or charring.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If It’s anyone it’s you Riddle.” He mutters, not even looking up from his book, but holding a bookmark out of his pocket now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whyever would you claim that, I hear that most of the Kings are ones with family connections.” I whisper, but my heart beats unnaturally fast and near painful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I may be stupid Riddle, but I am not blind.” He says with a heavily biting tone, then stands up, leaving. After a few moments to make sure that he doesn’t notice me I follow as he walks to the library. The parchment with my new notes weights heavy in my pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A boy with curly brown hair walks up to me in the hallway, and I recognize his face immediately. He is the former king of the ravens, Augul Caesarium, when he walks by me I slip the parchment into his hand, and he leaves quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I follow Evans to the library, where he checks out the textbooks and starts to do piles upon piles of homework with strange efficiency. I check out some of the books on transfiguration to read as I watch him. Nothing strange happens, nothing out of place, no reason why Athena would want to watch him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No reason at all.</span>
