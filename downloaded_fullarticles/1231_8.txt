Sam defended his choice.</p><p>"Well now whadya think, Sammy?"</p><p>Sam rolled his shoulders and neck and held tight to his brother's hand. "Y'know, this is why I never asked you to be on my team when we were kids."</p><p>An exasperated "Augh!", and Dean gripped Sammy's hand tighter, nodded to the children they were linked with, and led them in yelling, "Red Rover, Red Rover, send that <em>damn witch</em> on over!"</p><p>The crone's grin was the type to give Dean nightmares, and Sam flinched as she came rushing towards the barrier of their hands.</p><p>"Next time a witch is obsessed with kids games, we torch first and ask questions later!"</p><p>"Shut up, Dean!"</p>
