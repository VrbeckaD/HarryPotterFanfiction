    <p>They were going to be leaving in a few days for the summer holiday. Harry had expected to get his usual lecture about remaining at the Dursleys. He wasn't going to but he knew Dumbledore expected him too. Harry wasn't expecting this development. Harry was still staring at Dumbledore. He was trying to think about what the man was trying to do now. He knew Dumbledore had some crazy scheme he was going to pull. "You want to know my Patronus?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Why?" Harry watched Dumbledore play with his beard as he sucked on a lemon drop. Harry lost count of the number of times he wished Dumbledore would choke on one of the lemon drops. He also lost count of the number of times he wished he could strangle Dumbledore with his own beard.</p><p>"Voldemort was able to get a ritual returned. Every student who is seventeen on the first of September will have to be married. All single wizards and witches will also have to participate. It's an old ritual that involves using the Patronus Charm. The ones with the male and female of a species will have to marry or bond. The one with the male will be listed as the husband, the female will be listed as the wife."</p><p>Harry arched his brows. He immediately thought of Ron and Hermione, they certainly wouldn't be getting married. He knew Ginny wasn't his match and let out a mental sigh of relief. He also knew Dumbledore was going to be surprised by their Patronus. If Dumbledore really thought this was going to work out as he hoped, he better start working on his youngest future Order members Patronus. "I see. When is the ceremony?"</p><p>"Hogwarts will be in session on the 31st of August with the ceremony on the 1st. I really need to know your Patronus as we need to make sure you are protected."</p><p>"No. I won't be revealing it." Harry knew the real reason. Dumbledore could force a person to have their Patronus changed. Harry had read about how a magically strong wizard like Dumbledore could influence and force a change of weaker wizard with enough exposure to the weaker one as they cast the spell. Harry had kept his hidden for the last few years and he wasn't going to expose it now. Harry let out a mental laugh as he thought about his friends' Patronus.</p><p>"Harry, you must be protected."</p><p>"I will be." Harry had heard about marrying Ginny. The Weasley family, Hermione, and most of the Order wanted it to happen. How they would be just like his parents. How James had married a red-head. How James and Lily was the perfect couple. He heard from Sirius how much Ginny reminded him of Lily. Harry had wanted to be sick as he hoped his mother wasn't like Ginny. He did acknowledge that Sirius had been confusing him and his father so Harry hoped he had confused Ginny with his mother. He knew there was one reason no one ever mentioned. They wanted access to Harry's money. Dumbledore needed funds for the war. Ginny was also talking about how it would be nice not to be so poor while her brother would mention fame and Harry. Hermione was all about using his money to promote her views and what she wanted. </p><p>"Harry, this is important. Voldemort had this passed for a reason."</p><p>Dumbledore used Voldemort to get his way as well as the greater good line when people objected to his ideas. Dumbledore always seemed to forget that Harry had a connection to Voldemort when he wanted Harry to do something. If Voldemort really got this law passed, Voldemort's happiness would have leaked through the link. Contrary to what Snape and Dumbledore believed, Harry had tried. He also researched Horcruxes. Since he was the only living Horcrux and the Horcrux was in his brain, he came to the conclusion there really wasn't a way for him to completely block Voldemort.  "No. I'm not going to reveal it."</p><p>"My boy, you could be in danger."</p><p>Danger from you and your Order. He had one year left to finish Hogwarts. He already started working on his escape route for when he was done with Hogwarts. Dumbledore didn't know that Harry had retaken his OWLs and taken OWLs for courses that Hogwarts didn't have. He was already accepted at the Italian University of Magical Beings. "I will be at Hogwarts. I will be fine. After all, isn't it the safest place?" Harry tuned out Dumbledore after that.</p><p>_______________________________________________________</p><p>Harry resisted rolling his eyes as Hermione was lecturing the whole common room about the Patronus Charm. Ron had opened his mouth and announced the marriage ritual when they returned. This was after Hermione had given Harry a lecture on not obeying Dumbledore and revealing his Patronus. </p><p>"It's the most famous and famously difficult defensive charm. The aim is to produce a silvery-white guardian or protector which takes the form of an animal. The exact form of the Patronus will not be apparent until the spell has been successfully cast. One of the most powerful defensive charms known to wizardkind, the Patronus can also be used as a messenger between wizards. As a pure, protective magical concentration of happiness and hope. It's the recollection of a single talisman memory is essential in its creation. It is the only spell effective against Dementors. The majority of witches and wizards are unable to produce Patronuses and to do so is generally considered a mark of superior magical ability."</p><p>"So we all have to do this?" Mitchell, a fifth-year, looked a bit confused.</p><p>"Oh, no. Some witches and wizards may manage an uncorporeal Patronus which resembles a mass or wisp of silvery vapour or smoke. In some cases, a witch or wizard may choose to produce an incorporeal Patronus deliberately if he or she wishes to disguise the form it generally takes. Professor Lupin, for instance, is afraid that his corporeal Patronus gives too much away so he didn't allow his to fully develop. The incorporeal Patronus is not a true Patronus and while it will give limited protection it cannot provide the defensive power of the corporeal Patronus which has the form and substance of an animal."</p><p>"Who?" One of the first years looked around. They hadn't heard of Lupin.</p><p>"He was here during our third year. He taught DADA." Ron had a bit of smugness about it. "He's Harry's adopted godfather."</p><p>Harry didn't even speak. He just shrugged his shoulders and ignored everyone as Hermione started speaking again and would have overridden anything he might have attempted to say. He had wondered when he started to allow them to speak for him. He had tried to remember when it started but he really couldn't remember a time when they didn't. </p><p>"The Patronus Charm is one of the most ancient of charms and appears in many accounts of early magic. In spite of a long association with those fighting for lofty or noble causes. Those able to produce corporeal Patronuses were often elected to high office within the Wizengamot and Ministry of Magic. Thankfully, that policy is not true any longer."</p><p>Harry wondered where Hermione got that idea. </p><p>"Also, it is a great way to tell if someone is dark. They can't produce one." Ron knowingly added. "Dumbledore even said so."</p><p>Hermione lowered the book she had been reading from. "It's Headmaster Dumbledore, Ron. How many times must I tell you that you need to respect the Headmaster." Hermione returned to the book not seeing most of the room were rolling their eyes. "No reliable system for predicting the form of an individual’s Patronus has ever been found. Although the great eighteenth-century researcher of Charms, Professor Catullus Spangle, set forth certain principles that are widely accepted as true. The Patronus, asserted Spangle, represents that which is hidden, unknown but necessary within the personality. For it is evident that a human confronted with inhuman evil, such as the Dementor, must draw upon resources he or she may never have needed and the Patronus is the awakened secret self that lies dormant until needed but which must now be brought to light."</p><p>"What book?" Parvati Patil asked. </p><p>Harry looked at her. She stared at him with a smirk. Harry winked. He knew it was Padma. </p><p>Hermione looked at her stack of books but didn't see the title she was looking for. "In the footnotes here it says Charms of Defence and Deterrence."</p><p>"Thank you." Parvati wrote the title down.</p><p>Harry tuned out the rest of Hermione's reading out loud. He knew she picked that book for a reason. He also knew what they believed about dark wizards was false. While there was widespread and in some cases, justified, belief that a wizard who was not pure of heart could not produce a successful Patronus many of questionable morals did so. Harry shuddered a bit as he remembered Umbridge produced a cat Patronus to protect herself from the Dementors. What Hermione and Dumbledore never realized is that many who work with dark creatures become desensitized to the effects of the Dark creatures with whom they may ally themselves and simply regard the Patronus Charm as an unnecessary spell to have in their arsenal. Harry wouldn't have had him as well as most of those at Hogwarts if he hadn't been for his third year.</p><p>Harry also knew that the form of a Patronus may change during the course of a witch or wizard’s life. Instances have been known of the form of the Patronus transforming due to bereavement, falling in love, or profound shifts in a person’s character. Nymphadora Tonks’s Patronus changed from a jackrabbit to a wolf when she fell in love with Remus Lupin. Some witches and wizards may be unable to produce a Patronus at all until they have undergone some kind of psychic shock. Harry had a feeling Dumbledore was going to be working hard over the summer holiday to make sure he got the people he wanted to be joined in marriage had the correct pairing. </p><p>"Harry." Hermione punched him. "Are you listening? I was talking about the different animals the charm could take. The book says it is usual but not inevitable, for a Patronus to take the form of an animal commonly found in the caster’s native country. Given their long affinity with humans it is perhaps unsurprising that among the most common Patronuses, although it must be remembered that any corporeal Patronus is highly unusual, are dogs, cats, and horses. However, every Patronus is as unique as its creator and even identical twins have been known to produce very different Patronuses. Mine is a grey cat. What is yours' Harry?" </p><p>"I'm not telling." </p><p>"You know it's a horse just like mine." Ginny put her hand on Harry's leg. </p><p>Harry removed her hand. "I'm not saying." </p><p>Hermione ignored him. "It's not a big deal. It's not like everyone will be spreading it around and everyone will know when we return and the ritual occurs."</p><p>"I'm not saying." </p><p>"Fine." Hermione huffed. </p><p>"Can a Patronus be a dragon? I would love for mine to be a dragon." Dennis announced.</p><p>"Extinct Patronuses are very rare but not unknown." Hermione looked down at the book. "It says that strangely, given their long connection with wizardkind, owl Patronuses are unusual. Most uncommon of all possible Patronuses are magical creatures such as dragons, Thestrals, and phoenixes. Never forget, though, that one of the most famous Patronuses of all time was a lowly mouse. It belonged to a legendary young wizard called Illyius, who used it to hold off an attack from an army of Dementors single-handedly. While a rare and magical Patronus undoubtedly reflects an unusual personality, it does not follow that it is more powerful or will enjoy greater success at defending its caster."</p><p>"A mouse?" Ron started laughing. "I thought Pettigrew's was bad with him being a rat."</p><p>Harry got up. "I'm heading to the library. I want to get started on my summer holiday assignments." He didn't give them a chance to respond.</p><p>________________________________________________</p><p>"Potter, my office, now." </p><p>Harry wasn't surprised to hear Snape's voice. He wasn't sure what was wrong but he followed Snape to his office. Snape sat down behind his desk. "The headmaster has informed me you refused to provide him with your Patronus." </p><p>"Yes, sir." Harry hadn't sat down. </p><p>Snape leaned back in his chair as if assessing him. Harry wasn't sure what was occurring but he arched a brow. </p><p>"I also learned something interesting that the Headmaster doesn't seem to be aware of." Snape gave an evil smirk. "Someone retook their OWLs and it wasn't just for those in Hogwarts."</p><p>"I see." Harry wasn't sure where this was going. They stared at each other for several seconds. Snape pulled out his wand and Harry felt privacy wards. "Privacy wards."</p><p>"Yes. What I'm about to say won't be leaving this room." Snape opened his top desk drawer. "I'm aware that the Headmaster informed you that the Dark Lord was behind this marriage ritual and what it means." Harry didn't scoff but his face must have shown something. "Potter, I'm not sure what exactly happened but I did notice the changes over the last few years." He laid a scroll down. "I'm also aware of what your Patronus is because of our sessions." </p><p>"I'm aware." Harry had remembered when during their remedial potions lessons Snape broke into his mind and saw his Patronus. </p><p>Snape pulled out his wand. "Expecto Patronum." Harry knew his face showed his shock. "I believe we have something to discuss."</p><p>"I'll say." Harry looked at the school. "Is he aware of this?" </p><p>"No. I'm sure he will attempt to create a contract for us when he learns. I know you are legally an adult and can sign a marriage contract." Snape pointed to a chair. "Sit."</p><p>Harry sat down. "I'm not sure how you know this but I know you are correct." </p><p>Snape handed him the scroll. "It's a basic marriage agreement. Including is the dating schedule during the engagement."</p><p>Harry opened the scroll. He read a bit and saw some of the clauses and rules. He looked at Snape's desk, grabbed a quill, and started changing things. Snape didn't look happy as he wrote but he ignored him. He handed the scroll back to Snape. Harry watched Snape read his corrections. They did it back and forth until they had what they both wanted. </p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Harry left Hogwarts. He meant his family at the station. No one spoke as Uncle Vernon drove. Vernon stopped at Acton Old Town Hall. Harry got out but before he moved away, the window was rolled down. "Be here on the 31st at 8 AM. I won't wait a minute beyond that." </p><p>"I'm aware." Harry had already given the man half of the money for the ride. Harry headed to the closest bus station. Neville and Lady Longbottom were waiting for him.</p>
