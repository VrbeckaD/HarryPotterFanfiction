    <p>Draco Malfoy had seen his fair share of the strange and unusual. He’d seen terrible things (a lot of them) and beautiful things (less of those) but by far the most disconcerting thing he’d ever seen was right in front of him. It had been a normal day until Draco rounded the corridor and saw a small rumpled blur crash to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>It appeared to be a child, much too young to be a Hogwarts student, and Draco approached him warily as he got back up, but froze when the figure came into view—standing in front of him was a pint-sized Harry Potter.</p><p> </p><p>He looked to be about 8 years old, swimming in too big robes, mop of unruly black hair getting in his eyes that looked huge behind his now ill-fitting glasses. The scar on his forehead seemed bigger stretching across his small face. He was scowling at his robes and attempting to gather as much of the fabric in his tiny fists as he could, presumably so he could resume running.</p><p> </p><p>There were a lot of things Draco could have said, and surely should have said, but all he could think as he stared at the Tiny Chosen One was:</p><p> </p><p>“Your clothes are too big.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter started, looking up so fast that his glasses fell off his face, though he didn’t move to pick them up. He hunched in on himself as if to appear smaller, cautiously looking at Draco but not responding. Draco took a slow step forward and picked up the glasses, held them out to Potter because really, the situation couldn’t get any more surreal.</p><p> </p><p>Potter took them cautiously, blinking as he put them back on and could see properly. He stepped back from Draco but offered a mumbled, “Thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you running from?” Draco asked, honestly curious, “You aren’t going to get far tripping over those,” He continued, gesturing at the robes pooled around Potter’s feet. “You look like an idiot.” He added by reflex. </p><p> </p><p>Potter was startled out of his caution by that insult and ignored the questions, “You look like an idiot too!” He exclaimed, “Who even wears robes?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re wearing a robe.” Draco deadpanned.</p><p> </p><p>“Not by choice!” Tiny Potter hissed.</p><p> </p><p>“What would you rather wear then?” Draco asked, idly wondering if he was dreaming.</p><p> </p><p>“Normal clothes!” Potter harrumphed, crossing his arms over his chest. Draco considered him and belatedly remembered that Potter had grown up muggleborn.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re wearing m…Normal clothes under your robe,” Draco pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“They’re too big too.” Potter was doing something weird and scrunchy with his tiny face. Something that looked dangerously like the first step to tears. Draco attempted to figure out what to do.</p><p> </p><p>Potter obviously had no idea who he was, otherwise he wouldn’t have spoken to Draco at all. He was also very obviously a young boy who was confused and disoriented. And his clothes didn’t fit. Draco frowned in irritation. If he abandoned Tiny Potter in the hallway the attitude of his peers would undoubtedly go from dismissive and hostile to disgusted and hateful. Plus, Potter was just standing there in his puddle of oversized clothes, looking quite pathetic and very different from the Perfect Golden Boy that Draco had been fighting with since first year. Plus Draco had a free period. He sighed and turned back around toward the Slytherin common room.</p><p> </p><p>“If you come with me I’ll fix your clothes.”</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t wait to see if Potter followed, but soon enough Draco heard a telltale shuffling behind him.</p><p> </p><p>The Tiny Chosen One seemed to calm down the deeper they got into the cool castle, though for what reason Draco couldn’t tell. Potter had stopped staring at the ground and was looking around with curiosity, though his expression became subdued whenever he noticed Draco's scrutiny. They arrived at the right stretch of wall and Draco muttered “Teamwork” under his breath, glaring at the wall while it slid open. Potter followed him inside.</p><p> </p><p>The common room was badly lit and blessedly empty. After a brief look at the wonder on Tiny Potter’s face as he appraised the glowing green lamps, Draco led him to the section of the hall that he and Blaise had drunkenly modified into a window. It let in a tiny amount of light from the murky lake above, and terrified first years. Draco liked it. He wasn’t sure it would stop any of them from developing vitamin D deficiencies—but Grindylows and Merfolk occasionally swam by, and Millicent swore she’d seen the Giant Squid one late night.</p><p> </p><p>Draco left Potter pressed curiously against the window and headed to his room. He pulled his least favorite pair of trousers out and shrank them to what he thought would fit weird-small-Potter. As he searched for a shirt Draco considered the situation. Somehow Potter had been reduced to his 8-year-old body and mental state. The Gryffindors had potions around the time that Draco had found him, so obviously something had happened. But Draco had never heard of a potion that reversed age like this, and couldn’t think of a reason anyone would have poisoned The Boy Who Lived, for all that he was literally a boy now.</p><p> </p><p>Draco sighed. He couldn’t find any shirts he didn’t like. He glared at nothing in particular and grabbed a soft sweater his Mother had sent him, shrinking it before he could change his mind and leaving the room. When he got back into the hall where Tiny Potter stood he was surprised to see that a small crowd of Merfolk had gathered on the other side of the glass, watching Potter laugh as they flipped through the water, holding up colorful rocks from the lake bed that he delighted in. He’d been in the Slytherin dorms for two minutes and already had a devoted group of fans. Fish fans. Draco sighed again.</p><p> </p><p>Potter looked up as he approached, smiling slightly and gesturing at the Merfolk with his robe-swallowed hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Look! Did you know Mermaids were real? And Mermen too I guess,” Potter considered the creatures, pressed up against the glass again. “Dudley would never believe me; do you have a camera?” Draco did not have a camera.</p><p> </p><p>“Go put these on, my free period is almost over.” Not that he had anything afterwards. Potter turned back and noticed the clothes, grabbing them with delight, and followed Draco’s finger to the bathroom entrance. He skipped off, only tripping once. Draco frowned at the Merfolk, who frowned back, swimming away haughtily now that their tiny charge was out of sight. The initial problem of ill-fitting clothes was solved, Draco figured he probably had to return Tiny Potter to his friends or some sort of authority, as they were probably looking for him.</p><p> </p><p>Draco didn’t notice Potter’s return until there was a tug at his sleeve, he looked down in annoyance. The pants seemed to fit fine, the sweater was a little too big but Draco thought that would be best to keep him warm. The young wizard was holding onto the edge of the sweater sleeves now that he’d let go of Draco.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” He said quietly, darting a look at Draco and then quickly looking out the lake window, “What’s your name?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco considered him for a second before answering cautiously, “Draco Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter scrunched up his nose, respect forgotten in the face of his confusion.</p><p> </p><p>“What kind of name is <em>Draco</em>?” He asked, mouth moving weirdly around the unfamiliar syllables.</p><p> </p><p>“My name, are you making fun of me?” Draco almost smirked at the look of contrite embarrassment that crossed Tiny Potter’s face, it was an expression he’d never seen on the other in all the years they’d known each-other.</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Tiny Potter exclaimed hastily, waving his sweater covered hands in the air as if to physically clear up the misunderstanding, dropping his bundle of robes in the process. “I’ve just never heard that name before!”</p><p> </p><p>Draco snorted and picked the clothes up off the floor, leading the way back towards his room. Potter followed, embarrassment forgotten and replaced by curiosity as they entered. Draco supposed his room would look strange to a muggleborn new to the wizarding world; ancient tomes lined his desk, potion ingredients scattered the window sill, a cauldron bubbled by the small fireplace (a potion he was making for Pansy), and glowing stones were strung up around his bed (extra warding against unfriendly visitors). There was also a Probity Probe, Secrecy Sensor, and Sneakoscope on his bedside table, all sent by his paranoid mother</p><p> </p><p>Tiny Potter was at the desk, picking up a quill, his face wrinkled in confusion.</p><p> </p><p>“Why would you write with a feather?” He was looking at Draco’s unfinished arithmancy paper. “These are so old fashioned.”</p><p> </p><p>“That one corrects spelling mistakes.” Draco explained in a bored tone. Potter didn’t reply to that, just huffed as if to say, ‘<em>yeah right</em>’, and turned around.</p><p> </p><p>“Where did the robe go?” He asked in confusion, looking around where Draco had put the clothes down.</p><p> </p><p>“House-elves do the laundry,” Draco explained impatiently, “We have to take you back now—come on.”</p><p> </p><p>“What are house elves? Where are we going?” Potter continued to ask as they left the room.</p><p> </p><p>“House elves are servants, they keep places clean and do all the cooking,” Knowing Potter wouldn’t be satisfied with that Draco was quick to answer his next question, “Got to take you back to your golden friends.” They exited the common room, Potter jumping a bit when the stone wall slid closed behind them, but quickly caught up with Draco down the hall.</p><p> </p><p>“Who are my friends?” He asked, sounding weirdly breathless, Draco looked down at his astonished face. “The ones from earlier?” He questioned, Draco assumed he meant potions.</p><p> </p><p>“The annoyingly tall red-head and frizzy-haired genius?” Draco internally winced when he realized what he’d called Granger. “Yes, those are your devoted followers.”</p><p> </p><p>Tiny Potter didn’t seem perturbed by Draco’s description, but after a moment of deliberation he looked down.</p><p> </p><p>“I ran away from them…” He said, sounding guilty, glasses sliding down his nose again. “They probably hate me now...”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve done a lot worse,” Draco responded after a moment, steadfastly looking forward as he led Potter to the Great Hall. “They’ve stayed with you this long, I don’t doubt they’ll stay with you now.” Potter didn’t say anything, but he looked appeased when Draco glanced at him, flushed happily and walking with a bit of a bounce in his step. Draco heard him murmur the word ‘<em>friends</em>’ under his breath and had to look away from the open wonderment on his face.</p><p> </p><p>The Great Hall was already full of students for the evening meal. No one looked up at Draco until he was farther in and Tiny Potter could be seen behind his tall frame and billowing robes. Hushed whispers could be heard from the tables they passed but Draco ignored them until he reached the Gryffindors.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe he went outside? You don’t think he left campus—”</p><p> </p><p>“’Mione the staff is looking for him he’ll be <em>fine</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ron he’s a child—!” Granger cut off as Thomas nudged her and everyone that hadn’t already spotted Draco looked up as one. She regarded him with a cautious, bemused expression.</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy? What are—?” She cut off as Tiny Potter peered out from behind Draco, looking contrite behind his huge glasses.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry!” She exclaimed, jumping up with Weasely behind her. The two rushed over and a few other Gryffindors stood up, the hall quieting as everyone’s eyes turned to their table.</p><p> </p><p>Draco stood off to the side, unable to leave because of Potter’s hand holding onto the edge of his robes, working hard to look completely indifferent.</p><p> </p><p>“Where have you been!” Hermione asked, “Where did you get those clothes? Someone needs to tell the headmaster.” She said over her shoulder, and Finnigan left hastily, presumably in search of Mcgonagall.</p><p> </p><p>“I was with Draco…” Potter said nervously, fidgeting under the attention of so many people, and Hermione and the crowd turned suspicious eyes on Draco. He stared back blankly.</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy what did you—”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve returned your Golden ‘Child’,” Draco cut Weasely off evenly. The Gryffindors crowded closer to Potter—keeping him safe from the Big Bad Death Eater, Draco could have laughed. “Be careful not to lose him again.” Pulling his robe out from Potter’s loosened grip, Draco turned around and made to leave.</p><p> </p><p>Potter stumbled after him, reaching a hand out, but was quickly surrounded by his friends, and Draco left the hall as quickly as he could.</p>
