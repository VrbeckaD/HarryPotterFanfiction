  <em>
    <span>September 1975</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lyra, time to go!” Mum calls out as I hear a crack echo throughout the flat. Probably dad and Julian. My brother was crazy for Hogwarts after last year. The novelty of  going to the school hadn’t worn off yet. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Or maybe it was being so close to the kitchens and getting all the pastries he wanted without mum and dad there to scold him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just a second,” I call out, “I just need to find my transfiguration book.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My sister shakes her head, sighing as she leans against the doorway, laughing at me as I run around our room and look for the stupid book. “I told you to not just leave it laying around yesterday.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I was annotating it!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You were defacing a perfectly good book is what you were doing.” she retorts, “How’s Julian going to use it now?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Julian will be lucky to </span>
  <em>
    <span>pass</span>
  </em>
  <span> transfiguration.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>We both snicker. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lyra!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Still looking!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I crouch down to look under my bed where more than one book had fallen or been kicked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lyra, we’re all waiting on you!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My sister taps my shoulder, leaning in close to my ear and whispering, “I put it in your trunk when you left it on the kitchen table.” running away before I can throw a pillow at her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re awful!” I shout after her as I go and check my trunk. Sure enough it’s there, sandwiched between my other books. I shake my head before locking the trunk back up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ready,” I call down to mum, gripping my trunk as I run down the stairs. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Could’ve just levitated it,” Mira sing songs, with a grin.</span>
  <span> I scowl at her, our parents were pretty much turning a blind eye to her use of underage magic now that she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>nearly</span>
  </em>
  <span> seventeen. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh bugger off!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lyra, don’t talk to your sister like that! Do you have any idea what hex your grandfather would’ve hit us with if he’d heard us saying something like that to one of my sisters?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, grandfather was ten times worse than either of you,” I mutter, “Can we go now?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, now you’re in a rush,” my mother laughs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum...” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, okay,” she says, still smiling, “All my kids are in such a rush to leave.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Only so I can be done with my N.E.W.T.s,” Mira sighs, “Then I’ll never have to study for an exam again.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>Mum shakes her head fondly, outstretching a hand to each of us, “now let’s go,”  as wind comes in from the windows while it’s still warm enough to leave them open. It blows gently on her rich purple robes and inky dark hair, not a white strand</span> <span>in sight even at forty-four. </span></p>
<p>
  <span>I can’t help but smile tenderly at her as I grasp one of her hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a crack we arrive at platform nine and three quarters— the same place we’ve been coming to for the last seven years. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I still feel queasy as my mother grabs my arm and pulls us away so the next family can apparate. “Pay attention, Lyra.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She has a weak stomach, mum,” my sister says. “Well, I’m off to the prefect carriage.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We know you’re head girl,” I mumble, “Grandfather </span>
  <em>
    <span>only</span>
  </em>
  <span> sent you ten galleons.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Smiling beatifically she replies, “Not my fault my hard work’s being recognized.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unable to help myself I retort, “Well you’re certainly full of it today.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>“Stop it both of you. Mira, write. Lyra let’s go find your father and cousins,” mum says with finality</span><span>,</span><span> letting go of my arm only to walk off with a sense of grand purpose, back straight and</span> <span>nose turned up, parting the crowd as she goes. </span></p>
<p><span>I</span> <span>quickly followed, dragging my trunk behind me and already looking for Camellia’s dark blonde hair and Midori’s long bob in the sea of students and families. </span></p>
<p><span>“-And you’ve really got to do well on the O.W.L.s, Lyra so you can have a good pick of careers. And do look after Jane and your brother. I know it’s difficult when they're in different houses</span> <span>, but they’re still so young...” </span></p>
<p><span>“Of course mum,” I sigh before breaking out into a grin at the sight of my cousins and dad in his worn jumper.</span> <span>Aunt Maia was gripping onto my baby cousin Cora who had threatened all summer to sneak onto the train to Hogwarts. My aunt was taking no chances. “But that’s really more of a prefect’s job, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Your sister has enough on her plate with her N.E.W.T.s,” my mother says</span>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Or Caelum,” I giggle, looking over at him before continuing loud enough for everyone to hear, “I mean with those amazing marks...”</span>
</p>
<p><span>“It was only </span><em><span>one</span></em><span> Dreadful and that</span> <span>was potions which I don’t even need for anything,” Caelum says flushing pink and crossing his arms, “And you can’t say anything until you get your results back.”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>I tilt my chin up, “I’m in Ravenclaw. That basically means straight Os”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sure” Caelum sneers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Five galleons I get all Outstandings.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re on.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dad looks over at mum with a sigh, “Please stop your daughter from gambling.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My mother smiles ruefully, “No. It’ll build character. Besides it’s only family.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I see you’re as terrible as ever,” my aunt notes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll give you five galleons if you sneak me on!” Cora says looking over at me and Caelum.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Cora.” Aunt Maia says, not missing a beat. </span>
</p>
<p><span>“Your brother and cousin have already run off with their friends”</span> <span>dad says, quickly changing the subject. “And I’m sure you two are ready to catch up with yours as well,” he says smiling and nudging my elbow. </span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Dad,” I protest weakly, unable to hide my smile at the thought of my friends. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“As long as it’s just friends,” Mum quips, more to dad then me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And we’re leaving,” I tell them, grabbing my trunk and shoving Caelum along. “You’re so lucky you don’t know your dad.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He shrugs nonchalantly, “You’re lucky to have such a caring dad. I mean my mum’s always traveling for work which is cool sometimes. But I don’t know, it would be nice to have a home instead of a string of flats and a mum who’s always off working,” </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span>Caelum trails off as he charms both our trunks onto the train, “Are you going to go sit with Greengrass and Yamamoto?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yup,” I respond, “But don’t tell mum. She’s always weird when I mention Camellia.” </span>
</p>
<p><span>“Well, yeah, have you read</span> <span>about the attacks in the</span> <em><span>Daily Prophet</span></em><span> lately,” he asks solemnly.  “That poor muggleborn family.” He shivers. </span></p>
<p>
  <span>“And what is that supposed to mean, exactly?” I pointedly ask him, Camellia was a lot of things but a bigot wasn’t one of them. I don’t give him time to respond, going off to search the compartments with a quick, “See you later.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>*</span>
</p>
<p><span>“I still can’t believe you cut off all your hair,” I tell Midori, eyeing the soft tufts falling</span> <span>just past her ears, things already splayed out into the space around my bed. </span></p>
<p><span>“My parents nearly lost their minds, but I had</span> <span>found a photo of my grandmother with something like this back when she was young, and knew I wanted it too.” She runs a hand through her hair. </span></p>
<p>
  <span>“My parents would’ve murdered me,” Camellia adds, charming the midnight blue covers into a suitable shade of pale pink. “Almost did this summer when I refused to go on some stupid date with Carrow. Like I’d even want to be in the same room as that twat.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Poor baby,” Midori said with a laugh. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh shut up,” Camellia retorts, “My parents are downright progressive by pureblood standards.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Better wash your hands extra hard after having to room with our dirty dirty impure blood,” Midori snorts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She scowls in response, “You’re one to talk! Your dad’s a politician.” Simmering down she adds jokingly, “and you know what they say about politicians.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Midori grins, “you’ve got me there.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>“Let’s continue this enlightening conversation at breakfast,” I tell them both fondly shoving my books into my bag— an old dragon hide one</span> <span>I’d found while snooping around my grandparents’ house. They always had the most interesting things, the type of old people who didn’t throw anything away if it still worked... just in case.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Nice bag,” Camellia states, following me out of the dorm and down the spiral staircase into the common room, “I begged my parents for this beautiful tote bag with phoenix feathers, but they wouldn’t budge.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Should’ve gone on that date,” Midori says with a smirk. “What class do you have first?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I sigh, “Double Arithmancy with Slytherin, then double Potions with Hufflepuff, and my last class is Charms with Slytherin again. Arithmancy is already bad enough, I don’t see why I got double Potions after that.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>“I don’t start ‘till Potions, but then I have Charms with you and the Slytherins and Astronomy with the Slytherins again. Just in case Mummy decides I should marry a Black after all.”</span> <span>Cam tells us, rolling her eyes. </span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Aren’t they all stuck up and crazy?” I ask, thinking of the dung bombs set off by Sirius Black and James Potter in all the toilets right after last year’s O.W.L.s. And the ever present condescending scowl on Narcissa’s face before she graduated. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, that’s why it’s a maybe,” Cam says softly, smothering a laugh. “How was your break, Lyra? You never did say,” she says linking our arms as we walk.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s because you were busy complaining the whole train ride over,” Midori teases. </span>
</p>
<p><span>I shrug. “It was alright. I went out to stay with my aunt Maia for a bit in York. Julian and Caelum were annoying and Mira had an entirely unfair internship in London. We visited my grandparents and I found this dragon hide bag so there’s that.” All in all, it was a fairly normal and boring summer. Made even more so</span> <span>by the fact that Caelum had left for Morocco and Julian had begged my parents to stay with my aunt and cousin Jane, leaving me home alone.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“You forgot the part where I floo’d out to stay with you for the weekend and we hung out with ghosts in the graveyard and ate way too much ice cream,” Midori adds as we all sit down in the great hall, still half empty at this hour. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Definitely the highlight of my summer</span>
  <span>. I wish you could’ve stayed for longer.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You and me both. I hate all those parties the Ministry throws. I always have to wear the most uncomfortable robes and tr</span>
  <span>uffles are disgusting. I dunno why it has to be served so much.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey,” Camellia protests, nudging Midori’s shoulder, “I went to at least half of those.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you almost made them bearable. Almost.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>*</span>
</p>
<p><span>Arithmancy is </span><em><span>hell</span></em><span> first thing in the morning, and yet Professor Vector is of the strong belief that the earlier, the better. One would think I’d be used to it by now, but one would be wrong;</span> <span>I hate early mornings. Always have, and always will.  </span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Paul,” I said, greeting my long-time Arithmancy seat mate . Midori had dropped it during third year after only a week. “How was break?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not long enough,” he responds with an easy smile, hair intertwined with delicate gold rings, “I’m really starting to second guess my career choice. I mean, there’s plenty to do that doesn’t require Arithmancy.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Like literally anything else,” Maggie says, looking over her shoulder back at us, “other than curse breaker?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Paul chuckles, shaking his head. The wide smile on his lips is infectious, making me smile even though it’s still early enough that the sun hurts my eyes as it streams through the windows. </span>
</p>
<p><span>“Good morning class, “ Professor Vector begins, voice cutting through the morning like a razor</span> <span>and I grab my quill, already starting to feel my hand clamp up.  “I hope you all had a nice break, and also completed the assignment, as that will be all the time we will spend this year on Ancient Far East Numerology systems after we covered the Near East last year. I must of course take a moment to congratulate all of you who decided to stay the course onto O.W.L.s, and despite popular belief, it is within all of your means to receive an Outstanding— provided you rigorously revise and take care not to fall behind.” </span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t forget dropping every subject but yours Professor.” Alecto Carrow called out, smile all teeth as she looked over at the rest of her table, her eyes training on Augustus Rookwood. He cut a handsome figure, all broad shoulders and nut brown hair just long enough to curl behind his ears. He wouldn’t have looked out of place on a roman coin. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rookwood ignored her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As did Professor Vector. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Turn in your scrolls at this time using the Roman Census System on my desk. Any student who fails to do so should stay after class to discuss with me whether or not you have a future in this class.” Her lips flat as she turned to the board to begin the lesson. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But Professor,” Eddy Vance protested from behind me, “We learned that so very long ago.” I smothered a laugh, leaning my head against my hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And I expect you to have retained that information.” She arches one of her thin pencilled in brows. “Now, any other interruptions? Or shall we begin our journey into the Yellow Valley Civilization’s sophisticated numerology system that would later be developed and expanded upon during the successive Chinese Dynasties?”</span>
