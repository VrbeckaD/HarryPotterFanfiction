    <p>Look, there was a chance Harry may have turned out to be somewhat okay in a world where his parents were still happily married, in a world where Harry wasn’t so fucking gay and in a constant fear that either of his parents would loathe him for it, or both even, but that wasn’t this world. Truth was, Harry’s life was a series of roller coasters. Meaning he was completely fine one second and the next, he was like vomiting down the fucking roller coaster ride because he thought it was a rather fine idea to drink himself out beforehand like some fool. To say it backfired on him was an understatement. </p><p>“You are a fucking mess.” Draco Malfoy told him the morning after Harry had drunken himself to the oblivion, feeling quite like he would like to vomit very much right here on the bathroom floor. “I am not even joking when I say this, mate. You are a fucking mess.” </p><p>Harry took another sip of his drink. “Thank you.”</p><p>Draco glared. “It wasn’t a compliment.” </p><p>Harry shrugged his shoulders casually. “I know. But my self esteem is so fucking low that even that sounds like such a compliment compared to what I think of myself.” </p><p>“That’s so fucking pathetic, Potter.” Draco informed him bluntly, gripping his waist to help him to his feet. “Look, mate, as much as I would like to leave you to this emotional hole you stuck yourself in, you are in my house and my family has an important guest coming over this evening. So, unfortunately having my former nemesis in the bathroom while we dine with him is out of a table.” </p><p>“Tom Riddle?” Harry asked as they somehow made it down the stairs of the manor. </p><p>Draco snorted. “As if the Prime Minister would ever come here. In case you have somehow failed to notice, Potter, Riddle doesn’t particularly like my father.” </p><p>“Nobody likes your father.” Harry found the need to point out. “He’s like a fucking Grinch. Always there to ruin people’s fun.” Growing up, Harry was fucking afraid of Draco’s father. That was back when Harry would have gladly set Draco’s shining, fair hair on the fire, but Draco’s father, Harry would have ran from up the bloody hill in a flash. He always looked like he was plotting something malicious and equally dangerous like some comic book villain and he walked around with a fucking cane in his hands. Like who the fuck did that who wasn’t a comic book villain? In fact, he wasn’t completely sure that comic book villains did that. He had never been a huge comic book fan. “So, who’s really coming here?” </p><p>“My cousin Regulus. He’s like, this totally big shot lawyer in France. And father intends to sway him into helping him out with this case he’s trying to build against Dumbledore.” The name sounded vaguely familiar to him for some reason. Draco sighed, shaking his head as he helped him out of the door. “He’s Sirius’s younger brother, but I’ve heard they don’t exactly get along.”</p><p>Ah, that guy. Harry could vaguely remember Sirius going on and on about his perfect, smug ass wealthy lawyer of a brother that his mother preferred so much over him every time he was drunk, which was like, once every few months. </p><p>“Come on, let’s hurry up and escape before either of my parents comes looking for me. Listen, they cannot know I’ve had a party yesterday while they were gone. The last time they’ve found out, they’ve taken my football privileges. I cannot bear to be forced to spend another month without either watching or playing a football.” Draco sounded like the experience had been tremendously traumatizing for him. </p><p>“Hermione would be glad to have you away from a football.” </p><p>“Hermione wants me to spend every minute of my time on trying to help she poor, sheltered orphans that she took a pity on this time.” </p><p>“What was it the last time?” Harry frowned, rocking his head trying to remember as they walked side by side to the bus stop. “Puppies?” </p><p>Draco groaned deeply under his breath. “Don’t even mention puppies. I’ve spend thousands on those bloody puppies.” </p><p>“Maybe next time it would be the immigrants.” </p><p>“Try mentioning immigrants to her, Potter, I would make sure to cut your bloody throat out.” Draco looked as if he would indeed cut Harry’s throat out if he even mentioned those poor immigrants to her. “Look, I am sure that those poor orphans and immigrants are worth saving, but I am <em> tired </em> of having my dates turn into a helping her out with those charity cases she takes herself upon and burning a hole in my bloody wallet because I cannot say no to that face.” </p><p>Harry chuckled, finding all of this incredibly hilarious. “It’s not like you don’t have enough money to pay for all of them.” </p><p>“That’s not the fucking point! The point is, I love that woman like I love breathing this summer air, but I swear if she drags me off to help out another one of her charity cases, I am going insane.” Draco took a deep, long breath. “Anyway, ranting time over. What’s going on with you? Why in the bloody hell did you drink yourself out like that yesterday?” </p><p>Harry took a deep, antagonizing breath before he started to explain, “My dad’s getting married.”</p><p>Draco stared. “So?” He asked. “Your father is marrying. Good for him. It’s not like you ever thought he and your mother were destined to be together.” </p><p>“To Celeste Zabini.” Harry added somehow pointedly. Draco’s gray eyes widened in a surprise and they shifted into a look of pity, his mouth pressed tightly together. “It’s fine. I am fine. It’s not like I am still mooning over Blaise, but I would have liked to have been warned beforehand, you know?” </p><p>“In your father’s defense, Potter, your father isn’t aware you and Blaise used to fuck in boys’ lockrooms like bunnies from a good gay porn movie when you two were at the boarding school.” Draco reminded him. “Or the fact that you swing the opposite way.” </p><p>Harry sighed deeply under his breath, shaking vividly at the thought of having to come out to his parents. “Sometimes I think I can do it — I can tell them that I am a gay. I mean, it’s not like it’s something worth being all stressed over, but then I think of what happened when Percy came out to his mother a few years ago and I just — I can’t do it. It’s just too fucking scary.” </p><p>“Your mother doesn’t have anything in the common with Molly Weasley aside from having a very red hair, but even then, Potter, it’s entirely a different shade of a red.” Draco informed him, a grasp on his shoulder. “Besides, look at how Percy is doing right now. He’s happily married with Oliver. So, even if your mother does run you out of the house, it’s not like you will forever doomed to be unhappy. You will find someone.” </p><p>“I am a fucking mess, Malfoy. You’ve told me so. Who in their right mind would want me?” </p><p>“I didn’t think anyone in their right mind would want Weasley either, but look at him now. He’s happy enough with both Brown and Patil. And if two people were crazy enough to want that ginger weasel, then someone out there would want you too. Someone very gay and masculine looking, that is. We don’t want a repeat of the incident with Ginny Weasley.” </p><p>Harry shivered. No, he definitely didn’t want another straight girl crushing on him this time around. “You know, that’s not very comforting thing to say.” </p><p>“Well, I am not a very nice person.” Draco told him with a teasing smirk. “Come on, get going, mate. I am sure your mother is worrying herself out right now. You did, after all, fail to turn up home yesterday night after you have promised her you would.” </p><p>Immediately, Harry paled. He had forgotten he had promised his mother he would come home yesterday night. “Do you think I can dig up a hole I can hide myself in?” </p><p>Draco rolled his eyes rather dramatically. “Relax, mate. Theodore had called your mother to notify her yesterday night. So, you are safe for now.” </p><p>Harry took a sigh of relief at the rather welcoming news. “Tell Theodore I love him and if he was a gay dude, I would have totally jumped on his bones.” </p><p>“Tell him that yourself. There’s no way I am telling my best friend that.” </p><p>Harry chuckled. “Pray for me, Draco.” </p><p>“I am an atheist, fucker.” </p><p>“Pray for me anyway.” </p><p>Draco gave him a middle finger. “Fuck you, Potter.” </p><p>“Thanks for the proposition, Malfoy, but I don’t make a habit of fucking straight, pale dudes who just happens to be dating my best friend.”</p><p>Draco glared at him. “Fucking hilarious.” He droned. “Go back home.” </p><p>“Promise me you will put my favorite flowers on my grave when my mother murders me.” </p><p>Draco smirked teasingly at him. “I will put daisies on your grave.”</p><p>“Fuck you, Malfoy.” </p><p>“I am sorry, but four-eyed, self hating dudes aren’t my type.” Harry stuck his tongue at him. “What are you, five?” </p><p>“Please, I am an eleven.” </p><p>Rolling his eyes, Draco patted Harry on his shoulder. “I’ll see you tonight at the Inn?” </p><p>“You can count on it.” And boarding the bus with a light chuckle, Harry bid his friend a goodbye with a mock salute. Rolling on his heel playfully, after having paid the bus driver a coin, he fell on a seat at the back of the bus and immediately fell asleep. </p><p>***</p><p>Look, if there was anything Harry really didn’t wish to talk about with his mother right now, it was the fact that his father was getting married to his ex boyfriend’s mother who may or may not murder his father during the wedding night. “Harry, I know these past years since the divorce was difficult on you, but you can’t just keep arriving with an awful hangover at eight in the morning after one party or another. I will no longer tolerate it. So, I’ve come to a decision.” </p><p>“Are you taking Hedwig away?” Harry asked.</p><p>“What?” Lily frowned. “No!” She cried out rather indigenously in the disbelief, “Why would I take your owl away from you? I am not a monster. I know how much that owl means to you, especially with your father gone as often as he is.” </p><p>Truth was, his parents had battled in a court to decide who would get him in the divorce and somehow, despite all of his father’s family connections and money, his mother won the battle in the court. Even now, he didn’t quite know how she had done it. Anyway, it was decided in the court that his father would get to see him once every few weeks, while his mother would get to have him the rest of the time. So, it wasn’t completely his fault that his father was gone as often as he was. It was simply the fault of his mother’s obnoxiously good lawyer. However, it didn’t mean Harry didn’t loathe him sometimes. </p><p>Especially during those times when his father would leave him behind to travel around the world with his friends who also weren’t still over their teenage phrase of having tremendous amount of a good time. <em> James became a father way earlier than he was ready to be one, </em> his mother had told him once. <em> It isn’t even his fault. He loves you, Harry, more than you could possibly imagine he does, but he just wasn’t ready for the responsibilities that having you required at the time. Now, we’re facing the consequences of it. t’s a bitter and hard reality, Harry, but it’s the truth nonetheless.  </em></p><p>“Are you setting me up on a blind date?” </p><p>His mother looked absolutely horrified at the prospect of setting him up on a blind date. “Gods, no! Who you decide to date is entirely your business. I am not a Walburga.” For some reason he couldn’t fathom, his mother always held this deep loathing towards Sirius’s mother. Harry always did wonder what the woman did to piss her off, but he had always been way too anxious to ask. He had a feeling he didn’t really want to know. “I want you to work a part time at the cinema starting from today.” </p><p>“What?” He glared at her with a look of horror. “Why?” </p><p>“If you work a part time at the cinema, you would have a less time getting drunk. You didn’t listen to me when I asked you nicely to stop doing this, Harry. You should have listened. But you’ve left with no other choice, Harry.” She stared at him with a somewhat regretful look on her face. “Your work starts in an hour. You better start moving. You wouldn’t wanna be late on your first day, do you?” </p><p>***</p><p>“So, do you know if Titanic is any good?” </p><p>Growling in the annoyance at the voice, Harry forced himself to act as if he was totally enjoying having to work at the cinema. “It’s Titanic. It’s like, a total classic. People die and shit. What do you expect?” </p><p>“Is that a spoiler?” The annoyingly attractive voice asked. </p><p>“Look, unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last decade, you would totally know Titanic sank because of a fucking iceberg.” He lifted his head to look at him and almost fell over himself due to the shock at how attractive this guy was, feeling a slight lump in his throat at the sight of him. “Were you living under a rock this whole time?” </p><p>The guy chuckled in a completely, obnoxiously attractive way that had his insides twisting in a totally pleasant way that they had absolutely no business doing.</p><p>Right there, Harry decided he hated him. </p><p>“No, but I did live locked up in a mansion full of teachers and servants to keep me in a check the first few years of my life.” Harry arched his eyebrow curiously at him. “My father was overly protective.” </p><p>“Are you expecting me to feel pitiful towards you?” </p><p>The guy grinned. “Maybe.” </p><p>“Well, you’ve come to the wrong person then. Try getting me to feel pitiful to your pathetic ass.” </p><p>“Do you always curse so often?” </p><p>Harry glared. “Do you always feel the need to bother people like this?” </p><p>The guy shrugged. “Well, I am Cedric, in a case you wished to know.” </p><p>Harry glared at the offered hand with a rather unimpressed look on his face. “I didn’t.” </p><p>Quite awkwardly, Cedric pulled his hand back around himself, “Right.” He muttered, smiling pleasantly at him. “I’ll see you later then, Potter?” Again, Harry arched his eyebrows at him in the curiousity. </p><p>Cedric chuckled lightly, pointing at the name tag at his chest. </p><p>Mentally, Harry smacked himself hard in the face. “Right.” He said. “Of course.” </p><p>“Try not to beat yourself around it, H. Potter. It happens.” </p><p>“That’s practically impossible. My automatic response to everything is to blame myself for every little thing I did.” </p><p>Cedric stared at him as if he wasn’t certain if he was joking around or not. “Right.” He said. “Because that’s what normal humans do. Totally.” </p><p>“Who said I am normal?” </p><p>Cedric arched his eyebrow teasingly at him. “Who said you were not?” </p><p>He smirked. “Touchè.” </p><p>“So, am I going to have to guess, or are you going to tell me your name, Herald?” </p><p>He frowned. “Why would anyone name their child a Herald?” </p><p>“I don’t know. Why did your parents name you Herald?” </p><p>He glared. “That isn’t my name?” </p><p>“Hunter?” Cedric suggested. </p><p>“I am not a character in a YA book.” </p><p>“Hamilton?” </p><p>“My mom wasn’t that obsessed with Hamilton when she had me, I am afraid.” </p><p>“Hercules.” </p><p>“Hercules?” Harry repeated indigenously. “That isn’t even the greek version. Honestly, why would anyone name their child Hercules unless they had a Rick Riordan obsession when they had the child.” He sighed deeply, glaring. “My name is Harry.” </p><p>“Harry? Harry.” He tested the name on his tongue. “I like it.” </p><p>“Now, if you are satisfied, can you move on? You are taking the line.” </p><p>“Right.” Cedric sounded apologetic, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly. “I am sorry. I’ve forgotten — anyway, see you around, Harry?” </p><p>“Hopefully not.” Harry growled in the annoyance. Not long after he was gone, Harry realized with a start, there was a piece of a paper with his number on it. <em> Call me, “Herald”, </em> it said. </p><p>
