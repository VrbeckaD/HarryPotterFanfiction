  <span class="s1"> <b>Friday, September 2</b> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>12:37 AM</b> </span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have been at school for literally seven and a half hours and I am already considering fleeing to the Forbidden Forest and living out the rest of the school year out there in a small tent. I will be known for the rest of my days as the Forest Hag. </span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They will say, “Who was the Forest Hag before all this?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They will ponder, “What drove her out into the wilderness with all those dangerous creatures and sometimes Hagrid when he is looking for a new pet?” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">They will worry aloud, “Will that be me one day?”</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">It’s rather a good idea. I shall fade into obscurity. No one, including Eugene Blousepacker, will remember tonight. Which would be a blessed thing.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>12:40 AM</b> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Except maybe they all WILL remember. I think, if I were a bystander at the party, I would certainly remember. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>12:42 AM</b> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">I mean, I still remember when Suzy Carmichael said “orgasm” instead of “organism” during her science presentation in the fifth grade, when I still went to muggle school. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Suzy is probably lying in HER bed right now thinking about it going, “Oh, I’m sure no one will remember the most embarrassing moment of my life.” </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But I remember, Suzy. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I do.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>12:48 AM</b> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">I have decided four very important things:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">I hate the Weasley twins with a fiery passion.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">I think I should get a fringe. I saw it in my sister’s Cosmopolitan magazine over the summer and I think I’d look good.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">I shan’t ever eat anything offered to me by anyone else ever again. I am considering only drinking out of my own hip flask like that weird new professor, Mad-Eye Moody. He may be mad but he’s onto something. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Even though I spent all summer listening to “I Will Always Love You” by Whitney Houston on loop on my cassette player and imagining myself holding hands and kissing Eugene Blousepacker, I cannot ever speak to him again. I am a ruined woman.</span></li>
</ol><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>12:50 AM</b> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Alicia just came into the dormitory. “It wasn’t that bad,” she said. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“It was.”</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“It wasn’t.”</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“It was.”</span></p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Then Angelina burst in and was all, “ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Alicia relented. “It was pretty bad,” she admitted.</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“But it’s reparable!” Angelina said, flopping down onto my bed. “I mean, everyone knows it was the Weasley twins’ fault. They’d been getting people all night with those stupid canary creams. I’m sure Eugene doesn’t think less of you.”</span></p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“But he certainly doesn’t think of me as aloof and alluring anymore.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“That is true.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> <b>1:00 AM</b></p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Angelina offered to duff up the Weasley twins for me, which I thought was very kind of her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>1:30 AM</b> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Fine, I will come out with all the horrifying details, as I have heard purging is the best thing to do with harrowing memories. </span><span class="s1">I can’t sleep anyway. Alicia, Ruby, and Angelina fell straight asleep, because they got to flirt with cute boys all night and drank spiked punch and ate unjinxed custard creams. Chelsea is not back yet— I assume she went off with Lee Jordan somewhere to snog until the sun comes up.</span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So here it is. We threw a big big party to celebrate the first night here— you know, to welcome/frighten the first years and get rowdy together after a summer apart and to remind McGonagall of how much she missed scolding us. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Things got a little out of hand, I suspect because everyone was VERY enthusiastic about having the Triwizard tournament here. Lee invented a drink on the spot called The Dancing Veela and it is definitely responsible for Lavender Brown puking into the fireplace.</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">But anyway. Ahead of time, Alicia and Angelina and I decided that I would be Alluring and Aloof with Eugene. You know, a push and pull sort of thing— Alicia had read it in a book she had swiped from her sister over the summer. It says that in order to attract men you have to be magnetic but not give them all your attention right away. Seeming too eager is the number one way to lose a man’s interest. </span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Angelina wasn’t totally on board with this idea. She said I should just jump on him and give him a good snog. </span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“If I jump him I could very well crush him to death,” I said very reasonably. As the tallest girl in our class I have had to wait for the boys to catch up to me for ages now. Eugene is just now my height and I don’t want to risk it. </span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">(Lee Jordan I swear grew more than ten centimeters and Alicia is almost positive he sipped some Skele-Grow.)</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">So to me, it looked like the stars aligned. Especially since we were dancing to the music and Eugene kind of sidled up next to me. I gave him a flirtatious sidelong glance (that I have been practicing for months for THIS VERY MOMENT) and he smiled back at me. And then as he sort of came closer and in front of me to dance WITH me and I swear to God I could smell him (he smelled very good) and he said to me, “Hey—” </span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">But I didn’t get to hear what he was going to say to me because that’s when I turned into a bloody canary. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I am haunted by those stupid Weasley canary creams. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>2:30 AM</b> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Went downstairs to stare moodily into the fire, except of course Lavender’s puke is still in it. So I just stared moodily at her puke, in the middle of the remnants of the party. </span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">But then FRED WEASLEY HIMSELF appeared, rummaging around the couch cushions for something. </span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“Hey,” he said. </span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“<em>You,</em>” I replied.</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">He put his hands up. “I saw what happened, but I swear I didn’t mean for it to happen.”</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“Of course you did. You jinxed a bunch of custard creams, you git.”</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“I meant I didn’t intend for it to happen while you were having your big moment with Prince Charming.”</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">I think my entire head must have turned red. “He’s not— I mean, I don’t—”</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“Oh come off it, Moretti. Everyone knows you’ve had a crush on Eugene Blousepacker since second year, except maybe Blousepacker himself. Which, by the way, is an <em>awful</em> last name. And first name. It’s simply not moanable. I’m very against your infatuation with him.”</span></p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">“I’m sorry— moanable?”</span> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Precisely. Imagine yourself being in the throes of passion and you had to moan his name. You couldn’t. You’d laugh so hard you’d fall off the bed.”</span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, and I suppose ‘Fred Weasley’ is somehow better?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He smirked. “It sounds just fine, trust me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I rolled my eyes. “Gross. I am going to bed now, and hopefully by morning I can forget this entire conversation happened.”</span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Dream of me?” he called after me.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He is such a prat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>Breakfast</b> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> <span class="s1">Why didn’t I go to bed earlier.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>Herbology</b> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Took a nap during Divination and I feel much better. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Might take another snooze now, as it is quite warm and cozy in the greenhouse and Professor Sprout is talking incessantly about the plants that the North American Iroquois used to treat… either tonsillitis or tinnitus, I wasn’t listening very closely. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s been very taxing dodging Eugene. He and the other seventh year Gryffindors have Herbology before me and I practically broke my ankle trying to hide behind the ferns.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I just realized this is probably why people date people in other Houses. When you break up it’s so much easier to pretend they don’t exist.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>Lunch</b> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The professors this year are quite keen on keeping Fred and George Weasley separated during classes, which is for all our collective safety but it is how I got partnered up with Fred during Herbology and I am rather sore about it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I do USUALLY enjoy the twins’ pranks— bewitching the suits of armor to fart loudly whenever the Slytherins walked by last year was absolute genius. Also George cursed Marcus Flint’s pants to dance uncontrollably (with Marcus still in them) last year and even though Flitwick docked Gryffindor fifty points it was bloody well worth it. We were never close, even though they’re tight with Alicia and Angelina from the team, but we got on fine before.</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But now. Now I have tasted the cruel side of their pranks and I cannot abide.</span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“C’mon love, are you still cross with me?” Fred said as we were supposed to be milking the bovinilium creeping vine. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Obviously.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <b>Dormitories</b> </span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> <b>After dinner</b> </span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Not sure anything in the world is quite as terrible as double Potions. Maybe double Potions with Slytherins, like last year. This year we’re paired up with the Ravenclaws and boy howdy do they not have a sense of humor when it comes to their education. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Our potion today called for “two heaping tablespoons of badger feces” and when I instructed Whitney Donnelly to “scoop that poop” she completely got the hump and then wouldn’t let me stir the concoction widdershins. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She clearly doesn’t think I’m very smart, even though I got an Outstanding in my OWLs for Potions last term. I don’t think Snape can believe it either. I’ve never seen someone more upset to give a student a good grade before. </span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It doesn’t help that I told him Potions made sense because it was a lot like cooking. He was all, “It is NOT like cooking, ten points from Gryffindor because I’m a sulky prat.”</span> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">All I’m saying is that McGonagall and Flitwick were proud of me like normal people. And Whitney and Snape can snuggle up under that wet blanket together.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p>
