          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus Lupin sighed. He'd spent the whole day in the library doing work, so going back into the Common Room to find his friends and most importantly his boyfriend was important right now. He didn't see James or Pete right away, but he did see Sirius. With a sigh, he flopped down on the couch next to him. </p><p>"Hey, I'm hungry."</p><p>Sirius smiled smugly. "...hi hungry, I'm Sirius."</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes. He honestly shouldn't even have been surprised, knowing him. "I'm serious!"</p><p>"No, I'm Sirius!" Sirius pouted. "You're hungry."</p><p>Remus sighed then. He was done with his shit. This close to just getting up and walking away. "...are you fucking serious right now."</p><p>"No," Sirius said again. "I'm fucking Moony~"</p><p>He leaned in and stole a kiss before Remus could get bad and chase him out of the room. </p></div>
