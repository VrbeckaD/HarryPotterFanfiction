    <p>Harry Potter-Kurusu was rather annoyed when he and basically everyone had been teleported into a large room where there were some books just laying in the middle of the room casually but he felt relief when Itsuki Aoi and Akira Kurusu appeared out of nowhere before several more people appeared and landed on the ground rather painfully. Harry exchanged a look with his adoptive brothers Neville Longbottom-Kurusu and Jaden Yuki-Aoi. </p>
<p>"Itsuki!", shouted a man with red hair and red eyes. </p>
<p>"Akira!", shouted a blond boy with brown eyes.</p>
<p>Harry watched as the two ran over to the mountain lions who froze with a deer in the headlights look. The one with the red eyes ran to the silver-grey mountain lion and wrapped his arms around the neck in a hug while the one with the blond hair did the same with the tawny mountain lion. The lion brothers pretty much accepted the hugs before the tawny mountain lion was hugged by more than one person. </p>
<p><u><strong>"worried much?"</strong></u>, asked Harry through the shifter link while Neville glared at everyone else. </p>
<p><u><strong>"shove off! the ones hugging Akira are Ryuji Sakaoto also known as Skull, Yusuke Kitagawa known as Fox, Futaba Sakura known as Oracle, Makoto Niijima known as Queen, Ann Takamaki known as Panther and Haru Okumura known as Noir. the small feline is Morgana known as Mona. You also know Touma</strong>"</u>, explained Itsuki through the link to Harry and Neville. Harry noted that neither of the older brothers struggled against being hugged. </p>
<p><u><strong>"is everyone serious?"</strong></u>, came Jaden's worried voice through the link and Neville walked over to his brother and hugged him while whispering reassurance.</p>
<p>Harry seeing the confused look of everyone else in the room quickly introduced Touma and the others. He also pointed out that it would be best to start reading the books after realizing that all the doors had vanished. Everyone introduced themselves while Harry and Neville worked to convince Touma, Ryuji, Yusuke, Futaba, Makoto, Ann and Haru to let go of the suffocating mountain lions. Touma, Ryuji, Yusuke, Makoto, Ann and Haru did but Futaba refused to let go of Akira who accepted his fate. Harry saw Jesse and Jim with looks of wanting to go over to Jaden who was hiding behind Itsuki.</p>
<p>Sirius quickly picked up the book with the number one on it. Everyone saw the title: <strong>The Adventures of Harry, Jaden and Neville: Philosopher's Stone</strong>. Harry, Neville and Jaden groaned knowing the trouble they had gotten into but other than that stayed silent. Harry laid against the silver-grey mountain lion and nodded for Sirius to read.</p>
