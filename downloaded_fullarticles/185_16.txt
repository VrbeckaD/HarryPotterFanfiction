    <p>Hermione Granger was keenly aware of the unusual silence permeating the New York City street. Her boots clicked sharply on the gray pavement as she made her way through Morningside Heights toward the park with its rocky outcrop. Everyone thinks of New York as the sleepless city, but even in the city’s riotous chaos, there were moments of blissful calm. It was different from London, where the ghosts of war shattered her peace and rattled their proverbial chains in her subconscious mind. She could sleep here amid the neon lights and cab horns, the frenetic pace lulling her senses. </p><p>The war had been over for seven years. She could feel the distance between her memories softening the pain and dulling the razors of "what if". She was living in the present more easily, even if she still woke sweating and scrambling for her wand more often than she would like. Even if the guilt of surviving sometimes drug her into the dark depression that had dealt a death blow to her relationship with Ron --and the string of men that came after him-- she found herself planning her future instead. For years she had thrown herself into her work, her life becoming an endless circuit of work, sleep, fundraise, edit, speak, work, sleep. Then her most ambitious project passed into law. The Daily Prophet headline had opined “Equality Measures Pass!” and had detailed her Magical Creatures Equality Bill. They called her the Gryffindor Lioness (a moniker she privately liked) and lauded her accomplishments adding “We can’t wait to see what she does next”. She smiled and shook hands with all the right people and received numerous accolades. Then she had gone to Harry and Ginny’s house and sobbed on the couch until she fell asleep.  She was 24 and had accomplished more than most people would in a lifetime. Yet, she felt empty and tired. </p><p>Harry had suggested the holiday in America. The Quiddich World Cup was being held in Philadelphia, and he and Ginny were still mad for the sport. She had agreed to an extended holiday with mixed feelings. In the end, she found the distance liberating. Of course, witches and wizards knew who she was here, but they seemed to show less interest.  After a week visiting New York City, she floated the idea of a semi-permanent political liaison appointment between the Magical Congress of the United States of America and the Ministry of Magic. Minister Shacklebolt had not initially been eager to lose his brightest rising star, but eventually acquiesced to a two-year post. Hermione moved into a small magical community that lived alongside muggles with the clever application of illusions and soundproofing charms. She’d been here for a year and found a balance her previous existence had been lacking. She loved it. </p><p>So she found herself clicking her boots down a New York City street at 10 am on a Tuesday morning, heading toward her favorite coffee shop with a book in her bag and song in her head. She found American’s ability to brew a proper cup of tea to be subpar. With coffee, however, they had a decent capability, at least in the smaller shops. Cecilia’s was one of those. The owner and primary barista during the week was Cecilia herself, a small dark woman whose parents were from Senegal. She smiled broadly at Hermione as she strolled through the door. “Bonjour, jolie dévoreur de livres,” her lively alto intoned. “I don’t usually see you on a Tuesday. Playing hooky?” She began making Hermione’s usual.</p><p>“Mon café-poussoir préféré!” Hermione returned the woman’s grin. “Is the garden still open?” She loved coming here, passing a smattering of French, drinking coffee, and reading a book for pleasure. This was a muggle establishment, and therefore she didn’t worry about colleagues and co-workers happening upon her little retreat. </p><p>“Yes, mon ami,” Cecilia paused to pour, “for another few days at least.”  She slid the drink over to Hermione. “You should stick around for lunch hour. Cohen is playing.” She raised a single eyebrow with a mischievous grin. </p><p>“Cohen?” Hermione questioned, picking up the coffee and an apple crumble the older woman laid on the counter. </p><p> “A very talented, very handsome guitarist, who comes in now and then to play for my lunch caffeine addicts.” Nodding at the door to the garden. “I know you like a good musician,” she winked at the curly-haired girl with affection, “He’s a Brit, too. Pretty little posh accent and all.” </p><p>“I don’t usually like the posh ones, Ces,” Hermione laughed and quickly walked through the door and settled into the garden. </p><p>When she came back to reality, the better part of three hours had passed. Her cup was empty and her stomach reminded her an apple crumble did not constitute a proper meal. She was no longer alone in the little garden either and the door to the cafe proper had been wedged open to the temperate fall weather. Lovely guitar music wafted out the main room as she wove her way back to the counter. The line was three deep already, but Cecila worked quickly. Hermione didn’t really want to move from her little sanctuary so she contented herself to wait and listen to the truly talented guitarist. Her eyes cast about for the music’s source and found it just passed the counter. </p><p>His back was to her, but she could see that he was tall and leanly muscled. He wore his burnished blond hair very short on the sides, but a little longer on the top with a slight curl. The witch watched the muscles of the man’s arms flex as he bent over his acoustic guitar in concentration. Privately, Hermione upgraded Cecilia’s taste in men. He was certainly fit and talented. Though, she might reserve final judgment until she had a full picture. As it was, she could only see a vague profile of strong jaw and rather pointed nose. Something nagged at her memory but she couldn’t match it with anything. </p><p>By the time she reached the counter for her order, Cecilia smirked at her and mouthed Told you. She rolled her eyes at the bright-eyed barista. “I’ll have another, and a ham and swiss sandwich on rye,” the guitarist fumbled several notes for the first time since she had started listening. She cut her eyes toward him just in time to catch him turning away, his back suddenly stiff. There was a dark tattoo on the man’s left forearm partially obscured by the neck of the guitar. Again, an unpleasant sense of dé ja vú nagged at her and she narrowed her eyes at him. Something was very odd. </p><p>*******************************<br/>
Draco Malfoy stifled a swear when he heard a voice straight from a part of his life he had left on another continent. He glanced over his shoulder to Cecilia and saw her. Hermione Granger. Her hair was shorter but still riotously curly. Her eyes still held depths of intelligence in their coffee-colored orbs. His fingers disconnected from his brain for a couple of beats. She was still a striking woman. </p><p>The part of him that still carried a schoolboy’s crush on her danced a little jig, but the rest of this being rejected her presence entirely. In the last year of the war, he and his mother had defected. They worked with the Order of the Phoenix to bring down the Dark Lord. He had only worked with her a handful of times, but he had eyes to see and ears to hear. She was as beautiful as she was intelligent, and she was pretty damn swotty. The tensions were still there. The weight of the previous six years and a lifetime of indoctrination hadn’t made their interactions easy. However, she’d willingly worked with them, risked her life with him multiple times. At his trial (because, *yes*, there was still a trial), she and Potter had testified for him.</p><p>But he had a life here, now, and she wasn’t part of it. Draco had chosen to serve out his probation here in New York, as far away from the sanctimonious gaze of Wizarding London as he could flee. He acknowledged that he deserved their judgment on some level, but he could feel himself sinking to meet those expectations. It was incredible how many witches and wizards seem to have a perfect memory of his deeds at Hogwarts, yet never once stood against the Evil Bastard himself. It was easier to stand in judgment now that they had come out of hiding to take their “proper places” in “polite society”. He couldn’t be involved in any of his remaining familial estate businesses for fear of complete financial collapse when honorable wizards withdrew their patronage. Of course, as long as he was invisible, they seemed more than willing to give the Malfoy interests as much business as they could handle. </p><p>Draco had lived an indolent lifestyle at his French estate for precisely one month before Theodore Nott had staged an intervention. “You are not cut out for this, mate. You don’t have my talent.” He was right, of course. Theo was impervious to the barbs flying at him. Draco just wasn’t. He slipped easily into impetuosity, rage, and idleness. The mask of haughty indifference that he had worn so easily before the war became impossible to hold. So he applied to finish his probation in America. The Ministry had allowed it due to his valorous service. There were conditions of course, but he took them in stride. He’d been living in Manhattan for 5 years now. He liked his life, he liked his friends, he loved his music. </p><p>Now, she was here--Hermione Granger. She could ruin everything. She was not a witch with which one should trifle. Draco had no doubt she could make his life far more complicated. She would almost certainly jeopardize his anonymity. Maybe, she would understand. He didn’t really want to take the chance. He did the best thing he could which was to play his set and plot to get the Hell out before she noticed him. Of course, the Fates were not in his favor. He felt an intense gaze settle on him for the next several songs. He refused to look up for he knew two dark, inquisitive eyes would be waiting. </p><p>*******************</p><p>Hermione scarcely believed her eyes. Draco Malfoy sat cradling an acoustic guitar, playing beautifully, in a coffee shop in upper Manhattan. A muggle coffee shop. His aristocratic face focused intensely downward, silver-gray eyes gazing at the floor, mouth pressed into a thin line. His long capable fingers spidered up and down the graceful neck of the guitar with confidence and flair. She noticed multiple sets of eyes staring with more-than-passing interest at the man. The incongruence of it all gave her a giddy hit of confusion. She sat at a nearby table watching and eating her sandwich. She remembered his defection during the war. She’d been stuck between dubious and delighted. The tall wizard wasn’t without talent, but dealing with him was difficult. Few people really trusted him. She had taken several missions with him simply because no one else would. Draco had been a special target for the Death Eaters since he was the highest form of a traitor, a blood-traitor who had been *gifted* with the Dark Mark. It was a high honor in such circles, and he had betrayed it. To make matters worse, he brought several tactical secrets with him when he defected. He had been skilled, efficient, and coldly distant. Hermione’s memories of the war were always faded around the edges and tinged with a grey-green color -- distorted and wrong. She couldn’t remember having more than short civil conversations with him, even on those terrifying missions. </p><p>Had he always played the guitar? Why was he in New York? Why was he here in her favorite hideaway? What in Godrick’s name was going on? When the blond wizard stopped playing, he raised his head and looked directly at Hermione, lips turned downward slightly. She noticed he was dressed in well-fitted jeans and a graphic t-shirt with "Chasing Dawn" emblazoned on it. He looked like he belonged here. He also looked annoyed that she dared to be in his presence. He could definitely pull that air of arrogance around him as easily as he had at school. Fortunately, she wasn’t a twelve-year-old girl anymore. She would not be easily quelled. His annoyed look broke into a vague sense of worry, and he cast his eyes away from her while he gathered up his things. </p><p>She thought for a moment that he would slip out and avoid her altogether, but several minutes later, he dropped into the seat opposite her own. He managed to make the move look both graceful and nonchalant. “Granger,” he rumbled. He had a much more pleasant voice than she remembered, or maybe he just wasn’t snarling at her. </p><p>“Draco? Or Cohen, I guess?” The wizard across from her flashed her a disarming smile. Hermione couldn’t have been more surprised if the sky had turned pink and the birds started tap dancing. Draco Malfoy had smiled at her -- and he had a nice smile.</p><p>“Either is fine, but you try telling no-majs your name is Draco,” he shrugged. “My roommate misheard me… and well… Coe turned into Cohen.” </p><p>“Wait,” she squinted at him, “you have a roommate? *You* have a muggle roommate? What is going on, Malfoy?” She didn’t miss the way his mouth twisted slightly at the use of his surname. Her awareness of the exposed situation snapped into place, suddenly. She was about to reach for her wand to subtly cast a muffliato when she found it had already been done. “And when did you cast this?” </p><p>“Wow, Granger,” there was that smile again, “you’ve lost a little of your edge.” He stretched his legs out in front of him. “I cast it after I sat down.” </p><p>“Wandless and wordless?” She gave him a look of approval when he nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Well you can’t go waving wands and chanting spells in front of no-majs,” he said but flushed a little at her compliment. “Besides, it’s a very basic spell,” he looked around, “and important to know.”</p><p>“How did you learn to play?” She gestured at his guitar. For a moment he looked a little startled at the question.</p><p>“Oh, uh, my mother wanted me to learn to play the piano,” he sighed at the memory. “I agreed on the condition that I also learn guitar.” He gave a low chuckle. “I’m still awful playing the piano, but…” he caressed the guitar case, “playing guitar has always been…” he searched for a word.</p><p>“A sanctuary?” She suggested. His striking eyes found hers with a hint of surprise, and he nodded. </p><p>“That’s an excellent description,” the ghost of the easy smile hung around the corners of his mouth, but care lines emerged around his eyes as he dared to hold her stare. </p><p>“So,” she tried to give a relaxed, conversational tone to her words as she broke eye contact, but as usual they came out a little stilted, “why are you in New York? How is the great Malfoy Estate ticking along without you?” </p><p>The twitch in his jaw was almost imperceptible, but Hermione saw it. “My family’s lawyers and brokers do a better job without me there.”  He sighed, relaxing his shoulders a bit. “I wasn’t exactly helping our reputation. A Death Eater son of a Death Eater,” he briefly glanced down at his left arm which he kept conspicuously under the table. “Not exactly a brilliant business plan. Or even a trust fund, really. My mother keeps up the house and donates egregious sums of money to any charity she can. She usually has to do so anonymously, so the fools will actually take it.” The fingers of his right hand gripped his leg aggressively but he was otherwise relaxed. </p><p>Hermione scrunched her nose. “You came round to the right side though,” her voice confused. “You fought with us for almost a year before the final battle.” </p><p>“Yes. Proudly,” his face took on an earnestness to which she was not accustomed. “But I won’t tell you that wasn’t the hardest thing I had ever done.” He studied the pattern of his coffee cup. “Most people in magic circles believe that I was an opportunist and switched sides when the tide began to turn.“</p><p>“What? That’s patently untrue and unfair,” she felt her face flush with anger. “Bloody fucking cowards with partial truths and vindictive spirits.” </p><p>He leaned back in his seat and laughed in a bright baritone. It caught Hermione so unaware that she nearly tipped her empty coffee cup of the table. “The Golden Girl of Griffyndor is defending me, Slytherine’s fallen prince? With unseemly language, no less!” He shook his head, his smile never fading. “Will wonders never cease?” He paused, giving her a long look growing serious, “But, Granger, a partial truth is still a truth, no? The evidence is written on my body as surely as my legacy is written on my face. I’m Lucius Malfoy’s son. I took the Dark Mark willingly. I failed to protect people I should have protected. I followed my father into the service of a terrifying psychopath because I believed I was better. I deserve a little judgment.”</p><p>It took Hermione a few minutes to absorb his little speech. When she gathered her thoughts she realized, several seconds had passed while she stared at him. She shook her head again. “It isn’t right,” she cast her eyes down. “I know what you, your mother, and Theo did was intensely dangerous and brave.” She pushed her cup away, “But I am well aware that there is no such thing as fair in love, money, and politics. So, why not London?” </p><p>“London was… not good for me. Neither was home,” he shifted uncomfortably. “I requested permission to serve out my probation here.” She cut him off abruptly. </p><p>“You had probation?” outrage written loudly on her face. </p><p>“Yes, I had 2 years of probation,” he sighed. “How did you not know that? You testified for me.” </p><p>She bit her bottom lip, loathed to admit the truth, “I rather forgot about the results of your trial. I assumed you would be cleared of all charges.” She shuffled her feet, “It was a busy time. I must have given a deposition in a dozen trials over that week.” </p><p>He smiled gently at her. This was becoming increasingly baffling. Was Draco Malfoy trying to assuage her guilt? Did she have guilt over what happened to him? “They couldn’t have cleared all charges when I admitted to at least half of those on record. They gave me the most lenient sentence that would have been acceptable to the general public. So why are you here, Granger? I’d have thought you’d be climbing that Ministry chain of command.” </p><p>She thought for several beats then smiled with a touch of sadness. “Home was not good for me either.” She fidgeted with her sleeves. “It was just too much. I needed to get out for a while and find my own space.” </p><p>He caught her eyes again with a wry smile, “A sanctuary of sorts?” She couldn’t help the smile that relieved the tension between them.</p><p>“This suits you, Draco,” she said. Glancing around the shop and then at him. “You seem happy here.” </p><p>“Thanks,” he flushed again and something about the color on his pale checks accentuated his eyes. Oh no, she refused to acknowledge her attraction to him, but that was getting harder with every passing moment. “It suits you, too.” He cocked his head to the side considering, then asked, “My band is playing this Friday in Brooklyn. Would you like to come?” </p><p>“Band? Brooklyn?” She could hear herself sputtering. He laughed again and her knees sort of wobbled. She was glad she wasn’t standing.  </p><p>“Yes, my band. We are called 'Facing Dawn'.” She knew she was meant to respond but she simply sat agog. “Brooklyn is a borough of New York City…New York is the city in which you currently reside...” </p><p>“Oh, umm, sure. That sounds great!” She silently berated herself for gaping like a fish. “What’s the venue? How many galleons are the tickets? Is there a direct Floo?” He cut her off with a polite hand gesture. </p><p>“You know, you are kind of adorable when you are flustered,” I’m sorry, what now? Her inner thoughts struggled to incorporate what was happening. “It’s at a place called Silent Barn.” He smirked at her. Oh, there was the Draco she remembered. “Anyone who has bled with me in a war doesn’t need tickets,” he wrote an address down on a small piece of paper that hadn’t been there before. “This is the address, but I’m afraid you’ll have to come by mundane means. This is a no-maj place and all my bandmates are non-magical as well.” He glanced up at the clock. “I need to go, Granger. My cell number is on the front of the card. Text is best, but call if you must.” </p><p>He gathered up his cup and hers and put them in the dirty dish bin before grabbing his guitar and heading toward the door. Before he got all the way out the door she finally blurted, “You have a cellphone?”</p><p>That baritone laugh caressed her again as he looked over his shoulder and said “Adorable.” </p><p>****************************************<br/>
Draco walked down the busy early afternoon street with his guitar strapped across his shoulder. He reflected on the conversation with the brilliant witch in the cafe. He shouldn’t have taken the bait. He should have walked out the door. She had made no move to approach him. But her toffee eyes had been dissecting him for twenty minutes. Well, he wasn’t some insecure little boy with honor to uphold anymore. If she was going to stare at him, he was going to bloody well stare back. That had been his first mistake. Gods she was intimidating with her calculating gaze and perfectly set mouth. He knew from experience just how deadly she could be. Now, he needed to go make nice so she wouldn’t make his whereabouts public knowledge. </p><p>Then she had been perfectly, maddeningly reasonable. She had even called him by his first name. He’d glossed over several questions, but he knew that she had taken note of that. He didn’t doubt if he ever saw her again she would be following up on those. Therefore the wisest course of action would have been to never see her again. So, why had he invited her to Silent Barn? He didn’t belong anywhere near the sanctified Hermione Granger. She was as ferocious as she was adorable, and she had understood how he felt about music in two sentences. She had defended him without a second thought and had done so earnestly. But mostly he was a sucker for her brief astonished laugh and her open smile. He could practically hear his father in his head. "Draco, you know there is only one thing that comes from getting distracted by a pretty face." He sighed as he mentally finished his father’s lesson. "Trouble." </p><p>He shook his head as he used his subtly charmed key to unlock his door. A text buzzed in his jacket pocket from an unfamiliar number. </p><p>	“I literally had to get a neighbor’s small child to teach me how to send this message. So hello. This is my number. I don’t use this device much. -H” </p><p>	He huffed a laugh, fingers flying over the keypad. “There is a sweet irony in there somewhere. You might want to learn if you want to blend in here -D” </p><p>	He made it to the top of the stairs before his phone buzzed a second time. “So noted. With whom am I blending? I’ve never been particularly good at that. I haven’t forgotten that you left certain questions unanswered regarding roommates, etc. - H” </p><p>         “If you can use discretion, I’ll buy you a coffee on Thursday at lunch. Come with your questions, but try not to write a dissertation? - D” </p><p>         “I can do discretion. Lunch on Thursday at Cecilia’s. No promises on the dissertation though. - H” </p><p>         “A Griffyndor with the power of discretion? Shall I bring the Sorting Hat for a second go? -D”</p><p>         “Careful of glasshouses, Slytherin. - H” </p><p>A smile played at the corners of his mouth and a fluttering sensation blossomed in the pit of his stomach. What the hell had Lucius Malfoy ever been right about anyway?</p>
