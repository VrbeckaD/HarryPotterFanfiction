          <div class="userstuff"><p>“It will only be for two weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A month, at most,” my boss, Kingsley Shacklebolt, promised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, he’s not just my boss - leader of the whole Ministry now, isn’t he?</p><p> </p><p>Just how do you say no to the Minister of Magic, who still comes to Sunday brunch at your parent’s house at least once a month?</p><p> </p><p>You don’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I didn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I also didn’t accept my fate graciously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You can’t be serious,” I whined petulantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum would have so proud of her twenty year old Junior Auror son acting like a toddler.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Ron,” he said, not actually sounding sorry at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What he really seemed was distracted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Maybe it will work out better than you think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of the others have complained.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His focus was already redirected to the stacks of paperwork on the desk in front of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I waited for a moment longer, hoping for a reprieve. Or a miracle. Anything to get me out of this nightmarish situation.</p><p> </p><p>He never looked back up, so I considered my self dismissed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah right,” I muttered darkly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not bloody likely.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>None of the others had complained, because none of them had to live with Draco sodding Malfoy for two weeks.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>I hadn’t seen or wondered about Draco Malfoy in years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over two years, to be exact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since the war ended, and he was sent to Azkaban after his Wizengamot trial.</p><p> </p><p>Having him dumped back into my life was less than ideal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For starters, I hate the git.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hated the git?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you still actively hate someone who you haven’t spared a second thought for?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever, he was a giant arsehole at Hogwarts, and I couldn’t imagine he’d changed too much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I’m a Junior Auror, working long, erratic hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How the hell was I supposed to babysit Malfoy and still do my job properly?</p><p> </p><p>I knew that Azkaban was overcrowded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d experienced it first hand: witnessed the suffocating horror, felt the despair and hopelessness, smelled the stench of human agony and suffering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just didn’t understand what that had to do with Malfoy. How would things be different, in a couple of weeks?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Merlin, it better be a couple of weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it was a month, I’d...I’d...it was too horrible to contemplate.</p><p> </p><p>Lucky me, I get to go to that cesspool of misery tomorrow to pick up Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Last time I was there, I vomited all over my shoes, while my Senior Auror partner rolled his eyes and complained to the Warden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I’m fortunate, I won’t toss my biscuits in front of my childhood enemy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Kingsley gave me a file to read.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had <b>DRACO L. MALFOY</b> written out in huge, bold letters, with his prisoner number<b> §¥741</b> just below.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under that was the mugshot. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The very first mugshot I had seen, or at least been remotely interested in, was that of Sirius Black.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each year at Hogwarts brought its own special set of challenges, and in third year, it was the maddened face of a mass murderer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy’s mugshot was nothing like Sirius’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy sat composed, facing the camera but not making eye contact, his gaze just slightly off to the right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If it wasn’t for a blink and a swallow, I would be tempted to say it was a muggle photo, he remained so still.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a way, he did remind me of Sirius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was one picture Harry had, of a young, school-aged Sirius, where his godfather was looking straight at the camera, intensely focused, all piercing stormy grey gaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just when you think you should look away, that you are intruding on a moment so intimate, so personal, that it wasn’t meant to be seen by other eyes, Sirius broke into a wide, sparkling smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the scene ended, Sirius mouthed something at the camera.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Moony.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry figured that out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius was looking at Lupin with that burning hooded gaze.</p><p> </p><p>Both Malfoy and Sirius possessed the same easy confidence of people who were self-assured in their appearance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like it’s their due to be sitting in front of the camera.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They didn’t have to work at the perfect pose, it was already naturally there, in the tilt of the chin and the set of the lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Inborn beauty, wielded at the world like a weapon, without either of them realizing it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or perhaps they did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were both Blacks, after all.</p><p> </p><p>That was as far as I got in Malfoy’s file.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The front cover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It remained unopened, thrown half-heartedly on my kitchen table on top of a pile of Quibblers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What did I need to read it for, anyway?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knew what he did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Moving past the war was hard enough, no need to open up old wounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It might actually make it harder, to have the man in my house, if I perused his crimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Best to leave it then.</p><p> </p><p>Still, as I left for Azkaban, I took one last fleeting look at the mugshot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It could have been my imagination, but I thought I detected something besides fear in Malfoy’s eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t cowardice, or dread, or even disdain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, what I thought I saw was something much more interesting; it was shame. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Ludicrous, I know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Malfoy, actually feeling penitent?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unheard of.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone raised by Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Black surely hadn’t even been taught the word.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having a conscience didn’t have a place in that family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet, despite seven years of personal evidence to the contrary, I clung to the notion that Malfoy might have a glimmer of softness among his sharp edges and prickly angles.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>I didn’t vomit at Azkaban, but it was a near miss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck.</p><p> </p><p>I don’t know what I expected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Malfoy from the mugshot?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A pretty blond boy, smirking and sneering and calling me Weasel?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Spitting insults and threats?</p><p> </p><p>What I got was much worse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So so much worse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would take a thousand eternities of Draco Malfoy’s bullying in exchange for the memory of that morning, in Azkaban, and after.</p><p> </p><p>Two guards hauled in a scrawny prisoner, supported under each arm, feet dragging on the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was filthy and stunk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wondered what the hold up was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why weren’t they bringing Malfoy out?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was this prisoner also being released to Auror care?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then one of the guards propped the man against a wall, and wrenched his face up in my direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“See that lovely Auror over there?” the guard asked icily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’s your new master, for however much time you have left.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don’t fuck it up.”</p><p> </p><p>Recognition hit, and I couldn’t look away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted to. Merlin, did I want to.</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy was, for lack of a better term, wrecked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His body was in absolute wretched condition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His blond hair was so matted and soiled, it was unrecognizable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sores covered his body, marring the exposed skin on his arms and legs where the prison rags left him bare and unprotected from the elements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy picked absentmindedly at a particularly large spot on his left inner forearm, digging deep with his fingernails until he made it weep and drip blood down his arm, onto his wrist and to the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What shocked me most was his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now the Black family resemblance was clear, as this version of Draco Malfoy mirrored the famous Sirius Black wanted poster.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cheeks so hollow and sharp they could cut glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eyes sunken, rimmed with dark purple bruises.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lips cracked and peeling, oozing blood from one corner of his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when I swallowed back the bile pushing its way up my throat.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy opened his mouth, but no sound came out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He earned a swift swat to the back of his head for his trouble.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t speak unless spoken to,” one of the guards threatened.</p><p> </p><p>The other turned to me, and said, “we’ll need to get him ready for your place.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gestured to an area in the corner of the room, where I could see chains hanging from the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’ll get a shower with the hose, a quick treatment for parasites, and you’ll be on your way in no time.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He leered at me, and wiggled his eyebrows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You can stay and watch, if you like.”</p><p> </p><p>They began to roughly undress Malfoy, starting by hauling his arms up over his head to remove his shirt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wait!” I cried loudly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn’t sure I could handle seeing more of Malfoy’s emaciated body right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The guards looked at me, boredom and resentment filling their eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I stalled for time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What’s that, around his neck?”</p><p> </p><p>I’ve said a lot of stupid things in my lifetime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve had the disappointed gaze of Molly Weasley, Professor McGonagall, and Hermione Granger directed my way, so I’m not easy to fluster.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you an Auror or ain’t ya?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both guards crossed their arms over their chests and studied me hostilely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy, now totally unsupported, slid down the wall a foot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s the collar. Keeps the prisoners from using wandless magic, now that the Dementors have fucked off.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Yeah, I probably should have known that, but I did my best to avoid visiting Azkaban.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Looks different than the last one I saw.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They exchanged glances, but didn’t call me out on the obvious lie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m kinda in a rush here, let’s skip the...uh...cleaning part.”</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever you say, less work for us,” the guard closest to me shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Although, I wouldn’t mind one last look at that arse.”</p><p> </p><p>No.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just....no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t want to see Malfoy’s naked arse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not happening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry, no time,” I blustered, rushing forward towards Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been staring at me all the while, but I couldn’t read his expression.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I got close to him, though, he flinched, and slid down the wall even further, finally dropping his head.</p><p> </p><p>I put out a hand, and asked gently “can you walk?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy pondered my hand for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nodded, and allowed me to pull him to his feet and support him out of the room.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as we got to the gates, he collapsed, crumbling bonelessly inward at my feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I stood there a beat too long, staring down at him, wondering what the bloody fuck I should do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I heard the faintest “sorry” mumbled from the ground.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be,” I replied in what I meant to be a soothing voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It came out sort of rough and sharp, and he folded in on himself even more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can you walk?” I repeated, but he didn’t need to answer this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>There was only one thing for it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I picked him up, bridal style.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He seemed taller than I remembered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not quite my height, but definitely taller than Harry by almost a head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet he weighed practically nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Around 9 stone, if I had to guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Less than Hermione or Ginny.</p><p> </p><p>I was overwhelmed by a sense of déjà vu.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The skinny frame, ill-fitting clothes, tired, tortured expression; I’d seen it all before, on Harry, in the summer before second year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When his family had starved him, and locked him up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like a prisoner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d never fully realized just how awful and abusive they were at the time, but it hit me like a punch to the face now.</p><p> </p><p>The last thing I needed to do was keep comparing Draco Malfoy to people I cared about, like Sirius and Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He might have been broken now, but I couldn’t let my guard down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘Constant Vigilance,’ and all that rot.</p><p> </p><p>At least I had one question answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever I felt for Malfoy, it certainly wasn’t hatred.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Harry was the best mate a bloke could have, and so, without being asked, he was waiting at my place when we returned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took one look at the pitiful grey bundle in my arms and blanched away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is that...oh my god, Ron, is that...”. Yeah, I know exactly how you feel, mate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Words couldn’t describe it.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s passed out,” I explained, although that part was obvious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy’s head lolled drunkenly against my chest, his mouth agape.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Drool mixed with the blood in the corner of his mouth, trickling down his chin and onto my robes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had the strangest urge to wipe it off with my sleeve, like a parent might do, but held back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you think you could run a bath?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah, of course,” Harry said mechanically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Merlin, this was probably stirring up memories of Sirius, his gaunt form subsisting on rats just to stay close to his godson, to keep him safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry’s last shot at a family of his own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, he’d always be a Weasley, he knew that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But what he had stolen from him when Sirius died - I think a part of Harry permanently broke that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one had lost more than Harry.</p><p> </p><p>I directed him to add a few different healing Potions, which I hoped would help with Malfoy’s sores, and whatever injuries he had lurking under his rags that I couldn’t see.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I told him to go home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Give Ginny a big hug for me,” I said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll see you both soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thank you, Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>He watched as I gingerly lowered Malfoy unto the toilet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll help in any way I can,” he promised, and promptly left the bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was grateful. I didn’t want an audience for what was coming next. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I was still supporting Malfoy by the shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How was he sleeping through all of this?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Malfoy,” I said quietly as I squeezed one shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I expected it would take a few tries to rouse him, but he jolted awake, head whipping back and forth in a blur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s me, Ron Weasley,” I said in my ‘Auror’ voice, which consisted of equal parts firmness and compassion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Er...at my place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve got a bath ready for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy remained tense under my hands, but stopped flailing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nodded once, and made to start removing his clothes. In his weakened state, even this proved too difficult.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Here,” I said, pointing my wand at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He flinched again, but I kept going.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no way I was undressing Malfoy with my own hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Depulso.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy’s filthy rags were instantly banished, hopefully never to be seen again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you need help...getting in?”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy shook his head, and said croakily, “no, I’ll manage.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the first time I heard him speak, besides that whispered “sorry” outside of Azkaban, which could have been my mind playing tricks on me.</p><p> </p><p>“Right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ok, well...I’ll...er...” I was so flustered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn’t used to having house guests, and certainly not naked male ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There are towels above the toilet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll leave some clean clothes outside the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just...holler if you need help, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>I got a nod for an answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe that’s how it would be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d make awkward statements, and Malfoy would nod or shake his head as he saw fit, and we would survive these two weeks without total carnage.</p><p> </p><p>As I closed the door, I heard it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A faint “thank you”, spoken from lips that weren’t used to saying the words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I almost ignored him. I didn’t want to get in any deeper with Malfoy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome,” I whispered, as the door clicked shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t even know if he heard me.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy sat on my favourite chair in the living room, one ankle crossed regally over his knee, a book clasped in his hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was just the slightest hint of a tremor in the long, pale fingers, and only if you were really looking for it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I couldn’t get over the vast improvement in his appearance already.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just over an hour ago, I had gone upstairs after hearing a strange noise, to find Malfoy dripping wet and clutching the bathroom door jam, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet and muttering under his breath. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Now, dressed in a pair of Ginny’s old joggers and a shrunken Cannon’s t-shirt, he looked almost normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not Draco Malfoy normal, but human being normal, at least. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I didn’t know what the fuck to do with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was I expected to provide him company?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make polite, stilted conversation?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or could I shove him in the spare bedroom, and order him to stay there until told otherwise?</p><p> </p><p>In the end, I fed him some of my Mum’s soup, of which he ate a disturbingly small quantity, then gave him a book.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He stared at the cover for a few minutes before flipping it over multiple times and finally cracking it open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been holding it for over a quarter hour, and I hadn’t seen him turn a page.</p><p> </p><p>As for me, I’d been not-so-subtly watching him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The joggers were much too short, but at least they fit in the waist, unlike my trousers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A scandalous amount of delicate ankle bone was showing on the leg Malfoy had propped up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy had always been more of a slight, lean build, but now the bones in his wrists and ankles were so prominent, I was worried they would rip through his translucent skin when he moved. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>They were a haunting vision burned into my mind, those frail, breakable wrists and ankles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had the strangest desire to wrap my fingers around his wrists, to put a physical feeling on his immense vulnerability.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe run a thumb over the protruding bone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sick, I was sick!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hadn’t helping him walk, and eventually having to carry him, been enough?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was I really so keen on seeing my adversary brought even lower? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Or was is something more... something deeper, darker, that made my heart start to race just staring at Malfoy’s crossed foot?</p><p> </p><p>“What are you going to do while I’m at work tomorrow?” I blurted out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I needed something different to fixate on.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy remained focused on the book, but the shaking of his hands increased.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What would you like me to do?” he asked in a froggy whisper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was such a pitiful sound that I sort of missed his trademark cultured Malfoy drawl.</p><p> </p><p>“Just...make yourself at home, I guess,” I said casually, and shrugged my shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He missed the gesture entirely, still avidly staring at the book he wasn’t actually reading.</p><p> </p><p>He said something under his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t hear you.”</p><p> </p><p>In a slightly louder voice, still just barely audible, “I’m your prisoner.”</p><p> </p><p>And something clicked, at those hushed words uttered from swollen, cracked lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy was scared of me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the first time in my life, I, Ronald Weasley, had power over the life of Draco Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could do whatever I wanted with him, and no one would bat an eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The proof sat right in front of me, in the misused, haggard form of a once beautiful boy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>My gut turned at the very thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was this why Malfoy was here, at my house?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had someone said, “oh, place him with Weasley, they hated each other as boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ron will keep the git in line.”?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck, I hoped not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I truly, sincerely hoped no one thought me capable of such brutality. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I really needed to read that file of Malfoy’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Look Malfoy,” I sighed, rubbing my face, “this situation isn’t ideal for me, but I’m not going to hurt you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can do whatever you want.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eat, sleep, read, watch the telly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t care.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, he glanced up, and for a split second, it felt like a win.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I saw the look in his eyes, and I knew he didn’t believe a word.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was still terrified, but in a resigned way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was just waiting for things to get bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Would you like me to show you to your room?”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t want me to sleep with you?” he questioned, and promptly blushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The flush gave an illusion of healthiness to his pallid complexion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I meant, in your room, so you can keep an eye on me?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was told I’d be sleeping on the floor at the foot of your bed.”</p><p> </p><p><em>By who</em>?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted to scream.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who the fuck would tell him that?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who the fuck would expect that of me?</p><p> </p><p>I took a deep breath, to calm myself, before answering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, Malfoy, I don’t want you to sleep on the floor by my bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Merlin!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ok, so the deep breath maybe didn’t help calm me down too much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy reacted poorly to my increased temper, the shaking in his hands spreading to his entire body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry,” I said, holding my hands up in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Let’s just get you to bed, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>He nodded, the clean but still matted strands of his hair falling into his eyes and shielding his expression from view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After a couple of attempts to push himself out of the chair, I moved in front of him and offered my hand again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took it quicker this time, but still tried to drop it as soon as he stood.</p><p> </p><p>He stumbled once, climbing the stairs, and I reached out to steady him.</p><p> </p><p>That was my excuse, anyway, for why my hand found its way around one fragile wrist, keeping contact until Malfoy was sitting stiffly on my guest bed.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll bring home some hair Potion tomorrow,” I promised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“See if we can get those mats and knots out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Otherwise it’ll need to be cut.”</p><p> </p><p>Another nod, and a look of mistrust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could deal, it was only two weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Malfoy was as docile as a baby lamb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What trouble could he possibly cause?</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>The first thing I did upon arriving at work was book an appointment with Shacklebolt for later in the week.</p><p> </p><p>That morning, I had made a quick breakfast of eggs and toast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy managed a whole fried egg and half a bread slice, covered in a thick layer of marmalade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then he sat and watched me eat, working the scab on his left arm raw, until it was festering once more.</p><p> </p><p>During Auror training, I picked up a little Muggle first-aid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Useful in cases where you didn’t know what curse had been used, and you were scared to do more damage with added magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was time to employ some of these techniques on Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>I pushed away from the table, and calmly said, “you’re gonna get an infection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me clean that up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I walked sedately to the bathroom, where I picked out my supplies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Back in the kitchen, Malfoy had gone as still as a statue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want me to touch him, but he’d let me; he was my prisoner, as he so kindly remind me last night.</p><p> </p><p>I didn’t want to touch him either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or rather, I was scared to touch him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had a legitimate excuse to hold Malfoy’s wrist - that ethereal, fragile wrist - and seize it in my strong grasp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To circle my fingers around it. To see my freckled hand linked with his pale one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I didn’t want to. Not when he was so clearly terrified of my touch. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><em>This is just like any patch-up job in the line of duty</em>, I lied to myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I grabbed his elbow instead, and got my first close look at the giant sore on his arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The skin was puckered and pink in some places, raw and weeping in others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And underneath, greyish-black lines, almost like...</p><p> </p><p>Harry had been right all along.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy had taken the Dark Mark.</p><p> </p><p>And someone had tried to remove it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This looks like a burn,” I said, horrified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Burns were fairly easy to heal, if dealt with promptly. How had this been overlooked for so long?</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Malfoy agreed, but offered no further explanation.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you get it?” I demanded, squeezing his bicep rather tightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did this happen in Azkaban?”</p><p> </p><p>He looked at me, and the naked emotion was so plain on his face, it left me floundering for my next move.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t,” he said pleadingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was heartbreaking, even more so coming from someone who had been as cocky as Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>“Ok,” I said soothingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I threw myself into the task at hand; rubbing in a healing Potion, covering the wound in telfa and wrapping it in gauze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s ok.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t need to know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just keep this dry today, yeah?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll check it when I get home, to see if you need a new one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And no picking!”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy stared at the bandage, much like he stared at the book the previous night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He still hadn’t looked up when I left for work.</p><p> </p><p>Which was why I needed to meet with Shacklebolt.</p><p> </p><p>Just what in the bloody buggering fuck was going on in Azkaban?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Things were supposed to have improved, with the Dementors gone, and Aurors in charge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, I hadn’t expected the prisoners to be living in the lap of luxury.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But what Malfoy looked like... what he must have endured, in the two years he’d been imprisoned... it wasn’t right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Hermione stopped by with sandwiches and pumpkin juice at lunch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hadn’t even thought of eating, but once it was all unwrapped and laid out on my desk, I found myself suddenly ravenous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How’s it going with Malfoy?” she asked, fiddling with a bit of crust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She seemed rather tentative, which was unlike the brash, confident girl I knew so well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You aren’t being too hard on him, are you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck’s sake, ‘Mione!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione once admitted to me that I could come across as cruel. Apparently Luna had made a random, rambling comment to this effect, back in Hogwarts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was furious at the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How could anyone think I was cruel?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my family, I’d always labelled as the over-sensitive one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boy who worried too much, and over-analyzed everything inside his head, until it was blown way out of proportion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And yeah, maybe sometimes I lashed out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But not without reason.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was being the last in a line of six boys, before the much-anticipated baby girl was finally born, that made me question my worth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe that was just my personality, who knew?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Regardless, I had always felt... less.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just less.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was something I never really outgrew, although I had learned to manage it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Auror training was good in that regard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I discovered that a lot of people had doubts, and not just in their magical abilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Still, it rankled that one of my best friends; my previous girlfriend, in fact; still thought of me as a spiteful prick who would deliberately hurt a person under my care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I replied in a clipped tone, “Malfoy’s fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m fine too, thanks for asking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s only for two weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything will be... fine.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yup, we were all fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy looked like a fucking skeleton, covered in burns and sores and Merlin knew what. He could barely stomach a meal fit for a child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he didn’t speak, unless he had no other option.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meanwhile, I was daydreaming over his finely boned fucking wrists.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because that’s perfectly normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Totally fine.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, Ron,” she said, abashed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I didn’t mean to imply that you were mistreating Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s just... well, I’ve seen his file.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course she had, working in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I was worried it would upset you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are some pretty wild accusations in there.”</p><p> </p><p>Which was exactly why I had decided not to read the sodding file in the first place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it was looking more and more like I would have to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bollocks.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine, Hermione,” I said, and she smiled crookedly at my overuse of the word fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Malfoy’s safe with me.”</p><p> </p><p>I don’t know what made me say it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn’t supposed to keep him safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was a temporary house arrest situation, nothing more, until there was room again in Azkaban. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I know,” she replied, patting my hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I do know, Ron, how sweet and noble you are.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s one of the reasons, when they were looking for somewhere to place Malfoy, that I recommended you.”</p><p> </p><p>So I had Hermione to thank for this?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried to feel angry, at her sticking her bossy nose and bushy head into my life once again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I found I couldn’t muster the proper ire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt proud, in a way, that she trusted me so much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And that’s why they picked me?” I asked hopefully.</p><p> </p><p>“Noooo,” she said slowly, carefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like she didn’t want to reveal the truth, but didn’t know how to hide it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think they picked you because they thought you’d be the best person for the job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To keep up with the punishments Malfoy received at Azkaban.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt raw and exposed, as she studied me with her suggestive, knowing look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thankfully, I was more practised at interpreting her expressions now than I ever had been as a young boy, and was able to infer her meaning. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Malfoy had been released to me, because they thought I would carry on with his exploitation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My fears had been confirmed.</p><p> </p><p>Merlin, the Magical legal system was as corrupt as ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What was the point of the wars, and the rebuilding, if not to learn from our mistakes?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing ever fucking changed.</p><p> </p><p>Unless it was my turn, this time, to bring about the change?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What an unwanted and wholly daunting thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was no Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding world, or Hermione Granger, social justice warrior and champion of the oppressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was just Ron Weasley, ok Auror, kinda cruel as a boy, full of self-doubts, the least-loved kid in a family of seven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing special.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certainly not up to such a large task.</p><p> </p><p>And really, was Malfoy even worth it?</p><p> </p><p>Baby steps, then. “Hey, ‘Mione?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could I borrow a bottle of Sleekeazy’s?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Untangle Malfoy’s hair tonight, solve the world’s problems tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy was hovering tensely in front of my favourite armchair when I arrived home. Probably didn’t want me to catch him sitting down. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The first thing I noticed was that his bandage was gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The skin looked loads better, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still puckered, but much less red and angry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second thing that caught my eye was Malfoy’s knees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was dressed in a pair of Harry’s old swim trunks, topped off with a t-shirt that had once belonged to Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The overall effect was a lot of milky pale exposed skin, most notably a stretch of stomach between the too-short shirt and the low riding shorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But for all of that, it was his knobby knees that caught and held my eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wondered what the skin would be like, at the back, where they bent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would it be soft?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would it be paler than the rest of his body?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would it flush with goose pimples when stroked?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A silent scream bounced through my brain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wrong, wrong, these thoughts were so very wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was feeling itchy, uncomfortable in my own skin.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy shuffled from foot to foot, breaking my daze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Where’d you find the clothes?” I asked gruffly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How had I forgotten something as simple as clothes?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would definitely need some properly fitting attire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d get Percy to send some stuff over; they had much the same lanky build, minus the 3 or so stone Percy had on Malfoy at the moment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“In the chest in the spare bedroom,” Malfoy replied, tugging on the swim trunks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As soon as he let go, they drooped down past his hollow hip bones again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least the skin on his abdomen looked healthier.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you have a bath today?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“With more healing Potions?” Another nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m glad you listened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although, you’ve taken your bandage off.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You said not to get it wet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I haven’t been picking!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Merlin, Malfoy sounded like a chastened child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not a hint of the old contempt he used to show the professors at Hogwarts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was as if he was an entirely different person, and I found I didn’t like it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“That’s great,” I said, feeling enormously stupid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I sounded like I was talking to Teddy Lupin or something, not a grown man of twenty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Come here, then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll rebandage it for you.”</p><p> </p><p>It was odd, how quickly we settled into a routine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cooked Malfoy breakfast every morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I came home after work, he would be lingering awkwardly by my chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’d eat supper together, I’d bandage his arm, and we’d retire to the living room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy spoke a little more every day, and finally, on the third evening, we had a real conversation. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He was squinting at a book, and since pages were actually turning, he seemed to be reading it this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had forgone my usual telly watching, in favour of jotting down some notes for my appointment with Kingsley Shacklebolt in the morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t realize I was talking to myself until Malfoy asked me his first direct question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What are you working on?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” I replied ineloquently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was so focused, I’d almost forgotten he was there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I thought you said... never mind.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He dropped his head back into his book, eyes way too close to the pages.</p><p> </p><p>I glanced at my sheet. The last thing I had written was ‘why me?’. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I didn’t want to tell Malfoy too much about the upcoming meeting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing destroyed the soul more brutally than false hope.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I uh... I sometimes talk out loud when I’m working.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was just wondering why they placed you with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“For Salazar’s sake, read the fucking file, Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I see it sitting on the table, gathering dust, you utter prat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Read my file, then see if you still want to cook me breakfast and draw my bath and fucking sit with me in your fucking living room every fucking evening.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His chest heaved with effort.</p><p> </p><p>My mouth fell open in shock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was the old Malfoy temper, rearing it’s ugly head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it abandoned the boy as quickly as it had come, leaving him slumped back in the chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was inappropriate,” he said, staring down at his knees.</p><p> </p><p>Inappropriate or not, Malfoy’s little outburst had my stomach flipping over, feeling all tingly and weird and leaving me with a hollow, achy longing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Speak your mind, Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d rather hear your thoughts, however dickish they may be, than watch you sit here day after day like a dormant, puppety Inferius.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy smiled, just the slightest turning up of his lips, before his expression smoothed back into his normal, pensive look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However feeble that smile might have been, it still left my heart soaring in my chest.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Draco sodding Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>Seriously, two years spent without a second thought spared for the obnoxious git, all down the fucking tubes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And for what?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the boy who made my life, the lives of my closest friends, miserable during our school years?</p><p> </p><p>The worst part, the very bloody worst, most infuriating part, was how quickly I fell back into my old habits. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Back at Hogwarts, there was a boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A beautiful blond boy, with the face of an angel and the sharp tongue of a snake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I watched that boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Secretly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Covertly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I watched him, and attempted to separate him neatly into two different entities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fair and lovely boy whose delicate looks prickled my heart and made my head spin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was distinct from the caustic, snarling boy who spat malicious insults like they were nothing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It was ok for me to covet the beautiful boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or so I told myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d get lost, watching him on the Quidditch pitch, his lanky frame bent low over his broom, slender arm extended in a desperate bid to catch the snitch, long dexterous fingers reaching impossibly forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was then that I first noticed his wrists, peeking coquettishly from his emerald green Quidditch kit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I blamed those wrists for turning my brain to absolute mush.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, I was a bad friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes, I wished with all my might for that boy to win the game, to conquer, even over my own best mate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over my own House. Just for a chance to see his smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the smile of pure glee and happiness, for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The smile of an elated boy, riding the high of his accomplishment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was quick.

In a lower voice, I asked him, “you really can’t make tea?”</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t make anything,” he muttered.</p><p> </p><p>My brain worked overtime to process that, coming up with a conclusion I didn’t like at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So, while I’m at work, or not home, what do you... do you eat anything?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not really,” Malfoy shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>Eating and regular meals were such a large part of my world, I was having a hard time fathoming this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not even a yogurt or bit of cheese from the fridge?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve never opened the fridge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m scared to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know how it works.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy’s honesty took me by surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I stared at him, wide eyed, until he continued, “sometimes I’ll have a piece of fruit, if there is any on the counter.”</p><p> </p><p>That just wouldn’t do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ok.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I should have thought of that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From now on, I’ll leave something out for you, under a stasis charm, and you can eat it whenever you want.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You need to put on some weight, and skipping meals isn’t gonna help that.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy looked anguished.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Why are you doing this?” he whispered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Why all the meals, and the clothes, and the healing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s a waste of your time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll be gone in less than-“</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t,” I cried out, much louder than necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I... just... don’t think about that, or talk about that, right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” he said, rolling his eyes at me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It cut the tension, which was good, since Harry arrived back in the living room with tea at just that moment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“If you are feeling better, I’m going to head back to work,” Harry said, as he handed out the mugs of steaming tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll see you at the Burrow on Sunday, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” I parroted, sending another glance Malfoy’s way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wished I could bring him along for one of Mum’s Sunday brunches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But his collar prevented him from leaving the house at all, even from going into the back garden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another thing to discuss with Shacklebolt - Malfoy should have a chance to enjoy fresh outdoor air, at the very least.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to fix your hair?” I asked gently, hoping he wouldn’t start in on pointlessness of it all.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy fingered a large gnarl of tangles that reached down past his chin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That would be...nice,” he replied haltingly. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I scootched up onto the back of the couch and perched behind him, my legs bracketing his body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Accio hair Potion. Accio comb.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bottle zoomed into my outstretched hand with a sturdy thump, followed quickly by the comb from my bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I dumped half the bottle on Malfoy’s head, working it into the knots diligently with my fingertips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I started to comb it all out, little bits at a time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was painstaking work, but soothing, in its own way. Malfoy sat rigid, not moving except to breathe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually I upended the rest of the bottle into his hair, and even the most stubborn clumps responded to the comb, laying flat and shiny against Malfoy’s head.</p><p> </p><p>“There,” I said, giving his shoulder a quick squeeze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt bony and insubstantial under my hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“All done. I hope that wasn’t too painful.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy practically jumped from the couch, turning and standing stiffly before me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you,” he said formally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His Adam’s apple bobbed once on a thick swallow, and I tracked the movement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good night.”</p><p> </p><p>He raced from the room, and after mere moments, I heard the door to the spare bedroom slam shut behind him. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Sunday found me at my childhood home, surrounded by siblings and friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Burrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had always been a place of happy memories for me, regardless of our lack of Galleons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt safe and loved here.</p><p> </p><p>Usually I ate too much food, drank too much ale, and spoke way too loudly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This time was different.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was in a contemplative mood all through brunch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I saw more than one questioning look thrown my way, but I shrugged them all off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m fine,” I insisted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I just have a lot on my mind.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I locked eyes with Kingsley, and he nodded grimly. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He found Harry and I outside by the shed, which held an odd assortment of Quidditch gear, garden supplies, and muggle junk smuggled home by my Father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Peeking in the window brought me back to simpler times, when my biggest worry was an out of-date racing broom.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco Malfoy’s been awarded an additional two weeks before his sentence is carried out,” Shacklebolt said with no preamble.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Straight to the point; I liked it.</p><p> </p><p>“That gives me three weeks,” I replied.</p><p> </p><p>“To do what?” Harry asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My expression must have been less than friendly, as he continued, “no offence intended, Ron. It’s just that three weeks isn’t a long time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What exactly are you hoping to accomplish?”</p><p> </p><p>Fucked if I knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You saw him, Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You saw him, that first day, the condition he was in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was supposed to be better, after the war.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Things were supposed to improve, be less corrupt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Azkaban...it’s still so awful.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt like that was a vast understatement.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a prison, Ron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Filled with the most vile of our kind; murderers and Death Eaters and the like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not meant to be nice.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you believe Malfoy is a murderer?” I spat out, furious all of a sudden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, you spoke at his trial.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you really think he deserves to be imprisoned, let alone basically tortured in that festering shithole of Azkaban?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry took a step back, and I realized I was leaning forward, snarling into his face, my hands balled into fists at my sides.</p><p> </p><p>“Calm the fuck down, Ron,” Harry said with a sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Of course I don’t think Malfoy belongs in Azkaban; I never did.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry’s face was marred by an expression I was all too familiar with - like the weight of the world still rest on his shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I just don’t think anyone else agrees with us.”</p><p> </p><p>“Kingsley does,” I said, tilting my head at the other man, who has witnessed our exchange in silence. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Harry raised his eyebrows, and Shacklebolt nodded in agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He quickly held up a hand before he stated, in a calm voice, “not that I can be viewed as taking sides, as Minister for Magic, before the evidence is gathered and presented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will do my best to help you behind the scenes, but that is really all I can promise.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He met both our gazes with a stony stare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You do understand what I’m saying, boys?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes sir,” I replied. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Excellent. Good luck to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meanwhile, I’ll investigate the protocols of Azkaban.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discreetly, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I promised Molly I’d return promptly for a spot of treacle tart.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s head sprung up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There’s treacle tart?” he asked eagerly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know why he was surprised; Mum always made Harry’s favourite pudding when she knew he’d be over.</p><p> </p><p>Watching them amble back to the house, I knew how lucky I was to have these powerful, competent, trustworthy wizards at my side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But in the long run, this was my problem, or set of problems, to solve.</p><p> </p><p>Terrifying concept, that.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Mum sent me with enough leftovers, frozen meals, and baked goods to feed a whole Hogwarts House.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She didn’t mention Malfoy directly, but as I was leaving, she did pat my arm and give me a sad smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m proud of you, Ronald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not an easy thing you are doing”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m not sure if she meant babysitting Malfoy, or if she had caught wind of my feeble baby steps towards evoking a change, but either way, her words warmed my heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Molly Weasley was not known for holding back on giving direct and emphatic advice. Her composed faith in me was a welcome morale boost.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Malfoy’s eyes widened and his eyebrows flew up when he saw the volume of food I returned with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He helped stack things on the counter, but fumbled when it came to properly storing and putting the food away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I handed him a cinnamon roll to keep his hands occupied while I got organized, and snuck one for myself while I was at it.</p><p> </p><p>As I unrolled and savoured my treat, I stole glances at Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nibbled at the end of his cinnamon roll cautiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had to resist the urge to roll a chunk off and stick it his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Finally he took a larger bite, and chewed thoughtfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is really good, Weasley. What exactly is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a tea biscuit cinnamon roll,” I replied with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They reminded me of Christmases at the Burrow as a small boy, wrapped up in a blanket beside the tree, sipping hot cocoa and devouring cinnamon rolls straight out of the oven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“An old family recipe Mum likes to make, usually for special occasions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’re my favourite.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” Malfoy said, looking down at his hands and placing the roll on the counter.</p><p> </p><p>“What?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What’s wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>“Your Mother made these for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shouldn’t be eating them.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy, you do not know Molly Weasley very well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I laughed a little, and said, “do you honestly think I get sent home with this much food every week?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This isn’t for me, it’s for you!”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy’s head snapped up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My Mother is worried about you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably thinks you are being subjected to horrid takeaways and cardboard microwave meals, as if I am not the only one of her children who ever showed an interest in learning to cook.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shrugged my shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parents, what could you do?</p><p> </p><p>“She wouldn’t care about me, I’m sure,” Malfoy said stiltedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Oh, she would, not that you deserve it, what with the rude shit you’ve said about her.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, it was fun to watch Malfoy squirm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seemed like the little blond Slytherin did have a conscience after all. “You vastly underestimate her love of caring for strays.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” Malfoy said again, seeming at a loss for words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not everyday a Pureblood supremacist gets overfed by a blood traitor.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I make you a plate?” I asked.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m not all that hungry, thank you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think I’ll go take a nap.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, ok,” I said awkwardly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hey, before you go, I have some news.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Malfoy looked at me guardedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Your...time here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s been extended for another two weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An official announcement will be made by the Ministry on Monday.”</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy sucked in a huge gust of breath, then let it out slowly, closing his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His hands gripped the table in front of him, white knuckled and faintly trembling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Someone is protesting my sentencing, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” I said, and Malfoy’s eyes opened and locked with mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I continued, in a quiet, hushed tone, “someone is protesting your sentencing”.</p><p> </p><p>Those silver-grey eyes stared at me, searchingly, like the man they belonged to was trying to read my soul.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Perhaps your Mother is not the only Weasley with a propensity for helping strays,” Malfoy whispered, as he reached out and grazed the back of my hand with a feather light touch.</p><p> </p><p>Before I could react, he rushed out of the kitchen, brushing against my arm during his retreat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My stomach flipped over erratically, and it had nothing to do with the immense volume of food I had consumed at the Burrow earlier.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Every Wizarding criminal and petty burglar in England came out of the woodwork the next week, leaving the Aurors run off their feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My case load had grown dramatically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So tall was the stack of unfinished paperwork in my inbox, I was barely able to see Hermione when she showed up on Thursday with curry takeaway.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve got to stop meeting like this, Ronald,” she said, as she moved some random files from the chair across the desk from me.</p><p> </p><p>“I know, I know,” I murmured around a mouthful of chicken curry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Merlin, it tasted delicious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d been leaving plates of Mum’s leftovers out for Malfoy all week under stasis charms, and had been resorting to soggy sandwiches from the cafeteria for myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve just been-“</p><p> </p><p>“Busy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can see that.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione flicked her wand, and the towers of files on my desk flew gracefully into the corner of the cubicle, stacked much more neatly than I had managed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“With the increased arrests, our department is chaotic as well.”</p><p> </p><p>That’s what I loved about Hermione; she didn’t hold a grudge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, anymore, I should say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I did still remember those birds she set at me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But since we talked through our relationship, and decided we made more sense as friends, Hermione and I were much better at expressing our thoughts and emotions to each other.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco Malfoy’s...circumstances..the extension on his...”</p><p> </p><p>“Execution?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Murder?” I asked wryly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Go ahead and call it like it is, Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ve never been one to mince words.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, right,” she muttered, blushing a bit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Anyway, it’s the hot topic of gossip in my area of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one was expecting a challenge on the sentencing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked at me knowingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I wonder what happened?”</p><p> </p><p>“You would make a horrible detective,” I said, laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She stuck out her tongue before laughing with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Since you brought the subject up, I have a favour to ask”.</p><p> </p><p>Just then Harry Potter burst through the door, holding his side and panting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Late,” he said between lung fulls of air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione and I grinned at each other while we waited for Harry to catch his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hey, is that curry I smell?” he asked, perking up considerably. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You two, honestly,” Hermione grumbled good-naturedly while preparing a plate for Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Every meal you treat like your last.”</p><p> </p><p>“Being an Auror is dangerous business, sweetheart,” Harry replied in a low, throaty voice, shooting her a wink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione dissolved into giggles, and it was just like old times again.</p><p> </p><p>“Ron was just about to ask me for a favour,” Hermione said to Harry when she regained her composure.</p><p> </p><p>“I was going to ask you both a favour, actually,” I admitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Would you be willing to speak on Draco Malfoy’s behalf?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Publicly?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione didn’t even hesitate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Of course I would, Ron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I testified at his trial, and I’d be willing to do so again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He may be a spectacular git, but he doesn’t deserve the harsh punishment he was sentenced to, any idiot can see that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I agree,” Harry said. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Wait a minute, though,” I cautioned, “you aren’t thinking this through.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At Draco’s trial, you were fresh out of Hogwarts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You didn’t have prestigious jobs that could be affected by your testimony.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione’s lips grew thin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s a big risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it...is he, worth it?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Hermione exchanged a look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione spoke first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ron, I don’t know if Malfoy is worth me losing my job over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can tell you that I am sick of the corruption and miscarriage of justice I see in my department, and the Ministry as a whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that’s something worth fighting for, regardless of the outcome.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re behind you one hundred percent, mate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just tell us what you need. What’s the plan?”</p><p> </p><p>I’d never been a crier, but my eyes felt a little moist in that moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nothing concrete yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m mulling over some ideas, determining the best strategy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Basically I was mapping the problem out like a huge game of chess, trying to anticipate all the moves and counter moves. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Right now, I’d just like you both to preserve some memories for me, so they can be viewed by pensieve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone knows how difficult it is to modify or tamper with a memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They might have more weight than verbal testimony.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I turned to Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry, ‘Mione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I need to ask you for some painful memories.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can handle it,” she said, her mouth quirking up on one side. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I knew she could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no one tougher than Hermione Granger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ok.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could you catalogue our time at Malfoy Manor, when the Snatchers caught us?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How Draco didn’t identify you, even when prompted?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And maybe the Room of Requirement, with the Fiendfyre?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>I gripped her hand, giving it a firm squeeze, before turning my attention to Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I can preserve those memories too,” he offered, before I could speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And you’ll also be wanting the night on the Astronomy Tower, I reckon?”</p><p> </p><p>“That would be great, thanks,” I smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I would also like your memory of what Draco looked like when I brought him home from Azkaban.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry paled considerably, but nodded his head.</p><p> </p><p>We sat in a sober silence, finishing the last of our curry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally Hermione stood and announced, “we all better get back to work.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” I said to my two best friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry patted me on the shoulder as he left for his own cubicle. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Hermione lingered a little longer, hovering in the doorway with an indecisive look on her face. I was just about to make a joke, when she asked, quietly, “how long have you been thinking of Malfoy as Draco?”</p><p> </p><p>I opened my mouth to answer, but no sound came out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally I was able to utter a creaky, “Hermione...”. It wasn’t an explanation - more like a plea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For what, I wasn’t sure.</p><p> </p><p>“Be careful, Ron,” she said, giving me a worried smile.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry I’ve been gone so much,” I said to Malfoy...to Draco that evening when I stepped out of the floo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the first time I had been home before 10 p.m. since Sunday.</p><p> </p><p>Draco looked startled, his grey eyes wide and burning bright.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum’s cooking had done him a world of good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His face had filled out, so his cheekbones were just pronounced as opposed to glass-cutting sharp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he still had purple rings around his eyes, giving him a worn-out look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No need to apologize to me, Weasley,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Almost scoffed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like the Hogwarts Draco Malfoy, full of life and swagger.</p><p> </p><p>“I know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still, I feel bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope you haven’t been too bored.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He just stared at me incredulously, his arms crossed over his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I...uh..noticed you’ve read most of my books.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not that there was much to choose from.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hermione brought some she thought you might like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here,” I said, shoving Hermione’s magically enhanced tote at him. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco gripped the bag and brought it to his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Granger lent me books?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowing her taste, there’ll be loads of dry old history books and some boring law texts,” I said, trying to make a joke.</p><p> </p><p>Draco didn’t laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t even crack a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He just...stood there, small and a little overwhelmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Please pass along my gratitude,” he said formally.</p><p> </p><p>“You can borrow Pig and tell her yourself.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At his confused look, I gestured to the bird perch and cage standing next to the floo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Pig’s my owl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’ll deliver a note for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He can always find Hermione.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure I’m supposed to be sending correspondence.”</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They put you under my watch, and I say it’s fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tough if they don’t agree.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My voice turned hard at the end, and Draco tilted his head and gazed at me, like he was pondering a particularly difficult Transfiguration assignment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll...see.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nodded once, stiffly, and went upstairs to his room.</p><p> </p><p>I followed soon after.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had a lot to mull over, and with how mental work had been, I’d been doing my best thinking at night before falling to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Kingsley had sent a memo soon after Harry and Hermione had left my office, requesting a meeting for the following afternoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The note was typically generic, giving nothing away, and so I was anxious to learn what his investigation into Azkaban had unearthed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That information might figure into my plans.</p><p> </p><p>At the present, I was working on securing character witnesses for Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry and Hermione were in, as per our conversation earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was also kicking around the possibility of contacting Professor Slughorn and Headmistress McGonagall. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Even if McGonagall was unable or unwilling to speak on Draco’s behalf, I was hoping she could grant me access to someone who would.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe two someones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both Dumbledore and Snape had portraits in the Head of Hogwarts office.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Historically speaking, portraits were not considered admissible witnesses in criminal cases.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But as character witnesses, I might have a shot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Plus, they were both war heroes, with Dumbledore being the foremost wizard of the generation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their testimony certainly couldn’t do any harm.</p><p> </p><p>Like a chess match, it all hinged on a number of ‘ifs’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If McGonagall approved my request and allowed me access to the portraits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If Snape would even bother to speak to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He certainly didn’t have much use for me when I was his student.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And most importantly, if Dumbledore could support Harry’s version of what happened that fateful night on the Astronomy Tower.</p><p> </p><p>I was contemplating my bad luck of being an adult Auror still scared of Snape in portrait form when I drifted off to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>My dream was particularly lucid that evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I dreamt of the golden boy from my childhood; the one with the sweet smile. But this time, he was scrawny and pale with bruises around his eyes and a metal collar choking his neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He kept reaching out for me, scabbed arm extended to grab my hand, but no matter how fast I ran, I was never able to close the gap between us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He remained smiling, even though I could see he was in pain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His blond hair waved gently in the wind, falling over his forehead, and I longed to brush it back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I just couldn’t reach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually, he realized I’d never catch up, never get there, and his sweet smile was replaced with one of rueful acceptance. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We were never meant to be,” he called out, and I physically felt my heart break. Once when I was young, I fell off my broom from a great height, and landed flat on my back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All the air was knocked from my lungs, and I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t catch a breath. Every bone, muscle, and tissue in my body ached. That’s how I felt hearing, “were never meant to be...never meant to be,” echoed over and over again on the wind, while the ethereal blond boy drew further and further away.</p><p> </p><p>I woke in the morning on a wet pillow, with salty tracks staining my face, and a throbbing migraine.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>“You look like shit,” Kingsley stated when I walked into his office.</p><p> </p><p>“Cheers, mate,” I replied, flopping into the vacant chair. “You look a little rough around the edges as well.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well I’ve had the week from hell,” he said, scrubbing a hand over his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Merlin, Ron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Azkaban investigation opened up a whole rotten can of worms.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At my confused look, he explained, “muggle expression.”</p><p> </p><p>Muggles have canned worms?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For what purpose, exactly?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shook my head, refocusing on the matter at hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good news, or bad?”</p><p> </p><p>“The worst.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You were right,” he said simply, and rather sadly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The conditions at Azkaban are bloody appalling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Protocol is not being followed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s a fucking mess, to be quite frank.”</p><p> </p><p>I was shocked speechless by Shacklebolt’s foul language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kingsley was usually so articulate and even-tempered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The perfect Minister for Magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it must be bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Worse than bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What Kingsley discovered must be godawful.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what I’m going to do!” he exploded, thumping his hands on his desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This runs so deep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The corruption, the secrets and deals and mistreatment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For Merlin’s sake, Ron, a quarter of the Auror Department is suspect, maybe more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To make matters worse, some highly positioned wizards and witches of the Wizengamot appear to have acted unfairly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The whole Department of Magical Law Enforcement might need an overhaul.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He dropped his head and buried it in his hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I trusted these people.”</p><p> </p><p>I’d dealt with Harry enough over the years to know where this was going.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s not your fault.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All I got for an answer was a snort, so I repeated, “no, it’s not your fault.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are only one man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can’t be everywhere at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ve done a world of good in these last two years.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He looked up at me, with a glimmer of hope.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t want to be like Fudge, with my head stuck in the sand, refusing to acknowledge the truth.”</p><p> </p><p>“No worries there,” I said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“When I brought my concerns to your attention, you opened an investigation right away, even though you hoped I was full of shit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fudge never would have done that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re right,” Kingsley said, pulling himself up to sit straighter in his chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked like the stately, well put-together Minister once more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re going to fix this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve already got the ball rolling at Azkaban.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Totally new staff, as of this morning.”</p><p> </p><p>I looked at him incredulously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Really?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s...wow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How did you manage that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Azkaban had one Auror in charge, acting as Warden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One man, with absolute power, and no one to answer to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A man named,” Kingsley rustled through his papers, “Samuel Roddick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was his job to create a rota amoung the Aurors to form a guard at the prison.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, old Sam decided that just wouldn’t do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hired out for guards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Employed some pretty disturbed, sick individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried to clean things up a bit when other Aurors came to call.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t know what happened when you went to pick up Draco Malfoy, something must have slipped through the cracks.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” I said slowly, processing the information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But more likely, they thought I wouldn’t mind the condition Draco was in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the contrary, I think it was assumed that Draco would be punished quite severely under my watch.” I felt sick again just saying it.</p><p> </p><p>Kingsley nodded, folding his hands into his lap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes were slightly glazed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, that makes sense,” he said, almost to himself. Then he focused on me again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Other high profile prisoners, who have received similar sentencing to Draco Malfoy, were also released into Auror care, as you well know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was initially pitched to me as a way to increase space in Azkaban, while providing death-sentenced prisoners a final stint of time out of a cell.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nice in theory,” I said.</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly,” Shacklebolt agreed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And honest Aurors, like you and Harry, would do your best to be civil, and uphold the spirit of the release.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, I fear others have taken advantage of their power, and abused prisoners assigned to their care.”</p><p> </p><p>I swallowed heavily, trying to calm his roiling stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Who decided where the prisoners would be placed?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s obviously not random.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a well thought out scheme.”</p><p> </p><p>“Members of the Wizengamot, working together with a senior staff member of the DMLE.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Names are still hush-hush at this point.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The investigation isn’t complete.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right,” I said, trying to wrap my head around the depth of the corruption.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t envy Kingsley one bit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But you did say Azkaban has been sorted?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Kingsley replied, smiling for the first time that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Roddick has been replaced with three retired Aurors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Good wizards, who I’ve worked with, and trust with my life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of these ex-Aurors will be present at Azkaban at all times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The problem of guards is a little trickier to solve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For now, we’ve got Auror trainees taking it in shifts, but a more permanent solution will need to be put in place soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Merlin, it all sounded so daunting, just thinking about it made me weary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted to drop my head to my arms on Kingsley’s desk and take a nap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had no idea the storm I would stir up, back when I walked into this office two weeks ago, all because of Draco Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>“So what now?” I asked sluggishly.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that depends on you,” Shacklebolt said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How involved do you want to be?”</p><p> </p><p>I had a bad feeling about this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t know,” I replied honestly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There are times I wish that I never went to Azkaban that day, never picked up Draco Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or at least never opened my mouth about what I saw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then, other times, I’m...I’m glad it was me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that I had the bollocks to speak up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Believe me, Ronald, I’m glad it was you, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, for what it’s worth, you should be very proud of yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d like you to be part of the restructuring at Azkaban, if you are willing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmmmm,” I hummed, playing for time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did I really want to spend time at that dank prison, even if it was for a noble cause?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll keep that in mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please do,” Kingsley said, dropping his head and scratching a note on a piece of parchment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Now, how are things going with the other matter?”</p><p> </p><p>My mind had been racing like a jinxed Firebolt since the start of the meeting, trying to use the new information in a way that would help Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I thought I had an idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, I was thinking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In light of the corruption uncovered in the DMLE, I wonder if now might be a good time to demand a review of Draco’s case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe the Aurors were a little too outlandish, levelling all those murder charges at a man who didn’t actually kill anyone during the war?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And maybe the Wizengamot was a little too hasty, finding that man guilty?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds entirely plausible,” Shacklebolt smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sure you’ll find an eager young member of the DMLE to help you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know just the person,” I said, picturing Hermione in all her do-goodery splendour. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It hadn’t escaped my mind that she recommended me for Draco’s release.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe she knew more than she was letting on. “But will the investigation be complete in time to help Draco?”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But since you have shown interest in upholding the new, improved standards at Azkaban,” he shot me a wink while I rolled my eyes, “and you are a top Junior Auror, who I have personal trust in, it is entirely plausible for me to make you privy to top secret information regarding the ongoing investigation.”</p><p> </p><p>Wow. That was just...wow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you, Kingsley,” I murmured, my neck flushing red.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I won’t let you down”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hoped.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m more worried about you letting yourself down, if you set your expectations too high,” he said seriously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t see Draco Malfoy walking away from this scott-free.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is still a chance that his sentencing will be completed as ordered.”</p><p> </p><p>Right now I’d be happy if Draco wasn’t scheduled to have his soul sucked from his body in two weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m trying to remain optimistically realistic.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something I hadn’t been very good at, in the past.</p><p> </p><p>“And that’s just one more reason why I have such confidence in you,” Shacklebolt said, and my chest flooded with warmth.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>I knew I should fill Draco in, but I really didn’t want to. For some reason, it was easier to communicate with the most influential wizards and witches, like the Minister for Magic and Headmistress of Hogwarts, than to have a conversation with the prisoner under my care.</p><p> </p><p>On a positive note, McGonagall had come through, assuring me of her support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And apparently Dumbledore and Snape were quite eager to help as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Headmistress had volunteered to speak with both portraits and preserve the memory of each conversation for my perusal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was even willing to ask specific questions I provided, saving me a lot of time and hassle.</p><p> </p><p>What I needed before chatting with Draco was a way to butter him up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hey, Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still working?” I asked as I stuck my head over his cubicle wall.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” he sighed, massaging his neck a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I want to get all my paperwork done before I leave for the weekend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m off both days, barring an utter catastrophe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have an old pair of glasses kicking around?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knew he probably did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he finally upgraded his much-abused pair from childhood, after receiving his first Auror paycheck, Hermione and I had encouraged him to chuck the old ones in the bin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry was reluctant in the extreme, and became more and more shifty the harder we pushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally he admitted that the Dursleys had made such a big deal about providing them to him, had made him work so hard to ‘help pay them off’, that he viewed those glasses as extremely valuable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t imagine it had gotten any easier for him with time.</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” he answered slowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Why do you ask?”</p><p> </p><p>I didn’t want to admit that I’d noticed Draco squinting while he read, holding the books abnormally close to his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, I just know someone who could use help with their eyesight,” I said airily.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You have no idea how glasses work, do you?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone’s eyes are different, Ron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each pair of glasses works only for the person they were made for.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s weird,” I said, feeling perplexed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Percy used to borrow Bill’s all the time, until Mum and Dad could afford to get him a pair of his own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lenses were charmed to suit the vision of the person wearing them.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry gaped at me for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Magical eyeglasses?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is such a thing as magical eyeglasses?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, of course, you dolt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have you been replacing yours with muggle specs all this time?”</p><p> </p><p>“I...I don’t even want to talk about it,” Harry mumbled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I heard him murmur “magical glasses” multiple times under his breath in wonder.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll ask Mum about it, we’ll get you set up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was pretty sure Percy had gone to St Mungos for his specs, but I’d double check. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, thanks,” he replied, a wide smile on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry I couldn’t be more helpful.”</p><p> </p><p>I shrugged and returned his smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No worries, mate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just wanted to help a friend read easier, that all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, well that I may be able to help you with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sounds like your ‘friend’ is farsighted.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The way Harry emphasized the word friend, I was pretty sure he knew I was asking for Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m actual nearsighted, I need my glasses to see things at a distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can buy reading glasses at muggle chemists.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It helps to know the prescription, but you could pick up a few different pairs, and give them a try?”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brilliant!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thanks Harry”.</p><p> </p><p>Turned out there were a lot of different options for reading glasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I grabbed a few of the stronger pairs, paid with the odd paper muggle money, and made my way back home.</p><p> </p><p>My timing was perfect; Draco was sitting close to the fire, reading one of the huge tomes Hermione had lent him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was so engrossed, he didn’t even notice my entrance into the room.</p><p> </p><p>I was able to get right next to his chair before he jumped at my presence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ron!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My stars, I didn’t hear you come in,” Draco gasped, clutching a hand to his heart.</p><p> </p><p>A warm, coiling heat ignited in my belly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn’t sure if it was Draco’s use of my first name, or his adorable old lady-like reaction to being startled, but the draw I felt to the blond was undeniable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knelt down in front of the chair, by his feet, and rummaged through my carrier bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I got these to help you see better when reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s a few different strengths, so you’ll have to test them out to see what suits best.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I held out a pair of specs to Draco.</p><p> </p><p>My hand hovered there awkwardly while Draco sat stone still.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tension was becoming a little unbearable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh, here...I’ll just...uh...put them on, shall I?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I opened the arms of the glasses, leaned forward, and laid them gently on Draco’s nose, being particularly careful when placing them behind his ears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There, let’s see how they work,” I said jovially, trying to lighten the tense mood. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I went to release the arms and lean away, but Draco brought his hands up and covered mine, so that I was now cradling his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried to look at him, to gauge his mood, but our faces were too close, and everything just appeared distorted and blurry, his features swimming in front of my eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could feel his faint puffs of breath, brushing my skin, and the tentative pressure of his delicate hands over mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were suspended in time, both too terrified to move, worried that it would shatter this precious moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally Draco’s hands dropped to my wrists, and I could feel him beginning to pull away, to sit back in the chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Draco,” I whispered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Draco...”</p><p> </p><p>A sound like a whimper escaped his mouth, and he dropped my hands, wrapped his arms around my neck, and suddenly we were kissing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were kissing and kissing and even though I was crouched uncomfortably on the floor, it was the most amazing, beautiful thing ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I moaned around Draco’s lips, shuffling forward on my knees to slot between his legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My arms found their way down around Draco’s waist, drawing him even closer to my body.</p><p> </p><p>I could have kissed Draco Malfoy forever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could have gotten lost in that moment, forgotten about Azkaban and the Dementor’s Kiss, and just stayed snogging Draco, warm and safe and happy. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>But when has my life ever worked that way?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Charlie always used to say, “Ron, if it weren’t for bad luck, you’d have no luck at all.”</p><p> </p><p>All I knew was one second Draco was pushing his hands into my hair, and the next he gripped my shoulders, face pulled back and staring at me with confused trepidation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m....sorry?” he said, almost like a question.</p><p> </p><p>I couldn’t find my voice, so I just shook my head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I meant, ‘no, don’t be sorry!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kiss me again!’ but that didn’t seem to come across.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He dropped his eyes, and they landed on the bag of glasses by his feet on the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A small, crooked smile snuck over his face, and he said quietly, “this is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.”</p><p> </p><p>That jolted me out of my stupor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did Draco think he needed to repay my kindness somehow?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is that why he initiated the kiss?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My head was reeling as I questioned my motives, my behaviour, my expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was I abusing my authority over Draco?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I slid back from his chair quickly, leaving plenty of space in between us. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He gathered the bag and his book, keeping his eyes downcast the entire time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you,” he said, as he stood and made his way from the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He walked slower than usual, and my trembling heart held out hope that he was waiting for something from me.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome,” I said, trying to sound normal and professional.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It didn’t work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Draco nodded, and stepped a little more quickly towards the steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Draco,” I called out, and he stopped at the foot of the stairs, spine tight with tension and still facing away from me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You are worth it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Worth the effort, I mean.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would think I meant the glasses, but I was actually talking about so much more.</p><p> </p><p>I saw his back rise and fall as he took in a big breath, and then continued up the stairs to his bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Hermione showed up at my desk first thing Monday morning, a piece of parchment in her hand and a strange look on her face. “What?” I asked, casting her a distracted smile as I eyed the files in front of me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once again my inbox was overflowing after a hectic weekend on call.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had been tempted more than once to ask Harry for help, but I knew he deserved a break. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Hermione unrolled the parchment and set it in front of me without saying a word.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I paused, slightly fearful, before glancing down at the letter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What could have rendered verbose Hermione Granger speechless?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>To: Hermione Granger,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p><em>I am most thankful for the loan of several books and texts, delivered to me by Ronald Weasley</em>.</p><p> </p><p>‘Muggle Customs for Purebred Dummies’<em> has been particularly enlightening.</em></p><p>

  <em>Draco L. Malfoy</em>
</p><p> </p><p>I huffed out a laugh, because of course ‘Mione would send Draco that book.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Have I told you lately how much I love you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Only last Thursday, when I brought that curry takeout for lunch,” she said, finally smiling and looking more like herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But it’s still nice to hear.</p><p> </p><p>“Ron,” she said, after a slight pause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did you make Malfoy write me this note?”</p><p> </p><p>I shook my head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He asked my to pass along his gratitude, and I suggested he thank you himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had honestly forgotten about that conversation.” Understandable, what with the surprise snogging that happened a day later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I told him he could borrow Pig if he wanted, but he didn’t seem too fussed, at the time.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s face flushed a little, and she picked up the letter, slipping it carefully into her pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s just...it gives me hope.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She stuttered to a stop, trying to find the correct words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Malfoy upset me more than I let on, when we were kids, with his slurs and taunting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t like how low the word Mudblood made me feel everytime it came out of his twisted, snarling lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But at the Manor, he didn’t turn us in, and even though it wasn’t a big show of heroism, and he let his crazy Aunt drag me off, it was still something.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione chewed nervously on her lower lip in an uncharacteristic fashion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Maybe it’s stupid, and maybe I’m naïve, but I’d like to think that Malfoy has some good, and that it’s worth fighting for.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry and I had discussed that exact point multiple times in the past.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes, being an Auror was hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all criminals were inherently evil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some just made bad choices, or had run out of options altogether.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“People can change, Hermione,” I said softly, patting her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He seems different since Azkaban.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quieter, and more aware of other people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m not saying he’s a Saint, but look at James Potter, and Sirius, and Dumbledore.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hoped I wasn’t breaking Harry’s confidence, by bringing this up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“James and Sirius were bullies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dumbledore believed in ‘The Greater Good’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who you are as a teenager doesn’t define your whole life, unless you let it.”</p><p> </p><p>“When did you become so wise?” Hermione wondered, as she reached forward to pat my cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Probably about the same time I was forced to pick up a pile of rag-covered bones from Azkaban,” I replied with little humour. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“You are the perfect example of changing with age.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You we’re always a good boy, Ronald Weasley, but you have grown into a great man.”</p><p> </p><p>If only she knew my secret thought and fantasies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sometimes I’m worried I’m not doing things for the right reasons,” I admitted vaguely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“People keep saying how proud they are of me, but what if I don’t deserve it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if...what if some of my motivations are selfish?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione smiled at me kindly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, Ron, you goose!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone has moments of selfishness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You think I don’t make rash decisions based on my own needs sometimes?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her eyes turned searching, putting me on edge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one knew me better than Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If you are questioning whether your feelings for Draco have influenced you actions; stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Standing up for the people you care about isn’t selfish.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, it’s quite noble in my eyes.”</p><p> </p><p>So I was that transparent, was I?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fuuuuuucck,” I groaned, grinding my teeth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not where I had envisioned this conversation going.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hermione, I don’t...fuck...I just really don’t...”</p><p> </p><p>“Want to like men in general?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or want to like Draco in particular?” she asked calmly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You shouldn’t be ashamed of either.”</p><p> </p><p>I dropped my head into my hands. “I’d actually like to die of embarrassment now, if that’s ok with you?”</p><p> </p><p>That made her laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’ve done much more embarrassing things, and we’ve had much harder conversations, and I’ve always stood by you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s not going to change now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure how I feel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About any of it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Being gay or whatever, liking Draco - now that Hermione had said it out loud, put words to my hidden thoughts, I was terrified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Facing that situation seemed more intimidating than dealing with all the Ministry and Azkaban mess.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fine,” she assured, coming around the desk to give me a hug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Take your time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this is when you need to be selfish, alright?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don’t make decisions based on your friends, or your family, or what’s easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do what’s in your heart, and what will make you happy, in the long run.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy, making someone happy?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Making me happy?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thanks, ‘Mione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Love you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Love you too, Ron.”</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Time was slipping away from me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With less than two weeks left until Draco’s sentencing, I knew I needed to pull everything together into a coherent document, and file the request appropriately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was mostly organized, having gathered the pensive memories I requested and writing out detailed descriptions of each.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Merlin, was that a mind fuck.</p><p> </p><p>Reliving our time at Malfoy Manor, and in the Room of Requirement, chased by Fiendfyre, was one of the worst experiences of my life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More harrowing than living through it the first time, even.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It made fresh the pain of loss, of Hermione’s torture, of Fred dying with a smile on his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My heart felt exposed and flayed in a way I hadn’t had time to experience in the middle of fighting for our lives.</p><p> </p><p>If there was even a sliver of doubt in my mind, as to whether Draco Malfoy was worth the trouble, it was erased by the memories McGonagall provided.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dumbledore’s description of the night on the Astronomy Tower was certainly illuminating, and I was sure it would be extremely useful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But for me, it was Snape’s testimony that resonated the most.</p><p> </p><p>In his eyes, Draco Malfoy was just an innocent boy, led astray by the parents that raised him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Snape himself had made poor choices, and it took the loss of the woman he loved to see the error of his ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not so with Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although Snape did admit to seeing prejudice and spite in the young Slytherin, he also noted his loyalty to his House and his family, even if it meant putting himself at personal risk.</p><p> </p><p>Snape recognized Draco’s reluctance towards the Dark Lord’s cruelty right away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While others were staring at Voldemort with rapt fanatical attention, Snape was furtively watching his young Slytherin charge, noting Draco’s horror at the treatment of prisoners such as the Muggle Studies Professor, and his extreme hesitation in following orders to torture people himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only under threat of harm to his family did Draco perform such spells, and afterwards, he was left weak and trembling, although he found the strength to push Snape away, and refuse his offers of help.</p><p> </p><p>Snape’s version of Draco, of a boy taught Pureblood bigotry from infancy, who still managed to question Voldemort when things were most dire for his family, was vastly different from the heartless, cold-blooded murderer the Ministry chose to portray.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Snape’s last words, spoken to McGonagall loud and clear in his lulling drawl, caused me to question everything I thought I knew - about Draco Malfoy, and myself, and my own choices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Would you have acted any differently, had it been your family’s safety and lives on the line?” Snape had asked, black eyes glaring.</p><p> </p><p>I knew the question wasn’t directed at me personally, but I still couldn’t help but dig for an answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would I have done, on Voldemort’s request, to save my family?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was lucky; I had an army of people I relied on to help me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like Harry and Hermione, Dumbledore and the Order, the DA, as well as my siblings, parents, and their friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who did Draco have?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His parents, who were out of favour with their Lord.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other Death Eaters, who he reviled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A crazy Aunt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Head of House he no longer trusted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A Headmaster, who Draco had never liked, and waited until the last possible moment to offer help.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco Malfoy had been quite alone in the world, trying to save himself and his family.</p><p> </p><p>People like Sirius and Harry had gone against their families, had made choices despite their upbringing, had turned out good in spite of it all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they could do it, why couldn’t Draco?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why had he chosen to be a pretentious git, using his influence and family name to trod on others?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why hadn’t he seen the error of his ways, once away from his parents in Hogwarts?</p><p> </p><p>I finally had an answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sirius and Harry had never been loved by their families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was easy for them, to step away, make a clean break.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From all accounts, Sirius’s mom was a lot like Bellatrix Lestrange; evangelical in her Pureblood bigotry, zealous to the point of madness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She cared little for her two boys, unless they portrayed equal enthusiasm for the hatred of Muggles and Mudbloods.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Poor Regulus parroted her views, tried his best to win her love, only to realize in the end what a huge mistake he had made.</p><p> </p><p>The difference with Draco was that he was loved by his parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They adored him, and he, in turn, adored them right back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just as I learned the way of the world from my family, so did Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just as I never questioned those teachings, neither did Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We didn’t have any reason to, because we both loved and trusted our parents to raise us properly.</p><p> </p><p>I had told Hermione that people could change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did I really believe that Draco Malfoy could overcome a lifetime of Pureblood bigotry?</p><p> </p><p>I wanted the answer to be yes, so very, very badly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it wasn’t even the angelic blond boy I longed for anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, it was just Draco, with his good looks and charm and witty snark, his sneers and smiles, his flair for getting lost in a book, his precise way of eating, his mood swings and his crooked, barely-there grins, his quiet bravery, his silver-grey eyes and his fragile wrists and his ability to make me question things I had never fully contemplated before.</p><p> </p><p>I needed one more thing, for the formal request, before it was submitted to the Ministry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it meant talking frankly to Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn’t entirely ready, still feeling like one harsh word could shatter me after watching those memories in the pensive.</p><p> </p><p>I approached him where he could usually be found in the evenings; curled up in the armchair, new specs on the tip of his nose, deeply engrossed in a book.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tonight it was the aforementioned <em>Muggle Customs for Purebred Dummies, by Margaret St. Mitchell</em>, and my chest tightened at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Draco,” I said peacefully, laying my hand lightly on his arm so as not to startle him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked up at me over the top of his glasses, interest sparking in his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can I ask you a question?”</p><p> </p><p>He gave one of those half-grins, where the corner of his mouth tipped up at one side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I let go of his arm and flopped down on the couch, feeling my head swim, all at the sight of that grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Go for it,” he replied, as he marked his place in the book and laid it on the side table. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Even Pig seemed to pick up on the emotion in the room, and he quit his incessant chattering, fixing his big brown eyes on me in silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What did you want to be when you grew up?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, fucking Merlin, I sounded a right wanker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was something a kid would ask. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The smirk slid off Draco’s face, and he looked lost and hunted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t think that really matters now, do you, Weasley?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeing as I won’t be growing any older.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco’s tone was bitter and cutting, and if it wasn’t for the terror in his eyes, I might not have found the courage to go on.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not a forgone conclusion,” I muttered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco raised one eyebrow at me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wondered if he used to practise that move in the mirror when he was younger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Your sentencing is being protested, remember.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who knows what will happen?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t want to say anything else, in case it all came to shit.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, I’ll pay your little game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you go first.”</p><p> </p><p>“I...uh...ok.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, I wanted to be an Auror, so I...did,” I stuttered, feeling rather exposed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco rolled his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That was lame,” he said mockingly, but with an undercurrent of laughter, so I didn’t feel attacked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, when I was a child, I wanted to be a Quidditch star.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Obviously.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, me too!” I cut in with enthusiasm. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Then it was a famous singer,” Draco continued after shooting me a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Except, I can’t sing to save my life, but I am rather good at the piano, so I decided I would play keyboard in a Wizarding band.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’d tour the world, selling out venues in every country.”</p><p> </p><p>I was swept up in Draco’s narrative, picturing him dressed in designer garb, rocking out on the stage in front of thousands of screaming fans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, the innocence of youth.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s voice turned melancholy as he said, “of course, I never really had a choice in the matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time I went to Hogwarts, I knew I would be following in my Father’s footsteps as an influential politician in the Ministry.”</p><p> </p><p>Gross.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That sounded awful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Was that something you wanted to do?”</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted to make my Father proud,” was his answer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I took that as a no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ok,” I said slowly, thinking fast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If you could do anything, what would you like to do now?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco shook his head, looking totally overwhelmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My future has been mapped out for me for so long, I don’t really know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t even know what my options are.”</p><p> </p><p>How sad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My parents might have been poor, but they had always been supportive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mum gave Charlie a hard time about the dragons, and despaired at the more inflammatory jokes in WWW, but when push comes to shove, they were proud of their kids.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Let’s start with stuff you are good at, or enjoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You were always wicked at potions.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I don’t fancy being a potions maker,” Draco said, wrinkling his nose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s so solitary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless you become a professor, which I would be pants at.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy admitting he wasn’t good at something?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What was the world coming to?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Give it some thought, ok?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And let me know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s kind of important.”</p><p> </p><p>“So this wasn’t just a nice, friendly chat,” Draco stated, tilting his head at me.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” I admitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I did enjoy it!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Very much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially the fluttery feeling that blossomed in the pit of my belly at the sight of Draco’s scrunched up nose.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Draco said, head still tilted, regarding me with a searching look, small smile playing on his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Me too.”</p><p> </p><p>My first wand had been a hand-me-down, as most of my belongings were. When I finally got my own wand, back before third year, I was over the moon with giddiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The feeling you get, when your wand chooses you, is indescribable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A perfusion of warmth and happiness and...rightness?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like everything is right in the world, and you could do anything, accomplish anything, be anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s how I felt, now, looking into Draco’s pretty grey eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smiling back at him.</p><p> </p><p>I became a little panicky, suddenly, worrying about the outcome of my endeavours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would happen if Draco’s sentencing didn’t get overturned?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would I be able to go on?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would I want to?</p><p> </p><p>This couldn’t fail. I couldn’t fail.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>I was awake early the next morning, putting the finishing touches on the paperwork to file at the Ministry later that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were three copies; one for the Wizengamot, one for the Auror’s office, and one for the Minister.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The pensive memories would go directly to Kingsley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the only way to guarantee they wouldn’t get ‘lost’, in light of the corruption at the DMLE.</p><p> </p><p>The investigation Kingsley had opened was still ongoing, in secret, and taking more time than he had planned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shacklebolt encouraged me to submit my document sooner rather than later, as the time left on Malfoy’s appeal was getting short.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He would ensure that the appropriate people saw it, and that it wasn’t swept under the rug by some shady hack looking to pin all the Wizarding world’s troubles on Draco Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>I wasn’t expecting Draco’s presence so early, so when I heard his light footsteps on the stairs, I hastened to organize my paperwork and store it away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He came into the kitchen just as I was shoving it guiltily into my work briefcase, and he gave me a speculative look, but didn’t say anything.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning,” I trilled in an over-jolly tone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cringed inwardly at how fake I sounded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re up early.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco shrugged one shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked nervous, but like he was trying to hide that behind a facade of indifference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I like animals,” he said, staring at the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I replied, before cottoning on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, this was in reply to our conversation last night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wait, really?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I asked, incredulous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I remembered Draco’s piss poor attitude at Hogwarts, belittling Hagrid and acting a total prat in Care of Magical Creatures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Could have fooled me, they way you insulted Buckbeak the Hippogriff.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you think I signed up for that class in the first place?” he asked with a bite in his tone.</p><p> </p><p>It was my turn to shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I dunno.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe for an easy grade?”</p><p> </p><p>The blond snorted and shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, that was you and Potter,” he teased, meeting my eyes finally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I was genuinely interested in learning more about magical creatures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sadly, the newly appointed professor left much to be desired.”</p><p> </p><p>I opened my mouth to defend Hagrid, then shut it with a snap as I recalled the monstrous Skrewts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another memory surfaced, of a young blond boy in tailored black robes and a green Slytherin tie, tongue poking out of the corner of his mouth as he concentrated on illustrating the perfect Bowtruckle drawing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His face had been open and interested when Professor Grubbly-Plank taught the class.</p><p> </p><p>“We had all manner of animals at the Manor,” Draco said, excitement evident in his voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Peacocks and horses and cats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Loads of other birds, like turkeys and Cornish hens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And magical creatures, like kneazles and owls and even a Pegasus!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco’s face was flushed with enthusiasm. I’d never seen him so animated. “I had a pet tortoise, named Terrence, who lived in Mother’s greenhouse.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco’s voice turned wistful, and laced with sorrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He was missing, the last time I was permitted home, at Easter hols.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was almost three years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wonder what happened to him?”</p><p> </p><p>I couldn’t help but smile as I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pictured a fastidious, blond little boy chatting with a tortoise, deciding Terrence would be a clever name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’s probably fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tortoises are notoriously resilient.”</p><p> </p><p>“But what if the Dark Lord found him?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if he killed him, or worse, tortured him?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think that’s highly unlikely,” I said gently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If Voldemort had found him, and known he was precious to you, he would have hung it over your head.”</p><p> </p><p>“Like my parents,” Draco sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the first time we had ever really touched on that horrible, dark era of our history.</p><p> </p><p>“Right,” I replied awkwardly, shifting my eyes around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My gaze landed on the Muggle coffee pot, where the current time was displayed in bright red numbers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had gotten late.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Shit, is that the time?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have to go.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I jumped from my chair, nearly spilling the remains of my cold coffee in the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hastily grabbed my briefcase, and turned towards the floo.</p><p> </p><p>Something made me glance back, and what I saw left a lump in my throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco was still standing by the table, looking unsure and lost.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In two strides, I was in front of him, and I gathered his delicate frame into my arms, engulfing him in a warm Weasley hug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s going to be alright,” I soothed, and although the words were meaningless, I felt him relax in my arms a fraction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I stepped back and gave him a bracing smile, rubbing my hands up and down on his upper arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Trust me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” he whispered, as I found the strength to break away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To charge into the Ministry, with one goal on my mind.</p><p> </p><p>Fucking Godric and all the Founders, I hoped his trust in me wasn’t misguided.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>“Uuuurrgh,” I groaned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Circe’s tits, I felt vile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like I had been run down by a hoard of stampeding, insulted hippogriffs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My head was pounding, my eyes were glued shut, and my mouth was dry and manky. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>So just your average hangover, really.</p><p> </p><p>Sitting up brought on a whole new set of problems, as the world around me started to spin, even with my eyes scrunched tightly shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took three “Accio Hangover Potion” spells squeezed croakily from my sore throat before I heard a bottle rattle it’s way into my hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the blessed Potion took affect, I was able to pry an eye open and survey my surroundings. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I was in the Ministry, that was obvious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I vaguely recalled forcefully telling Harry and Hermione that I would be sleeping in the office, as I wished to receive news on Draco’s case as soon as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, I was not in my own cubicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Further investigation revealed that I had slept curled under the desk in Dad’s Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office, using my cloak as a blanket and a poorly transfigured houseplant as a pillow.</p><p> </p><p>Ah, good ole Harry and Hermione, my best mates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had completed my paperwork requesting a review of Draco’s sentencing late Tuesday afternoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After submitting the documents to the proper departments, and logging the memory vials with Shacklebolt and his Administrator, my two best friends had taken me out for a celebratory drink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which turned into celebratory drinks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which led to straight-laced Hermione dancing drunkenly on the table, while I waxed poetic about Draco Malfoy to Harry Potter, of all people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Godric’s saggy sac, what a night. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It was still unreasonably early, leaving the halls of the Ministry mostly empty, much to my good fortune.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was able to slip into my workspace unnoticed. Imagine my surprise when my chair twirled around and spoke to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good morning, Ronald.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus bloody buggering fuck on a flaming broomstick,” I swore, while jumping a good foot in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My heart sped ahead so fast, I thought it would propel itself from my body.</p><p> </p><p>“Lumos,” said the chair in a melodic, deep voice, revealing the Minister for Magic himself, bedecked in plush chocolate robes and a bemused look on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What an interesting mix of Muggle and Wizarding cuss words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t know your vocabulary was so diverse.”</p><p> </p><p>I answered with a two fingered salute, as I was busy catching my breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably not the most professional behaviour, but as Kingsley smiled back widely, I didn’t think there was any harm done.</p><p> </p><p>“I know your work day hasn’t technically started, but Harry told me I could find you here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kingsley paused, and adopted an authoritative tone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We arrested Finnigan O’Stewart last night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was an employee-“</p><p> </p><p>“In the DMLE,” I finished, my mind racing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, I’ve heard that name from Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She didn’t-“</p><p> </p><p>“Like him?” Shaklebolt asked, cutting me off this time with a smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She’d suspected him of being crooked for a long time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We have Hermione to thank for his arrest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That woman keeps meticulous records.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll bet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione’s motto at Hogwarts had been, ‘why write the assigned one foot essay length when there was enough information to fill two or three rolls of parchment?’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Always the over-achiever.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s our guy, Ron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>O’Stewart was the mastermind behind the improper prisoner placements.”</p><p> </p><p>Now we were making progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What was in it for him?”</p><p> </p><p>Kingsley’s mouth curled down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Bribes,” he said with disgust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Certain... dishonourable Aurors were paying for the chance to host death row prisoners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>O’Stewart in turn trickled money down to old Roddick in Azkaban.”</p><p> </p><p>“Bloody hell,” I whispered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were people I worked with, chatted with, shared tea and snacks with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People I trusted to have my back in the line of duty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, in general as Aurors, to believe and work towards making the word a better place.</p><p> </p><p>“O’Stewart is not the self-sacrificing type.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’ll have names of the culpable Aurors and Wizengamot members in no time.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kingsley clapped me on the back bracingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This can only help Malfoy’s case.”</p><p> </p><p>Speaking of which... “have you heard anything, since I filed the paperwork?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mouth was dry again, and my hands started to shake, although my hangover was gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was just that nervous.</p><p> </p><p>“The Wizengamot has set Draco Malfoy’s sentencing for Monday at ten o’clock.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could only imagine what my face must have looked like as I dropped into the spare chair at Shacklebolt’s news.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, just wait, Ron.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don’t jump to conclusions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I spoke to someone I trust on the Wizengamot, and she assured me that they are handling Draco’s appeal with the utmost attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is their top priority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Monday is just a deadline, for making a decision.”</p><p> </p><p>Making a decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah, right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Picking between a Firebolt and a Cleansweep, that was a decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Choosing to have an appetizer and skip dessert, that was a decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But sentencing a young adult to a fate worse than death, to live soulless, a shell of his former self, how was that just ‘making a decision’?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What are the chances that the appeal will work?” I asked, trying to keep the despair out of my voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Honestly, Ron, I believe the odds of Draco receiving The Kiss are slim to nil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Wizengamot will convene today, with the sole purpose of reading each and every word you submitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They have requested access to the memory vials on Friday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All in all, it’s looking very positive, especially if the tainted members can be removed promptly.”</p><p> </p><p>I nodded, unable to trust myself to speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll leave you to it,” Kingsley said gently, rising from my chair.</p><p> </p><p>He had almost reached the entrance when I called out, “Wait!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was one little detail that niggled at my mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“O’Stewart didn’t get a bribe from me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why did he place Malfoy in my care?”</p><p> </p><p>Kingsley smiled sadly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You have Hermione to thank for that, as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She suggested you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, between you, me, and the cloak stand, she slipped him a little something to ensure it would happen.”</p><p> </p><p>Law-abiding Hermione Granger bribed her boss?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And kept this whole thing quiet from me?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was shocked for a moment, until I remembered how long she had Rita Skeeter locked up in a jar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She won’t get in trouble, will she?”</p><p> </p><p>Kingsley scoffed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s doubtful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if she does, it will be a slap on the wrist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s more likely that she will be promoted to fill Finnigan O’Stewart’s position within the DMLE.”</p><p> </p><p>As Kingsley took his leave, I felt a rush of magic skim lightly over me. My wrinkled, slept in robes had straightened and become decidedly fresher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ta, Minister.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The man winked, billowing out into the hallway in a Snape-like fashion, his own robes flaring dramatically around him despite the early hour. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Some people just had style.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>I was a useless tit for the rest of the work day, and I knew it wouldn’t get any better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Luckily, I had Friday off, in lieu of working all last weekend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I put in a vacation request for Thursday, and my official boss, Head Auror Robards, approved the time off within ten minutes.</p><p> </p><p>It was the first time in my tenor at the DMLE that he saw fit to visit my lowly Junior Auror self in my cubicle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Usually I got hauled into his office for a telling off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Look, Weasley, everyone can see you are running yourself ragged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Take a few days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you need Monday off, too?”</p><p> </p><p>Monday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Merlin, was I dreading Monday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll be escorting Draco Malfoy to his sentencing hearing on Monday,” I reminded him tightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Right,” Robards said slowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know he was a classmate of yours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You weren’t close, were you?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What with him being on the wrong side of the war and all.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked at me expectantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“It’s complicated,” I replied, after a pause.</p><p> </p><p>“It always is.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The older man offered me a rare smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s almost five.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Go home, Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Enjoy your weekend. I’ll see you on Monday.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, sure, see you Monday,” I said vaguely, waving a hand in his general direction as he left.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would I see him Monday?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Robards wasn’t one of the crooked Aurors, was he?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was a bit of a cranky old fuss-pot, but I liked him, really.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was tough but fair, kind of like Professor McGonagall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please, please let this man I looked up to not turn out to be a corrupt nutter.</p><p> </p><p>After one quick stop at the Thai West Cafe for our evening meal, I headed straight home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watching Draco try new foods and flavours was one of my favourite things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a great deal of contemplating and sniffing involved before the food even hit his mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took small bites, chewing intently, a look of concentration wrinkling his brow. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Tonight was no different, as he pondered the plate of food in front of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not bad, Weasley,” was the final verdict, and I felt a smile creep over my face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I pushed off the counter where I had been leaning, and dished up my own plate.</p><p> </p><p>“You have a little something, just there,” Draco said, reaching across our food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was unprepared for the touch; a thumb grazed lightly over my cheek bone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rolling warmth flooded my belly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted to grab his hand, kiss his thumb, his palm, his wrist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His touch had been so soft, like I was a precious thing worthy of delicacy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t take my eyes off of his.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is it...I think it’s dirt,” he whispered, dropping his hand but not his gaze.</p><p> </p><p>I flushed with embarrassment, breaking eye contact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I kinda slept on a spider plant last night,” I said, scrubbing at my cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had I really been walking around all day with soil on my face?</p><p> </p><p>Draco looked horrified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You slept on a spider...plant?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What does that mean, does it grow spiders?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He shuddered.</p><p> </p><p>Well that was just my worst nightmare come to life!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No,” I said with a snicker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s just a common Muggle houseplant. Dad keeps one in his office.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had a minor transfiguration catastrophe.”</p><p> </p><p>The remainder of our meal was filled with laughter and pleasant chatter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt like any other evening with a friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wished I could lie to myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Close my eyes and forget the collar around Draco’s slender neck, and just enjoy the moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As fate would have it, I didn’t even get the chance.</p><p> </p><p>A large, sturdy brown owl tapped at the kitchen window, demanding entrance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recognized it as an eagle owl, the type the Ministry kept and used to deliver correspondence. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Have you got something for me?” I crooned as I opened the window.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the owl just flew over my head and landed on Draco’s shoulder, thrusting a leg forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco gently untied the letter, and gave the owl an ear rub and a noodle as a reward.</p><p> </p><p>Draco unrolled the parchment carefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What could this be?” he wondered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was sure I could hear a little hope in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>I watched that hope fade and die in front of me as Draco read the letter, his face going from a flushed pink to blanched and ashen in a matter of moments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pushed back from the table, sending a little half bow my way, as he said, “I’m feeling a little under the weather.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please excuse me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I nodded dumbly.</p><p> </p><p>Was it an invasion of privacy, to read the letter myself?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, Draco’d left it there on the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s like he wanted me to see it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There was no mention made of the appeal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No wonder Draco was shitting it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, on the bright side, there was also no mention of Dementors or Kisses or soul-sucking either. So, not so bad. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>What would I want, in such a situation?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Comfort, from a loved one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Distraction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe a nice little snack.</p><p> </p><p>I pulled one of Mum’s cinnamon rolls out of the freezer and heated it up, along with a sugary cup of tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I took a deep breath, and went upstairs to knock on Draco’s door.</p><p> </p><p>Truthfully, I had always been pants at comforting people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like a Niffler in a jewelry store, I ran amuck, running roughshod over people’s feelings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Auror training had taught me a little about relating to others, and how to properly convey compassion and empathy, but I was still stilted and awkward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Emotionally relating to people was not one of my inborn talents.</p><p> </p><p>I needn’t have worried, as Draco didn’t answer my knocking on his door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no relief in that at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I found myself wishing for a caustic ‘go away Weasley’, or a screamed ‘leave me alone Weasel’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anything would have been better than stifling silence.</p><p> </p><p>I could have just opened the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was my house, my guest bedroom, and Draco was a prisoner under my care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t have protested.</p><p> </p><p>But here was the problem; I didn’t view Draco Malfoy as just a prisoner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not for a while.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wouldn’t invade his space without an invitation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m going to leave some tea and a snack outside your door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just in case you feel like it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks Ron,” came the quick reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was faint but audible, and sounded like it had come from just the other side of the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I pictured Draco in a pose similar to my own, leaning on the door, forehead pressed to the wood, wanting something he knew he couldn’t have, and my heart ached for us both.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>That night I thought a lot about my last conversation with Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About liking blokes, and liking Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d’ve liked to say it was just Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That when I was young,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I chose the least attainable person, and decided to torture myself with his unavailability. Maybe it was just another circumstance of my upbringing; thinking I was unworthy, or undeserving of love.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Choosing someone who was never a viable option.</p><p> </p><p>That was the coward’s way out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was still working to overcome my tendency to blame other people for my problems and misfortunes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t pin my pining after Draco Malfoy for seven years on my parents, though, could I?</p><p> </p><p>Maybe the impossibility of Draco reciprocating was an excuse, at first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I was quickly drawn in by his highborn good looks, his evident self confidence. He was my opposite, and I yearned to be like him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe just to have him, for myself.</p><p> </p><p>And, to be truthful, I hadn’t been immune to the attractiveness of blokes like Oliver Wood and Cedric Diggory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They just never held my interest like Draco, never ignited that spark in my belly that threatened to consume my soul.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco’s smug face left me questioning if I should punch him or kiss him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only the threat of utter humiliation held me back from the latter, at times.</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing wrong with girls, either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much to the chagrin of everyone in the Gryffindor common room, I found I greatly enjoying fondling Lavender Brown’s bits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And of course there was Hermione, who I loved with my whole heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Being intimate with her had been amazing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the only time we truly connected in a proper boyfriend-girlfriend way.</p><p> </p><p>So I guess I liked both?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was that even a thing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione would obviously know, but I decided I didn’t really care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What felt wrong and embarrassing as a child had shifted from a well guarded secret into a mature feeling I was proud of.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My obsession with a pretty blond boy had grown; morphed and changed until it made sense to like the man he had become.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>It was weird, spending the day with Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was used to working all manner of odd and unusual hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And of course on my days off, there was brunch at the Burrow, time spent catching up with Harry and Hermione, and the usual household tasks like grocery shopping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d never really just...hung around the house for hours at a time, watching the man staying with me.</p><p> </p><p>He seemed a little out of sorts at first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like he should be doing something different, because I was there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I did my best to stay unobtrusive. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After a long shower, I killed some time tidying the bathroom and my bedroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I had run out of towels to fold upstairs, I ventured down to the living room, hoping Draco had settled into my presence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I paused at the doorway, captivated by the enchanting sight before me.</p><p> </p><p>Pig was sitting on the arm of Draco’s chair, staring at the blond with his big yellow eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d never seen the owl so focused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He let out a soft hoot, and Draco answered with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good morning, noble little bird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do you do?”</p><p> </p><p>Another hoot from Pig, this time much more excited and squeaky, and the tiny owl bobbed up and down a couple of times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I agree, it is a lovely morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What should we do today?” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I was charmed, watching Draco Malfoy chat formally with Pig.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too often I got annoyed by the little fluff ball, which was awful, considering how hard he tried.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When was the last time I gave the owl more than a moment of my attention?</p><p> </p><p>Pig squawked, and jumped onto Draco’s shoulder, nibbling gently on his ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then I heard the loveliest sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A light, lilting laugh, so uncharacteristic of the cunning boy I knew at school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked marvellous that way, his smile stretched wide in laughter, neck crooked down to snuggle with the little bird jockeying for his attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then Draco made a new noise, and his early laughter became the second most beautiful thing I’d ever heard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because when he cooed to my owl, I lost my breath. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Stop, you naughty bird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That tickles,” Draco giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dear Merlin, Draco Malfoy giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With my owl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was this a prank?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was George going to jump out from the floo, screaming ‘gotcha!’ while laughing his fool head off?</p><p> </p><p>After I regained control of myself, we had a lot of fun. I challenged Draco to Wizarding chess, and was blown away by his strategy and cunning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco introduced me to crossword puzzles, which were not my strong suit, but enjoyable all the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later, I ordered in pizza, and set up a Muggle movie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco picked apart the first piece, trying every topping separately, before munching his way through three more slices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I loved watching him eat, especially now that his appetite was more in-tuned with a normal man in their twenties.</p><p> </p><p>The movie ended, and neither of us made a move to get ready for bed, although the hour had grown late.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the minutes ticked by, I could sense Draco getting tense, as if working up to something.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Still, when he did speak, it took me by surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I wanted to thank you, Weasley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For treating me like a human being these last few weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know having me here couldn’t have been easy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you...er...are a human being?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck, why did that come out as a question? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco just grinned sardonically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not in the eyes of anyone at Azkaban,” he replied, and I shivered, remembering the horrid condition he came to me in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The Aurors, the Wizengamot; they all viewed me as scum, not worthy of the space and oxygen I was consuming.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The words were bitter, but his tone was matter-of-fact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Even my own Father stopped seeing me as his son.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I became a means to an end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A way to get back into the Dark Lord’s good graces, and save the Malfoy name.”</p><p> </p><p>Wow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could totally relate to Draco Malfoy, and wasn’t that terrifying?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably my biggest fear in Hogwarts had been being overlooked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Being the written-off Weasley, with no real talent or ability.</p><p> </p><p>I was so lost in my train of thought, I nearly missed Draco’s hushed confession.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s why I kissed you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My head snapped up in shock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried to meet his eyes, but he was steadfastly avoiding my gaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I kept expecting you to be cruel, or mocking, but you just...you just kept doing nice things for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fixing my hair, getting me books, bringing home all those Muggle glasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Salazar, Weasley, no one’s ever looked after me like that before.”</p><p> </p><p>“But...but you were so spoiled,” I sputtered.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess,” he shrugged nonchalantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even Draco’s casual mannerisms were effortlessly elegant.</p><p> </p><p>“You had everything, and it was all perfect and brand new!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sourness filled my insides as I remembered a hand-me-down wand, patched haphazardly with cello tape.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Slugs pouring out of my mouth, as the boy in front of me laughed and laughed, twirling his shiny wand between his fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Robes, brooms, boxes of sweets. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would have done unscrupulous things for that stuff, and you had it all just handed to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you’re saying...what?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco finally met my eyes, and his tone was earnest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve had possessions thrown at me by my parents since I can remember.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before I could talk or walk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then, once I could, my every demand for material goods was met.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I’ve realized that they never really cared to know me, the real me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To be privy to my thoughts and fears, my longings and desires, my secrets and weaknesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a superficial relationship; with my Father especially.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I don’t doubt in my parent’s love for me, I do question their perception of who I am, or who I was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No doubt I’m partially to blame.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I played the role of obedient son well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mostly because that was what I had been taught, from birth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But deep down, there was a little boy who just wanted to be understood by the people closest to him.</p><p>
  <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p><p>“So, what I’m saying,” Draco continued, after a loaded pause, “is that being spoiled doesn’t compare to you just...caring for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Figuring out what I needed, or what would make me happy, and doing it, just because.”</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, the sourness left my stomach, replaced by a burning sensation in my chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One that made it hard to draw air into my lungs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now I was the one actively avoiding eye contact.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry if I’ve made you uncomfortable,” Draco said quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That wasn’t my intention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the record, heartfelt confessions are not typical conversation for me.”</p><p> </p><p>I could feel his eyes on me, sizing me up, waiting for me to react.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here was my chance, if I could just grab it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I was suddenly terrified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All those times I’d called Malfoy a coward, and in the end, I was the one running away when things got heavy.</p><p> </p><p>From the corner of my eye I saw him squeeze his eyes shut tight and grimace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I still couldn’t reach out and respond.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, I mumbled the weakest, “you’re welcome,” in answer to his earlier thanks, and sat stiff and unmoving until he gathered himself up and moved away with a whispered goodnight.</p><p> </p><p>An immeasurable amount of time passed as I sat on the sofa and despaired my life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t stop thinking about Draco, and the more I thought, the more my chest burned. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Finally I mounted the stairs the to bed, encased in total darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It matched my mood perfectly.</p><p> </p><p>As I reached the top step, a sliver of light appeared, growing progressively wider as the door to Draco’s room opened, and the lone occupant slipped out into the hallway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He startled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>slightly when he noticed me at the end of the hall, standing motionless watching him.</p><p> </p><p>Merlin, he was lovely: long white blond hair in a messy top knot, too big pajama bottoms hanging off his bony hips, baggy t-shirt engulfing his slight frame.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was rumpled and slightly messy and still underweight, but in my eyes, he was the most beautiful creature in existence.</p><p> </p><p>“I was just...” Malfoy said hesitantly, motioning absently with his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What he was on his way to do, I never found out, as I rushed down the hall in three quick steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything seemed to happen at once: I grabbed his wrist, circling my fingers around it, and pulled him forward a step.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His body crashed into mine as I brought my other hand up to his face, curving my palm around his cheek and jaw.</p><p> </p><p>“I like caring for you,” I said, as I tucked a stray lock of silvery hair behind his ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I like having you here.”</p><p> </p><p>His eyes were wide, pupils blown out, as he looked at me, wanting it all to be true.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He licked his lips nervously, and my gaze fell to his mouth, watching his plump, pink tongue smooth over his skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt hot and hungry, and somewhat feral, and that all must have shown in my expression, because Draco let out a small whimper, and I lost all control, grabbing both wrists and backing him firmly into my bedroom, where we landed on the bed in a heap of tangled limbs.</p><p> </p><p>I wanted to take my time, to savour the moment, worship every inch of his milky skin, now healed from the abuse of Azkaban.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I didn’t. I couldn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was frantic, and Draco was worked up right along with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can I?” I gasped out, not knowing what I was even asking for.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” he panted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes to everything.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I crushed his mouth with a bruising kiss, relishing the fight I felt in his lips, battling mine for control. He wrenched away, grey eyes gleaming silver in the moonlight, and asked, “do you want to-“</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” I cut him off, echoing his early response.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes to everything.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t slow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t pretty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was two bodies, in a frenzy of need, thrusting and panting and clutching, never really finding a rhythm but delighting in the messiness and chaos.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was shirts ripped off, warm skin on skin contact, rolling hips and harsh biting kisses and rushed ecstasy.</p><p> </p><p>He looked up at me with longing and satisfaction, his eyes rolling back in his head, and then he smiled at me, that true smile I’d only seen on the Quidditch pitch, the one of utter happiness, and I knew that I could fall for this man, this broken, wrecked man underneath me who was my boyhood crush, in all his snarky Slytherin beauty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The man who couldn’t make toast and cooed to my owl and wormed his way into my every waking thought.</p><p> </p><p>I leaned over a sucked a particularly aggressive love bite onto his slender neck. I was depraved, like an animal, wanting to own every inch of Draco Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He arched up against me, back bowed off the bed, mouth open and eyes slammed shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A perfect little “oh” escaped his lips as he climaxed, and I could feel the warm wetness through the multiple layers of clothing still covering our cocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I gripped his wrists and pushed them over his head on the bed, feeling his thready pulse trill along like a hummingbird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hadn’t come in my trousers since fourth year, when Fleur and Krum joined my nighttime dreams of Draco, and I’d wake up in a patch of drying stickiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But when Draco opened his eyes, gave me a languid smile, and said “Ron” like a caress, I felt my balls draw up and my own orgasm overtook me, as I thrust against Draco’s wet crotch like a man possessed.</p><p> </p><p>That fevered coupling was not at all how I had imagined having sex with Draco Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Usually in my schoolboy dreams Malfoy worked my cock slowly, almost sadistically, gripping so hard the line between pain and pleasure blurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donning Slytherin robes, hair slicked back and gleaming, he’d gaze down at me apathetically, dragging my foreskin over the swollen head of my prick, an aggressive twist to his wrist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not yet, Weasel.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d push me to the edge of release, only to slow down even further, using the lightest pressure, until my impending orgasm receded, and he’d start the whole thing over, a snarky look on his face. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Thank Godric reality far outstripped my sadistic adolescent fantasies.</p><p> </p><p>Finally I caught my breath, and shifted so as not to crush the man under me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I dropped a hand onto his stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That was...” words failed me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mind-blowing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Earth-shattering?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Embarrassingly fast? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Fingers threaded through mine on Draco’s abdomen, creating a giddy fluttering in my stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A long time coming,” he finished, giving my hand a squeeze.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, like half a lifetime.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco went still as he held his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>Blood flushed my cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Godric fuck, why could I never keep my big mouth shut?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, it turns out, I’ve l..l..liked you since first year.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mouth stuttered over the ‘L’ word.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Liked didn’t seem right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I liked my friends, Neville and Luna and the rest. Draco was different, always had been.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Love wasn’t right either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t love the git, back in Hogwarts, when he made me miserable with his cutting taunts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But now?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could I love Draco Malfoy now?</p><p> </p><p>Draco turned on his side and looked at me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Really?” he asked with a smile, and there was no trace of mocking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I was such a dick.”</p><p> </p><p>“Still are,” I quipped, earning an eye roll from the blond.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It was a fantasy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knew it wasn’t real.”</p><p> </p><p>Long fingers swept the sweaty fringe off of my forehead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It is now,” he said simply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What took you so long?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve been wanting you since the evening you fixed my hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two hours of your fingers on my scalp!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I nearly melted into a puddle at you feet.”</p><p> </p><p>I filed that information away for later; Draco enjoyed having his hair played with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then a crushing realization hit me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no ‘later’ for me and Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All we had left was the weekend.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn’t going to let anything ruin the precious little time we had together, my own moroseness included.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s real now, isn’t it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Us?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t keep the wonder out of my voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco didn’t answer, just snuggled deeper into my side with his pointy little chin resting on my chest where my arm met my body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It should have been uncomfortable, but it was surprisingly cozy, with our legs tangled together and our hands still clasped tight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I pressed a small kiss to the top of his head, right where the topknot had been before it came loose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After everything that had happened, all the confessions made and kisses shared and bare skin touched, the simple brush of my lips to his hair still felt achingly intimate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like I was sharing a private little piece of myself with Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One I could never get back, if it was rejected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His answering huff of contentment, blown in a puff of breath on my bare chest, and the smile I felt curl on his lips, made the gesture more than worthwhile.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Being woken by a Ministry owl was not an unusual experience, but this time, my nerves were singing an anxious tune before I was even fully awake. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I ripped open the parchment before I had time to second guess my actions.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>I turned to Draco, who sat tucked up by the headboard of my bed, knees drawn up under his chin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Anything important?” he asked, feigning indifference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could see right though the charade.</p><p> </p><p>“See for yourself,” I grinned, as I plopped the letter onto his knees. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A squeak broke from his lips as he launched himself out of the bed without warning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Weasley, I don’t care if your garden is an overgrown mess filled with Devil’s Snare and Carnivorous Lilies, I will be spending the day there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outside.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He said the last word reverently. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Lucky for you, I have a hired gardener who keeps everything in top shape.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No need to mention the gardener was Neville Longbottom, and that I hired him as a favour, to help his fledgling business grow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result was a beautiful space, filled with magic and muggle plants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco would love it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco bounced on his tip-toes, practically vibrating with eager energy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He really was quite like his younger cousin Teddy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Have a shower,” I said with a smile as I watched him from the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll meet you outside with breakfast.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outside. Ok, yes,” he muttered as he walked to the hallway. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I kept breakfast simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just toast and jam and sliced tomatoes, with pots of tea and coffee suspended in warmth under stasis charms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I loved tea, but I was used to the strong brewed coffee of the Auror office in the morning, it’s bitterness cut slightly by a splash of flavoured creamer.</p><p> </p><p>Draco hesitated at the garden door, perhaps suspicious that this was all an elaborate prank set up by Harry Potter to see him knocked on his ass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He visibly steeled himself with a large intake of air, and stepped outside for the first time in years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He closed his eyes, and took another deep breath, his body shuddering slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That smell...the flowers...the grass...the fragrance,” he said, totally overwhelmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I forgot.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes popped back open and he looked at me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I forgot that air could smell so sweet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A tear tracked down his cheek, getting lost in the corner of his mouth where his lips had started to turn up in a tentative smile.</p><p> </p><p>I jumped from my seat and bustled him over to the patio, where breakfast was waiting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Enjoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You have all day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All night too, if you want.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the next day, and the next.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t want to think any further than that.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” he replied with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I willed myself to silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted Draco to do what he wanted today.</p><p> </p><p>Mostly that entailed strolling around, sticking his face into bushes and flowers, lightly trailing his fingers over various plants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually Draco lay down in the middle of the garden on the sun-warmed grass, flat on his back and spread out like a starfish.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After long moments of watching him, I found myself getting sleepy in the summer heat, and dozed off.</p><p> </p><p>When I awoke from my nap, Pig had joined us in the garden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco still lay on the ground, but had pulled his legs in, and the little owl sat perched on his knees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was ridiculous, how much I enjoyed seeing Draco interact with my owl.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” I exclaimed, as an idea popped into my head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I should go to the Manor, see if I can find Terrence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could live here, in the garden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione could help me set up some sort of environmental charm, to regulate the temperature and humidity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or, I could build a small greenhouse,” I said, deep in thought. Neville would know what I needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nothing fancy, mind you, but it might make him feel more at home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I suppose I could - umpft-“.</p><p> </p><p>I was cut off mid sentence by Draco launching himself into my lap, pressing hard, emotive kisses all over my cheeks, eyelids, forehead and jaw.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gripped my face, leaning his forehead onto mine, and said, “do you have any idea how special you are, Weasley?”</p><p> </p><p>Me, special?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d never really felt it, even as part of the Golden Trio.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No matter the situation; sibling, Quidditch, Auror, saving the world; I was never the star, or the recognized person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My name was always linked with others, whose deeds were way more exciting than my own.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t think so,” he smirked, and brushed his lips over mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If you could only see yourself the way I do, you’d have no doubt.”</p><p> </p><p>Something inside me thawed just then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was like stepping into the sun after a particularly bitter winter day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe like finally venturing outside after two years of captivity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cares and worries I had been dragging around since childhood suddenly seemed less important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Last night, I had given Draco the gift of being seen as a worthy person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, he was doing the same for me, and it wasn’t even something I knew I needed, until it happened.</p><p> </p><p>“Kiss me,” I demanded, voice choked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Kiss me like you mean it.”</p><p> </p><p>He pressed his lips firmly to mine, giving me a sweet, chaste kiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I do mean it,” he replied, with utter sincerity. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Being snogged in a garden chair was not the most comfortable sexual experience of my life, but it was the most intimate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It didn’t matter that the chair arm dug into my side, or that Draco towered over me and had to bend at an awkward angle to continue our kiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In that moment, we were both seen, and we were both deserving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it was all I had ever longed for.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the weekend flew by in a dizzying whirl of fresh air, flowers, and kisses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sunday at the Burrow was skipped in favour of prolonging my short time with Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the first time since leaving Hogwarts that I had missed brunch for a non-work related purpose. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Neither one of us slept much on Sunday evening, despite spending the day outside engaged in physical activity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally at seven I hauled myself out of bed and started to get ready.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco followed suit, and we both got dressed in silence.</p><p> </p><p>The easy rapport of the weekend was gone, smothered by the unknown future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn’t put off facing it any longer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could actually lose Draco today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would fight tooth and nail against it, but in the end, if the Wizengamot ruled to carry out the Kiss, there was nothing I could do.</p><p> </p><p>My eyes prickled with tears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could not let Draco see me like this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had to be strong, and believe that there would be a happy ending.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or at least not a tragic one.</p><p> </p><p>I plastered on a smile and went to his room, knocking on the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco stepped out of the bedroom, wearing the robes we had agreed on last night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were old ones of mine, never worn because I found the silken material too fancy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had transfigured them to fit Draco’s frame, and changed the colour from a royal blue to the dusky grey he requested, a few shades darker than his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a hue that would look dull hanging on a sale rack, but looked ravishing on Draco.</p><p> </p><p>We were silent as we made our way from the Ministry floo, towards the courtrooms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the doorway of courtroom four, I paused, and gripped Draco’s hand, giving it one sharp, tight squeeze before letting go and walking through the door.</p><p> </p><p>I let out a thankful sigh as I took in courtroom four.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dad had told me all about Harry’s brush with the Wizengamot, in the huge trial courtroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Room four was more like a meeting space, with a large, rectangular table at the center and many chairs lined up on either side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One side was occupied with people, all wearing the same plum coloured robes that distinguished members of the Wizengamot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the head of the table sat a bright looking witch, who introduced herself as Isabella Butterfree, the new Head Witch of the Wizengamot, and directed us to sit down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’ve declined your right to lawyer representation, Mr. Malfoy?” she asked in a precise manner. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco nodded, then cleared his throat and answered “yes”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His voice only shook a tiny bit.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,” she said, with a nod of her own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Let’s get right to it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ms. Butterfree shuffled through some papers in front of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m newly appointed to the Chief Wizengamot position, following some internal restructuring.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A nice way gloss over the corruption in the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Let me make sure I have the facts of the case straight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In short, you’ve been sentenced to the Dementor’s Kiss, for crimes committed during the second Wizarding war in the UK.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A motion to review your sentencing was recently filed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you agree with that summary, Mr. Malfoy?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco watched sceptically as a charmed quill recorded the proceedings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, I agree.”</p><p> </p><p>“Very good,” came the clipped reply of the Wizengamot witch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We have reviewed your case, Mr. Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The initial crimes you were charged with happened when you were underage, did they not?”</p><p> </p><p>“That is correct,” Draco answered in his posh Malfoy voice.</p><p> </p><p>“And the latter crimes, the murders, they took place when you were an adult.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did you kill any of those people directly, Mr. Malfoy?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With your wand, or by any other means, magical or muggle.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Draco said.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Ms. Butterfree repeated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She removed her glasses and rubbed the spot above her nose, between her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mr. Malfoy, I’m afraid a terrible injustice has befallen you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not the modus operandi of the Wizengamot to sentence underage wizards to the Dementor’s Kiss, nor to pin violent crimes on convenient scapegoats.</p><p> </p><p>“After thoroughly reviewing your appeal, including character witness testimony from several upstanding members of the Wizarding community, both living and dead,” her mouth twitched a tiny bit, like she was biting back a smile, “we, the members of the Wizengamot, have ruled that your time served in Azkaban is sufficient punishment for your boyhood crimes.”</p><p> </p><p>Was she...did that mean...Draco wasn’t going to be Kissed?</p><p> </p><p>“You will remain in Ministry custody for six months, during which time you will prove your worth to the Wizarding community by excelling in a work placement.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ms. Butterfree shuffled her papers again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ah, yes, here it is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Magical Mishaps Animal Rehab has agreed to take you on.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked across the table at Draco, her stern expression very much reminiscent of Professor McGonagall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You will work hard, but you will also not do anything that you are uncomfortable with, or puts you in danger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you understand?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco nodded, seemingly at a loss for words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a lot to take in.</p><p> </p><p>“Excellent,” Ms. Butterfree stated, rising up from the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She reached forward to shake Draco’s hand as the other members of the Wizengamot started to shuffle in their seats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good luck, Mr. Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have great faith in you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She turned to me and said, “a quick side note: never have I ever been presented with such a thorough, well prepared legal appeal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pass on my kudos, Auror Weasley.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And with a wink thrown my way, she strode out of the room.</p><p> </p><p>The members of the Wizengamot took their leave, murmuring “good luck” and “best wishes” under their breath as they passed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few even stopped to shake Draco’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>Then it was just us, alone in the courtroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco looked ready to fall over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn’t surprised when he muttered “Salazar,” and slid down into his chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He turned his face and gazed up at me, his mouth creasing up in a huge smile that was growing by the second.</p><p> </p><p>I crouched down in front of him, placing my hands on his knees, and smiled back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We must have looked like a couple of loons, but I didn’t give a single fuck. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Something shifted, and the air seemed charged with electricity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco’s smile slipped slightly, and he bit his bottom lip, his grey eyes turning stormy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The night of our first kiss came rushing back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here we were, in the same positions, and all those feelings, of longing and tenderness and acceptance, they were still there, stronger than ever, making it hard to breath or concentrate on anything besides Draco sodding Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>It had always been Draco sodding Malfoy, hadn’t it?</p><p> </p><p>I leaned in, running my hands up his thighs as I did so, my body tingling in anticipation of this kiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe our last kiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“Hurumh.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Someone cleared their throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were not alone.</p><p> </p><p>I peeked over Draco’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kingsley Shacklebolt was leaning on the courtroom door, his cheeks rather red and eyes averted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How...how long have you been standing there?” I gasped.</p><p> </p><p>“I was waiting for the Wizengamot verdict.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m here to escort Mr. Malfoy to his work placement.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kingsley met my eyes with a wide, innocent look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“As Minister for Magic, I don’t really have time for such duties.  Hopefully we find an appropriate candidate to fill that job soon.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pushy bugger. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco stood, back ramrod straight, looking tall and regal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m ready, Minister,” he said deferentially.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>As he slipped out the door, I heard it again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A faint “thank you,” uttered so quietly, like that first day all those weeks ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except this time, Draco added one word at the end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ron”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And even with his hushed tone, I could hear the warmth Draco infused into those three words.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome,” I answered, although I was once again not sure if he heard me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Draco”.</p><p> </p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>EPILOGUE - Six Months Later</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <b>Auror Ronald Weasley Transforms Azkaban Prison</b> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ok, so it was the typical inflammatory headline favoured by the Prophet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still, there was a kernel of truth there, and I couldn’t help but feel proud.</p><p> </p><p>I had taken Minister Shacklebolt up on his employment offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My official title was Law Enforcement Liaison Auror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, Auror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was a Junior Auror no longer.</p><p> </p><p>My new job was taxing, and it kept me on my toes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the cool thing was, the position was brand new, and came with no real expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That didn’t mean I could slack off; on the contrary, I was determined to prove myself worthy of the promotion.</p><p> </p><p>Azkaban, for the first time in recorded history, was running like a well oiled machine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was all due to the new workers we employed as prison guards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Emancipated House Elves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione and I worked together to make it a reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Elves loved the work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were proud to provide the prisoners with nutritious meals and fresh laundry and clean cells.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was in their nature to follow only the orders of their masters, so they had no trouble carrying out their tasks unswayed by the bribes or threats some of the more nefarious prisoners directed their way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The new wardens were delighted.</p><p> </p><p>I wasn’t needed at the prison very much at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still, I kept up with the planned and unscheduled visits, just to be on the safe side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Azkaban wouldn’t fall back into a hellish cesspool under my watch.</p><p> </p><p>One of my favourite duties in my new position was meeting with the work experience prisoners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing could beat the feeling of seeing a former hopeless witch or wizard transformed as they fell in love with their placement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pairing a prisoner and company wasn’t easy by any means.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes it took several tries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes a prisoner never rose to the challenge, which was always disappointing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes a placement turned out to have less than honest intentions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those companies were stricken from the program, fined, and had charges laid against them, if circumstances warranted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was my job to keep the prisoners safe.</p><p> </p><p>The only work experience placement I didn’t visit directly was Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I sent Harry instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s how you knew your best mate truly loved you; he was willing to be sniped at by his childhood nemesis, just to make you happy.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s reports all saw Draco flourishing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were rave reviews, both from the rehab centre about Draco, and from the man himself about his coworkers and managers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a top-notch placement.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, they were so impressed, they had offered Draco a permanent paid position, once he had fulfilled his sentence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today was that day.</p><p> </p><p>After a week of dreary rain that blanketed the entire country in drab misery, the weather shifted, and the sun attempted to peek weakly out from behind the clouds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I stood just off from the animal rehab entrance, semi-concealed by the shade of a towering ash tree. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>This was a departure from standard release protocol.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Usually, a work release prisoner that had fulfilled their obligations would floo directly to my office.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I took it upon myself to ensure that they had a proper place to live, respectable employment lined up, and access to Ministry assistance resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, with the position being fairly new, Draco was only my second such case, and, as ever, he was worth bending<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the rules for.</p><p> </p><p>I hadn’t seen him in six months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry assured<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>me that he looked “fine”, and even admitted to “healthy” when I pressed for more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t know what to expect.</p><p> </p><p>My stomach flipped when I first caught sight of him, walking slowly out of the gate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After just a few steps he paused, and tilted his gaze to the sky, seeking the glow of the sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He did look healthy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Filled out, but still lean and graceful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could see the faint trace of a tan on his pale skin, tinting his nose and his lower arms, where the cuffs of his sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>There was also a glint on his neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right, that’s why I was here. Draco Malfoy had successfully served his time.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco,” I called, startling the man out of his thoughts.  I was nervous and sweating, worried off my head that I had misinterpreted the depth of Draco’s feelings towards me. Towards us.  </p><p> </p><p>He turned my way, a slow smile spreading over his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Weasley,” he replied, emotion making his voice thick.</p><p> </p><p>I was supposed to be professional.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was supposed to remove his collar and provide him with a Ministry issue wand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was supposed to go over reams and reams of paperwork with him, detailing his parole conditions and work obligations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was supposed to explain the Ministry’s role in his release to society.</p><p> </p><p>Professionalism could just bugger off right now.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” I said, like a total dork.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After six months!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was the best I could come up with.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” he echoed, as he moved towards me, and me breath caught in my chest. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Staring at him, looking fit and happy and just...there, right in front of me; it was too much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I gave my head a little shake, and confessed, in a disjointed, rambling fashion, “we are supposed to be back at the Ministry. In my office. Discussing your future.”</p><p> </p><p>“I like the sound of that,” he said, his wide smile turning a little lopsided and shy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Discussing the future with you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I nearly had to close my eyes, he looked so beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>Draco laced his fingers though mine, and we set off down the road, all dopey grins and bashful stolen glances, no destination in mind, warm and happy under the fresh spring sun.</p></div>
