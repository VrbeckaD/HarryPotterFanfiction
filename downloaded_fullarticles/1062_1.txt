    <p>Sirius Black paced back and forth across a dimly lit room, his footsteps muffled by the worn carpet. Absentmindedly, his hand scratched at the bandages covering the lower half of his left arm. He let out a huff of irritation and turned to face the door, glaring at its polished surface.</p>
<p>“Fucking werewolves,” he muttered, and turned to walk towards one of the chairs near the fireplace. He fell ungraciously into one, letting his arms rest limply splayed on the armrests, and kicked his feet up onto the footstool. If their guests couldn’t be bothered to show up on time, then he couldn’t be bothered to stand around waiting for them.</p>
<p>Even before becoming a “proper” Death Eater, he’d been stuck on werewolf duty. Getting the werewolves to join their side was something the Dark Lord cared about very much, but not enough to attend to the task himself. So it fell down the chain of command and landed in Sirius’ lap, because no one else wanted to deal with the excruciating task of trying to talk to the beasts. Technically, Sirius could pass on the duty to Regulus, but he’d rather ballroom dance with Fenrir Greyback himself before he let those monsters anywhere near his little brother. At just eighteen, he’d already managed to land himself the worst job in the group. </p>
<p>Which left him waiting, yet again, for a meeting he knew would go nowhere. The werewolves, alongside being filthy and putrid, were also about as intelligent as the armchairs they rubbed their dirt-coated skin against. Sirius would make more progress talking to his wand than trying to get Greyback to string two words together. His reports back to Rodolphus were usually very slim and unhelpful, but he was forced to hold the weekly meetings regardless. It didn’t help that Greyback hated wizards, and took every opportunity he could to piss Sirius off, like showing up late or leaving deep scratches on the armrests, which Sirius would have to fix later, or risk his mother’s wrath.</p>
<p>He was just beginning to lament the fact that he’d have to de-flea the chair after the meeting was over when there was a soft knock at the door. Sirius slowly sat up straight, turning to look at the door with his brow furrowed. Never, in nearly a month of meetings, had a werewolf ever knocked before entering. Usually they barged in and threw themselves down on the nearest available surface, which wasn’t always a chair, and then proceed to start babbling without even an introduction.</p>
<p>Sirius stood and dusted himself off, unsure of what to do. He crossed his arms defensively in front of him, fingers brushing lightly against the wand tucked up his sleeve. “Come in,” he said, uncertainty making the statement sound more like a question than a command.</p>
<p>The door opened gently, revealing not Fenrir Greyback, or any other werewolf that Sirius had ever seen, but a boy who looked to be around the same age as him. The newcomer had curly brown hair, wild and unkempt.  His skinny body was drowning in an oversized sweater with the sleeves rolled up in bunches around his elbows. It was worn and stained, matching the smudges of dirt on the boy’s skin. The most startling thing about his appearance were three jagged scars which ripped across his face, marring his otherwise handsome features.</p>
<p>Sirius, startled, found himself momentarily unable to speak, and simply gaped at the boy. Neither of them moved for a moment, eyes caught in a staring contest they had not consented to. Unintentionally, Sirius noted that the boy, despite the harshness of his appearance, had gentle brown eyes.</p>
<p>The boy looked down suddenly, breaking eye contact, and stepped a little further into the room. “I’m looking for Sirius Black?” he said, and his voice was as soft as his sweater must be.  </p>
<p>Sirius opened and closed his mouth uselessly for a second, and then shook his head, trying to regain his composure. “Where is Greyback?” he said, straightening his posture. The boy was taller than him, a fact that annoyed Sirius more than he’d like to admit.</p>
<p>“He couldn’t make it,” the boy said, raising his eyes from the floor. “Or he didn’t want to. Either way, he sent me to stand in for him during the meeting.”</p>
<p>Sirius groaned, eye twitching. As if the meetings were not already miserable enough, Greyback had decided they weren’t even important enough to show up to and was sending errand boys instead. Probably just to waste Sirius’ time, as if he didn’t do that enough already.</p>
<p>“And what are you, his pet?” Sirius sneered, annoyance creeping into his voice.</p>
<p>“I’m Remus Lupin,” the other boy replied, holding out his hand. “And I’m here to represent Greyback, so whatever you were planning to tell him, you can tell me.”</p>
<p>Sirius crossed his arms even tighter, trapping his hands against his body before he could do something stupid, like accept the offer for a handshake, even though a distractingly large part of him wanted to. “I’d rather not catch fleas,” Sirius said, nodding at Remus’ extended hand.</p>
<p>Remus frowned and pulled his arm back, mimicking Sirius’ posture instead. “That’s a shame, Greyback says the fleas love the taste of purebloods. That’s why he always leaves behind a few, just for you.”</p>
<p>“Greyback has a lot of nerve,” Sirius said. “And so do you, talking to me so casually. Greyback is one thing, but I’m not intimidated by a little pup like you.”</p>
<p>“No offense,” Remus said. “But I’m not very imitated by you either, Sirius Black.”</p>
<p>The starting match reignited for another moment before Sirius spun around and moved back toward the armchair. He took a seat again and watched as Remus perched gently on the edge of the chair across from Sirius.</p>
<p>“Greyback mentioned that last time…” Remus began, but was cut off before he could finish.</p>
<p>“Do you go to Hogwarts?” Sirius asked, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees. There was something unsettlingly familiar about the boy and Sirius couldn’t quite place what it was.</p>
<p>Remus let out an exasperated puff of air. “We’re supposed to be talking about the….”</p>
<p>“What, are you in a hurry?” Sirius said.  “I can’t imagine anyone would be in a rush to get back to Greyback. Just answer my question.”</p>
<p>Remus’ mouth tightened. “What happens if I don’t?” </p>
<p>“We sit here until you decide to answer,” Sirius said, a small smirk pulling at his lips. “I have no desire to get back to my duties either.”</p>
<p>There was a beat of silence. “Fine,” Remus sighed. “I did go to Hogwarts. For a few years.” </p>
<p>“They let a werewolf attend Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“Shocking, I know,” Remus said. “Imagine that, a werewolf, right under your nose. Suppose you’ll have to burn your robes now.”</p>
<p>“I’m amazed no one found out. Dumbledore must have had quite the time sneaking that little secret past everyone,” Sirius said. Although his family hated Albus Dumbledore on principle, he couldn’t help have a begrudging respect for the man who was the only one the Dark Lord ever feared. Despite Sirius being a Slytherin, and from a family of pure-blood supremacists, the headmaster had never said an unkind word to him. “What house were you in?”</p>
<p>“Gryffindor. We has some classes together, on occasion.”</p>
<p>“We did?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Remus coolly. “Not that I’d expect you to remember, you Slytherins were always fairly self-absorbed and I kept to myself.”</p>
<p>Sirius strained, for a moment, trying to remember seeing Remus in any of his classes. A vague memory came to him, hazy and unfocused, of him lobbing large snail shells across the classroom to land in the Gryffindor’s cauldrons when the teacher’s back was turned. One shell successfully hit its mark, causing water to splash on the front of one student’s robes. Then those brown eyes, hard and full of anger, landed on Sirius, with the three large scars standing out starkly against pale skin.</p>
<p>He shook his head to banish the memory, but couldn’t dismiss the faint flush crawling up his neck. “You said you only went for a few years? You didn’t finish?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Greyback thought it was pointless for a werewolf to finish school and decided I’d be more useful as a member of his pack,” Remus said, and Sirius was struck by the heavy contempt in his voice. He felt a pang of sympathy for the boy, but didn’t let it show on his face.</p>
<p>“He has a point,” Sirius said. “An education is rather useless if you are going to spend your life pissing in the woods and killing people.”</p>
<p>The scars stood out more vividly when Remus’ face was twisted in anger. “Well,” Remus said, words tight. “Then you must not have needed to finish school either, since all Death Eaters need to know how to do is kiss the Dark Lord’s ass and die.”</p>
<p>Sirius tried to stop the laugh that bubbled out of his throat with his hand, but the sound slipped through his fingers, and it kept going. Though Remus tried to hold onto his anger, it collapsed under the barrage of Sirius’ glee. Soon he too was joining in and their laughter filled the dusty room.</p>
<p>Sirius took a breath and wiped at his eyes with his arm, a few more giggles escaping. “I mean, you aren’t wrong,” he said, lifting his head to grin at Remus. “Although sucking up to my professor’s to avoid detention did give me a lot of practice in ass kissing, so maybe my education wasn’t a complete waste.” Sirius leaned back in the chair, crossing his arms over his head. “You know, you are much more enjoyable company than the dirty wolves I usually have to talk to.”</p>
<p>“A boggart would be more enjoyable company than Greyback, so that’s not really a compliment,” Remus said.</p>
<p>“You really hate him, don’t you? You should be careful, I could tell him all the horrible stuff you’re saying next time I see him.”</p>
<p>A momentary flash of fear crossed Remus’ face, but it was quickly replaced with steely determination. “You won’t,” he said.</p>
<p>“I won’t? How can you be so sure?” Sirius said, smirking. “Being cooped up in here gets boring very fast, and I’d do anything to stir the pot a little.”</p>
<p>“You won’t because you want me to come back next time,” Remus said with cool certainty. </p>
<p>“Bold of you to assume that.”</p>
<p>“No assumptions, just facts.”</p>
<p>“What about dear ol’ Greyback? I think I’d be just devastated if I never got to see his sweet hairy face again.”</p>
<p>Remus raised an eyebrow and Sirius laughed, waving a hand lazily at him. “Okay, yes, obviously I’d sleep quite well if I never saw his ugly mug again. I won’t tell on you if it’ll keep you around. At least you don’t smell like piss. Well, at least not as much.” </p>
<p>“I’m flattered,” Remus said. “Now, speaking of Greyback, can we get to what we actually need to discuss? If I don’t bring back any information you’ll be seeing a lot more of him.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, fine,” Sirius said, leaning further back in the chair. “What does the dirty dog want this time?”</p>
<p>As Remus began explaining Greyback’s concerns, Sirius was only half listening. It was all information he had heard before, and what was much more interesting to him in the moment was contemplating Remus’ appearance. The boy really wasn’t too bad looking, for a werewolf, Sirius supposed. </p>
<p>He nodded at the right times to keep Remus talking for a while and found himself steadily being lulled into a strange sense of calm as the minutes ticked by. Perhaps, he thought, these meetings weren’t so bad afterall. <br/>“Your arm is bleeding?” Remus said.</p>
<p>“What?” Sirius said, shaking his head to clear it.</p>
<p>“Your arm,” Remus repeated, pointing at the object in question.</p>
<p>Sirius looked down and saw that the bandages covering his left foreman were steadily turning red. “Shit,” he muttered, covering it with his hand. “Not again…”</p>
<p>“Again?” Remus said, getting up from his chair and taking a slight step towards Sirius. “Do you start suddenly bleeding out of your arm often?”</p>
<p>Sirius took out his wand and pointed it at his arm, but didn’t say anything. He had never been good at healing spells, which had never really been a problem before he’d gotten his mark. The damn thing had been bleeding on and off every since he had gotten it a few weeks ago. Some bleeding was to be expected, but he’d never heard of it going on for this long. “I can’t let the others see this,” he said, a tinge of desperation in his voice. </p>
<p>He didn’t dare go to any of the other Death Eaters with concerns. He knew enough about the marks to realize what his was doing was not normal, and the last thing he needed was to be under more scrutiny. </p>
<p>“Why?” Remus said.</p>
<p>“Mind your own business, werewolf,” Sirius snapped.</p>
<p>“It’s my business if you are going to bleed out all over the floor,” Remus said, taking another step closer. “Do you need help?”</p>
<p>“Like I would need your help,” Sirius said. “I want to keep my arm, not have it ripped off.”</p>
<p>Remus scowled. “Put away your stupid pride for long enough for me to fix it, or pass out from blood loss. Given how much you dislike werewolves, I highly doubt you want to be unconscious in a room with one. And I don’t really want to have to explain anything  to your associates.”</p>
<p>While they had been arguing, the bleeding had gotten steadily worse. Sirius looked at his wand pointed uselessly at the wound. He knew there was nothing he would be able to do to stop it at this point, and taking a blow to his pride was preferable to the alternative. Grumbling, he stuck out his arm in Remus’ direction. “Try anything funny and you’ll be the next decorative rug for our fireplace,” he said.</p>
<p>Rolling his eyes, Remus came close to Sirius and took his injured arm in a light grip. Sirius felt his pulse spike a bit at the contact. “Vulnera Sanentur,” Remus said, moving his wand in quick movements. “Tergeo.”</p>
<p>After these words were said, the blood all rushed to one point on Sirius’ arm and then lifted up and into Remus’ wand, leaving the bandages as clean as they had been before. No new blood came forth and as far as Sirius could tell, the bleeding had stopped. He looked up from the wound to find himself face to face with Remus, who was also looking at him now. He opened his mouth to say something, but at that moment there was the sudden noise of the doorknob being turned. </p>
<p>Sirius, startled, yanked his arm from Remus’ grasp and looked to face the man standing in the doorway. The man had scraggly dark hair, dark circles under his eyes, and a frown etched permanently into his face. </p>
<p>“Rudolphus,” Sirius said, dropping into a quick bow. “Can I help you with something?”</p>
<p>Rodolphus Lestrange was not looking at Sirius, but was fixing Remus with a steady glare. The werewolf took a step back from Sirius, pocketing his wand, and stared back just as intensely, mouth twisted into a grimace. “Black,” Rodolplus said, tearing his eyes from Remus to address Sirius, “I assume you’ve long enough to get what you need. Your presence is required elsewhere.” </p>
<p>“Of course,” Sirius said quickly, making a move towards the doorway but stopping when he remembered Remus still standing behind him. He looked over his shoulder and caught Remus’ eye.</p>
<p>“I’ll let Greyback know everything went well,” Remus said with a curt nod, stiff and professional, but when he raised his head again, Sirius swore he saw a small smile. </p>
<p>Sirius gave a nod in return and left the room, finding himself, despite everything, very much looking forward to the next werewolf meeting.</p>
