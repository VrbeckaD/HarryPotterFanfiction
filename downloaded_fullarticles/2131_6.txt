    <p>Home is where family is.</p>
<p>The strong smell of firewhiskey and spiked pumpkin juice filled the common room thoroughly. The usually cozy room, normally filled with scarlet and gold colours and snug armchairs and sofas, was now filled with retro tables, flying cauldrons of alcoholic drinks, and huge quantities of food. Records were heard over and over, varying from Bowie, Queen, Bowie, Pink Floyd, to Bowie.</p>
<p>Differently from other parties, (Oh yes. Many secret parties had taken place in the Gryffindor tower in the last four years.), Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students had also <br/>joined the Gryffindors in this… celebration.</p>
<p>Only a certain student seemed to be distant from the dozens of drunk students.<br/>Andromeda Black staggered with difficulty, making her way to the edge of the common room. She wrinkled her nose at the foul smell of vomit. An older Ravenclaw had just emptied his stomach in a nearby bin. </p>
<p>Getting away from the alcohol influenced student, she finally sank into a tall satin armchair, next to the fire. She spotted her cousin, Sirius Black, snogging with a tall Hufflepuff girl. His denim shirt was opened, showing his strong chest. The pair seemed to be oblivious to their surroundings, just concentrated on kissing each other fiercely.</p>
<p>She caught a glimpse of James Potter, who was taking shots over and over with Dorcas Meadowes and a couple of other Gryffindor boys. His usual charming personality was cast away by a drunken state, eyes unfocused, his hand trembling. And even if he looked as if he would collapse at any second, his mouth curved in a pleasured grin, laughing at an unheard joke.</p>
<p>Even her best friend Lily Evans, who usually disliked Potter’s parties, was having an animated conversation with Wilbert Lynch and Fabian Prewett, both in sixth year. Next to them, Zeph Gutierrez was chatting with Ludwig Vanderburg, a tall Ravenclaw student. Differently from other circumstances, Ludwig looked relaxed and calm, listening with an interested look.</p>
<p>Andromeda took a long gulp of her butterbeer, feeling it warm her body. Differently from her peers, today had not been a wonderful day. She took a crumpled piece of parchment, a letter, from her breast pocket.</p>
<p>She was wearing ripped jeans and a black blouse. Not to mention her black, victorian steampunk styled jacket, with silver buttons that gleamed at the starling lights. It was one of her most prized possessions, gifted by Sirius. Her birthday that year had been atrocious. Distinctively from her fellow students, Andromeda’s birthday was usually Summer holiday. Ever since her first year at Hogwarts, her parents, there was no other word for it, simply didn’t give a damn about her birthday. In the contrary to others, her own sisters made efforts to worsen that day. Last year, Bellatrix had set her robes on fire, called her a “Mudblood lover” all day long, and made her trip on the stairs, hurting her wrist.</p>
<p>When she got back to Hogwarts, heartsick, Sirius had warmly welcomed her with a piece of treacle tart, her favourite, and gave her the jacket.</p>
<p>A loud BANG made her jump and look up. Xenophilius Lovegood had started a firework that looked like an angry erumpet. The flaming animal flashed around the room, getting cheers and applauses.<br/>Her eyes rested on the bent letter again. She had read it over and over.</p>
<p>Andromeda,<br/>Your sister Narcissa informed us that you have been having an atrocious behaviour at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Well, her mother did truly disagree with Professor McGonagall,who had given her one of her rare complements, telling the girl she was one of the best behaved students on her year.</p>
<p>How dare you keep a friendship with that Evans mudblood!?</p>
<p>The word mudblood was written in pure disgust.</p>
<p>Didn’t you learn your lesson last time you came?<br/>But not to worry, Lucius Malfoy (Narcissa galant lover), offered to help you out in your O.W.Ls, and introduce you to some wealthy, good looking purebloods in Slytherin.</p>
<p>Andromeda nearly gagged at the mention of Malfoy, or more disgusting suitors. Her parents had been planning a pure blood wedding for her since she was five.</p>
<p>You will come to Christmas dinner. Hopefully this time you will not embarrass us, like your horrid cousin Sirius did last time.<br/>Mother.</p>
<p>The envelope was sealed with emerald wax and the typical “Toujours Pur”. She unconsciously wiped a lonely tear on her eyes. No wonder Cissy and Bella hated her. Maybe this Christmas they would try to marry her off...</p>
<p>“You seem a little lonely.”</p>
<p>The soft voice brought her back to reality. Andromeda looked up to find Remus Lupin sitting down in the couch in front of her. He was wearing jeans and a beige aviator jacket, covering his scarred arms. A cup of butterbear was hanging from his hand.</p>
<p>“Just thinking. What about yourself?”</p>
<p>Remus sank further into the couch. “Well, James does know how to throw a party that pleasures everyone.”</p>
<p>There was a long pause before either spoke again.</p>
<p>“You know Remus, sometimes I envy you.”</p>
<p>He have her a quizzical look.</p>
<p>“You envy me?” He thought to himself for a moment. “Never thought anyone would envy me.”</p>
<p>“Oh! That’s not what I meant… It’s just… you seem so calm, as if to enjoy yourself in </p>
<p>a quiet way.” His dark look was broken by a laugh.</p>
<p>“Alright… nobody has ever told me that either.”</p>
<p>They both shared a laugh, and went quiet as Remus sipped his butterbeer.</p>
<p>“You look sad.” He said, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>She looked down. “I-I do?”</p>
<p>“Yes Andromeda. Is something bothering you?”</p>
<p>“No no… well… yes.”</p>
<p>She took out the letter, handing it to him. Remus read it silently twice, frowning.</p>
<p>“Malfoy offered help for studying? You know much more than him.”</p>
<p>She blushed, and his eyes went back to the parchment.</p>
<p>“...like your horrid cousin Sirius did? What did Sirius do?”</p>
<p>She could only smile at the memory.</p>
<p>“He jinxed many of the guests, and cursed all of the family motto to say, ‘Muggleborn <br/>purity’”</p>
<p>It took about five minutes for them to stop laughing, but Andromeda’s eyes again became saddened. Remus noticed.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry Andy. Their idiots, we all know that. Even McGonagall would agree.”<br/>He stood up and put a hand on her shoulder, offering a gentle and kind smile, which she returned.</p>
<p>Andromeda studied his features as he sat back down. Even with the handsome jacket and good looking hair, his hazel eyes looked dull and tired, thin stubble </p>
<p>growing on his chin.</p>
<p>“Full moon the day after tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“No… tomorrow.” He replied, checking his watch. </p>
<p>Andromeda looked at her watch too. Seven minutes after midnight.</p>
<p>“Better not get caught.”</p>
<p>Both of them stood up and waved their way through the crowd towards the dormitories. Sirius had passed out in a table, and James had mysteriously disappeared with Dorcas. David Bowie was singing loudly from an enchanted record player, ‘Lady Stardust’ playing.</p>
<p>“Goodnight Andy.” Remus offered a more tired smile.</p>
<p>“Night fur-face.”</p>
<p>With the last goodbye, Andromeda entered her dormitory, which she shared with Lily, Dorcas, Marlene and Alice. Putting on her pyjamas, she retreated into the soft bed, thinking about the party still raging downstairs. Giving a soft sight, she let nightmares and dreams take hold of her thoughts.</p>
