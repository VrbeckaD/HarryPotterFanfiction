    <p>It was a strange thing, being caged in another’s body.</p><p>She didn’t want this, and certainly didn’t ask for it in some sort of teenager crush rage. Of course, she’s said she wanted to live in the world of Harry Potter.</p><p>Being able to use magic and go to Hogwarts. Being sorted into Slytherin, her favourite house. Her situation now was quite a different one from what she’d wished, though.</p><p>A future member of the Gryffindor house and a boy, nonetheless. A huge change, especially the gender part. It didn’t help that it was a different time, not 2019 but 1991, two years after her original birth year. Normally she would be 29 now and become 30 on the 28th of December.</p><p>She had studied medicine and worked in a hospital in Germany. Something she had been really proud of. It was all gone now.</p><p>She was imprisoned in the body of an eleven-year-old boy, who’d be sorted into Gryffindor. Her name had been Helen. It wasn’t any more, though. Lost, she stood in the middle of the busy street.</p><p>Hands in her unruly black hair, one of them tracing the scar on her forehead she never had. Around her were so many people, most of them wearing robes and pointed hats, in all colours and shapes. Small carriers which held undefinable objects, some of them moving, others looking slimy and gross. Even the stores were strange. The wood old, the display windows full with articles, no order or price on them. Nothing was in anyway familiar to what she knew. Growing up in Germany, everything had its order and a clearness to it, which here obviously didn’t apply.</p><p>Everything was strange, it didn’t even look a lot like the Diagon Alley shown in the films.</p><p>The most irritable thing still was that she had no idea what to do next. Hagrid, who was supposed to show Harry around, obviously wasn’t here. Perhaps it was the part of the book in which Harry had to go to Madame Malkins to get his school uniform. A scene not shown in the movies.</p><p>She could feel a pouch filled to the brim with coins in her jacket. With no other clue, she started to make her way to the store with a scissor as shop sign. The scissor opened and closed, sometimes cutting cords, sometimes just fabric. If she wasn’t so stunned and under adrenalin, she’d most definitely not do anything right now and just give in to the instinct that told her to run as fast as she could and never look back.</p><p>That wouldn’t be possible, though, for all she knew they could track her down quite easily and then she’d have to explain why she would run, and she didn’t have the nerve to think of a legitimate excuse at the moment. So, she opened the old door, and a little sound filled the busy store. She could make out a lot of Hogwarts students, most likely here to buy new robes, just like she had to.</p><p>Sadly, Harry was a little small for his age, which meant that Helen got pushed all of a sudden. Stumbling she barely managed to stay on both feet and looked back to make out her offender.</p><p>Her eyes travelled up a long, dark robe up to light blond hair held back in a tie. With not really concealed irritation she recognised the man who pushed her as Lucius Malfoy, with Draco standing right beside his father.</p><p>“Watch where you are going, boy.” With those words the Malfoys walked past her, skipping the line to go directly into a room behind the counter. Blinking to swallow the irritation, Helen turned back to the counter and forcedly smiled at Madame Malkins who had just appeared from the room the Malfoys just vanished in.</p><p>“Come on dear, I bet you need some Hogwarts robes, am I right?” The witch didn’t wait for an answer and just indicated her to follow.</p><p> </p><p>She’d been standing on the small pedestal for a few seconds now and could already feel Draco Malfoy’s grey eyes burning holes into her skull. Normally she would ignore staring people, mostly because people on German streets tended to look at everyone they saw, with no fear of staring into their faces. But now she knew she’d see the boy again, and making at least one friend, who would turn out to be really good looking as well, wouldn’t hurt.</p><p>“What’s your name?”, she asked him in a light tone. She wasn’t really sure how to approach having a friendship with the Malfoy heir, even if she knew him a little bit.</p><p>The real deal was always different, though.</p><p>“My name is Draco Malfoy! Will you go to Hogwarts as well? Do you already know what house you’ll be in? I`ll be in Slytherin, I`m sure.” Helen nodded and her new black hair fell into her eyes. It was a strange thing to have another hair colour other than her natural blond hair.</p><p>“I`m not as sure yet. I`m guessing either Ravenclaw or Slytherin as well.”</p>
