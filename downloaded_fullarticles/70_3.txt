    <p>The group sat around a plain table in the isolation room, surrounded by blindingly white walls and a strong antiseptic smell. Newt, Theseus, Jacob, Tina, Nagini, Travers, Dumbledore, and an assortment of aurors had been herded into the room as soon as the unconscious Yusuf Kama had been whisked away. </p>
<p>The one thing they all had in common was that they had been at the Paris rally. Well, except for Dumbledore, but he had taken tea with the group upon their return, and had been there when Kama suddenly collapsed. And so, he too was ordered to the isolation room. </p>
<p>"This is rubbish, honestly," Newt huffed, "it's more of that parasite from the sewers. He'll be fine, and none of us can catch it." </p>
<p>Theseus glared at his brother for scoffing at such a serious situation. "Qualified healers seem to think otherwise," he grumbled, "and until they give us clearance, we stay in this room and follow whatever instructions they tell us."</p>
<p>Two healers, swathed from head to toe in protective suits, and wearing masks, entered the room. Everyone turned to them, waiting for news. </p>
<p>"The patient is stabilized and in isolation," one of them explained, "and it appears our theory is correct. There was something infectious in the fire at that rally. We don't know what, exactly, but you're all going to have to go into quarantine immediately." </p>
<p>A chorus of angry murmurs rang out from around the table, and the second healer spoke up. "This is for your safety, as well as that of London, and possibly beyond. You will go in pairs. We will visit each of you every day, to check on you, and to gather information that will help us figure this out."</p>
<p>More suited and masked healers entered the room, and began picking up pairs from the table, apparating them away, to who knew where. Newt didn't even get the chance to say goodbye to his brother before Theseus was whisked away with Travers. Then, he felt himself being pulled up. He didn't have the chance to see who was coming with him before he was sucked away into side-along apparition. </p>
<p>However, his mood lightened considerably when he appeared in the quarantine quarters and saw who he'd be sharing them with. "Tina," he breathed out. </p>
<p>"Newt," she replied, and they both looked away blushing. </p>
<p>"Make yourselves comfortable, you're going to be here at least two weeks," the healer that brought them here explained, "now, we are fully stocked with food and water to last over a month if need be. We have clean clothes for you, and a receptacle in which to dispose of what you're wearing right now. You may use magic as much as you'd like, as long as you don't leave this space. It is advisable to sanitize your wands after each use," he gestured to a large container labeled Wand Sanitizer.</p>
<p>"We will be coming every day to assess you. If any concerning symptoms develop between visits, touch your wand to this red button here, and we'll come right away. Any questions?" </p>
<p>"Yes, um, actually, my case…" Newt started. </p>
<p>"Not to worry, Mr. Scamander, the exterior of the case has been sanitized and brought back to your home, where your assistant will take care of the creatures."</p>
<p>Newt relaxed slightly. He wasn't thrilled about being separated from his creatures, but Bunty was more than capable of caring for them in his absence. </p>
<p>"Anything else?" the healer asked. Newt and Tina shook their heads. </p>
<p>"Good luck then! See you tomorrow!" and he stepped outside through the front door, then magically sealed it so that Newt and Tina could not leave. </p>
<p>Now they finally had a chance to talk. They'd been planning to talk after tea with Dumbledore, but then Kama had fallen ill, and they'd rushed to the hospital, and, well, it had all been rather a mess from there. But now they had at least the next two weeks, with nothing but each other. </p>
<p>"So…" Tina started, "I suppose we should acquaint ourselves with our surroundings now." </p>
<p>Newt nodded in agreement. They were in one room, with several doors. The first door was the front door, magically sealed to prevent them from leaving. Another door led to the toilet, and a third door to the shower. There were no more doors, so it seemed this one room was it. </p>
<p>The room contained an ice box and a pantry, a small kitchenette, shelves packed full of other staple supplies. And of course there was a bed. One bed. Newt and Tina glanced back and forth between each other and the one bed several times, both growing redder by the second. </p>
<p>Finally, Tina spoke up. "I think I'm gonna go wash up and change." She pointed her wand at the shelf full of clothes and summoned a change to the room with the shower, and then followed, closing the door behind her. </p>
<p>Newt paced the room frantically as she showered. There was nothing but a door between himself and Tina. Who was in the shower. Presumably naked. He ran his fingers through his hair trying to calm his thoughts. This wasn't right. They still hadn't sorted out whatever was between them, they were not even close to the point where he should be thinking of such things… </p>
<p>He looked over at the lone bed again. If he was being honest with himself, he wasn't exactly about to complain about sharing a bed with Tina. But what if she found it uncomfortable? Well, if one of them was going to have to sleep on the floor, of course it would be him. It was the gentlemanly thing to do. But, he couldn't say he wasn't hoping that Tina would be amenable to sharing the bed, and it wasn't because he didn't want to spend two weeks sleeping on the floor… </p>
<p>The door opened, interrupting his thoughts. Tina stepped out, hair damp, and wearing the thin, hospital issued clothing that clung to her in all the right places. Newt trained his glance on the floor and wordlessly strode into the shower room, practically slamming the door behind him. He opened it a second later and poked his wand out to summon his own hospital issued clothes, and slammed the door again. He kept his shower cold. </p>
<p>Now it was Tina's turn to calm her nerves as her thoughts drifted to Newt showering. She sat on the edge of the bed. Would they be sharing it? Not that she'd mind… He was probably going to be a gentleman and offer to sleep on the floor though. If he did, would she protest? Or let him? She wasn't sure. </p>
<p>Newt came out of the shower, dressed in the same hospital issued outfit. Tina couldn't contain her giggle. </p>
<p>"Do I really look that ridiculous?" Newt asked nervously, pulling out his wand to dry his hair. </p>
<p>"Not at all!" Tina immediately clarified, "it's just kinda funny that we're stuck wearing the exact same outfit right now." Newt had to laugh at that as well. </p>
<p>"If anything," Tina added, "I'm the one who looks ridiculous. I can't imagine this getup is at all flattering…"</p>
<p>"I don't think anything could possibly be unflattering on you," Newt said quietly, before he could stop himself. He chanced a glance at Tina, who was beaming. He would have liked to kiss her then and there, but backed away again, overcome by shyness again. With two weeks in isolation ahead of them, and he was sure it would happen soon. But he was afraid of overwhelming her.</p>
<p>"I'll get dinner started," he offered, turning toward the small kitchenette, and fumbling around with his wand. </p>
<p>"Yeah, that works," Tina muttered, trying not to sound too disappointed. </p>
<p>They ate in silent awkwardness, stealing covert glances at each other, not unlike their very first dinner together, both too overwhelmed to figure out how to proceed. Should they make small talk? Discuss Paris? Continue their interrupted conversation from the vault? It was easier not to talk at all.  </p>
<p>After clearing up, Tina announced she was going to bed. “Ah, yes,” Newt replied as the blush crept up his cheeks, “I will, of course, take the floor.” He waved his wand to start arranging pillows into a comfortable setup. </p>
<p>“No, I wouldn’t expect-you don’t have to-” Tina sputtered, not sure how to tell Newt she was fine with sharing the bed, without sounding too forward, “it’s just...Well, we’re here for two weeks and you shouldn’t have to sleep on the floor.” </p>
<p>They both nervously looked at the bed, and then everywhere else but each other. “I- thank you, that’s very kind Tina,” Newt said earnestly, hoping he didn’t sound too eager. </p>
<p>“It’s fine, I promise,” Tina smiled shyly, as she sat down on the edge of the bed. Newt took his cue and sat down on the opposite edge. </p>
<p>As they slid in under the covers, Newt wedged himself as close to the edge as he could without falling off. Not because he didn’t want to be close to Tina. He very much did. He desperately desired to be as close as humanly possible to her, and hoped she might one day let him. But until that day, the most important priority was her comfort, and if that meant he had to teeter on the edge of a shared bed, so be it.</p>
<p>Then, as he closed his eyes, he felt a small rumbling coming from the other side of the bed. He listened intently for a few minutes, his heart breaking every second as it dawned on him. Tina was crying, presumably over her sister.</p>
<p>Newt was done being reserved. He couldn’t let Tina cry alone. He scooted closer to her and placed a hand on her shoulder. She turned around to face Newt with her tearstained face and nodded. Newt took her hand with his other and squeezed it comfortingly.</p>
<p>“I’m here for you,” he whispered, looking directly into her salamander eyes, “I’ve got you, Tina.” </p>
<p>She wordlessly squeezed his hand back, and they lay awkwardly, side by side, until they both dropped off to sleep, hands still loosely intertwined.</p>
