    <p><em>Miserable </em>is the best term to describe how Theseus is feeling when he awakens for work - five sharp, as usual. There has been a half-awareness in the back of his mind for days that he's not well, but - he has a tendency to ignore such things and fling himself back into the job. He's not entirely sure he can ignore it any longer.</p><p>Leta doesn't have to be there quite as early as he does and so, after drawing a deep breath to steel himself and push away the growing, pounding ache in his temples, he slips out of bed as quietly as he can to avoid waking his fiancee and moves to dress himself and brew some Pepper-Up potion. It'll be a late one today, and at the end, Leta has invited Newt over for dinner - an invitation that he's finally actually accepted.</p><p>His fiancee, though, bless her (sometimes, he thinks), has an uncanny ability to know when he's not well despite his best efforts to hide it (which he's prone to more often than she would like). She's up earlier than usual today, and he feels a hand at his arm just as he's reaching for the Floo powder.</p><p>"You look awful."</p><p>Lips twitch at the corners and Theseus turns to her. She's still in her nightdress, drowsy-eyed and peering up at him with concern. "Thank you, darling," he says with a forced lightness -<em> God, his head hurts</em> - as he leans down to press his lips to her hair, unable to help himself.</p><p>"I'm serious, Theseus. I'm not sure you should go in today." Her hand is palming his forehead gently then and he suppresses a sigh, taking a step back.</p><p>"I can't. There's too much to be done. Grindelwald is on the loose again and -"</p><p>"And you have a mountain of paperwork, and the junior aurors can never seem to get anything done without you, and Travers will pitch a fit," she interrupts, doing her best impression of his voice (and it's not too bad, he thinks begrudgingly). "I know, I know. I've heard it all before. But you're burning up, and I don't think-"</p><p>Huh. So he has a fever. Somehow the words manage to surprise him a little, but he's still shaking his head <em>no</em>. "I'll be fine." His tone gentles a bit this time. "And if I'm not, I'll come home early, yes?" Words they both know are a lie, but one he's willing to tell to comfort her.</p><p>Leta chews her lower lip for a moment before nodding and releasing his arm, though her eyes are still worried and she's looking at him like he might keel over at any moment. He hadn't thought he'd looked <em>that</em> badly off, but he doesn't question it, instead stepping forward to kiss her gently before he's tossing the powder into the fireplace.</p><p>"British Ministry of Magic."</p><hr/><p>Theseus comes to the gradual realization through the course of the day that he<em> definitely</em> isn't able to ignore it anymore. He's tense and irritable with everyone, including the junior aurors, and he snaps at his assistant so hard around lunchtime that she colors instantly and he hardly sees her the rest of the day. The headache is unbearable by the time he leaves, a dull agony pounding at his temples and sometimes seeming to leech the colors from his vision when it grows particularly bad, and when he goes to hand in the paperwork at the end of the day even Travers looks at him with something that's almost passable for concern.</p><p>He's managed to forget about Newt coming over for dinner, and is so eager to collapse into bed with Leta and sleep (a foreign feeling to him) that he nearly cries when he sees the familiar blue coat in the dining room but manages to pull himself together enough to shrug his jacket off and greet his brother.</p><p>"Are you ill?" The question comes midway through dinner and is so soft that Theseus nearly misses it. It's also so unexpected from Newt that at first he thinks it'd come from Leta.</p><p>"Just a little under the weather, I suppose." A tight smile, more of an admission that he'd usually offer, but with the look Leta is giving him, he doesn't think he'll get away with another I'm fine. "I'll be right as rain tomorrow."</p><p>Theseus accidentally falls asleep on the sofa shortly after dinner and well before Newt has thought up an excuse to duck out. His sleep is uneasy, and he wakes to a crick in his neck and head tucked against Leta's arm, the two of them murmuring in hushed voices as he slumps into her. The pain in his head has only grown worse, and is now accompanied by a swell of nausea as well as general aching all round his body.</p><p>It's not until half an hour or so later that he begins to realize and accept something is well and truly wrong, when his vision grows suddenly fuzzy around the edges and the pain in his head flares up to agonizing levels as they're standing to see Newt off. His hands fly up to grip his skull, drawing a sharp breath through clenched teeth, and both of their eyes are suddenly on him.</p><p>"Theseus? Theseus, what's wrong?" Leta's hands are already on his arm, trying to pull his hand away from his head, but he holds it there insistently because maybe pressure will take some of the pain away and he can't will himself to drop it-</p><p>"My head," he croaks out finally, squeezing his eyes shut and willing the tears suddenly stinging his eyes not to fall. It's ridiculous to cry over something as small as a headache. "It hurts."</p><p>"Alright, let me just - I'm sure I can find something to help, just hold on, darling..." Over the sound of her voice, he thinks he hears Newt say something about St. Mungo's, and he tries to protest, but it's as if his tongue has suddenly turned to lead in his mouth and he can't get the words out.</p><p>He doesn't need a hospital, he tries to say, he just wants to rest - but the ground is unsteady and then turning to quicksand beneath his feet so that he can no longer stand. The next thing he knows the floor is a good deal closer than he remembers it being before and his eyes are rolling shut. After that, he knows only blackness.</p>
