    <p>
  <span>Perpetua Perez was born into the </span>
  <em>
    <span>mostly </span>
  </em>
  <span>pure-blooded Perez family. She was the only child and heir of Valentina and Mateo Perez, two rather wealthy and respected members of the wizarding community. Perpetua was accustomed to a certain degree of respect and recognition from those around her. She was expected to behave with dignity and grace, to be the perfect example of a pure-blood lady. She was honestly quite bored by the trivial acts of “proper” behavior and would rather behave a bit improperly at times. Ever since she was a small child, she enjoyed discovering just how much she could get away with. She learned early on that one could say most anything as long as it was accompanied by a charming smile. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>By the age of eight, she had learned to take what wouldn’t be missed. She still kept the first item she had even stolen without getting caught; a small doll that she had taken from a girl’s room while her family was visiting the girl’s family. The doll had been resting on a shelf, made of porcelain and purely decorative. It was in pristine condition, clearly having never been played with. Perpetua knew from the moment she laid eyes on the thing that its absence would go completely unnoticed. When she had taken it, slipping it beneath her robes, she had felt no guilt or remorse. It was only a forgotten doll, something that wouldn’t be missed or replaced. From that day on, Perpetua enjoyed taking what would easily be forgotten. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The first time Perpetua met the Black family, she was nine years old. She was wearing her nicest dress, her dark hair styled perfectly in a neat bun. She easily wore a charming smile as she was introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Black, bowing her head and making polite conversation. She allowed her parents to parade her around, telling the Blacks of her talent with languages and instruments. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fluent in four languages,” they had said. “And you should hear her play the violin.” They were only ever so proud when with company. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was introduced to the rather large Black family, including cousins and siblings. Eventually, the time came for her to meet the Black children. She was presented to the Black sisters first. Three girls stood side-by-side, all wearing matching, forced smiled, all hiding something different behind their eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The eldest sister, Bellatrix, held deep contempt just under the green of her eyes. She was clearly judging Perpetua, trying to decide if she was good enough to deserve her family’s name and presence. There was a darkness about the girl that put Perpetua on edge, made her feel distrustful. Even as the girl spoke, she spoke of violence with an almost childlike glee that Perpetua found to be unsettling. She quickly decided that she did not like Bellatrix Black. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Andromeda was polite, sweet, and utterly boring. There was something about her that almost lulled Perpetua to sleep. There was nothing necessarily wrong with the girl, she was just incredibly dull. She spoke so optimistically, clearly an idealist. Perpetua never cared for idealists; they were too dull and one-note. There was no changing their point of view because they didn’t want it to be changed. They were purposefully blinding themselves. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa was the one Perpetua liked the most. She was proper, but held a familiar edge to her. She delivered her prepared lines with just a touch of sarcasm that would go undetected by someone unfamiliar with it. Perpetua was very familiar with that particular coping mechanism, as she did it herself. The back-and-forth she carried on with Narcissa held more meaning than just the surface level. She quickly decided that her and Narcissa were going to be good friends. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The other Black siblings came next: Sirius, Bianca, and Regulus. Perpetua wasn’t as impressed with them as she had been with the sisters. In fact, she was almost disappointed by them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius was loud. That was the first thing Perpetua noticed about him. He was loud, rude, and obnoxious. She didn’t care for him at all. He didn’t seem to care for her either. He spent most of the time pointing out flaws in her appearance or clothing, being a complete arse the entire time. She quickly became frustrated by his rudeness and boldness. He didn’t seem to care what she thought of him, wearing messy clothes and having even messier hair. He just didn’t care and that infuriated Perpetua greatly. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The only daughter, Bianca Black, was even more boring than Andromeda had been. She was quiet and fidgety and nervous, stumbling over her words and never meeting Perpetua’s gaze. She was anxious for reasons unknown to Perpetua and it showed. Bianca seemed completely unable to even feign confidence, much to Perpetua’s frustration. She quickly grew bored of the girl and was ready to move on. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Regulus Black was clearly the favorite child. They didn’t even attempt to keep it a secret, showering Regulus in praise and talking about how proud they were of him. He soaked up the praise like a sponge, smirking to himself. Perpetua already wanted to slap the stupid smirk off of his face. It wouldn’t have been so bad if he wasn’t so proud of being the special little golden boy of his family. All he talked about were his accomplishments and his future. It was drab and dull and Perpetua just wanted him to shut up. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After dinner, Perpetua’s parents were mingling with the Blacks and Perpetua was permitted to wander around. She hummed to herself as she journeyed through the halls, peering into each room. When she reached an empty bedroom, she allowed herself to slip inside. She glanced around the room, making her way towards the bed. She sat herself down and laid back, her head landing against the pillow. She crossed her arms behind her head and stared up at the ceiling. She was remarkably bored and uncomfortable in her stiff dress. She closed her eyes and found herself drifting off in the bed that wasn’t hers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When she awoke, she was still alone in the bedroom. She sat up with a yawn, hair slightly disheveled and dress wrinkled. She gazed around the room, eyes landing on a jar of marbles sitting atop a tall shelf. She smirked to herself and got out of the bed, creeping towards the jar. She set a foot on the bottom shelf, pulling herself up so she could begin climbing. She climbed up and up until she could place her hands around the jar and pull it off before slowly beginning her descent. She hopped off of the shelves with the jar firmly in hand, smirking to herself. She opened the jar and pulled out a single marble, pocketing it before putting the jar back in its place. She turned around to see one of the Black boys standing in the doorway. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing?” Regulus questioned, eyes narrowing at her. “Why are you in my room?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Perpetua shrugged easily. “Where else would I be?” She challenged, smoothing out her dress. “I was just exploring.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why are you exploring in </span>
  <em>
    <span>my </span>
  </em>
  <span>room?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because it was the room I found,” Perpetua replied haughtily. “Exploring doesn’t have a specific destination.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Regulus frowned. “You still shouldn’t be in my room.” He insisted. “Girls aren’t supposed to be in here.” He crossed his arms and leaned against the doorway. “Get out.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Perpetua rolled her eyes. “Fine.” She said simply. “Fine, I’ll go. No big deal.” She walked past Regulus on her way out, hiding a smirk. It didn’t matter if she was getting kicked out; she already had what she wanted. </span>
