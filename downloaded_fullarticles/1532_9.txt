    <p>-------------</p><p>As the bell rang to signal the end of Charms class, John stood from his seat, slinging his bag over his shoulder.</p><p>"God, I can't deal with double Defence with this new Professor Entwhistle - or whatever his name is," he heard a voice in his ear and turned his head to see his fellow Gryffindor Greg towering over him with a frustrated expression etched upon his tanned face.</p><p>"Oh, I don't think it's that bad. The lessons are still just as entertaining." If not even more, John wanted to add.</p><p>"Sure, only because they switched our timetables so we're with the Ravenclaws," Greg sniggered knowingly as they made their way into the Entrance Hall.</p><p>Before John could reply, his blue eyes rested upon a tall figure leaning against one of the pillars with an open Arthimancy textbook in one hand and a basket in the other - those eyes which John had many times stared into longingly were skimming rapidly along the page, making sure that no words were missed. John was vaguely aware that Greg was still speaking, but he didn't process a single word. He gave him a quick "See you later," and immediately made his way over to his boyfriend.</p><p>"Hello John," Sherlock stated cooly without tearing his eyes away from the book. John raised an eyebrow and glanced at the amount of pupils around them that were still making their way to class.</p><p>"That could've been anyone. You didn't even look up."</p><p>"I can always tell when you're approaching. You walk a lot quicker on Wednesdays and Fridays even though you have the dullest lessons, suggesting your excited about something. And today you have lessons all day, hence why you're walking a bit hunched over - you have 5 textbooks in your bag, heavy textbooks. That and the fact that you always clear your throat before you reach me, you never know you're doing it. That suggests-"</p><p>"Shut up. Come on, we have double Defence," John cut him off and rolled his eyes.</p><p>The Ravenclaw frowned and marked his page, closing his book and walking beside John. "Boring. I have no time for Entwhistle - he's cheating on his wife with the head of The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office in the Ministry. Let's do something a bit more exciting."</p><p>"Like what?"</p><p>"Picnic in the forbidden Forest. ...Could be dangerous," he added with a smirk and sideways glance.</p><p>"You are going to get us expelled one of these days Sherlock."</p><p>"Don't be silly, McGonagall likes me far too much for that. And Pomfrey adores it when you help out in the hospital wing. She would never allow it." John stumbled slightly down the hill but Sherlock grabbed hold of his hand and steadied him, not letting go for the rest of the way. John squeezed Sherlock's fingers tightly as they walked past Hagrid's hut and into the dark, tree-filled abyss.</p><p>---------------</p>
