  <u> Head </u>
</p><p> </p><p>Hair color: Ginger-Brunette (think Anakin Skywalkers hair, but more orange) Hair length: Hip length Hairstyle(every day): messy ponytail, thin braid in front of each ear. Hairstyle(every day): messy ponytail, thin braid in front of each ear. His eyes are a sith like yellow, but when he was born, they were a fluorescent emerald green. Diamond-shaped face, almond eyes, thin top lip but thicker bottom lip. </p><p> </p><p>
  <u> Torso </u>
</p><p> </p><p>Total height is 7'2, and he used to be in a D38 bra in his human form, but in his naga form, he's in an AA32(yes, he has small tiddies, no he doesn't care, having big tits made him dysphoric anyway.) There are scars on his torso from the abuse he suffered through as a child. He's super skinny, and you can almost see his ribs through his skin. He is <strong><em><u>VERY</u></em></strong> pale (almost Ghirahim level pale) and he's extremely prone to sunburn, so he carries around a few bottles of Coppertone sport SPF 50 sunscreen wherever he goes.</p><p>
  <u> Family </u>
</p><p>His younger siblings, Riju, Kaname, and Yuki, are the smol beans that he will lay down his life for. (Kaname ain't exactly short lol) They may only be his adopted siblings, but he protects them like a mother protects her child. They are both Lgbtq+ in some way, with Kaname being Bigender/pansexual and Yuki being Queer(sexuality and gender identity.) Legolas, his biological little brother(by two minutes) refuses to admit that he's the shortest one of the family.</p>
