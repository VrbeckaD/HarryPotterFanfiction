    <p>      Every so often you can make a tremendously awful mistake yes. But want to know what's even rarer? Realizing whilst in the middle of, or just a little bit after that you make said mistake. Trouble is, you can't quite take it back after you've done it can you?<br/> Right then she was in the middle of said realization. Euphoria tingled all the way down her toes. Her arms were tightly wrapped around him. Back arching clean off the mattress in some places. Oh, and not to mention that magical place where they were still joined together. Something pressed against her head, a kiss accompanied by a deep sigh. Slowly, almost gingerly he lifted away from her.<br/>      Glasses askew, and that stubborn messy hair sticking to his forehead with sweat. Still panting he grinned at her, that same silly grin but in a whole new different context. Making her also shoot a stupid grin in return.</p><p> </p><p>      "You're so beautiful." No I love you? That's ok, her heart only mildly shattered at that. After all, she knew her place. To lessen the blow she rolled her eyes, a half snort escaping her lips as she tried to catch her breath. "I mean it love, you're so bloody beautiful." Stop it, please stop it. She wants to plead with him. Because her eyes are already stinging, her heart is still racing, but there's a broken sob caught in her chest. Stop it, don't be so kind because I really will fall in love with you. She wants to tell him all of this. Yet she knows there's no going back once she does.<br/>      Falling from the graces of James Potter hurts, but falling completely out of his life would shatter her. Wouldn't it?</p><p> </p><p>      "No James, you're the beautiful one." He lets out a roar of laughter at this, making her chuckle as well. Oh this has to be the worst mistake of her entire life and she knows it. But for now she'll push away melancholy, shove it to the most forgotten corners of her mind. She can't bear to soil this moment with her guilt, even though she deserves it; because James Potter just let himself fall next to her on the bed. With a content sigh he's pulling her closer to his chest. Pulling away from him she sits up, just one last thing. Daintily she plucks his glasses off and sets them down carefully on the nightstand beside her.</p><p> </p><p>     This was a tremendous mistake. Yet there was no way to undo it. Best she could do, at least for her pride, would be to vanish. But not now, not quite yet. Maybe in the morning, maybe she would make a memory potion or cast a spell. Anything really because she knows she's not the one.</p>
