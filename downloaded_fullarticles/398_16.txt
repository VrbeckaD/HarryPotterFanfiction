    <p>A lot can be learned from life inside a cupboard. Now that’s not to say it’s a preferable situation over, well, most other living spaces, but there are upsides. For Boy, one of the best things about his cupboard is that it is too small for raging walrus-like uncles to get into. Boy was rejoicing in this helpful fact, curled up in the smallest corner of his cupboard, for once only nursing a few bruises. He had learned something today, though he forgot one of his uncle’s main rules in his excitement. Today he learned his name.</p><p>Harry James Potter.</p><p>It had a decent ring to it, Boy, or Harry rather, supposed. He had been Boy for as long as he could recall, although it made sense that he had a name, it would take some time for him to get used to. The five-year-old was rather good at assimilating to new situations, an aftereffect of his Uncle’s favorite game, “let’s change the rules and only tell Boy once he’s broken one”.</p><p>School was soon Harry’s favorite place to be. Despite his cousin's efforts to make sure Harry miserable, he found himself happy despite Dudley scaring off all potential friends. Upon learning to read, the library became a haven for the small wizard. The librarians wouldn’t put up with noise, so Dudley and his friends never got to stay long. The sheer amount of knowledge available was enthralling. Going outside for recess quickly became something to avoid at all costs in Harry’s book, mainly because of Harry Hunting. After three weeks of Harry Hunting and one unexplainable trip to the school roof, he swore off the playground for the time being.</p><p>By the end of the first term, Boy had learned a few more lessons from his uncle. One: he will always be Boy at home. Freaks don’t get normal people names. Two: freaks don’t do better than Duddiums, despite the fact that it is hard to do worse than the dim chubby boy. And three: freaks don’t have friends. The few children that dared try and befriend Boy were quickly scared off by Dudley and his gang.<br/>By the end of primary school, Harry was quite the paradox for the teachers. He could answer any and every question correctly when asked verbally, but any of his official tests showed him to be at the very bottom of his class. Harry had not been idle in school, despite his Uncle’s restrictions, he refused to hold himself back. He had practically lived in the library, eating up the information like some kind of machine. He did not read for the sake of reading, however, while he did enjoy reading, it was what he could do with the information that kept him coming back for more. One book, in particular, made quite the difference in Harry’s early years</p><p><u>The Organized Mind</u> was a helpful tool for Harry to build his own safe haven. The book described a way to organize your thoughts by picturing a place you knew well and ‘storing’ information, such as memories or information from school in different places, making them easier to find when needed. The main recommendation was your bedroom, a place most people could recall from memory without a problem. Harry, however, found the idea of spending even more time in his cupboard, even if it was in his mind, quite distasteful. He instead took the harder road and crafted his own mindscape. Every night before bed he made his way into his safe haven.</p><p>He began with a bedroom. Not one like the one Dudley had, cluttered with meaningless things, but rather one like rooms he had read about. It was simple at first. Just a simple bed and bookshelves. But as he progressed it grew, soon the room was furnished with a large four poster bed, wardrobe, and a desk. A window looked onto grounds not unlike a forest, with trees towering high above the imagined room. It was upon realizing that he could make a world past the single room that Harry began adding more rooms to his little house, for that is what it became. A library housed all the wonderful information he gathered from school. An office became a place for him to think, many a work in progress was left in the ‘drawers’ of his large desk. His bedroom was his place of peace. He would lay down on the bed and clear his mind of anything and everything bothering him, which most of the time ended up being some injury or another. His house did come with a cupboard, though it took quite a bit of deliberation before he did so, but he needed a place for negative memories. All the information and memories from his life at the Dursleys was locked away under the stairs as he often was.</p><p>Harry was in his fourth year of primary school when he first felt it. There was something in his forest and it felt wrong. As if it didn’t belong. While he spent quite a bit of time ignoring it, he eventually reached the point of action on the feeling. He did what any other nine-year-old would do in his situation. He hid from it. The picture window in his bedroom became just that, a picture, as he moved his entire ‘house’ underground. He imagines miles upon miles of dirt and rock above him, separating from the strange dark entity that lived within the forest of his mind.</p><p>The summer was the worst time of the year for Harry. Mostly because Harry wasn’t allowed to exist. Petunia and Vernon’s slave, Boy, lived in his place. Boy rarely left the property, and the Walrus had no reason to avoid bruising Boy, as there was no one to take notice. When strange things happened around Boy he would be ‘properly punished’. The week after the snake incident was the worst week he had endured in years. He wasn’t fed once the entire time and had to sneak drinks of water from the bathroom sink during his few blessed bathroom breaks. The day of his release he was near delirious from hunger, which was the only reason his brain could come up with for the letter currently in his hands. There was a letter addressed to him. Not to Boy, but to Harry James Potter, The cupboard under the stairs, 4 Privet Drive, Littl- <em>wait! How did they know about the cupboard?</em> Snapping out of his food-starved haze Harry further scrutinized the letter. <em>Who could-</em></p><p>“BOY! GET YOUR SKINNY ASS IN HERE! WHERE IS MY MAIL?”</p><p>Startled out of his thought process, he quickly shoved the letter into his cupboard and hurried into the kitchen with the stack of mail in hand.</p><p>“Right here, Uncle.”</p><p>He set the mail down in front of his uncle, his shoulders hunched and his head bowed, as he awaited the punishment that was sure to come for his slowness. The meaty hand brought down to cuff Boy aside the head held force enough to send him stumbling.</p><p>“You’ll remember your place BOY, no dallying. When I ask you to do something you DO IT, post haste!” Boy didn’t dare look up at his uncle, knowing eye contact was seen as defiance. He also knew that if he were to look he would be met with the sight of his uncles purpling face as he ranted on. “Now off with you, back to your cupboard.” Petunia shoved the stale ends of the bread loaf into his hands before ushering him back out of the kitchen. The food was quickly scarfed down, as he didn’t want to give his shrunken stomach time to refuse the sudden food.</p><p>Full for the first time in what felt like forever, Harry cautiously pulled on the string that lit the bulb in his cupboard, retrieving the envelope from where he had tossed it earlier.</p><p>HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY</p><p>Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore<br/>(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf.

What is this, some kind of prank? A bit complex for Dudley…</em> It was then that Harry began thought back to all of his ‘freakish’ behavior, just last week for example, he set that snake on Dudley at the zoo. Not to mention when he turned Ms. Manning’s hair blue, or when he ended up on the roof on the playground. Witchcraft actually made sense in these circumstances… <em>But how to get these supplies, surely you can’t buy cauldrons and a wand in London?</em> For that matter, how does he reply? They await<em> my owl? Perhaps… I’ll look for one when I go out to weed the garden tomorrow. They must have sent one if they expect me to reply this way.</em></p><p>As Harry had expected, a nondescript barn owl was sat in a tree behind the Dursley house. Making sure Petunia was busy inside the house, he quickly made his way over to the tree, reply in hand. The owl flew down on silent wings and took the piece of notebook paper from the small boy’s hands before flying off.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>To whom it may concern,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I would like to formally accept my invitation to your school and also inquire where I can find the supplies listed on my letter. I would also like instructions for how I am to get to Hogwarts on September first.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Thank you,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry James Potter</em>
</p><p>With the letter sent, Harry went back to work, resigned to his position until the return of the owl.</p><p>+++</p><p>It was three grueling days before the owl returned with his letter. He was once again slaving over his aunt’s garden when a letter was unceremoniously dropped in front of him from above. His only warning was a soft hoot before the bird flew off once more. Apparently, Harry thought with amusement, they aren’t expecting me to reply this time. Tucking the letter away in the waistband of his pants, he paused momentarily at the extra weight in one corner of the envelope. A bit more than just a letter then. Well, only one way to find out what else they had sent, and he wouldn't be able to open it until he was back in his cupboard.</p><p>When he was finally sent back to his cupboard for the night, he ripped open the letter, wildly curious as to what it could contain.</p><p>
  <em>Mr. Potter,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We at Hogwarts are pleased to receive your acceptance. You will find the entrance to Diagon Alley through the pub “The Leaky Cauldron” visible from muggle London. The entrance can be found next to 192 Baker Street, London. The sign should be visible to your aunt, as she made the trip once before with her sister, your mother, and thusly will not be affected by the muggle repelling charm. This key is to your Gringotts trust vault, left to you by your parents. As for your arrival at Hogwarts, your ticket for the Hogwarts express should have been included in your acceptance letter. You will find the entrance to platform 9 ¾ between the barriers of platform 9 and 10. Just push your cart through the wall, it is an illusion hiding the door. I’m sure if you ask your aunt she can tell you more about it. We await your arrival.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Deputy Headmistress,</em>

  <em>Minerva McGonagall</em>
</p><p>The weight it turned out, was a key. A vault key to be exact. Apparently, his parents had left him some money, wizarding money at that. Now he just had to get to the bank it was stored at and get his supplies… easier said than done.</p><p>+++</p><p>Harry’s plan was not without fault, but it was the best he could do with the given circumstances. There was a week until Harry would be expected to board the train to Hogwarts and he had yet to acquire his supplies. The reason for this was the amount of time it took Harry to stash away enough cash and spare change for a taxi fare to London. The weekend before the first of September Harry had finally snuck enough change and bills from around the house to make his escape.</p><p>Wearing the nicest clothing he owned (which were still almost three sizes too big for him) pockets full of bills and spare change, key tied to a piece of twine around his neck, Harry Potter left the hell hole he called a home for the past ten years for good.<em> I refuse to return here if I don’t have to, Privet drive has never been my home.</em> His back turned to the house, Harry did not see the flash of light that emanated from the home in response to his thoughts. Instead, he made his way forward to the next chapter of his young life. Somewhere in Scotland, a small spinning silver instrument went still.</p>
