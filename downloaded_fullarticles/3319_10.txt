    <p>“We’ve someone in the holding cell.”</p><p>“Already?” Harry rubbed his face. Merlin, he needed a holiday.</p><p>Dean didn’t smile. “Yes, and you won’t believe who it is.”</p><p>“We’ve finally nabbed Mundungus?” He brightened.</p><p>“Nope.” Dean snorted. “Why don’t you go down there and take a look for yourself?”</p><p>Harry frowned and set down his coffee cup. He took the lift to the jail, only mildly interested. His shoulders ached. He blinked hard and muffled a yawn.</p><p>The Ministry’s jail was medieval: the walls rough stone, the cells heavy iron. Nothing about it implied <i>justice</i> or <i>fair trial</i>. He imagined fingernails broken off in the cracked mortar.</p><p>“Good Morning, Harry,” said Tortoise Wilks, the ancient guard. He was always chipper, but Harry had the sneaking suspicion he liked his job a little <i>too much</i>. There was a strange glint in his eyes.</p><p>“Morning,” Harry said. “Just here to see our new guest.”</p><p>Wilks smiled. “He hasn’t been a problem, though he won’t stop pacing.”</p><p>“Very good.” Harry hated that he sounded like Robards. He listened closely. Yes, he could hear the man’s footsteps.</p><p>Wilks waved his wand and the bars behind his desk vanished. Harry nodded, then steeled himself for whatever surprise awaited him.</p><p>The torches on the wall brightened as he neared the holding cell. He considered taking out his wand but settled for leaving his holster unclasped.</p><p>At the end of the corridor, behind the chilled bars of a cell, stood Draco Malfoy.</p><p>“Oh,” Malfoy said, stepping back.</p><p>Harry stilled. How long had it been since he’d last seen Malfoy?</p><p>“What happened?” Harry flinched. He should’ve read the Auror report before coming down there.</p><p>Malfoy hugged himself with his long arms. His teeth chattered. “I’m cold.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s the idea.” Harry hesitated. He wanted to cast a Warming Charm on Malfoy. “You look tired. Were you up all night?”</p><p>“I woke up very early so I could have a chat with Mr Blackwood.” Malfoy’s eyes shone in anger.</p><p>“Blackwood? The shop owner?”</p><p>Malfoy nodded. “He was my employer . . . he owed me things.”</p><p>“Things?”</p><p>“Money. Ingredients.” Malfoy hit his thigh with a closed fist. “I’ve been such an <i>idiot</i>.”</p><p>“Don’t hit yourself. Some people might take it as aggressive.” Harry looked Malfoy up and down, trying to get a read on him. His clothes were in tatters, and fresh bruising snaked up his neck. He was thin and long, and strangely elegant. “What were you doing for Blackwood?”</p><p>“I was running his shop, obviously.”</p><p>“It’s not obvious to me.” Harry couldn’t imagine Malfoy running a shop. He couldn’t imagine Malfoy doing much of anything.</p><p>“Do you know when the Ministry will be done with me?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. The Ministry sometimes toyed with former Death Eaters. He really needed to get back up to his desk to read the Auror report. “I’ll return.”</p><p>“Sure,” Malfoy said.</p><p>Back at the DMLE, Harry went to the records office. He rapped his knuckles against the open door. “Has the Malfoy report been processed?”</p><p>Mrs Davies startled. “Oh, Harry, dear.”</p><p>“Sorry. Do you have the Malfoy report?”</p><p>“From this morning? Yes, I’m sure.” Davies, blinking through her bottle cap spectacles, riffled through the paperwork on her desk. She levitated the file over to him. “Poor old Mr Blackwood.”</p><p>“You read it?” Harry flipped through the first couple of pages.</p><p>“Oh, no, but I can’t imagine he fared well against a Death Eater. I’m surprised he isn’t dead.”</p><p>Frowning, Harry went back to his desk. There was a cup of steaming coffee waiting for him.</p><p>“Bless you,” Harry said.</p><p>Dean shrugged. “So, what did Malfoy look like?”</p><p>Harry blew on his coffee and took a sip. “He looked a mess . . . but, weirdly, he was the same.”</p><p>“Still as haughty as ever?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he said, though he wasn’t sure if <i>haughty</i> was the right word. Malfoy looked proud, but also . . . feminine. No, that wasn’t it either. He looked . . . attractive.</p><p>He sat down at his desk. He had to push back a mountain of parchment to make room. A tower of files fell to the ground, but he ignored it. That was a problem for future Harry.</p><p>He took notes as he read the report. Malfoy’d been working off the books for Blackwood for a year. Malfoy would arrive early and leave late, and Blackwood asked him to disguise his face when interacting with customers, so it was probable no one besides Blackwood had seen him during the course of the year. Harry imagined the Auror on scene snorting and thinking, <i>How convenient</i>.</p><p>Recently, Blackwood had stopped paying Malfoy. First, it was because there was a problem at Gringotts, then Blackwood became “ill” and didn’t show up at the shop for weeks. That morning Malfoy’d gone to Blackwood’s residence to demand his wages.</p><p>Harry sat back in his chair, groaning a little. His lower back was already beginning to hurt. He didn’t understand why the Ministry provided them with such hard chairs. They were wizards, for Merlin’s sake. He cast a cushioning charm and returned to the report.</p><p>According to Blackwood, Malfoy had been blackmailing him for months. He would disguise himself and wait outside Blackwood’s home to rough him up if he didn’t pay. He’d promised to tell the Ministry about Blackwood illegally employing him. He’d also promised to tell how Blackwood got his hands on illegal potion ingredients, which Blackwood insisted never happened.</p><p>Whatever the truth, their confrontation had turned violent. Blackwood was cut up from a few curses, and Malfoy had been choked.  </p><p>“Is he guilty?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Dunno.” Harry leaned back in his chair again. He stretched his arms over his head and closed his eyes. He didn’t know what he thought about it. Both situations could’ve easily happened, but it didn’t look good for Malfoy. The Ministry would definitely side with Blackwood merely because he wasn’t a former Death Eater.</p><p>Harry stood. He needed something to do.</p><p>“Going to the canteen.” Harry gestured to Dean’s cup. “Want a refill?”</p><p>Dean frowned a little. “We have coffee in the office.”</p><p>“Is that a no?”</p><p>“I’m good.” Dean turned back to his paperwork.</p><p>Harry headed for the lift. He wondered what Malfoy was doing right now. Probably still pacing. He felt Malfoy's presence like a heat through the floor.</p><p>In the corridor, his steps slowed. He didn’t want to go to the canteen. He wanted . . . to do something. He wanted to see Malfoy again. He passed Robards’ office and knocked before really thinking about it.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Harry went inside. Robards glared from his desk. “Your paperwork is late.” He whacked a pile of files at his elbow. “Davies won’t leave me alone until you get your work in.”</p><p>“She didn’t say anything to me.” Harry took a deep breath. “So, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Draco Malfoy. We’ve got him in a cell downstairs.”</p><p>“Right. What about him?”</p><p>“How long are we planning on holding him?”</p><p>Robards looked at Harry like he was an imbecile. “No idea, Potter. I’m Head Auror, not a mind reader.”</p><p>“I understand.” He did his best to keep his voice even. He pointed to the pile of files. “But as Head Auror, you receive the case file for every arrest. I just want an update.”</p><p>Robards’ woolly brows lowered over his eyes. “I will not be rushed by a subordinate . . . even one with your <i>experience</i>.”</p><p>“Of course, sir.”</p><p>“I don’t like how you demand special treatment,” Robards said, huffing. He yanked the top file from the pile and shoved it at Harry. “As it turns out, I’d just finished it before you stormed in here. He’s good to go after he stops by Mortona to schedule his court hearing. Make sure you escort him home and conduct a proper search of his flat.”</p><p>Harry flipped through the file. It had Robards' recommendations as well as Malfoy's criminal record. He only glanced at the first page, knowing the second page was all about the war trials.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>“I think Malfoy needs to get a very good solicitor.” Robards laughed roughly.</p><p>Harry left before he threw Malfoy’s file in Robards’ face.</p><p>He went back to his desk. Dean glanced up, and frowned. “Where’s your coffee?”</p><p>“No idea,” Harry said distantly. He perched on his sodding chair and stared without seeing. Malfoy was lucky that he hadn’t pulled this shit twenty years ago . . . though maybe he had and just hadn’t gotten caught.</p><p>Harry sighed loudly and rubbed hard at his face. He was agitated. Something was <i>wrong</i>. He needed to act . . . but he didn’t know what to do.</p><p>“All right?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Yeah.” Harry sighed. “I think.”</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>“Yeah . . . it’s just the Malfoy thing.”</p><p>Dean blinked. “Is he innocent?”</p><p>“No idea.” Harry paused. “I dunno . . . I don’t like how we treat them.”</p><p>“Them?”</p><p>Harry didn’t want to say it. “Death Eaters.”</p><p>“We don’t mistreat them.”</p><p>“No?” Harry stood and picked up Robards’ case file. He didn’t want to be in this small space with Dean.</p><p>“Are you going back to Malfoy?”</p><p>“Maybe.” </p><p>Harry wandered from their office. He didn’t really know where he was going until he looked up and found Wilks in front of him.</p><p>“Back again?”</p><p>“Yes, Robards wants him released.”</p><p>Wilks and Harry walked to the jail cell. Malfoy looked startled to see them. This irritated Harry for some reason.</p><p>“Robards gave me permission to release you,” Harry said. “You just need to stop by our clerk to schedule your court date.”</p><p>Wilks tapped his wand on the cell and the bars dissolved. Malfoy stepped forward hesitantly; he flinched like they might attack him. “Is this your doing?” he asked Harry.</p><p>“No,” Harry said, “but I do have to escort you back home.”</p><p>Leaving the jail, they went to the clerk’s office to speak to Mortona. Malfoy agreed to come back in November. Mortona notified him that he’d be sent directly to Azkaban if he tried to flee the country.</p><p>“Yes, I understand,” Malfoy said. When he finished signing documents, he turned to Harry, looking almost bored. “Now what?”</p><p>“Now I escort you home.”</p><p>Taking the lift up to the Ministry lobby, they stopped in the designated Apparition Corridor. Harry grabbed Malfoy’s sleeve, and together they spun and disappeared. They appeared on a dirty street in Knockturn, startling a witch on the kerb. She recognized Harry and rushed away.</p><p>Malfoy snorted. “You don’t need to stay.”</p><p>“I need to see that you get back home before I release you.”</p><p>Malfoy huffed. He unlocked a side door. The building’s exterior was grimy with a few broken windows; the foyer and rickety staircase smelled of rotten fish. Harry followed silently. He <i>knew</i> the Malfoys had lost the Manor, but he’d still imagined Draco Malfoy living there.</p><p>Shouts came from the first flat on the second level. Harry raised his wand and contemplated knocking.</p><p>“Don’t bother,” Malfoy said, unlocking the door across the corridor. “They are always rowing.” Harry hesitated before going inside. He didn’t know what he was going to find.</p><p>The lounge was quite small with a little sofa and mismatched arms chairs. The wallpaper flaked from the corners, the fireplace like a black hole in the wall. Some of the paintings looked like they’d come right from the Manor.</p><p>“Isn’t this dangerous?” Harry motioned to the paintings. “I’m sure this art is worth some Galleons.”</p><p>“I put a curse on them. I pity the poor thief who tries to get away with them.” He paused, looking thoughtful. “Is that illegal?”</p><p>“Yes.” Harry walked toward the kitchen, then realized he was being rude. “Can I look around?”</p><p>“If you have to.”</p><p>“I have to.” Harry went into the kitchen, which was small and old but clean. “Do you have a house-elf?”</p><p>This made Malfoy laugh. “No.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “It’s a fair question. I know house-elves are very expensive now, but there are also elves who were too loyal to leave their wizarding families.”</p><p>“None of our elves were loyal.” Malfoy looked down at the floor.</p><p>“Oh.” There was a kettle on the counter. Strangely, Harry wanted Malfoy to ask him to stay for tea. He waited, but Malfoy didn’t say anything.</p><p>“I need to see the other rooms,” Harry said finally.</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>They went back into the lounge. Harry proceeded to the toilet at the end of the small corridor. He opened the cabinet to peek at what kind of potions Malfoy had in stock. Just the usual pain relievers.</p><p>“Are you going to riffle through my dirty pants, too?” Malfoy asked.</p><p>Harry looked at him. “Only if you want me to.”</p><p>Malfoy’s expression darkened. “Oh, I do.”</p><p>“Brilliant,” Harry muttered, and sneaked past Malfoy. There were two bedrooms. Both doors were closed. Harry reached for the first doorknob, but Malfoy put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“That’s Scorpius’ old room. Do you really need to see it?”</p><p>“I know it’s awkward, but yes, I do. It’s my job.” Harry did his best not to focus on Malfoy’s light touch.</p><p>“Fine.” Malfoy stepped back.</p><p>Behind the door was a small but tidy room. Books teetered high against all four walls. On the bedside table was a photograph of Scorpius and Malfoy. Harry wanted to pick it up to examine it.</p><p>“How is Scorpius by the way?” Harry asked.</p><p>Malfoy stiffened. “He’s fine. Very successful. Incredibly good looking. Damn near perfect.”</p><p>“Perfect?” Harry whistled. “That’s saying a lot. My kids are nowhere near perfect.”</p><p>Malfoy jerked. “Are we done in here?”</p><p>“In a second.” Harry Spelled open the small cupboard in the corner. Inside were more books and a few pairs of old shoes. A piece of paper fell to the ground. Harry picked it up. It was a childish drawing of a dragon fighting a wizard with no nose and red evil eyes. “Is this supposed to be . . . ?”</p><p>Malfoy glanced at the drawing. “Yes.”</p><p>“I’m surprised you talked to him about Tom Riddle at such an early age.”</p><p>There was so much tension in Malfoy’s body. His shoulders were stiff, his expression hard.“I had to. People would corner him in public and yell, ‘Do you know what your daddy did?’”</p><p>“Merlin.” Harry placed the drawing back on a pile of books. “I can’t imagine doing that to a child.”</p><p>“Yes, well, I wished they had only yelled at me.” Malfoy took a deep breath. “I deserved it. Scorpius certainly did not.”</p><p>Harry stared at him. Malfoy wouldn’t meet his eyes. Harry had the strange urge to touch him. This Malfoy shocked him. He had a hard time believing he was real. He wanted to squeeze Malfoy, to feel his heat. Then maybe it would be real.</p><p>“Let’s go to your room now,” Harry said, and his voice was rough.</p><p>Malfoy led them into the other room. It was bigger than Scorpius’ but not by much. The bed was big and the duvet looked comfortable. <i>That’s where Malfoy shags</i>, he thought.</p><p>“There are two cupboards in here.” Malfoy pointed.</p><p>“Thanks.” Harry spelled open the cupboards. They were filled with clothes and old boxes. “What’s inside the boxes?”</p><p>“Photographs. Important parchment. Some of my parents’ old things.”</p><p>Harry cast a spell to detect Dark magic. One box glowed red. “What’s in there?”</p><p>“Bloody hell,” Malfoy muttered. He Summoned the box from the cupboard to land on his bed. He opened the lid and pulled out a pocket watch. “I’m sure this is what set off your spell. Don’t touch it.”</p><p>“Is it cursed?”</p><p>Malfoy shrugged. “Most likely.”</p><p>“Why do you have it?”</p><p>“Family heirloom.” Malfoy smiled grimly. “It was one of the few things I managed to get my hands on before your lot took everything.”</p><p>“My lot?”</p><p>“The Ministry.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “I did my best to help your family.”</p><p>“Thank you again.” Malfoy’s voice was empty.</p><p>Harry inhaled. “But . . . yes . . . some things need to change at the Ministry.”</p><p>Malfoy looked startled. He motioned to the watch. “Are you going to take it?”</p><p>“No. You keep it. Just don’t let anyone get their hands on it.”</p><p>“I haven’t let that happen so far.”</p><p>“Good.” Harry turned in place. He wanted to go through all the drawers in here. He wanted to learn Malfoy’s secrets. He shook his head. Not this again.</p><p>“Thank you for letting me into your home,” Harry said.</p><p>Malfoy snorted. “I didn’t have a choice. Will you release me now?”</p><p>“Yes.” Harry went back to the lounge. He wanted to sit down on the sofa, but didn’t. To release Malfoy he had to grasp his wrists. He hesitated. He was afraid to touch his bare skin.</p><p>“Go on then.”</p><p>“Right.” Harry grasped his wrists. They felt warm, a bit fragile. He tapped his wand to Malfoy’s skin. An icy blue link briefly appeared around his joints, then disappeared. Malfoy gasped softly.</p><p>Harry stepped back. “All good.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Malfoy didn’t meet his eyes again.</p><p>“Right.” He walked to the front door, then paused. “Don’t go looking for Mr Blackwood.”</p><p>Malfoy straightened his back. “I’m not stupid.”</p><p>Harry nodded. “And if you encounter any problems . . . come see me.”</p><p>“<i>Any</i> problems?” Malfoy cocked an eyebrow.</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean.”</p><p>“Thank you for the offer.”</p><p>Harry forced himself to leave. He paused on the kerb outside Malfoy’s building. He inhaled deeply. Why was he so rattled? He’d done countless searches of suspect homes. Why had this one unnerved him so much?</p><p>He glanced up at Malfoy’s little window. He wanted to catch Malfoy staring back at him, but the white curtain remained motionless. Malfoy had no interest in him. He sighed and Disapparated.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Grimmauld Place was lonelier that night. With the kids moved out, and Ginny now living with Dean, it was difficult for Harry to go home after work. The house made him feel like he had <i>no one</i>. It made him feel like his whole life had only been mistake after mistake.<p>He poured himself a tumbler of whiskey and sat down heavily on his sofa. Merlin. He was exhausted even though not much had happened. After his run-in with Malfoy, he’d spent the rest of the day catching up on paperwork at his desk.</p><p>He was depressed. He was competent at his job; he was an okay father. Yet he felt like everything he did amounted to nothing. In the mornings, he lay in bed and blinked groggily up at the ceiling. <i>How many more years of this do I have?</i> he thought. Wizards lived too fucking long.</p><p>He supposed it was a reaction to his children leaving him. For twenty years, his main identities had been father and Auror. Much of his free time had been devoted to his children. When at work, he rarely thought of himself. It’d all been a coping mechanism. He saw that now. He’d surrounded himself with the family he’d never had; he’d spoiled his children in all the ways he’d dreamed in the cupboard. The war was <i>in the past</i>; now he was a father, a husband, a professional. His childhood couldn’t hurt him anymore.</p><p>He turned on the telly but his mind kept straying to Malfoy. Fuck. He fancied Malfoy. He was too old and lonely to not be honest with himself. He was desperate to shag men. Malfoy was his same age but he didn’t look it. He was fit. He was . . . Merlin. He looked like the years had never touched him. </p><p>He hated that he was attracted to men. No, that was too harsh. It was just so damn <i>inconvenient</i>. He hadn’t fancied boys in Hogwarts, or at least he hadn’t realized his thoughts were attraction. Sometimes he’d thought about kissing them. This never made him question his sexuality. He had been so naive.</p><p>God, he missed his children. They were grown; they didn’t need him anymore. Jamie was playing professional Quidditch; Al was tracking dragons with his uncle. Lily was doing . . . something. Harry frowned. She’d been struggling for a while now. He’d thought Al was the one he needed to worry about, but Al had finally mellowed out. Harry had overlooked Lily; he’d assumed her silence meant she was happy. All her professors had loved her at Hogwarts.</p><p>He turned off the telly, too distracted to enjoy the sound. Grimmauld Place creaked when no one else was around. It felt like the walls were closing in on him. He stood. He had to get out. He wanted to find a fit bloke to shag. No, he was too old for that.</p><p>He went upstairs to his en-suite to take a quick shower. When he emerged, he stood in front of the mirror and stared. He had scars and more hair on his chest. Harry turned to the side. He was getting a pouch. The mirror giggled at him. </p><p>Did Malfoy have scars? When he looked in the mirror, did he only see what the years had done to his body?</p><p>Sighing, Harry went to his armoire to find something to wear. He wasn’t going out to pull. He wasn’t. He just wanted to walk around and enjoy London at night. Maybe he’d stop at a Muggle pub for a drink.</p><p>He pulled on some jeans, a black shirt, and the jacket that made him feel daring and reckless like Sirius. Doing something with his hair was useless, so he ran his fingers through the wet locks and thought, <i>Fuck it</i>.</p><p>Outside, the London air was cool against his damp neck. He checked in on his neighbors, then sneaked into his usual deserted alleyway and Disapparated.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he wasn’t in Muggle London. He was back in Knockturn Alley. He cursed. This was where he wanted to be.</p><p>Knockturn Alley was different at night. More people roamed the twists and turns, and Harry spotted a few surly creatures. Up ahead, a hag with horns and a bulbous nose sold elixirs that glowed in the dark. It was illegal to sell magical edibles on the street, but Harry ignored her. He was too tired for trouble, and he realized long ago that he’d never end <i>all</i> illegal activity.</p><p>He came to a halt in front of Malfoy’s building. There were many tenants in the building. Somebody was playing the wireless and frying up some sausage. A few shrieks came from the ground level. Harry spied through the curtains. A wizard wearing bright orange goggles wrestled a shrieking plant. Harry recognized the plant. It was illegal.</p><p>This was why Aurors never went <i>looking</i> for trouble. He’d be here all night if he’d been on patrol.</p><p>He rubbed at his face. What was he doing? <i>Be honest, Potter</i>. He was here because he wanted to see Malfoy again. He wanted to sneak into the building and knock on Malfoy’s door. He wanted Malfoy to invite him in. He wanted Malfoy to kiss him and cup him through his trousers. Maybe Malfoy would smirk and whisper, <i>Bad boy.</i></p><p>Christ. Harry sucked in breath. He couldn’t think about this standing in the middle of Knockturn. He needed to take himself home. He’d have a nice wank and fall asleep, and when he woke up tomorrow, Malfoy would be a distant memory.</p><p>He heard a whimper. He paused, his heartbeat picking up. He pulled out his wand and followed the sound. Around the corner, at the end of a small alcove for rubbish bins, lay a man. Harry hurried forward. It couldn’t be—</p><p>Harry dropped to his knees. Malfoy was unconscious and badly beaten. His white blond hair was smeared with blood, his mouth split in two places.</p><p>“Malfoy? Can you hear me?”</p><p>Malfoy groaned and his eyelids fluttered. Harry cast a quick diagnostic spell on him. No internal damage or deadly curses. Harry sighed in relief. He Conjured up a handkerchief dripping with water. He cleaned the grit from Malfoy’s cheeks, then whispered, “Malfoy. Wake up.” He shook him just a little.</p><p>Groaning again, Malfoy opened his eyes. “W-what?”</p><p>“It’s Harry—Harry Potter. You are injured and lying outside your building. Do you understand me?”</p><p>“Help me up,” Malfoy said.</p><p>Harry gently helped him to his feet. Malfoy rested heavily against him.</p><p>“I’m taking you to hospital,” Harry said.</p><p>Malfoy jerked. “No, I’m fine.”</p><p>“But . . . you need someone to look you over. Make sure nothing’s wrong.”</p><p>“Can’t you ask someone you know? I will pay them.” Malfoy’s voice sounded distant.</p><p>Harry didn’t know what to do. “I know someone who is a healer, but I doubt you want to see them.”</p><p>“I don’t mind Granger. Not anymore.” Malfoy clutched at Harry’s shoulders, his head lolling.</p><p>“I’m taking you upstairs.” Harry pulled him closer.</p><p>“<i>No.</i> Take me to an inn or something. I’m— ” Malfoy murmured the last bit of his sentence.</p><p>“Malfoy. Open your eyes.” Harry shook him a little. “Don’t fall asleep yet.” Malfoy didn’t respond.</p><p>“Christ,” Harry said, and pulled Malfoy flushed against him. He spun them as gently as he could, and they Disapparated with a pop. When they reappeared, they stood in the middle of Harry’s lounge. Harry helped Malfoy to the sofa.</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes were closed again. His face looked better after Harry’s cleaning, but he was quite pale. His chest moved gently in sleep, and he looked . . . good. <i>Stop it</i>, Harry thought, and went to his fireplace.</p><p>He threw in some Floo powder and called, “Laurel Cottage!” Green flames whirled in front of his face. When his vision cleared, he stared into Hermione and Ron’s cozy lounge.</p><p>“Hello? Anyone home?”</p><p>Their cat came running from the kitchen, meowing.</p><p>“Nick! Lovely to see you! Go get Hermione or Ron.”</p><p>“No need. I’m here.” Hermione crouched down in front of him. She blinked at his expression. “Is everything all right?”</p><p>“No.” He paused, unsure of how to proceed. “I’ve got Malfoy here. He’s unconscious.”</p><p>“Malfoy? <i>Draco Malfoy?</i>”</p><p>Harry grimaced. “Yes . . . it’s a bit of a long story. He’s been attacked and doesn’t want to go to hospital.”</p><p>“Take him there anyway!” Hermione’s eyes were wide. “The healers are not going to harm him.”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “No . . . I couldn’t do that.”</p><p>She was frowning deeply. “I suppose you want me to check him over?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>She sighed. “All right. Let me get some supplies, then I’ll be over.” She ended the Floo.</p><p>Harry went back to Malfoy, who was still unconscious. He Conjured another wet cloth to clean up his neck and hands. He pushed up Malfoy’s sleeves just a little to wipe at his forearms. The Mark stood out against his pale skin. Harry quickly pulled his sleeve back down.</p><p>The Floo flared to life and Hermione emerged in a cloud of green flames. She shook Floo powder from her hair and approached Malfoy on the sofa. She carried her healer bag.</p><p>“Thanks for coming,” Harry said.</p><p>“Of course.” She began casting intricate spells on Malfoy. One spell encased him in a shimmering gold bubble, then popped a few moments later. She pulled back his eyelids and shined a light into his pupils with her wand. Malfoy tried to jerk away in his sleep.</p><p>“Is he going to be okay?”</p><p>“Yes.” She took up a chair to think. “If he can move away from my touch, then he’s going to be just fine.”</p><p>“What do you think happened to him?”</p><p>She shrugged. “It looks like he lost a fight.” She eyed Harry. “Do <i>you</i> know what happened?”</p><p>He hesitated. “I have my theories.” He sat down next to her. “Malfoy was brought in this morning after he had a row with Mr Blackwood. You know the shopkeeper?”</p><p>Hermione looked confused. “Mr Blackwood is so docile.”</p><p>“Is he? I don’t really know.” Harry rubbed at his chin. “If I had to guess, I’d say Mr Blackwood or maybe someone close to Mr Blackwood came back to finish Malfoy off.”</p><p>“That’s what happened,” Malfoy murmured. His eyes fluttered open briefly.</p><p>Hermione moved closer. “How are you feeling? What is your vision like?”</p><p>“Shit.” Malfoy gulped thickly. “May I have some water?”</p><p>Harry Conjured a glass and cast <i>Aguamenti</i>. Hermione helped raise Malfoy so he could drink from the glass.</p><p>After drinking his fill, Malfoy groaned and laid back against the sofa cushion. “Merlin.”</p><p>“You need to go to hospital,” Hermione said.</p><p>“No.” Malfoy tried to open his eyes. “I’ll be fine. I promise.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head. “You are still stubborn, I see.”</p><p>“I’m not <i>stubborn</i>. I just know what’s best for me.”</p><p>“Sure.” Hermione stood and motioned for Harry to follow her into the foyer. She handed Harry a potion when they were alone. “This should heal him quickly. It’s also a pain reliever and sleeping aide. I’m pretty sure he will be all right, but it’s on him if he doesn’t want to go to St Mungo’s.”</p><p>Harry smiled gratefully. “Thank you for coming over. How’s everyone?”</p><p>“We’re all just cracking on.” She peered at him closely. “What’s really going on here? Do you know something about Malfoy?”</p><p>“No. I just—” He took a deep breath. “The way the Ministry treats former Death Eaters is wrong. You should’ve seen everyone at work today. They were damn near <i>gleeful</i> about Malfoy being arrested. Did you see his neck? He’d been <i>choked</i> and I had to damn near beg Robards to release him.”</p><p>Hermione was silent for a moment. “You already know how I feel about the Ministry. There’s a reason why I became a healer.” She sighed again and looked away. Frown lines hugged her mouth. “I don’t know what to say. Just . . . be careful. You must remember the politics.”</p><p>“How in the hell could I forget?”</p><p>She smiled sadly and patted his cheek. “You are so idealistic. It’s why I will always follow you.”</p><p>He shook his head. He was smiling. “Me, idealistic? How ironic coming from you.”</p><p>She shrugged. “What can I say? I’ve grown up.” She waved goodbye and went to the Floo. With a roar of flames, she was gone.</p><p>Harry was grinning when he knelt back down next to Malfoy. “She gave me this potion for you.”</p><p>“I hope it makes me sleep like the dead.”</p><p>“I think it will.” Harry hesitated, remembering what Hermione had said. He didn’t want to do anything rash. “Do you . . . want to stay the night?”</p><p>Malfoy blinked at him. He was silent for a moment. “You’d—” He cleared his throat. “You’d let me do that?”</p><p>Harry nodded. He couldn’t meet Malfoy’s eyes. It was ridiculous, but he felt himself blushing.</p><p>“There are a few rooms here with comfortable beds. It’s been . . . empty since the kids moved out.”</p><p>Malfoy stared at him. “Wow, Potter.” He laughed weakly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing. I just can’t believe you offered your home to me. <i>You.</i>”</p><p>“What’s wrong with me?”</p><p>“We used to hate each other.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t read his expression. “That was thirty years ago. You’ve changed  . . . you’re a father now.”</p><p>“Does that mean I’m trustworthy now? Because I reproduced?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Just one night.” Malfoy stood shakily, and nearly lost his balance. Harry grabbed him.</p><p>“I’ll help you upstairs.”</p><p>Malfoy sighed. “Okay.” </p><p>They climbed the stairs together, Malfoy breathing heavily in Harry’s ear. They turned into the closest guest room, which was a bit dusty and overlooked.</p><p>“Here,” Harry said, and guided him to the bed. Malfoy groaned and laid down. Harry missed the warmth of his body. “Do you need anything?”</p><p>“Just the potion.” </p><p>Harry resisted the urge to help him drink it; instead he watched Malfoy’s long throat as he swallowed the vial’s contents.</p><p>“Don’t hesitate to ask me for help.”</p><p>“Potter,” Malfoy said, already somewhere else. Harry left him to his dreams.</p><p>He spent his night chugging beers and watching rubbish telly. It numbed him. He never stopped glancing at the darkened staircase, listening for creaking footfalls. He kipped on the sofa, and when he awoke in the middle of the night, he swore it was because someone had whispered in his ear. He took himself up to bed.</p><p>In the morning, Harry made coffee and tried not to wait for Malfoy to come downstairs. He ate toast with a bit of butter, crumbs falling down his front. He listened for footsteps again.</p><p>“It smells delicious in here.”</p><p>Harry turned, startled. Malfoy was in the doorway, his hair wet from a shower. The potion had done wonders: most of his injuries had healed, but there was still faint bruising on his neck and his mouth. </p><p>Malfoy smiled faintly. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”</p><p>“How did you—Christ.” Harry laughed and poured him some coffee. His heart still pounded quickly. “Do you take milk and sugar?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you.” Malfoy stirred in a little milk, a long stream of sugar. He sipped his coffee in silence. “I should go.”</p><p>“Okay,” Harry said, trying not to be awkward. He didn’t want Malfoy to leave. “You should go to the Ministry. File a report about what happened last night.”</p><p>Malfoy stared out the charmed window. “I need to find another place to live before nightfall.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “Do you fear another attack?”</p><p>“Maybe.” Malfoy didn’t look too bothered. “Anyway, thank you for giving me a bed to sleep in.”</p><p>“You should stay until you find another job.”</p><p>Malfoy blinked. “Why would you let me?”</p><p>“I want to help you.” Harry leaned against the counter, attempting to look as casual as possible. “I’ve known you since we were kids. Your safety matters to me.”</p><p>“I need to pack up my flat.”</p><p>“We can find a place together,” Harry said.</p><p>Malfoy grimaced. “I don’t have the . . . means to store my belongings while we look.”</p><p>“Like I said: I’m willing to help you.”</p><p>Malfoy turned away, his back hunched. “I don’t want your handouts.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t be a handout. I know you’re good for it.”</p><p>“No, you don’t.” He faced Harry again. “Thank you, but my son’s in town right now. He’ll help me.”</p><p>“I want to ensure your safety. Let me come with you.”</p><p>“No,” Malfoy said. “Not when my son is with me.”</p><p>“You don’t want me to see your son?”</p><p>Malfoy’s face twitched. “No.”</p><p>“Let me at least hire some elves to help.”</p><p>Malfoy stared at the floor. “Elves would be a great relief,” he muttered.</p><p>“Then it’s settled! I’ll Floo some elves after you leave.”</p><p>“Fine. Thank you very much.” Malfoy climbed the stairs to the lounge. A few moments later, Harry heard the roar of the Floo. Malfoy was gone.</p><p>Sighing, Harry finished his coffee and washed the few dishes from breakfast. He went upstairs to the Floo. Elves were in high demand, and you usually needed to reserve their services months in advance, but he was also Harry Potter. Most in the wizarding world bent over backwards to help him. The goblins even smiled at him when he popped in at Gringotts. He didn’t know if they had forgiven him for breaking into their bank, or if they were playing the long game to get their revenge.</p><p>In the Floo, he spoke to a bored-looking elf named Beatrice. She laughed. “Same day reservation? That’s impossible.”</p><p>He paused, hating himself a little. “I’m Harry Potter.”</p><p>“Sure, and I’m Merlin. I believe we’re done here.”</p><p>He leaned forward and pushed back his hair to reveal his scar. “See.”</p><p>“So what? That could easily be manipulated. I’m going to need a lot more proof.”</p><p>“Wait one moment.” He pulled his head out and Summoned his Order of Merlin from his bedroom. He heard a drawer in his armoire crash to the floor. A large gold medal attached to green ribbon floated down to his hand. He re-entered the Floo and shoved the medal forward so Beatrice could clearly see it. “I’m telling the truth.”</p><p>Beatrice read the medal; she touched it with a gnarled finger. Her eyes widened. “Beatrice is sorry, Mr Potter! Beatrice is a bad elf!”</p><p>“Stop,” he said. “I don’t need you to chastise yourself. I just want four—no five elves at the flat of Draco Malfoy in Knockturn Alley as soon as possible. Send me the bill, of course.”</p><p>“Very well, sir.” Beatrice bowed. “The elves will be there in the next fifteen minutes.”</p><p>“Thank you,” he said, and ended the connection. He remained on the floor. He was a prat but . . . it was for a good cause. That had to be worth something, right? He shook his head and rose from the floor. He could never complain about his fame again.</p><p>He had to go to work. He was already a little late; he considered owling Robards that he was sick, but he didn’t want to be stuck in Grimmauld Place all day. He fetched his Auror robes.</p><p>Work was uneventful. Nobody asked about Malfoy, and Harry kept his mouth shut about the attack. If he was truly going to help Malfoy, then he couldn’t make any rash decisions that would alienate him. Harry would keep his secrets until they had an actual plan.</p><p>“Thank Merlin it’s Friday,” Dean said, stretching in his chair. He glanced at his watch. “And almost time to go home!”</p><p>“Yeah.” Harry barely glanced at him; he was disappointed that Dean seemed to have completely forgotten about Malfoy being arrested yesterday. Was Harry expecting too much from his colleagues?</p><p>He delayed his return home. He didn’t want to face the fact that Malfoy wasn’t going to stay with him; he thought about when the next time he would see Malfoy again and remembered that he’d be forced to face a judge at some point; this lifted his mood, then made him guilty. What the bloody hell was wrong with him?</p><p>He considered popping in at Ron and Hermione’s, but they might ask him questions about Malfoy, and he couldn’t face that. He couldn’t face the possibility that they might not ask about Malfoy. What if they turned out to be just as indifferent as Dean?</p><p>No, he needed to avoid them for now. He needed to steady himself. Clear his mind. He went to his favorite Muggle pub for a pint. He watched Muggle football in the corner. He wondered if Malfoy had managed to move all his belongings into his new flat. He wondered if Malfoy had left his scent on the pillow he’d slept on. Christ.</p><p>When he finally made it home, he was startled to see a glow of light coming from the second level. Heart thumping, he took the stairs two at a time. Malfoy was on the floor of the same guest room, an old trunk opened before him. He looked up at Harry, his expression mildly fearful.</p><p>“Were you able to pack up all your stuff?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Malfoy stood and brushed his hands together. “I have something for you.” He picked up the cursed gold watch with a handkerchief and tried to hand it to Harry.</p><p>“Are you trying to kill me?” He smiled weakly.</p><p>“No—it’s for the elves and rent—if your offer from this morning still stands. It’s worth a lot of money.”</p><p>Harry crossed his arms. “I don’t want it.”</p><p>Malfoy made a frustrated noise. “Please take it! I don’t want to be your charity case.”</p><p>“You’re not my charity case. Like I said before, I know you’re good for it.”</p><p>Malfoy put the pocket watch back in the trunk. His jaw pulsed. “You are determined to humiliate me.”</p><p>“No, of course not. I know you will repay me.”</p><p>Malfoy stared at him. He was trying to read something in Harry’s face. “If you want something from me, just say it.”</p><p>Harry dropped his arms. His cheeks grew warm. “I don’t want anything from you. I want you to find another position. I want you to be able to support yourself.”</p><p>“Fine. I’m desperate enough to accept.” He waved around the room. “Is it okay if I stay in this room, or would you prefer me somewhere else?”</p><p>“You can stay anywhere you like.”                                                 	</p><p>Malfoy laughed without humor. “And what about this house? Do I need to protect myself in any way?”</p><p>“No, I don’t think so.” Harry frowned, thinking hard. “We had Curse Breakers clear out all the Dark magic before Jamie was born.”</p><p>“That makes sense.” Malfoy sat down heavily on the bed. “I’m exhausted.”</p><p>“I’ll let you go to bed.” Harry went to the door, not sure if he should say anything more. “Goodnight. I’m glad the elves were able to help you.”</p><p>“Yes,” Malfoy said, his face turned away.</p><p>Harry closed the door behind him. He moved down the hall to his own bedroom, lost in thought. God, he wanted to make Malfoy happy.  It was strange to feel this strongly about him. This protective of him. They used to be school rivals; he used to think Malfoy was the biggest prat.</p><p>He readied for bed, then laid down. </p><p>His attraction was sudden, inexplicable. No, that wasn’t entirely true. He knew why he wanted to shag Malfoy. Malfoy was incredibly fit; he had an arse that made Harry sweat. He’d fight Harry. He’d make him feel something. Ever since his children had moved out, Harry’d been so bored. Malfoy made him look forward to the day. </p><p>The next morning, Harry decided to give Malfoy his space. The man must’ve been mortified to have nowhere else to go. Even Harry was disturbed by Malfoy’s lack of affluence. Malfoy had grown up in a house fit for royalty. Now he was homeless.</p><p>Harry went out for the day. He went to the cinema, then ate a hamburger wrapped in paper. Ketchup stained his fingers. He walked the park closest to Grimmauld Place. The day was cloudy, a bit chilled. A carpet of lichen covered the ground. He imagined lying down and being covered, too.</p><p>When he returned home, Malfoy had dismantled a newspaper on the sofa. He hid behind the sports section. “Your son played a good game yesterday.”</p><p>Harry didn’t know if he should sit down. “Luck was on his side.”</p><p>“Yes, he definitely got that from you.” Malfoy peered over the newspaper at him. “You’ve got ketchup on your chin.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry licked his fingers and rubbed at his chin. He tried not to be embarrassed.</p><p>Malfoy snorted. “You’re such a barbarian.”</p><p><i>You’ve no idea</i>, Harry wanted to reply. His media unit caught his attention. “You’ve been through my film collection.”</p><p>Malfoy frowned. “How in the hell did you notice?”</p><p>“They aren’t in their proper order.” Harry crouched in front of all his old dvds. “Do Muggle things fascinate you?”</p><p>“Sometimes.” Malfoy looked back at his newspaper.</p><p>“Did any catch your eye?” Harry grinned.</p><p>“Not really. It was all absurd.”</p><p>“Have you ever been to the cinema?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Oh? We should go sometime. I went today. It was a superhero film. Not very good.”</p><p>“A superhero film?”</p><p>“Yeah . . . blokes in capes fighting crime. That sort of thing.”</p><p>“Capes? It sounds ridiculous.”</p><p>“Oh, it is. That’s what makes it fun.”</p><p>Malfoy huffed and grabbed for another section of the newspaper. “I don’t have time for <i>fun</i>.”</p><p>“Pity.” Harry went to the kitchen. There was soup on the cooker. Barley and veg. He ladled himself a small serving and climbed back up to the lounge. “You cooked.”</p><p>“Yes, I hope you don’t mind.”</p><p>Harry tried some of the soup. “Oh, I don’t mind. This is delicious.” The barley was hearty, the veg fresh and still a little crisp. “I’m shocked.”</p><p>“Because I can cook?” Malfoy paused. “Did I add enough salt?”</p><p>“I think so.” Harry laughed. “Merlin, you’re full of surprises.”</p><p>Malfoy found something important in the newspaper and neatly tore it out with his wand.</p><p>“Are you searching for another job?”</p><p>“Of course I am.”</p><p>“Do you think that’s wise?”</p><p>“I don’t care if it’s wise or not. I’ve got to eat. I can’t stay here forever.”</p><p>Harry shifted. His spoon scraped the bottom of his bowl. “You can stay as long as you need.”</p><p>“<i>My hero</i>.” Malfoy fluttered his eyes at him; Harry looked away quickly, afraid he’d blush.</p><p>“I’m not joking. So many laws limit former . . . supporters of Riddle, and I’d hate for you to get nabbed for something else. I’m not saying don’t look for jobs, but just be careful. Your arrest changes things.”</p><p>“It’s my life, Potter. You don’t need to tell me to be careful. I’ve been living with limitations for decades.”</p><p>Harry stared down at his bowl. He knew he was bumbling through these conversations with Malfoy; he knew he came across as insensitive. “Obviously, I have more to learn.”</p><p>“Don’t you think I deserve it?” Malfoy’s voice was strange, which made Harry look at him. Malfoy seemed quizzical, a bit amused.</p><p>“Why would I think that? You were just a child.”</p><p>“You were a child too. Somehow you were able to choose the right side.”</p><p>“We had completely different upbringings. You’d be the same way if you spent the first ten years of your life in a cupboard.”</p><p>“I’m surprised you haven’t killed them for doing that to you.”</p><p>Harry caught his breath. “Dudley is better now. We talk sometimes. Petunia and Vernon are too pathetic to kill.”</p><p>“Doesn’t it shock you to hear me talk about killing people? Doesn’t it make you want to believe old Blackwood?”</p><p>“Should I believe Blackwood?” Harry watched him.</p><p>“No, that man is a corrupt prat.” Malfoy licked his lips. “But I’ve done things that would make you hate me if you knew.”</p><p>Harry was silent. The truth was that he didn’t want to know what Malfoy had done. The truth was that Malfoy could admit to murder and Harry would probably still want to fuck him. “I’m sure you had to do a lot to survive, especially in the beginning.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What matters to me is whether you are willing to put it all behind you. I can’t help you if you are determined to hurt others.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s all behind me.” Malfoy laughed. “Trust me.”</p><p>Harry took his bowl back to the kitchen. He’d intended to ask Malfoy to watch a film with him, but he suddenly wanted to be alone. He wanted to take things slower. Maybe what he was doing for Malfoy was a mistake.</p><p>He said goodnight to Malfoy, then went up to bed. In his en-suite, he brushed his teeth and changed into his pyjamas. His bed was soft, comforting. He wasn’t tired. He tossed and turned. What had Malfoy done that would make Harry hate him? What if he’d killed after the war? What if he was involved in some criminal operation?</p><p>Sighing, Harry punched his pillow. After decades as an Auror, he knew that crime could be a slippery slope; he knew there was a fine line between crime fighter and criminal. Corruption was a constant reality at the Ministry.</p><p>Was he making excuses for Malfoy? Definitely. Did Malfoy and other former Death Eaters need an ally like Harry? Yeah. He just needed to find the courage to stand up for them.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Harry woke up late on Monday morning. He sent a hurried owl to Robards and Dean, then jumped in the shower. With his hair still dripping wet, he pulled on his Auror robes and laced up his boots with his wand. He was starving. He raced down to the kitchen and nearly knocked into Malfoy on his way to the fridge.<p>“Oh, sorry,” Harry said. “I’m still trying to wake up.”</p><p>“I’ve made coffee. Do you want toast?”</p><p>“Ta,” Harry said, and poured himself a cup. He took a sip. It was very good. “You should open your own coffee shop.”</p><p>“What?” Malfoy laughed at him.</p><p>Harry went for the bread bin, but Malfoy was already there. They knocked hands; Harry smelled the lingering scent of soap and aftershave.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Malfoy asked, amused. “I said I was making you toast.”</p><p>“Okay.” Harry didn’t move away. Malfoy’s arm brushed against him as he slathered the bread with butter. Malfoy slid him the plate, then stepped back.</p><p>“Do you want an egg?”</p><p>“No thanks,” Harry said around his bite of toast. “I must dash.”</p><p>“I’ll have time on my hands today. Do you want me to do any chores around the house?”</p><p>“Do whatever you would like,” Harry said, checking his watch. “I don’t expect anything.”</p><p>“That’s a risky thing to say.”</p><p>Harry forced himself to slow down enough to think. “Don’t touch the children’s rooms. Be careful if you go poking in the attic.”</p><p>“What about your room? What can I do in there?” Malfoy casually sipped his coffee.</p><p>Harry stared at him. “You can do whatever you like.” He turned away, not wanting Malfoy to know how little it took to get him excited.</p><p>“Got it,” Malfoy said, and Harry couldn’t read his tone. Maybe he was being sarcastic.</p><p>“Thanks for breakfast,” Harry said, swallowing the last of his toast. “I wish I could stay, but—”</p><p>“Don’t mind me,” Malfoy said. “I hope you have a good day at work.”</p><p>Harry nodded and went upstairs to the Floo. He never thought Malfoy could be so . . . <i>domestic</i>.</p><p>When he arrived at his office, he dropped down in his chair and pulled the closest file to him. He was still behind in his paperwork, and Robards would have his head if he didn’t finish it today.</p><p>He tried focusing on the file in front of him, but his mind wandered. He felt like he’d squandered the weekend. Malfoy had spent most of it in the guest room, and Harry had been too self conscious to interrupt him.</p><p>“An owl came for you.” Dean floated the folded parchment to Harry.</p><p>“Did you get my owl about being late?”</p><p>“Yeah; as you can see, you missed a lot.”</p><p>Harry laughed and opened the note. He brightened. It was from Jamie. <i>Dad - I’ve got a meeting at the Ministry today. Lunch? –JSP</i> Harry sent off his reply, smiling.</p><p>“Good news?”</p><p>“Yeah—it’s from Jamie. He wants to have lunch with me.”</p><p>Dean whistled. “Surprising. He hasn’t been around ours in months.”</p><p>Harry brightened even more. He knew it wasn’t nice or mature, but he loved when it seemed as if his kids liked him more. Jamie hadn’t been to Gin’s in <i>months</i>, but he was asking Harry to lunch.</p><p>He took out his favorite Muggle pen; he had too much writing to do it with a quill. He put his head down and focused his energy into finishing all his administrative tasks; he had other plans for the hours after lunch.</p><p>Jamie showed up at his office around noon. “Hi, Dad,” he said, smiling.</p><p>“Hey,” Harry said, trying to play it cool. He pulled Jamie into a big hug. “How’ve you been holding up?”</p><p>“Fine.” Jamie waved to Dean. “Good to see you.”</p><p>“Floo your mum,” Dean said.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Jamie said, smirking.</p><p>“Where do you want to go?” Harry asked.</p><p>Jamie shrugged. “Somewhere Muggle.”</p><p>“Of course.” Harry shouldered off his robes and grabbed his coat. They headed for ground level. They went to their usual place, which was a hole in the wall caff. They took up a table in the corner; Jamie smiled a little too brightly at the young waitress.</p><p>“Any particular reason you asked me to lunch?” Harry glanced over the menu.</p><p>“Nope, I just wanted to see you.”</p><p>“Feeling guilty about forgetting your old dad?”</p><p>Jamie smiled tightly. “Something like that.” They gave their orders to the waitress, then settled into a comfortable silence for a minute or two.</p><p>“By the way, congratulations on the win,” Harry said.</p><p>Jamie shook his head. “Thanks, but let’s not talk about Quidditch.”</p><p>“All right.” Harry had expected this; even at Hogwarts, Jamie didn’t like him commenting on his playing. He constantly had to battle the comparison to his parents; he was constantly asked about his father. “Have you heard from your sister?”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>Jamie sighed. “It means that she wants to be left alone right now.”</p><p>Harry’s stomach lurched. “Do you know why? Is she in trouble?”</p><p>“Dunno.” Jamie shrugged. “She didn’t really say, but she seemed . . . sad.”</p><p>“Sadder than usual?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Jamie looked away. “I shouldn’t have said that. She told me not to talk to you or Mum about her.”</p><p>“Christ.” Harry felt guilty. Why was he fixated on helping Malfoy when his own daughter was struggling? “Do you think I should owl her?”</p><p>“No, just let her be.” Jamie fiddled with his napkin. “She wasn’t starving or anything like that. She just wanted space.”</p><p>“<i>Starving?</i> We give her money. Why would she be starving?”</p><p>“That’s not what I said.”</p><p>Harry rubbed his forehead. He missed his little girl. “What about Al? Have you heard from him?”</p><p>“He’s too busy chasing all that Eastern European fanny to talk to me.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry tried not to grimace; he knew his children had sex lives, but it was still something he didn’t want to talk or think about.</p><p>“I’m dating somebody,” Jamie said, not looking at Harry.</p><p>“That’s great! How’s it going?”</p><p>“Fine, I guess. Aunt Hermione knows her. She works at St Mungo’s.”</p><p>Harry beamed with pride. Jamie was dating someone of substance; he could have an endless line of models fawning over him, and he chose someone who works with Hermione. “I hope you like her.”</p><p>“I might like her too much.” Jamie laughed a little.</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>“Nothing. I’m just being weird.” He finally looked at Harry. “What about you? Having better luck with men than women?”</p><p>Harry fumbled with his napkin. It still shocked him to hear his children ask him about men so casually. It’d been his dark secret for so long. “Oh, uh . . . that’s a good question.”</p><p>“What does that mean?” Jamie mimicked.</p><p>“Prat.” Harry grinned. </p><p>The waitress dropped off their food; Jamie had ordered the corned beef, Harry his usual chicken sandwich.</p><p>“When should I expect to meet Dad Number Two?”</p><p>Harry choked on his food. “What the hell?”</p><p>Jamie snickered. “So nothing serious yet. You toot it and boot it.”</p><p>“I <i>what</i>?”</p><p>Jamie laughed loudly. “Something I got from an American friend.”</p><p>“Finish your lunch.” Harry pretended to glare.</p><p>They fell into a comfortable silence again.</p><p>“This is random, but it’s something that’s been on my mind,” Harry said.</p><p>“Go for it.”</p><p>“Do you think we’ve treated former Death Eaters right?”</p><p>Jamie frowned. “I’ve never thought about it before. I don’t know if we need to treat them right.”</p><p>“And when I say ‘we,’ I mean the Ministry, society.”</p><p>“Oh.” Jamie finished his corned beef. “Why has this been on your mind?”</p><p>“I’ve been doubtful for a while.”</p><p>“Doubtful?”</p><p>“As an Auror, I’ve seen how . . . assumptions . . . grudges ruin lives.”</p><p>Jamie was thinking hard; he always looked the most like Gin when he did this. “You know, the children of Mulciber and Avery had a hard go of it at Hogwarts. They didn’t even know their fathers; I think they were raised in orphanages or by distant relatives. They were still like vipers to us. I know I did my best to avoid them.”</p><p>“Why did you do that?”</p><p>“Because I was an insensitive git. I was a child. I avoided them because everyone else did.”</p><p>“That’s quite brave of you to admit,” Harry said.</p><p>“I guess.”</p><p>“What do you think I should do?”</p><p>The waitress came by to take their empty plates. Jamie wiped his mouth and played with some sugar packets. “You’re Harry Potter, so if anyone can take down the establishment, it’s you, but I dunno. Be careful. There are still loads of angry prats out there.”</p><p>Harry nodded. “Yeah. I think you’re right. Anything you want to tell me before we get out of here?” He said this almost as a joke, but Jamie hesitated like he really did have something to add.</p><p>“I have a favor to ask.” Jamie raised his hands. “It’s small, don’t worry. You know how I told you I’m dating someone who works at St Mungo’s? Well, she’s planning a benefit for the hospital, and she was wondering if you could attend. I wanted to ask you about it before giving her an answer.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry always steeled himself when his children asked for favors. “What’s her name? Does the benefit seem harmless?”</p><p>“Magnolia. The benefit is for research on this type of disease that eats away at magical abilities. She talks about it all the time, but I can’t remember the name.”</p><p>“How long have you been dating her?”</p><p>“Almost a year now,” Jamie said, shrugging.</p><p>“You’ve been with her for almost a year but I’m just now hearing about it! Why didn’t you bring her to Christmas?”</p><p>Jamie gave him a look. “You know why. I just didn’t want to.”</p><p>“Fine, fine,” Harry said, grumpy. “It’s your life. And yes, I’ll attend this benefit since it seems like the only opportunity I’ll get to meet this woman.”</p><p>“Great! Everything is still in the planning stages. They don’t have a set date or anything.”</p><p>Harry thought for a moment. “Tell Magnolia that I’m attending strictly as a guest. No autograph signing. No sodding speeches.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t do that to you, Dad.”</p><p>Harry raised his eyebrow.</p>

</center>After lunch, Harry went back to the Ministry alone. He was happy that he’d seen Jamie, but it always made him fret when his children kept things from him. They weren’t as close-knit as he wanted. Was there anything he could do to stop the growing distance?<p>He went down to the Ministry’s archives to look through the public records. The large room was cold and dusty, with countless shelves filled with countless books and loose parchment. Overwhelmed, Harry began with a large book that listed all the laws passed since the end of the War. He thought this would be straightforward, but he quickly realized that the Wizengamot passed many laws he didn’t know about. So many laws. Gulping, he tapped his wand against the book and searched for the words “Death Eater.” Only a handful of laws popped up, which was a relief.</p><p>But no: Right below a law that mentioned Death Eaters was one that seemed to address their ability to find employment but didn’t mention them by name:</p><p>
  <i>The following persons may not apply for an employment licence in respect of any licensable activity—</i>
</p><p>
  <i>(a) a person listed as a disqualified person in paragraph 4 of law 320555 or any of paragraphs 6 to 17 of Schedules 1, 3, or 8 where the time limit for any appeal against that disqualification has expired or where, if an appeal was made, that appeal was refused;</i><br/>
<i>(b) a person listed in any of paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 of Schedule 1, 3, or 8 as having held a licence which was revoked where the time limit for any appeal against that revocation has expired or where, if an appeal was made, that appeal was refused.</i><br/>
<i>(c) any licence granted or renewed, or held by, a person mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) of laws 320556-75, 320580-85, 32115-32131 is automatically revoked.</i>
</p><p>His eyes glazed over. <i>What?</i></p><p>Perhaps he was going about this the wrong way. He began at law 320555 and forced himself to read every paragraph slowly, repeatedly, until he decoded each meaning. He found laws limiting employment, spell work, even travel. He knew about most of these limitations, but it was stunning to see them all laid out in print. It was stunning that most former Death Eaters would need a solicitor to even begin understanding how they could live within the law. </p><p>He stood abruptly. He was going home.</p><p>The wonderful smell of stew greeted him at Grimmauld Place. He found Malfoy in the kitchen, directing a spoon to stir a large pot on the cooker and a knife to slice thick pieces of bread on the counter.</p><p>Candles burned softly on the scrubbed table and old walls. Darkness pressed against the charmed window, but Malfoy brightened everything around him. He had his sleeves rolled his, his back perfectly straight. A bit of his soft hair fell into his intelligent eyes.</p><p>“Please don’t think you have to cook for me everyday,” Harry said.</p><p>“It’s not a bother.” Smiling, Malfoy floated a glass of wine to him. How could a cruel mouth look so kissable? “Your fridge is quite impressive. It contains whatever I want.”</p><p>Harry sipped his wine, and nodded. “Molly had insisted I get it. She thought the convenience would help me eat healthy after Gin and the children left.”</p><p>“Did it?”</p><p>“Sometimes.” He laughed. “I want ice cream too much for it to be truly effective.” </p><p>Malfoy laughed too, and it warmed Harry.</p><p>They ate at the ancient table. Harry couldn’t help but stare; it was strange to see Malfoy where the Order had conducted their secret meetings. The war would’ve been very different if Malfoy had taken up Dumbledore’s offer to switch sides.</p><p>“What?” Malfoy said.</p><p>Harry finished chewing a bite. He sipped his wine. “I went through the Ministry’s records today. I tracked all the laws targeting former Death Eaters. It was remarkable. And infuriating.”</p><p>Malfoy nodded.</p><p>“The language is so . . . confusing. It reads like it was made confusing on purpose. There’s loads of times when the law doesn’t even mention former Death Eaters by name.”</p><p>“What else did you learn?”</p><p>“So many things! You can’t hold certain jobs or use certain spells. You can’t even travel to some countries!”</p><p>“I’m terrified they will pass a law that includes our <i>children</i> in all these restrictions. Scorpius lives in Spain now; I can’t visit him or live there with him, but at least he has that freedom.”</p><p>Harry gaped. “I didn’t even see where it barred you lot from going to Spain!”</p><p>“We can’t go to the continent period. They were afraid we’d go over there to regroup and recruit.”</p><p>“So you’re essentially separated from your son because of the law?” Harry took a bite of his stew, incensed.</p><p>“Yes.” Malfoy seemed amused. He looked down at his own bowl. “This isn’t anything new, Potter. These laws are decades old.”</p><p>For a moment, Harry thought he might sick up. He’d turned his back on all this; none of it had directly affected him and therefore he’d been able to raise his children and focus on his career without being bothered. Death Eaters hadn’t interested him like werewolf rights reform. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said quietly.</p><p>“Don’t. I can’t stand your pity.” Malfoy rose from the table and took his dirty dishes to the sink. He washed them with his wand, his back stiff. “I understand why they did it. Why they thought it was necessary after the War. I’m just so damn tired of struggling.”</p><p>“You were only a child.”</p><p>“I was old enough to know better.” Malfoy wiped his hands angrily. “I’m middle aged and I’m still making shit decisions.”</p><p>“Blackwood?”</p><p>“No, that wasn’t a shit decision. That was payback.” Malfoy smirked.</p><p>“The Ministry won’t see it that way.”</p><p>“I don’t care what the Ministry thinks. They could lock me up and throw away the key. And you know what? Maybe I’d deserve it.”</p><p>“Malfoy—” Harry went to stand.</p><p>“Don’t move. Are you finished with your dinner?”</p><p>“Yes.” He tried to read Malfoy.</p><p>Malfoy directed his dishes to the sink, then stood behind Harry. “Would you like a shoulder rub?”</p><p>His stomach twisted. “You don’t have to do it.”</p><p>“Do you want me to touch you?” Malfoy moved closer; Harry felt the heat of him.</p><p>“Yes,” he whispered.</p><p>Malfoy rested his hands on his shoulders. He circled his thumbs and felt Harry’s muscles with his fingertips. “You’re very tense. Your job must be very stressful.”</p><p>“Sometimes.” His voice was a croak.</p><p>“Will you let me make you feel good?”</p><p>Harry gulped; then gulped again. “You’re fucking with me.”</p><p>“Only a little.” Malfoy kneaded his poor muscles. Harry’s head fell back, and he moaned in his throat. “Does that feel good?”</p><p>“God.”</p><p>Malfoy spent a few minutes squeezing, caressing. He worked Harry over like he was dough, like he was something that needed to be soft enough to mold. “You like shagging men.”</p><p>Harry tried to turn to look at him, but Malfoy pressed his thumbs into his shoulder blades, causing him to melt.</p><p>“I . . . God, <i>yes</i>.”</p><p>“How the hell did you keep it from the papers?”</p><p>“Gin.”</p><p>“Your ex-wife? She didn’t want to humiliate you?”</p><p>“I never cheated on her. It was only after . . .”</p><p>Malfoy snorted. “Of course.” He dropped his hands and moved away.</p><p>Harry wanted to reach for him; he wanted to proposition Malfoy.</p><p>“You’ve had a long day. You should go upstairs and watch your cinema thing. I’ll finish up the cleaning.”</p><p>Hesitating, he tried to read Malfoy’s expression, but Malfoy turned to the sink. He stood shakily and left the kitchen. He’d give Malfoy his space.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>In the following week, Malfoy continued to cook for Harry. He also tidied the house and worked on the garden. Harry didn’t know what to think. Malfoy wasn’t his servant and he didn’t owe him anything. All of it made Harry feel incompetent. He was a forty-something child. He couldn’t be left alone. He couldn’t take care of himself. Gin had cooked all the meals; his children had constantly entertained him. Malfoy lit him up. He made Harry look forward to coming home.<p>Malfoy stayed on his mind. Made a home among the hiding memories. In the shower, Harry pressed his mouth to the misty tile imagining it was another mouth. Malfoy was probably a good kisser. He probably knew how to kiss men. Not that it was much different than kissing women, but maybe it was.</p><p>Harry had fucked men; he’d sucked them deep into his throat. He hadn’t snogged them. A few brief kisses; glancing tastes. He wanted to hold Malfoy to the sofa and snog him for hours. Like teenagers. Rutting. He wanted to make Malfoy come in his trousers.</p><p>Going to work became harder and harder. When the weekend arrived, Harry looked forward to spending a few days with him; but Malfoy packed himself a small bag and went to visit Scorpius in another part of London. “He’s finishing up his business here,” Malfoy said. “I need to catch him before he leaves the country.” Harry tried not to be disappointed. Once again alone in the house, he masturbated loudly and came chanting <i>Draco, Draco, Draco</i> in his head. Should he beg? Offer money? <i>Please don’t be offended; I’m just desperate to touch you.</i> What had the shoulder rub meant?</p><p>By Monday morning, Harry was depressed, ill-tempered. He was convinced that Malfoy would never come back. Malfoy had played him. He’d made Harry believe he was interested. It was his right to leave without a word.</p><p>At work, Dean laughed off Harry’s snarls; he bought Harry’s favorite for lunch and clapped him on the back. “Ask Robards for a field assignment. Get yourself out of this office.”</p><p>“No,” Harry said, chewing moodily. What if he encountered someone like Nott? No, he couldn’t bear it. He’d seen other Aurors mistreat former Death Eaters, and he’d done <i>nothing</i>. The guilt was overwhelming.</p><p>“All right,” Dean said.  </p><p>“Do you actually like this job?”</p><p>Dean set down his lunch. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean—the Ministry! Do you like what they do?”</p><p>“They?” Dean frowned. “We’re the Ministry. You’re the Ministry.”</p><p>“Me? I’m just an Auror.”</p><p>“You’re Harry Potter. You’ve always been the face of this place.”</p><p>“I don’t want to be the face. I don’t condone what goes on here.”</p><p>“What do you mean? Good things happen here. We fight crime. We manage the wizarding world.”</p><p>“What about the corruption, the discrimination?”</p><p>“We’re not perfect, but I don’t think it’s widespread. Aurors aren’t just out there arresting blokes for the sake of it.”</p><p>“What about former Death Eaters? Haven’t you seen colleagues mistreat them?”</p><p>“You mean blokes like Malfoy?” Dean laughed and shook his head. “They aren’t mistreated. They’re lucky that they aren’t in Azkaban. If I remember correctly, Malfoy never served time.”</p><p>They fell into an awkward silence. Harry opened and closed his mouth. He was desperate for Dean to understand, but as the silence persisted, Harry felt like the ground was swallowing him whole. He couldn’t trust Dean. He couldn’t trust anyone in this bloody place. He needed to go on holiday.</p><p>He went to Robards. “I need time off.”</p><p>Robards sighed and stood from his desk. He floated Harry a glass of whiskey. “I’m glad you’ve come to this decision on your own.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“There’s been talk. You’re spending too much time with those books in the archive. You’ve been mean to poor Mrs Davies. You need to take some time to clear your head. Get your priorities straight.”</p><p>“Right,” Harry said, his anger flaring. He put down the drink and gathered himself to his full height. “Have Mrs Davies send me the paperwork at home.” He went to the door.</p><p>“Harry,” Robards said. “We want you to come back. You’re essential to the Ministry.”</p><p>“Quite essential,” Harry said. “That’s why my arse has been behind a desk for years.” He left.</p><p>When he emerged from the Floo at Grimmauld Place, he was blind with anger. He couldn’t believe Dean, and he wanted to chuck Robards from a window. He felt like the loneliest person in the world.</p><p>There was movement above his head. Malfoy. He charged up the stairs, not really knowing what he was doing. Malfoy’s bedroom door was open; he was shifting through his wardrobe. He turned to smile at Harry. “Is there something wrong?”</p><p>God, Harry’d missed him. He looked good, so fucking good. Harry would fight every hateful prat for him. He’d do anything for him.</p><p>Harry came closer. He couldn’t speak. Malfoy backed away, slightly alarmed. “There is something wrong,” Malfoy said, his eyes wide. Harry crowded him against the wall. He kissed Malfoy. </p><p>Malfoy froze and blew out air through his nose. Harry attempted to deepen the kiss.</p><p>Malfoy pulled away. He was laughing. “I could be straight.”</p><p>“You’re not straight.” He tried to kiss Malfoy again, but he turned his face.</p><p>“I fancy women.”</p><p>Harry went cold. “Have I been misreading you this whole time?”</p><p>“No.” Malfoy touched his chest, his chin.</p><p>“I want you,” Harry said, almost choking. “I want you so fucking much.”</p><p>“I know.” Malfoy smiled faintly. “You practically vibrate with it.”</p><p>“You must think I’m pathetic.”</p><p>Malfoy pressed his mouth to his cheek, then moved away slightly. “There are things you don’t know.”</p><p>“I don’t care.”</p><p>“You would care if you knew.”</p><p>Harry spoke without thinking: “You’ve murdered.”</p><p>Malfoy flinched. “No. I mean, yes. Before. When I was a child.”</p><p>“And after?”</p><p>“Never. I’d rather kill myself.” Malfoy ground his palm into Harry’s erection. “I don’t want you to do anything you’d regret.”</p><p>“Christ.” Harry thrust into his hand, overwhelmed. “I can’t think when you’re touching me.”</p><p>Malfoy stepped back and crossed his arms. “Your timing is terrible. I only came back to change into my smart robes. Scorpius nabbed me an interview.”</p><p>It took Harry a moment to absorb this information. “Can you trust the employer?</p><p>Shrugging, Malfoy said, “I think so, but I’m desperate enough not to ask any questions. I just need them to give me a chance.”</p><p>“What would you be doing?”</p><p>“What I’ve always done: Brewing.”</p><p>Harry didn’t really know what to say. His face was very hot; he throbbed with arousal. “Good luck.”</p><p>Malfoy snorted and guided Harry from the room. “I have to get dressed.” He shut the door in Harry’s face.</p><p>Groaning, Harry went to his own room. He flopped down on his bed and flung an arm over his eyes. He was going to wank the moment Malfoy left for his interview.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Harry woke up to a sickening feeling in his stomach. The house was quiet, motionless. He assumed Malfoy hadn’t returned. He made himself breakfast but couldn’t really eat it. He had to do something. He had to <i>act</i>.<p>Harry didn’t know who could help him. He didn’t trust anyone at the Ministry to understand. He went to Southwold to visit Kingsley in his retirement. Maybe Kingsley knew how to shoulder grudges. Maybe he was brave enough to forgive.</p><p>Kingsley’s little cottage faced the sea, windswept, overrun by tourists. Harry walked by the sightseeing mums and wondered if there was a privacy charm on Kingsley’s house. The water beat against the pier and the sandy shore. Harry kept his head down.</p><p>He knocked and waited a moment. Kingsley’s eyes widened when he answered the door.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be at work?” Kingsley stepped aside and waved him in. They sat down in a tidy lounge with a small fire and two Otterhounds.</p><p>“No, I’m on holiday.”</p><p>“Can I get you tea? Fizzy drink?”</p><p>“No, thank you.” Harry sat back. He tried to be casual. “This is a beautiful place. Right by the water, too.”</p><p>“I’m surrounded by Muggles. They never leave. They got their fake lights and their metal hands. No need to ever go home.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “It’s how they communicate with one another now.”</p><p>“They should go home and stop yelling in my ear. I can’t even enjoy a cup of tea on the beach without being bothered.”</p><p>“Cast a charm. Mute them.”</p><p>Kingsley grinned. “I do.” There was a heavy pause. “I know you didn’t pop in just to say hello. I’m sure there is something you want to tell me.”</p><p>Harry hesitated. He had to control himself. “You’re right. I’ve come to talk about the Ministry. I . . . there’s a lot that has been disappointing me.”</p><p>“Is Robards not giving you assignments? Are you stuck behind the desk?”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Yeah, but that’s not what’s really bothering me. I’ve been poking around in the records.”</p><p>“Bad choice.”</p><p>“Right. Very bad choice.” He took a deep breath. “I think we’re discriminating against former Death Eaters.”</p><p>“Of course we are.”</p><p>Harry’s stomach dropped. “So you agree with it?”</p><p>“No, I don’t. I just understand why the Wizengamot did it; why they continue to do it.”</p><p>“I don’t understand.”</p><p>Kingsley sighed. “There are still a lot of people who haven’t forgotten. I don’t need to tell you this.”</p><p>“Yes.” Harry rubbed his face. “I just . . . if I can forgive, why can’t they?”</p><p>“You’ve always been remarkable. Most don’t have your heart, your tenacity.”</p><p>“Stop. You’ll make me blush.”</p><p>Kingsley snorted. “Are you thinking about doing something?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“It could get you sacked. I know Robards. He isn’t one for controversy.”</p><p>“No, he isn’t.” Harry sighed. “Honestly, I don’t know what my next step is. I just know I want to do something.”</p><p>“And you were hoping that I’d have some ideas.” Kingsley leaned back in his chair, petting one of his hounds. “I’m afraid I don’t have much to add. Only that you need to protect yourself. You won us the War, but that doesn’t mean you’re invincible. Gather a close few. Like you did during the War. Gather people who you can trust. Ask them to fight for you.”</p><p>Harry immediately thought of Ron and Hermione. It was funny, but he hadn’t considered asking for their help. He assumed they wouldn’t want anything to do with Malfoy or any other former Death Eater.</p><p>“Thank you.” Harry stood. “I apologize for dropping in like this.”</p><p>“One more thing,” Kingsley said. “Think hard about this. I know caution isn’t your best trait. Think hard about whether your job means anything to you. Whether you have any political ambitions. If you go against the Ministry, it might alienate you.”</p><p>“Yes, I’m aware.” Harry shook Kingsley’s hand. “You keep out of trouble, too. Don’t thrash any unsuspecting Muggles.”</p><p>Kingsley grinned. “I can’t promise anything.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>When Harry arrived home, he heard banging in the kitchen. He rushed downstairs, alarmed.<p>Malfoy was agitated; he was despairing. Harry hovered in the kitchen doorway, not sure if he should give him privacy.</p><p>“Did you not get the position?” Harry asked quietly.</p><p>“Of course not!” Draco threw down a dish towel, his shoulders hunched. “I’m <i>useless</i>. I’ve got nowhere to go. I’ve got no money to pay you.”</p><p>Harry came closer. It took everything in him not to squeeze Malfoy’s shoulder. “I don’t want your money.”</p><p>Malfoy turned to him. He crowded Harry against the wall. “This doesn’t need to be all one-sided. I can repay you; maybe not with gold but with something else.”</p><p>“Please, you don’t need to do anything,” Harry said. “Let me just help you.”</p><p>Malfoy cupped him through his trousers, his palm incredibly warm. “Don’t you want this?”</p><p>“Christ!” Harry shuddered and bucked into his hand.</p><p>Malfoy smirked and whispered: “Do you want me to be your whore?” He dropped to his knees.</p><p>“Not here,” Harry said, grabbing at his shoulders. “God, not here.”</p><p>Malfoy unbuttoned his trousers and fished his cock out. “Looks like you’re ready to me.” He sucked him into his mouth.</p><p>“God,” Harry said, his head thudding back on the wall. He couldn’t believe this was happening. Draco Malfoy was sucking him off. Malfoy quickly bobbed his head, slurping; he inhaled noisily through his nose and took him deep into his throat. Harry cried out; Malfoy was choking himself on his cock.</p><p>Malfoy came up, coughing, gasping. “Fuck into my mouth,” he rasped. He took Harry back into his mouth, all the way down; Harry flailed; he didn’t know where to rest his hands. He rocked gently into Malfoy’s throat, afraid he’d hurt him. </p><p>Impatient, Malfoy forced Harry’s hands to his head. Harry knew what he was asking him to do, but he hesitated. Malfoy moved on his cock faster and faster, his neck and back relaxed. He palmed Harry’s bollocks roughly.</p><p>“Fuck—I don’t want—”</p><p>“Do it,” Malfoy whispered, leaning back for air. “I deserve it.”</p><p>“Fuck, fuck.” Harry curled his fingers into Malfoy’s soft hair and tugged, which made Malfoy moan loudly. He held Malfoy’s head in place and thrust hard into his mouth, over and over. Christ. He couldn’t believe Malfoy was taking it; Malfoy kept his mouth open, saliva escaping his lips. Malfoy would take all his come; he would fucking <i>choke</i> on Harry’s come.</p><p>Harry came with a shout. He had no idea he was even close. Malfoy swallowed it all down, his throat clicking. Harry trembled and moaned; he wanted the moment to never end.</p><p>“Oh, you,” Malfoy whispered, licking Harry’s cock clean. He stood and kissed Harry gently.</p><p>“You’re unbelievable.” Harry pulled him closer; he brushed his tongue against Malfoy’s lips, and Malfoy opened for him. He kissed and kissed Malfoy, tasting himself, their tongues brushing hotly.</p><p>“Fuck me,” Malfoy said.</p><p>Harry kissed his pointed chin, his sharp cheekbone. “Do you actually want me? You don’t need to do this to stay here.”</p><p>“Yes.” Malfoy pulled at his jumper, his hands cold on Harry’s stomach. “I want you to fuck me. I want you to hurt me.”</p><p>“I don’t want to hurt you.” Harry tried to move away, but Malfoy grabbed his hand.</p><p>“Only a little.” He pulled Harry to the stairs. “Please.”</p><p>They went up to the lounge, then up to Malfoy’s bedroom. They fell back on the duvet. “Is this what you wanted? To make love to me on a bed?”</p><p>“God,” Harry said, and kissed Malfoy desperately. He knew Malfoy was having a laugh, but he didn’t care. He was already growing hard again, and Malfoy was hard for him. “Get your bloody clothes off.”</p><p>Malfoy huffed a laugh. “Yes, sir.” He unbuttoned his shirt and trousers, then slipped off his pants. He laid back, thighs wide. He turned his face away like he was embarrassed.</p><p>Harry sat back on his heels. Malfoy was gorgeous; breakable. His stomach trembled with breath, his nipples entirely too pink. His cock was long and flushed, but his skin was so pale it was almost blue. He had to stay away from Southwold and sunny days, or else he’d burst into flames.</p><p>The Dark Mark stood out on his arm. Harry stared at it for a moment. Draco tried to slip his arm under the duvet, but Harry stopped him.</p><p>“No, I don’t care.” He kissed the faded skull, over and over. Draco trembled, his eyes wide.</p><p>Harry licked his palm and stroked Malfoy’s twitching cock. “God, you’re so fucking sexy.”</p><p>“I’m old, used up,” Malfoy said. He pulled Harry’s hand away and widened his thighs even further. “I don’t want much prep. Slick me up and force your cock inside.”</p><p>Closing his eyes, Harry took a shuddering breath. He murmured a lube spell and reached down to feel Malfoy’s hole. He pushed a finger inside, and caught his breath. “You’re so tight,” he whined. “I don’t want to hurt you.”</p><p>“I want it,” Malfoy said, twisting on his finger.</p><p>“You’ll bleed.”</p><p>“Get me wet; get me so fucking wet. I promise I can take it.”</p><p>Harry’s head spun. He should slow down; he should ask why Malfoy insisted on being hurt. Was it a kink? Had he internalized decades of hate? Harry didn’t know; he didn’t fucking know. He removed his clothes and Conjured up more lube to slick his cock; he crouched over Malfoy and teased his arse with his wet cockhead.</p><p>“Look at me,” Harry whispered. Malfoy opened his eyes. “Tell me you want this.”</p><p>“I want it.” Malfoy pulled him closer. “I want you.”</p><p>Harry thrust into him slowly. It was work; Malfoy clung to him, almost pushing him out. When he slid all the way in, Harry couldn’t breathe; he couldn’t fucking think. Malfoy was tense beneath him; he was in pain.</p><p>Malfoy thrashed a little; he dug his fingernails into Harry’s shoulders. “Stop being a minge. <i>Fuck me.</i>”</p><p>Moaning, Harry tried thrusting in earnest, but Christ, it was too tight. He rocked into Malfoy, urging his flesh to open to him. Malfoy shuddered and twisted; he gasped loudly as Harry sped up.</p><p>Harry was speaking. He hadn’t a clue what he was saying. “Malfoy, Malfoy. God. God.”</p><p>“Harder,” Malfoy gasped.</p><p>“I can’t. Oh, God, I can’t.”</p><p>Malfoy grabbed his hips and urged him faster. “You fucking pathetic—”</p><p>Harry thrust hard, their flesh smacking together. Malfoy cried out. He’d never made someone sound like that during sex. Malfoy sounded afraid.</p><p>Harry pressed his open mouth to Malfoy’s cheek. “You’re beautiful.”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Malfoy said, arching up. He smoothed his hand along Harry’s bum, then dipped down to finger his arsehole.</p><p>“Christ—” Harry’s thrusts lost rhythm. He was going to come. He was going to come while Malfoy played with his arse.</p><p>“You’re so hard inside me,” Malfoy whispered. “You’re desperate. I want you to fill me up.” Malfoy squeezed a fingertip into his arse, and that did it: Harry came loudly, blindly. He pumped over and over; he finished so hard he was convinced he tore flesh.</p><p>For a while, he just lay against Malfoy, panting into his neck. He was afraid to pull out. He was afraid to see the damage. His cock slipped out on its own; Malfoy flinched. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered.</p><p>Malfoy laughed lowly. “There’s nothing to apologize for.” He rested Harry’s hand on his half-hard cock. “Get me off.”</p><p>Harry gathered some lube from his thighs and stroked him quickly. He kissed Malfoy, nibbling his lips, tasting his teeth. Malfoy arched and whimpered into his mouth. It took some time, but at the cusp of orgasm, he whispered, “Harry,” and came. Harry watched him greedily.</p><p>When Malfoy had calmed down, Harry kissed his wet stomach, his trembling thighs. He probed for any damage and encountered only a little blood. “Are you in a lot of pain?” he murmured.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Do you want me to heal you?”</p><p>Malfoy shook his head. “Just clean me up.”</p><p>Harry hit him with a few cleaning spells and then gathered him up in his arms. He kissed Malfoy’s forehead. “I’m sorry about the job. Can Scorpius do anything?”</p><p>“No.” Malfoy clung to Harry. “Scorpius barely knew the man. Luck just wasn’t on my side.”</p><p>“What does Scorpius do?”</p><p>“He’s a Potions Master. Certified. Studied in Spain. I’m so damn proud of him.”</p><p>“Is that what you wanted to become? If you’d had the choice.”</p><p>Malfoy inhaled. “Yes. He accomplished what I couldn’t, and it’s the greatest achievement of my life.”</p><p>Harry kissed him, and kissed him. He wanted to convey everything he couldn’t with words. Malfoy’s love for his son touched him deeply.</p><p>“Stay with me?” Malfoy whispered.</p><p>“Of course,” Harry said, and pulled the duvet over their shoulders.</p>

</center>Draco meant for it to happen. He did. He could be compulsive, obsessive; desire ate at him like a disease. He’d never been good at saying no.<p>She was young. So, so young. He was old; around her, he felt like he was tiptoeing death. He felt like the oldest person alive until she looked at him. She wanted him. She wanted him from the first moment she saw him. The shop had been warm that day, the potions brewing beneath their feet, the white summer light beating against the windows. Her eyes lingered on him. Somehow they were like Potter’s eyes without being green. They were the same shape but hazel. He had always secretly liked freckles.</p><p>Life was ridiculous. He never would’ve guessed he’d be in Potter’s bed a few months later. He hadn’t even known Potter was into men. This thing with Potter was . . . good. It was thrilling. It made him feel like a human being. He sensed that it meant something to Potter, and perhaps it meant something to him too, but it was never going to last. Sooner or later, Potter would find out what Draco had done, and whatever was going on between them would end; but, for the time being, Draco would enjoy Potter fucking his brains out. He would enjoy Potter making him feel like he mattered. He just needed to avoid Lily at all costs.</p>

</center>The next day, Harry visited Ron and Hermione. He’d spent the morning in bed with Malfoy, and it’d been difficult to say goodbye to him, but he wanted to speak to his mates as soon as possible. He wanted the anxious tightening in his stomach to just disappear.<p>When he stepped from their Floo, the lounge was empty and quiet. He called out to them, but didn’t receive a reply. Even the cat seemed to be out.</p><p>He went to the window. They were in their garden, enjoying the sunny day. Hermione wore a large sunhat and Ron had on his mid-life crisis sunglasses.</p><p>“Knock, knock,” Harry said from their back door.</p><p>“Oh, Harry!” Hermione jumped from her chair. She gave him a big hug. “I’m sorry I haven’t owled. I’ve been terribly busy.”</p><p>“I’m sure,” Harry said, smiling. He waved to Ron. “Hanging in there, Old Man?”</p><p>“Just barely.” Ron came over and motioned for Harry to sit down. “I’ll get us some beers.”</p><p>Hermione sat down, too. She looked closely at Harry’s face. “There’s something different about you.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “You mean I look happy.”</p><p>“Yeah,” she said.</p><p>“I am.” Harry smiled widely. He couldn’t help it. He <i>was</i> happy.</p><p>Hermione frowned; her eyes searched his face. “You’re with somebody,” she concluded. He nodded, not dropping his smile. “But who could it be?”</p><p>“You know him.”</p><p>Ron emerged from the house holding three beers. “Who do we know?”</p><p>“The bloke I’m seeing,” Harry said, trying not to be awkward. Sometimes it was hard for him to talk about these things with Ron.</p><p>“You’re seeing someone and haven’t told me?”</p><p>Harry sipped his beer. “It’s recent. Very, very recent.”</p><p>Hermione was still scrutinizing him. Her eyes widened. “No, it couldn’t be. It’s not . . . <i>Malfoy</i>?”</p><p>Ron choked on his beer. “What did you say?”</p><p>“It’s true.” Harry refused to be ashamed or embarrassed. “I’m seeing Malfoy.”</p><p>“<i>Draco</i> Malfoy?”</p><p>“Who else?” Harry laughed.</p><p>“But . . . but you hate him!” Ron said, sounding very much like his younger self.</p><p>“Water under the bridge,” Harry said.</p><p>Ron gaped. “He was a Death Eater!”</p><p>“Yes, but that was over twenty years ago. Isn’t it time we forgave him?” Harry didn’t like how this conversation was turning out.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Ron gulped from his beer, clearly shaken. “I guess we can forgive him if you can.”</p><p>“What about that nasty business with Mr Blackwood? Has he recovered from his injuries?” Hermione said.</p><p>“Still ongoing.” Harry took a deep breath. “It’s one of the reasons why I came over to talk to you.”</p><p>“Is there a mystery to be solved?” Ron looked very excited.</p><p>“No,” Harry said, smiling again. “I want to do something to help people like Malfoy. I want to end the Ministry’s discrimination of former Death Eaters.”</p><p>“You want to bring a lawsuit,” Hermione said.</p><p>Harry frowned. “Yeah, I guess I do.”</p><p>She was silent for a moment. “I think that’s fantastic.”</p><p>“You do?” Harry asked, surprised. Ron looked surprised too.</p><p>“Of course! The Ministry is ridiculous. There’s a reason why they employed people like Umbridge and Fudge. They still support the discrimination of many magical creatures.”</p><p>“Oh, Hermione,” Ron said, rubbing his face. “Do we really have to do this again?”</p><p>“It’s been years since we’ve done anything!”</p><p>Ron shook his head. “Did both of you forget how we battled bloody Death Eaters? How they killed Fred and Lupin and Tonks?”</p><p>“There’s <i>countless</i> laws that target them; even some of their children are disenfranchised,” Harry said.</p><p>Ron hesitated. “It’s not their fault their parents decided to be arseholes.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Harry said. “Something needs to change.”</p><p>“I know someone who could possibly help us,” Hermione said. “I’ve talked to her about my frustrations and I know she feels the same way about all this.”</p><p>“You want to ask <i>Lavender</i>?” Ron said.</p><p>Harry was confused. “Lavender? Like Lavender Brown?”</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione said. “She’s a solicitor now. A very good one.”</p><p>Ron covered his face. “We really are going to involve Lavender.”</p><p>“Oh, get over yourself. Nobody except you still cares that you two dated.” Hermione stared past them into the garden, thinking. “I could owl her. Let her know our intentions.”</p><p>“No, we shouldn’t write anything down,” Harry said, remembering Kingsley’s caution. “We need to be careful.”</p><p>“Merlin,” Ron muttered.</p><p>“Good thinking.” She Summoned parchment and quill. “I’ll just ask her to schedule a Floo call with me. Maybe even lunch.”</p><p>“Are you going to mention my name?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Of course,” Hermione said, writing. “Unless you don’t want me to.”</p><p>Harry thought about it. “If I’m involved, I will be the face of this lawsuit. Is that wise?”</p><p>“I’ll see what Lavender thinks.” Hermione called their owl Vicky (named affectionately after Krum) to her. Hermione sealed up the letter and tied it to her leg. They watched as Vicky disappeared into the hazy afternoon sky.</p><p>“I learned about Magnolia,” Harry said, and then added, “By the way.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “James told me not to tell you or Ginny.”</p><p>“What do you think about her?”</p><p>“Oh, she’s lovely,” Hermione said. “A really clever girl.”</p><p>“That’s good,” Harry said.</p><p>Ron nodded. “I met her. She seems nice.”</p><p>“What does she do at St Mungo’s?”</p><p>“She originally worked for me, but she was transferred to our recruitment division. We’re short staffed and not many are applying.”</p><p>Frowning, Harry said, “People don’t want to be healers? That’s mad.”</p><p>“It’s not the healers we need. Mediwitches and wizards. Assistant Potioneers. Caretakers.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said, already thinking about Malfoy. He decided to visit St Mungo’s after he said goodbye to them. “Have you had your lunch? I’m starving.”</p><p>“No, let’s eat.” Hermione stood.</p><p>“We’ve got leftover chicken and rolls,” Ron said, brightening. “I could whip us up something.”</p><p>“Brilliant,” Harry said, following them back indoors.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>After lunch, Harry Apparated to St Mungo’s. The place was busy; he kept his head down in the lobby and lift. By chance he stumbled on the recruitment office on the fourth level. He knocked and the door clicked open.<p>“Hello,” said a woman behind the desk. “Do you have an appointment?”</p><p>“No,” he said from the doorway. “I’m here to see Magnolia.” He realized he didn’t know her last name.</p><p>She looked him up and down; then a strange expression came over her face. “You’re Harry Potter.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>She stood and came around her desk. “I’m Magnolia.”</p><p>He shook her hand. “It’s very nice to meet you finally.”</p><p>“I agree,” she said, a little pained. “Please have a seat.” She closed the door.</p><p>He sat. “I was delighted when I found out you worked at St Mungo’s.”</p><p>“Oh?” She perched at the edge of her chair. She was petite and blonde; her eyes reminded him of Luna’s. “Does James know you’re here?”</p><p>“I’m afraid not,” Harry said. “I don’t mean to put you in a weird spot.”</p><p>“No, it’s fine.” She smiled at him, but her eyes were worried.</p><p>“I’m intruding. I was so excited to meet you that I didn’t even think about it.”</p><p>“No, no, I’m glad we’re meeting.”</p><p>“Thank you for being so gracious. I hear you’re holding a benefit?”</p><p>She brightened. “Yes, I am! I was thrilled when James told me you had agreed to attend.”</p><p>“Good, good. I must admit that I came here for another reason.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Yes, I have a friend who needs a job.”</p><p>“Do they have any qualifications? Any skills?”</p><p>“They have a lot of experience brewing potions.”</p><p>“Do they have a criminal record?”</p><p>“Yes.” He steeled himself and added, “He is also a former Death Eater.”</p><p>She flinched. “It would be illegal to employ him.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry said. “I read that he could gain employment if he received a license. Do you know anything about that?”</p><p>“No, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“So, St Mungo’s has never employed someone with Death Eater ties?”</p><p>“Not to my knowledge.”</p><p>He sighed. “There’s nothing you could do? Nothing <i>I</i> could do?”</p><p>She looked at him sharply. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Hating himself a little, he charged on. “I have money and a good reputation; I could bring a lot of potential donors to your benefit.”</p><p>“You would do that if I gave your friend a job?”</p><p>“Yes.” He gazed at her steadily.</p><p>She sat back in her chair and twirled her hair. “There could be a loophole.”</p><p>“Tell me more.”</p><p>“We could hire him on as an intern. He just wouldn’t have certain professional privileges like access to our medical supplies.”</p><p>“How do you know this will work?”</p><p>She sighed. “I don’t, but it’s worth a try. You understand we wouldn’t be able to give him a full salary. We could come close, but not full.”</p><p>“This all sounds very promising. I’ll propose it to my friend and then get back to you.” He smiled again. “Did you meet James at Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Oh, no.” Magnolia flushed a little. “I mean, I was in the year above and we knew of each other, but I’d never dream of approaching James Potter.”</p><p>“Even though you were a year above?”</p><p>“Yes. Most students were awed. Most people are awed.”</p><p>“And what do you think now?”</p><p>She laughed. “I think I shouldn’t have been such a coward.”</p><p>“So, you two are getting on?”</p><p>“I think so,” she said a little stiffly.</p><p>“Sorry. That was rude of me to ask. It’s none of my business.” He stood. “Is there anything you need from me right now?”</p><p>She hesitated, and for a horrible moment, he thought she’d ask for an autograph. “If I get your friend this job, you promise to do all that you said?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Will you give a speech?”</p><p>He grimaced. “If you can get my friend a position working with potions—I heard you need assistant potioneers—then yes, I will give a speech.”</p><p>“Great.” She stood and shook his hand. “It was lovely to meet you. I go by Lia, by the way.”</p><p>“Lia,” he repeated, and then remembered Lily referencing a friend named Lia. “Are you mates with my daughter, Lily?”</p><p>Magnolia blinked. “Yes, I am.”</p><p>“Have you spoken to her recently? If you talk to her soon, tell her to come see me.”</p><p>Her pained expression was back. “I’ll relay the message if I get a chance.”</p>

</center>After he left the Ministry, he raced home to tell Malfoy about the potential job. He was in the foyer when it occurred to him that Malfoy might consider it a handout. He heard banging in the kitchen and descended the stairs.<p>“Cooking for me again?” he said.</p><p>Malfoy smirked at him. “It’s just another stew. It won’t be done for a while.” They sat down at the table and Malfoy Summoned them some Butterbeers. “How was your day?”</p><p>Harry couldn’t take how <i>domestic</i> Malfoy was being. It thrilled him.</p><p>“It was brilliant. Fantastic. I spoke to Ron and Hermione; then went over to St Mungo’s to finally meet the woman my son is dating.”</p><p>“Which son?”</p><p>“Jamie.” Harry drummed his fingers; he didn’t know what to tell Malfoy about the lawsuit and his meeting with Magnolia. He didn’t want to get Malfoy’s hopes up. “I might’ve nabbed you a job.”</p><p>Malfoy stared. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Jamie’s girlfriend Magnolia. She said that she probably has a job for you.”</p><p>“At St Mungo’s? Impossible. I need a license to work there, and the Ministry never gives out those licenses.”</p><p>“Never?”</p><p>“Never.” Malfoy took a shuddering breath. “Thanks for trying to help.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “She said they could hire you as an intern. You wouldn’t make a full salary, but you’d make something close to it.”</p><p>“Is this really going to happen?” Malfoy looked stunned.</p><p>“Yes, I think so. I promised to make a speech at her little benefit, and she seemed hesitant but optimistic about this job for you.”</p><p>“You made promises to her? For me?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry said, uncomfortable. “I know you don’t like handouts, but I saw the opportunity and took it.”</p><p>“You were thinking about me. You were talking to your son’s girlfriend and you thought about me.”</p><p>“I’m always thinking about you.”</p><p>“Potter,” Malfoy whispered. He framed Harry’s face and kissed him. Harry moaned and wrapped his arms around him, deepening the kiss. “Let me make you feel good.”</p><p>“God.”</p><p>Malfoy threw a charm at the stew, then took Harry up to his bedroom. He pushed Harry on the bed and crawled on top of him. “Please. I want to make you feel good. I want to make you feel so good.”</p><p>“You already are.” Harry smoothed his hands up and down his strong thighs. Malfoy kissed him deeply; he tasted like tea and herbs. Harry groaned and arched against him.</p><p>Malfoy undressed him slowly. He mouthed along his shoulders, lapped at his nipples. He dipped his tongue in the hair on his chest, then followed it down to his navel. Harry laughed and tried to twist away. Malfoy unbuttoned his trousers with his teeth.</p><p>“God,” Harry said, trying not to flail. Malfoy pushed down his trousers and mouthed him through his pants. Harry was already fully hard.</p><p>“I want you to come in my arse,” Malfoy said, sitting up. He did away with the rest of their clothes, then straddled Harry’s hips again. He stroked Harry, his fingers squeezing, his palm weighing. “Of course your cock is big.”</p><p>Harry laughed breathlessly. “You’re exaggerating.”</p><p>“Perhaps,” Malfoy said, grinning down at him. Harry tried to reach for him but Malfoy evaded his hands. “No, I want you to just lie there. I don’t want you to do any work.”</p><p>“You’re ruining me.”</p><p>Malfoy’s grin widened. He muttered a lube spell. He slicked Harry up and pressed two fingers into his own arse. His eyes fluttered closed, his mouth falling into a concentrated frown. “I can’t wait until you’re inside me.”</p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry said.</p><p>“Shh. I can’t wait until you’re splitting me open.” Malfoy positioned Harry’s cock, then slowly worked it inside him. Harry closed his eyes. Christ, it felt so good.</p><p>When Harry was all the way in, Malfoy, trembling, muttering, rocked on his cock. “Look at me.”</p><p>Harry opened his eyes; he felt trapped; he felt like he would never escape.</p><p>“You pity me,” Malfoy whispered. “I know you do.”</p><p>“No, no,” Harry said, barely able to focus.</p><p>“You do, but that’s okay.” Malfoy rose, then went back down; his chest was flushed pink. He stroked himself.  “I’m going to cover you in my come.”</p><p>Harry twisted his hands in the sheets. “Malfoy.”</p><p>“You think I’m pathetic.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Harry hit a pleasurable spot and Malfoy threw his head back.</p><p>“You feel so good.” Malfoy fell forward to rest his hands on either side of Harry. He sped up his movement; Harry’s eyes rolled up.</p><p>“Fuck, I’m going to come,” Harry whimpered. He thrust without thinking about it, nearly unseating Malfoy.</p><p>“Do it,” Malfoy said, squeezing around his cock. Harry came hard, his whole body going numb with it. Malfoy moaned loudly; he stroked himself quickly, trying to catch up. Harry felt semen hit his stomach, his chest, and knew Malfoy was coming too.</p><p>Harry pulled out gently and rolled them over. He kissed Malfoy deeply, pressing their bodies together, wet come smearing between them. Malfoy clutched at him like he needed an anchor.</p><p>“I don’t think you’re pathetic,” Harry said. “I respect you.”</p><p>“I know.” Malfoy pressed his forehead to Harry’s neck. “Merlin, I’m exhausted.”</p><p>“Sleep now. You’re safe with me.”</p><p>Malfoy sighed. “Thank you.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>In the morning, Harry woke up alone in bed. He stretched and yawned; he felt so damn relaxed. He took his time showering and shaving; when he finally came down to the lounge, he heard raised voices in the kitchen.<p>Frowning, he went downstairs and stopped abruptly. Lily was pointing in Malfoy’s face and yelling at him. Malfoy jerked when he spotted Harry.</p><p>“Lily?” Harry asked.</p><p>Her cheeks were red, her eyes wide and tearful. “Dad,” she sobbed.</p><p>He came toward her. “What’s happened? What’s wrong?”</p><p>She swerved to Malfoy. “Tell him!”</p><p>Malfoy gulped. He looked scared; he looked cornered. “Please calm down. I will, but you need to calm down.”</p><p>“You make me sick.” She grabbed a glass of milk on the counter and threw it in his face.</p><p>“Lily! What the hell?” Harry said. </p><p>“Dad, I need to speak to you alone.”</p><p>“Okay,” Harry said, going numb. Malfoy’s face dripped with milk, but he did nothing to wipe it away. “We can talk upstairs.”</p><p>When they made it to the lounge, Lily collapsed in his arms, crying. “Oh, Dad.”</p><p>He kissed her temple. “Whatever it is, I’m here for you.”</p><p>“You’re sleeping with him, aren’t you?” she whispered.</p><p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>“Draco. You’re sleeping with him.”</p><p>Harry felt the blood drain from his face. <i>Draco.</i> He didn’t even call Malfoy by his first name. “Yes, I am.”</p><p>“Oh, Dad.” She clutched at him. “I can’t say it. You need to stay away from him. You must tell him to leave.”</p><p>“But why? What do you know?” Harry barely felt himself speak.</p><p>“I can’t. You must ask him.” She tore away from him and went to the Floo. She covered her face, her shoulders shaking. She muttered her destination and disappeared amid the flames.</p><p>“You should sit down,” Malfoy said from the doorway.</p><p>“What the hell is going on?”</p><p>Malfoy shook his head. “Please sit, then I’ll tell you.”</p><p>Harry dropped into a chair. He looked at Malfoy expectantly.</p><p>Malfoy breathed a deep, trembling breath. He came closer, but not by much. “We worked together in Blackwood’s shop.”</p><p>“Okay,” Harry said, mind whirling.</p><p>“We worked very closely together. We spent a lot of time together alone in the cellar.” Malfoy stared at the wall past Harry’s head. “We were romantically involved.”</p><p>Harry stood. “What the hell does that mean?” His heart pounded painfully.</p><p>“It means that we slept together.”</p><p>Harry’s knees weakened. He fell back, aiming for the chair, but he landed on the floor.</p><p>“Let me help you up,” Malfoy said, stepping forward.</p><p>“No, no.” Harry cradled his head. He couldn’t think. He couldn’t breathe. “You need to leave.”</p><p>“Yes, of course.” Malfoy went up to his room. A few minutes later, he came back down with his trunks. “I apologize if I leave anything behind.”</p><p>Harry laughed. He was still on the floor. “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me.”</p><p>“I know,” Malfoy said, strained. Harry couldn’t look at him. He went to the Floo, his trunks banging together in the air. “Harry.”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Harry said, covering his face with an arm.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Malfoy stuttered a destination, then disappeared.</p><p>Harry laid back on the floor. It took him a long time to realize he was crying.</p>
