    <p>Draco wasn’t scared. He really wasn’t. he just wanted to be alone. No, not alone, but away from here. So, he ran, as fast as he could into the forest behind the manner. He ran until his legs gave out under him. Sinking to his knees, he let out as gasp and called for the only person who he knew could help his pain, but he was also painfully aware would never be able to help him.</p><p>Night was falling then, but Draco didn’t care. He simply leaned back against the closest tree and hugged his knees to his chest. Closing his eyes he hoped sleep or death would find him quickly.</p><p>Draco was woken from his sleep by the distinct crack off apparation. Before he could raise his wand he was brought into a tight hug.</p><p>“It’s alright,” Harry said, threading his fingers into Draco’s hair, the other hand on his back pulling him ever closer. “I’m here now.”</p><p>Draco shuddered with relief, but removed the strong arms from around his body. “You can’t be here. I don’t think I made it out of the grounds.”</p><p>Harry’s face contorted in confusion. “You called for me.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t have. Now they know where you are. No one is supposed to be able to ap-,” now it was Draco’s turn to look confused. “How did you get here.”</p><p>“Apparation.”</p><p>“But the wards?”</p><p>Harry cast his gaze upwards. Draco followed his gaze and caught a glimpse of the wards burning up through the leaves.</p><p>“Now they surely know where you are,” Draco scolded.</p><p>“They know that I am somewhere on your grounds, but not exactly where,” Harry held out his arms. “We have time.”</p><p>Draco bit his lip, but gave in and curled up in Harry’s strong embrace.</p><p>Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head gently. “Tell me what made you call.”</p><p>Despite all of the courage Draco new he possessed, he began to shake. “I…I didn’t want them to,” Draco took a deep breath. “But they have my family. They are in my <em>house</em>.”</p><p>Harry simply held Draco closer. “I will never judge you, Draco.”</p><p>Ever so slowly Draco pulled up his sleeve to show the Dark Mark on his left forearm. The black mark stood out against Draco’s fair skin as if the skin itself was trying to repel it.</p><p>“It’s ugly, and repulsive. I didn’t want it. I don’t want to be a part of <em>them</em>,” Draco spit the last word out like it burned his mouth to even say it.</p><p>“I know you don’t,” Harry covered the mark with his hand gently.</p><p>That’s when they heard footsteps in the distance.</p><p>“You said we had time,” Draco said, beginning to panic. “You can’t be caught! Not here!”</p><p>“We will be alright,” Harry said, helping Draco rise to his feet.</p><p>“Over there!” called a voice from somewhere close by.</p><p>Suddenly flames erupted from the ground, drawing a circle around Harry and Draco.</p><p>Draco looked at the flames that were stretching towards the canopy above. “Subtle, Potter,” Draco said, but pressed himself ever closer to Harry’s chest.</p><p>“I learn from the best,” Harry’s arms tightened around the blonde and he apparated them away.</p>
