    <p>He woke up in a cold sweat, grasping at the sheets wrapped around his body, gasping and trying to get free, “Let me out, let me out,” He gasped, finally rolling free. Sirius clutched at his chest, feeling for chords, ropes that tied him down and tried to strangle him, but found none. He collapsed against the floor, feebly struggling against the sheets, trying to catch his breath.</p><p>Remus heard a loud thump from across the room accompanied by a series of hushed “shit’s.” He’d been up half the night reading, thinking the other boys were fast asleep. He peaked out around the curtains and saw a rumpled Sirius struggling to disentangle himself from his sheets. Sliding out of his own bed, he crept over to beside his friend and gently unwrapped the other boy’s legs. “There you go, Padfoot.” He smiled until he looked over Sirius’ face. His eyes were wide, hair matted with sweat and it looked like he’d been crying. “You okay there, mate?” Remus asked, laying a small hand on his friend’s shoulder. Sirius shook his head, breaths now catching in hiccoughs. Remus hesitated for a moment before opening his arms to offer his friend support. He watch Sirius hesitate before accepting their warmth. When Remus had the larger boy settled against him, he asked, “Do you want to talk about it, Si?” Sirius buried his head in Remus’ neck and shook his head. “That’s okay. Do you want to get back in bed?” Sirius shook his head again. “Okay…do you want to get in bed with me?” Sirius tensed for a moment before relaxing, slowly nodding. Remus took his hand and lead him to his bed, climbing in, and holding back the sheets for his friend. They settled in together back to back, each drawing comfort from the other, they weren’t alone. </p><p>Sirius felt Remus’ breaths slow against his back and tried to time his breaths to these, praying for sleep to catch, and for nightmares to stay away. </p><p>~*~*~*~</p><p>Morning broke with Peter stumbling from his bed saying, “Bloody hell, what happened to Padfoot’s bed?” his voice cracked halfway through, which lead to gentle teasing from James, whose voice had already broke. Sirius rolled over, shocked that the presence of Remus beside him held the nightmares at bay. He looked to his right, expecting to see the smaller boy, but was met with empty sheets. He slid out from the curtains to a bewildered look from Peter and more chuckles from James.</p><p>“What were you doing in there, Pads? Looking to catch Moony without his shirt on?” He winked, and made his way to the bathroom. Sirius felt a blush creeping fiercely up his face, and turned toward his trunk. </p><p>“I’ll have you know, Prongsy, that Moony was just offering me a bed that didn’t smell like your dirty Quidditch socks. Merlin knows why my bed does, but I was grateful for his chivalry last night. Saving me from asphyxiation from Prongs stench.” James spluttered, acting greatly offended, and chucked his night shirt at Sirius. Following this speech, Sirius saw Moony emerge rather rapidly from the bathroom, hurrying to his trunk, and crawling back into bed, making sure the curtains were shut.</p><p> </p><p>At the end of last school year he’d asked Lily, sweet, kind, muggle-born Lily, if maybe he could borrow one of her muggle romance books. She’d been perplexed at first, but then a slight glimmer of understanding passed across her face and she’d nodded, smiling warmly at him when she’d brought it down later that night. </p><p>Sirius had only meant to read the first couple chapters, when he would easily be able to hide it from his parents, and even Regulus, but he’d lost track of time, and Kreacher had cracked into his room while he was still reading, scolding Sirius for being late for dinner. A wretched smirk had crossed the house elf’s face when he saw what Sirius was doing, had seized his arm, and Apparated directly to the dinner table, where Kreacher had said, “Kreacher wishes to report to his Mistress that her eldest son,” his voice had caressed the word, stressing it with a pointed look at Sirius’ downcast face, “is disgracing Mistress’ most Noble house, and defiling her prospects for the future.” He bowed and backed into the kitchen, leaving a trembling Sirius beneath his mother’s cold, hard gaze. </p><p>Walburga had raised herself to her fullest height, and struck Sirius across the face. She had given a meaningful look to her husband, who approached Sirius and dragged him back to his room. There, Sirius had dealt with blow after blow to what eventually felt like his whole body as Orion reminded his that he was, “The heir to the most Noble and Ancient house of Black, and you shall act like the son you are. There will be none of this muggle nonsense, none of this faggot-ry.” Sirius had woken the next morning short of breath, crumpled in his bed, and hadn’t been able to move for several days. He thought that this must be akin to how Remus felt after the full moon. By the time someone bothered to check on him, his bruises had faded from a purple-black and a soft yellow. The next punishment, this time when Sirius had questioned Narcissa “too covetously” about her new dress robes, came in the form of a muscle contracting curse, held on him by his mother as she yelled at him words he couldn’t hear over the roar of pain that filled his body as his muscles contracted hard enough to almost break several bones. </p><p>Sirius had managed to make it back to school with only three more beatings and curses each, but was left with night terrors that sometimes crept into the day. Of ropes that snaked up his legs to pull him into darkness or to wrap around his neck, his mother’s sharp voice, or his father’s rough hands. He was left with a distinct feeling that something big, something important was missing. He found himself flinching when James told him it was time to get a girlfriend or when Peter left their study groups to find Mary for some “alone time.” He just didn’t know why everyone was so taken with girls these days…he was much more interested in the Marauders. It didn’t quite feel the same… </p><p>James was so filled with confidence for Quidditch, for pranks, for just being himself, and was so infatuated with the fiery and smart Lily Evans. Peter was very, very into Mary MacDonald and what it meant to have a girlfriend, and was hard-pressed to talk about her (around the Marauders) without mentioning how it made him feel like more of a man, even though they were all only fourteen. Remus was quieter sometimes, liked reading, was the books behind their operation, knew everything and was a port in a storm. And Sirius was…Sirius was cold wind whipping wet hair, he was starless nights, and uncertainty. Sirius didn’t know who he was or what he wanted to be. He just knew that he didn’t ever look at girls the way James or Peter did, didn’t look at boys the way he had seen Remus doing…and he didn’t know what that meant. What he was sure it meant was that no one would take the time to want him in any capacity.</p><p>He was shaken from his thoughts when Moony emerged from his bed, and Peter clapped him on the back on his way to breakfast. He hurriedly buttoned up his shirt and grabbed his tie when he noticed Remus holding James back by his collar, waiting for Sirius to catch up. James turned and saluted Sirius when he joined the pair and Remus hooked his arm through his own, spurring them toward the Great Hall so he could have tea before it became cold. He smiled, and thought that he could try to be content for just a while more. He could bask in the warmth of their friendships for just a little while more. </p><p>~*~*~*~</p><p>Remus woke with Sirius flush against his side, and immediately felt his heartbeat quicken. He was too close, and Remus had to get away, slowly and quietly. He inched away from the other boy, eventually making it to the side of the bed. He grabbed his towel and shower kit, and rushed to the bathroom. He slowly took off his night clothes, carefully folding them and and laying them beside a shower. He stepped into the shower, decidedly not looking down today. Today had already started off iffy, and he did not need to remind himself of just how wrong he was. Too thin, too pale, too bony, the only blessing there being that this kept the horrifying curves away. Too many scars from too many transformations. Too-wide hips, and a not-flat-enough-anymore chest. He closed his eyes and let the warm water cascade down his body. Breathe in for four counts, hold for seven, and release for eight, repeat. The world started to settle and he started to truly wake. Rushing through his shower routine, he had just started stepping back into his clothes when he heard James asking Sirius if he had been in Remus’ bed to try to see him without a shirt and blushed madly. The thought was ludicrous. Not only would Sirius not be trying to see him without a shirt, Remus would never let him…never be able to let him. </p><p>He rushed back to his trunk, grabbing his robes and slipping back into his bed. The room settled, and Remus began his day. Check to make sure the curtains are closed, pulled his binder out from his robes, discarded his night shirt and struggled to pull it on over his still-damp skin. Feeling slightly more in place, he continued dressing, listening to the other boys getting ready. </p><p>Remus rushed Sirius to breakfast behind James, and far behind Peter, hoping to get tea before the water was cold. His legs were slightly shorter now, but he kept up well. He’d begged his parents to help him look into potions that would make him develop like his friends, but they were more concerned with finding a potion that would help him keep his lycanthropy under control. Research was turning up about a wolfsbane potion that was supposed to help werewolves keep their minds during full moons, but no one had succeeded in brewing it yet. </p><p>They sat down at the end of the Gryffindor table, and proceeded to quickly dig into breakfast, like teenage boys are known to do. Sirius whispered, around a mouthful of eggs, “Hey Moony, I just wanted to say thanks for last night…I really appreciate it, Rem.” Remus smiled at him and nodded his head, nudging his friend in acknowledgement. Remus was feeling rather good today, in his bones. His last transformation had been relatively mild, he was sure the wolf was aware that the rest of the Marauders were making breakthroughs in their Animagi research even though Remus was not entirely approving. And they were talking about it again, James saying, “Men,” Remus felt Sirius tense, though he was not sure why, “I believe that tonight would be a good night to go exploring, if you know what I mean.” They did, in fact. James wanted to sneak into the Restricted Section tonight to see if there were any more books that detailed the process of becoming Animagi. They had already read about Mandrake leaves, and had completed that step of the process, but were unsure how to get to the actual transforming part. Remus swelled with happiness, but was held grounded by the pit in his stomach that told him if anything went wrong it would be his fault. </p><p>~*~*~*~<br/>
Months passed, and Remus was there for Sirius after each nightmare, bringing him to his bed and pressing their backs together. Each morning he would slip out before Sirius woke and wait for the other boy to leave before he dressed. They were nearing the Christmas holidays when he dropped into a conversation between James and Sirius. He was returning from a late Arithmancy lesson, and wearily plopped into the armchair beside James, kicking his feet onto the table. Sirius, who was draped across the opposite couch, had not noticed his arrival, and was saying, “…can’t to go back there, Prongs. It’s so dull and…I just, I don’t belong, and they don’t like me, and…” He trailed off, taking a deep breath that hitched on its release, “James,” Remus’ eyebrows rose, this was serious then, he never used James’ name anymore, “James I’m scared to go back.” James met Remus’ confused expression, his own grim. </p><p>“Ask your parents if you can come to mine for the holiday,” James offered, “They’d love to have you.” Sirius was shaking his head, and began to sit up. He looked at James with red rimmed eyes, and a very pale face. “You feeling alright, Pads?” James asked, moving to get up from the chair. But Sirius had already turned to see Remus sitting to his left. His face went impossibly paler. </p><p>“Oh, Moony,” He said, “Didn’t know you were there Mate,” He tried to fix his signature smile in place, but it wavered and fell quickly. Remus knew his expression had just turned harsh. He didn’t want to be harsh, but this always seemed to happen: whenever anything serious about any of the other Marauder’s lives came up, they would shy away from it if Remus was around, and he was tired of it. If they were like this when they only knew about his lycanthropy, what would they be like if they found out about the…other thing? He was already almost an outcast, and they would leave him altogether if they found that out. </p><p>“What’s going on, Sirius?” Remus asked, and Sirius’ face fell completely. He looked distraught, and Remus wanted to say never mind, everything was okay, Sirius didn’t have to tell him anything, but it wouldn’t be true. “What’s going on at home? Why don’t you want to go back? Why do you have nightmares almost every night that make you fall out of your bed and come crawling into mine? Why do you all shut up whenever anything more serious than a hangnail or a missed assignment comes up if you’re anywhere near me? Why?” That was more than Remus meant to say, but it was everything that was on his mind. His voice had been rising the closer he got to the end of his questions. </p><p>“Rem, it’s nothing,” James tried to soothe his friend.</p><p>“Merlin’s saggy right buttock it’s nothing!” Remus shouted, standing and grabbing his satchel. “Whatever, boys,” Sirius wilted more, “I’m going to see if Pete wants to play a few games of exploding snap. Don’t join us unless you plan on answering my questions.” Remus stalked away from his friends, up to their dormitory where Peter was lounging on his bed eating chocolates and reading one of James’ Quidditch magazines. He tossed a chocolate to Remus without looking, and Remus caught it in his mouth. Peter was very good at making sure chocolate was not wasted and that all the Marauders had enough when they needed it. “Fancy some exploding snap?” He offered, and they settled in. They ended up tying, and agreed they would trade chocolate at the start of term. Remus was settled into bed before either James or Sirius made an appearance in the dormitory for the night. </p><p>~*~*~*~</p><p>Sirius sagged against the back of the couch, rubbing his hands over his face. He heard James sigh. “Pads, maybe you should just tell Re and Pete…they won’t judge you because your parents are crazy. It might help, and it will definitely make Remus not angry with you.” Sirius nodded. </p><p>“I know, I just thought, maybe if I could go one holiday without seeing my family everything would be better. I wouldn’t feel so wrong or empty or broken. I don’t know. I wish Moony wasn’t mad…but he has been really helpful, and I should apologize.” James smiled at him, then said he was taking the cloak and seeing if the prototype Map worked tonight, and did Sirius want to come. Sirius shook his head, just staring into the fire. James came over, felt his forehead, and then dropped a chaste kiss onto his hair. Sirius smiled a little. </p><p>He heard soft giggling from the far corner behind him and turned. There sat Lily, Marlene and Alice, trading books and magazines and painting each others'  toes. Sirius gathered his strength and walked over to them. Lily looked up with an eyebrow raised, skepticism written all over her face. Marlene paused in her toenail painting to evaluate Sirius. Alice let out another soft giggle, and Sirius realized that he’d been standing in front of the group for at least a full minute. He blushed and finally got the nerve to speak, “May I join you?” He asked, voice small and quiet. The three girls looked at each other in confusion, and Sirius felt his blush intensify, “I mean…If you don’t mind, I just, I was wondering,” He pulled at the end of his hair, just past his shoulders now, “I thought it would be nice, if maybe you could teach me how to…” He gestured to the french plait Alice sported. The confusion turned to shock, but the girls decided that Sirius must be, well, serious, if he was blushing so fiercely and looked as if he was about to jump out of his skin. </p><p>“Shove over, Lils,” Alice said, making room for Sirius beside her. “Come on, love.” She patted the seat, and Sirius sat. He thought he might cry, either with nervousness or with relief. Alice toyed with a strand of his hair and asked, “May I?” Sirius nodded, hardly believing himself. </p><p>He looked up and caught Lily’s eye. “So, Black,” She said, and he suppressed a wince. “What brings you to this side of the Common Room?” He looked to Marlene, and Alice twisted his head back to Lily, tutting as she ran her fingers to untangle his hair again. </p><p>“I, um, I…I made Remus really mad, and you guys looked like you were having fun, and James was just making me upset, and I wanted to maybe have you teach me how to braid hair and maybe…I don’t know,” He made his voice quieter, “I kind of wanted to paint your nails maybe, because I can’t do mine, but I really like the way it looks, and I don’t know.” He stopped talking, face flushed, voice cracking and stuttering, and looking completely miserable. Lily felt very confused, and very guilty, and very strangely fond. </p><p>“How’d you make Remus angry?” Marlene asked, obviously not looking at Sirius to see he face, entirely absorbed in the nail varnish being applied to Lily’s toenails. </p><p>Sirius swallowed, and said, “I’ve been, um, having…nightmares, and he wakes me up and makes sure I’m okay…but I was, I…” he trailed off and raised he eyes to the ceiling, careful not to move his head, “I was telling James earlier that I don’t want to go home for Christmas, and could I go to his, and Remus heard and got really angry. I didn’t want to burden him, because he’s…ill quite frequently…and he has enough on his plate, he doesn’t need to know about me liking nail varnish and romance novels, or being afraid of my parents, or never being able to sleep unless I can feel him breathing behind me, and now I’ve told you all more than I’ve told any of my friends and I feel like a stewed slug.” He realized he’d been rambling and paled, flush held only in the apples of his cheeks, making him look slightly manic. </p><p>Alice’s hands had stilled, Lily was watching him intently, and Marlene was dripping nail varnish onto the rug beneath her. Sirius blanched, and started to stand before he felt Alice’s small, strong hands forcing him back down. “Sirius, did you just tell us that you liked romance novels and nail varnish?” Marlene asked. His hands started to shake. He looked down and muttered, </p><p>“Yes, I suppose. I do. I know it’s stupid and it’s wrong, and I’m sick and broken and disgusting. I know, I just thought, that if I pretended it was all fun…If I pretended maybe I was just doing it to make my parents angry, maybe I’d start to notice girls more, and like them like James or Peter do, maybe I’d be normal…Maybe I should just go, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all of this,” He was met with Marlene’s gaze of steel, Alice’s firm grip on his shoulders, and Lily’s voice saying, </p><p>“No Sirius, stay. I think…I’ve read about this. Hang on.” She furrowed her eyebrows, licked the tip of her forefinger, and looked as if she were turning pages in the empty air. “Sirius, do you want to be with a girl?” She asked, and Sirius shook his head, “But you don’t want to be with a boy either?” Another shake. “Ever or just now?” Sirius quirked an eyebrow and cocked his head. “Like…maybe you’d want to at some point? Like be friends and then maybe you’d be attracted to them. I don’t know, it’s just a thought. Maybe someday you would want to be with someone you were close to, although it’s okay if you never want to be with anyone.” Sirius couldn’t move…could he not be broken? </p><p>“Okay next question, why are you afraid of your parents? Is it because of this…or something else? Have they done anything to you, love?” Alice’s soft voice met his ears as she caressed his new plait. Sirius nodded. </p><p>“They…I don’t want to talk about it, really. I don’t want to go back. I want to never have to go back.” He said, “If I could stay with James on holidays, I wouldn’t need to go back. I wouldn’t have to see them again, but they’d never allow that. I don’t want to go back.” His voice faltered on the last sentiment. Alice’s petting didn’t cease. Lily was nodding, brilliant green eyes sympathetic. Marlene looked like she was going to explode. </p><p>“That’s what’s wrong here. Not you, them. What have they done to you to make you like that?” She gestured at his hunched shoulders, shaking hands, short breaths. “If you don’t stay with James, then you’re staying with me, or…” Sirius shook his head.</p><p>“I appreciate it, Marls, but my parents wouldn’t even really let me stay with James for long, and he’s a long line of wealthy pureblood, even though they’ve all been in Gryffindor. They see you as a potential future wife, well not really, but, I wouldn’t be allowed.” He shifted his gaze to the floor, too ashamed to meet Marlene’s gaze.</p><p>“I understand, Sirius. Don’t get too upset about that. I wouldn’t want to marry you either, no offense.” He shrugged as if to say, ‘none taken.’</p><p>“Sirius, I think you should tell Remus. I really do. I think it will make it better. You’ll get it all off your chest, and if he’s still mad at you then, then at least it’s not anything you can help, right?” Lily offered, placing a slender hand on his knee. He nodded, conjuring a smile for the three girls. They smiled back. </p><p>As he stood, Alice grabbed his hand. “Hey Sirius, come back to us after term starts and we might paint your nails for you. Mary found this wonderful varnish that Marls enchanted to change with your moods. It’s amazing.” She patted his arm as he turned away. Sirius swelled with anticipation and relief. Lily said he wasn’t wrong, just different. Perhaps that’s all he needed someone to say. </p><p>~*~*~*~</p><p>Remus was nearly asleep when he heard his curtain slide open, and felt a weight drop down behind him. He hadn’t heard Sirius coming to bed, let alone having a nightmare. The other boy settled in behind him, very tense, and very much curled into a ball. “Re, Moony, are you awake?”  Remus grunted in response. “Okay, I need to tell you a few things, and I figured it would be easier to do that in the dark.” It was Remus’ turn to tense. Had Sirius noticed that his chest wasn’t as flat as his or James’? Did he catch Remus looking at him a little longer than was appropriate? He heard Sirius murmuring silencing charms before he rolled onto his back, and then sat up. </p><p>“Sirius?” Remus asked, sitting up beside him. Sirius rested his head on Remus’ shoulder for a second before sitting up again. </p><p>“Moony, I just want to say that you’re one of my best friends, and you’re so important to me, and I don’t want what I say next to make me lose you, and if you don’t mind, I’d like to tell James and Peter in my own time.” </p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Rem, I don’t think I like girls,” Remus took in a sharp breath. He could remember a similar conversation with his parents when he was thirteen. “But…I, I don’t think I like boys either. I think I might someday; I don’t know what that is or why I am, but I just don’t feel whatever pull everyone else feels, I want friends, and I want to have cuddles, but I don’t want to kiss anyone, I just want to be. And Rem sometimes I just feel out of place in my body and I don’t know why or what’s wrong, but that’s…that’s part of it.” Remus couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t move. He didn’t know what to do. It would be so easy now to say, Sirius, I know what you’re talking about, and I know how you feel. I know, I know, I know, and it’s going to be alright. I’m here. But he couldn’t bring the words to his lips. He could feel Sirius shaking, so he brought up his own shaking arm and wrapped it around his friend. </p><p>“Is that what the nightmares are?” He asked, and felt Sirius shake his head, then nod, then shake his head again. “It’s okay, Pads. It really is. Do you want us to do anything?” Another shake. “Okay.” Sirius tucked his head under Remus’ chin.</p><p>“I don’t know what to do, Rem. I don’t know what this is, or how to tell anyone, but…we’re still friends, right?” Remus nodded, pulling Sirius even closer to him. </p><p>“Now, Pads, what about the nightmares?” Sirius shuddered against him. “It’s okay, Sirius, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk about it tonight. Maybe tomorrow?” Sirius nodded slowly. “Okay, let’s go to bed now. I think it would be smart to tell James and Pete before hols, though, right?” Sirius nodded and broke away from Remus’ arms. He lay down beside him, and Remus pressed his back against his and they breathed in harmony, and there were no nightmares. </p><p>~*~*~*~</p><p>For the first time since Sirius had started sleeping in his bed, Remus was not the first to wake up. He stirred when he heard broken cries coming from beyond the curtains. Then Peter’s voice saying, “Okay, Pads it’s a little early for all this, don’t you think?” A soft whimper and then, “Oh, no, Sirius, I don’t…come here.” And the cries were muffled. Peter must be hugging Sirius—he did like that. Remus flipped to the end of his bed, and stuck his head out. He would’ve laughed at the scene that met his eyes if he hadn’t known that Sirius must’ve just told their friends what he told him last night. </p><p>James was sitting cross legged on the floor, looking like a burned dandelion, and Peter was kneeling on Sirius’ trunk, his arms around him. Sirius was crying, his hair in an intricate plait with odd pieces and ends sticking out, indicating that he had slept with it in. Sirius’ sobs were slowing as Peter stroked his back. “So, mate, I-I’d just like you to go over this again for us. I don’t know if we have g-grasped the situation, seeing as neither of us has been awake for five minutes y-yet.” Remus suppressed a grin at James’ spluttering, and pulled himself out of the curtains to sit at the end of his bed. </p><p>He looked at Sirius still trying to compose themself, and spoke up, “Siri, I can if you want,” He offered, and Sirius nodded, burying their head into Peter’s chest. Remus met James’ confused expression and tried to give him a reassuring smile. “Okay so I don’t know what Sirius has already said, but since you both look lost, I’ll start from the beginning.” James nodded, so he continued, “So when everyone is born, they get assigned a gender based on their genitalia, but people’s sexual preferences, who they’re attracted to, don’t always correlate to their sex, which is to say, their genitalia. Sometimes that means that these people are homosexual…” </p><p>He trailed off, feeling a flush rising, his heartbeat picking up, what if he sounded too informed about this, would they guess? He took a couple of grounding breaths, and continued. This wasn’t about him, this was about Sirius, and he deserved an explanation as well. “So people are expected to be attracted to the opposite gender in order to reproduce, but sometimes people are attracted to the same gender, that’s homosexual…In Sirius’ case, he doesn’t fall into that category. Sirius isn’t attracted to anyone right now, that doesn’t mean that he won’t ever be, but maybe…So we shouldn’t push him to go into any relationships romantic or sexual that he doesn’t want to be in. It’s quite simple actually.”</p><p>James had his eyebrows drawn together, worrying his bottom teeth between his teeth. “Okay.” He said, getting up and pulling Sirius into a hug. “You bloody idiot, stop crying. I guess you’ll just have to be our wingman. Whatever. You’re still a Marauder. Merlin, it’s too early for this. I’ve been reduced to emotion. I’m heading to the shower.” James pulled away, rumpling Sirius’ hair as he made his way to the bathroom. </p><p>Peter was still sitting on Sirius’ trunk, and met his eyes with a wide grin. “Alright there, Padfoot?” He asked, and Sirius smiled through the last of his tears and nodded. Peter nodded back and moved to his trunk, grabbing his robes and changing. Sirius turned to Remus, smile still in place. Remus saw a glint of mischief cross his face, and was immediately on alert. Sirius jumped at him, and he rolled out of the way. That look meant contact, and Remus was not wearing his binder, and his pyjamas were thin, and he would not allow that this morning. Sirius landed on his bed with a soft thump, and Remus stood over him grimacing. He tried to school his features, but must’ve failed because he saw the hurt cross his best friend’s face when they met his eyes. Remus grabbed his robes and held them to his chest. </p><p>“I…I was just gonna get dressed, Pads. I’m, I just…let me get dressed and then we can tussle?” Sirius nodded slowly, moving away from Remus’ bed. The moon was coming in two days; the day before term ended, and Remus was already sore. He felt it in his every joint and every muscle. A small part of him hoped his friends would figure out their own transformations before his next one, but the completely not mental side of him wished that they would never master becoming Animagi, because it was illegal, and he desperately needed them more than just at the full moon. </p><p>~*~*~*~</p><p>The morning after the full moon, Remus woke in his private room in the Hospital Wing with all three of his friends snoring around him. Peter slept at the end of the bed, curled near Remus’ feet. James slept, head cradled in his arms, next to Remus’ left side, as if he’d been watching the werewolf before nodding off. Sirius was in a chair beside the wall, head lolled to the side, the farthest from Remus. Things had been slightly tense between them since Remus had refused rough housing the morning Sirius had come out to the Marauders. </p><p>Gingerly, Remus tested his wounds, chest was wrapped with gauze, so there’d been scratches there again, no surprise, and the sharp, blinding pain of a couple cracked ribs. His lower back and abdomen burned and ached. He moved slightly again, and felt the wet, stickiness of blood beneath him. He frowned. That was very unlike Madam Pomfrey to leave a wound open and undressed. He reached for his wand to trip the wards. Madam Pomfrey shuffled in, took one look at him, and gently woke his friends. They turned smiling faces toward Remus before they were being shepherded to the door. Protests rang out, and Remus was becoming more and more jittery and concerned. </p><p>“What is it?” Remus asked, and Madam Pomfrey smiled kindly at him. She lifted his covers, muttered a cleaning charm, and Remus felt the blood on his legs and sheets evaporate, but the discomfort remained. </p><p>“Remus, dear, I’m sure you know about menstruation?” She asked, sitting in the chair previously occupied by James. Remus blanched. “Yes, dear. Having no experience with female werewolves, I was not sure if the lycanthropy would effect this cycle, but I can see now that your uterus seems to be in working order.” Remus tried very hard to control his breathing, and to ignore the black spots appearing in his vision. </p><p>“Isn’t…isn’t there anything we can do?” His voice broke, “I’ve been researching hormone potions, and I think…I want to try them. I don’t care what my parents say, I-I’m sick of this! I don’t want to be a werewolf. I don’t want,” he gestured to his pelvic region, “I just want to be a regular boy, and this makes me even more of a freak than I was before.” Madam Pomfrey put a hand on Remus’ shoulder. </p><p>“Dear, even if we started those potions today, it would take months for them to take effect, and I’m afraid you are going to have to live with this for at least a year.” Seeing the look on Remus’ face, she hastily continued, “I will owl your parents and ask them to consider again. I can inform them of this situation, and try to persuade them. It would indeed be easier to try these potion regimes sooner than later.” Remus nodded eagerly. </p><p>“Please, please, and what,” He suppressed a sob, “What do I do now? With that?” He pointed this time. </p><p>~*~*~*~</p><p>The Marauders were quickly and quietly forced from Remus’ room, and even in their half-sleep state, they tried to eaves drop on the conversation taking place through the door. They caught only snippets, “Female werewolves,” … “More of a freak than I was before,” … “Potions,” … “Owl your parents,” …and stepped away as a unit. </p><p>“Well that was strange.” Peter said, clasping his hands together. James and Sirius nodded. </p><p>“What do you think she meant, about female werewolves? Do they need to…find a mate for Remus or something?” James asked, grimacing. Sirius shook their head. </p><p>“No. Pomfrey would never force that on him…they said something about potions and owling his parents…” The boys stood in contemplative silence for the next several minutes before Madam Pomfrey left Remus’ room, and told them they could go back in if they were gentle and quiet. They filed in slowly, and were met with Remus’ small back, the boy curled as much into a ball as he could manage with his injuries. </p><p>Sirius sat on the bed behind him, laying down and gently pressing his back to Remus’, feeling rather than hearing the shuddering of sobs racking his friend’s body. Peter perched at the end of the bed, facing James who sat before Sirius in his chair, to give his friend a modicum of privacy. </p><p>“Look, Moony, you don’t have to tell us what’s wrong, we just want to know you’re alright.” James said, meeting Sirius’ worried gaze with his own. They heard Remus take a slow, short, shuddering breath. </p><p>“I-I d-don’t want to talk about it, right now. I’m not dying.” He said softly. Peter rested his hand on his foot, and Remus resisted the urge to jerk away, as he had when Sirius rested their back against him earlier. He tried to calm himself by focusing on their mixture of scents that meant home, safe, friends, but found his fears and thoughts drowning them out. </p><p>They all left the next morning slightly subdued. Remus not looking forward to his coming conversations with his parents, Peter and James because their friends weren’t themselves, and Sirius because he just knew he’d do something to warrant another curse or beating from his parents.</p>
