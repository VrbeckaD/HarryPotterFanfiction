    <p>Department of Mysteries, 1996<br/>Wavy dark red hair hung in her face. She was being held at wand point in the Department of Mysteries by Bellatrix Lestrange so she dare not move the strands hindering her view. </p><p>At 18 years old, two years older than the people she came with, she agreed to break into the Department of Mysteries to save Sirius Black with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Ginny and Neville. She had joined the order when they did, becoming good friends with everyone in the order. Her heart broke for Harry when she learned of his parent's fate. Remus and Sirius sat up one night telling her and Neville the whole story over coffee. She hugged both men before she went to bed and told them she was glad she knew them. </p><p>They both seemed a little choked up when she said it so she simply left bidding them goodnight.</p><p>Now the smell of insanity and sweat overpowered her as Harry stood with the glass orb in his hands and being told to hand it over.</p><p>The next thing anyone knew the Order of the Phoenix was there to save the day. The Death Eaters moving into battle position and letting their captives go. <br/>Remus Lupin and Kingsley were a few of the first Marie spotted. She then saw Sirius sassing Lucius Malfoy and the fight began.</p><p>She shouted mostly protection charms but got a few attack ones in. </p><p>Suddenly she heard the shout of a "crucio" being sent her way. However, before it hit her she felt someone tackle her to the ground. Remus Lupin had gotten her out of the way just in time. As he stood, he offered his hand to her and she got up with him. “Thank you” She said. He smiled at her and then pushed her back behind him and began fighting alongside Kingsley. </p><p>She, Luna and Neville began moving toward the exit but one of the Death Eaters spotted her. Somehow he had started chasing her down one of the corridors. </p><p>“Stupefy!” came the shout of a spell that knocked her into a shelving unit, her back hitting the edges. Suddenly orbs were falling and cracking around her feet.<br/>A blue smoke began emanating from them and soon her vision blurred and the world spun. Wand in hand she put her hands on her head in hopes to soothe the spinning, she was under attack and needed to focus.</p><p>When things stopped spinning she opened her eyes. However, she wasn’t in the department of Mysteries anymore. She was in a...a field, she saw the shrieking shack in the distance. <br/>Suddenly she saw a black dog appear from behind some bushes. She instantly recognized the dog.</p><p>“Sirius, How did we get here?” She asked then prompt fell to the ground and passed out.</p>
