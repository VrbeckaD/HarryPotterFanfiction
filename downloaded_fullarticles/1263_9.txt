          <div class="userstuff"><p>Not everything in often very thick investigation files gets publicly detailed or explained in a trial and neither will it happen in Unforgiven Pride, but I needed as plausible a judicial background as possible to work with, within the necessary limits of fiction and dramatic effects.</p><p>I find myself at a publishing standstill right now, not because I do not write (I do, but very slowly), but because I need to finish and be satisfied with all the trial chapters. The timing is very important and I am constantly going back and forth with the various witnesses, arguments and revelations. So, the bad news are that you will have to wait until I am finished with the trial to be able to read another chapter. The good news being that you will not have to wait one or two months between chapters when I am through. As a sort of compensation and because I am regularly asked when I will post next or if I am still working on the story, here is the material for Snape's trial. </p><p>Now, I am certainly no law expert and what little I know is about the French judicial system, which is very different from Common Law based or inspired judicial systems. For example, we do not have any system of guilty-not guilty pleading system at this time, although there is a strong case to introduce it to help unify with most other legal systems in Europe.</p><p>I must offer a colossal tribute to Tra8erse, who helped me make sense of the British legal system and translate properly the charges. She is sorely missed!</p><p>  </p><p><u><b>THE COMPLAINTS</b></u>:</p><p>The complaints may be faked and adapted to HP adult fan lore, they are unfortunately derived from real situations of rape and sexual abuse. This is the reason why I will not publish the details on Fanfiction.net or even in a proper chapter of the story here at AO3. I tried not to be crude but to walk the very fine line policemen and justice system employees have to walk when they have to report criminal facts. <strong>TRIGGER WARNING</strong>.</p><p>(all muggle-born names are invented, but you know, we are 7,7 billions, there’s bound to be homonyms...)</p><p>There are 15 complaints against Snape:</p><p>2 from Slytherin parents on behalf of the way their children were treated during the Battle of Hogwarts,</p><p>13 for rape or abuse of muggleborn students.</p><p>To be clear in terms of procedures, each complaint is supposed to be judged separately by a civil court, or in the case of the wizarding world by a regular Wizengamot session, but the complaints denounce crimes and breaking of the law, for which the Ministry sue Snape in the Plenary High Court.</p><p>The two complaints from Slytherin parents will go nowhere, of course. They will be repelled, since it is really Minerva who took the decisions, as already explained in chapters 11 &amp; 12. I wrote them only to show that the side of the «Light» could be incriminated, too, if the real purpose was Justice for everyone, but the victims here are « just » Slytherins for the victors, just like Hermione was « just » a Mudblood for the Snatchers and for the pureblood supremacists. So, Minerva will never hear about it again, at least officially. Neither will Horace Slughorn, who is now celebrated for ‘fighting the right fight’.</p><p>We already know that the rape complaints are forgeries (although there are 5 real victims and 2 reported missing), but they must have the appearance of authenticity, both in the content and the respect of investigation procedures to be accepted by the Wizengamot. Maybe, some of you will say that you can see right through them and that such a botched investigation is impossible. I am most willing to be presented with evidence that procedures are always respected to the letter and that only foolproof evidence is ever used, particularly in highly sensitive or political issues or during ‘legal purges’, which is the context of Snape’s trial. Or even that Wizarding Britain is a democracy and not a ploutocracy.</p><p>I use the “progressive” definition of rape cited in Wikipedia about Rape during the Bosnian War : « the penetration of any part of the body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body by force, coercion, taking advantage of a coercitive environment, or against a person unable to give genuine consent. » Under the English law the definition of rape is much narrower – you need penetration with a penis for it to be rape. Everything else is ‘assault by penetration’. The difference is technical – it does not mean that penetration with an object or any other means is less grave, just a different classification of offences. Though it does mean that only men can commit rape in this country and it is not consistent with the active role of witches in the HP universe and the power they wield.</p><p>I also gave several hints in previous chapters that prolonged Cruciatus, particularly aimed at the sexual organs, destroys fertility. It is my personal extrapolation for the purpose of the story as to why the Cruciatus is an Unforgivable but not many other horrible curses, because let’s face it, everything can be used to humiliate, hurt and torture, as proved by the commonplace Charms used by the Marauders against Snape. What they did to him in his “worst memory” would lead to charges of assault in our world and the fact that there were absolutely no consequences for what was obviously repeated instances of bullying and demeaning is all the more shocking. Just like all the other evidences of bullying in all seven books. Unfortunately, human beings’ creativity applies to torture and evil pursuits of all sorts just as efficiently as to anything else.</p><p>1/ <u>Victim</u>: Edmund Flint, male, 15, pureblood, Slytherin.</p><p>Imprisoned in the Slytherin Common Room without means to protect himself at the beginning of the Battle of Hogwarts, then sent away to Hogsmeade with the whole House of Slytherin under the sole protection of Horace Slughorn.</p><p>Left in the sole company of other minors after being told he could either stay in the Hog’s Head, a pub full of alcoholic beverages without adult supervision in the middle of a war zone or go home, without any mean to do so.</p><p><u>Charges</u>: Ill-treatment of a minor by a person in a position of trust.

  <strong> <u>THE ACT OF ACCUSATION</u> </strong>
</p><p>I used as inspiration cases from various International Criminal Tribunals. In Unforgiven Pride, Snape may not be guilty of most of the crimes in his act of accusation or he has the justification of acting undercover for the Order of the Phoenix, it does not make him innocent either, whatever extenuating circumstances we can find or want to find. I will certainly not tell at this point what the verdict will be, even if it the evil author that I am has long written it, but I hope reading this will leave you at least a little uneasy and reflecting about what Justice is really about, and how mere flesh and blood people pretend they can render it - let alone live with it. </p><p>You may note contradictions or redundancy in some charges. It is not a mistake. I also particularly enjoyed drafting possible offences of "ill-treatment" and "wilful endangerment" of a minor by a person in a position of trust. Ha! According to the entire HP saga, the entire staff of Hogwarts and most adults should be charged with that one...  But it is a children story, isn't it?</p><table width="100%">
