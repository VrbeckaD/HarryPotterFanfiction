          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in a mansion many miles away from Godric's Hollow where the young Harry 
Potter defeated Lord Voldemort just days ago. Caradoc and Dorcas Dearborn have just received word of the way it went.</p><p>Caradoc smiled. "I have some divine news, my dear."</p><p>Dorcas insisted, "Go on, tell me."</p><p>Caradoc replied, "Harry Potter killed Lord Voldemort, we won the war."</p><p>Dorcas grinned. "I always knew that we would, just not quite how I imagined it would be."</p><p>Caradoc beamed, "After I saved your life I knew it too."</p><p>Dorcas frowned. "We should not have ran away."</p><p>Caradoc muttered, "They were trying to kill you, especially Lord Voldemort."</p><p>Dorcas stated, "I know, but they will deem us cowards for leaving when we did."</p><p>Caradoc answered, "Nothing of the sort, dear. I informed the Order that we were going into hiding because your life was in danger. They said that we could stay away as long as we needed to."</p><p>Dorcas sighed. "I suppose, but now we must leave this wonderful home."</p><p>Caradoc reassured her, "I can keep this house for the summer if you like."</p><p>Dorcas smiled. "That sounds wonderful."</p></div>
