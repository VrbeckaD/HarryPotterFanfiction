    <p>Scorpius had been overexcited all day. He was a bundle of nervous energy, jumping about and running all over the house. Draco looked desperately at Astoria, who returned his expression with amused exhaustion.<br/>
“Do we let him tire himself out?”<br/>
Scorpius’ seventh birthday had been a very small affair. The three of them had sat on the floor of the living room while he opened his presents, including an illustrated copy of the book he had so desperately wanted. Draco had spent months trying to get hold of it- it was an extremely rare book full of scientific exploration, but written almost like a storybook, full of anecdotes of exploration. He had cursed, more than once, the librarian in their part of the kingdom who had mentioned the book to Scorpius. He had set his sights on it instantly and, upon seeing the title embossed in gold on the leather cover, completely lost his mind. That, in combination with the sheer quantities of sugar he had eaten- a birthday treat that seemed like a good idea at the time- meant that even though the sun was long down, Scorpius looked as far from sleep as it was possible to be.<br/>
“Let me try.” Astoria moved from her chair down to the floor, kneeling at her son’s height as he stopped careening off furniture for a moment to face her. “Time for bed, Scorpius.”<br/>
“No!”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“No!”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“We could read to you?” Draco interrupted before this could carry on all night. Scorpius considered this offer carefully. But Astoria had an inkling that reading would only make Scorpius more excited.<br/>
“Or I could sing to you.” Astoria suggested, and Scorpius nodded enthusiastically.<br/>
“Okay, get into bed now and I’ll come upstairs in a moment.”<br/>
As the patter of Scorpius’s footsteps on the staircase faded, Astoria watched him disappear with a soft smile. Draco pulled her in close to him and wrapped his arms around her, and she settled against him automatically.<br/>
They didn’t say anything, just stood together peacefully for a moment, enjoying the silence. Draco felt like the rest of the world beyond their house had just fallen away.<br/>
“I’ll head up and try and get Scorpius to settle.” Astoria moved her head back from where it had been resting on her husband’s shoulder.<br/>
“Rather you than me.” Draco replied in a low voice, near a whisper.<br/>
Astoria smiled, and kissed him, wrapping her hand in his.<br/>
“I love you.”<br/>
“I love you too.”</p><p>Scorpius had managed to change into his pyjamas, but not much more than that. He beamed up at his mother as she entered, still bursting with energy.<br/>
“Okay, Scorpius, time for sleep.” Scorpius seemed a little disgruntled by the suggestion. Astoria had to resist laughing at his little pout. She sat down next to him on the bed and pulled him close to her instead. “Do you still want me to sing to you?”<br/>
He nestled into her shoulder and mumbled in the affirmative. She ran her hand through his mop of white blonde hair, and he collapsed into her lap, all his energy suddenly disappeared.<br/>
Pulling him as close to her as possible, Astoria started to sing.</p><p>“Where the north wind meets the sea,<br/>
There's a river full of memory.<br/>
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound,<br/>
For in this river all is found.</p><p>In her waters, deep and true,<br/>
Lie the answers, and a path for you.<br/>
Dive down deep into her sound,<br/>
But not too far or you'll be drowned.</p><p>Yes, she will sing to those who'll hear,<br/>
And in her song, all magic flows<br/>
But can you brave what you most fear?<br/>
Can you face what the river knows?</p><p>Where the north wind meets the sea,<br/>
There's a mother full of memory.<br/>
Come, my darling, homeward bound,<br/>
When all is lost, then all is found.”</p>
