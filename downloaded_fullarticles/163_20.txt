    <p align="center">Remember when you'd sing just for the fuck of it?</p><p align="center">Any joy it would bring;</p><p align="center">Honey, the look of it was as sweet as the sound,</p><p align="center">Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds.</p>
<hr/><p>Jaskier was his mother’s son from head to toe, a near splitting image of her (dark-haired - an oddity to the usual white-gold - and fair-skinned, eyes shining an enchanting cornflower blue). It was to the point that once or twice, he’d wondered if Veela simply reproduced asexually during autonomy lessons at Beauxbatons. </p><p>“We fuck properly. Like everyone else.” Dear cousin Fleur said, and it was the first time Jaskier had ever heard her swear. Jaskier stayed too dumbfounded to bombard Fleur with any more questions, obnoxiously, just because he could. Then on the second time - “Prove it.” he said. Jaskier was more prepared, but clearly not enough because Fleur had promptly dragged him to her home’s Pensieve and took a vial of memories with Veela pornography in it. </p><p>Jaskier had never been shocked so speechless. </p><p>By the time he was thirteen moons, Jaskier had declared himself free from even a flask of blood from his father. It was a joke, really, as his mother was prone to spend weeks in bed, resting blankly as though she’d no purpose in life. Only mentions of his father seemed to stir her attention during those days and Jaskier would try relentlessly to add his mysterious, deceased father into their one-sided conversations however he could without coming off too insensitive.</p><p><em>No purpose, </em>huh. Jaskier had pushed the door to his mother’s room open, the first syllables of his joke on his tongue. Warm rays of sunlight flushed through the large windows.  </p><p>She had Jaskier. Why wasn’t he enough? The half-Veela brushed off the thought, gliding over to her bed and plopping himself over her lap covered by a silk blanket. “Be honest, dearest mother. You’d cloned me yourself, haven’t you? My everything comes from you. My pretty face, my pretty voice. Are you listening? I’m only so beautiful because my mother is so. I even have your love for music - the great Veela, Lady Pankratz! Whose voice can even enchant the fairest of unicorns!” </p><p>He was years too old to act like a just born hatchling, but his mother had smiled, weak and <em>wanting,</em> and told him otherwise in fond defense of his father. </p><p>“Your love for music belongs to him.” </p><p>“Is that love not from you?” Jaskier asked, playfully plucking the strings of his mother’s lute where he’d snatched it from her bedside and played with nary a proper tune. Everybody knew how the Veela valued their songs. “No,” She said, and paused for a moment to untangle a knot in one of Jaskier’s feathers where his wings flared for balance behind him. </p><p>“I loved people more than I did music. And then you were given to me as fast as your father was taken away from me. You carry as much as me as you do your father, dear Dandelion. Don’t be ashamed of your human blood outside our family.”</p><p>Jaskier was rather astounded to hear her speak of his father fondly, for the man had often been a sore subject. Most of the sisterhood tip-toed around his heritage as if to let a sleeping Cerberus lie too, so Jaskier was eager to grab an opportunity to hear more of the man his mother defied Grandmother to be with. </p><p>She spoke of his charming words, his handsome face. He was one of the rare humans to be immune to a Veela’s charm. She liked that about him. That and how he was also genuine and kind. Months into their courting, she’d broken his deceased brother’s Firebolt by accident and Jaskier’s father had not raised his voice; his first concern was if his mother had injured herself - she, who was as tough as nails from the Magic woven in her blood and bones.</p><p>Her voice was full of love, full of ache.</p><p>Jaskier wanted to find a love like hers. He said so and his mother shook her head, showing her disapproval. “I pray you don’t. The loss of their passing,” She sighed, “Worse still, <em>rejection</em>, will hurt more than one should bear in a lifetime. I hope you’ll never fall for the temptations of temporary bliss.”</p><p>Jaskier didn’t say anything in return, busy flailing when his mother pulled his nose and gave a soft laugh. Her slender fingers moved to his cheeks next, manicured nails grazing over tender skin so carefully it tickled. In a corner of his mind, Jaskier filed her advice away in favour of living in the happiness that made his eyes light up at seeing, hearing, <em>feeling </em>his mother’s rare expression of joy.</p><p>When he left her room, feathers preened and cheeks rosy from fond, teasing pinches, Jaskier was quick to approach his favourite cousin Fleur. She was a good listener as Jaskier was a good talker. He’d not visited her for months already, young Gabrielle having occupied most of her sister’s time jealously. </p><p>In the beautiful flourish of his human uncle’s garden, Jaskier’s hands were out of control with excitement. Flinging about, waving excitedly as he built an embellished story from his day from top to bottom. Fleur listened attentively with Gabrielle’s snores sinking into her stomach as she slept. Jaskier’s mother was last on the agenda, “I’d sell my heart to find a mate like mother’s. Such would make a captivating song; don’t you think?”</p><p>Fleur carded her fingers in her precious little sister’s hair. Jaskier crooned at the sight; Fleur was an untouchable and sublime creature in Beauxbatons - cold-faced and graceful, beautiful, but Jaskier had only known her to be the girl who braided dandelion flowers into his wings. Who cried when her sister was born because she was terribly excited to be an elder sister. The quarter-Veela said, rather bluntly, “You’re thirteen, Jask.” and Jaskier just knew it was the motherly instinct in her talking. </p><p>Years of practice that had come from guiding her sister the best she can, always so afraid of setting a bad example. Jaskier was less worried about the little things such as setting whatever a role model was. </p><p>Jaskier was a free spirit, his mother’s son. </p><p>“We’re both thirteen!” He cried indignantly, then in a hushed and smiling whisper, “I’ve been having dreams, Fleur. Of maidens and men. It’d be a good time to start searching for my love, no? Aunt Isabelle found her mate when she was our age.”</p><p>“Aunt Isabelle had children a year after.” Fleur deadpanned. “Their time differs from ours. I find it rather morbid, too, that you take your mother’s pain so lightly.”</p><p>Jaskier’s expression sunk a little, feathers drooping in tandem. “That’s not true.”</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>“Really!” Jaskier nodded strongly. “I - I simply can’t help myself. Everyone is simply too lovely to resist; won’t you agree? <em>Oh,</em> how my heart beats for a thousand different smiles, a thousand different notes of laughter, ringing in the dining hall as I sing my songs during supper - the Nymphs can complain all they like, but I know they adore me as much as I do them. It’s like I fall in love with everyone a little. I want to make most of my feelings, Fleur. It’s because my mother is the way she is that I don’t wish to be like her.”</p><p>A sympathetic look flashed across Fleur’s face and Jaskier pretended to have missed it. His cousin hummed, a tune crystal clear against the fickle wind that whistled past where they sat. “I won’t be against you,” She finally said, slowly, cautiously. “But Madame Maxime will have your hide if she finds you in any of the girls’ rooms at night or Melitele forbid, come morning. No <em>flying </em>with anyone until you - and me, I suppose - are sixteen at least. I mean it, Jask.”</p><p>“I’ll stay clear, promise!” Jaskier beamed, feathers bristling with delight. </p><p>Fleur’s gaze flickered to her sister’s napping figure before rising to meet Jaskier. Veela senses were naturally sharper than most, and Fleur didn’t bother to be subtle, so Jaskier could easily hear her sharp intake of breath. “Be careful, Jask. Not all heartbreaks will be the same.”</p><p>Jaskier grinned, standing on his feet to move behind Fleur. He undid the leather strap tied casually in her hair and proceeded to tie a loose fishtail braid with the ease of having done so a thousand times before. Fleur allowed her posture to relax slightly, singing along to Jaskier's song as their voices carried in the wind. </p>
