          <div class="userstuff"><p>I used to love the color red.</p><p>It was the color of your hair, the hair that I loved to run my hands through. And when the sun shone upon your hair in just the right way, it seemed to glow. I loved that, I loved that so very much. </p><p>It was the color of your freckles that seemed to be painted one by one upon your body. They were perfect; beautiful. I absolutely adored that. </p><p>It was the color your cheeks turned when we kissed. And I would hold your reddened cheeks, run my thumbs along them as our mouths met. Lovely, it was. </p><p>But now, I can't stand the color red. </p><p>I can't stand seeing it; wearing it.</p><p>Too many thoughts, too many grievances. </p><p>Because I won't ever be able to hug you again. Kiss you. Feel your body against mine.</p><p>And I can't handle that. I really can't. </p><p>Sometimes I wonder if you can see me. If you watch me. And I'm not sure if I'll ever know.</p><p>Because you're gone, and I'm still here.</p></div>
