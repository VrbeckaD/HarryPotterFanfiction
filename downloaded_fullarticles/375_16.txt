    <p>It had always been within a gentleman's favor to find a bride that will be both suitable of class and wealth. This fact rang throughout England and was instilled in children from a young age. For those already married and have neither grand status or illustrious wealth, it was in their best interest to wish for their offspring's success in finding a marital partner. </p><p>The Malfoys were not a family of extravagant wealth, nor were they a family of resounding fame, but their home was of considerable stature and their reputation deemed them well-groomed citizens of society. Lucius Malfoy, patriarch of the Malfoy family, had been a merchant in his early years and was able to provide a rather comfortable living for his wife and child due to an inheritance that was bestowed upon him. Although this estate was located further away from town, it included a small farm and garden in which produce was accessible. It wasn't necessarily frugal living, situated in a large plot of land, but it wasn't comparable to the mansions that were located down by the river. Therefore, the Malfoys found themselves between two worlds: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. </p><p>Narcissa Malfoy was a lovely woman; a woman who enjoyed the finer accessories of life. A french native, Narcissa was fond of all things lace, gold, pearl, and glass. An upright woman, Narcissa walked with a graceful air, as if she floated upon clouds. Her head held high and a taste for luxury, she attempted to make her home, what was at first a dilapidated and broken farmhouse, into a cozy and loving environment for her newborn son, Draco. Draco had been the crown jewel of the Malfoy family. Doted on by both his parents, Draco had grown within a family of adoration and fondness. Although his mother sometimes smothered him, nitpicking and pushing little details, she wished to gift Draco with any luxury their small fortune could afford. His father, although not as overbearing, was just as affectionate, if not more. Draco had always found a special bond with his father that surpassed his bond with his mother. Lucius may not have been a rather emotional man, but often did Draco find a warm hand on his shoulder, or patting his back. Often did he find a warm chest to hug into when he absolutely needed one and often did Lucius', firm tone bring ease to his senses. His family was enough, more than enough for his tastes. </p><p>Draco had been a child of extreme beauty, a child with good breeding. His parents had often joked they had raised a fairy or nymph or any other woodland creature of storytale instead of a human boy. Lithe figure, sharp features, brilliant grey eyes and icy blond hair, Draco was otherworldly. Porcelain skin, creamy and pale to the eye that rose to soft pink when flushed, Draco found himself at the center of attention within the young men in town when he was doing his daily shopping. A sweet fawn amongst a group of wild boars, Draco had never been like the other boys his age. While the others boys grew to be muscular and hairy, a true symbol of virility and blind pride, Draco had grown to be somewhat of a fair maiden, delicate and elegant. This fact was to his mother's delight, who desperately wished to see her child engaged and married by the time he was 16. Preferably to a man of wealthy means who would give her son a life of riches and comfort. </p><p>At 18 years old, Draco was neither engaged, nor married. Much to his mother's disdain, Draco had never found himself drawn to romantic affairs like the girls in his classes, or the women his mother would bring home for tea and gossip. Narcissa often joked that Draco's dispassionate for romance was the bane of her existence. Her pretty child, as beautiful as fresh fallen snow on vibrant green English countryside, would rather bury his head in books and poetry than socialize and would rather dirty his hands and clothes with soil from gardening, than wear crisp white linens and lace. Narcissa often blamed her husband for Draco's rather independent and headstrong behavior. He was not docile and giddy like the other girls his age had been, but instead he was sharp tongued, rather crass at times and otherwise blunt. Although Draco's sarcastic comments often brought a smile and chuckle to his father's face, his mother abhorred this personality characteristic of her son. Draco, at times, could be rather charming and witty. In fact, he felt rather comfortable when confronted with a battle of wits. But, his mother feared that his slightly boorish behavior would scare away potential partners who would much rather prefer a bubbly airhead than a brooding scholar. Draco never really minded this fact and often told his mother he wouldn't mind never getting married (at this comment, Narcissa gasped and held her heart, telling Draco to not say such things).<br/>
---</p><p>Draco was blessed to have one good friend in his life that he could rely on and shared his affinity for some of his hobbies. Hermione Granger was a pretty girl, with wild and lush chestnut locks and curious honey eyes, she and Draco often joked that they were the opposites of each other. Draco and Hermione often found themselves taking strolls by the river, discussing books they've read or the daily news. For Draco, who had never had a sibling or companion, Hermione had meant the world to him. Today, the pair had decided to walk through town, picking up meat for their meals at home. </p><p>"Have you heard about the men who have purchased the estates down in Derbyshire?" Hermione asked as she ran her hands down the piles of fruits that were for sale, picking some up and bringing them to her nose to smell and then placing down again. </p><p>"Oh?" Draco asked as he flipped through the pages of the book he had picked up, eyes not even lifting to meet his friend's face. "And are these men of any specific concern for me orâ€¦?"</p><p>"It's the estate that's down the road from your home. Perhaps you'll be neighbors with a cool, mysterious gentlemen who'll sweep you off your feet~" Hermione smirked like a cat, mischievous and teasing. </p><p>Draco snorted and let out an exasperated "ha" as he closed his book. "Oh, wouldn't that be lovely, my mother will be thrilled!" Draco exclaimed sarcastically, setting the book back down and picking up his wicker shopping basket again. "If he's anything like the other extremely wealthy men who cooly and mysteriously buy mansions at the end of the road, he'll be nothing but arrogant and prideful."</p><p>"Oh come now, Draco. How could you be so pessimistic?" Hermione whined, "With your good looks, any man would be lucky to have you, arrogant or not" </p><p>"And am I to simply ignore these characteristics? Simply marry a man regardless if he's an absolute brute as long as he can afford the mansions in Derbyshire?" Draco scoffed, "Now you're sounding like my mother, 'Mione" </p><p>"I'm simply saying, do you really not care for romance? You truly don't want a future husband?" Hermione asked as she and Draco walked down the road towards their homes. Draco mulled over the question for a second, biting his bottom lip. </p><p>"If one day, God bestowed upon me a man who is worthy of me, then perhaps I would marry." Draco sighed. "But from what I have seen, all men are pigs who wallow in their own muck. Good riddance, I say," Draco huffed, crossing his arms. </p><p>"Then perhaps we should work extra hard to find such a man for you~ the poorer the better since you seem to detest rich men," Hermione teased once more, which earned a sharp shove from Draco, causing Hermione to giggle.<br/>
---</p><p>"Mother! Father! I'm home," Draco called as he entered through the door, untying his coat and setting down his basket. He heard the bustling of maids and cooks in the back kitchen and his mother's heels clicking down on mahogany floors. </p><p>"Welcome home darling," she smiled, taking the basket from the table and handing it off to one of the servants. "Look at what I found up in the attic!" She pulled from behind her a white Chantilly lace ribbon. Draco's eyebrows raised as he cocked his hips. </p><p>"And what, may I ask, is that for?" </p><p>"Well, since your hair has been growing longer, I thought it would be quite pretty all tied up," she smiled, sitting Draco down and gathering his long, silken hair up into a bunch. Draco had been growing out his hair since he was a child, having it a little bit past his shoulders. Narcissa began to hum as she ran her fingers through his blonde locks, tying the ribbon into a bow in Draco's hair. "There! Nice and pretty~" she beamed as she dragged Draco to a mirror. The ribbon was in fact pretty, bringing Draco's hair upwards and showing off his features. The ribbon was, in fact, quite delicate and made of expensive materials, far too grand for anything in Draco's daily wardrobe. </p><p>"And where would I ever wear something like this?" He asked, looking at himself in the mirror and adjusting his own hair. </p><p>"Well...perhaps at the town hall tonight? I did hear a certain pair of men are moving into the neighborhood and perhaps they'll be at this certain soiree."</p><p>Draco's face blushed and he whipped around to face his mother. "Unbelievable! How did you even hear about this?? Hermione didn't tell me until this morning!" </p><p>Narcissa clapped her hands, "Come now Draco, we MUST find the perfect outfit for you!" She exclaimed as she dragged her son up to his room, regardless of Draco's whines. "Something new, preferably, and something beautiful. Perhaps your father will lend you some clothing? Well, maybe not. I mean, after all you do look better in MY clothes," she teased, ignoring Draco's growing red cheeks. "Oh how I remember when you were a little thing and would try on my petticoats and lip rouges." </p><p>"Mother, please," he whined, sitting down on his bed as his mother sifted through his closet and pulled out various garments for Draco to try on. "I was a child, after all." </p><p>"Yes, but you did look quite darling! Please, humor your mother and allow my seamstress to make you a pretty slip? Perhaps a nightgown?" Narcissa whined, clutching onto a silky white button up blouse. Draco's entire body felt inflamed and embarrassed. He proceeded to push his mother out of his room, insisting he'd find the appropriate outfit for the party. </p><p>"Please do try to look nice, Draco! There will be a multitude of eligible bachelors and I hope you catch the eye of more than one of them!" Narcissa yelled through the closed door, turning on her heel and leaving. When Draco heard the soft clattering of heels disappear, he tiredly threw himself onto his bed, whining into a pillow. It's not like he particularly wanted to go to the party. The only thing that would make it the least bit tolerable was the accompaniment of Hermione. Sure, Draco would not be opposed to the merriment of dancing and drinking libations, but he absolutely knows that his enjoyment will dissipate the minute his mother urges him to dance with random strangers. </p><p>The boy sat up in his bed and walked over to his closet, sifting through the different clothes he has. Finally deciding on a billowy satin shirt with a waistcoat and slacks that were tighter than they had to be, accentuating his doll-like waist and thin legs. Rubbing some rose oil into his soft skin and bending over to lace up his leather heeled boots. Draco began to fiddle with his clothing in the mirror, eyes glancing over to his dresser table and spotting a pot of lip rouge. His mother must have left it there on purpose and the thought made Draco roll his eyes. But, regardless, he snatched the pot into his hand and began to dab pigment onto his already pink plump lips and some on his cheekbones. Draco always did teeter on the edges of masculine and feminine, blurring the lines between the two and creating his own fashion. Draco left his room and found himself walking into his father. The man was an intimidating figure, taller than Draco by considerable inches. While Draco was a mix of his mother's soft skin, he had most definitely inherited his father's sharp bone structure. Lucius was a stoic man, one less inclined to show emotions through prose and more in actions. Upon seeing his son, Lucius' falcon-like features softened. </p><p>"Oh, Dracoâ€¦" he muttered, gazing upon his son's outfit. "You look lovely. I assume your mother did your hair?" Draco nodded, hand reaching back to playing with the ends of it. Lucius nodded and straightened himself out. "Come now, I won't have us be late." </p><p>Draco whined and trailed behind his father as his mother joined them. They piled into their carriage and the three of them drove off to town.</p>
