    <p>I was interested in writing something about this romantic trio that, although it is a little strange and not very well known, I like it... I do not know how it will come out, but I hope it looks good, haha! In my other story 'Possessive Dominant' I could not add them because the main couple is already a quartet between Harry, Lucius, Sirius and Severus and I did not want it to be an orgy ...</p><p>I can delay with my updates because I have other stories to write.</p>
