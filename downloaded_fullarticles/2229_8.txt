          <div class="userstuff"><p>The first time he saw Draco Malfoy cry<br/> was in sixth year<br/> in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.</p><p>He hasn't forgotten, not after the war and everything.<br/> It's doubtful Malfoy has either.</p><p>He remembers the sound of Malfoy's tears hitting the grimy sink,<br/> the reflection of two broken boys in the cracked mirror.<br/> He remembers the shouting, the cursing,<br/> and the deep scarlet of Malfoy's blood seeping into the rough tiles.</p><p>Blood.<br/> blood everywhere<br/> pouring from gashes created by his own hand</p><p>Snape rushing in<br/> and taking Malfoy away<br/> the guilt<br/> the pain<br/> sinking down low in the corner.</p><p> </p><p>The second time he sees Draco Malfoy cry<br/> is in the same bathroom<br/> two years later<br/> after the war.</p><p>hunched over<br/> in the same corner Harry hid in<br/> after he hurt Malfoy<br/> it can't be forgiven</p><p>shoulders shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy was named after the stars.<br/> a source of hope through the darkest hours.</p><p>For some reason, they look dull tonight.<br/> Lifeless.<br/> They don't bring the hope<br/> the shining light in the darkness<br/> that was always there when all seemed to go wrong<br/> the hope for him to depend on<br/> the light he needed<br/> To keep going.</p><p>Draco Malfoy feels empty.<br/> Like the stars.</p><p> </p><p>When the jeering<br/> taunting<br/> and stinging pain grow too much,<br/> he retreats, a film of tears<br/> no, not tears. Malfoys don't cry<br/> hovering dangerously.<br/> but bloody Potter, the savior of the Wizarding World,<br/> follows him<br/> so Draco asks him politely to <em>fuck off</em><br/> but the prick just tells him <em>no you're crying and I'm not leaving until it's-you're- okay.</em><br/> Draco says that in that case he'd better move in because it will never <em>never never be okay again.</em><br/> and Potter just smiles</p><p> </p><p>when Draco leaves the castle<br/> and heads for his tranquil spot by the lake,<br/> there is already someone there.</p><p>Potter, sitting wind-whipped and frayed, huddles there with a gleaming cloak pooled<br/> around his feet.</p><p>Draco freezes.</p><p>He could just turn around and leave, but then there would be taunting<br/> and cursing<br/> and pain<br/> and he would be reminded that he is just scum<br/> Death Eater scum</p><p>And this is the only place<br/> where he can let down his guard.<br/> so he slips in<br/> beside Potter<br/> quiet as the wind whispering through the trees.</p><p>Potter looks at him,<br/> startled<br/> but Draco keeps staring out over the moonwashed lake<br/> tasting the salty tears<br/> flecking his chapped lips.</p><p>and after a while,<br/> feels the comforting warmth of Potter's hand<br/> slip over his.</p><p>Tonight<br/> Harry needs somewhere to escape to.<br/> Somewhere calm<br/> away from the awe<br/> the hatred<br/> disbelief<br/> and he especially hates the ones<br/> that look at him like they don't believe<br/> and don't know how to feel</p><p>so he finds a spot next to the lake<br/> in the bitter cold<br/> But frostbite<br/> is better than hundreds<br/> of staring eyes.</p><p>and he doesn't know how long he's been there<br/> when Malfoy sits down by his side.</p><p>He wants to move away<br/> but he needs this right now<br/> right here.</p><p>and he can see Malfoy's eyes gleaming bright with tears<br/> that he doesn't think are a trick of the moonlight</p><p>so he stays.<br/> And so does Draco.</p><p> </p><p>they don't see each other often.<br/> a few stolen hours between classes<br/> but it's enough for Draco<br/> to stay.</p><p> </p><p>in other times<br/> when he passes the others in the hallway<br/> the ones who used to be his friends<br/> their eyes burn with hatred for<br/> the Death Eater<br/> the murderer<br/> (<em>murderer murderer murderer)</em><br/> the destroyer of dreams.<br/> but some pass by<br/> like they haven't seen him at all<br/> and that's what terrifies Draco the most<br/> being invisible.</p><p> </p><p>Draco used to think<br/> the stars,<br/> separated so far from the planets,<br/> were lonely<br/> but at least<br/> they had each other.</p><p>now he knows that they are millions and millions of miles apart<br/> and maybe<br/> just maybe</p><p>Draco Malfoy is alone too.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn't see Draco in the morning.<br/> so he stays with Ron and Hermione<br/> who have changed.</p><p>Ron is furious with the war<br/> that took away his brother<br/> that tore apart<br/> and put back together<br/> his family<br/> with one piece missing<br/> and he is a little broken too.</p><p>Hermione is crumbling<br/> still standing tall<br/> and proud<br/> but her parents still don't know they have a daughter<br/> and she thinks that if they can be happy without her<br/> then maybe she isn't important after all.</p><p> </p><p>and when he sees Draco Malfoy cry for the second time<br/> he is frozen.<br/> the one who always had it all together<br/> always there,<br/> with a sarcastic comment to cap it off.<br/> sobbing in an abandoned bathroom</p><p>so he sits beside Malfoy<br/> puts an arm around his shoulders<br/> and feels him flinch under Harry's touch.<br/> but he stays.</p><p>Slowly</p><p>they are reclaiming lost time.</p><p>second by second</p><p>minute by minute</p><p>hour by hour</p><p>day after day</p><p>lifetime after lifetime<br/> the ex-Death Eater and the Saviour.<br/> but no one disagrees because<br/> they make each other so happy.</p><p>and one day, Harry says<br/> I love you<br/> for the first time.</p><p>and Draco stops.<br/> looks at him</p><p>and smiles bright bright bright<br/> like the stars.</p></div>
