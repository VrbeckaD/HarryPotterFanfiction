    <p>People often say that "Girls possess diaries while Boys keep journals." Both are basically synonymous with its functionality, it's where you can write down and share your personal experiences and thoughts each day. You may find this ridiculously childish but the weight of each private reflections put into words is simply <em>heavy.</em> So when Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World and the Boy Who Lived Twice, decided to keep a journal… well, let's just say that the title is enough of a warning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Journal</strong>: <strong><em>Harry James Potter</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>July 1</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><div>
  <p>I had a relaxing morning; a cuppa under a stasis charm on the right side of my table and a handful of reports on the left. <del>What</del> who set this lovely mood? Let's just say that I bumped into the notorious ice prince on my way to DMLE while he was exiting the building. He just handed in his report regarding the Death-Eater Butcher Case aka the D.E.B Case. The <del>exquisite</del> handsome former Slytherin was wearing his lime green St. Mungo's Mediwizard robes. My mouth watered. Damn. And here I was, looking forward to the meeting where I can shamelessly look at his alluring face and listen to his recent findings (sort of).</p>
  <p>I hope I don't look flustered while admiring his mesmerizing grey eyes, white-blond hair which I'm sure is as soft as unicorn tufts and lustrous pale skin. Tell you what, I'm even doubting the records regarding their family history. I have this gut feeling that their blood is not as pure as he believed. Undoubtedly, Veela heritage, with his ethereal beauty and all. I mean, how can I explain the sweetness of the air whenever he is around? He is figuratively the male version of Aphrodite with amortentia as his body scent. I bet only a few noticed that adorable single freckle on his lower lip. He used to bite that gorgeous dot (unconsciously, I presume) whenever he is in deep thought or confuse or (as my vicious imagination provides) <del><em>stimulated</em></del><em> </em>excited.</p>
  <p>Anyways… How do I know these, you ask? Sadly, I knew these things when I started <del>obsessing</del> observing him back in 6th year when I was assuming that he is up to something bad and guess what? I was right! Ha! Take that Hermione! Anyhow, back to the blond wet dream, I gave him my most handsome smile and greeted "<em>Good morning Malfoy, how are you today?"</em> And <em>Merlin's balls</em> journal, his smile (regardless of how brief) made my heart leap! I think I heard an explanation about being needed in an emergency meeting at St. Mungo's somewhere along my day dreaming.</p>
  <p><em>"Sorry Potter, I promise I'll be there on our next joint meeting."</em> He said apologetically. I know he's a busy man journal, and I'm happy as it is that I get to see him and talk to him without incurring any wrath. I love being on the receiving end of those small smiles. My best friends used to tease me that I fancy the git, well I don't!</p>
  <p>Alright, fine! You stupid judgmental journal. I just don't <em>fancy</em> the wanker, I'm practically head over heels to him.</p>
  <p>
    <em>Merlin help me!</em>

  <p>I'm seriously considering the possibility of dying an early age due to stress. Majority thinks that being Head Auror in my 20's makes me a genius. Well journal, I AM NOT. It's been 4 months already since this case started. Four bloody months' worth of frustration of not being able to close this. One victim per month, one portion of their body missing, while the rest was butchered beyond recognition. This gruesome way of killing was to hide the juicy details from civilian eyes.</p>
  <p>The victims were all male, around their early 20's, and all were distant relatives of a former Death Eater. None of them took the dark mark but their family background screamed pure blood supremacist. According to the latest report submitted by St. Mungo's DMLE Aid Division (led by <del>my</del> Draco of course, yes journal, <em>Draco</em>, oh sue me!), two victims were raped before they were killed. Their rectums were utterly destroyed, probably inserted with a large metallic object and no traces of semen found inside nor outside.</p>
  <p>The victims' bodies were cleaned from any fingerprints, saliva, hair or blood aside from their own. There's also no drug found in their system, either they went willingly with the killer or <span>Imperioed</span>. Remembering the scene from when we found the first victim still makes me nauseous. There was only his head, his fucking <em>head,</em> bathed with his own blood and internal organs. All organs were bloody complete journal, it seems like the killer only fancied his body and rejected everything else. The second scene was a blood bath, literally. Apparently, the killer liked his hair as it was meticulously removed from the victim's head before making a total mess of his poor body.</p>
  <p>The latest one, I'm afraid, might be the prettiest of them all since his head was taken. The victim's body was present along with his rejected hair and eyes<em>.</em> Now journal, this is the icing of the cake, our killer here has been collecting and assembling a whole new body, fucking <em>sick pervert!</em> There will be another victim this month, he is almost done and only one part is missing, the <em>eyes.</em> This is our last shot in capturing the maniac. Great. The problem with the victims are, they party a <em>lot</em> (the upside of being young and wealthy)<em>.</em></p>
  <p>These social butterflies went to different bars and lands a good lay almost every night. The list of the names of their one night stand partners is un-fucking-believable and we are not even done! Fuck! I need a good shag myself. Well journal, which picture of my lovely blond shall I use tonight?</p>

  <p>Dear Journal, I'm starting to doubt myself. I think Professor Dumbledore was wrong about me being noble and good. This afternoon while I was at St. Mungo's (for official business, I swear journal), my vision almost went black. I saw Draco with Cormac McLaggen outside his office. The <em>fucker</em> was all smiles while adjusting his sleeves and showing off his pathetic muscles. <em>"Bloody dragons I tell you Draco, but I'm not lying here that I've landed a treasure trove for having you personally heal me."</em> He told Draco with playful eyes.</p>
  <p>And the <em>shithead</em> had the fucking guts to touch Draco's soft-looking cheeks! <em>"Sod off Cormac, your cheesy lines are over the top!" </em>Draco replied. But he should be delivering it with a hard voice and stormy eyes, not with a flirty smirk! When did this happen journal? Was it because I was too busy with the D.E.B. case that I didn't see the <em>pest</em> lurking around him? I'm pretty sure Draco is busy too, being a Mediwizard at St. Mungo's and the head of their DMLE Aid Division. He can NOT have a romance inserted in between!</p>
  <p><em>"Malfoy! There you are! I've been looking for you- oh! Hi Cormac. What're you doing here? Where's Charlie?"</em> I gave Draco a sweet small smile then focused my cold stare to the intruding dragon tamer. But the wanker had too much self-confidence and very little self-preservation when he totally ignored my scrutinizing gaze. <em>"Hello Harry, Charlie's at the Burrow visiting his parents and I needed my monthly checkup with the renowned miracle worker here. My body needs to be in excellent condition with my kind of job after all."</em></p>
  <p>And for Salazar's sake journal, I grasp that very thin rope of control that I have so I won't land my <em>noble</em> arse in Azkaban that very same day. <em>"Oh Merlin! Cormac! A little decency, yeah? Off with you now! You are 100% healthy, dragon tamer."</em> I mentally groaned when I heard Draco chuckle at McLaggen's shameless flirtations, that should only be given to me journal, to ME!</p>
  <p><em>"Alright Draco, you're the boss. See you around Harry."</em> And journal, I kid you not, the disgusting twat winked, <em>WINKED</em>, at Draco before leaving. If the angelic blond wasn't able to get my attention right after, I might have reduced McLaggen's health to 10%. <em>"Hello Potter, come inside and have a cuppa. Is this about the case?"</em> I only managed a nod at that time before I gave McLaggen's retreating back a murderous look.</p>
  <p>
    <em>Merlin save him.</em>

  <p>Hello journal, wait… Why am I even greeting you, you non-living piece of parchment? This is funny. And… Speaking of something funny, I had this weird dream that I wanted to share to you. I dreamt about Draco. I know that it's nothing new but this isn't just the usual senselessly hot and sexy shagging session. In the dream, I was stalking Draco to his house. When he opened the door, he called me out. My name sounded like sweet sin from his luscious lips. <em>"Harry, you really like this stalking role-play so much. Come out now love."</em></p>
  <p>I let out a growl and pushed him inside. I attacked his lips vigorously. And his <em>moans</em> journal, I can't even describe how wanton he sounded under my touch. I think I lost my focus for a moment because I vaguely heard him ask me a question. <em>"Uh… What?"</em> Then, with an annoyed sigh he asked me again. <em>"Have you found him yet?"</em> I replied, <em>"Excuse me?"</em> I think Draco was really pissed off with my inattentiveness because he pushed me back a bit forcefully. <em>"I swear to Salazar that I'm going to hex your balls off! How long do I have to wait for the freaking eyes,</em> <em><strong>Potter</strong></em><em>?"</em></p>
  <p>I was honestly confused journal. What do we need the eyes for? <em>"Love, listen to me. If I don't get those eyes before your birthday, I promise to Merlin that it's my fucking eyes you'll see in the ritual table."</em> After hearing that from him journal, I felt immense fear for the first time. A fear so great that it even surpassed the time when I was walking to my own death in the forbidden forest. I felt helpless journal, I hate it! I remembered grabbing his shoulders with a fierce grip. I looked at him pleadingly and conveyed my desperation through my gaze.</p>
  <p><em>"Please Draco, love of my life, I'll do whatever you wish. I will kill for you, I will die for you! Just don't… Don't do anything dangerous. I don't EVER want to see even a strand of your hair harmed."</em> And journal, when he kissed me after my heartfelt pledge, I was relieved. I hugged him journal. And if I can, I want to keep him inside me where he will be forever safe. And do you want to know what's the funny part of this dream, huh journal? I stand by my promise whether it's to dream-Draco or real-Draco. Do you hear me Voldemort? I will likely see in you hell.</p>
  <p> </p>

  </p>
  <p>Journal… Do you think Hermione is just being an over-the-top mother hen? Before coming home I decided to catch up with the happy couple at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour. Why there? The soon-to-be mother was craving a Caramel Turtle Fudge (caramel based ice cream with roasted turtle-shaped pecans and apple swirl fudge), not an unusual choice, <em>thank Godric!</em> Anyways, she "advised" me to go see a healer because I looked more stressed than my normal Head Auror stressed-face.</p>
  <p>I admit that my last dream was a bit bizarre but that doesn't mean that it was the reason of my fatigue. Well alright, <em>aside</em> from that, the D.E.B case is also driving me nuts. The Ministry is demanding, quite strongly I must say, that we solve this or else. But enough with this emo-ish (it's a muggle thing) prattle. I really am happy for my two best friends. After all those years of constant bickering at one another, they finally became honest with their feelings then snogged each other to death. Ugh. Not a good mental image.</p>
  <p>Anyhow… There was the obvious emotional and sexual tension in the air whenever those two argue. Heh. Sounds familiar? By the way journal, Ron's been thinking about requesting an early paternity leave but we insisted that it's still early for him to do that. Besides, this is an important season for the Chudley Cannons, they can not afford not having their best beater. This is the League Cup we're talking about journal! Moreover, Ginny's Holyhead Harpies is not behind the game this time. She's become a really good seeker over the years, well of course I know about that. She learned from the best after all.</p>
  <p>And I'm not being smug about it journal, I'm just stating a fact. Oh! And I almost forgot to mention that there's an amount of galleons (definitely not small) involved between the siblings' rivalry. May the best Weasley wins. I pray to Merlin that Hermione won't find us out. Only Godric knows the horrors we'll face if she knew about this, being Head of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures simply means that she is formidable or just plain <em>scary…</em> You know what journal? I guess I'll schedule for a healer's appointment later.</p>
  <p> </p>

    <em> <strong>July 6</strong> </em>
  </p>
  <p>Dearest journal, old pal. What a lovely day it was! Do you want to know why? Because… I get to share Draco's personal space for more than twenty minutes! Well, 21 minutes to be exact. I bumped into him at Sugarplum's Sweet Shop while on an errand, I should buy Hermione additional boxes of Bertie Bott's and Cauldron Cakes. Godric, I love her and her cravings! So, the apple of my eyes, my elusive golden snitch and just basically the center of my universe, is buying himself a big stock of Pumpkin Pasties.</p>
  <p>I mean what are the odds, right? I'm thinking that there's a greater power here. A subtle sign, perhaps from Merlin himself, that we obviously belong to each other. We're the homosexual equivalent of Ron and Mione here. We will also be happy just like my best friends and stand the test of time. I just need to ironed out first our relationship after solving the D.E.B case of course. You know how it works journal, I've got to impress my future life partner first, since I want him to be proud of me too, as I am to him.</p>
  <p><em>"So Potter, is being an errand boy a part-time job of a Head Auror?"</em> And how I loved his teasing smirk, journal. All wits with no bites. <em>"Nah, it's just my savior senses kicking in, Draco. And yes Draco, you should also start calling me by my first name."</em> Although he gave me a blank expression, yet his spell-binding grey eyes twinkled with amusement. <em>"Give me one good reason… Potter."</em> I arched my eyebrow, and without breaking eye contact, gave him a playful smile. <em>"Scared Draco?"</em> And journal, the moment I've been waiting for quite some time now finally happened. <em>"You wish Harry."</em></p>
  <p>Smooth right? I'm getting the hang of this already! It was such a marvelous day for me because I just had a wonderful break in my personal oasis called Draco Malfoy. For the mean time, I forgot the long line towards the counter, the annoying fans who are insensitive about my need for privacy and best of all, he relieved my stress from the D.E.B case. I just learned today that aside from having a sweet tooth, he consumes a LOT of Pumpkin Pasties to relieve his own stress. That he gives Liquorice Wands to brave children who didn't cry during checkups.</p>
  <p>And when he is wasted, he mentioned that he loves sucking a Blood-flavoured lollipop till his vision stops spinning. Oh yes… In my opinion journal, if Draco happens to ask me for a lollipop when we're both drunk after a wild party, I'll be surely giving him a good 10 inches long "lollipop", its girth more than wide enough to stretch those pink lips, and definitely with <em>blood</em> pumping in its veins and a tangy flavored syrup on <del>its slit</del> top.</p>
  <p><em>Merlin yes!</em> Draco better suck this lollipop real good because this is made for him, only FOR HIM. Fuck… I hate to tell you this journal but I need to cut this short, I'm now a few strokes away from exploding. Although, great to have you journal. Great to always have you.</p>
