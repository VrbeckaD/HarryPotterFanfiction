<p>“Harry?”<br/> <br/> “Hmmm…”<br/> <br/> “Do you know how beautiful you are?”<br/> <br/> “Of course not. You only tell me that about ten times every day,” I say as I run my fingers through my husband’s hair. I love the feel of that soft, silvery hair on my fingers. You’d think I’d be over it by now. I mean we’ve been together twenty years. But no. I’m still every bit as fascinated with Draco as I used to be. <br/> <br/> “God! I love your hair,” I whisper as I lean forward and kiss him. It is a soft, slow kiss that leads to another and then another…He pulls me on top of his body and holds me close. <br/> <br/> It’s a lazy Saturday afternoon, the perfect time for slow kisses, hungry touches and tender love making. Twenty years together and I still can’t get enough of this man. And thankfully, he can’t get enough of me either. <br/> <br/> He rolls us over so he’s on top, covering my body as his long, silver-blonde hair falls like a curtain around my face and he thinks I’m beautiful?<br/> <br/> “You are so stupidly gorgeous, Draco,” I say and he smirks. But that expression is momentary, replaced swiftly by adoration, devotion and the kind of reverence that makes my breath catch every time I see it, which, lucky me, is pretty much every time he looks at me. <br/> <br/> “I love you, Harry,” he whispers as he trails kisses down my neck. “So damn much.”<br/> <br/> “I love you too,” I say as he makes his way down my body and I lose all ability to think for a while. After twenty years, he knows exactly where to touch me and how to make me crazy.<br/> <br/> We lie in bed after, sweaty, rumpled and very sated…just holding each other close. Draco’s looking at me like I’m the most amazing thing he’s ever seen. <br/> <br/> “Thank you, love,” he says.<br/> <br/> “What for?”</p>
<p><br/> “For saying yes when I asked you out all those years ago, for kissing me after…for staying with me even though your friends disapproved. For asking me to marry you.”<br/> <br/> “Best thing I ever did,” I say as I raise my head to kiss him. “Happy anniversary, Draco.”</p>
