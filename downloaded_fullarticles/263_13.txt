    <p>The Artifact</p><p>I do not own anything of the Harry Potter Universe the only thing I claim is the events of this story which came from my own twisted mind.</p><p>"Ah Minister just let me send Harry back to Hogwarts than I shall give you no more than twenty minutes," Dumbledore said the twinkle in his eyes as he cast a portkey charm on the disembodied head from the wizard statue to send Harry right back to his office. Harry vanishes in a flash but as Dumbledore turns to Fudge he lifts an eyebrow when he does not sense the boy arrive in his office. Thinking it just might do with Umbridge being in his school Dumbledore put thoughts of the boy out of his head so he could tell Fudge his plans for stopping Voldemort. A little less than fifteen minutes late Dumbledore found himself back in the Headmaster's office expecting Harry to be trying to get out of the room, but to his shock the boy... his weapon was no where to be seen.</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt the jerk around his navel as the portkey whisked him away from the Ministry of Magic and the Department of Mysteris where Siruis had died barely ten minutes before. When he landed rather than finding himself at Hogwarts Harry found himself standing in a large cave like room.</p><p>"Ah Mr. Potter we have been expecting you," a Goblin said as he walked into the room.</p><p>"Griphook?" Harry asked knowing only one actual Goblin by name.</p><p>"Yes, very good Mr. Potter you are here to take the Linage test I see," Griphook said as he held up a pad. "... Now that is strange according to our records you have neither responded to any of our summoning or have taken an inheritance test in the first place," Griphook said looking over his notes and giving Harry a look as in question.</p><p>"What summoning I have never received any mail from Gringotts that I know of," Harry said.</p><p>"Now that is strange," Griphook said "never received he said. Anyway according to a note we received you have called for Linage test."</p><p>"I did?" Harry asked confused.</p><p>"Yes according to our records you activated some sort of artifact that called for the test, this artifact also makes it so if one was to travel by magic it would redirect you right to Gringotts," Griphook said before pointing to Harry pocket where a slight green glow was seen. Harry reaches in to the pocket and pulls out a small white piece of parchment with a red and black embodied but otherwise blank. Harry only had the parchment when he had accidentally bumped against what looked like a small black muggle copy machine deep in the Department of Mysteries. Thinking the parchment was somehow important Harry had grabbed it and received a small shock. "Well as you have never had an inheritance test I will inform you that unlike that test the Linage test will only inform you of who your parents are," Griphook explained.</p><p>"But everyone knows who my parents are Lily and James Potter," Harry said.</p><p>"Ah but if that was true you would never have been able to collect that if that was actually true," Griphook said as he set down his clipboard and held out a silver knife. "Just prick your finger and drop the blood on that parchment if you will," Griphook said. Harry just shrugged and did as instructed. As soon as the blood hit the white parchment words began to form. When they finished Harry read the page only to throw it on the ground in shock. Looking down Griphook read the parchment his own face falling in fear.</p><p><strong>Name</strong>: <em>Harrison Eugene Potter-Prince-Riddle</em></p><p><strong>Parents</strong>:</p><ul>
<li><em>James Potter (Bearer) (dead)</em></li>
<li><em>Severus Snape-Prince</em></li>
<li><em>Tom Riddle</em></li>
<li><em>Lily Evens- Blood Adoption illegal (dead)</em></li>
</ul><p>"The... the... Prophecy it can't be true," Griphook said gripping his chest with one hand as he used the other to steady himself against the wall.</p><p>"Prophecy?" Harry asked thinking to the glass orb that had shattered in the room where Sirius had died.</p><p>"Only two people had ever heard of it your bearer and one of your fathers but from what had been shared it involved someone being heir from family of Light, Dark, and Neutral coming to save the world but it is to late to do anything with now." Griphook choked out. "There is no other choice only one chance you will need to fix this Harrison," Griphook said getting his voice back and gesturing Harry to follow him. Wondering what was going on Harry just shrugged and followed him. Griphook lead him down a hallway and into a room that had a large runic circle on both the floor and ceiling. Clapping his hands Griphook called out," Silverwing."</p><p>A Goblin walked in but rather than dressed in what Harry was used to seeing Silverwing word a teal and orange gown that reminded him of surgical gear a doctor would wear. "What is is Griphook?" Silverwing asked in a low melodious voice.</p><p>"I call for use of temporal mind shift," Griphook said crossing an arm across his body in some sort of ritual sign Harry assumed.</p><p>"That is a rather important call to make and what are your reasons for the call?" Silverwing asked seeming to glide over to the pair.</p><p>"The Prophecy of the Triad," Griphook said and whatever Silverwing thought he was going to say this was not it as their mouth fell open in shock. Griphook than handed over the parchment with Harry's Linage test on it. After a moment of study and a quick look to Harry Silverwing nodded.</p><p>"Stand in the middle of the circle Harrison," Silverwing ordered as she handed him the parchment back. "DO NOT LET THAT GO," she called as Harry got ready to get rid of it. "To protect the world Griphook is right you will need to undergo a temporal mind shift this will send your mind as it is now back to a time where you can actually make a difference and thus save the world." Silverwing said as waved a hand and more teal and orange clad Goblins came in and began to weave spells in the air around the room. "You seem to have some seals and magic on you my boy we will take them off for a small amount of time but you need to get back to Gringotts and get an inheritance test to further understand it when you arrive now good luck," Silverwing said as with a final wave of her hand the magic of the room build up and Harry found himself feeling as if he was sliding backwards rather fast as if he was using a time turner.</p><p>When the feeling stopped he found himself back in the cupboard back at the Dursley's and somehow knew he was no longer fifteen years old but was somewhere around ten year old. Harry's mind was still filled with the years he had spent at Hogwarts. For a moment his mind was at war with itself his ten year old self thinking it had all been a dream. That is until he looked down and saw the parchment with his Linage test still on it. As he laid eyes on it Harry felt as if his body was being shoved through a straw and he left the cupboard behind. Once more Harry found himself transported this time landed in front of a door of a old dingy house. Feeling a need to knock on the door Harry followed through and waited.</p><p>Inside the knock disturbed the only inhabitant of the house who was confused as his neighbors being muggles would never call thanks to muggle repealing charms on it and his "friends" were not really ones that came to call. Rubbing the bridge of his nose as another knock came he stood up and walked to the door. Opening it up Severus Snape looked down at a small child with messy brown hair and a pair of horn rimmed glasses rasing his left eyebrow in a sneer. Before he could ask the brat what he was doing there the kid look up at him a strange look on his face before a smile came to the small cherub features and he ran forward calling "Papa" and hugged Snape.</p><p>"What?" Snape called as he tried to pull the brat off him "I have no child let go," Snape huffed as he finally got the brat to let him go making the kid drop a small piece of parchment fall to the ground. The kid fell on his bottom and lip began to quiver a little. Severus rubbed his forehead he did not need this and knelt down to find out why this kid thought he was his dad, but as he knelt down his eyes fell on the parchment. Quickly reading it the color drained from Severus already pale face. "Gringotts," Severus said to himself as he pocketed the parchment and grab the boy's hand before apperating to the Goblin bank.</p><p>Arriving at the bank Severus dragged the boy inside and waited in line for a bit trying to ignore the boy's sniffling as the kid held on tight to Severous' robes as if afraid to let go of them. Harry was scared why had he acted like that to his dour Potions Master, sure at this time of his life he had not actually meet the man but to call him Papa and give him a hug that had been strange the man hated him which was clear when he was pushed harshly away from the man yet after seeing the test results Snape had brought them to Gringotts.</p><p>"Ah Lord Snape how may I help you to day?" a Goblin asked when Severus and Harry arrived at the counter.</p><p>"I would like to order an inheritance test for myself and this boy at once Fangtooth," Severus said.</p><p>"At once Lord Snape follow me, "Fangtooth said getting down from his stool and going to a corridor behind his desk leading the man and boy into a small room. "You recall the procedure correct?" Fangtooth said with a customary Goblin sneer.</p><p>"Of course," Severus said as he took the offered blade and pricked his finger and let eight drops of blood to fall on the offered parchment to get the most complete information for the test before doing the same to the boy.</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> <em> Severus Tobius Snape-Prince</em></p><p><strong>Parents</strong>:</p><ul>
