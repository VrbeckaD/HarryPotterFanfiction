          <div class="userstuff"><p align="center">i.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, the pureblood world isn’t particularly large. Grand, yes; opulent, sure (the old families – the wealthy ones, at least – like to maintain the elite façade of bygone years), but when it comes down to bloodlines almost all the family trees are just intertwined branches of a single oak. The Malfoys are related to the Weasley and Longbottom families both, as well as the Blacks, Flints, Macmillans and Greengrasses, among others.</p><p>Oliver Wood knows this intimately given how his own family history weaves among them. It takes more than two hands to count all the students at Hogwarts he is related to by either blood or marriage. They might be Scottish, pro-muggle campaigners, but the Woods are old money and, as such, each summer is spent attending debutante balls, birthdays and wakes – what his mother likes to call ‘the gatherings’.</p><p>These events are why he hates Marcus Flint with such an unflinching passion, and how he knows Daphne Greengrass so well, despite being five years her senior and a Gryffindor to boot.</p><p align="center">ii.</p><p>The year Daphne is due to start at Hogwarts her uncle marries Oliver’s second cousin, and neither Daphne nor Oliver are attending the happy event with any great level of enthusiasm. Bryn Greengrass is an old man, and Cecilia is barely twenty-five, and everybody knows that she married him for his money. Nobody has said as much out loud, but the wind seems to carry the whisper regardless.</p><p>Daphne is trying to steal a glass of champagne purely because her father forbade her from drinking any, and Oliver watches in amusement when, having finally snagged an abandoned flute, she stealthily sips and immediately gags and spits the liquid back out into the glass. It’s clearly not to her taste.</p><p>He approaches with a smile on his face. “Apparently it grows on you,” he tells the young girl.</p><p>She looks unconvinced and forsakes the drink, leaving it on the table behind her. “It’s <em>awful</em>.” Turning back to him, she looks him up and down. “You’re a Wood, right?”</p><p>He nods. “Oliver. Ceci’s my cousin.”</p><p>Daphne looks over at the curly-haired brunette who has just joined her family line. She’s laughing pleasantly with a few of her new husband’s associates, playing the pretty, young wife to perfection already.  “She’s a bit of a galleon-digger, isn’t she?” Daphne announces casually.</p><p>Oliver laughs at her forwardness. “Well, yes, but you’re not supposed to say it out loud… Greengrass, is it?” he guesses. “You’ve got to be a Greengrass with that hair.”</p><p>She wrinkles her nose, drawing a handful of pale, gold hair forward to be observed. “Can’t hide it. It makes us almost as obvious as the Malfoys.” She politely offers her hand for him to shake. “I’m Daphne. Dad is Uncle Bryn’s younger brother.”</p><p>The dancing begins then (old aunts and youngsters alike join the bridal party on the dance floor) and Oliver asks after a moment’s pause, “So, what were you doing nicking drinks off the old hags?”</p><p>The happy couple first take to the dance floor alone, watched intently by the audience.</p><p>“Dad banned me from having any wine or alcohol.”</p><p>“Fair enough. You’re what, ten?”</p><p>“I’m almost twelve!” she exclaims. “I’ll start at Hogwarts in September.”</p><p>“I thought most of your family attended Beauxbatons,” Oliver comments, surprised. He’s sure he’s heard that before, but he can’t remember for sure.</p><p>“Usually, but mum went Hogwarts and she made the call.”</p><p>She must be a fierce woman, Oliver thinks privately. Oberon Greengrass is an unforgiving man in most circumstances. He owns the Falmouth Falcons and under his management the team’s taken more successive League Championships than any other in history. They’ve also collated the greatest number of fouls in a season (three times and counting), which goes some way to suggesting the nature of the man, and his values, too. His wife must be a force to be reckoned with if she has him so securely under her thumb.</p><p>Oliver and Daphne spend the rest of the wedding reception talking about Quidditch (laughing at how different their opinions are on what constitutes a ‘good’ team) and generally having a much more enjoyable time than either could previously have hoped for, and when Oliver promises to keep an eye out for her at King’s Cross on September first Daphne smiles widely. They’ll see each other before that date, what with the seventeenth birthdays coming up in the Corner, Flint and Baddock families, but it still makes her happy to know there’ll be at least one more friendly face in the crowd on her first day at Hogwarts.</p><p align="center">iii.</p><p>The look on Oliver’s face when the Hat cries out <em>Slytherin</em> is priceless. Daphne Greengrass shrugs wryly at him and skips off to join her new housemates, knowing that he’s entirely devastated by this reveal but finding it difficult to summon the energy to care because she knows this is the house for her.</p><p>Her first encounter with him since the train ride is on the staircase in the Entrance Hall on the first day of classes. She steps in front of him, halting his descent when he avoids looking at her.</p><p>“I hope my sorting won’t stop you talking to me,” she comments, hitting the nail on the head. Oliver’s gaze flickers away in embarrassment. “Because that’s stupid.”</p><p>“I just-” Oliver hesitates. “I didn’t expect it.”</p><p>“Really?” she says. “I did. But I suppose I know myself better than you know me.”</p><p>“I guess so.”</p><p>She smiles briefly. “Just because I’ve got a green crest doesn’t mean we can’t be friends,” she informs him blithely and he scoffs, causing her expression to mutate into a glare.</p><p>“Tell me that in a couple of months,” he replies.</p><p>She’s taken it as a challenge, he can tell, and when she leans forward and says, “<em>Fine</em>,” in a thin, icy voice, he sort-of understands why the Hat was right to place her in Slytherin. But then she smiles at him and the moment passes. She sings her goodbyes and darts past him, hurrying off to Transfiguration.</p><p>They don’t see each other very often, for all they’re trapped inside the same walls; the castle is a maze of staircases and corridors and Oliver has discovered that fifth year homework is related in some way to the hydra (every time an essay is finished, three more materialise in front of him), but when they do cross paths the easy friendship of summer returns. They regularly disagree about Quidditch and Oliver occasionally brings her sweets back from Hogsmeade. Her housemates, if they disapprove, don’t say much about her friendship with the Gryffindor captain – not after she sends a third year to the hospital wing for an ill-advised comment within her hearing.</p><p align="center">iv.</p><p>Oliver leaves Hogwarts at the end of Daphne’s third year. She misses him terribly. He’s happy, she knows; he’s playing for Puddlemere United on a rookie contract that arrived the day he finished his exams.</p><p>When she sees a lovely little barn owl fly towards her at breakfast halfway through the term she assumes it’s for the second-year beside her. When the mail is dropped on her lap, she realises with glee that it’s a letter from Oliver.</p><p><em>I haven’t forgotten about you, despite all the training and excitement, </em>Oliver writes. <em>I’ll write when I can and expect you to do the same. PS: I hope Slytherin lose the Quidditch Cup!</em></p><p>She follows his stats and games in the Prophet and writes to him frequently. <em>Make sure your ‘people’ know I’m not a groupie</em>, she tells him. <em>Can’t have my important and extremely valuable correspondence withheld. Someone’s got to tell you when to stop drowning yourself in the showers.</em></p><p align="center">v.</p><p>
  <em>Oliver, thank whatever god(s) you pray to that you left last year - they’ve cancelled Quidditch due to some stupid inter-school tournament! People are losing their minds - yours would’ve exploded for sure. Have fun playing the Falcons on Saturday. Kilkenny is going to score on your left hoop. I put money on it. Yours, etc. Daphne</em>

  <em>Dear Daphne – hope you didn’t waste too many galleons on Kilkenny last week. How he hasn’t been relegated to reserve grade bewilders me. Shocked to hear about Quidditch this year – luckily, I’ll get to play regardless (and get paid for it). Oliver</em>

</p><p>
  <em>Don’t fret over my pockets, Oliver, just thank me for pointing out your weak spot. I know you spent all week making sure you were protecting the left after I wrote you last! Kilkenny is practically an heirloom at this point, so no relegation for him. Daphne. PS: Fourth Year Arithmancy is the worst! </em>

  <em>Hey Oliver, get out of the shower. Titania has instructions to bite you where it hurts if you don’t pull your head in. D</em>

</p><p>
  <em>Dear Daphne, your bird is vicious. I wasn’t even in the shower when she arrived (one loss doesn’t put us out of contention – see, I’m learning), but she really took your instructions to heart. Just grateful towels are plush enough to prevent real damage. Thanks for caring, but please don’t send Titania after me again. I do want kids someday. Yours, Oliver</em>

  <em>Oliver – this Umbridge lady is an actual psycho. Her office is horrendous. Cats and doilies… it’s like Great-Aunt Josephine’s house, except this lady is somehow (?!) considered fit to teach students. What is happening to this school? </em>
</p><p align="center">

  <em> Dear Daphne, funny you mention him - Professor Slughorn taught my parents at Hogwarts. Apparently he used to host parties – social networking – throughout the school year. You’re bound to get an invite if he likes Quidditch, given your dad. Have fun hobnobbing – he used to serve alcohol, even to students but I doubt McGonagall will approve of that. Butterbeer for you. Oliver. PS: How was our game against the Harpies – nailbiter and ten points in it! Could almost have swallowed a loss, but exceedingly glad we didn’t have to.</em>

  <em>Hi Oliver, guess who’s a newly minted member of the ‘Slug Club’ (what a name – vomit). But I’m keen to start reaping the benefits, so Slug Club it is. So far, it’s just meant old Sluggy singles me out in class/hallways, but the first soiree is due in a few weeks. Gwenog Jones is rumoured to be on the guest list. I’m going to get all the goss on you from your opponents’ perspectives. Do you think I should wear the blue dress or the silver one from the Abbott wedding last Summer?</em>

  <em>Oliver, you won't be hearing from me much. Don’t do anything stupid this year, please.</em>

  <em>Trust me. Be safe, Daphne.</em>
</p><p align="center">vi.</p><p>Oliver has nightmares about the battle of Hogwarts for months. He arrived in the second wave, to destruction and chaos, and no sign of Daphne or her sister. The students were evacuated, he’s told. But nobody seems to know where they were sent.</p><p>The fear and elation at Harry’s remarkable recovery is like an internal roar, switching gears as the Boy Who Lived miraculously defeats his foe, but beneath it all is worry for a smart-mouthed blonde in Slytherin colours.</p><p>Finally, word gets out that all evacuated students (not including those who defied orders and returned) are safe and accounted for in the basements of Hogsmeade. He hears from the grapevine that the Greengrass family have collected their children and bailed out to their country seat. He doesn’t see Daphne for two weeks.</p><p>She sends Titania to him the day after the funerals, a note to meet her in Hogsmeade in those sharp, golden claws.</p><p>Oliver can’t help wrapping her in a hug as soon as he sees her. She still looks perfect, as if the events of the last year have slid off her like water from a duck’s back. He knows it’s not true; she copes by showing a veneer, as though by faking that everything is fine, she can trick herself into thinking it will be. He knows her too well to be fooled.</p><p> “You’ll never guess,” she says blankly as they step apart, “who dad’s chosen.”</p><p>Oliver can’t believe his ears. Daphne has been writing to him all year about how her dad’s been looking at suitors and planning to match her up with some wealthy idiot. Arranged marriages are decreasing in popularity, but they aren’t uncommon yet in the old families. The fact that the battle has done nothing to stem the inexorable push for wedded bliss for his firstborn is astonishing, and yet entirely in character for the Falcon’s owner. He’s probably considered Harry Potter himself as an option, favouring Slytherins be damned – money speaks louder. Oliver has a queasy thought at that.</p><p>“It’s not Malfoy, is it?”</p><p>The little shit’s somehow managed to avoid Azkaban, alongside his mother – Harry even took the stand to vouch for them, which is impressive given the history between him and Malfoy. Lucius wasn’t so lucky; from the photos in the Prophet, Oliver doesn’t think he’ll live to see his release date. But they’ve still got a ton of money and plenty to sell on top of it to keep up appearances.</p><p>“Ha. If <em>only</em>,” she says humourlessly. “No, dad’s left that slice of heaven for Astoria. I’m too old for him anyway, they like the Malfoy women to be younger. Presumably so they’re more easily led into whatever poor life choices their husband is making. No, he’s picked Flint.”</p><p>Marcus Flint, the hulking great nemesis of his entire life.</p><p>“Fuck me!”</p><p>Oliver’s not prone to swearing, but the expletive slips out unexpectedly.</p><p>“I’d like to, but I think a few people would take offence to pre-marital sex – Flint being one of them, and dad being another.”</p><p>Her brazen words make Oliver blush, not for the first time. She’s never acted on anything she’s suggested to him and he’s still not sure if she <em>means</em> <em>it</em> means it, or if she’s just riling him up because she finds it funny that his ears turn red when he’s embarrassed. He usually just lets it slip by. Daphne’s never been the type to stop short when she wants something, so he’s always figured it’s just a game to her and silently quashed down his own latent feelings.</p><p>“What are you going to do?” he asks.</p><p>She plays with her teacup, spinning it around so the remnants swish about. “I was thinking about eloping.”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“With you.”</p><p>Oliver goggles at her. “I think I’ve missed something crucial in this conversation.”</p><p>“I mean, it’s not like you’ve got any great love for anyone beyond Quidditch, and at least you know I’m not marrying you for your money or fame or anything like that.” She won’t look him in the eye and it’s weirding him out.</p><p>“You want to marry me?”</p><p>“It didn’t sound like that bad of an idea in my head, but it’s cool if you say no. Like, it’s your life. Do what you want. Just an idea.”</p><p>“Hold up just a second, Greengrass,” Oliver says, pinching his nose. “You just proposed to me. Really badly, but still – that was basically a proposal. Now, look me in the eye and say that you want to marry me.”</p><p>She glances up briefly. “I want to marry you.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>That causes her to look up again. “What do you mean, why? You know why – we just had a whole conversation about it.”</p><p>“I know the tipping point, but what’s the rest of it… I’m not going to be your last resort, Daphne. There’s got to be something more than a last-ditch escape attempt to this marriage if I’m going to go through with it.”</p><p>“When did you get all think-before-you-act? Used to be I could get you to do anything, just because I asked.”</p><p>Oliver gave her a sideways glance. “I think it’s called growing up. Being an adult; knowing that our choices have consequences. Now, come on – is there something, anything more than just wanting to avoid be saddled with Flint.”</p><p>It’s Daphne’s turn to flush red as she answers him, “More? Like having had the worst crush on you since forever? Because you’re so you. You’re funny; you put up with me; you’re obsessed with a game that takes up literally all your spare time but still somehow find a minute in your evening to read about a kid’s complaints about school and reply to her for four whole years.”</p><p>“That’ll do it,” Oliver says, and it makes Daphne burst out a peal of laughter.</p><p>“You’re such an idiot,” she adds.</p><p>“That’s not helping your case exactly, but I guess it’s true sometimes,” Oliver admits, heart beating a million times a minute.</p><p>She finally looks him directly in the eye and it’s as though a fire is burning inside her as she says, “I don’t want to marry Flint. I want to marry you and to hell with dad’s plans. If I’m going to be a god damned quidditch wag, I’m picking my own bloody husband and it’ll be the one I’ve been stupidly in love with since before I even started school.”</p><p>Oliver can’t help but kiss her.</p><p> </p></div>
