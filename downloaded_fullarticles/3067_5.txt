It made him think of his grandmother, her love of baking, and his love of her paczki. Even trimmed up from boot camp, Jacob “Doughboy” Kowalski was still no bean pole; his love of French pastries kept him a little rounder than regulation. But he liked himself, all-in-all. Liked his sideways grin and the little duck curl that dropped over his forehead. So, he smiled easy and found, quite without trying, he was always <em>on the make*</em>. The French girls just ate him up. He blushed deeply when they said his name. They’d blush on the rare occasion when Jacob would steal a kiss.</p><p>     But those were lighthearted, far-away moments.

Jacobs’ duck curls and mustache were hacked back to his skull - an effort to combat <em>des totos*</em>. Soldiers boots barely more than mobile mud puddles, Jacob’s were as worse for the wear.
