  <b>Chapter 1</b>
</p><p>
  <span>The first thing people noticed about the middle aged woman was her size. Despite being shorter than average, Jami was large. A fact that she was very well aware of. The amount of people who found it hard to get past her large figure and actually see her for the person she actually was, was staggering. When Jami got into arguments with anti-vaxxers, she would try linking them direct scientific evidence on why vaccinations worked. One would think that somebody would be able to accept scientific proof right? Often though, their response was “Why would anyone listen to a fatass like you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For this reason, Jami preferred the company of people who had enough intelligence to be able to understand basic scientific principles. After all, Jami was a fan of science. It's helped society so much. So when the opportunity came for her to help participate in a scientific study, she jumped at the chance. Jami had tried applying for a study before, but had been excluded due to her weight. This time however, she was assured that it would be no problem. The fact she was going to be paid for it was an extra bonus, as she would have been happy to help either way. Win win!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She found out about the study from Jing, an asian woman who would occasionally visit the library where Jami worked and borrow fiction books. She'd occasionally stop and chat to Jami about random things when out of no where she asked Jami if she'd ever be willing to help in a study. Jami agreed and Jing gave her details.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Jami arrived at the address, she did a second take. Jami was expecting some sort of fancy laboratory. Instead she found herself in the middle of a run-down industrial area. A large double story red-brick building was surrounded by a double tall barbed wire fence with a small field of overgrown grass in between. Ignoring her doubts, Jami walked to the gate and pressed the buzzer. After giving her details, the gate automatically opened and Jami stepped inside, the gate automatically shutting behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time she reached the front door of the building, Jing waiting waiting in the doorway with a smile, her black hair in a tight pony-tail, wearing red-rimmed glasses and a lab coat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Come on in! It shouldn't take long. Just a few forms, few observations, vision test and blood test!".</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jami sat down in the waiting area, which thankfully looked much nicer than the outside of the building and filled in the forms and waited. Jami wondered briefly if all scientific studies required participants to sign non-disclosure agreements.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite being a large modern-looking waiting area, she was the only person there. They could have at least had some magazines or reading material out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few moments later and Jing came out, followed by a balding man who bore a striking resemblance to Steve Jobs. He shook Jami’s hand and smiled, but the type of smile people do when their mouth smiles, but their eyes do not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello Jami. My name is Dr Sturgeon. If you’d follow me please”.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took her into a small examination room and did some pretty normal tests. Blood pressure, temperature, weight, eyesight, etc. Next came Jami’s least favourite part. He took some bloods, then gave her an injection of a clear fluid, which Jami assumed was supposed to be the drug being tested. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dr Sturgeon was not a big talker. The only time he would talk to Jami was when he was giving her an instruction. She was beginning to feel like a lab-rat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will I find out afterwards if I was in the placebo group?” asked Jami as they left the ex</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No”. His reply was short and disinterested. “Make sure to notify my assistant Jing if you have any side effects at all, even if it is up to 12 months later. We will see you in one week for more testing. You may go now.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jami noticed nothing unusual in the week. She did have a migraine, however that was not unusual for her. She rang up the number of the card Jing card her and reported it anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her next visit went almost exactly the same, tests followed by an injection of clear fluid. The only difference was Dr Sturgeon had been replaced by Dr Magly, a brown haired woman, who Jami liked even less. Once again, there was no interest in talking to Jami, except for a rude comment about her weight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there a reason my weight is relevant to your life? Comments like that aren’t what I’d call professional.” retorted Jami. Dr Magly had no reply. Probably didn’t expect the fat woman to have a backbone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> The last visit was just tests with Dr Sturgeon, no more injections. Jami was disappointed she was never told anything about the study. Nothing about the results. At least she got an easy $500 in cash, so there was that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fortunately there were no side effects, nothing strange happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not until three months later when was admitted to hospital in incredible pain.</span>

<hr/><p> </p><p>This was the first chapter. I know it's not great and starts off far too slow, but please remember my goal is to just finish a story for NaNoWriMo, something I've never done before.</p><p>I have a few more chapters to post but can't work out how to do it. My first time posting a story here.</p><p>If you have any suggestions on how I can make this chapter less boring, PLEASE let me know. Please correct any grammar mistakes. My goal is to improve and I really want to!</p>
