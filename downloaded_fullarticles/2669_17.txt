    <p dir="ltr">Saturday 23rd June, 1991.</p><p><b>7:38am </b>Am resisting urge to brain self against wall. After having had a rather delicious dream, one where I’d been sitting atop a flying motorbike, my wart of an aunt had decided to wake me up at the ass crack of dawn to make breakfast. Must go make bacon now. Fun.</p><p> </p><p><b>8:06am </b>The meat sacks enjoyed breakfast. I think I am getting the hang of this cooking thing. One of these days I will slip laxatives into their tea.</p><p> </p><p>Presents for Dudley cover every inch of the living room. Secretly slip one into my pocket.</p><p> </p><p><b>8:32am</b> Dudley is trying to count his presents. Smart one, he is. Am wolfing down the bacon before Dudley’s brain explodes with the strain of adding 2 to 37.</p><p> </p><p><b>8:35am </b>Ms Figg has broken her leg again. This means I will have to hang out with Dudley today. Am not looking forward to it.</p><p> </p><p><b>8:39am </b>Briefly wonder how Ms Figg broke her leg. </p><p> </p><p>I decide it was a cat.</p><p> </p><p><b>8:43am </b>Dudley is crying. One of these days I will shove a fork up his nostril. One of these days.</p><p> </p><p><b>9:17am</b> Am currently en route to the zoo. I have been secretly farting for the past three minutes.</p><p> </p><p>Smile to myself as Dudley starts sniffing the air suspiciously.</p><p> </p><p><b>9:24am</b> Mention my motorcycle dream. Uncle Vernon freaks. Perhaps he is afraid of motorcycles. Dudley’s friend Piers laughs at me.</p><p> </p><p>Toy with the idea of shoving a fork up Piers nostril too.</p><p> </p><p><b>12:31pm</b> Am currently talking to a snake. It blinks as I ask it questions. Do not stop to think how the snake is talking to me.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dudley has seen that the snake is moving, he is coming over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><b>12:34pm</b> Have been shoved to the floor. My ass cheeks will throb this night.</p><p> </p><p><b>12:37pm</b> Snake escapes enclosure. The glass has mysteriously vanished. Does glass do that a lot? Make a mental note to stop talking to snakes.</p><p> </p><p><b>3:47pm</b> Uncle Vernon didn’t like the disappearing glass. Am currently locked in my cupboard. Every now and again Dudley comes thundering down the steps and I worry the stairs will cave in.</p><p> </p><p>Friday 28th June</p><p><b>7:47pm</b> Have been shut in the cupboard for nearly a week. Have spotted several spiders in my bed.</p><p> </p><p>Wednesday 4th July</p><p><b>3:48 pm</b> Currently still in cupboard. Am beginning to wish the stairs will cave in on me. I have started playing chess with myself.</p><p> </p><p>Sunday 14th July</p><p><b>5:41am</b> Was rudely awoken this morning by the rumbling of my stomach. Those spiders are looking mad tasty.</p><p> </p><p>Monday 23rd July</p><p><b>1:39pm</b> Have finally been let out of the cupboard. Immediately run outside to breath in the fresh air. Am very tempted to climb a tree.</p><p> </p><p><b>1:43pm</b> Catch a neighbour staring at me as I run in circles. Try to play it off cool and slink back inside.</p><p> </p><p><b>1:45pm</b> Have not played it off cool. Neighbour still staring as I peek at her through the curtains.</p><p> </p>
