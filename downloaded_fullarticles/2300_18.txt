    <p>Hands.</p><p>
  <em>Everywhere. </em>
</p><p>If Remus hadn't been conscious of what was happening, he would think he'd gone insane. On the other hand, it didn't feel <em>so bad. </em>The  blindfold covering his eyes only made him more responsive to the  sensation of dozens of hands touching and caressing his skin. Remus  had come to acknowledge how fun and interesting it was when Sirius  found a book he actually enjoyed reading. It didn't matter if the book  was filled with charms and spells to enhance sexual pleasure, or if  there was a complete chapter dedicated to the magic of erogenous zones.  Sirius had been reading and that was all that mattered.</p><p>So when Sirius asked him to strip and get on the bed, Remus did so naturally.</p><p>He'd  thought Sirius was going to bind his hands with his tie but somehow  managed to produce thin strips of leather that held his wrists tightly  in place above his head.</p><p>The invisible hands were not just  caressing anymore. Remus felt how his skin was being gripped, clutched  by strong fingers. He imagined them to be Sirius' hands, and smiled.</p><p>Sirius  had been kneeling on the floor, elbows propped on the bed before he  blindfolded Remus. Every now and then he would touch Remus' thigh, draw a  line with his finger down his chest. It was suddenly not enough for  Remus, so he gave a quiet moan, urging Sirius to up the ante.</p><p>A soft murmur was the only evidence to Sirius obliging.</p><p>Remus  moaned as he stretched his entire body on the bed. The hands were gone,  but were now replaced with the sensation of wet, hot mouths. He  whimpered when he felt teasing licks on his nipples, biting his lip as  he tried to loosen the restraints keeping his hands still.</p><p>'God, that feels brilliant,' moaned Remus as the mouths continued working over his skin.</p><p>'Told  you this book was amazing. I think I can direct them over specific  places. Hold on…' Remus couldn't see his face, but he knew Sirius was  scrunching his face in concentration the same way he does when solving a  flaw in a prank. The same way he does when figuring out which position  will make them sore in the morning.</p><p>'I applaud the great Mr.  Padfoot. Bless your sense of curiosity and-' Remus' voice was cut off by  a whoosh of breath as the invisible mouths all concentrated on the soft  flesh inside his thighs.</p><p>'Tell me how good it feels, Moony.' Sirius inched closer to Remus, hot breath making his skin tingle pleasantly.</p><p>'It…it  feels, oh shit,' Remus moved restlessly as he spread his legs wider,  wanting nothing more than to have the mouths move even lower.</p><p>'You're  going to love me for this, love,' came Sirius' voice in a breathless  laugh. The sound of pages being turned swiftly meant he was looking for  something in particular. It didn't matter that Sirius Black was using  spells he'd never practiced before on Remus. He trusted that mutt with  anything that had to do with orgasms.</p><p>Remus was ripped from his  contemplation of Sirius when he felt what he thought was a finger run  down his right thigh, then felt the same thing on the other leg. Two  finger tips moved over each side of his hips, over the ridges of his  ribs, up to his neck.</p><p>It was a simple touch, but it had Remus breathing heavily, chest heaving almost painfully.</p><p>'What  if…I try all three of these together…' Sirius tended to think out loud,  and now he was whispering three different incantations in quick  succession.</p><p>Remus' mind went blank.</p><p>The mouths were still  working his thighs, only this time Sirius added tongues that gave  teasing licks. Hands palmed his cock, cupped his arse and caressed his  neck and shoulders. The two fingers that had made Remus pant were now  sliding down his spine and, with a lustful moan from Remus, slid inside  his body slowly.</p><p>'Merlin, look at you now.' Sirius moved onto the  bed now, mouth sucking on Remus neck. 'Don't you just love how well I  take of you, Moony?'</p><p>'Yes…' hissed Remus, mind still blank and  useless. The fingers had picked up speed, simultaneously fucking him  while prodding his prostate randomly. Sirius was now covering half his  body, hips bucking as Remus' body writhed under him.</p><p>As if he wasn't on the verge already, Sirius bent his head to swallow Remus cock in a swift move, making him thrust up, hard.</p><p>Then  Sirius lifted his head, voice hoarse and lips ghosting over the skin  when he whispered, 'Come, Remus. Now…' and made Remus come, a long moan  that burned itself into Sirius' memory forever.</p><p>The fingers pushed  in as far as they magically could while Remus lifted his hips  spectacularly off the bed, white ribbons of come falling on his stomach.  His throat burned from the harsh breaths he had to take but it didn't  matter, not when Sirius was licking his stomach clean.</p><p>He ripped  the blindfold off, grinning as Sirius continued to lick but managing to  smile back as well. Whatever charms Sirius had used had stopped the  moment he came, which was brilliant since he had no control of his limbs  to even move up onto the pillows.</p><p>Sirius crawled up his body,  almost shaking with uncontrolled excitement as he began to yell, 'Get  up, Moony! It's my turn! Bloody hell, you came hard!'</p><p>Remus loved it when Sirius read books.</p>
