    <p>Lavender loved being pretty when she was little.</p>
<p>She took a lot of joy in finding the best dress, the best shoes, the best makeup. She would beg her mother to let her try on makeup, and spent hours playing dress-up among the trunks in her family’s attic.</p>
<p>That was part of why she didn’t get along with Hermione Granger. She didn’t care about being pretty, and would always ignore Lavender and Parvati’s invitations to join in on their spa days. Eventually they stopped inviting her.</p>
<p>“If she wants to feel superior because she doesn’t like what we like, that’s her problem,” Parvati sniffed.</p>
<p>Years later, all three would feel regret—Hermione, because the girls who cared about makeup at her old school were mean to her so she didn’t want to give these new ones a chance—and Lavender and Parvati, because they realized they were doing the exact same thing to Hermione.</p>
<p>Then Voldemort came back, and Lavender hated herself for doubting Harry at first. But Professor Trelawney saw such good things in the future for her and Parvati and even Hogwarts, so Voldemort couldn’t be spoiling that, could he?</p>
<p>But even though it was true and Death Eater activity started getting horrible and her parents wanted to pull her out of school, Lavender still took joy in feeling pretty. And Ron Weasley wanted to go out with her—<em>Ron Weasley! </em>Who was a hero and quite a good kisser and she was happy, and maybe things would be alright.</p>
<p>Then Dumbledore died, Snape took over as Headmaster, and Lavender quickly learned that being pretty was both a curse and a weapon.</p>
<p>The children of Death Eaters were the Prefects, and Draco Malfoy was Head Boy. They determined who got punished and who got rewarded for everything; there were no more points.</p>
<p>They even decided who got to be the Rewards.</p>
<p>And Lavender, pretty, still so pretty even though she was so worried, with her pure blood and her experience, was a Reward for the very best.</p>
<p>Snape refused to allow rape, but there were places in the castle where even he didn’t see. So he cast charms on the girl and boy Rewards, so that if anyone touched them without their consent, he would know immediately.</p>
<p>So Lavender’s Reward sessions usually involved standing, dancing, letting people talk to her, having people touch themselves in front of her. It was horrible and degrading, and no amount of showering could make it better. She begged Professor Snape to let the little ones alone; some of the Reward girls were only twelve, for Merlin’s sake. Snape took away the youngest ones, but he didn’t stop the Rewards.</p>
<p>No one would ever know if he could only do so much, if he sacrificed a few for the good of the many. He took that secret to his grave.</p>
<p>So Lavender was on her own, and she decided to make the best of it.</p>
<p>The next time she was a Reward, she said something new.</p>
<p>“You can touch, if you like.”</p>
<p>Before Christmas came Lavender was the only sexual reward anyone wanted, because she <em>consented. </em>You couldn’t hurt her—that was her one rule. But other than that, she would do whatever you wanted.</p>
<p>Lavender became The Reward.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall cottoned on to what she was doing early, and she tried to talk her out of it, but Lavender just stared at her in silence. “I’m pretty,” she said. “I can take it.”</p>
<p>And McGonagall understood, and let her cry and cried herself. “I can get you out of here. I can try…”</p>
<p>“No. The little ones need you. I’ll be alright.”</p>
<p>McGonagall smuggled her pretty clothes, and makeup, and salves and Dreamless sleep potions, and Lavender coped. She discovered that being pretty was a type of armour; all anyone would talk about was her body, they didn’t care who she was. So she floated away, and kept her mind busy, thinking, thinking, thinking…</p>
<p>When the word got out about the Room of Requirement, and Neville disappeared, Lavender knew what she had to do. She distracted the Prefects as best as she could while the others in the D.A. smuggled out the children, she made sure the Room had bathrooms, had room for everyone…</p>
<p>One night she almost got caught.</p>
<p>When the Prefect was finished with her, the door opened, and Draco Malfoy came in. He snarled at the Prefect about the rules, but the Prefect defended himself.</p>
<p>“The whore said it was alright!”</p>
<p>Draco sent him out and gave Lavender something to cover herself. He’d never come to her, not once.</p>
<p>“Did you really consent?” Draco asked. “Really and truly?”</p>
<p>“Why do you care?”</p>
<p>“People aren’t rewards. They shouldn’t be.”</p>
<p>Lavender was struck by the truth in his voice. “It’s alright,” she said shakily. “Believe me, I chose this.” <em>I have a plan. </em></p>
<p>Draco just nodded. “If you want it to stop, I can help.”</p>
<p>The same offer as McGonagall, and it was March now and people were disappearing, being tortured, being killed, and Lavender was getting tired of being pretty.</p>
<p>But she had to be brave, because if she stopped, who would be the Reward?</p>
<p>“I can’t,” she answered.</p>
<p>Draco nodded. He left her then. Lavender didn’t sleep that night, worried that he would tell Snape, but nothing happened. The only thing that changed was the amount of times she ‘Rewarded’ someone in a week.</p>
<p>She spent any free nights in the Room of Requirement, helping to plan, to save. Some of the others looked at her differently, but Lavender didn’t care. She’d always been so confused by her Sorting into Gryffindor. She wasn’t really that brave. But now her pretty had become a suit of armor, her beauty a weapon. She had to be strong enough to continue.</p>
<p>And then the Battle of Hogwarts happened, and for the first time in ages Lavender could <em>fight</em>, really fight for the first time, shooting off curses and trying to protect the young ones (when did the sixteen year old ones become young, she was eighteen, only eighteen) and then she caught a Stunning Spell on the edge of her Shield Charm, so potent that it sent her flying over the balcony.</p>
<p>The last thing she saw before everything went black was a man moving like a wolf, leaping towards her.</p>
<p>   She woke up in the Hospital Wing, the Battle over. Parvati was sitting by her bed, crying as she held her hand. The blows of pain as she heard the names of the dead hit her chest like a sledgehammer, but at last, it was over.  </p>
<p>Lavender was well enough to stand for the first round of funerals, and when they were over, they all went back to Hogwarts. Just as they had once so long ago, the tables were Vanished in the Great Hall after dinner, and sleeping bags and cushions were spread out over the ground. People were huddling in groups unrelated to House, just hanging on to the other survivors.</p>
<p>Before they went to sleep though, a fifth-year Ravenclaw that Lavender vaguely recognized spat in her face.</p>
<p>Parvati had her in a headlock in a second, and Hermione had her wand trained on the spitter.</p>
<p>“How dare you?” Neville shouted.</p>
<p>“She’s a filthy Death Eater whore!” The Ravenclaw snarled. “She fucked them, she was nice to them, you all know it!”</p>
<p>Lavender stood up, shaky on her feet still. The fall had broken dozens of bones, and even Madam Pomfrey could only heal so fast. As for her arms and torso, they were bound with bandages from Fenrir Grayback’s attack. “She’s right,” she said, as loudly as she could.</p>
<p>The Great Hall was quiet.</p>
<p>“They chose me to be a Reward for the Death Eater’s children,” Lavender said. “And I went along with it, so they wouldn’t choose somebody else prettier. Or younger, or kinder, or brighter. I made myself the best lay you could ever have, and they fell at my feet. I could have fought and lost my life; or I could have stayed pretty, and saved others from the same fate. I chose to play the whore.”</p>
<p>And standing there in front of everyone, Lavender felt more naked than she ever had.</p>
<p>But then Hermione Granger hugged her, whispered <em>Lavender you brave, beautiful girl, </em>and she broke down into tears.</p>
<p>The next day Lavender’s bandages were removed, and the damage was shown. Deep scars went up and down her arms, and her torso had a few bites marks.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t full moon,” Madam Pomfrey said quickly. “So you won’t be a werewolf. But there’s only so much I can do, and…”</p>
<p>Lavender got the message. She wasn’t pretty anymore. At least she’d kept her face.</p>
<p>Parvati was ready to start fighting again, to work and heal others and be there. Lavender couldn’t. She packed her bags, promised to write when she could, and ran for a beautiful place.</p>
<p>She found it in Wales, one of the most remote areas of that wild country. She took long walks and cried and drank Dreamless Sleep until she ran out and then stayed awake for three days, staring at the moon. The good part about her scars was that her body didn’t match her nightmares, when she could avoid them no longer. Only her legs were still the same, and even they seemed thinner, frailer than before.</p>
<p>When a month had gone by, Lavender realized she hadn’t written to anyone yet—not her parents, not Parvati, not anyone. She sent off two quick letters, telling them where she was, that she was safe, but she needed quiet.</p>
<p>She needed to be alone.</p>
<p>Gradually Lavender became comfortable with her own skin again.  She took baths instead of showers, she wore dresses without sleeves, and she started to wear makeup. But there was only so much it could do to make her feel better.</p>
<p>One day she had a visitor, one she never would have expected. It was Apolline Delacour, Fleur’s mother.</p>
<p>“Hello, Lavender.”</p>
<p>“Hello,” Lavender said, a bit dazed. “How did you find me?”</p>
<p>“My daughter has begun work with your friend Parvati. She told me about what you did during the war.”</p>
<p>Lavender swallowed. “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to offer you support, if I could. You see, during the time of Grindelwald’s rise to power, there was a Muggle war at the same time. Nowhere was safe in France. My mother had three of us, and my father was dead, killed in the first battle. So she used her body to protect us, trading pleasure for information. She saved many lives.”</p>
<p>A surge of relief. She wasn’t the first.  </p>
<p>“How is your mother?”</p>
<p>“She passed a few years ago,” Apolline replied. “But to her dying day, she was proud of what she had done. As you should, Lavender. You understood your strengths, and you accepted the cost of using them.”</p>
<p>   Lavender’s eyes pricked with tears. “I don’t know if I—if I have accepted all the costs. I didn’t know how I would feel now.”</p>
<p>“And how do you feel now?” Apolline asked.</p>
<p>“I want to feel pretty again,” Lavender sobbed. And that wasn’t exactly what she meant—she wanted to feel free and happy, to sleep well and never eat rare steak again, but in the end, all of that could happen when she felt pretty again.</p>
<p>But Apolline understood.</p>
<p>She stayed with Lavender for three weeks, helped her cook, gave her creams and powders and potions to regain her strength and her skin, helping the scars fade more and more. They were still there when Lavender looked in the mirror, but they looked like part of the past.</p>
<p>And that’s what they were.</p>
<p>Apolline’s husband came after the first week, and Lavender found herself laughing, really laughing again. Francois adored the countryside, and he and Lavender went on long walks, looking for the most beautiful places. Gabrielle came to visit as well, and she and Lavender played dress-up and talked about Divination. Gabrielle was a true Seer, and when she read Lavender’s palm she smiled. “I think things are going to get better for you,” she said. “The hardest part is over.”</p>
<p>When the couple left, Apolline left all of her creams and powders and potions. Lavender protested, but she wouldn’t listen. “They belong to you now. Use them well.”</p>
<p>That first night alone, Lavender didn’t sleep. But this time it wasn’t because of nightmares. Instead, she spent the long hours writing, scratching things out, writing again.</p>
<p>The next day, her owl Binky flew back to England, with a plan for her new job.</p>
<p>Parvati’s shelter was starting to take off, and she couldn’t come to Wales. Susan Bones could, and she and Apolline helped Lavender start her work. They made creams and powders and potions, adjusting ingredients until they had gentle makeup that anyone could wear, makeup that showed off beauty and hid scars.</p>
<p>It was a start, and Lavender packed huge boxes to send to Parvati’s shelter, but there was more she wanted to do. Not a shelter; that was good and important,  but that wasn’t Lavender’s way. She wanted to fight, to help women be brave with their beauty.</p>
<p>From then on, people whispered about the cottage in Wales. If you went there looking for beauty products—Lavender’s Pretties—you would find them. You would find comfortable, healthy makeup that made you feel special. You could also find products that treated dry skin, scars, old injuries and even minor ailments (those were Susan’s inventions).</p>
<p>But if you climbed to the cottage and you needed help, to find tools to deal with a threat, you would find that there too. In fact, Muggle or witch, you would find security, advice, and women who were good with their wands.</p>
<p>Lavender and Susan were a close team, working together to find the best places to hide children, the best curses to fight monsters, the best ways to help women celebrate their pretty. Lavender kept the shelves stocked and her ears open, directing her team to areas of trouble. Susan communicated with Muggle and Wizard law enforcement and planned new training sessions. They split the duties of dealing with clients and making their bed. </p>
<p>And when Hermione Granger, who wasn’t quite sure what to do to help her neighbour, knocked on their door, Lavender and Susan went to the Mills house and knocked on the door.</p>
<p>When Rhonda Mills opened the door, Lavender smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“Hello! We’re here to help you feel pretty.”</p><h2> </h2>
