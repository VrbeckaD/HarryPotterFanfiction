    <p>&gt; </p><p>Obito is ecstatic when he receives his letter.</p><p>It arrives on a Monday afternoon by owl and he is eating a sandwich when he hears the familiar sound of a beak tapping gently against glass. He rushes over and opens the envelope, smells the crisp parchment, sees the words written in flawless bottle-green handwriting and whoops for joy.</p><p>He yells and jumps around the house after pinching himself and realises this is not a dream, that his letter is here and <em>he is really going to Hogwarts!</em> Grandma Masumi smiles as he waves his letter in her face, telling her that he’s finally going to become a real wizard, just like her and just like his mother (she had passed away when he was young in an accident, alongside his father).</p><p>They had been slightly worried he wouldn’t have received it—his magic had been sparse at the best of moments and he had only begun to show signs of it last year.</p><p>Obito and his Grandma plan their trip to Diagon Alley, and he vows internally to make his mother (witch) and father (Muggle) proud.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Diagon Alley is wonderful and exciting and filled with all kinds of unique smells and fascinating shops.</p><p>The stores are bustling and overflowing with back-to-school shoppers and soon-to-be first years like him. He sees a couple of students already dressed in their school robes, carrying their new school supplies and gleefully waves at them, grinning wide when they wave back in acknowledgement.</p><p>Cauldron, ingredients, wand, robes and then Grandma Masumi purchases a beautiful eagle owl and tells him to take good care of it, and also to write to her often. He nods as he accepts his new companion, taking in its beautiful feathers, sharp claws and its intelligent, sharp gaze.</p><p>He names it Kamui.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>As they enter Flourish and Blotts, Obito tries to contain his excitement as Grandma Masumi tackles the extensive booklist and tells him to search for his new textbook on spells (he had never liked reading but he will make do because an education at Hogwarts is more than worth it).</p><p>Everyone is browsing or queuing for their books and bustling with movement, the sound of chatter buzzes around him as he moves through the aisles.</p><p>Obito’s attention turns to a boy with hair like starlight and face hidden beneath a mysterious black mask which covers the entire lower half of his face. He is standing alone in the corner and Obito wonders if he is lost and needs help.</p><p>Suddenly, a tall, blond-haired man appears and takes the boy’s hand, leading him out of the store.</p><p>Obito shrugs and moves on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>He waves goodbye to Grandma Masumi as the train pulls away from the platform, the steam rising and making his eyes tear (he wasn’t crying, damnit!).</p><p>Obito slips into an empty compartment and jumps when a pretty brown-haired girl walks in soon after he does, asking if she can sit here, with him.</p><p>Her name is Nohara Rin, she is also a first year and she is so <em>nice</em>, her laugh is soothing, and her hair is shiny, and her eyes <em>sparkle</em> when she laughs and Obito wants to be her friend more than anything.</p><p>They are later joined by a loud boy with bowl-cut hair (he tries not to laugh) who introduces himself as Might Gai and a cool-kid called Sarutobi Asuma.</p><p>He sees a flash of silver passing their compartment mid-way through the journey and wonders where he’d seen that head of fluffy hair before.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>“Hey! You dropped this.” Obito runs over and taps the boy on the shoulder.</p><p>He is the boy with pretty silver hair like starlight and a black mask that’s covering half of his face. Obito remembers him now, from the train and from Diagon Alley and <em>smiles</em>, hoping that this boy will be a new friend in the years to come.</p><p>A pale hand darts out to snag the book being offered to him (Obito notes how his fingers are so cold).</p><p>“Thanks,” The boy snaps, obviously not thankful at all. He pauses, giving Obito an unimpressed glance. “There’s a bit of dirt on your nose, by the way. Didn’t anyone tell you?”</p><p>The silver-haired boy walks away towards the boats, leaving Obito flushed and embarrassed and scrubbing furiously at his face.</p><p><em>What a jerk</em>, he thinks.</p><p>He shrugs it off and gets onto a boat with Rin, more than ready for their first glimpse of the legendary Hogwarts Castle.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Professor Jiraiya is <em>tall</em> and they have to tilt their heads upwards (his neck hurts) when he’s speaking to look at his face.</p><p>He welcomes them to Hogwarts and tells them that the sorting will now begin, and they will be placed into their respective houses.</p><p>Gai yells out that he wishes to join the honourable house of Gryffindor and Jiraiya laughs heartily, saying that as the head of Gryffindor house, he will be looking forward to having Gai with them amongst their ranks.</p><p>Obito knows Gryffindor is the home of the brave, Ravenclaw the intelligent, Hufflepuff the dedicated and Slytherin the ambitious.</p><p>He decides on the house that he wants and crosses his fingers beneath his new robes for good luck.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>“<em>Gryffindor!</em>”</p><p>Obito feels his chest bloom with happiness and relief as the Gryffindor table (his new housemates!) cheer wildly. He leaps off the stool towards the long wooden table and sits next to Gai and Asuma who have also been sorted into Gryffindor. Obito is thankful that his new friends are together with him and can’t wait for the school year to start already.</p><p>He listens to the buzz of excited conversation around him and notes how a boy named Raido with a peculiar scar across his nose is sorted into Slytherin.</p><p>Raido finds a seat next to the masked silver-haired boy who had embarrassed him earlier. Apparently, his name is Hatake Kakashi and Obito had noticed how the Great Hall went silent when his name had been called, whispers breaking out conspiratorily amongst the students. Why though, he has no idea.</p><p>Obito snorts and tries his best not to think along the lines of <em>Slytherins</em> being jerks—but it is really hard, given their bad reputation from the last wizarding war.</p><p>A minute later, Rin is sorted into Gryffindor too and Obito finds it hard to think about anything else as she runs towards them and slides into the seat next to his, giving him a smile that makes his heart skip a beat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Classes are tough and Obito has a hard time trying not to embarrass himself.</p><p>Luckily Professor Minato is kind and patient and slowly explains the theory of warding charms for him as the rest of the class get to practical spellcasting on an unfortunate bunch of doxies, who’ve been caged for the student's safety.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hatake Kakashi (the genius, the prodigy), is earning awed <em>oohs</em> and <em>ahhs</em> from their classmates as he runs through the entire list of spells in their textbook for warding off pests (the doxies are screeching in anger by the end of it) (nasty, hairy things).</p><p>Professor Minato claps and praises him enthusiastically, giving Hatake Kakashi’s hair a quick tousle. The boy swats the hand away and scowls, brows furrowing.</p><p>Obito decides that Kakashi is a rude, brown-nosing, know-it-all jerk and doesn’t like him very much at all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Kakashi is walking back to the Slytherin common room when he is accosted by a housemate, a rambunctious girl named Anko with purple hair she swears is her natural colouring.</p><p>“Is it true you’re part Veela?”</p><p>He bristles at the intrusive question and feels anger bubbling in the pit of his belly. How had she found out? Just as he opens his mouth to tell her to get lost, she raises her sleeve and he catches an eyeful of shiny scales that run all the way from her forearm up her elbow.</p><p>She grins wide and he sees a pair of sharp fangs that are too long and thin to be human.</p><p><em>Oh</em>, he realises.</p><p>Anko giggles and links her arm in his and the pair of them make their way back into the common room, together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Potions is a breeze and Kakashi mixes his brew five times clockwise as the instructions say and waves his wand over the cauldron, completing his Cure for Boils.</p><p>Orochimaru (potions master and Slytherin’s head of house) walks over to their table and nods in approval at him and Ebisu, who preens under the attention like a dog being petted.</p><p>Kakashi lazily casts his gaze over to the rest of his classmates and wonders who thought it was a good idea to branch the Slytherins and Gryffindors together for nearly every subject. They are also a loud and annoying bunch and Kakashi thanks the heavens his housemates have a sense of dignity and decorum (well, <em>most</em> of them anyway).</p><p>He scoffs as Uchiha Obito from Gryffindor manages to <em>explode</em> his concoction and Ebisu, along with the rest of his housemates burst into mocking laughter as Orochimaru uses a water spell (“<em>Aguamenti</em>.”) to douse the flames, soaking the entire table and Uchiha Obito in the process.</p><p><em>What a joke</em>, Kakashi thinks, and turns the page to an advanced chapter of potions, wishing that class would end already.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Their first ever Flying lesson is a disaster.</p><p>Kakashi is starting to think that every class with Uchiha Obito in it will <em>inevitably</em> turn out to be a disaster. He hovers a few feet above the ground on his broom lazily and watches as Tsume frantically chases after the boy (who is dangling dangerously off the handle) before he manages to fly over the high wall towards the rest of the castle.</p><p>He sighs as the Gryffindor is dislodged from his broom (ignoring the screams from his classmates) and slips out his wand, casting a silent but skilful <em>Levicorpus </em>which dangles the black-haired boy by the ankle, barely saving him from kissing the grass below.</p><p>Said broom smashes into a thousand wooden pieces as it hits the stone wall and Tsume lands gracefully, catching Obito just as the incantation is released by Kakashi.</p><p>She turns her sharp gaze towards him, red triangle marks twisted in a beastly, pleased grin and then turns her attention back to Obito (who is already tearing and shaken). Tsume awards ten points to Slytherin for his quick thinking and excellent spellwork.</p><p>Anko and Raido give him matching smirks as he shrugs at them, while Ebisu boasts loudly about their (his) accomplishment and how Slytherin is the most talented house of their year.</p><p>The lesson ends soon after and Kakashi heads off to the Great Hall for lunch and realises that he is being followed closely by them. There is Anko (not completely human, like him), Raido (scarred and observant), Ebisu (suck up) and Ibiki (quiet and serious).</p><p>He decides that he doesn’t mind having them around and accepts his new entourage without protest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Quidditch is <em>amazing</em> and Obito hopes he will be able to secure a spot on the team next year. Maybe as a Chaser. Or even a Beater!</p><p>He yells and cheers for Gryffindor until his throat hurts as his upperclassmen zoom past the stands, working in perfect synchronisation and completely obliterating the opponent Hufflepuffs.</p><p>The match comes to an end as their seventh year Gryffindor Seeker catches the Snitch and a whopping 150 points are awarded to their team.</p><p>Everyone cheers and sings their song of victory and Obito decides that being Seeker would be awesome, too. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Kakashi doesn’t care much for Quidditch and instead spends his afternoon in the library reading advanced books on Arithmancy.</p><p>He is joined by Ibiki who doesn’t care much for the sport either.</p><p>They spend the rest of the day in companionable silence and then ignore Anko when she bursts into the common room hours later with the rest of their housemates, declaring how she <em>will </em>become a Beater next year when they are allowed to try out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Christmas rolls around and Obito is all packed and ready to head home.</p><p>He waves cheerfully goodbye to his teachers and lugs his suitcase down the hallway, walking together with his friends.</p><p>As they pass the Great Hall, he sees a lone figure (face hidden behind a towering tome) at the empty Slytherin table.</p><p>He knows that some kids aren’t so lucky and will stay in the school for the Christmas break (nowhere to go) (no family to visit). He feels a pang of pity for whoever it is.</p><p>The tome is lowered, and he sees a familiar head of silver, fluffy hair and the pity all but disappears.</p><p>He resumes his path out the castle doors and towards the train and chats excitedly with his friends about their plans for the holiday (Rin and Gai promise to write and Asuma says he will be sending them all gifts).</p><p>Obito briefly entertains the thought of how things would be different if he and Kakashi were to somehow become friends. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Kakashi reads his book and ignores the rest of his schoolmates returning home for Christmas.</p><p>He doesn’t envy them.</p><p>He doesn’t miss home.</p><p>He <em>does not</em> miss his father.</p><p>Kakashi sees the spots where his tears have smudged the paper and realises that he is lying to himself.</p><p>He sits in the Great Hall alone until the students are all but gone.</p><p>Then he feels a warm hand on his shoulder and turns, taking in the visage of Minato and his warm, understanding smile.</p><p>He is pulled into a hug and hesitates for just a minute before breaking down in quiet sobs, grabbing at his teacher’s robes and wishing he could hug <em>Tou-san</em> just one more time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>It is Christmas morning, and Kakashi joins the remaining faculty for the feast.</p><p>Tsunade and Jiraiya are arguing fervently about something while Orochimaru observes quietly from the side. He secretly wishes Headmaster Hiruzen would have stayed to keep them in check (his professors sometimes acted like children), but he had returned home with his son, Asuma (one of Uchiha Obito’s friends).</p><p>Minato and Tsume are talking about Quidditch. She slugs him on the arm, telling him to whip his Ravenclaws into shape (it looks painful).</p><p>Inoichi offers the end of a wizard cracker to him and Kakashi pulls and flinches as silver confetti and a plume of blue smoke ends up hitting him in the face. He blinks and sees a silver, charmed trinket in the shape of a dog barking excitedly at him from his plate and Kakashi smiles beneath the mask, giving it a little scratch.</p><p>Across the table, Minato gives him a hopeful nod and a gentle smile.</p><p>Kakashi decides that maybe Christmas isn’t so bad after all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt;</p><p>On New Year’s Eve, Kakashi stands alone outside the owlery.</p><p>At least, he thought he was alone. He feels a presence behind him and is surprised to see Orochimaru, dressed in a simple black robe.</p><p>The potions master gives him a silent nod as he stands next to Kakashi in the cold.</p><p>And Kakashi knows, he is not the only one feeling alone and sometimes it is nice to be alone, together.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>The second term begins and Obito is scribbling furiously on his parchment as he struggles to take notes.</p><p>Professor Shikaku speaks in a low, bored voice and rambles on about Transfiguration theory like it’s nothing and expects the rest of the class to keep up. He is nearly tearing his hair out in frustration when Rin slides him her notes, allowing him to copy.</p><p>He blushes and thanks her. She smiles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Kakashi notices how the Nohara girl hands Uchiha Obito her notes and scowls.</p><p>He hates people who don’t work hard for their achievements. Those who don’t put in effort don’t deserve to succeed.</p><p>But he feels like a hypocrite when he notices Anko greedily eying his neatly written answers during their quiz and lets her copy off him after Shikaku falls asleep at his desk (undoubtedly the laziest professor at Hogwarts).</p><p><em>Just this once</em>, he thinks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>The exams are over and Obito breathes a sigh of relief.</p><p>He spends the last week of the academic year playing magical board games and exploring parts of the castle with his friends.</p><p>When the Leaving Feast rolls around, he is horrified to learn that Slytherin has the most house points and is awarded the House Cup.</p><p>He grumbles unhappily with his fellow Gryffindors and promises to himself to do better next year so that they will win (and beat the smug looks off the Slytherin’s faces).</p><p>Hatake Kakashi catches his gaze from across the room and huffs, crossing his arms and giving him a judgemental glare.</p><p>
  <em>What a jerk!</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Kakashi rolls his eyes as he sees the crumbs coating Uchiha Obito’s mouth and wonders if he is even able to afford a mirror.</p><p>He wonders how such an unkempt, unruly boy managed to get into Hogwarts and hopes that next year, they will be in different classes.</p><p>The feast comes to an end and Kakashi celebrates with his housemates during a <em>private</em> dinner party in their Slytherin common room (the lanterns have been charmed to glow green and snow silver confetti in their honour) and listens to the prefects’ speeches on how they must maintain their victory over Gryffindor the next year as well.</p><p>He wonders why Gryffindor and Slytherin have always been each other throats and thinks that it is stupid.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>&gt; </p><p>Kakashi packs his bags and is soon boarding the Hogwarts Express back to platform 9¾.</p><p>He is greeted by nobody and watches as his friends leave with their parents (Anko’s father is a pale, trembly thing) (Ebisu’s parents gush over his silver hair and noble heritage). Ibiki and Raido have already disappeared.</p><p>He sees the Gryffindors Nohara Rin and Uchiha Obito leaving the station together and wonders if they have plans for the summer.</p><p>Kakashi leaves for home, alone.</p><p> </p>
