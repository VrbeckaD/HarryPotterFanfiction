</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart! I have been hunting like a rabid dog for you, I swear--” a man curled his fingers around her elbow in a pleading manner, pushing her towards the far end of the stalls. He was being followed by several uniformed persons, with uniform scowls. Hermione brandished her wand from inside her sleeve and pressed it to the softest part of the strange man’s wrist.</p><p>“Do you really think that's wise?” she said, firmly.</p><p>The man continued pushing her towards the edge of the lane but he released her elbow readily, directing her with the imposing curve of his shoulders more than anything. He smiled down at her sweetly and shook his head as if she had just said something delightful and daft.</p><p>“Put that away,” he murmured, gesturing for her to proceed into a shop full of men’s apparel. “You aren’t really going to curse me in public, are you?”</p><p>“I’m not against the idea,” she whispered. She pocketed the wand and stepped up to the counter. Her heart was racing. The man stepped up beside her and pointed to a bow tie behind glass. </p><p>“Now, what do you think of that one?” he asked. </p><p>The bell on the door tinkled and the uniformed trio stepped into the tiny shop, effectively infringing on Hermione and the man’s space. Hermione glanced at the stranger and he looked up at her earnestly. </p><p>“Can I help you?” the shopkeeper asked, swiveling around on her stool behind the counter. “I see you eyeing our collection of ascots, sir. Perhaps the burnt umber?”</p><p>The man seemed to consider this option as the shopkeeper produced said ascot from the case and laid it out. It had minute golden paisleys woven into the silk. Hermione wrinkled her nose.</p><p>“It’s too much,” Hermione said. </p><p>The shopkeeper produced a brown scarf with an argyl pattern. The man considered it. “This could be nice, dear.”</p><p>Again, Hermione shook her head. “It’s all wrong for you!”</p><p>“What, am I ugly in earth tones?” he scoffed. “You know, I’m beginning to wonder if you ever liked me.” </p><p>“I don’t even know who you are anymore!” Hermione spat.</p><p>The tallest of the officers, who up until now had merely been observing their conversation (and Hermione assumed waiting for their moment to snatch the man), held up a hand between them. “Is there a problem, here?” he asked.</p><p>The man sighed heavily and pinched the bridge of his nose. “No, officer. Well, yes… a deeply-rooted problem that I have been refusing to face for what feels like ten years, and now I’m forgetting what that young man saw all those years ago--”</p><p>“What happened to <em> that </em>young man?” Hermione asked, folding her arms. She had nearly revealed the charade, listening to him speak so earnestly.</p><p>“Whatever happened to the girl who met me where I am?” The man stepped closer to her, nearly nose-to-nose. Hermione looked down and shook her head.</p><p>“You were late,” she said. He stepped back from her, hand to his chest.</p><p>The man reached into his coat and produced a small box, which he set on the counter. “I was saving this for Christmas,” he said softly. “But I can see, now, that it may be an impossibility.”</p><p>The man sidled between Hermione and the officers and stepped through the door of the shop, pausing on the step. He turned back. “If you decide that you can forgive me for not being your father… I’ll be at our pub.” He pulled his coat tighter around himself and walked away.</p><p>Hermione grabbed the box on the counter and opened it. It was a massive emerald ring, set in a bevvy of diamonds. She gasped. No charade was needed to feign shock. What was he playing at?</p><p>“Tough break, love,” the shopkeeper said to Hermione. She sniffled and pocketed the ring.</p><p>“I’m sorry for causing a spectacle,” Hermione said. “And you do have lovely things, I beg your pardon for what I said.”</p><p>The shopkeeper shrugged. “Men are dogs.”</p><p>“This particular man is a snake,” Hermione said. The officers chuckled and parted to let her pass. “Thank you.”</p><p>Hermione tightened the scarf at her neck and leaned into the brisk wind. Well, her afternoon plans of Christmas shopping had just been dashed, and now she had to find the snake. But there was only one place he would’ve considered “their” pub, so it was only a matter of getting on her way and returning the priceless heirloom ring. It was no more than a fifteen minute walk, so he didn’t have that much of a head-start. She wondered what he had been doing in Covent Garden a week before Christmas; surely he didn’t have muggle business. Or maybe he did, how was Hermione to know what he got up to, now that they weren’t forced by professors to share hallways, cauldrons, or tea leaves? It had been… ten years since she had seen him last? No… it had to be more. He was clearly still part of the wizarding world in England if he was willing to haunt The Leaky Cauldron. Hermione pulled the box out of her pocket. The top was engraved with a crest and an unmistakable swirling ‘M’.</p><p>The bell on the door tinkled as Hermione entered The Leaky Cauldron. Merlin… it was decorated top to bottom with greenery, floating candles, and an array of crystal baubles. Tom had been busy. The man himself greeted Hermione from behind the bar; he was wearing a jaunty blue velvet top hat.</p><p>“Morning, Ms. Granger,” Tom said warmly. “Your party is waiting in the snug, I just brought in the tea.” He gestured towards the other end of the mahogany bar, where the curtained snug was illuminated. She could just see a pair of fine italian loafers through the doorway. </p><p>“Ah, thank you Tom,” she said. Hermione thought it practical that he had booked the snug verses an open table, despite the fact that there were no other patrons in the pub so early on a Tuesday. But one could never be too careful--Rita Skeeter was particularly tricky these days, and often had a spy reporter posted up at the bar to keep her informed of any strange meetings.</p><p>She closed the door of the snug behind her and hung her coat on the hook. He wore a green turtleneck jumper (because of course he would) and a pleasant smile on his much-matured face. Hermione set the ring box on the table between them as she sat. Draco took a sip of his tea and hummed.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said. “Mother would’ve killed me.” He tucked the box into his own coat.</p><p>“It seemed like I didn’t really have a choice,” Hermione shrugged. Draco poured her a cup of tea and slid it across the table. “Priceless family heirloom, and all that.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s worthless,” he said. “It’s just a copy. But what if you sold it to Rita Skeeter or Merlin forbid <em> appeared in public wearing it </em>; I would be crucified.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “If this is the set up for a blood-purity joke, I’ll just be going--”</p><p>Draco touched her arm. “No, no. I’m sorry. I’m insufferable this morning, just ignore me.”</p><p>Hermione took a sip of her tea and considered him over the rising steam. He hummed something to himself and opened a muggle newspaper, as if nothing had happened this morning that was in any way unusual. He had quite a handsome face, now. His skin was wrinkling around the eyes and mouth, which went against his childhood propensity for constantly scowling. He must’ve been making up for that, lately.</p><p>She grew impatient. “So you accosted me in Covent Garden, because…” </p><p>He didn’t look up at her, but he chuckled. “Because I saw you take that scarf without paying for it, and so did the bobbies.” He sipped his tea.</p><p>Hermione blanched and looked down at the painted silk scarf, which was draped guiltily around her neck. “I didn’t even realize…”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I was distracted--”</p><p>“I saw that.”</p><p>“I have to go back and pay for it!” Hermione stood, bumping the table and upsetting the teacup into her own lap. “Bollocks!”</p><p>Draco slid out of the snug and grabbed a rag from Tom to mop up the tea, which had soaked his newspaper and the knit doily that adorned the table. Hermione charmed her skirt dry. Thankfully, wool was forgiving. She sat down again, defeatedly. Draco returned with a small plate of biscuits, adiosed the wet newspaper, and then refilled her cup. “Don’t fret about the scarf,” he said. </p><p>“I’m not a thief,” Hermione said softly. “I’m just… ugh! Nevermind.”</p><p>“I took care of it,” Draco said. He pulled a different periodical from a black case, something to do with muggle plant life.</p><p>“You did what?”</p><p>“I paid for the scarf,” he said. “Told the shopkeeper that I had whisked my girlfriend away so quickly that I had caused her to take the scarf by accident. I apologized on both our behalf.” Hermione narrowed her eyes at him and he glanced up at her. “What? It’s mostly true.”</p><p>“You didn’t have to cause a scene, Malfoy!” Hermione huffed. “You could’ve just said ‘oh, I noticed you didn’t pay for that, insert-derogatory-comment-about-purity-here’ and had done with me.”</p><p>“I have a flare for the dramatic,” he said. “And I am not a blood purist anymore, no matter how much you insist it.” He folded up the magazine and sat back. “Besides, if I had walked up to you in public for the first time in twelve years, would you not have Avada’d me on the spot?” He was smiling as he said it. She couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>“Excuse me, jelly-legs jinxes are much more my style,” Hermione said. </p><p>“Then I think we can both agree that theatrics were necessary, in this case.” Draco opened his magazine to an earmarked page. “Oh! Pitcher-plants. They are bizarre!”</p><p>“Why were <em> you </em> in Covent Garden?” Hermione asked. Draco smirked.</p><p>“Buying back that ridiculous fake emerald from Les Néréides,” he sighed, rolling his eyes. “<em> Someone </em>--I won’t say who--thought the best way to get back at me for breaking off our engagement was to sell the Malfoy nestegg to a muggle jeweller who wouldn’t know its significance. Good thing I didn’t give her the real one, eh?” He turned the page and another article caught his attention.</p><p>“How much did you have to pay to get it back?” Hermione asked. Draco scoffed.</p><p>“More money than it’s worth and less money than your new scarf,” he said. “What were <em> you </em>doing in Covent Garden, besides absent-mindedly nicking scarves?”</p><p>“Christmas shopping,” she said.</p><p>“For your husband?” he asked innocently, but his eyebrow raised.</p><p>“Haven’t got one of those,” she said. “I was shopping for Molly Weasley, and I just… got to thinking about <em> my </em>mum somehow, and--” Hermione stopped and drank a deep gulp of tea, despite the temperature. She wiped her mouth. Draco put his magazine away and leaned forward. </p><p>“And what?” he asked softly. “Did you lose your mum?”</p><p>“Not in the way you’re implying,” she admitted. “I… obliviated my parents. During the war. So, they’re not a part of my life anymore. But mum… she loved silk, she used to watercolor. In her spare time. She would’ve liked this one,” she said, fingering the silk at her neck. “And… I don’t know why I told you that.” She swiped at her eyes and sat up straight.</p><p>“I touched a nerve,” he said sadly. “I am sorry.” Hermione shrugged.</p><p>“This time of year is fraught for me,” she said. “I have the Weasleys though, and Harry. Still have a chosen family.”</p><p>“That’s more than I can say,” Draco said, but he was almost… cheerful about it. Hermione must have made a face of pity because he held up a hand. “Now, now. I am perfectly happy with my Yuletide shawarma tradition. And now that I’m not engaged to a Parkinson, I’ll be able to actually <em> enjoy </em>myself. Heck, I’ve never done any of those odd Christmas-tide things that apparently muggles enjoy… Pansy found them infantile. Maybe I’ll go ice skating.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Parkinson, eh?”</p><p>Draco shrugged. “I was weak.”</p><p>“We’ve all dated people we regret,” she said sympathetically.</p><p>“At least I didn’t date Ron Weasley,” he teased. Hermione tossed a biscuit at him, but she laughed. Draco ate the biscuit she had tossed. The tension was dispelled.</p><p>Draco leaned back with crossed arms. He was smiling at her so sweetly, it made Hermione blush. He had grown into one of those weird self-assured adults who keeps really good eye contact and Hermione was having many, many, conflicting feelings about it.</p><p>“How many people are left on your shopping list?” he asked.</p><p>“All of the Weasleys, so that’s nine,” she said, counting on her fingers. “Luna, Neville, my assistant… so twelve.” Hermione cringed. “I’ve been procrastinating.”</p><p>A queer look crossed Draco’s face. He leaned forward and clasped his hands on the table. “I will help you finish your Christmas shopping.”</p><p>Hermione blushed. “I don’t need you to do that--”</p><p>“I don’t mean pay for them,” he said quickly. “Just help you pick them out.”</p><p>“Why would you do that?” Hermione asked.</p><p>Draco shrugged for the millionth time. “I have really enjoyed myself this afternoon.”</p><p>“Okay… and what do you get in return?” Hermione asked. “If history is any indicator, you’ve always got an angle.” But she smiled when she said it because she couldn’t stop herself. It was completely involuntary.</p><p>“Well, that is true…” he agreed with a chuckle. “Show me how muggles do Christmas.”</p><p>“You want to observe muggle culture--in the wild?”</p><p>“Not just that--I want to participate.” He rested his head on his hands and made his best pleading face. “I’ve heard it requires jollity and I’m up for the task.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head. Well? Why not? This day couldn’t get any weirder and she did have to admit that she was enjoying herself, even if Draco seemed confunded. “All right. For every present you help me find, I’ll show you one muggle Christmas-related thing.”</p><p>“Haha! Excellent!” Draco stood and pulled on his coat.</p><p>“What, right <em> now </em>?” Hermione asked. Draco grabbed Hermione’s coat and held it open for her.</p><p>“Christmas is in four days.”</p><p>“Good point.” Hermione stood and slid her arms into her coat with Draco’s help. They set out down the street, each with their coats buttoned to their chins.</p>
