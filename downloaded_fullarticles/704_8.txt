  <strong>Happily Married AU, angst, hurt/comfort, some years after the battle of Hogwarts, nightmare-centric. Sort of T-rated probably? :-)</strong>

  <b>Night Terrors #1</b>
</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Sleep has never come easily to Harry, but these days, he supposes, on the whole, that he's almost glad of it. When he does sleep it is lightly - again it always has been - but he supposes he is glad of that too. Some nights, like tonight, he finds himself staying awake long after Draco has fallen asleep, just sort of knowing it's going to be one of those nights. It's cold, for starters, and there's a breeze coming in from under the window. If it was up to him, it would be open a crack to let the air in – stuffy bedrooms have not been a thing for him ever since the cupboard under the stairs. He knows it's been about fifteen years but in these ways, as in so many ways, that cupboard has never quite left him - or he has never left it.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Anyway, he doesn't get to sleep with the window open; Draco prefers it closed and he'll grumble if it's otherwise, and, as more or less per usual he gets his own way, just like he got his own way about the light they leave on in the hall all night because he <em>just prefers it that way. </em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He's scared of the dark and they both know it, but Harry would not actually be mean enough to say so, just like he would never actually have argued that one. The dark, he thinks, even after all this time, even when to all awareness there is nothing lurking in it, is still a thing to be feared and he cannot blame Draco wanting that hall light.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He does not blame Draco for anything. He hasn't for years now, even before they were married.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Here it comes, he knew it would; a whistle of air from between the window panes, the nearby rush of the sea carried in on it, a whimper and Draco stirs in his sleep, clutching the duvet – most of the duvet actually, but like with everything Harry does not really mind – actually he keeps a spare pile of blankets next to his side of the bed for when he finds himself totally uncovered at night and utterly unable to prise even a corner out of the tight little bundle in the bedclothes. Then after the whimper a soft little moan; a choked, frightened noise and a pained swallowing sound. The noise that comes out when you're trying to scream in the dream, but you choke on it and the strangled sound hisses up from the throat. It starts. He rolls over, kisses the head that starts to turn on the pillow, hair like feathers, skin like moonlight, like trying to take care of a sliver of starlight.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western"><em>It's alright, </em>he whispers, <em>it's alright, shhh love, sshhh it's alright.</em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Sometimes this is enough, if not immediately -</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">
  <em>It's alright, I'm here, I've got you, you're safe.</em>
</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Sometimes. Not today.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Next comes the twisting, jerking away from him, fighting with the sheets until the skin beneath Harry's fingers feels sweaty and shivering, as though the battle with the blankets is a losing one, inarticulate noises too that rise into a recognisable <em>nononononononono.</em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He will never not hate this. He will never not be there, never shy away from helping.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Don't let it eat me!”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco sits up awkwardly, staring with wide frightened eyes, looking around him wildly as though <em>it </em>could be there in the room, in this cottage in the South Downs where nothing terrible or evil has ever happened. He looks surprised to find nothing there, but still stares at Harry with those wide open, scared and wondering eyes that do not understand <em>anything </em>right now, and his breathing is ragged, coming out in gulps like he is trying not to scream. Sometimes the screaming part <em>is </em>next, sometimes it goes on for a long time and Harry bears it because he gets it, because he has heard his own soul scream like that enough times himself. Sometimes, after all, this all goes the other way around, but not as often. He's been building walls against the things that hurt him since he can remember; Draco hasn't. He's made himself hard in so many ways with all those walls; Draco hasn't. He simultaneously finds it adorable and despairs at his beloved's fragility. It does not matter; love, he has come to reason, is not a series of weights and measures, not when it goes both ways- it is not a balancing act, it is what the other needs when they need it, what each cannot help but to give, in the end it always evens out, no matter what.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">So, not the screaming this time. This time Draco bursts into tears and throws himself face forward into Harry's chest, holding on for dear life, and it's like he's rescuing him from that burning room for the millionth time. He knows now, after so many years, that they will never stop rescuing each other; they do so again every day, over and over again.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco cries messily, somehow this is a shock to Harry every single time; he still hasn't forgiven himself for the first time he saw Draco cry; how could he forget, after all. He should have stopped at least for half a second to ask what was wrong, rather than just, <em>I know what you did </em>and an attack he realises now was not remotely deserved. Maybe that's why he supposes he <em>has </em>to be there every time now – because he could never let this boy cry alone in a bathroom again, even if the boy is nearing thirty. He's still such a child when he cries, it rips at the heart like a frantic creature scrabbling at him.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">So he holds him, so he rocks him gently like a child, so he strokes his hair and lets Draco hold on too tightly and he feels himself almost cry himself because Draco has this effect on him, he always has – when he's sad, he is sad, when he's happy Harry smiles, if he's angry – well that one is perhaps more of a problem, since when he is angry Harry finds himself getting angry too, and they clash, they clash, they still clash a thousand times a day, waves breaking on the sand, each of them the water each of them the land.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">And Draco shakes and shivers like the air before a storm, and Harry fears for the thousandth time that the mischievous snatch of cold air from outside might steal him away, but he never lets it and sure enough eventually he gulps and hiccups his way to a simple sniffling, wiping his nose on Harry's pyjama sleeve and making a little <em>heh </em>sound of pitiful amusement when Harry sighs about it. Finally he tries to talk, to explain himself, he always feels as though he needs to explain, excuse, deny these moments -</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“It was – it was -”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“I know,” he says, because he does, he can recognise just about every one of Draco's nightmares by now, but Draco has to say it anyway, as though naming it is at least something he can do towards facing the fear -</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“-the snake again – Professor Burbage -”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry nods because he guessed that already. Because he has carried Draco through this one a hundred times. He knows that sometimes he is the one being eaten by the snake, sometimes Draco is being eaten himself, sometimes it's his mother or his father or anyone he has ever loved – sometimes it simply happens exactly as it happened – it is just their old Muggle Studies professor who Draco never even liked. And sometimes, that is part of the whole problem – he knows this because Draco feels the need to say her name every time it's her – as though he killed her himself. Once he told Harry that he had – or at least he might as well have, it all jumbles together in Draco's head until he's the worst person that ever lived and there was a time – they both know it, when Harry would have said that was true. A time when Harry was an idiot.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He thought Burbage was an idiot. He has told Harry many times, like this, curled up and sniffing in bed, half shaking, half still crying. He mocked her in school, scorning her classes – which he never actually attended - her appearance, her mannerisms, her views. He would have hated her, he told Harry, if he had considered her worthy of even that consideration. He thought she was ridiculous, backwards, a joke. He did <em>not – </em>and Harry had to wheedle this out of him like untangling jewellry – ever think she deserved to die, and he certainly did not want her eaten by a snake. In fact Draco, Harry realised only after a very long time, never did, never would, wish anybody dead and hated physical violence, backing off from it every time like you'd back away from a slug.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">(“I mean except that time you kicked me in the face,” Harry pointed out on one occasion when the mood had lightened enough for him to do so.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“That's different -” Draco had waved it away with an airy flick of the wrist - “You have an extremely kickable face, Potter.”)</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“It was my fault,” he said, more than once - “All my fault.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“It was <em>not,” </em>Harry said firmly, his first impulse the easy need to dissuade him from this train of thought because it is so obviously ridiculous and self destructive. But he can see where it comes from – he saw their teacher killed – right there on the table in front of him- he could have touched the body just before the snake unhinged her jaw. He would probably have nightmares about witnessing something like that himself – he <em>does </em>have nightmares about every killing curse he has ever witnessed – so yes the next <em>logical </em>step – having been in no position to be permitted to cry or scream or even react at the time – was to blame himself, start screaming at night and develop an absloute terror of snakes (which is a whole extra level of shame for a Slytherin, Harry has long since discovered).</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“You didn't do it, Draco. Voldemort did it. You're not to blame, not for anything.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He knows Draco will never believe <em>that, </em>but if he says not <em>anything </em>he hopes the overkill to Draco's mind might at least register as there being <em>something </em>he's not to blame for.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">This time at least, when Draco stops crying, he does not seem to need the usual reassurances, and perhaps that's something at least; besides, it's been three nights since the last nightmare which might actually be a record. Small steps, Harry thinks. He just lifts his face from Harry's top, grimaces apologetically, half guiltily -</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Did it again,” he mutters - “Sorry.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Harry shakes his head, because he doesn't need to be sorry and he doesn't need to tell him that.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“S'been eight years – should be over it by now.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Should you?” Harry raises an eyebrow as aggravatingly as he knows how – “Didn't know there was a rule book, Malfoy, you must have nicked it back in first year.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Draco's mouth twists back into the old smile, the real one, not the sneer or the smirk, but the one from the boy who first offered to be friends; second name terms is always their code, as it it were, that things are alright again, the disdain with which they say them a humorous parody of what it once was.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“Shut up Potter.” Draco kisses him on the cheek - “Go to sleep.”</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western"><em>Yeah, </em>Harry thinks, curling around his idiot protectively, Draco wriggling for a tedious length of time, packing blankets around himself, clutching a pillow, and wriggling his back against Harry's chest <em>forever </em>until he finds the right place where they fit perfectly – <em>I will now. </em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">Outside and down through the fields, the waves crash gently upon the shingle; somewhere out over the sea the gulls call sleepily in the dark each to each. The wind whispers lovingly through the old stone walls and the blankets are soft, the bed warm and Harry smiles because there is so much to smile about – there was a time he never imagined there could be. In the warm dark of shadow and the gold of the hallway light he nods off halfway to sleep -</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“<em>Potter -” </em>A little voice whines, “ - fix the <em>window – </em>there's a <em>breeze.”</em></p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">He almost yells. <em>If I didn't love you, </em>he thinks – <em>I would hate you beyond measure. </em>He trails a hand under his pillow for a wand -</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">“<em>Fenestra repare,” </em>he sighs.</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">__x__</p><p class="western"> </p><p class="western">
