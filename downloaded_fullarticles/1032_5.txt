    <p>This was a hunt. Not the normal hunt that I would take a skull or hide; I would be taking a mate. A life long mate for the rest of my days. I had sired multiple pups and they went on to be proven and capable hunters. I am an Ancient my age is that of maybe 1500 years give or take a century. I was headed to the planet Earth in search of a suitable mate and i did not care for the gender as I have sired many pups. </p><p>My hunt started in a place called Scotland and I was disappointed at the oomans there. All to soft, not worth my time or even a decent trophy. I made my way farther north and ended up in a large, dark and dense forest.  Now this was a hunt! Large 8 legged things and many of them came at me and I took them on and gladly took multiple and various trophies from them (mainly the fangs). There were other creatures here but they left me alone and I left them alone. </p><p>I then saw a large stone building in the distance and many oomans there. This must be a large community of them and many of them are pups of various ages. Hmmm, this was getting interesting but I shall stay back for now and observe. </p><p>***Time Skip***</p><p>There is an ooman male coming this way. Tall, pale, and wearing all black. Odd, but the pups make a path for him, so he must be a Blooded or an Elder. Interesting, I shall observe him. </p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p>More ingredients. Those dunderheads are wasting the ingredients. There are clear instructions on how much everyone needs and even then they are so stupid to ignore it. At least there is a ready supply of the moss I need not to deep in the forest. It is quiet in the forest...to quiet. I have been in here too much to realize when the environment has changed. With the war over I am still glad I have my sense of survival but it is sad that the older students do as well. I may not like them but I will protect them. <br/>_______________________________________<br/>What do you all think?</p>
