DISCLAIMER!
I do not own Harry Potter or any of JK's chars. I just play with them, I make no money and get nothing from this. I am just a Fan of her amazing world.

This is not a story for the faint of heart. It will get worse before it gets better. There are some trigger warnings right up top: non-con, Force, abuse, mental abuse, entrapment, angst, pain, slow burn. The non-con is NOT Harry related at all. There is Ron Bashing. Deal with it. </p><p>Now, I want to say thank you to my wonderful beta, alexandertheII who has somehow reigned in my grammar and typos like a freaking champ!  Any mistakes, screwups, etc are mine. And many thanks to the Harmony and co-writing group on Facebook. You all are the bomb!</p><p>Updates will be random as this is a difficult piece to write and is a work in progress. </p><p>It will be finished though. I have ZERO plans on abandoning my work. </p><p> </p><p>The reasoning behind the name of the Story:</p><p>The reason why I decided on this name is Three-fold. </p><p>One: Britain is known for being tied to Roses. Examples:  the British war of the Roses, the Tudor rose, the term English Rose which is A very pretty English girl who tends to wear little or no makeup, has pale rosy cheeks, natural hair and is well-spoken and ladylike. </p><p>Two: Titanium is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength that is used in jewelry, watches, art and in medical devices and medical equipment. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-karat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-karat gold and is more durable than pure 24-karat gold.</p><p>3: It’s playoff the Southern prase Steel Magonia which means:  ( mostly Southern United States term) A woman who exemplifies both traditional femininity as well as an uncommon fortitude.</p>
