    <p>Harry sighed, balling his hand into a fist and crumpling the letter he held. Dumbledore had started up his Occlumency lessons again. Well, there went the rest of his vacation.</p><p> </p><p>He'd defeated Voldemort a few weeks ago, just days after his seventeenth birthday. However, killing him had unexpectedly thrown the link between them wide open, and the backlash had severely damaged Harry's aura. He was constantly channelling spirits, being possessed, and just couldn't seem to keep himself in his body. The channellings and possessions he could live with, but the out-of-body experiences were... Quite dangerous to his sanity, really. He had witnessed some pretty vile things through them, and could no longer meet the eyes of either Dumbledore or Professor Binns.</p><p> </p><p>Hopefully, he'd master Occlumency quickly, so that he could fill the void and keep himself to his body (and keep his body to himself).</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Severus sighed as Harry stormed into his office. Weeks of fighting back-to-back had not made them friends, but arguing with each other was now something they did out of habit, rather than any real malice. "Potter," He drawled. "I need to be able to see your aura. Do I have your permission?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. "Do you <em>need</em> it?" He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Severus ground his teeth. "Well, as I am not a licensed healer, <em>yes</em>, actually, I <em>do</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. "Fine. Go ahead."</p><p> </p><p>Severus murmured a spell, waving his wand over Harry's body. He sucked in a breath, his eyes widening. "Impossible. How are you still alive?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. "I survived the Killing Curse, didn't I? I'm really fucking lucky." He replied cheekily.</p><p> </p><p>Severus sighed. "Language." He chastised, circling Harry slowly, examining the aura fully. There was a huge hole over the chest, and several tears in various other places, making the boy frighteningly vulnerable to mental attacks. Strangely, though, the hole looked older than the tears. By a few years, in fact. If he was completely honest with himself, it looked like it might have been there since the boy turned fifteen, making him... But no. Dumbledore would have noticed, and he would have said something.</p><p> </p><p>"You'll need to learn Occlumency before I can teach you to fill the gaps, because you'll need to be able to see them yourself, and Occlumency will allow you to make sense of what you see in your mental landscape, which is the only way for one to see their own aura.” He explained.</p><p> </p><p>Harry groaned. "Bloody wonderful. What are you waiting for?"</p><p> </p><p>Severus sneered at him. "Legilimens!" He flew into Harry's mind--and bounced back out just as quickly as he had gone in. The feeling reminded him of bashing his head against a brick wall. It was painful, it was difficult, and it was <em>not working</em>. He recovered and hummed in satisfaction. "Very good. When did you finally learn to Occlude?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. "What? I didn't. That is to say, I <em>can’t</em>. Shouldn't be able to, at least."</p><p> </p><p>Severus frowned. "Legilimens." He murmured and slid in, testing the barrier he found. It was, strangely enough, opaque, completely obscuring his view of Harry's mind, which was impossible to create by one's self, but was common enough for Vorago. "Dear Salazar." He breathed. "You really <em>are</em> a Vorago. I am only stunned that we didn't discover this sooner."</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. "First off, I'm a <em>what</em>, now?"</p><p> </p><p>Severus smirked. "You are not human." He explained.</p><p> </p><p>Harry groaned. "Yes, you old bat, <em>that</em> much I understood. But what the bloody <em>fuck</em> is a Vo... Thing?" He asked, waving his arms around, gesticulating wildly.</p><p> </p><p>Severus calmly cast Petrificus Totalus. "One: detention with me for a week when school starts, for cheek. Two: <em>language</em>, Mr. Potter. Three: a Vorago is a magical creature that has a naturally-occurring hole in their aura. It appears when they come into their powers, at fifteen years of age. I daresay, you are apparently a special case. Instead of being drawn to those people that would fill your aura while in the dreamscape, you seemed to gravitate more to the Dark Lord. Perhaps that is because of the bond you shared. That may also be the reason I was able to get into your head, when I can't now. We were linked through the Dark Lord's mark, to your scar." He let the spell up so that Harry could respond.</p><p> </p><p>Harry groaned. "Why me?"</p><p> </p><p>Severus chuckled. "Because if one chapter of your life closes, another must invariably open. You are, after all, the Boy Who Lived." He said softly, holding back laughter.</p><p> </p><p>Harry glared at him. "What is this 'hole' thingy about?" He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Severus sighed. "You really need to work on your vocabulary." He responded unhelpfully.</p><p> </p><p>Harry growled. "Why do I have a <em>hole</em> in my <em>aura</em>, <em>Sir</em>?" He hissed.</p><p> </p><p>Severus smiled. "Because you are a <em>Vorago</em>, you <em>idiot</em>." Severus responded in an acidic tone.</p><p> </p><p>Harry growled. "I mean, how do I get <em>rid</em> of it?" He snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Severus sneered. "You don't 'get rid of it,' idiot boy. You <em>fill</em> it."</p><p> </p><p>Harry blinked in confusion. "With what?" He asked softly.</p><p> </p><p>Severus sighed. "With help from three to seven people. You'll know who those people are by how you feel when they pay <em>any</em> kind of attention to you."</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. "<em>How</em> will I feel? Sir." He quickly added.</p><p> </p><p>Severus smiled. "It will feel almost as if it is sustaining you, which it is, in a way. Without having at least one of these people around you for long periods of time, you will become lethargic and begin to sicken. It's a wonder you made it this far, really. One person you draw from must still be here." He smirked. "Which means, it's one of your professors. For <em>shame</em>, Potter."</p><p> </p><p>Harry blushed. 'Shit. It <em>can’t</em> be...' His heart stopped in shock, then began pounding. 'It <em>is</em> him.' He thought in despair.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh." Was all he could think to say.</p><p> </p><p>Severus sneered. "It's probably that werewolf. It must be wonderful for you to have him back, even if it is only for one year."</p><p> </p><p>Harry blushed. "Sure." He muttered, unwilling to admit that the person who most closely matched Snape’s description was the Potions Master himself.</p><p> </p><p>Severus blinked in shock as Harry suddenly stiffened, clenched his eyes shut, shivered, then relaxed, opening his eyes and letting his whole body relax. When he spoke again, his voice was deeper, and he sounded bored. "Much better. Hello. You are... Severus? You're the current Potions Professor, correct?"</p><p> </p><p>Severus sneered. "Wonderful. The boy gets himself possessed at the <em>best</em> times. So, who am I speaking to?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry smirked, and the expression looked strangely at home on his face. "Salazar."</p><p> </p><p>Severus's eyebrows rose. "Indeed? A pleasure, really. Why have you chosen to take him over now?"</p><p> </p><p>Salazar looked him over. "Hm. I just wanted to see for myself who my Heir's Matches would be. I’ve found myself, thus far, highly unimpressed." He said, turning to leave the room.</p><p> </p><p>Severus blinked in shock. "We weren't done with our lesson." He protested.</p><p> </p><p>Salazar turned to sneer at him. "You are now." He said.</p><p> </p><p>Salazar left, heading up to the room he could feel Harry's aura being drawn to. Soon, the Vorago would learn how to tap into his powers and let them lead him to his Matches, but so far, the ability was beyond the teen.</p><p> </p><p>Which left Salazar free to do as he wished with the ability.</p><p> </p><p>He headed into the headmaster’s office, feeling the presence leave just as he neared the stairs. He headed up the stairs and entered the headmaster’s office. “Albus.” He spoke sharply.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore turned, smiling. “Ah, Harry has gotten possessed again. I take it he has not learned Occlumency yet?”</p><p> </p><p>Salazar sneered. “Impertinent muggle-loving buffoon. Shall I seal your mouth shut to get you to listen to me?” He asked silkily, pulling out Harry’s wand.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore sighed, seating himself behind the desk. “Always a pleasure, Salazar.” He said gravely. “To what do I owe this visit?” <br/> <br/> Salazar’s eyes glowed with cold fury. “I <em>told</em> you I didn’t want <em>my heir</em> growing up with Muggles. I <em>warned</em> you that they wouldn’t understand what was normal for him and what wasn’t. I warned you that they wouldn’t even <em>care</em>, and yet, you failed to heed my warnings. Now, see what your sheer idiocy has wrought, <em>Headmaster</em>.” He swept the wand over Harry’s body, spitting the last word as if it were a curse.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore’s eyes widened. “Oh, dear.” He breathed.</p><p> </p><p>Salazar sneered. “<em>That’s</em> all you have to say? The boy is a Vorago that has been without his Matches for two years now!” He seethed. “I’d think it would be a bit more alarming to you!”</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore sighed. “Well, I cannot change the past. But I can rectify the situation late, at least.”</p><p> </p><p>Salazar snarled. “See that it isn’t <em>too</em> late, you sorry excuse for a wizard.” He hissed, then swept out of the room, calling the man a few inventive words in Parseltongue.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Harry opened his eyes to find that he was sitting in the library surrounded by books on Vorago, already opened to certain pages. He sighed. “Looks like Rowena gave me a homework assignment. Oh, joy.” He said sarcastically, pulling one of the books to him and starting to read.</p><p> </p><p>He paled at the first thing he found out. The hole was supposed to be fed by <em>sexual</em> attentions for best effect.</p><p> </p><p>‘No. No, no, no, no, no, no! I am <em>not</em> having <em>sex</em> with <em>Snape</em>! The two words don’t even belong in the same sentence together!’ He thought, groaning at the fact that his cock seemed to disagree.</p><p> </p><p>He continued reading, dreading what he would find out.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>The parchment was covered in ink spots and scratched-out phrases by the time he was finished reading, but Harry finally felt that he had a grasp on just what exactly he was now.</p><p> </p><p>He would need to find his other… ‘Matches,’ soon, unless he really did want to sleep with Severus.</p><p> </p><p>Looking over the parchment of notes, he realized that this explained a lot of how he had changed after fifth year.</p><p> </p><p>If a Vorago manifested, which would happen on their fifteenth birthday, and didn’t properly bond with at least one of their matches within the first year, they would become depressed, irritable, apathetic, and would lose appetite, sex drive, not that Harry’s had ever been raging, and ability to concentrate, as well as looking generally worse than they could. It also tended to affect stature.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, Harry’s ability to concentrate had been shot ever since Voldemort’s return, but it was nice to know that now it wasn’t his fault.</p><p> </p><p>He sighed and checked the time. “Shit!” He whispered, grabbing his notes and leaving the books out as he ran up to Gryffindor Tower, back to his empty dormitory, at one AM.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Harry blinked, frowning. “Where the hell-”</p><p> </p><p>“What are <em>you</em> doing in my bathroom, Potter?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry turned and his mouth fell open as he stared at Malfoy. He was dressed in nothing but a tiny silk robe, which hid <em>nothing</em>, and he was sopping wet, skin still pink and moist from a bath, apparently. “I… You… How?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco sighed in disgust. “If you could get <em>out</em> of my dream, I’d like to go get buggered by the latest wet dream the universe, in all her wisdom, has decided to bestow upon me.” He narrowed his eyes. “Or, maybe, you’re <em>supposed</em> to be here, hm? Are <em>you</em> my dream tonight? I must say, this is a welcome change. I’ve been waiting for you to show up for a <em>while</em>. Although, I’d much prefer to have you repeatedly, in the flesh, but we do what we must.” He murmured, stepping behind Harry to press against his back and slide his hands under the shirt, fingernails scraping over Harry’s nipples as Draco removed the shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Harry gulped, his erection springing to life. “Malfoy-”</p><p> </p><p>“Please, <em>do</em> call me Draco.” The blond purred, licking Harry’s jaw lightly.</p><p> </p><p>Harry whimpered. “Draco, what are you doing?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>“What you were brought here for.” The amusement in the blond’s husky voice was apparent, and Harry felt his face heat.</p><p> </p><p>“Dray, maybe this is a little too fast to be moving-” Harry’s voice broke as Draco’s hand cupped his erection through his trousers, rubbing firmly. He was aware of his head falling back and his eyes fluttering shut as he sucked in a breath through his teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Dray?” Draco whispered. “I think I like that. Tell you what, Golden Boy. <em>You</em> can call me Dray whenever you like. It’ll be something just between us. Of course, it’ll never happen in real life, but this will suffice.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, hips jerking erratically. “O-okay!” He agreed.</p><p> </p><p>Draco took his hand and led him to the bed. “I want to bottom.” The blond whispered. “For you. I’ve never bottomed before, though.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry flushed. “I don’t think that’s a great idea, Dray. I’m a virgin. I don’t know what to do.”</p><p> </p><p>The blond’s eyes opened wide. “Why does even my <em>subconscious</em> make you a bloody virgin?! No one else ever was!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry blushed. “I… Don’t know. But I <em>am</em>.” He whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine.” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “I’ll top you, then. But if you ever show up in my dreams again, I want you in me, got it?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughed at the irritation in his voice. “I think I can manage that.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco growled, grabbing Harry’s wrist and dragging the teen into his bedroom. He shoved Harry onto the bed and climbed on it, crawling over Harry, removing the rest of his clothing with a speed that surprised Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“Whoa! Calm down! I don’t think I’m- Mmm…”</p><p> </p><p>Draco smirked against Harry’s mouth as he slowly fisted the teen’s cock, muffling his protests with his mouth. ‘Merlin, but he’s responsive! I wish this could really happen, but with father’s plans for me to give the family an heir and settle down with a nice, Pureblooded Witch, it never even stood a chance. So I’ll take this.’ He worked Harry’s prick slowly, watching his own hand as it stroked the length, pre-ejaculate beading on the tip.</p><p> </p><p>Draco swallowed, licking his lips, as he felt an urge he had never experienced before: the urge to lick up that drop of fluid. ‘What the hell.’ He decided finally, ‘It’s not like this is real. I can do whatever I bloody well want!’ He leaned down and lapped up that droplet, sighing. “Delicious.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s hips jerked upwards and he gaped at the blond. “Are you fucking <em>serious</em>?!” He squeaked.</p><p> </p><p>“Deadly.” Draco purred. “You taste like ambrosia. I want more.” That being said, Draco went to work accomplishing his desire. He dove down on Harry’s shaft, taking it into his throat all the way to the root, then back up to swirl his tongue around the ruby head.</p><p> </p><p>Harry moaned, throwing his head back in pleasure as his hands grasped at the sheets desperately. “Fuck, Dray!” He squeaked. “No one’s ever- Nng!” He nearly swallowed his own tongue when Draco took his cock all the way into his throat and <em>growled</em>! “Shit!” He squeaked, then came.</p><p> </p><p>Explosively.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s eyes widened as he pulled off of Harry’s cock quickly, coughing and wiping cum off his chin. “How rude, Potter!” He snapped, glaring at the teen. “Here I am, doing you a favour, and you <em>come</em> in my <em>mouth</em> without <em>warning</em>?!” He sneered. “How… Amateurish.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry huffed, staring at the wall, cheeks tinted pink. “Well, I <em>am</em> a <em>virgin</em>.” He reminded Draco.</p><p> </p><p>Draco sighed. “That will only get you so far, you know. But I’ll let it slide this once. How long do you take before you can go again?”</p><p> </p><p>“With the right motivation, five minutes.” Harry’s cheeks turned a deeper shade of pink as he spoke.</p><p> </p><p>Draco smiled happily. “Oh, <em>good</em>.” He purred. “Let’s see if I can… Motivate you.”</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Harry’s hands were pinned above his head and he was being kissed with a fervour he would never have associated with the cool, aloof Slytherin Prince. He moaned helplessly, writhing as he felt himself harden again.</p><p> </p><p>Draco pulled away as he felt the hardness forming against his thigh. “Oh, <em>nice</em> work, Potter!” He said, impressed. He ran a single finger over the bottom of Harry’s prick. “That was <em>really</em> fast.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry blushed. “Um, thanks?”</p><p> </p><p>“That was definitely a compliment. And you are <em>very</em> welcome.” Draco purred, grabbing the lube his dream had supplied. He lubed his fingers and grabbed one of Harry’s toned legs, shoving it against the Gryffindor’s chest. “Hold that for me, yes?” He asked, then slowly worked a finger into Harry’s virgin entrance.</p><p> </p><p>Harry hissed, clinging to his leg with both arms. “Ow! That <em>hurts</em>!”</p><p> </p><p>Draco slowed, but didn’t stop. “Trust me, you want this part over with. It only hurts this bad the first time.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, sweat beading on his brow. He panted through gritted teeth, whimpering every time Draco went too deep or too fast.</p><p> </p><p>Draco was as careful as he could be, preparing Harry thoroughly. Once he was done, he removed his fingers and positioned himself. “Ready for me, Baby?” He asked, combing a hand through Harry’s hair gently and locking eyes with him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry gulped. “Yeah.” He replied.</p><p> </p><p>“Push back against me.” Draco whispered, pushing forward.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Harry woke as a loud alarm rang in his ears. He cursed, grabbing his wand, and cancelled the spell. “Fuck!” He buried his face in the pillow, then realized he had a problem to take care of. He rolled onto his back and slipped a hand into his boxers, imagining that it was Draco touching him instead. He replayed the encounter in his head, climaxing violently with Draco’s voice calling him ‘Baby’ ringing in his ears.</p>
