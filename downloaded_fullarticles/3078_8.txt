          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco hadn’t noticed Harry returning to the salon, and Draco was grumbling at the remote so Harry hung back with a grin spreading on his face. Finally, Harry’s compassion won out.</p><p>“Power’s not on.”</p><p>Draco started, “wha - huh?” He looked up at Harry and dropped the remote as if he could hide what he’d been doing.</p><p>“You have to turn the television on before you push the other buttons for channel and volume and such.”</p><p>Draco, exasperated that something seemingly simple was so difficult, picked the remote back up and held it out to Harry who’d made his way back to the sofa.</p><p>“You do it then,” he exclaimed.</p><p>Harry took the remote and turned the television on to see <em>8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown</em> beginning.</p><p>"See this button here? It looks like the Deathly Hallows minus the cape. That’s the power button.”</p><p>Draco huffed and laid down on Harry‘s lap ready to start making magical words out of the nine provided letters.</p></div>
