          <div class="userstuff"><p>The note in my hand shows me where to go.<br/><br/><em>Meet me in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. </em><br/><br/><br/></p><p>I don’t like to meet in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. It’s cold and dirty. ‘Cold and dirty, but safe’ is what he’d say. And it’s true, nobody ever comes there. So I go along with it, because our little secret needs to stay between us, because there would be no more us if things became public. I don’t even want to imagine what his family would do to him if it got out that I’m in a relationship with Draco. Or worse, what Voldemort would do to him.</p><p><br/>The door creaks. The floor is wet. Squeaky sounds fill the air until I stop walking. There he is, my beautiful boyfriend, standing at the mirror and looking fine with his crazy blond hair and silver-like eyes. But the red surrounding the grey tell me he’s not feeling fine. This is something I know. Draco is never fine anymore.</p><p><br/>“So what is this all about?” I whisper, even though there is nobody around. It just became a habit - always whispering when we’re together. Careful, always.</p><p>“It’s the Dark Lord. He has my mother.”<br/><br/>The whole situation is not totally unexpected. Both me and Draco knew that Narcissa was a target ever since she refused to cooperate with Voldemort. “What happened?”<br/><br/>“I don’t know. All I know is he has her.”<br/><br/>“We will get her back.” Easier said than done, but Draco is so upset and my first priority is calming him down, no matter what.<br/><br/>“He will kill her if I don’t do what he says.”<br/><br/>“And what did he say? Let me help you.”<br/><br/>Draco shakes his head. “I can’t.”<br/><br/>“I get it, Draco, you’re scared.”<br/><br/>Draco shakes his head again. “You know nothing, Potter.” It’s unsurprising that he disagrees with me: he’s Draco Malfoy after all.<br/><br/>“Are we back to last name basis again?” No answer comes from Draco. A sigh escapes me because this whole situation must be so hard on him. But I know how to handle these types of situations.<br/><br/>“You know I love you, right?” I whisper.<br/><br/>“Stop it.” Draco is shaking all over. It’s painful to watch him like this, hurting like this. I want to hold him in my arms, take care of him. I will say that everything will turn out okay in the end. It will not be completely true, but it’s what he needs me to say.<br/><br/>“We can get through this together.”<br/><br/>“We can’t. Not this time.”<br/><br/>I simply smile. There is so much love for Draco in my heart and I know we’re meant to be together. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Anyone who tries to put a stop to that is my enemy. Draco doesn’t realize how much I love him, but I will make him see one day.<br/><br/>While the capture of Narcissa is somewhat unsurprising, the fact that Draco points his wand at me is. He has never been violent towards me after we became a couple. I ask him what he’s doing, but I do so calmly, because I am one hundred percent sure that Draco will listen to me. He always does. He will put down his wand and we will walk out of this mess, hand in hand. We will face the enemy together.<br/><br/>“I don’t have a choice,” Draco whispers. His arm trembles so bad that he might drop his wand.<br/><br/>“You always have a choice. You just need to be brave to make it.”<br/><br/>“You’re right, Harry,” Draco says and he suddenly looks determined. “Avada Kedavra”.</p></div>
