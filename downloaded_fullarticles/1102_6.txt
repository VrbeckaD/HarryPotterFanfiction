<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Hermione was in the living room of the Weasley's. They were so kinds to her, taking her in as their own family. Ever since the war ended Ron has been her rock. He was by her side every step of the way because he knew that she'd erased her parent's memories of their own daughter for protection. She was depressed and overwhelmed with all the kindness everyone was being towards her. The war did a number on her, yesâ€¦. But not being able to go back to her parents? That was something she couldn't deal with. They were her parents! She was staring at the fireplace feeling numb while Harry this time entered with a tray of tea cups.</p>
<p>"Would you like some tea, Hermione?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>She didn't do anything. Ron still had his hand over hers and looked up at his best friend. He frowned. "No movement from her since she got here." He whispered.</p>
<p>Her head was spinning in circles. She kept on overthinking her plans. Come on what was she missing? She thought. She suddenly jumped and rushed towards her room. Maybe it was in one of her books? Her two best friends rushed after her, "Hermione! Wait!" Ron said then they halted.</p>
<p>Her and Ginny's room was a mess. It was full a books opened everywhere and she was kneeling on the ground trying to look for the cure for the lost memories. What was she missing? She threw one of her books across the room and Ron rushed by her side hugging her.</p>
<p>Harry looked around, he wasn't sure what he was seeing until he saw it. Memories. "Hermione?" He asked slowly. "Are you trying to bring back your parent's memories? You know it's irreversible for a reason. It can mess with their minds." He said then walked slowly towards her and knelt beside her. He placed his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Ron's eyes went wide and looked around the room at the books. "Blimey Hermione. Was that what's bothering you?" He frowned. He didn't know what to say. He was just cradling her in his arms back and forth. Hermione nodded slowly.</p>
<p>Her voice cracked from not saying anything since the war. "I-I need them." She whispered. "You have your parents, Ronald." She paused then placed her hand on her chest. "I don't." She spat angrily.</p>
<p>Ron's eyes went wide. "Which is why my parents took you in." He took a deep breath and exhaled before he could say anything he'd regret.</p>
<p>"I think if I don't find any other option that could help. Going back into time would be the only option." She said while standing up.</p>
<p>"I won't allow you to do that!" Harry said. "That would jeopardize your parents! The whole main reason you did this in the first place was to protect them! Don't ruin that by going back into time. I beg of you!" Harry said while pleading.</p>
<p>"Harry's right, if you do go back into time it could change history. There is a chance that we won't win the war." Ron said then he wiped a tear from her eyes. "Let's think rationally and find better ways. I'm sure there is something." He said then kissed her forehead.</p>
