    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Aurelia was hanging around off a corridor by the entrance hall when it happened. </p>
<p> She was supposed to be in Potions class right now, but she had never really had the patience for Potions, coming near close to failing each year. She had made the decision to skip class on her way to it, when an overwhelming gust of exhaustion towards the subject swept over her and she decided to ditch. </p>
<p> That, and she felt it was important to be close to the entrance hall at this moment, due to an unexplainable urge that Aurelia was unable to pinpoint. </p>
<p> A group of people had entered the school, bringing with them cool October wind and the loud chatter of many different conversations being held in close proximity to each other. It was a group of roughly six people, being headed up by someone she recognized instantly: the current Minister for Magic, Herald Minchum, a tall a brooding wizard with a tuft of jet black hair and cool grey eyes. </p>
<p> Minchum was walking side-by-side with who must have been his assistant. A tall, lanky redhead was hurrying to keep up with the fast-paced Minister, a notebook and quill in hand, seemingly copying down whatever the Minister said to him. </p>
<p> As for the people leading up the pair of them, she had no idea. Two chatty witches were examining a copy of the Daily Prophet together, their little heeled shoes clacking on the floor as they strolled by, looking around at the Entrance Hall as they did so; a bored looking wizard followed them, his pale white hair slicked back. Aurelia knew at once who he must be: Abraxas Malfoy, Lucius Malfoy’s father. </p>
<p> Her eyes had just swept to the members of the group besides Malfoy, when the very same person suddenly darted their gaze over towards her, hiding partially behind a pillar. She had thought for a brief second that she had recognized him- but no. He couldn’t be who she assumed he had been, there was no way. </p>
<p> Aurelia broke eye contact with the stranger and pulled herself around the corner of the pillar, heart beating fast, clutching her messenger bag to her chest and holding her breath, her eyes slammed shut. </p>
<p> Surely, even if he wouldn’t recognize her, as a sixth year, when he had only known her at age 11? Surely even if he had recognized her, he wouldn’t dare bother leaving the company of the Minister to speak to her? </p>
<p> Of course, she was being silly, dreaming up such fantasies in which her childhood crush remembered her and was now enchanted by her growing beauty. Obviously he’d continue on doing whatever he had come here for. </p>
<p> She had to remind herself that it probably wasn’t even him, and opened her eyes to find him right in front of her. </p>
<p> She swore she could feel herself blush, and it wasn’t being helped by the curious yet playful look he was giving her. It was more than definitely who she had thought it was. </p>
<p> Although he had a new haircut, a good few years on her, and was much taller and much more muscular under his suit, he was instantly recognizable by his bold features. She wondered how old he was now...</p>
<p> Aurelia was too busy doing mental math to hear him when he opened his mouth to speak to her. She couldn’t look him directly in the eyes, so looked at his chest instead, staring at the scaly pattern on his black tie. </p>
<p> “Pardon?” She asked, trying not to sound awkward or scared. </p>
<p> “I asked what you were doing out of class, it's only-” he stopped to check a silver watch on his wrist “10:16. You should be in a class right now, which one is it?” he asked her, as if he had the authority of any professor in the school. His expression wasn’t angry or berating, it was merely as if he found her slightly amusing, and enjoyed exercising authority over her. </p>
<p> At the haughtiness of the question, Aurelia felt her temper flare up, and decided in a vicious train of thought, to pretend she didn’t recognize him at all, “Who are you to tell me where I should and shouldn’t be?” she asked in an angry whisper of a voice. </p>
<p> His eyebrows shot up, and an even more playful look danced across his face, “I used to be head boy of Slytherin, now here on official ministry business. I suppose I could alert the Headmaster to the fact that a little student is out and about, skipping class, it would look bad on me to just leave you out here,” he paused with a grin, “But I’m willing to let it slide if you head back to class. Again, which one is it?” </p>
<p> He was twirling a knob on his watch as he spoke, and Aurelia was momentarily distracted by it. </p>
<p> Oddy enough, the confidence in his voice was really agitating her. She hated the way he thought being head boy years ago meant he had any control over her now, and so many feelings were bombarding her at once that it was easiest to channel it all into anger. </p>
<p> She laughed at him. “How generous of you. I think I fancy a stroll through the grounds though, Potions really was never my strong suit,” she alluded, realizing all too late that she had made a mistake. </p>
<p> Suddenly, he looked as if struck by a bought of deja vu. He opened his mouth and then closed it again, drawing her attention to his lips…</p>
<p> “You can’t be little Aurelia Grindelwald?” he asked slyly, looking all the more interested in her now than he had been before. His eyebrows dipped together in a familiar bemused expression. </p>
<p> “Stop calling me little, Yaxley, honestly that’s twice now.” </p>
<p> “Oh,” he exclaimed, surprised, “So you are Aurelia, and evidently do remember me.” His voice was low-toned, slow, and slightly rough. His accent was more scottish than english, and it was doing things to her.</p>
<p> “What gave it away?” </p>
<p> “The attitude. Always were a brat.”</p>
<p> “Hey! You really are a prick, coming over here to specifically tell me to get back to class as if you’re a professor now-” Aurelia stopped dead and had a horrible thought. </p>
<p> “You’re not...here to become a teacher, are you?” she asked, heat rising to her neck and cheeks. </p>
<p> Yaxley looked like he was about to laugh at her for a second, but never did. “No, I’m not in that particular branch of work.” </p>
<p> “Yeah I could tell from my early years,” she remarked snidely, not sure why she was being so harsh with him. Probably because he intimidated her immensely, and she couldn’t even imagine having a casual conversation with him. </p>
<p> Yaxley raised his eyebrows, but still looked calm, “Brat.” He said softly, annunciating every syllable on his way through the word. Aurelia just glared at him, feeling something in the bottom of her tummy squirm around pathetically.  </p>
<p> “Go back to potions, it’ll look bad on Dumbledore to have you wandering around when you’re supposed to be receiving your education. Between you and me, the Minister is doing an inspection of the school while he’s here. You could be detrimental to that,” he finished, fixing a cuff on his sleeve. His links were two snakes, the gleam of jagged pieces of emerald where their eyes should have been. </p>
<p> Aurelia snorted and before she could check herself, responded “I can think of a load of things I’d rather be receiving right now than my education. I don’t care about the Minister, or what he thinks of Hogwarts.” <br/> He raised his eyebrows again, but didn’t look at all playful anymore. </p>
<p> “Thats rich, the little Grindelwald thinking she can afford to skip potions. Everything you learn will be on your NEWTS,” His voice was especially deep now.</p>
<p> “I swear I will hex you so hard your mother feels it if you don’t stop referring to me as little,” she snapped, making to push around him and towards the main entrance, a walk on the grounds with the cool breeze might help her nerves. </p>
<p> “If you act at all like you did when I tutored you,” he continued as if having never heard her, although she wasn’t literally walking away from him “You’ve got a lot of work to do.” </p>
<p> “Act like what?” She asked, suddenly affronted by his words. He had meant to goad her with them, to keep her inside the castle, but she couldn’t help but be annoyed. </p>
<p>Yaxley looked satisfied now, as if he had achieved what he had meant to, “Don’t act an idiot purposefully, we both know potions wasn’t what you paid attention to during those sessions.”</p>
<p> Aurelia knew she went a brilliant shade of red then, and realized that her banter back and forth with him had only confirmed what he seemed to have suspected- she had fancied him, and maybe seeing him again had reignited that little flame in her belly. </p>
<p> Except this time round’ it was much worse, considering she was a fair bit more rascally, and much more provocative. She wanted him to do things to her. Bad things, dark things, things that might make her scream. </p>
<p> Instead of voicing all of that, she said “Wow, you really are full of yourself, aren’t you?” <br/>Yaxley laughed at her, a low, good-natured, good-sounding chuckle that vibrated all the way down to her heart. </p>
<p> “You’re young, so I know you like to play games,” he offered, advancing on her a little bit. She noticed he was wearing a waistcoat under the suit, it looked silky and heavenly to touch. She resisted the urge to reach out. </p>
<p> “-But I don’t. I can’t make any advancements towards you, you’re much too young for that, and you’re aware of that.” He finished, not looking stern despite his words. </p>
<p> Aurelia felt whatever had been steadily blooming in her chest die and rot like a neglected bundle of flowers. </p>
<p> “So-” he started again, that playful look back in his eyes, “It appears the ball is in your court, isn’t it Aurelia?” he asked in a sultry voice, the use of her name causing her to feel like she would melt into an Aurelia-shaped puddle if he kept it up. </p>
<p> Then all of the sudden, she caught onto his meaning. He would not make advancements on her- of course not, it would be disastrous for his reputation and career if she refused, and made a fuss about it. Now she was deliberating on whether or not this meant he would accept advancements if they came from her. </p>
<p> She had a vivid fantasy cross her mind of dragging him into a nearby classroom and begging him to have his way with her. It was all very scandalous. <br/>Shaking it from her head, she told herself to be realistic, but allowed herself to ask a burning question first. </p>
<p> “How long are you here for?” she inquired, trying not to look too interested. </p>
<p> He smirked at her, “Three days, we planned to stay at Hogsmeade but the Headmaster offered to house us here. Aurelia?” </p>
<p> “Yes?” she squeaked, the fire inside her belly suddenly alight again as she realized- three days was a long time. </p>
<p> “Go back to potions,” he said, and this time, it did not sound playful. It sounded like a demand, something that would be unwise for her to disobey. </p>
<p> “Okay,” she whispered, trying to think of something to say to drop a hint to him subtly. Then it hit her. </p>
<p> “One more thing- then I’m gone to, learn or whatever. Did you ever come across the room of requirement when you were here?” </p>
<p> He was quiet for a minute, eyes searching her face, seemingly contemplating her. “No, I can’t say I know of a room of requirement. Class.” He ordered, and turned around on her to catch up with the minister. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                                                                                                                 *** </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Aurelia spent the rest of the day daydreaming her way through class. </p>
<p> During lunch she slopped soup down her front upon noticing that Yaxley and his ministry crew had taken up residence further down the Slytherin table, and were speaking to a couple of first-years. </p>
<p> She did absolutely everything she could not to catch his eye, and left as soon as she was done eating. Because of this, she’d been early to History of Magic, and her presence had apparently caused Professor Bins to start teaching, despite the fact that she was the only person in the classroom. </p>
<p> The rest of the day dragged on wearily, and by the time supper rolled around, Aurelia found she didn’t particularly feel hungry. Opting out of dinner, and promising Emma and Hellia that she was fine, just not hungry, she opted for a quick, albeit rule breaking, walk around the grounds. When the cold got too much for her numb fingers and toes, she retired back to the Slytherin dungeons. </p>
<p> “Sopophorous,” she said to the stone wall, and the door to the common room materialized. She stepped through, and to her horror, found Yaxley sitting on one of the leather sofas, a couple of other ministry officials with him. Heat rose to her wind bitten cheeks. They were drinking, some of them wine, some butterbeer, and Yaxley had a glass of firewhiskey. </p>
<p> The only light in the room was the fireplace, and over to the far wall, a seventh year studying under the light of one of the floating lamps. The eerie green light from the lake flooded the common room, giving it the chilling yet familiar feeling the room always gave Aurelia. </p>
<p> When the stone door closed behind her, Yaxley looked over to her and raised his glass a little, just for her to see. She blushed, and hurried over to the left hand corridor, a short hallway that lead to the dormitories, just in time to see him smile to himself. </p>
<p> It felt massively unfair, him being able to invade the one place in the castle that she was  safe. She had thought the ministry officials would be staying in a separate area of the castle, not the students dormitories. </p>
<p> She quickly pranced up the black plush carpets on the small spiral staircase that led to her dormitory, and yanked the door open, throwing herself in as if Yaxley had been chasing her. </p>
<p> She collapsed on her four poster, idly staring out the window to the great lake that rested above Alexandria’s bed, and wishing she could stop hearing the scuttling of the other girls’ spiders in their aquarium. </p>
<p> Aurelia used her wand to shut the curtains of her four poster, and immediately cast the imperturbable charm, to keep out the scuttling noises. </p>
<p> Once in the darkness and silence, she elapsed into thought, wondering if it was any use to head to the room of requirement tonight, or if it would be a wasted trip. She knew a shortcut Slytherin students used to hang out with their Hufflepuff friends, them only being a level up after all. </p>
<p> No, she wasn’t afraid of being caught, she was afraid of going there and having him show up. It was as if she was at war with herself, every rational part of her telling her irrational parts that it was inappropriate and irresponsible, and that he wouldn’t want any part of her anyways. </p>
<p> Yaxley had to be 22 now, not old enough to be truly inappropriate, but enough so that she was afraid her age made her that much more likely to be rejected. </p>
<p> But there was a heaviness to her stomach that she couldn’t shake off, she wanted to know what it felt like to be touched by him in all sorts of inappropriate places. </p>
<p> Drifting off to thoughts of that very same thing, Aurelia was asleep long before her dorm mates returned, and when they saw the curtains shut tight around her bed they did not wake her. </p>
<p> When she awoke later, a feverish glance at her nightstand told her it was 1am. She pushed her velvet curtains aside and reached on her nightstand to find the pitcher of water that normally sat there, enchanted to stay cool, but found nothing. </p>
<p> She grimaced to herself, and quietly got out of bed, tiptoeing over to the door, Hannah’s snores keeping her steps mostly muffled. </p>
<p> She kept the door propped open, and once outside became aware of how chilly it was outside her dorm, and how she had only thought to come out here in a long t-shirt with the weird sisters plastered all over it. Her feet still had socks on them, preventing her from freezing when she got down the staircase and touched the black stone floor. </p>
<p> To her surprise, a low fire was still going in the common room, and someone was silhouetted in its light, a glass in his hand that reflected the flames. </p>
<p> She rubbed her eyes in confusion, the students had class tomorrow, it would be unusual for someone to be sitting up, still awake and down here this late at night. </p>
<p> But when they turned to face her, her stomach started doing cartwheels. It wasn’t a student at all, but Yaxley, apparently having never moved from earlier. </p>
<p> She stopped short, very conscious of her bare legs, and thankful that her shirt was a couple of sizes too large- she wasn’t even wearing a bra. </p>
<p> “What are you doing awake?” he asked her, twirling the contents of his glass around one-handedly. He didn’t sound stern, but quiet, contemplative. </p>
<p> “I, um...I just came out for a pitcher of water.”</p>
<p> “Don’t they automatically refill?” he asked her, an amused expression on his face. </p>
<p> “Mine was apparently stolen by one of the rascals I live with,” she said, grinning awkwardly, still feeling incredibly sleepy. </p>
<p> “I missed you at dinner earlier- you weren’t in the great hall,” he observed, watching her walk over to a skinny table against the wall and pour a silver cup full of water.</p>
<p> Aurelia sipped it awkwardly, “I wasn’t hungry,” she said plainly, “I came up here and fell asleep,” she then admitted. </p>
<p> He regarded her, “Heavy sleeper, I would have assumed your rascals would have woken you. They made quite the noise when they came through earlier,” </p>
<p> “Imperturbable charm,” she said at once, refilling her glass. </p>
<p> “You can cast an imperturbable charm?” he asked, voice disbelieving.</p>
<p> “Of course,” Aurelia said, wondering why he didn’t believe her. She could do much, much more than a simple imperturbable charm. </p>
<p> “I don’t believe you,” he said, grinning at her when he saw the anger that danced across her face, “I’m sorry, but I still have trouble with them. I find it difficult to believe a sixth year can cast one flawlessly.” </p>
<p> Aurelia shrugged, not really in the mood to hype herself up or show off for him. She was getting very tired again, she almost wanted to abandon the conversation and go back to her warm bed. She wanted his hands to touch her, but without so much conversation. He made her feel like a prey animal. </p>
<p> “Cast one for me, would you?” he asked her, a dangerous look on his face.</p>
<p> Without thinking, Aurelia raised her hand towards her dorm and said “Accio wand.” </p>
<p> Her wand flew from her bedside table and directly into her outstretched hand. She caught it, and was about to cast the charm when Yaxley was suddenly in front of her, eyeing the hand she had used to catch her wand. </p>
<p> He was almost breathless when he spoke, “Did you just do wandless magic?” he asked, hand touching hers almost as if he thought it was priceless. </p>
<p> “Yes?” Aurelia whispered, afraid to move a muscle. His hand on hers made her feel like she was falling a thousand miles per hour. She let him take it and move it closer to him, as if he could understand her magic in the lines of her palms. </p>
<p> The look he gave her was one unlike anything anyone had ever given her before. “You realize how extraordinary that is?” he asked her.</p>
<p> “It’s really not hard,” she started, “It’s a matter of realizing that the wand does not make the wizard, the wizard makes the wand. You’re magical, your wand is simply a catalyst. Your hands can be too, and-” </p>
<p> “Nobody can cast wandless magic, not at will like that. Not as specifically as that. That's not making snow fall from the ceiling in a fit of rage, that's something else entirely,” he murmured, half to himself. </p>
<p> Aurelia felt suddenly guarded. She tried not to do wandless magic in front of anyone but her dorm mates, after Dumbledore had told her how odd it was that she was able to do it. How people would react, knowing who her father was. But she had known magic like this since she was a baby. It was hard to conceal. </p>
<p> “Don't tell anyone,” she whispered suddenly, blue eyes meeting his golden ones in the dim light of the common room. </p>
<p> “Only if you'll teach me how,” he said playfully. </p>
<p> When Aurelia didn’t smile, he did. </p>
<p> “I'm only joking. It doesn't take a genius to guess where you learned.” </p>
<p> Suddenly, an overwhelming amount of sadness overtook Aurelia. She felt like curling up in a ball to cry. </p>
<p> “It wasn't him,” she said suddenly, voice surprisingly steady, “Everyone always credits all my achievements to him. He never taught me wandless magic; he can't do wandless magic anymore than you can,” she revealed, not understanding why it was so easy to talk about all of this with Yaxley, of all people. </p>
<p> He regarded her thoughtfully, but didn't say anything. Aurelia was about to speak again when her words caught in her throat. </p>
<p> His sleeves were rolled up, his suit jacket thrown over the back of a couch lazily, the waistcoat still looking very touchable. But the thing Aurelia was the most focused on, was his left forearm. </p>
<p> Her blood froze in her veins when she understood what she was seeing. With her heart in her throat, she reached out slowly, and took his hand. </p>
<p> Yaxley looked surprised, but didn't pull away. When she turned his palm to the ceiling, the flicker of the firelight illuminated a dark tattoo, twisting up the length of his forearm. </p>
<p> It was a snake. But it wasn't just any snake, and sleeping in his dormitory a few feet away, Regulus had the exact same tattoo, in the exact same spot. </p>
<p> As if bristling like a cat, Aurelia backed up away from him, arm falling out of her grasp and back to his side. </p>
<p> “What is that,” she whispered, trying to pretend like she didn't already know. </p>
<p> Yaxley gave her a strange look, the first time he had looked at her like that all day. Something about that look hid nothing. All the emotion that had been hidden behind those golden eyes was out in the open. </p>
<p> “You should go back to bed, Aurelia.” </p>
<p> “They got you too,” she remarked, all the excitement about seeing him vanished. It was replaced with the familiar dread she felt whenever she thought of her father.</p>
<p> “It's not that simple,” Yaxley sighed, moving back around the sofa to sink into the deep green cushions. He picked up the glass of firewhiskey abandoned on the coffee table, and downed it in one shot. </p>
<p> “No?” Aurelia asked, a sudden burst of fury firing through her, “How is it then? Some graduated Slytherin makes you promises of greater magic and you let him mark you like cattle? That sounds pretty simple to me.” </p>
<p> Yaxley settled her with a surprisingly annoyed glare. </p>
<p> “Nobody has branded me. I joined an order that exists to ensure the survival of pureblood families. Like yours,” he said cooly, in a clear attempt to make her empathize with him. </p>
<p> “My family?” she asked, affronted that he would even bring them up. She folded her legs underneath her on the sofa, beside him. </p>
<p> “My family is a mix of two of the most well known pureblood lines to ever exist. And they're the reason I hate pureblood wizards. Nothing in the world could convince me they're worth saving.” </p>
<p> When she looked up at Yaxley, he looked almost as if in pain. This war is tearing everyone apart, Aurelia thought sadly. </p>
<p> “I could convince you, if you'd let me,” he said, sounding for once, like he wasn't sure of what he was saying. </p>
<p> “Regulus has one,” she whispered, brushing her fingers across the mark. It was risen slightly on his skin, like a fresh tattoo, “I don't know when he got it, or who gave it to him. But I do know it's going to be the death of him.” Aurelia whispered quietly. </p>
<p> Yaxley looked as if he pitied her. She didn't want his pity, she wanted her best friend back. And she wanted to go back to this morning, before she had seen. </p>
<p> “You would fit right in with us, you know. Someone as bright as you, who can do the things you can.” </p>
<p> Aurelia shook her head sadly, “I wouldn't,” she insisted, “Regulus might, but I can't fight for fascists.” </p>
<p> “That's not what this is,” Yaxley insisted. </p>
<p> “You might fix your words so they're pleasant to the ears, ‘'Ensuring the survival of purebloods’ is just a nice way of saying that you're against the survival of muggleborns.” Aurelia knelt up and brushed a stray piece of hair out of his eyes. Her hand trailed down his face as she leaned in to lightly kiss his forehead. </p>
<p> “Goodnight,” she bid him, as she stood from the couch and made her way to her dormitory. </p>
<p> “Aurelia?” Yaxley called after her. When she turned, he actually looked drunk for the first time all evening. She was held in the perpetual silence of his pause, the weight of it crushing her so much she could barely stand to breathe. </p>
<p> But when he spoke again, all he said was "Sweet dreams." Before turning back to the dying fire, wand twirling to refill his glass. </p>
<p> Aurelia's feet hit the plush carpet on her stairs numbly. She felt a thousand years old, when only minutes ago she had been a teenage girl. All her body ached for now was bed. Dreamless sleep.</p>
