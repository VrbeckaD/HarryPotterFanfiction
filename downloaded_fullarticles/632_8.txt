    <p><em>-july 2019</em><br/>In a small terraced house in the center of London, Harry Potter awoke with a jolt. He shot up into a sitting position, breathing heavy and eyes wide in panic. He clutched a hand to his burning forehead, and attempted to recall the details of the dream he had just woken from. It was quickly slipping away, but behind his eyelids floated the image of a large abandoned house, a room with two men and a sort of strange deformed baby creature; and a blinding flash of green light. The people were talking about things he didn't really understand, stuff about wizards and magic and whatever the hell muggles were, but that didn’t make sense; magic wasn’t real. Uncle Vernon had drilled that fact into him enough times to ensure he would never forget it. None of this would have bothered him usually - nightmares were a common occurrence for him and they never meant anything - but this one felt… off somehow, like it was slightly more real than the rest of his dreams.</p>
<p>The pain in his head was subsiding, now just a weak throb, and he let any thoughts about the nightmare slip away. Squinting into the dark of his room, he reached over for his phone and checked the time. <em>3am</em>. He flopped back down onto his pillow with a sigh; he needed to be up in three hours. Despite the exhaustion weighing him down, it took a solid half an hour for him to fall back into an uneasy sleep.<br/>--<br/>Three years ago, to the great surprise of the entirety of the Wizarding World, Harry Potter never showed up to Hogwarts. This was particularly disappointing to a young Draco Malfoy, who had spent the majority of the first eleven years of his life fantasising about meeting him. He had heard all the stories - the boy who stopped the Dark Lord when he was only a baby (imagine how powerful he must be!) - and had meticulously planned their first meeting. It would be on the train to Hogwarts (much better to find him then, it would give them hours to talk before they even got to the school!), he would search the train for him with Crabbe and Goyle in tow (to show off his power and influence), mention his family’s status (the most famous person in the entire wizarding world would surely want to choose his company based on their prestige, after all), and offer his hand (a polite gesture; a sign of mutual respect). It was the perfect plan, and he had no doubt at all that it would work and he would claim the great Harry Potter for himself; which is why, on September 1st 2015, after searching the train up and down multiple times with still no sign of the boy, he had a <em>bit</em> of a temper tantrum. Admittedly not the best way to start his school life at Hogwarts, but there wasn’t much he could do about it now.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that no-one knew where Harry was. It was well and truly a mystery for the entirety of Wizarding Britain. Not even the headmaster knew what happened to the boy. Two days before the beginning of term, after receiving no owl from Harry in acceptance of his place at the school, Dumbledore had ventured out (apparated) to the Dursley house, only to learn they had moved out years ago, with the man never being informed. None of the devices used to track the boy were working, and after many long months of searching, they eventually lost hope. The Wizarding World resigned themselves to the fact that their hero would likely never appear, and began to ask if he even existed in the first place. Perhaps Lily Potter killed Voldemort instead. Or maybe, Harry was killed that night too, and the tales of the Boy-Who-Lived were merely rumours blown way out of proportion.</p>
<p>The lack of a figurehead to represent the end of the war made many people uneasy, however, and the fears surrounding the possibility of the Dark Lord still being alive and out there crept up steadily throughout Wizarding Society. There wasn’t actually any proof of his downfall, despite his sudden disappearance and the claims of his demise, and the one person who would have reassured the public (after all, nobody who Voldemort wanted dead ever came out alive) was mysteriously missing. They were in a time of peace, there was no doubt about that, but people were becoming more and more sceptical of how long it would last. Which brings us to now.</p>
