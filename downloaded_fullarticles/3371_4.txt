    <p>When Narcissa raised and then lowered her fork for the fourth time, Lucius finally huffed and said, “What is the matter, <i>lossetári</i>?”  </p>
<p>She hesitated.  “Draco has not been home for three days.”  </p>
<p>“He is likely off at one of those Quidditch tournaments with friends.  You know they would leave everything behind if one of them suggests a new venue.  The house-elf has not reported of any harm, has he?”</p>
<p>“No...”</p>
<p>“He has not sufficient cunning to have discovered that you spy on him—”</p>
<p>“I do <i>not</i> spy on my son!”</p>
<p>Lucius raised a brow.  “And how <i>would</i> you describe your use of the mirror?”</p>
<p>Narcissa sniffed.  “I merely use it to ensure he is living comfortably.”</p>
<p>“If you are that concerned, I wonder that you allowed him to move out of the manor.”</p>
<p>It was Narcissa’s turn to raise a brow.  “I seem to recall that a certain young wizard begged his mother to purchase a luxurious flat for him as his coming of age birthday gift so that he could flirt with his many young witches without interference.” </p>
<p>“<i>Witches?</i>  How our memories become muddled as time passes.  I only ever brought <i>one</i> witch to my ‘luxurious flat’.  You seemed quite content to be away from your mother’s watchful eye at the time.”</p>
<p>“Not as much as you, darling.”</p>
<p>Lucius harrumphed.  “At least I was mindful of my duties—”</p>
<p>“Is he not deserving of some choice after all that has happened to him in the past five years?”  </p>
<p>Lucius stiffened.  He bit back a retort as tears began to form at the corners of Narcissa’s eyes, despite her glare.  He sighed, shoulders uncharacteristically slumped, and said, “I have only ever wanted to ensure his safety and place in our world.  But the path he has chosen…”</p>
<p>“—Is still of his own choosing.  It is not his wish to oppose you, Lucius, but times have changed, and we must learn to adjust.  She may be the key to smoothing his path ahead.  They are merely dating, after all.”</p>
<p>Lucius raised both brows.  “He has not brought her back to the house? I find that astonishing.”</p>
<p>“Of course he has, but they are not co-habitating.  I have placed strong anti-contraception charms on the house, besides, so you need not concern yourself about violation of the succession rules.”</p>
<p>“Do you know my mother placed a charm on my flat so as to ensure that our son could only be conceived here in the manor?”</p>
<p>“Why, that—”  Narcissa took several breaths to calm herself.  “I’m surprised she allowed us to remain in the flat for the first two years after Draco’s birth.  How did you manage it?”</p>
<p>Lucius smirked.  “I believe <i>you</i> managed it by ensuring he was constantly fussing or crying whenever we visited.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t the faintest idea what you mean and resent the implication that I would inflict any harm on my son in order—”</p>
<p>“No, but our visits too often coincided with his scheduled meal and nap times.”</p>
<p>Narcissa smiled mischievously, finally unable to keep her composure.  At the insistent tug on her hand, she settled into her husband’s lap and laid her head on his shoulder.  </p>
<p>“We were happy those first few years, weren’t we, Cissa?”</p>
<p>“Mmmm.  Draco could as well, if we allow him the time and space to decide his future.  You know he has always needed your approval.”</p>
<p>Lucius sighed.  “I don’t deny that she could open doors that would otherwise remain closed to us, but even if we did not oppose the match, <i>her lot</i> will offer much greater resistance—”</p>
<p>“Yes, dear, but we will have appeared to be supportive, and they could not accuse us of holding onto prejudices…”</p>
<p>Lucius sighed again.  “Very well.  <i>If</i> this ridiculous relationship does turn into more than a passing fancy, I will endeavour to be more civil.  She will need to prove herself capable of assuming the role of the next lady.  I’m not convinced—”</p>
<p>“Of course, dear.  Did you think I would hand the mantle over to her without first testing her?”</p>
<p>Lucius smirked.  “My father never appreciated the sharp mind behind the pretty face, but I always have.”  </p>
<p>He kissed her before she could respond.</p>

  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>“Harry, what year did the Ministry make it illegal to hunt hippogriffs?”<p>“Dunno.  Ask—never mind.”</p>
<p>“If I could, I wouldn’t be asking you.”</p>
<p>“Ask your brother Percy, then.”</p>
<p>“The git sent me a Howler last time, remember?”</p>
<p>“Then check the Ministry library… and don’t ask the Head Librarian.  She hasn’t forgiven you for damaging that book on Pacific Ocean magical flora.”</p>
<p>“That means I’ll have to talk to her git-faced assistant.  Bugger.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>“Well, do you know which store she usually buys them from?”<p>“Merlin knows!  I can’t even navigate that Underground system of trains.  And doesn’t she always go to a different one every year so as not to repeat the selection?”</p>
<p>Susan sighed.  Sunday Brunch at The Burrow was organized chaos at the best of times, but when it coincided with Midsummer, the planning involved grew exponentially in complexity.  And it was times such as these that she really missed Hermione’s management abilities.  Her hand twitched again, the murderous desires to hex her mulish husband resurfacing for the umpteenth time.  </p>
<p>Ginny gave her a knowing look.  “After what they’ve gone through together, you’d think they could be more supportive of her choice.  But I suppose, having befriended two such idiots, it leaves one in some doubt of her mental faculties.”</p>
<p>Susan snorted.  “And what does it say about me that I <i>married</i> one of them?”</p>
<p>“That there’s definite truth in the phrase ‘love is blind’.”</p>
<p>Susan rolled her eyes.  “And deaf, too.  He’s waking <i>himself</i> up with his snores, you know.”</p>
<p>“Why do you think we kicked him to the attic?”</p>
<p>Susan laughed.  Then sighed.  “I think we need to make a list of what items we still need to purchase and where, and then contact the Muggle Liaison Office and request a guide into Muggle London.  Preferably one who <i>actually</i> knows how to navigate that labyrinth.”</p>
<p>Ginny reluctantly agreed, but as they began compiling their ever-growing list, she paused in mid-ramble.  After three prompts from Susan, she suddenly said, “Why are we bothering?  The best way to show those two <i>and</i> Mum how wrong they are is to let the celebration be a complete disaster!”</p>
<p>Susan’s eyes widened.  “Th-that’s brilliant, Gin!  Evil, to be sure, but brilliant!”  She suddenly laughed.  “And won’t Ron be cross when he realizes there won’t be any of those sushi rolls that he loves so much.”</p>
<p>“And Mum’s always depended on Hermione to bring the disposable plates and utensils so there isn’t so much washing up after.”</p>
<p>“Ginevra, you are a genius.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>“Sorry I’m late, girls!”  Padma leaned against the wall inside the restaurant’s foyer to catch her breath.  “Have you been waiting long?”<p>Ginny huffed.  “Almost half-hour now.  The <i>maître d’</i> said the wait was ten minutes, but that was more than fifteen minutes ago.  We’re debating going elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we’re quite certain the wait will be just as long everywhere else.  This is why we need Hermione to arrange things,” Pansy groused.</p>
<p>Susan nodded emphatically.  “We’ve been rather spoiled by her, haven’t we?”</p>
<p>“We certainly have,” said Padma.  “I didn’t realize how dependent I’ve become of her reminder alerts until I didn’t receive one, hence my extreme tardiness!”</p>
<p>“<i>Number 58, table for four.</i>”</p>
<p>“That’s us!  Finally!”  As she followed the staff member showing them to their table, Pansy called back, “Let’s get settled and order quickly!  I want to hear all about the disastrous Midsummer gathering!”</p>
