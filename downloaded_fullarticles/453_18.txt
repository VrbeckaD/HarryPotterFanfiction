  <p>Of Love and Basketball</p>
</center>Harry jumped back startled, when the door in Ron and Hermione’s hallway suddenly opened behind him.  He’d flooed over expecting to meet Ron, but when Ron hadn’t responded to his shouts, Harry’d assumed he hadn’t arrived home yet.  He’d been heading to the kitchen for a glass of water, unaware anyone else was home.<p> </p>
<p>He spun around wand at the ready, just in case, and came face to face with a half-naked Hugo. With nothing but a towel wrapped around his waist, Hugo was a replica of Ron fresh from the Gryffindor showers of thirty years past.  Tall and lanky, but with broader shoulders, Hugo looked uncannily like his father. With the same bright blue eyes that looked directly into the soul, and a smile that drew the world to him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was that smile--that open and infectious smile--that was so much like his dad’s that drew Harry in. Each wore their heart on their sleeve. Quick to anger, they were just as quick to forgive and forget.  Though, neither of them found it easy to apologise in word, actions coming more naturally to them.   There was never any subterfuge, they were what they were. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That smile expanded as Hugo realised who he’d almost crashed into.  Hugo had spent the past six months in New York, preparing for a new job with a financial advisory company. The year before that, he’d spent time in the Caribbean. Doing what, Harry wasn’t sure. Something to do with dolphins, he thought.  At least eighteen months had passed since Harry had last seen him. He had filled out a great deal since then,  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Uncle Harry!” Hugo cried excitedly, almost losing his towel only barely managing to catch it at the last moment, as he reached out to wrap Harry in a hug. “I didn’t know you were coming over.” He leaned in and nudged Harry with his shoulder-- his broad naked shoulder-- parked right next to his equally broad and naked chest. Harry’s breath caught at the intense maleness of the man who stood next to him. The heady fragrance of fresh mint shampoo, cleans and honest soap and the scented steam from the shower that permeated the air was undeniably Hugo, and undeniably male. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unaccountably uncomfortable at being this close to the embodiment of a desire Harry had held secret for decades, he took a step back.  It was now abundantly clear that with each passing year, Hugo had grown into a man ever more like his father. A fact Harry had somehow failed to notice until now, even though it had been happening under his own supposed constant vigilance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry had been completely and utterly in love with his best friend, Ron Weasley, since he was fourteen years old, only to have almost lost it all to Ron’s own envy and his constant fears of never being enough. All of it happening within the same two-month period, one of the most agonising and confusing periods of his life. Sure, there had been the whole Voldemort trying to kill him thing, but what value would his life have had, without his best mate by his side? Harry had known even then though, that Ron was straight and would never return those feelings. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s divorce from Ron’s sister had been finalised today.  The papers all signed, dated and recorded in the solicitor’s office just a few hours earlier.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A year ago to the day Ginny, his wife of twenty five years, had greeted him at the door with legal separation papers and request for a divorce. She was leaving him for the woman she loved; had loved for most of their marriage.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Incompatibility and failure to satisfy her sexually were the reasons Ginny had listed for the divorce.  Harry had had to struggle to withhold the snort that had threatened to burst out of him when he’d heard the charges. The same could be said about her as well. Of course, she didn’t know that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No one knew that. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that his divorce was official, Harry had every intention of getting completely snookered.  And if a nice, interesting and relatively handsome stranger--with a cock, a hard-muscled chest and broad shoulders showed an interest in him, well—Harry was going to return that interest in triplicate.  He wasn’t just coming out of the closet, Harry planned on barreling out of it, full steam ahead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron had agreed to accompany him to the pub, but Ron had no idea of what Harry had planned for after. His best mate still did not know that Harry was gay-- that was going to change tonight. Nor did he know that Harry was in love with him, and had been for years—<i>that</i> he was never going to learn. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shaking his head and clearing his thoughts as feelings and memories ran through him. In the few seconds it took between the reality of the overwhelming maleness of Hugo and Harry’s own realisation that his own reaction to Hugo had been completely unexpected and worrisome. Needing to put some space between them Harry pulled away. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>His expression puzzled, most likely from Harry’s sudden aloofness, Hugo drew back. Since he had been a child, Harry and he had always had a special bond, each of them the other’s favourite. Harry’s rejection had to have stung, yet Hugo just huffed in laughter, perhaps putting the sting of it behind him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking directly at Harry, Hugo placed his hand on Harry’s arm, squeezing the biceps lightly, but enough to notice, and asked with genuine concern, “Uncle Harry, everything okay? You seem to be sort of withdrawn today.” His hand on Harry’s arm loosened slightly, but did not let go. “Hey, I understand you’re a free man, once again. How are you feeling about that? Got any plans on getting your leg over tonight?” A slight waggle of his eyebrows, as well a soft and questioning smile, Hugo’s hand moved over Harry’s arm in a gentle almost unnoticeable caress. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s unusually strong emotional reaction to Hugo left him more than a bit confused. He had never had that strong of a reaction to Hugo before. He had no idea what to do with it. In response to Hugo’s gentle teasing, Harry laughed, embarrassed, and rubbed at the back of his neck. <i>Fuck, how had he known?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hugo barked in laughter, his own complexion slightly more flushed than usual. “Ah, looks like I hit that nail squarely on the head.” His expression going shy and tenuous, he leaned in, “Are you planning on sticking with the fairer sex, or are you looking to expand your field of opportunities? I understand it’s quite the rage to swing both ways at times like this.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry blinked, unable to answer. Desperate to change the subject, he turned and moved down the hall to the kitchen. “Did your dad happen to say when he’d be home?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hugo grabbed an extra towel from the linen closet and headed towards his room, roughly drying the thick and bushy ginger curls that spouted like a fountain from the top of his head. He called back over his shoulder.  “There were no messages indicating he was going to be late, but you know how things at <i>Wheezes</i> can go. Though, I can’t imagine he’ll be too long.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mum won’t be in until way late. She’s writing a new policy for the Ministry. Something about the danger to wizards from other places around the world, where being a wizard is dangerous. She wants to make sure Great Britain is a place for them to feel safe.” His voice moving further and further away, until finally, Harry heard only the sound of a door closing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once he’d reached the kitchen, Harry determined a glass of water just wasn’t going to cut it. He needed something stronger. Opening the larder door, he found several bottles of his favourite ale <i>The Alchemist Brewery Heady Topper </i>on the shelf. Grabbing one, he twisted the top off, tossed it in the rubbish bin and moved into the living room. He switched on the telly, and started flipping through the channels. The Granger-Weasley clan was addicted to Muggle telly, including the 24 hour a day sports channels.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry himself had recently become a rabid consumer of the sport of basketball. The half-naked men that ran up and down the court broad shouldered, hard and muscled biceps, along with rippling thighs and calves, sweat dripping from their faces and the sheen of perspiration may have something to do with the attraction. May have? Hell, the number of times he’d wanked during halftime and after the games had become too numerous to count. Even so, he found it an exciting sport, and had grown to appreciate the skill, not to mention the stamina it took to play it well. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having become enamoured of the game, Harry had decided to put a regulation sized goal of his own in the back garden.  Playing mostly by himself at first, he’d shoot the ball at the goal, missing more than hitting at first. Little by little he had improved. Eventually he began working on his ball control, with dribbling and passing practice.  Surprisingly, it was Penelope, Percy’s wife that played with him. She too, was a closeted fan of the NBA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After channel surfing a few moments, he found a live viewing of an early round of the NBA championship series, and settled in to watch, putting Hugo Granger-Weasley and how much he resembled his father, not to mention and Harry’s own surprising reaction,  firmly out of his mind. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Until just minutes later, when Hugo reappeared, dressed in a pair of cargo shorts that rested loosely against the sharp angles of his hip bones, only just managing to cover the dimples of his arse. <i>Oh dear lord, how was he supposed to deal with this?</i> Harry asked himself as Hugo, barefoot as well as shirtless,  plopped down on the sofa right next to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A perfectly good chair sat sitting completely empty, and with an excellent view of the television, not to mention the also totally vacant opposite end of the sofa. Why did he have to sit so close to Harry? Why? Why? Why?  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hugo’s shoulder was close enough to brush against Harry’s, and it was impossible to keep from noticing the similarities between father and son. Broad like Ron’s and while not tan by any stretch of imagination, Hugo’s shoulders were a pale golden colour, as if kissed by the son, and covered with freckles.  Harry couldn’t help but wonder how much of Hugo’s time was spent outdoors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stretched out in front of him, Hugo’s legs were lean and muscular; covered in soft ginger hair that did little to obstruct his multitude of freckles. The calves, full and rounded ended in ankles and a pair of long and bony feet with ridiculously long toes. Fascinated by them, Harry stared, his gaze settling on Hugo’s feet.  Harry, it seemed, had a foot fetish. How had he not realised it before now, or was it just Hugo’s feet that he felt this attraction to? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry grabbed the bottle and took a healthy swallow, then almost choked as Hugo crossed his foot over his knee bringing it even closer to Harry’s view.   <i>Oh, fucking hell! </i> This was torture. Exquisite torture, yes, but torture nonetheless. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Harry lowered his arm, Hugo reached out and plucked the same bottle from Harry’s hand.  “Here give me some of that. It’s so hot. Can you believe it’s only April?  Why is it so hot, in April? I mean this is England we’re talking about. I’m dying here. I thought the shower would cool me off, but I don’t know, it doesn’t seem to have worked.” Side-eyeing Harry has he spoke, Hugo then placed his lips, full and soft (or so they looked to Harry) on the same place on the mouth of the bottle that Harry’s lips had just been. Almost like a kiss, separated only by the glass of the bottle, and the seconds between the two.  Harry watched, unable to turn away as Hugo swallowed his throat convulsing as the liquid moved down.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Handing the bottle back to Harry, Hugo looked up and caught what was happening on the screen, surprised pleasure on his face. “Hey, look! It’s the Spurs.” He leaned forward to catch more of the action. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You know the Spurs?” Harry asked.  “You watch basketball?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hell yeah, I watch basketball, whenever I find it on. I love it. The Spurs are my favourite team, next to the Celtics.  They’re really my favourite. When I was in New York I kept hoping I’d be able to take the train and catch one of their games live, but could never get it to happen. Can you imagine how great it would be to watch a game in person, right at court level?  How about you, what’s your favourite team?”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“More of a Warriors fan myself, but like you, the Spurs are my second.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hugo snorted at Harry’s admittance. “You know, being a Warriors fan is like admitting you’re a fan of Christmas. Everyone’s a Warriors fan.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Choosing to ignore him, Harry continued. “They’ve such talent on that team and they seem to be decent people. You know, not caught up in all the hype and glory,” Harry said as he relaxed back on the sofa. He could do this. He and Hugo could discuss basketball and it would be fine. Firmly telling that part of him that had begun to express an interest in so many tempting things—freckles that covered Hugo’s chest like the millions of stars that light up the night skies over the Sahara Desert, the unprepared for sensuousness of Hugo’s feet, the long line of Hugo’s throat as he swallowed his ale, and the sheen of hard male bodies perspiring on the telly--to calm the fuck down. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Uncle Harry, are you okay. You went a bit tense there for a moment. I’d be happy to give you a back rub, might help you relax,” Hugo offered. </p>
<p>Panicked at the thought of his potential reaction to Hugo’s touch, Harry grabbed the bottle from Hugo and drained it and shook his head.  “No, but thanks for the offer.”</p>
<p>“No worries,” Hugo said. “I’ll get us another. This one’s empty. ”  </p>
<p>As Hugo stood the legs of his cargo shorts rode up giving Harry a glimpse of a tattoo along Hugo’s right thigh.  From the angle he was viewing it Harry wasn’t sure what he was looking at, but it looked to be a dolphin, or some sort of sea creature. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Curious as to its origin, Harry was about to ask its history when the <i>whoosh</i> of the floo and a flash of light interrupted. They looked up just as Ron stumbled through and promptly tripped over Harry’s shoes.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry grimaced and shrugged a silent. “Sorry,” He’d removed them as soon as he’d arrived as per Hermione’s strict guidelines. Anyone entering her home knew to remove their shoes as soon as they arrived, or face dire consequences. They were also supposed to put them on the shelf next to the fireplace, something Harry had been forgetting of late.  Since his marriage had ended, he’d started to revert back to the previous sloppiness of bachelorhood. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or maybe, since he had done everything he was supposed to do, and his marriage had still ended, this was his meagre attempt at rebellion. He wasn’t sure; what he did know was he no longer paid any attention to these sorts of rules. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Frowning at Harry, Ron bent to remove his own shoes. A flick of his wand, had both pairs flying to their designated spots.  “Been here long, mate? Sorry I was late. There have been some problems with a new product. It keeps exploding, when you don’t want it to, and not when it’s supposed to.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He removed his traveling robes and sent them flying to a line of hooks on the wall, one for each member of the family. “What’re you watching? Basketball?” Ron scoffed in contempt. “Again? Still don’t get your interest in that game.” Declarative statements and questions tumbled out of him as he loosened his tie, and spied the beer sitting on the table. “Oi, does that look good! Are there more?” Harry nodded, his gaze never leaving Ron. “Get you another one?” Ron called out as he wandered into the kitchen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was the same as always. Ron entered a room and Harry’s attention immediately centered on him.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Only this time, a part of Harry’s attention remained focused on Hugo, wondering how long it would be before Ron noticed his son’s state of undress. Not long, as it turned out, as Ron made an abrupt stop, then turned slowly to examine his currently shirtless and barefoot son, sitting on the sofa. “Umm Hugo, did you forget to put the rest of your clothes on before you joined Harry on the sofa? Didn’t your mum and I talk to you about the way you were dressing, or rather <i>not</i> dressing, lately?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Turning to Harry, Ron continued.  “Found him yesterday on the back terrace, in just a pair of those boxer briefs. Personally, I prefer a bit more room, my bits like to breathe, but to each their own.  The point is: he was in his Pants. Outside, on the terrace. Anyone could have seen.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He turned back to Hugo. “Harry doesn’t want to see you running around half naked. Do you?” he asked Harry. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry averted his face. The thought of Hugo in a pair of boxer briefs, his bits snuggly encased in the soft cotton that hugged his arse and legs. Long freckled legs that seemed to on forever had Harry’s cock leaping to attention. Harry struggled to maintain his control over his body. Only constant thoughts of large tits, via Pansy Parkinson or Lavender Brown chasing him down a dark alley, or Hagrid dressed as Las Vegas showgirl complete with feathered boas and sequined bodices kept him in the competition. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, giving it up as a lost cause, Harry settled for clasping the beer in in his clasped hands and placed them casually over this engorged cock, hoping the coolness of the beer would reduce his obvious excitement. At the very least cover it up. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blushing brightly, Hugo sat silently, looking up at Ron. He didn’t say anything. But Harry could tell, he was starting to sweat a bit, and not from the heat. Hugo was a good kid with an inordinate amount of respect and affection for both his parents. While Hugo had inherited his mum’s compassion and empathy for others, he’d also received his dad’s tendency to say what he thought, whenever he wanted. For a moment there it looked as if a war of wills of the Granger-Weasley family was about to take place. “But, Dad, it’s so hot,” he whined softly, at last. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The temperature had been abnormally high for April, so Harry really couldn’t fault him for his choice of clothing. If he’d thought he could get away with it, Harry might have done the same.  He really wished Hugo would remain as he was, at least keep the cargo shorts on. Harry was intrigued by that brief glimpse of his tattoo, and he wanted another look. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come on, Hugo.  Go put some clothes on, at least a shirt.  Your mum would have a <i>Mooncalf</i> if she saw you like that, especially with Harry here.  If you’re really that uncomfortable, I imagine between myself and Harry we can manage a half decent cooling charm. Am I right Harry?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Um yeah, but aren’t we going out?  I really need you to either commiserate with me over my divorce from your sister being final today, or—“</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh bloody hell! Oops, I mean to say. Oh Merlin,” Ron corrected himself in front of his child, who rolled his eyes and grinned at Harry. Harry wasn’t sure why Ron even bothered as he mistakenly cussed in front of his children more often than not. “That’s right. Today’s been so crazy, I forgot all about that. Hell yeah, we’re going. Only there’ll be none of that commiserating stuff. You’re getting a leg over, if I have anything to say about it. I’d love to find just the right bird for you. I’m happy to talk you up. Be your wingman as it were.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry cast a glance at Hugo who just shrugged in a “told you so” kind of way. “We’ll find you a lovely lass with perfect Parkinson sized tits. Yeah?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron grinned maniacally as he raised his hands in front of him and flexed his fingers as if milking a cow or squeezing a pair of breasts. “Man I can’t believe it’s my sister who gets to snuggle up with those babies night after night. Boy, what I couldn’t do with something like those,” he cackled while Harry shivered absolutely terrified by the thought of having breasts the size of Pansy’s anywhere near him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Dad!” Hugo yelled in horror and embarrassment as he collapsed on the sofa in giggles, while Harry just shook his head in bemusement. Ron would always be the same. He talked a good game, but everyone knew he was desperately in love with Hermione and had been since they were in school. The thought of cheating on her would never occur to him.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron then turned suddenly sober; casting a quick glance around to make sure Hermione hadn’t unexpectedly appeared out of thin air, before grinning at the two of them. “Just kidding. Let me go get changed and I’ll be right with you. Besides I’m betting Hermione still remembers that bird conjuring spell from sixth year. Just hearing that advert for that rental car company, ‘Avis’ has me breaking out in a cold sweat.  Am I right Harry?” He turned towards Harry and they both shuddered dramatically while Hugo in confused amusement glanced back and forth, between the two of them as they laughed in memory.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Could I maybe tag along too?” Hugo asked. “I’ve nothing going on tonight and it might be fun to watch Uncle Harry, ‘getting his groove on’,” Hugo said with a laugh. “Maybe I can even pull some attention your way,” waggling his eyebrows up and down as he waved a pretend cigar, like some demented star from the silent movie era. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>I’ve no doubt you could, </i> Harry thought, but said nothing until he heard Ron say, “Ask your Uncle if it’s okay. It’s his night.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do you say, Uncle Harry. Can I come?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry thought for a moment.  He’d been looking forward to spending the evening with Ron—up to a point, of course. That point being when Harry found someone to maybe chat up -- but the opportunity to spend even more time with Hugo was too tempting to pass-up.  “It’s up to you Hugo, if you want to come waste an evening with us old-age pensioners, its okay with me.”  He teased the young man. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hugo grinned and leaned forward to stand as if he was ready to walk out the door that very minute.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But you’re not going like that. I thought I told you to go change?” Ron sighed, exasperated. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Hugo emerged from his room. Harry blinked, unable to look away. The change in his clothing, while dramatic, did nothing to hide the fit body underneath. Perfectly fitted bleached jeans strategically ripped at the upper thighs, and just under the left knee, that he’d topped off with a black t-shirt stretched snug but not too tight across his chest and shoulders. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>His hair shaved closed on the sides, while the top was thick with burnished copper curls, the result of the latest in Sleekeazy's hair products.  Stopping by the floo, he slid his feet into a pair of bright red hi-tops. As he squatted down to complete lacing them, Harry couldn’t help but gulp as saliva flooded his mouth, at the flash of creamy freckled skin that peeked out from the enticing rip just below Hugo’s right cheek, and the rounded indention that separated bum from upper thigh. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hugo straightened and stamping his feet in them for comfort, he turned towards Harry and said, “I’m ready. Can we go?” Breaking Harry’s stunned silence. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron <i>hooted</i> Hermione’s mobile to let her know they were going out and would most likely be home late. Once they had realised the ease of Muggle technology, the Wizarding World had instantly embraced it, especially for instant contact with another. It beat the hell out of the constant owls. The call finished, he reached out and curled his hand around Harry’s elbow. Together they brought Hugo in close, and the three of them Disapparated away.</p>
