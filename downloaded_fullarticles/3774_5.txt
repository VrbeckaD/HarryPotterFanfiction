  <em>July 22, 1996 </em>
</p><p>The word that Voldemort had come back from the dead was out. Cornelius Fudge, due to the public's cries and outrage of this news, resigned his post as Minister of Magic. Everyone feared for their lives, no matter what their stance on muggle-borns was.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore walked outside onto his freshly mowed lawn. He took a deep breath, smelling the flowers and water of the outside world. To say he loved his home is an understatement. He was secluded from everyone else. He thrived in his privacy and quiet home. He could think properly and not feel pressured by anyone, which was a relief from what he had to endure the previous year.</p><p>Just as he turned around to walk into his cabin-like home, he heard a crack from behind him.</p><p>"Albus, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be dealing with the nasty Ministry?" a male voice questioned.</p><p>Dumbledore turned around and looked into the red eyes of the man in front of him.</p><p>"Hello, Tom. To answer your questions simply, my business is not needed at the ministry," he replied with his hands behind his back like always.</p><p>Tom took a few steps toward Dumbledore, his black cloak billowing due to the wind.</p><p>"I've been meaning... to ask for a favor from you."</p><p>"Really? After our duel in the Ministry Atrium, I presumed you wouldn't speak with me again."</p><p>"Do you mind if I go inside your home?" Tom asked faster than you can say Quidditch.</p><p>"Of course, if you'll follow me," Albus answered hesitantly, turning around and walking inside his house.</p><p>He led Tom into the living room and convinced Tom to sit on his scarlet sofa in front of the closed fireplace. He walked into his kitchen to get tea and some sherbet lemons, his favorite sweet. As much as he loved using magic, he liked to do home tasks as a muggle would.</p><p>As he brewed the tea, he reminisced all the moments he shared with Tom Riddle. He remembered he met him at the orphanage 60 years prior. The boy hadn't believed in magic, but he knew he was different. Now here he was, sitting on Albus Dumbledore's sofa in a secluded area where he would be hard to find.</p><p>Albus walked out of the kitchen and into the living room with a tray in his hands. When he approached his house guest, he braked his walking.</p><p>Tom was looking the other direction with his right leg over his left leg, which revealed his black garter belt.</p><p>Albus carefully placed the tray on the coffee table and sat down to the right of Tom.</p><p>"So, Tom," Albus started to gain the other's attention, "What favor do you want from me?"</p><p>"Well, I believe you already know, Albus," Tom purred as he placed his hand on Dumbledore's thigh.</p><p>"If I had already known, why would there be a reason for me to ask?" Albus mentioned, glancing down at his thighs.</p><p>"Well, by now you should know," Tom replied with a soft pat on Dumbledore's thigh.</p><p>Albus breathed in sharply and slowly breathed out. If he had to be honest, he would agree that Tom was always quite attractive, even after he was left without a nose. The 45 year age difference would never stop either of the men.</p><p>"How about we... take this to the bedroom?" Tommy said seductively.</p><p>"Great idea, Tom. Follow me."</p><p>Albus stood up and led Tom toward the only bedroom in the cabin. He closed the door behind him and started to strip his clothes off without turning around. After he was fully nude, he turned around to find Tom laying nude except for his garter belt on the satin sheets of the bed in a provocative position.</p><p>"Like what you see, professor?" Tom slurred with a wiggle of his nonexistent eyebrows.</p><p>"Very much, Mr. Riddle," Albus answered.</p><p>With that, he approached Tom and raised him up by grabbing his arms so that he was sitting up. He leaned in toward the noseless stud and pressed his lips against the other man's lips. He tasted like blood and smelt like sulfur. He wrapped his arms around Tom's neck and pushed him down onto the smooth bed, eliciting a muffled yelp from the other man.</p><p>He peppered the Dark Lord’s pale skin with kisses, leaving hickey marks along his collarbone and down his flat abdomen. With each graze of his lips leaving Tom a panting mess, Albus felt powerful. The last time he had made love with another wizard had been with Gellert Grindelwald almost a century prior. As he looked into the man's red snake eyes, he realized that Voldemort shared the same ambition for power and love for dark magic as Grindelwald. The overwhelming amount of lust and desire for control coursing through him made sense: he would make Tom his, just like he did with Gellert.</p><p>Albus’s lips departed from the area where Tom’s navel used to be, evoking a somber sigh from the snake man. Dumbledore moved his head down a bit and leered down at his lover, a smirk on his face and a twinkle of ardor in his blue eyes. The Dark Lord shivered as the other man used his teeth to take off his lingerie and stockings. Once he was fully exposed, the headmaster straightened himself up as much as a gay wizard like himself could and gave Tom a stern gaze.</p><p>“Come over here and bend over for me, Tom,” Dumbledore commanded, gesturing toward the edge of the bed he stood by.</p><p>The dark wizard obeyed, assuming a doggy style position on the edge of the bed. From behind him, he could hear Albus mutter a spell that sent a strange yet pleasant sensation through his asshole.</p><p>“Are you ready, Tom?”</p><p>“Yes, professor,” he impatiently replied.</p><p>“That’s headmaster to you, Mr. Riddle,” the Gryffindor admonished.</p><p>“Yes, headmaster.”</p><p>With the Slytherin’s consent, Dumbledore stroked his wand and grabbed onto Voldemort’s butt cheek and slid into the Dark Lord. Voldemort loudly gasped and moaned, not anticipating the most powerful wizard of the century to be concealing such an almighty penis in his robes.</p><p>Dumbledore pounded into him for a few minutes, short breaths and unintelligible muttering filling the room. Since there were no other homes within a mile radius, Albus felt no shame in murmuring, “I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all, Tom,” into his lover’s ear and ejaculating with a loud cry soon after.</p><p>Once Albus pulled out, he noticed that Tom had not reached climax, so he reached under and stroked him until he came with a cry a couple minutes later.</p><p>The two powerful wizards cleaned themselves up and nestled their bodies under the cool sheets, exhausted from their close intimacy.</p><p>“Albus,” Tom whispered hoarsely, “That was absolutely awful.”</p><p>“Thank you, Tom. I very much enjoyed myself as well.”</p><p>“I don’t mean to come on too strong but I have seen your heart, and it is mine.”</p><p>Albus turned to face Tom with a soft smile, thankful that he was willing to show his complete vulnerability to him. They fell asleep, gazing into each other’s eyes.</p><p>Albus woke up a couple hours later, feeling like he had forgotten something. He furrowed his eyebrows in concentration, trying to remember what he could've possibly forgotten.</p><p>"Oh, I remember now. I left the sherbet lemon and tea out in the living room," he muttered, not wanting to wake up the man beside him.</p><p>He considered getting up or using the Accio spell to get the tea and sweets. He decided not to, for he was still exhausted and needed to rest. He closed his eyes and sighed. He had a good day.</p></div>
