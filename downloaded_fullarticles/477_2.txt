    <p>The following story is completely fiction.</p><hr/><p>~*X0X0*~</p><p>He heard a laughing voice off in the distance. It was a sweet, joyful tune of voice that was like piano music to his ears. He heard that piano music voice before. Many, many times before. He glanced across the room and without intending to, his dark eyes sought her out.</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>Her, with her flame colored bright red natural hair and carefree white smile. Her, in a long laced sleeve crimson red colored v-neck dress that showed off her slim toned pale legs. Her, with her big dark brown soulful eyes and intelligent mind.</p><p>Her, singing and dancing over by the magically playing juke box that is unplugged like she's the only one in the room. Like no one in the room is watching her.</p><p>Her, whom he has loved ever since they were both kids at Hogwarts. Loved, long before the day Harry triumphed in defeating The Dark Lord.</p><p>Him, the best friend of Harry Potter.</p><p>Him, hiding his real feelings towards his best mate's wife.</p><p>He couldn't take seeing her like this because it hurt too much for him. He sat his empty glass of what was once Fire Whiskey down on the counter.</p><p>"I'm spent, mate. I'm going to head home." Said Blaise.</p><p>Harry nodded. "Good seeing you again, mate."</p><p>The boys hugged eachother, and Blaise walked out of the pub. Harry walked behind over to where his wife was dancing, and with strong arms, captured her from behind and they both rocked to the tune of the guitar.</p><p>Ginevra never noticed Blaise there.</p><p>~*X0X0*~</p><p>Ginevra, working late one night, in the Creature Care department inside the Ministry of Magic, could feel herself growing exhausted. She reckoned to call it a night. She neatly arranged her paperwork detailing her work on how Yellow Fire Crab's can swim, and her statement to the Wizengamot Administration on how Fairy's should be free to live wherever they want, and gently placed them on her desk where she would need to add more to both of her articles tomorrow.</p><p>Grabbing her fur minx coat, she left her office.</p><p>Walking as slow as she can, feeling fatigued down to her bones, she stopped at the elevator and pushed the button to go down as she needed to get to the apparation point in order to go home.</p><p>The sliding metal door opened, and she walked inside the elevator. She pushed the button to go down, then that's when she noticed that the floor level button was already lit up red. The doors to the elevator closed with her and another occupant inside.</p><p>"Hello, Blaise." Ginevra said, tiredly with a crooked smile.</p><p>He cocked his head in her direction. He had his hands in the front of his black pants pocket, and he looked just as tired as Ginevra felt.</p><p>"Ginny. How are you?"</p><p>"I'm exhausted." Said she, flipping her red hair over her shoulder to look at Blaise.</p><p>Blaise felt his throat close up as so many emotions bubbled in the pit of his stomach at the sight of her, but all he could manage in that moment was a crooked smirk as they both looked in each others eyes. All was silent for several moments inside the elevator as it trailed below floors.</p><p>The elevator ringed, signaling that they have reached their destination to the floor level as the door to the elevator opened. Ginevra was the first to step out but just as she had her foot out of the door way, she said over her shoulder without looking back at him.</p><p>"See you around, Blaise."</p><p>Blaise, standing there watching her leave out of the front doors of the Ministry just outside of the elevators, stood there, left speech less.</p><p>Ginevra, reaching the apparation spot, apparated home in a swirl of grey star dust.</p><p>~*X0X0*~</p><p>Ginevra unlocked the front door of her home, and she immediately knew, upon her own intuition, that something was off.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>She noticed another woman's bra laying right there on the kitchen table.</p><p>Walking further into her home, she noticed another woman's blue jeans laying discarded on the floor, long since forgotten.</p><p>She followed the sounds of moaning into her bedroom.</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>She stopped just outside her bedroom, and listened. Her blood boiling. Though she didn't need to listen any longer because she knew what them sounds were. It made her furious.</p><p>The door to her bedroom flew open after she casted a silent wandless magic unlocking charm knowing Harry had probably locked it. There, on the same bed she shared with her husband was Hermione Granger under her husband as he thrust inside of her.</p><p>Ginevra, thinking fast, threw a wandless silent cutting hex at Harrys back. It cut him just enough for him to stop his activity and roll over beside Hermione Granger as he shut his eyes trying to avoid the pain that the cutting hex perhaps caused him. Like she cared in this moment. She was upset.</p><p>"Ow." Harry complained.</p><p>Hermione Granger, upon seeing Givenra, sat up as fast as she could and covered her self with the blankets. Harry opened his eyes, although he can barely see with out his glasses.</p><p>Ginevra shook her head, as if to clear it, barely seeing past her nerves.</p><p>She almost falters when she opens her mouth to speak, but she's determined as ever to have her voice heard. She looks directly at Harry. "I work twelve hours every day. I pay bills. I make sure we are both fed, clothed, sheltered, and taken care of. And this-" She gasps a breath of air into her lungs as she motions her hand between her husband Harry and Hermione Granger. "This is what happens when I am not around?" Ginevra hissed, vision almost turning red from her upset nerves shaking.</p><p>Harry, naked as the day he was born, stumbles out of the bed and steps towards his wife.</p><p>"Honey. I am sorry."</p><p>Ginevra holds up her hands as she has heard enough.</p><p>"Yeah." She smiles, although it is a sad smile that reaches the hurt soul inside her eyes as she speaks. "Sorry you got caught."</p><p>Harry stands there naked while Hermione Granger holds the sheets up to cover herself while she sits on the bed.</p><p>Ginevra turns her back on both of them, no longer caring, and walks out.</p><p>Leaving behind her give-a-damn in pieces on the floor with her husband and Hermione Granger.</p><p>~*X0X0*~</p><p>Ginevra, walking the cold dark London streets with no place to go in mind, as tears fall down her cheeks, hears some one speaking to her as the black car beside her on the street slows down with the window cracked, trailing beside her as she walks on the sidewalk.</p><p>She looks over as the window rolls further down, and inside the black car is Blaise Zabini.</p><p>"I knew that was you. Get in." Said he.</p><p>She hesitates, but she pulls her fur minx coat tighter around herself, and opens up the passanger side car door and she gets inside Blaise's warm passenger side seat.</p><p>~*X0X0*~</p><p>"I may have been in Slytherin House, but that doesn't mean I am all bad. You see, I know when some thing is bothering some one. You want to tell me what happened?" Said he, as he drives through the bright street lights.</p><p>Ginevra opens her mouth to say some thing, any thing but it gets all choked up inside and she can't seem to find the words she wants to say as she sits inside Blaise's car and cries. Her mind confused.</p><p>How could she have not known her husband Harry was having an affair with her brother Ronald's wife?</p><p>But after a few moments, which felt like hours as he continues to drive, she unashamedly and unapologetically tells him what she seen in her very own bedroom just not even thirty minutes before, after he has seen her this vulnerable.</p><p>Blaise turns a corner, and continues driving. "Wow." Said he after a long pause. "That is just messed up. I have no words to say, but what I can say is that you are welcome to stay with me if you want. It's your decision." Said he, as he parks his black car in his drive way. He looks over at Ginevra to see her nod her head as her tears fall down her cheeks. She feels nothing but inner turmoil.</p><p>He opens up the passenger side door for her and she gently takes his hand. He leads them both inside his house.</p><p>"You can stay here for as long as you need." Said he as he takes off his black coat and hangs it up. He gives her a tour of his house. It's a single bedroom house. Not that big, but big enough for a single man to live in.</p><p>"I- I- appreciate this. I know we don't know each other that well but this means a lot." Said she through her sobs, as she sits on his couch. He takes a seat next to her.</p><p>"It's no problem. Ginny. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask." Said he as he stands up.</p><p>"I will be in my bedroom. Goodnight."</p><p>"Goodnight." Said she.</p><p>He disappears upstairs and Ginevra lays there with her thoughts swirling inside her head. She's confused. She's exhausted.</p><p>She gets up off the couch, and walks upstairs.</p><p>She calls for him in the darkness. "Blaise?"</p><p>"Yeah. In here."</p><p>She follows his voice until she finds it, in a dark smoke filled room.</p><p>His bedroom.</p><p>Blaise stands before the open window, moonlight shining through. His silhouette is dark, beautiful even, as the moonlight outlines him, and he blows smoke out of his mouth.</p><p>"I couldn't sleep." Said she as she steps near him.</p><p>"I couldn't either." He puts his cigar out and turns towards her.</p><p>The cool breezes inside the room, sending a chill through her, as she takes off her fur minx coat.</p><p>He takes her by the hand and they both lay in each others arms silently, without words, in his bed.</p><p>Both finding comfort in each other.</p>
