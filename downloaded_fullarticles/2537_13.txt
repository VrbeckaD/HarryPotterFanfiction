    <p> Primrose Catherine Evans held Grace’s shoulders as they watched their grandmother being placed to rest in the ground. Grace was crying, rubbing her eyes as Prim tried to soothe her younger sister, barely listening in on her relatives who had come from Britain and their comments.</p><p> “Didn’t know her well,” Petunia muttered to her husband. “But she was a good sort. Her son was a bit… odd but she was a good sort.” Prim shot a look at them as Vernon hummed.</p><p> Ugh, she hated those two. Both were just… gah. They came into their house with their son and nephew and acted so freaking annoying. The only one she liked was Harry and that was because the eight-year-old was a sweet kid who wanted to help out. Though she wondered why he was so focused on helping cook.</p><p> Dudley however was loud and rude and had ruined three separate pillows only to blame Harry which Prim said wasn’t right because he was with her the entire time, not that the parents cared. Petunia was gossipy and looked down her nose at them while Vernon was a sexist ass who also seemed homophobic given some comments he made as well as racist given his muttered comments about the Sheriff who had come around to check on them.</p><p> “I’m boooored,” their son Dudley whined behind her, a little to loud but Prim could understand that. He was a kid. The sound of a punch made her turn her head to see him punching Harry. The parents didn’t say a thing, and Prim couldn’t stand it anymore.</p><p> “You’re going to be that bad of parents to ignore your son hitting your nephew?” she demanded, glad the service was over now. The priest looked up and also glared at the parents, having also gotten sick of them.</p><p> “Excuse me?” Petunia demanded, looking affronted.</p><p> “You heard me, you let your son hit your nephew and you’re not punishing your son? I don’t mean your nephew but I guess I have to make that statement given how bad you two are and my own suspicions you’re the right kind of freaks to abuse a child.” Prim told the two, standing up taller and using a word she knew the two hissed at Harry. Petunia went red while Vernon went purple and Harry frowned. Dudley scowled.</p><p> “The freak deserves it!” he shouted and that just cemented it.</p><p> Prim could honestly say the rest was a blur, with her shouting at the Dursley family and many of the funeral goers all ganging up on them, the couple paling when they realized no one was with them.</p><p> It got worse when Vernon lost his temper and tried to hit Harry. Prim moved and grabbed Harry, dragging him away as the priest called the Sherriff and Mackenzie showed up, teeth bared.</p><p> In the end, it had Prim holding emergency guardianship forms for Harry, Grace was plotting how to revamp Prim’s room for a seven-year-old and with Vernon arrested and Petunia being informed she would have to stay in Havenfall for a while.</p><p> “Well that was a funeral to remember,” she muttered and the priest snorted.</p><p> “Not even in my top ten.” The man said before he walked off, leaving Prim staring after him.</p><p>-0-</p><p>Albus Dumbledore did not expect a device he had primed towards the warding around Number Four Privet Drive to go off as he was doing paperwork one August day. Jumping up, he cast a spell to check what was going on, finding that the device was claiming that the wards had been moved! He had planned on the Dursley family potentially moving, but Arabella hadn’t…</p><p> He went right to the floo, grabbing some powder before flooing to Pivet Drive.</p><p> “Albus!” Arabella said, looking surprised. “What’s wrong?”</p><p> “The wards around Pivet Drive have moved,” Albus explained. “Have the Dursley’s moved at all?”</p><p> “No! They went to a funeral in the states for a relative of Petunia’s.” Arabella replied, looking confused.</p><p> “Do you know where?” Albus asked.</p><p> “Yes, a little place called Havenfall…”</p>
