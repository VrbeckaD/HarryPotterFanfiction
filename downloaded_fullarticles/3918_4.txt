  <strong>Chapter One</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>“Ron, hurry up! We're going to head out and wait for you, alright?” Harry shouted across the hallway as Ron walked briskly towards the loo.</p><p> </p><p>Ron turned and grinned at his best friend. “Sure! Tell Seamus I´ll throttle him if he plays keeper!” Harry enjoyed the snort of laughter escaping Ron. It had been so bloody long since he was truly happy. It would take a long time still, but just knowing that the Weasleys were trying to move on from their sorrow, without Fred, made Harry´s heart ache.</p><p> </p><p>As Ron <em>finally</em> entered the bathroom to take a piss - something he shouldn't have waited this long to do - he was already walking funny. The pressure in his private parts caused by the plugged fluids was going to kill him soon if he didn't release them. His hands practically ripped open his trousers and he fumbled to lower his pants before he grabbed his prick. “Ooh, fuck yeah,“ he let out a satisfied groan as he continued to empty his bladder. He shook his cock to release the last drops of piss before tucking himself in again. Once his trousers were closed, he turned to wash his hands. </p><p> </p><p>Then he stopped.</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy!” The shout could easily have been heard in the next corridor by numerous wizards if the mild Autumn weather hadn't already lured the majority of the students outside on this lovely Sunday.</p><p> </p><p>Blinded by anger, barely able to control himself enough to not knock out every single tooth in Malfoy's mouth, Ron turned, fists clenched tight at his sides. “Get the fuck out,” Ron's voice low, sending a clear warning to the blond Slytherin.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy looked paler than ever. Ron noticed with satisfaction the trembling hands that twisted inside his robes as if searching for the wand the Ministry had practically told him not to use. Only the basic spells available for an entire year. Ron would have preferred to see the Ferret locked up in Azkaban but the Wizengamot had spoken, and as a member of an old pure-blooded line - however poor they may be - he respected that decision. He was no fan of anarchy.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy tried and failed to speak, then he cleared his throat, not even daring to look at Ron. His fingers were fidgeting with the hem of the casual trousers nervously as he said: “I need to use the facilities, Weasley.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Weasley.</em> Ron wanted to snort. Never before had Malfoy <em>ever</em> used his proper name. It was always: ´Weasel´, `redhead´, ´poor loser´, or even ´idiot Gryffindork.´ Funny how war could change people and their perspective on life. <em>Change, my arse! Snotty bastard hasn't changed a bit!</em> Ron thought as anger continued to consume him.</p><p> </p><p>So, Malfoy wasn't going on about blood purity now that the eighth year had begun - not that Malfoy had any choice about attending - it had been one of the terms the Ministry had set if he wanted to avoid prison. Malfoy was still trying to act as if he owned the world. Walking around by himself mostly, wanting to show he could handle anything anyone challenged him with. <em>Bloody wanker,</em> Ron thought grumpily.</p><p> </p><p>Ron´s eyes zoomed in on Malfoy's feet that were shifting on the spot every now and then. Ron sneered. “I was here first!” And he <em>was.</em> Damn it if he was letting Malfoy watch him go about his business! He wasn't going to inform the blond that he was already on his way out.</p><p> </p><p>“Weasley,” the pleading tone in Malfoy's usually harsh voice did its best to untangle Ron´s silly and demanding ideas. It almost worked. Ron´s arms came together as he crossed them over his chest, giving his best ´I fucking hate you´ stare to Malfoy. Judging by the way Malfoy cowered, it worked. Head held higher with satisfaction, Ron took a step closer, trying to <em>force</em> Malfoy out before Ron would lose control over his Magic. He wasn't as powerful as Harry but he was no weakling either.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, I-I…”</p><p> </p><p>“It´s too late for that, Malfoy!” Ron thundered angrily at the blond - towering almost a head taller - causing Malfoy to flinch back against the wall, trembling like a leaf easily swirled around by the wind. A huge, pale finger poked harshly into the tender chest covered by the navy blue shirt Malfoy wore. Grey eyes met fuming blue ones. “You let them in! People fucking <em>died</em> because of something you did!! How dare you think …” Ron closed his eyes and concentrated on his breathing. <em>In and out. In and out.</em> Blue practically fire-blown eyes snapped open and Malfoy jerked his head backward, causing it to thump against the wall.</p><p> </p><p>“I´m s-sorry… I never wanted… I´m sorryyy…” Malfoy babbled on and on, Ron´s mouth transformed into a sneer worthy of any Slytherin. “Pleease…” Pearly white slender hands grabbed onto Ron´s sweater and he stumbled backward as Malfoy's legs wobbled and caved under him. The Slytherin lay there on his hands and knees and Ron stepped away from him in horror, watching Malfoy <em>sob.</em></p><p> </p><p>A freckled hand disheveled the red locks and Ron stared around to see if someone would come in here to help. <em>What the actual fuck?! Malfoys don't have breakdowns! Least of all public ones!!</em> “Control yourself, Malfoy. People might hear you.” Ron blurted out in an attempt to stop this insanity. He already lost his brother. He didn't <em>need</em> any more life-changing flip-flopping of his world, thank you very much!</p><p> </p><p>“Malfoy!” Ron hissed as he watched the Slytherin bend further until his pale cheek was resting on the cold stone floor. Malfoy kept muttering incoherently to himself as he shook, tears mixed with snot covering his usually perfect aristocratic face. Ron´s palms were clammy, chest tight with discomfort, trying to smother him with pangs of empathy no one should feel towards a Malfoy. Especially not after they had chosen the wrong side of the war.</p><p> </p><p>“Bloody hell, Malfoy. Get up!” the whispered words held the embarrassment Ron felt on behalf of Malfoy. <em>Fuck</em> Ron swirled around on the spot a couple of times, hands tearing into his hair in frustration when Malfoy's sobs kept coming and grew louder. <em>Bloody fuck!</em> Decision made, Ron found his wand, flicked it harshly, swinging the door closed and locked. </p><p> </p><p>“I can't believe this…” Ron mumbled as he crouched down beside Malfoy. “Malfoy,” Ron´s hand stretched out awkwardly, while he battled with himself whether he should touch the weeping teenager or not.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, Malfoy,” he spoke more tenderly than he had wanted but he had no idea what the hell he was working with here! “It… it´s alright, Malfoy… hush now…” <em>Merlingod, this was fucked up!</em> His strong hands reached out to Malfoy and lifted his head and shoulders up from the freezing floor. <em>Fuck - he was already so bloody cold from sitting here, Malfoy must have been too out of it to not notice it.</em></p><p> </p><p>Ron didn't gag over the smeared snot running along Malfoy's pale jaw in strips of thick yellowness like he was a small child that didn't understand the use of a napkin. He had a younger sister so he was used to dealing with situations like this. </p><p> </p><p>Just not with a bloke. Or a Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy´s eyelids were so white that Ron could easily see the veins crisscrossing across them. The Slytherin kept his eyes closed as he kept hiccupping out sob after sob. Ron summoned a towel and offered it with fumbling fingers to Malfoy. The git didn't even take it, not even after Ron had placed it into one of Malfoy's hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright. It's fine... I´ve… I've got you…” He used the same words that always seemed to work on Ginny. Ron only just managed to wipe off Malfoy's sticky messed-up face when Malfoy threw himself into Ron´s embrace. Heels solidly planted behind him, Ron barely swayed from the added weight. </p><p> </p><p>Grateful he had thought of locking the door, Ron sat there, holding Malfoy. Ron yelped as Malfoy suddenly brought them closer together, the heat from Malfoy's body surrounding him, just like his nostrils filled with the sandalwood scent of Malfoy's perfume? <em>Malfoys wore perfumes, didn't they? They loved fancy stuff, and-</em></p><p> </p><p>“I didn't mean it… I´m sorry… They had my mum…” Ron was brought back to reality as Malfoy's words began to make sense again. The redhead closed his eyes, willing the anger and sorrow of losing Fred to the back of his mind. He <em>knew</em> what Malfoy was saying was true. He had been at the trials.</p><p> </p><p>“Shush now. Things will… things will be… better…” Ron knew he was on shaky grounds, but he was the only one there. He was the one that started this!</p><p> </p><p>“I…”</p><p> </p><p>Ron pushed Malfoy away from him. When the blond almost fell down, Ron automatically grabbed hold of him with both hands to steady him. He eyed Malfoy wearily. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>A flush so pink should have made Malfoy look like a farm pig. <em>Naturally,</em> it just made him look vulnerable, or Merlin forbid - adorable. If you were a girl. “I still need to... go…” Ron must have looked as ignorant as he felt hearing those words because Malfoy clarified quietly. “The loo.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right. So, I´ll just…”</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Ron didn't move. He sure as hell didn't want Malfoy snotting all over him again. “I - I can't… my legs…”</p><p> </p><p>Lunch threatened to reappear through Ron's mouth, causing him to swallow the bile even though his mouth had turned uncomfortably dry. “Er -”</p><p> </p><p>The whispered words from Malfoy were so small that Ron's chest tightened so hard, it was almost causing the blood flow to his heart to stop, he was sure. “Please, don't let me wet myself.”</p><p> </p><p>Darkness overtook Ron's mind as he forced himself to close his eyes, lest he witnesses Malfoy's humility. <em>Nobody deserved that.</em> </p><p> </p><p>“Alright.” Large, freckled arms gathered the smaller Slytherin into his stronghold as he stood and allowed Malfoy to use his strength to do the same. “Steady now,” Ron mumbled when Malfoy almost managed to tumble them both back towards the floor. “Just - hold on,” he hauled Malfoy higher until he was able to stand straighter.</p><p> </p><p>Blue eyes assessed the situation surrounding them and realised they only had about 7 steps to the nearest facility. “Lean on me.” </p><p> </p><p>For a small bloke, Malfoy was bloody heavy. Of course, deadweight had a tendency to be just that! Ron was almost panting by the time they were halfway across the bathroom. Nobody needed to know he had practically spent his entire summer after Fred passed, eating and hiding in his room. Grief was a personal thing for Ron, and it helped to be alone for him, allowing him time to think.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright. There - can you -” Ron made the mistake to move away from Malfoy and he almost fell again. “Bloody hell, Malfoy. Didn't you eat today?”</p><p> </p><p>Ron ignored the ´no´ that was mumbled back and worked on holding Malfoy up. “Fuck. Will I - <em>Merlin…”</em></p><p> </p><p>“You need to… while I…” Malfoy gestured at the urinal.</p><p> </p><p>Ron blanched. Sure, he had lots of brothers but he´d always had a problem with using the loo while others did. Even his own family. It was a private matter! Nobody needed to <em>hear</em> others while they tended to their needs! “Fine,” knowing his own sensitivities were better ignored than being pissed on. </p><p> </p><p>The sound of a zipper being pulled down as the metal parted loudly like lovers screaming in protest rang in Ron's sensitive ears. Cloth slapped against cloth like misbehaved children being spanked, as Malfoy pulled down his pants. Ron looked away, knowing that if he closed his eyes the noise would only be heightened. He didn't make a grab for his wand to silence the sound of piss leaving Malfoy's prick and going into the toilet because then he would drop Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Merlin - stop think about Malfoy's prick!!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ron cleared his throat awkwardly. “Done?” He pretended the heavy blush he was suddenly sporting was a part of his normal reddish appearance.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” The zipper wasn't as loud this time and Ron relaxed a bit, fighting to keep breathing regularly so they wouldn't both fall over. He had no intention landing on a half-naked Malfoy!</p><p> </p><p>“Weasley,” Malfoy cleared his throat, “I can stand now.” </p><p> </p><p><em>Of course, he bloody could</em>… “Right. So…  er…” He couldn't explain why the sudden loss of contact with Malfoy's body felt wrong. He adopted Harry´s nasty habit of lip-biting and shifted nervously on the spot. </p><p> </p><p>“Ron?” Both Ron and Malfoy jumped as Harry´s shout reached them. Malfoy began shaking again, Ron acted before Harry´s second shout came.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, mate! Coming,” he shouted back while backing away from the blond. “Stomach ache, wouldn´t let a troll in!” He added an awkward laugh and Harry bought it.</p><p> </p><p>“Nasty, mate! Alright, just wanted to check. You were gone a long time. Meet you outside, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure mate, just let me wash.”</p><p> </p><p>They were alone again and the silence screamed at Ron to speak up.</p><p> </p><p>“I´m sorry about Fred,” Malfoy whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Ron's chest tightened painfully - he couldn´t breathe. Tears were trying to force their way forth obviously wanting to humiliate him further. “Malfoy,” he croaked out. Because Malfoy hadn't said ´your brother´ - he said his <em>name.</em></p><p> </p><p>When Ron reopened his eyes, Malfoy had left.</p>
