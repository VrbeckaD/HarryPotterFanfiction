    <p>     Draco slicked back his hair in the mirror. Even he could see how the flame his parents constantly attempted to quell had finally disappeared, making his eyes fade from the silver stars they used to be to emotionless stone. He averted his gaze and shrugged on his favorite coat, the one that was itchy and gray, but nonetheless comforted him.</p><p>     He rubbed his chapped lips together, coughing as his throat began to dry. The mirror had to be warped. Did he really have tears streaming down his face, little rivulets against the snow of his skin? No, it couldn't be. But when he touched his cheek, it was wet, and his heart went colder.</p><p align="center">- - -</p><p>     The wand Harry held was absent with the life that usually curled like dragon's flame within the wood. He twisted it and glared at the strange vines that curled up its side. No. It wouldn't do. Making a noise of irritation in the back of his throat, he threw down the wand and picked up another, his heart aching as the second wand sparked duly when he attempted to wield it.</p><p>     The Knowingsmen that had destroyed his original wand had had hair that fell down his back like an icy waterfall, but Harry didn't know whether the peculiar color was due to age or genetics. His eyes had been flecks of dull, gray stone set into his face, and the sneer that marred his delicate features had made Harry's stomach drop with anxiety. However, he was trained to deal with the anxiety disorder that affected his every move and action, so it wasn't a problem... usually.</p><p>     The noise that flickered in his throat like a dying flame brightened to a roar, and he threw down the wand, flinching as it hissed and spat like it was a living thing; which, apparently, it was. Harry retreated slowly, eyeing the wand before placing his hand blindly on a box behind him.</p><p>     Ah. The object, whatever it was, buzzed against Harry's hand, and a warm feeling engulfed the boy as he glanced towards it. To his surprise, it wasn't a wand, but rather a strange looking sword carved with familiar, yet unplaceable, runes. The blade was polished well enough that he could see his appearance. Despite being only seventeen, he was surprised to see that he appeared older, his tired eyes marred by bruise colored rings and his lips set so it made his face look sharper. He ran a hand through his tousled hair, feeling silly for noticing his appearance. But still, no matter the tiredness and general feeling of war that painted his face like makeup, he couldn't help but recognize the spark that danced in his lively, though exhausted, eyes.</p><p align="center">- - -</p><p>     Draco jerked away from the mirror, and stumbled to the window beside his bed, his hand sliding against the bitingly cold marble of the windowsill. Outside, a soft, silent snow fell upon the grounds of Scio Manor, making the garden look like something from a dream. But Draco knew that it was truly anything but.</p><p>     His watery eyes drifted to the tree at the center of the garden. <em>His</em> tree. He pictured it as it was during the spring, emerald leaves sprouting from branches as white as bone and blossoms like the sunrise blooming from those leaves. He pictured it as it was during the autumn, the flowers faded to a gorgeous white and the leaves turning a fiery orange, unlike the rest of the garden, which eternally stayed green and luscious under the orders of his mother.</p><p>     A small sigh escaped Draco's lips. Just the idea of him curling up in those branches, his quivering fingers wrapped around an old book in his favorite language, French, or perhaps one of his father's ornate telescopes, had his toes, numb from the cold, curling within his boots. But his happiness was brought to gloom as, out of the corner of his eye, he saw house elves setting up his <em>wedding</em>.  He thought the word as if it were a curse.</p><p>     What an absolutely horrid time to have a wedding, especially in the midst of a war with a cause that Draco could neither stand for nor stand against. If he stood for the things the Knowing so avidly worshipped, the life behind his eyes would shutter even more, and the joy that occasionally made his lips twist would be absent. However, if he had the courage to stand against his parents, against Mr. Riddle, against the Knowing, his blood would burn paths through his body, and his father would send a curse towards him faster than he could blink.</p><p>     Why would he risk his life for a war not worth fighting?</p><p align="center">- - -</p><p>     As Harry exited the storage room, the blade in a modest scabbard slung carefully across his back, one of the sana he had forgotten the name of nudged him. He turned to her and she silently shoved a mug filled with warm butterbeer into his hands before retreating. The sana in the Aureum were famous - or, rather, infamous, with some folk - for their prophetic abilities, and he had a feeling that the young girl had known he would need the drink.</p><p>     He sipped it slowly, relishing the too sweet taste of the beer on his tongue before handing it to a passing fellow bellator, then walked briskly down the hall towards the callidus quarters. He approached the door of one of the newest members of the Aureum. Before he could even knock, she had the door open, her brow arched expectantly.</p><p>     "Yes, Bellator Potter?" she said, pressing her lips together.</p><p>     "Callidus Parkinson, I'm aware that you just escaped from the Knowing. Is there anybody else, er, trapped, that could provide useful to us?" Harry questioned, his mouth dry.</p><p>     In the war ravaged world, there were six groups in which an individual could be placed in. There were the docere, generally leaders and instructors that aided the younger ones; the bellator, who were mainly warriors; the callidus, who were assassins, spies, and scouts; the sana, who were healers and protectors, and more often than not had prophetic abilities; the pulchra, who were strategists, artists for when the days grew especially grim, and scholars; and finally, the umbra, who were those who didn't fit into any specific category, along with the squibs and rare muggles that worked with them. The groups were based off of an old system that, in a time before the Knowing and the Aureum even existed, thrived in a school that Docere McGonagall had attended, but refused to tell stories of.</p><p>     Pansy's eyes went dark. "Yes, there is, in fact." She didn't explain any further.</p><p>     "And... is there anything we can do to get him to our side?"</p><p>     She began speaking, but to Harry's confusion, didn't answer his question directly. "He is what you would call a callidus. An assassin, one that works with poisons. Merlin's beard, if Callidus Riddle made him assassinate some of the Aureum... even a sana gifted with healing magic couldn't do anything. He's terrifying. You're lucking that he's so adamant on not poisoning until he's eighteen, though, in reality, I don't think he wants to be a Knowingsman at all." As she said the last part, her voice went quiet, as if somebody was listening.</p><p>     "What's his name?"</p><p>     "He... we called him <em>Zmaj</em>. The Dragon."</p><p align="center">- - -</p><p>     Draco's mother held his arm in a vise-like grip, her smile plastic.</p><p>     "Oh, <em>Zmaj</em>, you look stunning," she cooed, and Draco felt as if he was going to throw up, his stomach like a storm. Instead, he just smiled faintly in response. His mother had always preferred her native language, Croatian, to the French, English, and Gaelic he knew she was fluent in.</p><p>     "Thank you, <em>Majka</em>." His tone was tight. She recognized the sound and frowned.</p><p>     "Is there something wrong?" She switched to French, the only language Draco was interested in, the only language nobody else except for them understood.</p><p>     "Of course not," he switched as well, the lie making his teeth ache. "I am excited to meet my future wife."</p><p>     "Really?" The cage surrounding his heart beginning to shrink, making him short of breath as he realized his mother was excited. "Oh, I knew you would be happy! She's one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen, but... ah. Well, you won't be seeing her until you take off her veil at the altar, will you?" The cage tightened even more.</p><p>     "What? But the party-"</p><p>     She shushed him, waving a hand in front of his face. They had begun to approach the ballroom, but she halted suddenly, turning to face him.</p><p>     "Ah, Draco, darling? The party is a masquerade. Did Pulchra Leanne not tell you? Well, I do have your mask - I hope you don't mind that it's purple instead of callidus green or silver." She reached into the folds of her large, emerald green skirts and pulled out a beautifully simple mask in the shape of a bird's face. It was swathed in shining periwinkle silk that was actually more blue than purple, and must've cost an absolute fortune, with loops of silver thread decorating it. Draco's mother set the mask onto his face and tied the ivory ribbon attached to the sides behind his head. She then pressed a soft kiss on the part of his cheek that went uncovered, no doubt leaving a smudge of her velvet lipstick behind.</p><p>     "Go," she whispered to her son, her lively blue eyes so different from his father's. "Go, Callidus Malfoy, and remember; Callidus Greengrass, that wife of yours, is powerful and brave enough to fight with you against those bastards."</p><p>     And Draco smiled.</p>
