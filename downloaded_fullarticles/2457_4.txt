    <p>Mid Nov. Christmas shopping</p><p> </p><p>Harry</p><p> </p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p> </p><p>What started as a good day has quickly gone South.  </p><p> </p><p>It's a Saturday so there's no lessons.  My tutors still keep the same schedule.  Sean thinks it'll help me to keep a scheduled routine.  And he's been awesome.  It's nice to know I have an adult to back me.  </p><p> </p><p>And ms. Rosalee is still teaching me at her brothers spice shop.  Freddie thinks it's great that they're teaching me about Wesen biology and healing.  And I get to meet several Wesen there that I wouldn't meet otherwise.  I love how relaxed it is, how comfortable they're all getting around me.  And yes it's odd having all adult friends but it's nice too.</p><p> </p><p>Trevor and I decided to do a bit of early Christmas shopping.  And while this is the second Christmas for me here its also one that means more to me.  I have friends now, as well as family.  And while it's only mid November I've decided to get a head start on shopping.  The shops aren't overcrowded so we've been able to just relax and browse.</p><p> </p><p>It's when we head back out that things turn bad.  There's four hundjager standing by Trevors truck, leaning casually.  They woge briefly but don't move.  Trevor and I both tense.  Now, I know what Sean would say.  He's tell me to get away but stay in crowds as long as I can.  And I know that's what Trever is about to push us to do.</p><p> </p><p>Then a long black limo pulls up behind us.  The back window rolls down to show two men.  The elder is grey haired with proud aristocratic features.  The younger has similar features only slightly less regal with short curly dark hair.  Sean's father and half brother.</p><p> </p><p>I sigh without meaning to.  You know, that annoyed huff that just escapes.  Sean will not be pleased and neither am I.  But he always said I'm to be nice, polite, and get away asap.  So I offer a wave and a frown.  No need to make them think I like them.</p><p> </p><p>The elder smiles, amused, "And you, my dear boy, must be my grandson.  Hadrian, correct?"</p><p> </p><p>I don't like him.  Trevor is still tense and ready to run.  There's also a few people slowing down as they realise there may be a problem.  Yay, witnesses.  So I can't even fully woge to scare them off.  They did this on purpose.  What am I saying, of course they did this on purpose.  They live to annoy.</p><p> </p><p>I shrug, "My name is Hadrian.  Shouldn't you be talking to my father?  You know, instead of me, a minor."</p><p> </p><p>"I would like you to join us for lunch," he offers hautily.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not hungry," I snap back.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, perhaps we can go somewhere for a little chat," he clearly didn't expect any disagreement.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't go off with strangers."</p><p> </p><p>He laughs, "My dear boy, we're family."</p><p> </p><p>"You may have knocked up my grandma," I bite out the words, "But that don't make us family."</p><p> </p><p>Trevor clears his throat, a clear reprimand.  And the hundjager shift around by the truck, clearly unhappy.  And while I doubt Sean would approve of my tone, he'll probably get a laugh out of it.  And we're attracting quite a crowd.  Man, I just need them to leave.</p><p> </p><p>Fine, I'll play nice, "Look, call my dad and ask him.  I doubt he will mind us meeting you for dinner while you're in town.  But as you can see I'm busy."</p><p> </p><p>The younger man, Eric, cuts in, "Americans are always so disrespectful.  Well, you can't expect a bastard to even know manners much less teach them to his son."</p><p> </p><p>And that little comment was heard by about a dozen people slowly ambling to their cars.  The Asshole!  </p><p> </p><p>"Now listen here you inbred prick," I snarl back, "I don't let anyone bad mouth my dad like that!  Especially some arrogant tosser who can't wipe his own ass, so piss off!"</p><p> </p><p>He purses his lips in anger.  Like I care!  And the elder is quick to say, "There is no insult meant to your father, of course.  And I understand that we surprised you.  But I would like to meet and get to know my grandson."</p><p> </p><p>"And again," I try for less snapping, "ask my Father.  If he says yes then sure, we'll have dinner."</p><p> </p><p>He starts talking again, polite oily words.  So I walk over to the drivers door and knock on the window.  He rolls it down and woges, hundjager.  Because of course he's hundjager.  Like do they just breed them out over there?  Like, hey here's a new litter just put them on the roster for next shift.  There's way to many of them, I swear.</p><p> </p><p>I woge, letting my power flow out like ripples in the water.  It's freeing, strong and cool.  I keep my eyes locked with his and I push.  I push him to obey.  I push him to obey my words.  And I command, "Drive them back to their hotel.  When he's spoken to my father, we'll talk."</p><p> </p><p>The man doesn't speak.  Of course not, I've pushed aside his will and left him with one clear order.  I got the idea from the coins.  I wasn't sure it would work but it clearly does because he drives away, ignoring the reprimand from the king.  </p><p> </p><p>Then I walk back to Trevor and woge again at the other hundjager.  They're quick to stalk off.  What a way to ruin a good day.  That old pompas ass.   All I did was buy us some time.  But now I can call Sean and let him know his family is in town.  This is going to suck.</p>
