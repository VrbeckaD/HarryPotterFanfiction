    <p>A/N I wouldn't mind feedback on this, good, bad, or neutral. Thanks for reading xx</p>
<p>Third Person</p>
<p>Percy Jackson could be seen lying down on a towel next to his girlfriend, Annabeth. It had been 18 days since the 'Chosen 7 of the Prophecy', had defeated their biggest threat, Gaea. 18 days since the Athena Parthenos had been delivered by the bravest people; Nico di Angelo, Reyna Avila Ram√≠rez-Arellano and Coach Hedge. It has been 13 days since Leo Valdez swooped into camp riding his dragon. However, a new passenger was with him. Someone no one but Percy had recognised. Her name was Calypso, and she was a goddess trapped on an island called Ogygia. It had been 4 days since Percy was able to forgive Calypso for the curse she gave him. But now, said hero was relaxing and enjoying the sun, the sound of the ocean, and his goddess next to him. That is until his best friend Grover appeared. </p>
<p>"Hey Percy!" The satyr stuttered. Percy thought nothing of it but his friend simply being shy. </p>
<p>"What's up G-man!" Percy threw up his arms and sat up to give a lopsided grin. </p>
<p>"Hey Grover!" Annabeth waved, sitting up with her head on Percy's chest. </p>
<p>"Can we go for a walk?" The trio then proceed to walk away from the beach, around the cabins.</p>
<p>"Anything specific you want to talk about?" Annabeth started, already knowing her friends antics.</p>
<p>"Well.. you see.. Chiron wants to meet you guys along with the other seven in the Big House.." Grover trailed off, sneaking a glance at Percy. He was shocked by what the satyr said, the water in the lake rose up then dropped just as quickly.</p>
<p>"Sorry.." Percy muttered to the irritated naiads.</p>
<p>"I'm guessing it's for a quest?" Annabeth held her eyebrow up to see if he'd confirm her suspicions.</p>
<p>"Yeah." Grover sighed and looked at his two best friends with pity in his eyes. "I know it hasn't been long, but this sounds very important."</p>
<p>Percy just waved his hand. "Well let's go see what it is, then I'll determine if I want to participate."</p>
<p>Once the trio arrived at the Big House, Grover left to go check on his girlfriend Juniper. Percy and Annabeth walked in, hands clasped together, and took a seat next to Piper. After all the rest of the seven arrived, Chiron clopped nervously at the ping-pong table everyone sat around. </p>
<p>"You guys are probably wondering what you're doing here." Chiron stated with nods all around. "Well as much as you guys deserve a break, the gods need you for a mission." Sighs went around while the centaur pinched the bridge of his nose. "Settle down. I know this is hard, especially after all you've gone through." He paused to look at his students. "So try not to thing of this as a quest. Think of it as time off. I think, although this is dangerous, it will be enjoyable in some ways for you. To help me explain, Nico di Angelo and Lady Hecate will talk to you." Chiron moved out of the way in time as a boy came through the wall and a goddess came into sight.</p>
<p>"Thank you Chiron," Hecate said. Her dark purple eyes skimmed the table. "Have you guys ever heard of wizards?"</p>
<p>Leo poked his head up from his tool belt where he was assembling some sort of mechanism under the table. "You mean the people who wave sticks around and yell spells at each other?"</p>
<p>Hecate took a deep breathe. "A couple of centuries ago, I made a group of people out of magic. You see, I redeemed myself to the King of the Gods, so he allowed me one wish. And my wish was to have my own group of people, since my children are rare and not always welcomed. Now, they do wear robes and pointy hats, have wands, and fly on brooms. But do not underestimate them. They are powerful, though most people need outlets, which are the reason for wands. An example of a powerful wizard is Tom Riddle. However, his hubris got to him. He was greedy and always searching for power. And for that, he became a dark wizard. Nico?"</p>
<p>Nico cleared his throat and stood up to face everyone. "I don't know much detail about this Tom Riddle, but he's bad news. He has angered my father, but he can't do anything about it as he's a god. There was a prophecy about Tom, and he tried to prevent it. And we can pretty much guess how that worked out." A chorus of groans agreed. "He murdered two people by the name of Lily and James Potter. He then tried to kill the baby, Harry, but the spell backfired. Tom died. But," He raised his hands dramatically, "His soul never reached the underworld. Dad has a feeling he is rising again, very soon. This puts Harry Potter in danger. Lady Hecate?" Nico sat back down.</p>
<p>"This is your mission. You go to the school he attends, befriend him, and just watch out for him. A war is brewing and it could be disastrous. We don't expect you to risk your lives for him, but do try to keep him out of trouble." Her ancient eyes looked stressful and almost pleading. The demigods glanced at each other, then slowly nodded their heads.</p>
<p>"How long will it take to complete this mission?" Annabeth finally spoke up. At this, the goddess pursed her lips. </p>
<p>"A couple of years." Everyone once again shared looks. "You go during the year, then come back for the summer. I know this is asking too much, but the gods need your help. The boy cannot do it alone, and we have the strongest demigods in generations here. We are asking for your help."</p>
<p>"Flattery won't work on us, Lady Hecate. However.." Piper's voice trailed off while looking at the others. "Learning magic would be interesting, and I believe we could take a break from quests for a while." People nodded their agreement.</p>
<p>"Thank you heroes. I will give you your wands, and you'll be spending a week at the The Order Of Phoenix headquarters. You'll meet everybody you need to know and the Headmaster of the school will answer any questions you have. I don't think I have to include this, but do not reveal your identities to any of the students. Am I clear?" Everyone nodded their heads in agreement. "Good. Meet at the top of Half-Blood Hill at noon tomorrow I will be transporting everyone at the destination." With that, the goddess was out of sight.</p>
<p>/ Line Break /</p>
<p>"What do you think about this new mission?" Percy asked his girlfriend, on their way to Cabin 3.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, this is all just so new. Wizards? It's just too much. After all we've been through, there's magic now?" She shook her head. "I don't know Percy. It's just too bizarre."</p>
<p>The rest of the walk was in comfortable silence. Annabeth started to pack for the both of them, since they lived together in the Poseidon cabin. Chiron, even Mr. D, couldn't keep them apart. The screaming at night was all too much stress for the other campers. Too many questions were asked, and Chiron sympathised. So he allowed Annabeth to move in with Percy. </p>
<p>"Goodnight, Wise Girl." Percy yawned.</p>
<p>Annabeth, who was on his chest, replied with a "Goodnight Seaweed Brain." Before they both passed out from the overwhelming day.</p>
<p>/ Line Break /</p>
<p>After breakfast, the demigods agreed to meet at the meeting place. Although they were an hour early, Hecate came by. In her hands she held wands.</p>
<p>"Now, these were especially made for you. From the wood, to the cores. So please don't break them." Hecate sighed and looked at Leo and Percy before handing everyone their wands.</p>
<p>"Since you guys have no knowledge of the wizarding world, I will cast a spell on you guys. It shouldn't hurt, it'll just give you 4 years worth of knowledge since everyone is going to be in the fourth year. I recommend closing your eyes." A grey mist surrounded the half-bloods while the goddess of magic continued to chant. At the end of it, a white light flashed and the people on the hill clutched their heads while groaning.</p>
<p>"You said it wasn't going to hurt!" Leo complained.</p>
<p>"I said it shouldn't." Hecate smiled softly, amusement in her eyes.</p>
<p>After everyone got their bearings back, they stood in a tight circle. 8 people in a circle, surrounding a glowing goddess. Surprisingly, not the weirdest thing they have done.</p>
<p>The 8 demigods landed outside where an old man with a long beard awaited them. His half moon glasses were resting on the edge of his nose while regarding the new comers.</p>
<p>"Welcome. Let's go inside where we can start our meeting." The building they were standing in front of opened, revealing a new one. The half-bloods followed the old man inside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ron Weasely, Harry Potter, and Hermione Granger were sitting in the kitchen speaking of the new students.</p>
<p>"I wonder what they'll be like." Ron said.</p>
<p>"I wonder what kinda magic they use! Or if they use different magic." Hermione added.</p>
<p>"I just hope they are nothing like Malfoy." Harry expressed, leaning back in his chair. That's when the door opened, revealing Dumbledoor with the kids. Molly Weasley came rushing in.</p>
<p>"Come in! Come in! You must be hungry!" </p>
<p>"Uh, no thank you. We feel kind of jet lagged." A boy with blonde hair and a scar by his mouth said.</p>
<p>"Alright, we shall have the Order meeting now. You three, go upstairs and no listening!" The mother exclaimed. The said three went upstairs.</p>
<p>/ Line Break /</p>
<p>| Percy Pov |</p>
<p>After the three kids went up and the door closed, Mrs. Weasley ushered us into a room where a good amount of people were sitting. Then she waved her wand around, probably putting a silencing charm on just in case.</p>
<p>"Let's start with introductions on our part shall we?" She summoned chairs, and we all took a seat.</p>
<p>"I am Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster at the Wizarding School named Hogwarts."</p>
<p>I couldn't keep in his giggles and looked around. Leo started to laugh, and the others followed along. I couldn't help it. It was just funny sounding. However, we earned a couple of glares.</p>
<p>"Anyways." Someone cut it, "My name is Arthur Weasley, and that's my wife." He said, pointing at the lady who brought us in.</p>
<p>"I am Severus Snape." Said a man who looked vaguely familiar. Like I might have seen him in passing a couple of times, but I couldn't remember exactly where. Or maybe he was on TV? But I didn't watch much TV either. While I pondered this, the introductions were over.</p>
<p>"Titles, names, or a bit of history?" Hazel asked.</p>
<p>"A bit of history. We'll answer all questions afterwards, so no interruptions please." Annabeth said, rolling her hand in a 'go on' motion.</p>
<p>"I am Hazel Levesque. Daughter of Pluto, Hades' Roman form. I died in the 1940's, and was brought back to life my brother. It's been 10 monthsish since I've been alive, again, and I'm still adjusting. I released the magical horse known as Arion, and he has adopted me as his human. I aided in the defeat of Alycyoneus. I am a centurion of the Fifth Cohort in New Rome. I defeated Scirion using the Mist. I also defeated the sorceress Pasipha√´, and helped shadow travel my friends out of the House of Hades. Frank Zhang is my boyfriend. I took part in destroying Gaea. I am one of the chosen 7, and I'm a hero of Olympus." She sighed and sat down. She then gave Frank a small squeeze and he stood up.</p>
<p>"My name is Frank Zhang, son of Mars, Area's Roman form. Though, I am a descendent of Periclymenus, which means I can change into animals. I'm also a legacy of Poseidon. While I'm at it, I'm a Chinese Canadian too.. Anyways, I defeated a couple of basilisks and aided killing Alycyoneus and Polybotes. I aided in killing Chrysaor and his dolphin men. I am slayer of all the Katobleps in Italy. I became Praetor of the Twelfth Legion, commanding an army of ghosts against monsters. I helped capture Nike, the goddess of Victory, and used my sock to gag her. I took part in bringing down Mother Earth. I am one of the chosen 7, and a hero of Olympus."</p>
<p>Piper then stood up and took a deep breathe. "My name is Piper McLean. I am a daughter of Aphrodite, and head counselor of cabin 10. I have the ability to charmspeak, though I try not to use it. However, in the Wolf House, I did use it to lull Gaea back to sleep, even if it was momentarily. I am wielder of the blade Katoptris, who can see visions. I fought the goddess Khione, and won, taking her brothers swords as my own. I also made my friend's metal dragon come to life. I aided in the destruction of the giants. I lulled Gaea to sleep, and helped destroy her. I am one of the chosen 7, and a hero of Olympus."</p>
<p>After she sat down, Jason stood. "I am Jason Grace, son of Jupiter, Zeus' Greek form. I am also Piper's boyfriend. I am considered Pontifex Maximus, and I'm head counselor of cabin one. I used to be Praetor until I gave my position to Frank. I was also taken by Juno, Hera's Greek form, and had my memories washed away. I am defeater of the ventus spirit Dylan. I am defeater of Krios on Mount Othyrus. I defeated Polybotes with the help of Kym. I held Gaea up in the sky to defeat the primordial goddess. I aided in destroying lots of monsters, I'm one of the chosen 7, and I'm a hero of Olympus."</p>
<p>Leo jumped up and stretched. "I am Leo Valdez, Bad Boy Supreme, Super Sized McShizzle, and the Repair Boy. My mother was killed by Gaea when I was young and my aunt was actually Hera. I repaired a metal dragon and named him Festus. After he was destroyed, I made him the head maste on my spanking hot war machine. You can pretty much call me the captain. I do all the repairs and I like to build things. On our way to Greece, I rebuilt my dragon in the ship. Once we were thrown all the way to New York, I used my dragon to help raise Gaea into the sky. I blew her up, and died in the process. I found an impossible island and save a goddess, who's now my girlfriend, from her island! I was brought to life by a cure we asked Apollo's son for. Team Leo!" Leo then brought out what he was building and shot it into the sky. Everyone had 'Team Leo' written on their arms. I shook with laughter and then burst with giggles with everyone else. </p>
<p>Once everyone settled, Nico got up and sat on the table, slouching his shoulders. "I am Nico di Angelo, son of Hades. Half-brother to Hazel. My sister, Bianca, died in an accident. My mother was killed by the 'King of Gods'". Here he took a breath and shook his head. " I was born in the 1900's and was trapped in a casino where time stops. I am the Ambassador of Pluto and took the title of Ghost King from Midas in the Battle of the Labyrinth. I convinced my father to help Percy in the Second Titan War. I brought honour to my father. I ventured into Tartarus.. which is hell, mind you, to close the Doors of Death.. but.. " Nico had to stop and Hazel put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. I understood how he felt. "I was captured and put in a jar, awaiting for the seven to rescue me. I promised Percy that I'd go to the House of Hades and close the Doors of Death. I was then forced by Cupid, he's the worst, to reveal my feelings for Percy. Which are gone, by the way. I was able to obtain Diocletian's scepter, which summons ghosts. I used this to assist Frank and the others in defending ourselves. Later, I took the quest of taking the Athena Parthenos from Greece to New York, which nearly killed me. I had help from Reyna and Coach Hedge. On the way, I accidentally murdered a guy by turning him into a ghost and sending him to the Fields of Punishment. We did make it to Camp Half-Blood and I helped prevent the camp from being overrun. I am defender and Hero of Olympus Twice and I'm a survivor of Tartarus." Nico sat down and put his head in his hands. Piper was trying to convince him everything was okay while Hazel rubbed his back.</p>
<p>To take the attention off of him, Annabeth stood up. "I am Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena. Girlfriend of Percy Jackson. Rebuilder of Mount Olympus. Head counselor of the Athena cabin. When I was seven years old, I ran away from home. I met Thalia and her friend Luke." Her voice cracked and I held her hand. She gave me a squeeze. "On our way to camp, we were constantly attacked by monsters. We were led into a trap by a Cyclops, and I managed to stab him in the foot and escape with my friends. We made it to Camp, but Thalia died and turned into a tree. Luke grew bitter because of this. I went on the quest to return Zeus' Master Bolt and we succeed. I sailed the Sea of Monsters and I. Am. Nobody. I outsmarted the giant guarding the Golden Fleece. I was kidnapped and force the hold the weight of the world, literally. I lead the quest through the Labyrinth. I helped in the Second Titan War. My old blade was the one Luke used to kill himself to kill the Titan Lord. I almost went crazy looking for Percy after Hera took him from me. I took my own path to get the Mark of Athena. A quest where no others have returned. I found it and was faced with my worst fear. Arachne. I was able to trap her, but she dragged me into Tartarus. Before I fell, Percy grabbed me. But, he couldn't pull us both up. And we fell.." I stood up and pulled her into a hug. "I spent my birthday in hell. We were there for 2 and a half weeks. Bob.. and Damasan.." She started to sob and I held back my own tears. After a moment, she continued. "We faced Tartarus himself and were able to reach the overworld once again. Even through our many sacrifices. I helped defeat the giants, I am the Savior of Olympus multiple times. I survived Tartarus and helped defeat Gaea. I am one of the Chosen 7."</p>
<p>I held her in my arms and kissed her tears away. It was my turn and I was nervous. "I am Perseus Jackson, though I prefer Percy. I am a Praetor of New Rome and Head Counselor of Cabin 3. I am a Son of Poseidon. When I was 12 years old, I was attacked my the Minotaur. I thought my mother died, so I killed him with my bare hands. In a game of Capture the Flag, I was attacked by a hellhound. That's when my father claimed me. However, this angered Zeus further, so I had to venture to get Zeus' lightning bolt. I obtained my sword Riptide from my mentor, and it always reappears in my pocket. I killed Procrustes with it and traveled into the underworld. I also accidentally blew up the Saint Louis Arc. I fought, and beat, the war god when I was 12. I was able to return the Master Bolt and Hades' Helm of Darkness. I sailed the Sea of Monsters and took the Golden Fleece. Although I was turned into a guinea pig on the way." I smiled sheepishly and Annabeth gave a small laugh. "I went on a quest to save Annabeth from the Titan's. I held the sky up while battle went on. I traveled the Labyrinth and defeated the giant Aneaus. I broke The Hundred Handed One out of prison. My friend Rachel also hit the Titan Lord in the eye with a blue plastic hairbrush. I also also accidentally blew up a whole volcano and woke up one of the worst Titans. But when I went to war, I killed a couple of badies. I went back into the underworld and Nico had me take the Curse of Achilles. I became invisible. I only had one weak spot, one part of me that kept me mortal. After the war, the gods offered me immortality. I turned it down for Annabeth. I wanted to spend our lives together, yanno?" I blushed and ran my hands through my hair. "I was kidnapped and lost my memory. The only thing I remembered was my name and Annabeth's. It would have literally killed me if I didn't know who she was because she's what made me mortal. I traveled to Alaska and took back the Eagle for the Twelfth Legion. When I was finally reunited with my girlfriend, do you know what she did? She flipped me!" Everyone laughed a bit at that. "When I finally saw Annabeth again.. well she was falling into Tartarus. I grabbed her by one arm, and held on with the other. Once we fell in, we were attacked by many monsters. We had help from a friend named Bob.. His real name was Iapetus. I defeated him and washed his memory clean a while back, doing a chore for Hades. The giants were after us and to get to the Doors of Death, we had to be shrouded in the Mist. So we went and that is where we saw Misery. She would be able to hide us from the monsters. When she tried to kill us, I used my powers to try to kill her. Even when she was down, I used her own poison to choke her. I wanted to keep going, it felt so good, I felt so powerful. I wanted to see how much misery Misery could take. Thankfully, Annabeth snapped me out of it. After we left hell, we headed straight for Greece. Arriving at the roots of the gods, we planned for an ambush. However, it went all wrong. Me and 'Beth got captured and the giants needed our blood to awaken Gaea. I was slammed into a pillar and my bloody nose, sorry for the pun, woke up the goddess. Can you believe that? In the end, she was defeated, thankfully. But we sacrificed so much. Even our own sanity. I am the Hero of Olympus multiple times. I am survivor of Tartarus. I am one of the Chosen 7 and I am tired of being the gods pawn." I slumped back in my seat, pulling Annabeth along with me. It was silent for a while, everyone lost in their own thoughts.</p>
<p>"That's terrible." Molly finally spoke up. "No children should have been through any of that."</p>
<p>"I think it's fair to say that we aren't children anymore. Plus, the gods don't care. They are arrogant and have big egos." I laughed bitterly. Lighting shook the building. </p>
<p>"Percy.. I'd be careful." Piper warned.</p>
<p>"When was the last time they did us a favour? Piper, when you've gone too hell and suffered what we've suffered, then you try to act respectful towards the gods."</p>
<p>Piper opened her mouth to respond, but then closed it. I sighed before saying, "I'm sorry.. it's just. It's so hard." Slamming my head on the table, I could feel the wizards unease from the amount of information.</p>
<p>"Have you got any questions?" Jason piped up.</p>
<p>"Are you going to tell the kids?" The one named Lupin asked.</p>
<p>"Of course not." Piper assured. "It'd be in our best interest."</p>
<p>"Could we see your powers?" Asked a girl named Tonks. We all nodded our heads.</p>
<p>Hazel summoned jewels from the earth and then put them back with some 'oohs' and 'aahs'. Frank turned into a snake, then into a dog, then back into Frank. He earned a round of applause. Piper told everyone to drop and give her 10, which they unwillingly did, but weren't mad about it. Jason jumped into the air and floated around everyone's head. That earned a couple of gasps and laughs. Leo said "This boy is on fire!" Then proceed to run around on fire. Nico summoned some skeleton's then sent them back. Annabeth correctly guessed everyone's age and hobby's because she's smart like that. I used to the water in the glasses on the table to raise then fall on me. I let it wet me then snapped my fingers and I was dry again.</p>
<p>"That sure is interesting. I believe your help will be useful, and I assure you it will not be a waste of time." Albus concluded. On that happy note, we all left to eat.</p>

<p>--------<br/>A/N What'd you guys think? Anything I should fix? Any Povs you'd like to see? Comments? Questions?</p>
<p>Qotd:<br/>Would you be in the Harry Potter world and be friends with the trio or be in Percy Jackson world and be friends with the 7?</p>
<p>My answer:<br/>PJ because it'd be a diverse world and you have an excuse for getting in trouble. Maybe even get a chance in Elysium.</p>
